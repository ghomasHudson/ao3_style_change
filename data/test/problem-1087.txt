Harry sighed, squeezed hard one last time before he let go, letting the man drop to the floor, crumpling in on himself with coughs and gasping breaths.
This shocked Harry, but clearly Draco needed this (and so did he, if he was being honest), so he said fuck it. He grabbed the blond’s hips and repeated his motion from before, over and over and over.
Snape eyed him skeptically. He gently released his godson, who immediately fell to the ground, scrambled up, and reattached himself to Harry. He whimpered and nuzzled Harry, who awkwardly patted his back. Snape fixed his sleeves and strode passed Harry, then suddenly stopped and turned back to the two boys. “I want to see you after class Potter. We need to discuss... this matter.” Then he strode into his classroom, not bothering to wait for them.
“How about *kiss* you go downstairs *kiss* and make us *kiss* some hot cocoa *kiss* and we’ll watch *kiss* whatever you want.” *kiiisssssss*
Harry exhaled shakily. He expected anything he did with Draco from this moment on to be quite unlike anything he’s done before. He knew he wouldn’t be the same afterwards- that nothing would. They were ready. Draco’s enthusiasm just made it all the more exciting.
But Draco was still a little upset. He was proud to be with Harry, and if they were to spend the rest of their lives together as mates, everyone would eventually find out anyways, whether they would tell the press themselves or they would be spotted together in public, grocery shopping or taking a walk in the park, holding hands or sneaking quick kisses to each other.
“Woah, hold your horses there, Alpha. It’s fine. They aren’t doing anything. A little stoic, but nothing I haven’t dealt with before. They’re fine, really. I just don’t want them to hate me on my first shift.”
“No, no, it’s ok.” Draco said. “I’m aware of your feelings. Not much has changed, I guess. You rest, ok?” and with that, he all but ran from the kitchen, ignoring Harry’s daunting sighs.
“‘Mione, now’s not the time. I’ll tell you later. They’re expecting him.” Ron said. He stood and gathered the clothing Harry had strewn across the room in his attempt for relief.
“So, gentleman, you’re here to ask some questions, I heard. I’m more than happy to help. Ask away.” she said, interlacing her hands atop her desk.
“They don’t care about cursed mail. They are simple enough incantations. If you deem them too much of a challenge, you can trade with another one of us.”
“I seriously doubt she will. Just the way she looked at me after, it was like nothing even happened.”
After what seemed like an hour, Madame Pomfrey beckoned them over. “He will be ok, but we need to speak with Mr Potter. Do you know where he is?”
“Because, what are you going to do about it? I feel like I’m dying! I’m even having damn seizures, all because of a stupid damn prophecy that had to- just had to pair me with you! Of all people!”
When it was time for a break, everyone left the mailing room, leaving Draco alone. Frankly, he didn’t know what to do. He had no idea what Harry was doing. Harry was probably still working or had his break at another time, but he didn’t want to stay down in the basement for the hour he had off for his lunch break. So, Draco wandered up to Harry’s floor, hoping to catch him at a free moment.
Harry's nails almost dug into the wood as his hands gripped onto the bench for dear life, as no one raised their hand for a few silent moments.
“Any infatuation Mr Malfoy might have towards you, must be taken up with him.” Madame Pomfrey stated.
Potter looked at him from the side, a sincere look on his face. He smiled. “You are good at making people feel better about themselves.”
Harry smiled and refrained from mentioning that that was the most the blond had spoken all day. "Still have that 'horrid house-elf', actually." He continued down the hall into the kitchen. "Here, is the kitchen. You should probably know that Kreacher doesn't cook much, but he will clean up afterwards. He's never had a knack for cooking and I couldn't agree with that more." Harry chuckled slightly. He looked to see the blonds lips pursed and looking around curiously. "I normally cook for myself, but I also order in sometimes. I like cooking but we can alternate days or something if you like too, as well. I don't mind. Unless you don't want to cook at all, that's ok too." He rambled.
Draco knew that it wasn’t just fucking. Even pansy confirmed it. For some reason though, he didn’t want to say what they were both thinking, because that would imply that he was thinking about him and Harry, which somehow translated to him being vulnerable, which he was extremely insecure about. He wanted to hear Harry say it so that he wasn’t the only one being vulnerable; to prove that he wasn’t the only one thinking about what they were.
“Mr Malfoy, if you don’t mind me asking, do you not feel any negative effects from the magic of the prophecy?” Walkins asked.
Long awaited chapter. I’ve actually had this waiting for the longest time, I just didn’t know how to end it. Hope you enjoyed :)
“And teasing you were.” Harry growled again. He pounced on top of Draco, kissing and licking his neck affectionately. Draco screamed with delight, giggling as Harry gripped and groped his sides.
At this point, Harry wasn’t sure what Snape was asking of him when he asked to meet him after class. If Snape wasn’t going to add to his punishment (which Harry was grateful for, mind you), he didn’t know what the Professor was getting at.
“Tell me how you went from absolute pure hate, to that.” Ron said, pointing to the doors which led back to the sitting room with the fireplace, where Harry and Draco came in.
“Why? Is there something you need my help with?” He asked, regarding the papers on the desk behind him.
Once Harry was seated inside the courtroom again, he glanced up to the Minister's place and caught the slight frown that Kingsley threw his way.
“How many people do you work with? What’re their names and ages?” Harry asked, grabbing a notepad and a pen.
“So you’re liking the work? See, it’s not too bad. Are they treating you well? Do I need to speak with anyone down there?” Harry asked, sitting up straighter, the topic of Draco’s safety clearly a serious issue to him.
“That’s probably Ron.” Harry guessed. He stood up, taking Draco with him. Harry grinned as Draco squawked at him, trying to wriggle out of his arms. As he released the blond, he gave him a little slap on his arse. He got a glare in return.
Ron just snorted. “Mate, are you that daft? Who do we know that you hate and makes you angry, with blond hair and grey eyes?”
“Great, what else has he said?” He muttered under his breath. “Look, Granger, not that I don’t appreciate your and Harry’s attempt to discuss with me matters that frankly don’t concern you-” he was abruptly stopped when her hand shot up at him.
“HAHAHA, are you serious?” Draco said. Harry looked at him with a raised brow. “You actually want to be with me?” He scolded himself for sounding so pathetic.
“Yeah, but the prophecy doesn’t know that.” Harry said. “It’s a big deal to ‘old P’ what we say to each other most of the time.”
Draco blushed slightly and replied "I prefer it, actually." A shy smile graced his lips and Harry thought he'd never seen anything more beautiful. A few more moments pass of silence then "Can I call you 'Harry'?" The blond asked.
“Don’t bother. She already came in. She explained everything to me, except why. I really have no clue. I didn’t see it coming at all.” his eyebrows knitted together at the thought.
“I wouldn’t be working with you though. I will be sorting through mail to see what belongs in which section of the ministry, in a dirty old basement alongside criminals and thugs- wait….” Draco paused and a look of pure offense fitted his face. Harry shifted in his seat, knowing what was coming next.
It’s not like he even wanted to leave Harry. Obviously he loved the dramatic Gryffindor, but who wants to be married to someone who practically hates you--
Harry smirked. “While I do like you calling me sir, I don’t appreciate your outlook on this situation. It was nice enough of Kingsley to offer you a job, even after your trial. Take the actual job requirements with a grain of salt and just appreciate the fact that you were given a job outside of these four walls. Work a week or two with me, and then you can quit if you really feel necessary.” Harry said from his seat at the table.
Harry was panting with the force of which he’d cast the spell, still watching the blond closely for any signs of danger. But they didn’t come, and the blond just stood there, staring off into the distance, presumably unaware of what was going on.
But what he smelt proved to be the exact opposite of what he thought: shock, regret, and something warm, maybe longing?
“No, Harry, what are you doing? No, no, don’t- Harry!” Malfoy cried. Harry was able to free himself and dart away, leaving Malfoy on the bathroom floor, just as he found him- distressed and crying.
“Oh, no! That’s not what I meant. It’s just, when you think about it, it’s a wonder how we’ve been able to look past all of it and find each other.”
A good century later, according to Draco, Harry eventually bottomed out, constantly caressing Draco’s back, hips and thighs.
Draco was not expecting that. He’d have to admit that his leave of the table was uncalled for and very improper without excusing oneself, but Harry’s question caught him so off guard.
Harry started blushing and sputtered for a second before saying “Well, not necessarily. Seeing as we're both unmated and our close proximity, it's likely we'll grow to be attached to each other. However, considering our past and all, I understand that it might be, well, hard to find a way to get over it all.” Draco remained silent so Harry went on. “I'm willing to put everything behind us, start new. As long as that's what you want.”
He pushes all thoughts of love and happiness into the reserves of his mind and focuses on only causing pleasure and relief to his high strung penis.
Later at the pub, surrounded by a bunch of Gryffindors, Draco sipped his whiskey while softly resting his hand on Harry’s leg.
Harry turned sharply, their faces much closer than he would’ve liked, but he kept it to himself for the dramatics. “Careful, or I’ll tape your mouth shut.”
The late morning sun shone delicately through the sheer curtains and onto the peacefully sleeping boys. It slowly roused them awake from their comfortable places, and reminded them where they had fallen asleep.
Harry felt a slight twinge in his heart at that. “Of course I do, baby. I really do. We should just have time for us right now though, don’t you think? There’s no rush-”
“Meeting someone tonight?” Ted asked gruffly. He had a thing for Draco ever since he started coming here. Aside from a few chats and rounds of pool, they never really talked that much. Draco wasn’t particularly interested in Ted, but he was still nice to him.
But, he couldn’t help feeling sorry for him. He knew what it was like to not have a crush reciprocated, he knew what it was like to feel lost and helpless.
Draco didn’t know if it was because of all the wine they had, or because Harry had hit a soft spot with his flirting, but before he knew it, he blew up.
The blond chuckled “I decided we needed to take it up a notch.” and he was grinning. GRINNING, the cheeky bastard.
Harry gulped. “N-no, we should go.” He fled to the bedroom to get dressed. He just hoped that the blond would leave him be.
“Wait. He had a seizure?” Hermione and Ron said together, both shocked. “You never said…” Hermione says.
“I understand your concern, Mr Potter, however prophecies, curses and magical vows are tricky things to work with.” Walkins explains. “It will take some more research, consideration and time, we might just be able to figure out how to deal with the new information brought to light.”
He may have control, but he’s still a beast. He hoisted the blond up around his hips, walked over to the bed, threw him down, crawled over top, and made out with him like never before. He didn’t touch him aside from kissing though, seeing as how Draco made it clear from before, that he wanted to talk to Harry before they did anything too serious. Maybe he just needed to be put in his place.
Just then, Marigold Pearings, the medi-witch from that morning and the night before, appeared in the doorway; a tall, frail-looking woman, possibly in her late thirties, stood beside her.
Harry pushed Draco down and onto his back again, although less forceful, and climbed over top of him.
The support on this story has been insane, I’m so thankful to everyone who reads and responds to my fics. I’m always looking for suggestions, so if you have any, PLEASE let me know! Thanks :)
“Morning.” Draco stretched out like a cat, and the warm hand expanded its territory by gliding up and down his sides.
It dawned on him, that as they knelt there together kissing each other like their lives depended on it, they had never kissed yet. Not even at the end of their wedding ceremony.
“Touch me again, and I’ll shove my foot so far up your pasty arse, I’ll be able to kick it to fucking China.” Harry growled quietly.
“Mr Potter, seeing as you managed to cause this.. problem, you will be tasked to watch over Draco until we conjure a cure for him.”
Potter stopped laughing, hearing his first name come from Draco. A smile stayed in place, though. “Harry is nice.”
Harry and Draco looked at each other desperately. “It’s ok, we’ll get through this. I’m glad we’re learning about it now so it’s not a surprise later.” Draco said, seeing the worry in Harry’s expression.
Draco could admit that he was overreacting. They both knew keeping their relationship to themselves was the better choice rather than telling everyone about it. Their close friends knew, as well as the Minister of Magic, as per Harry’s request because he had to know how they were doing, living with each other and all.
Draco sighs. He pears back into the shop to see everyone working and everything looking alright. He decides to indulge in Potter and what he has to say. He’s always been more lenient when it comes to him, anyways.
"He can stay with me." Harry blurted out. Kingsley and Draco's gazes snapped his way immediately. Harry shuffled awkwardly as he inwardly scolded himself. "I mean, I've got all of Grimmauld place to myself. It's actually quite empty." He shrugged, dropping his gaze to the tiled floor. "I don't know, just a thought." He offered.
“-alright Mr Malfoy-” Madame Pomfrey was speaking to Malfoy when Harry came in, but was barely heard over Malfoy’s shouting.
All the while the three were catching up, Draco stood awkward and tall behind Harry. Only after a few moments did the other to look and acknowledge him.
Harry blinked up at him before shutting his eyes tightly and taking in a few deep breaths. Eventually he spoke “Nightmare.”
Draco finished, waking up beside Harry to kiss his head before leaving, but Harry turned and grabbed him, kissing him fully and deeply, one would almost call it making out. Draco would have climbed into his lap and stayed there if it wasn’t for the fact they were at work, and he really should go back.
The blonde woman sat down at the dinner table, watching her nephew talk and work. She tracked the movements of his hips and shoulders and he nearly danced around the kitchen, grabbing plates and setting places.
Hermione and Fleur apparently thought that was the funniest thing they’d ever heard, because they started cackling. Well, Hermione was cackling, Fleur’s laugh was too elegant for such a crass word to apply. It still irritated Harry, though. He crossed his arms over his chest again, serving the dual purpose of helping him sulk, and hiding his bust from Ron and the other boys.
“Draco. You seem to be getting along nicely with your little friend here. Why don’t you introduce her?” Harry stiffened in his seat, eyes going wide and staring at his rival. He shook his head lightly, then turned around to see the refined countenance of Lucius Malfoy.
The dressing-down Hermione had watched Harry get was objectively impressive, especially coming from such a reserved woman. It covered everything from dress code, to respecting oneself as a woman, to managing time properly concerning study and sleep. The talking-to she’d gotten afterward left her feeling sad she’d disappointed her Professor. Hermione had lost her house 5 points for her misdemeanor.
The green eyed boy leveled an unamused stare at his friend. “Yes, thank you Ron, for that wonderfully insightful gem of knowledge.”
Really, the only downside of being at the Dursley’s so far this summer was Dudley’s diet. After noticing his weight problem, one of the nurses at Smelting’s had decided Harry’s cousin needed a carefully monitored list of meals. Unfortunately, this meant that aunt Petunia was forcing everybody else in the house to adhere to the same diet. In solidarity, she had said. Harry thought the idea of Dudley eating nothing but fruits and veg the entire summer was hilarious. Luckily, our sneaky little Gryffindor had managed to squirrel away a decent amount of food from the leaving feast at Hogwarts, so he could snack when he got too hungry.
The group finally made it to the stairs and started climbing, and climbing, and climbing. At last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and smack dab between the goal posts. About twenty purple chairs with gold embroidery stood in two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined.
Hey everyone. So, it's been.... just, a long time since I've updated any of my stories. I could give a lot of excuses, but I know as a reader myself that most of you probably won't much care. The gist is that I'm not abandoning this story, and sometimes I det both/either depressed or distracted from writing. I mostly upload this in chapters to keepmyself accountable, but that doesn't seem to have worked well.
"Did sir just call Winky Dobby?" squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Harry’s little friend’s had been, a tinny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected, though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf, that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.
In his second year, Harry had had to deal with a mad house elf, his relatives locking him in his room, a rogue bludger (sabotaged by said house elf), the fact that he could speak to snakes being known to the entire school now, the ostracization that came from his Parseltongue ability, a basilisk petrifying students, and Voldemort (again?) draining his friend’s sister of her life force to resurrect his sixteen year old self. All in all, a bad year for everyone.
Harry grumbled something about “-not cute…”, and crossed his arms. This caused his mood to sour a little, because he found the way he crossed his arms to be a little uncomfortable in his new body. He’d have to learn to do a number of things differently, he noted absently.
Harry stopped, then replayed what he’d said, his face slowly going from pale, to pink, to crimson in rapid succession. He looked back up at the boy opposite him, who had his face in his hand. “Potter,” he said resignedly, looking past Harry, then into the emerald eyes across from him. “I think it’s best that I let you go back to the… your friends tents. I will send an owl to arrange a time to meet up so we can discuss this with clear heads.” With that, Malfoy turned around and a shiver went down the green eyed boy’s spine when he heard two voices clear their throats behind him expectantly.
Harry groaned, letting his head fall backward, then rolled his eyes and tried to focus on whatever it was that Dumbledore was saying about the Goblet of Fire. It really was unfortunate that when he focused in that direction, the magical artifact seemed to reach out for him.
Harry nodded warily, as if expecting the healer to grow fangs and claws. “Yeah, I’ve been learning some… uh... “ He looked over at Hermione. She rolled her eyes, then turned to Madam Pomfrey.
Once the game was finished (which Ireland won, to Harry’s minor disappointment) and they’d dodged the other occupants of the top box, Draco was instructed by his father to escort his companion back to her family, then to take his portkey home.
Further contemplation would have to wait, however, because it seemed as if Harry were coming out of his shocked state.
Harry looked a little smug, and that comment seemed to be the thing that tore the awkward wall between them down. For the rest of the song and the game, Harry and Malfoy made small talk and had their first civil conversation since they’d met in Madam Malkins before their first year.
The older gentleman looked like he was merely indulging the excited englishman until he saw Harry’s scar. At that point, he gabbled something unintelligible in his native tongue to one of his attendants, then took a closer look at Harry. The man looked him up and down, then looked somewhat smug upon seeing Harry’s Bulgaria jersey. It was then that the worst possible guests made their appearance.
Ron gave a wave as he walked over from the swing set, while the twins grabbed Harry’s trunk and went over to their father with a dual wink to its owner. In short order, everyone was standing in a circle and Arthur held out a foot-long bit of rope. Harry, confused, followed everyone else’s lead when they reached out and touched the rope with a pointer finger.
Time spent at the Burrow was much different than time spent at the Dursley home. There were still chores to do, but with five brothers, a sister and two guests present, it almost seemed like the chores finished themselves. De-gnoming the garden was still a favorite task of Harry’s, along with tending the chickens and helping Mrs. Weasley prep meals. Ginny needled Hermione about Bill, and the two of them jeered at Harry for his inability to stay calm around the man (“Aww, you’re just like Ginny was first year!” Hermione had joked). Harry did finally get around to asking about the tiny owl that Ron had sent (“I call him Pig. Ginny named him Pigwidgeon, and now he won’t answer to anything else.” he’d informed Harry).
Garish tents of all sizes, color, and quality were on display. Some of them looked like miniature castles, some like dinky little muggle tents. And once you’d stopped taking the tents themselves into account, there were people of all nationalities and colors. And Harry
“Seems sturdy enough,” Vernon mused out loud. “Same with the boots. Don’t see the purpose of the overcoat, though.”
The poor little thing looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose like a ripe tomato. It wasn't Dobby - it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry's friend Dobby had been.
The girl was wearing Gryffindor colors, but an ill-fitting men’s uniform for some reason. Also, her hair was decidedly rumpled, and she looked like she’d fall asleep at any moment. It took her a moment, but she noticed that the girl’s top was tight around her chest and her eh-hem… assets were on display in a very unbecoming way..
Harry had no answer to this question, so he just shrugged with his face screwed up in a hopeless grin. “Looks like it’s just another one of those weird ‘Harry Potter’ things.”
The older girl stood up and waved her wand over Harry. He felt a familiar tingle in his ears, so he didn’t think too much about it and pulled out his Transfiguration book so he could try and catch up with the theory of last class. Fleur put paid to that idea by nicking the book and putting it into her own bag.
Two hours went by. Two stress filled, nerve-wracking hours. But in the end, the aggressors were ousted, and Mr. Weasley came back into the tent, weary and grim-faced. “Pack up girls, we’re going home. Molly has been informed, and we’ve got a portkey leaving in twenty minutes.
“Harry Potter!” Dumbledore’s concerned voice came from right next to him. The blonde boy looked up at him, both scared and confused. With a kind look, Dumbledore motioned him to get up. “Harry, please make your way to the side chamber with the other champions.”
The little bird certainly seemed to have heard him, for it zoomed straight into Harry’s chest and fell to the ground, fluttering madly and looking slightly concussed. Harry took advantage of the poor bird’s unfortunate state by reaching down and relieving it of its burden, then quickly putting it into Hedwig’s empty cage. Shaking his head in disbelief at the poor creature, Harry looked at the letter and saw it was from his friend, Ron Weasley.
After the camp was set up, Harry was pulled into the smaller tent (reserved for the girls and Harry). He and Hermione had marvelled at how much space they had (and made the requisite Dr. Who jokes about it being bigger on the inside); there was enough room for each of them to have an actual bed, not just a cot, and attached to the main area of the tent was a bathroom with what seemed like magical plumbing.
After the impromptu imitation of a shower, Harry heard a collective male roar of approval as a line of ten shockingly beautiful women strode out wearing what seemed to be belly dancing outfits. Then, a heavy, percussive beat started up. The women, all blonde in the same way Draco (and Harry) were, began gyrating and making small, graceful movements with their feet and arms. Tambourines, woodwinds, and string instruments Harry could name joined the tune and he was mystified by the dance. He felt a strangely familiar pull inside himself that resonated with the beat. But interestingly, when Harry looked around to see everyone else’s reaction, most of the men in the entire arena were near mobbing the security wizards trying to get to the field, or else posturing in a ridiculous manner.
The boy turned his attention downward to take stock of his new features, and blanched slightly at the breasts he could clearly see protruding from his front. His shirt was uncomfortably tight across the chest, probably due to the aforementioned breasts. A little movement of the thighs and a wiggle of his bum demonstrated that his… well, he’d definitely turned into a girl.
As the minutes turned into an hour, then two, she could feel him getting the hang of taking the Allure in hand. Now, it was time to control it.
Harry’s hands were cradling his face. They’d gotten the hated bra on him and adjusted his shirt to drape over his chest nicely, even if it was still a bit tight. On their way to lunch, Hermione leaned in to whisper in Harry’s ear. “You know, if Draco were around today, he’d have had kittens. The boys were fairly
the chores for the rest of the week I’m here. They want to come pick me up on Saturday.” Harry waited with bated breath for his uncle’s verdict.
“S’cuse me Mrs. Weasly.” Harry said nervously. He had an audience, after all. “What happened at the campground last night?”
The venue in question loomed above them, all golden walls and extravagant architecture. Its size was such that Harry was sure it could fit about the Dursley home inside it about a hundred times. The plus side of this was that his friends and he were already within its shadow, and it blocked out the sun on the horizon, making it much easier to see.
"Well, Potter,” Draco bit out through gritted teeth. “Seems like we’re stuck here. Try not to make things worse.”
Lucius Malfoy, on the other hand, narrowed his eyes thoughtfully and smirked a bit, thinking about how he’d never seen his dragon interact so freely with a female peer. He’d have to put feelers out to this Devereaux family to see if they would be amenable to a betrothal in the future. If not, he would need to subtly push his boy away from the girl. Lucius sighed and chuckled a little, thinking he was getting ahead of himself.
As his uncle made his way through the kitchen and out the door, Harry stood in the living room motionlessly, thunderstruck at the concept that all he’d needed to get through to his uncle was to talk about sports of all things.
Deciding to spend the day practicing instead of wandering, Harry headed back to the tent and crossed his legs on his bed. Reaching toward his link to his (what he was beginning to suspect was a humanoid) animagus form, Harry let go and tried for any further changes.He passed the morning and afternoon in this fashion, but only felt a slight tingling in his abdomen for his efforts, which he ascribed to being hungry again.
Harry went over to the ground floor bathroom and did as he was told, then came back to enjoy the breakfast provided. The majority of the breakfast conversation was about the quidditch match, but Hermione and Ginny had pulled Harry into a little huddle at one end of the table to discuss things that were more interesting. (Draco Malfoy, primarily) It seemed like breakfast was finally winding down when Harry spoke up to the family matriarch.
“Freak!” His uncle Vernon yelled from the living room. “Get your damn ruddy bird under control before I wring it's bloody neck!” At this threat, Harry sprinted up the stairs to see what was wrong with his familiar.
Harry’s heart leapt into his throat, and a chill went down his back at the implication. Was it possible he could be… No. Nobody would assault him. He knew how to defend himself, and he refused to allow that to happen in the first place. Even if something like that should happen, Harry was fast, and he was a slippery little thing. Those skills had been honed for years from constant games of Harry Hunting, and he had no reason to believe this would be any different. Just because he was in a girl’s body, didn’t mean he was weaker.
It was like only the Weasleys and a couple of other families had taken the time to learn how muggles actually dressed. This felt absurd to Harry, seeing as Ron was fourteen years old and capable of blending in better than almost any of the adults in the clearing. Asking Mr. Weasley about the sheer variety of fashion earned him an explanation that wizards were largely ignorant of muggle dress codes, and that this was about as good as he’d ever seen it with such a large gathering of people.
“Harry,” Ginny wondered aloud while running her hands around his hips and the sides of his chest area, which had gained a little fat and was very sensitive. “You
Vernon’s eyes bulged in disbelief, then strange enough, narrowed in interest. “Hmm. Enjoy this sport much, do you?”
Another fifteen minutes of walking, they had reached their destination. A decently sized spot, big enough to fit two small tents. Mr. Weasley wrangled the children into setting up his borrowed tents ‘the muggle way’. The elder Weasley tried to help, but it ended up being Harry and Hermione that figured out the entire process.
The morning passed in a blur. Transfiguration, then Defense were on the schedule today, and he only remembered little flashes of classes. He must have done pretty badly, because he recalled being dressed down for his appearance and demeanor, then a minor bit of pain that had temporarily gotten his attention. He came back to himself once Hermione shook him into awareness in a room he felt like he recognized but was too tired to place.
The only real downer of the bunch was Percy. When Charlie had arrived, he and Bill had proceeded to have an epic table battle in the backyard one night before dinner, and right after Bill’s table had smashed Charlie’s to pieces (amid the cheering of those underage children watching), Percy had poked his head out of his window to rain on their parade.
Amos held his watch up and counted down. “5...4...3...2...1…” When Cedric’s father reached zero, the old boot glowed blue, and Harry felt the hook feeling behind his navel again, before being swept away into a maelstrom of blurred and distorted images.
“Uh, it had to do with a mandrake leaf and some meditation.” Harry said slowly, trying to sound forgetful. “I can’t remember well because I did most of it a while ago.” This was a blatant lie.
He’d dozed for a couple hours when he heard the portrait hole open. Harry snapped back to awareness, hoping the person coming through would be uninclined to ask questions. He levered himself to his feet as the shadow became a person, and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw it was Hermione.
“As this month’s gone on, you’ve been getting progressively more girlish,” Hermione pointed out, continuing her visual analysis.
The blonde boy took his hair down from its ponytail and ran a hand through it, cherishing the relief something so simple could provide. He then began the tale of how he’d come to build the fantasy in his head that he was on a date with a boy he liked, and that it wasn’t necessarily Malfoy that it had to be. He did, however, admit to thinking Draco was very kissable. This caused squeals of delight to burst forth from Ginny, and earned him a fond look from Hermione.
The entry continued with the Marauder’s sniping back and forth at each other in the third person, which had Harry cracking up silently.
“Well, it’s a bit like a cross between dodgeball and footie.” Harry mused. There was no need to explain the snitch to his uncle. He wouldn’t get it anyway, the boy thought. “Granted, it’s played two hundred or so feet in the air.”
As Harry landed, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of voices nattering at each other. Alongside the sickness of using a portkey, and dealing with trying to hear anything through the background noise, the boy hardly heard anything about where they were to set up camp before he was led away from the portkey arrival area by Hermione. It was only after about five minutes of walking that Harry was able to truly appreciate what was going on here. It was like a huge festival.
of them!” Harry jabbed Ron in the side, causing the boy to yelp in response, and shot him a heated look, warning him about making any sort of comment.
Ten minutes of awkward silence between the two passed before he heard Malfoy whisper, “Potter, what the hell are you playing at?”
Harry didn’t talk to Hermione for the rest of the trip, partly because he was too red to speak, but mostly because the brown haired girl was too busy laughing at her best friend’s face.
Harry smiled at his godfather’s letter, shaking his head at Sirius’ way of writing. He seemed like a teenager himself.
He thought excitedly. If he didn’t have to buy a book, Vernon was sure to be happy. Harry lunged up the stairs, dove into his trunk, and victoriously pulled out ‘Quidditch Through the Ages’ from the sea of loose clothing and school supplies.
“Gently, Harry.” She said soothingly. “Do not grasp, cradle. Treat it like a fragile glass sculpture. It is a part of you. Treat it gently. It is not an enemy.”
“Shhh…” Fleur said, running her hand along the top of Harry’s head, trying to comfort him. “Do not worry. I will help you through this.”
All too soon, it was September 1, and Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron were seated on the Hogwarts Express. They were waving at the Weasley parents when a letter dropped into Harry’s hand. He looked at the envelope, hoping to see who it was from, and wondering why he'd gotten it on the train.
The elderly man took his wand out and swished it through the air. Harry felt the warm feeling he got when he changed forms sear through his body, and would have hollered in pain, but the sensation lasted for too short a time. Luckily, the boy was distracted by the fact he was in his normal, non-veela form again.
“Because Harry,” Ginny shot back in a snotty tone. “it’s hot as hell in this room with three people, and it’s not even like...” The redheaded girl trailed off, looking thoughtfully at Harry before walking over.
On August 24, Harry was woken up gently by Hermione at a truly ungodly hour. It couldn’t have been later than 3 in the morning when Harry and Ginny were both dragged yawning down to the kitchen for an early breakfast. Harry didn’t even get up this early for his runs. Thankfully, they didn’t have to wait long before all the boys trooped downstairs and the mood started to pick up. It was the day before the World Cup, and they’d be leaving soon to take a portkey to the location of the arena campgrounds.
The last week at the Weasleys was bittersweet. Harry had finally managed to make some noticeable changes. His hair had grown down to his mid-back, and his body seemed to grow more petite as the days went by. On August 30, the problem had gotten so bad he’d had to ask Mrs. Weasley to go shopping at Diagon for another new set of school clothes and to go into muggle London to get new everyday clothes. It had gotten to the point where he had to wear clothes from the girl’s section of the stores.
She continued for a good minute more, then she was able to calm herself. After her laughter died down to the occasional giggle, Fleur wiped a tear from her eye.
“Ughh… Madam Pomfrey, really? A bra?” He asked, grimacing. “Professor Dumbledore is probably just gonna turn me right back, not like I’m going to need it.”
The budding wizard’s smile was wiped off his face when he realized he would have to ask his uncle for permission to stay over at the Weasleys.
The one thing that most everyone seemed to have in common, however, was a fascination with Harry. It looked like no one recognized him, but he was nonetheless fawned over by the greater majority of men in his general vicinity. There was even one brave teen that blushingly asked if Harry needed an escort around the area. Harry had blinked a couple times in confusion before shaking his head, declining politely, and letting himself be pulled along after Hermione.
Harry thought to himself, his face heating again at how close his rival had moved his chair so they could talk over the background noise. Their laughing and general demeanor was the source of astounded looks from Hermione, Ginny, and the twins. Ronald was too enamoured by the game to pay attention.
Harry tore his eyes away from the field and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting near the end of the row behind them. The creature was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were very, very familiar. A vague phantom pain in his arm caused Harry to snap out of his reverie..
That was something draco had discovered, actually. A few weeks into living with Harry, he could feel what his Alpha felt, emotionally, just from touching him. And aside from whatever Harry was feeling in the moment, there was always the feeling of pure love somewhere in the background. It would get stronger by the day. Sometimes it was so strong, that’s all Draco could feel come from his mate.
“Robards was still emptying it out, if I recall. He retired last week; the Minister wanted to take his time looking for a good replacement before he just threw anyone in there to take over.” Harry said.
He was just going to skip out on it and find something else to do to pass the time, but then he really thought about it. They were going to be there, on a private beach, for a month, and just because he didn’t bring any trunks, he was expected to not go swimming the whole time they were going to be there? The only other person that could see him was Draco, and from what Harry could guess, he was off brooding by himself.
“No, we aren’t.” Draco concluded. “Are you in pain right now? No, so stop your whining.” Draco said affectionately.
“Sleep, you mean. Because if you think anything else will happen, you’re poorly mistaken.” Harry said, shrugging the frail body off of his. He gathered his things and waited by the dorm entrance for the nuisance.
Harry broke out into laughter at the cuteness of the sneeze and Draco turned to glare at him. “It's not funny, Harry.”
As he pushed himself off the bed and onto his shaky legs, he wondered if Harry was asleep or still in his study. Not wanting to bother Harry either way, he tiptoed again over to the library at the other end of the hall. He pushed the doors open and switched on the light. The room was brighter, the shelves shined, and the trinkets twinkled. From the looks of it, Kreacher actually did a wonderful job. He stepped in and did a once-over the room before finding himself in front of the poetry section. Draco loved poetry. He knew he was excited to come across it in this library. He grabbed a random book off the shelf and started flipping through it. He landed on a random page and began reading the small poem he'd found.
“Yeah, that’s all I want.” Harry said, shutting Draco down before he could plan a massive gathering that would be completely too big for his enjoyment.
Harry addressed them all when they arrived, saying that yes he and Draco were together and that they liked each other both very much, and that if anyone had a problem with it, they could return through the door they had entered from. No on left, but they were still surprised how it all happened.
Harry’s smile faded and he looked away from draco’s face. “Yeah, about that. I wasn’t feeling myself then I was just tired and upset from everything that had happened. I’m sorry I said those things. I don’t feel or believe them. Trust me, please.”
Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s hand and pulled his attention towards himself. “We’ve been over this, love. I don’t love you because the prophecy said to, alright?” Harry looked at him so sincerely.
Harry sighed deeply. “I took a walk after my meeting with the Minister, grabbed a bite, and sat outside for a bit. I just wanted some time for myself.”
They finished dinner without any more mishaps. Harry got a parchment from McGonagall stating their new schedule, and their living arrangements.
He slowly stretched him with one, two, three fingers, lubing him up with a spell and pressing in gently, all the while whispering how amazing and beautiful he was underneath him.
He immediately stood, making his way out of the stands to where Draco sat. A few feet away, their eye contact was broken as a throat cleared, and they were brought back to reality in an empty courtroom, save for Kingsley who stood in front of Draco, and a few aurors who were also close by. Their attention snapped towards the Minister as he addressed Draco.
Draco removed his lips from the tan skin before replying with a simple “You.” And he rolled his hips, pressing their groins closer together.
Now, however, Malfoy was here, and tormenting Harry he was. Well, not tormenting, necessarily, more so annoying him.
He ripped off his jacket, suddenly his skin feeling hot and prickly, and started undoing the buttons of his shirt as he was sure that’s what has causing him to suffocate. But nothing seamed to work. He began pulling at his hair because his body failed at trying desperately to get air to fill his aching lungs, when a pair of strong arms wrapped around his torso, supporting his buckling knees and bringing his body back to the present. The stuttering thumping of his heart beat slowly faded out as worry-stricken voices took its place, trying to get his attention.
Harry grabbed a towel and rubbed the batter off his face. He sighed as he stood. Instead of bothering the house-elf, he took out a wand and with a flick of his wrist, the kitchen was putting itself back in order. He then dragged himself up the stairs and shut himself in his study once again. He needed to think things over.
“Hmm, hi Harry.” He smiled back, nuzzling deeper into the warmth and comfort that constantly radiated off of the raven.
Draco looked at him the way he did the first week, when they discovered they were mates: nervous, but wanting.
“Anything to get your hands on me,” Malfoy’s smirk stayed firmly in place. His eyes were positively gleaming at Harry. He wanted to vomit.
“Fuck,” Harry groaned. It was the most euphoric feeling, having his dick touch another one, while they’re both naked and hard as rocks.
He got a table and ordered a firewhiskey while waiting for his best friend. When Ron came, they greeted with a hug then started chatting about everything: Ron’s training, Harry’s work, Hermione’s apprenticeship, Ron and Hermione’s relationship, and finally Draco.
“Harry!” He cried. “Harry I'm sick. I'm so sick.” Draco let the tears flow free. His time of trying to avoid acknowledging this cold that had taken over his body had come to an end in his Harry’s arms.
However many minutes later, they pulled apart looking deep into each other’s eyes, breathless and hotter than any other time they made out. That’s when he did it, the little snake.
Harry was petting Draco’s head when he spoke from within Harry’s chest where his head was currently residing for warmth.
Harry joined them in the living room, a dish towel drying his hands. “Hiya guys, how are you doing?” he asked, greeting Ron with a brotherly handshake and Hermione with a hug. “How are your parents doing?”
“Are you mental?” Ron quipped. “First, that slimy git doesn’t need our help, and second, do you really think he’d do the same for us?”
Draco was then approached by a man who said he was scheduled to shuttle them to their private resort. Once the bags were packed again and Harry and Draco got into the van, they were driven down a long stretch of road for about half an hour. When they stopped and were given directions as to how to walk to their private little palace, they grabbed their bags and walked two minutes down the beach to a boardwalk. This boardwalk, lined up and down the sides with tiny candles, led to a beautiful, large bungalow out in the middle of the water. It was maybe 100 yards from shore, with no other residency in sight, giving them enough privacy for the whole month they’d be spending there.
Draco didn’t want to be someone Harry hated. Draco wanted to be Harry’s crush. Draco wanted  the golden boy to be his boy. Draco wanted to be loved, too.
Harry gasped and pulled Draco's face up to his own. He searched the stormy grey eyes for any signs of illness but all he found was irritation.
Draco took a deep breath and ran a shaking hand through his hair. "I'm fine. I was going to tell you that - that I kind of like it in here. I had Kreacher tidy it up a bit, I hope that's ok. I don't have to be in here. I can find somewhere else to-" his rambling was cut short as Harry continued walking towards him and gently grasped Draco's hand in his.
He knew about his budding sexuality- in that he wasn’t straight. Since his close friendship with Cedric from two years prior, he knew that boys always interested him. But he also knew he didn’t like Malfoy, what he did, how he acted, or even who he was.
“The particular strand of spell you cast affected his mental state, because of its weakened state in that moment. The magic associated with the type of spell ‘feeds’ off of whatever is affected the most during that moment, hindering it and damaging it.” Madame Pomfrey explained what Snape had told her. They all found out that it was his spell, because he aided in the medi-witches attempts to help the young Malfoy.
Flour, blows, eggs, sugar and cook books littered every surface. Harry saw Draco on his tiptoes in front of a cupboard trying to reach a hand mixer.
So, Draco started wandering around the house he so vaguely remembered from when he was young. He found his way to the second floor where he could hear muffled voices coming from one of the two double-doored rooms on the floor. He thought about going to his room and maybe taking a nap, but his curiosity got the better of him. Excitement filled him like a little child on Christmas morning as he tiptoed past Harry's study, over to what he was told was the library. He expected it to be locked, the way that Harry didn't seem to want to show it to him earlier. He gently grabbed the handle and turned it-
As they were walking to the Floos, hand in hand, Draco stopped. “You mean to tell me that you had a private office all to your own and you took me to an abandoned conference room to fuck me?”
“I’ve never done anything with anyone, except a very uncomfortable kiss with Cho Chang and a few with Ginny. Nothing huge.” Harry could tell his mate was getting restless, probably nerves, he thought.
He sighed and walked over to the poetry section. He pulled off a few random books and put them on the table in the middle of the chairs. After a moment's hesitation, he moved over to the wizarding section and found some books on magical creatures. He didn’t know much about his inheritance, just that it came from his mother’s side. Her family had a long line of Omega genes, but the effect of the traits had decreased over the years, making the inheritance skip multiple generations. Draco was the first Omega to manifest in over 7 generations.
“Hermione.” Harry breathed a sigh of relief. “You're here early, is everything alright? I thought you were coming over after work?”
As the trio made their way to where the ceremony was to be held, Harry wondering what really awaited his future from that moment on.
The intense feeling of Harry coming around his cock, ripped Draco’s orgasm from him, shooting deep within his husband.
He was positive he didn’t put that on himself. He wasn’t thinking about what he was doing when he left. Then he realized it was only him and Harry staying on this private side of the beach.
Back in the common room, Harry had all of 30 seconds before the portrait slammed open and Sanpe bellowed his name.
“Draco!” she said, running towards him. “I-I think I figured it out.” she was out of breath by the time she caught up to him.
Draco finally lifted his head and stared at Harry as he made his speech, mouth gaping slightly at the words that exited from the raven-haired boy's mouth.
“Mr Potter! Good to see you again.” Kingsely’s secretary, Sarah, her name was apparently, greeted him.
Harry shook his head. “That's not necessary. You can stay. And you can come in whenever you like. I noticed that you haven’t really been in here before today, but you live here too now. And I spend most of my time in here so I’d like for you to keep me company.” Harry smiled, untying the letter from the owl’s leg and grabbing a quill from nearby.
I cried while writing this. Please give me credit for my hurting heart. Also, happy birthday to my lovely Draco.
Dried, dressed in pyjamas, and snuggled up against his blond, hot cocoa in hand, Harry turned on Netflix, and began flipping through the different options.
“On another note” Walkins started up again, “if the pain gets to be too much to handle at times, seeing as it’s not always possible for you two to be within direct contact of each other forever, I can prescribe a pain potion to help numb the affects, if that's what you desire.” She looked more to Harry than Draco, now knowing he’s the only one who’d most likely require said potion.
Warm, wet hands ran over his skin, most likely massaging his sore muscles. He opened his eyes to find himself in bed, Harry standing over top of him.
Harry sighed. “I don't know, but I do know that your scent drives me insane and I can't…” He faded out, really questioning if he should risk it.
Draco glanced at the food and slowly approached the table. He carefully sat down on the bench and slowly picked up his fork. With that he dug into his meal, pristine and proper, unlike the messy Griffyndor across from him.
Harry was panting raggedly, lust and power overtaking his whole being. Within seconds, the room thrummed with his magic, Draco could feel it pulsing through the air towards him.
Any other time in his whole life of knowing Draco Malfoy, Harry would’ve always expected the look in those steel-grey to be filled with hate and disgust, whenever directed at him. This time, however, the emotions that the glowing-like orbs held was what someone would describe as awestruck. With lips parted and a slight up-pull of one of the corners, Draco was smiling.
“Hello.” She said in a cheery voice Draco hadn’t heard come from her before, let alone directed at him.
Harry watched as Draco undressed to change. He was feeling himself stir, as they’d gone a few days without being intimate, and Harry was feeling the effects of it.
Harry studied him deeply for a minute, taking in his unadulterated beauty. Something he’d never get tired of. He did this until Draco started fidgeting under the intense stare. “About what you said this morning…” Harry started.
As Harry toed off his shoes, Draco slyly went behind him, wrapped his arms around him, and leaned down to kiss at his neck.
Draco read and Harry responded to whatever letter was sent to him. After sending it off again, he sat back and stared at the blond beauty in front of him.
“Don’t misbehave today. For me, please.” He added at the look on Draco’s face. “Kingsley was nice enough to give you this job, please respect him and your co-workers.” Harry asked.
“Ah, well, it was just a little bit of research I’d done. I am familiar with their case and the prophecy, so I thought I’d look into it.” she said shyly.
As he walked up the boardwalk, he saw Harry sitting, with his legs dangling over the edge, looking down into the water. When he approached him, Harry gestured for him to stop.
Draco froze. Harry would never forgive him if he actually told Harry that he liked him. No. He would never.
“How I know you're and Omega?” Draco just shook his head, not trusting his voice. He thought it was something to do with scents, like he'd read in the book, but Harry seemed to know more about this than he did, so he let him explain. “I can smell you. Something like spearmint, soap and I think sugar but I'm not sure.” Harry paused and watched Draco’s unchanging expression for a moment. “There's this thing I can do, being an Alpha and all. Basically I can block out your smell, which in turn blocks out your emotions, which would normally translate into your scent. I can't smell you right now, because I'd probably be all over you if I could. It's quite addicting actually.”
“Er, yes. Afterwords, she seemed to fall out of some sort of trance, and acted as if nothing happened. I doubt you’ll get much from her, but I am very curious about what this all means.”
How could he be so stupid? Of course Harry didn’t love him, of course he never would. All the time Harry spent with him, that was just the prophecy making him. All those things they said at the end of their honeymoon… it was all a lie. Harry would never voluntarily say those things, especially to Draco. Draco truly loved Harry, that’s probably why he never felt all the pain Harry claimed to feel.
He preferred to mix his own colour, like the actual pigments. With a little help from magic, obviously. He loved being creative with different shades. But his favourite was highlights. He could highlight like it was no one’s business (except for his).
Draco stared wide eyed at him the whole time he spoke. When he was finished, Draco stiffly nodded his head. They stared at each other for another moment, the all-encompassing grey affecting Harry more than he’d like to admit.
And to make it worse, he brought the unmated, newly manifested Omega into his home. It's like putting a chocolate bar in front of a kid and telling them not to eat it.
Draco nodded and then followed Harry out of the kitchen and up to his study. Once in, he was able to get a good look around him. A beige colour filled the walls with dark red accents all around the room. A large fireplace with a mantle covered in photos faced the door and the scent of oak wood flooded his senses. It was purely Harry and very Gryffindorish.
“I don’t know what I’m going to do, Dray. What if I do have to take the potion everyday because the pain gets to be too much?”
Walkins nodded, sitting in the chair beside Hermione. “Yes, that sounds possible.” Hermione smiled at the confirmation.
"Like I said, he just got up and left, ‘Mione." Harry said as he Floo called his best friend. "He even told me he was scared yesterday. Something's not right."
Malfoy lay on the bed, unconscious. Harry listened carefully to what the medi-witch had to say, as he stared intently at the blond.
Draco was on the verge of orgasm, so he rolled up his hips, having Harry slip in even deeper. He reached down and stroked his cock as he rolled up at every thrust of Harry’s, his arse meeting Harry’s hips half way, the slapping of skin, quiet moans, and heavy breathing filling the empty conference room.
“Yes, well you’re to deliver memos and letters to those along a specific route depending on which part of the ministry you’re positioned in. Unless you’re put on sorting, then you’d sort the mail into which route it goes.” She smiled. Draco was starting to wonder how many of those she has to fake in a day.
Harry’s eyes widened as the realization dawned on him. “You seriously don’t think... it could not be .... MALFOY?!” He sat there, mouth gaping and brows furrowed.
He quickly glanced down to see the blond smiling. He immediately broke out into a grin. "No, I like cooking. How about we do every other meal?" He asked, looking up into Harry's eyes.
Harry chuckled. “Because it’s a work day and you wouldn’t miss one even if old Voldy came back.” Then Harry regarded him seriously. “I thought it might be something serious. Thought I’d try to get it out of you. Glad I did too.” Harry’s lip curled up at the end.
“No. What do you need to talk to him about? And how did you get in here? You don’t work in the ministry.”
Minutes later, Harry’s mind was still reeling. Everything just happened so fast (as it usually did with them). He asked Draco “What was that?”
Draco distracted Harry thoroughly with many kisses and many touches as he slowly inserted himself into his husband.
Harry just wrapped his arms tightly around him and petted his hair slowly, shushing the blond before quietly saying, “I know sweetheart. I know…”
“Fine.” Draco gritted. He was tired enough as it is and didn’t need Harry’s stubborn arse irritating him any further. “Go sleep on the couch, then.” He rolled over and turned the bedside lamp off.
Ron was still shocked from the polite Draco Malfoy he just witnessed, and the fact that him and his best mate were going to become roommates. Hermione quickly spoke up for both of them, seeing as Ron was incapable at the moment. "Oh no, Harry. We'll be off back to the Burrow. Floo call or owl us when you get the chance." And with that, she grabbed Ron's arm and dragged him away.
Draco glided by the bookshelves and quickly peered at the different types of books Harry had. Everything from muggle books like novels, to poems, to literature, to wizarding books, spell books, centuries old to ones he recognized from Hogwarts, to defensive magic, and a small section of dark magic. He softly snorted to himself as he realized they probably came from the original owners of the estate, the Blacks, and the only reason they were still here was emergency purposes. At least that's what he wanted to believe. He found himself back at the doors so he turned fully around, taking in all his surroundings at once and realized that this was his favourite place in the whole house. He moved back to the furniture and slowly started folding the sheets in on themselves, carefully trying not to disturb the dust that lay on top. He removed all the sheets and grabbed the pile before taking it down to the basement where Harry told him it's where they do the laundry. He threw them in an empty basket before making his way to the kitchen. He found Kreacher wiping down the counter and grimaced at the sight of the wrinkly house-elf. "Kreacher, would you mind following me?" He gestured back out the kitchen door and started back up the stairs before he heard the elf mumble something behind him about his love for purebloods and that he lives to serve the noble House of Black, or something or other. They made their way back to the library and Draco closed the door behind them, not wanting to disturb Harry. "Ok, I'm staying here for a while and I'd like a place for myself. This is actually a decent home-library, but it needs a little cleaning up. I trust you know what to do." And with that, he walked out and let the house-elf do its duty.
They were silent for a minute, Harry waiting for Draco to continue with what was so clearly bothering him, and Draco silently praying Harry would drop it.
Draco stopped pacing the kitchen and turned to Harry. “And I won’t be. This is utter idiocy. I am not about to give in to this societal standard that one must work for a larger corporation to obtain value and wealth. No sir.” He finished with an upturned nose.
Walkins had been filled in by the research Hermione had done, her having the same in-depth information told to her as Hermione had done for Harry and Draco.
“Draco, can I steal Harry for a moment? I want to show him a new project I’ve been working on.” Ron asked.
The little Omega bit his lip and closed his eyes. He reached up and held Harry's hand in his own, so it was trapped between his cheek and hand.
Eventually, Harry grabbed Draco’s hips and pulled him onto his lap. He snogged him senseless. Draco pulled away, sputtering as Harry tried to kiss him more.
Draco looked up from his vacant station to see who had walked in. He didn't expect to see his school-rival from Hogwarts, standing in the middle of his shop, looking slightly lost.
Well, he kind of listened. Sure, Harry went down to the kitchen and found Draco there. Sure, he stayed and they talked a little and threw brownie batter at each other. And yes, Harry admitted the one thing that he couldn’t get out of his head, but Draco kissed him. And yeah he returned the kiss, but Draco made the first move...then he left. Again.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes. He was clearly mentally debating whether or not to tell Draco, but Draco just continued to stare at him. He finally gave in. “It’s to help me sleep.” He murmured, but Draco heard him cause he strained his ears too.
When the couple had arrived to their honeymoon destination, they both felt the assault of hot and humid air as they stepped off the plane. They both looked around at the beautifully starry sky, and the palm trees that littered every few feet from the short runway they had landed on.
His nose was stuffy and his body ached. But he wasn't sick. He couldn't be. Malfoy's don't get sick… right?
Diana, a recent recruit of his team, gladly took on the next appointment. Draco, in the meantime, tidied his station, returned some cash to the receptionists desk, then wiped his hands clean on a towel as he made his way to Potter.
“I’ll say it everyday if you want me too. I don’t think it’ll ever lose its meaning.” Harry replied.
Harry and Malfoy stayed at the back of the classroom, lest he get fussy and start causing a ruckus, getting them more in trouble than Harry felt them already in. All other students, which weren’t many, were near the front of the classroom. Harry had taken this class strictly because he needed it if he were to become a healer. He presumed, based on the few other students who had taken the class as well, were in the same boat as him. The student demographic looked to be mostly made up of Ravenclaws and Slytherins.
“Nothing you wouldn’t have shown me, don’t worry. I only caught a glimpse of you outside, I didn’t watch you as you swam butt-arse naked in the Caribbean.” He said, chewing his salmon between his pearly whites.
As he made his way to Dumbledore’s office, he tried to remember everything Trelawney had said to him so he could tell his headmaster what happened as accurately as possible.
“Oh come on, Ron. If you can’t stop Seamus from casting, maybe I should take yours away as well.” She threatened. He backed off.
He tailored to all sorts of styles, but was a king with colour. Literally. His clients named him ‘the King of Colour’™️.
And for how often she gossiped, you’d think she couldn’t keep a secret. That’s the thing, the girl could definitely keep a secret when she wanted to. So, Draco trusted her. She did keep the secret that he was gay from their third year when he found out, until he decided to come out in their eighth year.
He hadn’t realized how lonely he’d gotten. After the war, Ginny and him decided to end things, simply because he had to find his mate (who, he realized after many failed attempts to reassure himself, wasn’t the redhead). Also Ginny was leaving London to travel with her professional Quidditch team she’d joined. Harry was truly happy for her, and felt bad that he didn’t reciprocate the feelings she strongly had for him. The best thing was to let her go, but that didn’t mean he didn’t need anyone. That’s where Draco came in and, although flipped his whole world around, brought him joy he hadn’t quite experienced before in his 18 years.
“What do you think it all means?” He asked Ron and Hermione after he told them all he could remember from what the proffessor had revealed to him.
“Oh, because the ‘Great Harry Potter’ is just so widely praised upon, that any request he makes be fulfilled with nothing but the best there is to offer? What, you would demand Kingsley give me his job or you would refuse to be his gofer, running around, filling out forms and signing off agreements? Because that’s such a hard job, right? Oh no, Potter is one step below the Minister! Why don’t we just make him one then! Why don’t we just appoint Potter as the new Minister-”
“Enough, both of you.” Harry demanded. Everyone turned to look at him. “What do you want from me, Malfoy?”
Draco sighed and lay down on the couch. He didn’t want to think anymore. It had been a stressful morning.
He stood in the gents, sobbing his heart out. Ron stood by the door in case anyone tried to come in, as Hermione ran soothing circles down his back.
Although he did say he was going to try to be better with Draco, Draco knew that it wasn’t Harry’s idea, nor was he really willing to do it. He did it because his friends asked him to, not because he wanted Draco. Not like how Draco wanted him to.
Once in the hospital wing, Hermione and McGonagall stayed in the background, shyly observing the administrations Madame Pomfrey was applying to Malfoy. Snape had arrived too, and was beside the medi-witch, listening to the information McGonagall and Hermione had told her.
When Harry woke up to a cold bed, he sat up immediately and searched the room for his mate. “Draco?” he called. That’s when the initial fog of sleep lifted, and he heard the water running from the shower, the bathroom connecting to their bedroom.
Draco walked over to the cupboard and pulled out two mugs before filling them and handing one to Harry. He sat down at the table and blew in his tea before carefully taking a sip.
That didn’t stop Draco though. He rolled right on top of Harry and started grinding down hard, over and over and over.
The positively uncouth behaviour of Potter had been shoved out of his mind, as if it was just another encounter with an unwanted pervert grinding up on him in the club.
Harry just chuckled and said “It's not something that's prophesied or written in the stars. We do have a little say in who we fall for. It all has to do with scents and what we're attracted to.”
As Draco stepped out of the shower and started drying himself, he sighed as he remembered he didn’t have clothes to change into. After his and Harry’s little food fight, his only casual outfit got covered in brownie batter. He inwardly scolded himself for kissing the raven-haired boy, and for no reason. Once he stepped under the scolding water, he willed himself not to think about it. Now, he was without clothes and really didn’t want to ask Harry for more. So, towel wrapped around waist, he quickly moved to his room and threw on his pyjamas.
Harry was frustrated. He’d done the interview for The Daily Prophet a month before, and they were still getting news articles with their relationship plastered on the front page. He’d tried to tell them that they had gotten over their history and overcome their differences, and that they were happy. But no one wants happy. They only want lies to feed their gossip.
“That’s bold, seeing as you want me to fall in love with you the second you reveal your feelings to me.”
“-and I came across some really interesting information. Now, I would like a second opinion, but the whole thing makes sense, albeit a bit dramatic. So, after what Draco told me yesterday, what you guys were talking about when you had the seizure, it makes sense as to why the ‘seizure’ occurred.” she had put air quotes around the word ‘seizure’.
Loosening him up and open with an equal assault of his tongue and fingers, Harry was eventually able to sit up and lube up his hard and leaking prick, ready to fuck the precious creature in front of him.
Harry guessed it must've been an hour or two later when Kingsley announced it was time for a ruling.
“NOT for your USE!” Snape growled. His face coming right up to Harry’s. “You don’t realize the repercussions that using that spell could of had. How did you get it, anyways?”
“They’re right, you know.” Draco said, examining and picking at his nails like the rich prick Harry remembered him to be. At the slightly confused look, Draco continued. “You need a hobby. A job, Quidditch, an activity to keep you focused on something important. I can take care of myself. I am a grown man, after all.” He retorted Hermione’s words. “You need to focus on yourself, rather than wasting your life away in this shack,” he looked straight at Harry then, with an annoyed or angry expression (Harry couldn’t tell), “with me.”
A great break from the madness of the Burrow came in the form of a trip to Diagon alley. Mrs. Weasley got Harry fitted for dress robes for some unnamed event that was coming later in the year. Harry vetoed the idea of a bottle-green robe, and replaced it with one in a rich purple with a similarly colored button-up and a black vest and tie. He thought there would be far too much green with the ones the Weasley matriarch had selected.
“Sit up straight!” Fleur reprimanded. “A lady does not slouch!” Harry rolled his eyes, then dodged another slap for his trouble.
Harry shrugged. “I mean, it’s not like it’s something I’m gonna have to deal with forever, right? All I have to do is figure out how to turn back, and it’ll be fine.”
Harry, used to Ginny’s oddly dirty humor (if not the topic of conversation), met her gaze, and said “No, Ginny, I have not ‘taken a look at the goods’. I only finished the transformation last night.” Harry blinked a couple times, then looked at Hermione curiously.
“RON!” he yelled, careless of the stopped conversations around them, and the searing gaze of Draco Malfoy from across the room. “I swear to God, the next time you look at my chest like that, you’re getting a face full of pumpkin juice!”
Draco looked a little abashed at that last example, but took a moment to wrap his head around the idea Harry had put out there. “Huh,” he grunted out. “Yeah, there’s no real better way to phrase that, is there?”
The youngest Weasley huffed, and playfully glared at Harry from her place on the floor. She then stuck her tongue out with a cheeky grin.
At either end of the field stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry's eye level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as though a huge hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again. The wide-eyed boy couldn’t help but ignore the ads though, in favor of taking in the whole stadium again. He’d never seen so many people in one place together before.
Petunia went red at the mention of her sister, and Dudley looked at Harry disbelievingly. “Yes, Vernon dear, she did. I never really paid much attention to the thing though. It seemed to be a… their sort type of thing.” Harry, seeing his relatives talk even passively to each other about the magical world, was astonished, and had stopped eating with just a bit of veg on his plate.
mean all colors. There was a man passing by with neon green skin and sunny yellow hair, next to the darkest man the young wizard had ever seen. The clothing was almost all muggle, and very interesting, but definitely odd. It seemed like someone dove into a closet and assigned articles of clothing at random.
Harry was able to hold the (de?)transformation for thirty seconds before he suddenly popped back to ‘Lauren’. That was insane progress on his part, so he would take what he could get.
After breakfast, Harry puttered around for a half hour, then grabbed his clothes, took a shower, changed into some of his new, properly fitted muggle clothes. He then packed his bag with clothes for the next day and some pocket money for souvenirs,and once ready, the fourteen year old checked in on Hermione and Ginny.
Ignoring other students was second nature by now, and without too much delay, Harry had made his way up to the owlery. A few moments after that, Hedwig was winging her way to her mystery destination.
A typical Dursley Monday morning consisted of Harry making breakfast, cleaning the dishes, then the kitchen, all while dodging cuffs about the head and body from his three relatives for the slightest imagined deficiency. Today was similar in that Harry did his chores, and had to play ‘Dodge the Dursleys’, but it was different than most in a very… magical way.
“Fleur,” Harry said disgruntledly, trying not to draw too much attention to himself. “I have literally zero interest in this tournament right now. I can think of at least three other things and places I would rather be doing and be at than being here at this feast and watching the stupid fire cup.”
“So, boy. You play the…” Vernon looked down at the open book in his hand. “... seeker position, is that right?”
As the week went by, Harry found himself ordered to make himself protein heavy breakfasts, and to go on runs through the neighborhood (“An athlete’s got to build muscle and endurance boy, see to it while you’re away”). He also was made to lift light weights in the garage, taken to an optometrist to be fitted for contact lenses, and to sporting goods and department stores to get what Vernon called ‘superior quality gloves’, some high quality spotting goggles, and what Vernon described as ‘respectable clothing for a budding sportsman’, but really meant a new, fitted wardrobe’.
Ron looked mildly annoyed at Harry for what he must have thought was an extravagant splurge, but he accepted the omnioculars without verbal complaint. “I’ll get them back to you after the match,” he said quietly, but Harry could see the excited grin forming on his ginger friend’s face as he played with the settings on his new toy.
“Hurry it up boy,” the obese man grunted. “You’ve got ‘til I’m done with my tea of my article, whichever comes first.”
Summer at the Dursley home was always a bit… harrowing. Lots of chores, little food, and the constant threat of Dudley. Thankfully, this year the Dursleys were being cowed by the threat of Harry siccing Sirius on them. In the two days he’d been home, he was allowed to keep his school paraphernalia in his room, do his homework, and even polish his broom with his downtime.
Harry felt a little hope. This was going much better already than he thought it would. “Well, uncle. I’ve got an invite to a sports event from the ma… uh, of the type my sort would go to, and my friend Ron’s family has agreed to host me for the summer if you’re alright with it.” The boy took a second to gauge Vernon’s interest. Seeing him not entirely for it yet, Harry decided to go for broke.
“Ah. Potty, Weasel. I see you’ve brought along the entire horde of peasants.” There it was. That was why Harry couldn’t stand the idiot boy in front of him. No matter how good looking he’d become, his personality was fair repulsive. Harry shook his head to clear it as Malfoy continued. “Seems like you’ve also brought your pet mudbl… muggleborn. How big a dent in your vaults did this make, Scarhead? Also, I see you’ve decided to do something with your hair. Glad it’s not that black travesty it was before.” And indeed, Harry’s hair had gotten to shoulder length and was straight and silky. He had put it up in a small ponytail to keep it out of the way.
“Go to your seat, Miss Granger, we’ll speak after class.”  Hermione scurried to obey. Minerva turned to the blonde girl that Hermione had escorted here, and looked her up and down. “And you are?” She asked sternly, not recognizing the student.
“Is this seriously what it’s like for girls all the time?” Harry gumped. He had only had a fully female form for like… twelve hours, and already he was tired of people’s shite.
With that, he went up to the boys dorm and changed into his night clothes, which was a little awkward with the stupid effing tits on his front side. Not that he was embarrassed about them, they were his after all, but because he had to adjust his nightshirt in a way that accommodated them.
A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field. Everything and everyone had an aura of strange golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. The field looked smooth as could be from up here, and Harry knew the grass was likely trimmed and made to look presentable just before the public was admitted.
“Well, boy. You’re off then.” He stated awkwardly, “You… you do well in that quidditch game, you understand me? I’ll not have you wasting my investment in you.”
Halfway through his pushups, he heard Mrs. Weasley call everyone to breakfast. Harry finished his set, then hopped up, jogged back to the house, and entered the kitchen. He tried to sit at the table, but Molly was having none of it.
“... and then we went to Defense, where professor Moody took one look at you, shot a weak stinging hex that got you in the hand, declared that ‘not only were you not one of this students, but you were in no state to go to a class’, and ordered you to the hospital wing for the potion.”
Harry had made sure to inform Mrs. Weasley of his new diet, as mandated by uncle Vernon, and kept up with his running and cardio regimen. Lacking a neighborhood, Harry did laps around the property’s fence line instead (It was more than adequate for his purposes), and lacking weights, he just used some heavy items from around the house. He did get heated looks from Ginny and Hermione for waking them up when leaving the room, but nothing good came without a price.
“I see. That is very similar to how Minerva describes turning into her animagus form. But for her, letting go returns her to her… well, let us call it her ‘base’ form.”
Either way, I'm doing this without a beta, so please excuse any egregious slips in spelling and grammar. I noticed in some past chapters that a couple of my sentences end in the middle of the word or just cut off? I may go back and fix that eventually, but probably only after I finish the story.
Harry blushed lightly, suddenly a little shy at all the attention, when suddenly Vernon knocked on one of his bracers.
“Weak!” Ginny sang out, laughing lightly. “Bad Keeping Potter. We heard your entire confession to Malfoy.”
“Ronald!” Hermione reprimanded, while Harry pressed the bridge of his nose with his hand. “It’s Harry! For heaven’s sake, you can see if in his eyes, if nowhere else.”
“D’you see that, Hermione? That was like, three times longer than when I last tried! I’m sure I’ll be back to myself in no time.” Hermione made a concerned, but happy noise that he took as agreement.
The boy-turned-girl breathed in deeply, and released his breath slowly. He then turned his gaze to Fleur, who was looking at him with a little concern and an -oddly- relaxed expression. He was about to open his mouth to talk about next steps, but noticed a little late that he could feel a presence about her. It was warm and comforting, almost like laying in a warm-but-not-hot bath. He sighed a bit, and this caused Fleur to smile.
The teenager sat underneath an apple tree in the Weasley orchard, and turned his attention inward. After a few seconds, Harry felt the warm energy again. Gently coaxing it out, he sent it down his limbs and was surprised to see he was able to get it to reach his fingers and toes. Not in a position to be excited about his progress, he continued on trying to get the feeling up to the top of his head. It felt like an age later when he noticed he’d done it.
Harry was sat between Hermione and Fleur at dinner, with Ginny and Ron across from them. Ron kept trying to sneak glances at Fleur, but had at least quickly learned his lesson when it came to ogling Harry. Harry was about ready to reach across the table and slap the blush off his face. Hermione was trying to engage everyone in conversation, and Fleur was trying to suppress her excitement as much as possible given the circumstances. Ginny, on the other hand, seemed to make it her sole mission in life to embarrass Harry as much as she possibly could.
Fleur was pretty pleased at the situation though, overall. The boy had completed his transformation like he was born to it, and with a minor bit of spacing out aside, seemed to be taking to his new form well. The boy-cum-girl looked like he was coming to terms with his new circumstances.
?!” she exclaimed, a little louder than she probably should have. “Get inside!” She hissed, motioning him in impatiently while looking up and down the corridor. Harry gratefully followed her directive, ducking in through the portrait hole with haste.
Today, our intrepid hero was sitting on his bed, ruminating on his past year and the events thereof. This last year, Harry had received a most wondrous map and an amazing broom, learned an advanced spell, learned his greatest fear, and met his godfather. He had also come out as gay to his friends, roommates, and his teammates on he quidditch team yesterday evening (to surprisingly unanimous support). There was of course more than that, but that’s what it boiled down to, really.
she thought absently. Fleur had expected a scream of surprise, or at least some hyperventilation. Something, at least. She was almost disappointed.
The younger Malfoy stood up, and motioned Harry to get up too. “Father,” he started, pulling Harry to his side. “This is uhh… Lauren Devereaux, from France. She attends Beauxbatons, but was raised in England.” The boy gave Harry a look that said
Tall, lithe, and well-dressed in a trendy vest, a button-down shirt, comfortable jeans, and dragonhide boots, with a dragon fang earring hanging from his left lobe, the eldest son of the Weasleys was… fit. It seemed the only way to describe him. Harry blushed deeply, and hid his face behind his hands. Hermione giggled at Harry, knowing exactly what the problem was, and Ron groaned out “Ugh… Merlin save me, not
Harry nodded his head rapidly, then added in “Yeah, I do. I’m actually on my house’s team. I play seeker.”
In the evenings, Harry would practice connecting with his inner animal, but all he could do so far was recreate the feeling of warmth in his chest that he’d experienced in his primal mind. It was a bit frustrating, but the Marauder’s book said a disciplined (or stubborn) mind could get the process completed in two to three months, while an undisciplined (or weak-willed) person could get it done in about five months.
Transfiguration had gone spectacularly terrible for poor Harry, even with Hermione helping out. Harry couldn’t get the spell they were practicing (changing a mouse to a rat) to work at all, and lost a total of 20 points from the deputy headmistress for falling asleep in class.
“Harry?” Hermione asked oddly. “Have you just been sitting in here all day? Did you not want to explore? I found this great stall on the history of-”
“What the…” Harry trailed off, confused and irritated at the terrible sight of all the men being idiots.
Please look forward to more chapters at sporadic intervals and lengths of content. I generally write anywhere between 5 and 15k chapters, but average between 6 and 10k. It's weird on my brain and I'm sorry if my writing is weird for anyone.
It was all worth it though, to Harry, because even though he couldn’t change back for some reason, at least nothing had gone terribly wrong in the process. He’d at least confirmed that he’d stopped shrinking. He’d also narrowed down the list of possibilities to ‘definitely something human-shaped’, which, in the scope of things, was pretty cool.
Back in the girl’s tent, Harry was laying on his bed, pillow over his face, wondering where it had all gone wrong. He thought it might have been during his face-off with Draco before the game. It had definitely gone off-rail when he’d thought of the blonde as a person instead of a rival. But really, it was that confession, he thought. When his filter had temporarily gone missing behind steel walls of impulsivity, embarrassment, and determination to find some answers.
Malfoy’s face darkened in embarrassment, and he obstinately said with as much grace and charm as possible, “Of course Potter, how could I turn down such a polite invitation.” The blonde stepped up beside Harry and held his arm elbow out, making eye contact with his green-eyed counterpart, eyebrow raised and smirking snottily.
Supper was a study in waiting for the other shoe to drop. After giving his uncle his quidditch book, Harry sat quietly to Vernon's left, and, eating what was quite possibly the largest meal he’d ever had in the Dursley home, watched him page through the introduction to the sport.
the boys of the Weasley family were all eyeing him in an odd fashion, and acting weird around him. Bill and Charlie kept their distance a bit, and Arthur seemed unaffected.
“Uhh.” Harry let out unconsciously, baffled that Vernon would ask anything about it at all. “It’s uhh, called quidditch.” The boy bounced lightly on the balls of his feet, slightly uncomfortable, but never turning down a chance to talk about his favorite sport.
His uncle made a circle around Harry, waving his hand underneath and above the broom, giving Harry little pushes to see how he corrected his course, and finally motioned Harry back down to the ground.
Hermione gave a rueful smile, then said, “‘Oh’, indeed.” The elderly woman in front of him had an expression of
The more he thought about it, the more Harry’s curiosity turned into want. And oh how he wanted it. If only he had a…
Fleur Delacour was feeling smug, concerned, and kind of offended all at once. She was still disgruntled that Harry’s animagus form was a veela, but she still enjoyed being correct. She spent a couple of minutes comforting the boy turned girl in front of her, then guided him to the chair near the wall of her room. As she conjured a glass and filled it with water from an
“I’m not sure that matters much, at the moment, Hermione.” Harry responded, with a deadpan expression.
That evening, Harry was roused from his meditation by Hermione and Ginny coming into the tent to get ready for the game and drop off whatever purchases they’d made.
The only (self-identified) boy in the room nodded lightly, conceding the point. He knew Ginny could keep a secret, it was just that he didn’t want his animagus form widely advertised. It was just a little too weird. Harry decided then and there that he would practice only in his dorm until such a time as he was able to be ‘Harry’ for more than two hour at a time.
This was a little much for Harry to take in immediately, but after a little thought, he’d decided it was something he could work with. The veela form would be good for going about without people realizing who he was. He wasn’t particularly attached (except in the most literal sense) to his male parts either, and honestly, they were a bit inconvenient at times. Having a whole new set of stuff to work out was going to be a challenge, but not an impossible one. He filed that task away as something to be done at a later date. For now, the task was to change back, which could be done tomorrow, after he’d slept away his initial shock.
Harry bolted into his dorm room, grabbed a piece of parchment and a quill, and jotted down a quick letter to Sirius:
“You’ve gotten noticeably shorter and more slender, your hips are definitely wider, now that I look at it, and… not to put too fine a point on it Harry, but it’s almost like you have… well, breasts.”she breathed deeply and exhaled slowly through her nose before stating reluctantly, “It looks like you’re growing breasts, Harry.” The boy in question reflexively put his arm over his chest, self-conscious about the point she’d made.
Harry figured he must be making good progress, because the book said that once he could get the warm feeling all the way to his fingers, toes, and the top of his head, he’d be ready to start making minor changes in his anatomy. Harry had made it to his neck, elbows, knees, and pelvis. It was on Friday evening he’d finally been able to spread the feeling to his entire body.
When Harry sat back up, it was to the annoying sight of a grinning Ginny and a Hermione that looked at him like he was mentally compromised. Ginny, like she was a cat that had cornered a particularly juicy mouse, sauntered up to the embarrassed teenager and sat beside him. “Haaaarryyyy,” she whined exaggeratedly, putting her head on his shoulder, “I thought you were crushing on Bill!”
Feeling a little feisty, and not wanting to play the blonde boy’s games, Harry retorted “Aww, Malfoy, you say such sweet things.” He clasped his hands together at his chest and fluttered his eyelashes at his confused rival. “Surely that means you’d love to come sit with us for the game?”
After he’d told the entire tale, Albus Dumbledore, he of the many names and titles, leant back in his chair and chuckled lightly in amusement. “As always, the ingenuity of your parents and their friends astounds me.”
Harry’s attention was, however, not currently focussed on Malfoy the younger. Point of fact, his mind had stopped entirely at the older man’s actions and words, and had not yet cottoned on to the fact Draco was now pushing him down into his seat. Once he’d had a second to process what had just happened, he turned to his current partner and hissed “What the sodding
Harry, she learned, was apparently a very fast learner, because it was only another hour before she felt his Allure recede slowly. It took another thirty-odd minutes for him to mask it to the best of his ability, but it was much better than Fleur had expected for the night. He’d still be looked at with interest by his classmates, but he was unlikely to attract as much of the attention an uncontrolled Allure would command.
Barring the difficulty Harry and Hermione had with holding a conversation with Bill, the rest of dinner went swimmingly. Harry caught up with everyone, Ginny was opening up to him, Mrs. Weasley had stuffed him to bursting (“You’re always so skinny, dear”), and sleeping arrangements were made (Harry would be bunking with Ginny and Hermione, at the command of Mrs. Weasley).
Helping his friend to catch her breath caused Harry to miss a lot of what Arther had started saying to the other kids, but he gathered that Cedric Diggory and his father Amos were present, and boy, was that man proud of his son. Amos was going on about how Cdric had beaten Harry at quidditch last year, and honestly, the man was right. Even if Harry had gotten messed up by the dementors, Cedric still made the catch. After some more catching up between the two men, and between Cedric and the other kids, everyone was gathered around the old boot Mr. Diggory had found.
The boy’s uncle was sitting in his armchair, reading a newspaper with the telly in the background on the news channel, drinking a cup of tea before he had to leave for work.
Regardless of Percy, Harry’s birthday was a blast. He got some good presents. Mostly clothing and replacement items for his broom polishing kit. Nothing really too interesting. The first two weeks after his birthday however, had Harry showing some real progress with his animagus form. He’d managed to shrink himself (His form seemed to stand roughly 5ft tall, because for the life of him, Harry could not make himself even one fraction of an inch smaller), and to give his hair platinum blonde highlights. Though when he got his hair to about half blonde, his chest started aching for some reason.
After the brown haired girl turned her attention toward Harry, Ginny ran her hand along his side, from armpit to hip. “What is this?” She asked, pointing out the slight curves, where normally there was only a straight profile.
“It’s true, Harry.” Hermione added. “We showed up right after you giggled at him. I suggested we take a moment to announce ourselves to see how you and he got along without everyone present.”
Harry took a deep breath as the food was whisked away. Just a little longer, then he’d be able to go to sleep. He could feel the Wide eye potion from earlier beginning to wear off, and he knew he had at most another hour before he’d be in the same state as this morning. As he contemplated this, his control over his Allure wavered slightly and he got glances from almost all the boys around his little group, including Ron, the git.
“And try to man up, Potter. No more of that stuttering and looking at the ground shite. You’re a sportsman, show some self-confidence.”
It was a predictable event, that when Harry came out of his meditation, his control slipped almost immediately.
After what had to be the most harrowing journey since the floo disaster of second year, Harry fell to his knees on the grass lawn of the Burrow, gasping for breath and trying to keep himself from vomiting.
The three of them stayed up late, still jazzed from the game. Harry was just starting to enjoy the analysis of his interactions with Draco, when there was a bang and a loud shout from outside. The sounds were getting noticeably louder and closer, when the tent flap was ripped open and a stern looking Arthur Weasley was standing, silhouetted by wizard light and flickering flames.
“Yes, aunt Petunia?” Harry shot back distractedly. “I’m cooking supper! I thought uncle Vernon and Dudley would like a nice fish steak tonight, with some steamed veg and mash.”
Harry had just cleaned up after himself when he heard Vernon’s car pull up in the driveway. Looking around, he thought about anything else he could do in the short time he had before his uncle walked in the door.
Harry, not sure how to answer that question without giving away his less than ideal home life, just shrugged and said “It’s been alright, I guess. Better than usual. Got a couple of early birthday presents from the Dursleys.”
Now excited beyond belief, Harry decided to jump right in. He took the book and turned to the first page, which detailed the history of the animagus transformation, and what to expect from the journey of pursuing your inner animal.
After his awful morning, an even more awful 30 minute walk through Ottery St. Catchpole, and an even more awful hike up Stoatshead Hill, Harry was sweating through his jumper and hat to take it off. Stuffing it into his bag, Harry looked back across the wonderful view of the countryside as Hermione crested the Hill, out of breath and gasping.
Hermione looked exaggeratedly grave as she turned to Ginny, stating “Oh, we’ll be talking about this later for sure. It would be a crime to let you keep wearing boys clothes with a body like that.”
“There’s no possible way that…” Harry trailed off, gawking at himself in the mirror. At first glance, he didn’t notice much besides the fact his hair was now fully platinum blonde and miraculously laying down flat. He’d known it’d gotten long enough to need to tied back, but it was still weird to see. Once he started taking note of his body though, he saw that he did indeed have slight curves. A light flaring of the hips and a barely pinched waist. Turning to view his profile, Harry sighed in defeat at what he knew was coming.
Malfoy stood slowly, not half as affected as Harry had hoped. “Really, I don’t see it”, he answered, turning around his chair to try and catch the invisible spider, and thus falling into Harry’s trap.
“You do know I share all the classes you’re enrolled in, don’t you Potter? For that reason, I’m perfectly aware that charm’s class doesn’t start for 45 minutes. Besides, we should really milk your prostate, it has been a week. We should empty those balls”, Draco observed, now lying on his side, his head resting on his right hand, looking completely relaxed from his recent orgasm.
“Yeah. Hermione had been suggesting it to me for months now. But I’ve been able to avoid doing it, mostly because of you. If the horniness the cage gave me goes away, I might not have a choice.” Harry admitted.
In short, it was working. Malfoy was resurrecting before his very eyes. It was so beautiful to watch.
Malfoy had decided to stay to practice the Cautio charm, after having yet again cunningly used Potter to teach him how to do it. He noticed at the beginning of the school year that he usually zoned out when Lukewarm was talking and often missed the hand movements explanations. Provoking Potter into explaining them to him seemed the simplest way to learn without getting caught napping by the new Professor. Plus Potter was a way better teacher, even when yelling at him.
“Now that you can’t move away, I’m going to take the cage off”, Draco continued, while Harry started violently wiggling around.
“You know the lubing spell worn out by accident; you have to know I never meant to shag you dry on purpose. I would never do that Potter.” Draco explained slowly, never taking his eyes off Harry.
was miserable, and alone. So alone that not only was he not invited to their weekly parties, he wasn’t even aware of their existence until his little encounter with Potter in the Astronomy tower the week prior. “We don’t invite people; we just drink with everybody that happens to be in the room on Friday nights. You don’t have to be invited Draco; you just have to show up.” Harry had said.
“You seem surprised. Didn’t you just say that you knew what I was doing? Maybe you had something else in mind?”
“Your movement needs to be sharper Potter. You’re way too slow, I would have time to jinx you 10 times in a real duel during the time it takes you to cast it. You move like an old snail trying to take his final steps in life.”
Harry Potter was not good at reading the universe signals, but somehow knew in that particular moment that they would not be disturbed. No one would walk in, no one would catch them in a loving embrace and no scandal would break out the next morning.
“By the way, I cried earlier because the pain was so grand that it made my guilt go away completely. That had never happened before. But when you stopped it came crawling back and it was a horrible feeling. But it was not your fault.” Harry finalized.
It didn’t make any sense. Malfoy didn’t identify him at the manor. He had saved his life. Sent him a letter thanking him for his freedom, his wand back and more importantly his life, after the fiendfyre. The letter had felt sincere. Harry even hoped he and Malfoy could finally bury the hatchet for good.
Everything was pouring out of him so easily now. It felt that since it had started, it just had to come out. All of it.
Draco hadn't spoken a single word since this madness started. Why could he say? He gazed at Potter, still sitting with the big group. The broom story still wasn't over. It was the Weasley twins who had cursed it. He should have guessed. They were now on the fact that Potter actually saw a broom nearly taking Dumbledore's head off in third year. Apparently, the old wizard had found that encounter hilarious. "Yes, it
Harry looked down at his caged Cock and had to face reality: he didn’t want out. This felt right. But at the same time, he couldn’t help but wary about what would happen when eight year would end. That the longer they kept this on, the harder it would be to end it. He wanted to ask Malfoy about it, if there was any possibility to continue this after Hogwarts, but with him at auror training and Malfoy god knows where, the continuation of their little arrangement appeared impossible, not unlike getting meaningful statements out of the Slytherin. Conversations,
the man who made all of us miserable. Do you seriously think I’m gonna go and ask people for things for the rest of my life because of that??” Harry asked genuinely.
It was a still night. Back in the eight-year common room, he could see through the high windows the usually windy Scotland countryside being as calm as can be. The cold November full moon illuminated the whole room, and he could see as clear as in the light of day.
“However do you mean?” Draco asked. He knew he actually looked confused on the outside, but was jumping with glee on the inside, loving how he could entice Harry like this.
Harry’s eyes were the ones to widen now. “So you’re not mad.” He wanted to clarify it before he unleashed the bushy haired girl on his new boyfriend.
He wanted to tell Harry that he was ready, but nervous about what will happen, if anything happened. But he didn’t want Harry to think that he couldn’t handle being a father and carrying their children, and leave him for someone who is ready.
“Mhmm. Thanks Ted, see ya.” he waved goodbye and dragged Potter behind him. They found an unused pool table in the back, far from what poor Ted could see. “What the actual hell, Potter?! You are aware of a concept called consent, correct? Or just the notion of politeness and not getting all up in one’s space?” Draco said, pushing Potter’s shoulders firmly.
An hour later after Harry had showered and eaten breakfast, a red, sweaty Draco came walking up the boardwalk.
Harry never really cried. Even with his panic attacks, he rarely ever did. But today was different. He felt as though he was allowed to, seeing as how his life just went downhill ever since that day in the hall with Trelawney.
Draco went and sat on the beach to watch the sunset. It helped get his mind off of the sad realization that him and Harry probably never would get over their differences.
Malfoy drew back for a second, wand in hand, then launched himself forward, the unforgivable on his lips.
Harry pushed his shoulder away with a sheepish smile, curled up on his side and went to sleep. Draco soon joined him, curling around the back of his little spoon.
Harry sighed, upset that his mate was upset. “Come here,” he beckoned the blond over. When Draco appoched, Harry beckoned him down, kissing him languidly, lazily, and a few times at that. When he pulled away, Draco seemed more relaxed, the sullen looked he walked in with, replaced with relaxation and calmness. Harry smiled, kissing him again, whispering how special Draco was against his lips.
The blond was practically insisting he sit on Harry’s lap, kissing and licking his neck in their spot at the back of the class. Harry normally sat middle to back, wanting to see and hear the lessons, but not draw attention to himself. Now, he really didn't want to draw attention to himself and his...nuisance.
“It’s been over a week since you talked to Shacklebolt, and there hasn’t been any word about us since. I’m not going to hide in this house forever. I’m going mad!”
A few beats passed, where the blond didn’t move or speak, and Harry skimmed his hands gently atop the waters’ surface.
