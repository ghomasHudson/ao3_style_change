at me anymore.” When I don’t respond he opens his eyes and abruptly lurches forward, teeth bared. “Tell me what’s wrong, you worthless
“Sure, I do,” Potter answers easily. “This is the first time I’m at Hogwarts for a school year and Voldemort isn’t actively trying to murder me.” Draco winces but when he glances over, he sees the bright twinkle in Potter’s eyes.
He simply stands there, mouth working silently as he reads, for several seconds before looking up, scowling irritably into the silence of Harry and Ron’s office, as if he’d been rudely interrupted. “Do you both have the week’s reports ready for me or not?” he snaps, even as he watches Ron gather up an armful of files.
“He’ll get himself some cider if he wants some cider, Malfoy,” Ron says rudely as Harry comes and plonks himself down on the blanket beside Draco. When Draco and Harry simply relapse into fervent snogging, Ron screams, “’Mione!
I shut him up with my mouth, sucking on his upper lip before nipping at it and sending my tongue into his mouth, teasing the roof with barely there brushes. He’s holding me tight enough that it’s a tiny bit painful and it feels delicious.
you to know if I’ve bent over and let some other guy I ran into at some club fuck me until he’s filling me up wi—” Malfoy’s crude little rant is abruptly cut off as Harry lunges forward and knots a hand in his hair, fist closing over the small, stiff little ponytail at his nape.
,” he says pointedly. “And I don’t believe one requires an appointment to visit him at his residence, no matter how many Dark Lords your Master has put asunder. Please go announce my arrival, and tell him that I would like an audience at once.” The elf glowers, gaze turning resentful, but steps aside, bowing Draco inside and shutting the door.
“You can’t possibly tell anything about his expression from here!” Harry laughs, looking over to the stands once. “And there’s
,” Draco informs him before he can finish, his lip curled in distaste, “And you smell like a rabid, unwashed stray. Take a shower sometime, why don’t you? Not that it’d make me want to go out with you - nothing in existence will - but it might help with the stench.”
For the second time that night, he very nearly came. Malfoy was indescribably, almost painfully tight around him, the sensation almost too intense for comfort despite the lubrication – but it was brilliant enough that he almost came immediately. Harry shook with the effort of not simply slamming in the rest of the way.
you not to; I pleaded with you to let me inform him of our plans to leave.” Her face is set in a hard mask, bloodshot eyes flinty as she regards her husband. “Draco was just a boy when he left but
He wasn’t looking directly at Malfoy as he spoke – instead he stared at his navel that was visible where his shirt rode up, round and shallow, with a line of downy blond hair leading down from it – but from the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Malfoy smile swiftly.
Harry laughs, his head held at an awkward angle under Draco’s bony grip. “Something like that, yeah,” he replies. Crawling between Draco’s laxly spread thighs, Harry leans down for another slick, sucking kiss. “Remind me to send her flowers, mm?” he says, nuzzling Draco’s nose.
“Er...” Harry flushes hotter, scratching the nape of his neck where he can feel sweat prickling, “Right. So... Um... Ginny was telling me how—how Parkinson always gives her the best gifts and Parkinson, apparently, always credits
Granger smirks. “You’re right about the beta and the omega wolves, I suppose, but Alpha wolves very much do exist,” she says without looking up. “They’re very rare but there’s one sitting right next to you.”
He’s got Malfoy’s crisp black trousers down past his slim, silken thighs, and there’s nothing else in between Harry’s desperately groping hands and Malfoy’s sinfully
He doesn’t question it, Harry, when Draco doesn’t relinquish his grip on Harry’s wrists, willingly tipping his head back and sighing with each laving suck Draco bites into his neck, little tremors wracking him by the time Draco lifts ruthless teeth off his thoroughly bruised throat.
Every morning, Harry would wake up and go straight to his desk, writing Malfoy a note asking whether he’s made up his mind yet and owling it to him, even before he’d had his coffee or taken a piss. And without fail, Malfoy responded: ‘
any favours, Malfoy, I’m doing it for—” Harry abruptly breaks off as Malfoy’s face shutters completely, eyes going dead and cold, expression flattening. “I
. His other hand slips on the headboard where it’s clenched, a small patch of drool spreading on the pillow beneath his cheek. Harry watches his kiss-swollen lips tremble open on soft moans as he drives his cock in over and over into the sucking heat, Malfoy’s spine bowing each time Harry unerringly lands on his prostate.
Harry blinked. He was on the floor. He’d fallen. Lily was on the floor next to him, silent and unmoving. He had fallen over with his three year old in his arms and now she wasn’t moving. There was a thick blanket of cold darkness being forced over him. People were screaming. Wait. His
And so when they get home, well past 2AM, it’s with all his senses in place that Harry drags Malfoy into his bedroom and pushes him down onto the bed, undressing him with graceless tugs and fumbling fingers.
“No, Potter, the lube is just for moral support – to sit there in your hand in case you need something to hold—
“Get the fuck out of here!” Malfoy tries desperately to kick Harry’s foot out of the way, but Harry shoves his shoulder into the door and forces his way in, glaring right back at Malfoy as he glowers at Harry, rubbing his elbow where the door had knocked into it.
“It’s a nice place, Potter,” he says quietly, placing his small briefcase on the floor, and carefully setting the wooden box on the coffee table. Potter remains silent, standing with his arms crossed and feet slightly apart, staring intently at Draco’s every move as he takes off his cloak and gloves, and neatly hitches his robes higher before sinking onto his knees behind the coffee table, foregoing the sofa or the matching chairs.
“What’s the fucking deal with you?” Zabini frowns. “Is he that stupid that you’re worried to introduce him?”
Potter looks like he legitimately doesn’t believe that what Draco said could be true. “But... I’m not Harry Potter anymore...? I’m not the Boy Who Lived—”
Harry manoeuvred another clump of egg fried rice into his mouth while pointing the remote at the TV with his other hand, flicking lazily through the channels, nudging Baguette away with his knee as she tried to steal a spring roll with one tiny paw.
“Here,” a pale hand takes his uninjured arm and Harry feels a warm puff of air against his temple as he’s hauled closer. “Hang on.”
didn’t want anything,” Granger says laughingly, “so we thought why not give him something that he’s going to be buying in a few months anyway.” She speaks with genuine kindness and warmth and Draco somehow can’t bring himself to snap at her with any sort of conviction.
Malfoy smiles, jerking his cigarette with his thumb to flick ash off the end. “It’s our thing, Potter,” he says simply.
“I’m not?” Potter looks genuinely surprised and not a bit offended. “Then what would you say last night was? And last week?”
“Ron,” Harry and Hermione say in unison as Malfoy’s nostrils flare and he takes half a step back towards the door.
Harry waved his wand and removed the evidence of the incident from Draco's face. The bruises were the only marks he left. The white haired boy did not fight any of it any longer, he just blankly stared ahead of him. Even though Harry had practically destroyed his throat with his member a few minutes ago, Draco spoke, that was all he had energy enough to do.
with Potter, spends most of his waking hours struggling to maintain his frigid facade in the face of Potter’s easy charm and genuine kindness, and his nights and his showers pulling himself off to a variety of Potter-related fantasies.
as Draco’s. The walls are a plain yellow and the furniture unpolished. His bed, though a full king-size, isn’t a four poster with gauzy drapes like Draco’s is. At the single window, the curtains are simple cotton ones in a pretty floral print, and are clean but faded. There are no vases of fresh flowers or bowls of chocolate anywhere. When he tilts his head to look up the wall behind the bed, he finds, to his bewilderment, three different posters of Muggle motorbikes and one, rather unnerving, poster of a half-naked Muggle woman.
“I—I forgot,” Malfoy says, voice hushed and eyes very wide, his face a stark white. “I’m sorry, Potter, I meant no disrespe—”
Draco isn’t smug for too long though because in just a few seconds, Potter has both hands in Draco’s hair, clenched into tight, unforgiving fists, and is just completely
Two days after the Witch Weekly article, Draco reads the Prophet over breakfast, his heart about to dive out his mouth and into his porridge, his hands shaking where they’re clenched in the newspaper.
Harry wound his fingers in the soft hair at the nape of Draco’s neck, gently tugging until his throat was bared and his breath was audibly hitched. “Really?” He brushed his lips over Draco’s – once, twice; barely-there touches that made him whine and pull against Harry’s grip on his hair.
We cheer in loud bellows as Draco’s dart hits the bulls-eye and he turns around, crossing one ankle behind the other and bowing jauntily.
his mouth until they were both scarlet in the face and gasping for breath at which point Draco had made a quick, completely dazed escape so he could Apparate home, get in the bath and stare at his little rubber dragon for half an hour while wondering if Potter had tasted his own come on Draco’s tongue.
Quite suddenly, his stomach clenched and his wand slipped out of his hand. There was a rushing sound in his ears. Behind him, Harry seemed to have turned into stone for how silent he had fallen. Draco spotted the hinge and turned the box over, his hands clumsy and fumbling as he prised it open.
Potter is every bit as intense a lover as Draco had imagined he might be, sometimes more intense than Draco has the capacity to bear with any sort of coherence. Just the way he kisses Draco, pinning him down into the sofa or against a wall or just simply against his own body, wrapping himself up around Draco and claiming his mouth with such unabashed vigour and enjoyment – it leaves Draco breathless even hours after he’s returned to his flat.
Without looking at him, Malfoy laces their fingers together and squeezes, and Harry’s exhale of shocked delight is a sharp puff of air.
“For Merlin’s sake,” Harry grumbles, kicking his own trainers off and throwing himself beside Draco, dragging the quilt he’s huddled under almost completely off him and over himself. He receives an elbow in the face for that, and immediately retaliates by shoving his freezing hands under Draco’s jumper, onto the soft, warm skin of his stomach and flanks.
Harry looked at Malfoy who was now smirking. His face looked unchanged. They might be back at Hogwarts in their black robes and he would look no different than he had when they were sixteen.
Ten minutes of Draco kneeling on the bare floor, just holding Harry, and a third helping of whiskey later, Harry sits there, pink-nosed and sniffling, Auror robes shrugged off and strewn messily over the sofa, his eyes bloodshot and puffy, smudged, tear flecked glasses abandoned on the coffee table. Draco sits pinned to him, one leg thrown across Harry’s lap, one arm around his shoulders while he rubs warm circles on Harry’s chest with his other hand.
“So fucking sexy when you’re like this,” Potter licks his way up Draco’s throat, pinching little bits of skin between his teeth. “That’s it. Come all over me, Malfoy.”
, Potter!” he laughs, and next to him, Potter is grinning too, sheepish and a bit shy. “Look at you, you fat thing!”
“Potter, I don’t know how to tell you this gently. My world doesn’t revolve around you. I don’t have the time to fucking simper and curtsey every time you walk into the room.”
That is until Potter looks up, still beaming, and reaches for Draco’s hands, holding them pressed flat over his own stomach. “Do you feel that?” he breathes as the baby moves in a slow tumble.
He doesn’t wait for her to reply before turning around and striding away, making his way back to the little private lab he’d spent an extra fifteen thousand Galleons on when he’d bought the place.
“I take it you’ve spotted my arsehole by now,” Malfoy bit out. “So go ahead and put one finger in, Potter.” Harry blinked and looked around, registering the instruction at last.
Potter laughs, and it’s a rich, warm sound that makes Draco want to say more things to make him laugh. “You’re not really a one-night-stand, though,” he tells Draco, raising an eyebrow, lips curved up in a wry smile. “Not after last night.”
Malfoy’s fingers scrabbled over his wand on the bedside table, the thin length of wood slipping out of his grasp repeatedly. Harry could see the muscles in Malfoy’s jaw twitching as he grit his teeth in frustration.
“Did he make a fool of himself when he first saw you or is he one of those who have more control over themselves?”
When he turns, Harry’s standing right there, practically nose to nose with him, and Draco can’t help the soft splutter of surprise he emits.
Later, reduced to a pile of trembling limbs and covered with sweat, Draco stretched out half an arm’s length away from Potter. He remained silent, his arse still contracting, as Potter drunkenly rambled on and on about taking Draco out to dinner the following evening. And when Potter fell silent and began to snore, Draco dressed and left.
Startlingly enough, Malfoy snorts, lowering his wand and wiping his nose with the hand still holding it. “I’ll take a lot more than just your
show up and bring the unlikeliest partner with you,” Malfoy says, eyes glinting wickedly. “Give them something to lap up, Potter, don’t be stingy.”
“Not good, then?” Potter chuckles as Draco elbows him out of the way and stumbles forward to his workbench, staring blankly into the cauldron. “I thought it was pretty fucking fantastic, really,” he murmurs, coming up behind Draco and pushing his nose into the little nook under Draco’s ear, inhaling deeply, arms back around his waist. “Fuck, you smell like a dream.”
“Yes,” Harry says flatly, stuffing the towel back in and slinging the bag over his shoulder, shaking his head as Ginny grins evilly. “Don’t be a shit. I gotta go. Go get some carbs for dinner.”
at the moment, his cock practically vibrating with the need for further stimulation. Malfoy is warm and pliant and gorgeous in his arms and Harry feels as though he’s slowly unravelling, mind and body.
“I wish we were smart enough to take advantage of the kids being out of our hair,” Draco says, stroking Harry’s swollen mouth with his thumb. “We ought to get our sleep.”
. Harry smiled a lot, laughed more, even showed signs of his surprisingly sharp sense of humour and dry wit.
with helping her pick them out. And, well--” Harry tugs at one earlobe, shifting in his seat, “I was—I was wondering if you’d help me...you know, pick a gift out for him—for my boyf—boyfriend.”
Malfoy’s face softened into something that resembled an actual smile this time. “I have the most powerful weapon with me, Potter.” Harry looked at the sword in his belt, sheathed once more, but Malfoy shook his head. “No.” He turned a bit to show Harry the bundle strapped to his back, and Scorpius’ flushed face came into view above his shoulder. “I have Harry Potter’s greatest fan with me.”
“You are so welcome, Malfoy,” Potter says happily. “Did you see the chocolate I put in your room? These are from that shop too,” he adds, gesturing to the
younger than he’d been when he’d resided at the Manor and looks almost faint with happiness and excitement as Black tousles his hair playfully.
His own stomach felt like he had stones in it as he helped Lily eat and watched the boys munch. When he chanced a glance across the clearing, it was just in time to see both Malfoys hurriedly look away. Scorpius was holding a steaming mug of something between both hands. Malfoy sat with his arms around his knees, his sword propped up against a tree next to him.
The challenge in Malfoy’s tone is unmistakable and Harry wonders if this is his last chance to salvage things.
“What?” Potter’s frowning now. “That’s a good start, right there, Malfoy. What, you think everyone just produces a full, corporeal Patronus within the week?”
The rest of the house is not any better than the horrible corridor downstairs and is hardly better lit either, but the room Potter leads him into on the second floor, like the kitchen, is a whole other story.
“Gonna,” Harry nods, pulling his fingers out and replacing it with his thumb, massaging just the inside of his rim until Draco is arching like a cat. “Turn over.”
“Master Draco is being leaving!” he yells into Harry’s face, his jarring bullfrog croak serving to further jerk Harry out of his daze.
Harry thumbs Draco’s jutting lower lip before holding his chin in a gentle pinch and bringing his mouth down to his own. “I’m pretty sure there’s all of one specimen of my preferred type,” Harry says softly against Draco’s mouth, “And I’m happy to report that I’ve already snagged him for myself.”
Brushing Draco’s hair off his face, Potter carefully cups his cheeks as they kiss, their lips smacking wetly as he further deepens it, sighing over the soft rumble that sounds from the depths of his chest. Draco almost wishes that the Potter from the night before would make a reappearance, the one who had yanked at Draco’s hair and grabbed at him like he intended to devour him whole – Draco hadn’t been given much time or opportunity to process any of that while it happened; he’d just let Potter have his way with him and blissfully revelled in it. But now, this achingly tender way Potter is stroking Draco’s cheeks, sighing against his lips as he lets Draco greedily claim his mouth is somehow agonising to deal with.
it, Ron?!” Harry had yelled back, before Floo’ing home in a strop and angrily masturbating for the remainder of the night.
Malfoy grins reluctantly, looking at the dancing, twirling, gyrating hundreds in the club, the multicoloured lights making his pale eyes sparkle pink-blue-purple-green for a second. “No,” he admits, “but it happened to someone I know.”
Malfoy’s cock was smooth, pink and was already glistening with a coat of precome where it lay on his flat belly, oozing head peeking out from under the silken looking foreskin. His balls were a shade darker, slightly wrinkled where they met his body, and looked soft and sensitive. He had a triangular thatch of trimmed blond hair, neat and sharp along the sides almost as if he’d used a ruler and a razor to shave off the rest.
They were scattering now, backing away, some of them zooming out of sight. Harry could hear something else. Footsteps; feet rustling against bare earth. Grunts of exertion – human grunts.
Both of them open their mouths at once, questions on the tips of their tongues, but then Granger is waving her wand over Draco’s stomach again and a few seconds later the lights dim and the same flare of light appears on the wall once more.
Potter moans again and shuts his eyes, his glasses slipping down his sweaty nose from how hard Draco is thrusting. He’s sucking Draco so hard that loud slurps fill the silence of the alley. His hands curl around Draco’s hips, thumbs tracing the hipbones and Draco tosses his head back, lips pressed together lest a single sound of sinful ecstasy escape him.
The line of diamonds sparkled daintily up at him, the platinum band so shiny it was almost blinding. Draco stopped breathing entirely, his body turning hot and cold in turns, making him feel dizzy and discombobulated. He could feel his eyes bulging out madly and his mouth was very dry.
As Draco is leaving a few minutes later, he finds himself glancing around one last time – and Potter’s looking right back at him.
Octavia snorts, bringing her wavy mass of plum red tresses over one shoulder and leaning back in her seat, lifting her feet up onto her desk, one black stiletto clad foot and one stocking-ed foot wiggling at him, skirt barely concealing what Draco knows are very fancy knickers. Across the room, the delivery wizard bursts into tears.
Draco’s own cock was gleefully filling up at a rapid pace and so when Harry closed his mouth over Draco’s, tongue immediately sliding into his mouth, Draco flung his arms around him and let himself be guided to the bed, both of them tripping clumsily over each other’s feet.
“Draco, oh my god, I am so sorry!” I’m frantic now as I try to lift myself off him, my feet kicking around wildly as I try to regain some semblance of balance. My hand slips on the ridiculous satin cover I’d put on the sofa cushions for tonight and I fall forward onto him, hard, while the lower half of my body slips off the sofa.
Granger looks up from her scribbling after a beat, frowning vaguely at Draco before turning to Potter, who, Draco notices, is almost purple in the face and staring straight ahead. “You...
Malfoy’s hand appears under his nose, holding two cigarettes. Harry fishes out the silver lighter and lights both.
Weasley on the other hand simply beamed at Draco, holding his big, ruddy hand out. Draco looked down at it; he had very fine red hair on his arms and some sort of marks that looked like he’d at some point had thick ropes wound around his them tight enough to leave permanent scars. There was a sprinkling of freckles across the back of his hand and fingers and his nails were surprisingly clean and neatly trimmed.
"Sure, take them," Draco says curtly with a nod to the small pile of worms on his desk. And then he speaks again because he can't help it. "Did you still not add it? We're half-way through the class and it's the third step."
Luckily for the eight years, the curfew is not something they have to worry about this year so Harry can simply go and sit down next to him.
of most of his thoughts and problems are forced to be there with him, shattering Draco's peaceful bubble.
He makes a sharp turn, just when Harry dives after the quickly descending form of the Snitch. They're head to head for what feels like minutes until Draco gains a bit of boost and Potter's arms are shorter enough than his for Draco to close his palm around it, the frantic fluttering of the feathers tickling his fingers.
“Oh, I can always come back later for the details,” Malfoy retorts airily. “Potter doesn’t seem to mind giving those out. Four hours straight, Potter?” And then with a snigger, “Are you on stamina potions of some sort?”
“I said come here,” snaps Draco, sliding his leg off Potter’s shoulder and tugging pointedly at Potter’s hair.
He stands rooted to the spot as Potter approaches him, slowly winding his arms around Draco’s waist and leaning in to give him a sound, lingering kiss. Draco hears his wand clatter to the floor as he buries both his hands into Potter’s hair and opens his mouth for his tongue. His cock twitches against his thigh and Potter makes an odd, growling sound in his throat, pulling back and fixing Draco with a piercing look.
actually love, I physically ache all over. It feels cruel, twisted, that I spent all these years after the War as his friend when I could have just made him mine, any time that I had actually paused to reconsider how I feel and been so much more than just his friend.
“Ron and I are going to go and pick up dinner,” he declares, taking Weasley by the arm and yanking. When Draco takes a step forward with his eyes bugging out of his head in incredulity, Potter just looks rather desperate.
Potter had spoken to Draco, had addressed him, with the warm familiarity of something that had never (despite Draco’s fervent wishing that had lasted many years) existed between them – friendship. Potter had been

“Shove off, Malfoy,” Ron says loudly, while Harry splutters and tries not to die of embarrassment. “Go annoy someone else, it’s too early on a fucking Monday to look at your pointy mug.”
He curled a hand around the back of his slim neck and yanked Malfoy to him, opening his lips with his own and slipping his tongue inside, ignoring the way his lip stung against Malfoy’s and soothing his hands down his sweaty back in a way he hoped was...comforting?
for fuck’s sake – his expression completely shuttered, the carefully controlled impassivity sending Draco’s pulse racing even as his mind turns sluggish and
Harry’s nostrils flare as he raises his eyebrows. “The fuck do you think, you arsehole?” he asks, voice very low. “D’you think I made all of it up?”
, isn’t it?” Ginny’s laughing too, poking the grass in between Harry’s tightly pressed lips and wiping squelchy dirt on his face, “He has a nice round arse that
Hearing Malfoy call out his name as he climaxed - Harry couldn’t hold back anymore. With a throaty cry of his own, he was coming all over his hand, his thighs, his stomach. On the other end, Malfoy was moaning a long, low moan that made Harry cuss under his breath and wish fiercely, for the first time yet, that Malfoy was there – with him, in his bed.
He pulls off on instinct, blinking as some of the warm, white streaks hit his chin, his gaze traversing up Potter’s twisting form to his face, scrunched up and red with pleasure. He keeps one hand moving along the shaft, squeezing and twisting relentlessly under the head until Potter makes a wet sound of incoherence and reaches down to clamp a hand around Draco’s wrist, eyes flying open.
Then Potter deftly buries two fingers into Draco’s arse until his knuckles are bruising the soft, clenching rim.
Then the heavy beat, the blinding flashes of light, the jostle of the cavorting people around them, the soft, nearly inaudible whimpers Malfoy is emitting – they’re all rushing to the forefront and Harry manages to gather enough awareness to realise with a rough groan that he’s currently in the midst of the literal best kiss of his life.
“You okay?” he asks breathlessly, carefully brushing some of Draco’s hair out of his eyes. “Too rough? Did I—?”
“Challenge accepted.” Harry sat up, kicking the covers off himself vigorously and accidentally catching Baguette with one heel. “Shit, Baguette, I’m so sorry!”
“Okay, I’ll answer for you,” Ron says. “He’s never been in love before you. And he’s been in love with you for
To Harry’s mild surprise, Malfoy went a bit pink in the face. “It’s horrible, what adulthood does to you. All this good sense and maturity that I must deal with is exhausting.”
“You haven’t told him?” Granger turns to Potter again, looking exasperated. “Harry, I don’t understand why you pretend like it’s not a big deal.”
Malfoy makes a muted, choking sound, his fingers grinding Harry’s knuckles together as he squeezes, his whole face and neck going brilliantly pink as he gapes at Harry, mouthing soundlessly. Harry, despite their audience and the fact that he’d just bared his heart in front of them, feels more self-assured and resilient than he thought one might in a moment like this.
!” he roars and then follows it up with another shove, face maroon with rage, his hair falling out of its knot. Outside there’s a ear-splitting crack of thunder, and a blinding fork of lightning lights up the sky outside the window at the end of the corridor.
one else, has Draco spent three solid hours just kissing – and that was just the night before. The evening before that, Draco had actually escaped from work two hours early so he could pop into Grimmauld and neck with Potter right past dinnertime. It's shameful and embarrassing and Draco doesn’t even care a little bit.
Draco bares his teeth, thrashing under him before yowling in agony – Potter’s got one leg twisted around one of his own and has it bent at an awkward, excruciatingly painful angle, so that Draco has to thump his free foot into the mats repeatedly to fight another scream of pain at the way his left knee is being contorted.
“Harry.” Ron looks at me beseechingly, failing abysmally at trying to control his own helpless laughter. Draco has one leg wrapped around him and is rubbing his cheek on Ron’s shoulder, singing the chorus from Celestina Warbeck’s ‘Hubba Bubba Bubblin’ Heart’.
Draco clicks his tongue irritably, stepping out of the tub and vigorously drying his feet on the bathmat. “Why didn’t you get
He yanks his finger free and slaps me across the face hard enough to make me stumble back. Before I can recover, he’s stepped forward and shoved me again, screaming, “
“Have you slipped him a potion?” Dean’s eyes are narrowed as though he’s actually considering it as a genuine possibility.
Draco eyes slammed shut as a little yip of pleasure sounded in his throat, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed hurriedly. Harry painted wide, wet strokes over his hole, pressing the flat of his tongue
“Everything’s going to be all right, Malfoy,” Hermione says gently, before she straightens in her seat, visibly struck. “You... You do intend on keeping it?”
The enormous pot of Everlasting Ink shines serenely through the translucent, blue glass bottle, faintly shimmering and promising perdurability. The Self-Organising folder is in jet black, aged dragon hide, edged with silvery-green, the clasp a solid silver button. The flat, rectangular, velvet lined box containing three cloak-clasps, one of them pure gold and inlaid with citrines, the other two in platinum inlaid with sapphires and emeralds respectively, glimmers smugly up at Draco.
“We do?” Harry’s voice is low and gruff and before Draco can reply, he’s leaned in and kissed Draco square on the mouth, tongue and all.
“I risked nothing, I’m the best brewer of medicinal potions I know, right after Severus Snape,” Draco rants in one breath. “I’m aware of the effects of that potion and was confident that Harry would be in possession of his mental faculties enough not to harm or attack me.”
Draco shuts his streaming eyes, reaches up to grab Potter’s hips with both hands...and applies suction.
After a solid two minutes, during which they just stare around quietly, hearts pounding, hips and shoulders brushing, Malfoy asks softly, “Is that why you’ve never responded before? Regulations?”
“Potter, I’ve been on stealth mode for over three months with my five year old. Are you really surprised?”
But Harry was bent over again, laughing soundlessly at something behind the fridge. Draco could hear the furious chattering of that stupid little ferret and a moment later, with another tug, Harry turned around clutching a bunch of dusty socks and a grey waistcoat.
knows the answer but can’t be sure but also has a good idea as to what I’m feeling and just wants me to say it out loud and be done with it.
“Why are you drinking stuff with Veela hair in it?” Harry asks in bewilderment before he can stop himself.
He doesn’t hurry. He stands there under the hot jets of water, his cock half hard and his jaw stinging sweetly where Harry bit him, and he stares blankly at the tiles, gnawing on his lip and absently running the soap over himself as he recalls the raw
Malfoy lasted an impressive twenty-seven minutes. He’d hardly been insouciant along the way; he huffed out several forceful sighs, loudly gnashed his straight white teeth, inadvertently broke not one, but two quills; his expression remained set in an angry moue, his face getting redder and redder until finally, at long last, he slammed his fist down on the table and bared his teeth at Harry with a nearly venomously hissed, “
“Turn over and look us in the eye, little Death Eater,” one of the boys crooned, edging the toe of his shoe under Malfoy and nudging.
thing I can do,” Draco presses stubbornly. “I could find you another elf, maybe? One that knows how to clean a house effectively.”
Slowly, their shoes soundless on the mown grass in the backyard, the four of them approached the house. Nothing moved inside and when Harry reached out and pushed the door further open, the creak it made had him stiffening and looking around nervously.
“Or maybe I just really wanted you to make us cake, Potter,” Draco replies slyly, holding his coffee out of the way when Lyra reaches for it.
His stomach clenched in a mixture of excitement and embarrassment when he realised that not only had he been caught staring but was being thoroughly scrutinised himself. His pace, having had slowed down slightly, immediately went back up and he remembered to keep his chin raised.
The look of disbelief Malfoy shoots him serves to make Harry snap out of it some – just slightly. “Excuse me?” Malfoy dips his head, looking at Harry as though he’s the dumbest, most obtuse half-wit alive. “Your cock is soft?” he repeats, one eyebrow hooking upwards. “Is that a completely unnecessary observation you’re sharing with me, or do you genuinely not know how sex works?” When Harry continues to stare with his mouth hanging open, he declares hotly, “You came
Draco makes a sharp sound of impatience over near the massive fireplace that takes up most of one wall; he lays down yet another rug over the three he’s already spread out, sniffling wetly. “Stop being a tit and come here,” he calls, reaching over the back of two armchairs and a sofa to steal all the cushions he can find, tossing them down and then fishing out his handkerchief to blow his nose into.
It turned out to be Butterbeer and Harry chugged it gratefully, his throat feeling rough and scratchy. The potion was already taking effect; his eyes felt heavy and the dull throb in his side felt muted as he lay back down with a soft sigh, drawing the covers up and turning onto his uninjured side, curling up as much as his ribs allowed him to, mumbling out a reply to Pomfrey’s whispered
He pressed his mouth to her forehead and shut his eyes. She smelled of dirt but underneath that he could smell her baby scent – and a hint of Ginny.
His smile doesn’t falter. “There’s this guy I know; let’s just say he’s a friend, shall we? Muggleborn. Recently got out of Muggle prison. Was willing to do pretty much anything for a bunch of galleons.” He clasps his fingers in front of him and bounces on the balls of his feet, eyes shining. “So I paid him to let me put a very specific curse on his cock and then paid him some more to drink some Polyjuice and attempt to seduce a serial adulterer I know into sucking his cursed cock. Turns out that the greedy little swine wanted to a lot more than just suck his cock; he wanted to ride it too! Such a pity it landed him at Mungo’s.
“Oh, yes,” Granger nods proudly, “Harry’s blood would prove most efficient at helping other werewolves in need of blood transfusions. No, he can’t pass his Alpha gene on through blood transfusions,” she says just as Draco opens his mouth to ask. “Like I said, that trait is innate.” She shuffles some parchments, throwing Potter a fond, if rather tired smile. “Harry doesn’t like to talk about it because he thinks it shouldn’t be blown out of proportion; he thinks people would have the exact same reaction you just did – that they’d all conclude that Harry Potter
Draco thinks he can still feel the coarse, black fur beneath his fingers; they’d lain on this bed, the wolf’s hot breath washing across Draco’s face as it panted quietly, it’s eyes a strange mix of black and familiar, vibrant green, fixed on Draco. The wolf made small, yapping sounds as Draco ran his hands through its fur, unknotting it much like he did Harry’s hair. From time to time, it emitted the same pained groans that Draco had heard earlier – Draco suspected, upon light inspection, he had a cracked bone in his left hind leg. He’d used a basic Numbing Charm to alleviate the pain but mostly, the wolf had just whimpered quietly until they both fell asleep, sometime well after three AM.
Malfoy, surprisingly, didn’t complain further after that, and as they stepped into the pub through the swing doors that squeaked loudly at the hinges, Harry realised that he wasn’t holding Malfoy’s elbow anymore, but Malfoy’s hand.
Draco registers the loud crash of skull against steel before he actually registers the pain blooming across the back of his head – Potter still has his arm shoved into his throat, his teeth bared, his nostrils flared. His arm is sweaty too, and is damp against Draco’s freshly washed skin, the fine dark hair pressed flat under the salty sheen. Draco can smell the musk of Potter’s sweat, a hint of his spicy antiperspirant under it, all thrown together with a hit of peppermint from the Toothflossing Stringmints he’d been sucking on all through training that day.
Hermione murmurs under her breath and the room is plunged into darkness, startling both men, before suddenly, there is a rectangular patch of light glowing against the wall, Malfoy’s belly seeming to glow with it. Stepping closer, Harry thinks it looks similar to a Muggle slide projection, but cannot for the life of him make out what he’s supposed to be looking at.
Draco’s hand, all of a sudden, shakes so hard, he drops the knife with a clatter and clutches his workbench for support. He can hear Harry’s low, affectionate murmuring, Caesar purring loud enough for it to be heard all the way inside Draco’s lab. Taking off his apron, Draco slowly makes his way outside, his insides in horribly twisted knots, his gait indiscernibly unsteady.
He gasps when Harry tightens his arms around him, exhaling shakily into the kiss as it deepens, their mouth moving in a wet, slick dance as they stand perfectly still under the lights and music.
Malfoy makes a tiny sound of complete shock but Harry hunches over him, dragging his head back roughly as he holds up a finger to his own mouth.
at her the whole time, until a helplessly giggling Neville had dragged him away, apologising profusely to her; Ron and Neville attempting to demonstrate to Seamus, Dean and Harry what a traditional wizarding ball dance looks like while people around them hurried out of the way muttering under their breath as Neville had vigorously spun and dangerously dipped an out of balance Ron.
“Yes, but you’re gay and she’s married to me, so,” Ron says loudly emerging from the cupboard with a large white ceramic gravy boat with little blue flowers under the rim.
“Whatever,” Malfoy mutters darkly, as Harry works his way through the maze of books again, mind whirring loudly.
“Caesar,” Draco answers grumpily – Potter is kissing the cat’s face now, even as Caesar puts both his front paws on Potter’s face and holds him off. “He doesn’t like being cuddled,” Draco adds sulkily, as Potter settles down on the armchair in the corner, holding the now purring feline to his chest.
, snapping instructions at Draco, and Draco’s cock is filling out and lengthening because his childhood rival and the hero to millions is hissing insults into Draco’s face – while holding him down in a death grip.
Harry used his hands to widen Draco's mouth and then he pushed his member down his throat. Gagging could be heard and Draco’s eyes watered with every thrust against his sore throat. His hands tried repeatedly to pull himself away but Harry kicked Draco in the side while he pushed as far down his throat as possible until he stopped fighting.Then he pulled his member in and out of Draco's wet mouth while holding his head. He felt how he was nearing climax. His member pulsating at the thought of breaking Draco enough for him to never lay hands nor utter another hurtful word to another human being ever again. And then he came, both inside Draco's mouth and at his weary face when he pulled out. He cleaned himself by wiping it off Dracos cheek. He looked more than defeated by now and Harry was satisfied and had finally got off. He released his grip of Draco's head and the boy fell immediately to the side.
Then suddenly Draco came rushing out of the bathroom with a wild look in his eyes, heading straight for the door. None of his friends noticed him leaving. Ginny didn't think much of it and leaned her head back while Dean started talking again. It seemed like Ron had noticed Malfoy rushing out of the toilet as suspicious, so he got up and went to the bathroom.
Draco was visibly uncomfortable by his nemesis tone of voice and body language. He tried to get up but Harry saw and went back to kick him back down.
“I’m done…” Harry said and then relesead Draco, letting him fall to the floor, gasping for air, “I’m so fucking done…”
Harry suddenly pulled out and turned Draco around into sitting positions, his arms still bound behind him. Harry climbed on the sofa and opened Draco’s mouth violently. Draco let out scream before Harry’s cock blocked his air flow. While Harry was thrusting into the boy's mouth he stroked his hair gently while putting his weight onto Draco. The sight you would see if you walked in were Draco on the sofa, his face pulled back over the supporting back part of the sofa and a very aroused and exalted Harry who was standing above him with his immensely hard cock shoved down the skinny boy's throat. The thought that obliviate had not worked and given Malfoy the opportunity to end Harry's life, gave him a shroud of extreme anger striking through his body like electricity. He slapped Draco's face hard and pushed down his member as far as he could until Draco's face was all but sweat, watering eyes and puking. He would have choked on his own vomit if Harry hadn't pulled out and thrown him onto the floor.
“So you are actually lying to me? When you are this dominated?” Harry said through his teeth. He moved the hand he had in Draco's hair and put it around his throat, grabbing it tightly and just above Adam's apple.
“Teasing me or any other in the Slytherin house won't do you any good” said Draco, “You, that disgrace Weasley family and mudblood slut have nothing against the pure purebloods and death eaters, stop trying to even compare your greatness to ours”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh how Draco was feeling inside, it felt like his whole body was breaking and tearing from the inside out. Harry's member were huge and extremely hard. The man above him had his hands tight around his wrists and used them to pull his arms forward, torturing Draco immensely by also causing back pain.
“You can’t get enough of me, can you?” Harry started, “It’s like you are following me around like a puppy”
Harry could feel himself boiling up by Dracos uncaring words. If they could, his green eyes would burst into flames by this point.
“Seems more like YOU won't see the end of things” said Harry with a smug face and pulled out his and Draco's wand while closing his pants, “I hope you have learned your lesson”
“You could have ruined my life, you know that right?” growled Harry and released Draco from his bound. Draco turned around slowly and watched the most extreme anger state he had ever seen his nemesis in. He saw all evil in those green eyes. But why did he say ‘could have’? The letter had already been sent… it was over… right? Draco’s heart was pounding violently and he still had the taste of vomit in his mouth when Harry got up to him and grabbed his throat, pulling him up on his feet and shoving him into the wall behind. Draco felt so weak after everything he had been through so he didn’t even try to stop Harry from choking him to death. Luckily for him, that wasn't Harry's intent, at least not just yet. Draco’s voice was raspy and extremely damaged when he asked:
Quidditch was something that kept Harry off all the bad thoughts of all the recent events this past year and the defeat against Slytherin affected him greatly this time. Harry had missed one of the obviously easiest catches of the snitch only because he had been acting lordly about his skills and underestimated their new and younger seeker. Harry was so full of rage afterwards he flew straight into the dressing room as soon as the whistle blew and hurried to change into his robe and escape the scene.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only thing that could keep him concentrated at this point was doing what McGonagall had told him not to do. As hard as he was going he might just break his wand at this point. But eventually the culprit arrived, alone and going the opposite way than his classmates. It was like he had ordered it all to happen for Harry’s own benefit. Draco rounded the corner of the greenhouse and went into the same corridor Harry was waiting in. Harry stood right by the entrance so as soon as Draco came through it Harry snagged his robes and stole his wand. Then he backed away, pointing Draco's wand at him.
Hermione looked quite pale when Harry met her in the common room after his quidditch practise. She actually almost looked sick to her stomach.
“By walking into you, come on Harry!” she says, “It’s a common mistake, you need to control your anger!”
“Then what is it? You look like you are about to faint” stated Harry and looked around the room to see where Ron was. He had not arrived yet.
“You fucking-...” said Draco and wiped his face off. He then had the guts to pry Harry's mouth open and shove down three fingers. Harry gagged and his eyes watered by the sudden penetration, “Shut up, faggot!”.
He pushed Malfoy against the wall and when he tried to defend himself Harry grabbed the lunging fists easily and then kicked Malfoy in the stomach. Draco let out a loud groan at the action and cursed against Harry. Then Malfoy punched Harry in the face, making Harry stumble backwards by surprise over the quick recovery from his opponent.
The bathroom stalls were empty, except one. Harry could hear puking sounds coming out of it, so he took the stall furthest away from it. They guy left not soon after.
“Wha-...” said Draco while Harry grabbed his hands by the wrists and pulled him to the table placed in the corner of the study room. He pushed Draco over it and shrugged at his pants, “I didn’t do this!” he said with a shaken voice.
Harry pulled his face away and let Draco catch his breath. All Harry could see was a snaggy brat that deserved to be punished by HIS hands and body. He pulled off the white haired boy's robes and threw him onto the ground while he pulled his own robes off. He could feel his member largened by the sight of Dracos messed up hair, unsure face expression and scared body language.
“Didn’t?” Harry asked while succeeding his mission and starting to rub his groin. “Then why does she meet me with a sickening pale face? And words of assaut?”
“You think you can actually win a fight against me? You are so fucking smug about it” Draco voiced his punches against Harrys arms put up in a defence position, “This is nothing!”
“Well… your invisibility cloak was in your bag and when you rushed into that room I wondered if I had done something wrong…” Ginny started, “So i took the cloak and sneaked into the room before you slammed it shut and locked it”
“You act all smug and lordly, Potter” Malfoy said cocksure, “But when it comes down to things, you really are a big wuss… Like the previous quidditch game”
Crabbe and Goyle laughed loudly at the smug comment from Malfoy and Harry was so close to stop right there and give them all a hard punch to the face. But he walked on, like he had not heard a thing.
“Yes you could have, but I ordered Hedwig to steal back the letter, oh man you really deserve to die right here on the spot for even thinking to ruin my life” said Harry slapping Draco’s damaged face, “I could kill you right here, Draco Malfoy”
Harry could feel how his body shuddered by anger and arousement when those grey eyes met his. Harry wasn't nearly done with him nor his punishment.
“You bratty slut” said Harry and shoved two fingers down his throat, nothing compared to Harry's cock that just had been there, “Look at me when I’m talking to you!”
Harry pushed away Malfoys finger and gave him a smug smile, that kind of smile he knew would send the blonde haired guy off. Harry didn't say anything, he just stood there. Malfoy obviously got triggered by the action but he didnt do anything either.
“Here you go, Hedwig” said Harry and gave her the letter while petting her back, “Bring it to Hermione Granger”
He didn't really plan on where to go next but his feet kept moving forward through the halls, hitting some students' shoulders on the way.
It didn't take many seconds until Ron and Hermione rounded the corner and saw Harry on the stone cold floor.
She let her books slam down on the table in front of Harry and gave him a stern look. Harry threw out his hand in protest.
“Just stomach problems” answered Harry. Then they both left the scene without further talking about it. The rest of the night they celebrated the game win and continued drinking. Harry celebrated in secret his own achievement fulfilled.
Madam Pomfrey let Harry go the same day. She said It hadn't come in anyone else that day when Harry asked. I guess he didn’t damage Draco as much as he had damaged Harry. That didn’t sit right with Harry, not right at all. Also the thought of Draco pushing down his pale skinny fingers down his throat made him boil inside. The first Harry did when he was released from the Hospital Wing was to pull out the marauder's map and check where the little ferret was.. No way he would get away with this.
She said all this while she waved her wand to get them all butterbeers. Everyone was still full of energy from the match so everyone accidently started talking in each other's mouth about the match. They praised Harry's thinking and he felt like he was gonna blush when they all gave him a pat on the back. Madam Rosmerta smiled and listened in on the kids. Harry had to go to the bathroom so he asked Dean to scoot over so he could stand up.
Harry suddenly felt how all his anger showered off him and how he could now see clearly what he had done. His arch nemesis were lying in front of him, helpless, his face damaged beyond imagination and his body severely bruised. Harry rose and stepped away, dressing them both as fast as possible.
Harry had Draco's hair around his fingers still and apparated them back to The Three Broomsticks. He let go of the boy’s white hair.
“Well, I hope you bring us to a victory this time” answered McGonagall, and a bit coldly if Harry would have had his say.
Chapter name explaination; The name Harry actually means Power and Draco's name means Dragon. Very fitting for today's chapter, at least regarding to Harry's name.
“Yes… Yes… Yes…” Draco sobbed and stopped struggling. Harry lifted his foot from his and walked to the exit, opening the secret door.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry felt how his eyes glistened with lightning strikes and how his whole body now where boiling. So Malfoy wanted to pick a fight?
Harry could hear the door behind him slowly opening, so he took out his wand and used it to slam the door shut and lock it. He then turned back to a surprisingly calm face.
Harry walked up to the sink and washed his hands as well. He could feel the glare burning from the white haired boy.
“You need to shut the fuck up, scar-face” Malfoy said and pointed his finger in Harrys face, “You walked into us!”
That was the last of it, the last thing that pushed him over his sanity, into a stage of rage and insanity.
“And if you ever tell, I will be upon you before you even have had the time to think the thought of reporting me” threatened Harry and therefore left the room, leaving Draco sobbing on the floor, waiting for the pain to ease enough so he could leave the room. When Draco moved his head to the right he saw that he was lying in front of a mirror and when he turned his back he could see what had been engraved on his back.
“Harry, what about going down to the black lake?” Ron asked and put down his fork, the food still untouched.
Draco could see that it was enough room for him to escape now and attempted an escape. Harry slammed his body against the stone cold wall with his right arm. Snow fell down from his hair when he reached the wall.
Malfoy backed away and let his owls' great wings spread out and then lift off, flying out through one of the upper windows. Draco was smiling when he turned around and noticed Harry. Then his face turned into fear. He quickly removed his gaze from Harry and hurried towards the exit, Harry was quick to block it.
The festive food didn't light up any of the trio's mood. The day was gloomy, tests were extremely frustrating and many as well as Slytherin had been really annoyed after Gryffindors defeat. Ron touched his steak with his fork and had a look of disgust on his face. Hermione was extremely frustrated over a test coming up so she hadn't even put anything on her plate. She usually does this when there is more than school bothering her.
“Get a taste of your own medicine” said Harry, referring to the shoulder pain, “This time, you will not win, this time no one will intervene and this time I will be the one who walks away”
“Erhm, Hermione, you realize that we are talking about the man that pushed YOU over the edge to punch him?” Fred said to defend Harry's actions.
“You both got a hit on each other and one walked away” she said calmly while cleaning Harry’s glasses, “So it’s over”.
She had sat with Harry for 1 hour, correcting his mistakes in his previous potions assignment. She had eyed his paper during potions class and insisted on taking a look at it. And now here they were, sitting outside the potions classroom, working on a paper about veritaserum, the most complex and annoying potion Harry had ever worked with before.
When Harry was about to leave he heard the bathroom door open and then a sink turn on. He heard someone washing their hands as he stepped out. Then he saw who it was.
“I can see that you come straight from the Quidditch field” Rosmerta said and pointed out the player's red cheeks, “Wind was hard up there today, wasent it? How did the match go?”
“You really need to stop underemasting people” said Draco and kicked Harry in the side, “And you are supposed to be the chosen one, what a joke”
“And this is how I will leave you” Harry said and pulled out, pulling down Dracos shirt and pulling up his pants, “Shocked, scared and damaged, like you have done to so many others”.
Draco didn't know what to do. His hands were caught in his long sleeved shirt and his legs were caught under Harry's weight. His member kept thrusting into his unprepared arsehole despite cries and begs for the blue eyed boy to stop. Draco couldn’t believe what was happening nor that he had no escape from it at all. His wand was back at The Three Broomsticks and he himself was now defeated since he could previously rely on his tehnic and flexibility to avoid or take advantage in fights. This was now impossible since a person heavier than himself was on top of him.
He gave her a smile in apology and she blushed at the sight and put her hand over her cheek while she scribbled on her answer sheet. Harry leaned back and stretched his arms. Then he saw white. It didn't take more or less than 8 seconds for Harry to be at his throat, pushing him into a study room. Malfoy grabbed Harry's arm, letting his nail sink into his skin, and tried to release the grip off his throat. The veins on Harry’s arm were pulsating, making it easy for Malfoy to cut one if he would have the opportunity.
Harry gave his member some saliva to work with and then he thrusted slowly into Draco while he had one hand on the shirt and Draco's hand and the other squeezing Dracos back side while he felt an incredible sensation with every thrust. Draco's whimpers weren't something Harry heard or cared for at all. He was in this mindset of getting off and letting Draco pay for all the harsh and extreme words he used against his friends and family, all the punches and bullying he had induced on EVERYONE all these years.
She asked in a soft voice and showed Harry her paper. Her writing was beautiful and Harry got lost in the admiration of the strokes on the paper that had formed such beautiful letters. Ginny pointed with her finger to the question and when Harry saw what it contained he shook his head. She sighed slightly and pulled back the paper.
Harry is standing over Draco and holding his robes with his right hand. The room they are now coexisting in is the study room which Harry had planned to get back on Draco in, or so he had planned before Ginny had interrupted it all.
He released his grip of his nemesis, only to give him a hard punch in his stomach. Malfoy fell down on his knees, holding his stomach, Harry pushed him down to the floor harshly with his foot and sat down on his back. He pulled Draco's head up by his hair and whispered:
“To Thorfinn Rowle” he said and gave the letter to the great owl. The owl took the letter willingly in his peak and went out on his pole to spread his great wings.
He kept the same movement going and for every thrust Draco screamed in agony, until there wasn't much noise left. His nemesis was drained of energy and he decided now to pull out and stand up. He could feel his member being on the tip of coming, but he wanted more out of this moment, more than what he had already taken. He pulled up his nemesis trousers and turned him around. He was met with teary eyes and red cheeks. He pulled Draco down on his knees and heard him whimper at the movement. Draco was completely defeated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draco woke up by a violent and extreme pain in his arse. He cried out when a new strike of pain flew through his body. Then there was something sharp, engraving on his back. He let out a scream as he felt his back burn by the touch.
Draco let out an exhausted wail when he used all his strength to deck Harry to the floor. Harry felt his head ache and how his vision got blurry. The blonde blurry figure came and stood above him.
Harry pressed his arm even harder against Draco’s throat, not wanting to hear anymore. Draco freaking knew… Why didn’t the spell work? What went wrong? It had gone days since the last time… if Harry would use the spell now, someone would know he had been obliviated…
Harry flew on him and started punching his side until Draco got his hands down to defend himself. Then Harry threw his second punch in Draco's face, making him fall to the side. Harry took his robes with a tight and secure grip and apparated them both to the planned spot.
Harry doesnt feel done with Draco. The boy still walked the halls with a smug face and an annoying attitude. He tests Harry at every encounter and when Harry one day hears what he has done to Hermione, there is more than anger, fury or wrath... There is rage.
Something is different, something is wrong... It didn't go as planned for Harry and things escalate to the extreme.
“My problem? Really? MY PROBLEM?!” Harry shouted and put away the wand, “You think I will allow you to walk this hall and assault people? Assault my friends?!”
Draco didn’t even gag, Harry got extremely frustrated and threw him unto the floor. Harry turned him before climbing on top of him and grabbing his head by his hair. He lifted Draco's face just to punch it back unto the ground. Draco felt like he was going to die right there and then. This was beyond anything he had been through at home, he couldn’t…. he just couldn’t anymore…
“Did my mother ask you to fuck me?” Draco pants, twisting his hands in Harry’s hair until he grimaces in pain.
Potter blinks, looking thrown for a moment. “Tomorrow, seven PM; Room of Requirement,” he says, shoving his bare hands into his pockets and bouncing on the balls of his feet. “We can get in a solid hour before dinner.” He looks rather pleased with himself, Draco thinks, while his own heart vaults itself up his throat.
The little creature jumps in place before turning, sending the vase crashing to the floor. It squeaks in horror, one hand clamping over its mouth before hurriedly snapping its fingers and restoring the repaired vase onto the table, tugging its ears a few times as it turns anxiously to Malfoy.
, and Draco had chucked an empty Chocolate Frog carton at him with a stilted snarl before creeping out to an empty broom cupboard with him ten minutes later and sucking his cock till he’d come down Draco’s throat.
!” He’s still fighting for breath, fat tears rolling down his cheeks and even in the dim light of both our lit wands and through the blinding pain in my privates, I am startled to register, not for the first (nor, I’m sure, the last) time tonight, how
“Thanks, you charmer,” Draco drawls, spooning an unholy amount of sugar into his mug and stirring. “But I did actually nap for a bit in the nursery before that,” he tells him, dropping a kiss to Lyra’s temple and gulping half a mug of coffee in one go. “And how’re we feeling?” he murmurs to her, setting the mug back down to brush back wispy black curls from his daughter’s brow and press his palm to it.
“Here.” Harry picked up the length of hawthorn and saw the way Malfoy’s eyes widened momentarily – as if he fully expected Harry to run off with it again.
“Shit, Potter, I’m so sorry!” He’s got tears in his eyes as he holds my face with warm, long-fingered hands and I hope the tears are at least partially from the pain in his foot because otherwise I might feel more than inclined to stomp on it again.
“Sssshh,” he shushes dangerously, watching Malfoy’s pupils dilate, grey eyes huge and filled with speechless stupefaction, lips parted as he breathes raggedly through his mouth, hands clenched on his own thighs. “Learn when to
He begins pressing soft, open-mouthed kisses all over, his hands bracketing the smooth globe of Draco’s belly. He licks the faint brown line that runs down the centre, starkly standing out against the paleness of Draco’s skin. He whispers words, his eyes sparkling incredibly happy and green, into the stretched skin, fingertips stroking and dancing over it. At one point, as he’s kissing around Draco’s navel, there’s a series of little answering kicks from within, and Potter laughs delightedly, nuzzling at him.
,” Harry pulls back and says seriously, dark gaze sweeping over Malfoy’s flushed cheeks and wet mouth, his pupils round and black within the pale grey irises. “And I haven’t snogged you yet.”
Malfoy’s shoulder moves in something resembling a shrug. “Well, you didn’t mean to, so...” he trails off and sighs before slowly settling one hand over Harry’s on his stomach as there’s a slow, tumbling roll inside.
A few seconds later, he realises it’s laughter. He’s laughing and drawing Malfoy closer for a kiss while wondering when the last time he felt such contentment was.
“Seeing as the nursery at the Manor is about five times the size of yours,” Narcissa says blandly, “not to mention the dozen elves we have in our employ, you can rest easy that your children, my
“Oh, I think you ruined your family’s reputation plenty when you pledged your services to a genocidal madman, Lucius.” Harry speaks clearly and very calmly; all his restless anger at Lucius’ apparent disregard towards his son after all these years is slowly being replaced by a serene yet unwavering need to simply knock Lucius Malfoy off his pedestal.
fond of lately. James Potter is tall and slim and radiates the sort of pampered, self-assuredness that his son decidedly lacks.
Scowling, but looking resigned, he leans up for a kiss. My first instinct is to flinch away and look back wildly just in case Draco is watching. But I make myself lean forward and peck him on the mouth before Disapparating.
“Such a fittingly pretentious gift from the most pretentious ponce to ever exist,” Weasley says rudely, looking mighty smug.
Harry had glared so viciously that not a single Healer came back into his room right up until he was discharged.
he’s pulled his fingers out of my arse,” Draco murmurs, running a hand through Potter’s damp curls. He blinks when Potter draws back with a wry smile, his own mouth curving up, his cheeks darkening, before he pulls Potter down into a slow, almost unbearably intense kiss. His arse feels tender and overstimulated, his cock a sticky weight against his thigh, but Draco doesn’t think he’s ever felt this
“Well, not right away,” Potter says, scratching the back of his neck and (poorly) hiding a smile. “I’d hoped we could eat breakfast first.”
Harry looked up, relieved and delighted in equal measure. “No,” he assured him earnestly. “It was Hermione who suggested I invite you, actually.”
Harry blinked. Malfoy’s head was thrown back and he could only see the pale triangle of the underside of his face. He was writhing lightly, and when Harry lifted his hand off him, he continued to writhe, shifting restlessly in a way that made Harry bite his lip as he watched.
“Why does he look like he’s swallowed Bubotuber Pus?” she continues, still peering over at Malfoy. “Why’s his face like that?”
“Why?” Potter does it again, licking along the curve of Draco’s ear as he gently plucks at his nipple, “You seemed to like it earlier.” He sniggers quietly when Draco whimpers, sliding down to curl his tongue around the tightened bud.
Draco instantly feels his throat close up, eyes starting to ache as he fights to keep his chin up, spending several seconds deliberating before opting to be honest. “I tried,” he says tightly. “I owled. I apologised – several times. When they didn’t respond and I was desperate enough, I went to the Manor. It—It was locked.” Draco’s voice quavers on the last word and he looks away, the room blurring before him as his eyes fill up, jaw clenched painfully tight.
Potter smiles into the kiss, the tips of his hair glowing golden against the morning sunlight as he pulls back and combs his fingers through Draco’s hair spread out across the pillow. Draco takes in the bags under his eyes once again, the bloodshot puffiness of his eyes.
Luxuriously gyrating his hips in slow circles over Harry’s groin, Draco bites his lip as Harry’s dark, esurient gaze traverses down Draco’s svelte frame to land on his slender, pink cock as Draco rubs it over Harry’s stomach, leaving shiny trails of precome over it.
Instead he’d smirked and tossed his hair back over his shoulder as he said, “Well, of course you did, Potter, I’m scintillating company.”
“And my son,” Malfoy reminded him coldly. “You may have fed him a couple of meals, Potter, but he’s all I have lef—” Abruptly breaking off, Malfoy quickly turned his face, squinting up at the freshly risen sun with one eye. “The earlier in the day you leave, the more daylight you will have to rest between Apparition stops.”
Potter doesn’t seem to resent parting with personal information, Draco realises. “So what else d’you think about?” he asks boldly.
Malfoy, meanwhile, is howling up at the ceiling, and when Harry frantically reaches around to check, he sags with relief to find that not only is Malfoy still hard, but is now leaking out long dribbles of precome, fucking his fist in frantic little bucks, hips moving as much as feasible within the tight space between Harry and the wall.
Granger nods to Draco on their way out while Weasley just stares at him, and for a while, as he hears Weasley’s humongous feet clomping down the stairs, Draco just stands there, shifting from foot to foot, feeling awkward and intrusive.
“What, and I don’t get to come along?” Ginny narrows her eyes, “Scared I’ll set off your pet Veela?”
,” he ordered gently and Draco, now perspiring all the way down to the small of his back, realised that although his grip on his own bum was painfully tight, his arms were limp and his arse wasn’t as wide open as Harry liked it to be. “Here.” He eased Draco’s hands away at the little whimper that escaped him, grabbed him and opened him up mortifyingly wide, pushing his face back in with an eager growl.
There’s a flash of white blond hair, blindingly bright under the midmorning sun, at the exact same moment Harry’s arm is ripped open, from wrist to elbow, on a jagged piece of glass in the shattered window.
Potter narrows his eyes a bit before rolling them. “No,” he says, “Why would you care?” They stare at each other a beat. “I was just clarifying. Earlier you said—”
“Malfoy, the pre-natal potions I’m going to be putting you on do not combine well with any sort of suppressant and you’re going to have to go off it,” Hermione says sharply. “Will you please just...calm down? Here.” She gets up and pours out a goblet of water from the pitcher on the sideboard under the window. “Drink this.
“Did you even mean any of it?” Draco’s throat is so dry that his eyes start to prickle from the need to cough. He’s overly aware of the seriousness of this moment and doesn’t know why the urge to kiss Harry is so overwhelming when he’s trying to convince himself that he’s livid with the bastard.
that Draco vaguely wonders after a point whether it’s Potter’s mouth that tastes of beer and over-salted chips or his own. Potter strokes gentle hands through his hair, down his back, over his sides. Potter whispers into Draco’s ear that he hasn’t been able to stop thinking about him since the stairwell. Potter kisses Draco’s face, and he laps at Draco’s neck.
for you.” Weasley rakes a hand through his hair, looking absolutely done with everything, before sighing through his nose, regarding Draco steadily. “You’re all he has right now and I think he’s already head over tits for you. Don’t put yourself in a situation where you’re not only in danger, but where
“I think you know it is, Mother,” Malfoy sighs, resignedly flopping back onto the sofa and dragging a hand through his hair. “Father, sit down and we’ll explain—”
The cufflinks were gold and in the shape of a sinuously wound snake, jaws stretched wide, tiny fangs, also gold, gleaming on either side of the emerald in its mouth. Its eyes, small pinpricks, were also studded emeralds. They’d mainly caught Draco’s fancy because the model who’d been wearing them in the picture had been rather good looking and had winked saucily at Draco. And it was just like Harry to have fucking remembered and bought them for him anyway, despite the fact that they were actual
There’s the hurried pattering of bare feet on wooden floorboards and then the door opens a tiny crack. I immediately heave one shoulder into the door, pushing it wider open, and firmly wedge in one booted foot in case he chooses to shut the door in my face.
time, Draco feels severely incompetent, not to mention thoroughly ashamed at the way his own throat closes up.
“I—I mean--” Harry’s face matches his uniform now. In his pants, his cock spurts out a dribble of precome at the exact same moment Malfoy absently licks his lips.
To Harry’s pleasant surprise, Malfoy makes his way back to sit down beside him once more. Narcissa sits in the sofa chair adjacent to Malfoy, reaching out to cup his knee at once, and Lucius sits down on the sofa opposite Harry and Malfoy, tossing one leg over the other and regarding them with a hard, expressionless sort of curiosity.
And then, with no warning, Malfoy dissolves into tears. He sinks down into the chair, drops his face into his hands and with a quiet sob, starts to cry, shoulders shaking. Heart in his throat, Harry walks carefully up to him, one hand hovering over Malfoy’s back before he just throws himself into the chair beside him, pushing a hand back into his hair again.
They don’t officially share a bed yet, though. On the nights they fuck in either one of their beds, neither of them makes to return to their own room, falling asleep together comfortably enough. But on the nights Potter is out and isn’t back by the time Draco falls asleep, he does wake up alone (and disgruntled).
“Bye, Papa!” Scorpius bellows, waving energetically as Lucius throws Floo powder into the hearth. “Dada, bye!” he adds before diving into the neon green flames. When Draco glances over, he sees Harry wave vaguely, his gaze immediately locking with Draco’s.
, of course, but I think it’d be prudent of us to—” Harry babbles blindly as one pale eyebrow slides slowly up Malfoy’s high forehead.
“I was thinking,” he finally says slowly. “I was thinking... Would you like to go to brunch with Tristan and me tomorrow? Just us three?”
When Potter talks, his voice is soft and his tone measured. “You’re not playing around with me, then?” he says. “This isn’t your idea of a colossal joke to play on me because the idea of messing with a werewolf is hilarious?”
“Oh, so you won’t tell me where you’re going in case we follow you and you’re saddled with the responsibility of saving my arse again?”
That’s the third time in under a minute that I’ve heard that motherfucker’s name and I barely just resist the impulse to cause Draco physical hurt.
Harry smiles at him, fiddling pointedly with his wand. “I’ll take that as a wonderful compliment, old man,” he says, tipping his head courteously. When he looks around, Malfoy is watching him intently, the reluctant amusement in his eyes unmistakable, his pink mouth soft and twitching as he holds back a smile.
“It was so hard for us here, Draco,” she whispers brokenly. “For your father, especially. We couldn’t leave the Manor without a wand being pointed at us, a hex being flung our way. And with you gone, it just seemed so dismal, living all by ourselves in this house.”
“Oh, I think your dazzling personality would’ve more than kept all and any idiots away, Malfoy,” Harry informs him coolly, leaning against the wall behind Hermione’s chair and pushing his hands into his pockets.
But it didn’t feel bitter anymore – it wasn’t hostile now. They weren’t rivals anymore – Harry realised that they hadn’t been for a good couple of years now.
“Could you...pour me a glass of water?” Malfoy sounded like he fully expected Harry to laugh in his face.
“Harry.” Her voice is so soft that it’s barely heard over the television. Ron promptly turns it off, the idiot. “It’s alright, Harry,” she says gently.
There was a quiet little crack as the bone snapped together. Harry gritted his teeth and determinedly controlled his bladder.
Malfoy, for his part, never looks away, never protests – not when Harry strips him bare, not when Harry puts his mouth on him, not when Harry boldly nudges his legs open and not even when Harry presses into him on a long, slick slide.
Malfoy shrugs. “I don’t know, that’s pretty much it,” he flushes a deep red, “Just some tenderness, but nothing else I can think of right now.”
,” Draco murmurs, crawling over him and settling down, elbows braced on either side of Harry’s head. “Barely two months and you’re already bored of me,
Draco’s only kissed three people before, one of them being Blaise while they were both blind drunk, but this – this is the kiss he wants to have all day, every day for the rest of his fucking life.
“Want me to stop?” he asked, managing to sound sincere despite the frantically building heat in his own belly.
Draco sat on the sofa reading the new book of ancient potions recipes he’d found at a book fair in Wiltshire. It was almost half past nine and he was starting to get pleasantly drowsy. Almost completely out of groceries, they’d ordered curry from their favourite Indian joint two streets away and the taste of onions and spices still lingered in Draco’s mouth.
The next morning, sometime just before 9AM, Draco is sitting up in bed with the Wireless he’d brought to his room from the library on softly and a book in his lap, when a low, hesitant knock sounds. Draco considers snapping at Potter to fuck off, to leave him alone and not irritate him with more questions, but the burning humiliation of the previous night’s conversation withstanding, Draco is unable to find it in himself to resent Potter for it; Potter hadn’t forced him to tell him those things. Draco had willingly told him, and with a whole array of details and he’d spent twenty minutes crying about his parents before he went to sleep, but he feels not a shred of anger or resentment towards Potter.
. Now if that’s all you’re here for—” gestures at the door, “—such a pleasure talking with you and everything.”
Potter hitches the blanket up over one shoulder and, as he does so, Draco sees what must’ve been a horrifically painful scratch along the entirety of his left forearm. The scar is a stark scarlet and must’ve been deep judging by the way the skin has knitted together in a dark line. As the blanket shifts further, Draco sees that there are, in fact, several more scratches up his arms, some peeking out from under the neck of his t-shirt. There’s also another wound, brownish-maroon and gnarled, on his left shoulder, but it’s barely visible except for a small sliver when Potter shifts again.
Draco reaches down and starts to stroke himself. “Not really, no,” he confesses, pointing his cock at Potter as he eases the sopping wet foreskin off the sticky head. Potter licks his lips, exhaling in a shudder as he watches Draco’s hand, eyes wide and staring like an owl’s. “But it gets me really fucking hot when you go off on me with that filthy mouth of yours –
“You haven’t smoked in over three years,” Draco says, though it sounds more like a suspicious question.
Granger and Weasley are next to leave, and then Draco suddenly finds himself alone in the house with Harry.
“Why?” Draco chokes out, more tears blurring his vision as he stares down at it, throat aching with suppressed emotion. “Potter, you giant
To his complete and immense surprise, Malfoy complied, taking Harry’s hand and slowly getting to his feet, then immediately letting go and wincing as he pressed a hand over his side. “You don’t fool me, Potter,” he said quietly. “You’re not the perfect, noble
“No; definitely not friends.” He considered what he was about to say next, wondering if it was even true. And then he just said it anyway, “But I think I like him...?”
Simon appears and takes my hand. Draco’s smile vanishes so quickly, it’s as though someone cast a spell. He goes pale as snow and his eyes turn so cold that for a flash of a moment I’m scared as I watch him take in the sudden appearance of a man I know he absolutely despises.
Malfoy shifts a bit in his seat. “Around three days ago. I... I went to the self-help counter at the free clinic in Knockturn Alley.” He rifles around in the folds of his cloak and fishes out a crumpled piece of parchment that he hands to Hermione, who for an instant looks rather pained.
As he watched the kettle come to a boil, Scorpius approached the other children. He seemed a slightly meek child, but wonderfully pleasant natured; Harry couldn’t help but think that Malfoy’s wife must be (or have been) a very nice woman – because obviously Malfoy himself couldn’t at all be responsible for such a sweet kid. Probably.
“No no, we’re on our way to Ron parents’, we just popped in to say hello,” Granger waves a hand through the air, “Harry, we’ll see you later. Shall we tell Molly you’ll drop by tomorrow for Sunday roast?” she adds hopefully, eyes wide and beseeching.
been a couple of cases or so in the past decade,” she narrows her eyes thoughtfully, “They’re just not bound to be very public about it, for obvious reasons. I mean, no wizard wants to—” She abruptly breaks off as there’s a low knock at the door, glancing sharply at both of them. Harry instantly looks terrified again and Ron gets to his feet, holding up both hands, eyebrows lifting in a wordless appeal for him to stay calm. “Come in,” Hermione calls out pleasantly, and then Draco Malfoy walks into the room.
that they were doing this again and would probably be doing it again soon afterwards and would most likely be doing this
do both of you know?” Ron scrambles around on the sofa to sit cross-legged and glares at both of us in turn.
“You’re lying,” Draco said weakly, suddenly shivering from head to foot like he’d been out in a snow storm without any clothes on. At this, Harry looked so outraged that Draco hurriedly babbled, “If you’re serious, I mean if you really want to then yes, I will, but if you’re playing a trick on me to embarrass me and make me think that you’re—” Draco broke off and stumbled back a step because Harry got to his feet and took one bold step towards him.
“Doesn’t stop you any from fucking it as often as you do,” Draco murmurs, leaning down and pressing moist, open-mouthed kisses up the inside of one thigh, Potter’s legs immediately falling open. “Don’t try to convince me that you don’t just
“Some would say it’s creepy,” Draco says with a smirk even though he feels more than a little breathless at Potter’s proximity.
Harry flings himself beside him, expecting him to grimace and pointedly pull away and claim he reeks, but Malfoy just turns in place to regard him closely, remaining pressed close. “I never thought you’d actually come, though,” Harry says quietly, still smiling at him. “I’ve been inviting you to the Burrow for months now; you never come.”
hard. You’re best friends.” She pauses, mouth lifting in a wry one sided smile. “Progressing from friends to lovers is the easiest, most natural thing in the world – I speak, of course, from personal experience.”
“Don’t touch anything, please,” Draco replies tersely, putting on his glasses and peering into the cauldron and sighing in relief when he sees that the valerian root hasn’t overheated and turned purple. He lifts the Stasis and gives the cauldron a light, careful stir, the silver ladle a solid weight in his hand.
They lie together in silence for long enough that Draco assumes Harry is asleep – but then, mildly curiously, “Who or what did I need saving from, then?”
Draco irritably throws in the winter cherry juice, scowling grouchily as he stirs, ignoring Potter who idly walks up to him, stopping half a dozen times to inspect various items on the way.
“’s golden,” I slur as the agony starts to ebb a little. Some of the buzz in my head has cleared out, probably from the sudden, excruciating pain, but I still feel pretty damn good.
“Do you know me to be the type of person who’d make such an offer unless I was completely okay with it?” Malfoy asks blandly, crooking Harry a little smile.
“I remember Weasley mentioning something related to the Ministry,” Draco says cautiously. “Something about you...considering something, or...whatever. What was that about?”
“That’s...kind of--” Draco fidgets a little, fiddling with his cuffs, “Cool, I guess,” he finally says lamely, fully prepared for Potter to frown unhappily and walk away.
“Ambitious,” Malfoy mutters against his cheek, shivering as he nuzzles him. “I’m definitely in. So, can we
me to come catch it, passing lewd comments and voicing its unsought-for opinions and smiling that gorgeous, crooked little smirk that never fails to warm my insides—
Draco’s just about to lift Scorpius’ head off his lap and go investigate when Narcissa carefully takes Lyra from Harry, arranging her head carefully on her shoulder and checking that she’s still asleep. When she walks over and blows a kiss at Scorpius, Draco gives in to his curiosity.
“Not that.” Harry swallows hard, his fingers automatically tightening a bit as the baby moves. “I mean, yes, for— for knotting you too, I guess, but also, before that—” he breaks off as a there’s a surge of something wild inside him and he hurriedly tamps it down with the usual, carefully practised control. “For— I could’ve hurt you so bad. I— I barely even remember some of it... Nearly lost control altogether, I could’ve—”
I can’t bring myself to look down as I soar in a wide circle around the hill. I hear the panicked screams and the shout of someone’s spell to slow his fall. I hold the feebly fluttering Snitch in my hand and stare unseeingly ahead of me as I gradually lose height and circle lower.
“Hard to believe,” Malfoy says lightly. “I was under the impression that the Weasel was your personal bodyguard.”
. He’s rude, he’s snooty, enjoys needling people to the point of having wands drawn on him (which he then laughs at), has a filthy mouth and is always shamelessly,
Carefully, and very slowly, Harry got to his feet, Albus being more of a nuisance than a help as he grabbed him by one arm and tugged.
—Or maybe I’d just bend you over and fuck you, huh, Malfoy? Shove my cock in you and fuck you hard and fast and—so
But now Harry is screaming too, flinging Draco higher up the bed with the force of his final few thrusts, and then Draco can feel the wonderful, hot splash of Harry’s release inside him, sobbing even harder now as he turns his face blindly to seek Harry’s mouth.
Probably because he’s completely winded from the physical exertion, but mostly because Potter is literally
They make it to Harry’s bike in the narrow, pitch dark alley between the club and the greasy spoon next door before Harry is on Malfoy again. It reeks in the cramped, damp space, the overflowing skip a few yards away giving off the stench of rotting garbage and possibly a dead rat. Christmas lights twinkle merrily over the tall fence and they can hear faint strains of carols playing on the radio inside the diner. It’s snowed lightly, there’s a thin layer underfoot that their boots crunch on, but Harry’s hands are hot where they touch Malfoy.
His cock is given a slow, feathery little lick, Harry’s tongue tantalising up the vein underneath the long, pink length, before his lips descend around the damp head, enveloping it in that tight heat, Draco’s hips once again lifting, this time in time with Harry’s slow, lengthy suck.
of posters – all Muggle – around the room,” he shakes his head, dimples flashing as he grins, “Most of them had Permanent Sticking Charms on them; took me weeks to fight them down. I’d have left them up but they’d turned mossy and smelt godawful. I left these up to honour Sirius,” he adds waving his hand at the posters above their heads. “Cleaned them up best I could. Wanted to keep a bit of him around,” he says wistfully, blinking myopically around the room with one hand still on Draco’s belly.
“I didn’t realise,” Draco says, voice low, staring somewhere over Potter’s right shoulder, “I—I knew that, but I...forgot I guess. I’m sorry.”
“Nothing,” Draco gives him a crooked, rather lame smile, before suddenly blurting, “Do you miss it?” and when Potter shows no signs of understanding, adds, “Playing professionally. You were...rather good. Do you miss it?”
Harry whirled around, wand in hand. Albus sat eating his banana, swinging his legs energetically, but James was watching Harry with wide brown eyes, mouth slightly open.
fucking wand, Malfoy, I know that. It’s why I returned it in the first place, yeah?” He sat down on the edge of the bed, next to Malfoy’s hip, and indicated with a lift of his chin that Malfoy should get his shirt off. “I’m just using it for a second because I don’t want to go all the way there to get mine.”
“It’s hard not to,” Harry blurted out before he could think. Feeling his face heat, he quickly turned to his bag, pulling out three text books at random and a wrinkled sheet of parchment.
Draco’s breath hitched, and he gazed back down through half-lidded, pleasure-glazed eyes, releasing his hair to stroke the backs of his long, nimble fingers down Harry’s face instead. His glasses were slightly lopsided, side-effect of being an excellent rimmer while also half blind without corrective lenses. But his eyes
He wanks, pees, showers, and dresses for dinner. He’d placed an owl order for a few sets of clothes with Extension Charms sewn into them and had noted the look of slight disappointment on Potter’s face when the package had arrived, prepaid for by Draco.
“Pardon me a moment,” Harry cuts in smoothly, finding Malfoy’s hand once more and squeezing, “but tell me, Lucius. Why is the idea of being associated with me so horribly objectionable in your eyes?” he asks with an air of genuine interest. “Do you, perchance, think that the Malfoy name will be
From downstairs, there’s the sound of the front door opening and slamming shut, Potter’s voice carrying easily as he calls for Kreacher and requests him to bring plates and forks to the upstairs living room, Weasely’s heavy tread sounding on the stairs with Potter’s falling in step a moment later.
glint they often did, when Potter had hurried back into the room a few seconds later. Draco had blushed furiously and squirmed in his seat, almost convinced that Granger knew he was half-hard just from that sudden fresh burst of Potter’s earthy scent filling the room.
Draco sighs. “I know. That’s actually what I’m here to talk to him about. I want to help him,” he adds softly – and just like that Draco admits out loud to why he’s really here.
Potter, to his credit, looks as hangdog and remorseful as Draco had furiously hoped he would. He barely meets Draco’s eye as he yanks the door open and hangs his head, chewing on his lip and scuffing a toe into the floor. He looks utterly worn out, dark bags of exhaustion under his eyes evident even in the weak light filtering in from the window at the end of the corridor, shoulders slumped inwards and general countenance bearing an air of utter resignation.
brewing him an advanced Wolfsbane,” she says in wonder, taking in the room once more. Draco glares impassively, gesturing with both hands at his workbench and then the pedestal, as if it were an obvious fact. “Why?” she asks curiously.
“And so what if they are,” Harry brushed aside huskily, releasing Draco’s arse to reach between them and unfasten his trousers, finally releasing his own flushed thickness, damp and streaming with slick. Draco moaned and closed his hand over Harry’s, stroking him in quick, practised movements that had Harry tossing his head back.
It was only when Harry had been in the shower, just before he’d gotten into bed, when he’d realised that he may have inadvertently humiliated Malfoy, speaking to him the way he had; asking him all those questions about what he did, just blurting them out like that.
She always does this and I always laugh, both because of the fact that I know she’s being a hundred percent serious, and because it drives Draco absolutely insane, which is endlessly amusing.
Potter bends down and kisses him hungrily, sucking on Draco’s mouth before shoving his tongue in and licking around, one hand still firmly fisted in his hair, the other cupping his cheek. Draco leans in, standing up on his knees and dragging Potter closer by the hair to kiss him harder, gasping as Potter reaches down and practically lifts Draco onto his lap.
The D is in a glossy, almost silvery, grey thread, edged all around with black to make it stand out more, and has a lovely little flourish, the style almost calligraphic. Harry had immediately written to Mrs. Weasley when they’d received their parcels earlier that day, thanking her for making Draco one as well.
“I don’t think they’re wrong in expecting the grooms to be on time for their own wedding, Potter,” Draco sighs, managing to smooth her robes down
Draco would tell himself later that night that he’d stood there stiff and proud, jerking only very slightly as Potter had squeezed and pulled him to completion through his clothes. He’d try his darndest best to convince himself that he had absolutely not
...together,” he says unsteadily. “Save your judgement for someone who might value it, Granger,” he snaps, suddenly slumping where he sits and taking an angry chug of butterbeer.
I lean forward and drag another box forward but inside there are just stacks of parchment bound into little piles with twine. When I peer closer, I recognise the tiny, neat handwriting.
Lucius is maroon in the face now, one eye twitching furiously, mouth curled into an ugly grimace as he tries to come up with a retort. Malfoy is staring rather vapidly at Harry, and Narcissa sniffles before sighing loudly.
Draco still has on his jumper, now bunched up around his chest, one pink nipple peeking out as he arches up off the floor, his mouth wet and gasping open with each press of Harry’s fingers inside of him. His hair fans out bright gold across one of the rich green, velvet cushions, his neck blotchy, and stippled with countless little crimson nips, lashes fluttering as his eyes roll shut.
Lucius, his eyes fixed on their joined hands, slowly leans forward. “Draco.” His voice is a menacing hiss. “Why is Potter here?”
The familiar spell was murmured and then Harry was pressing two lube coated fingers into Draco’s softened arsehole, sliding them deftly past the clenching muscles until they were in all the way. Draco was shaking, his knuckles bulging white where he gripped the edge of the counter. He wiggled involuntarily and earned a few expertly administered nudges to his prostate.
Draco on the other hand seemed to have plenty more on his desk, more than what the potion required so Harry was sure he wouldn't mind if he'd ask for some.
"No, you didn't. You're just an incredibly sore loser." Draco huffs, and he sits on the ground like they always do. He doesn't even whine much about getting grass stains on his clothes.
Draco even said "see you later" when Harry left and he pointedly ignored the butterflies in his stomach.
"No, I wasn't," Harry grins at him, and his eyes crinkle and he looks so wonderfully handsome in the moonlight like this.
It's not that Harry doesn't feel strange around Malfoy anymore, but it's almost like they're stepping into another world in these evenings.
"Anyway, I'd like you to plant these please, Mr. Malfoy here can show you how, if you're unsure." Professor Sprout says, gesturing at an assortment of herbs. Sage, all kinds of mints and ones Harry couldn't recognize. Small sprouts waiting to be moved into a bigger container filled with fresh soil. Well, Harry needs to do that too.
"We can do it together," Harry offers and struggles to suppress his delight when Draco's eyes go wide and he sputters. That's a hell of a reaction to get from the Ice Prince himself.
The moment he uttered the beginning syllables of the Crucio that never came, all his hopes of asking for help shattered. He was simply far too gone.
Their Potions class with the few Slytherins that came back to finish their 8th year however seemed to have the perfect opportunity to stop being chicken shit and talk to Dra—Malfoy.
"I am," Draco says quietly, frown in place and Harry's stomach tightens with embarrassment. That's fair.
The first opportunity to Make Malfoy Feel Something as Harry had named it lovingly (only in his head, never out loud and maybe that's why he fails to realize the double meaning of it) shows itself in the following days. Harry is having dinner with Ron and Hermione like he always does. And he's looking at Draco. Like he always does lately, apparently. Two whole tables and six row of students separate them and yet he always finds the tall blonde in mere seconds into searching.
"People can be bad at multiple things." Harry huffs. "I'm normally doing okay but McGonagall wants to torture us before our finals. I'm great at almost everything else, mind you. Besides, not everyone can be a genius in every subject like you are, Malfoy."
He missed a whole Quidditch match altogether, having spent the time looking for him, and even nowadays he takes the map out every once in a while, old habits die hard...
It wasn't as bad as his obsession in the sixth year, and yes, obsession it was, even though he hated admitting it. There was no other rational explanation.
Oh, how he missed her when he was crying his eyes out, big, bitter tears because Potter didn't want to be his friend when Draco wanted it more than anything. And he couldn't understand back then, as a child who has gotten anything he ever wanted,
As if Draco would be offended that he was late, and Harry wasn't the one who started bothering him a few weeks ago out of his own free will.
He treasures every smile, every touch and glance Malfoy would give him, he drinks them up, the pleasant warm shiver they send through his body and he's exactly three weeks into their little meetings by now when he realizes he might be a little bit in love with Draco Malfoy.
"Besides, she's right. We had enough tension and fighting all these years. I just want a peaceful year." He adds, more quiet and serious.
It matters not though, he thinks, as he's dragged back into the present, by the sound of Potter dropping his small shovel and muttering a 'sorry'. Draco can't find it in himself to be angry anymore.
Draco stops too, hand hanging in the air as he looks at the pumpkin juice with a confused frown. He tries to grab it again, from a different angle this time and he has no luck, the juice almost runs from him it appears.
They're worried, and not surprisingly suspicious of Malfoy. Harry can't blame them, after the things Malfoy had said and done throughout the years. He's not even sure he fully forgave him but he thinks he could.
But then it's nothing compared to Potter's lips, pressed against his own, the surprised little gasp Harry pushes into his mouth.
They looked out for each other as much as they looked out for themselves, they were ones of the very few Slytherins who has returned this year and it was mutual comfort and trust and
Luna raises her eyebrows at him and Harry is secretly proud of himself for surprising her. It's not an easy thing to do, after all.
And apparently, it does. Draco's shoulders sag as he relaxes slightly, he still tries to feign nonchalance, shrugging him off, and Harry would be cross with him if he couldn't read Draco particularly well by now.
"Why?" Malfoy asks, maybe a bit too defensively, he must have realized that because he lowers his bony shoulders and his expression goes softer. Like he reminds himself that Potter is just being nice. Harry shrugs.
"There is no need, Professor I'm somewhat familiar with gardening," he says, dragging a huge bag of soil closer to the prepared planters on the table. He can't use magic, of course. "But I'll make sure to ask for Malfoy's help if I need it."
Harry has dreamt of Malfoy, on a sunny afternoon, and the Great Lake which would be confusing as it is. Why would Malfoy show up in his dreams after all? In almost a pleasant manner at that. He didn't look too peachy, though.
"Oh, Mr. Malfoy isn't in detention, dear. He's been helping me out quite a bit for a few months now and I have to say it's greatly appreciated!" She beams as he turns to Malfoy, and puts a similarly gloved and possibly even dirtier hand on Draco's shoulder, leaving a dark handprint of soil on his immaculate white shirt.
Harry's chest goes tight again and he's the one picking up his wand this time, but he pays no mind to the Hufflepuffs who start to look bored now that Malfoy ignores the pumpkin juice.
And Potter sliced up his chest with the Sectusempra, leaving ugly marks and Draco still thinks he deserved it to this day. He should be happy he got away with as little as those, actually.
Well, he does look like that nowadays. Tall, but lanky, full of sharp edges as he has always been in the last few years. He doesn't slick his hair back anymore, its still flawless, (not that Harry thinks it looks nice or anything!) but it's been kept a bit long, swept to the side, and curling behind his ear.
He doesn't see it, but he feels Harry's presence hesitate at the door, and Draco imagines him turning around, he feels Harry's eyes on the back of his neck. Why did that send a slight shiver down his spine? "I'll go then, good night, Malfoy."
Malfoy only noticed that it was indeed Harry who had his wand out, and who most likely cast the spell. His eyes went slightly wide when the realization set in and the smile disappeared from his face, to be replaced by his usual scowl.
"Are you offering me a truce, Potter?" He asks eventually and looks at Harry, eyebrows delicately raised. There is also a flush to his cheeks, and the tip of his ears Harry finds incredibly endearing.
There is no one to please now, only himself and it's somehow even more difficult. There is guilt and high expectations, and the desire to do right,
And that's different, isn't it? But he aimed to be exactly that, this year. Something authentic and more to what he pretended to be for all these years, to please his father.
Draco must truly look gobsmacked because Harry laughs. He laughs and it doesn't rearrange Malfoy's insides completely.
No matter how many times he's been startled awake by the nightmares, his heart races the same and there are tear marks on his cheeks. He always lays there, head full of various images of the War, or lately, full of Draco Malfoy.
When Harry has been sent to the Hogwarts greenhouses he didn't expect to find one Draco Malfoy there, his normally pristine hands covered in soil, nearly to the elbow where his sleeves were rolled up to.
How many times did Draco lay awake at night as a little boy, in the Slytherin dorms? Envy of them, angry at Potter for rejecting him, missing his mother. Nobody knew about these instances, of course, Draco has kept all this to himself. What would have the others thought of him if they saw Draco crying like a baby?
"No, of course not! I'm pretty sure Malfoy isn't up to anything, Hermione," Harry cuts her off. He loves her, but he didn't catch enough sleep to be lectured right now. "I just... Doesn't he look sad?"
"I was, yes. But you can have it, I'll do Transfiguration later." He answers, voice neutral and Harry wishes he would show any emotion at all because Malfoy is fucking impossible to read.
"Excellent, I'll leave you to it then, I will check up on you later," she smiles at them both, even Malfoy.
But in turn, he helps Draco with his Charms assignments, well, they compare their homework because Draco is not so sure about some of his answers. That alone, him admitting that to Harry counted as huge progress!
It's a terrifying realization that brings relief at the same time, it's a conclusion to all those years and complicated feelings, the hatred, that completely disappeared by now, morphed into careful affection and fondness for the other.
Harry has to tip his head back, in somewhat of an uncomfortable position due to their height difference, though it doesn't seem to bother him. Draco wouldn't know, he's too busy going pliant and melty in Potter's arms right as their tongues meet.
like this, who is Draco to tell his arms what to do? Or his throat, letting out a happy, genuine laugh he isn't used to hearing coming from him?
Potter also gave his wand back, and Draco felt somewhat whole again, touching the wood, the magic flew through his veins and thrummed in the tip of his fingers as if he was missing a limb before that he has gotten back now.
Draco looks around and straightens his back, frown deepening on his features. Harry follows his gaze, spotting the two malicious Hufflepuffs, snickering, one of them does nothing to even try to hide his wand that he uses to manipulate the jug of pumpkin juice and annoy Malfoy.
