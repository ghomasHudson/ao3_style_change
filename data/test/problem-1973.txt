“Huh.” Harry held up the phial to the light to peruse the blue contents. “I wish I’d known that second year. Polyjuice tastes absolutely awful.”
The train blew its whistle, making him jump, and Draco collected his things and began the walk to the carriages. Maybe if he’s lucky, he’ll get one all to himself since everyone else was already on the way to the school.
“Nothing grand,” replied Harry amicably. “Living with my aunt and uncle and cousin, who all had a strong disliking for me. Wearing hand me down clothes, sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs, being pushed around. The usual.”
“Close the window.”
“Ma mère m’a appris quand j’étais petit.” he responded, and Harry shook his head at him.
“Draco, darling, this is my sister. Andromeda.” She led him back over to Andromeda, and Harry took the opportunity to go pick up Teddy, who exclaimed when he saw Harry and
“So what’s your team?” prodded Draco, and smiled smugly when his knight bashed Weasley’s pawn.
He hadn’t really planned on saying what he had, it’d just kind of...slipped out. Harry had been apprehensive for a second- please don’t run away, don’t get panicked about this, he’d been thinking wildly- but for once his random blurting had turned out to be a good thing. And furthermore, Draco had said he loved Harry. It was blowing Harry’s mind.
“Do you want to be a teacher after you graduate?” asked Amelie as they sat down. She seemed unfazed to be with Harry Potter, something Harry appreciated.
“I don’t care if you’re sorry.” he said coldly, and Daphne toed the ground next to him.
He writes a few meandering lines, pausing to consider a passage of his textbook, chancing small glances across the table. Malfoy’s still writing steadily, and Harry recognized the Potions essay that was due next week. There were dots of black ink splattered on Malfoy’s thin fingers, and Harry wondered at that fact when everything around Malfoy was so neat and cleanly organized.
“...so Luna- you know Luna Lovegood-” he said. “She’s a girl from our school,” Harry added to the Beauxbatons students. “She did it for me. She did one for Draco, too.”
“No it isn’t,” he teased. “Maybe for your delicate Gryffindor senses it is.” Harry smirked back, letting his eyes wander over Draco’s face until the Slytherin had a slight flush in his pale cheeks. Harry leaned in slowly, grazing his lips over Draco’s softly, barely touching, before pulling back and continuing to walk to class. He glanced over his shoulder, grinning, and saw a blushing, indignant Draco catching up with him.
“Alright. Apology accepted.” Harry said, and with a look at him Ron and Hermione echo his words. Malfoy nodded uncertainly, and turned to leave. The trio watch him exit the library, and Daphne rushed after him, throwing a hurried smile their way.
Draco’s first thought was that Beauxbatons was beautiful.
“Stop it,” he hissed, and Harry smirked.
“That sounds cool.” she said. “This program is pretty lax, really. We take turns instructing the class, with the professor looking on, and every week we go and spend the class at a nearby local magic school for younger kids, and act as teacher’s assistants and things like that. It’s not hard, but it’s good practice.”
Madam Maxime sat, the students followed, and soon began to eat. The gentle murmurings of conversation gradually filled the hall, and the Hogwarts students sat themselves down at a table, somewhat hesitantly.
“I know, I was there.” Harry reminded him. “And Madam Pomfrey fixed it in about two seconds, you prat. If anything he slashed your pride.” Draco huffed, but there was a gleam of amusement in his grey eyes.
“Thanks.” replied Harry, still a little flushed from the attention. “How’s yours coming?” he asked, as the teacher directed the class to split up into pairs and practice the charm.
“So,” Harry began.
“I would ask you how last night went, but I’ll hazard a guess at well?” asked Daphne as they jogged up a staircase. Draco flushed but didn’t say anything, and Daphne playfully knocked her shoulder into his.
“Nothing.” answered Potter, raising his eyebrows slightly. Draco turned away and glared at the wall.
“Seating chart on the wall, everyone.” called the professor at the front of the classroom, and Draco blinked in surprise. They’ve never had seating charts before. He strolled over to the piece of parchment on the wall and scanned it for his name. It’s next to Potter’s. He scoffed softly and eyed the back of Potter’s head. Daphne’s already walking to her seat beside some seventh year Ravenclaw.
“I love you too,” Draco replied softly. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand, and Draco let him, with a roll of his eyes. And they walked back to the castle, hands linked. Together.
“Merlin, don’t ever do that again.” Harry murmured. “I thought I wouldn’t reach you in time.” Draco let his head drop forward.
“He looked like he needed a friend.” she said simply, and Harry nodded. The two walked back to the common room in companionable silence, both thinking over the other’s words, and the blond boy lying in the hospital.
“I wish it would snow,” commented Daphne wistfully, sitting by the window and gazing out of it. Camille looked up from where she’d been practicing a charm, Amelie next to her.
“Me too.” she responded.
“Fancy a game of chess, Weasley?” said Draco airily. He’s decided to be the bigger person for this confrontation. “Potter says you’re a decent player. As long as you’re better than
Soon the steady, slow rhythm of Draco’s breathing lulled Harry into sleep, and he dreamed of Patronuses, a silvery stag and a translucent Abraxan frolicking around each other, racing through the trees.
“Where is it?” Draco lifted his wand, and caused a beam of light to run out of it. He used it like a pointer, going from one star to the next in graceful lines and swoops. Harry
“So how did you two become friends?” asked Narcissa politely, her curious grey eyes so like Draco’s. Harry looked pointedly at Draco, who coughed and started to talk. They’d agreed it was probably better for him to explain it to his mother.
“Yeah,” Harry replied quietly. “It was.”
“I’m Teddy’s godfather, and Andromeda let me stay with her over the summer. She’s very kind, and Teddy’s wonderful.” said Harry, smiling, and Draco blinked.
“Really?”
“Hey.” Draco looked up to see Harry, leaning against the next column with his hair wonderfully ruffled and messy.
“It’s nice to see you again.” said Theo, leaning against the wall. “You look great.”
“Come look in the mirror, Draco,” exclaimed Camille, taking his hand and drawing him up off of the bed. He let her, feeling the knot in his stomach tighten. Harry was in there. Could Draco even trust himself next to him, not to fuck anything up? He swallowed, but let himself be led into the cramped bathroom, looked up into the mirror.
Draco cut Harry off. “No, it’s alright. I see mainly the same things you do. The dead. Him. What I did. I started taking the potion over the summer.” he replied quietly. Draco can hear the rustle of the fall leaves outside, and he saw the moonlight glint off of Harry’s glasses on his bedside table.
Harry stood up and join Daphne and Draco at the other end of the table.
“So how’s this map work?” Draco asked nonchalantly, and Potter dug around in his trunk. He came up with a blank piece of parchment and tapped it with his wand.
“...Fine, Daphne.”
“So that’s why they- well, you- were acting so weird that one night.” Draco exclaimed. “They came in fifteen minutes later saying they last thing they remembered was eating some sweet and then they woke up stuffed in a broom closet. I thought they’d gone round the twist.”
“It was weird for me too, at first. But during the day this clearing is sunny, and it almost feels like a different place.” Harry nodded thoughtfully. “We can leave if you want,” offered Draco, a little ashamed he hadn’t remembered earlier.
“But why are we friends? Why do you want to be friends with a Death Eater?” Draco burst out, his voice cracking on this question that had been burning him up from the inside. “I don’t- I don’t understand how you can forgive me for what I’ve done.” Draco felt the sharp burn of tears pricking his eyes, and he looked away from Potter’s bright gaze.
“Alright. She sold the house. Moved in with her sister. Wants me to come with her sometime to visit my father.” Draco responds, staring out across the water. It was relatively choppy tonight, stirred into motion by the spring breeze blowing at their backs.
“Er…” he says. It was excruciating to sit there under the blond’s curious gaze, and Harry has never been good at excuses. And apparently he wasn’t as inconspicuous as he’d thought when he would watch Malfoy in class, or the hallways. Bloody brilliant. “Have I?” he replies weakly, fidgeting with the edge of his parchment. Malfoy tilts his head slightly and Harry knows he sees right through Harry’s attempt at playing dumb.
So Draco made his decision. He surged forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s, knocking him onto his back. Draco kissed him fiercely, straddling him as Harry’s hands moved from his face to his back, running up and down in long, sweeping strokes that set Draco on fire. Harry’s tongue parted Draco’s lips, and with a soft gasp Draco opened his mouth to him.
He said a polite goodbye to Professor Suri after scheduling another meeting to begin working on his project, sending a fervent prayer up to the sky that it would work, and that he would be done in time for Christmas.
“Promise me you’ll be careful,” she whispered, under the cover of the two boys arguing loudly behind her. “With other students. I don’t want to see you or Draco get hurt by
He’d already told them one thing about France- his encounters with Theo, to Pansy’s cackles and Blaise’s snorts. He wasn’t too enthusiastic about telling them about Harry.
The next morning Draco awoke, groggily blinking at the light streaming in from the window, the gauzy, see-through curtains fluttering. He’d eyed those curtains last night, knowing they were too thin to be anything but decoration. Someone knocked on their door.
At the end of class the professor announced the homework and dismissed them.Harry and Hermione made their way down to the Great Hall and joined Ron at lunch.
“Hello, class, my name is Mr. Harry-” he shot Amelie a glare- “and today Ms. Amelie and I will be teaching you about the countries in the world! Now, who can tell me a country that they know?” A smattering of hands went up, and Harry called on a little boy named Adam.
“If you want,” agreed Luna. “Or I could do one for you?” Draco smiled and shook his head.
Definitely not now, decided Harry as he ascended a staircase. He pondered the questions, his feet moving as if on autopilot.
Draco sat through a long day of classes, but found his mind kept wandering to three things. First, Luna Lovegood. Harry had hinted that she would agree to give him a tattoo, and had even agreed to help him find Luna so he could ask her for the favor, but Draco was hesitant. Facing the girl who’d been locked up in the basement of his house for months...even if he had helped her, he still was not sure he should bother her. Why should she forgive him, do anything for him?
“What are you smirking about?” came a familiar voice, and Draco looked up to see Harry and Hermione making their way through the portrait hole.
They talk for a little while more, before Hagrid goes to feed Buckbeak and they tag along. They walk through the forest behind Hagrid’s hut until the trees open into a wide meadow, where tall grasses wave in the breeze and sunlight played over the ground.
“Alright,” replied Draco grudgingly. “I feel like Hermione wouldn’t mind a romantic gesture. Maybe… fancy dinner in Hogsmeade? I dunno. Something that shows you put a lot of thought into it. Or if she’s ever talked about a hobby, or something she’s interested in besides the usual...something that shows you pay attention to what she says?”
“Can’t sleep. Or I don’t feel like sleeping.” Harry replies, and Malfoy quirked an eyebrow before standing up gracefully. The table before him was clear of all of his things. Harry hadn’t noticed him cleaning up to leave.
“Alright class, today is the weekly trip down to the primary school, so everyone follow down to the carriages.” announced the teacher, and Harry was distracted momentarily.
The staircase they were on began to move, and they paused halfway up, waiting for it to settle. Once it did, the stone sliding into place with a small scrape, Harry and Draco jogged up the staircase and entered another hall. Their footsteps were in time, noticed Harry. He glanced over at Draco as they stopped in front of the dragon.
“You’ve already packed?” he asked in surprise, spotting Draco’s trunk sitting closed on his bed. Draco nodded, leaning against the wall.
“Not to me. It’s black-”
“Not really. My brain’s just frazzled from this book we had to read for Potions.” Draco said wryly, tapping the cover with a finger.
As the train started to move, they talk about Hogwarts.
“Draco. Nice to meet you as well.” he answered smoothly. Camille then greeted Harry.
“How was it with Greengrass?” Hermione whispered to him under the noise of scratching quills, and Harry glanced at her.
Those three months had been blessedly peaceful, but Harry had stayed up in his room, thinking on many things. Grieving, for one. He felt sometimes as if he would never be able to look back on the memories of the fallen without feeling as if the Whomping Willow had socked him in the stomach. They never left his thoughts.
“This chair is too small.” complained Draco half-heartedly as he reached for his coffee.
“Let’s just ask Hermione later.” he muttered, and Harry nodded agreement. Ten minutes go by, and more than half of the class looked as lost as Harry felt. He glanced to his right and saw Hermione scribbling away, and hastened to look like he’s taking notes, but the only thing that came to mind were Oliver Wood’s Quidditch maneuvers to use against Ravenclaw, so Harry wrote those down slowly as Professor Flitwick continued to talk.
“Should we go?” Draco said, somewhat unenthusiastically. It was so peaceful up here, it was just them and the forest. No people, no noise.
“That’s understandable though.” said Hermione reasonably, snagging a roast potato off of Ron’s plate and popping it into her mouth, ignoring Ron’s protests. “I mean, you leave tonight!”
“I felt kind of bad about coming on this trip, and leaving Mother all alone for the holidays,” mused Draco. “But her letters said she was talking to her sister again, so I’m glad she won’t necessarily be alone, what with her sister and the baby.”
“Are you alright? You look like you’ve just seen a ghost.” Draco continued, amusement woven through his voice. Harry shoved down all of his nervous feelings. Act normal.
“Sure.” muttered Draco, and disappeared into the crowd. Harry frowned after him, but Amelie tugged him over to where Camille had snagged a table. They weaved through the crowd, a bass beat thrumming through the room. Harry could feel it, and was suddenly glad they were there. He had a urge to go join the knot of people on the dance floor, to be in the middle of everything. He was also relieved to see that his makeup look fit in here, as lots of people had extravagant looks.
“I’ll fix it,” promised Harry. “You start the next step.” Malfoy blinked, probably because for once Harry is telling Malfoy what to do in Potions and not the other way around, but he nodded and began pouring a measure of some blue liquid. The two boys work together in silence, occasionally saying something to the other in regards to the potion. But Harry didn’t mind the quiet. It’s a comfortable silence, like when he and Ron had finished talking before bed, back when they were still in the Gryffindor common room.
“I think this’ll be good for you, Harry. Plus you could do the teaching program there! I remember how much you loved teaching the DA.”
“Harry,” said Draco, his eyes still wide. “We- we can’t do this.”
“That’s good of them, I suppose,” Hermione said, casting a slightly disdainful look over at Pansy. “I’ll tell Ron tomorrow, and talk to Daphne about it.”
“Listen to her, she’s very wise,” added Draco, and Harry sighed exaggeratedly. “A please would be nice, by the way.”
Yes, I know Subway Surfers and cell phones were not things of the ‘90’s. But here they are anyway. ;)
Even though Draco had complained about being questioned by his mother about his relationship, he did miss her. And if he was honest, he wouldn’t mind if she did talk with him about it. It had been so long since they’d properly talked about anything, really. And he really was grateful for her.
Because Draco had seen Fawkes in that clearing, where they’d gone stargazing once. He’d said he went there a lot when he needed to be alone, and Harry had found one of the phoenix’s feathers lying in the grass. That was when Draco had clammed up, and when Harry had asked about Fawkes Draco had merely said he’d seen him the day before, in the clearing, but Harry had gotten the feeling Draco had been withholding something. Harry was still curious about that, now that he thought about it.
book he’d seen in Malfoy’s school bag.
Draco didn’t say anything, but chose to keep what he probably saw as a dignified silence. But Harry saw the corners of his mouth turn up slightly, in the small smile that Harry adored.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” Draco said, and waited impatiently for the ink to fill in. Once it did, he unfolded all of the sections of the Map and searched for Luna’s name.
Harry held out a hand from where he was standing on the edge of the ice, and Draco grabbed it, clinging to him like a lifeline as he stepped on and immediately slipped. Draco yelped, his feet moving wildly for a steady surface. Harry was chuckling, and Draco glared at him when he managed to stand, his arms held out wide in the hopes he would stay balanced.
“What if we visited together? You could see your mom, and meet Andromeda and Teddy. And I could see Andromeda and Teddy. And we could tell them about- well- us.” Harry suggested, plunking down next to him on the bed. Draco tilted his head.
“And me?” prompted Daphne, and Draco laughed.
“No…” Draco turned his head at the quiet murmur. “Don’t kill him...please don’t kill him…” It broke Draco’s heart to hear the small, broken voice that’s coming out of Harry, and he hastened to get up.
Harry followed Amelie to a spacious classroom. It must be at the top of the school, he thought, because there were skylights on the ceilings, making the room bright and airy.
Harry adjusts his glasses, which had been slipping down the bridge of his nose. Gazing up at the moon once again, his eyes skimming over the faint, discolored craters and spots that peppered it. It reminds him of Remus.
“Do you stay up like this all the time?”
“Okay, yes, you fixed the Vanishing Cabinet. That maybe wasn’t a great idea. But if you hadn’t, you and your family would have died. You were scared. I get that. But it all comes back to Voldemort. You wouldn’t have done any bad things just by yourself, if he hadn’t existed, right? You aren’t an evil person. Just a normal person, pushed into bad situations and bad decisions.”
As the portrait hole closed behind him, he stared at a round room, vastly different from the Slytherin Common Room. For one thing, it was a ghastly shade of orange. And the couches, arranged around a merrily dancing fireplace, were purple.
“Leave it.” she chided softly, and met Draco’s eyes. He could see that she knows why he went off by himself, because he had done the same thing in sixth year and in a moment of
“Blame my father for my hair.” Draco said dryly. “It’s a Malfoy standard. I know for a fact my grandfather made my cousin bleach his hair because it was too dark and not on par with his expectations.” Harry chuckled before unwrapping his arms from around Draco and going to lug his trunk out from under his bed.
“Merlin, I hate goodbyes,” he murmured, looking a little forlorn as they waved one last time to their Beauxbatons friends before following the other exchange students, and Madam Maxime, out of the dining hall. Daphne came and took hold of Draco’s other hand, so that she and Harry were on either side of the blond. Harry sighed.
It was odd, knowing that you had the power to influence other people like that. Knowing that just the right words could impact Draco so greatly. It made Harry a little hesitant, because having that influence was something that he didn’t know that he wanted, or could control. He didn’t want to do something to bring that broken look back into Draco’s eyes.
Harry put his hand up; as did Amelie and a few other people in the class. Draco’s hand stayed down next to him.
“Then you don’t need your glasses, do you?” Draco pointed out, and through blurry vision Harry saw Draco put his glasses on. “Yikes, nevermind. Your eyesight is really horrible.”
“Well than get off your whiny ass, Draco, because I am taking you ice skating.” ordered Harry, staring at him pointedly. Draco sighed.
“No, he only agreed to one year.” pointed out Ron. “Right Harry?”
“Oh, yeah. Come on Daphne. Bye, you two,” he said over his shoulder to Harry and Camille, the latter waving indulgently while Harry just grinned at him. Draco turned his head
“Alright, you’re on, Potter. If you want to lose.” Harry grinned back.
“So, dancing.” said Harry. “I really can’t dance.” Harry smiled crookedly at Draco, who felt a wave of fondness for him.
“The Conjunctio Cordis spell- or the heart linking spell- creates a magical link between the hearts and health of two people. It has been used to save someone dying from a wound or curse by linking the wounded’s heart and health with that of a healthy person. This will cause the wounded person to heal much faster and remove any curses from their person. However, it is extremely difficult to cast and can result in the death of both the healthy and wounded person if done incorrectly. If done correctly, the wounded person should begin to heal, wake, or be free from any curses. Note, however, that after the first initial use, where the healthy person helps to heal the wounded person while remaining healthy, whatever wound, pain, curse, or disease that impacts one person will also equally impact the other, and if one of them dies, so will the other. This spell is irremovable.”
“That was really good,” commented Draco.
“You always tap your fingers on something. Like you’re playing.” Harry explains, and the ghost of a smile flits across Malfoy’s face.
“What are you thinking of?” asked Harry quietly.
“Actually, yeah, most nights I do.”
After dinner, all of the eighth years were holed up in the common room. Harry’s on the sofa with Ron, Hermione, Neville and Dean, talking about the new professors.
“Here, you can take mine.” he offered, and she smiled.
The flames flashing vivid green, bright and blinding, just like when Harry had died and the last thing he’d seen was a green light, overtaking his vision as Voldemort laughed-
Harry put quill to paper again, trying to put the blond out of his head. One thing he knew for certain was that he trusted Malfoy now. Harry could confidently rule out anything like what Malfoy had done in sixth year.
“Well, maybe I exaggerated.” amended Draco.
“Oh,” said Ron, looking rather as though he’d been struck over the head with a broomstick. Hermione was still beaming at the pair of them next to Ron.
“Don’t sound so disappointed, Harry. It’ll be wonderful. Amelie and Camille know what they’re doing, make-up wise.” Harry shook his head in disbelief.
Harry grinned as he spotted a familiar wicker basket. “Hermione, is that what I think it is?”
“That’s what you get for stealing my blankets this morning. Plus Pansy isn’t around from me to steal from.” replied Draco poshly, and they all laughed. Simon caught Draco’s eye a few minutes later and smiled at him, and Draco smiled back almost instinctively. Simon was very attractive, after all. Calm down, Draco scolded himself. You already have one crush, don’t get ahead of yourself.
He leaned in to press a quick kiss to Harry’s lips, but gasped involuntarily when Harry surged forward, his hands coming to Draco’s waist and pulling him closer, his fingers tight, like he thought Draco would disappear if he let go. Draco parted his lips and stifled a moan when Harry’s tongue tangled with his, but soon realized that this was not their normal sort of kiss. Harry was taking control of it, pressing Draco into the bed and kissing him intensely. Draco’s head was spinning, and he couldn’t stop himself from whimpering when Harry licked at a spot on his neck.
“You were taking so long, I thought I’d come and help you out.” Harry said smoothly, grinning. Merlin. I’m going to murder my boyfriend, thought Draco in exasperation. He should have known Harry would want to do something like this. He supposed he was at least glad that Harry wasn’t quite dumb enough to kiss him in front of all the eighth years.
And when he’d opened the door to see Draco, it had been so difficult to keep himself from unabashedly staring. Difficult to act normal, act like all they were were friends. He’d managed, and every little laugh or smile from the Slytherin was like a beacon in a storm, like Harry was lost and Draco was all he could focus on.
“Hey, there you are.” Harry appeared out of the knot of students, and Draco stepped over to him. “McGonagall dropped me off and went back to Hogwarts. This place is gorgeous.”
“Another bloody announcement,” Ron muttered. “At this rate we’ll be here till morning.”
“You’re a phoenix aren’t you?” whispered Draco. “Dumbledore’s phoenix?”
Ron frowned skeptically. “Could he really have changed that much, though?”
He finally managed to skate over to Harry and with a yelp fell on him, clutching a surprised Harry by the shoulders. Draco’s relieved when Harry helped him up and kept his hands around Draco’s hips, a steadying presence. Draco’s breathing was a little heavy, like he’d been running.
“For once, I agree with Granger.” added Draco.
“I guess… I guess I just wanted it to be over. I wanted Lovegood out of the cell, I wanted all the Death Eaters out of my house.” Malfoy spoke to the floor, and Harry’s astounded at the raw emotion pouring from him. That, and the fact that he had cared enough about Luna to want her in a better place.
“You are alright, right?” asked Draco quietly. Harry glanced at him.
So Harry was now of the same mindset as Hermione. Yes, Malfoy had been a git and made bad decisions, but it wasn’t entirely his fault. And he had changed, it was obvious. Harry remembered another girl’s words about Malfoy, Daphne’s words when he’d asked her why she decided to befriend Malfoy.
“Thanks,” said Harry. “I could’ve gotten this myself, though.” Draco decided to ignore that last bit.
As the Slytherin had also asked, Harry hadn’t drawn attention to Malfoy’s disappearance. Hermione and Ron had questioned him at lunch, but Harry had said, truthfully, that he didn’t know where the blond had disappeared off to. Harry had seen Daphne Greengrass looking worried, and remembered how she’d greeted Malfoy the last time he had come back from a day of being missing. She probably knew more than Harry about where Malfoy was, but like him, chose not to fuss about it.
“No,” he answered, but his tone is a little softer now.
The phoenix sung again in response, before emitting a low humming sound. Draco reached out a tentative hand and when nothing happened, lay his hand gently on the phoenix. He gasped.
“It reminds me of Lockhart, for one thing.”
“Well, if you need anything to help with them, come talk to me, ok? My mom had panic attacks, so I know which medicines help.” She mussed his hair affectionately.
“It’s too cold for that.”
“...staying in dorms of two. You will get to choose who your dorm partner is, though obviously they must be of the same gender as yourself. Now, are there any questions?”
“We aren’t having a test, though, are we?”
Draco pushed at his chest a little, and Harry pulled back. He was panting slightly, they both were, Harry could see Draco underneath of him, hair messy and cheeks flushed and lips parted, drawing in breath after breath. He looked bloody gorgeous.
“There you go.” Draco tossed the phial to Harry, who caught it with the skill of a Seeker.
“Yeah.” agreed Harry, standing up. They walked back to their dorm room, shoulders brushing, fingers intertwined between them.
“Eyeliner is makeup, Harry.” said Draco, sniggering.
His professor had a thoughtful look on his face, and Draco waited with bated breath. He had lied when he said “for instance”. He wanted to try to make something that would help Harry during his panic attacks. The idea had struck him while they’d sat in the carriage returning to Beauxbatons that day, but he wasn’t sure if it was even possible. Hence the meeting.
“...called Hogsmeade, and everyone over third year can go there on pre scheduled weekends. Is there anything like that here?” Draco said, and Simon grinned.
“Draco?” The other boy looked up disinterestedly, a glass dangling from his fingers.
Harry snarled softly. He was completely and utterly fucked.
“I said yes, that’s us. And you’re pronouncing it horrendously.” Draco smirked, amused.
“Oh, Draco?” called Daphne as they go their separate ways. “Can you meet me in the library around two? I found a book we can use for the Transfiguration homework.” He eyed her with suspicion. She’s definitely been planning something since yesterday.
“Expecto Patronum,” he said clearly, and the silvery, translucent light that Harry knew so well streamed from the point of Draco’s wand. It wasn’t forming a shield this time, nor just insubstantial wisps of magic, it looked to be actually weaving into the shape of Draco’s patronus. Harry grinned, glad for Draco. He’d been so frustrated about not getting it.
“I know,” he murmured softly, the vibrations of his voice rumbling over Draco’s skin, making him shiver. “I’m sorry.” he continued, kissing Draco again, softly this time, his hands sweeping gently over Draco’s skin.
Harry was next to Draco as they stood outside in a clear section of the grounds, a chill permeating the air. The sky was a clear, deep blue, not a cloud in sight. Most of the trees and bushes had dropped their leaves, their bare branches making patterns against the sky and the ground.
“Actually, neither.” said Harry slightly nervously, finishing the (decent) french braid and tying it off with a hair tie, his fingers resting at the base of Draco’s neck. Amelie had gotten him a pack of hair ties for Christmas, so Daphne could teach Harry how to braid Draco’s hair. Or so Amelie had said. “It’s more of a so, can we talk about you blaming yourself for every single bad thing that stems from the war?”
“Don’t worry, you will.” she said. “So will Harry, when Amelie’s done.” Harry sighed and relented.
“We’re quite sure, yes, but there is a small chance this might not work.” replied a Healer.
“Yeah.” replied Harry, amused. Draco shook his head and muttered something under his breath before letting out a great sigh.
“Adorable.” repeated Daphne, shaking her head, and laughed when Draco told her to shut up.
He and Ginny, they’d tried to get back together. But both of them had drifted apart. Now they were just friends, and Ginny was dating Luna. He was happy for them.
“Bloody Finnegan.” he muttered mutinously, downing the potion and barely stopping himself from gagging. It does help his head, though, he admitted to himself grudgingly.
“Expecto Patronum,” he said clearly, and felt a sense of wonder as a stream of silvery, translucent light shot out of his wand. He kept the spell going, trying to see if it would take the form of a Patronus, but it remained only a wisp of light. Draco lowered his wand, suddenly tired.
“Why is yours so neat?” chortled Harry, holding up the immaculately wrapped package.
“Yeah. I assume you want to do the actual Apparating?”
“...Ok, fine,” sighed Harry. He could tell there was no getting out of this.
“Hello Hagrid,” replied Harry with a grin.
“Friends.” Weasley repeated sarcastically, and Potter sat up.
“Where the hell were you all day?” she exclaimed, hugging him tightly. “We thought you’d died or something!”
“Please do, his hair does seem long enough.” Harry replied, and Daphne smiled triumphantly at Draco. Merlin. Draco sighed heavily and turned back around, resigned to his fate. His hair wasn’t even that long. It was like he’d had it in fourth year, but it wasn’t long.
“Don’t tell me you’re attached to the room,” teased Draco, his grey eyes sparkling as he walked back to Harry.
“You might have white hair, but don’t worry, you aren’t ancient yet.” joked Harry, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“Ferula,” repeated Daphne, but nothing happened. She frowned.
“No, I don’t need anyone’s help,” said Draco primly.
The blond girl whispered in Malfoy’s ear, and he snapped something under his breath. Harry and Hermione exchanged a glance. There was a very big chance that this would end in some sort of conflict- Harry could almost feel the tension that was so tightly strung around them. Daphne stood up, and when Malfoy stood as well she shoved him back down, and Ron stifled a snort at the look on the blond boy’s face.
“You were in your own world for a moment there,” Harry teased, and Draco bit his lip.
“Draco’s really good at the Healer stuff,” Daphne said, leaning over him. Draco flushed. “He did all the spells we learned perfectly, first try.” Simon nodded agreement.
“I was surprised to see you here. I come here often.” said Nott in a smooth voice.
“I think the letter’s long enough,” he declared, adding a quick We miss you, Merry Christmas to the end, and signed his name, passing the parchment and quill over to Harry so he could sign also.
“I could’ve done more,” he repeated, but sank backwards into Harry’s embrace.
Ron frowned. “Really? He didn’t give you any trouble?”
They worked in that manner for the next half hour, until Draco let out a great sigh and sat back in his seat.
“Hey.” came Harry’s drowsy voice, and Draco glanced over his shoulder to see him awake, sitting on his bed and watching Draco with a soft smile and a sparkle in his eyes. Draco would never be tired of seeing the way Harry’s eyes lit up when they looked at each other. It was magical.
“I was your extra Christmas present,” teased Harry, and Draco smacked Harry’s leg. Harry laughed.
“We should probably head back up now, before Filch locks the doors.” Harry said, somewhat regretfully. It was nice out here, lying under the stars.
“Draco, you know I can’t speak French.” complained Harry, looking over his shoulder. Draco blushed, his body turned away from Harry, facing the window.
“Harry?”
How had Harry forgotten it was Halloween? The room was bedecked with grinning, floating pumpkins, and the ghosts flew up and down the aisles. Harry saw the Bloody Baron stab a student with his see-through sword, and cackle as the student turned and berated him for it. Bats fluttered amongst the rafters, and the false sky was dark and cloudy, with a full moon shining between the grey wisps of cloud. Candles were dispersed amongst the pumpkins, and Harry spotted skeletons jerkily moving on the sides of the room. The tables were groaning with rich food, and the three of them hastened to the eighth year table to sit and eat.
“Camille, you can come finish.” Daphne called, and Draco sat on the bed, feeling very much like the bedazzled outside of him didn’t fit the lonely soul he felt like right now.
“A foot of Potions,” Harry replied. “On dragon claw. Damn, I’ll have to go to the library,” he adds, as he rifled through his Potions book. “Not enough stuff in here. Bye.”
“Why didn’t I know about this?” exclaimed Camille delightedly, and Draco smirked.
“Just fucking kiss me, you tease!” demanded Draco, turning around and dropping the mirror, and Harry smirked before doing so.
“How was flying?” she asked, closing a book and flipping through another one.
“Merlin, yes. I want to be there for that.”
“Draco! Harry! There you are!” exclaimed Camille, looking very pretty in robes of pale silver. They stepped inside the ballroom. It was decorated lavishly with exquisite ice sculptures, as Amelie had described, and glittering crystal chandeliers. There were neat holly branches and red ribbons twisting around the columns, and magical icicles hanging from staircase railings. All together it painted quite a festive picture, and it distracted Draco momentarily from what he’d been talking about with Harry just earlier.
He loved these times with Draco, when it was just the two of them and he could hold the blond, just hold him. And talk to him. Harry didn’t mind what they talked about, he mainly just liked hearing Draco’s voice. It was soothing, and he reckoned he could probably fall asleep if Draco talked for long enough.
He turned and saw Hermione running towards him, and she engulfed him in a tight hug. He returned it, slightly baffled.
“Yes,” said Hermione, her cheeks pinking a little.
Harry was studying Draco’s face, and Draco fidgeted. “You’re not telling me something.” said Harry softly. Draco sighed. Of course the other boy could read him.
“Stay?”
Draco flushed again. “Those ones aren’t very good, and I needed the practice anyway,” he mumbled, but Harry noticed Daphne still scrutinizing the blond with interest.
“So how was it in France otherwise?” asked Blaise, a cool tone of disinterest in his voice. But then again, he always sounded like that. His father had some things in common with Draco’s father; molding your child exactly how you wanted them. The only difference was that Blaise’s father was not currently locked up in Azkaban.
After dinner, Draco and Camille went to go to study in the library, and Harry took the opportunity to pull Daphne aside. He hadn’t been able to think of anything to get Draco for Christmas, but an idea had struck him- of doing something with him, not buying him something. Harry was inspired by the memory of when they had stargazed together, and Amelie had told him that there was supposed to be a meteor shower on the night of the ball, so Harry was thinking of bringing Draco out to watch. He wanted to run it by Daphne, though, as she was Draco’s closest friend at Beauxbatons aside from Harry.
Eager faces crammed around Harry, and he felt stifled as he tried to get to the train. People were talking and shouting over each other, so many he couldn’t make out individual words at all. Hands scrabbled at his jacket, wanting to be near the Savior of the Wizarding World, as they had dubbed him. Another title. How he hated the titles.
“Harry? You ready?” Amelie said from behind him, and Harry turned around.
“Yes, I wouldn’t be here if Daphne hadn’t dragged me,” answered Malfoy, somewhat grudgingly. “But I do feel sorry for how I’ve treated you in the past. I’m sorry I was such a brat, and that I called you a Mudblood. It wasn’t right. And I am sorry that I couldn’t stop my aunt from hurting you.” Hermione observed him stonily, but Harry saw her fingers stray to a place on her arm, where he knew the scar from Bellatrix lay under her shirtsleeve.
“Daphne’s told us about your sixth year fiasco,” said Simon, grinning. “The whole dinner crowd walking in on you two?” He motioned to Nott, who laughed, and then to Draco, who downed another Firewhisky with an increasingly ill-tempered expression. Harry frowned slightly. Draco was acting weird. Harry had never seen him drink before, but here he was, slamming them back. And usually Draco would’ve shot back at Simon by now for bringing this up yet again, but he wasn’t. Something was definitely bothering the blond.
“Cold, cold, cold.” he chanted under his breath as he stood up, shivering, and Harry chuckled. “You prat!”
“Happy Halloween to all of you,” she said. “Now, could all of the eighth years leaving for Beauxbatons tonight please stay behind. The rest of you may go on to your dorms.” The students at the House tables began to trickle out.
“Because I like calling people I don’t hate by their first names,” replied Hermione airily, and Malfoy shook his head at her but smiled slightly.
“What, purebloods never have picnics?” he commented incredulously.
“Charms, with Neville and Dean. Professor Flitwick had us reviewing non-verbal spells.” Ron bit into a chicken leg. “Some seventh year accidentally blew out a window. You two had Transfiguration, right? How was that new professor?”
“No chance.” replied Harry smugly, and Draco huffed, but his heart was beating a staccato rhythm against his ribs, like a bird dashing against the bars of a birdcage, trying to get out and fly free.
He made his way to the Great Hall, dodging Peeves, who was cackling as he dropped inkwells onto the shrieking students in the hallway. A few prefects were bellowing at him, and some people were screaming as they dove out of the line of fire. Harry held his bag over his head and ducked around a corner before entering the Great Hall.
Harry smiled ruefully.
Harry felt the solid weight of Draco’s hands on his shoulders, and he let his breathing slow down before he raised his shaky gaze to meet the blond’s cool grey eyes.
A minute later they were in the air, flying lazily underneath the blanket of stars, watching the light shoot by. Harry glanced over at Draco, who was practicing loops and dives and Seeker’s tricks, but always with his face turned to watch the sky. Harry directed his broom with light pressure from his hands and flew up alongside Draco.
Harry blinked. “Er. Because I didn’t want it to hit you?” he said, and Draco rolled his eyes, crossing his arms.
“Brilliant. I’ll send it off today, with our presents for them.” Harry replied, accepting Draco’s change of subject, and setting the letter on his bedside table. Draco made a mental note to get his presents for Hermione and Weasley separate from the others he had wrapped and needed to send off. They’d spent a rather enjoyable hour or two yesterday wrapping and comparing presents for their mutual friends, although Draco’d had a job wrapping Harry’s presents with him nosing in and trying to see what they were.
“Why is this so fucking difficult?” muttered Harry under his breath as he wandered the aisles of the shop that he and Draco were in. He was trying to think of something to get Draco for Christmas, but had been drawing a blank for the past half hour on any objects that Draco wanted or needed. Nothing for school, or quidditch, and Harry knew if he tried to get Draco clothes it probably wouldn’t be up to stack with his normal attire. Draco didn’t collect anything, and all his hobbies or interests were something Harry had already considered.
“So why’d you scurry over here? Potter looked a little confused,” she snickered.
“Oh- Harry!” Hermione came over and greeted him. “Hey, Draco.” Malfoy coughed.
Harry rolled his eyes with a slight smile. “Sure, Healer Draco.” Draco raised his eyebrows but left.
“Ingredients, yeah. What page is the recipe?”
“I can’t believe we leave today,” commented Harry as he slid on his glasses.
“The eighth years have a special opportunity. This year we will be conducting an exchange trip with the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.”
Harry sat down on his bed and tugged Draco down next to him, pressing his lips to Draco’s. Draco leaned into the kiss, it was something familiar now, more comforting than being in the castle again- the castle was no longer comforting so much as intimidating, because of the people inside. They’d riot, for Merlin’s sake. Probably say he’d bewitched Harry with Dark Magic or some fuckery like that. Draco sighed, and Harry pulled back slightly.
Harry had huffed in frustration. No explanation, only a request to take notes. He supposed he should be thankful Malfoy had said please.
Harry was glad Draco wasn’t angry with him, but he still wanted to talk with him about this later.
“Can I sit here?” he asks. Malfoy’s eyes are unreadable. There’s an awkward pause before Malfoy nodded, the movement small and quick. Harry releases a quiet breath and drew out the chair before beginning to work on his essay, pretending like he wasn’t distracted by Malfoy opposite him.
Harry offers him a small smile, feeling a nervous fluttering in his stomach. Malfoy looks at him a second longer before walking past him, leaving the courtyard. Harry gets the sense it would be alright if he followed. So he does.
“Which knowing you, means perfect,” said Daphne with a grin, knocking into his shoulder. Draco knocked her right back. “What did you smell?”
“I’m fine, Harry.” whispered Draco, supporting his head with his hand. “Go back to sleep.”
“You’re no fun.” responded Harry, the suggestion of a pout in his voice.
“And,” Draco went on, shaking, “I- I tortured people. I could’ve done better, done more to help, so many people died, Harry. There were bodies on the floor of my house. There were people locked in the dungeons of my house. And I had to go about like they weren’t there.”
“Alright.” he said, for once in his life completely sure of something. Yes, he wanted to be with Harry. Harry was the one he loved, the person that kept him going, that had helped him and listened to him and understood him and forgiven him. The person that had shown him a better life.
“That’s good,” Harry commented. “I like the cinnamon.” Camille smiled in satisfaction.
“Dunno.”
“I’m in the Healer program, you two are actually going to be shadowing me,” said Simon with a grin, motioning to Draco and Daphne, who smiled back. Draco was glad to be
“Thanks, Headmistress.” he replied, and the Headmistress nodded at them once more before striding off to speak with the Healers with Madam Pomfrey over in the corner.
The two walked back to the common room in a comfortable silence, but it felt heavier than normal. As if both of them knew that they both had things left unsaid.
“I hope the boys are just as wonderful,” sighed Daphne, and Draco snickered.
“I spaced out, sorry.” lied Harry, blurting out the first excuse that came to mind. His cheeks were warm. Draco smirked a little, clearly amused, before gazing out the window again. Harry did the same, staring determinedly out of the opposite window.
Draco sighed, letting his eyes flutter shut. Tonight would be a much-needed distraction, then. A knock came on the door and Draco sat up, hearing the muffled voices of the girls. Harry jumped up and let them in, and Camille, Amelie, and Daphne streamed in, giggling at some joke. Simon strolled in after them, his arms full of makeup bags, and Draco quirked an eyebrow at him.
“Anything I can do,” Harry whispered. “Let me know.”
He turned his attention back to Draco, and a strange, warm feeling coursed through him when he realized Draco had fallen asleep. His breathing was deep and slow, and every now and then he let a small, snuffling sigh. It was adorable.
He shoved his way through the throngs of Muggles, letting his anger at all of this be his shield, and stepped through the barrier with no hesitation.
“Oh, hold on. I’ll meet you at the carriages in a second, I have to deliver a letter.” he said suddenly, remembering the letter to Ron and Hermione tucked away in his robes. He dashed down the cobblestone street to the mail office, where he quickly paid for a mail-owl use and gave a snowy white owl his letter. “Hermione Granger, Hogwarts.” he told it, and felt a pang of nostalgia as the owl flew off. It looked very similar to Hedwig.
“Brilliant.” he replied, settling into his blanket-cave. “I should get sick more often, if it means Draco Malfoy fetches me breakfast.” Draco chuckled but left before Harry saw the flush on his cheeks.
“Yes?” he answered, a little nervously.
“I don’t, I just- don’t want you to have to deal with shit because of me.” muttered Draco, looking away, at the portraits adorning the walls, fixing his gaze on a portrait of three warlocks in large ruffled collars, sitting at a desk and writing with elaborate quills.
“I’m really sorry, Draco,” began Pansy forlornly, and Blaise and Daphne quiet. Draco stared stonily at her, his happier mood dissipated. He'd forgiven Daphne, but he considered what Pansy had done to be different. He'd thought he could trust her with something personal.
“Seamus.” murmured Thomas. “Leave him alone, mate.”
“Potter, you did not just eat my dessert.” Harry gave him another rakish grin, one that made his toes curl, but then Harry snatched Draco’s cup and kept eating it. “You thieving commoner bastard!” exclaimed Draco, punctuating each word with a smack on Harry’s arm with Amelie’s book. Amelie sighed from next to Harry and shook her head at them.
“Have you been down here a lot?” questioned Draco. Harry seemed quite familiar with the room and the house-elves.
Harry broke the kiss and pressed his forehead against Draco’s so that they almost shared breaths. His hands were still stroking slowly up and down Draco’s sides, making his brain go fuzzy.
“Well, you two have always been, well, a big presence in each other’s lives. It’s just changed from a negative presence to a positive one,” Hermione said matter-of-factly. Draco blinked at her, and so did Harry.
“Like you’re examining me!”
“No, it’s fine,” replied Harry with a slight smile.
“Is that cologne?” he asked incredulously.
“Hey, can you help me with the Transfiguration essay?”
“Potter!”
“It was nice of him, though. He’s a good friend. Even if he randomly talks in French when he knows I can’t understand him.” replied Harry with amusement, shrugging, and he saw her blink rapidly, like she’d realized something. “What?”
“Well, he doesn’t call me Mudblood anymore. He’s apologized to us, doesn’t insult… I think some things have changed for the better.” answered Hermione. “Let’s just see what happens.”
“Yes, you tosser.” responded Draco, somewhat snidely. He leaned forward, taking off Harry’s glasses, and kissed Harry once more, open mouthed and softly, sweetly. He nipped Harry’s bottom lip gently, winding his arms around Harry’s neck, and laughed into Harry’s mouth when Harry snarled and flipped them over again; his mouth descending on
“What did you say?” asked Daphne, repeating what he’d said and butchering it completely.
“Merci. Now,” she continued, beginning to smooth something on his face with a soft brush. “Anything specific you want?”
Draco had been a little stingy after they finished the potion, though, mused Harry as they entered the Great Hall, but forgot all about Draco when he beheld the Hall.
he thought.
“That was actually quite fun this time,” remarked Harry, and Amelie grinned.
thought Draco for the thousandth time, lying on his back on his bed. It was nighttime, and Draco could hear the pitter-patter of raindrops outside, a steady thrumming that usually calmed him. But right now he was a jittery mess. Draco rolled over, facing the wall.
“Hey Harry, Malfoy.” said Dean, and Harry was a little surprised at his cordial tone when greeting Draco until he remembered Dean had never really had a problem with anyone; it was Seamus that always had some drama going on. Neville waved at Harry and nodded at Draco, who nodded back.
Five minutes later he was sequestered back in the carriages, staring out of the fogged-up pane of glass as the countryside rolled by.
“Yes, but I’ll just get her another one later. She’ll never know.” he replied confidently, and Harry laughed.
and Draco watched the lit-up portion of the box change with fascination.
Harry watched with everyone else, glad to have the attention off of him for a moment. After “Trenton, William - RAVENCLAW!”, McGonagall rose from her seat at the center of the staff table and touched her spoon to her glass, and the students quiet.
“I love you.” he said, and Draco’s answering smile was wonderful. To think that he could make anyone so happy, let alone Draco Malfoy. His gorgeous, charming, witty boyfriend.
“Sorry, sorry.” he said, meeting Harry’s eyes and smiling slightly. Harry’s eyes were wide and bright behind his glasses, and he grinned back before they set off.
Harry thought that those four words that had come out of Draco’s mouth were the most amazing thing he’d heard all his life.
“What?” murmured Harry softly as they stopped in front of the red dragon portrait.
Draco almost wanted to fight it, because if he was being honest with himself he was scared. Scared of his feelings never being reciprocated, scared of messing up and ruining a friendship that he had already come to depend on. He didn’t even know if Harry was gay.
“You can have a future if you want,” Harry says.
“Speaking of other things you didn’t know, Hagrid still has Buckbeak,” announced Harry with a grin, and Draco’s mouth dropped open. Harry chuckled at the look on the other boy’s face.
“Yes, Harry.” Draco replied, leaning his head on Harry’s shoulder as they walked. “Be very proud of yourself. Passed the class with full marks.” he continued airily, and Harry chuckled as they entered the school. “Do you think the ball’s over yet?” he wondered aloud.
thought Harry, then he smirked a little.
“I’ll tell you later.” replied Draco, hopping up as he spotted Harry stepping through the portrait hole. “See you guys.” He strolled over to Harry. “So, d’ya know where Lovegood is?”
“You never change, do you?”
“I know, you git, that’s why I’m asking you.”
“Putrid,” said Daphne Greengrass next to him, wrinkling her nose. “I mean, I guess they didn’t want to use House colors. But this is just horrid.”
“We’re taking him to the hospital wing,” explained Harry.
“Because I felt like it,” retorted Harry, and Draco chuckled.
“Alright. Thanks, Harry.” Draco replied softly. A warm feeling was bubbling up inside of him at being called one of Harry’s best friends, (Draco shoved down the other part of him that complained about how he wasn’t more to Harry) and as they finally found a place among the gardens to practice Draco had to clamp his lips together to stop smiling.
“You’ll have to show me sometime.”
Twenty minutes later, Draco strolled out of the bathroom in his pajamas, and Harry sat up indignantly.
Hermione had a thoughtful look on her face. “I think it’s… interesting. To see exactly how much he’s changed. And if he’s nicer to you, that’s good.”
didn’t expect anyone to, either, but Malfoy retorted.
Harry sat up slowly, giving Draco time to adjust and get into a comfortable position, before reaching for a chocolate and feeding it to Draco. Draco rolled his eyes, but obligingly opened his mouth.
Ten minutes later they were in their first class, and the teacher gave Draco and Daphne their schedules, along with Padma Patil and Sue Li, who had also elected to take the Healer program.
He wanted to be with Draco, he did, but he’d rather fight five Hungarian Horntails than be this stressed and nervous for a whole week. Harry sighed quietly.
“Dunno,” he said. “You’re her boyfriend, you tell me.”
“It was quite enjoyable. I apologized, and we fed the thestrals, and she told me about something called a Nargle. I didn’t want to bother her, but I asked how she did the tattoo, and she offered to do it for me, and I let her.” Draco shrugged, but Harry could tell he was pleased.
“It’s really nice.” Harry replies, filled with the sudden urge to intertwine Malfoy’s fingers with his own. Hold them tight and never let go.
“Move over, you prat,” he ordered, then squeaked when Harry tugged him down onto his lap, leaning against the wall. “Potter!” Harry chuckled, his arms wrapped securely around Draco’s waist, the blond sitting between Harry’s legs, his back against Harry’s chest.
“I’d much prefer being here with you than back at that place, Mother,” he replied. “It’s not like they want me there.”
“Oh, alright. Thanks.” he replied awkwardly.
“Is that even safe?” he asked apprehensively, toeing the edge of the ice.
“I’ve done horrible things, Harry. You don’t get it. People have a right to hate me for what I’ve done, what I was in my past. I’m not just going to go through life without consequences.”
He was about to knock on the bathroom door when it opened, and Harry stepped out. They blinked at each other, and Draco swallowed before holding up the thin envelope.
“Off to France in two days!” exclaimed Ron. “You two ready?” Draco and Harry exchanged a glance, and Harry grinned.
“Alright,” the professor announced ten minutes later. “The spell is Ferula, with a spiral and flick, as such-” he demonstrated, and the class copied him. “-now, practice on each other’s legs or arms.”
“Yeah, during the History of Magic exam. Can you really blame me, though?”
“Of course Malfoy changes the colors of his sheets.” he muttered.
“Philosophical look?” repeated Draco. “That makes me sound ancient, Harry.” Harry offered him a grin, pressing his lips to Draco’s forehead. Draco bit his lip in an effort to keep from smiling. He always complained when Harry did that, saying he only did it to lord over Draco that he was taller than him, but in truth he enjoyed it. The forehead kisses were sweet, comforting.
“Guess we’re the last. We’d better hurry up.” Hermione dropped her trunk with the other luggage and tugged on Ron’s hand. Harry followed them inside, glancing longingly at the quiet forest, knowing he’d be swarmed when they entered the Great Hall. Being famous was cool or whatever, but most of the time Harry wished he was just another kid.
She laughed. “Yes, it’s Crookshanks.” As she goes on talking the basket began to hiss and quake a little. “He had a good time in Australia, but his fur got even harder to manage than my hair.” Ron smiled and twirled a strand of her hair around his finger.
“Please?”
“Well, have a good rest of your day, you two. And Mr. Malfoy, I’d appreciate it if you refrained from hitting my patients next time.” she chided, and Draco felt his cheeks warm a little.
For the first time in weeks, Harry slept through the night.
“Have a nice time?” asked Harry with a grin.
“Don’t worry, I’ll style you.” Camille waved her hand, and Draco blinked. Harry snorted at the expression on his face.
“Go ahead.” Potter yawned. “Then I can nap.” He waved a lazy hand and closed his eyes.
And now walking in on him doing the same thing Harry was, hiding away in a forgotten corner of the school at night. He was just so different than before, and Harry wanted to see it up close. See how he’d changed.
But Harry hadn’t woken up, two days later.
“Yes, Mr. Potter and Ms. Greengrass levitated you in. Alright. You can go down to breakfast whenever you’re ready.”
“They’re so small,” whispered Ron. “Were we that small?” Harry grinned.
“Goodbye,” said Pansy sweetly, and Harry left somewhat gladly, to Blaise’s and Pansy’s snickers and Daphne’s scolding. Well, that could have gone worse, thought Harry wryly as he returned to Hermione’s table.
“What?” asked Draco, looking from Harry to the scars. “Oh.”
“Brilliant, thanks.” said Harry. If he didn’t write soon, Amelie would probably send him a Howler. He chuckled as they passed by a knot of Ravenclaws and went up the steps to their dorm. “Why don’t you like the password?”
“I think you know my answer to that.”
Harry looks back at Ron, who raised an eyebrow and tilts his head towards their normal desk, where they sit near Ernie and Terry. Harry nods, casting one more glance at Malfoy, who’s sitting by himself, head bent over a book. Part of him wants to damn it all and go take the vacant seat next to the Slytherin, but his feet are already following Ron to their normal desk as class begins.
But he had, when he could, enjoyed his time with his friends. Slowly trying to readjust to some semblance of normalcy. Going through the motions of schoolwork, classes. Spending hours with Ron, Hermione. Every now and then he’d do something with Luna, as he appreciated the easy, comfortable silence that she had. Not needing to talk so much like everyone else.
Daphne came up to him and grabbed his arm. “Come on,” she whispered when Draco planted his feet.
“No. Always Latin phrases or-”
“Nothing.” replied Draco, schooling his features into a normal façade. Harry eyed him suspiciously before beginning a conversation with Ron. Draco caught Hermione’s inquisitive eye and sent her a quick smirk and a shrug. She shook her head slightly and returned her attention to her plate.
Harry looked away, an unknown feeling bubbling up inside of him. He had a sneaking suspicion about what was going on with him.
Ron laughed and then coughed as he inhaled glitter. “What about you, mate? Looking for a special someone?”
“Damn!” he exclaimed, turning around. “Oh, you.”
chatting to another Beauxbatons student Harry didn’t know. And Draco, of course, was nowhere to be found.
Draco pushed down his feelings of impatience and tried to be patient.
Hermione tapped his shoulder. “Look at the staff table, new teachers.” Harry nodded, then turned his head to the doors of the Great Hall as the first-years filed in, led by Professor Sprout.
“It’s a waste of time,” he said flatly, turning his quill between his fingers. Draco knew he was frustrated and sore that he hadn’t gotten the spell down yet, and tried not take it out on Harry. Harry sighed.
But if Draco had known civility- hell, ignoring him, even- was this awkward, he wouldn’t have made that promise to himself.
“I believe Ms. Granger could be correct, I think you would be fit for the career of a professor. I saw you signed up for the trip, I recommend you take the teacher’s program at Beauxbatons, Potter.”
Draco could have sobbed in frustration. He was so conflicted, because he wanted to be with Harry, the want was swelling up in a wave inside of him. The kiss had been amazing. Draco had never kissed anyone like that, never felt so out of control and passionate and filled with desire. But he- his past was rising up over his shoulder, reminding him of all the horrible things he’d done, telling him he didn’t deserve this. Deserve Harry.
“Alright, students, it is time for our exchange students to leave us.” announced Madam Maxime from the front of the dining hall. “If the Hogwarts students would please follow me.”
“That is incorrect, Mr. Weasley,” said McGonagall dryly, and Ron flushed.
“Yes.” admitted Draco, dropping his head.
“Because I can’t go out with messy hair! I’d look like you-”
“You have a point.” Harry admitted. “I don’t want that happening to him.”
discovered,” interjected Ron, looking at Hermione, who smiled and flapped her hand.
Harry’s eyes widened and he lunged in front of Draco as a stream of black light shot from the boy’s wand. As he collided with Draco, pushing him aside, the jet of light hit his chest and a feeling like ice spread quickly through Harry’s body. His legs gave out and suddenly his body was hitting the stone floor.
“What do you remember, Harry?” asked Hermione, and he saw Ron enter behind her, his face splitting in a wide grin.
“Hey- Malfoy. Want to come to the library with me? I’m meeting Hermione.”
“Mr. Johnson has been expelled,” said the Headmistress gravely, appearing behind them. “And I have spoken to the students. Anyone who does anything like this again will also be expelled.” Ron nodded mutely, looking intimidated by the presence of the Headmistress. “Good to see you back with us, Potter.” McGonagall said more warmly, and Harry smiled.
“No, the knocked over chess piece look. It’s very creative,” said Harry airily, then yelped when Amelie’s snowball hit his glasses. “Hey!”
He’d obviously wanted Harry to leave, but he hadn’t said anything rude or belittling. Harry shook his head, pushing the puzzle of Malfoy and his erratic moods out of his head. He wanted to finish before dinner.
Seven minutes later he jogged down the front steps of the castle.
“You did it, Draco! That was really good!” he exclaimed, and Draco met his eyes.
“Just how glad I am to be warm again,” Daphne grumbled, her hands shoved deep into her pockets. “I think there’s still snow down my back.” Harry laughed.
“Yes. You know them?”
“Went ahead and got them,” he announced. Draco sniffed.
That evening Draco plunked down next to Daphne for dinner and for only the fourth time in his life, apologized to someone who wasn’t his parents. Potter, Weasley, Granger, and now Daphne.
“I need coffee. And I should be asking you that question.” Harry snickered again, and Draco smiled to himself, secretly glad he’d made Harry laugh.
“What is that?” Draco said, nodding at the knitted yarn. Ron snorted.
“Can’t you tell what I want?” challenged Theo. Draco rolled his eyes, but before he could say anything Theo was kissing him, pressing him against the wall, his tongue tracing the seam of Draco’s lips. Fucking hell. Draco shoved at him, even as part of him wanted to lean into the kiss, it was so familiar. But no. Draco finally broke away and walked out of Theo’s reach.
“Brilliant. You coming, Hermione?” Harry looked at her expectantly and she smiled and shook her head.
“Oi!”
Harry rolled over, listening to the rustling of sheets as both of them got comfortable in their respective beds. Harry’s head was spinning with realization after realization. Memory after memory.
He kindled a fire under his pewter cauldron and set to work. Thirty minutes later, Draco smiled down at the smoothly bubbling potion. It was perfect, of course. Potions was something he loved as much as he now did Healing magic. He scooped some into a phial and vanished the rest, pausing only to clean up his workspace before going back up to his dorm.
“Don’t fall asleep,” Harry chided.
my life and she sure as hell doesn’t want me in hers.” Daphne frowned.
“I think I did,” replied Draco, and Harry chuckled.
“Probably not.” Draco heard Harry chuckle.
“Are you done?” asked Harry, and Draco nodded.
“But if people keep trying to attack him-” he replied, but Blaise cut in.
“Nothing happened before.”
“Any...plans?” She raised her eyebrows at Draco, who sighed.
The blond raised his head and locked eyes with Harry. Draco seemed to search Harry’s eyes, looking for something, and Harry let him, patiently looking into Draco’s wide grey eyes.
“Yes, I have. Stop worrying about me, ‘Mione. I’m alright.” She eyes him for a few seconds before returning to her paper, and Harry stands, suddenly unsatisfied with sitting and watching Ron and Dean play chess. “I’m going to go back to my dorm,” Harry tells Hermione, and waves to Ron before walking out of the Gryffindor common room.
He stayed there for the rest of the morning. When the heat became too much, he retreated into the border of the Forbidden Forest and entered a clearing not too deep inside. It’s
Harry found himself imitating Malfoy, tapping his fingers on the table. He stops hastily when the other boy’s eyes flick to his hand.
Hermione grinned, her eyes brightening. “I don’t think I want to do that either, but there are so many options! I mean, you could study something, like wandlore or Transfiguration, or you could be a shopkeeper or go abroad, or I could even take SPEW further, or-”
“No.” Malfoy responded emotionlessly, cutting up plant roots. Harry waited for him to elaborate, but isn’t surprised when he didn’t. Harry did have an inkling of what this might be about; last night in the common room Malfoy had stormed up the stairs to the dorms, leaving the other three Slytherins behind. When Harry and Dean and Neville had gone up to bed, Malfoy’s curtains had been firmly shut and he’d left before the other boys had awoken in the morning.
The two women took turns questioning the two boys about school, and their exchange trip. They answered patiently, exchanging glances every now and then. Harry itched to go sit next to Draco, but he refrained. At least until they told Narcissa and Andromeda.
“Draco?” Harry’s whisper sounded, and with a silent prayer Draco turned over to face Harry, hoping he hadn’t talked out loud and woken him up or something.
“Because you let me borrow one, remember?”
Daphne gave Draco a subdued smile before they rejoined the group ahead of them, standing in an ornately decorated room with a large and grand fireplace, vividly green flames flickering within. Harry felt a pang of anxiety at the sight of the bright green flames and fingered the necklace he’d gotten from Draco, the smooth, small pendant of a stag sliding through his fingers. Calm washed over him and he took several measured breaths, feeling the anxiety ebb away. He felt Draco’s eyes on him, and the Slytherin squeezed his hand comfortingly. Harry met the concerned grey eyes and smiled.
Draco decided he does not like at all feeling awkward. From a young age his father had taught him to always be cool and collected, to know everything that went on around you, to gain respect and power.
“Not great,” he whispered.
“You okay?” murmured Harry, his eyes searching Draco’s. Draco knew what he was asking about- their discussion from earlier.
“No one’s in trouble. At the start of term I reminded you that I would come back in a week to discuss the exchange trip with Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.” A couple of people nodded. Harry perked up and listened.
“Yeah, alright.” Draco said, and Daphne nodded enthusiastically.
“You better write,” sniffed Hermione as Ron gave him a quick hug.
“Oh-yes,” he said, turning to face her. “I’ll be right down.” She smiled and left, and he heard her footsteps as she descended the stairs, then the happy gurgles of Teddy Lupin. Harry turned to his closed trunk, sitting on the neatly made bed, and lifted it down onto the wooden floor.
“Put me down!” Harry’s arms were holding Draco firmly, and his chest was warm against Draco’s side. Draco ignored the flush rising in his cheeks and battered at Harry’s chest.
“...kind of.”
“Fuck off, Potter!” yelled Draco, laughing.
“We can take this as slow as you want. It’s up to you who we tell, and when.” said Harry, and Draco made a small, sleepy sound of agreement.
lifted his chubby arms. Harry smiled.
“You had a rather nasty blow to your head. Now drink up, there’s a good boy.”
“Hey mate,” exclaimed Ron as he clapped Harry on the back. Hermione rolled her eyes good-naturedly and sat next to Ron, who looked the same as Harry remembered, Hermione did as well.
They stayed out a bit longer, letting Draco practice, but he wasn’t able to get beyond that first stage. By the time they finally went inside, they were both shivering from the cold.
“Do you mind if we go back to the ground?” asked Hermione, her hands white-knuckled on the broomstick. “It’s- very high. And windy. And dark.”
“It wasn’t a real Patronus, though.” Draco sighed. It had taken much more energy than he’d expected, and only for that? He was a little disappointed in himself.
“Alright. Sorry.” he muttered, and with a last motherly smile the hospital wing matron bustled off. Harry stood up and Draco followed him out of the hospital wing.
Malfoy shrugs, the motion smooth and fluid. His fingers were tapping on his thigh.
“Hey,” said Draco as he poured his coffee. “Ooh, croissants.” Daphne and Harry laughed.
Draco stood and walked up the stairs to their dorm, sprawling on his bed as he watches Potter enter the room after him and shut the door.
“Thanks for saving me. At your manor. And before you protest that you didn’t, you did.”
“I found this by the door. Something about a Ball.” he said, hoping Harry couldn’t hear the slight shaking in his voice.
Draco’s mind had gone blank with fear, and the only thought he’d had was No, please no, hold on. Harry. Please don’t leave me. It had felt like a nightmare. Later they’d told him he’d been screaming Harry’s name. Screaming for help.
“A couple times. Fred and George told me about it; they used to come down here and get food for parties and stuff.” Harry explained. The house-elves ran back up to Harry, their arms full of wrapped sandwiches and pastries. “Thank you,” said Harry, and Draco echoed him before they took the food and left. “Do you want to carry any?”
“Hello, you three,” Hagrid said, clapping Hermione on the shoulder so that she almost falls over. “Tea?”
“I used to. Why?”
“Yeah, yeah. When did they say they’d come over?”
“I’m so glad they didn’t strangle each other,” whispered Harry to Hermione as they walk down to the Great Hall. The two of them are slightly behind Ron and Malfoy, who are arguing over whether the Holyhead Harpies would still be top of the league without Gwenog Jones. Hermione smiled a little as she watches them.
“Of course. You can just levitate yourself, or use a Disillusionment Charm. Don’t tell me Gryffindors never sneak out.” Draco said with amusement.
“I think I want to go,” said Harry thoughtfully, and Hermione instantly brightened.
” he exclaimed. “Why the fuck did you jump in front of me? Why were you so extraordinarily stupid?” A small part of his brain registered and filed away the fact that his own cheek was stinging as well. Curious.
“Yeah, I guess. I was hopeless back then.”
“Goodnight, Draco.”
“Ready?” challenged Harry as they mount their brooms, and Malfoy grinned.
He had almost forgotten that he would have to be back with the whole bloody pack of Gryffindors this year. Draco huffed and closed his eyes, somewhat annoyed with himself that he, for lack of a better way to put it, ran away. He can see Potter’s messy dark hair in his mind. It reminded him of someone else’s dark hair, the one person he missed.
“Alright, one at a time. Just say Beauxbatons,” she instructed, and the ten of them formed a line. Parvati, Padma, Sue Li, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Micheal Corner, Ernie Macmillan, and Daphne, Draco, and Harry.
“Honestly, I just want to go to get away.”
“What?” murmured Draco, stirring again.
“Draco, I need my glasses. Give them back,” Harry said, reaching for Draco, but the blond twisted out of his loose grip with a grin.
“Potter what the hell are you- FUCK- doing here?” said Malfoy weakly as he tried to stand, but collapsed as his ankle gave out. Harry lunged forward and caught him by the arm.
So at the end of dinner, when Draco usually showered, Harry took all of his hair products and hid them under his bed, under a handy loose floorboard he’d discovered. It reminded him a lot of his fourth year, when he’d hidden snacks and cakes under a loose floorboard in his bedroom when Dudley, and the whole family, had gone on the diet of what Uncle Vernon had called “rabbit food”. Harry smirked as he remembered all of the tantrums that had shaken the house.
“He asked to talk to me and then he kissed me. I guess Harry didn’t see the part where I pushed him away and told Theo I didn’t like him.” Draco said flatly. He felt awful. Physically and mentally.
A clear, pure note sounds, and Draco’s eyes open instinctively. A bird is spiraling down from the sky, seemingly out of the sun, but it’s feathers are a colorful red-orange. It’s tail is long, almost like a peacock, and as he watched, the bird swooped gracefully down to land in front of him. It’s colors are even more vivid close up, like all the colors of fire painted onto a living canvas. The bird tilted its head, fixing him to the spot with one big dark eye. It opened its beak and made another sound, that somehow manages to hold multitudes of emotions. Sadness, grief, regret, but also joy.
“Have you been sleeping, Harry?” Hermione asks quietly, and he glances at her, giving her a quick smile.
“Crinus Muto,” said Daphne, holding her wand steadily. A bright blue light briefly flashed and Harry’s eyebrows felt like someone had just poured cold water on them. “Hey, it worked.” Daphne said. “Blue eyebrows.” Harry snorted.
“...spent the summer in Croatia.” Neville said. “They had a good summer Herbology program, and I got an invitation for an apprenticeship there for next year.”
Harry doesn’t know what to say, but Daphne’s words resonate. They’re true. “You’re right,” he said to her. “But I think we need to get him to the hospital wing.”
Draco’s head snapped up. Had he heard that right? He’d let his brain wander during McGonagall’s announcements.
talking around him, or that he’d gone looking for Harry tonight, like Harry had gone looking for him.
“Yeah, what’s up?”
But Draco had been distracted somewhat from this by Daphne and Camille’s chatter about the ball, about Simon asking Daphne to the ball, and about Harry’s Christmas present. Draco was proud to say that he was almost done with it; he’d figured out how to embed or imbue a spell into an object, and how to activate it at a certain thing, which he’d made tapping it three times. It had taken a lot of complex spellwork, and some Arithmancy, but he’d done it. Now all he had to do was pick the object and cast the final spells.
“It’s nice, though, I mean- hey!” Harry yelped, his arms coming up in a defensive reflex and blocking the pillow Draco had flung at him.
“Didn’t you hear me, Malfoy? You should go throw yourself off the Astronomy Tower. Do us all a favor.” Draco clenched his jaw but didn’t face Finnegan, though he can hear the other boys trying to calm Finnegan down.
“Expecto Patronum,” he said, flourishing his wand. The silver vapor that emerged was faint, and with a sound of annoyance Draco cut it off. “Expecto Patronum. Expecto Patronum!” he said fiercely, and suddenly Harry knew. It was going to work this time.
“I’ll explain, Harry, listen.” said Hermione somewhat impatiently, and Harry closed his mouth and listened. She repeated her question, and Harry frowned.
“I was in a bad place over the summer.” he whispered, and Harry decided the best thing he could do for Draco was to listen to his words, let him let it out.
Draco made to let go of Harry’s hand, but Harry laced their fingers together with a reassuring smile. Draco bit his lip.
“Oh. When I was here yesterday I saw a phoenix. Must’ve left a feather.” Draco said nonchalantly. The details of what had happened here the other day was something Draco was not going to share with anyone, even Harry, and that was all he was going to say.
“I fucked up tonight.” Draco said. He wiped at his eye, but when he drew his hand away it was smeared with gold. “Fuck.” Daphne pressed her lips together.
“How’s Grawp?” asked Harry, trying his own tea and finding it to have a strong flavor of pumpkin.
Draco turned around and faced Finnegan. Trading insults was something he knew how to do. Even if he knew it wasn’t the smartest thing. “Don’t be jealous, Finnegan. It’s not a good look on you. Nothing is, if I’m being honest.” He saw the anger on the other boy’s face, and felt his own anger rising to match it.
"Goodnight."
“Hey, mate, you’re awake!” he said jubilantly, joining Hermione by Harry’s bedside.
“You’ll have to write to us.” she said, and Harry smiled.
“What is it?” he asked. Draco rubbed the back of his neck as they stepped outside.
“Thanks.”
“Look at that! A thousand yards. I bet none of you could get the little person to run a thousand yards,” Malfoy said, preening.
“Because,” said Draco, as though it was obvious. “I don’t ice skate. It’s- it’s-”
“Malfoy, you are not going to make it up that hill on one foot, even with my help.” Harry said firmly. He could see that the other boy was already tired, and wouldn’t make it up the hill or the various staircases to the hospital wing.
“I fell asleep?” he asked, a small note of trepidation in his voice, and Harry smiled.
Harry chanced another glance at Draco, who was absorbed in his reading. His legs were tucked up underneath him, and his blond hair was swept a little to the side. He was biting his lip as he read, which Harry had noticed a long time ago was something he did a lot, but absentmindedly. His hand was curled around the edge of the book’s cover, while the other one fingered a page, his silver rings bumping silently against the paper. His grey eyes were tilted downwards, so the main impression was of his blond, thick lashes-
The next morning, Draco got up early and wandered the castle. There’s a noticeable chill in the air, and he’s glad for his jumper. Then he entered the Great Hall and snagged a croissant before making his way up to the Headmistress’s office for the career meeting; he was one of the last on the schedule to meet with her, before his classes today.
Potter grinned again, and it caught him off guard. Potter’s never smiled at him before today, and it made his heart do a funny flop as Potter headed off.
After Harry had been hit with the curse he’d sunk to the floor, and Draco had been so shocked. It had all happened so fast. But he’d scrambled to his knees and tried every healing spell he knew, his hands shaking, forgetting all about the boy who’d cursed Harry. But nothing had worked, except a stasis spell he’d learned at Beauxbatons. All the while Harry had been trembling, his limbs jerking, and tears of pain had leaked out of his eyes. The stasis spell had been the only thing that had kept him alive long enough for one of their classmates to walk onto the scene and run for help.
He’d been slipping up more and more this past week, what with the French that Harry kept overhearing, being caught staring at Harry, and the whole Pepper-Up mess. It was getting harder to keep his feelings from showing, especially since Draco was almost one hundred percent sure that Daphne, at least, had noticed.
“I can tell, though.” Harry replied, waving at Dean and Neville, who were talking about some class over on Neville’s bed. They smiled back; they were two of the people who hadn’t been really opposed to Harry and Draco dating. Dean had never really had a problem with Draco, plus he was a very peaceful person. And Draco had apologized to Neville one night in the dorm, so although they weren’t friends, or even friendly, Neville didn’t hate Draco.
Suddenly Draco’s hit by something with the force of a train and he flew backward and cracked his head painfully against the wall. Fucking hell, he thought woozily. Finnegan must’ve flipendo’d him or something. Through blurry eyes, he saw Potter striding angrily down the stairs toward Finnegan, heard muffled voices like he’s underwater.
“Actually,” announced Draco suddenly, his hands white-knuckled in his lap. “Harry and I...we’re, well, we’re dating.” The two women blinked, looking between Harry and Draco with sudden understanding in their eyes.
They’d be linked. Some part of him was scared of that, of the future, especially with this, but... it was Harry.
“Ron’s in detention with Professor Eagry, Dean and Seamus dared him to break a window.” Hermione said, her disapproval of this evident in her voice. Harry chuckled and took out a roll of parchment. He’d have to do this by himself, then. Though Hermione would probably help him if he struggled enough.
“Usually. I wander a bit, but I always end up here.” answered Draco, the question not making him as uncomfortable as he thought it would. He’d already shared so much with Harry, this little bit more felt almost normal to say.
“Watch it, Potty.” Draco replied with a huff, but his lips were curving into a small smile. Harry grinned back.
“I watched last week’s match,” he said, shaking his head. Harry lifted an eyebrow. He hadn’t been going to the school Quidditch games, instead using that time to spend alone with Draco, since most of the school was out on the pitch.
“We should get back to our dorm,” said Draco, gazing out the window at the dark sky.
“I still feel bad about it.”
Harry was walking down to dinner when he saw Draco and Luna walking in together, and hurried up to join them.
“And a necklace?” said Harry, smiling slightly bemusedly. Draco grinned, unfolding his long legs and flopping down onto Harry’s bed next to him.
Harry chuckled, his green eyes sparkling.
“None of your business, Potter.” Malfoy growled, clutching his ankle. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Now will you come with me?” he said, fingers still wrapped around Draco’s waist. Draco took a steadying breath, as all common sense and self control had left him as soon as Harry’s lips had met his own. As usual.
“What’s up with you?” asked Harry patiently. It was hard, dealing with Draco when he was like this. But Harry didn’t mind so much. He’d had his fair share of bad days.
“At least it’s not some commoner name like Harry.” Hermione chuckled.
“Git.” he muttered.
With a pop, Harry and Draco materialized in front of Andromeda’s house. Harry had guided them this time, since Draco had never been to Andromeda’s house, let alone met her.
“Fanged Geranium,” he said morosely, and the portrait swung open. They stepped through, Harry secretly scanning for anyone looking as though they’d been outside. He could ask Hermione if she’d seen anyone come in before them, as she was sitting at her normal desk in the common room and looked as though she’d been there for a while, but if it wasn’t an eighth year Harry didn’t have a clue how to find the culprit.
The moon was round, hanging low in the dark sky. The soft glow cast light on the rough stone floor where Harry was sitting, in front of the window that gazed out upon the Black Lake.
“They were really good. Second, behind the Harpies. I love the Falcons but Jones is a brilliant player,” enthused Draco. Finally he’s found something like common ground with Weasley.
“It’s weird being back in here. The forest. Last time I was here I died.”
Weasley let out an impressively lengthy sigh. “Fine, ‘Mione.” With that final word the three tramp back over to where Draco lounged on the couch, Weasley looking disgruntled.
“That’s a good look on you.” commented Harry, a laugh interwoven in his voice. Draco raised his eyebrows.
Hermione made a vague excuse and dragged Ron away and out of the Hospital Wing, leaving the two of them to sit in silence.
Harry and Ron both ate generous helpings as they talked to the other eighth years.
“...actually I like being his friend, Ronald…” Draco smiled at that. I like being your friend too, Hermione, and for the record I think you can do better than that red-headed twat, he replied back to her in his head.
“But let’s remember to use our indoor voices, alright?” added Amelie, and Harry pressed his lips together to keep from laughing.
And now… now Draco’s seated next to Potter in Potions, and he didn’t really know how to act. From the looks of it, neither does Potter. They’re both treading lightly around each other, and Draco wanted nothing more than to leave this horrible situation.
Daphne rolled her eyes and fluttered her fingers good-bye before heading up the small staircase to the girl’s dorms.
“If you say so,” replied Harry vaguely. He didn’t want to get philosophical again, especially about his and Draco’s ‘presences’ in each other lives. He’d leave that to Hermione.
“Sorry.” he replied, not at all sorry, but satisfied with the way he’d made Draco blush. Draco glared at him again, before turning his attention away and back to Camille.
“Bye, Draco.” Draco was still looking at Harry as he said it. His eyes were mesmerizing, captivating, and it took a great deal of effort to turn and walk away to Daphne’s side.
“You think it’ll be like the Yule ball we had?” he asked, stepping around Draco, who’s eyes caught on Harry’s before sweeping away. A slight smell of vanilla was seeping from Harry, as well as the bathroom, and Draco cursed it silently, cursed how the warm, vanilla scented steam was wrapping around him like a blanket. Cursed the fact that he rather enjoyed the sensation.
“I didn’t think you remembered that,” said Potter finally, out of breath. Draco rolls his eyes.
“Invisibility Cloak, remember? It’s very useful.” Harry sat up and faced Draco, who grinned at his comment. Harry smiled back, and they looked at each other for a moment, before Draco swept his gaze away from Harry’s, off to the side. Harry cleared his throat, dismissing the slightly lost feeling, and rummaged in his trunk for his Cloak. He drew the silvery fabric out, and Draco watched.
“Yeah, it is. Steam’s rising in spirals, mother-of-pearl sheen.” he agreed, sitting back down, and Harry congratulates himself on not messing it up.
“Who’s as smart as you.” finished Ron with a roll of his eyes and a smile. Hermione laughed.
“Sorry. I tried.” he replied, tugging on his shoes. “Alright, let’s go down.” Draco and Harry walked down to the dining hall, and Draco was relieved to see that Harry was acting as normal as ever. Like yesterday had never happened. Which Draco was glad about, because it meant that they were still friends, still good friends. And his secret was still safe.
“See? I told you I’d win.” Draco bragged, smirking. He glanced over at the other boy and almost does a double take. Potter’s hair is brilliantly windswept and he’s grinning at Draco, and he looked gorgeous.
story of Weasley and Hermione’s fight third year, over the cat and a rat.
“It’s not like I had much chance,” Draco said defensively. “The only person I know that’s younger than me is Astoria.”
“Goodbye, then. Have a wonderful time.”
“Is that Subway Surfers, Hermione?” Harry said incredulously. He remembered vividly when Dudley, on his 12nth birthday while Harry was home for the summer, got a phone and downloaded that game, then proceeded to lose so badly he threw the phone out of his window. Harry only remembered because he had been forced to weed the garden underneath the window by Aunt Petunia and the phone had hit him on the head.
“I know Draco won’t want protecting,” she continued. “But maybe one of us three should stay with him. So he’s not alone and people won’t try to target him for being with you. I’m not sure all of it will just be verbal slander that you can just ignore, Harry.”
“Don’t be afraid, they’re quite gentle really. People tend to avoid them because they’re…”
“I have one.” Draco announced quietly. He was thinking of one of the days he, Hermione, and Harry had been in the library. Harry nodded.
Ah. Now Draco remembered the events of last night. Finnegan yelling, being blown into a wall, Daphne, Potter, and a blank period where he must’ve fallen unconscious.
“Daphne, I know there’s more you want to say. Spit it out.”
“Well don’t ever do that again,” Draco bit out. You scared the shit out of me.
Draco groaned softly and leaned his head against the cold window as they trundled up to the school. Everyone in the carriage was quiet, sleepy. Daphne was the only one who knew what had happened to Draco, and Draco wanted to keep it that way. He could feel her eyes on him now; he knew she was worried. He was always making her worried.
“Pansy, be nice,” chided Daphne, and Blaise sniggered.
“I never said I didn’t like it,” responded Draco huffily, dropping his bag on his bed.
“Yeah, of course we’ll write,” replied Draco, throwing an arm around Camille, who gave him a slightly watery smile and leaned into the hug.
“Congrats, Neville!” exclaimed Hermione, and Neville grinned self-consciously.
“I think so. He hasn’t said otherwise, and he still lives in the flat above the shop.” answered Ron. “We didn’t see him as much as usual this summer.”
“We probably should. But I don’t really want to. It’s so...quiet. Calm.” admitted Harry, leaning against the window, and Draco smiled, glad Harry shared his sentiments.
“What, are you surprised?” retorted Draco, opening his present from Pansy to find an expensive cologne that he liked and a note from her ordering him to write back more often. He snorted, and Harry looked over.
“Harry! Draco!” said someone loudly, and Harry had a quick, confused impression of Hermione running flat out at them before he was wrapped in a tight, rib-cracking hug. It seemed Hermione had one arm around Harry and one around Draco, because Draco’s shoulder was digging into Harry’s uncomfortably.
“But people will talk, they won’t like it, I don’t want you to deal with that because of me-” protested Draco weakly, and Harry could almost see the jumble of thoughts and emotions behind his eyes, a jumble that mirrored his own.
Harry had woken up early this morning, mind ever fixated on the dream he’d had last night. Everything about last night, actually. From the major things, like his talk with Draco, to the small details, like how the moonlight had lit up the gold around Draco’s eyes. Made a halo of his hair. The sound of his voice.
The first thing Harry noticed when he woke up was the peculiar sensation. Just barely there, but it felt like he had two heartbeats. Felt like they were both in time together, beating together.
filled with lush green plants and the soft chirping of hidden birds. Peaceful.
“Well,” he said. “The things I remember most- most fondly, I suppose, were teatimes with Mother. When it was just me and her, things were much simpler. No expectations, nothing to be worried about. She always asked about my day, and let me talk and talk as much as I wanted. We used to sneak out at night and she would spread a blanket on the lawn and point out my constellation.” Draco reminisced, a soft smile on his face.
“Hey, Harry.” she said, looking up from her work. “Why do you have your broom?”
There’s another silence, and Draco peeked at Potter out of the corner of his eye. The other boy is watching him curiously, and Draco flushed and stared at his desk.
“He sent me a note at lunch today, but all it said was to take notes for him and not to make a fuss. Harry dug in his schoolbag for the note and hands it to her. She scanned it before giving it back.
“Oh, fuck off.” Draco sat back in his seat. “Shall I tell them your story then, Daphne? When your sister walked in on you and the older man getting it on?” Pansy and Blaise laughed, and Daphne colored.
“No, why?” answered Daphne, a curious glint in her eyes, and Pansy echoed her.
“Not really.” He paused. “Though I used to dislike her because she was Muggleborn. I cared about that too much when I was little.”
“Have you and him always been friends?” he asked.
“It was my dad’s, a sort of family heirloom, I guess. But he lent it to Dumbledore before they died, and in first year Dumbledore gave it to me for Christmas, anonymously.” explained Harry. He stood up and drew the Cloak over himself, and Draco made a slightly awed noise.
“Why does he want to talk to you?” exclaimed Harry, fury in his green eyes. He was clenching the letter tightly, wrinkling it as though he was imagining it was Theo’s neck.
“Because it just happened, nosy.” he retorted, his hand tightening on Harry’s. Amelie butted into the conversation.
“Professor McGonagall-”
Harry sighs softly and trails his fingers along the cool stone wall, recentering himself. Shaking away those past memories. Focusing on the sensations here and now. The slightly stale air, as the windows didn’t appear in these corridors. The sounds of his own feet as he walked. The rough, cool stone under his hands.
“That’s the thing I could see myself doing, yeah.” he replied. Amelie was pretty nice. “I taught a sort of club in my fifth year, instructed a bunch of other students in Defense Against the Dark Arts spells, because our teacher in that year was absolute rubbish.” She laughed.
Harry sat down in the common room, by the window. The light outside was rapidly declining; the sun sinking behind the trees. He was alone in the common room except for Susan Bones and Sue Li; Harry knew that Hermione and Ron were in the library, they’d told him at lunch. Harry pulled out his Charms homework and tried to work on it, but in vain. That little worry in the back of his head that had been there all day was nagging at him, the worry about Malfoy. Because they were friends now, and tentative friendships or not Harry was concerned that one of his friends had been missing all day, and had told no one where he was.
Malfoy doesn’t say anything, just continues to watch Harry skittishly, his eyes darting around the room. Harry has the feeling that if there had been more than one way into the classroom, Malfoy would already have bolted away, but Harry was standing in front of the only door.
“No, I shouldn’t.”
Harry grabbed his cloak and hurried out of the dorm with the Map and his wand.
They’d found the Ravenclaw boy who’d cast the curse, a sixth year named Donovan Johnson, and when Draco had seen him enter the hospital wing under guard of two professors, it had taken Blaise and Ron to hold him back from just killing the boy then and there.
“True. Can you get my slippers?”
He’d been so full of relief and joy and losing himself within the kiss that when he’d pulled back and seen Draco beneath him, looking so beautiful, he’d spoken in Parseltongue accidentally.
As soon as they left lunch and were inside their dorm Draco positively pounced on him, pulling Harry close with a quiet desperation and kissing him, his hands raking through Harry’s hair. Harry responded equally as enthusiastically. This was all he’d been thinking about for the past hour, and it was so much better in real life than in his head.
“Well, shall we be off, then? Since we’re Apparating together?” said Draco, a sparkle of anticipation in his eyes. Harry smiled.
“Oh- yeah.” He tugged on the heavy wooden door and she levitated Malfoy through it. Inside, neat rows of hospital beds lined both sides of the room, and Madam Pomfrey was leaning over a small girl with a cast on her arm. She looked up at their footsteps, and when she saw the unconscious Malfoy she quickly strode over to them.
“Not at all. It was odd.” She shrugged, and Ron changed the topic.
“You’re very dramatic.”
“Look, a phoenix feather. Must be from Fawkes. McGonagall said he was still at Hogwarts.” Harry held up a red feather, and Draco coughed. He’d almost forgotten about what happened yesterday.
“Hey, Ron,” replied Harry, glad to see his best mate but still confused. “What-”
When he reached the top of the rock spur that the tower is perched on, he entered and found the window that looked out over the Black Lake and sat, his legs hanging out of the window. The school owls hoot softly behind him, and one of them flew inquisitively to perch on Draco’s knee. It’s a handsome owl, with tawny feathers and keen yellow eyes, and he stroked it softly. The owl hooted quietly in appreciation.
“Well, in her defense, we do have our NEWT exams this year,” he pointed out, and alarmed comprehension dawned on Harry’s face.
“Oh- nothing. I’ve just remembered an essay that’s due next week that I need to start on,” she answered with a smile, which Harry returned. But his thoughts were racing. She was keeping something from him, so was Draco. But what was it, and why?
Harry thought, smiling to himself.
“I’m well, thanks. You?”
“Oh! I do remember one time. It was during summer vacation three years ago, and my parents and Astoria and I were in Switzerland. There was this handsome bloke working at a shop there a year older than me-”
The next night Harry goes down to the courtyard again, and Malfoy’s already there.
“So tell me,” said Draco drowsily. “What did Harry Potter do before he came to Hogwarts?” Harry smiled slightly and shook his head. They were cuddled up together on Harry’s bed after dinner, and Harry was warm and fighting to keep from sleeping, and Draco seemed to be doing the same.
Harry appreciated this brief moment in which he and Malfoy shared this one thing, knowing that in the morning the other boy will probably act like this never happened.
“I’m Harry.” he said, and Draco wondered what it was like for him, to just be Harry and not Harry Potter, the Saviour of the Wizarding World. Draco smiled wryly to himself. Probably a similar feeling to just being Draco, instead of Draco Malfoy, the ex-Death Eater whose father was in Azkaban.
“Well, shall we go down to the Halloween feast, then?” announced Pansy loudly, fending off Daphne’s questions, and they all agreed.
“Yes, but-” Draco sighed, his head tilted back, eyes closing, before he remembered what he was trying to say. “Merlin, Harry, stop it, I can’t concentrate,” he protested, and Harry laughed, the sound low and sexy, sending a flush to Draco’s cheeks.
But suddenly the Patronus stopped coming together, and the light ceased coming from Draco’s wand, and Harry looked over in confusion at the blond in time to see his eyes flutter shut, and Draco crumpled to the ground.
“It changed from sixth year,” commented Harry, and Draco felt a leap of curiosity. “The first two are still the same, but the last one smells...minty, instead of flowery.” Draco nodded, trying to appear nonchalant, but his insides were burning with a question that neither of them could really answer- what did those scents signify? Was there a possibility… no. No use in getting his hopes up.
Harry nodded. “Thanks.” He was glad she had given a warning, as trivial as it seemed- over the summer Andromeda had done the same thing with her wand suddenly to fix his glasses and Harry had been struck by a panic attack. Flashbacks of the war had imprinted themselves on his eyes in vivid color and he had shakily fallen onto a nearby armchair.
Harry sat down next to him and wrapped his arms around Draco, enveloping him in a warm, reassuring embrace. It felt like the only real thing here. Something wet slipped off his chin and he raised trembling fingers, touching his chin and seeing the smear of blood on them. A piece of his broom must have hit him on the way down.
“You’re like a child,” muttered Draco into his pillow. “A hyper child. No wonder I always used to make fun of you.”
“If you shut up,” Draco murmured, returning to his notes, and Harry sat back in his seat, relieved. Now he just had to look like he was taking notes. Much easier.
Draco glanced at Harry, who thought that that sounded brilliant.
Merlin. Harry exhaled. The knowledge hit him like a train; hard, fast, and all at once.
Merlin, how would he fix this? He’d fucking driven Harry back to the school because he’d been a bitch to one of his closest friends. And for some reason that Draco’s hazy brain couldn’t comprehend, Theo kissing him had been the final straw for Harry. Or something.
“Last time she had words with someone they came out of it with two black eyes and a cracked rib.” Draco said conversationally.
But then someone was pressing kisses to his neck, and Draco smiled, rolling over to see Harry, grinning.
“Where did you get this?” murmured Draco, his fingers grazing over the scar Harry had gotten from Umbridge in his fifth year. I must not tell lies.
“Hey, love,” came a lazy voice from behind them, and Harry dropped down next to them, a mischievous smirk printed on his face. Draco glared at him.
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy,” she said, peering over her glasses at Draco, who finished off Pansy’s bacon hastily. “Good to have you back. Here’s your schedule.”
Harry nodded agreement vaguely. He can’t get the haunted look in Malfoy’s eyes out of his mind. Because it’s so similar to what he sees in another person’s face. His own.
Draco woke up slowly, blinking through his fuzzy vision.
Camille was perched on her bed, Daphne and Amelie on either side. Simon was lounging in an armchair nearby, Harry was sitting in another chair, and Draco was sitting on the floor, in between Harry’s legs. Harry’s fingers were absentmindedly playing with Draco’s hair, something that Draco thought felt quite nice, though he wouldn’t ever tell Harry that. It was warm and cozy inside the dorm room, and Draco was pleasantly comfortable.
“Simon asked me where I learned and I said my mother taught me when I was little.” he explained. Harry nodded.
Harry couldn’t stop thinking about him, couldn’t stop going over every memory. It was intoxicating and intense and crazy, and Harry didn’t mind at all.
“It’s not my fault you’re too slow to stop me,” said Harry smugly, and Draco stared him down. “Fine, here’s a new one.” He plunked a new cup down in front of Draco, who sniffed in disgust but began to eat.
“Merlin, Potter! Be more careful, this is powdered dragon claw. It would have exploded if the glass shattered.” The other boy had an amused expression on his face and Draco glared at him as he set the tiny jar of dragon claw down.
“Yeah.” agreed Harry, hoping against hope that nothing would happen. Suddenly he understood how Draco felt when he had said he didn’t want Harry dealing with shit because of him. Now Harry was the one not wanting Draco to be an even bigger target for resentful students because they were dating.
“Yeah,” Harry replied casually. He swapped a look with Draco, who’s eyes were sparkling merrily at the withheld secret. “But we left the ball early.” Harry continued, noting Hermione’s keen eyes flicking between him and Draco with curiosity.
“Yep. Muggle technology is really advanced.”
“Didn’t you write to us about a ball, or something?” asked Ron, his words somewhat muffled by the food in front of his mouth. Hermione shot him an exasperated look and Harry snickered. It was like nothing had changed-not that he'd expected it to. At least, with Hermione and Ron.
“What?”
“Excuse me,” he said, but no one listened, and the crowd pushed in at him from all directions, and he had to shut his eyes for a second.
“Potter, are you smelling me?” Draco raised his eyebrows, but Harry saw a hint of a smile of his face.
“Hey- hey. Harry. Look at me.” Draco’s voice sounded far off, like he was rooms away. Harry was inhaling quick, shallow, scared breaths, and he suddenly realized his hand was pressed to his scar, not because it hurt but as a reflex from the past. “It’s alright. Breathe. You’re safe; you’re alive. It’s alright.” The other boy’s voice was steady, calm, and Harry latched onto it like a lifeline and let it pull him out of his head.
“Be nice!” Daphne smacked Pansy’s arm, and Pansy stuck out her tongue.
“Why do you care?” Draco asked quietly, warring with himself. He wanted desperately to confide in someone, in the boy sitting next to him. At the same time he was trying to restrain himself, because some inner voice still protested that no, Draco shouldn’t tell him anything.
“Excuse me? Harry?” came a small, high-pitched voice from behind him. Harry turned around and saw the kids from before, a Gryffindor boy and girl. “Could-could I get your autograph?”
“Er-what?” Harry shook himself out of his thoughts.
“Another year at Hogwarts,” she began, with a warm smile. “To all of our first years, welcome. To all of our returning students, welcome back. Now, please enjoy your feast.” She sat down and the tables filled with food.
“What did he say?”
He’d certainly looked different, thought Harry, staring out of the carriage window at the murky twilight. Malfoy hadn’t looked so ill as he had during the war. He’d left his hair alone, for another thing. A bit taller too..
“Wasn’t this invented by Muggles? Who wants to slide around on ice, anyway? Not me,” he muttered. Harry was grinning, but he held out his hand again and Draco wrinkled his nose at the gesture.
“I assume you don’t want darling Draco to know about this little chat?” Pansy smirked.
“Does he like you?” Daphne finished the eyeliner, and Draco felt a lump in his throat as he chuckled, trying to be nonchalant, to seem like that question wasn’t one he pondered night and day.
“Normally Muggle technology doesn’t work around magic, but sometimes it will. There we go.” She extended the phone to Draco, who held it gingerly. It’s smooth like metal, or plastic, and on the screen is a moving scene of a man in a bulky white suit taking big, leaping strides across some ground of white-ish grey rock. “That’s Neil Armstrong. He’s on the moon. That’s why he can jump like that, gravity is lessened there.”
Ten minutes later Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Malfoy pick their way down to the Quidditch Pitch, all of the boys with brooms in hand. Harry carried a Snitch in the other hand- the
“My name is Maddy, and I like chocolate,” replied a tallish blond girl. They went around the room, and all together there were around fifteen kids, all 9 years old. Amelie motioned for Harry to join her at the front of the class, which he did.
“Draco!” came Harry’s voice again, and Draco hastened to drop his sleeve and join Harry outside.
“Brilliant,” said Harry, who was weary of all the talking and scheming and his boyfriend falling from his broomstick in a murder attempt. What he needed was a good long sleep. Maybe that would help him figure out how to talk to Draco about his self-punishment-people-have-a-right-to-try-and-kill-me-thing. “Well, I’m off to bed, then. G’night.”
They talked about everything. Trivial things, even the war. Childhoods. Favorite things. Sometimes they didn’t talk at all. But every time they stood a little closer together. Every time it was harder for Harry to drag his eyes away from Draco.
“To try to win me back, I suppose.” Draco said patiently yet unenthusiastically, resisting the urge to snap at Harry and just tell him he was being an overprotective prat. But he knew that wouldn't help. Harry clenched his jaw as Draco went on. “Look, will you calm down and listen? I have not been writing to him, that letter just came.”
“Will he be alright?” asked Daphne anxiously.
Draco’s lying awake, captivated by the bright moonlight streaming in from the window. He does this more than he should, even though he isn’t tired. Draco liked listening to Harry’s soft breathing, watching the moon and the trees make shadow patterns on the wall. It calmed him.
“Yes, but we don’t have our-”
Days were irrelevant now, and everything he remembered that was washed in sunlight melded together into a blur. It was the nights that he held close, the nights spent with Draco- for he
“I don’t care about that,” replied Harry. He stood up slowly, tugging Draco up with him. Draco felt kind of bad, now, for crying like a child all over Harry, and Harry could see this in his eyes because he wrapped a comforting arm around Draco’s waist, a steady presence that helped to center Draco as they walked. “And it’s alright to cry, Draco. That’s part of being human. It doesn’t mean you’re weak.”
“I hate them too,” he said quietly, and Daphne nodded agreement, looking as though she did not trust her voice as she glanced back over her shoulder. She took a shaky breath and Harry felt another wave of sympathy for her. Apparently Draco felt the same because he gave her a quick, one armed hug.
“Correct, Ms. Granger. You will get more information in a week, but it would be a three month exchange only for the eighth years of Hogwarts.”
Harry smiled. “‘Yeah, I do. It’s still almost not real, this trip. But I’m looking forward to it.” Hermione nodded wisely.
“Maybe,” Harry replied, drawing out the syllables. He was sitting cross-legged on his bed, wrapped boxes and packages scattered haphazardly around him. Draco sighed. Might as well get up all the way, now that he was fully awake. And he was curious to see what he’d gotten.
“Alright, fine,” Draco relented, peering over the end of his bed to see his own pile of presents and grabbing the top few.
“Hi, Mother,” Draco said. “You know Harry.”
The next morning Harry arrived at Charms class with Ron and Hermione. Professor Flitwick’s standing on a tall stack of books.
“Since when are you a therapist, Hermione?”
No one in Slytherin had cared, and no one outside of Slytherin had known. And Theo had understood him like no one else had. He hadn’t judged him for any of it, which was something Draco had needed and had clung to.
“...Fine. In our dorm, tomorrow during dinner.” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes.
Draco stirred a little against his chest, and turned around so he was facing Harry.
“Alright, Malfoy.” Harry flicked up his eyebrows. “If you want a chance, you have one. But remember that Gryffindors always beat Slytherins.” Draco scoffed, and everyone else laughed.
“Fine,” Draco agreed, and Hermione tutted at the both of them. Draco snickered.
“Alright. Thanks, Harry.” he replied.
“Hello,” he replied. “You’re… Professor Athme, right?” The lady gave him a smile.
“But it doesn’t really matter, anyway.” continued Draco absentmindedly. “It’s not like Harry’s gay, or likes me as anything more than a friend. Not even a friend, after I snapped at him. Merlin, why am I such a dickhead?” Draco groaned and let his head drop back down onto the table. Daphne rubbed his back.
“You absolute
“You did miss me, I knew it.” Harry joked.
As they passed through the halls, they went by two Gryffindors, who stared at their clasped hands with shock. Then disgust.
He wilted down into his seat. It wasn’t Bellatrix. Couldn't possibly be Bellatrix, as this lady was with a baby. If Bellatrix had a baby, she’d probably cast some horrid spell on it.
“And carries around blond Slytherins that complain a lot?” Harry grinned and Draco rolled his eyes.
“I will pass the dormitory list around once we arrive at your common room. Now, there will be no Quidditch for the eighth years-” several people made shocked noises, including Ron, and she spoke over them “-as you are technically no longer in your houses. You may continue to wear your house colors but otherwise consider yourselves simply eighth years.”
And then an arm was wrapped tightly around his middle, halting his drop barely twenty feet above the grassy ground of the pitch. Harry.
Mint. Mint had been what he smelled in the Amortentia all those weeks ago. Mint like Draco’s shampoo.
“Are you sure?” asked a Healer, her face etched with concern. “This is permanent, and the spell may have effects that we don’t know of, it’s such an unknown spell.” Draco exhaled, catching Hermione’s eye, then Ron’s. They both looked worried, apprehensive.
They had plans to go into one of the nearby villages to buy Christmas presents for all of their friends and family since it was mid-December. Though Draco still hadn’t a clue what to get Harry, or Daphne. Or anyone, really. Except Hermione, she was similar enough to himself that he knew he could just get her something academic-related and she’d be delighted.
She said this with a smile, though Draco could see the strain on her face, around her eyes. It had been hard on her, on both of them of course, as accustomed as they had been to the reputation of the Malfoy name and money. His father was still in Azkaban, so his absence was another thing out of place. And the trials for all of them had been, to say the least, not enjoyable.
“You’re dating Potter,” said Blaise slowly, but quietly.
He’d paid another carriage to take him back up to the school, and had been lying on his bed, trying to make sense of everything. Why it affected him so much. Why the images kept flashing in his mind. Draco’s skin, glittering and golden. Nott leaning over Draco. Nott’s hands curled around Draco’s shoulders, how he’d pressed up against him. Draco’s blond hair against Nott’s dark curls.
Draco blinked, startled. It hadn’t occurred to him that people would wonder where he was, and the thought was disconcerting. But in a good way.
“So, what about that Beauxbatons trip, eh? Were you guys thinking of trying to get a spot?”
“Yeah, alright.” agreed Draco, reaching for a roll. “Pass the butter?” Harry did, and tuned in to Daphne and Camille’s conversation on the other side of him when Simon started talking in French to Draco and Amelie.
“Don’t walk away from me, Malfoy-”
But they would get through it together. Harry knew they would.
“Owlery,” said Draco. “It was nice to be away from-” he waved his hand vaguely. “All that.”
So now he and Draco were dependent on each other. Harry was doubly glad that the war was over, now, because going into those kinds of situations with someone else’s life depending on his, literally depending on his...it was different.
“Here.” he said briskly, then collected his things and left. Harry glanced at him as he walked away. In Potions he had been so… well, Malfoy-ish. But just now he’d been alright.
“Sod off. How did you find me, anyway?” asked Malfoy as Harry started up the hill. Harry smiled ruefully.
“See for yourself.” he says, and hands Harry the small notebook that he’d been so curious about. Harry glances at him curiously before flipping to a random page. There’s poetry. Another page. A small but detailed sketch of the castle, another of the courtyard. And on the next page, two words written over and over.
Fifty minutes later Draco was leaning on an icy column, resting his feet. He’d been dragged into dancing by Camille and Daphne, who’d been watching him rather inquisitively, her eyes darting between him and Harry. He’d questioned her about it, but of course she had revealed nothing. And she was a better liar than Harry, too. Draco was starting to think, with some flutters of trepidation, that something was being kept from him.
“Er. Malfoy?” said Harry tentatively. There’s a flash of grey eyes as Malfoy looked at Harry, then back down. Malfoy dropped the Shrivelfig in the cauldron and reached for the next thing. “I didn’t make you mad, did I?” prodded Harry carefully.
“I was doing that.” Malfoy pointed out, and there’s a faint shadow of indignation in his voice. Harry smiled and raised an eyebrow.
He still wished they could’ve figured out who cursed Draco’s broomstick, but Daphne had been right in the sense that it was virtually impossible to discover who it was. All they had to go on was perhaps that the person had cursed the broom before they’d gone flying, which meant anyone with access to the broomshed was a possible suspect. Which meant the Quidditch house teams. But it would be relatively easy for someone to enter it, even if they weren’t technically allowed in there. So that was about as useful as trying to narrow it down by who disliked Draco, because aside from some of the eighth years, about everyone disliked Draco. To put it mildly. So Harry had conceded, grudgingly, and just resolved to stay as close to his boyfriend as he could.
“Bloody wonderful,” muttered Draco. “A room with Potter and Longbottom. I could just go jump off the Astronomy Tower. At least then I would die faster.”
“I told you it was a bad idea.” Harry answered wryly, getting up and fetching a wet towel. He handed it to Draco.
That night, Harry dreamed again.
Something in his past thoughts kept circling back to Harry, and suddenly he realized- he could check the Marauder’s Map. He couldn’t have left the school, so Harry could easily find him on there. Part of him was reluctant to invade Malfoy’s privacy, for Harry knew he probably had a good reason for leaving to go to places unknown. But Daphne’s worried face came back into his mind, and with a muffled curse Harry put his school things away and went to go check the Map.
The class went by fairly quickly, and as Amelie had described they each took turns instructing the class on a random subject, and at the end they took a pop quiz to determine how much they’d comprehended from each mini-lesson. Harry found it vastly different from his normal classes, but interesting and engaging. When it came to his five minutes, he set up something similar to the DA, demonstrating the Shielding Charm and then having the class practice, walking around and offering pointers and tips. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.
Harry blinked at this idea. “I didn’t think about going into teaching. But.. yeah, I could. Good idea, Hermione.”
Draco cleared these thoughts from his head impatiently. His left forearm suddenly tingled a little, and he raised his sleeve to see the vibrant phoenix tattoo that he’d become quite fond of. He smiled, a little calmer now. In the past, a tingle or ache had meant something horrible, but this time it felt like a comforting word spoken, or a much-needed hug. Something welcomed, not hated.
“Like you then?”
“Well of course we won, we always win.” said Harry smugly. Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes, grabbing the bag of sweets.
“Something like that,” he agreed.
“Did you get one of these?” asked Draco, holding up the slim envelope as he sat down next to Daphne. She tapped his hand, tilting her head and glancing at Harry as if to ask if last night had gone alright. Draco gave her a slight nod, and she smiled.
“We do, I have a lot. But I usually just use my Invisibility Cloak.”
“So,” he said, trying to change the subject. “Do you want to go have an early breakfast, or do you want to head up to the Headmistress’s office and snag two spots to France?”
“Andromeda and Teddy?” asked Harry interestedly.
“Yeah. At first I felt like I shouldn’t be ok with it, but we’re past each other. Just friends now. And Dean’s a great guy.” replied Harry honestly. Then, grinning, he gestured at their clasped hands. “Is it official now?”
“Thanks.” Harry said softly. “I think I needed to hear that.” Draco nodded. They stayed like that for a little while, each supporting the other. Physically and mentally.
“So?” Pansy prodded, albeit quieter than before. “Who is it? Please tell me I know them.”
He looked at Potter out of the corner of his eye. He didn’t look any different. Draco didn’t know why he’d expected him too after last night. Same messy black hair, ugly glasses, green eyes.
“So they’re alright with it?” said Hermione, looking a bit skeptical.
Honestly Harry welcomed the change- he had enough on his mind already without dealing with Malfoy’s snide remarks. All the same, it was still odd.
“Go away, Daphne.” he said flatly. She gave him a sad look, a pitying look, and Draco resisted the urge to scream at her. Why was she feeling bad for him? It was Harry who was lying in the hospital bed, Harry who was suffering beyond imagination. Because of Draco.
“Well, in first year Hagrid had this dragon egg he won in a pub, it hatched and me, Ron, and Hermione were with him, and we look over and Draco’s just peering in the window, then he runs away, right. Well long story short, we tried to help Hagrid get rid of the dragon by sending it to Ron’s brother who works with dragons in Romania, but we got caught coming down from the Astronomy Tower because Draco’d tattled on us. Then we lost about a hundred and fifty points and all of us got handed detention in the Forbidden Forest, where I had to pair up with Draco after he scared Neville and then we saw Voldemort hunched over a dead unicorn.”
“That’s my point.” he declared, closing his eyes again. “And no, I don’t want to open presents yet. Christmas will still be here when I wake up later.” he added. “I’m not some five year old jumping around at the crack of dawn, screaming about presents. Unlike some people.”
“Hello, Harry.” replied Luna. “How are you?” The three of them entered the Great Hall and strolled down the aisle between two of the House tables.
“I’m in the Alchemy program, it’s my second year.” replied Camille. “Draco, are you drinking your coffee black?” Draco nodded as he sipped it. “Why? It’s gross like that.”
“I forgot my inkpot, dammit.”
“Thanks, Harry.” Amelie said gratefully, snuggling into the jacket. Harry looped his arm through hers and pulled her along.
“Finnegan accuses us of being Death Eaters and killers, but he’s the one who fucking attacked someone when their back was turned.” she hissed, turning her head and glaring at Seamus.
“Well you better start talking, because I want to know everything,” she ordered. “Potter, you’re dismissed.”
But after examining him, and bringing in professionals from St. Mungo’s, they’d determined that the Johnson boy hadn’t had enough power to cast the curse in full, so it wasn’t and hadn’t been burning Harry up from the inside out. It was just crippling, burning pain, almost enough to shut down Harry’s heart. Thankfully, it hadn’t, thanks to Draco’s stasis charm and sheer luck. And Harry had remained at Hogwarts, since his condition was deemed too risky to move him or Apparate with him.
Something was twisting uncomfortably in his stomach and he exhaled. No use hiding it from her.
“That is a very creative idea, Draco.” replied Professor Suri, his tone thoughtful. “I think- while it may be a complicated and advanced bit of magic- that what you speak of might indeed be possible, and I certainly think you have the skills for it.” Draco preened a little bit at the praise, relieved his idea wasn’t complete rubbish. “However I must ask that you do this under my supervision, as it is experimentation; but also I would like to monitor your progress.” added the professor, and Draco readily agreed. It wouldn’t hurt to have someone with him while he figured this out.
Harry pointed at him. “Late,” he said sternly, but a smile danced on his lips. Draco smiled ruefully.
“This fountain is dedicated to him and his wife. Says they met at Beauxbatons, and this fountain has special properties.” Draco rolled his eyes at that.
Draco now- under the midnight sky.
“You look knackered,” Pansy snickered, and Draco narrowed his tired eyes at her.
Every week they’d taken the carriages down to a nearby primary school for wizarding children who were not yet old enough to enroll in a place like Beauxbatons, or Hogwarts. They’d assist the professors, or act as the professor for the classes as practice. Harry always enjoyed it; it was still amazing to him to see the little kids, some no older than toddlers, using magic like it was a third hand. It did make them quite difficult to control, though.
“You didn’t write about that! Blimey, who?” Ron replied in surprise, and Draco smirked, before sitting down next to Harry and pressing his lips to Harry’s. It was hard to concentrate on anything but the feel of Draco’s lips on his and the smell of mint; but Harry heard, as if from far away, Ron’s shocked sputters, and it took a great deal of willpower
“There you two are,” exclaimed Amelie. “Why weren’t you at breakfast?”
“Well, I remember leaving the Great Hall with Draco,” he said slowly, glancing over at the sleeping blond nearby. “And...and going down to Potions. We were talking about his mother, he’d gotten a letter from her…” Hermione nodded, but her expression told Harry he was still missing something. Harry thought back, and suddenly he knew. “Oh. That Ravenclaw boy who tried to curse Draco, but it hit me instead.” he said finally, and Ron nodded.
Draco blinked open his eyes to see the Great Hall, looking just as it always did. The four (now five) student tables, the stone gargoyles adorning the walls, the enchanted ceiling, currently reflecting a calm blue sky. Draco looked around, aware of Harry next to him, their hands still clasped tightly together. He saw the fireplace, flaring green as a student came through. The Headmistress was standing adjacent to the fireplace, welcoming each student back as they came through the Floo.
