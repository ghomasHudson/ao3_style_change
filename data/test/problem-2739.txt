An exciting date
“It is never a good idea to get between veela mates, they were lucky they were not in the building when he got there.”  She said, as she kissed Draco on the cheek.  “There is nothing more important to a veela than their mate.  I have heard you don’t know much about this, if you have any questions, I will gladly help you.  I would imagine it’s harder to adapt to the changes when you are not aware.”  She walked through the house as if she owned the place.  Casually looking around, giving no hint of her feelings on the state of the house which I knew was nowhere near as immaculate as her manor.
Harry laughed.  “Carefully.  Even my friends had no clue.” He added.
“It does not matter.  I am sure she will love you, but even if she doesn’t, we are in this forever.  Her opinion holds nothing over us.  We can wait if you are not ready.”  I know my mother can be a bit cold to outsiders, but I know she will accept him, even if only for my sake.
Harry and Draco stayed sitting at the table, shoulder to shoulder, their hands entwined.  They were comfortable and just wanted to take in the silence for a little longer before continuing on their shopping day.  They spent a lot of time finding things to fill the room they had set aside for Teddy. After getting home they got the room ready and held each other as they waited for Andromeda’s entrance.
Draco’s P.O.V.
“Why are you adopting your godson now?”
Draco’s P.O.V.
“What will you teach?”  George asked.  “I mean, I would assume Harry is DADA?”
When the train arrived Draco and I apparated in, to start unpacking as the younger kids took the scenic route to the school. I remember how amazing it all was to me my first year. Part of me wishes that Teddy could have that same experience, but he grew up with magic and knows this castle almost as well as I do. ”I’m not ready. He’s growing up too fast. Can’t we make him stay this age?” I asked as Draco kissed the back of my neck.
Harry’s P.O.V.
“No, let’s just forget it all for now.  Just hold me.”  I said, closing my eyes.
Harry’s P.O.V.
Ron’s eyes grew wide as they took in the blond walking up the hallway.  He shot his gaze back on Harry imploringly. “Malfoy? Really?”
The day of the funeral arrived, bringing with it a cold front leaving the air nippy.  It was not the most comfortable day for an outside funeral. Yet it seemed somehow fitting.  Harry was a bundle of nerves when he woke up, balking at the idea of seeing them again.  After showering together and a warming massage his resolve returned.  We both dressed in crisp black suits with charcoal gray shirts and ties. We made quite a stir when we first showed up.  Neither of the remaining Dursley’s noticed us at first.  We stayed around the outside of the group of mourners, not wanting to make a scene.   This was for closure after all.   After a while I noticed Dudley’s eyes went wide.  He looked over at his father who was solemnly looking at the ground then made his way over to Harry’s other side.
Nope, I don't own the characters, shocking I know.
This chapter does use a slur.  I hate using it, but, the character would say it.
Draco and Hermione both took one of his hands.  “You are more than that to us, to your real family.  Just ignore them when they are in your face. “ Hermione said earnestly     “And we all know Draco didn’t give a damn about that even when we were all kids.  He made sure you knew it, too.”  This got a laugh out of them all. “Okay Harry, another serious question.  Are you ready to tell Mrs. Weasley, you are like another son to her, she won’t want to read it tomorrow.”
I wrapped my arms around the blond, holding him tightly.  “I am far too stubborn for that.  I absolutely refuse to let them win. I don’t mind spending time with you and Hermione, but she is my best friend.  She deserves time with just us. Then, I am yours.  I know you have wanted to plan a vacation for a while now. Let’s do it. Call, make plans and you can take me away for as long as you want just you, me, and a beach somewhere. In the meantime, I could use some help in the shower if you are up to it.”
“Happy Birthday Harry, and I am totally staying over tonight.  Let’s stay up late watching horrible horror movies until we can’t stay up any longer. Give Ron time.  I wouldn’t call right away.”   I just gave her a small smile and nodded.
She smiled at me sweetly which I did not expect.  “Nice to meet the person that was able to make my son smile.”   She held out her hand to shake, so of course I did.  “I haven’t heard a whole lot about you, yet, but with so much going on that’s not really a shock now, is it?  How are you doing after your frightful adventure?”
I open my eyes and stretch, feeling the emptiness from the other side of the bed. I cast a tempus to check the time but the sound of yelling comes from down the hall. At this moment I wish I could just go back into the dream. Teddy is now a preteen who is going to Hogwarts. He has lived there with us during school, but now he will be a student, and he has not been happy about having us as teachers.
“That’s a thought, and it will make him realize how nervous this is making me.”  Harry added.  “Can we do it tonight?”
Harry’s P.O.V.
His eyes stayed on me, while mine took in his whole body.  I watched the muscle control in his abs, and the definition in his legs.  I watched as a drop of sweat trailed down his back and another down his arm.  He was controlled, this made the veela part of me purr.  The light glinting off of his wings was ethereal.  I could not look away.  I was lost in his movements and the occasional clash of metal as they deliberately brought them together causing sparks.  I finally joined reality again to the sounds of “Huzzah.” from the audience.  I shook my head to clear it from it’s daze, noticing Draco hugging Pansy and then attempting to come back through the large group of patrons that had somehow doubled.  He was stopped by multiple people asking for pictures which he did gladly.  You could tell that this was normal for him.  The sweat only enhanced his scent, and I was not surprised when after a quick kiss he growled “I know where our tent is, I think it’s time to break it in. Let’s go.”  His voice was deep and his pupils were blown.  He could not keep his hands to himself the entire walk to the tents.
Draco opened the door to the empty room the ministry had made available to them. He saw his husband huddled on the floor breathing heavily. Instantly he dropped his sneer, replacing it with a warm smile as he kneeled down and looked deeply into the green eyes that had captured him when they were kids. “Baby, if it’s too much I can do it.  I stopped caring what the press thought of me years ago.”  He sat down on the floor wrapping an arm around his husband’s shoulder. He wiped gingerly at his trousers as he noticed the spider webs in the room.
Alright, sorry this took so long.  This chapter just did not want to be written.  I've written, and edited, and completely rewritten it like 10 times.. and I'm still not really happy with it..  I finally decided it would have to go up as is.
Three days of waking, bathing, and fucking passed.  I woke up on the fourth day before Draco.  I took a warm shower, got dressed then went to the kitchen to make actual breakfast for us.  The scent of food apparently woke him up, because he was soon sitting on a chair in just his boxers watching me cook.  “I see you are feeling better.  Where are the dads?”
“I think Ron and I should get back home and give you guys some time alone again before you lose all your privacy tomorrow.”  She nudged Ron out of his seat as he looked confused.  “We’ll  see you guys later.  Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”
Draco’s P.O.V.
The evening went by quickly, the conversations varied from their relationship to the chaotic beginning of it.  I noticed Hermione watching Harry curiously.  She seemed like she wanted to say something.  I caught her eye and raised my eyebrow.  She looked guilty for a second then mouthed the word ‘later’.  I let it go for the moment, but couldn’t help but worry about it causing my mate to squeeze my hand and look at me with a question in his eyes.  I just squeezed it back and went back to the conversation around me.
He could do nothing but follow me.  As we walked the feeling remained.  I did not feel scared, or even alarmed really.  I could smell my mate’s worry though.  I just wondered why someone would be so interested in us.  I mean, yeah Draco is a beautiful man, but to watch us walking in the park seems pointless.

Harry's P.O.V.
dealing with the aftermath
“It’s not your fault kid.  We are happy you managed to find him.  Any updates on the culprits yet?”  Remus asked with a kind smile.  He continued with the cooking, somehow paying attention to that and what was going on at the table.
“Good Morning everyone, I am sure you are all curious about why I’ve organized this conference.  I know I rarely do anything like this, but, if I don’t I will have to hide something important to me.  So, we decided…”  At the word ‘we’ the noise increased with the speculative murmurings of the reporters.  Harry cleared his throat, silencing them once again.  “We decided that we were ready to stop hiding.”  The questions started immediately, most presuming that the ‘we’ referred to Ginny.  Harry rolled his eyes and held up his hands.  “No, Ginny is my best friend's sister, that’s it.  I have been in a relationship for five years with a wonderful person.  We got married a month ago.”  He could not keep going as the murmurs started again even louder.  He waived his hand behind his back to signal Draco, who, as planned, stepped forward suddenly out of the shadow and grabbed the offered hand.  The murmurs became yells and for a moment neither man said anything. They just looked into each other’s eyes and zoned out the noise.
I sighed, leaning into my mate.  “I just want to sit here a bit with you.  That was not easy for me.  Part of me wants to hate him.  Another part wants to show up at the funeral and scream at my uncle.  I know it won’t help though.”
Draco’s P.O.V.
“That’s fine, we’ll have you out of the chains in a moment, Sir.” the Officer replied, his face beet red as he tried to keep a straight face.  Harry nodded in response to the man’s words.
“Yes, Siri, I think this one will be perfect to really live in.”  I have to agree, though I stay quiet.  This house had five bedrooms, two baths, a library, and even a hot tub.  The master bedroom was painted in a warm burnt orange color with dark wood trim.  It felt like ‘our’ home, though I don’t want to show my thoughts to the realtor.
“You told me about being gay Harry, but, Malfoy?  This makes no sense.”  Ginny stated in an irritated voice.  She went to stand up, but Ron motioned for her to sit back down.
“They went out on Holiday.  They should be back in a few weeks.”  I manage to stutter out.  “I really don’t want to bother them.  They needed a break. I will be okay.  Thanks for helping me.”
“My head still hurts.”  He winced as I gingerly touched around the area.  “I doubt this phone call is going to help my head.  They are a bit overprotective since they took me in. I’m sure if they had a way to just appear they would.  They will however drop everything and head back home immediately.”
“I’m not sure, I am just glad I didn’t have to have a really awkward conversation with them first thing.  How are you feeling after all that?  I didn’t even really speak to you for three days.” I said, feeling a little bit sad at my memory of the last few days.
It was at this moment that I felt tension in the air.  The dark eyes of Harry’s uncle were turned in our direction.
“Baby, I think I’m clean, and as cool as I am going to get for a while.  Can I get something to eat?”  I let him stand up and wrapped a fluffy green bath sheet around him, handing him the protein bar I had stashed in my pocket.  “There’s probably no purpose to putting on clothes now is there?”  He asked.
Dray and I were a little surprised to hear “Hufflepuff”, but we stood and clapped to show our support. His hair changed back to blue as he walked to his house table. His eyes were bright and his smile could light the room as he looked up at us. He would do well in hufflepuff, and I hope he will feel close to his mother who had been there before.
Draco’s P.O.V.
I woke to find my mate pacing.  We had avoided talking about the fact that Ron had not been seen again. I had my own reason for avoiding the discussion.  Our conversations became forced and rather cold.  I wanted to fix this problem, but could not accept the fact that I had not been able to avenge my mate.  I did not know how to go about talking about it without making the anger rise to the surface.  Even though I know it wasn’t Harry’s fault, it was hard to keep the feeling from my bond.  He knew I was angry, he knew I was tormenting myself, but he wasn’t quite sure what my angst was about.  On the other hand, I knew he felt his own resentment over the fact that he no longer felt safe.  With everything going on I had expected it.  I know Harry is not a person that likes to feel trapped, but knowing that Ron was out there was bringing out more of his omega traits.  He felt the need to be protected, while hating the feeling at the same time.  I spent a lot of time holding him, while running my fingers through his hair.  Neither of us wanting to bring up what we both knew we needed to talk about.  The tension in the air was suffocating.  My desire to see my mate happy and carefree again inspired me to plan a vacation.  If we got out of town, we could leave thoughts of Ron behind for awhile and just focus on us.  With his heat coming soon, I decided to wait and make it a surprise.
My blush faded quickly, and while Harry’s head hit my lap and he looked at me, I smiled before answering.  “Well, we wanted to start looking for a place.  Neither of us really need jobs, but we want to start something together.”  I caught a side-eyed look between the men, and then Remus coughed.  His own blush forming.
Teddy
*****Harry’s p.o.v.*****
I was at war with my instincts while he was out.  I found myself pacing through our home like a tiger in a cage.  Even with the bond I could not convince my instincts to back off.  I could feel as he tried to send comforting waves through it in response to my stress.  I did not know what was causing my unease.  He had been out on his own before with no problem.  What was causing my veela to act up now?  I tried going out for a walk, only to realize that my normal mask was not working.  Even though I had dressed as sharply as ever, people were staying as far away as possible, even crossing the street due to my expression.  After scaring enough complete strangers I had a slight pang of guilt.  I made the decision to go back home and start researching on my own.  I needed to feel like I had done something to protect my mate.  I hoped it would also help burn up some of this anxiety driven energy I’d been building up.  I grabbed my computer and a notebook and started digging.
“We spent a lot of time in the muggle world or traveling.  I’m still surprised no one ever caught us while we were out.”  Draco answered.  “One more question!”
She took away the towel which was warm now anyway and brushed the strands of my hair from my face.  “I know it’s hard.  Some people still hold grudges against those with creature blood.  Anything different scares them.  You are an omega male veela Harry, even among full human lines male omegas are rare, in veela lines it’s almost unheard of.  They are afraid of you Harry, hopefully as life goes on they’ll get over it.  I am still here.  It’s a good thing too, did you ever actually pay attention in school?  I know your aunt and uncle sucked, but you should have learned all this, veela history and second gender are required for exactly this reason.”  From anyone else I’d probably be annoyed, but, I know she doesn’t mean anything by it.
“Are you planning to have another ceremony for your friends and family to attend?”
Harry gives me a quick wink as he gives me a once over. “I know George gave you things you are not allowed to bring. Hand them over.” Harry says calmly with his arms crossed in front of his chest. He was dressed in nice trousers and a crisp white shirt. I could not help but grin at him. “Not going to help me with this?” He asks me loudly, by the look on his face his volume is more for Teddy.
He slowly pushed himself back into a sitting position then sighed.  Honestly, I have tried to avoid thinking about it.  Someday I want a family, right now I just want to focus on this.”  He said as he gestured to all of us.  His face turned red as he continued.  “And, yes, my heat is starting.  I was planning on us laying low for the duration.”  He looked shyly up at me so I gave him my best smirk and kissed his forehead.
“Is that all?  He is like my brother. I wouldn’t care one bit about that.”  He complained.  “Where is he ‘Mione?”
I laughed, then smirked at him.  “Probably not. Once it starts it generally progresses quickly.  Do you want me to take mine off?  Will it help you feel less vulnerable?”  He just nodded, blushing.  He moved the scented blankets and some of my clothes around the bed and curled himself around a pillow in the center.  I placed extra water bottles on the side table after taking off my own clothes.  Crawling onto the bed, I wrapped myself around my mate, kissing the back of his neck.  I noticed his scent getting stronger, as my breathing grew quicker.
“You are finally happy, Har.  You look so,”  she hesitated, “ content.  No longer waiting for the other shoe to drop.”
After that act we headed towards Pansy's act.  We arrived just as the show started.  Pansy introduced herself to the crowd as Penelope, a stage name she had chosen years ago.  She was in pretty normal belly dancing gear.  Bells were attached to her wrists and ankles, long flowy fabrics in a variety of shades of orange and red.  The layers keeping the sheer fabrics from being seen through.  Harry’s jaw dropped as he watched the slow deliberate muscle movements as she started dancing.
When I woke again, it was to find gray eyes staring into mine.  “Good morning my love.  Any plans for the day?”  I closed my eyes, giving myself a moment to think.  “Um, yeah, ‘Mione and I were going to go out for a bit of best friend time.”
"I make you come," he says. "That's what I do."
Harry's smile widens. He lifts his glass of beer, and taps it against Draco's. "Here's to a hundred more weekends away."
"Pop over every morning and make the bed for me? Hardly fair, is it?"
Harry doesn’t meet his eyes. “Spoil me how?”
Draco closes his eyes and hides his face in Harry's leg.
"A thing," Harry says. He squeezes Draco's balls a little. "I could put you in any position I wanted."
"Let's go," Harry says. "We'll go downstairs, we'll get you pyjamas, and then we'll go somewhere I can kiss you, all right?"
Except Harry's standing up and stepping away from him, and he's pulling off his trousers and his shirt, like he's going to get into bed too.
"What?"
"I don't even know which bits it's supposed to cover."
Harry makes a sharp, desperate noise in the back of his throat, almost like a sob, and Draco reaches for him then, pulling him into a hug.
"We don't need to decide now," Harry says. "Just know that I… I know what you're saying, all right? I don't undertake anything to do with you and I lightly. I think we're more careful with each other than anyone else ever has been, and I'm not about to throw that up in the air. We deserve what we give each other. We can change the subject but just know that I'm not taking any of this lightly."
Harry's still masturbating. Draco can hear him. He doesn't look up.
He slides his hand down into the small of Harry's back. His skin so soft. He's so warm. He'd never really-- well. The reality of being with someone is different from how it had been in his head.
"Because he's my best friend," Harry says, nudging Draco back towards the wall, "and one of these days you and him might stop sniping at each other long enough to realise you actually have things in common."
Then he prints the apparition co-ordinates underneath and sends the note off with a waiting Estelle, and hopes he's timed it well enough that it catches Harry at home instead of with Ron Weasley.
Draco doesn’t react to the change in topic. “It is,” he says. “So heavily warded that no one will find it.”
"Going to come all over you," Harry says, "and I know you can't help but be noisy, so let's hear it. Let's hear it, Malfoy."
Draco makes a soft sound somewhere deep in his chest. He trembles with it.
“All of it, probably,” Draco says. “But particularly the bits that are stopping you from allowing you to have what you need when I’m offering it.”
. It's the biggest thing anyone's ever given him. There's a queer sort of a sob caught at the back of his throat and he can't swallow it and he can't let it out, so it just has to stay where it is, stuck.
Draco doesn’t say anything to that. The wood’s thinning out now anyway as they get closer to the sea. The air smells saltier. The wood has lost itself to a see of pine trees. When the pines come to an end, they’re in the dunes, miles of wilderness and windswept beaches and driftwood and nothing but them and the sound of the sea.
He apparates them both back to his house with a
Harry holds out the forkful of cake, and Draco obediently opens his mouth. "Fuck knows," Harry says, "but I don't want it to stop."
Draco’s pulse thrums. “No, sir,” he says.
"Don’t you?" Harry says, already undoing his flies and pushing his trousers down so that his cock springs free. "Come on, Draco, don’t pretend to be shy now. Show me how tiny that cock is."
"He's been through such a lot."
"You've had a bad day and you're focusing on buying me cake."
In the bedroom, wrapped in a towel - a nice towel, despite it not being neatly folded and not matching any of the other towels in the airing cupboard - the clothes that he came in are gone.
"We have nothing in common," Draco says. "Don't say such terrible things."
Draco nods. “They’re in a basket in the nursery. I want you to be happy,” he says. “I want you to have what you want and I don’t know to give it to you so that you’ll take it.”
"I know. I'm sorry. I'm just a hole."
thank you for waiting, and for the nice comments. <3
Draco can feel himself going pink. "All right," he says. "I just thought you might prefer it."
"Yes," Harry says. "But not for your first time."
Harry smiles, even as he's rolling his eyes. "We're wizards, Draco," he says, holding out his hand towards the tray on the table and casting a warming spell. "One of the things we're quite good at is making sure our food stays warm."
, and you’ll walk away, and I don’t— I don’t know what to do if that happens."
"Course I want to, you idiot. I spend half my wanking time imagining fucking you in front of the mirror so you can see."
"Oh, there you go," Harry says. "A cocklet. Not even good enough to have a proper cock, are you?"
"Oi, Potter," he yells. "Get your arse over here and catch me."
“Nothing in your life but eating and coming, is there, my piggy?” He presses his hand closer, until he’s smearing cake over Draco’s nose and chin and cheeks. “My lovely, stupid, soft piggy.”
"If you like," Harry says, his thumb pressed to Draco's lip so that the sugar catches his chin.
"You got somewhere comfortable to sit around here, or what?" He pushes open a nearby door. "What's through here?"
Harry doesn't look away. "Oh, Draco," he says, after a moment. He covers Draco's hand with his own, and for a moment, Draco stills. "I hope you're going to charge the owner the earth."
“Should we?” Harry asks. He draws his knees up, wrapping his hands around them. “Which part?”
"Tell me what you do when you get home by yourself."
"Because I'm a dirty little animal," Draco says, and his face feels like it's on fire. He's never done this in his work clothes. What he's wanted and what he's got has always been so divorced from his precise real life. Now Harry's come on his coat.
Draco still spends a good majority of his time unable to believe that he is somebody's boyfriend, and that that somebody is the saviour of the wizarding world.
“There were a lot of very clever wizards who tried to protect that stone, is what I’m saying,” Harry says, “and it still got stolen.”
"I know," Draco says. He's very good at it.
"Nothing."
Draco rocks his hips down against the cake. He's got cake and cream everywhere, and he's sticky and dirty and it's not enough. He's not ashamed enough. He wants more.
Harry fists his cock, standing over Draco with his trousers undone. Draco, naked and hard and desperate, wants to beg for more, to be able to touch himself, to be able to come on the floor like he deserves.
"You know the rules," Harry says. "Blink three times and you'll break the spell."
"We'll never know," Harry says happily. He tucks his feet around Draco's under the table, and picks up his knife and fork. "Eat, before it gets cold."
Draco shakes his head. "Not
Draco keens. He presses back as Harry pushes forward, and it aches, and it's the kind of ache that he can feel right down to his toes, and up through his fingertips, the knowledge that Harry is there, he's
"That sounds… not ideal."
He laughs at that. "Course you will. You're desperate, aren't you? Bet you're so desperate you'd turn around and spread your legs and show me your hole, wouldn't you?"
"I don't want to talk about this," Harry says. "I don't want to talk about how weird I am for wanting this stupid thing."
"Like a piglet at a trough," Harry says, and is that… is that disgust? Draco's cock leaks, his embarrassment and his shame showing itself across his red, flushed skin. "Come on, eat it all up. Greedy fucking piglet."
“It’s all right,” Draco says. “To want that.”
The noise Draco makes is unexpectedly loud.
Draco just nods, and he stays quiet even as they're heading for the apparition point at the corner of the road, and all of their purchases are shrunk down small enough that Harry's got them all in a single parcel.
"Who is this, anyway?" he asks, a couple of songs later.
"It's all right," Harry says. "No one's going to punish you for trailing mud in. You've done exactly what you're supposed to do. You've gone in the garden like a real animal. And now it's time for me to clean you up. Look after you. It's all right. Animals don't worry about dirt."
"A stupid piglet," Draco says.
Draco quivers. He tries not to let it tell, but Harry's eyebrow quirk gives him away.
It's Harry's turn to flush this time. "You don't have to," he says. "I might not even want it."
"Don't get upset, darling," Draco says. "Please don't get upset."
"Sometimes," Harry says, stroking Draco's hair behind his ear. "Sometimes they fuck me."
"You can't fuck anyone," Harry says. "Pointless little cock, hey?"
The man's mouth curves up at the edges. "Don't know whether I can be bothered. Don't know if you're worth it."
Draco swallows. "If I’m supposed to laugh at any of this, will you just tell me?"
And then, and
Draco’s heart speeds up. “To?”
"Even come rags you have to pick up afterwards," Harry says. "You're lower than a come rag."
Draco's dick throbs. For a second he meets Harry's gaze, then he reaches behind him to put his hole on proper display, and sticks out his tongue to lick the cream from Harry's hand.
Harry leans in. He whispers this time. "Maybe I'll only let you wank if you're on your pet bed. What do you think of that? Might not even let you use your hands."
"Draco," Harry says, hands in Draco's hair. "Fuck."
"Oh no," Draco says, unable to help himself. "You didn't."
"Just goes to show," Harry says sagely. He doesn't explain what.
"Scotland?"
"Filthy piglet," Draco says. He barely knows what he's saying. "Your dirty piglet, Sir."
“Well,” Draco says, trying to ignore the little jump his cock makes at the thought. “I’m sure that can be arranged.”
"Only you could like something so humiliating, Piglet," Harry tells him, but now he's rolling the tip of Draco's little cock between his thumb and finger and Draco pants his desperation into the chilled sea air. "Only you could want something so dirty. Could want to come like this, being masturbated whilst harnessed up like an animal. Because that's what you are, isn't it? Just my animal. My dirty, horny little piglet. Going to come on the grass, are you? My pet Piglet. Property of Harry Potter. All mine, Piglet. Every last bit of you. Every humiliated, desperate last bit of you."
He lets go of Draco's dick then, and Draco whines at the lack of contact, but he licks his fingers clean of chocolate and watches as Harry gets a carrier bag out of a drawer.
"A dirty piglet with its holes out."
Harry stays that night, curling up in Draco's bed with his hand thrown over Draco's chest, anchoring him close. They'd talked about something and nothing for a while after they'd come up from air after Harry's crying jag, washing up the wine glasses and clearing up after themselves. Draco had put his box of chocolates into the cupboard for another day, and Harry had busied himself thumbing through one of the bookshelves in the sitting room to give them both a little space. Draco had dreaded Harry leaving, convinced that if he went, it would feel like the evening had never happened, but Harry doesn't make a move to leave, and in the end, Draco had asked him to stay and loaned him a pair of pyjamas.
"Fly more."
Draco smiles, and leans in to eat it from his fingers.
Draco nods. This hadn't ever been on his to-do list but it doesn't matter. He wants it. The shame burns through him. He's not even hard and he wants to rut his cock down into the cake, make a mess, get it everywhere.
“I don’t know,” Draco says. “Do you think me wanting what I want, getting hard for the things I get hard for, do you think that’s a result of what happened to me? Because I don’t think it is. I think Voldemort could have stayed gone for good and I’d have grown up and got married and become Minister, or whatever it was that my father always thought would happen to me when I grew up, and I’d still secretly be getting hard for having someone humiliate me. It’s not some kind of retribution for being wrong-headed and a fucking disgrace. It’s just who I am. It’s just what I want. It doesn’t hurt anyone, me wanting it.”
"I know," Draco says. He strokes Harry's hair. "I know that now. I know that now. My brave boy."
Harry slides a hand into Draco's hair and pulls him closer. "Good," he says, "me too," and kisses him again.
Draco whines. He can't help himself.
"Makes me nothing," Draco says.
There's a pause. "I remember."
"We weren't right together and it's not like I wish we were, you know? We made a mess of things and managed - by great persistence - to come out the other side as friends. But I wish I hadn't made her feel like she was stifled. I don't ever want you to feel like that. You'd tell me, wouldn't you? If I was doing something wrong? If I made you feel… I don't know. Something you didn't want to feel."
Draco whines again. His cock's pulsing. A food bowl. Like an animal. He's never-- fuck, he wants one. He wants one. If Harry doesn't get him one, he could get one of his own, use it at home sometimes. It wouldn't be the same as Harry telling him to use it, but he could pretend. Could eat from it before going out to find his own back room. When this thing with Harry's done, he could do that, maybe.
Draco whines, unable to help himself. He sticks his tongue out more, letting it hang out of his mouth like an animal.
"I was a revolting little snot-brain," Draco says, without rancour. "You don't."
"Not in here," Draco says sharply.
Draco knows he's gone a little pink around the edges. He's been alone for so long that these last few weeks with Harry feel like an island of imagined bliss; surely at some point reality will crash firmly back to earth and Draco will be left, once again, with the same silent, neat, desperately lonely existence he'd had before he'd Harry had come back into his life. "Are you?"
Draco, who's reduced to being part of the furniture.
"What do you see?"
Draco, for want of a degree of self preservation, went into the patisserie and bought the cake. Then, with even less self preservation and a strange sense of
Draco swallows down a breath. "That's right, sir," he says, and Harry's hips buck forward. "That's all I am, something for you to come on."
Draco shivers, and it's not from the cold. He's warm all over. He's just too hard to let go.
"Draco," Harry says. "Come in." He flicks the magazine shut. "Is the kitchen cleaned?"
"What happens if we're not on the same page?"
Draco drops to his knees. His hands go straight to Harry’s hips and he opens his mouth to suck on the head of Harry’s cock. His skin’s warm, probably from the exercise because there’s nothing particularly warm about the weather.
"Yes," Draco says, even though Harry had asked for it, and all Draco has done is obey. He tries to turn his head a little, get a better view, but the angle's wrong and Harry's not moving from the doorway.
Draco's so close to coming he doesn't know what to do with himself. He watches, breathless, as the man tucks his dick back into his trousers, and reaches into his pocked, coming out with a card. He whispers something and words embed themselves across the cardstock. He holds it out for Draco to take.
without saying yes out loud. Harry is back to touching his lip with his fingertip, and Draco licks at him, a hesitant
Draco stares in some horror at Harry's mixed clothing discards.
"Yes," Draco says. It's oddly awkward between them, and it's probably because they started their relationship upside down and back to front, and never did this at the point Draco suspects people in relationships are supposed to get to know each other.
"I grew up thinking I was better than everyone," Draco says. "Is there a way that I can say that that makes it funny?"
"Something sweet, Piglet. Would you like that?" Maybe Harry understands that he's not quite ready to talk yet, because he just strokes his hand through Draco's hair. "Some chocolates, Draco. A whole box, just for you."
Harry swallows. "Yes," he says finally. "You are."
It's the first box of chocolates he's ever bought for himself. The idea of Harry discovering them - of Harry discovering him
"Have another chocolate," Harry says. "Then we'll get you dressed."
, Draco notes, with ill disguised heat. Not someone. He starts to undo his coat.
"It's so little," Draco says. "And I'm so ashamed."
"Potter," Harry says, a little lazily. "That's what you used to call me at school."
Draco's careful with Harry, and not just because he can tell from the way Harry's trembling that he's about two seconds from pretending he doesn't want to see the nursery Draco's prepared for him and bolting instead. Draco's ready; he's planned it all out. There are socks and slippers and a jumper for both of them, easily accessible in the basket by Draco's side of the bed. He's already put his own socks on, even though he does not believe that beds are ever a place to wear socks. And then he goes around the other side of the bed and turns back the covers and kneels by the side of the bed to put Harry's socks on, and then his slippers, and then help him on with his dark red jumper.
"I don't look like that."
"It's just a nappy," Draco says. "It's just something nice for you to wear. You want it, and it's here."
"It's just comfort," Draco says. His voice cracks a little. "You shouldn't hate yourself for wanting to be loved. It's just a nappy."
“I think we’ve established that the people you grew up with were not good people.” Draco chews his lip. “And I bought you one. Well, two, really.”
"Do I tuck it in?"
"Just a useless little fucktoy," Harry says, after a second. "Don't know why I didn't think of this before." He doesn't meet Draco's eyes. Instead, he goes back to sit on the sofa. He
Harry drops a kiss to Draco's arm. He rolls away then, settling himself down on the right side of the bed, leaving Draco to his own side, like always. He rests his cheek on his hand. "I bloody love you," he says finally. "I really, really bloody love you."
Draco nuzzles at Harry's trousers.
"I know," Draco says. His hand's still stroking through Harry's hair. "But maybe you'll finally get what you've wanted all this time. And we can stop at any time. Any time. You just have to say."
There wasn't any time for Draco to change, so he settled for taking off his coat and ensuring he could press out the worst of the creases caused by being out and about in his shirt and waistcoat and tie. Then he set the water to boil for tea, and decanted the cake from its patisserie box and onto a cake stand. His mother had taken at least two tea sets with her when she'd departed for the continent, but the china cupboards still housed another three.
One glance at Harry's face removed any doubt that Harry may have done it by accident.
It might be Draco's imagination, but it's entirely possible Harry flushes. "I'm observant."
“Draco.”
"No," Harry says. "It's too small. I told Ron and Hermione about it, but they've got the children now. Maybe if I put another bedroom on the back, but I'm not sure I want to. When they're older perhaps we can pitch a tent in the garden in the summer. I think children would like that, don't you?"
. "I want to be nothing," he says. "Please."
Harry nudges his nose against Draco's cheek. "Do you think I should let you come tonight?"
"Shall I wash those?" Draco asks, choosing to ignore Harry's hand on his dick in favour of picking up his discarded jeans.
"I do," Harry says. The radio keeps on playing. They're not talking about basket weaving any more, they've moved on to the prevalence of witch authors in the wizarding crime genre. Draco isn't really listening. "I did buy you a cock cage, you know."
"If it actually is a terrible idea, we can leave," Harry tells him, stepping out of Draco's arms and looking at him consideringly. He brushes something off of Draco's shoulder.
He finds his Quidditch kit in the wardrobe and changes into it quickly, and with slightly less precision than normal. His heart’s pounding as he grabs his broom, neatly polished in preparation, and the little case of practice snitches.
And Harry, lost for a minute in himself, cries into Draco's shoulder.
Harry sticks his tongue out at him.
Draco's heart pounds. "It hasn't been very long."
“Fuck that shit, huh?” Harry asks.
"I love cock."
, and Draco finishes him off. Harry's talking over his head, something about his pointless cock.
and underneath, well, it's not like he's not fine, but he's always as fine as he pretends--"
That seemed to do it. Potter sighed, looking immensely contented, and then proceeded to impale Draco with his cock.
“I took a potion?” Malfoy asked, blinking in surprise. “What was in it? Not hellebore, I hope.”
“I’m your person,” Harry echoed lamely. He was fairly certain his brain was broken.
for anything.
Winter thawed into spring. One afternoon, Potter decided he’d like to eat picnic-style on a patch of grass in a place that happened to be Draco’s favourite park. Draco casually mentioned this, and Potter laughed and said
“I told you, we really don’t have time for this,” Potter said, pulling him farther into the room and closing the door behind them. “I appreciate what you’re doing, but I’d rather we just get started.”
old-fashioned, despite what you and your friends might think of me.”
“Do you plan to just sit there and admire me?” Draco asked breathily. His hair was already stuck to his forehead—rather ungracefully, he ventured to guess. “Or, are you going to—”
?” he asked.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat. Merlin,
Bloody hell. “Harry Potter.”
The next moment, he was jumping out of Harry’s lap and stumbling away from him, only stopping when his back pressed against the wall and he physically could not get any farther away. “What the ever-loving
His face was definitely bright red now. But, he didn’t say anything else.
“Fuck, you’re so beautiful,” Potter whispered. He let go of Draco’s nipple and Draco could finally breathe again. He simultaneously realised that he hadn't been breathing before.
“All right.” Potter’s eyes were so narrowed they were almost closed. “If you’re Draco Malfoy, what were you doing when I walked in on you in the bathroom sixth year?”
“I can’t believe it,” Potter said. To Draco’s mortification, Potter leaned closer and examined the Mark, tracing his fingers over it slowly. Draco shivered again, hard.
“Yeah, come on,” Potter said, grabbing Draco’s hand—fuck, Potter had
He agreed to let Potter have him, hating himself for how good it felt, and for how much he, too, had been desperate for Potter’s touch for so long.
“I was crying, and I’ll have you know I very much wish I’d managed to finish that Cruciatus Curse before you sliced me open.”
Most days they were alone, though. It was a shame Granger and Weasley had lives of their own, as Potter was so often stuck with only Draco as company.
But… well, maybe if Potter had to come into the office any earlier in the morning his hair would be even more of an atrocity than it usually was, and Draco simply would not be able to focus if that were the case. And, besides. Draco did have the time right now.
“What the fuck?” he rasped, eyes going wide.
, though don’t tell anyone I said that, because I will vehemently deny it. And you’re gorgeous, and spectacular in every way, and the idea that I could have spent years getting to know you and
And yes, perhaps it was maybe slightly a little bit true that Draco didn’t
This Potions class never failed to put Harry on edge.
“Excuse you is right, you bespectacled git! I’ll see you in Hell and not a moment sooner. If we’re ever asked to work together again, I will burn the Ministry down myself!”
you. I’ve wanted you my whole life! But I knew you’d never want me back, so I had to settle for pushing your buttons during work and devising as many reasons as I could think of to spend time with you. I even planned tonight, Potter. You don’t think I could’ve rewritten those files on my own? Why would I come over here if I didn’t prefer your company over sitting in my house alone?”
“That’s right,” Potter said, panting. “Love to hear that voice whine for me.”
Potter stared at him. “I don’t know.”
That made Draco pause. “Come again?”
, even just to grab and snog up against a wall in the middle of the afternoon. And don’t think I’m
“Sure thing,” Draco said, turning away and already forgetting about the encounter. He had done whatever it took to end the conversation with the man, and now he could proceed with his night. Or, more precisely, with brutally murdering his night by forced proximity to—
He’d never let himself imagine it as an option, never let himself think past the moment he’d been in with Harry, too scared that he’d never deserve anything more than that. But the lies he’d made himself believe to protect himself were falling away to reveal the most beautiful truths he had ever encountered. “Yes,” he repeated. “Yes.”
Alone and unsupervised, Draco resumed his struggle against the chains holding him down. They remained, steadfast and impossible to budge.
“Sure, Professor. Okay… yes, that feels like the ointment my gran would use if I ever got a rash.”
! Ask literally anyone! And… and if you feel like I’m important to you at all, then it’s because you hate me that much.”
The time for Harry to drop dead of heart failure was imminent.
Draco didn’t speak. He didn’t say
Harry’s glasses were forgotten. “You belong to me?” he repeated, voice about an octave too high.
“All right, now! Everyone, out. I have to run tests on Mr. Malfoy to make sure he’s recovered his full memory.”
“No, I’ve wanted you for years, but having sex with a stranger who Charmed himself to look like you is about the most perverted thing a person can do!”
Somehow, those were the words that managed to squeak past his brain and into his mouth. “This whole time.”
. Draco couldn’t suppress a shiver at the tingling feeling of Harry’s magic across his skin.
The man snorted in agreement. “Honestly, you’re right. This whole thing has been more trouble than it’s worth. I might just go and grab a pint instead.”
“It’s—but—” Potter’s breathing was ragged. “I—he said he went to spend the evening with Harry Potter? He actually said that?”
“And when valerian interacts with the ingredients of a Draught of Peace, it yields calmness, but when it’s—”
Harry felt himself blush, hard. “I… er… I was hoping that would convince you.”
Of course, nothing was laughable at all. Not even when Potter’s eyebrows furrowed slightly. “Excuse me?”
Harry felt like he’d been punched in the stomach.
“I have plenty more!” Draco declared when Potter made another dive at his belt. “Just because I want you doesn’t mean I can allow—”
“Mr. Longbottom, rub this on your arm, please.”
“All right, all right, don’t say it.” Draco sounded slightly inconvenienced but not the least bit discouraged. “You’re clearly overwhelmed enough as it is, so I won’t force it. You’ll say it eventually. I’m in no rush.”
Draco turned back to Pomfrey, accepting the phial from her with a warm, “Thank you.”
Draco pulled on the ropes securing his arms to the headboard. They would not give. They forced him to stay in place, unable to fight Potter’s unrelenting assault, or do anything but moan and arch his back and yank helplessly. Potter kept watching his face, eyes shining, staring while Draco surely looked ridiculous, all red and expression twisted up in sheer, unadulterated pleasure. He could even feel tears escaping his eyes, impossible to inhibit.
Draco wanted to be offended. Truly. But he also completely agreed.
Potter was speaking, keeping up an endless litany in Draco’s ear. “I love you.
Potter grinned again. He leaned up and fastened his mouth to Draco’s bicep, kissing and sucking it hard. Draco hissed, squirming under the pressure, the wet and hot and pleasure and stinging pain. Potter kept sucking until a large spot of Draco’s skin glistened a deep red-quickly-turning-to-purple. Potter admired his handiwork for a few moments before his eyes flicked slightly upward—and then Potter froze again.
Malfoy considered this. Then, he seemed contented. “I knew it. It’s so much better when you say my name.”
One night, Potter rubbed his tired eyes beneath his glasses. “I’m starving,” he said. “I need food or my brain is going to shut off.”
Draco blinked. His mind was still sluggish from his orgasm, but he felt like Harry’s words definitely were not what he was meant to be saying right now. “What?” he asked stupidly.
Potter slammed his hips in, hard, and Draco he let out the most undignified shriek of pleasure he had ever uttered. Potter let out a happy little moan of his own and bent his head down to mouth wetly against Draco’s neck. “Good, so good,” Potter hissed between kisses. “So fucking pretty. I could listen to you all night.”
Draco nodded frantically, willing to do anything for him. “Harry,” he begged, the word rolling off his tongue so easily it felt meant for his mouth. “Harry,
“Actually, if you don’t mind, I kind of love having Draco Malfoy tied up,” Potter admitted with a devilish grin. “I’ve been imagining it for years.”
Malfoy opened his mouth, getting ready to hurl back another insult. But before he could speak, Professor Slughorn’s voice boomed over the class. “All right, everyone! Please take your seats.”
Apparently, since Harry Potter loved him.
From his corner of the room, Malfoy scoffed. Harry clenched his fists at the sound.
Draco’s stomach twisted with how much Potter obviously hated the idea. But his mind really was hazy with sleep, and from the wine they’d shared besides, so he accepted the offer.
He’d meant it as a joke, a sarcastic dig at Potter for having almost fatally injured him, but Potter actually nodded. “Right. Okay. Well, let’s get your kit off, I suppose.”
the bullshit I was spouting while I was barely coherent!”
“Tippy is not understanding….”
It was a weeks-long project, requiring countless hours and overtime. It was misery to work together, but the intensity of the work and its long duration left little room to focus on their animosity toward each other. Their dialogue consisted less and less of jabs and insults, and instead consisted of exchanging information about the case. They even helped each other, pointing out valuable details or offering advice, once or twice even mentioning that the other had done something well. It was still barely bearable, but at least it was that much.
Draco gasped. He was fairly certain he squeaked, as well. However, he also had no idea if he was capable of breathing at all, so maybe neither thing occurred.
got it? I am not marrying you as a friend. I like-like you. I like-like-like you.”
“Will we be ingesting the potions, Professor?”
Potter beamed. “
One day, Potter said he wasn’t interested in dining out together. Draco hated himself for the way his heart sank. He nodded anyway, obviously not wanting to admit such a thing to Potter.
Harry was reeling so much he thought he might collapse. “How you—feel?” he stammered, so confused he didn’t know where to begin. “What does that even—what do you mean, you don’t know who I am but you know how you
Harry’s lungs felt like they were going to spontaneously combust. He couldn’t—this wasn’t how he should— “Draco…”
Of course, Draco knew he would never actually go through with it—that he would find the source of Potter’s loss of sanity and immediately get him help. But even though he was only agreeing for the sake of making Potter cooperate, the very act of saying it out loud was going to make Draco’s body temperature rise about eighty degrees. “Yes,” he said, promptly realising that he had been correct in his prediction.
Across the room, Harry was distinctly aware of Malfoy working, moving, breathing. It was like an itch under his skin that he couldn’t scratch. And any time he gave into the urge and looked over at Malfoy, Malfoy noticed and glared right back.
“All right then!”
And then, for good measure, he made Potter conduct sanity tests on Draco. Despite how utterly impossible such a verdict had to be, Draco was proven mentally sound as well.
Malfoy ignored him. He directed his next words to Harry. “Who are those people?”
“All right, my boy,” Slughorn said to Malfoy abruptly. “I believe it’s time for you to go to Madam Pomfrey. She’ll get you sorted at once.”
“Oh my
“No, I—” Draco stuttered over his words, scared to admit it. If he admitted it, then no matter what happened, he would have
He reached a hand up and began to toy with the hair at the nape of Harry’s neck. He didn’t seem to notice or care that every tiny touch made Harry's breath hitch. Harry felt at each point of contact like his skin was on
“Right, I’d imagine,” Potter murmured. He was examining the Mark intensely, with the kind of heated focus that had always thrilled Draco when he’d seen it on the Quidditch pitch, or while Potter was fighting his myriad antagonists over the years. (Draco, himself, having been among the myriad antagonists.) “You didn’t have to put it on, you know,” Potter continued. His brows were furrowed. “That takes extra dedication, even for you.”
Potter pounded him relentlessly, the angle of his thrusts changing ever so slightly each time, until suddenly Draco ignited from the inside out. A smile split Potter’s face so brightly it practically made the air around him glow.
Draco tilted his head up, needy and desperate, and Potter granted his wish by ducking down and kissing him.
Professor Slughorn was in the dungeons, hurriedly preparing the strongest Memory Potion he could brew. Malfoy’s parents had been contacted, to see if their presences would jog Malfoy’s memory. They were made to leave when he had not recognised them at all.
“Let me,” Potter repeated, reaching up and beginning to unbutton Draco’s shirt. “Come on, Malfoy. Let me fuck you,
Harry felt a sharp pain in his chest at that. “No, I really don’t think you will.”
“Now you say my name,” Malfoy prompted. His voice sounded impossibly gentle. “They told me what it is, but it sounded strange. Please, I want to hear you say it.”
“As much as I hate to interact with you on a daily basis, it would seem that I am forced to spend even more time with you tonight,” Draco went on, lest Potter think for a second that Draco wanted to be here. “Trust those incompetent secretaries to misfile everything. Consequently, and much to my chagrin, I need you to go through them with me and—”
Potter was looking at his Dark Mark.
“Gladly!” he all but screeched. “I’m leaving the Dodderson files on your table and you had better finish every single page before Robards comes in tomorrow, or I will not hesitate to trash your office. Merlin knows it would be an improvement to that fucking pigsty anyway!”
That seemed to break the spell on their audience.
Harry’s eyes turned suddenly murderous. “If you try to tell anyone about this, no one will believe you. So don’t even bother.”
“I want a redo of every one of our dates,” Harry said, nipping at Draco’s bottom lip and making Draco giggle breathlessly. “Did you seriously not think they were dates? Draco, just so we are clear, you are as un-friend-zoned as it is possible to be. Got it?”
skive off my engagements tonight if I could.”
. Something was going on. Obviously. Draco just needed to collect his wits and figure it out.
Draco’s heart was pounding despite the fact that he wasn’t moving and didn’t plan on it. “Yes,” he said, because it was all he’d ever wanted and more. Because it was the best thing he could ever imagine his life being, and he’d never known it was an option.
Harry had the intense urge to pinch himself. This was beyond anything he could ever have thought up, not even in his most bizarre fever dream.
Hermione and Ron had evidently come to check where Harry had hurried off to. Now, they had stopped frozen in their tracks in the middle of the spectators.
Whatever Draco had been about to say evaporated from his mind. “Get on with it?” he repeated.
Draco kissed Harry’s forehead. Right on top of the faded scar, the one that reminded him every day just how much Harry liked to make the world a better place. “Too late,” he said with a grin.
“I love you, too,” Harry whispered back.
“Whoa!” he said, jumping a little at the feeling. “That’s a Vitamix Potion.”
He fixed those brilliantly green eyes on Draco. Draco wanted to fidget, to flinch away from the praise. But Harry’s gaze held him more pinned than the chains binding him to the bed.
Draco was whining between words, unsure how much was actually intelligible at this point, crying and yanking fruitlessly at the ropes and begging Harry to keep going, never to do anything else but keep fucking Draco into oblivion.
“Well, I do believe it,” Harry said. He realised the moment the words left his mouth that they were true.
Oh, well, he sighed as Harry finally unchained him and tangled Draco up in his arms instead. They’d make up for all that eventually. And there would be time for marriage proposals in due course, too.
. Then, if you have no more objections…”
Potter made a sound that Draco realised was the beginning of Potter crying, too. Potter threw his arms around Draco and squeezed him tight against Potter’s chest. “Oh my gods,” he whispered in Draco's ear. “How…
Potter towered over him, wand trained on him again. “Who are you?”
“Not waterproof… not bloody waterproof…”
Potter’s position, he realised, was kneeling on one knee. In his hands was a ring, and he was holding it up.
He shook his head affectionately, and then cleared his throat. “See you on the other side,” he bade Harry, shooting him a crooked smile that made Harry’s heart throb.
Potter blinked. Insanely, Potter latched on the most random of Draco’s words. “
It was more than Harry had expected him to say so soon. The meaning behind the words was as clear as though he’d shouted it from the rooftops:
It was painful to say. Still, Draco only rolled his eyes. Then he schooled his face into complete seriousness. “Look, Harry. If you really believe I hate you, then I’m so beyond sorry for treating you that way… I can’t even begin to tell you how sorry I am. And if that means you hate me back, then my heart will be broken forever.”
“Holy fuck, holy bloody buggering shit—”
Except. What a strange thing to say?
Draco had to force himself to speak so that he could distract himself from ogling Potter in all his t-shirt-and-joggers glory, as it was both pitiful of Draco to find him so attractive and, also, as Draco ogled him far too often at work already. “Hello,” he announced. “I—”
about things, and Draco’s stomach was twisting unpleasantly. “I get it. The scars demonstrate the pinnacle of export spellwork. But please, admire their craftsmanship another time, yeah?”
could you possibly think we weren’t…?”
He had similarly, since almost the very beginning of their lifelong feud, imagined tying Potter up, and doing all sorts of things to Potter while the Gryffindor was bound and helpless. And then, as the years had gone by, new fantasies had sneaked into his head about
The students let out gasps, and Slughorn paled. “Good heavens, I didn’t know! But, not to worry! The reaction won’t be dangerous, I assure you—this is a very weak potion, and the combination of ingredients neutralises hellebore’s typically poisonous properties. It won’t…”
Harry redressed, cleaning both of them with a muttered
Harry’s legs did give out now.
Draco momentarily couldn’t breathe. He’d known Potter had suspected he had it, but Draco had done everything in his power to keep those suspicions from being confirmed.
. What he did was absently bring a hand up and touch his fingers to his own lips. As though utterly amazed at what had just been pressed against them, and scared to let himself believe such things were possible.
“Yes you
Harry felt like he was going to burst with it, too. He felt like he was glowing from the inside out.
He fought the urge to turn around, to check to see if Malfoy was indeed impressed.
just to get relief. No wonder Potter had downed so much alcohol—so he wouldn’t be so put off by Draco’s Draco-ness that he couldn’t get his much needed release.
The call disconnected. There was a long pause. Then, Potter came running back into the room. He stared at Draco, looking more terrified than Draco had ever seen the Saviour of the Wizarding World look in his life.
Holy hell. He couldn’t breathe.
“Yes, Malfoy, talk snarky to me,” Potter whispered. His smile had a strange sort of relish to it that Draco couldn’t begin to understand. “It’s amazing. You’re just as much of a tosser now as always.”
Draco outright laughed now. “Whatever you say, Harry.”
Not breaking the desperate kiss, Draco somehow found a way to push up and straddle Harry’s lap. Harry let out a squeak, but Draco's mouth muffled the sound. Before Harry’s exploding mind could catch up and make his arms push Draco away, Draco was grabbing Harry’s hands and manoeuvring them onto his hips.
Draco barely even understood that he’d spoken, because he couldn’t feel his mouth or any part of his body. “What?” he repeated.
. Draco might have actually sobbed now. He couldn’t tell, though, too lost in the sensations to control what his mouth did. But Potter didn’t speed up again, just continued that maddeningly slow slide, pulling out almost all the way before pushing back in, pressing firmly against Draco’s prostate and letting the feeling linger. Then doing it all over again.
Harry walked toward Draco until they were face to face. Draco pressed himself further against the wall, looking alarmed at the closeness. “Well,” Harry decided, “then I guess I’ll just have to convince you.”
?” Draco demanded, reeling back around.
“No, I mean, do you
“No! That wasn’t supposed to—it was supposed to be some random bloke from a club!”
“Yeah, okay,” he murmured in consent to Pomfrey’s tests when she returned. Then he added, even more quietly, “But… I’m sure I’ll be fine. I know Harry. That’s what matters most of all.”
“Have you seriously fantasised about me for years?” Draco asked.
, okay? What I did with you, I mean… it’s perverted as hell. I know you feel the same way; you can admit it.”
The room around them erupted in applause.
would he say that?” Potter shrieked. He sounded almost hysterical.
“Why does my head hurt?” Malfoy interjected petulantly.
Draco let out a sound that could be classified as a whimper. Except definitely not, because something nefarious was going on, so he could not succumb. “W-what?” he managed, feeling faint but desperate to hold onto some shred of his sanity.
Harry shook his head. “Even if you still… even if you did, you would never admit it. You’d act the same, and everything would be just like before.”
don’t want this?”
“Mal—Draco. You and I aren’t—er—well, what I mean is, we’re not together.”
Now, Malfoy was standing right in front of him, and the air between them seemed to prickle. Harry felt it burn around them as he stepped forward, too, just short of physically touching Malfoy. Their faces a hair’s breath away from being pressed together, Harry glared back into Malfoy’s eyes just as harshly. For an indeterminable length of time, they stayed in that position, both refusing to break their intense eye contact or disrupt the sizzling tension.
“African Red Pepper, sir.”
The other students were as shocked as he was, judging by how their hands slackened. Malfoy tore out of their loosened grips and hurled himself at Harry again. This time, he wrapped his arms around Harry’s torso and buried his face in Harry’s neck. “Yours,” Malfoy confirmed, in a breathy whisper against his skin that sent a shiver down Harry’s spine.
“Excuse me, are you even listening?”
Draco panted, trying to regain control of himself. It was merely a handjob, after all. Certainly nothing for Draco to have a
“What? No.” Harry sounded surprised by the question. “It’s the Draco Malfoy thing.”
Warily, Parvati accepted the proffered phial and obeyed. “Oh!” she said with a start. “That cleans teeth.”
When still nothing happened, Draco sighed. “You know, if you promise not to Obliviate me, I think I’d be quite comfortable to stay chained to this bed all night. Your mattress is ever so soft.”
to him. But admitting that to himself would have been admitting he desperately needed something he could never have. And now Potter was trying to make him admit it, in order to humiliate him. “What else would it be?” he ground out bitterly.
He didn’t seem to mind that he forgot to kick Draco out of the bed, so they shared it that night. It proved not to be terribly uncomfortable for either of them, so they continued with this easier practice from then on.
Malfoy was the one who spoke next. He curled himself against Harry’s side, pulling Harry’s limp arm until it wrapped around his waist, and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. “What’s your name?”
Somewhere along the line, though, Potter must have snuck his hand down and finally dealt with Draco’s belt. The next thing Draco knew, there was a split-second warning of slightly colder air around his groin, before Potter’s hand was wrapping around Draco’s cock.
. These fantasies had horrified him, and confused him. And naturally aroused him beyond reason. He’d tried to ignore them.
Harry was kissing him again. Draco found himself kissing back so fiercely he was soon running out of air. But he kept kissing anyway. Even when his crying tumbled away and was replaced by wet laughter.
, I love you. So
“So, I have added…?”
“What does it look like?” Malfoy scoffed, as though the answer should be obvious. He reached a hand up and began playing with the collar of Harry’s shirt.
Harry stepped forward.
“Well, I know I will. So let me do enough knowing for the both of us.”
Seamus waved the comments off. “But he’s got nothin’ about his life, y’know? He’s practically a blank slate. Can you even imagine?”
“He was—I—you—you spilled ink on yourself last week and took your shirt off to clean it! You were shirtless in your office and it was all I could think about for
He began to rock them. Draco just went along, letting Potter move them, feeling the warmth of Potter’s embrace through his whole body as Draco sobbed. They sat like that for a while.
will.”
Pomfrey recovered herself and seized a phial out of Slughorn’s hands. “Professor Slughorn has prepared the antidote. We’re quite certain this will do the trick.”
“Harry, we were so worried when you ran off like th—Merlin’s pants!”
He walked up the front steps and knocked on the door—deliberately loudly and incessantly, just to piss Potter off.
,” was Potter’s horrified response.
Finally, Potter downed a few giant gulps in a row, as though steeling himself for some formidable task, and then asked Draco if he could kiss him.
“You…
The truth was, even Harry didn’t really know why he was taking this class. He didn’t particularly like the subject, nor did he need it to graduate. Hermione praised such a noble desire to expand his knowledge, and he pretended to believe innocent curiosity about Potions was his only motivation. But Potions alone wouldn’t have been enough to make his day interesting. No, he found himself drawn to other aspects of this class. To a certain boy in it. And
“Fuck, those sounds are pretty,” Potter went on. He was panting shakily with the effort it probably took not to speed up. But Potter had always been infuriatingly stubborn, and now was certainly no exception. “Always wondered what that voice would sound like while you were fucking. I wonder if proper little Draco Malfoy is a
Fuck, since when did the sun shine so bright? Since when was the world so beautiful?
“Some of you will be, yes. Others might simply smell them, or apply them topically. But, not to fear. I assure you that all of these potions are perfectly mundane. Headache relief or clearing the sinuses, that sort of thing. No strong effects at all.” He walked over to his desk and sat down. “Well, everyone… off you go!”
“I can’t believe he doesn’t—”
“Do you not remember the part where I said I wanted you?” Draco snapped.
He saw Malfoy sitting up in bed, his hair for once free of gel, and looking all the more rumpled and soft because of it. His expression was innocent and unguarded as he looked around the room without recognising anything in it.
“Yes, that’s right, it’s ridiculous,” complained the man. “I put on a bit of Glamour Spray and it’s wearing off in this mist! I’m going to be late, and now I have to go and reapply…”
Malfoy cocked his head to the side with a thoughtful hum. He walked to the stove, taking the pan from him with a smirk. Harry watched as Malfoy pulled his lips in a thin line.
“It won’t –” He paused with a soft sigh. The artifact was a potential risk if he couldn’t obliterate it. Yet, it was confidential information. Malfoy couldn’t find out. “right, it might.”
The plan – The one he had devised with Ron and Hermione – had headed south, and he was sent to a fucking Island, but it hadn’t failed. Not entirely.
And Malfoy laughed.
A pause.
He felt as if he was intruding.
He felt an intense pain in his head. With an uneven exhale, he perched himself on the bed, and glanced around the room in suspicion, paranoid over the nightmare and the fear which was yet to subside.
Potter had said it in such a small voice, laced with regret and Draco had absent-mindedly reached out to comfort the brunet with a touch. One brief touch.
He couldn't resist.
“Don’t you dare,” Draco said, in a low voice. “Go on about my father.”
He narrowed his eyes at Malfoy, and pressed the nozzle of the can. He ducked. And ran. Harry chased him to the living room, a slow smile forming on his lips. “Get back here, Malfoy.”
“Why are you here, Potter?”
“No.” He said, staring into the grey eyes. He had never been fond of lying, because he was pathetic at it. Well, he couldn’t manipulate the truth either. “I have to leave. The war –
“Precisely.” Malfoy said, pouring the batter into the pan with a ladle, an evident smile etched onto his face and it caused the irritating little flutter in Harry's chest. “I can continue with
It a sort of sky he would paint.
“Oh, have you?”
A silence engulfed them. Pregnant and uncomfortable. Maybe Malfoy was still pissed off about the entire ‘
“Kiss me.”
In retrospect, he shouldn’t have mentioned the incident. Or the fact that he had never truly detested Potter. Or that despite the incident in the sixth year, he still couldn’t find a way to detest Harry Potter.
He half-turned to leave, the weight of tears behind his eyelids getting heavier by the moment, and whispered a soft, “I didn’t have one.”
“You had the fucking audacity to keep it from me.” The blond inched closer, and his eyes were radiating stone-cold fury and his fists were clenched to the side – nails digging into his palm – as he trembled slightly. “Bon sang, Potter. Out of pity, you decided to –
On that night, Draco Malfoy draped a warm blanket over Harry Potter. He watched, as the flames of the fireplace danced across his face. And a warmth coursed through him, even if only for a brief moment.
He was slightly fortified by the moderate success, he concentrated on the shell and willed it to float to his hand. The magic was stirring inside him, in a slow pace. The shell floated to his hand, and the stir halted.
“I didn’t want to hurt you,” He said in a small voice. “We were dueling. In the spur of moment, I – I – It was the only spell in my mind and I cast it without thinking –
He was twisting in the air, and he was falling.
It was like myriads of blue gems were glistening. He had been watching the stars at night, and he had fallen asleep. He had woken up to the chirping of the birds at a distance and the rustling of the trees.
The blond pursed his lips in impatience, staring at him with steady, earnest eyes. Interested in finding out what the artifact was, if not a regular pocket-watch. “I want you to clue me in on that thing.”
The kiss sent electricity down his spine. Draco grinned as he pulled away, burying his head in his neck. Harry rested his head on top of his boyfriend’s, and they stayed in that position as the snow engulfed them. “Want to build a snowman?”
“You don’t have any traits to qualify as a Malfoy,” Draco said, with a small smile on his lips. “But I still love you, don’t I?”
“Yes, sure,” He said in a slow, sarcastic drawl, while he, with a brief moment of consideration, inched closer to the blond, “sure, you don’t care.”
The silvery mist began to take a vague shape; tall, with four legs and a long neck, floating in the cold air for a minute or two until it vanished. “I – It was – well, vague.”
As soon as he detected a flake in his mouth, Draco would gulp it down faster than a fish reaching for bait. Harry walked up to him, carefully wrapping his hands around his waist. Draco nuzzled into him, enjoying the body heat radiating off his body.
"Love," Harry places a small, tender kiss on Draco's cheek. "we can't come to the Astronomy Tower every night."
He shouldn’t be here. Not with Malfoy. He didn’t have a wand to defend himself, and he was worn out. He didn’t have the strength to apparate out of here.
“I’ve been there, Malfoy.” He said, with a dismissive shrug. “You wanted to vent it out. The guilt. The loss of your father – It’s your way of dealing with grief.”
In conclusion, he couldn’t ignore Malfoy for more than five seconds. He could barely resist a sarcastic retort. Plus, teaching Malfoy to produce a corporeal Patronus ensued a few serious conversations and he wasn’t certain if he wanted to converse with Draco Malfoy. “Why a stag?”
The blond tensed and frowned at the sand, and in a soft voice, he whispered, “Of the nights when mother would read fairy-tales at night – when I was –” He paused “eleven.”
A familiar dread settled in. His sunken stomach did an almighty flip, and fear coursed through him. He didn’t even know if they were safe. Or alive.
A silence lingered in the air for a moment and for a second, he was certain that the blond wouldn’t reply, yet, he breathed a laden, quivering exhale, and whispered, “I’ve trusted you for a while now, Potter.”
on fire and reattain the peace and quiet you had when I wasn’t around, and I didn’t want you to come up with any new ideas – and with a minute of consideration – oh, we’re not on first-name basis.”
forget about it.”
He fished out the pocket-watch. It was warmer, and emitting that familiar dark feeling, pulsing with raw magic.
to even think about the chill.”
"I do," He curled his fingers at Draco with a faint smile. "would you want to?"
Draco sent him one last withering glare, and walked away. He turned his gaze back to the ocean, and watched the waves. He exhaled softly, and the sound of the waves calmed him down.
“Yes,” He said, and drew his lips into a thin line as Draco arched an eyebrow at him. “Scar, I suppose.”
“Oh, you’re still the overachieving Chosen One, aren’t you?”
“No,” Harry mumbled, with a long sigh. “If I did, we would’ve been in a duel. Or I would’ve hurt you – On the day I was sent here – without a second thought.”
“Oh, of course, you can’t.” Harry said, a small puff of air forming in front of his face. “I can’t –” Draco quivered and drew the cloak closer with a faint chatter of teeth. “Draco –”
“Why, thank you – It’s a privilege to be the worst the Chosen One has ever trained – wait, didn’t you run a small group in the fifth year, Potter?”
He lifted his eyes off the floor with a soft huff, a corner of the mouth curving into the well-practiced smirk while he said, “Oh, what’s the fun in that, Potter?”
If Malfoy was using the note as an incentive to coerce him into writing one, he wasn’t planning to. He could’ve written:
“No, you’re right,” Draco’s features were of a bored-mien, fingers fidgeting with the ring on the mantel. He scrunched up his nose, chewing on his bottom lip. “we’re enemies, aren’t we?”
Harry laughed, as he set his tea down. It was absurd. Harry Potter did not laugh with Draco Malfoy. He never shared a quip. An insult, sure. A quip? No. “It’s suits you, really.”
He cursed under his breath. “It’s – erm – No, I didn’t.”
Potter wasn’t around. He never was. He was near the shore, levitating a seashell. He had walked out of the house after breakfast, considering that neither of them was intent on having a conversation.
"I – I had to consider for a while before telling you what exactly it is." Harry whispered and sounded so earnest, like the truth was flowing straight out of his heart and mind. Draco didn't want to think about it.
“If you give me one of yours, I’ll give you one of mine.”
“Fantastic – We have to deal with each other. We should bake in peace, and you – blond Stuart Little – can return to your bedroom after that.”
It sparked one of the memories he had forgotten. A memory of when he was in front of the Mirror of Erised with Ron in the first year. He’d said similar words.
“Right, of course, you won’t,” Draco said in a murmur, fingers twitching at the side, shifting in place with a soft grunt, and turning his head to glare at the brunet. “
“Yeah, it is.” Malfoy muttered, with a scowl “It’s Otryzan, Potter. Not Ogygia. And I’m not Calypso. The Dark Lord wanted me to suffer, not send me on a vacation. If I use my magic, the Island provides. It does not obey.”
The warmth of the brunet’s fingers lingered for a brief second. Draco sorted through the memories, searching for something even happier, which preferably didn’t include Narcissa but he wasn’t certain if he could find one.
“Right.”
“Can you rest for a while and tone down the ‘I can function without resting’ bit? You can’t. It’s Otryazan, and it’s taxing to perform a simple charm. It will resist the magic, if it isn’t its own.”
Perhaps he didn’t care. Not entirely. Yet, the words caused a stab of pain in the chest and he couldn’t ignore it.
“You – wait,
“Can I – what?”
With a minute of consideration, he yanked Draco sideways with the collar of his cloak and was halfway on top of the blond, pinning him down with one thigh, and Malfoy’s lips split into a smile. “Quite finished, Malfoy?”
“It’s a –” Draco’s words were cut short when his fingers uncurled from the counter and he stumbled forward with a soft yelp.
Harry Potter was stubborn. He was not going to give up, and he definitely wasn’t going to stay.
He probably should’ve retorted with something along the lines of ‘
’ bit wasn’t on his to-do list. Or on any to-do list. It was on the not to-do list. He didn’t have one.
“You should.”
"That still doesn't change the fact that despite having been here for a few weeks, you found no reason to trust me enough," that hurt to say more than he thought it would, "enough to at least tell me about a fucking cup that could possibly get both of us killed."
A lot.
“No,” He had a bit of a tremble to his voice. It was sort of pained. “Holding the man – It’s on the kitchen counter with – wait, I can summon it.”
“He did,” Potter chuckled sort of sinisterly, as he half-turned to leave. He directed an intimidating glare at Draco, and he laced his voice with venom as he said, “If he didn’t – I wouldn’t fucking be with you.”
hello!
“Did it occur to you that he saved your fucking life, Potter?”
“Yeah,” Malfoy muttered. “We did.”
“I – what?”
A little bit like his own life. It’s complicated and kind of sad, but it still has the little moments of simple contentment. It shouldn’t have a perfect ending, if his life has never been perfect.
“Oh, I’ll wear the dress,” Draco drawled while he sipped the wine while he peered into Harry’s eyes, which caused a wild stutter in his chest. “it’s a perfect fit, isn’t it?”
More fighting
The corners of Draco’s mouth curved into a small, brief smile, which wasn’t the reaction the brunet had anticipated, yet he was
“Confused, why?”
He was angling for a quip – for the familiar comfort of antagonism – but it seemed to have infuriated Draco. Perhaps it was rather daft to push it with Draco Malfoy, but the sincere words had caused a surge of panic within him.
“I – er – Got you a few clothes.” Malfoy said, staring fixedly at the floor and cleared his throat. “And – erm, you can put them in the wardrobe. It has plenty of space.”
He stared at the mirror. It was misty. Unclear.
Draco couldn’t leave the country. He was constantly under watch by the Ministry – But it never was a hindrance, until now. “You’ll leave it behind, to recover? Did it occur to you, that I don’t want you to go?”
“Morning, mon ange,” he breathed in return, reaching out to brush snow off the locks of his hair. Harry touched their foreheads together, relishing the moment alone with him. Draco wrapped his arms around his neck. Harry leaned in, capturing his lips in a short kiss.
"Oh, of course I want to," He cast a contemptuous glance around and scowled at the cameras. "the prophet, however, is a royal pain in the arse and as much as I’d love to show off the dress or the perfect make-up, the eyeliner to be rather precise –” Draco softened. “I wouldn’t want you deal with the others.”
Harry’s fingers twitched and curled into a fist at the side when he stepped further from the blond, cursing under his breath. “Malfoy I –” He clamped his lips together, while taking another step back. “I’m sorry.”
“You were fond of Weasley who insulted the
“Oh, only because you cast a corporeal Patronus on your first try –
“I’ve seen it.” He said, and gave a soft tap to the scar on his forehead to clarify. “He was trying to save you.”
“Never,” Draco said, and he detected a slight shake to his head. Harry laughed, and pressed closer to him to steal his warmth. Draco pulled off one of his jackets, draping it over his shoulder. “I asked you to get another jacket.”
He had struck a nerve. In hindsight, he shouldn’t have played the Sirius Black card. He had witnessed a momentary flicker of guilt across Potter’s face. He didn’t suppose that Potter would bare his soul in front of Draco Malfoy. Not again. Not after Draco had used it against him.
“Thank you for the encouragement, Potter.”
The sun was rising at a distance, casting a warm, rosy glow upon the Island. The tree leaves were rustling, and he could vaguely hear the soft chirping of a few birds. The brunet sighed, as he opened his eyes and stared at the horizon.
He was familiar with the basic concept of dark artefacts. Yet, the one the brunet owned was sort of odd. It wasn’t, however, a pretext for what he had said. Draco was a connoisseur at masking emotions but keeping the hurt out of his voice seemed nearly impossible then. Apparently, there were some things a Malfoy wasn't trained for after all. “It’s always been screwed up, hasn't it? What’s your point?”
Draco’s mouth was caught open. Eyes wide. He exhaled a small puff of air. It was minty. The cut closed. “w-what?”
“Finding a way to Neverland, Potter?”
“Why Rapunzel?”
“I – sure.” Malfoy stared at him uncertainly, the corner of his lip twitching and it curled into a soft smile. “We can have crepes for breakfast.”
A deep growl escaped his mouth. Without a thought, he punched Potter. Over and over again. He didn’t fight back, only winced in pain. Draco wrestled him to the ground, his chest heaving with pain and rage. It pressed against Potter’s as they tumbled across the sand, and punched him in the jaw once more. “WHY AREN’T YOU FIGHTING BACK, POTTER?”
“Oh why would I clue you in about it?”
“Mhm, yeah.”
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Harry muttered. “Venus reminds me of you.”
“Oh, we are. But,” Draco said in a strained voice, biting the insides of his cheek to distract himself from the next stab of pain in the chest. “We’re all born into our ways of life. We have to play in those ways.”
He wasn’t sure he wanted to. Not after he had painted the night sky on the canvas. And it was beautiful. A fine piece of art. It was beautiful in the chaos. A chaos – Infinite and eternal.
“Perhaps I do.”
“You’ve been staring at the wall for ages, Potter.”
He directed the wand in the circular motion, with the brunet’s hand still clasped in his own. It caused the tiny flutter to return. “slow, steady and a precise circular movement.”
Draco stuttered out an incoherent mumble, which caused the brunet to chuckle for a brief minute until the shiver returned, “which, by the way, was a kind act – unwise, but kind.”
"No, she's right," He said while he fidgeted with the sleeve absent-mindedly, staring at the blond with earnest, expectant eyes, mouth curling into a small, proud smirk when a faint pink tint started to form on Draco's face. "I couldn't resist."
A corner of Draco’s mouth lifted for a brief second and it caused the brunet to scoff and to quirk a brow, waiting for a retort. “Not fond of cameras on you when you’re out in public?”
"Can we -" The brunet's voice cracked while Draco lifted a brow at him and a corner of his mouth curved upward while he placed the glass of wine on the table. "Circe fuck -"
“No, we’re not sworn rivals,” He paced over the other side of the counter. “You’re a Malfoy with blond hair and posh robes,” Draco softened and cracked a small, uncertain smile, “we’re friends.”
“Is that concern I detect in your voice?”
He wished Malfoy would’ve written that down and left it on the counter. And he would’ve retorted with a clever quip. He wanted a light banter with Malfoy.
He hadn’t had a friend for eleven years. It was sort of surreal to register the fact that Draco Malfoy wanted to be his friend. It wasn’t an idea he couldn’t entertain, yet it was a rather daft one. Perhaps, It might work out. Or not. He wasn't certain.
Draco just laughed. "Of course, you want me, Potter. If you didn't then you wouldn't be here, and your hand wouldn’t be on my arse.”
“Probably,” He said in a low whisper. “I find the endings to be rather enchanting – The closing paragraphs, the final page of the novel. The final sentence or the final words of the character.”
“Voldemort has a pale complexion. If anything, he is The Pale-as-a-chalk Lord.”
on the train in our first year?”
He placed a slice of lemon on the side of Malfoy’s cup, casting a wandless heating charm to keep it warm. He sipped his own tea, and walked to the window. It was cloudy, and the sea was turbulent. The seagulls were standing still, like stone statues keeping a silent vigil over a fresh grave.
. Sweet mother of Merlin.
And he and Harry would worry about rewriting those files later.
The man groaned in frustration and dropped his hand. His nose looked almost laughably bizarre, one side smooth and pointy and the other side oddly crooked. Draco fought to keep in his giggles.
, Potter!” he shrieked. Even Pomfrey and Slughorn were watching the unfolding scene in awe. They were so rapt that they didn’t even bother to scold Draco for his language.
“Push past it,” Draco said. “We haven’t done enough to justify taking off for the night.”
—Harry Potter.
“You’re rambling,” Harry interrupted. He felt so happy it was insane.
“How do you know about the Dodderson case,” Potter said, his voice so deep and threatening he didn’t even bother to turn up the end of the sentence to make it a question. “How do you know what my office looks like.”
Draco spluttered inarticulately for a few seconds, and then demanded, “Have you been hexed? If this is a hostage situation, blink twice.”
This night proved no exception. Potter’s plan ended up being so beneficial that they did the same thing the next day, and the next. At one point they even upgraded to eating at finer establishments, and during actual dinnertime. And, as this worked so well, Potter eventually suggested they work together through lunches, too.
He had no idea why he was trying to defend himself to Potter. Hell, this was sounding much less like a fast-paced and passionate shag and more like a slow and emotional therapy session.
Potter scooted closer to him, placing a tentative hand on Draco’s arm. “I
Draco blushed hard. “What can I say? You were persuasive.”
Potter dove at Draco again and attacked his mouth. The kiss was so thorough that Draco’s toes curled, his mind went fuzzy, and he was fairly certain at one point he forgot his own name.
His legs wound up wrapped around Harry’s hips, and Harry lowered his body all the way, covering every inch of Draco with warmth, sending sparks all through him. “Well then, Draco Malfoy-soon-to-be-Malfoy-Potter, prepare to be formally seduced.”
“Right you are,” he said with an awkward laugh. “Clever indeed. Now—”
“Fuck, you’re so hot like this,” Potter said. And maybe Draco could hear just enough to discern those words, he supposed. How lucky, considering hearing Potter say them would probably fuel his wank fantasies for years to come. “You’re always so beautiful. I can’t believe I get to see you in my bed.”
But he hadn’t meant them the way Draco had interpreted. What he’d actually meant was something to quite the opposite effect entirely.
Draco tilted his head back, letting the happiness and the magic of the universe fill him. Harry was everywhere, holding him, making him sigh.
Potter’s eyes became unsure. “What do you mean, ‘what?’”
“Professor,” Hermione broke in loudly. “The syrup of hellebore. It binds the potion together. It—”
Harry Potter was as much a Gryffindor in the sheets as everywhere else, Draco reflected. One challenging remark thrown his way, and all of a sudden he was pouring everything into it, brash and bold and intense as always.
talk was always uncomfortable, with everyone. But Harry was not making it easier with the way he was looking at Draco right now.
“—left in its volatile form, it assumes properties of a—”
on the crime ring they’d just busted
“Oi, Harry, where’re you goin’?”
“Because I fucking solved it with you! And I was prepared to rewrite the whole fucking thing with you tonight if you hadn’t jumped me like a rabid animal!”
“Someone, take this boy to the Hospital Wing,” Slughorn commanded.
Malfoy’s tongue swept into his mouth, and Harry was so shocked that he just let it happen. He parted Harry’s lips, tongue brushing against his with a simultaneous softness and insistence that made Harry feel faint.
you. Fuck, please, I love you.”
“Very good,” Slughorn smiled brightly. “Now—”
Potter’s hand dropped lower, and Draco didn’t notice it right away, until suddenly it was wrapped around his cock and stroking slowly, in time with Potter’s thrusts. Draco let out a reedy whimper and Potter ended the kiss to stare reverently at him.
Slughorn added the ingredients and bade Harry drink. When Harry did, he felt an immediate burst of energy.
He processed these words in the ensuing silence.
“Oh, is that what the kids are calling it these days?” Potter asked, mouth quirking up in a grin that was far too attractive to be legal.
Draco rolled his eyes. He always worked at the table. But, he supposed it was rather rude to the wait staff, and since he was ahead of schedule on this assignment, he could stand to pause on his work for enough time to have dinner.
“Harry Potter,” Malfoy repeated, testing the shape of it inside his mouth and the sound it produced. “Pretty. It suits you.”
“Potter, I have no idea what you're talking about—”
“Hey, are you—?”
Harry pulled back to see his face. The Slytherin looked positively terrified.
Potter opened the door, sporting bare feet on the carpet and smelling like delicious cologne. Upon seeing Draco, Potter’s eyebrows shot up about a mile into the air.
have fallen in love with you is ridiculous to me. And also impossible. If anything, I should be in utter shock that you would ever consider
But then, Potter had barged into Draco’s office out of nowhere, and Draco was so startled and worried Potter would glimpse the documents that he fumbled and spilled ink all over his shirt. Draco made a big show of complaining about the mess, taking his shirt off and cleaning it with extra fuss, to distract Potter from the parchment Draco had been in the middle of signing.
Draco blanched. “Convince me? What the hell is that supposed to—”
Now, Draco was quite aware he was making sounds. But he didn’t much care.
Madam Pomfrey blinked. Slughorn stared at them, too, and muttered a faint, “Merlin’s beard.”
“Yes, and that has always been the situation, as I am sure even your idiot self has managed to learn by now. So, if it's not too much trouble for your child-sized brain, we need to start looking over these files.”
Draco gasped into the kiss, and at that noise, Potter pulled his mouth away. The brunet sat back on his heels and watched his hand slide up and down Draco’s shaft. His eyes glinted brightly. Draco was going to have an aneurysm.
Potter smirked. “You’ll
, and Draco shut up.
Potter’s eyes were very round. He wasn’t blinking. “What did you do to me on the Hogwarts Express after your father was arrested?”
Someone’s bag crashed off their slackened shoulder and onto the floor. An inkwell smashed and sheets of parchment flew everywhere.
Harry pushed through the gaggle of Slytherins crowded near Malfoy’s bed. For the first time, he began to wonder whether he should have thought this through a bit more. All around him, students were talking in distressed tones.
He also realised that the crowd around him was completely silent. He had the strong suspicion that everyone was holding their breath.
Draco was certainly going to die. He had no idea how Potter could expect him to walk on steady legs all the way to a bed, so he didn’t even try not to stumble. Potter and he were holding hands. And, and walking to…
“Oh,” he said softly. “I believe I am going to…”
Draco panted, unable to control his reactions. It was just… that… Potter was astoundingly fit, okay? He always had been! And Draco had always known it! So now, Potter was here, and he was saying… and he was… well. Of course Draco could barely fucking see straight past his own desperate desire to let Potter have his way with him.
Then he noticed that Draco was beginning to tremble.
“You can’t Apparate this tired,” Potter said, turning away before Draco could see the reluctant expression he definitely wore. “Why don’t you sleep over?”
For once, why couldn’t he have a night wherein he relaxed and actually did something fun? Went to a pub, maybe read a book for pleasure, who knew? But, oh no, instead he worked late constantly, and on the one night he didn’t have anything scheduled, he had to go all the way over to bloody
"Thank you," Draco says. He rocks his hips up into Harry's fist, his little dick almost lost within Harry's fingers. He's so close to coming just from talking about his strange little fantasy of being Harry's piglet forever. "Love it when you call me piglet."
Draco can't look at him. He's fucking his own fist, and his dick's lost in it.
"Good, then?" Harry asks.
It's a deliberate while before Harry turns his attention back to Draco again. "I've finished my tea," he says. "Follow me. You can walk down the stairs and crawl downstairs." He closes his book and takes it with him, even as he's heading for the stairs, barefoot. He's wearing pyjama trousers only, and no top.
"I don't think we've tried," Harry says.
"For us," Harry says. He amends it a little. "It's hard. After Ginny. Trying gets so hard after a while. I don't know if she wants to be making food for me. I think she'd rather I was marrying Ginny, or that Ginny actually wanted to be with me. That would be easier for everyone, she thinks, and maybe she's right?"
"With your tongue," he says, sounding bored.
Harry smiles. "Good boy. My good boy. If you need to go, then you crawl to the back door to be let out? Do you understand? And if you don't want to go outside, or if you want out for a bit, then you crawl to the bathroom door and I'll take you off the leash."
Draco groans, pushing his bum up.
Draco swallows. "I could serve you your lunch," he says. "Like a proper member of your house staff."
"I hate shopping," Harry says.
Draco's skin pinks as he nods his
The only person who even sees more than a part of him is Harry Potter.
Draco whines. There's barely room in the tiny bathroom for him to do more than turn around before he has his nose pressed to Harry's thigh. His mouth hangs open, his tongue out. Harry runs his thumb across Draco's jaw. "Ready and waiting, aren't you? Always so desperate for cock, my piglet."
That goes straight to Draco’s cock. He shouldn’t like this so much but he does. He
“You’re not your father.”
Draco does. The chips are salty and hot and nice. He doesn't like the greasy fingers though, and the burger is somewhat overwhelming. He watches Harry eat his, and then copies what he does, picking it up and eating it.
"All right, then," Harry says. "Go into the toilets, will you? Get that miserable excuse for a cock out. Don't move until I get there."
"You're okay," Harry says, after a while. "You're okay just where you are."
"These are all for you, darling," Harry says. "All for my piglet." But he doesn't touch it to Draco's lips. He presses it to the tip of Draco's tiny cocklet instead, so that it gets wet with Draco's humiliated excitement. "Can't waste this, can we? You might be a filthy piglet but you clean up your own messes." The chocolate is starting to melt, but Harry doesn't speed up. He holds the chocolate in the palm of his hand, and then out for Draco to take. "No hands," he chides, as Draco automatically reaches for it.
Draco's chest expands a little. "I know. I'm happy when I'm with you, too."
"Show Jonathan your tits, Piglet," Harry says, poking Draco in the shoulder. "He doesn't get a name," Harry continues, telling
"Good," Harry says. "There's a mirror in the hall. That's where I usually do my glamour."
"The water coming down on you like rain," Harry says, fingertips trailing across his skin. "Why on your knees, Draco?"
"My pet?" Harry's hand settles back into Draco's hair, stroking. "How far do you want to take it?"
"Was that the sleeveless top?" Draco asks. "I think that's the most skin I've ever shown in my life."
"When?"
Draco drops down onto his hands and knees. His skin burns. Inside it feels like he's on fire. If his father could see him now, crawling naked on his hands and knees into the Malfoy kitchen, following Harry Potter there as he carefully unties the string around their pet shop parcel.
This, he thinks, is a new fucking low.
“I don’t know.” Draco doesn’t understand the specific reference. “Does it?”
"Like an obedient lapdog," Harry tells him. "My beautiful piglet."
"More than anything," Harry says. He bumps his knee into Draco's. "And there's a lot we could get up to in a weekend."
"Yes," Harry says. "What else?"
Dinner was served from a roasting tin and a pan in the centre of the table - almost as if Harry was saying
Draco makes a soft, whining sound in the back of his throat. He's not wearing his collar any more - he'd taken it off whilst preparing lunch, feeling oddly badly behaved for removing it without Harry's permission - but he wishes he was wearing it again now.
"Hope you're charging an arm and a leg," Harry says, interested. He's taking a good look at Draco's plans. "Never seen a plan like this. Is that what you normally do? Plan it out like this on paper?"
"It's scary."
"If it helps." Draco strokes his hand down Harry's arm. "I meant it though. I don't know what to call you. Us."
," Draco says.
Harry strokes Draco's hair. "Is that something else that you need from me?" he asks. "Sweets whenever you want them, and permission to eat them?"
," Harry says, looking like he's mulling it over. Draco's fairly certain he's not mulling anything over, and that, like Draco, he's been thinking about the two of them and what they do in some detail. "Maybe pop into Magical Menagerie and see if I can't pick one up."
"I know," Harry says. "Do you think I could do the same for you tonight? Let me pick out what you should wear?"
"I try," Harry says, and he reaches into his bag to come out with a decadent, expensive, indulgent box of chocolate truffles. He opens the box and takes a little, cocoa-dusted, cream truffle from the top layer. "I really try."
"Harry."
"Come on," Harry says later. He's no idea how much time has passed. Minutes, maybe. "Lunch time, Piglet."
"If you'll let me," Draco says. "If that's what you want. If that's what you need from me. Property of House of Potter. That doesn't change."
"I wasn't asking you to," Draco says. "I was checking you were all right. I'll go away again afterwards."
"Because I’m terrified you’ll run," Draco says, without putting too much thought into it. He draws a pattern on Harry’s arm with his fingertip, the outline of the dark mark. "I think one day you’ll wake up and you’ll think,
Draco doesn’t understand. "I can do all of that. It’s fine."
"Oh," Draco says. "Of course."
"Why didn't we apparate?" he asks in an undertone, as they follow the stream of Muggles heading for the exit.
Heat thrums over Draco's skin, his little cocklet already getting hard. Harry seems to know exactly what will turn Draco on. HIs cheeks flush.
"Well, no. And this morning you said you'd break up with me if I bought that shirt."
Harry comes on him, striping his lower back and the top of his arse, and Draco closes his eyes again, and thinks:
"What do witches wear when they go to the beach?"
He queued up to send his note, and then left for his meeting.
"I won't," Draco says. "It doesn't matter what it is. You deserve a kindness too. I think you deserve it probably a lot more than I do."
Draco raises an eyebrow.
"My brave boy," Draco says, because he can, and because the pink flush to Harry's cheeks is enough. This time he lifts their entwined hands and they touch the door together.
"It's embarrassing," Draco says.
Draco swallows down a whine.
again," Harry says.
They eat, and they're about two thirds of the way through their piles of food when Harry beams at him, eyes bright. "Is it all right?"
Draco inclines his head.
By 'civilised', Harry very clearly means 'hand-fed a naked Draco cream horns on his kitchen floor', but to all intents and purposes he seems very laid back and casual with his interpretation of the truth.
Draco's eyes feel heavy. He closes them for a minute, Harry's hand still stroking his hair.
Harry grins. He’s still looking around, at the long driveway back towards the gate, and the many castle turrets and the brick wall of the terrace that peeks around the side of the castle. If they went around there, they’d see the rest of the cultivated grounds laid out beneath them, down to the empty owlery and the other empty spaces that the lairds had used to hire falconers to manage. Beyond the grounds to the right is the sea, and to the left, the woods and the Quidditch pitch. He’d done some of his best work on that Quidditch pitch, hiding it from view, creating it so that if you flew high enough you could see the sea.
"Up you get," Harry says, and Draco looks up, bewildered, to see the magically expanded tartan pet bed next to him on the floor. "Get in."
"Harry--"
"Come all over your cake, Draco," Harry says, turning around and stepping past him to go and sit at the kitchen table. "Show me how dirty you really are."
"All right?"
"Yes," Draco says.
"I'll save it up, then," Harry says. "Use it on special occasions."
He's outside, on his hands and knees, naked and harnessed, with Harry holding his leash. He could be seen. He'll trust that the existing charms on the cottage will hold, but they're not as good as any he could cast. They won't be as secure or as safe as anything he'd make. He can't be sure that no one could stumble across them, Draco with his softening stomach and his tiny cock and his
"What are you going to do when you get home?" the man asks, even as Draco's wanking him off.
Draco wants to tell him that he's not crying because it's been bad, but he's barely able to register that he is crying, let alone get his words out. It's just a few sobs. He feels like his body is in one place and his brain is in another, his voice somewhere else entirely. He just tries to lose himself in Harry's arms, tries to press forward even as Harry's helping him to unlace his fingers and set himself free from the lamp, the leash unwinding and catching him on the shoulder as it falls.
"Probably," Harry says. "I wouldn't worry too much, no one ever laughs when I tell them stories about growing up with the Dursleys."
The t-shirt is weird. It doesn't have sleeves and it shows off his armpits. Draco has never, ever shown off his armpits. Not since he was a child and he tried to swim. He isn't naturally buoyant, it turns out, and he's covered up ever since. He's already pink even as he pulls it over his head. The neckline hangs too low and he feels skinny and on show.
They fly for another hour, chasing the snitch until Draco catches it in his fist, victorious.
Draco makes a sharp sound at the back of his throat.
Harry takes the spell off with a soft whisper, and Draco, lost in himself, can't help but fall forwards, his face pressed to Harry's shoulder as Harry catches him.
He hums, and takes a sip of his tea. There's no saucer. He's not used to taking tea anymore when there aren't saucers and a plate to put the biscuits on.
Draco is surprisingly, horribly hard.
Marks and Spencer is a confusing place, full of oddly shaped clothes and things that show off far too much skin for a respectable witch or wizard.
He takes a dark one. "Harry--"
Draco feels an unaccountable need to cry. He swallows it down. "I promise."
They're married with children. It doesn't quite seem possible.
Draco's heart pounds.
"My father believed in luxury, but never to excess. My mother believed in moderation."
"No touching," Harry says sharply. He's leaning on the sideboard, flushed, catching his breath. He picks up his parcel and gets something out of his pocket, and then stands up straighter, tucking his cock away one-handed. "Crawl, Piglet. Piglets eat from the kitchen floor."
"Draco—"
"Go home," Harry says. "Think about what you want that you've never been able to ask for."
"Harry--"
He picks the red pair with the llamas on, and a huge fluffy dressing gown that has
"Your piglet," Draco says. "You can do what you want with me."
"A bit. Just, you know. Are you ever going to want to fuck me?"
Harry clearly takes pity on him. "It's just some stuff," he says, which is about as clear as mud.
Draco closes his eyes and takes it all.
Draco reaches for the coins. The one they’ve been using to send messages to each other is warm from where it’s been sitting in Harry’s pocket. The second one, the keyring, is hot. Draco glances at him.
, he whispers, and the letters settle gentle into the metal.
"Hello," the man says. "Let me get you a drink." There's no awkwardness on his part, and Draco's glad of it.
"I know," Draco says.
He stands on the little rug by the side of the bed, and waits.
"Quite easy to spot if someone’s blue, I always think," Draco says. And if they’re not easily deterred and they return once more to the fold, then the charms get progressively worse. I believe Miss Weasley should have informed Ronald of this by now."
"I don't think they mean me."
"Which first?" He has the collar in one hand and the nappy in the other.
"Let's get you back on the lead, shall we?" Harry says, crouching down to unroll the leash and clip it to the harness where it fastens over Draco's back. "There we are," he says, patting him on the back. He strokes down over Draco's bottom, and slides a finger in between his buttocks.
"And all of it," Harry says, "will say
"I know," Draco says. "It's just that not wanting to want it doesn't stop you from actually wanting it. It doesn't stop you from needing it. I should know."
"What’s the point of pot pourri, anyway? But my aunt loved those air fresheners, she had them everywhere. Everything smelled like a really bad gift shop." There’s a pause. "Did you know you’ve got a gift shop here? I found it round the back. Your dad really did buy a going concern, didn’t he? There’s still tea towels for sale. Bit old fashioned but, you know, usable."
"I won't take it personally," Harry says. He's still in his scarf. He holds up a bag. "I brought us things for dinner. I'll go and sort them out in the kitchen. Do you want tea?"
Draco sits back in his chair. He rolls his shoulders; they're stiff from sitting hunched up for so long. The shadows have stretched across the floor since he last looked up, and he's been so caught up in working by lamplight, he hadn't noticed the gradual arrival of the evening. "I didn't notice."
“What are you doing next weekend?” Draco asks on Sunday, when Harry’s come back to bed with toast and tea.
as maybe he pretends to be. And I know that he really likes you, and it seems like you like him back, so--" she stops. "With Harry sometimes you have to look beyond what he's telling you, and sometimes he says things like
"Because I looked like someone else."
Draco knows he's flushing. He can't bring himself to stop. The transfigured knickers are a tiny pile of pale pink frills and lace, complete with little wet patches from where he'd drooled. When he picks them up, they really are tiny, a little patch of pink at the front, held together with little frills around the side, and something barely thicker than a string at the back. It takes him more time that it should to even decide where his legs would go; he's never even seen anything this revealing, let alone considered wearing it.
"Yes," Harry says. "Heavenly."
"It hasn't really been like that," he says, which he hopes is oblique enough to not highlight his complete inexperience in the relationship department.
"It's all warded," Draco says. "No one will ever find it unless you bring them like I'm bringing you."
"I think you can," Draco says. "I’ve already promised you I’ll do it."
It's followed by an artisan florentine made with honey, buttered caramel, and roasted almonds with a praline centre, and then a chocolate coated amaretto ganache surrounding a kirsch-soaked cherry. Harry tells him everything about each chocolate he feeds Draco, the salted caramels, the espresso martini truffles,  and the orange chocolate wafers. Harry's fingers are licked messy with chocolate, and so are Draco's lips. He's never had this, never had anyone ever indulge him like this. He doesn't know what to say or how to feel or what to do.
"Yes," Draco says, and Harry slides his hand into Draco's hair, stroking him like a pet.
Harry makes a face.
It's a while before he speaks again. "What's your fantasy?"
"Thank fuck," Draco says, but he obediently takes the canvas shoes Harry hands him, and puts them on. They're the wrong size, too big, but that's easily rectified with a bit of charms-work.
Hermione is still there when Harry arrives a little later, the wards opening for him without protest. Draco feels them shift as Harry slips through. It's perhaps for the best that Harry arrives now, when he and Hermione have not yet come to blows over who knows Harry best. For that's how he feels: that he knows Harry to a degree that Hermione doesn't, and can't ever, but in ways that he can never share without hurting Harry. That's not to say that there aren't ways in which Hermione knows Harry that Draco doesn't, or that Harry doesn't still have his secrets, but he knows he's right. Harry is safe with him. Harry's secrets are safe with him.
"Yes," Harry says, after a moment, and he reaches back into the tin. "But we haven't finished this time yet."
There's so long a pause that Draco's half-convinced Harry's fallen asleep.
Draco might not be sure what Harry’s saying thank you for, but maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe it doesn’t matter at all.
"And what about the toilet, darling? Pets usually go outside."
“The sea,” Draco says. “Sand, driftwood, dunes, the wood, the castle. What do you want me to say?” He’s startled, somewhat, by Harry resting his cheek against his shoulder.
"Yes. I recognise some commands but I don't think I understand the words. Just the sounds. But I know when you want me to sit back and come on me. It happens a lot."
For a start, Draco’s never particularly lived here, his stays limited to desultory check-ups with his father when he was compiling a property portfolio as a protective measure, and then - after his father’s death - in improving the wards to keep himself busy. He’s never slept in in his four poster bed in his Minerva McGonagall themed bedroom, or worn his pyjamas in the large sitting room with windows overlooking the overgrown gardens and the empty falconry. He’s never drunk tea on the sofa next to Harry Potter, who has his feet up on the seat like he’s not been taught manners, and he’s never shared kisses over afternoon tea as they found an old record player and a cupboard full of Muggle records from the 60s and 70s. He’s never licked cream and strawberries from Harry’s palm, kneeling down in his furry pet bed. He’s never masturbated at Harry’s feet with Harry’s hand in his hair, Harry feeding him tiny pieces of Scottish tablet until he’s whining and coming in his hand.
"Hello," Draco says, doing his best to ignore the fact he knows he's gone pink. It's Wednesday, and he hasn't seen Harry since Sunday night when they'd left Harry's Welsh cottage to return in time for work on Monday. He's missed him rather more than he'd liked. "You've been gone a while. Tea doesn't take that long to brew."
"Yes," he manages, even as he's tilting his chin up for another chocolate.
There's a pause, then, "Good piglet." It makes him feel warm inside and he hasn't got the energy to interrogate why. But when a chocolate brushes against his lips, he opens his mouth, and lets Harry feed him.
"Okay," Harry says. "It wasn't on my list, but let me know if you change your mind and we'll get you one, though."
"I think you take me away for a long weekend to Scotland," Harry says. "And we have a nice time, and we talk. And then we decide what we are."
Heathen - sweeps Harry off in the direction of the most unsuitable racks of clothes, the ones that Harry would look ridiculous in and hate to wear. Heathen clearly has some lessons to learn, but at least this leaves Draco free to wander the rest of the shop and pick out his own selection for Harry to try. Some of the shirts he finds will be too big, but that's the point of tailoring, they can all be adjusted after purchase, and if they needed further adjustment, then Draco can step in and help out. The Malfoys don't do menial work, but they do pride themselves on their sartorial elegance.
"Made you a space," Draco says, closing the door behind them. He makes sure not to stand between Harry and the door. "But it's just an idea. We can change any of it. Or all of it."
"You can eat as much cake as you want, Draco. You can be as soft and as full as you'd like to be. You don't have to eat anything just because I'm suggesting it."
"Wank yourself off," Harry says. "And don’t clean up afterwards." He reaches for a wand, and two seconds later there’s a mirror in the middle of the hallway, a free standing one that’s angled down towards Draco.
"I like looking after you," Draco says, straightening up the tray with its range of small dishes.
"Fair," Draco says, and pours them both tea. "This point proving…" he trails off.
"Harry."
"I think they'd like it if I had more friends. I think they'd like it if I let more people in."
were now, but he knows he doesn't get what he wants, when he wants it. Anyway, he might want this more; being ignored, being made to stay still, naked and hard where anyone might see how small and desperate he is.
She tears her gaze away from his hand and stares at him instead. "You've talked about-- about how well adjusted he is?"
"You really do need me to charm you some more storage space."
It feels like a very long time later when Draco feels together enough to rub his nose over Harry's collarbone through his shirt, and say, "Did no one ever teach you the proper way to prepare a scone, Potter?"
"It's all right, darling," Harry tells him, and he's stroking Draco's hair. "You were so good. You did so well. It's all right."
," Hermione says, "that it's time to look to the future. And that means if Harry wants to bring his
"It is," Harry agrees. "Just a useless little cocklet." His smile is just dismissive enough for Draco's cocklet to jump a little in appreciation. "And you know what you are, don't you, Draco? Tell me."
to the china in the kitchen, and replacing it with oven-to-tableware that would have had Draco's father turning in his grave if they hadn't cremated him, and probably, somewhere on the continent, had his mother holding her hand to her throat in consternation but without knowing why.
"We both were," Harry says. His hands are in his pockets. "You were one of the first people I ever met, you know."
"Neither’s half the stuff we do, if we think about it objectively. It doesn’t ruin it."
"Let me get you ready, then," Harry says, scooping out some of the soft ointment from the jar. "Hold this for me."
For a moment, Draco finds it difficult to swallow. He finds it difficult to do anything other than stare down at Harry in gently shifting joy as the world changes around them, creating a space for them where there wasn't one before.
'ing the little jar he'd left on the chest of drawers. Harry's careless wandless magic makes Draco tremble: to be owned by one so powerful, to submit to someone so magically strong. To be on his knees and loved by someone like Harry. "Aren't you desperate, Draco?"
"Yes," Harry says, after a beat. "Will you let me buy you another pair?"
"Such a little cock, Piglet. It's not even a proper cock, is it? What is it?"
He writes his message to Harry twice before giving up and determining to send it anyway. He tells himself he likes humiliation, so that might as well include love notes sent late at night.
"Down on your knees," Harry says, but Draco's already half way there, heart pounding. "Get that stupid cock out."
reminder, and Draco squares his shoulders, does up his coat, and leaves.
Draco rolls his eyes. "And you were all, you know… dominant."
. "It's likely I would," he says, which hedges his bets one way or another.
"Sometimes it makes me sad, that's all," Draco says. "I promise I'll laugh with you when you need me to."
“Draco.”
"I think I'll get you some little lacy bralets too," Harry goes on. "Cover those little nipples of yours."
"Whatever you want," Harry says. "But stay anyway, hey? At least until you've finished your drink. I think we can help each other out."
"Yes," Harry says, and they’re quiet for a while, Harry’s fingertips stroking Draco’s jaw. "Come on. Let’s go find a bath that’s big enough for two."
"Harry--"
"That's right," Harry says. "Let's make it easier, shall we?"
"This is a very strange shop."
"When I get hard, you just touch me until I come," Harry says.
Harry doesn't even wait for him to finish before pulling off and clambering to his feet. Draco's little cock is still pulsing, forgotten, even as Harry covers Draco's mouth with his own. He hasn't swallowed; Draco's come is still in Harry's mouth and Draco tastes it eagerly, always, always wanting to be dirtier, to be filthier, for the humiliation to be
"My parents used to entertain here," Draco says. "It's big enough."
Draco looks up at him, mouth held open by Harry's thumb, and blinks. The magic he's been holding onto dissipates with a shiver, and then he's back in his own space, familiar and possessive.
"Ron stays at home with them?"
“No,” Draco says, and - not for the first time - he thinks that Dumbledore got what was coming to him in the end. He hopes that hand of his hurt.
again. Draco likes the idea of Harry sitting in Draco's bed, reading a book.
Heat envelops him from the inside out. “I am. A come-hungry little piglet.” There’s a pause. “But you could be my good little boy if you wanted to. If you wanted it. I could look after you. Next weekend.”
, he's slowly fucking Draco and Draco's body is reacting as if it's everything he's ever dreamed of.
Draco's made stupider decisions in his life.
He doesn't.
"Good," Harry says. "Because I've put the kettle on to boil. I was going to make us breakfast, if that's okay with you?"
"Love sweets," Draco says, panting. In the mirror he’s a flushed, panting mess. Come’s in his hair and on his cheeks and lips, smeared across his skin. There’s stains on his shirt collar. "Greedy piglet."
Draco can smell himself now that he's out of the club, and it's bad. He's revolting. He's dirty and what he's done is so fucking shameful, and --
Being in Scotland with Harry is a strange experience.
Harry’s cheeks are flushed. “You said it was warded.”
"I don't care," he says. "I'm not interested. Go and get your cock out and I'll come and find you when I'm done."
"Catch the snitch," Harry says. "Are you going to tell me what you think about me and you?"
"You do now."
"Fuck you when you're covered in cake," Harry agrees. "But first you're going to accompany me to dinner with Hermione and Ron, and you're not going to show me up, are you?"
Draco's skin burns red. "Yes," he says, his voice small. He had often made himself come thinking about the thrill of discovery, the shame of being seen, the horror of humiliating himself and coming in front of his friends, his true self being visible to everyone. Sometimes he'd made himself make noises, made himself cry out to test out the silencing spell, to feel his skin heat up in humiliation as he rubbed himself to orgasm on his Slytherin sheets.
Harry looks gloriously and undeniably happy. It burns a satisfaction into Draco's skin that he hopes will never come out.
He can't stop to think about what she's assuming the length and breadth of
The thing is, it's been nothing more than a fantasy until his father dies, and his mother takes herself off to the continent, and despite all attempts at persuasion, Draco refuses to follow her.
"I will when it's time," Harry says. The door to the gents bangs open, and then there's the sound of someone unzipping their trousers and taking aim at the urinals. Harry raises an eyebrow. That amused look is back. "Put your cock away, come on. No one wants to see something that small."
"Harry—"
"All right, Harry?" he says, opening the door wider and stepping back so that they can go in. "Draco." He looks at a point just to the right of Draco's actual head, which Draco considers reasonable given their history.
"Another?" Harry asks, and Draco opens his eyes, blinking against the light.
Draco's going to have to lead on this. Harry would happily bury it very far underground if only given the opportunity. But he's done that long enough. Harry deserves to be safe, to feel safe. If it's the one thing Draco can give him, this boy who lived but was never safe, then Draco will figure out how to if it kills him.
"No," Draco says. "Because the thing is, I think you'd go out of your way to keep on giving me everything I need, and call it a kindness, and it is one, because the way you treat me is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for me in my life. You never stop looking after me. Every single thing we do together, all those things that I want and never thought I'd ever get, you engineer a way to give them to me, and you let me enjoy them so much they make me come, and you know what the most important thing is? I never for a second feel like I'm not safe. You make me feel safe to be me. Sometimes I think I've never been happy in my life.
"Ignored," Draco says. "Used. Forgotten. A thing."
The doorbell goes on the dot of half past three, which is a little surprising because Harry both has permission to apparate directly into his hall, and because Harry isn't known for his precise punctuality.
"I’d missed flying," Harry says. His thumb brushes Draco’s jaw. "I didn’t want to do it all the time, like Gin, but it fees like nothing else."
"What about you?" Draco asks sulkily. He's eaten a nice roast dinner and a nice lemon tart with cream for dessert, and finished it off with more wine and a cup of coffee and a strictly limited two mint chocolates. He's briefly met two sleepy, shy children with sticky-up hair who call Harry
Draco nods again. He's felt quiet for a while now anyway, like he'd woken up knowing that this was building.
"You're thinking too much," Harry says without looking back at him. "I can hear you."
"Lover," Draco says.
Draco's finger twitches against the table. "Don't talk about my mother."
Draco’s heart pounds. "I’ve never— you know I’ve never. There’s just been you. You and those guys from the back room. I’d never even kissed anyone before you."
The thing is, Draco knows that's a lie. He's just not sure how much Harry knows it's a lie.
Draco waits two, maybe three seconds. There's a muscle pulsing in his cheek; he can feel it.
"I didn't know you could cook like this." Draco comes to sit down, pulling the chair out.
Harry carefully places the small bag in the middle of his pillow. "First, I'm going to kiss you."
"I think it's time for a present, don't you?" he says, because in his little basket he has two small, furry, stuffed dragons. "Would you like your present, little one?"
Harry sounds amused. "Of course you did," he says. "Do it again tonight, and you can tell me about it tomorrow." He gets another card out of his pocket, the same black card stock as last night. "Come to this address at 4 o'clock."
"I bet you're going to come on the floor, aren't you? Such a filthy little piglet, horny as fuck. I'm going to make you lick it up," Harry goes on, fingers moving slowly on Draco's cock. "You're too small for me to even get my fist around."
Harry's smile is maybe a little rueful. "I know, darling."
Harry grins against his mouth. "We're not doing that right now," he says, "and as if I care, anyway? Whatever. Shut up."
button and zip, and they're elasticated.
"You have one," Draco says. He nudges the box towards Harry.
"Not yours," Draco says, chin tilting up. "I'm not covered in yours."
"My holes," Draco says. "I'm good for being a hole. Let me wank you off."
"There you go," Harry says softly, and he rubs his dick over Draco's lips. "No, you don't get it yet. Come on the floor first."
"Do you ever think about that time you ate off the floor?" Harry asks, after a minute of them both focusing on their cake.
"And we got distracted," Harry says. "You were all needy. Could tell from the moment I saw you."
Draco slides his hands into the small of Harry's back.
"Don't think of it. Until Tuesday, Miss Weasley."
Draco follows suit, sliding in next to him, and they pull the covers up and over them even as Harry's moving closer and his dick's pressing up against Draco's hip. So much skin. They're touching everywhere, pressed together from shoulder to hip to knee. Their feet entwine under the covers. Harry's breath is hot against his cheek. Draco's never been this physically close to anyone in his whole entire life.
Harry strokes his hair. Draco likes it when Harry does that, when he’s petted like this, when he gets touched and stroked and can just rest until he’s back to himself. His throat feels a bit sore and his jaw aches.
, if you want to listen along.
Draco's skin burns. "Yes, Harry. My tiny cock's so fucking useless I came all over myself."
When he lifts his face from the bowl, water runs off his chin. He stays on his knees, but he turns around. Harry's naked, and wet from the knees down. He's getting out of the bath, hooking the shower attachment back onto the wall. He's clearly given himself a quick wash down, just getting rid of the worst of the dirt from his feet. There are two muddy footprints on the bathroom mat.
"We'll be late."
"It is, isn't it? Hardly even a cock at all. A cocklet, maybe."
"It’s fucked up," Harry says. "Do you know what you’re saying yes to? I want you to treat me like I’m a little boy."
"I can fly like this," Harry says. "Do you mind if I explore?"
He folds his jumper and shirt, then his trousers, and finishes with his socks and underpants before standing back up, little cock already erect.
"We'll take two of each," Harry says, stacking them and then giving them to Draco to hold without even looking at him. Then he pauses in front of the collars and the leads, fingering the red leather with the golden buckle. "Another time, maybe," he says regretfully, and Draco lets out a breath.
"You're letting me look after this," Draco says. "So let me do my job."
"No," Harry says. His eyes are closed. "No one ever lets me look after them. I don't know if anyone ever has. Ginny hated it. She's too independent. Everyone else either wants to look after me or wants nothing from me. They don't understand that I want to give it. You're the only one who ever let me. Ginny said I was stifling her. You don't feel stifled, do you?"
The guy fucking Harry doesn't last much longer either, but Harry doesn't come. When the guy pulls out, snapping off a condom and chucking it on the floor, Harry's still hard. He waits a minute, breathless, braced against the wall, and then he comes over to where Draco's waiting and crouches down. It looks like it aches.
"We haven't talked about the fact that you're important to me," Harry says, almost like Draco hadn't spoken. "And I'm not certain whether you want me to or not, but it doesn't change the fact that you are. You're very important to me."
"You've got visitors," Harry says. "And I'm saying it might be nice if you felt a little bit less… restricted."
Draco groans again, his cheek pressed up against the rug. He wants to rub his dick until he comes but the angle's all wrong and his dick isn't big enough. Instead it just hangs there, so fucking hard, and dripping pre-come onto the rug.
"They're pyjamas," Draco says, and he'd be lying if he said he wasn't confused. "What else do you want from them?"
"Well," Harry says. "It's a good thing you've got me around, then, isn't it? To spoil you."
Harry leads him over to the tree at the side of the garden, half way up the slope. He leans against the trunk, and tugs on the lead. "Cock a leg, Piglet."
"We have," Draco says, and lifts his hand, holding it out like a signpost, signalling their walking direction. "Clothes shopping here we come."
"Property of the House of Potter," Draco says softly, and Harry runs his thumb over Draco's lip.
"Too late," Draco says. "I promise."
"I'd have to put you in a harness," Harry goes on, his thumb stroking Draco's jaw. "That's what you do with animals, isn't it? Put them on a lead. Do you think all my friends would laugh at your cocklet? Because I do."
Draco obeys. Harry scoops up more cake for him to eat from his fingers, and at the same time, he's stroking between Draco's legs, smearing cake over his balls and his bum and touching the underside of his cock, which must be peeking out from between his legs.
"Cutlery?" Harry asks, holding out a knife and fork, "or do you want to eat like an animal?"
"I'm greedy," Draco says. "Greedy soft piglet with a stupid cocklet."
stitched beneath the waistband. Socks. Polished shoes. Then his collar, quietly purloined from Harry's bedside table, buckled closed with sure fingers.
Harry's smirk hasn't gone anywhere. "It's perfectly neutral," he says. "If you wanted to blend in, you'd be fine. But you don't, do you? You want to get your cock out and have people notice. You know, before they realise you're only good for coming on."
Draco only has a bit of sausage and mushroom left, and the remains of his piece of toast. He gulps it down, finishing his cup of tea quickly, and stands up so that he can come and kneel by Harry's feet. The cottage is so small that he has to practically climb over one of the armchairs to find the space.
He does. He
Harry doesn’t say anything to that, and Draco keeps on stroking his hair.
"That cocklet of yours is so little it'll fit in the tiniest of knickers, won't it?" He glances at Draco. "Not that you can answer." He rolls his eyes as he spots the drool on the rug. "Filthy piglet," he says, and reaches across to Draco's pile of clothes, to where he's folded his underwear. Harry transfigures it into something tiny and baby pink and frilly, slipping it down onto the rug by Draco's mouth. "If you must make a mess of something, it had better be your dirty knickers, Piglet."
Harry just looks at him. He's a little flushed. His hair's messy and underneath his nice coat his clothes are scruffy and ill-fitting. He does all the filthy things that Draco needs him to do, does all of that and more, and then afterwards, he treats Draco kindly. He does nice things for Draco, and he's the only person outside of his mother that's done that in years.
"Waking up," Draco says, and turns back towards the sea. "Seeing the world anew."
"Water," Harry says. There's a jug on the side, and Draco opens the cupboards until he finds the glasses and the plates. He pours Harry a glass and takes it over to the table. Harry doesn't say thank you, barely acknowledging his existence. There's a magazine on the table, another Muggle one. Harry never seems to have a copy of the
Something bright lights Harry's eyes, and he strokes his thumb over Draco's jaw. "Later," he says. "Later."
Draco turns around, and sniggers like he's fourteen again and Harry's just done something stupid in their potions lesson. Harry looks ridiculous, in a heavily patterned shirt with wing collars and huge fern greenery pictures all over.
"Your filthy little piglet," Draco says, a little dazedly. "I like it when you call me piglet."
"I've only ever been it for Ginny."
"This is practically a cupboard," Draco says, but it's got no bite to it. The cottage is ramshackle, nestled in the dip, next to a little stream that runs into the sea. There are apparently seals, sometimes, and puffins; some of the old books on the shelves are guides to the creatures of Wales and Pembrokeshire, others guides to the flora and fauna. There's another one devoted to ghosts and legends. Draco had considered reading it for approximately half a second before discarding it; he sleeps poorly enough as it is.
Draco looks at him, remembers their entwined fingers. "Would you like us to?"
Draco rubs his nose over Harry's neck. He's done for now. "Another time."
"No," Harry says, but he keeps his hand tucked inside Draco's. "Show me anyway."
. It feels like a gift.
"In my defence," Draco says, "I always show the capabilities of my charms to my clients, and Miss Weasley was aware of this when we agreed to user testing."
"It's what you were born to do," Harry says, bringing the cake closer. His cock's still tightly squeezed between Draco's thighs, and he rocks his hips up, "Growing up just to be my dirty cake-fucking piglet."
Draco nods.
"Anyone could see you," Harry tells him, as Draco focuses his attention on the tip. "We’re on a Quidditch pitch. Imagine if there was a team practice. Fuck, imagine if we were at school. Everyone seeing you like this. You should be so ashamed."
"Do what you want," Harry says, and he almost sounds like he doesn't care, like figuring out what Draco wants is too much effort. Like Draco should be seen and not heard. Like he shouldn't even be seen.
"Course you will," Harry says. "Because I’m telling you to."
Draco goes pink before he even says anything. "I wake up stiff," he says. "Every day I wake up and my little cock is hard. So I rub it against the sheets until I come."
He breathes around Harry’s cock, and lets himself be.
"Harry Potter, compromising."
"Chicken," Harry says.
"Absolute lie," Harry says, with quite a great deal of conviction.
"Oh, but you like that, don’t you?" Harry goes on, carefully putting his broom down and taking Draco’s from him, putting it down next to his. "My little exhibitionist piglet, always wanting to get your cock out to show the world."
"I'm going to look after you so well," Draco says. "I promise."
Draco is the last of his line, and he'll end it on his knees if it kills him.
"I'm sorry," Harry says, but he's got nothing to be sorry for, nothing at all, only Draco can't quite get his words out. He's stroking his hand down Draco's arm, down to his wrist and to his laced fingers. "I'm so sorry, darling, it's all right, don't cry."
He breathes, and slows, letting time pass, and eventually he settles.
"A cake," Draco says.
"You turned Ron blue."
Harry sinks back into the pillows. "Nothing," he says. "Carry on."
"I know you do. I know you love it."
"My turn to feed you," Harry says, and he picks up the fork and prepares a mouthful.
"Is this magical?"
Harry tilts his head. "Maybe," he says. "Are you ready? Or do you want to wait?"
Draco's
Draco flushes. "Still am. Properly. They never did manage to sell my virginity off."
"Quite the list," Harry says, his fingertips grazing Draco's hair. "Quite the depravity I'd expect from my dirty piglet. Tell me how you do it."
"Do you need permission? Because I can give you permission."
"No."
Draco's chest feels sort of odd.
"Aye, aye," Harry says, but he arranges himself in Draco's arms comfortably before he closes his eyes again.
"No," Draco manages, but his skin is burning red.
"If the cap fits." There's a pause. "How hard are you right now?"
"We should," Harry says. "I'll warm up dinner."
"My parents always protected me. They loved me so much, Harry. I didn't grow up thinking I wasn't loved. I grew up protected by my name but it was a debt. Every day my name protected me I ended up owing it something, and it was something that I wasn't ever going to be able to pay back. I don't have it in me to be the Malfoy my father wanted me to be. I was so ashamed of who I was, and I'm still so ashamed of my name and what it means. But I'm not ashamed of what I want, and I'm not ashamed when I'm with you."
"I thought you might be able to give our wards at home a bit of a going over," she says breezily, and Draco can't help but think that that isn't why she's come over, but he'll let her come to it in her own time. "It's important for us that Hugo and Rose get to be involved with both parts of their heritage; my mum and dad would hate to be excluded from their lives just because we chose to live in a magical place where they couldn't come and go. Equally, we're a magic family; Ron's family need to be able to visit and we want to be able to let the children play in the garden with toys from both sides of the family. We've done the best we can but it would put our minds at rest if they could be reviewed by an expert."
"Not very sexy."
"I wish I could have fucked you for real like that," Harry says. "I could have just slid inside of you and fucked you. I'd do it in front of the mirror so you could have seen every last moment of it. How dirty you were. How depraved it was." Draco burns with shame at the memory, but Harry just leans in and kisses the corner of his mouth. "How much I loved seeing you like that. It doesn't have to be our first time like that, but can we do that? Sometime?"
"It's all right, Draco. Whatever you need."
"You'll have to return tomorrow."
And then, scraping the bottom of the barrel of self-preservation, he signed it,
He's spent his whole life being told of the value of his virginity, and now it comes to it, the idea of losing it is a little terrifying. It brings into sharp perspective Harry's comments about meeting Draco's mother; about the vaguely awkward dinner with Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, about the part of his brain that keeps whispering
"For us?" Draco stills.
"Will Ron Weasley be there?"
"Good for nothing, I expect," Harry says. "Certainly couldn't fuck anyone with a cock that small. Useless little thing."
Draco will, quite honestly, let Harry do whatever he chooses. That’s part of the charm. But shame is already curling in his gut at the memory of his fantasy shared with Harry, the idea he masturbates to of being Harry’s dumb animal.
"You're a monster," Draco says, because he feels affection trying to crawl out of his chest and he has nowhere to put it other than at Harry's door.
Upstairs, Draco’s bedroom is warm and neat with a fire lit. Everything is clean and tidy, from the neatly pulled back curtains around the four poster to his toiletries on the dresser. A lot of the furniture dates back to the lairds, but in-between are a lot of the surplus from the manor. It’s a strange hodge-lodge of styles, magical and non-magical in origin, but Draco’s focus, the rare times he’s stayed here, has been the Quidditch pitch.
Draco gets up off the floor, wraps himself in his dark green robe, and gets the charmed coin out of the little bowl on his bedside table. It's not very big and they don't have much space for words - something Draco really needs to work on, given his charms skills - so he settles for
"You can use him if you want," Harry says. "He's a good enough hole if you want sucking off."
"No idea," Harry says. Draco isn't entirely sure it's true.
Something like electricity crackles over Draco's skin. He's learnt about electricity now, how it powers muggle houses. He's learnt a lot.
"You're fucked up," he tells his reflection, but he's naked in the hallway of his family home, and all he wants to do right now is go further and further down, until he's so ashamed he can't feel anything else at all.
"I don’t know," Harry says. He does know, Draco can tell.
"I know," Draco says, and this time, he kisses Harry back. It's time for a conversation change. "I thought you were feeding me chocolates?"
. He'll think about Harry later.
Draco makes a soft sound in the back of his throat.
And now he does. Now he wants the two of them to be an
Draco has had a lot of practice at hiding his true feelings, and if leaving the soft pyjamas and the fluffy dressing gowns behind is a wrench, then he's pretty clear he's not showing it on his face.
"Well," he says, looking Draco up and down. "Glad to see you can follow instructions."
"Okay, up you get," Harry says, but Draco doesn't move. He looks up instead, to meet Harry's interested gaze. And then, without any time to think about it in any more detail, he wraps his arms around Harry's waist and presses his cheek to Harry's stomach. And he holds on.
"Shut up," Draco says, which was not the most biting or cutting remark he's ever made, but he just almost died, so he won't blame himself too harshly. "Where's this shop we're going to?"
"So fucking desperate for it, aren't you, Piggy?"
Harry materialises, naked, and drying his hair with a towel. "I thought you might want to stay for a bit," he says. "There's supper."
, he urges, although he's careful not to let it show on his face.
Harry looks at him. His hair's a mess and whilst he's tried with his new coat, he's still comfortably dressed in jeans and a jumper, neither of which fit him particularly well. He's Harry Potter, saviour of the wizarding world. Brave, brilliant Harry Potter. "Trying, I thought," he says finally.
"Indeed," Draco says. He glances down at his lap. "And, uh… I thought you could maybe tell me what it is you're going to need from me one day."
"Get up."
Draco imagines the sheer humiliation of peeing outside. Of being on a lead. It makes his skin burn with the want of it all. He nods.
He's going to fuck Draco so that Draco will no longer be a virgin, so that all of those years of his virginity being a commodity will be over, so he never has to wonder if he will ever be of value to anyone, because right now, he is. He's loved. He's loved for who he is, for all of these parts inside of him that no one else could have wanted, but Harry has just gathered up and given back to him in ways Draco's never even dreamed of.
He had subtly forced Malfoy to write a fucking note. It shouldn’t be difficult to force him out of the bedroom. Or force a blond Stuart Little out. And it was working rather well.
He studied the blond, the sincerity of his words, the way he tilted his head to the side after the confession. The sly glint which Draco’s eyes often had, wasn’t present. He drew in a breath, closing his eyes.
“Oh, shut up.”
“No, I don’t.” Harry said, closing his eyes and grunting softly. “But I never had a chance to recover from the scars of the war, Draco.”
“I can function without resting, Malfoy. Besides –
“M-My father?” Malfoy said, barely a whisper. “He sent you to this – Ohmygod.”
“Maybe I just want you to offer me yours.” Harry said with a smirk. “Besides, you’re always warm.”
, will you enlighten me on what you were thinking about?”
“Sure, we were.” He said in a slow, sarcastic drawl. “Now, why don’t you continue to figure out how to return to the shire and defeat the wicked witch of the west, Frodo?”
He inched back, and gazed at the painting – It was a sky.
,” It wasn’t laced with malice. Wasn’t certain if he wanted it to. It was an offhanded retort. “I wasn’t fond of the prejudiced views or you.”
“Will you quit the nonsense and eat the fucking crepe, Potter? Besides, I
well, y'all aren't ready for the next chapter.
“Very witty,” Harry said in a slow, sarcastic drawl. A section of Harry Potter in the prophet written by Draco Malfoy was a cause of concern. A nightmare, in fact. “If you write, I’ll start a section about you.”
“Are you going to tell me the way you’re planning to kill me?”
"Hey angel, I've missed you. Work was a magnificent pain in the arse today. You have no idea how glad I am to finally see you again." Uttered while Harry had his arms wrapped around Draco's waist from behind, face hidden in the crook of his neck.
tolerable now, minus the sardonic comments and the french curses. “Draco, it was the –”
“Brief me over a cup of tea.” He said, uncertainly leaning against the bed post. The sliver of windows begun to shine, flooding the room with the light. Dust modes floating, suspended, in the air. “Oh, and no sugar.”
Beads of sweat broke out on the forehead and he raised the trembling fingers to wipe it off. A soft groan escaped him when an intense pain flared in his body while the knees buckled. He was falling.
Malfoy did not wipe the scowl off his face. He did get the strawberries and chop it into pieces. He did not get the whipped cream either, because he was Draco Malfoy.
"I'm flattered."
“You figured it out, didn’t you?”
,” Draco said in a monotone with a soft snort, yet a brief flicker of concern crossed his face. “how is it, by the way?”
“I would, if I could write,” He whispered while he fidgeted with the cup, tracing a finger over the crest of a badger. “which I can’t, with the oh-so deficient vocabulary.”
He didn’t retort with a quip.
And he went back to watching the movie.
Draco was cut off when Harry leaned in to press their lips together. They melted into the kiss, each getting lost in the feeling of the other’s lips. His lips were chapped and cold, but it invaded his senses nonetheless. “Merry Christmas.”
wasn't a straight Romeo and Juliet esque romance. It was a gay romance novel and it had intrigued him. A soft sigh escaped him, as he turned over the page. Reading the words on a page overthrew the hushed whispers in his own head.
“Well, at least you can whisk.”
The brunet’s lip twitched and curled into a small smile. Oh. He placed the cup on the table, continuing to read the novel and said, “Couldn’t resist a reference, could you Malfoy?”
“Oh?” He said with a sinister laugh, pausing for a moment and inching even closer until they were nose-to-nose, scrutinizing the silver eyes. “You didn’t fucking try enough.”
Potter smiled, clearly pleased by the last bit. Or he wanted to rile him up. “You’re sort of fascinated with the idea of Neverland. Or fairy-tales.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“If we come out,” A frown creases his forehead while he turns. “they will say that you –” Draco’s voice cracks, the composure shifting slightly. “You and I – we shouldn’t be together.”
“Oh but aren’t you fluent in nonsense?”
He brushed a stand of blond hair out of Draco’s face, and his fingers trailed to his chin. He closed the distance between them, with a soft and slow kiss.
“It’s not your fucking concern, for one.”
He couldn't confess that he wanted to. Or that it wasn't for tonight. Yet, he couldn't find the words. Perhaps, it was purely platonic and he didn't want to screw it up. Not now.
“Y – You wanted to kill her?”
“Oh, if your vocabulary is functioning well, why can’t you string the words into a proper sentence and continue with our conversation instead of –” A pause. “are we friends, Harry?”
“Oh shut up,” He said with a snort, yet a small pleased smile was on the corner of Malfoy’s mouth. “I’ll consider it a job well-done, considering Draco Malfoy – the envious prat – taught our dear chosen one.”
“You can’t – Oh, you’re a
Draco cut him off with a raised hand, halting him in his speech, “Out, Potter.” He managed to get away with only a slight tremble to the voice, an arm curled around his abdomen, trying to savour every hint of warmth he could produce. “I want a moment of peace.”
“You – fuck you, Potter – You never call me Malfoy.”
Harry smiled. “Care to elaborate?”
Draco pressed his face into the brunet’s shoulder, while he rubbed comforting circles against his back.
“Perhaps that was not the perfect choice of words.” He winced, mouth simpering, the eyes wavering with uncertainty while his fingers flexed around the base of the cup. “Draco, I’m –” Potter inched closer. “I’m sorry.”
He chuckled with a slight shake to his head, leading Draco to the centre of the room, to a place he had chosen on purpose. A place underneath a particular constellation.
Malfoy circled around the couch, and ran back to the kitchen and around the island with a wide grin on his face. Harry caught his wrist, and drew him close until they were nose-to-nose.
“I’m astounded,” Draco said with a soft snort while he cast a contemplative glance at the brunet. “How did you solve such complex riddles over the course of six years with your low level of intelligence, Potter?”
“It’s not your –” Harry’s voice trailed. He couldn’t reply with a ‘
“The menace has a perfect face,” He said with a slight grin, which caused a flutter in the brunet’s chest which was an indication of trouble. “I offer a polite
He could hear soft footsteps approaching him, but he didn’t care. He was tired, and he wanted to fall asleep before he died. Or before he was set on fire by Draco fucking Malfoy.
Malfoy was offended. “I wasn’t – oh.”
“Merry Christmas, love.”
He cursed under his breath and cleared his throat as he tilted his head to the sky as he said, “Er – I wasn’t – I was thinking about - Never mind.”
The amusement was dancing in Potter’s eyes gave way to an all-too familiar smirk on his face as he said, "Never said you were, Malfoy.”
“No, Mr. Borgin and I were chatting about the weather over a cup of tea when he recounted the oh-so subtle compliment.” He said with a slow, sarcastic drawl. “Of course, I was in Borgin and Burkes, Malfoy.”
Harry was snoring, curled onto one side. Draco smiled at him softly, removing the glasses, and brushing the strands of hair out of his face as he kissed his forehead. “Good night, Harry.”
Malfoy absent-mindedly inched slightly closer to him as he whispered, “Because you were always so fucking perfect and I wasn’t.”
He wanted a distraction. The thoughts about Malfoy reeling in his head were irritating. He brushed his fingers against the snitch in his pocket and his mind traced to the Quidditch matches. In the sixth year, it had been a lot less satisfying without Malfoy to show-off to.
With the corner of his eye, he saw a blur of blond hair as Malfoy closed the door. He directed his magic at the cup, and it mended itself.
“Out of pity?” Harry scoffed, clenching his own fist to the side. “I don’t pity you, Malfoy. You have the right to know about the words your father said before sending me here.”
Harry scoffed.
“No. I’m quite startled over the fact that you could utter a subtle
He wasn’t, if he could ever think Draco Malfoy was kind of beautiful.
It wasn’t fun when Potter was agreeing with him. He might’ve reacted on a creative choice of words, which were yet to surface in his mind. “Can I practice a complex charm instead of a simpler one?”
"No," He says, staring at the intertwined fingers, mouth curving into a fond smile. "I want to stay on the Astronomy Tower with you," It's a soft, fragile whisper. "It's - I can't."
“He – Why did he send you to Otryazan if he had vowed not to –”
“Draco,” Harry said, pressing their foreheads together. “I can save you, and we can figure out a way to protect her.”
“Draco,” He shifts and kneels down in front of the blond and lifts his hands up to hold Draco’s face in a firm, sure, secure way. “they don’t know about the things we do,” A beat. “they don’t know about the soft whispers of
Draco raised his head, and his startling grey eyes peered into his own. “Why, Potter? Don’t fucking pity me and fucking kill me.”
“You still fucking despise me, don’t you?” He whispered slowly, and cursed – coherent and sensible weren’t the same. The brunet had ducked his head and he had closed his eyes. “You fucking can’t –
“Were you in Borgin and Burkes when I subtly complimented you, Potter?”
Or not.
“Oh, the Chosen One would deign to touch Draco Malfoy?”
The kitchen was small. The upper cabinets were white. On the left was the stove, below the stove was an oven. The peninsula was white, with grey cabinets and a silver refrigerator adjacent to the peninsula.
He didn’t say more. He turned, walking towards a quaint glass house, half a mile away from the water.
“Isn’t it?” Harry said, his voice strained at the edges. “I’m stranded on a severed Island with you, and I can’t find a fucking way out. We’re struck with each other and I want to be clued in about you or it’ll bite me in the arse.”
It was, perhaps, the
Harry didn't quite know how it happened, but one moment he was looking up at Draco, the blonde's face mere inches away, and the next thing he knew their lips were against each other’s.
He wanted to refute with a similar, venomous tone. Yet, he didn’t. The cold, detached mask the blond had forced on a while ago had started to wear off. Draco had a slight quiver in his voice, a tinge of red on the face, shoulders tense. “Oh
"Alright then."
Or not. Not that he cared. He would be glad to have Potter out of Otryazan. It was infuriating enough to be in a severed Island. He couldn’t deal with Harry Potter. And at the same time, he wanted to. Because he had been alone in Otryazan. Alone for five months. Or more. He didn’t count. Not anymore.
“A rant?” Draco repeated flatly and underlined the words with a glare while he forced out a low, humourless laugh. “Clearly, you’ve lost your last brain cell, Potter, which, by the way –”
And it made his heart stutter.
"Well, yes, a bet with Pansy was a bad idea and – wait, how did you know I lost a bet?"
“Not father,” Malfoy said with a pained mien, which vanished within a brief minute. “A Patronus will protect you. Save you – it won’t –” He paused. “It won’t be related to father.”
“Oh, the Bludger that was focused on killing me on the pitch?” He arched an eyebrow at the blond, while his lips curved into a teasing smirk, yet it faltered as a strand of hair fell over Malfoy’s eye. “Yeah, of course you would’ve won if it had succeeded, Malfoy.”
He was cut off by Harry scooping up snow and tossing it towards him. But Draco did not whine. He reached for a handful of snow himself, and tossed it on his head. Harry brushed it off his head and gaped at him.
“It’s French, Potter.”
“Well, I asked you before: Or what?”
“If you have a fucking problem with the –
"Wasn't your proudest moment when you danced in the Yule Ball or when your date ditched you, was it?"
“Quit with the comments,” Draco said with a note of impatience, “and explain why we’re on first-name basis.”
“Yeah.” Harry said with the faintest smile and even if it involved tolerating Draco Malfoy, it was something to look forward to. “It’s a deal.”
As he returned in the evening and placed the warm cloak in place, he heard impatient pacing at a distance. With a smirk, he walked to the kitchen counter.
He flinched slightly, and inhaled sharply as he composed himself. “I suppose I’ll have to provide a piece of information as well.”
Harry practices more wandless magic
“Oh well,” He said with a soft chuckle, crossing his arms over his chest in an attempt at a typical closed-off stance. “we’ll be here for a while, considering your inability to walk and the fact that I’ve fractured a rib.”
“I could, if you quit with the threats – Or the not-so intimidating glares – We could start with the Patronus if you want to and I place five sickles on it.” He said with a faint smirk. “I’d place more if I had it.”
to the Chosen One for the subtle compliment.”
He whispered a confused
mourn you,” Malfoy said with the faintest laugh, seemingly unaffected by the glares or scowls. “A bit of patience, Potter. Patience.”
With an uncertain sigh, he placed a hand on the curve Malfoy’s back – extended his arm – turned his left ankle at the perfect angle – pushed his right shoulder back. “straighten up.”
“Quite clever of you to
That earns him a punch on the arm from Draco–a hard one at that. And he drops his hands, cackling and totally unbothered by the icy glare directed at him.
"I was observant, not obsessed with you."
Draco and Harry have a proper conversation while they make breakfast
An uncomfortable silence lingered in the air. The wind brushed against his face, and he closed his eyes to listen to the sound of the waves. The sound of water crashing and retreating to the sea, only because it could overthrow the whispers in his own head.
He carded his fingers through his hair, and closed his eyes. A wandless corporeal Patronus. It wouldn’t be easy. He didn’t have a choice, did he?
is your favourite Gryffindor.”
“I figured,” Potter whispered with a slight quiver to the voice, “yes, the cup is a dark artefact and it was screwing with my emotional compass which caused the small outburst that unfortunately, involved an insensitive choice of words.”
. He walked over to Malfoy uncertainly, and halted behind him, as his gaze landed on the picture placed on the mantle.
, it’s not a comfortable position,” Draco whispered in a soft voice, strained at the edges, watching the sky in morbid fascination. “can’t you – oh never-mind – I can’t tolerate a sarcastic retort.”
“You are.”
“I won’t.” Harry said, as he closed his eyes. “You’ve been through a lot. I’ll give you your soft epilogue, Draco.”
The operative word was
He searched the entire living room, until his gaze landed on the teacup - he had fixed it a while ago – on one corner, with the rest of the teacups in the set.

, can you focus on teaching?”
Draco cursed and extracted his arm with a sigh, ignoring the flutter in his chest. “Rest – I’ll brief you on it when you can function – Besides, I could do with a bit of peace and quiet.”
He stepped around Malfoy, and uncertainly reached out. Adjusting the shoulder – a hand on the back – so that his arm was at the right angle. “Try now.”
He cursed.
“You’re a saint, Potter.”
“It’s incredible.”
Blood was tricking from his nose, and his jaw was bruised with a few cuts and possibly dislocated. The corner of his eye was red, and the glasses were broken. “I don’t want to.”
” Draco’s voice was small. A mouse’s protest. The brunet could detect a trace of reluctance in the words. It caused a soft warmth to course within him for a brief moment, “neither do you.”
His mind traced back to Sirius. Yes, he had lost his godfather, but he had memories with him. The night he was told the truth about Pettigrew. His lips curved into a soft smile, as he closed his eyes and focused on the memory:
At night, as he walked into the room, he directed an icy glare at Harry. Sadly, he was immune to the death glares and threats alike. “Why are you staring, Malfoy?”
In a sense, he was a prisoner of some memory. A prisoner of fear. And failure. He would define himself by things he couldn’t change.
He was overwhelmed by the guilt, and his stomach clenched uncomfortably as he traced it further to Malfoy’s almost limp body, covered in blood and the cuts – No. It was too painful.
Ron had covered a laugh with a not-so-subtle cough to which Malfoy had reacted with a contemptuous retort.
He let it slide.
in a very spectacular shape right now,” A pause, “perhaps, you can continue with your plan to light me on fire when you're well-rested."
A soft gasp escaped him when the blond stumbled over. Instinctually, he pitched forward, slinging an arm around Draco’s waist in a swift reflex – perhaps it was the five years of playing Quidditch coming in handy  – and a scent of sandalwood with hints of citrus washed over him. “Malfoy, what –”
He twirled Draco around once, laced the fingers with Draco’s and placed the left hand on his waist in a firm, yet gentle grip. “It’s – yeah.”
The night-sky was quiet. Peaceful. It wasn’t as chaotic as the sky of his fancy. He couldn’t find the star he was searching. Perhaps he didn’t want to. He could vaguely recall the exact location of the star.
“Oh, fine. You can – wait, you prepared the crepes for the both of us? I figured you’d rather drown in the sea than do something for the ‘Chosen One’ or –
one. “not fractured, I hope.” Draco lifted a brow at him. “oh, for Circe’s sake, I’ll adjust to the friends with Draco Malfoy concept within a few –” A beat. “a week, I’ll adjust within a week.”
He wouldn’t. He would never let go of Draco Malfoy.
“Draco, hey,” he said with a small, confused frown, “no offence, you’re
familiar with the forced civil tone. He wasn’t, however, familiar with a sincere
“Instead of a simple ‘
“Oh, I can compliment a single soul once in a while. You, for instance –” He paused, thinking of a subtle compliment but he actually couldn’t come up with one. “Your – Oh, nevermind – I can’t compliment you.”
“You cast
Or without the soft, silver light of the moon. It wasn’t offering a distraction. The small glimpses of Draco Malfoy were swirling in Harry's mind. Glimpses of the one part of Draco. The one which was a careful secret.
“You had a choice, didn't you?”
Harry didn’t want to kill Malfoy. He wanted to save him, and give him a chance. A chance to reconsider his choices.
“Not even remotely,” Draco chuckled as he inched closer to him, and a comfortable silence engulfed them. He cleared his throat awkwardly as he held out the black coat at him. “Here, I don’t want you to freeze to death.”
Harry turned to the blond with a faint smile and he recalled the fairy-tale he had read in the night, when he was six out of the book of fairy-tales in the cupboard and started to recite it. “
Draco focused on Christmas at the Malfoy Manor, yet it failed to cause the surge of content. Instead, it caused fear to course within. “I – I can’t find one.”
He wasn’t prepared for a stab of pain in the chest. It shouldn’t affect him. Yet, it did. He maintained the usual cold demeanor. An instinct of pure, Slytherin self-preservation. “No, he can’t –”
“I faced Voldemort for six consecutive years,” He said with a satisfied upturn of lips. “if you think your glares will hold the intended effect, you’ll only frustrate yourself – Don’t fucking bother.”
Harry paused all movement, and set his fork down. He didn’t want to talk about Sirius. It was insanely painful. Yet, it was the only way to empathize with the pain Malfoy was in. He inhaled sharply and gave Malfoy a soft nod, “Sirius Black.”
Draco propped up on the bed next to the brunet and Potter's earthy scent with a touch of lilac washed over him. The tiny flutter in his chest wouldn’t fucking cease.
“Quite a surprise to find out you aren’t dead,” Draco said, as the corner of his lip twitched and curled into a smirk. “I’ve been collecting dead flowers for the grave of our dear Chosen One.”
“Nobody cares about the peanut ones.”
A heavy silence hung in the air, as they stared at each other. Until Draco croaked out a soft, “Why?”
“It’s not nothing.”
“Do leave fresh flowers on my grave.”
Quidditch Captain. It was against the rules.
Another mystery to solve. It was awfully cryptic, and he had never been the one to solve riddles. The wings of the snitch opened, and he let it hover mid-air.
He hesitated.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake,” The variation of French curses the blond whispered with it were incomprehensible and he figured it was wiser to ignore it. “you’re not my favourite Gryffindor.”
He decided to spare Steve the shell, and headed into the house again. He wasn’t intent on another fight-fest with Malfoy. It was the only reason he had wandered to the shore, and practiced wandless magic. Yet, he couldn't remain outside forever.
“Morning, darling” Harry whispered, trying to not ruin the peaceful ambiance, as Draco turned towards him, a soft smile on his face.
“Fuck you, Potter.”
“I – yes,” He inhales. “I want to kiss you or confess an ‘
“I could’ve, what?”
In the morning, a cleared plate was resting on the kitchen counter, with a note:
“I was at the manor,” Harry said, opening his eyes. “Yes, Malfoy. Your manor.”
Harry wrinkled his nose. The conversation, the whole ordeal, felt similar to a very odd dream. Or nightmare. He had, with a moment of consideration, offered his friendship to Draco Malfoy, who, in fact, had wanted to be friends for six years. Now, he was in a fight-fest with Draco. “I’m confused.”
Draco poured out hot water in two glasses while Harry curled up into him. He was always freezing in winter, and turned into an absolute drama queen.
He cleared his mind and focused on the memories, searching for the fondest one. The one which can light a smile on his face.
“I’m feeling altruistic today, Potter.”
Perhaps, it was love that was stuck there in his throat, if the rambling passion he felt for him that he couldn't form words, "Draco I -"
Draco crawled onto the bed, and kissed him softly. “I love you. I fucking love you – Say it again. Say it all again, and I swear I’ll never stop you.”
regret.”
He glanced at the blank canvas momentarily. Violet and black – A perfect mix. Indistinct speckles of white with a hint of silver. Chaos. Eternal chaos. And he gasped softly as realization dawned on him. It was the sky of his own fancy. Draco Malfoy had painted the sky of his fancy.
A pause.
He frowned in confusion. The blond couldn’t notice it, though, because he was watching the soft crashing of the waves on the shore. “wait, why?”
Harry stared at the sea, and inched closer to the edge. With a shaky breath, he focused on the destination and disapparated with a faint pop.
He cleared his throat and shifted uncomfortably, as he cursed under his breath. He had certainly lost the last bit of sanity he had left. “I – er – I wasn’t staring.”
It subsided, however, when he focused on the soft hum. Potter was a decent hummer.
Of course, he had. He had apparated twice, and it didn’t work. He had nearly drained himself with the wandless Patronus, and he wasn’t going to cast one until he had regained his strength. He closed his fingers around the mirror in his pocket. The two-way mirror. If he'd used it –
If he practiced wandless magic, he could use it as an incentive to lure Malfoy out of the room. It would be a tiny victory. He had to break a few things in the process. And with that he could practice the repairing charm.
I have 5 more chapters ready to post, so they'll be out soon.
“Finding a way out. Or searching for Tinkerbell to – Oh wait – You’re Tinkerbell without wings. Cross that off my to-do list.”
“I’ll pretend you didn’t,” Malfoy chuckled, as he carded his fingers through his hair and brushed the strand of hair out of his face. Harry sighed softly as tuned his head to the sea and focused on the waves crashing against the shore. “It’s insanely satisfying to irritate you.”
Malfoy’s finger traced the picture, and lingered for a second longer – The way it had, on Harry’s jaw near the sea – And his gaze was distant.
card',” He said, icily as he pursed his lips. “Your obligations are fuck-all to me if you can risk the ones around you for that one obligation.”
With a relented sigh, he carefully walked to the bedroom door, and glanced around with a frown. Malfoy wasn’t in the room. “Er – Malfoy?”
Jabs, quips and a banter.
“Yes,” The confusion was clear on Draco’s face, which was sort of comical. Writing a code of conduct for Draco Malfoy was an idea he could entertain. “Rule One: Never thank your overachieving favourite Gryffindor.”
“You probably have a broken jaw with a frankly worrying number of cuts and bruises and it will scar. I don’t care if you decide to drown yourself or get back to your useless attempts at getting out of here, Potter.”
“If it ends in sorrow, it can’t be beautiful,” Malfoy whispered as he turned to the sky and stared the stars. He stared at the night sky with a bit of childish awe and a little fondness. “What kind of tales do you prefer?”
He didn’t write a note at lunch – It was the only way to force Malfoy out of his room. Or force him to write one. The blond would have to give in at one point. And he was counting on it.
“Of course you were,” Draco lifted his head with a soft scoff. “we’re sworn rivals, aren’t we?”
“You can’t,” Draco muttered, staring ahead at the horizon. “You have no idea, do you?”
“He didn’t hurt you, in any way?”
He had been walking around an hour ago, acquainting himself with the place while he thought about the ways to get out of here. He could notify the Order. He had dismissed that idea – The Patronus would have to wait. He wasn’t going to alert them. Not now.
Wasn’t it enough that he was already stranded on a severed Island with his arch nemesis? He hadn’t signed up for dealing with a temperamental Draco Malfoy. Not that he was given a choice in the matter.
“No more, no less.”
“Oh, of course.” He said, with a ghost of smile over his lips and the amusement twinkling in his eyes. “Posture coaching. Perfect attire coaching –
He could vaguely register the voice, but it was distant. He should’ve known. The Dark Lord wanted to make him suffer. Wasn’t it enough? He was alone, in a place severed from the rest of the world.
It wasn’t cold – well, not much anyway – it was sort of moderate temperature-wise, which was sort of confusing but Otryazan was an odd place and it was wiser to not question it. “Draco, can you walk?”
to the Ministry. “Yeah, until you and your inquisitorial squad ruined it because you wanted to please Umbridge for reasons beyond comprehension – so, thank you for your services, which weren’t required.”
