At this time the boys are still healing and not much is known but from we can see Mr. Potter will be considered an honorary Slytherin and shall be no longer considered a Gryffindor. Unfortunately this will change some things for both houses but we shall have to make the best to get used to this new situation.”
Harry was shocked, what could be worse than dying? He started to hyperventilate a little and worked hard to get his breathing under control. The Calming Draught did not appear to be working any longer. Snape got up and got another dose and forced it down Harry’s throat.
Harry just shrugged.
He still couldn’t believe that after 3 years of friendship they would say something like that to him.
Harry cringed knowing that the professor would realize he was the reason for it being an issue.
With that, Snape walked away and locked himself back in his potions lab. Draco was left confused and alone and unsure if he should go back to Harry or believe professor Snape and just leave Harry alone again…
“What happened this time? Another fake out by Scarface Potter?”
She stopped talking because of the view in front of her; Severus was sitting on Harry’s bed and holding his hand.
Harry shut him up by elbowing him when he noticed Malfoy and his gang were close by. Draco Malfoy, a blond knockout with blue-grey eyes, had Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, both bulky boys, behind him as usual, then there was Pansy Parkinson, short brown hair and observant brown eyes and Blaise Zabini, a decent heighted boy with black hair and eyes just as dark, just behind them, being followed by Theodore Knott, a brown haired man with kind blue eyes and Daphne Greengrass, a blond with long hair and bright blue eyes. The Slytherins arriving meant the classroom would open soon and Harry didn’t want Ron to get in trouble before class even started.
Harry finished his homework pretty fast seeing as how he did most while stuck in the infirmary. He did take the time to reread whatever he missed out on but he figured he understood things pretty well so far. He packed everything away and looked at the time and was surprised it was close to lunch, and still Draco hasn’t come back. He wondered what Snape has told him then figured he was probably helping Snape with potions since he enjoyed that. He decided to go look for him. Leaving their room he started to smell some sort of potion so he decided to follow his nose. He ended up at a room that Snape had told him never to disturb. He figured the others must be in there making a potion or something so he decided to make lunch for everyone.
“The bathroom Malfoy?”
So, he continued the lesson, ignoring Harry but treating Draco even better than before. Theo was very confused, wasn’t Harry his omega? Why would anyone treat their omega this way? He felt bad for Harry, he could tell that Harry was feeling very down and it seemed to be affecting his potion making as well.
“Whatever Potter. The left side is yours, I’m on the right. Keep things tidy and we should have no problems.”
Snape snorted and just rolled his eyes. Typical that quidditch is more important than anything to these kids, he wondered how he would deal being stuck with them and their quidditch obsession.
Now, for some background information on the binding potion; it binds things permanently in many different ways, depending on how it was applied. And when it comes to people, the potion can cause very odd reactions. For example, there was a witch back in the day who tried to use the potion to fix a vase that she accidentally broke, unfortunately for her she slipped and the potion went all over her hand. She went straight to wash it off but mixing the potion with water and soap just caused her hand to be permanently slippery as the soap was permanently stuck on her hand and never washed off.
Just as Harry was screaming in pain again and Madame Pomfrey was going to floo Snape, the doors burst open. Two things happened, Harry quieted down right away and Madame Pomfrey dropped the floo powder to the floor.
“Fine, I’ll stay here and work on grading some essays while Potter is working on his homework. Don’t stay out too late.”
“Draco. Your dad was there when Vol; I mean He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, tortured me after the tournament last year. Why would he help me now? Won’t he just take this chance to bring me to the Dark Lord to gain respect or whatever from Him?”
Harry shook his head and stayed still while Snape finished putting the salve on his face. Draco on the other hand just shook his head and tried to ignore the pain he could see in Harry’s face.
“Mr. Potter, you yelled in my classroom. I would never have accepted that no matter who did it. As for the Ravenclaws, there was no proof that they were the ones that attacked you; it could have been other Slytherins so I was not going to punish them too severely without that proof. Now you better get going, you don’t want to be late to your next class.”
She hummed then turned to her potion cabinet and brought back a few of potions for him to take. She made sure he took all of them as sometimes he denied the need for certain ones, but this time he didn’t give any resistance, knowing that he probably needed the 2 pain potions and the calming draught as he could still feel that non physical ache in his chest.
“Alright. Ready to handle the crowd? I believe you have Transfiguration first.”
obey my commands. The rest of our bond we will learn as we go, we may end up feeling each others’ feelings or other side effects may appear but for now we have not seen much other than our positions.
“Severus it’s the strangest thing. He says the feeling is of something pulling out of him he screamed right when I flooed you and passed out from the pain. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Snape didn’t look happy and in fact looked like he didn’t believe a word that Harry said. He had this look like he thought that Harry was just purposely ignoring him now that Madame Pomfrey was no longer around.
“Draco… You have to stop believing all his lies! He’s just trying to manipulate us by telling us these stories and making up all these pitiful fabrications so that we pity him and let him get away with things since we would feel sorry for him. Dumbledore told me that McGonagall was the one to get him and that she met the family and found no problems with them. So I don’t know where he got this version from but it cannot be true.”
The biggest thing with this bond is that the potion itself decided on which role we will be playing in our tri-bond. I am the alpha, which means that you both defer to me in and out of the bedroom, Draco is our beta, he is in the middle, which means you defer to him, but from what we can tell it is mostly in the bedroom as I am in charge of you both outside of it. You, Mr. Potter, are the omega, which may sound like you are in the bottom of the chain but you will be in charge of carrying any children we may want and of their care as well. This will be the hardest part for you to follow, as I know you are used to doing whatever you please, but due to me being Alpha you
“Let’s just say that Harry being known as a Slytherin is not something the school is happy about. You know how they think of us; now imagine a powerful person being thought that way. I’ve heard the words ‘The-Boy-Who-Became-The-New-Dark-Lord’ a few times already. And the Gryffindors… They are so unsupportive. Most of them are calling him a traitor and a deserter, some of them are even angry at him just because they found out he won’t be able to play seeker for their team any longer. They’re all acting like he chose to leave Gryffindor for our house and that Harry wants all of this. It’s disgusting is what it is…”
As always all comments and feedback is appreciated.
Snape walked towards his potions lab leaving Harry and Draco to follow him.
“That makes sense. Now, what about you? When will you spend time with us as our Alpha? I mean Harry and I will be spending most of our days together so there’s no worries there but we need to get used to you as well don’t we?”
“He’s a traitor. That’s all there is to it.”
All comments are appreciated!
“No Potter, you are not dying at this moment but you may feel like that would have been better.”
“Hahaha ya ok. You saw how he was in there, there’s no way he’ll ever favor me and even if he did it would just be the same as every Slytherin gets from him in class.”
“We get to use the guest bathroom, Snape has his own in his room so we don’t have to worry about sharing with him, just each other. Go ahead first and I’ll go after you.”
Well. We can only say that we at the Daily Prophet don’t fully agree with the duo. There is nothing wrong with bisexual relationships or A/B/O relationships and we support those relationships completely.
Malfoy looked shocked that Harry wanted his help with something, or even trusted him to do this.
Snape slowly sent them out of the lab and into their room, giving Harry the paste for his hand and nodding to Draco he left them to settle for bed and went back to his lab.
“It’s fine, I guess. I must have lost them…”
“Calm down Mr. Potter, just breathe, we’ll figure this out. I’ll get Severus again. This is just out of my depth.”
Harry snorted and then just started laughing until he started crying again. When would his pain end? Hasn’t he suffered enough?
Thank you!!
“I understand you are against me for some reason but Draco didn’t do anything and doesn’t deserve to be tortured like this. If you keep going then I might actually do something about all of this and trust me when I say you don’t want me to start getting revenge…”
Snape tried to open up his Potter bubble of feelings but his anger towards him just wouldn’t let him see the truth at this time.
“Potter, poisoning us won’t help your situation, besides, we have house elves to feed us when we’re hungry, no need to try your luck considering how good you are at potions…” Snape sneered looking over what Potter supposedly cooked. It looked good, that just made him think Potter had no hand in it and that the elves made it under his orders.
Harry looked back down at this point. He knew the professor wouldn’t like or believe his answers but he had no choice but be honest with him. He knew things would be much worse if he told any lies and it was found out later on.
“I guess to me cooking is just mixing things that I know the taste of so I know what the outcome will likely be. But with potions, I’m just more confused on what the ingredients will become and what can and cannot mix and how the way ingredients are cut or how the potion is stirred changes everything. It’s so complicated and I always feel like I missed something. As for the elves, all I asked them for was the ingredients to be able to cook this.”
Harry shook his head and just looked petrified. Snape on the other hand was nodding along with Draco.
“Leaving means they win. Plus Professor Snape would not be impressed with me if I’m the cause of us missing class. Just leave it as is and once we leave I’ll change it back. Draco, it’s nothing I haven’t dealt with before. Last year was worse so don’t worry.”
Harry shook his head; unsure about what else could be a problem, but knowing in his gut that this is just the start of things. He was just about to ask another question when Snape decided he had enough and left the infirmary. That’s when Harry noticed that Malfoy was awake and had been listening the whole time.
Snape and Malfoy were at first surprised when he just showed his hand. And then they both growled when they saw the blood, both grabbing his hand and trying to see what exactly is happening for him to be bleeding.
Harry was still unsure of everything and didn’t want to fully deal with the public but at the same time he knew that hiding would just makes things worse for him when he finally did show up. He took a deep breath and stood up with Draco’s help.
“Thanks Theo, no one took the time to explain things like this for me but it makes much more sense now. I may actually be able to pass my potions owl with you as a partner.” Harry smiled widely looking up at the tall boy. Theo on the other hand just nodded his head while looking down at him.
“Potter, I told you on our first day, you don’t want to make friends with the wrong sort. Those two, they are definitely the wrong sort.”
Draco sighed and decided to trust Harry and just keep his head down at this time. The other Slytherins were not completely happy about this but followed their lead. The Ravenclaws at this time just kept changing Harry’s outfit feeling unhappy that it didn’t seem to be bothering him. So instead they targeted Draco. They changed Draco’s outfit to super girly looks. Skirts, pink tops, or just a pink bra at one point. Draco decided to follow Harry’s lead and ignore it but everyone could tell he was getting super angry and annoyed. Then out of the blue Harry just blew up.
“Harry, he does it to you all the time, it’s our turn to drop random stuff in his potion.” Ron was having trouble keeping his voice low as he turned red from frustration, he just couldn’t understand why it was a bad idea. In his mind, this was the perfect revenge for the insults Malfoy was throwing them constantly. The idea of getting Malfoy to fail a potion, which he has never done yet, was his favorite revenge plan. Ron thought he could get away with it, because no one would guess he did anything, if anything Harry would be blamed but with the amount of detention Harry is getting because of Umbridge he didn’t think Harry would mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Potter got to you didn’t he? You pity him or something, and you believed all his lies about his so called adventures. I wanted to talk to you about that because I don’t want you played by him. Those so called adventures are all lies, Dumbledore reassured all us teachers that Potter, Granger and Weasley were never in any danger and that he was there with them the whole time. He just lets them get away with lying about what happened because he likes the stories they come up with.”
Harry looked aside and saw Madame Pomfrey give a potion to Malfoy, who looked like he woke up a while ago as he seemed less confused than Harry felt. Harry still tried to sit up to check on Malfoy, feeling guilty he couldn’t get to him on time; when he noticed some small red scarring on Malfoy’s once spotless face. He never noticed that he had burns all over his own left side. The pain didn’t hit him until he went to stand up; then his chest started to stretch and he whimpered.
(See the end of the chapter for
*Flashbacks*
“It’s the bond. It is forcing him to be around one of his dominants. That is why the pain would leave as soon as I showed up and why it started when Mr. Malfoy left the room. Mr. Potter, can you hear me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
’ Harry sighed and took a deep breath before opening his eyes and grabbing his wand to check the time. 5:30. He jumped straight out of bed and rushed to his trunk to grab what he needed then ran to the bathroom to get ready before Snape showed up. Harry showered and got dressed and made it back to the bathroom just before 6 and realized that Draco was still asleep. With wide eyes he went to go wake him up unsure how Snape would react to Draco not being ready, unfortunately he was too late.
Meanwhile, Snape was busy trying to understand the potion that Weasley created, he was analyzing it and testing it and just trying to see if there was any way to make a cure because he definitely didn’t want to be stuck being bound to two fifteen year olds. He knew he could at least be happy with Draco, even if it was a little peculiar since he knew him since he was young, but Potter…  How could he possibly have a civil relationship with a Potter?
“I have no idea why he hates me. I never even knew about Magic until about a month before the train. Plus my relatives locked away my books so I couldn’t even read some of them before classes started. Then during our first class I was writing down what he was saying, I was looking forward to the class so much because it sounded so interesting, but he thought I was just not paying attention and then asked me those hard questions and I just tried so hard but nothing I did was good enough so I just gave up. Nothing I do will be good enough for Snape and I have accepted that, and now that he’s my Alpha nothing I do will ever be up to his standards and I’ll just have to live with that.”
Draco looked over at the Slytherin, it was Theo Nott, he frowned… He had no issues with Theo but he was worried about Harry. Plus he had it in his mind that he would help Harry bring his marks up in Potions.
“More than a broken arm but less than the basilisk venom?” Harry was never sure how to rate his pain as he has a higher threshold than most, so he uses examples and lets Pomfrey figure out where that would range.
Harry was a little unsure if the other two would even want to try food he made but he just had this feeling that he should make sure his beta and alpha got fed. He knew the potion in him was causing that feeling but it felt like second nature to do this and he was one to follow his instincts. Now if only the other two followed theirs.
Snape on the other hand just ignore the pain he could see in Potter’s face, he knew that the pain wasn’t that bad and that Potter had worse so he didn’t bother with going gentler. He was just finishing up Potter’s face when Draco showed up all ready to face the day.
Harry was trying to keep his mind on questions he has and not on how much his life will change due to one of his best friends.
"Speach"
“Let’s get started then.”
“Harry? What is he talking about? All we did was go to Umbridge for Harry’s detention…”
Harry nodded and let go of Draco’s hand and just walked to back to his room where he looked for all the work he missed. He didn’t have much thankfully since he did some while stuck in the hospital wing, but he still had some left so he got to it.
“A lot of luck? I honestly couldn’t tell you. Every year there’s something and every year I come out worse for it but luckily enough I come out alive. This year I have Umbridge now this bond of ours to deal with… Who knows how I’ll be at the end of the year considering we’re only in October...”
I'm so sorry for taking so long to update. Personal life was a mess and I just couldn't get back into writing.
With that Draco started walking away catching up with Pansy and Daphne while Harry and Theo slowly caught up with them walking quietly. Once they got to the Great Hall they were all stared at once more. Harry had almost forgotten the article that was printed in the Prophet since Potions surprisingly went with no problems from the Gryffindors. But now that they aren’t only with Snape he can tell that they want to get back at him for his so called ‘betrayal’. Luckily, when he sat down and looked at his schedule he noticed he had Charms with the Ravenclaws after lunch, so he can hopefully postpone his confrontation with the Gryffindors for a little longer since this was his last class before the weekend. He planned on staying in his rooms for most of it trying to catch up to classes, both new and old.
’ and then everything came back. He finally opened his eyes and tried to sit up.
Snape on the other hand saw Harry’s reaction so he grabbed the paper from Minerva’s hands and just growled. He was not impressed. Getting up he warned the teachers that Draco and Harry may be late for their first class. Then he followed the two boys out of the hall while the rest of the students and teachers were busy reading the Daily Prophet and staring at the picture on the first page, a picture of Harry with all his scars holding Draco’s hand and semi smiling at each other while at the infirmary.
Draco slowly opened his eyes and just whined a little before finally sitting up and looking over to see if Harry was awake as well. He noticed that his bed was empty and so figured he must be up and then looked over to Snape.
I miss you both, please come see me.
“We’ll make sure that either Draco or I are nearby and hopefully with time you will be able to distance yourself from us. But for now you will stay in my rooms and share classes with Draco so as to stop the pain from coming back.”
Harry sniffled and curled into himself feeling unsure of everything and everyone and just feeling like this bonding will be just like being at the Dursleys and so he just laid all curled up in a ball on the bed and cried. He let go of his control and just let all his emotions out, mostly in tears, and just couldn’t stop himself from bawling his eyes out feeling like he will never find himself a real family or love or anything that he had always wished for. The Dursley’s were right that he was an unlovable freak.
Malfoy asked Snape as he noticed Harry’s shudder and completely understood the feeling after hearing about his time in the lake. Snape looked over at Draco a little confused trying to understand why he would want to get rid of the window now when he had no issues before.
“Harry? What is this? What does it mean a cupboard?”
McGonagall just stood there with her mouth open. She knew she was ignoring what was happening but she figured if Potter and Malfoy weren’t bothered she would just let it all be.
“Greasy Git… I’m doing it with or without you Harry.”
Second year was harder for both of them, for Harry to talk about and for Malfoy to believe.
Harry was now crying and sobbing due to the pain but a second later the pain just disappeared. He laid back flat on his back and tried to catch his breath. Snape walked up to him and sneered.
"Speach"
“You mean Weasley stole them. I did see him burning something outside yesterday when Snape took a turn trying out his new potion on you. I thought he looked unusually happy. What were they?”
He could hear Hermione say in his ear as he was trying not to suffocate from her hair. He finally managed to push her off and gave her a confused look.
It was the most feelings Harry had felt since the accident and he was somewhat glad for Draco and his distraction. But now that the story was over he started to feel numb some more. Draco on the other hand had a lot to think through, he never knew how much Harry was going through every year and he started to feel a little bad for how he treated him all these years. Draco just thought Harry had it easy and that everyone treated him like he was special and now he realized just how wrong he was. He had a lot of thinking to do.
“Sorry sir, you startled me. We were just spelling my trunk so that others can’t get access, Ron already stole some stuff from it and I just don’t want to chance that happening again. Malfoy was teaching me some new spells to do this.”
“Calm down Potter, wait until you hear what I have to say before you panic yourself to pass out.”
Harry, a short young man with black hair and green emerald eyes, Ron, a tall red headed boy with freckles all over his face, and Hermione, a young lady with bushy hair and clever eyes, were waiting for their double potions class to start and the door to open. Leaning against the wall they were arguing about a prank Ron wanted to pull on Malfoy for revenge. While still keeping their voices as down as possible not be overheard they kept disagreeing.
Draco noticed Harry’s face drop when he was told he couldn’t play quidditch. He knew how much that game meant to him and having him off the team will be very very hard on him.
Snape seemed to be in his no nonsense, no favorable attitude, in other words his teacher mode. Harry winced and went to sit down with Lavender but he was pulled away and pushed towards the Slytherin instead.
“Harry. Family means everything to us Malfoys and now that we are bound together that makes us a type of family. He may discuss things with our Lord and keep him updated but he wouldn’t do anything that would hurt you. Not only because you’re now family but also because hurting you would hurt me and Severus. You have nothing to fear at this time. Now let’s go see Severus before he gets angry we didn’t follow him.”
She got up and opened the door waiting for Harry to get himself ready to face the world once more. He slowly got out of his chair and nodded to her as he left the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry cringed. At least it meant he liked his cooking but there was no way potions was the same to him and he should have known that Snape wouldn’t believe in him.
As for you Mr. Potter, put this cream on your hand and get some rest. You will have a busy day tomorrow following Draco around with your new schedule.”
“Any other questions at this time Mr. Potter? If not I have to go brew some more salve for you and Mr. Malfoy.”
“Ummm… What about the classes I haven’t been taking yet? Draco is in Arithmancy and Ancient Runes while I was in Divination and Care of Magical Creatures. So I guess this means I’m dropping Divination, which I don’t mind and since Draco is also in Care we should be fine there but the other two courses I have no clue about.”
“As you are aware, the leech juice reacts strongly to this potion when not given in the right dosage, and the amount that Weasley” He sneered Ron’s name so harshly Harry cringed; “dosed the potion with was quite a bit too much. Unfortunately for us, it caused a lot of permanent issues, including the scars you will be stuck with. The main concern is what it did to us three as a whole.”
“Draco, what is our first class this morning? Maybe I can just get started on reading ahead or something while you finish eating…”
Draco just froze and looked at Harry and shook his head to get rid of all his thoughts then nodded to Harry.
“Right. I forgot about that. And you are sure I’m the omega? Does this mean I can’t have a job or friends or anything?”
Snape returned to his potions room to see Draco finishing up a pepper up potion and bottling it.
“What?”
“We just got your trunk yesterday, I guess your old dormmates had access unless you have spells on it.”
Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and squeezed it. He was so grateful that Draco was there and helping him. He was sad about not playing Quidditch but it’s mostly the flying he would miss. The help for classes and his advice on making friends will also hopefully help him settle in his new place as a Slytherin.
Draco first looked guilty when he realized that he forgot to let the professor know where they were going but then he looked shocked. He had no idea what the professor was talking about when he said Harry was hurting…
“Hagrid was the one that picked me up when the Dursleys decided to ignore all the letters I was getting. He somehow found me in the middle of nowhere, gave Dudley a pig tail (Harry giggled a little at this memory.) and then we went to Diagon Alley and he brought me to the bank, gave the goblins my key and we went to my vault and the ‘secret’ vault for Dumbledore’s top secret item and then he left me to get my clothes at Madame Malkins and went back to the pub to get a drink because the carts don’t agree with him. When he came back he had bought me Hedwig, my owl, and then we went to get the books. He had my list, but I should have asked to read it myself instead of just following his instructions… It’s my fault I didn’t get all the books, it’s my fault that there are things I don’t understand even if I should have known I was missing something! It’s all my fault!”
Thanks everyone!!!
“No ma’am, I just get in real big pain if one of the bondmates isn’t nearby and so I had to have one of them with me. If there’s any other way of doing this just let me know.”
He slowly got himself ready for bed, making sure that his glamours are still up and Draco couldn’t see the scars he has from his own so called family. After that he settled in bed and rolled away from Draco and tried to get himself calm enough to sleep.
Pansy was not impressed. She knew the rumors, she knew that they were easy to dismiss and deny. But now, the Prophet has most of the truth and put them all in a bad view…
“There was a whole other side to the list. Hagrid…well it’s not just his fault… I should have noticed it too. I guess I was just so excited about all of it. I had just found out I was a wizard and that there was this whole other world that I could be part of… I just wanted somewhere to belong… But of course even here I had to be a freak… And then when I was sent back home the Dursleys' locked all my things in the cupboard and so I couldn't even read what I did buy at Diagon Alley...”
Malfoy smirked and answered with a superior voice.
The whole school was so busy reading the news and gossiping they didn’t notice when the trio left. They just knew that Harry was now officially no longer a Gryffindor and that he was obviously trouble and a liar and now that he was a Slytherin he was dangerous.
“You killed the Dark Lord’s host by touching his face?! You murdered someone at the age of 11? No wonder you were so messed up after that…”
“I… umm… I haven’t… I just never got it and just found out about the other side of the list from first year… The ‘teacher’ that got me from my muggle household was Hagrid and as great a person he is, he just shouldn’t be the one introducing people to magic…”
“I don’t know Madame Pomfrey. It was like this pain of something pulling out of me or something missing and then the pain just stopped. I never felt anything like this before. Wait. Oh no, it’s coming back. Madame Pomfrey it’s happening again.”
“I thought you were both busy with potions so I figured I’d get lunch going for everyone. I just finished if you guys are hungry?”
“Professor can we get rid of the window or is it permanent?”
“Right, and you need one of us with you… Let me just grab a book to read, I don’t think the professor would be a good choice right now. Are you sure you’re ok?”
“In fact, before we even go into the chamber we need to figure out a way to fix the cave in that Lockhart caused. I doubt you want to go through the small hole I managed when I was twelve.”
“Harry, I apologize for making you feel you cannot trust me. I understand why you feel this way and I will try harder to be a better Alpha to both of you. Now, as for this, how was this accomplished? She obviously didn’t use a knife or something did she?”
Snape sneered and just shook his head, of course Potter was to blame that’s no surprise. He got off the bed and left Draco to get ready for the day. He figured he might as well get the salve done as he didn’t need Draco for that part of their planned day. He walked into the living room and just sneered at Potter as he noticed that he seemed half asleep on his sofa.
Malfoy snorted.
Malfoy hasn’t stopped pestering him since he found out he couldn’t leave Harry alone in the infirmary, at first it wasn’t so bad as they both used the time to catch up on homework but the longer Harry was stuck in bed, the worse Malfoy was getting.
(See the end of the chapter for
Long time reader, first time writer, would appreciate all comments!
Harry smiled widely at Draco glad that at least one of them likes his cooking. He thought it tasted quite alright himself, and hoped that Snape would at least try it.
“Sorry sir, I had a rough night. Potter kept waking me up due to his dreams, he didn’t stop crying either. I don’t know what he was dreaming of but it was hard to sleep through his reactions.”
Harry was very confused. Both Ron and Hermione stopped speaking to him when his name was called, saying he was a cheat and a traitor and that he should have told them how he did it, even when he told them he never put his name in. None of this made sense to him, how could they just pretend they never betrayed him.
After a couple more days of bed rest and salve treatment Harry was finally allowed out of bed and out of the infirmary. Snape and Malfoy brought him to Snape’s rooms in the dungeons where they showed him the guest room he would be sharing with Malfoy. It had two double beds on each side of the room and a window showing the underside of the lake, that part made Harry shudder.
“Thank Merlin that class is over. Brown does nothing but talk in class and then complains when she’s supposed to touch anything that she figures would ‘ruin her nails’ and then she complained about being the one stirring the potion as the fumes would ruin her hair… Harry I hope you are happy I made you sit with Theo, between you and Brown there would have been no chance for you to pass the day never mind the class.” Draco snickered showing the others’ he didn’t really mean it even if it was probably true.
"Speech"
“Potter… Mr. Potter!”
“You left our rooms without notifying me where you were going, you didn’t leave me a note or anything. Then when I felt Mr. Potter in pain I couldn’t find him. Draco, what were you two doing that caused you to feel at peace while Harry here was hurting?”
“Don’t let him fool you Draco. I told you, he can manipulate his feelings. He’s a good story teller I’ll give him that, but he’s also a big liar.”
“Be that as it may, I have to tell you what the side effects we have discovered are so far. You will not like what I have to say but you will stay quiet and stay seated until I am finished. Then you may ask any questions related to this situation you may have, but you are not to leave this bed any time soon. Is this understood? If you try to leave I will tie you to the bed.”
He gave that to Madame Pomfrey to send and hoped for the best. Then he started thinking about his past and what he did tell Draco. He realized that during his recollection he did seem to notice the boys more than the girls. He wasn’t sure if it was just an age thing at first but the more he thought about it, the more he realized that it wasn’t Cho he was really looking at, but Cedric. And that this year, so far, he was noticing Seamus’ arse more than Lavender’s. So he thought it out.
Snape just smirked and scoffed. As if a Potter would trust a Snape.
“Harry… Why didn’t you tell me she was hurting you? I wouldn’t have let you go to detention if I knew!”
“Potter, what do you mean Hagrid missed half the list?”
As always all feedback is appreciated!!
Harry cringed at the hate he could still hear in his bondmate's voice. He grew up in a loveless household and always hoped that one day he’d find his own family and make sure it was filled with love. He supposed he just wasn’t meant to have that.
How could he possibly just forget who the brats’ parents are? He loved one of them and hated the other just as strongly, it was impossible to just let those feelings go.
Harry sighed, it was a start at least, he figured it was better than nothing, being civil was better than anything they had before. He walked into the washroom and locked the door, he knew he couldn’t shower due to the fresh salve on his burns but he didn’t like changing in front of people due to the other scars he had from his home life. He wished the salved worked better on scars because he would have tried to find a way to apply to his back. He turned and looked at his back in the mirror. ‘FREAK’ was spelled on his mid back, just in a spot where he couldn’t reach it, and he just tried not to remember how he got it there from his uncle and cousin. He changed quickly and did the rest of his night time business and left the bathroom to finally lay back down on his bed ready to fall asleep.
“Mmmm, professor, you have to try this. It’s actually quite delicious. Thank you Potter.”
And with that Madame Pomfrey left Harry alone with a professor who hates him and his school rival, he physically shrunk down on himself. At least the pain was no longer in the way, he could think past that a lot easier, now if only his anxiety would also diminish. Harry was so busy thinking through his anxious thoughts that he never heard the professor trying to get his attention.
Harry, who was not asleep but merely thinking, looked over to Snape and nodded his head meekly while standing up with his arm out, his teeth were biting his lip so that he could prepare himself for the pain, he kept his head down because he didn’t like the feeling he got when he looked over at Snape. He figured his Omega senses are starting up and he wasn’t sure how he felt about that.
The boys on the other hand just looked at each other and then shrugged, Harry got up from his bed and turned to his newly warded trunk and grabbed his nightly necessaries.
“Of course you didn’t think; when do you ever? Get into the living room and wait for us there, make sure you’re ready for more salve on your burns.”
Harry dreaded going to the chamber but he did promise Draco and he could tell that he was excited about the idea of seeing Slytherin’s chamber. Besides, Harry wasn’t sure how far in they would be able to go due to the cave in at the entrance, he figured he better remind Draco about that.
Malfoy spent another full day in bed before he was allowed to get up and walk around. His scarring was minimal and barely noticeable unless you knew what to look for; it only looked like a silver tear by his right eye. His most severe injury was his right shoulder from when he and Harry fell from the explosion, but that was now healed completely. Harry on the other hand still had burns all over his left side of his face, arm and chest. It was slowly getting better but was still red and raw looking and still hurt when he moved in certain ways. Malfoy made sure Harry knew that he was healed and how he looked almost good as new and how he was able to finally leave.
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand in warning; he didn’t want to anger Snape any more than he usually is. Especially since he’s already so against everything Harry does. He did wonder if their so called Alpha will be spending any time with them other than in class.
*Flashbacks*
“Ahh, Potter. Brought a little company? I’m sorry Mr. Malfoy but this is detention, Potter cannot have company while he does his work.”
Always appreciate any comments!
“Didn’t bother to wake up your roommate? Were you trying to make yourself look better than him or something?”
“What happened this time?”
As always ALL comments are appreciated!
They both came out of their room ready to face the day, books for the day in their bags, both trying to pretend that it’s just another normal day even though it’s far from normal.
Draco kneeled next to Harry trying to convince him to leave the class but Harry just keep shaking his head.
Snape ran some tests, as a potion master he also needed to have the basics of healing, but as a dark arts specialist he knew more than most about curses and such. The results of all his tests were in the negatives. He couldn’t see any reason for this supposed pain the boy is in.
“Pansy, what’s the gossip so far? What should we warn them about? I mean, if it were me I’d want to know what the school is saying.” Theo was looking at Pansy hoping that she knew more than he did about the rumors.
“Right. I just came with your next treatment of the salve; this one should also help with the scarring.”
Draco walked out and sat in the chair that appeared and just decided to give his thoughts a break and opened his potions book to study while Harry finished his detention. He had enough thinking going this day and his mind needed a break, plus he had a potions essay due next week.
~parseltongue~
“Is it ok if I go for a walk? I need to think this through.”
‘I guess I was warned... Just didn’t expect it to sting so strongly…’
Draco turned around from where he was getting dressed himself, and just nodded walking out the room and towards the bathroom.
Harry shook his head and just sighed. He didn’t understand why Snape hated him but he knew that it would mean that if this bond is permanent he would always be miserable with his bondmate. He was just glad that Draco and him buried the hatchet.
Draco on the other hand went straight to his desk and started his letter for his father. He knew he would get in a little trouble for being so late with an update on what was going on. But he hoped that his father would understand that things have been a little hectic on his end and this was the first chance he really had to write to him.
“Boys, are we alright or do we need to go back to the infirmary for a calming draught?”
“Draco, wake up, it’s past 6, you’ve slept in, it’s not like you to do so.”
Things will be better now as writing will be part of my own therapy so hopefully I can remember the story I wanted originally.
“Do you know what a bonding is?” At Harry’s paling face he figured that Harry had an idea if not knew what he was talking about. “Right, well, the Binding agent decided to bind us in a way that is not physical, unlike its usual ways where there’s a physical component to the binding. For us, it decided to bind us by bonding the three of us together, with a permanent bond. As you are certainly aware a bond is like a marriage but made with magic, it is usually done with a ritual and spoken promises but since this one was done accidentally we are not one hundred percent sure what it may entail. Most bonds demand certain fidelity; definitely there will be no sex with any others, it may even deny us from certain touches, like a hug or a kiss on the cheek, we are unaware of how far this bond is tied at this moment.
“Goodnight Malfoy.”
They noticed that Snape was already gone from their rooms so they looked at each other and nodded, this was it, this was the start of their new school life. Harry was just shaking a little out of nerves but Draco gave him a soft smile and led him out to the great hall.
“Well, since you told me your adventures, and you plan on showing me the chamber of secrets, is there anything I can explain to you about anything? Like the wizarding world or our bond of anything?”
As usual I love all comments!!!
Once they entered the great hall the first thing they noticed was the stares. Everyone was staring at them and whispering to each other. They looked up at Snape and he shook his head, obviously he had the same welcome when he showed up. They slowly walked to the Slytherin table and noticed that Draco’s friends made room for them both.
“Quiet Ron, we agreed to hear him out. Just because he’s stuck being Malfoy and Professor Snape’s sub doesn’t mean that he won’t fight it tooth and nail and figure out a way to maintain a real relationship with a girl.”
Snape and Draco both looked down at his hand and thought about what he said. Snape especially was feeling a little guilty.
“I have it under control Poppy, thank you. If you are done with his treatment for now I’d appreciate some privacy for this.”
McGonagall jumped a little when he started speaking, she was not expecting him to still be in her classroom. She put down her notes, took a seat at her desk and looked over at her former lion cub. She did notice that other than his scars he did look very drained and weary, she felt a little bad for him, but at the same time she wasn’t sure what she could do or could have done to help at this time.
All comments are really appreciated!!
“Yes sir. Can you just tell me one thing? Am I going to die?”
He hummed while cooking, feeling himself a little as he is so used to cooking for the Dursleys’, he also figured the need he felt to cook for his bondmates was part of his omega coming out a little. He didn’t mind so much though seeing as how he basically lived that way every summer anyways, and hopefully his new ‘family’ won’t be so physical with him.
“Severus, was Scarface faking again? Seriously, Potter, don’t you have better things to do than annoy everyone around you?”
The next couple of days Harry woke up feeling numb. His body, his emotions, everything was just numb. He wasn’t sure what to do next or how to fix things. Wasn’t even sure if he wanted to even try to fix anything, he was just so tired of being the one to reach out and forgive all the time. He remembered last year, Ron and Hermione both didn’t believe him about his not entering the triwizard tournament; they both turned their back on him calling him a traitor and a liar. Then there was second year when they both feared him when they found out about his being able to speak parseltongue. Every time he seemed to need them most they would turn on him and he was so very tired of it, but he always made up with them when they came back because they were his first and only friends; he didn’t know how to make new ones. He remembered how he forgave them last year:
“Why is it you can cook but you can’t make potions Potter? Or did you just get the elves to make this for you?”
Harry was listening carefully knowing that this could be on his OWLS this year; meanwhile Ron was daydreaming about the next quidditch match against Hufflepuff.
Snape got up and left without finishing his supper and went back to his potions lab. Malfoy had just finished his last bite and looked over at Harry.
“Mr. Malfoy, why don’t you sit outside my office, I’ll make sure to have a chair there for you. As for you Mr. Potter, you know the drill by now.”
“Harry, calm down, we can handle this. You are not alone and knowing the Slytherins they are on our side as well. Just breathe and relax a little, please.”
We will keep an eye on this situation and keep you updated!
“How can he make up his feelings now? Can you feel this fear he has? He was terrified of you and not in just a ‘I’ll get in trouble’ kind of way.”
* Harry had just defeated the dragon and was waiting his turn to be healed by Madame Pomfrey when all of a sudden he was engulfed by a hug full of brown bushy hair.
With that Draco left their rooms and Snape sat at his desk getting some essays to work on.
“Call me if you need me for anything boys, I’ll just be in my office.”
Harry grabbed the paper and his face just dropped, he turned white and you could tell he was having a panic attack. Draco grabbed his arm and pulled him away from the table and towards the exit, he knew Harry shouldn’t have looked that the paper.
At first Harry thought it was just an accident. His robe kept changing into random outfits, he semi laughed the first time but when it kept happening he was starting to feel targeted. Especially when he could hear some Ravenclaws trying not to giggle or snicker at him. Draco and the rest of the Slytherins were starting to get angry. They could tell Harry wasn’t going to do anything but they weren’t going to leave it be.
Theo looked down at Harry and saw that Harry was actually partially amused about that, but that he also looked like he might be putting himself down. He wasn’t sure what to say this time. Thankfully Draco decided to show up and take over the conversation.
Snape was frustrated that his so called bondmates didn’t leave him any notice on where they were. He was hoping that Draco at least would leave behind a note or something but looking around their rooms he found nothing at all.
*Flashbacks*
(See the end of the chapter for
“Take a seat boys, we won’t be waiting on you to start if you don’t.”
He sat back down and waited while Harry got his breathing under control again and then started to explain what the main side effects they’ve noticed are.
“Now, due to the last class mishap I am in need of more scar removal cream. While this cream does not completely remove the scars, it does diminish them and help heal most of it…”
As usual please comment!! Any feedback is good!
Harry started to take deep breathes to stop his panic attack. ‘
Snape seemed really confused. He specifically remembered the Headmaster had told him that McGonagall was the one that did the home visit to Potter. He also said that McGonagall reassured him that Potter’s family was fine and supportive of everything. So now he didn’t know what was the truth and what was the lie? Who did he believe? The one who he was told is a liar and exaggerator? Or the one that he had always trusted but that he also knows that he likes to lie when it suits him…
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco wasn’t going to keep quiet. Even if Harry kept trying to stop him from saying anything. McGonagall looked over at them and saw Harry with a skirt and a tube top which he was trying to change back to his uniform.
“Harry, don’t look. It’s not good. Oh Merlin, my parents… This is bad. So bad. They’re going to kill me…” This was not how he wanted his parents to find out about the bond.
“Alright, I searched everything I could find and studied the potion that caused our bond and unfortunately everything I researched and discovered just proved that we are stuck together forever. Nothing; and I mean light and dark spells and potions, nothing will work to dissolve this bond. So this means that we have to find a way to work together and deal with all the side effects and whatever else this will cause. To start with, Potter, since you have to always be around one of us, you will be taking the same classes as Draco and eating at the Slytherin table. Basically you are now considered an honorary Slytherin. I already spoke to the rest of the Slytherins and they are aware of this and the fact that you are considered our bondmate. McGonagall spoke to the Gryffindors so they are also aware of your situation. Any questions so far?”
Harry sat back down and leaned back against the pillows on the bed. He grabbed his glasses from the side table and winced when it touched the left side of his head. Then he finally investigated his left arm and left side of his chest. It seemed like he healed quite a bit thanks to Madame Pomfrey, but the skin was still raw and red and very sore looking. He touched his face and could feel that it probably looked the same as the rest of him. Then the pain started up.
“Sev… Stop. Take a look at how you feel inside. Try and feel his feelings. This is real. He is not just exaggerating.”
“Thanks for trying Malfoy, but I’ll have to get used to it anyways since we’re in the dungeons and I know we’re under the lake, seeing it just makes it more real.”
“She has this quill that uses our blood when we write lines. She has been doing this to a few of us Gryffindors and a couple of Ravenclaws as well that we noticed so far. Umbridge has only targeted people who have no guardians in the wizarding world. When I was first stuck doing this Hermione came up with the idea of Murtlap Essence to use to help diminish the pain and the scarring. Now I suppose I’ll just get used to it, it’s not as bad as I’m used to anyways.”
Harry applied the salve and cringed a little at the sting it first caused.
“Things to hide from Snape, Potter? And you trust me to show you spells I don’t know my way around?”
“Sit down Potter before I tie you to the bed; you are injured and the rest of us are in no shape to satisfy your every whims.” Snape practically barked out at him. He was stressed and angry and his anger was being directed to the closest person he could think of.
"Speech"
“The binding is permanent and if a person gets dosed with it odd things have been known to happen, for example there was a wizard who drank a vial thinking it was a calming draught and when he started to sweat, whichever piece of clothing that touched his sweat permanently glued to his body.”
Hermione raised her hand right away, Snape looked around hoping someone else would have an answer but eventually nodded at her to reply.
Draco noticed Harry’s face and his heart felt like it was ready to cry. He walked straight to Harry and just held his hand and let Harry tighten his hold on him. Harry on the other hand was even closer to tears just knowing that he at least had Draco in his corner and that he wasn’t completely as alone as he feels.
And with that both of them left, stomping their way out of the infirmary and out of Harry’s life. He was officially done with them. He wasn’t going to forgive them, not this time. He gave them a chance and they ruined it. He was done.
Umbridge just gave him the quill and some parchment and told him to start.
“Malfoy, do you know if this changes anything while we’re at Hogwarts or summer vacation or anything?”
“Can Harry fly with the Slytherin team during practices at least? As for spending time with Gryffindors, I’m sure we can manage something for you Harry, I don’t want you to be without your friends, but hopefully you’ll also make friends with the Slytherins. And I’ll definitely help you with both classes, we’ll talk to the teachers and see if they can assign you the work we did in third year and such.”
Call me surprised but I got the strangest and most exciting news yesterday. A letter written to me about our very own boy-who-lived, Harry Potter, something that does not involve He-Who-Must-Be-Named but that will surprise you all when you hear of it.
“Sorry Malfoy, what do you want me to do?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was really getting worried, what if they didn’t believe him. What if this pain was going to come and go forever and he had no way to deal with it. He started to cry out in pain again. It was almost worse than before, the pulling feeling felt like something inside him was getting stretched further and further away. The pain was getting so strong he started having trouble catching his breath.
Snape had enough of the boys ignoring what he was doing and of them not thinking he might want to see this so called chamber.
Harry kept his head down when he spoke.  He knew that both Snape and Malfoy had a passion for potions so he didn’t want anything that he said to be seen as an insult or something. Snape sneered while Malfoy just looked confused.
Harry gave him a glare and shook his head; he was busy slowly adding some Lovage leaves to the semi boiling, yellow colored potion before moving to the next step with the leech juice. He could already tell he was a few steps behind from most everyone else thanks to Ron’s laziness. So he just continued to ignore what Ron was saying and trying to do the potion the best he could on his own.
*Flashbacks*
“This is a healing paste of my own making. It will sting a little when you put it on but just for a few seconds, then it should numb your hand and hopefully heal it nicely after a few days of using it. Now, as for Lucius, he is a close friend of mine and he knows that I would stop him from kidnapping you for the Dark Lord. As for his status as a Death Eater, keep that to yourself as he is doing important work with this position. Draco, go ahead and start that letter for your father, I’ll make sure it gets sent tomorrow morning with my owl.
Now poor Mr. Malfoy and Professor Snape are trapped in a so called relationship with The-Boy-Who-Lived. Hopefully this means that Mr. Potter will be in under control and will no longer spread his lies and cause any more trouble for our ministry.
“Oh. Already done? That wasn’t bad, was it? I was expecting it to last longer.”
“Not a problem Harry. You’re one of us now and we take care of our own in Slytherin as I’m sure Professor Snape or Draco explained. Besides, with you on my team maybe Snape will be easier on us.”
“Mr. Potter! I realize that you were getting frustrated with the situation, but there is a reason I am around. Yelling in class like this is inappropriate. 10 points from Slytherin, and 5 from Ravenclaw. Now everyone put your wands away class is about to be dismissed.”
Blaise, Theo, Pansy, Daphne, Millicent, Vincent and Gregory were all grouped together, unimpressed with everything going on. They had to find a way to support the boys. Slytherins stuck together and now that Potter was a Slytherin they now had his back.
One other thing that was stated by Mr. Weasley is that Mr. Potter can only be separated by his partners for a certain length without being in pain. According to him, this means that Mr. Potter is now an honorary Slytherin as he has to stay close to his bondmates (who are both Slytherins themselves) and this was the best way to stop his pain. Mr. Weasley even confirmed that Mr. Potter no longer sleeps in the Gryffindor Tower, which Mr. Weasley states is fine with the Gryffindors as he is not welcome there at this time.
Chapter 9: Partially Understood. Finally.
“I… Wha?..”
Draco on the other hand was just about to leave the room to use the bathroom himself and just nodded to Harry and left the boy alone. Draco was unsure what to think of Potter’s attitude and how friendly he himself was being as well. While in the washroom taking his shower he tried to figure if his new status was the reason he was pitying Potter and being so unlike his usual self. ‘He is my omega now, maybe I’m just feeling the beta attitude quicker than we expected… Oh well, it doesn’t matter, we’re stuck with each other and things are better with us getting along.’ Draco nodded to himself, finished in the washroom and walked back to their bedroom, he noticed Harry was already asleep and so quietly crawled into his own bed and passed right out.
With that dismissal she looked back down to her notes expecting him to be leaving her classroom. Harry wasn’t going to let it drop but Draco, who waited for him at the doorway rushed to pull him over and just told him to drop it.
He let Harry’s hand go and went towards the floo to call Malfoy over. Pomfrey was the only one who noticed the tears in Harry’s eyes as he processed what was just said.
With everything for that day done and a busy day tomorrow Draco was quick to slip into bed. Now to explain everything to his friends and acquaintances tomorrow and hope they treat Harry decently.
Snape sneered at Harry. He should have known he was getting into trouble already, but to get a detention so soon after being hospitalized must have been some sort of record.
“I’m not trying to poison anyone, I… I cook all the time at home so it’s no big deal cooking for us. Besides, I was going to eat with you as well… if you didn’t mind.”
Draco looked over at Harry and saw just how petrified he was about meeting his father. He gave Harry a gentle smile to try to calm him down a little.
Harry was slowly waking up; Snape looked at him and sighed in relief.
“Today we will be brewing one of the most challenging potions that may show up in your OWLS. It is the Binding Potion and when it is applied to any object it permanently glues them together, sometimes in unexpected ways. Can anyone tell me what the dangers are with this potion?”
Pomfrey looked disappointed, as if she wasn’t sure if she should believe him or not. Harry looked down, he didn’t understand what happened, the pain just vanished and he couldn’t explain it.
That’s right folks, Professor Snape, Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter are now stuck together in a three way bond. From what the duo told me in the letter, the bond is an Alpha, Beta, Omega bond and they already know who is connected to which roles. According to Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger’s letter the roles are as follows: The Professor is the Alpha, Mr. Malfoy the Beta and our-boy-who-lived is the omega. That’s right folks. The boy who has been saying that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back and that he even battled him, is an Omega.
The Slytherins were not impressed with the paper, Professor Snape had already told them all the truth during a meeting a few nights ago, so they knew that Potter was now one of them and that what was written was mostly the Gryffindor Duo trying to get people against Potter. Unfortunately it seemed to be working.
The amount of potion we have in our system may also cause issues further down the line, somehow you got some in your blood stream while Malfoy swallowed some and I only got some on my skin. We are unsure what these issues will be so keep aware of yourself and let me or Madame Pomfrey know.
“No one ever believes me, and since it was all healed by the time I was set to go back to detention I had nothing to prove that I was telling the truth. I had to have proof or none of you would believe me, even with proof you don’t always believe me…”
Harry blushed red and just kept his head down to his notes while Snape was semi smirking at him.
“Professor, why is it I lost points for trying to put a stop to the bullying while Ravenclaw barely got in trouble even though they had a warning?”
Last week, a potions accident happened in the Slytherin/Gryffindor 5
“Gay! You can’t be gay! You wanted to date Cho remember? And being Gay is an awful thing! I can’t believe you Harry! Don’t talk to me again until this so-called bond stops messing with your head.”
Snape had blocked the feelings again not wanting to feel the sadness that Harry was previously feeling when he explained about the book list. He ignored the feelings that changed in Harry and so missed the fear that was currently being let loose.
Harry took deep breaths. Trying to calm his temper again so that he could continue to explain what Snape needed to know.
“I’ll take the one with the Gryffindor if you want. Lavender is usually just a gossip queen but she doesn’t tend to cause trouble herself… Besides, I don’t know the Slytherin that’s left and you’ll probably do better with him than me.”
“They left. I hope they’re ok.”
’ make sure to prolong the
~parseltongue~
Malfoy just looked at Harry and nodded trying to understand how it would feel but not really being able to. It’s the first time he tried to see things from Potter’s point of view when Snape got like that with him and he didn’t like what he was seeing. Snape didn’t even try to understand why Harry would feel like that or why it might be an issue. This just wasn’t right, was it?
Meanwhile Snape sat beside Draco and just looked at him sadly.
“Leech Juice, sir. It uses the leech anti-coagulant and reverses the effects, but if too much is used the potion can become uncontrollable and may even explode causing other outcomes depending on the stage of the potion.”
Harry spoke quietly, hoping that they believe him and that they don’t think he’s in detention for any real reasons.
Snape sneered at him.
At that point Professor Snape made himself known. He was proud of Draco’s response to the circumstances, and considering everything tried to understand Potter’s state of mind.
Harry.
Madame Umbridge looked over at Malfoy then at Potter and just sighed. She knew that she couldn’t use the blood quill with any witnesses there to report her and a Malfoy was just the kind of person she knew would be able to get her fired.
Harry sighed a little, thinking his dream of a family is now ruined. He knew that men could become pregnant but it was still a rare occurrence and he didn’t even know if he was gay so it never really concerned him. ‘
“I’m sorry we forgot to leave a note for you professor, I was running late and sort of rushed Draco to get to detention on time. This detention has been going on since the first class with Umbridge. She didn’t like that I didn’t agree with her about how I’ve been lying about Voldemort being back. So she gave me detention to keep going until she decides I learned my lesson. Although she did change it to once a week now that you or Draco have to come with me.”
Now, do you have any questions?”
Meanwhile, Harry calmed himself down and realized that now that he is out of the hospital wing and is doing ‘better’ that Umbridge will expect him to show back up for his detentions. Only problem is that he still couldn’t get very far from his bondmates and so one of them would have to come with him if only to wait outside the room. He knew they wouldn’t like that. But what other choice did he have? There was no way Umbridge would let him off the hook.

As always any comments and feedback is appreciated!
This is just one example of what this potion can do. If you want more examples please turn to page 3 where we have a page full of different cases of the potion being misused.
“What happened? I’ve never known you to fake injury before Mr. Potter.”
Back in the bedroom Snape slowly sat down on the bed beside Draco and shook his shoulder gently.
*Flashbacks*
He was just finishing up when the outside door opened and Draco came in looking half angry and half unsure. Then the other door opened and Snape came out with his nose in the air as if trying to figure out where the smell came from.
“He fainted Severus, people don’t faint from imaginary pain.”
All comments appreciated!!
Walking into the kitchen he checked to see what he could make and noticed that the place was pretty much empty. He decided he wanted to make his special steak tacos so called for an elf and asked for all the ingredients he would need.
in both words, and the wand movement is a strong swirl and a strong flick like this.” And so the Professor went on to demonstrate the spell to the class and discuss a few more details before letting them try the spell themselves.

“What are you boys doing?”
Harry glared at her.
I heard that the news of my new situation didn’t go well. I was hoping you would come talk to me while I’m still stuck in the infirmary. Especially since there is much I need to tell you about this bond I’m stuck in. At the moment I have to have Malfoy or Snape nearby or I get this extreme pain in my chest. We all hope that this is temporary and that the bond will settle enough for me to be on my own soon, but so far they have to stay within shouting distance.
