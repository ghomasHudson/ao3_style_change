Did Weasley have a death wish or something?
“I do, however, know how I felt when I was with him though.” Draco carried on. “I felt free. As if all my problems just dissolved when I was with him. I felt strong, not weak. I felt accepted, cared about. I felt needed. As if he needed me as much as I needed him.” he said. “I still need him.” Draco admitted.
They followed him
But of course, Blaise had questions.
“Well, my mummy says your daddy is a Death Eater.” One of the girls cried and Draco couldn’t help but realise that she looked a bit like a pig.
So, he sat down next to her, with the intent on bringing a smile to her face. “What ever is the matter?” he asked, his voice laced with concern.
Draco sighed. Personally, he thought assigned partners were stupid, but what did he know?
“Not so good.” Weasley answered. “He’s a mess.” he gave Draco a sad smile.
The Death Eater chuckled, “Oh, I don’t think so. This little bitch is going to get exactly what she deserves.” He raised his wand and Draco was sure that he was about to attack.
Potter continued, “as I said, I went to see your father today. He gave me the last push I needed, the last piece of strength that would allow me to do this.” With shaking hands Potter let go of Draco’s hand, pulling out a ring that hung silently from his own neck.
“Ginevra Molly Weasley!” Mrs Weasley huffed. “I’ve taught you better than that.” She said pointedly.
Draco growled. “Ha bloody ha very funny.” He quipped, but it wasn't funny. No, it wasn't funny at all
After what seemed like a lifetime, they finally landed roughly just outside the room. Draco didn’t even have time to gather his bearings before someone shouted ‘Stupefy!’ and his whole world went black.
He looked at Severus pointedly, “And that is?” If he thought about it, messing with old Severus was actually quite fun. A much more efficient way to spend his time then the moping he had calendered in for the day.
And Mrs Weasley had pulled him in for a bear crushing hug, then commented on how thin he was, before finally gifting him with a green woollen jumper with a silver D stitched onto the front. If Draco teared up a little bit, then that wasn’t anybody’s business.
“Perhaps, I’ve had enough of good people.” She contemplated.
Draco sighed. “Well, why do
Pansy tutted. “I
Blaise nodded his head in agreement. “You’ve killed us Draco. You’ve absolutely killed us.” He teased.
Potter growls picking up his neglected cock, giving it a couple of long, firm strokes. “Come for me.” He demands and Draco cries out, coming in long, desperate spurts, drenching them both with his juices.
The ring pulsed.
Broken, he collapsed onto the floor and was quickly engulfed into the tight heat of Hermione’s arms. He started to sob, big, painful tears were running down his cheeks, showing no sign of stopping.
He was quite embarrassed actually, he wanted to find Potter, not to hand him over to the Dark Lord, but to make sure that he was safe. He knew it was pathetic, he didn’t need anyone to tell him that. He just had to do it. He couldn’t explain why.
“Why didn’t you come back straight away?” he accused lightly.
“And why won’t you?”
“They were saying mean things about you, so now I avoid them.”
Granger narrowed her eyes at him. “So why are you so interested in where I decided to do my homework?” she lifted her chin up giving him a dubious look.
She sighed, “are you sure?” Was he sure? Was
Today was a day he’d always known was coming but didn’t quite want to believe to be true. He had been living in denial. Well, not anymore. The biggest battle to ever grace the wizarding world was presumably happening at Hogwarts, and Draco was stuck at the Manor.
Draco wasn’t giving that up for anything.
The Dark Lord sat on his couches, he ate his food, he breathed the same air as him. Draco wanted to puke; the air was like poison.
Draco glared at her. “I said no before and I’m saying no now. In fact, I’ll continue to say no till the end of time.” He answered simply, and her face fell.
His pride was misunderstood. His loyalty a product of fear. His ambitions were his fathers. Draco was nothing but a fake. A fraud. A puppet. His decisions never fully being ones of his own making.
He looked around at the action, no one seemed to have noticed him which was a good sign. He also observed that as far as he could see, there wasn’t any dead bodies. There most definitely could be an abundance of bodies somewhere else in the castle, he prayed that wasn’t the case. But it appeared as though most of the action was happening in the foyer where he stood, so he determined the chances to be quite low.
to be kidding him. He was done. He was so, so done. “So, you can speak to her. But can ignore me for three fucking hours!” he exclaimed in frustration.
Draco shrugged. “I know a lot about a lot of things.” He answered cryptically.
The last nineteen years had been absolutely perfect. Harry and himself had married straight after graduating from Hogwarts, not wanting to wait a moment more. Many had thought them mad, being nineteen and engaged was one thing. But being married… well, let’s just say that he didn’t want to relive the moment his father had found out about the wedding.
It seemed ever so fitting for a man of his capability.
“I kissed him. I kissed him.” Draco said again, tears streaming down his cheeks. He wanted the world to swallow him whole. He didn't want to do this anymore. He
His father visibly paled. “Draco.” He hissed almost pleadingly. “He could be listening, you insolent child. Do you want to die?”
It was also all so insensitive of him. They’d all just fought a war, and instead of worrying about that or helping others move on. He had ostracised himself from society, in the hopes of spending all his days thinking about Potter. He was truly pathetic.
. He couldn’t simply just walk away, for they’d be trailing right behind him. It was infuriating.
Potter shook his head, clasping Draco’s hand with him. “No, I think that it’s an amazing idea. There’s no one I’d rather spend my time with.” He said solemnly. “Please say you’ll come.” He pleaded.
His aunt laughed manically, “is poor likkle Draco looking for his precious Potter? You’ve been a bad, bad boy.” She reprimanded, pointing her wand him in a threatening stance.
“I said no.” Draco huffed defiantly, he'd made his decision.
She shrugged. “I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?” she urged him.
It was all Draco wanted to hear but all that he knew he couldn't have. He'd denied himself so much. Why this? Why this too?
Coward. A word thrown around so lightly, many not truly understanding it's meaning. Potter wasn't a coward. He was far from it. No, he was one of the bravest people that Draco knew.
His mother narrowed her eyes at him. “I
Draco edged closer towards his father’s cell as his father grabbed his hands through the bars, pulling him closer so that their foreheads were touching. “If what you and Potter have is even half of what your mother and I have, then Potter will come back to you. I promise.” He assured him, and for the first time Draco felt convinced.
A gasp! That was a good sign. He took this as confirmation to carry on. “How do you truly know what good and bad really is. What if there’s no good or bad? What if there’s only grey?” he asked.
She shook her head. “If you think I’m going to tell you that, then you’re absolutely barmy.” She said.
make me happy.” He told her truthfully, the words no longer feeling like a poison on his tongue. No, they tasted like salvation.
She gave him the ‘
Potter gave Draco a long kiss before rising to his feet. “You’re adorable.” He smirked and Draco frowned. “Anyways, lets head up to Dumbledore’s floo or else we’re going to be late.”
It also didn’t help that ever since last night, Potter had been following him everywhere.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco chuckled. “I’ll try my hardest not to die in the near future.” he joked but when he saw the looks on their faces, he realised that he was being utterly serious.
Draxo know Weasley's middle name. Has his Potter obsession been a Weasley obsession all along? He wouldn't be all that surprised by that. After all, gingers were the new brunets.
“I’m not—”
He raised a brow. “And I will not be treated like a puppet.” He glared defiantly at his father. “Oops.” He mocked. “It appears I already am.” He snarled, satisfied with his defiance.
“Sorry mum.” He muttered sheepishly.
He pushed his wand harder into Draco’s neck, “that’s not the point.” He huffed out. “Was it
help, it was no where to be found. Maybe he was just unconventionally unlucky? Yes, that made sense.
Draco stared at her in bafflement. “What do you mean?” he questioned intently.
Draco gave him a small nod before sitting next to him and opening up his sketchbook. Potter didn’t speak like he normally did, instead he looked out onto the lake as if deep in thought. Draco was itching to ask him why the hell he was so quiet, but he decided against it. He reasoned that he didn’t much like Potter, so he shouldn’t care.
“Katerina is that you?” His father asked and Draco concluded that he’d finally let go of the speaker. He felt the same emotion filled tears that threatened to spill whenever he heard his daughter’s name.
But deep down, deep, deep down, he knew that he already had.
“That doesn’t make any sense.” Draco sighed dramatically.
to get to know them as well.
He decided that time could pass. People could leave. Memories could be forgotten. But feelings, those were something that the heart could
Severus turned a shade of green that even Salazar Slytherin would be jealous of. “You stupid, insolent, little cretin. Do you think this is a joke?” He shouted.
Liars!
Draco reasoned that he quite liked his limps intact. Every, last one of them
Pansy brought him in for a third embrace. “Okay, okay darling. You need him. I get it. I really do.” She muttered softly.
Hermione came up from behind him, bringing him into a soft embrace. She felt warm and comforting. She smelt like fire and parchment. Things that reminded him of home. Something that Draco had always been. He didn’t have that anymore.
Pansy chuckled, “Yeah, if you’re not a softie then I’m an ugly, dirty, old pig. Oink!” she mocked.
Everyone was looking at him as he passed. He supposed that it was to be expected, no one had seen him since his trial. He didn’t so much mind the looks of love or admiration, he even didn’t mind the odd glare that he would receive. But, what he did mind,
“So, they’re stupid?” she asked innocently.
Draco Lucius Malfoy. Cause of death: suffocation by rubble, aided by a hyena’s screech. Draco mused, he had to admit, it had a nice ring to it. Much better than the AK he was sure to get after he failed to carry out the Dark Lord’s impossible biddings.
“You can’t picture it, can you?” she stated. If he weren’t so concerned about how right she was, he would’ve agreed that he couldn’t picture a thing. “Try it again, but this time, let go of your fear.” She instructed softly.
“Malfoy.” A hesitant voice spoke and Draco cursed whatever god had put him in this position.
He laughed, “don’t get cheeky with me.” He shot her a sincere look, “I absolutely love them. They’re the best gifts that I’ve ever received.” he said honestly, too shocked to say much more.
“He knows the answer to that question.” Potter gestured towards Draco, “don’t you Malfoy?” he asked condescendingly.
Great, just great. And to think Draco wasn't already in enough trouble. What's a little more?
He found Crabbe and Goyle, both almost surrounded by fire. “Follow me.” He urged as he started to climb up a tall stack of furniture. He had no idea as to what he was doing, he was pretty sure that the mound wouldn’t hold. He just prayed that the fire wouldn’t reach them.
He understood her. He understood her so much that it physically hurt.
Draco almost let out a sob of his own, before ignoring the crowd that had gathered around them and made his way towards his own dorm.
Mrs Weasley’s cooking skills had not been exaggerated by Potter. Draco felt as if he could never eat again. He didn’t even want to eat again. Unless, it was Mrs Weasley’s cooking.
finding himself?
He blamed Potter. Stupid Potter with his stupid glasses and his stupid scar and his stupid, stupid fat dick. Distracting Draco like that. How so very rude!
forget.
? She just had to be messing with him. They really weren't anything special. Just a few sketches here and there. They mostly reflected his mood more than anything else.
Draco shook his head. “No” he choked out, a single tear running down his cheek.
Draco eyes widened in alarm, “my father?” he questioned in complete bafflement, “but why would you—
So, Draco done the only thing he could do. He’d made the only choice that he could’ve made. He’d held out his hand. One that his father had taken as Draco pulled him into a strong embrace. He didn’t know how long they’d stayed like that, tangled in one another, but he’d found that he couldn’t bring himself to care.
His gaze settled on his husband, who still looked as gorgeous as he had all those years ago. Much had happened during these past few years, Draco had become a potions master, Harry had become an Auror, they’d been given the gift of their children. They’d bickered, fought, smiled, and laughed. But the one thing that had never changed, the
“Anyways how are
“Well, wouldn’t that be nice.” He sneered.
Potter was already at the lake when he arrived.
“Mad. They’re all mad.” Weasley commented in amusement giving Draco a small simile.
Tears started to fall freely from his eyes. “I thought you were dead. We were all told to prepare for the worst. I’ve never been more afraid.” She babbled.
“Well…
“Draco.” His father hissed and he turned to face him. “Would you care to tell me what exactly overcame Potter and yourself earlier today?” he enquired.
“Very good, very good. Now if you don’t mind I’m tired and would like to put my feet up.” He said quickly before sidestepping Macmillan and entering the Slytherin common room.
“But Draco—”
The rest of the week had gone by faster than the Dark Lord had rose from the dead.
Her eyes widened when she saw him and Draco bit back a shudder. She’d probably recognised who he was. How couldn’t she have? The Malfoy hair was a signature trait.
Potter growled. “Answer me, you coward!” he demanded, holding his wand up in threat.
“Everybody calls it drawing, Draco.” Kat spat out through puffs of laughter.
Draco was surprised to find that he’d started to laugh. And not your average little laugh. No. his laugh was as big as a Hippogriff.
Potter was looking at him the way a lover looked at a lover, and they were anything but lovers.
“Like us?” he questioned in pure bafflement.
Potter let out a frustrated breath, “I know you can’t remember, but I don’t care. I’ll never care. I love you to much to care. None of it matters. Nothing matters, the only thing that matter is that I have you.” He admitted as he attempted to take Draco’s hand in his.
He opened his mouth to speak but she cut him off again. “Close your eyes,” she directed, and he did, albeit hesitantly.
“Helping him how?” Severus asked sceptically.
Wait, hold on. It looked a bit like…
He started to formulate his plan quickly in his head. He needed to find eighteen objects, preferably disposable ones. And he needed to find them quickly.
“Malfoy!” the voice yelled again, louder, and angrier this time. Draco continued to go on his merry little way.
Potter gave him a quick peck on the lips. “Was last night okay?” he asked shyly and Draco wholeheartedly couldn't put into words how good it had been.
Macmillan sighed, “exactly that. What you said all those months ago really got to me. I realised that I was following Smith around like a lacky. It was stupid.” He admitted, and now that was a truth that he didn't mind hearing.
Theo laughed, “Then I guess that I’ll have to take them under my wing as well. Because I
Son of a bitch. If anyone dared to tell Draco that this manipulative, cunning, old bag wasn’t a proper Slytherin, then they could quite literally suck his dick. Unless they were Theo, he did NOT want him to suck his dick anytime soon.
She gave him a toothy smile. “Do you like it?” she asked hopefully.
Disrespect? Did his father honestly believe that he deserved to be respected at the moment. He could not for the life of him understand the whole show nothing but respect for your elders thing. If someone continued to show him disrespect, he wouldn't tske it lying down. Not anymore.
“There is no us.” he told him simply absently aware that he was an actual savage.
She hit her head for a final down before slamming it down ono the table. “I thought I’d at least preserve some of my dignity and kill myself, instead of letting you dreadful excuses kill me first.”
He wanted it to stop. He wanted it all to end. But he couldn’t stop. He wouldn’t stop. He had to save Hermione. He had to protect her. To keep her safe. He bore it, so she didn’t have to.
“I don’t want to be strong anymore. I’m tired. I’m so, so tired.” He breathed out defeatedly. “I’m tired of the voice in my head telling me to do awful things. I’m tired of pretending to be someone that I’m not. I’m tired of staying strong. I’m tired of fighting. I don’t want to fight anymore.” He declared; his voice laced in pain.
Draco saw the familiar orange of Weasley’s head as they made it outside the potions classroom. He shot Weasley a nod before crouching down so that he was the same height as Kat.
Weasley gave out a sigh of disinterest. “It’s as good as a potion gets, I guess.” he commented.
Suddenly, Potter jumped from Hagrid’s arms, a defiant glint residing in his eyes. Draco gasped, overwhelmed with feeling. But it was… impossible. It couldn’t be true. He must be seeing things. He blinked a few times. No, Potter was still there, as alive as he’d been when he’d last saw him.
He knew one of his tells! He fucking
“Draco!” the voice shouted again and he continued to ignore it.
So that’s how she wanted to play it? Well, Draco wouldn’t stand for such disrespect in his own home. “My excuses are anything but dreadful.” He spat.
“Are you okay?” he asked.
Draco nodded. “Muggleborn’s” he informed her.
Draco gave him a confused look. “What the hell is that?” he bit out, giving the contraption a once over, shivering slightly.
The bloody nerve of him! Did he really think that he could sit there in his dingy little prison cell and still tell Draco what to do. It was completely preposterous.
Not that Draco minded all that much, he would never admit it, but he loved his little Hufflepuff’s. They were tiny miniature versions of the child he should have been, of what he now hopes to be.
Blaise snorted. “Your bitterness wounds me Draco.” He joked. “My optimism is leaking out.” He howled, clutching his heart as if in pain.
He gulped, because deep, deep down he knew that he couldn’t promise her that.
“I just want to be his friend.” He whispered.
“Yes, but why—”
Draco tried and failed not to think about Potter. He was still half convinced that it had all been an elaborate scheme to break him. Well if that’s what he was going for, then Potter had done a tremendous job. Draco was utterly broken.
You could see why Draco would be concerned about this particular qualm.
They lapsed into another round of silence. Draco decided that he still didn’t like Potter very much. In fact, he didn’t like him at all. But that was okay, he was certain that Potter didn’t like him very much either.
Draco knew he was weak. He knew that he shouldn’t forgive Potter. That he should walk away right now and not look back.
Oh she did
He raised a brow, “Would you care to test that theory?” he challenged her, and they all burst into a fit of laughter.
“Malfoy.” A strong confident voice said from behind him.
He gave her a rare smile, “but you
“Yes, yes. I get it. But all I’m hearing is that I was beyond awesome but still got dumped with you dramatic gits as friends.” He brushed them off.
Her eyes widened with determination. “I’m not stupid Draco. I know that it will take a lot longer for you to be as happy as I am.” If his emotions were anything to go by, then he was sure that it would take a lifetime to be as happy as she was.
Touchy. Touchy. Touchy. Here he was trying to make amicable conversation with his godfather, and he was acting as if Draco had been the one to start the blooming conversation in the first place.
He brought Draco in for a bone crushing hug, “Oh So Dark One!” he cried, sobbing into Draco’s hair, which he didn’t find particularly amusing. “You saved me.” He whispered quietly.
Draco smiled as he glanced in the direction of his friends, of his husband, of his
Because by doing that. By acting as if everything was going to be okay, he'd given himself hope. He'd become ignorant to the consequences of his actions, he'd been made vulnerable. And that was dangerous.
Kat nodded enthusiastically. “Of course, I do.” Well, he couldn't very much argue with that now, could he?
His breath hitched as he became fixated on the spot where he’d killed Bellatrix. He had actually
Draco chuckled. “As great as this all is, I think you guys better go back to your classes before you give Slughorn a heart attack.” He mused, gesturing to a quite green Slughorn.
what I’m talking about.” He accused.
He eyed him sceptically. “So, let’s say that I hypothetically believed you, why should I trust you?” he questioned, and Draco could tell the moment that he new that he had Nathan on side.
Theo took a step closer towards him, “I had a really good time today.” He said shyly, his face close to Draco’s.
Malfoy. Why are you doing this to me? Why are you making me feel so much? I can’t stand it, just make it stop. Please make it stop.” he almost begged.
After the ‘Potter escaped from the Manor because of Draco incident’, the Dark Lord had determined Draco’s loyalty to be somewhat expendable. As if that wasn’t obvious. Draco was friends with Hufflepuff's, for fucks sake! What part of that didn’t scream: fuck you! You noseless bastard?
Weasley and Hermione had took the stand proudly, both testifying in favour of Draco. They claimed that even though Draco had unwillingly let Death Eater’s into Hogwarts, he’d made portkey’s for not only all the at risk muggleborns, but for themselves and Potter so that they could escape. Hermione had even gone as far as to disclose the events that had happened at the manor and how Draco had protected her by taking the crucio curse himself. They had both concluded stating that he was one of their closest friends and life in Azkaban would be an inhumane charge for someone who had saved so many.
Potter stared at Draco intently, “Tell me.” He started. “Tell me what to do. Stop ignoring me and talk to me for Merlin’s sake.” He pleaded.
He responded with silence.
The Weaselette looked like a beauty project gone terribly, terribly wrong. Had no one ever told her that less was more? What did Potter see in her?
His father let out a simply sigh, “nothing of importance. I just came to ask if you were feeling alright.” He offered and Draco’s heart stopped.
“We have a question.” Weasley one started with a mischievous glint in his eye.
take Slytherin out of the boy.
“Why the sudden change?” he asked with genuine interest.
He missed Kat like mad. It was as if a part of his soul was lost and there was no hope of recovering it. But she’d had to leave. He had to keep her safe. In fact, none of the Muggleborn’s had returned to Hogwarts this year. He’d made sure of that.
He sets a rhythmic pace, perched in Potter’s lap, grinding away on his cock. He absently wonder’s if he could make Potter come like this. He groans at the thought. Potter’s eyes start to lose focus, his breath catching in his throat, as he lets out a deep moan deep from within his chest.
How was he supposed to help if he couldn't even come to terms with his own feelings?
Blaise took a deep breath. “You scared us both half to death.” He tried to appear calm, but Draco could see right through him.
“I’m sorry.” Potter said after several minutes.
Was it really that hard to believe? Spiders were killing blood thirsty little cretins; they’d kill you without a second thought. “It was a big one.” Draco offered sheepishly.
He nodded, before turning on his heel running through the mass of people. He felt all eyes on him, but he didn’t care. He needed to find Potter.
Okay, okay, he saw how they wanted to play it. If they wanted to act ignorant, then Draco would
Hermione’s quill dropped onto the table; her mouth slightly agape. “A chicken specialist!” She bellowed, which earnt her a telling off from Madam Pince.
As soon as he got back to the manor, he felt tears start to form in the crests of his eyes. He was tired, he was so, so tired, and it was only midday.
Draco felt his eyes well with fresh tears. “But she’ll be safe with me. I know she will be.” He attempted to persuade them, to make them understand.
He glanced down at his pale arm; his mistake was staring accusingly back at him. If he thought he was something before, with this brand on his arm; he was virtually nothing.
How rude. As good as a potion gets. Did he have any idea how breathtakingly flawless their potions was. Idiot. The lot of them were. Gryffindor's. Well, except Hermione. But she was different.
“Open it and find out.” She squealed.
Draco chuckled. “I’m as well as a guy that almost bled to death can be I suppose.” He joked. Seriously? What was
He shook his head. “No, I need chicken.” He corrected. “Do you think that the kitchen’s are still open?” he asked.
“I think you’re brave.” A second girl pointed out and Draco blinked at her. “To love someone besides their faults is very courageous.” She said dreamily.
Draco raised a dreaded brow in acknowledgement. “Will you go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend?” he choked out.
Technically Potter did come into the problem, but he was far from the most pressing matter.
Draco took a deep breath, this was it. There was no going back, not now, not ever. “They’re letters… that I wrote… for you.” He choked out anxiously. “Read them. They bare all. The good. The bad. The ugly. Everything that I am is in those letters.” He looked up at Potter intently, “and if you still want to be with me once you’ve read them, then yes. My answer is yes.” He said, finally giving himself to Potter.
Draco suddenly felt extremely uncomfortable. He was selfish. Potter had cancelled his plans, missed out on spending time with his family, just so that Draco didn’t spend Christmas alone. He’d even gone as far as to accept the Weasley’s invitation for Christmas, when Draco had been too afraid to.
He hated him with every fibre of his being. But instead of hating him because he was a half-blood scumbag that had rejected his attempt of friendship. He hated him because he was overly dramatic. He thought of himself as terribly hard done by. He hated him because he was impulsive, arrogant. A small-minded fool that thought he had the worst luck in the world.
The room was spinning, his head was pulsing. The blood running through his veins was cold as ice, the magic thrumming through his core stilled. He’d never felt anything like it, it was as if all his strength, all his magic, was slowly leaving his body.
“Is that any way to talk to the guy who just saved your life.” He folded his arms, raising an eyebrow.
“Are you feeling alright, Draco?” Theo asked and Draco nodded. Things were still a bit uncomfortable between them, but he knew that despite everything, they’d always remain friends.
“You don’t?” he challenged, with a hint of wonder.
Draco gulped. He had to do this, he had to push her away. He had no choice. He had to protect her, he loved her. And love was weakness.
She sighed. “It’s Ron.” She mumbled, and Draco should have known.
There was nothing. He tried to imagine the future that he wanted, but the truth was, he didn’t know what he wanted. He had no idea.
Draco glared at him. “Shut up Blaise.” He hissed.
She smiled at him reassuringly, “But if you’re willing, I’d like to find out.” She said softly.
“Or do you?” they both raised an eyebrow and Draco turned a very deep shade of burgundy.
His father’s trial had gone better than he’d expected. Draco was certain that his positive publicity had resulted in the outcome. His father had been sentenced to a year in Azkaban as well as been forced to pay a large sum of reparations. His father had been less than happy, but Draco was ecstatic. His father would be free in a year and the reparations had hardly put a dent in the Malfoy fortune.
have been killed if I hadn’t spotted you!”
Potter coughed. “Why thank you Harry, you’re the sweetest, most wonderful person that I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.” Draco frowned, because he
Well, lets just say that he'd never wish that feeling on anyone.
Couldn’t Theo catch a hint? Draco couldn’t go out with him. He couldn’t go out with anyone; he didn’t deserve it. Death Eater’s didn’t deserve nice things.
Potter snatched Draco’s wand from his hand, “Come on Draco, we have to leave.” He stated gesturing Draco to follow.
He blushed. “I know, now let’s go.” He urged quickly, pulling Draco to his feet.
Draco sighed dramatically, “Fine Weasley, you win. I’m free on Thursday. Meet me outside the potions classroom at seven, not a moment before or after. Am I clear?”
Draco glared at her, “you’re going to kill me. Your poor judge of character and absmayl reasoning is actually going to kill me. Cause of death: idiotic imbeciles.” He snarled.
Chicken... Weasley had gifted him chicken for Christmas. Well, it was unique. He'd give him that.
. A treacherous part of Draco supplied and he felt himself start to fall apart.
“Please.” He begged looking at her straight in the eyes. “Make it stop.”
The Weasley shrugged, “let’s just say news travels fast.” He laughed, “plus, Harry has always been bollocks at covering up his feelings.”
Draco felt suddenly on edge. It had been weeks since he’d last heard from him mother. With shaky hands, he reached out and pulled the letter from her beak, only stopping to give her a scratch behind her ears.
“Did the wrackspurts tell you that too?”
Why wasn't it working? Why wasn't he waking up?
“Ooo Draco’s got a boyfriend. Draco’s got a boyfriend.” The Hufflepuff’s chanted childishly, their little faces gleaming with glee.
The Great Hall was as magical as ever. He looked around at the tables full of students, examining all their faces. There was an abundance of emotions. Some were happy, some were tired, some were relived. But no one. Not one face looked vengeful. That was something that brought a small smile to his face.
Draco extended a hand which she took with her free one, “it’s very nice to meet you.” He said politely.
“But you don’t take Muggle studies.” Jerry remarked and Draco hated the law that said you couldn’t castrate children. Very inconvenient, that was.
Draco nodded, because he couldn’t argue with that. “What do you expect me to do about it?” he offered.
“What?”
They watched the sunrise together.
“My problem?” he bit out incredulously. “My problem is that you refuse to fucking talk to me like a human being.” He snapped.
He could've had everything with Theo. The person that treated him with kindness and love, something that Draco so desperately wanted. But instead he'd thrown it all away. For Potter. Why was it Potter. Why had it
That wasn't exactly a lie. Kind? Most definitely. Brave? Ha! No chance in hell.
Hermione started to scream yet again. Her eyes puffy, her nose running, her body bloody and bruised. Draco felt sick. He needed to stop this. He needed to stop this Now.
His aunt licked a long strip of his face, saliva now dripping from his chin. “You taste of fear.” She murmured. “You shouldn’t be scared, sweet Draco. I’m not going to hurt you. I helped you.” She stated simply.
She cackled. “I’ve always known you were weak. A small, terrified likkle baby. That’s all you’ve ever been.” She started; her crazed filled eyes boring into his own. “I knew that you’d never go through with the task that our Great Lord had so graciously set you.”
Potter let out a scoff. “Oh, so
There was a soft rustle from behind the pillar, but the thing, person or object in question remained hidden.
Draco gave him a small smile in return, “now that’s something I could get on board with.” He quipped before returning back to the potion.
He shook his head, “Not particularly. I was just wondering as to why you’re sitting here, especially when there’s lots of other free tables.” he gestured to the tables around them, not quite sure as to Granger wanted to sit with him of all people.
“Something like that.” Weasley said and Draco growled.
He felt cheated. Used. Unloved. He’d done this for his father. Scarred himself for his father. Lost his innocence for his father.
“Oh, it is,” he replied. “When it’s all done. When it’s all over, the first thing I’m going to do is travel. Just because I can.” He said enthusiastically. The
He was going on a date for Merlin’s sake! The same wasn’t bloody well good enough.
An innocent girl had gotten hurt, Madam Rosmerta would perhaps never forgive him, his innocence was lost, and for what? The old crow was still alive and kicking and the Boy Who Lived to obsessively stalk Draco Malfoy still hadn’t gotten the hint and backed off.
Draco shook his head. “Is there anything I can do?” he asked genuinely.
You see, he didn't understand why Healers would always ask him that question. What was he meant to say? I'm not feeling sick at all, in fact, I've been freely deposited here, is it alright if I leave? It was just stupid.
He listened to Potter Watch every day. It was foolish of him, he knew that. But he couldn’t help it. He had to know if everything was okay. If Weasley and Hermione was okay. If Potter was okay…
He took a deep breath, praying that Merlin would give him the strength that he knew he so desperately needed. “Father?” he questioned calmly, waiting for a response. The mobile remained silent.
“Well, since Potter acted like a bloody lunatic, making your relationship appear to be anything but platonic.” He started and Draco cringed. “Then yeah, it is my business.” He finished.
Again, it wasn't any of his business, Draco told the truth anyways. “To meet Weasley, we have a potions project to finish.” He answered.
He cared. Potter really cared! Knowing that gave Draco the last piece of strength that he needed. He opened the box, taking out the letters, and holding them out to Potter with shaky hands.
He sighed light-heartedly. “Well, I was going to wait to give you this until the last day of school.” He started, “but since you’ve already gifted me your amazing present, it seems only fair.” He finished handing her the present.
“It was us who asked you to stay away from him in the first place. If we’d known that it would have made him act like this, then we would never have suggested it.” he deduced.
shed an abundance of tears, or Merlin help me, I’ll rise from the dead and strangle your brains out.” He threatened.
A bunch of innocent first years who were most probably ignorant to the possibility of real loss, and to hear that someone they questionably looked up to, that they cared about had been perhaps fatally hurt, well... Draco didn't want to think about how that must've felt.
Draco’s heart sunk. This could only mean one thing. His Father.
The Headmaster opened his moth to speak but was immediately silenced by Potter’s growl. “You know what? I’m done with your fucking shit.” He announced stepping away from the Gryffindor table, “have fun fighting Voldemort without me, because I’m done.” He added with finality, the Dark Lord’s name sent shivers down Draco’s spine.
So instead of buying only several presents for the seven people that mattered in his life, NO Draco had brought a sickening thirty-two presents!
She beamed pulling him into a large hug. “Are you happy now Draco?” she asked.
“Just wouldn’t it.” Draco said a little to honestly and Potter gave him an odd glance which he promptly ignored.
? He pondered lightly. He could— no, he couldn’t do that, it was too risky. But maybe it would work if— no, no, NO! It couldn’t possibly work. Draco groaned; he was being stupid. It would never work. He flopped down onto his bed in defeat, feeling sorry for himself in every possible way.
“I knew it.” she said gently. “that’s okay.” She carried on.
looked like a crazy person.
“Then what’s wrong?” he questioned intently, taking her hands in his in an attempt to make her feel safer than she obviously felt.
It was quiet. It was all so quiet; you couldn’t even hear a pin drop. The air was dusty, filled with a thick layer of melancholy. Draco had never truly understood what it meant to see everything in grey, he couldn’t comprehend how one could cease to see colour. He understood now. He wished that he didn’t, but he did.
“Draco.” Came his mother’s concerned voice, and he realised that he had ended up in one of the manor’s many parlour’s. “Come here Dragon.” She urged gently, opening her arms wide in welcome.
Macmillan fired another hex and glared, “Shut up.” He growled.
“You have to do it Draco.” Pansy said soothingly, rubbing circles on his back.
He nodded. “Of course, I will. Why are you crying?” he asked wiping away her tears.
Draco lifted his chin up proudly, “the Slytherins are loyal to me.” he tried to act as sure as possible, but it was hard.
He’d taken it all for granted. The way the birds chirped in the sky signalling the beginnings of a new day. How the sky was blue, full of endless possibilities. The green of the grass, the array of colour that the flowers reflected, symbolising all that was beautiful. Now it was different. There were no birds, the sky was clouded, the flowers had lost their beauty; it was grey, it was
It was loud, desperate, and pleading. Draco wanted to drown it out. He wanted to pretend that it wasn’t there. But he couldn’t. He wouldn’t.
“Oh, please do think about this logically Draco. There wasn’t a moment when you didn’t speak about Potter. You even found yourself in the room as soon as his name was mentioned. It was quite obvious that you hated him for a different reason then you let everyone think.” His father boasted.
Alarmed, Draco returned his attention back onto the Hufflepuff's. “Shhh, Shhh.” He started. “Keep it down or Madam Pomfrey will have all of our heads. And I don’t know about any one you, but I really don’t feel like dying for a second time.” he said and internally cringed at his words.
“Have you any idea of just how many lives she’d ruined? Of how many people she’d already killed? Of all the people she had yet to kill?” Neville asked him in a serious tone.
No, but wait. He peered even closer. It was a smirk. He was sure of it. A long, nasty smirk. Well, how rude!
“I don’t have any idea what you’re talking about.” Draco said innocently.
He could understand that. He really could. But that didn't make it hurt any less. He wished it did. He really did.
Well, if he knew that then he would’ve said. What part of ‘I don’t know’ didn’t Potter understand? Draco raked a hand through his messy hair, “I just don’t know. I really don’t know.” He admitted, a hint of hysteria in his tone.
Draco sighed. “That’s what I said. A turny breaky thing.” He stated simply. “You have
Potter looked at him as if Draco were everything to him. No one had ever looked at him like that before. It terrified him that he meant so much to Potter. That someone could be so dependent on another person.
Madam Pomfrey shook her head. “You and your Hufflepuff’s are going to kill me.” She huffed and Draco laughed.
When they’d arrived Hermione and Weasley had pulled him in for a giant hug, that was…nice.
He didn't.
Draco had been having a pretty average dinner in the Great Hall when the Gryffindor table had erupted into a bout of screams and shouts.
“How can you love somebody like that?” he narrowly pointed out.
Theo chuckled. “Were you even listening to me?” he asked, a teasing edged to his tone.
He’d been dreading the day that his father would want to get in touch with him. It’s wasn't so much that he didn’t like his father and didn’t exactly want to see him. It was more an issue that he hated his father at present and couldn’t think of anything worse than seeing him.
For the second night in a row, Draco found himself crossed leg, sketchbook in hand, staring at the vast lake.
Theo nodded. “don’t act dumb with me Draco.”
“May I sit here?” his aunt asked and Draco nodded, gesturing for her to sit. He was only waiting for Mr Weasley and that wonderous blue rubber duck anyways.
“But one day you will be happy again. And I will do everything I possibly can to make sure that I’m the one to make you happy.” she promised him.
He raised up a hand in protest. “Draco.” He stated. “You can call me Draco.” He offered. Might as well get to know his future son-in-law.
Had they started feeding them in Azkaban or something?
Draco didn’t want to think about it. Because deep down he knew that it was true, and if it were, then this was going to become a lot harder than he knew it would be.
“Whenever.”
“Doesn’t look like nothing, you look like death” she bit out. For a ghost, she was oddly immune to the mention of death. It was quite peculiar indeed.
happened with Potter, he just didn’t remember.
Draco glared at his friend, tucking his wand safely back into his pocket. He huffed, “in what part of your twisted mind did you believe that to be a smart way to approach a friend.” He chastised.
“You don’t know if that’s true.”
“Nice to see you again, boy.” Ollivander croaked. Draco smiled at him before handing out the extra food and blankets between him and the other prisoners.
Draco chuckled and Blaise gave him a contemplative look, “No seriously, my hands are a work of art!” he preened proudly and Draco mentally hit his head against the wall. Numerous times.
She scoffed. “Don’t make me laugh Draco. You’re the biggest child here and you know it.” she said. Well, that just had to be the biggest lie that she'd ever told.
Pansy glared at him. “Don’t give me ‘nothing’ Draco Lucius, or I swear I’ll—”
“I know that it probably hurts.” She carried on. “It’s just that Harry’s extremely unstable right now. One of you are going to end up getting seriously hurt if you both carry on like this.” She said mimicking Pansy from just moments before.
sure? That had to be some sort of trick question. Barmy. Absolutely barmy!
He deserved a punishment far worse than death.
“Do you think I don’t know that?” Draco shouted. “Of course, I know that he has my fucking mother. I think about it of every minute of every day.” He didn't want to do this. He didn't want to think about this. Why was Severus doing this? Why was he hurting him so?
Draco gulped. He knew he was being ridiculous. He knew that Theo wasn’t someone that he truly deserved. Theo was loving and kind. Draco was cruel and cold. He didn’t deserve Theo; he wasn’t even one hundred percent sure if he truly wanted Theo.
“Yes. Oh, god. Yes!” Draco screamed.
He sighed. “Who says you can trust anyone?” he started, taking a different approach for the umpteenth time today. “This is war. How do you know that the good isn’t the bad and the bad isn’t the good?” he prodded and she gasped.
Honestly, Draco secretly agreed with her. What in Merlin's name had convinced him to let his best friends on his little task. They were scaring the victims for fuck sake!
Theo turned towards Draco, his features softening. “Would you like that Draco?” he asked with care and Draco nodded. He couldn’t be around Potter, not when he was like this.
was a chicken specialist?
This pained Draco. It really it. He'd always pegged Potter as someone who had it altogether. Despite the odds, he thought him to be a generally calm person.
Weasley nodded. “Of course, I did, Malfoy loves chicken.” He said proudly shoving a piece of chicken it his fat gob.
His pug faced friend rounded on him accusingly, “
Hermione pulled him into a hug. “I’m sorry Draco. I’m so, so sorry.” She sobbed. “But please, just stay away, it’s for your own good.” She warned, before pulling away. Weasley gave him a gentle clap on the back before they walked away.
The boy froze. “Well, erm, I wanted, I mean if it wasn’t any inconvenience to get your blessing.” He spat out frantically.
.” He said, and everyone froze.
Blaise tutted. “Now, now Draco let’s not take extreme measures.” he told him almost condescendingly and Draco was
Draco rolled his eyes. “But of course, you can. You owe me. I mean, you did almost kill me at the beginning of term.” He said matter-of-factly. So maybe he was guilt tripping the little bastard. Who cares? Draco almost
It was all completely unsettling.
“Shushhhh.” His mother whispered softly, “what do I always tell you Draconis Lucius Malfoy?” she asked expectantly.
“Whenever I’m free.” He answered blandly.
conversation yet.
Draco turned a fine shade of red, “Of course Sir, I’ll try to control my Hufflepuff's.” He sent him a small smile before taking his leave.
Hermione gave him a smile. “We’ll see you later Draco.” She promised as she gestured for Weasley to follow her out of the room.
Hogwarts.” He said defiantly, a twinge of pride running through him.
Draco sighed, clutching his want tightly from his robe pocket. “Anyways, I need the names, years, houses, and addresses of each last one of them.” He put simply, hoping that they'd agree with no objections.
Everyone looked at him in fear as his face turned a deep shade of red. “You didn’t bloody help. No, you two made it worse.” He glared at them.
His head was killing him, his limbs were hurting, his chest felt heavy. Had it all been a dream? Was Crabbe still alive?
what to tell her. He’d tell her to stick her little feelings and intuitions somewhere Draco would never find them. Thinking that she could act all warm and comforting, and he would tell her everything.
“I know it does. I know.” She said in deep understanding, grasping his hand.
“Wow. That’s just pathetic Malfoy, after everything?” Draco couldn’t look at him, he couldn’t face him.
Draco looked down at his feet avoiding Potter’s gaze. His heart was beating rapidly within his chest. He was confused. He could understand why Potter was acting like this. What did he want with him?
Theo scoffed. “I really don’t think that Weasley will show up, especially after the stunt that Potter pulled earlier.” he told him.
His nails scratch at Potter’s back. It’s as if he were an addict and Potter was drug. He was lost. Lost in Potter. He screams as Potter traces a slick wet finger along the crack of his arse, skating over his whole. Draco didn’t even remember Potter muttering the charm.
She carried on, “But at the expense of our loved ones. Of our innocence. Of our sanity. So, we ask ourselves, what do we have to celebrate? What do we have to be thankful for?” she took a deep breath, looking at every last one of them intently, before continuing.
Mine. Mine. Mine! Mine to break, mine to open, mine to play with. MINE! He stuck his tongue out in deep concentration as he breached the device.
Draco didn’t know what to say, but luckily Potter spoke for him. “I promised you almost two years ago that this ring held a part of me. That it would be there to watch over you when I couldn’t. That it would care for you when you craved it. That it would protect you when you needed it most. That you would always have a piece of me to love and hold you close.” He stated and Draco’s breath hitched.
He narrowed his eyes at her. Him dramatic? How rude. It was an outrage. A travesty. A bloody catastrophe! So, maybe he liked to flick his hair and flare his robes to make a valid point. It was normal. Dramatic his arsehole. Draco, dramatic? That was laughable.
“Who?”
Kat narrowed her eyes, standing tall. “We know what you did to Draco.” She accused. Oh no. They weren't talking about what he thought they were talking about? Were they?
He shot Pansy one last reassuring smile, received a soft squeeze from Blaise and left the dorm in a swirl of robes.
“You ate that.” Draco interjected and Weasley glared at him.
Well he didn’t really have anything to say to that, did he? So, instead he diverted his gaze onto the ground beneath him.
“Always.” He breathed out.
“I can help. I promise you that I can help. Just tell me what’s wrong and we can figure this out
This wasn't their faults. Not much anyways. They were just trying to do the right thing by their friends, he couldn't fault them for that. He would've done the same.
Tears fell swiftly down his cheeks, as he watched Hagrid pull the broken body of Harry Potter closer. That was his hope. Who he’d been fighting for. Who had his heart. Gone. Harry was gone.
Draco didn’t have that. He had a mother that loved him but smothered him. His mother being too weak to keep him safe. He had a father who said he loved him but beat him. Who had conditioned him to carry out his family duties, ever since he was a young one. He had friends who cared for him but were so entrapped in their own prejudice beliefs to ever go against their families and help him. He had nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. No one to turn to when he needed aid and comfort. He was completely and utterly alone.
” toast crumbs spluttering everywhere.
“Yes, yes. Very interesting.” Weasley cut in, “Now let’s talk about the chicken that I gifted him.” he chirped.
She said encouragingly.
God, you’re so beautiful.” Potter mutters, stroking Draco’s jaw.
She couldn't help him. But he was so tired off the lying, of the deceit, he had to tell someone. He had to
He was just about to follow his husband towards their friends, when he felt a small tug on his hand. Draco looked down and into the fearful eyes of his daughter. He felt his heart clench as he sunk to his knees so he was now facing her.
Potter ducked, shooting a spell right back at him. Draco dove behind a stall.
“Are you in any trouble?” she asked with worry, and he wanted to say no. He so desperately wanted to say no.
It was over.
, for not particularly wanting to speak to Macmillan as of yet.
He’d just arrived after another late-night talk with Potter by the lake. It had been nice. Potter had smiled, Draco had smiled. Potter had laughed, Draco had laughed…. And now he sounded like a sap.
Draco shot him a confused glance. “How do you know about it?” he accused lightly, genuinely intrigued.
He paused, taking in his gesture, before abruptly pinning his arms back down to his sides. Damn it!
will feed any new prisoner’s if I’m not here?” he spat out. “I’m staying.”
like he’s fucking joking?” Pansy snarled at her.
“I’ll help, and I bet if we tell Blaise, he’ll help as well.” she promised him, and it were if everything changed.
“Because I fucking can’t!” Draco bit out loudly.
Y'all, my heart is breaking for Draco. Drarry will get WORSE before it get's any better. But I promise, it will all be worth the angst. Anyways does anyone know of a good Beta?
Pansy glared at him, “oh, shut up about your Hufflepuff's for a second.” She snarled. “you banging on like a wounded puppy isn’t helping anything.”
It. Was. Ugly!
“If that’s all?” Draco half-asked, half-stated.
Potter kissed the line of his jaw, in long haughty sucks, his stubble contradicting with the softness of his mouth. Potter tore off his robe, slipping a hand underneath his shirt, his fingers rough and possessive as they slide over his skin, Potter latches his mouth back onto Draco’s, their tongues colliding in a whirl of heat, feverish and strong, them both battling for dominance.
Draco?” she asked genuinely completely ignoring Weasley’s cries, to which Draco thought was the funniest thing ever.
A heavy hand clamped onto his shoulder, “stop ignoring me Ferret.” Weasley’s growled and Draco sighed.
She smiled knowingly. “Harry is…complicated.” She attempted, “he doesn’t do all that well with change.” She declared. “Also, let’s not forget that you were a complete git to him for six years of his life.” She added.
Begrudgingly, he walked towards the floo, where his father’s face was impatiently staring back at him. His father looked good considering. Except from a few dark circles that hung from under his eyes, he still looked as proud and healthy as Draco had ever seen him.
feels.” He cried out in complete despair.
He sighed a defeated sigh. “Fine, Draco, you was right and I was wrong.” he admitted and Draco preened, because
He looked at her confused, and she raised an eyebrow up in defiance. “Did you want to say something, Malfoy?” she asked boldly.
She sighed.  “No there isn’t. I promise you there isn’t. Shhh. Shhh. I understand. I understand.”
The first years smiled with satisfaction as the rest of the sixth years erupted into a bout of laughter, tears forming at the crests of their eyes.
He took a deep breath. “But it is.” He admitted
Reluctantly, he turned around, “what do you want Weasley?” he asked with disinterest.
Was it terrible that he didn’t exactly want to tell her? It was embarrassing. That Draco Malfoy was caught up on the Chosen One. That loving Harry Potter had reduced him to nothing but a blabbering mess.
In fact, Theo had been the perfect date so far. Welcoming, thoughtful, sociable, it was all Draco could've asked for. He didn't like that. It made all of this, all the lies and the deceit, just that much harder.
So, Draco let go of his fear, and the pictures came flooding in. Him and Potter hand in hand walking down Diagon Alley. Potter and him buying their first house together. Potter and him getting married. Their first child. Their second child. Them growing old together, loving each other till the day they died. He pictured his future, and it was all Potter.
! Every nerve in his body is on alert, his body shaking with pure bliss as Potter looks up at him defiantly as he sucks his cock. Long and hard.
It was all too much.
And there it was! The words he was waiting to hear. The words he had always known himself to be.
The pain was bearable, but it was still there.
Draco furrowed his brows, “Did I or did I not already say that I decline your Hogsmeade offer. Or am I going barmy here.” He sarcastically stated.
He howled in pain as he reached the lifeless figure, his aunt laughing in glee. “I killed a mudblood. I killed Draco’s likkle mudblood.” She chanted and he saw red.
Headmistress McGonagall will allow you and your grandparents an
Then... there was a little bit of a problem
“But of course, you’re paying. I’d expected no different.”
The Weaselette scoffed. “Really?” she drawled. “Because I’m quite sure that he loves sausage much more.” She spat and Draco paled. “Harry’s sausage to be exact.”
Draco was almost finished, and he was scared. He was so, so scared.
A rustle from outside his bed curtains caught his attention. Oh, for Merlin sake, what now? He thought grumpily.
Draco was feeling very emotional. He didn’t want to let Kat venture into the world alone. She was still too young. Too innocent. She couldn’t be corrupted. That’s it, he’d tell Ricky no. He could do that.
It all suddenly became far too real. He was doomed. He’d never be able to fix that blasted cabinet. His life, his father’s, his
Well, this was a warm welcome. “Nice to see you too, Uncle Sev.” He quipped and Severus growled.
He carefully plucked the letter from the owls beak, before giving her a friendly pat and opening the letter.
you.” He declared with a shaky breath. “I’ll take the portkey.” He assured him.
He shook his head as he struggled to come to terms with his actions, “but why would I have done that?” He asked in disbelief.
Love wasn't stupid. Dangerous, yes. But stupid... something so beautiful couldn't be anything more than perfect. Yes it was terrifying, living in constant fear of falling with no one there to catch you. But in all honsety at one point of one's life it was a fall that were all going to have to take.
He was at a complete loss. He had glitter in his hair and tape stuck to his fingers. His normally flawless hair was sticking up in all different directions, his cheeks were redder than a flock of Weasleys.
Draco glared at him. “No, it doesn’t. Why not have built in bread? Why build this confusing contraption? Why not use a charm to toast the bread?”
Draco turned around and met unkind green eyes. He blinked, lowering his head slightly.
In that moment, he realised that he had a duty. They all had a duty to protect the next generation. To shape and guide them. To make sure that their optimism was never replaced with pessimism, much like many of them had been exposed to. They deserved a chance to be free to have a choice, and it was up to them to make sure they got it.
Draco shrugged. “I know, that’s what it’s called.” He said again, frustrated that Potter would even dare to question him.
Annie sighed and Draco let out a triumphant grin. “Fine.” She huffed. “Hand me the stupid thing.” She held out her hand.
He was sick of hearing those two words. The two words that had torn his life from him, that had turned him into a monster that he had never asked to be. He had
“What am I talking about?” he asked hysterically. “What am I
“That’s the point.” His aunt turned to face him, giving him an angry sneer. “What’s wrong little baby Draco?” she cooed. “Come to try and fail saving this mudblood like you failed to save you little Hufflepuff mudblood filth?” She spat and Draco saw red.
“That’s Potter-Malfoy to you.” Harry told his father and Draco shook his head knowing how much hearing that grinded on his father’s nerves.
Draco sighed and attempted again. “Father, can you hear me?” he asked whilst seriously debating whether or not slamming his head against the window beside him was an appropriate action at present. After careful consideration, he decided against it. He was not potentially messing up his hair for anybody.
“Yes, you will!” Draco bit out his voice wavering slightly. “Everybody’s judging me. They’re always judging me.” His body started to shake, his palms heating up.
He crumpled to the ground, feeling as if a part of his soul had been ripped out. Kat was gone, but it wasn’t over yet.
“Morsen. Ricky Morsen.” He replied and Draco nodded in approval, what a fine way to introduce ones name.
So, he’d snapped. He told Pansy to shut up and never utter Potter’s name whenever he was around. It was a moment that he was less than proud of.
do you think you’re doing?” he spat.
Closing the door again, once more, Draco muttered a further few spells before opening up the cabinet for a second time. He felt his heart stop as he took in the fallen creature.
Draco reverted his attention back onto the quivering girl. “I know we sound like complete idiots, but you have to trust us.” He pleaded.
Draco raised a brow at her, “Oh, so you’re a healer now?”
Draco sighed rapidly thinking of a bullshit answer.. “What’s better than having Purebloods follow the Dark Lord?” he mused. “Having Purebloods
“Didn’t I tell you not to get mad?” Potter defended whilst tending to he assumed sore arm.
“Well, come on then.” Draco urged. “Or I’ll just jerk myself off.” He threatened.
“And why are you late, Mr Malfoy?” Slughorn enquired.
He’d once thought that life wasn’t about avoiding the bruises, but maybe it was collecting the scars to prove he’d shown up for it.
dramatic for Merlin's sake!
Draco ignored him. “And you” he spat at a red-faced Smith “You need to stop acting like a blooming saviour, we’ve already got one of those. And trust me we don’t need nor want another, one’s annoying enough. There’s seriously nothing worse than a Hufflepuff acting like a Gryffindor.” He teased.
He tutted. “What is it?” he asked impatiently, he was a busy person, he had places to go, people to see, beds to sleep in.
“That’s how we knew. That’s when we
? He thought with annoyance. He almost never received any owls from home, so seeing the owl in front of him, filled him with deep dread.
Potter took a deep breath before carrying on. “But I’m not that person. I’ve never been that person. I don’t think I’ll ever be that person.” Potter’s voice cracked, and Draco felt sick. He didn’t want this. He couldn’t do this. But he would. He had to.
So, it appeared Draco was wrong. Crap. He really thought he had something with the whole hair products guess.
. The Headmaster was dead.
But during the night, Potter was different. He was kind. His smiles were genuine, his laughs sincere. Every night without fail, Potter would meet Draco at the lake. He would talk to him about his day, he would share jokes with him, Draco knew his favourite subject. Defence against the dark arts.
It had been almost a month since he’d been back there. Since he’d been to Kat’s grave. He knew that it was weak, that it was wrong on his part. But he just couldn’t bring himself to. He’d thought about it many a times, he’d even gone as far as to make it to the door of the Malfoy grounds. But he’d always receded, wanting it to stay a dream just a little while longer had always won in the end.
Her face took on a more serious look, “I know that the last year has been tough on many. I understand that many don’t buy into the whole idea of victory. What did we really win? Together we rid the world of Voldemort.” She stammered when she said his name, But Draco was proud of her, nevertheless. He’d never noticed how brave, and how strong the woman in front of him truly was. He was ashamed of his ignorance.
Draco felt Kat’s small hand lock with his, giving him a reassuring squeeze. He couldn't say anything to Potter. Not even if he wanted to.
The first thing he noticed was that she looked quite similar to his mother. Despite her brown locks and thin lips, in many respects they could’ve passed as twins. The second thing he noticed was that she was carrying a small child in her arms.
“JUST HOMEWORK!?!” Hermione screeched, and it continued.
Hermione pulled away from him, locking her desperate eyes onto his broken ones. She looked determined; it was once thing that he’d always admired about her. “You haven’t lost him. She spoke with forceful conviction.
“Malfoy.” The cold voice stopped him in his tracks. He knew who it was. How could he not recognise the voice that had being rattling inside his head since first year?
“I apologise that I haven’t visited sooner. Everything’s just been a little too… much lately.” He replied as honestly as he could.
Draco nodded. “I guess that’s quite true.” He mused.
Draco couldn’t help it.
He felt his eyes starting to close, his breaths becoming shallower. Myrtle’s screams and Potter’s cries could be heard echoing throughout the room. But Draco didn’t have the energy to try and even care. As he descended into darkness, he felt his blood slowly trickle back into his body.
His father shook his head. “And that was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I should’ve let you choose. You could’ve been greater, better than I.” he mumbled.
Draco shuddered. “Draco.” he snapped at the girl, glaring daggers at her.
too much.
“What are you doing here?” Potter tried again and Draco ignored him.
His father looked down at him thoughtfully as he unknowingly played with a few strands of his long locks. “Looked to me as if you had
His hot tears were sticky against his skin. He just wanted it all to be over. He just wanted it all to turn out to be a terrible, terrible nightmare.
He blinked back the tears that threatened to stain his cheeks. He was in public. A Malfoy never showed emotions in a public space. He took a deep, defeated breath. Perhaps he hated Potter far less than he envied him. Above all, he knew one thing for certain. He could never hate Potter as much as he hated himself.
Seriously, that thing needed to be locked away in Azkaban or something, he was sure the sheer vulgarity of it was breaking at least some laws.
(See the end of the chapter for
That’s exactly what he would do. He thought with determination, before exiting the room of requirement in search of some breakfast.
Several moments later, Potter and Weasley burst through the room. Through blurry eyes, he was sure that he could see their ex-house elf with them, but he was probably hallucinating.
She glared at him and crossed her arms in defiance. “I’m
He was such an idiot. What in Merlin’s name was he thinking? That breakfast would make him feel better. He couldn’t eat. He couldn’t so much as look at food without wanting to throw up. He hated it.
“No, we haven’t.” he mumbled.
“Just stay away from me. You’re crazy.” The second-year boy spat.
Macmillan nodded. “I knew it. Weasley never treated her right.” he huffed. “It was as if he was always thinking about somebody else.” That would be Hermione…
She was just a girl. A beautiful, little girl. She shouldn’t be here. She didn’t deserve to be in his aunt’s clutches. He wanted to run to her. He wanted to keep her safe. But he couldn’t move. He was paralyzed.
Hell, war didn't discriminate. Everyone was a target.
Draco hugged her just as tight, “I promise.” He said truthfully, and they remained wrapped in each other’s arms for several more moments.
He even owed it to himself.
Potter still ignored him during the day. It was either Draco didn’t exist, or that his existence was an inconvenience for Potter. There was no in between. Draco didn’t know how he felt about that. On the one hand, the day hurt. It hurt so goddamn much. To be belittled by Potter, to be cast away like he were nothing.
Draco shook his head frantically, refusing to answer. If he said his name then it would all become real. But the problem was it
The screams carried on. They were like a never ending nightmare, finding comfort inside his head. He needed to stop this. He needed to be brave. He needed to be strong.
He blushed, “they’re not that good.” he said honestly.
She smiled. “That’s exactly why I got it; I knew that it posed a challenge so I—”
She sighed, “because I’m siting here.” she gestured to herself sadly.
And Draco took a deep breath, preparing to keep this alteration in his memory bank for future stories.
It had taken a strength that he didn’t even know he possessed to be able to come out here today. He wanted to run. He wanted to hide. He wanted it to be all over. But he couldn’t. He wouldn’t. He needed to be strong. For the both of them.
“I didn’t mean fleeing to another country.” He argued, but deep down he knew that his objection was weak. He had virtually given Potter the wings to fly away.
The familiar voice in his head sang out, it menacing and frilly. Couldn’t it see? Couldn’t anyone see? He couldn’t fix the cabinet. He wasn’t powerful enough.
“I’m sorry.” Potter said quietly.
Potter entwined their fingers together and looked up at Draco defiantly. “There’s not much I can say to that except that I remember. Oh Merlin, do I remember. And I can promise you now, that what we had is worth fighting for. I wasn’t lying when I told you that you were it for me Draco Malfoy.” He said intently.
He growled. “How do you know what I am?” He spat with fury. “I’ve done things that would shock you.” He seethed. Because how did the old man know? How could he not see what Draco was? He was a coward. He was manipulative. He was a Death Eater. He didn’t deserve to be understood. No, he deserved to rot.
“I promise.” He attempted one last time.
But even with the odds against him. Draco had still become best friends with Hufflepuff’s. He still managed to apologise to all he had wronged. He couldn’t kill Dumbledore. He made Portkey’s for all the Muggleborn’s. He’d saved Ron, Hermione’s, and his life. He loved Harry….
Anyhow, Pansy said a few things, he said a few things. Screams erupted, slaps were thrown. The bitch had managed to claw him right on the cheek. He raised a shaky hand to the wound; he was convinced that she was part cat.
“But I’m here now.” he promised him. “I’m here and I’m not going anywhere.” He held Draco’s left arm tightly.
Okay, it was exactly that. Draco really didn't want to talk to him.
Pansy shook her head, “we have nothing to say.” She stated, gesturing between Blaise and herself.
Potter sighed a sigh of relief, before staring at the lake before him.
It was all his fault. Why was it always his fault? Why wasn’t he Potter? Why couldn’t be Harry sodding Potter Saviour of the bloody Wizarding World. Why did he have to be Draco Lucius Malfoy? Why was his father a Death Eater? Why was Draco expected to become a Death Eater. To always be a Death Eater.
Smith growled. “That’s it Malfoy. I’m done with your shit.” He swore and Draco put up a shield charm in the nick of time, anticipating Smith’s next move.
Luna, Ollivander, and Dean had testified about the months they spent at the manor and how Draco never failed to sneak in food, water, and blankets that had essentially saved their lives. Ollivander also described how Draco would teach prisoners how to successfully fake being hit with a crucio, on their first night at the manor. Whilst Luna spoke about how he would always keep prisoners company well into the night, something he didn’t have to do and could’ve been killed for.
How could he not like them? How could he honestly not like them?
“People like me?”
“Don’t say anything, open the rest. Open the rest!” she squealed.
Pansy sighed. “I know
Potter’s eyes glistened in realisation. “You’re not coming with us?” He whispered.
He raised a sharp brow. “See what?” he asked, both fearful and happy that he knew the answer.
She narrowed her eyes and growled. “After what you’ve done? Do you mean apologising and making amends with all you’ve wronged. Do you mean helping and loving innocent little Hufflepuff’s who idolise you? Do you mean making portkey’s for all at risk Muggleborn’s as well as
Potter chuckled, “I think dinner’s ready.” He commented looking solely at Draco which made his heart thump. He hated the effect that Potter continued to have on him.
Scared of him! Well, he had to admit, that brought a smile to his face. He quite liked the idea of being intimidating.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t know. I don’t know.” He said deliriously. “This is a good thing. It’s a good thing.” He repeated. “Now you can stay away from me. You have to stay away from me.”
Kat looked down in disappointment. “Oh” she muttered and Draco felt horrible for his Hufflepuff's, he looked at Madam Pomfrey hopefully who sighed.
Would he just stop intruding? Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “It doesn’t matter if it was nothing or if it wasn’t. I don’t see how any of it is your business.” He quipped.
He pulled away begrudgingly, “I’ll
He had to get away. He had to get far, far away.
Suddenly, his aunt shrieked, frantically running towards them. Draco made a split-second decision, pushing Potter onto Weasley. “NOW!” he screamed at the house elf who apparated.
Draw something happy he thought. Draw something happy. He could do that. It wasn’t that hard. Not really. All he had to do was think happy thoughts and his creative side would do the rest.
Pansy shook her head. “I don’t quite think that’s how it all works.” she mused and Draco wanted to hex her fat gob shut.
Draco felt warm all over. That little anecdote had meant more than he could ever express. It felt nice to hear how much his father loved him. There had been many a times where he questioned that. But hearing his mother express his father’s unconditional love made him feel accepted. Something he had always longed to feel where his father was concerned.
Draco blinked. He was actually pretty content to watch their petty argument. It served for some great entertainment.
The Death Eater nodded, “Sorry man, I guess that does sound pretty terrifying, but I don’t understand why—”
Potter narrowed his eyes at him. “No. No problem at all.” he spat.
Oh god. Draco abruptly turned away from the cabinet. This room was messing with his head. He did
“You have to help me out here Draco.” Potter sighed in frustration. “You have to give me something else. Something more.” He urged almost pleadingly.
Draco sighed; must he do
“You’re alive.” he whispered almost disbelievingly to Potter as they entered an abandoned classroom. Draco didn’t know what to feel. His emotions were all over the place. They were
He sighed, he needed to wrap this up. The sooner, the better
He knew he’d never tell Potter. He knew that nobody would never know. But he had to do it. He had to write to Potter. It kept him sane.
How had he ended up here? He thought absently. How had he ended up
Draco was lying on his bed. He was exhausted.
He diverted his attention back on Potter. “You didn’t scream at me. You didn’t demand anything. You just wanted me. You listened to me. You never said anything, but I knew you were always listening. You would smile when I said something funny. You would squeeze my hand whenever I said something sad.”
They were Potter's family, he desperately craved their acceptance. And he wasn't sure that he was going to get it, especially after all he'd said and done to them.
“Well?” he aunt asks, pulling on the back of Potter’s head. Her eyes were full of desperation, her voice laced with manic pleading. Draco hated it. He hated her.
He started to chuckle. Then he started to laugh, loud and vibrant. Then finally, he started to wheeze. “I’m sorry—” he started through puffs of laughter.
“Don’t worry Draco, I know what you need. I know how you like me to kiss you slowly, over and over until you can no longer bare it.” his hands fly up to the sides of Draco’s head, pulling him in for another filthy kiss. “I know how you like putting my fat dick in your mouth like the cockslut you are.” He squeezed Draco’s balled and he moaned, it catching deep within his throat. “I know it all.”
Draco made a decision. An impulsive, stupid decision.
Draco gave her a weak smile. “That is freakishly adorable.” He informed her. “You should tell him.” he decided.
Has he ever thought about the world? Well, not right now. He was
Draco felt something very similar to dread start to wash over him. This was bad. This was very, very bad.
“Meaning?”
much to ask for?
He looked as though he might have been considering, so Draco carried on. “Why don’t you just take your chances?” he proposed fairly.
Draco shook his head. “Nothing.” He answered absently. Because
Draco sexually confused because of Harry Potter? Now, Draco had heard it all. He was convinced that his father had gone crazy. Azkaban does that to a person.
Harry Potter was standing before him. He was holding Draco in his arms, giving him the most loving smile that he could muster. Draco hadn’t seen Potter in months, but he was here. He was holding Draco and it seemed as if he would never let go.
They shook their heads. Draco smirked mischievously, pulling out his wand. “Would you care to find out?” he threatened pointedly.
The taunts. The jabs. The sneers and spits. The letter that he wrote to Potter and Potter only. The unyielding faith and hope that he had in him. Draco didn’t know exactly what he felt for Potter, but it was definitely something. He’d be a fool to think otherwise.
“Over our dead bodies.” Kat bit out and Draco wholeheartedly believed her. That worried him
“So dear,” Mrs Weasley started, “my lazy son here tells me that you’re the reason that he scored an O on his potions project.” He beamed at him, lumping a huge piece of chicken breast onto his plate.
She gave him a sceptical look. “Then why did you call me here?” she questioned, and he braced himself for what he was about to say next.
. And not even moderately acceptable good. But honest to Merlin, jaw dropping good.
Draco even wrote to Potter.
Draco huffed. “I really wish everyone would stop asking me that. He bit out. “Do you think that I’m
He turned to Theo, taking a deep breath before letting out one, single word. “Yes.”
Potter slept on the couch that night.
Mark his words. Weasley was going to become a chicken specialist in the future. There was no other alternative.
“If you’d just let me get to that Jerry.” He said
nights kept him alive. He wanted to say that he was doing this for his own good. That he was keeping Potter safe. That he was keeping Potter away from him.
He tore at her dress. Clawing it frantically. He had to find the wound. If he found the wound then he could save her. She wasn’t dead. SHE WASN’T DEAD!
. Hope is the only thing stronger than fear.” he told him, echoing the few words that Draco had told himself many times before.
It made him paranoid, double checking his every move. He couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep. It were if the attention were an ocean, and he was slowly and painfully drowning in it.
Macmillan sighed in defeat. “Itslavenderbrown.” He mumbled quietly,
Truthfully, he wouldn't believe himself either.
He watched in concern as Potter took a deep breath, his eyes shifting slightly to Draco’s neck. “I went to see your father.” He admitted softly.
“Draco?” his mother whispered carefully, and he turned to face her, “are you awake?” she asked and he was just about to answer when the cup of tea she was carrying slipped from her grasp and landed onto the floor with a painfully loud
Draco was currently in potions, pretending not to feel Potter’s eyes burning a hole into the side of his head. How rude. Didn’t Potter realise that Draco was under a lot of stress. Doing the biddings of a madman does that to a person. Let’s not even go as far as to mention Draco’s own self-loathing, or else he’d really be opening a can of worms.
This was all his fault. Everything he touched died. She shouldn’t have been here. It shouldn’t have been her. She was the epitome of beauty and innocence. A vibrant and loving little girl, who represented all that was pure in the world.
been Potter.
Weasley looked around confused. “I don’t see an elephant.” he answered and Draco tried so hard not to laugh. Was Weasley actually being serious?
So Draco interacted with Lucius this chapter. I really wanted to explore their relationship. Any ideas on what Draco's plan could be? A teaser for next chapter: IT. ALL. KICKS. OFF!
“Anyways.” Weasley continued, “Harry’s little episode cost me my chicken date. I was absolutely fuming. Still am, mind you.” He bit out.
He was just about to hurl a witty remark when she took a deep breath. “What’s going on with you Draco?” she asked in concern.
“I know what they’re saying about Potter is true.” She started and Draco was slightly shocked. “We all knew. Kat was the first to figure it out.” She slowly admitted. He winced, because
Draco took a deep breath, ready to bare all to a girl he hardly knew. “I really don’t want to do this anymore.” He cried out, pacing around the bathroom.
I’m a Hufflepuff, not blind.” she told him.
“You’re giving me a bloody ring?” Potter boomed out.
Potter narrowed his eyes, stomping away from the Gryffindor table with determination. Draco’s eyes trailed him as he walked towards the doors.
Draco grinned as he broke away from the Weasley twin. “Well, I wasn’t going to let you die, was I?” he attempted to joke.
He froze as he was engulfed in a deep warmth, his ring buzzing with magic and tranquillity. It felt oddly nice to be this close to Potter. He felt safer than he’d ever felt, locked soundly in his ex-nemesis’ arms.
The battle continued.
He shrugged. “I don’t know you, so I’m not sure.” he said simply.
Hermione sighed. “I’m so sorry this happened to you. You didn’t deserve it.” she said and Draco felt quite guilty because yes, he did deserve it.
To be frank, he'd want nothing more than to spend the day in bed with Potter, wrapped in each other's arms. His lips curled into a cunning smirk, a evil twinkle in his eyes.
“Draco, is everything okay?” Kat asked, her eyes full of worry, as he made his way hesitantly towards her.
“You’re gorgeous.” He breathes and then he’s pushing inside of him, holding his wrists above his head, and pressing them deep into the mattress. Draco struggles as Potter slams into him, relentlessly fierce and sure, giving him just what he needed. What he’s always needed.
“You’re mine Draco Malfoy.” He whispered possessively. “
He smiled. “The end of the week, at the latest.” He answered, shooting her one of his rare, signature smiles.
He paused as if waiting for Draco to respond. Fat chance that was going to happen. “I swear to Merlin Malfoy if you’ve done anything to her, I’ll end you.” He spat and Draco could feel a slight anger start to boil beneath his skin.
“I’m sorry.” Potter whispered and Draco entwined his fingers with Potter’s giving them a tight squeeze.
Draco sneered at him and Potter grinned daftly, “Well, Potter I didn’t tell you to accept any of my invitations and you did, so I guess we both don’t get what we want.” Potter bit out and Draco almost smiled, because that maybe just a teeny bit, that sounded a lot like Draco.
Theo looked at him confused. “What?” he questioned blankly.
They looked up into the nights sky, gazing up at the stars. Together.
Hermione sighed. “You and Harry. Shouldn’t you already know what love is since your already so deeply acquainted with it?” she questioned knowingly.
Blaise smirked, “well, my hair is pretty fabulous.” He said cockily. “There was also that time where you decapitated all of Pansy’s dolls because you thought they were quote on quote ‘blood-thirsty monsters intent on draining ones intelligence and individuality.” He laughed.
Theo shrugged. “Maybe, but maybe not. Anyways, please Draco speak to me, give me a chance.” He whispered pleadingly.
!” the Dark Lord declared victoriously, and Draco closed his eyes as he felt his heart shatter. Hearing it was one thing, seeing it made it real, and feeling it… well that broke him.
Potter was following him.
“I’m sorry but—” He glanced into big, hopeful eyes and cursed the day that he was born. “But I think Kat would much more enjoy a walk around the castle grounds than a picnic. She likes to move around.” He finished sadly.
His father shrugged. “I’ve had several years to get used to the idea.” He said simply.
The Dark Lord had invaded his home, his family as been ostracized by the Death Eater's. He shivered as he pictured all the barbaric things that could potentially be done to him if he even attempted to buy a new sketchbook.
“What’s you’re problem?” he accused, and Draco wanted to scream that it was none of his damn business. Instead he kept his eyes firmly fixed on his book.
I’m not so certain anymore.” Draco could understand that.
He’d almost made it past what he liked to call ‘the danger zone’ when something alarming caught his eye. He froze at the sight, little piggy stood in the middle of the battle. He had always thought of her as one of the somewhat annoying Hufflepuff first-years who followed him blindly, now Draco will always remember as the idiotic Hufflepuff second year who foolishly followed Harry Potter into battle.
His mother huffed in annoyance, “I
And Draco loved him. He loved him with his own being, he knew that he’d never stop loving Harry. In fact, he fell a little bit more in love with him as each day passed.
Draco raised an amused brow, “where do you think they got it from?” he toyed and Draco laughed a genuine laugh for the first time, in a long time.
He collapsed onto the floor, howling in sheer agony. He’d never felt anything like it. it was worse than a crucio. It was worse than the fear he felt for the Dark Lord. No, this was pure torture.
That was hilarious. He never realised that Severus was a bloody comedian. Draco admit that he was wrong. Draco Lucius Malfoy? And leave himself open to Severus' smug teasing that he knew that he would indulge in. He thought not!
“You make me happy.” He said sincerely because she did. “Now, I have to work on my potions project, so why don’t you go back to the Hufflepuff dorms and I’ll see you tomorrow?” he offered.
Potter racked his free hand through his messy curls. “It’s me Draco. It’s me. Can’t you see? Don’t you know? Don’t you remember?” He sobbed through tears.
