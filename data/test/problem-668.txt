‘Wait, what?’ Pansy’s eyes widened, ‘You slept with Potter
That… actually made sense.
‘It’s okay.’ Potter assured him, ‘Okay. Proceed shall we?’
If by some off chance Lovegood was right, the little bees did a lot to help them today.
By that time, Draco had gone through law school with Granger; by putting what was left of his family’s connections to good use, it wasn’t long before he became one of the big shot defence lawyers. He managed to place his father, who was driven insane by Azkaban, in good care and renovated the Manor to keep a roof above his mother’s head.
They walked through the yard and headed towards the forbidden forest, talking about this and that, nothing important. When Potter said they were there, Draco looked up and saw moonlight casting down through the blue night, shredded by the branches and leaves, and as Potter whistled, a beast raised its head and looked over.
They made a plan for the man to drop by his apartment, to get their story straight, and then side-along to the restaurant.
It had been a while since the wall was used, banned by Dumbledore during his time as Headmaster, but rumor has it that one Omega has been using it for a few months now——a very attractive male Omega.
, he did every kiss and touch with zealous, before Draco was again pushed to the door of presumably the man’s room, his neck was already marked by quite a few hickeys and love bites.
Draco didn’t say anything, and the waiter interrupted at that moment to hand out the menu. Draco hid his face behind it, couldn’t really read a word.
The man froze.
Because he was her boss. Because he paid her good money. Because Thanksgiving was not a mandatory holiday.
Draco whimpered. And Potter let go. The switch landed again. As it was just a thin and light switch, it didn’t cause too much pain, just enough to sting and leave behind a light stripe of red. The first one mostly just caught Draco by surprise. It landed all over him, twenty or maybe thirty strikes, he groaned and gasped, lost count in the process.
"Can't you see I'm worried about you?!" Harry asks.
Neville walks back and plops down on the seat. The Slytherin has now gone. He takes a sip of his tea, yet it tastes strange. Perhaps it set out too long. He takes it to the bathroom and dumps the rest down the sink.
"Yeah, yeah."
Harry scoffs in response as Professor Lupin begins the lesson. "Alright, today we will be working on making a Patronus. Can anyone tell me what that is?" Lupin asks.
"Yes indeed he did. It was getting pretty annoying. He also mentioned how nervous he is around you? I dunno... Hopefully that doesn't make things weird between you." Pansy says.
"Madame Hooch couldn't even teach me! Every time I try I fail at it. Please, let me just ride on the broom with you." He begs.
Snape stared at him. He knew he was seeing red, but that only made Blaise smile.
He goes into the Great Hall and watches Neville sit on the steps. Blaise sits beside him and they sit in silence for a while.
"Yeah. I will. See you after lunch." Neville says, grabbing the letter back from Luna and walking off to the Great Hall. As he's walking he takes off his bracelet and puts it in his pocket. He wouldn't want Hannah asking questions.
The students begin to file in and as Harry opens up his fresh bottle of ink, Draco sends a spell his way, making the ink cover Harry's fresh parchment and cover his robes. Draco hadn't noticed his friends sitting with him until he heard their chuckles from either side of him.
"They're muggles, right?" Draco asks and Harry nods. Draco scoffs and turns up his nose, "Muggles are disgusting creatures. Especially those repulsive relatives of yours."
Pansy scoffs and gets up, leaving the great hall. Everyone looks at him in either shock, disgust, or confusion. He just didn't care anymore. If his father wouldn't cut off his inheritance and possibly disown him, he'd tell every one of them to piss off. He felt a pair of eyes on him and he looks around, his grey eyes meeting a pair of green ones. Harry Potter... For god's sake.
"Eww!" Draco shouts.
He sighs. He's done this before. Without a second thought, he gulps it all down.
"Neville?!" A familiar voice asks in surprise. A face suddenly comes into view. It was Blaise staring at him with wide eyes.
Harry stares at him, suddenly feeling the urge to right hook the boy just as Hermione did in third year. "Say that one more time, I dare you."
"Granger?"
Harry sighs, "I didn't say you were! Look, I just wanna get through this stupid ball and maybe do something normal for once. Besides, I'm incredibly tired and all these nightmares aren't doing good for me. That's all. I'm just tired and stressed."
"Lucius, lower your wand." The Dark Lord commands calmly. His father slowly lowers his weapon, but doesn't stop staring at Draco as if he was trying to strike him down with his eyes. "We all knew he'd never be able to do it... While I wouldn't mind you killing him otherwise, we need him. If anyone can beat Harry Potter, it is your son."
Neville was baffled. He couldn't wrap his head around someone giving him attention other than to laugh at him.
Even though his sadness remains, he is happy enough to feel in control.
"Yeah..." Blaise says, still refusing to look up at Draco.
Harry sighs, "We will try everything we can."
"I'm sorry Draco." Blaise says, patting Draco on the shoulder.
"Nev, I really-"
"Are you alright? You seemed to get lost in your head a bit there." Luna points out.
"No, how about you shut up and listen. I'm gonna tell you a little something about myself." Blaise says, making Draco's sneer turn into a look of dreadful confusion. "Let's go sit." Blaise leads him to a table full of chairs and they both sit in front of each other.
Ron looks at him like he's gone mad. "Are you serious?!"
He stands still then slowly moves towards the sight of Draco's shoes. As he gets closer he can hear the soft cries. He gasps as he catches sight of blood mixing with water and flowing down the tiled floor. He looks behind the wall separating him and Draco and his eyes widen.
Harry keeps glancing at him. It's freaking him out. Maybe he has something on his face?
"Permission granted, Mister Potter."
He noticed footsteps go towards the bathroom. Footsteps just heavy enough to recongnize. That's another task: get the money once he leaves the room. It seems terrible, but it's either this or starve.
He was hungry, terribly and dreadfully hungry. All he found was old stale crackers and moldy bread. His mother had gone somewhere with her boyfriend, but he assumed they were eating nice warm food.
He gains enough adrenaline to catch up to him and tackle him to the floor. Draco is laying on his back and gets up on his knees. He pins Harry's hands to the ground.
"No, it's not!" Draco shouts angrily.
"I'll go get the nurse." His mother says, rushing out of the room. He watches her walk out and greet three people, one in particular with a hug. The person happened to be Neville and the other two were Blaise and Luna. He noticed the three of them holding hands and felt very confused to say the least.
"Get out of my business." Draco says, walking away from him. Harry grabs onto his shirt and pulls him back. "Let go! I'm not a child!" Draco shouts.
"I heard what Snape did... Very rude. The bargyles would hate him." Luna says.
This can't be right. Does Draco wear amortentia for his cologne? No, there's no way. He smelt other things than just that cologne. Maybe he just really likes the scent of the cologne and that's why? Or he just kept smelling Draco beside him.
"Whatever. Goodnight." Blaise says, walking away as quickly as possible. He can't let her know how he really feels, how he truly thinks.
"How is it, dear?" Molly asks.
"Uh... Yeah about that. I tried telling Seamus it wasn't true but McGonagall interrupted me. I'm so sorry."
Blaise scoffs, "Really? That's why you think I shouldn't be talking to you?! Draco, that's ridiculous. I admit, I was upset at first, but that was my fault. I didn't take into consideration what your father must have been doing. I for sure didn't try to imagine how bad it must be... When Harry told me I... I was at a loss for words. My anger at you was inconsiderate and wrong, I admit that now. I apologize, mate."
He still couldn't believe he was dumb enough to believe Harry Potter could've actually cared about him and wanted to help. Then again, he wasn't wrong about Draco being the one to curse Katie Bell. However, he wasn't meaning to get Katie, he meant to get Dumbledore. That didn't matter anymore anyways.
"No!" He shouts, rushing to the oven and opening it to reveal hard, unedible brown cookies. He slams the cookie sheet on the table and groans. "Are you kidding me?!"
Suddenly, his heart began to beat like a cheetah running through the savanna. His stomach did hurdles through his body and his cheeks began to burn. Then, he finally realized what all of this meant. It wasn't sickness nor nervousness. It wasn't some random feeling that happened to appear. No, it was none of that. The only time he felt this was with his first ever crush, Vincent Widdleprim before he moved away to Germany.
"Draco, calm down." He says softly.
"Neville calm down." Harry says calmly.
"Of course! To be honest, I wouldn't be happy with the Daily Prophet discussing my love life anyways. They'd probably go ballistic over me dating a boy. I wouldn't want them attacking either of us."
‘Where exactly?’ Draco asked as they stepped on to a moving stair and was carried downward.
How he had been ruthless and vindictive.
Then he bit down and pulled at Draco’s earlobe.
Seven times he struck, making sure the Omega knew what he was punished for.
He said as he pointed a finger to his chafed red lips: ‘Or the treat?’
So, not just a sadist that worked in a dungeon, but a sadist that designed and ran the dungeon, the master of the dungeon of requirement.
Draco wiped his tears in the sheet, took a few shaky breaths and nodded: ‘Yes, sir. I… I think I can take it now.’
He was on the verge of tears, all he could do was pull his lips tight and stare down at the floor, let his stray fringe cover his reddened eyes.
The truth was he hadn't seen Ron and Hermione much lately, as they have been busy with both taking different classes for their N.E.W.T.s and the pregnancy. Fetuses of the Wizarding world didn't just grow with the Omega's nutrients, but also the scents and magic provided by the Alpha; otherwise, there's a chance they would miscarriage or become squibs. Hermione and Ron had missed the beginning of the pregnancy due to life-threatening situations, fortunately, as Hermione was a strong Omega, the fetus had gone dormant, and they had been visiting St. Mangos quite often to go through other magical procedures to supply magic to their child.
‘About three years since we first started sleeping together?’ Draco thought back.
‘So what did he bribe you with to work with him, you know, besides his skills in the sack?’
Draco couldn’t help but laughed, looking up at the man with a smile that looked even more beautiful with his red eyes: ‘So I’m allowed to call you Saint Potter?’
But the tip of his ears were still red, and Draco felt ballsy, he leaned in to whisper in the man’s ear: ‘You want to do something about it?’
Potter was surprised, confused and hurt. The hurt was so plainly on display that Draco felt as if he were stabbed by it, he took a step back and was in the middle of the street, cars rushed towards him, and Potter was reaching for him: ‘Look out!’
‘I uh, don’t want you to think any worse of me.’ The man said shyly.
‘Good. And please stop apologising to me.’ Potter smiled, he was kind of awkward, but gentlemanly, ‘It seems to be the only reason you’ve been talking to me. If anything, I’m the one with a lot of overdue apologies.’
Whoever cast it was a decent wizard; breaking free wouldn’t be a problem with his wand, but now it’s impossible. Draco can get the wizard's general power level from the strength of the restraints —— slightly less than himself, not to brag.
Someone got a bloody picture of Potter helping him get off the hippogriff, and it got plastered over almost all the front page of newspapers and magazines. It was a very nice shot, bloody romantic even, as there’s moon, star, hippogriff, and Potter was smiling. Draco’s head was lowered, and it could easily be mistaken as shy.
‘You are unbelievable!’ Pansy threw a blueberry at Draco, ‘Is this how much Potter spoiled you, Draco? I feel bad for him, really.’
‘And I was able to chose the way you bullied me?’ Potter asked.
So. Back to the obvious problem: Draco was kidnapped, now locked in a dark dungeon somewhere unknown.
He wasn't really in the mood to be gentle tonight, so he pushed himself all the way in at the first thrust, slow but firm, feeling the Omega forced to stretch around his girth and then length. It seemed to be a bit too much for the Omega after a night of similarly brutal intercourse, his abused arsehole struggling to adjust to the intrusion, the stretch might even be painful, but his hole was too wet to stop or slow Harry down, the harder he clenches, the worse it was for him, and he was so wet that the hole almost sucked Harry in right before he bottomed out.
‘Good.’ Potter ruffled his hair, but Draco couldn’t find it in himself to feel irritated, just slipped down from Potter’s lap and kneeled in the instructed position.
For a brief moment, Draco felt like he just made a deal with the devil.
Being whipped front and back means Draco couldn’t lie down either way. It didn’t matter, as Potter seemed to have decided that moving Draco wasn’t a good idea, and Draco’s legs around him was a good position. He just summoned the aftercare box into the playroom to do the aftercare there.
‘No.’ Rosier said slowly, ‘Because you are a death eater.’
Then came the next slap. And the next. Potter alternated between the two cheeks, making sure every part of his arse was evenly covered. The pain was just so much that he forgot about the rule and reached behind.
Enjoy it if you can. Love you regardless.
The second time Potter brought it up was about two years later when Potter got appointed the captain of the special victims unit.
That shouldn’t have moved Draco’s heart, but it did. He took a deep breath, then bowed. He would have done it gracefully, if he wasn’t pumped full of cum by the man and had a silver ball up his arse, which just happened to shift as he bowed. It was a lousy and shaky bow, but the hippogriff wasn’t picky. It bowed back and lowered his head, motioning for Draco to come closer.
That had Draco determined to make Potter comfort him for a long time, putting off the inevitable as long as possible, but he could only drag it out for so long. Once he nodded, Potter kissed him and let him kneel on the ground: ‘I know I said we need to talk, but my current situation makes it difficult for me actually to talk. It’s not ideal, but I’ll have to ask you a few questions instead. Answer me as truthfully as you can, Draco; I’ll not hold your words against you. I just want to deal with… whatever this is, however I can.’
‘Oh, so you were talking about…’ Neville was shocked, but quickly schooled himself, ‘Anyway, you deserve to be happy. If anyone deserves to be happy, it’s you. I wouldn’t care what everyone else thinks. As long as you are happy.’
Part of the reason Draco didn’t go back in was he would have no reason to stay so close to Potter’s patronus. He knew the patronus couldn’t possibly be tangible and warm, but it was so comfortable that he didn’t want to move.
He looked every bit the protective and caring Alpha, and Harry caught Hermione looking at Ron's back fondly.
The man stopped abruptly and fell silent.
Draco was stunned. He tried to say something, but he had no good answer to the question. Not if he didn’t want to reveal too much.
They spent a lot of time working the cases together, even when they weren’t, Potter’s office was just a wall away, separated by glass and blinds. It felt intimate and somehow comforting. It’s also kind of a sweet torment, as sometimes when they both look up from work, Potter would smile brightly at him, and all the emotions Draco kept boxed in tight would threaten to break loose.
‘You are dating my godson?’ Even Draco flinched away from Severus’s cold tone and deathly stare, despite the fact that it’s not directed at him, ‘
His voice was quivering a little, and he hated that tears are welling up in his eyes and tried to blink them away.
Potter adjusted the length of the chain to a point Draco couldn’t straighten his back; it put a subtle strain on his arms that Draco knew is going to make the punishment harder as it proceeds. A cold leather paddle of Potter’s choosing drew a line up Draco’s leg, over his back, then under his chin, lifting his head. Draco didn’t look up, and heard Potter say: ‘I see you’ve learned. Now you may look at me.’
The fake Forgecount didn’t answer immediately, just repeated: ‘Where is Harry Potter.’
It wasn’t that much of a big deal for an Alpha to mark an Omega, as in theory they could mark as many Omegas as they want, it’s not illegal to mark multiple Omegas as long as the Alpha only claim one as the wife, and the others as concubines——slaves serve to please their Alpha and breed but were not granted the honour of a mark. There’s no limit on the numbers of Omegas an Alpha keeps as long as he could afford them. Some Alphas would even find excuses to abandon the concubines or give slaves away as gifts.
He didn’t know what he was asking. It was just his idea of a joke, his idea of flirting. He didn’t know, but Draco knew better. He was going to be the death of Draco.
‘The ones that assaulted the Weasleys’ residence,’ Rosier said, presenting a picture of the black mark twisting in the sky to Draco, ‘called themselves, neo-death eaters.’
‘At the Yule Ball.’ Draco answered.
The note said.
Draco held it for a second, leaned down and gave it a shaky kiss, then dropped it on the ground and stomped on it.
So Draco got into the slip dress and got a taste of wooden ruler —— the kind that’s used by a tailor, the man really had a thing for poetic justice. Just ten strikes on his arse but they were not so easy to take nonetheless. It had the similar bite of the wood paddle Potter used on him earlier, but the ruler's square tip hurts more, so Potter kindly aimed it at Draco’s right arse cheek as his left already sustained the overlap of whip marks. It had Draco moaning and writhing, painted Draco’s arse right back to the pretty red.
Draco blushed at the man’s words, and saw him pull out a silver silk slip dress with white laces of roses, barely the length of his thigh, mostly bareback and only a few straps holding it together at the arse.
Weasley was surprised, Draco had to clear his throat to jerk him from his stunned state: ‘Uh, Mal… Malfoy. Yes. You too.’
He smiled brightly and a bit animalistic.
‘Happy new year.’ The man smiled so brightly that all the artificial lights and stars shy away.
Rosier almost failed to proceed, but quickly schooled himself and said to Potter: ‘Get into the circle —— Your hands. I almost forgot. I know how good you are at wandless magic. They must go first.’
The man paused, then continued: ‘About that, I rather dislike the mark of someone else on my pet.’
But that arse. It didn't just consent by staying; it moved back slowly, the unavoiding was as good as inviting.
'It's a girl?' Ginny gasped, 'Oh, Godric!'
The man was biting back a laugh, only let on a warm smile, reached for Draco’s hair and ruffled it. Draco was even more angry at this point: grabbing his hair or combing through his hair with fingers was one thing, ruffling them and making a mess was another. He valued his hair. However, the way he looked up angrily at the man only reminded the man of an arrogant and spoiled cat, and was also quite pretty as he was naked, kneeling, with tears in his eyes and a fierce blush on his cheeks. He looked… lively. Contrary to the lifeless fake perfect he tried to pull or the pale solitary that leaks through the mask.
Potter smiled at that, sat back down and let Draco do it lazily like a cat playing with his milk: ‘How can you be so cute.’
At that, Draco could feel himself boiling. It’s so much more embarrassing to face what he had done when he was no longer angry. He wanted to smother Potter with his pillow or something, but that would just embarrass himself further.
Potter looked like he wanted to say something, but no sound came out, he looked down at his hand and sighed. Draco was so embarrassed that he wished the ground would open up and swallow him whole, and he really needed to say something smart to get them out of this awkward situation.
Potter waved his wand and handcuffs and shackles tied Draco into place, another wide leather belt wrapped around his waist, chaining him in place to the rails on both sides till there’s not a millimetre for Draco to move.
Even none of those were real.
‘Morgana I’ve always wondered what could get you to admit that, poor Potter, suffered through all that just because you are an emotional imbecile… but he definitely deserved it, thinking back about it now.’ Pansy tipped the glass over, ‘
The kidnapper froze.
The way Draco said it, playful and seductive, Potter arched a brow as he knew what Draco was getting at. He gets down on one knee anyway, looking a bit ridiculous in the hospital gown, but also good in a way it shouldn’t have been possible. He put Draco’s fluffy bunny slippers on, pulled Draco to stand, and traced the tip of his nose along Draco’s cock.
‘No! No, you don’t get to “Draco” me!’ Draco was upset, ‘What was it with that woman! And you didn’t tell me last time we talked about that!’
‘I don’t know! Whatever happened with that scar?’ Pansy said, and cut Draco off at that, ‘Don’t you dare lie to me again! I know he was the one who put that on you, because if any other person did that to you, one of either two things would have happened, either you asked me to use my family’s connection to make sure that guy rut in Azkaban, or you asked me to help make a body disappear.’
He went along with the joke, but he knew Potter was right; it’s what Ruby talked about too. Too much self-hatred, too much self-deception, it wasn’t just others he was hurting, but himself. That’s what Potter cared about. Draco wouldn’t say so, but he knew.
The man sighed, rolling on top of him: ‘You really need to decide how you feel about him.’
It’s life or death at this one try.
And——it didn’t last.
could have told me where you were going rather than leaving me on the floor.’ Draco folded his arms.
So that’s the end.
And he was ready to give that all up for Draco.
‘You know what I hated most about the inquisitorial squad?’ Potter asked, his voice icy cold.
Draco turned to leave, but Potter caught his wrist: ‘I grew up in a cupboard.’
Draco turned and saw a giant lion head and it fucking
‘That’s probably true.’ Potter said, taking off his belt, ‘But talking like that is just going to make things harder for you.’
But just as they gained some altitude, the bloody beast took a nosedive, and Draco panicked and the next thing he knew, he had his arms around Potter’s strong waist and his face buried between Potter’s shoulders.
‘Your speech,’ Draco said, diverting his own concentration, ‘was beautiful. You meant it?’
‘It’s going to take a while. Have a seat?’ Harry asked.
Weasley was green now, but Hermione pulled him out of the door with ‘enjoy the day’.
By this point, Harry’s desk was swamped by Omegas wanting a vial of his magic and scent, it’s a good thing a few Omegas and Betas still had the decency to leave Harry be, and a few vials were left behind.
Any sentence more than two words? Draco wanted to retort, but stopped himself.
The fake Potter went away. Draco slipped to the floor and ran his hand over his face. He felt weird talking to the fake Potter from room 7. Something just didn’t sit right.
Then he took out his own wand: ‘Incarcerous.’
But. No one said being loved by Draco Malfoy was a flat road to happiness. He’s going to torture Potter just a little bit more.
Draco was woken by the sound of someone insistingly and annoyingly tapping at the window.
‘Good night.’ He said, a rather mischievous and cruel smile on his face, ‘I enjoyed your company.’
Draco was stunned as the man dragged him to the table.
For a while, he couldn’t find the courage to go back to the position Potter required. And Potter didn’t rush him, just looked at him calmly with those green eyes, watching him, judging him, as if he were evaluating whether Draco was worth the time and effort he would be devoting to punish and educate him. Draco somehow knew he brought this punishment on himself when he mouthed back and tried to block the strikes, because Potter was testing him, testing whether he was sincerely sorry for what he did and was willing to atone. Now that there were no restraints, he could just say the safe word and walk away, or he could curl up and hide under the table and never come out.
But his thought was cut short, as the aftercare work had proceeded to applying a different salve to his arsehole. Potter also seemed to have gotten back his tongue, for he looked up at Draco with those bewitching emerald eyes, a teasing expression on his face: ‘How about you tell me what you learned today?’
Draco took Potter’s hand and got off the hippogriff, but smiled back wanly and turned his face away.
Right now, Draco was wearing his newly tailored school uniform, kneeling on a L-shaped platform, supporting himself with his knees and elbows. Potter had specifically demanded him to hold the memory ball in both hands and look at it. Which was a shame because Potter pulled off that Gryffindor uniform so well. They didn’t use any de-aging potion today, as Draco felt it would bring back too many old memories. But seeing a twenty-seven-year-old Potter dressed in Gryffindor uniform didn’t make it better. And it’s not just all the right muscles and what he packs. Back in Hogwarts, Potter was seldom carefree. Understandable, anyone leading a group of minors, each with their own quirk, fighting lunatics and twisted politicians and opportunists would be. Plus, he had Draco at almost every corner of the castle giving him hard times with creativity. The paper crane for example, had a nice touch of romanticism in it. Now it seemed that Potter was no longer the young leader of a wolf gang on the rise, but a matured lone wolf, with a good grip on himself and the world. The uniform just made that contrast starker. He looked… casual but invincible. Not much could hurt the man he became anymore. It was enticing to see such a man do just about anything. If he didn’t demand Draco not to look, Draco wasn’t sure he could look away.
‘Every word and more.’ Potter said, then laughed a little, ‘Sorry about the fireworks though. Probably gave you some trouble.’
Potter wasn’t surprised by his hesitation, if anything, he seemed to enjoy Draco’s moment of torment, those green eyes vibrant, glinting with lights of pleasure — the man truly is a sadist. But Draco knew as well as Potter, that he is in a vulnerable position. The punishments were already close to his limits, he couldn’t afford to disobey or delay. In fact, Draco’s sure the only reason Potter hadn’t rushed him was because he was enjoying Draco kneeling on the ground, debating internally whether he should climb on his lap too much.
Thanks to Mika.
‘He might not.’ Draco said.
‘Let’s mark you up, shall we?’
‘No.’ Draco said, ‘That’s not it.’
The man smiled and patted Neville on the shoulder: ‘Relax. You are going to be a great father.’
Draco blushed hard at Potter’s words.
Harry slapped his arse again: ‘Say it again.’
Just get on with it for fuck’s sake! Draco shouted internally, but kept his mouth shut, settling with giving Potter a irritated look.
She looked at him, sighed, leaned down, and took Draco’s head on her knees even more gentle than moments before: ‘I heard a few things from Potter. I was
This year, he finally convinced those politicians and had been hired to plan the biggest event of the year for the Ministry of Magic. The Yule Ball. Planning such events would require coordination with the Auror department. For some classified reasons, this year’s event needed extra security, and the Ministry was being extra paranoid, asking to double check everything.
‘Come on; everyone’s waiting for you to start the game. I think Hermione has something nefarious planned for you.’
Right now, Draco was wearing only his tie, his hands bound and tied to a hook on the ceiling. Potter was cruel enough to hang him high above the ground, and he could only support himself by navigating the broom —— a Nimbus 2000 for Morgana’s sake, where did he even find such an old model?
‘Oh, relax.’ Draco complained, ‘It’s not like I don’t know you and Blaise fuck every chance you get.’
Neville laughed as the man discreetly ran his hand over Draco’s still sore arse before pulling Draco into his embrace and warned: ‘
‘Draco.’ Potter said, backed away a bit as Draco pushed his wand forward, his eyes shimmering with every word, ‘For what it’s worth, I never lied to you.’
He hoped he could be of some comfort, but he didn’t have much experience, and never considered himself good at it.
He then tilted his head, taking a moment as if admiring the view: ‘You do look exceptionally good on your knees. Maybe you should do that more often.’
Mother had long accepted Draco was gay——earlier than he was ready to tell her, actually. After the war, all she ever wanted was for him to be safe and happy. If anything, she could tell he was…cold, like a snake left out in the snow, freezing to death bit by bit. She had mentioned carefully once or twice that he should find someone nice for himself, but Draco had been too caught up in his mess with Potter. They never actually talked about being exclusive, but somehow from some point, Potter kept a polite distance from everyone. It’s not just there’s no evidence of him being with anyone else, but there had been this prosecutor, young, handsome, funny and blonde, totally Potter’s type, overtly showed his interest in Potter, but Potter had turned him down. Again it wasn’t something Potter asked of him, but it felt natural, their frequency of sex life was content to Draco, and it felt like too much work to break in with someone else, and…there were a lot of reasons Draco could list, but really, he didn’t want to hurt their delicate balance.
‘Well, go on!’ Draco pointed to the door, ‘I was enjoying the road trip with my boyfriend before you two barged in.’
Draco hesitated, and the man got it immediately: ‘Go get your gear, I’ll leave the door open.’
Slowly he looked up at their family heraldry.
‘We are not.’ Potter said, then he wrapped the belt around his hand a few rounds and raised it.
Draco gasped tearfully, but talked back nonetheless: ‘You said something about taking pleasure?’
‘Your tourniquet definitely saved his life.’ Ziegler commented.
Draco cried out and failed to support himself by his arms, and the balls slammed against his prostate hard before Potter caught him by his waist and supported him so he wouldn’t get hurt. He felt his vision blurr for a second, his body went tense and limp at the same time, his orgasm again pressed close and forced backwards. He broke out a few sobs, begging under his breath: ‘I sorry… Sir please, I need… Potter, I can’t…’
‘I want to be your bitch!’ Draco almost screamed, ‘Please, Harry, please. I want you, please…’
Draco just nodded. Potter stroked his hair twice before he left to get ready, and returned quickly with a crystal plug from the set: ‘Might not be entirely appropriate, same with the ring, but I don’t want to use anything less on you —— assume your position for me?’
‘Hannah! It’s James.’ Neville said quickly, ‘You know,
Draco felt embarrassed, but he didn’t want to let go: ‘Listen, I know we’re not friends or anything. You probably didn’t even like me. But… I’m sorry someone did that to you when you were so little. They shouldn’t have done that. You didn’t deserve that. Nobody deserves that. I… I don’t know. I…’
Draco’s handwriting was trained by his father’s cane. He could write beautifully with his eyes closed or half asleep, proven by the nights before deadlines back in Hogwarts. Except from needing his wand to repair the scratch on the parchment, he did his lines perfectly.
Draco bit down on his lip. This really is a bad idea. But when he found out about this dungeon, he just couldn’t resist.
He could feel the Omega melting and tensing up at the same time, attacked and didn’t know how to deal with this unfamiliar pleasure, he was afraid bucking his hips would hurt Harry somehow, and was trying every might not to do so, but he couldn’t simply hold himself still, not when Harry was sucking him so hard, swirling his tongue and licking at the veins under his shaft.
‘I was in love with Potter.’
It’s a half-truth, and he could tell Potter knew that. Instead of calling it out or pushing him, Potter just said: ‘Okay. So, what do you think will happen if I don’t respond to your revenge?’
‘No you may not! You are not allowed to do anything, anything, you get me?’ Draco almost clawed at the invisible magical wall, ‘Because you are stupid! Even your fucking name is stupid; what kind of wizard name their kid Harry?! It’s a stupid name for you. And I hate your stupid glasses. Your stupid hair. They… they cover your eyes.’
Slowly, he looked up at Draco; it must be what, an hour since the torture started? Because the effect of the polyjuice was fading, revealing the horrifying burning scars underneath, and the familiar face of his friends for years.
Draco sat up straight on the bed, nodded as a greeting; father didn’t react at first, then he simply floated a black velvet box to Draco: ‘I believe… I believe you are the rightful owner of these.’
Draco shrugged, but took her advice and excused himself from the gathering of Doms nonetheless to splash some cold water on his face.
‘Well,’ The man said slowly, ‘We were just there.’
He really wishes right now that he had settled things with Potter earlier, went back to his routine of reporting every meal to Potter, so at least Potter would know Draco was missing when he saw Draco missed breakfast and came to bring Draco his homemade brunch.
Draco shut his eyes for a second, and took a deep breath. Something he smelled felt familiar among the cheery holiday scent of cedar, eggnog and bakeries, and it comforted him. He shakily reached out his hand, and had to bite down on his lip when Potter took his hand firmly in his warm hand.
‘What was this about?’ Draco asked irritated.
‘Deal?’ He saw Potter smiling mischievously, and somehow, timidly at the same time, his thick eyelashes draped over his eyes as if he couldn’t look Draco in the eyes.
Draco closed his eyes. Crabbe lost everything. If he were ever found alive by the wizarding world, he would be confined in Azkaban for the rest of his life or even get kissed, and even if he managed to escape to muggle society, he could hardly have a life with scars like that. His life was at a dead-end when his mother died three years ago —— she must have kept him hidden and taken care of him all those years, didn’t have the heart to lock her wounded son in Azkaban, and trusted him to her best friend, Mrs. Rosier, after her death.
When he got back to his apartment, he found a group of Aurors led by Forgecount trying to open his door.
He sounded too serious, and Draco asked: ‘Why are you so attached to it?’
Out of arousal, absolutely, but there’s also something else; the word ‘Mark’ was usually associated with bite mark to the back of an Omega’s neck made by an Alpha, the mark left permanently there when the Alpha delivered his magic and scents into the Omega’s gland, marking them as theirs, and the scents of the Omega would forever change into the combination of the two.
name. And you’ve made it a good name.’
‘Very well.’ Potter stood back and cast a spell, with the number ‘1000’ appeared in front of Draco’s eyes. He struck once so the number would turn to ‘999’ to show Draco that it was a count down, ‘Raise your tail, and it will begin.’
‘You did well.’ Potter said briefly.
‘Yeah.’ Draco flinched a little, ‘Father thought so too. Since I already learned everything beforehand, there’s no reason I couldn’t best everyone else. I get ten strikes for every subject I didn’t come up top in. Which I guess is a great part why I hated Granger so much and jumped at the first chance to make her life worse.’
Rosier looked at Draco, evaluating: ‘You are bluffing.’
‘Stealing my friends now, pet?’
Draco feared just looking at it, and the first strike almost tipped him over if he hadn’t grabbed on the rails hard in advance. Potter gave him as long as he needed to adjust, but that was it. He didn’t stroke Draco’s hair, didn’t kiss him or comfort him in any way. Draco wasn’t sure which hurt more, the heavy cane or the cold demeanor. He wanted so much to be able to plead and beg for intimacy and comfort, but doing so in front of the crowd probably wouldn’t bode well. In pain and longing, Draco sobbed through the entire five strikes, shaking uncontrollably.
Potter didn’t say anything.
Potter read it.
Among the chaos, Harry felt Hermione's hand on the back of his, her voice soft as a feather: 'You will also have yours one day, Harry.'
But he felt hurt and didn’t want to move.
you are giving me a headache.’
He missed the man at aftercare. He knew the man didn’t like him at the beginning, but he was such a nice man. Self-deception or not, he thought the man had actually begun to care about him, and maybe like him. He wanted that. He wanted the man to stroke his hair, to run his fingers gently across his shoulders and down his back.
This was a particularly difficult chapter for me, and it took me a long time to try to get it right. I hope you guys will stay with me for the future chapters.
Draco lowered his head at Potter’s chastise. Maybe it was because the man was a good dom, he played that grudge-holding role surprisingly convincing, and he reprimanded Draco right on the spot. Draco felt so ashamed of himself as he tried to escape what he deserve again like the irresponsible child he was, and forced himself to apologise: ‘I’m sorry, sir. I… I will not do that again.’
‘Something happened?’ Potter asked quietly, supporting the weight of himself and most of Draco with one hand, and held Draco close with the other.
‘Merlin, can’t a guy get some beauty sleep in the morning? Kind of need that to keep this butterfly in my spider net.’ Blaise came into the room wearing only a dark green silk pants, combed his fingers through his bedroom hair, walked up behind Pansy, leaned down and kissed her, Draco have to say he looked handsome smiling so lazily and indulgent, not as much as Potter though, ‘And I worked really hard last night.’
‘What is your real name,’ he repeated, ‘I believe your real name will help me break the fantasy, thus suitable to be my safe word.’
Forgecount just pulled out his wand: ‘Mr. Malfoy. You will need to come with us.’
‘Right.’ Draco’s tone was definitely acerbic, ‘Father made the same connection. With that and Granger, I didn’t sit well for the whole break. To be fair, Dumbledore would have given the House Cup to Gryffindor anyway. He would add ten thousand points to Longbottom for all he cares. Any other comment to rub it in?’
Nothing had changed. Nothing had improved. It even got worse as the war justified people’s hatred and rage. Even McGonagall felt frustrated as the students caught bullying the Slytherins often lost their parents or siblings in the war. It’s not that Harry didn’t want to do something about it, he of all people least believed in all people from Slytherin were evil, but it’s somehow a lot more difficult than defeating the dark lord.
Draco crumpled the man’s shirt: ‘Can’t be his friend. Can’t see his face. I just…can’t.’
Draco’s heart stopped at that, and started pondering his chest hard: ‘Um, what?’
That’s not really exaggerating. Guess he’s slipping.
with his right hand, but all Aurors had previous anti-spells to that; even Potter couldn’t disarm him without his wand and his magic flow restricted.
Harry had protested, but Draco managed to squash it as he had taken full charge of their wardrobe and presented him with a fine-tailored robe that’s actually comfortable to wear. After all, not every headmaster wear weird nightgowns, and even Dumbledore pulled off quite a few suits back in the days.
Draco complied.
‘Yes yes yes. Now go away.’ Draco pointed at the door, ‘You make a horrible door stop.’
‘I guess I just have a really low standard for you after all these years. I consider you complimenting Mione a win.’ Weasley shrugged, ‘And to be fair, you had been more than polite before I provoked you.’
Draco was really good at picking up the flaws in people’s words: ‘Him? You were gay?’
The hallway was indeed empty. Everyone was having fun in the party room. And where Potter took him was just one door down.
‘How was…’ Draco asked immediately.
Potter just nodded.
Draco could hardly feel his physical pain right now. Potter was coming. To the Yule Ball he was planning. He never came to any of the Yule Balls before. That must be why the Aurors were so…
You wouldn’t know how cunning he could be in bed. Sometimes it was like a high-end chess game fucking with the man, one slip, and it would be a fiasco. That being said, it’s always pleasant to lose. He only wondered why the man was so bad at Wizarding chess——then again, he never really tried very hard with chess, let Ron have something to be proud of, perhaps.
‘Have me beheaded. I’m not worshipping you.’
‘Came to rub it in, Malfoy?’
‘I even wanted to stay away; I tried cancelling our appointments, but then you… Merlin, you came, and you told me you were in love with me.’
‘I kind of scheduled a dinner with Granger; I hope you don’t mind.’ Draco said as he looked into those emerald eyes, ‘It might be a bit stupid to explain, but, I’m not a blood supremacist. Rather, I find any discrimination based on what people are born with ridiculous. I don’t think father is a blood supremacist either; he just chose to use it to maximise benefits for himself. And I chose not to walk that path.’
Draco already knew this was a gigantic room of requirement, he just didn’t realize exactly how gigantic, because the man just tapped the floor and a downward stair appeared, leading to a bloody
‘Aaaaand GOAL!’ Came the recorded voice of Lee Jordan during the past game, ‘Gryffindor is now a hundred and twenty points ahead of Slytherin! Their only chance at winning is catching the snitch!’
‘To tell you I have not just been the owner of a sex dungeon for the past ten years?’ Harry said as he pushed open the door, ‘And something else.’
They had finished most of Hogwarts so far, that’s how he knew Potter was a hatstall, a Gryffindor-Slytherin hatstall in particular, but he got the feeling Potter was stalling for whatever they really needed to talk about.
He hadn't then, and he couldn't now.
And though he had a box full of his favourite desserts, Draco lost his appetite. The man leaned down and kissed him, his voice as soft as possible, and his frown wrinkled Draco’s heart: ‘Please believe me, that there’s nothing I want in the world more than I want you to be happy, and I hope I can be the person that makes you happy. Please remember this.’
‘I took it a little too far. If you want to be able to sleep tonight and walk tomorrow —— it’s six o’clock now so maybe sleep this morning and walk this afternoon, I need to heal you a little.’ When the man spoke, it was about something unrelated, and as Draco didn’t protest, he held Draco close and chanted a spell, something ancient and powerful, all that’s left behind was the most pleasant amount of reminder for Draco.
Not that it's a bad thing, no. She's just——She's just pregnant. It happened as an accident, a bit reckless for someone like Hermione, but they all thought for a while they wouldn't be able to make it through the war. She couldn't even pinpoint the time it happened, surprised by it when she went to St. Mangos to check out her weird rut periods.
Potter slowly woke up, his emerald eyes watery and confused, but lit up the moment he saw Draco; it almost shattered Draco’s resolution. He sat up straight, confused as he said: ‘What…’
Draco broke out a sob but nodded, and down came the last strike, particularly ruthless, the entire length of the riding crop landed in his cleft, painting it pink, the poor red little pucker spasmed in pain but blossomed beautifully as if an immature dainty rose, shining as it’s wet, outright inviting.
It felt different, and interesting, flying by the hippogriff rather than a broom. Draco was curious and thrilled at first, looking around as they were over the tree line.
Then his eyes lit up, and the man smiled.
Well, the funny thing was, even back when they thought they were hated by each other, a life debt didn’t seem like much. If fate did keep a ledger on that, it would be a tangled mess between the two.
Draco was surprised: ‘You know James back in school?’
‘That’s just how he likes them —— Emerald, always up for a challenge, training a brat, or care for the needed.’ Came Ruby's sexy voice, ‘Besides, you all think that sub is cute, didn’t you?’
‘Or the dates you went on,’
‘What reason?’ Rosier pressed.
Unfortunately, the event started with various tedious speeches from ministry officials, starts with the minister,down the ladder, and then McGonagall.
Thanks to Mika for proofreading.
Draco was exhausted by now, so the man showered him and addressed his wounds as quickly as possible, put the collar on Draco and settled Draco in the bed. Draco wasn’t sure how he arranged it, but he then went to get breakfast for Draco. After Draco filled himself with French toast, the man helped him brush his teeth, so Draco didn’t need to get out of the bed, then got on the bed and held Draco close, gently playing with Draco’s furry ear.
Potter ran his hand down his back, checking Draco for one more time, then landed the last three strikes in rapid succession, so it’s easier on Draco. Draco screamed, his hands lost its grip, only stayed in place because he was chained there tight.
‘Wait
‘Wizengarmout had problems with him for a long time now. They wanted him to be under their control, but he refused to be an Auror under their command, and him consorting with an ex-death eater like you? That’s the perfect excuse.’ Rosier said, his face contempt, ‘Frankly, it wasn’t hard to trick him into accepting it without Granger doing the thinking for him, and your life on the line.’
How Pansy was a good friend. And everyone got on the train.
It really was an exquisite and elegant set, with the right amount of lively and mischievousness. Draco couldn’t help but ran his thumb over the flapping wings that were trying to get his attention but shook his head: ‘It’s um, it’s present from another man. That man is sort of tangled in our relationship. I don’t think it would be appropriate. I wanted tomorrow to be about him and him only.’
Most of the Headmaster portraits were empty, presumably to give Potter some privacy when he talked to Dumbledore earlier, except for Dumbledore, of course, the old man wearing his ridiculous starry blue robe that always made Draco feel uncomfortable with his observant eyes, was looking at them curiously. Draco tried his best to ignore him because he felt guilty and couldn’t just tell Dumbledore to take a walk.
‘More like started sleeping.’ Draco said, the tip of his finger tracing the rim of his cup of black coffee——they really need something to balance all the cakes they were tasting, ‘Whenever he contacted me about a case. Mostly pro-Bono or when he felt the defendant was wronged by the existing laws.’
It felt like an empty prize to win.
Harry shrugged, and Malfoy looked down as he started cleaning their work station, his faded eyelashes flickering just a little: ‘Because no one will believe me even if I tell anyone?’
The note said.
‘I can’t do it.’ Draco said abruptly.
Draco did as he was told, raised his arse up high, parted his arse cheeks and revealed his bright pink, shining wet hole, then felt Harry’s heavy cock line up, with no further preparation or lubricant. Draco panicked for a moment and felt Harry holding him down by the back of his neck: ‘Easy my pet; we have been playing for a while now, you must know you can take me right? Don’t you want a little pain? To feel me splitting you open, even days after? And you know I want it, I want to feel your tight virgin hole sucking my cock, even in pain, because that’s how good you are as my bitch, no?’
Draco looked into those warm emerald eyes, nodded hesitantly.
‘No, sorry. I can’t do anything to another Dom’s room.’ The fake Potter said apologetically, ‘Um… But I think I can try to contact him for you. Would you… would you like to wait in my room before he comes? I can fix you hot cocoa or something.’
Draco couldn’t help but locked his thighs around Harry’s head, his fingers buried in and pulled at that messy black hair, Harry groaned at the pain, slapped Draco’s arse and thrust his tongue deeper into his hole, fucking faster as retaliation.
‘No.’ He said.
The man looked in the same direction and laughed: ‘No. Those weren’t mine. This used to be Dudley’s toy room before I moved in. Petunia tried to move all of his old toys into my cupboard but failed. So a few of them stayed with me.’
Draco looked up at the man, confused.
Potter wasn’t angry, just nodded, encouraging Draco to keep talking; Draco breathed out, looked down and said: ‘I felt… hurt. I’m not sure what I would do, but I just… I don’t know, like you said, I guess I slipped back into our old habit. I just want to leave a bite mark, not caring what you’ll do to me in return.’
The man looked at Draco for one last time, wiped his hand over his face, and the glamour was there, he was again the handsome green-eyed man named Harry Potter, his emerald eyes shone so brightly from the moonlight reflected from the snow as if a predatory wolf. Draco wouldn’t admit, but his heart leapt at that, and he wouldn’t think about it, just leaned in for another kiss, the man kissed him back feverishly, picked him up, wound Draco’s legs around his waist and kicked open the door.
If only they have…
Potter chuckled, his fingertip tapped at the tip of Draco’s cock, just to show Draco he knew Draco’s leaking precum already, and Draco felt his cheeks burning hot.
Potter paused, then answered: ‘Three. Before that was a healing spell, then another floating spell.’
?’ Draco blushed fiercely and looked at Potter with disbelief.
Draco was pulling his shirt on, leaving as they were finished for the night, when he heard Potter say: ‘Do you have an age of panic?’
He panted, gasping for air, blinking his sweat away from his eyelashes, fighting for his eyes to focus.
The wand came, but it went directly to Harry bloody Potter for whatever reason, Potter managed to catch it, and with one smooth sway, Rosier was disarmed. At his moment of surprise, an incarceration spell shot from the now very conscious Forgecount bonded him, and he fell to the ground, immobile at last.
The man still looked confused, so Draco explained to him goodheartedly: ‘That girl was in love with a fake image of the perfect Potter, fame, fortune, power, a hero, the great Saviour, the invincible Auror, the list go on and on. I bet you she dreamed of being Mrs. Potter all her life when she doesn’t have a fucking clue what kind of person Potter is. She wanted Potter to become the perfect man she imagined, not knowing what it means to Potter, or that if you love someone, you love who they really are and stay by their side up and down. I feel sorry for her, and for Potter. She was confused, and Potter deserved better, someone who understands he’s just human, and indulge his quirks. Father had his many flaws, but he was a hell of a lucky bastard to have mother’s love, and he knows to appreciate her.’
How he had looked at Draco the first time, they met —— the cold emerald eyes, how he grabbed Draco’s hair and threw him into the table, how he taunted Draco at his fear and pain, how he was reluctant to do the aftercare.
Ohhh isn’t this a bad idea.
The man laughed: ‘The last time you saw him play was more than a decade ago. It’s not fair to make such a comparison.’
‘Well, I need to be perfectly sure.’ the man smiled a little wickedly, then looked down on the parchment, ‘I see here that you didn’t give a safe word, was it because you are new to the dom/sub ritual and don’t have one, or…’
‘Which is?’ Draco helped Pansy to the floo, dropping her coat on her shoulders.
Draco breathed out shakily.
Potter slapped his arse particularly hard, and he was coming, just by rubbing off on Potter’s thigh, and making a terrible mess there.
Draco almost went crazy at that, and the chatters were flowing in again: ‘Awww they are doing it again!’
‘Not sure. Dumbledore once told me that out of Voldemort and me, I would eventually win, because there’s a room in the Department of Mysteries that I had all, and he had none.’ Harry said as he reached out a finger for one of the furry balls to land, ‘He never said which room, but this room would be my best guess. This is one of the least researched rooms in the department; they know next to nothing about it, they couldn’t even determine what this room was, some think it’s the room of love, others say it’s the room of hope, and others say it’s the room of selfless, and a few other ideas too —— touch one. Feel for yourself.’
‘Thirteen little demons brought straight from hell, yes.’ Draco said as he gracefully cast a cleaning spell to rid any soot, ‘Harry?’
Draco and the man talked about Draco’s feelings a little. Christmas at the manor. Plot.
Potter smiled and pulled an album from his pocket. He ran his hand over it cherishingly, placed it on the table and pulled Draco into his arms. He kissed the side of Draco’s neck lightly then opened it——they were pictures of his parents.
Thanks to Mika.
‘Aha! You also said Slytherins don’t do divorce.’
‘Er, good for him.’ Draco couldn’t think of why Luna would talk to him about Potter’s desire at fatherhood, but then again, nothing the girl said ever made any sense, so he’s just rolling with it, ‘He shouldn’t. As long as he devotes time and care, he should make a great father.Some things are just out of his hands. People who love him would understand.’
As Draco downed his cocktail, he spared a glance at Potter, silver eyes cold as if he couldn’t care less but provocative in the way a younger Potter wouldn’t be able to bear a second.
Draco went still.
‘Merlin your cooking is
‘Yes, sir.’ Draco felt better and breathed out, ‘I apologise, sir.’
How he could be so calm was beyond Draco. Or maybe he wasn’t really very calm, because Draco really couldn’t see Potter clearly with all those tears in his eyes. He tried to wipe them away, but there’s just too many of them falling too fast.
‘I need to go.’
‘There wasn’t.’ The man said.
Draco somehow got it. This must be why Ruby was worried Potter had commitment issues. Rosier was different; he was from work; they probably started off knowing Potter was Potter, but just as hookups, so Rosier was fascinated at first, by the powerful and perfectly in control Potter, but when they tried it outside of the setting of a dungeon, Rosier didn’t like Potter as his awkward self. But then, it was Rosier who couldn’t deal with breaking up with the famous Harry Potter.
Draco’s heart… let’s say shuddered at that. Then he got even angrier, as that bastard had the balls to look hurt after everything he did.
’ Draco said with widened eyes, ‘Merlin you weren’t kidding when you said you could pass as a house elf.’
Pansy flattened a crease on Draco’s shoulder, asked as she looked into those clear silver eyes through the mirror.
But it never landed.
Draco held the back of the man’s neck, leaned in until they were forehead against forehead, his wand slowly pointed under the man’s chin, then whispered against the man’s lips: ‘Do you trust me?’
Draco looked to the man curiously, but someone else took it harder, Weasley was visibly pale even with the mask on, just got pulled into the seat by Hermione numbly: ‘Malfoy? Malfoy is your plus one?’
‘…So what do we do?’
Draco remained still, in case it was just a bluff, but a second kidnapper added: ‘The effect of the stunning spell should be over by now. Shall I test it with a Crucio?’
The man arched his brow: ‘Yes, tomorrow. Oh —— you didn’t read the punishment clause?’
Potter kissed him, walked over, looked through the peephole, and then opened the door shielding Draco with his body, his voice a bit surprised: ‘Ruby? What are you here for?’
Potter laughed a little, Draco looked up in surprise at that, Potter just smiled: ‘Sorry —— It’s fine. I think it’s very cute somehow, not that I encourage that kind of behaviour, no. I’m just surprised myself; I used to be…’
The man laughed, ran his hand through his brown hair and said with a sigh: ‘Like I’ve been cuckolding myself?’
Draco froze and looked back at Potter; Potter blushed hard, his eyes bright as stars, pinned Draco to where he was standing.
‘May I?’ Potter asked, his emerald eyes misted from being drunk.
But after he carefully opened the wrapping, the present shook and enlarged itself as the shrinking charm was lifted. It was quite a big camphor wood box that Draco recognised as from high-end clothing.
The man narrowed his eyes: ‘What did I say about disobedience Malfoy?’
He made a beautiful decoration for the man’s lap.
Potter froze for a second, he then looked up at Draco, and in Draco’s eyes, he saw a dangerous flirtation, the one Draco always displayed when he challenged Potter, well prepared to destroy Potter, it was honey on a sharp blade, and it drew and cut Potter every time.
Draco walked up to it, raised his hand but was still hesitant, the next moment; he widened his eyes as Potter took his hand and placed it on Buckbeak’s forehead.
‘You said you were Gryffindor, and you are a great flyer.’ Draco said, ‘Just making sure I’m not shagging a Weasley or something. I don’t remember any James Weasley, but there’s so many of them it’s really hard to keep track. You are not a Weasley, are you?’
Then, he said: ‘Now the punishment can begin.’
Going to the wall once was an accident, twice was a coincidence, but the third? The fourth? Harry couldn’t just lie to himself and say it wasn’t intentional. After the fourth time he fucked the Omega, he held that pale hand in his and asked: ‘I know you won’t be rutting, but will you come back tomorrow, just for me?’
That did change Potter’s mind. But instead of pulling it down, Potter wedged it between Draco’s arsecheeks and used it as leverage to hold Draco steady, but his hand was smacking on Draco’s bare arse nonetheless. Exceptionally hard two times, probably to punish Draco for cursing.
He could feel Potter’s eyes on him the entire time, exhilarating like burning magic around him when he dives with a broom.
‘You sure he wanted to marry you?’ Pansy asked quietly.
‘Well fuck you too, not literally, though.’ Draco retorted.
They played late, till the sky was dark blue and stars shone brightly alongside the beautiful moon.
Potter was only too happy to comply, this time indulging Draco to come as many times as he could, and frankly, Draco’s second orgasm was so close to the third they could be just one, but then it would be an incredibly long orgasm, and he shot an insane amount of cum.
Draco could try to lie, but he definitely knew the answer. He would keep escalating until he gets the intended reaction from Potter, just like in fourth year, when the badges didn’t work, he taunted Potter face to face, and when Potter walked away from that, he pulled his wand to Potter’s back. He would hurt Potter, and himself, to the point of no return.
Draco completely forgot the shame of Potter’s hand ghosting, brushing and stroking around his arsehole, and the few slaps he got there had a different sting, having him moaning and whimpering. He rutted into Potter’s thigh almost frantically, all sense of self and morality thrown out of some window, he just needed a little more —
Potter caught his hand and pulled him back, and Draco’s eyes widened. The motion was too severe that the silver ball shifted and fell out, the cum the man filled him with leaked out and wet his silk underwear. Draco looked back unbelievably, but those emerald eyes were looking at him with hard determination, even though the ring was burning again, and his hand was shaking in pain, he managed to say: ‘Please think…’
It was the first time Draco was ever fucked, he had always imagined he would be too sore for anymore after it, especially as Harry fucked him so hard, but it just felt it didn’t get enough, it wasn’t satisfied.
Draco’s arse was beginning to show a faint shade of crimson, any wrong move and bruising would be a certainty. Potter stroked the abused flesh for a while, before taking the tail in his hand and struck again.
‘I already forgave you.’ Draco tried every wandless breaking spell he knew.
He said, running his other hand through the soft, thick fur on Draco’s tail —— Merlin he had a tail now, flawlessly snowy white, not a single miscellaneous hair —— and it sent sparks right up his spine, making him moan. Draco could swear that tail was more sensitive than his cock.
But his wrist suddenly burned bright red and Potter quickly grabbed his forearm and gasped in pain, a ring of thread-like magic appeared around his wrist, and it was searing into his flesh as if red hot iron.
The letter was still trying to ask questions, but Draco got up, pulled open the door and yelled: ‘Elise! Sift through my mail and
Due to his reputation as a defense lawyer and his tendency to use loopholes in the current laws to help his clients, the Malfoy name was once more tarnished though their vaults where once more overflowing.
Draco stumbled to keep his stand, but he knew he was beyond the range of the protective charms. The Dementors lunged at him with whatever extent of excitement possible for them, and all Draco could do was look up at them with widened frightened eyes.
‘Uh, you have something against the Weasley family?’ The man asked.
to be teased.
Was…was Potter flirting with him?
’ Pansy exclaimed, the fork in her hand stabbed through the slice of chocolate cake, made squeaking sounds on the plate, ‘Draco Abraxas Malfoy! I thought we were friends!’
Buckbeak wasn’t aware, he just snorted and bowed down, inviting them to get on for a fly.
Crabbe closed his eyes and smiled a weak smile.
The past two months hadn’t been easy for the both of them. Vincent Crabbe, due to the arson was committed as a minor, no one was injured by the neo-death eaters in the earlier Weasley residence attack, and most of the other things were done by Rosier, plus the mitigating factor that he turned himself in and helped save Draco and Harry in time, and that Draco hired a damn good lawyer, was placed in the new prison guarded by actual humans rather than Dementors. On the other hand, Rosier, hopefully, no one will ever see him out and running for the rest of his life.
The man’s eyes darkened, his fully erect cock pressing against Draco’s thigh, distracting Draco even more. Draco thought hard, but came up with nothing. The man provided: ‘You were angry with me. I admit that addressing the problem directly with me wouldn’t have done you a lot of good back then, but try that next time. And maybe you shouldn’t take it out on someone else.’
Draco laughed and looked to the breakfast tray in the man’s hand; it had pancakes, french toast, bacon and eggs, an omelette, a cup of milk and a cup of orange juice on it.
‘Um, let’s put it this way ——’ the man said as he looked at the back of his hand, ‘I dated Ginny, and it didn’t work out.’
Before Draco could protest, she stopped pressing, turned to leave as she lifted the privacy charm: ‘Emerald, darling, sorry for the interruption. Do you best with your lovely pet, will you?’
Bit by bit, Potter started experimenting with Draco what life after their wedding might be like, and Draco just loved him more and more, to the point he would startle awake at night, found Potter soundly asleep next to him, and he would watch for a long time, his heart a bubble floating in moonlight, iridescent and vulnerable.
Draco yelped but didn’t stop snickering: ‘You don’t need to be so devoted to your job. That’s the exact replica of the Gryffindor dorm.’
He said as he tilted his head, the resplendent green of his eyes shone through his long and heavy eyelashes, without the shield of glasses, it almost yanked Draco’s heart.
‘Good for you.’ Draco pursed his thin lips to a tight line at the use of his first name, stubbornly ignored the tingling feeling it brought to him and retorted. But he couldn’t help but looked up and found the man’s eyes mild as spring lake under the sun. Suddenly, he couldn’t look away.
this?’
He smacked Draco’s arse hard this time, enjoying the view as Draco cried out in pain, his arse tensing and tilted to the side, it took a while for him to relax trembling.
‘Which is it?’ Draco forced out as the wand settled on his throat, ‘You can either be the so-called neo-death eater devoted to the dead psycho, or in Potter’s fan club. You can’t be both.’
It took a while for Draco to realise something didn’t feel right. He knew the man vanished the belt to make sure he would feel safe. But that seemed a little extreme. And of course he couldn’t forget what the man told him about his childhood.
should have been Gryffindor’s seeker. He never went through draft, just got specially appointed. You would have beaten him at that.’ Draco insisted. ‘
Draco glanced at Forgecount, but resigned and whispered: ‘It’s… it’s the golden arrowbees. I think I saw them.’
The two in Hogwarts uniform. Interesting toy. Hoist to the ceiling. Broom. Something.
Crabbe could barely get up to his feet, but he wouldn’t leave, just looked at Draco, and Draco nodded: ‘Go. You know I’m smarter than you, and you have always listened to me, right? Go. I can take care of myself —— I’m sorry, for a lot of things —— just go.’
The man lowered his head: ‘Sorry.’
The man was quiet again. Draco wanted to take back his question, but before he could, the man answered: ‘If it’s any comfort, yes. I grew up in a foster home, the people who raised me… let’s just say, I would make a decent house elf. The kind that would fit right in with the ones working on the Malfoy manor, by what I heard. The only difference would be, the household I grew up in favoured belt over cane. Quite a long and heavy one I’m afraid. A weapon of opportunity mostly, he was a big man.’
Draco walked in.
On his way up, he thought that maybe years later, he would still remember the feeling of ascending those stairs.
He lowered his head, trying to conceal his reaction, but Potter had of course caught on to it, and narrowed his eyes: ‘As pretty as you are, Malfoy, I’ll still punish you if you are being a bad boy.’
And now, would be the perfect chance of his revenge.
The Omega didn’t know what Harry was doing, and was startled when Harry gave his shaft a lick, then took it all the way down his throat.
It’s good to see her finally moving on and truly happy too.
‘That’s a rather big mistake, even for you, Potter.’ Draco teased, ‘That’s going to be seen as rude at my birthday party. I thought I taught you better.’
Harry stilled at the use of his first name, then skillfully stuck the tip of his tongue into the opening of his urethra, giving it a tactical flick and Draco came again, white fireworks went off that he couldn’t think or move for a moment.
‘Of course! Who didn’t!’ Pansy said with a weird tone, while the man looked tense and resigned, ‘I just didn’t recognise him at first. After all, he looked a bit different since school.’
‘I don’t need to.’ Rosier said, green light-condensing at the tip of his wand, ‘No matter how strong Harry is, he can’t be faster with my wand at your throat. I just have to persuade him into stepping into that magic circle over there.’
Somehow, he made the dirty word sound fond.
The man saw him and waited with his arms open, he caught Draco and held him tight in his embrace.
To top it up, the ministry official he’s been working with, Mr. Sugarball, was late. The Auror assigned to the Yule Ball security detail was Auror Forgecount, a rather silent and built man, never said one word that wasn’t absolutely necessary. They sat in awkward silence and waited, but Draco suspected the reason Forgecount didn’t greet him was not he wasn’t talkative.
‘You would check me into a loony bin before believing me that he was Potter.’ Pansy shrugged, ‘And it wasn’t my place to tell you.’
And he never will.
Sugarball wiped his face with a handkerchief and introduced nervously: ‘This is Mr. Malfoy. The planner of the Yule Ball. This is Mr. Weasley. Mr. Potter’s personal security contractor.’
At first the man thought it was because of the fierce orgasm that ripped through Draco, but he soon realised that was not the case. Draco was biting down hard on his lips, tears streaming down his cheeks.
Normally this would be the part where he tries to knock Potter off the broom, but he was not interested in that kind of physical contact now. The snitch shot up to the sky, and just when they both got really close, it took a nosedive straight to the ground, and they both followed, but it disappeared as they both had to make a steep turn to avoid crashing to the ground.
The man smiled, put the pastries on the table, held him close and kissed back.
Harry called after him, but he didn't listen. He had to leave and he had to leave quickly.
He always found Harry's wild hair incredibly charming and his bright green eyes mesmerizing. But it seemed different now. He couldn't put his finger on it. Harry looks down at something, but Draco doesn't stop to think about what he's looking at until he feels a hand grab his own.
"I'll meet you in the dorm, I have to speak to Pansy." Blaise says, a stern look prominent on his face despite his calm tone.
Blaise looks up at him and grins like an idiot. "I'm in love with Neville Longbottom!" He says louder. He seems to be in surprise. "I am! Ha!" He says, smiling even wider.
"Yeah, yeah. Voldemort is dead." Harry says. Ron smiles and so does everyone else around, except Harry.
"How long did you feel this way about him?" Draco asks.
"I don't want professional help! I'll just be thrown into the hospital!" Draco exclaims.
"Sorry." They both say, sitting down on the couch in front of him.
"W-what do you mean?" He asks nervously.
Harry's face gets closer to his. "I... I wanna kiss you... Is that weird?" He whispers.
"Blaise!" He calls after.
His happiest memory had now changed, but he was hoping he wouldn't ever have to use it for a dementor again.
"Go on then. Get on the broom." Blaise says.
Snape pulls out his wand and gasps are heard all around the Hall. Professor McGongall steps forward, holding out her wand as well. Neville and the Order all raise their wands in defense.
"What? Why?" He asks.
Draco stares at him, not daring to answer. Unfortunately for him, that was enough of an answer for Blaise.
"You failed your task, Draco," Voldemort spoke. "Your father is very disappointed."
"No! I honestly just didn't want to break your heart by saying no." He lied partially. He didn't tell her about the part of wanting to forget about every moment he had with Draco.
Neville's POV:
"Alright... The password?" He asks.
Blaise clenches his fist, which somewhat calmed his nerves. "I'm still mad at you!"
Blaise nods, dips his fingers into the bottle and rubs the liquid all around the now cold golden bracelet.
All he does is stand there, his legs feeling suddenly weak.
He felt as if he was a child again and for once in his life he felt really happy. Not only because of the pie, but also because people had began to talk to him.
A small flame hit his arm and he screamed. He jerks it away and examines the injury. He takes a deep breath and feels his stress go away with every sting. It was bloody painful, but it was amazing.
He sat beside Blaise, willing for his eyes to stay on the board. Every now and then he'd glance at Blaise, which only made his thoughts from yesterday replay in his brain.
"Fine! But when he stabs you in the back don't come crying to us!" Ron shouts from behind me.
"Avada Kedavra." says Snape, no hesitation whatsoever. Draco almost gasps as he watches Dumbledore fall backwards, right off the side of the tower.
Neville Longbottom shakily made his way to Dumbledore's office. He had no idea what the password was. He actually asked Professor McGonagall thirty minutes earlier but managed to forget all about it. He didn't even have the faintest idea what it was!
"But you're a Slytherin... Slytherins don't l-like Gryffindors." Neville says.
"Look at me, you prat!" Blaise demands. Draco rolls his eyes but looks right at Blaise. His tough demeanor begins to fade. "I know you may not believe it, but you didn't do anything wrong. Yes, you accepted that lifestyle, but you did it to survive! We all forgive you. Well, at least Harry and his friends do. Including me! You were found not guilty. What other proof do you need?"
This surely was a dream.
"What?" Harry asks.
"Now-"
"It can be! Trust me, I've heard about it. Hermione helped me research it and I think I know how we can help you until we get you professional help."
Stumbling and threatening to fall over, he runs to the common room. "Holly berries!" He shouts, the door opening slowly and Draco bounces impatiently. He runs in as soon as he can.
"Maybe... I definitely could try." Blaise says, "Oh, uh, Neville I need to ask you something." Blaise mutters to him.
"Yeah... Uh, I am." Blaise says nonchalantly.
He stands there, shaking like mad. Soft whimpers escape his mouth.
"I will. I love you!" Blaise says with a big smile.
They both smirked at him and held up their wands. Voldemort took a step towards him.
"Thank you so much." Draco says, pulling Harry close to him and wrapping his arms around him.
She grabs his arm and he stares at her with wide-eyes, "And if I ever see you again, you will be arrested." She threatens, violently letting go of his arm. "Now get out of my house. Now!" She shouts.
"A hopeless, romantic little Hufflepuff. Whipped, as they say." Draco teases.
They sit in silence and listen to the sounds of nature. Blaise closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. Neville watches him intently and notes how he looks in the setting sun. His skin looked golden and as he opened his eyes, he noticed they looked golden as well.
"What are you on? Have you dranken any alcohol today?" Draco smirks.
His chest tightens. His father can't be dead! He never even had the chance to speak to him, to hear his voice! He can't be dead! This isn't true.
"Yes, father." Draco says, not taking his focus off every little thing he does. If he makes one mistake, he will leave here with another bruise. Or perhaps none at all, just a very very loud lecture. But that was wishful thinking.
"Ah, I see. Tea or perhaps coffee?" Dumbledore asks.
Neville nervously raises his hand. "Come up, Neville," Lupin says with a smile. Neville slowly makes his way to the front and stands in silence for a little.
"I... I'm sorry for waking you." Harry says.
He steps inside and stands in front of his father's desk, hands at his side and maintaining a good posture. He was taught this rule when he was six years old. Never ever have a bad posture, especially in public.
"You're really beautiful," Draco says. "Merlin, why can't I shut up?!" He shouts.
Next up, Draco Malfoy.
"Who was it?" Neville asks eagerly.
Malfoy follows him, trying to not think about how Harry Potter just saw his worst fear. How much did he see exactly?! He wonders. His heart then leaps again, only this time, he knew it was out of fear.
"I wish he told us he wet the bed." Crabbe says with a laugh.
"Down that hall to the left, dear." Molly says, pointing him in the right direction.
"Relax, Neville. You can tell me anything. It's a safe place here." Dumbledore says with a small smile.
Harry darts his eyes from her to his friends and says, "I'll talk to you guys later." He pushes past them and walks all the way to the bottom of the hall where no one would hear them.
"I uh... it wasn't too difficult." Neville chuckles nervously.
"You haven't already got a hint?" Blaise says, staring at him as if he grew two heads.
He swings the dorm room door open, "Hi, Blaise!" Crabbe shouts, "Wanna play Wizard's Chess?"
"Who cares? We can spread that around too! Right, Blaise?" Xavier says.
"Wait, did you tell Hermione?!" Draco asks, half in anxiety and the other in anger.
"So you do understand!" Neville says with a smile. Blaise doesn't reply, but instead pulls him into a tight hug.
"Ah... That must mean they're perhaps an enemy? Or perhaps... A Gryffindor?" Blaise guesses.
All of this was too much to take in for Blaise. Luckily for him, breakfast had soon ended and it was time to go to his first class. He didn't expect to see Neville, yet there he was staring straight at his desk.
The Dark Lord was very close to him, stepping closer every minute. He pressed his lips together at an attempt to keep them from shaking.
"Stand down, Neville!" Seamus says.
Harry stares at Blaise with wide eyes, "Uh... Not really undying. If Madame Pomfrey discovers what happened it'll be gone... Whatever it is. Wonder who spiked his drink." Harry says awkwardly.
- Ginny: Bisexual Biromantic
He watches Blaise land and tries to do it himself. Apparently he had gotten too confident. He falls off the broom and rolls across the meadow.
"Listen, I know Harry is with Ginny now but hey... Neville is with Hannah and I'm still sending him a gift. Just to see him smile. You want Harry to smile, right?" Blaise asks.
Harry frees his smile and leans on the wall behind him. Draco finds himself staring at him and Harry gives him a look of confusion.
They decide that they're finished and Blaise puts everything back into the basket other than the flowers and blanket.
He folds the blanket back up and looks inside again. The next thing that catches his eye is a bracelet. It was golden with a lions head right in the middle. He picked it up and examined it. Something about it intrigued him, not only that but it oddly enough made him feel at ease. Maybe it was simply a coincidence, but he didn't mind it.
She wishes it wasn't true and wishes she could find another logical explaination, but there simply isn't one. Neville didn't like her and he never will. Neville likes boys!
"You were gone a while." Harry states.
However, he knew he wouldn't always be able to escape it. There would always be a time when he was a laughing stock to the whole school, or even perhaps the whole wizarding world. It was saddening, but it was true. It was worthless to go and mope about it when it was all he would ever be. It's not like he'd find a woman and settle down and get a great job and be well-liked. That'd never happen. He was unattractive and unsuccessful. Everything he did he managed to fail at, especially potions. Trying was worthless, however, he still continued to try. How stupid of him. He was not only wasting his time but the time of every other person around him.
"That's terrible. But, again, I won't let anything happen to you. Not even what you can do to yourself. Which reminds me... We are going to get that sorted out, you know." Harry says.
He heard Harry shuffle across the room and glanced over to see his shirt just above his head. His back muscles seemed to become more defined as he stretched his arms above his head and laid the shirt beside him.
"I can't remember the password!" He complains softly, pulling at his hair. The more he thought about Blaise, the more his chest tightened.
"I love you too." Neville replies, his heart swelling up at the words. As he gets onto his broom, Blaise gives him another kiss and Neville's cheeks tint red. "I'll see you later." Neville says, kicking off and flying away.
He stops when he sees Draco sobbing. He's sobbing so violently he seems to almost choke at one point.
Both Madame Pomfrey and Neville gave him a quizzical look. "Yes, Mister Zabini?"
"I just wanted you to feel welcome." Maggie says sadly. "I know it's bad to go behind master Lucius's back, but I must, for you are also my master. I must punish myself after, but it's my duty either way."
"Ok then, you will get a hint. Here is one: I am not a Gryffindor nor am I a Hufflepuff. Also, there is a Z in my name, but you'll have to figure out if its in my first or last name. Also, we have talked before, but not too much. That's all I will give you for now. But don't stress over it too much. Besides, I'm probably not the best for you."
They walk away and Pansy overhears Luna say, "Oh, how wonderful is that?"
Draco's mind kept yelling at him to stop, that this was utter madness, but he couldn't. His body wanted more and he couldn't move away.
He steps up to the plate and grabs the knife. He cuts it perfectly and slides it onto his plate.
"On a broom?! He can fly?!" Draco asks in shock. "And he snuck out?! Either Neville is completely different than I thought or he's gone completely mad."
"It's alright, Blaise, you'll prove yourself soon enough. I really hate Gryffindors." Draco groans.
"Are you alright?" Neville asks.
Neville's POV:
"What do you mean, father?" She asks him.
"The pest Dumbledore... kill him."
Draco reminds himself what his father told him to do when he receives a letter of this sort: burn it. "Incendio." Draco says, the paper burning in his hand.
Harry decides to see the good in Blaise. He sighs, softens his expression, and beings to speak.
The next day Professor McGonagall called both Harry and Draco down to her office. Draco was unpleasantly surprised by Harry's presence.
"Yes... F-friends. But only if you'd want to!" Blaise says quickly.
"You're ignoring the key issue here, Mister Malfoy. You beat on your own son, often for unnecessary reasons. Even if it was necessary, you beat him far too harshly. I believe you threw him down the stairs once?" Harry says, "And for what reason? Because he couldn't dodge a spell?! You disgust me." Harry snaps. He turns to the judge, "Permission to leave, sir?"
Harry rushes to him and attempts to get the wands from him. He holds onto them tight, but then Harry touches his hand and he loses focus. Harry runs away with the wands in hand. He sits there in shock and fear. He really was weak.
The talking between Ginny and Blaise had stopped when Harry came towards their group and sat down.
"They're small winged creatures that fly into your ears! They only fly into good-hearted people, though." Luna smiled.
Harry sighs in anger but proceeds in silence, which makes Draco upset. "Oh, he can't think of a comeback," Draco says with a fake frown. Yet, Harry still ignores him. "Cat got your tongue, Potter?" Draco says a little quieter this time, "Or am I just getting under the chosen ones oh so holy skin?"
"Please. We'll see each other again, I promise." Blaise says, pecking him on the lips softly and kissing his forehead. "Go home, darling."
"Well, uh, it's from Louis Vellios. He only made one cologne, so that'll be easy for you." He says quietly.
He knew she wouldn't understand, but he still informed her of events in his life every time they visited. This time wasn't an exception. "I have a girlfriend, mum!"
"Fine, then if you're speaking the truth, what do you think of me?" Harry smirks as if he was a genius.
He swings open his closet door to reveal a dark room just big enough for him to hide. He missed this room. He steps inside and closes the door tight. He takes a deep, shaky breath and hugs himself.
Draco's POV:
"Neville, come sit." says the Professor when they enter his office. Neville does just that and sits right in front of the Professor's desk. "Now, I have some terrible news. Your grandmother called today and wanted me to inform you that your father has... died." Dumbledore says, his eyes drooped down in sadness.
He then puts the cookies into the oven behind them and they continue to talk.
"Hello, Neville. Never think I don't want to talk to you, I simply keep my distance to be respectful to you. However, I will always be here if you need me. I really am sorry for your loss. That must feel terrible. I can't imagine what it must be like, but I know what it's like to not have a normal family that's for sure. As for your break up, I'm really sorry that happened. I don't think it would be because you're boring because I think you're the most interesting person in the world! It can't be because you're ugly because well... you're not at all! Just look at you! I'm shocked anyone would think you are anything but attractive. And you aren't weird, not at all. People just don't know you enough and they often make assumptions without evidence. If she thinks any of these things about you, which I'm sure she doesn't, then she was a bad match anyways. You deserve love, don't ever think otherwise. You deserve every good thing in the world to happen to you because you're a good person with a good heart. I'm sorry such terrible things happen to you, they shouldn't. The universe really is attacking the wrong person, that's for sure. By the way, this isn't too depressing at all. In fact, you can tell me anything and everything, no matter how sad or terrible it is. If you need a safe space, I'm right here. I'll never judge you and I'll never turn you away. I promise you. If I was as brave as you, perhaps I would meet you face to face and make an unbreakable vow to you saying that I'd never judge you and always be a place of comfort for you. But since that would terrify me and ruin everything, you must trust me instead. Just know that not everything is your fault and everything gets better with time. I know that's hard to believe, especially for me, but for someone like you it's inevitable to get better with time. You'll find a person who truly loves you and you'll find peace. It may take a while, but it'll come. Thank you for confiding in me and I really hope you find happiness."
"I mean... Even though I've seperated myself from everyone... I don't really think they'd care anyways. I mean, let's face it, no one cared about me until they heard about the situation with my father."
"Until you met Neville." Draco sings.
"I don't need your help, boy. The only thing you do is destroy everything." Snape says.
"Eww, Merlin no!" Draco shouts, almost vomiting on spot. Not only was she not at all attractive, but her obsession with Potter was even more sickening. Wow, there's another sign of how unbelievably oblivious he was to his attraction to him.
Oh no. "Oh, yeah it's good. Works really well." He gulped, but spoke confidently.
"You know what, do it on your own." Draco snapped.
Harry and Draco look at each other with wide-eyes. What just happened?
"Well... Maybe you should talk to him? I'm sure he'd appreciate it. Maybe you should let him down easy if you don't like him back." Pansy says.
"Harry... I'm sorry." Draco says softly.
He smiles wide and sits alone at the Slytherin table waiting for lunch to begin. Slowly the students file in one by one. He notices Draco come in and frowns. He really doesn't look right. His hair is messier than usual, a dark grey covers the skin under his eyes, and for the first time he could see that his clothes were wrinkly and unkempt.
P.S. I choose to not answer to those guesses. I apologize, but I don't wish to say anything about it. Talk to you later!"
"Well, why did you punch yourself, master?" Maggie asks.
At the mention of his rival, his heart speeds up. He kept begging for it to calm down, but it wouldn't. As soon as he dropped his bag on the ground beside Draco, they made eye contact. That only made his nerves crazier.
"Oh, my Merlin! It is him!" Blaise whispers.
"I speak to myself quite often, you should try it some time." Dumbledore says. Draco gives him a strange look. He's pointing a wand at him and all he does is speak to him like it's all normal. "Draco, you are no killer."
He sat on the steps of the fourth floor, hoping Harry wouldn't find him there. Much to his dismay, a voice behind him says:
"No. Now leave me alone." Draco demanded with a smirk.
"You're powerful, darling, whether you like it or not." Blaise says, taking a bite of an apple.
His breathing relaxes, "Ok... continue."
"I have an idea... You can steal him from Lovegood." Draco smirks.
"Just... go back to the hospital wing... I need some space." Blaise says, walking away without another word.
"Of course. I won't just blindly trust him, but I do have hope that he's actually learning. Who knows? Maybe he'll apologize to you and Hermione soon." Harry predicts, making Ron scoff.
"Is this for you, Blaise?" Dumbledore asks, an eyebrow raised.
Luna sighs, "You shouldn't have kicked him out."
He finally gets through the moving staircases and in front of the Fat Lady, only to realize... he had forgotten the password.
"Draco!" Harry says, making Draco look at him in shock. "Look, we will get expelled if we fight like this anymore and we have to be partners for the whole year! Can we please just at least be respectful to each other?! We don't have to be friends because I wouldn't want that any more than you would. But please, for the love of Merlin, can we just get along?! Just for this year at the very least, please?!" Harry pleads.
"He better." Blaise says angrily before popping a bean from yesterday into his mouth.
Then he takes in what she had just said. They aren't dating. His mouth curves up into a smile. Neville was still free. It was like Christmas had hit. Again, it's not as if he has a chance with Neville, but knowing he's still available made his heart swell. Maybe he still had a little bit of hope that it would go somewhere.
"I'll do anything. I just wanna be here to support you. Anything you need, I want to get it to you." Harry says.
His eyes began to burn the more he thought and thought about how much of an idiotic loser he was, the more tears began to form. Usually he can hold it in, but this time it didn't work. He felt like he was sobbing for hours, up until he heard his name being called.
Out of kindness, but possibly also stupidity, he grabs Blaise's things and carries them with him. Even though Blaise is terrible, everyone deserves kindness sometimes. He would want someone to do that for him. Although, he struggled to keep everything in hand.
- Luna: Homosexual Homoromantic
"I'm just excited to see Neville humiliate himself." Xavier chuckles.
"No, absolutely not! Please don't." Draco pleads.
"But it's not! I like him, I really do!" Neville says.
"I'm wonderful, thanks for asking! It seems that Trevor is quite the troublemaker." Blaise comments with a smirk.
"Both of my real parents are dead and those muggles I live with don't praise me for anything. Even if I make their meals three times a day. Even if I wash the dishes and clean the bathroom. You don't know half of it, Draco." Harry corrected.
"Really? If anything he's probably over at Malfoy's kissing his arse." Ron says.
"But I always mess it up." Neville replies with a frown.
"Thank you, Professor." Blaise says with a smile.
Neville looks up at him once more and cocks his head. Blaise smiles uncontrollably.
"Not that mad! I'm telling you, he's good! Where did he go, father?" Luna asks.
Neville's POV:
He pushes past her and up to his dorm, not once looking back at Pansy. He falls into his mattress, staring up at the ceiling, wishing he could just be alone forever. It's not like his friends actually care, they only like his father's money. Even he only likes himself for his father's money. But who could blame him, it's the only thing his father would give him other than a good shouting at and a look of intimidation. Though he should probably just try being better at what his father asks of him, and he tries! But every time he just gets worse at it and his father just gets angrier.
He decides to write in the free space below and glides his quill across the page.
"No... I'm coming to apologize. It was wrong of me to assume things I didn't know about. Blaise actually seemed genuine... Maybe it's too soon to come back here, but I felt really terrible."
"Excuse me, where is your bathroom?" Draco asks politely, impressively hiding any amount of voice-cracking that could've come through.
"You know... I uh, I've realized something." Harry says.
He sighs and leans against the wall, waiting for someone to come by and open it up for him.
"Wait! I have cauldron cakes! Well, one. We can half it!" Blaise suggests.
"Well... We're going to fly across this lake to a secret location for our date." Blaise informs.
"I've seen it on the train." Blaise states. "I'm sorry if that's weird or anything... Maybe it is." He shakes his head.
He looks into his eyes. He knows those eyes. Those are the same eyes he looked into before he kissed him, the same eyes that belonged to a person he fought with for years.
"Ah... Draco, do you have another story?" Dumbledore asks. Draco shakes his head in response. "Very well... Well, both of you were in the wrong in this, that's for sure. First of all, Draco apologize to Harry." Dumbledore says.
"Don't even act like you don't know. Draco helped get Dumbledore killed! He's a bloody death eater! You seriously think I'm gonna trust you?!" Neville shouts. Blaise stands dumbfounded. He has never once heard Neville shout.
"Will do! You can go back to enjoying your tea now." Luna says with a smile and waves goodbye.
He kept feeling worried about Draco. Every thought was 'is Draco ok?', 'Has Draco eaten?', 'I hope Draco is safe.' Was he really this obsessed? He had bigger things to worry about than Draco, but his brain couldn't seem to process that truth.
He turned around and held his wand right up to Harry's face. Thinking quickly, Harry grabs his wand, but Draco was fast. He throws the first spell, which Harry dodges.
Blaise squeezed his arm gently and gave him a reassuring look.
Blaise seems startled at this. "Yeah?"
They both reached for the dittany and their hands touched. A strange, but oddly comforting feeling rushed through Neville's body. He couldn't pin point it, but it was something that made him happy but also incredibly uncomfortable. However, he decided he liked that feeling. But why did it happen at that moment?
"Really now?" Blaise smirks, "How come? If you don't mind saying, of course."
"It's alright. Actually, I was wondering why you seem to care for me so much? I know you have feelings for me, but I honestly expected you to focus on yourself more. But I really appreciate you caring about me, don't get me wrong. Not many people show that and it really makes me feel loved. Not saying that you love me or anything, but that it makes me feel like I have someone that loves me. Sorry if that's awkward. I really am not trying to make things weird between us. Anyways, I'll shut up about that now. But I'm sure your friend is just busy. Maybe he has to keep his family safe or he's focusing on himself. At least I hope so. If not, I'm sure he will be safe soon. As for the place... woah! That sounds gorgeous! In that case, I'm really glad I went to Luna to help you! You seem happy there. Also, this may be weird to say because you know... we don't know each other and you apparently have feelings for me. But maybe you can help? I'm scared that I may like boys. I may just be thinking weird or something, but it's not like I'm under a love potion. I got tested for it twice. Once with my ex-girlfriend, another time with my grandmother. I didn't tell her why I wanted a test and I'm happy she didn't ask. But it's even scarier that I never thought this way about Hannah but now I feel all these strange feelings I've never felt before and it's freaking me out. I really don't want to be this way. No offense to people that like their same gender but I just don't like these feelings. I've never felt any of them before, not once! Not about anyone until now and it's freaking me out. I'm really sorry if this is weird to talk about with you. Just drop it if you don't feel comfortable with it, ok? I'll understand fully."
"You can't make him do anything. Malfoy will be Malfoy. He is the way he was raised, vile. Not to mention he is a Slytherin! A snake! You can't trust any of them! Everyone who was ever been evil has been in Slytherin!" Ron says angrily.
"He is horrible to us, Harry! How could you say that!" Ron shouts.
"Y-yeah?" He says.
"Alright, I'll think about it." Draco sighs. Yet, even as he thought, he still didn't think he'd be able to even get one word out to Harry. He decided at once that he would continue to avoid him.
"You both mean so much to me." Draco cries. "I worry I'll lose you any moment now." He chuckles humorlessly.
"It was strange how Malfoy stood up for you today with Snape. Honestly, I think the git is up to something." Ron says.
"I would! So don't you dare think of doing that ever again. You understand?"
"I uh... I better go now." Harry says quietly, standing up and leaving the lavatory without another word.
"Wait... who do you think this is?" Blaise asks nervously.
Draco thinks and thinks, but all he can think of to try is the time his mother gave him new robes. "Expecto Patronum," Draco says nonchalantly. Nothing happens.
"Yeah." Neville smiles back.
Draco continues to shake and searches around the room for something. He catches sight of Harry, who is looking at him in worry. He begins to breathe like he just ran a marathon.
"Um... Thanks, Draco... Or Malfoy... Whatever you wanna be called." Harry says and shortly after he gives him a small smile.
"It's just... Normally S-Slytherins are mean. You aren't and that makes me afraid that you'll do something to me." Neville says. His eyes grow wide. "What am I saying?!" He whisper-shouts.
"They couldn't. Besides, I asked them not to." Draco replies.
Him and Harry continuously avoided each other and Ron continued to give them both weird looks.
"Of course it does! If it's upsetting you, of course, it matters!"
Harry opened his eyes. Draco then noticed the tears coming down his face. Harry quickly wiped them away and stared back at Draco.
"People die every day!" Neville shouts, "Friends... family... And yeah... We lost Harry tonight. He may not be here, but he's still with us... in here," Neville says pointing at his chest. "Just like Fred, Remus, Tonks, Dumbledore... But you know what... They didn't die in vain!" He turns to Voldemort, "But you will, because you're wrong! Harry's heart did beat for us, for all of us! It's not over!" He shouts, reaching into the Sorting Hat and pulling out a sword. At the same time Harry drops from Hagrid's arms and onto the ground.
"Good, now it's individual. You have to add the glaze, though." Blaise does just that, feeling quite dissapointed in himself for the glaze being so messy. "Here, let me try one." Hunter says, picking up a warm cookie, blowing it off, and taking a big chunk out of it. He nods his head in approval, "That's good. Send it in, but make sure to package them properly." He says, amounts of cookie still in his mouth.
"No, I want to keep it." Neville says, clutching it in his pocket.
"I think so... Hopefully I don't cry in front of them."
"Why did he do it?" Blaise asks.
"I feel the same way." Blaise says, pulling his legs up to his chest and holding them there.
He bursts into the court room and sbouts, "Someone help! I think Draco's about to pass out!" A few people rush to help, including Narcissa Malfoy, but they're too late.
Voldemort and his followers have a laugh. "I honestly expected better... but we'll take it." He says.
Harry suddenly gets silent and stares at the floor, "Y-you said the other day that... You like me."
"Sorry..." Neville says sadly.
"Luna says that Nevor is always anxious. Maybe you can do something to fix that?" Hunter suggests.
He sighs and picks at his fingers. He then gets up and walks to his father. "Hi, dad. It's Neville." His father simply stares straight ahead. "Merry Christmas. I got you and mum a gift. It isn't much... but we assumed you'd both enjoy it." He grabs both of them out of his pocket and puts one on the beside table. "It's your engagement rings. We found them in your old room and thought maybe you'd want it."
"Uh... by my feelings? Well... I don't wanna say. It's weird and you'll think I'm some creep." Neville says.
Draco looks at the floor, fiddling with his teacup. "Draco, no matter what anyone makes you do, you be yourself."
Harry sighs, "I'm ok."
"Seriously though, I have no idea. Please tell me." Draco pleads.
"Where are my glasses? Nurse, can you find my glasses?" She says to him.
Neville was astounded and flattered, yet didn't believe it for a second. However, something was telling him this was too sincere to be some joke. He pocketed the letter and put the rest of his new things in his dorm room before rushing out of the common room and asking a few Ravenclaws where Luna might be.
"Did you talk to Neville about the veritaserum thing?" Draco asks.
His heart beats fast and all he can hear is the roaring of the fire. He suddenly crashes onto the ground. The sweet, sweet ground. He stumbles to his feet and runs away as quickly as he can. His feet burn with pain, but he pushes on. Crabbe follows closely behind him before falling to his knees.
"Stop," Comes a familiar voice.
"I'm so hungry!" He says, shoveling more food into his mouth.
"Says the person who claimed themselves as royalty since day one when really, no one knows him and he's nothing but a pathetic excuse for a wizard," Harry smirks back.
"Good afternoon, Bellatrix." His mother said back.
"Don't talk to me! You're just here to ruin my life like the rest of them! I don't want to be your friend and I never will want to be your friend!" Neville shouts through tears, "I knew it was all a trick!" Blaise stares at the floor without another word.
Harry laughs and they pull away. "So it's settled then. Only the few people we discussed will know unless of course we decide to make it public."
He walked in and saw Harry shirtless again. He was in absolute awe.
"Yes I should've! I'm almost certain he is the one who brought those death eaters here." Her father says.
"Really?" Draco asked, he just didn't think Blaise was being truthful.
"What is the assignment, my lord?" Father asks.
Draco grunts. 'Great, now I have to deal with him.' He thinks with a feeling of dread. He loves potions, it's his whole life other than Quidditch! But coming to class brings him dread. He loves Snape, of course, he is the only one who understands him! He just always feels so sad, he can't quite explain it. Nothing makes him happy, no matter how much he loves it. Unless, of course, it involves ruining Harry Potter's day. That gave him the most joy, the only joy in his life ever.
- Neville: Lion (happiest memory: when his mother had gotten better and could speak to him. Originally was the moments he had with Blaise before and after they started dating)
"Yes, ten. No less. You can get more than that if you want, though." She smirks again.
"There, I said it. Wow, that felt amazing to say." Blaise sighs in happiness.
"I'm fine." He grunts, "I need to get back out there." He says, trying to stand up. Blaise tries to grab his hand but Neville pulls away. "Why are you trying to help me? Why are you here?" Neville asks.
Draco grabs his wand and says softly, "Muffliato."
Neville stares down at the hand on his arm and sighs, "I... Well, let me start at the beginning. There was this guy who sent me a Christmas gift, right? And it was really nice and he sent me all these great things. But, I didn't know who he was. We had great talks through letters, but I still had no idea, even with hints! Then he had a problem and I told Luna to go help and she was headed towards either the basement or dungeon. So, I kept thinking, well if it isn't a Hufflepuff then it has to be a Slytherin. But the only Slytherin with a Z in his name was you. But then, all these weird thoughts came to mind about me and you and I kind of wanted it to be you in some weird way. Gosh, I should shut up now." Neville blurts out.
"Ok. What is it?" Luna asks.
He follows Draco swiftly to wherever he may be going. Only to notice he makes his way into the abandoned girl's bathroom on the second floor.
There in the doorway is Ron, staring at them both in shock.
Draco doesn't respond, but instead holds back the tears threatening to fall onto his cheeks. But, as usual, his efforts fail.
"Uh... Thanks." Harry chuckles awkwardly. "Sorry if I made things weird."
"Yes, father?" He asks calmly, managing to keep a steady voice.
"If I catch a word of you not doing as you're told again there will be worse than that. Got it?!" His father shouts. Draco nods rapidly. "Go to your room, now!"
"What the hell?!" He shouts. Draco notices his eyes begin to get red and his chest rise and fall as he paced around the common room. "Fucking bitch! How could she?! Neville doesn't deserve her!"
"Who are you and what have you done with my boy?" Blaise asks. He looks to the side and Neville follows his gaze. There sat Luna, looking at them both in shock. "Are you seeing this?" Blaise asks her. She nods.
She chuckles and pulls away from him, "I guess you want those letters I didn't let you have?"
Dumbledore then raises his wand, waves it in a spiral motion, and taps the bracelet three times. "There's the first step. Give it a whiff!"
"I a-apologize, Professor." Neville stutters quietly.
He also hopes he will completely forget Draco exists soon before he loses his mind. He couldn't help but wonder: What in the world is wrong with me?!
"Alright, so today we continue our work on Patronus's, hopefully with no fights this time." Professor Lupin said with a smile. "Why don't you come up here, Blaise."
Blaise simply smiles wide at him, "We can go to Honeydukes! Or... Uh, somewhere else."
"Draco... I'm sorry about the other night. We shouldn't have, we really shouldn't have. We can just go back to the way things normally were." Harry says.
"We're here to see Frank and Alice Longbottom." His grandmother says to the lady behind the desk. He's been to Saint Mungo's every year since he was a very small baby. Nothing much happens, especially since his father barely speaks and his mother makes no sense. However, he still feels blessed enough to be able to see them at all.
"The thing is... I'm happy for them truly. I finally can look at them without feeling jealousy, but now I also feel... I don't know, pain? I can't explain it. But I'm happy for them." Blaise says.
"I heard about you and Luna." He says with a smile.
He slips the bracelet on his wrist and begins to read.
"I'll talk to you guys later." Draco says to Luna and Blaise. Blaise was snickering while Luna was smiling brightly.
Blaise grunts and leaves the infirmary with Harry following slowly behind. He silently thanked Madame Pomfrey and made a mental note to himself to get revenge on Blaise. He knew exactly how to.
Blaise pulls away, his hands still on Neville's biceps. "What did you say?"
"When do you think we'll get to see it?" The boy asks.
Draco sat on the bed across from Harry. The silence had lasted ever since he had gotten back from the hospital wing and it was deafening.
"First, give me the letter please." Luna says, holding out her hand. Neville takes the letter out of his robe and hands it over. Luna examines the back of the envelope without taking the letter out. She then smiles softly. "I am pretty certain it's the same person."
"No! You don't understand! He taught me how to fly! He makes me happy!" He shouts.
"We'll practice more later," Lupin says, giving Draco a smile and a pat on the back. He goes to sit down, not once looking up at anyone. He can practically hear his father screaming at him about how he's practically a squib, a horrible wizard, a disgrace... the weakest Malfoy ever known to date. He'll never do it right.
As he steps into the doorway he can hear sobs and whines coming from inside.
"Expecto patronum!" They both shout at the same time.
"Well apparently you said something because she told everyone that you have a crush on me." Draco informs.
Harry closes the door behind them and sits down on the steps.
"Yeah... I didn't kn-know. I'm sorry." Neville says.
"Let's go pay, then!" Blaise says happily, rushing over to the counter and plopping the packages on the counter.
"Uh, yes!" Blaise reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bracelet he found last night and hands it towards the Professor.
There was such a strong wave of it, though, right after he mentioned the scent of ink. It hit him right in the face. It was more hypnotizing than the other smells. Bloody hell, it was amazing. He didn't think he should've asked him that question, though. He bloody embarrassed himself. Damn, he's talking like Ron now.
"Whatever!" Draco exclaims, "I don't care anymore. I just want a damn break for once."
"But-"
Blaise smiles, "He'd love that. Maybe we should organize a family dinner. Me, you, Draco, the Weasley's, all of us!"
His mother draws her wand, only to have it fall out of her hands and into Dobby's.
"Fantastic. I'll get that book as soon as possible, ok? We'll figure this out." Harry says, kissing his cheek softly.
Harry takes his hand and leads him down the hall. He opens the very last door, which leads outside.
"No, thank you," Neville replies, his voice slightly cracking. I hate that. He always hated it. It made him sound girly and scared. Maybe he was girly and scared, but it still made him feel bad!
"I actually felt like that once... When I became friends with Ron and Christmas came, Molly made me a sweater. Ron always hated it, but that present made me feel so special and loved even though I wasn't a part of their family. And when I first came to the Burrow... It was amazing. It was like the loving home I've never had." Harry says. "I understand you completely."
Blaise smiles, "And that's enough for me." He stares at him for a few seconds, taking in his features, "You really are handsome, you know that right?" Blaise asks.
Harry's POV:
"You're worried about a house-elf?" Lucius snaps back.
He wipes his eyes and sniffs, "Yeah?"
"No one!" Draco shouts. However, he wasn't sure that he wasn't slipped something. Maybe not a love potion, but definitely something.
Blaise releases Neville's hand and rushes after him. He notices him going into the second floor bathroom... but why?
He catches up to him. "How can I help?" Harry says quickly.
"Not that I know of..." Draco sighs and debates telling him the truth. I mean, what has he got to lose? It's not like it matters if Harry hates him or thinks he's weird. "Well... Maybe I'm just... I dunno, lonely?"
Harry chuckles nervously. They both share a blush upon their cheeks.
"Who else is here? I heard you talking!" Draco shouts.
Harry groans, "I don't like anyone, Hermione."
They go back and forth, throwing spells and dodging them. Harry suddenly remembers a spell in the potions book he had. Draco definitely was an enemy.
Neville had become a herbology teacher at Hogwarts while Blaise owns his own business in Diagon Alley with Luna in which they sell herbology and pet supplies.
"The one thing I remember most is the time when Fred and George came by here and tried to order firewhiskey in their fourth year." Neville says with a small chuckle.
"Yeah... probably." Neville replies. He turns on his heels, grabs the sword and limps into the castle. Blaise looks at the trio awkwardly before slowly following Neville.
He instead runs to his dorm and closes the door tight. Luckily, no one was up there with him. He closed his curtains, casts muffliato, and puts the covers over his head.
She lays the book down on her lap and narrows her eyes at him, "Why did you even go to the ball with me? To lead me on?!"
For once he was finally thankful for what his father had taught him.
Secretly, he feels happy for Blaise. Even though he knows Blaise will probably never talk to him again after this, or at least after he finds out he's a death eater. The one friend he truly had would leave him. But, to be perfectly honest, he expected it. If he loved someone like Blaise loved Neville, he'd also choose them over anyone and everyone else without hesitation. He didn't blame him, but he couldn't help but feel a bit heartbroken. But, again, did any of this really become a surprise to him?
"Ronald!" Harry hears Hermione shout. He smiles. Just like an old married couple.
"You've got to be kidding me." Ron mutters.
Draco's POV:
He went back to Hogwarts feeling defeated. He thought everything would be okay once he had done what father wanted. It isn't okay. Nothing is okay. He may be a prat but he's not a damn killer. But he said he had to, or great consequences would be in store.
However, it is a good love story for her. But that didn't make it any less shocking. Perhaps she was too invested in Harry and Draco to notice Blaise and Neville?
"W-we could try to..." He whispers, "We can try it..." He leans in even closer, licking his lips slightly.
"Hey, Neville!" Seamus says, coming up the stairs with Dean. As soon as they step off, the staircase moves behind them.
"What do you mean?" Blaise asks.
"No, not at all." Draco sits beside him, "I wanna let you know something that no one else knows. For years I've been seen as this perfect boy with this perfect family when really... I'm none of that. I mess up everything I do and I just can't seem to gain my father's love. My mother's, maybe, but she barely has time for me. Whenever my father does or says something, she doesn't pay much attention and she doesn't seem to care either. I'm just some invisible boy walking the house. Unless it's my father of course... he always notices me... but not in the way I'd hope."
"I want to be friends... I'm just scared. You... You just make me feel nervous. Uh..." Neville finishes.
Draco felt insulted. "Get out!" He shouts.
Snape nodded, "Now suck it up and go back to where you came from. Don't worry about Dumbledore, I got that." Snape assured.
"Ah! It is him!" Hunter says happily.
"Uh... Thanks?" Draco questions. He shouldn't be nervous. Who is he becoming?! A wimp, that's it. "But really I'm not as helpless as I look, Potter." He spat his words at Harry, feeling slightly guilty. His stomach began to turn.
"I'm gonna go bring them back in." Blaise says and walks away.
"We're thinking about bringing you home after you eat. But we'll have to pay close attention to what you eat now. You must eat three meals a day, she said, and drink more water." His mother says. "I'll help you out with that. Do you four mind helping as well?" She asks Blaise and them.
"Draco!" His Aunt said from the next room.
"Ready for what?" Both him and Neville ask her.
"Uh... B-Blaise Zabini's." He mutters.
"Because I like you." He slammed his hands on his mouth again and shook his head violently. He didn't mean to say that either.
He reaches for it, breaking the seal, and picking out the letter. He opens it and the same small, neat cursive letters covered the page.
He wanted to push him away, get him out of his face but he was frozen. How did he get such emerald eyes? Is that even humanly possible? "Cat got your tongue, ferret?" Harry smirks. "Watch who you talk to like that." And with that, he stomps away.
Neville takes a deep breath. "Goyle- Well, see... We were working on a potion and... I made it explode. G-Goyle was u-upset..."
Draco looks at him with a cocked eyebrow. "But... But you didn't... Keep Harry here..."
"I'm sure if we talk to him he'll understand." Harry says. Draco simply shakes his head but doesn't say another word.
"It was after the hearing. I don't really know what did it." Harry says.
"I'm happy to be back here. It's so warm and nostalgic." Hannah says.
"Not every-"
"Now boys, what do you smell," Snape asks.
"Well, Snape just said you traded partners with Pansy. Now I'm your partner." Blaise says.
"What do you mean?" Blaise asks, taking another bean out of the box and popping it into his mouth.
Harry looks at him in shock. Why did Blaise look so passionate about this?! He looks at Draco who is simply shaking his head at him.
But it only made the sound of someone shouting, "Woah!" Even more jarring. He nearly jumped out of his skin and Harry jumps away from him.
"Yeah... She kinda confirmed that you liked me and I can't stop thinking about you and I really like you." Harry blurts out. "I'm not very good at this." He says with a nervous chuckle.
"Please... Let's just try." Harry pleads.
Harry stands there, shocked at himself. Why would he ever say that? Sure, it was true, but seriously?! He groans and silently shouts at himself for it. This is just like the time when he tried to talk to Cho Chang. Not that Draco is anything like that. They're just friends. That's all.
"Your father gets... violent... doesn't he?" Blaise guesses. "I'm sorry if I just offended your family if I'm wrong."
"How do you feel, dear?" She asks him.
"Goodnight." Harry sighs.
"Why would I worry about you?" He almost sneers.
"I'll help you up. Take my hand." Blaise says. Neville complies and grabs onto Blaise's hand and he pulls him up to his feet. "Come on, let's get you somewhere safe."
"What do you think you're doing?!" Snape whisper-shouted at him.
"Then you should've sat back and enjoyed it. Get back inside." Snape orders.
"I'm proud of you." Blaise says with a smile and a twinkle in his eye. Neville's heart soars. That's the first time he's ever heard that. He looks ahead of him to see various plains and mountains stretched across the grounds below them.
Ginny lives with her girlfriend, who she's been with for a year. They live out in the city and have two female dogs. She visits her family often, unlike her brother Percy who hasn't been seen since their fifth year, and brings her dogs and girlfriend along which brings Molly joy.
Draco's POV:
"Sure." Blaise says, handing the tray to the boy beside him while trying to wrap his brain around what he is advising him to do. Not yet? Is he saying that he should make something completely new? How in the world would he do that?
"Hi." Harry replied without looking up.
"Love?" Hunter's eyes sparkle and he gets giddy, "Oh my goodness! You never told me it was love! I mean, I was hoping, but still!"
"W- I... Yes?" Draco said it more as a question than an answer.
Draco's POV:
"I'm not gonna give that oaf a stupid flower."
"What's up, Potter?" Blaise says with a smirk. Draco gives him a sharp glance, but Blaise only continues, "I heard Draco confessed his undying love to you."
"Yes, my lord." His father says behind him. "He should be here any minute."
Maybe he's just sleep-deprived... That's it. He's not actually attracted to him, he's just stressed out and tired. Nothing is wrong with him.
There he was, standing in front of the common room talking to Blaise and that weird girl Luna.
"Welcome back." A familiar voice said, making him shout. There was his grandmother, waiting for him in a chair with her arms crossed across her chest. "You really thought I wouldn't notice?"
Draco's head snaps up, the room feeling oddly empty. "Huh?"
She stomps into the room, adrenaline pumping through her veins. She was ready to confront Blaise as soon as the results came back. She was very certain they would be positive. With everything she has seen since she has been with Neville, it would make complete sense that Blaise slipped him a potion, especially after they made a rumor about him liking Blaise. It was all some sick plan she was sure of it.
"Yeah?"
"Fine." She groans. "It's about Harry."
Draco scoffs, "That'll never happen."
"Blimey, it's been crazy out there. Some seventh years can't even come to Hogwarts because they're muggle-borns!" Dean informs.
"Yes?" Harry asks with a confused expression.
"There!" He shouts, grabbing the sword and running as quickly as he can towards the staircase where he watches Hermione and Ron running away from the snake. Ron throws a spell, but it's no use. Blaise runs towards Neville, only to be stopped dead in his tracks.
"A cursed necklace and a tea laced with poison? Your efforts prove to me that... you simply don't have the heart to kill me. Draco, you have a good heart-"
Draco sat on his bed, thinking about what Blaise did earlier. Why did he sit beside Neville? Why did Pansy sit all alone?
"You're alright!" Harry shouts.
"Your eyes are red." He whispers.
"No." He heard Potter whisper. "Stop."
"Don't just say that. I know you still don't plan on doing it. But if you have feelings for him, I promise you that nothing will be possible until you talk to him. That was proven to me not long ago. I'm telling you... you need to talk to him. Think about, yeah?" Blaise says.
He took a sip of his hot chocolate and closed his eyes. He missed the feeling of drinking a warm beverage in an atmosphere like the Three Broomsticks. He actually felt relaxed at this moment. Then, it was over as quickly as it started, at least that's how it felt.
"This is so good!" George Weasley shouts with a mouth-full of food.
::Patronus's::
"Well, I have to get back to the Hufflepuffs. See you later, yeah?" Hannah says, smiling at him.
"So..." Hannah said, still holding his hand, "Now that you know I like you... do you like me back?"
In a moment of courage, Draco whispers, "Kiss me."
"You've always been a late bloomer, Neville. You never know... Maybe this is just a phase."
He climbed up many stairs and stopped suddenly when he heard rumbling. It came from the nearest door. He opened it to reveal a cluttered room filled with dust and old furniture. He looked around and saw a wardrobe shaking loudly. Until suddenly, it stopped.
Blaise's POV:
"Uh... Anything else?" Harry mutters.
Soon the class fills with the other students. Oddly enough, him and Harry worked pretty well together this time. It was kinda nice.
"Was it bad?" Harry asks nervously.
"That's not all that happened today. I went out to you know... get away from Harry and well... I saw Neville. He was... sobbing. I tried to get his attention but he ran away as soon as he saw me. I don't know where he went. He certainly didn't go in the direction of the Gryffindor common room." Draco informs.
"Neville, calm down. You aren't an idiot. Listen, I'll talk to Blaise for you. You don't need to worry, ok? And if he messes with you again, tell me." Harry says and Neville nods. Harry smiles down at him. "I'll see you later, ok? I have things I have to do."
"Like I give a damn what Harry thinks." Draco spits but feels a pang in his chest. The sudden urge to scream comes back and he feels a teardrop on his face.
"Can you hand me the rose thorns and moonstone?" Harry asks. Draco does exactly that and he gives him thanks.
"No... I always thought I was too clumsy to. You know... everyone thought I was a squib when I was younger... Sometimes I think they were right... But then whenever I think I can't possibly do magic at all, my grandmother reminds me that I survived being dropped by Great-Uncle Algie by using my magic when I was a baby. But even then... sometimes I worry I don't have enough magic. I don't think I really belong here." Neville says, "Sorry to make it all depressing..."
"Aww, I'm so touched." Draco says sarcastically.
Ginny looks down with a heavy blush upon her cheeks and says, "Well at least I don't chew with my mouth open!"
"That doesn't matter to me. As long as you're kissing me, that's all that matters. I wouldn't want anyone else."
"Blaise, calm down, let's get to the common room."
"Next time just... don't talk to Pansy anymore." Draco says.
He kicks off into the air and flies through the clouds. He tries to remember where to find Luna's home. With many misdirections and twists and turns, he finally is met with the sight of Luna's house under the stars.
"Yeah, it might. Maybe if he keeps talking to George he might feel a bit better." Harry says with a smile, "Him and Fred always made me feel better in bad times. Hopefully he can help Draco out. Maybe we can all become a family."
"Please, let me in. I need to talk to you." Harry pleads.
"Hi, Luna." He sighs.
"Yeah? What is that?" Draco asks nervously.
Harry obeys, closing the gap between them and kissing him softly and slowly. Draco was in heaven.
For the first time ever, Draco felt comfortable around one of his 'friends'. Actually, it finally felt like he had a friend. He never knew Blaise could be such an accepting person. It was strange for any Slytherin to be the way Blaise was being. But he didn't mind, it made him pretty comfortable. He actually felt as if he could tell Blaise almost anything without being judged, almost.
"Go get a piece, any piece!" Molly urges. He was almost afraid to ruin it's beauty.
"What is this?" Madame Pomfrey asked with her eyes wide.
"And uh... Thanks for teaching me how to fly." Neville says with a blush.
He stops in front of a door and slams his fist on the wood multiple times.
Hermione, with tears streaming down her eyes rushes to Neville and hugs him tight, sobbing into his shoulder.
"W-wait... It's a boy?" Blaise whispers. Draco stares down at the floor and Blaise smiles. "It is!" He whispers excitedly.
"Mal-Draco, I'm... Sorry." Harry finishes looking uncomfortable.
"Draco..." Blaise begins, "I see that you're better. At least a bit. How long have you been awake?"
- Pansy: Pansexual Panromantic
Harry leans in to smell next. "Vanilla, fresh laundry, and... Ink?" Harry says. He then looks down at his desk with his eyes wide.
"Holly berries," Blaise says and the entrance opens. Harry follows quickly behind them and tries to follow Blaise, only to get blocked by Pansy Parkinson and some Slytherin he knew nothing about.
When he came back he could hear someone say from the back of the class, "Let's hope Neville can measure this time!"
"Gee, thanks!" Draco rolls his eyes.
"Try uh... Pushing your feet back." Blaise says. Neville does just that and kicks off into the sky at full speed.
"Don't raise your voice at me! My word is final! I am so dissappointed. You know what I've told you about this! You're letting this aftermath of the war turn you to bad things. What's next, alcohol?!" As his grandmother lectures his, he feels tears well up in his eyes. "Just go to your room." She says, waving him away.
He wanted to ignore it, he wanted to not think of Harry having a weird dream he was assuming he was having, but he couldn't stop listening.
"No, we don't!" Draco shouts.
"Maybe we should, uh, talk somewhere else." Blaise mutters. Neville nods at him and stands up. Blaise grabs hold of his hand, which makes his heart flutter in delight, and takes him away from their peers.
TW/CW: a small amount of self-harm, drinking, and abuse.
Pansy gives his an innocent smile, "Sure, Mr. Zabini!" She says sarcastically and walks past Blaise and towards a velvet green chair on the other side of the room. "So, what is this about?"
"You wanna know what he said about you, Blaisey-boo?" Veronica Melden asked.
"I uh... I'm ki-kinda pinned down right now..." Harry says awkwardly. "So it's either let me go or get it yourself." He grunts. "Also I am physically uncomfortable and getting cramps. Please let me up."
Harry stares at him in wonder. "Who slipped you a love potion?!"
"That's the issue! That's what I did to many, many people! I'm just like your bullies! I deserve no sympathy."
"Is this a Hufflepuff?" Hunter asks.
Blaise takes a deep breath. "I'm... I'm in love with Neville Longbottom."
"Come here, nurse." His mother said, looking right at him.
"No worries. If you feel nervous before tomorrow, just put a bit of this on your neck. You'll get a smell of it occasionally and it will help soothe your nerves." Dumbledore says, handing him the same bottle they used to coat the bracelet.
"No! I just wanted to buy him things." Blaise says.
Hermione and Ron get married in the year of 2002 as well, but months after Neville and Blaise got married. They both work as Aurors at the ministry and also advocate for LGBT+ rights. Hermione also still advocates for House-Elf rights, even as Ron tells her it's useless.
"Are you calling me a Hufflepuff?" Blaise asks, clearly offended. Draco couldn't help but smirk.
Professor Snape's nasally, eerie voice spoke up soon after, "Alright... Dumbledore has decided to make a change in the school. There will be students chosen to be partners in every class with the use of magic, of course... There will be no chance of changing your partners, it's a magically binding contract for you both to be partners for the year regardless of how you think about it... So I suggest you all deal with what you get. Now, we will begin to choose the names now."
"Quiet down!" Snape shouts, "Now, bring Honeywater to a simmer in your cauldron."
A knock came at the door. "Draco?" Harry's voice asks.
"Isn't he supposed to eat bugs?"
"Whose stuff is that anyways?" Hannah asks.
"Yeah. That was pretty stupid of them." Hannah says with an eye rolls.
"Do you need anything, Neville?" Blaise almost whispers.
"Yeah. Be safe!" He calls after her as she walks back inside, her dress softly moving in the wind.
Blaise stares at him and Harry smirks. He got him. "What?!"
Blaise's POV:
"Blaise!" Draco shouts as he gets into his old dorm.
The next morning everyone received their owls from their parents. Draco was no exception. He opened up the letter to reveal his father's neat handwriting. His eyes searched for the Malfoy crest and they landed right on it. 'What new hidden message does he have now?' Draco asks himself. He hopes it isn't anything bad, even though he knows it is. Draco leaves the Great Hall and enters an empty bathroom.
Something then happened to Draco, something he couldn't decide whether he liked or not. On one hand, it took his mind off of everything that just happened. On the other hand, he had no idea what it meant and it honestly made him feel strange. His whole body seemed to tingle and his stomach did flips. Maybe he was in shock?
Myrtle sighs, "I suppose you're right... But I'm still sad. I was made fun of a lot when I was alive, you know. People hit me a lot in school... And laughed and laughed at me."
"Oh no, now I might have to taste bogey!" Draco whined.
That would explain the awkwardness and seemingly lack of interest Neville showed in her. Even though they were dating, he would never stare at her the way he stared at Blaise. In fact, he never stared at her. He never even acknoledged her until she asked him out.
"What did you do to Neville?!" says Hannah Abbott, her face as red as a beet.
Harry sighs, "H-" He grunts softly and walks out.
"I can't! If I keep quiet any longer I'll lose it all!" Blaise shouts. "How could... How..." He heard his voice crack and his breathing get heavy. Blaise was going to lose it for sure.
"I was simply doing what's right... No need to thank me." Blaise says.
He waits for a Slytherin to come along. Coincidentally enough, Blaise Zabini comes trotting down into the dungeon.
"I'm not your master, you know this Maggie." Draco says.
"Because it's impossible to be perfect," Myrtle says, "And that's what makes everything so beautiful. Besides, beauty is subjective and so is normal. Normal doesn't even exist in all reality. But, look on the bright side, at least you aren't me!"
Harry's POV:
Snape then gave him a strange look. He couldn't pinpoint it, but he seemed to know something. He then seemed to regain back his previous emotion.
Draco quickly wipes his face and swallows the slice. "It's amazing!" He says, which makes Molly perk up.
"Huh?" Draco feels a heavy blush hit him.
He looks up and gives a fake smile. "Hi,"
But that wouldn't make sense... He said he wasn't a Hufflepuff. She would be in the Ravenclaw Tower if it was a Ravenclaw. It can't be a Slytherin! That isn't possible!
She liked Draco, yes, but matchmaking was definitely more her passion. Who cares about Draco when you can scheme and get a couple together?! That was exactly what she was going to do.
"Of course. What is it?" He asks.
"Shut up! Don't think you can manipulate me! In fact, I'll get him tested for that love potion and it's gonna come back positive. Then you'll be expelled! Maybe then you'll realize you can't just go around picking on people!" Hannah shouts at him, spinning on her heels with her hair nearly hitting him in the face, and stomping away in a huff.
Draco now blushed heavier. "Can you go away?"
Maggie rushes out the door, not failing to close it behind her. That's another thing he loves about Maggie, other than her kindness, she always closes the door behind her. She was also the only one who paid attention to him at all. Dobby was nice as well, but he was annoying and would often rat him out. Maggie never did, but she also hurt herself a lot for that very reason.
The place is silent other than the soft noises heard from Snape inside.
Draco's POV:
"Mister Potter, come with me," Snape says, grabbing onto Harry's wrist angrily and pulls him out of the Great Hall.
"Because I loved him..." His grandmother smiles to herself, "I've been thinking a lot lately, especially about him and that boy you've been hanging around... I even had a chat about it at your father's grave... A thought came to me, as if your father was speaking to me. I realized just how messed up you had been and how heartbroken you looked when I told you you couldn't see him. A voice said to me, 'Let Neville see him.' I never though it was possible or natural for boys to love boys and girls to love girls... But the more I thought about it and the more I talked to my friends and family about it, the more I realized just how wrong I was. And that voice too kept ringing in my ears. Even though I am incredibly dissappointed with you sneaking out... I think I will allow you to see him again. If I know anything about my past... It seems like you love that boy and I can't take that away from you." His grandmother finishes.
"Don't tell Ron I told you, he'd go ballistic." Harry says. "So, ready to go back inside?"
Blaise's POV:
The next day was all but uneventful. During potions that morning, Goyle towered over Neville Longbottom and threatened to beat him like there was no tomorrow just because he accidentally skipped a step.
"But it's embarrassing to cry over it, right?" Draco asks. "I mean, I shouldn't get emotional over that."
"I'm giving one anyway. Thank you." He whispers with a smirk.
Harry sighs, "Listen, I know what it's like to be afraid... And if your boggart says anything, I know what it's also like to have a terrible family."
"Oh ok... Uh, well why are you so upset?" Blaise asks.
She hesitantly leans towards him and kisses him on the cheek. "Bye, Neville." Hannah says happily and skips away.
Draco enjoyed his pumpkin juice beside the fire. He had to admit, it tasted different but he didn't want to waste it, so he continued to drink it. After he was done, he set off to his new room.
"Dobby has no master, Dobby is a free elf! And Dobby has come here to save Harry Potter and his friends and that is what Dobby will do!" Dobby shouts. He grabs onto Harry, Ron, and Hermione and they begin to vanish away.
Frankly, Potter had him at he could use a good prosecutor.
The man did a great job at the aftercare, as it only took a week for his arse to fully heal. By that time, Draco found himself missing the man intensely. He would have gone sooner, but that would be giving the man clear evidence that he disobeyed the man. He already knew that’s going to cost him.
But that's the moment everything came back, and Harry almost felt the burden pulled his shoulders down like boulders.
Oh, it’s game on now Potter. I have put the golden snitch in your sight. What will you do?
‘You like Quidditch?’ Draco stopped and asked.
Draco could see his lip twitch, and he knew his father was at the edge of exploding. He had pushed father to this point very few times, but he knew father could be a terrifying man once that happened. Though this time, this time he wasn’t going to tear up, wasn’t even flinching.
She might have been tricking him into talking about Potter, the Slytherin she was. But more importantly, she knew him so well. She knew exactly who he always had obsessed with all his life. And of course, he stopped having the latest hot model or athlete on his arm at his birthday parties, right around the time Potter started coming to them. That time they almost got caught by her? It might not just because of luck.
They stood like that for a while, then Draco sighed: ‘Fine.’
‘Why the hell did you bring that up?!’ Draco blushed hard, ‘I had my share of stupid days. It passed.’
There were still twenty more strikes left when Potter released the restraints, taking him in his arms and sat at the couch.
‘You know how the ministry was like. They probably just didn’t want to take the responsibility of its escape, so they faked paperwork about its death. We were surprised when we heard Buckbeak was officially dead.’ Potter shrugged and smiled, somehow, he looked nostalgic and sad, ‘We had a hell of a night, but we managed to save him —— come on. Take a bow.’
A perfect family with the perfect girl, living up to his parents legacy and expectations of the Wizarding world.
He remembered the boy testified at his trial——rather gaunt as the War was still eating at him, the black robe looked like a leaf of sail on him. Still, his back was straight; emerald eyes were bright and calm, every word he said was from a strong heart, a young man determined to lead the world on a new hopeful path of redemption, rebuilding, and a better future.
The man sighed: ‘Sorry.’
‘I would never let… let
Surprisingly, the little silver ball wasn’t cold, warming charm perhaps. Potter rubbed it at the rim a few times, and pushed it in.
That was the last year they were just kids, the greatest worries of their lives were grades and whether their crush would go to the Yule Ball with them. Debatable for Potter, that is. He always had a few life-threatening moments added to those ordinary things, but by this point, it had become commonplace, just another day for him.
Before Draco could figure out what, the man pulled him back into his embrace, kissing him passionately as they made their way to the back door.
Draco looked up at the man.
Draco snorted a laugh sarcastically: ‘That’s high hopes of me. Or maybe I don’t want to deal with his trouble.’
The fake Forgecount raised his wand agitated: ‘No more talking! Where is
Draco talked about what he learned, and needed a little comfort. He managed to get the man talk about himself, but the man cunningly used it against him.
‘No.’ The man said, ‘He deemed it too dangerous.’
‘Me? Er, I think I saw him in Hogsmead a few times.’ Blaise was cued by surprise, normally Draco wouldn’t have believed him, because he would say the earth is flat if that pleases Pansy, but what he said sounded real, ‘but back then he kind of,
Not long after Potter’s birthday, he asked Draco if he would like a kneazle as a pet.
Potter stroked Draco’s cheek and said: ‘I won’t be fastidious on your other behaviours because the goal is one thousand strikes, and it will be difficult for you to remember and follow my rules, so today I will be merciful. Even if you forget, no more punishment will be added. But I still expect you to respect me and do your best.’
‘Because he’s an outsider to the pureblood community, doesn’t know the first thing about pureblood traditions, so he ordered his robe and accessories from my fashion line, including a crash course on how to behave on a pureblood birthday party.’ Pansy bit out, ‘The man makes a good model, I’ll give him that. I see clothes flying off my shelf once he appears on your birthday party. That’s the only reason I agreed to help that bastard.’
After a few seconds of rest, Draco used the last bit of his magic to free Forgecount, threw a few healing spells his way, and since there’s no way they can apparate out of here with only one working wand, he summoned Potter’s broken wand in the hope of repairing it, but no luck.
Anyway, Draco nodded and thanked him.
‘We will pretend we are madly in love.’ Draco said excitedly, the butterflies already swirling in his stomach as he pulled the man back to the bed, smiling as the man slipped his hand up Draco’s dress, ‘And I’ll finally be able to get back at them.’
‘Wear it straight.’ He said as he exited the room.
‘I hope you have her heart, as well.’ Severus said in the end.
Draco breathed out shakily as the last strike landed, he heard Potter whispering to someone, then his hair was pulled to make him turn his head. From the corner of his eye, he saw one of the Doms he flirted with picked up a regular cane; then Potter easily summoned it through the curtain as if the curtain wasn’t tangible.
‘To keep my eyes straight, sir.’ Draco replied, ‘Sorry, sir. But…’
Unfortunately, distraction appears to be the point.
He really needed to focus.
Not that Potter saw it that way.
‘It’s the wand used by my crush too.’
‘Strip and kneel.’ He said.
‘I guess you do deserve a little treat then.’ He said once he trusted his breath to be even.
The man shrugged. Then he asked curiously: ‘When are you going? I’ll spare you the day before.’
Draco blushed a bit and nodded, and Granger concluded: ‘The bottom line is, I had a hand in this situation, and I sincerely apologise for any damage I caused.’
What he did not know was that it was the begging that became his undone. Seeing his beautiful sliver eyes red at the rim, glistening with tears, thin rosy lips abused by his teeth and trembling, spilling words of begging, it stimulated the monster in the man. The monster was imperious to bring him over the edge, to see him break.
‘No! Don’t want to know that!’ Draco shouted.
Draco felt himself froze for a moment, the man just looked at him with a hint of cold smile in his eyes: ‘Do you have a specific memory in mind, or would you just like to be punished for being a bully in general as a start?’
Before he left, he walked up and kissed mother on both cheeks, as they both knew he wasn’t coming back to the manor for the night, and probably wouldn’t for a while.
Frankly it wasn’t a hard thing to do. When Potter wasn’t surrounded by people he clearly didn’t want to talk with, he was devoted to avoid everyone. And Draco got the feeling that he was deliberately avoiding Draco too, making sure he was never too close to Draco so they had to greet. Not really a surprise. Which further falsified the man’s suggestion of apologising to Potter directly.
‘On what grounds?’ Rosier was not happy, taking a step towards Draco, ‘He was the one that…’
Draco would not admit he pouted.
For a while, the news spread, the Gryffindor table erupted into a sea of hope and laughter. Everyone affected by the joy of the would-be parents, temporarily found something to look forward to, a reason to somehow move forward.
Draco gave Elise a raise as apparently, her job's content expanded to picking out her boss’s dating outfit now.
‘Perfect.’ the man smiled just a little, yet the smile did not reach his eyes as they were cold as ice. He raised his wand and the bookshelf turned to reveal a chamber, surprisingly large with almost everything inside, just a glance, and Draco knew there were a few things he don’t even recognise.
Lovegood was happy; she checked Draco’s vitals another time, and smiled: ‘Looks like you are ready for transportation.’
‘Not that it matters, I’m very happy with James. Happier than I ever thought was possible.’ Draco couldn’t help but smile, then he sighed, ‘But like, the last words I said to Potter, after he got me out of the trouble with Aurors and Azkaban, was “what’s wrong with you”, and he put in a good word for me. Like, seriously what’s wrong with him. I just can’t deal with that man…’
Was this what Potter had to deal with? Draco tried to sit upright and thought inappropriately. He probably was the same, acting and talking in ways that contradicted his true thoughts and feelings.
‘Yes.’ Draco was careful. It was the time father got sent to Azkaban. And the time Potter lost his godfather.
He must have looked surprised, as Potter answered his silent question: ‘Last year, at your birthday party. I asked about your thoughts on love; you said Slytherins don’t do love.’
Damn it. You just have to be extremely careful when you talk with a Slytherin. Every word you said can and will be used against you.
‘That’s how you can afford Pansy’s shoes.’ Draco said.
‘I apologise for the trouble I caused, sir.’ Draco said.
Draco just looked up, straight at him, his eyes defiant: ‘I will not. If that’s the condition of you seeing me as your son, I wave my right of succession.’
Draco bit his lip, and cringed at the use of his full name. He knew he deserves it. Something in Potter’s chastisement made him realise the man must have cared for him deeply, and his recklessness truly frightened and hurt the man. He would do anything to show Potter his remorse.
‘What did I say Malfoy?’ Potter chastised over his moaning.
I’m aware that this Chapter took me a while. I’m not a fast writer or a regular poster. Love you if you still follows!
A shiver ran down Draco’s spine; his reasoning struggled one last bit: ‘But…’
The Omega wasn’t able to answer, but as their usual way of communicating, when Harry took his right hand in his, the Omega’s fingers touched and wrapped around Harry’s like melted marshmallows, sweet and endearing.
‘Draco.’
‘I really don’t know that much about love and everything; I hope you would give me a chance to…’ Potter probably was nervous, because he fell back to things he had said before.
‘Surprise! I’m coming back for my birthday! Old place old time? Blaise will be there too. Oh, I
Apparently, the man didn’t abide by stealing —— Draco would say pranking, at worst it's taking other people’s things without asking for consent’, and it’s not like the man didn’t enjoy thinking about Draco wearing it, or that he wouldn’t like it when he sees Draco wear it. Draco argued his point and got his sentence doubled to twenty strikes —— lightly. But that wasn’t the end of it. The bastard made him kneel back on the ground and stretch out both of his hands for another ten strikes.
Draco felt rebellious at Potter’s words for just a moment, before the cane came down harder than before right over his sit spot and shattered his resistance. He jumped and his hands reached for his arse instinctively, he couldn’t actually reach because of the handcuffs, but Potter brought the cane down on his hands lightly, just enough to prickle and startle Draco into clenching his hands, and warned coldly: ‘If this were your attitude of atonement, you can just get up and leave.’
Beautiful women are poisonous.
Draco bit down on his lip, not noticing Potter stared a moment too long at that.
He had slowed when he got to helping Harry into his left sleeve, as the ring of a scar remained, at last, a circle of paler, smooth scar tissue. He ran the tip of his finger along it, and the tattoo around it.
The man looked surprised when he saw Draco, his eyes lit up and whatever he was about to say forgotten.
Kind of talked, after Harry carried out the rest of the punishment.
It’s… Merlin, it’s Buckbeak.
The man had never outright shown any problem with Draco’s long and stubborn crush on Potter, even enjoyed playing the Saviour, and he said he’s fine as long as Draco liked him better, but maybe letting Draco see the real Potter in front of him was a bit too much.
Draco looked away: ‘I’m not going to see him.’
The belt already carried a good bite when the man wrapped it around his hand to shorten it. He couldn’t begin to imagine how painful it would be to be hit by the belt buckle. Not to mention, the man was awfully little when this all happened.
‘He ought to. Judging by the way that sub was behaving, it’s long overdue.’
He won the case, of course.
She then asked Draco to proofread her speech, so Draco knew what she was going to say. It was beautiful, as she truly cared deeply about her students, and memorialised all the souls that were lost in the war.
That was Potter’s intention, obviously, as Potter grinned coldly, walked behind Draco and the paddling began at that.
‘Keep talking; I’ll just
‘You did well.’ Potter said, stroking Draco’s hair, as Draco sobbed, he placed a phantom kiss at Draco’s temple, and Draco cried into Potter’s palm in pain, humiliation and the burning desire. He could tell the punishment was over, but Potter wasn’t exactly satisfied, he was really cross with Draco’s behaviour today, still frowning even after Draco had taken the punishment he deemed fit.
Draco's tough demeanor nearly washes away, but he holds onto it like it was the only thing keeping him from falling to his death. "No. You're always in my way, always in my business. Get out of it and get out of my life!" Draco shouts.
Harry glared at him. "These spells... I can't get them." He admitted.
"Father! I'm telling you, he'd never! Bargyles swarmed him and he's been helping a Gryffindor!" Luna says.
"Of course!" Harry says.
He pulls at it and it reveals a very small room with a small pillar in the middle. The pillar held a red pillow, which Blaise walked towards. The looked on it and found a golden bracelet that sported a metallic lions head right in the middle. Right on the left and right sides of the mane were accent of tiny orange and white gems. Blaise smiles wide. This seems perfect for Neville! But... how is it calming? He didn't feel calm at all...
This isn't important but I just looked up the actor who plays Pansy (Scarlett Byrne) and I just realized how pretty she is. How did no one tell me this and how did I not know like what. My lesbian heart omg. Anyways, I just had to vent about that. Ok, goodbye have a good day.
"No need to get so mad. I just wanted to greet you." Seamus says, rolling his eyes.
"Are you ok?" Harry asks, coming closer to Draco.
"Thank you." Draco says, looking up at Blaise with the smile still plastered onto his face. "And, Blaise?" Blaise raises his eyebrow in response, "Talk to me whenever you need to and if you need someone to smuggle you some food from the house elves before the year ends." Draco smiles wider.
- Pansy: Flamingo (happiest memory: her business becoming successful)
Neville says softly, "But I like you... more than a friend."
"Your hand is so soft." He blurts out, instantly embarrassed by his words. He could feel his face warm up and tries to keep a confident demeanor.
Harry chuckles softly, "Uh... I guess being seen as attractive is a compliment? So... It's ok."
"So that's why you are the way that you are?" Draco retorts back.
He didn't even make an effort to ask what bargyles even were. Blaise scoffs, "If you think I'm into Longbottom, you surely are as crazy as they say."
Neville bites his lip and says, "But what if I'm always bad?"
Both Blaise and Neville grabbed for the spoon at the same time. Their hands brush and Blaise could notice Neville's breath hitch.
Draco sighs. Blaise will never understand. He can never relax, not even at Hogwarts. Draco never plans on telling him the truth either seeing that his loyalities definitely lie with Neville and not him. If he found out Draco was a death eater he'd never see his only friend again.
Draco rolls his eyes. "Give me a break!" He shouts again, his voice cracking from the volume. "I don't want your bloody help! I don't need it!"
He didn't tell her about his relationship with Blaise for many reasons, one of them being he just didn't think it was the time. The other being that he was terrified to tell her. What would he even say if he was asked if he was gay? He doesn't even know the answer to that question. To be perfectly honest, the only person he ever had feelings for was Blaise. Not even once did he think of anyone else or even consider dating anyone else. So, what was he exactly? He didn't think he was gay, but he for sure wasn't straight either. It's not like he wouldn't be open to dating anyone, but the thing is, he hasn't seen anyone that he's liked ever. Only Blaise. That's what confused him the most. But all of those thoughts seemed to dissappear when he was with Blaise. Everything seemed to go away with Blaise. Everything except him and Blaise.
"No, I haven't. In fact, I haven't dranken any alcohol in ten months, thank you very much." Harry retorts.
"Well, I won't say everything but he is homeless and doesn't have any food. I'm worried he'll die." Neville says with urgency, "Just please find him as quickly as possible."
"It's just I might wanna wear it... Ya know... Uh." Harry's cheeks turn red.
He was in shock. Dumbledore was dead and Professor Snape did it. Well, now Headmaster Snape. It all disgusted him and the whole castle afterwards was dark and silent.
Now, he has a better person that doesn't scare him. That's all he needs, right?
- Draco: Homosexual Homoromantic
"Because I demand to know why they didn't say anything. Especially if it was an adult." Harry says angrily.
"Well... maybe you can try to talk to him?" Draco asks.
"Oh, hi, Mr. Potter!" Madame Pomfrey says happily.
"I don't know-"
"I also wanted to ask if you liked the cookies."
"Eh..." Neville replies, his smile slowly fading.
"Hi, Harry!" Ginny says beside him.
Harry turned around, now sporting his abs. They weren't very defined, but it still took Draco's breath away.
"Was I too mean?" Harry asks, rubbing his neck.
TW/CW: homophobia and self-harm
"I'm telling you-"
"Right." Draco responds without a second word. "I mean, nothing felt really true in that moment, but I kept spilling it all out... I guess it was the wrong potion..." He feels so many emotions at once. Anger, sadness, disappointment, but most of all confusion. What in Harry's right mind made him think this way? Maybe he is just trying to convince himself it never happened? Maybe Harry hated it? "I have to go talk to... Pansy." Draco says. Harry nods in response and he grabs his satchel and heads off.
He took another deep breath and checked his surroundings before walking towards the common room. He ran a hand through his hair. What was that feeling?
"I'm sorry... I'm so bad at this. I ruin it every time." Neville says, hiding his face.
"You wanna talk about it?" Hannah asks. Neville nods sadly and Hannah grabs his hand, "Come on," She turns to the wall, "Jelly belly." The wall spreads apart and Hannah leads him into the room.
"No... a Gryffindor." Blaise says.
"Yeah?"
He walks towards her, "Yes?"
"I'll apparate you all there. Grab onto me." Hermione says.
Draco simply looks at him, his wand slightly lowering and his hand softly shaking. But then his grip tightens again and he puts his wand in his pocket. "Fine, I'll leave." He says, pushing past Harry and out of the room.
"Oh, hi." He responds.
"Tell me what's wrong," Blaise says.
"I can't do it!" He hears Draco's voice cry out.
He's terrified that it won't work out, but he doesn't let that stop him from saying, "I'd love to give us a try as well."
"Uh... It's ok..." Harry says, looking down at the ground. He walks over to his bed and covers himself up.
He stood there watching the rest of the hearing unfold.
"Now... gently kick off the ground." Blaise says. Neville looks at Blaise and shakes his head. "If anything happens, I got you, alright? I won't let you get hurt." Blaise assures.
Draco slowly looked at Harry. Harry didn't do the same but instead stared at the door before turning the handle and revealing a medium-sized room with two beds and big windows.
Draco slowly smiles, "Fuck you, Potter."
"I appreciate your kindness, but I'm afraid you wouldn't want me in your house. But I really do appreciate it. I can handle it on my own though, so don't worry about me. If you need anything else to vent about, then do so, but I'll have to go if this is it. If so, goodbye and thank you for listening. You're really a sweet guy, Neville."
"What?" Neville asks, not being able to believe what he is being told.
The scariest part of it was: Draco was no where to be seen. They went home that year due to Luna's father wanting her home.
"Maybe we can tell a few people... Maybe Blaise and Neville. Maybe Luna too." Draco suggests.
Draco's POV:
"We don't have to talk about it, it's just-"
He stomps towards the seventh floor, then turning to the left corridor. There was the wall, empty and grey. He stepped in front of it.
Draco rolls his eyes. "He's single! Seriously, what's the worst that will happen? It's not like he has some powerful girlfriend who will hex you and look on the brightside, it can make you feel better!"
"It's my wand, give it back!" Draco demands.
::Sexualities of the Characters::
"Shut it!" Hermione shouts at Ron, cutting him off. Ron groans and stomps away to his dorm.
He stops, debating once more on whether or not to tell him his house. That would be too risky, right? But maybe it would show him that not all Slytherins are the same? No, he'd just hate him. But... he likes a Slytherin! No, no Blaise you can't.
Pansy smirks, "I overheard him talking about you. He said your kiss was nice and-"
"I can't believe you got paired up with him!" Pansy squeals.
"Really?" Hannah looks up at him hopefully.
He knew it was risky, but he grabbed a pen and began writing: "Please give me a hint to who you are. Anything will work, or maybe more than one. I'm just very curious. I can't seem to think of anything, especially with the Z stamped on the wax. I understand if you don't wish to talk with me, but I really want to at least have some clues to who you are. -Neville." He folds it up and gives it to his owl, who flies away into the darkness.
Neville lays his book down beside him and stands to his feet. "Ok, what is it?"
"Stop being so loud!" He whispered.
He suddenly remembers the necklace he found in that strange dissapearing room. He makes his way to that same room, knowing exactly what to do.
"He's just someone I feel I should protect, you know? Especially since Snape always picks on him..." Blaise sighs, "I bet if I told anyone who it was they'd laugh... Including you. Even though I don't see how he's so laughable? He's an absolute angel."
Draco scoffs, "What will you do if I do say it, huh?"
"He apologized to me today! For the first time ever! Well, not for everything, but for his attitude yesterday. Plus we actually had a civilized class time together today. If nothing else, I'll make him apologize to you guys too." He assures them.
Neville, with one quick elegant swipe, slices the snake to dust. Blaise stares in awe. The dust erupts in dark smoke.
"Potter!" Draco shouts, throwing a wand Harry's way. He grabs it with one hand and throws a spell at Voldemort's snake, but Voldemort blocks it for him.
Professor Snape looks past him with a frown, "Mr. Potter..."
"You made this?" He asks Maggie. She nods in response. "It's really good." He compliments and takes another bite. "Now take it back before we both get in trouble." He says, putting the fork back on the plate and leaning away from it.
Blaise pulls away with his hands up, noticing Neville's cheeks were more red than before. "I stopped. Happy now?" Neville sighs annoyedly with a grin plastered upon his once frowning face. Blaise considers his mission accomplished.
"Nev..." Blaise grabs his arm, making his whole body feel as if it had just gone into shock. Why did he feel this way? "Nev... Look at me." The nickname brings shivers to his spine. He feared what would happen if he did what Blaise said.
"And your bravery. Merlin, you're brave." Blaise chuckles.
Harry stands his guard. "I don't think I will."
A crash is heard and all Draco sees is flames. Good Merlin! Whoever did that, it certainly had Ron running away from them. It didn't make things better, though.
Neville simply nods. He doesn't agree, in fact he thought it was hilarious. He loved it especially because that's the first time he was able to laugh about something with his fellow Gryffindors. It may have been stupid, but it made his year.
"Riddikulus!" The person shouted, turning the dementor into a fumbling Professor Umbridge unable to catch her balance.
"Thank you, Harry. Thank you so so much."
As soon as she finishes, the person who opened the door appears in sight. He gasps and notices Ron and Ginny draw their wands.
"What now, Potter? Are you going to say I'm some evil-"
The nurse goes up to his parents and softly says, "Your mother and son are here to see you."
Neville shakes his head violently, "I'm an idiot!" He whispers.
"Fine." He smiles. "Thank you, really. Tell your father the same."
Neville turns around awkwardly and stares at the front.
He ran through the halls, not failing to catch some laughs from the other students in the halls.
"Welcome, Blaise." Luna says, giving him a side-hug.
Neville thought for a while. Well, he does think she is pretty, but he can't tell if he likes her. The only crush he had was way back in first year and it was Katie Bell. But even he got over that pretty quickly. Then comes the question of, well what even is a crush? But then he realized, if he didn't try now he may never find love ever.
"You can't fool me, Neville." She says with a smile.
"Good, now, Harry apologize to Draco," Dumbledore demands.
"Never." Blaise says, grabbing his arm and giving him a warm smile.
"No... It's just..." Neville sighs. He's shocked he can still sit here without hyperventilating and rocking back and forth like a maniac, but it felt nice, even though he knows a part of him wants to freak out right now. Something about it being a boy makes him very happy, but he doesn't know why. Maybe because it's something different? It's not like he knew the person, so he shouldn't care. Besides, he has a girlfriend.
"Zabini, come here!" Snape shouted.
"Wanna steal food from the house-elves like old times?" Draco suggests.
"Very well." Snape stomps off with the swish of his cloak.
Harry gives him a look of curiousity, so he continues on. "You saved my life... Twice actually." He looks at the ground and mutters, "And saved me from that boggart."
"Are you kidding me?!" Harry almost shouts, catching the attention of a couple of Slytherins and Gryffindors.
Neville and Blaise both had gotten married in the year of 2002 and stayed married until their death. Blaise had decided to drop the name 'Zabini' and is now Blaise Longbottom. They had one child named Naya Longbottom when had gotten sorted into Slytherin. When Naya was six years old, Neville had gone to visit his mother and learned that she was able to talk to him again! She didn't remember anything after the incident that put her in the hospital, but she was amazed to see her son all grown up and be able to meet his husband (which she supported fully) and their daughter. Sadly, though, she died two days later.
As soon as he takes it back to his seat and get comfortable, George, Arthur, and Ron all attack the pie.
"Are you sure you got veritaserum?" The boy asks.
"B-but you don't k-know me." Neville stutters, worried about the response.
Harry begins to pull away but Draco stops him and delicately connects their lips. Their lips move in perfect sync with each other. He feels like he's in heaven.
"Yeah, yeah I get it. Wait... did you say Harry-"
"I'm glad he's socializing for once. I was worried he'd never talk to anyone else." Harry says.
"Thank you for saying it nicely." Myrtle smiles and disappears into the wall.
"Not Neville, though," Blaise says.
Draco sits down beside him and puts his arm around him. "I can't begin to understand how you feel. But, I can say I'm terribly sorry."
Luna is the last to exit the door. "I say let's go to Neville's house first. I don't think Blaise knows where it is, but we can check." Luna suggests.
"Oh, what is it?" Neville asks.
With that, Blaise Zabini strolls to the center of the classroom and tries the Patronus charm. A simple small light comes out and almost forms a shape, but quickly disappears.
Harry chuckles, "Relax, Malfoy. I was only joking. Unless..."
It was fairly easy to read, other than the occasional messy letters on the page. The sentences seemed to tilt down a bit, which indicated this person wasn't skilled at penmanship. The first line makes Blaise perk up.
"I-I won't! I promise! I just got distracted, but I won't ever again, I promise you." Draco says, trying to hide the shakiness in his voice.
"No, it isn't, Mister Longbottom," McGonagall said, staring at him while fuming. "Goyle, come with me!" She then turned to Neville once more and whispered, "The password is Sherbet Lemon. Wait there for me." She then strolls off, holding Goyle by his arm and pulling him with her.
"Do you see him?!" Snape shouts, "Get out of my way." He demands, pushing Harry towards the side then briskly walking away.
Blaise looks at him in utter confusion and raises an eyebrow.
Draco's POV:
Draco couldn't help but feel sorry for Neville. But pity wasn't the only thing he felt. He felt empathy. Something like that happening to Draco would shake his whole world and he'd never be able to face his father or the school ever again.
"Nothing. I was just... Curious." Harry says, reaching over to grab a book from his school bag.
"Harry Potter is dead!" Voldemort shouts. His followers cheer and laugh, and so does he.
"To the student who stole my veritaserum, there will be great consequences when I find you. Don't think I won't. In fact, there will be fifty points taken from whomever has taken it." Snape finishes eerily, not failing to glare at him. He gulps and stares back at him, fearing that if he looked away, he'd get points taken. Or worse, humiliated.
"But... Why? Why would you like me? I'm not much to look at at all and I'm boring for sure. Why in the world would you like me?" Neville asks.
"Me too. He seems to feel better. I hope he keeps doing this... It might be a good distraction for him." Blaise says.
"Hello, sister." His aunt's voice came in.
"Yeah well... Maybe I should talk to you about that. Neville can't even come to Hogwarts to help fix the castle anymore... His grandmother saw us kiss and... Yeah it didn't go so well."
"Dirty sock! Bleh!" He shouts, spitting it into the nearest trash bin. However, that slight smile still remained.
They show up in the dining room and without even a second to relax, his father drags him to his office and pushes him into a chair.
"Just trust me. Sometimes the hard decision is the right decision. Don't always take the easy route. It'll be scary, but it's the right thing to do." Dumbledore finishes, making Draco give him a confused stare. Dumbledore simply chuckles. "Alright, you may go now."
"You really mean that? You would both do that?" Draco asks.
"Since late in fourth year. At least that's when I realized that my observing was turning into something weird that I didn't understand. Then, during the summer I realized I had a crush on him. That ruined me for months until I finally accepted it. Then one day... the feelings just got so strong and he couldn't possibly be described as a simple crush anymore. That ruined me for months as well... Now here I am again, ruined by it. But I'll never forget how it felt to think about him. It made all those problems wash away for a while and I dreamt while I was awake. While my life was miserable, just knowing I'd get to see Neville again made me want to stay alive." Blaise finishes, worried he just gave out too much information.
