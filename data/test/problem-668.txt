but Harry found himself unable to breath evenly. A feeling of nausea was settling in his stomach, forcing him to concentrate on his breath even more. What the
Back in his room, Harry opened the door to his balcony that had been ajar for a few hours now, letting in the sounds of cars, motorcycles and drunk people laughing and talking loudly outside. The sounds of civilization were soothing to Harry, letting him know that he was not isolated. He decided to step out on the balcony like he did most of the nights where he just couldn't sleep, no matter how often he counted to 100 or tried to concentrate on every limb of his body pressed to the mattress. Over the course of the three months he had lived with Francis and Asteria, the balcony had become his safe space, his spot, his anchor during long nights. The air was crisp, almost fresh but Harry didn't mind when goosebumps began to form on his bare arms. He watched a happy couple on the street, arms flung around each other and was able to relax a little when it hit him: The room adjacent to his was empty, meaning that no-one would disturb his peace on his balcony. Well, at least until someone would move into the room. There was a french door to this very balcony, too. And unfortunately, Harry now knew very well who this someone would be.
"Do stay for lunch, Harry, darling", Hermione suggested. Ron was already setting the table, anxious of what his girlfriend would cook today. They took turns cooking, so desperately trying to improve that it melted Harry's heart every time he saw it, but, frankly, they were both shite when it came to cooking. At the end of the day, they'd always end up with takeaway or frozen meals intended for single households, sharing it because they, indeed, were not a single household. "Yeah, sure. Want me to give you a hand?", Harry proposed carefully, not wanting to hurt his friend's feelings, even though he was well aware of the fact that she knew she couldn't cook. Even though Harry had been forced to learn how to cook when he was little, fearing verbal torment from the Dursleys, he'd found that cooking actually was a very calming thing to do. Still, he was careful, remembering the last time he'd helped out (at the end Hermione had been at the edge of tears, Ron had been soothing her and Harry had run to the nearest pizza place to buy a family pizza for the three of them). "That's fine, love", she replied, assumingly remembering as well.
“I’m not as much of a plebian as you might think, Potter”, he stated, his gaze still fixated steadily on Harry’s eyes. “Oh don’t play that card Draco, we all know that you usually only rewatch movies because you have a thing for the actors“, Pansy laughed. Oh, this was getting more and more interesting, Harry thought. Draco was gay, everyone knew that. But having it confirmed over and over again did something to Harry.
“No, me neither. Let’s watch it then, shall we? Draco, can you rent it while Pans and I wait outside? I really need a smoke”, Theodore said and Harry couldn’t help but wonder why he looked a little conniving while he said it.
A lot of embarrassment later (Draco had stepped out of the little corner while Harry was already talking to the customer, lips swollen and hair a mess) and said customer had started grinning.
“It’s special effects right? That’s how Muggles call them?”, Draco asked. “Right, yeah. Well, how about
It was past 11 pm and Harry could feel himself growing impatient. These past few days, Draco had always been back way earlier.
A few moments passed in silence, but it was strangely comforting. The steady inhale and exhale from Draco’s direction was calming and Harry experienced no pressure to talk. But still, he was glad when Draco started the conversation anew.
. Yes, it is indeed a Weasley product. It requires the drinker to kiss the person they fancy the most”, he made a dramatic pause while gazing around the group of Eight Years. Since the beginning of the new year, a small group of students had been meeting up every Saturday evening in their new shared common room  to “overcome differences”, as Hermione put it. Who would have thought this implied snogging whoever’s closest.
Draco looked confused now, so confused that Harry realized that Draco must have truly believed it. Who the hell was he talking about, though? Ron?!
Harry stood, not knowing what to say. He accepted the cup and opened the plastic lid. A whiff of honey-scented milk filled his nose.
?”, Harry suggested now. Fuck, why couldn’t he focus with Draco in his proximity? This was getting embarrassing.
"Oh, it's you", Harry uttered, extremely relieved. "Don't worry, I'm not the hot blonde still sleeping on our sofa that has a weird obsession with calling you by your last name", Francis smirked, closing the door behind him. He immediately flung himself on Harry's bed, beaming. Harry was rendered speechless.
“That’s so weird, Malfoy, what did you mean by that?”, Ginny asked, after having scrutinized Harry for a bit.
ago that he'd be sitting on his bed pondering about the best possible way to approach Draco Malfoy who now was living in his flat and had almost kissed him, he'd have declared that person to be absolutely ludicrous. Now, though, he was slurping the soup Asteria had made him after hearing from Francis that their roommate must have "caught something". Yeah,
Sunday passed in an excruciatingly slow way, leaving Harry with nothing to do but pity the fact that each thing he wanted to do was clouded by a stinging headache. Grimmauld Place felt deserted, now that Kreacher had left- Harry wasn’t familiar with the elf’s whereabouts- and the voices from the portraits did not necessarily leave him feeling welcomed. When he first moved in, he had experienced a feeling of euphoria and a wave of anticipation for his future had hit him when he had first seen the decrepit state of the rooms. He had wanted to get to work immediately, had visions for each room and was even willing to get Hermione and Luna on board, who had offered their help when he’d announced he’d be moving to Grimmauld Place 13 on his own. But tangled in between long hours at the Ministry and even longer hours trying to fall asleep, his motivation had vanished quicker than it had arrived. Everything looked exactly as it had when he first moved in, maybe even a shade darker, a bit dustier and definitely a bit lonelier.
After contemplating his options, Harry chose to leave his room in order to get Francis not to call Hermione. Not that he didn't want to see her, though. He just really did not have the slightest clue of what to say and lying wasn't an option since she was able to see through him at any point. His head was aching more than before and his vision almost faded from all the sleeping. He poured himself a glass of cold water and sat down next to Francis who was watching a TV-show on one of their three channels. No-one in their flat could be bothered to try to access more than these three but as far as Harry was concerned, they sufficed. "Hey, enough with the long face! Come on", Francis complained amicably. He soon understood that he would not get anything out of Harry and just scooched a little closer and laid a protective arm around Harry. As a response, Harry laid his head on his friend's shoulder.
"Counterproductive?", Harry asked, wondering if she meant that a new phase of obsessing over Draco Malfoy would be a bad way to pass the time. "You're taking this sabbatical to relax for a while, remember? Malfoy would only distract you from coming to terms with what you want to do with your life."
Luna took the glass and brought it to her lips, drowning the shot instantly. Everyone was staring at her, thrilled and sceptical all at once. A few seconds passed, but nothing happened. Luna was still seated, looking dreamy. “Do you feel something?”, Hannah Abbott asked curiously, glancing at her friend. “Not really. Just feels… nice”. A few disappointed huffs were audible, the anticipation dying down instantaneously.
he was feeling. To stress this, he moved a hand to the back of Draco’s neck and slowly moved it into his hair and let his fingers run through it. To that, Draco opened his mouth slightly and then they were kissing again, fiercer this time, with more deliberateness, more certain of each other’s feelings.
“You wouldn’t mind me dropping by on Tuesday, right? I was a little scattered last week so I forgot to rent a new movie”
“That’s wonderful! I’m so happy-”, Harry exclaimed, but Sarah had already slung her arms around him.
“Why the hell would you think that?”. Draco sounded hurt. He was backing off more and more from Harry, seemingly decreasing their vicinity with every word Harry said.
Draco closed the small distance between them and instead of crushing his lips onto Harry’s, he brushed his thumb softly over Harry’s cheek, looking in his eyes and asking: “Can I?”. Harry, unable to bring out a cohesive sentence, only nodded.
Harry was embarrassed. He had obviously wished for Draco to invite him. Of course, Harry’d always known that Draco was good-looking. Very attractive, even. But that was it, right? The guy was unbearable and presumptuous. At least, that was what he was supposed to be.
And just like that , the popcorn, cologne and Draco Malfoy himself had disappeared out of Harry’s sight.
"Morning, Harry", he heard Asteria say. She was busy watering the plants and herbs situated in their kitchen. It left Harry in awe every time he saw her do it, touched by the amount of love she poured into each and every one of their plants. Harry scanned the kitchen area after he'd found the living room empty, not yet ready to admit to himself what he was looking for. "There's coffee in the pot", she stated, shooting him a smile. Harry nodded appreciatively. "I'm sorry, by the way. I didn't know Draco was close enough to hear my remark about him having a crush on you. It was meant to be a joke, darling". She sounded a little embarrassed and Harry had absolutely no clue what to respond, so he didn't. "Seems to be a touchy subject", she added, clearly hoping to get something out of Harry. "Yeah, there's a lot of history between us, you know". "Still, you could have said no to his moving in, yet you didn't. I don't mean to pry, love, I'm sorry". Harry couldn't help but be endeared by her excessive use of endearments. He usually cringed when someone did it as abundantly as she did, but somehow didn't mind at all. "It's fine. i just don't know how to put it in words".
“I’m- I’m not even sure this is the right job for me. Ron is so much more invested- Hell, everyone is so much more dedicated than I am, yet Willinger chose me. I don’t want to take something I have not earned”
“Isn’t that kinda lame?”, Dean asked, looking at Blaise who he supposed made the rules and therefore could answer his question. “Just wait until you hear her response”, Draco intervened, looking suspiciously content. “Let’s hear it, Lovegood. That is, of course, you do not prefer to kiss the person you desire most. Could be a welcomed change since you Gryffindor’s are all too fucking lame. You too, Dray.”, Pansy uttered, looking quite nonchalant.
Praying that no one noticed his problem at hand, he pressed his right hand behind his back, demonstrating that he would follow the rules. He had just wanted to start when he heard Potter whisper: “Relax, Malfoy”. Perplexed, he stared at the boy being as confused as Seamus was in Potions. Even though Potter’s words had bewildered him, he had also found some sort of comfort in them, finally starting to bring his left hand to Potter’s belt. He fumbled with the belt buckle, trying to loosen it while his breath hitched.
Harry never finished his sentence because Draco's lips were pressing against his and his lips now had other things to do than talking. The kiss was careful at first and Draco's lips were just as soft as he'd imagined them to be, hell, even softer and when he started tugging at Harry's messy hair, Harry didn't see why they should be careful any longer and turned their kiss into a more determined one. It was messy and Harry was pretty sure he could feel a tear mixing up with their saliva. Their lips moved in unison, making Harry forget everything he ever thought he knew about kissing before. He could feel Draco's hand fumbling with the string of Harry's hoodie and in response he brought a hand to Draco's hair and almost melted when he felt the softness of it. He knew that Draco took great pride in his hair and feared that he might not like it when Harry made it messy, but the moan the blonde let out assured him that that was not the case at all.
“Care to elaborate, Blaise, darling?”, she cooed forgedly, knowing full well what he had in mind. “Why, yes, Pansy. This is a phial of the infamous
Draco scoffed. "Of course you'd say that. That saviour complex of yours is still present then, huh?"
Malfoy quirked up an eyebrow. "Yes, Potter, I do or will be as soon as Francis asks me to". "See, then you have every right to be here on this balcony as well"
What he wasn’t used to, though, was having something worth pondering about, something that made him experience a flutter in his stomach whenever he allowed last night‘s occurrences to encompass his whole being. There had been a misunderstanding, yes, but he suddenly felt so close to this new side of Draco he‘d discovered. He yearned to explore it, shuffle through all the pages that held the intricacies of the other’s emotions. There seemed to be a version of him that was tender, vulnerable and considerate.
“Oh, I know”, Harry said, just when Ron arrived, breathing heavily and beads of sweat on his face. “I’m here. I’m ready”
“Very well. Let’s see… Longbottom. You either kiss the person you desire the most or you give the person sitting to your left a hickey. A scandalously big one, might I add”, Blaise demanded, looking smug because the person sitting next to Neville was no other than
Draco walked towards his room and Harry got up to follow, but was left dumbstruck when the blonde closed the door after him. Confused, Harry stood in the living room but soon went to his own room to reach the balcony from there. Malfoy was already sitting in his usual seat, looking out at the night sky. "Did you know we now have 2 people with celestial names in our flatshare?", Draco asked after Harry had sat down as well. "I do, now", Harry replied. "I really am craving some chocolate", he added, emboldened by the smile Draco had given him after his reply.
Reluctantly, he opened his eyes. He met Draco’s eyes, which seemed to sparkle with emotion, want, desperation. He crashed his lips on the other boy’s again, this time giving away all he felt. There was a crash of teeth but it didn’t matter, it didn’t make a difference. At this very moment, Harry suddenly knew exactly what he had to do. He opened his eyes again, met Draco’s again, who looked at him with curiosity. Harry brought his index finger in front of his lips- they needed to be quiet. He motioned to the door and quirked his eyebrow in a questioning manner. The Slytherin just smirked. Hoping they didn’t make a sound- which in hindsight, frankly, was pretty damn improbable but the two of them had no time to think- Harry got to his feet. Pulled from an emotion that both of them had been burying for too long, they rushed to the door on tiptoes.
Harry inhaled deeply and noticed that a shiver ran across his back. He’d known that this matter had worried him over weeks now, but hadn’t been aware that it would be able to make him shiver like that.
Saturday evening was almost there and Harry was torn apart between malingering through the evening so that he wouldn’t have to go to The Bull Eye and showing up with a fabricated enthusiasm that he would slowly work up with drinks. After pondering about his possibilities and one urging firecall from Seamus later, he was standing in front of the bathroom mirror to tame his hair. His beard was finally freshly shaven again and he’d even got himself to wear a black button-up with linen trousers, a fashion choice he hadn’t made three years ago but was now able to pretend he felt comfortable in. Well, mostly he had managed to gather the confidence from the various compliments Ginny, Luna and Hermione (sometimes even Blaise, which was a boost Harry lived on for days after) had given him when he first wore something outside his comfort zone.
He almost hustled towards Russell Square, noticing that this walk of his was really anything but calming and forced himself to sit down on a bench to catch his breath. It was chilly and Harry feared his ears might fall off. He pulled down his beanie even further and let his body clasp against the backrest. Small drops of rain were beginning to fall down from the angry looking sky, slowly accumulating in the wool of his beanie. Fucking fantastic. What the hell am I doing? Waiting for Draco bloody Malfoy of all people to return and give me his stupid attention?, Harry thought, agitated. Minutes passed and a pedestrian gave him a pitiful look. Hell, he must have really looked miserable.
"Harry, mate, there's someone on the phone for you", Francis called from across the apartment. Harry hurried towards the phone in the hall, leaving the pile of laundry he'd been folding the Muggle way behind. "Hello?"
Harry ushered to the aisle where it was stored: Pictures produced by John Hughes. It was a popular choice, thus he found it immediately. Back at the counter, Draco was still leaning against it while Harry typed the number of the movie into the computer programme. Harry could smell the sweet, syrupy smell of the popcorn Draco had placed next to his elbow, but it was mixed with something more ebony and rich which indubitably was his cologne. The silence between them made Harry want to squirm in discomfort. He had to say something. “Didn’t take you for the sweet guy, Malfoy”, Harry muttered, now daring to look up from his computer only to fixate the popcorn in front of him. “Oh, I’m terribly sweet in the right spots, Potter”, he replied. Harry looked up and saw Draco staring at his fingers on the keyboard. There was a shade of red in the Blonde’s cheeks. What kind of innuendo was that supposed to be?
On Friday afternoon, Harry was running on his fourth coffee and two solid hours of sleep and, as the mirror in the restroom had so kindly told him, looked like it. He was just about to go into Willinger’s office to enquire permission for a request Ron wanted to file, when his name was called. He immediately recognized the slight drawl in which his name was being so carefully enunciated in and turned around to find Draco in front of him. He was wearing dark robes with a characteristically green tie tied around his neck, a wave of his cologne hitting Harry at once. Draco surely hadn’t come from the Healing Department on the sixth floor to the first floor just to come look for him?
But maybe he wasn’t about to let go. Harry took a seat. Whatever piece of information he was about to receive, he was sure a sedentary position would help. “Apologies, mate. It must have sounded like total wonkers what I said earlier. All serious and stuff! But no. Remember when I said I met a new lady?”, he continued. Harry nodded, repulsed by the use of the word “lady”, but he smiled nonetheless. “Well, her weans need someone to take care of ‘em. You know. Money- wise and all. So me and my lady are getting hitched. We’re going to have a wee little ceremony and afterwards..”, he paused, obviously trying to create suspense. Harry played along and looked at him with feigned anticipation. “We’ll have a honeymoon in Crete! Isn’t that something?”, he finished, beaming. “Congratulations! I’m sure Crete is marvelous'', Harry said, smiling. He still couldn’t figure out why he was asked to sit here, though.
“We’re just concerned, mate. What’s the matter, anyways? We barely talk about heavy stuff anymore”, Ron said softly. Hermione looked at him and nodded. “Yes. Just because the war‘s over doesn’t mean we can’t talk about that kind of stuff anymore. We miss you. And we’re sorry if us moving in together ever felt like something even remotely resembling betrayal to you“. It felt selfish wanting to hear these things, but it felt good nonetheless. Between work and caring about his mental health, Harry had ceased to look for Hermione and Ron‘s advice and it only now dawned on him what he had been missing out on. Sure, they met up at least twice a week, but one out of the two was always in a group where alcohol was more popular than chagrin.
sums it up quite well". Harry was at a loss. He didn't want to urge Draco to talk about things he wasn't ready for or simply did not want to, so instead of replying he simply kept silent.
“Mate, wake up”, he heard a voice whisper, and he realized it must be Ron’s. He opened his eyes to see the red’s face close to his, concern discernible in his features. “We were supposed to meet at ours 3 hours ago! Are you okay?”
"Can I come in?". Harry was standing at Ron and Hermione's porch, shivering from the cold. The seasons had melted into another without Harry noticing, hence he wasn't wearing anything to protect him from the icy temperatures. "Harry, love, of course! I'm afraid we have to leave in five, though", Hermione explained in a rush. She was already going back to their small kitchen that looked like an outright mess and clearly expected Harry to just follow and close the door behind him. "I'm sorry about the mess. Ron's and my cooking really isn't improving." There were pans and pots scattered across the whole kitchen counter and Harry thought he could identify a... cauldron? "Where are you headed", Harry asked. "We're meeting my parents tonight. Ron's out buying flowers and I'm meeting him at the Apparition point in Chelsea. Is everything alright? You look..." Hermione was now staring at Harry's appearance that, frankly, was a little concerning. His hair was even messier than usual and the dark circles under his eyes were clearly not indicating something good. "Yeah, it's fine. You go ahead and meet Ron. Call me when you're free". "Harry, I'm terribly sorry... I'll definitely call you tomorrow evening, okay? And you're coming over the day after tomorrow for dinner, right?" Harry only nodded.
“So, as the great savior an’ all, you must be thrilled to take over the department for me for a week, yes?”
He locked eyes with Draco again and Harry was about to close his eyes and lean in even more, when all of a sudden, Draco increased their distance again and the feeling on Harry's lips as soon as Draco had pulled his thumb back was cold and completely terrifying.
Harry shot up in surprise, jerking awake. Still dizzy from sleep and the lack thereof, he rubbed his bleary eyes and contemplated going back to sleep or to the kitchen where the plangent sound that interrupted his sleep had come from. Since he'd moved in with Asteria and Francis, he was not only able to get out of the slump he'd found himself in since the war, he'd also had found a myriad of reasons why he didn't want to go to sleep just yet. Harry was fascinated by Asteria and Francis' nightly talks that included just about everything, comforted by the faint smell of chamomile coming from their ridiculously large tea cups and the ample incense sticks Asteria found herself igniting as one hour melted into the next. It was a distraction - Harry refused to admit to himself that he was still petrified of going to sleep, fearing another nightmare would accompany him through the night.
“Is it always so exciting with you then, Potter?”, Draco asked once they were alone again, Harry standing behind the counter and Draco leaning against it. Harry only grinned. “A pity we didn’t start sneaking around at Hogwarts, would’ve made everything a lot more interesting”, Draco continued. Then he leaned over, lightly pulled at the collar of Harry’s shirt and pressed a small kiss to his lips, let go of his shirt again, ran a hand through his own hair and winked. A second later, he was gone. Harry still stood behind the counter, dumbfounded.
“Alright, who’s next, then?”, Harry asked. Theoretically, it would have been Blaise’s turn to pick someone, seeing that his mouth was preoccupied, though, Dean took the initiative and asked Ron to either tell the group about his secret fetish (implying he had one) or try the
“He’s 32. And actually, it wasn’t that stupid. It was very sweet. Sometimes I behave like a bitter old lady”, Draco now looked at him, deeply.
"Francis law studies rubbing off on you?", Malfoy joked, wearing that same little smile on his face that felt almost as if Harry was part of something private. Like a private joke they shared. It was a nice feeling and Harry hated it.
“Too chicken-shit to join, Golden Boy?”, Blaise asked, suddenly very interested in the Gryffindor’s reluctance and even keener on making him join the group. “I’d rather get eaten by snakes than kiss the person I desire”, Harry mumbled, seeming annoyed. Any person that knew him, though, could see that he looked a little
“Does wanting to shag the person no matter who’s involved count, too?”, Draco asked matter-of-factly, as if he didn’t just say something that translated into:
“Salazar, you must really be scared to kiss the person you desire, mate”, Ron commented, looking at Neville with a hint of pity and at Malfoy with a hint of revolt. He eyed Harry, expecting to see an equally disgusted grimace on his best friend’s face. The look Harry was wearing, though, was inscrutable. He was looking zoned-out and completely focused at the same time, confusing his red-haired friend.
The three of them had decided to cook together (bad idea, Hermione and Ron were infamous in their friend group for always eating frozen meals, and it turned out they had been right to do so) and sit on their tiny balcony to watch over the city. A small weight was lifted from Harry‘s chest, still he could not quite explain what was troubling him. But this, this was beautiful. This was something Harry had been missing.
Draco was staring at him, his eyes pierced to his own and Harry quickly looked away, but when he looked back after a second, Draco’s eyes remained set on him. “Umm, you guys?”, Pansy intervened, “we came here for a movie, not a staring contest, remember?”. Harry could feel his cheeks heat up and he focused on Pansy instead. “Yes, absolutely, right. Let’s see… Um, have you got anything… in mind?”. “Stop baffling us with your eloquence, Potter”, Draco uttered in a teasing tone and Harry tried his best not to pay him any attention, fixating his eyes firmly on Pansy. “Shush, Draco”, she intervened, “No, we were hoping for a recommendation, like we said. Genre doesn’t matter”.
A change of scenery was exactly what Harry had been yearning for all week, and that was what he got when he entered the videothek again, already seeing Sarah’s bouncing ponytail through the window. The welcoming chime of the bell made Harry relax a little, Sarah’s enthusiastic hug made him feel warm inside. “I’m in a rush, Henry got us tickets to a movie in half an hour! You look handsome as ever, boo”, Sarah beamed when he released Harry from her hug. “Oh, that’s great! Better hurry, then”, Harry replied and gave her one of his worn-out smiles. Sarah was always just a flying pile of clothes and a bouncing ponytail, always too late to stay for long but still early enough to utter some kind words in Harry’s direction.
“I dare you to sit in Hannah’s lap for the next three rounds or to try the potion”, Ron declared after a few seconds had passed. Draco shot a look at Abbot, who, of course, was blushing heavily. He rolled his eyes at the sight. Potter would never be interested in
It was true. Ron had started Auror training without him and Hermione was studying to become a member of the department of Muggle liaisons. He himself, however, was currently doing tarot readings for fun with Asteria and playing board games with Francis, while both of them actually went to university, leaving him to be the only one completely clueless with what to do with his life. "Well, what do you want me to do? I can't tell him to leave now, he's unpacking his things as we're speaking". "How about giving him a chance? See if he's really changed. If not, we're always here for you, Harry. You could always move in with us."
“Alright, mate, you can come back to your seat”, Ron chimed in, rudely interrupting Harry’s new found relishment: Draco Malfoy’s eyes. Startled, Harry sloped back to his seat, feeling his trousers grow tighter with every second passing, he hecticly put the hoodie that he’d been wearing at the beginning of the night in his lap, hoping no one would notice. He felt the heat rise to his cheeks, when Hermione leaned into him and whispered: “Malfoy, huh?”.
“Sorry, your card here tells me that you’re still missing 50 pounds”, Harry explained for the third time. The man wanted to rent a movie but still had an imbalance on his account that made it impossible for Harry to give out a movie to him. The man seemed to be visiting every night then, not only on Tuesdays. “I’m sure we can solve this differently… Harry”, he said, ostensibly having read Harry’s name tag. He now was giving Harry such a ridiculously lascivious look that Harry wanted to flee immediately. But then, a miracle happened. Well, not a
Harry was ten minutes early, so he waited in front of Willinger’s office. He had informed him that they would quickly go over all the details before he departed.
could sedate me with”, Draco replied and Harry could see him slowly sucking in a small part of his under lip.
. But even the people living in a dystopia had a more satisfying love life than he had. And while he watched the movie he couldn’t help but wonder what Draco would think about the movie.
His eyes wandered to the other empty chair, which was clearly occupied, a leather jacket placed on the back of the chair. His pulse seemed to accelerate since he knew whose jacket it was. “Better late than never, ay, mate?”Seamus nudged him playfully. Harry turned to look at him and gave him a wide grin. “Could have sworn we said 8”, he muttered under his breath. The vacant chair on the opposite end of the table made him gittery, he knew it was time for a drink.
"You can stay on the sofa for tonight, mate", Francis offered. Him calling Draco his "mate" made Harry's head hurt even more. He'd developed a head-ache in the last five minutes. Understandably, he told himself. "Alright, I'm going back to sleep", Harry announced, half to himself, half to Francis who was carrying a duvet and a light blue pillow towards Malfoy who was busy throwing magazines and vinyls off the sofa, looking composed but Harry spotted a hint of sheer panic in the blonde's eyes. Harry had always guessed that Malfoy was a tidy person, but having it proven was oddly satisfying to him.
“Here you go”, he said, now standing next to Harry. He made everything look so easy. As if parties weren’t full of discomfort and awkwardness, as if it came naturally to him to now casually put a hand around Harry’s waist and say: “Your dress looks gorgeous” to Sally.
“I don’t think we can force anyone to do anything. You can sit this one out, Draco, darling. Or you can just kiss them and we’ll promise not to look.”, Luna said, earning a grateful smile from Malfoy. As obscure Harry found their friendship, he couldn’t help but agree with her. If he had to choose between the tasks Malfoy was given, he would be
After Hogwarts, he found himself moving to Grimmauld Place 13 and starting the auror training along a mini job he’d accepted: the right mixture of insomnia and unrelenting clamour coming from the portraits, Walburga Black in particular, had motivated Harry to accept a job at a videothek every Tuesday night from 9 pm until 1 am. It was weird how places could hold feelings of belonging and even intimacy. He experienced it right now, sat between his friends and nipping on one drink after the other, but also when he was seemingly encompassed by dazzling, harsh white light and the intermittent red and blue light streaming from various signs in the shop, sorting and rearranging videotapes and often remaining undisturbed.
"I can tell you're staring at me", Draco muffled, letting Harry snap back to the present. "Can you blame me?", Harry asked, his voice raspy from sleep. "Obviously not, Potter". "I go down on you twice and you still call me that?", Harry joked. Draco finally looked up and positioned himself so he could meet Harry's eyes. And the fondness and awe Harry saw there made him want to surrender to this beautiful man again and again and again until the sun would cease to shine and reflect on Draco's hair, so never or at least not in his lifetime.
Alright, this was something Harry could manage. Out of the hundreds of movies he had seen throughout his life, he surely could come up with one that would please the three of them. It had all started out when he was living with the Dursleys. When he was sent to his room after dinner, he tried to sneak back into the living room as often as possible. His Invisibility Cloak came in handy in the Dursley’s living room almost as often as in the corridors of Hogwarts. The movie choices had always been the quite obvious, popular ones, like Disney movies for Dudley and later dense comedies for Petunia and Vernon. No matter how bad the picture, Harry had always been fascinated by the art that is filmmaking. Then later, once he got his own place, movies were what distracted him from his insomnia, placated him after a nightmare and enabled him to have a ugly-crying-session whenever he felt like it. So this should be easy, right?
“I’ll go fetch myself a drink, anyone else want something?”, Harry asked as he pushed the chair back to get up. “Just a Butterbeer for me, mate”, Ron, who was sitting across from him next to Hermione and, again, the wall.
He could see the blonde lying on his bed reading and judging from the color of the pages Harry assumed that it was one of Draco's old potion books. Gathering his courage he knocked at the door twice. Draco jerked upright in surprise and seemed to be confused for only a modicum of a second about where the sound had come from. He met Harry's eyes. The look he was wearing seemed almost pained. Instead of walking towards the door, he went back to reading. Harry let out a sigh. What the hell is happening? Determined, he knocked again. Draco would not get rid of him that easily. And it worked. Annoyed, Draco walked towards the door and opened it. "What do you want, Potter?", he asked brusquely. "For you to tell me what the fuck you think you're doing. Why are you ignoring me all of a sudden?". Harry spoke in such a confident manner that he surprised himself. "Honestly, piss off".
Harry was late. By a full hour. He thought they’d said to meet at 8 pm, but apparently it had been 7, so naturally, all the heads turned to look at him when he approached their table. Between a myriad of “hello”s and shouted “mate!”s, Harry grinned and sat down at the only space available, namely next to Seamus and, well, the wall.
When the door closed with a plangent sound, Harry blinked a few times. Then he inhaled, exhaled. That was a lot of information to process. The customer had a name. Sally. And Draco was supposed to be his boyfriend. Well, shit.
“Wait”, Hermione intercepted, “before it’s your turn, Malfoy, I feel like I should reveal how the potion works”. Encouraged by the anticipating looks she got, she continued:”I think it works like that: The surer you are that your feelings are reciprocated, the faster you will kiss the person. Ron, for example, was sure I have feelings for him, too. Luna, however, wasn’t.” “That makes sense, Granger”, Blaise said and Hermione couldn’t help but feel elated and, frankly, excited to see how sure Malfoy was about his crush’s feelings...
“But it’s not fresh”, Draco now made a face resembling a pout and it made Harry want to kiss him right then and there.
“I don’t even know how this could happen, I could’ve sworn it was supposed to be at five, not four… Anyways! Better hurry”
He searched for a thing outside he could focus on for it sometimes helped him to gather his thoughts. "Like to stare, Potter?". Surprised, Harry jolted his head to his left and saw Malfoy, wearing a light blue sweater that looked awfully comfortable and holding a pack of cigarettes. "You've gotten even quieter than you were at school", Malfoy noted while ensconcing himself on the other chair as if it was completely natural. His voice sounded neutral but Harry couldn't help but notice the hint of concern he could hear in it, too.
He snapped back into reality when he heard someone say:”Draco, who do you pick?”. “Let’s think… how about Luna?”, Malfoy replied, seeming to have regathered his equanimity. Luna smiled sweetly at him, awaiting her new found friend’s response. When Luna had been incarcerated at Malfoy Manor, an unexpected bond had formed between the two, for Draco had snuck down each night to talk to her. Their friendship warmed the hearts of many Eight years, being moved at how open the two were with each other. “I dare you to tell us which teacher you find most attractive or to kiss the person you desire”, Draco finished, getting a beam from Luna in response.
- was not less cheugy than of those they had visited before, but something about it felt homey and welcoming to the twenty-somethings that was their friend group. Harry was glad to be surrounded by cheerful people at least one night a week. Not even Ron had been able to cheer him up or distract him at work. He’d been so set on becoming an Auror after school, mainly because helping other people was all Harry knew how to do and what he was sure he excelled at, but the abundance of mundane paperwork and the platitudes coming from his superiors made him doubt that decision not too seldomly.
"I got kicked out of my old apartment and really need a place to live, Potter. If that's not okay with you...I would understand, given our history.. I would even encourage you to kick me out, if I'm being honest." Harry was taken aback by this sudden sincerity and show of vulnerability from Malfoy, slowly understanding that he must be really desperate if he could deign to accept an apartment with two muggles and his ex-nemesis. Although, Harry had to concede, nemesis really was a little of an overstatement. "You are aware of the fact that I live here, too, right?", Harry asked sarcastically. "Of course", Malfoy answered, sounding all solemn. That's it, Harry thought, If he's okay with it, I can be too.
Few people actually visited the shop at said hours, and if someone showed up it was mostly middle-aged lonesome men renting bad action or horror movies. Now that Harry and Ginny’s breakup was almost two years ago and the few dates he had gone on were something he’d rather forget about, Harry often felt sympathy for these men and occasionally the fear of ending up like them crept in, intruding on his comfort at work.
“Wait, let me finish. That you don’t know if you want the job is something you need to figure out on your own. But you have to start believing that you deserve good things. You deserve everything you want. And I’m not just saying that because I am very tipsy, I’m saying it because I mean it. And probably because your cologne is very intoxicating”
"Lovely. Asteria is a vegan, too. She took her stuff with her 'cause they don't have that stuff where her parents live. She'll be back today, by the way". "Funny, the girl my father tried to set me up is called Astoria", Malfoy mentioned, as if it was bloody normal that they were making small talk at the kitchen table. Harry ate his croissant as quickly as he could and explained that he's "very busy today, goodbye", before hurrying to the door and putting on some shoes that he wasn't even sure were his before storming out of the apartment and apparating straight to Ron and Hermione's.
“Alright, who’s in then?”, Pansy asked, already ensconcing herself in an armchair, wrapping her arms around a pillow positioned in front of her stomach. A few approving nods and murmured “yes”s followed and soon all of them were sitting in a round, some on the floor, some on chairs and sofas. Well, all except Harry.
Harry took his time on his way back, stopping at the most unnecessary corners, somehow frightened to go back to the apartment. His apartment, he reminded himself. Well, not his, but more his than Malfoy's. His only highlight of the day would be to see Asteria again. She was such a ray of sunshine and sheer positivity, she would be able to make him smile again, he hoped. Walking with faked valliance, he searched for his keys in the backpocket of his jeans. He let himself in, readying himself to see Malfoy in the kitchen. When he saw that he wasn't, he let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. "Harry, mate!", a beaming Francis said, "I'm picking up Asteria at the central station. Care to join me?" "No, I'll probably lie down for a while".
“Well, never say never, Potter”, Draco smirked. “What do you think about my outfit choice? It’s quite lovely, isn’t it?”, he continued, obviously enjoying Harry’s startlement.
Harry looked at him, and in the second moment of bravery of the evening, he leaned in closer. And just as he was about to close his eyes Ron shouted: “Harry, Draco! Seamus just proposed!”. And just like that, the moment was over.
. Judging by his hysterical coughing induced by either Harry or white wine down the wrong tube (or both), Malfoy was as shocked to see Harry as he felt seeing the blonde all relaxed and unperturbed in his kitchen. Malfoy had never been relaxed. In their time spent at Hogwarts, Malfoy had always looked fucking frantic, at least in their last three years.
Harry was thrilled to finally smell that malodorous odor associated with familiarity once again, to be forced to squint his eyes every other minute to see something in the poor lighting, to be squished between two hovering, inebriated people anew. Or, well, maybe he was just glad to see his friends again.
"By the way, Malfoy's queer", Harry mentioned, his mouth full with white bread. "Excuse me, what?!", Ron exclaimed, staring frantically at his friend. "Honestly, boys, it's always been quite obvious, hasn't it?",Hermione smirked, stirring an undefinable mixture in the pan. "What? No!", her boyfriend replied. "You think so, 'Mione?", Harry asked curiously, concerned about the fact that he hadn't noticed or even suspected it. "Well, aside from the stereotypical things such as his infatuation with grooming, especially his hair.. oh, and his nails, now that I think about it, that certain posture, that walk.. He really couldn't take his eyes off of Zabini for a while... and off of you, mind. And-" "Hermione! Are you mental? Are you suggesting Malfoy had a thing for... Harry?", Ron interrupted hysterically. Harry suddenly felt sick. Malfoy's statement from yesterday was playing inside his head over and over again.
“I hope you don’t mind, Hannah”. Harry got up, beaming at Hannah. When ensconced in her lap, he helplessly shifted around a few times, not knowing whether he was making her uncomfortable. He could feel her breathing down his neck, making him even more squirky, leaving him to wish the three rounds were over already when he met Malfoy’s gaze lingering on him. The stare held such intensity. The ones before were inscrutable, hard for Harry to figure out but this one was different. He could almost
"You don't need saving, Malfoy. I do believe that one day people will accept that you've changed or at least that you're trying really hard."
The only thing reassuring Draco was that Potter wasn’t displaying a cocky attitude. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Potter seemed to be sweating an awful lot, his cheeks flushed and his lips slightly parted. Which, frankly, did not help Draco’s situation. Fuck, Potter looked like he had just been thoroughly snogged.
once”, Ron asked, but Blaise just shrugged. “Luna, pick the next one and we’ll just wait”, Blaise suggested. “Okay. I pick you, Zabini”, Luna said while smiling, still wearing that dreamy look on her face, “You either perform a strip tease or you try the potion, too”. Without a second to spare, Blaise immediately poured himself a shot, expecting it not to work on him either. He, too, drowned the shot and tried to sit down again, when he said “Fuck, my legs are forcing me to stand”, he groaned.
“Ugh, you never tire from drinking that, do you?”, Hermione protested, demonstratively sipping from her glass of white wine. Ron grinned and turned to face her and they smiled at each other in such awe it made Harry want to leave the table as soon as possible. Not that he wasn’t happy for them, he was. It just reminded him that he didn’t have anyone to smile at like that.
Fortunately, Pansy excelled at coming up with things and fibs respectively in quite the extemporaneous manner, proving it once again by offering: “Although you have woken my interest in who this mysterious person is, you do not have to worry. We’re playing a ‘choice kinda game’. Each player gets two choices: Either they perform a dare or kiss the person they desire most. But: No dramatically unrealistic dares just to get the player to kiss the person they wanna shag the most.”
But now, after two Butterbeers and one Firewhiskey, he could finally loosen up a little and felt a great relief at being able to actually follow the conversations again instead of drifting off after a second. Seamus, who was on his left, was carried away with Dean and Ron, passionately discussing the latest Quidditch results. Their conversation had started in a moderate volume but now made it hard to focus on anything other than their what seemed like well-practised debate statements. Harry smiled to himself and turned to his left, where Luna was talking to Ginny and Neville about something Harry could not quite make out yet, when his name was called.
“You’re such a mysterium. Everyone has been telling you how bloody amazing you are for decades, yet here you are, all self-effacing”
“I would like that. My shift starts at 9”, he replied. After a small pause he added: “I didn’t know you were one to be scattered”
Slowly, he parted his lips, not daring to open his eyes, now or ever- staying here in this very moment forever sounded just fine. Hoping that his parting of lips would be interpreted as consent, he moved his head slightly forward, when soft, hot lips met his and everything seemed to explode. Harry hungrily met the pair of lips and brought his right hand to Draco’s hair, seemingly burying it in the soft, blonde hair that he had resented for so long. He wanted to open his mouth even more, give away his all but he pulled back for a second.
An amount of rain considered ridiculous even for this part of the world was pouring down from the sky, clouds with angry faces swayed lethargically across the grey surface. It all felt like a normal hungover Saturday: the food tasted placidly and each bite felt exhausting. The air in his bedroom smelled sour, the pounding in his ears increased as soon as he got up. The air coming from outside, however, was crisp, fresh and comforting, as if the stinging cold couldn’t get to him under his bedsheets. It was an unpleasant feeling, but he was used to it and acquiesced to the exchange alcohol offered time and time again: lightness for nausea.
?”, the voice belonging to Draco enunciated pointedly. This was a show. Still, Harry blushed. “Um- I. No, don’t worry, he was just about to leave”. The man turned around, looked at Draco, turned to Harry, raised an eyebrow and left. Unfortunately with the movie in hand. But that was a problem for future Harry.
The next morning Harry woke up earlier than usual and made his way to the kitchen for a much needed dose of caffeine. It was empty, possibly due to the early hour and Harry decided to sit down at the kitchen counter on a high-stool and went through one of the many crosswords Asteria left lying around. He really didn't know what he had expected when he heard the room to Draco's door being opened but he really didn't think the blonde would approach the kitchen aisle, grab a cup of coffee and vanish back to his room without even looking at Harry.
He’d been at the Ministry non-stop for the past four weeks and balanced between paperwork, theoretical and practical lessons and studying for the upcoming exams and the new found bar in central London was something to look forward to. The name of the bar-
“I, for one, happen to know in what predicament Draco here finds himself and therefore agree with you, Lovegood”, Parkinson declared, looking awfully smug. Hermione looked at Malfoy. He looked calm, but when Hermione looked closer he saw that his hands were shaking. He looked like he was about to pass out. “Fine, I’ll close my eyes”, she said reluctantly, “if you all promise to do the same”. She eyed her fellow classmates and received a few nods. “The hell, ‘Mione?”, Ron muttered, scrutinizing his girlfriend. “Just do it”, she whispered back, closing her eyes and praying everyone would keep their eyes shut. Soon, the group followed, leaving only Harry and Malfoy. Quickly, Harry closed his eyes as well.
He did manage to get out a sound akin to “hello”. In front of him were Pansy, Theodore and Draco, all dressed casually and holding a variety of typical Muggle cinema-snacks. Draco, who was carrying a large bowl of popcorn in one hand and a bottle of coke in his other, was dressed in a button-up and sweatpants.
He looked around and found Pansy and Hermione looking at him expectantly. The two of them seemed to be in a conversation with Draco and Theodore, who were sitting across from Harry. It had turned into something Harry considered normal now, sharing a table with Slytherins on a Saturday evening. They had left their history behind them and after an Eighth Year filled with reconciliation and, frankly, a great deal of drinking together, it came natural to Harry to talk to Pansy, who Harry found charming in a weird way and Theodore, who was actually quite insightful and knew more about Muggle culture than he cared to admit. Just talking to Draco was something that didn’t come as natural to Harry than he sometimes wished it would.
“Or this time, we spice it up a little” , Blaise suggested, eyes sparkling with a hint of joy while revealing a little phial that he’d been carrying all night. Pansy, who had protested that after playing Truth or Dare once a week for months now it had gotten a bit boring, thank you very much, smiled approvingly. She did not want to see the Weasel make out with Granger for the umpteenth time, nor did she fancy having to watch another strip tease from anyone playing.
Confused, he made his way to Grimmauld Place, saddened by the loneliness that was settled inside his heart. The sun was shining so brightly that it made it hard to focus on the road with its various red lights and Harry could not even be happy about the rays of sunshine he was getting, something very rare in London. He decided to watch a movie when he got out of the shower and decided to go with the most dystopian movie he had at hand:
Francis was visibly confused by watching the two of them, underlining it by asking "You guys totally hooked up once, right? Is that why you're so... stunned? Harry?". Hooked up?
But as fulfilling as it was to see Ron in his element, Harry still couldn’t help but think about Tuesday night for hours every day. He’d been so sure they were both so happy something finally happened between them, and still Draco had left. Almost as if Harry was someone he just casually, occasionally saw. Well, maybe he was.
Everyone was still faintly surprised at the sight of Blaise and Neville when Luna jerked to her right, pulling Ginny into a kiss. “No way”, Ron whispered, grinning from ear to ear. Harry watched as his ex-girlfriend smiled at Luna kissing her once again. The two of them smiled radiantly and sat upright again, now sitting a little closer to each other than before.
Harry was sweating an awful lot, heart beating loudly. His ears were filled with white noise when he realized Draco must be already kissing somebody else. He was sure too much time had already passed when suddenly, he detected a movement in front of him. Time seemed to freeze, suddenly it was only him and his heartbeat, his racing pulse, his pumping blood and the wave of anticipation hitting him at once. Harry breathed in, out, his adams apple bobbing when, finally, oh finally he detected a shaky breath on his lips, a sweaty palm clenching at his shirt.
The ceiling was covered in shadows from the tree on the street and Harry was lying completely still, trying to detect any kinds of movement or sound from the room next to his. Draco's room, he reminded himself. The conversation from the night was playing and replaying in Harry's head and he was searching for any signs, any words or any syllables that were not spoken but had hung in the air that Draco might feel the same thing he did. Hermione had once said that it surprised her that nothing ever happened between the two of them back in Hogwarts, remarking that the sexual tension between the boys had always been discernible and utterly present. Harry had only made a dismissive hand gesture, declaring her idea ridiculous. But now it seemed as if she had been the only cognizant, attentive person because suddenly it all made sense. Harry saw how there were certain features about Draco, small details, really, that did not seem new to him. He'd studied those pale blue eyes that were almost grey at certain times, hair that shimmered in the right light, bone structure that seemed so perfectly appealing in the right angle; observed his manners in a careful way and it was almost as if now he was finally letting himself see them without the haze of oblivion lingering over them.
Harry was surprised and wondered what conversation might have lead them to Hermione sharing this and just wanted to reply when Theodore intercepted his thoughts by saying “Pansy, Draco and I have been really into Muggle produced movies lately so it’s really chill that we now know someone who works at a videothek”. Harry, not knowing what an appropriate answer to that piece of information could be, only replied with a “Oh.Yeah- totally”. He never intended for people to find out about his job, mainly because it seemed insignificant since he only worked there for a couple of hours a week but also because he had not expected for people like Pansy and
"HARRYYY", Asteria squealed happily, kissing Harry on his cheek. "Asteria! How'd it go?", he asked, embracing her tightly for a second. "Surprisingly well, actually. Francis tells me we have a new flatmate who has a crush on you?" Harry was about to explain that, no, Draco Malfoy most definitely did not have a crush on him, thank you very much, when there was an awkward cough coming from the sofa. "That'd be me"
Harry had been all alone that evening. He'd bought take-away at his favorite Indian place downtown and had listened to some of the Muggle bands Francis had on vinyl, still in awe of their unique sound, glad to have something other than the musicians the Dursley's had listened to all these years ago. He was glad he'd finally managed to find solace in spending time alone, not minding his own company as much as he used to. Surprisingly, he had gone to bed at around eleven and even managed to fall asleep. Well, until someone (Francis) had burst into the kitchen.
? Of who though? Neville or Malfoy? Neville immediately stopped, quickly settling down on the pile of pillows he had been sitting on, the feeling of relief written all over his face.
While Ron tried to make sense of Harry’s behaviour tonight, now also remembering his initiative reluctance, Neville scooched closer to the Slytherin in question, looking so uncomfortable that it hurt to watch. “Relax, Longbottom”, Draco supplied, noticing Neville’s change of breath.
Harry was about to come up with a witty response when Draco continued:"You're right, 11 year old me would have declared this scenario his ultimate nightmare. However, the Draco that managed to think for himself when the war began would be kind of pleased with the outcome"
"I'd always hoped that one day you'd do, but if I'm being honest I've never thought you'd change... that much"
Draco smiled, yet it was a different kind of smile. The carefreeness had vanished, the poise evaporated. This one reminded Harry of one of his own smiles, a tired one, one that was so desperately trying to convince people of the okayness of it all.
"So, Harry, Draco tells me you went to school together. He also mentioned that you weren't particularly fond of each other". "We fought all the time, yeah", Harry replied. "'Bout what? Girls?",Francis joked, hoping to elicit a small smile out of Harry. "What's so funny?", Harry asked, confused again. He had told Asteria and Francis that after his fling with Ginny, he wanted to take a break from dating for at least a few months, adding with a blush creeping up his cheeks that he "wouldn't mind dating a bloke after the break, either". "Oh shoot, I thought I had mentioned it yesterday. But Draco and I met at a gay bar".
It was like their bodies moved in unison, as if they didn’t need to communicate through words any longer. With a shift Harry sat down on the couch with his back now aligned with the couch back and Draco was in his lap, still kissing him fiercely. Harry let his hands run all over Draco’s body, first his neck and his back, the back of his thighs, which he began to stroke rhythmically. “Fuck, Harry, please”, Draco let out, breaking their kiss.
"I'll have you know that we're not sharing blankets, Ron!", answered Harry defiantly, realizing that We both have our own blanket wouldn't make it any better.
"What? The kiss? Yeah. But only to see if you would actually move along with it". The blonde's voice was infuriated now and Harry felt his heart ache, literally. So it had all been a game from Draco's part, after all. He couldn't believe he'd been stupid enough to fall for it.
Draco had already opened the balcony door and was now stepping outside. There was always such a casualness in the former Slytherin's actions, a way of taking things for granted. Like there was no conceivable other option than Harry following outside. And Harry did. Draco was already sitting in his chair from yesterday and eyed Harry with interest. Harry, too, sat down, already regretting it. The shivers from before were present again and he feared any attempt at conversation would end in incoherent mumbling from his part.
Even though Harry had rushed to get to the pub on time this Saturday, he arrived when the whole table was already invested in a highly inebriated round of Never Have I Ever, or so it seemed. There were several emptied shot glasses all over the table and Seamus was laughing so hard Harry feared he might pass out. “Oi, Harry! Come sit down! Hope you’ve got a few good questions ready, we’re running out of ‘em”, Dean half-shouted, clearly as drunk as his still laughing boyfriend. Again, Harry was seated next to Seamus and the wall, and again, Draco was sitting across from Dean, so enough space for him to breathe normally. Or so he thought. “I’ve got a good one! Never have I ever fancied someone who is in a relationship. Or was, at that point”, Luna said all excited. Several people drank. Harry didn’t. Draco did. Interesting.
"Harry, it's me! How are things at home? You didn't call, so I figured you were either kidnapped and strangled or sharing a blanket with Draco Malfoy, counting stars", his best friend's voice echoed through the line.
Sunday morning, Harry thought about their conversation 80% of the time. Lunch, it had increased to 85%, at dinner he didn’t even remember what it was like not to think about Draco Malfoy. It was night when a more urgent matter pressed him: Tomorrow he would have to take over the department. He still hadn’t told Ron and he still had no idea how to go on about the matter.
Asteria had noticed Harry's fixated look on Draco's room and because he really couldn't be bothered to come up with a reason for his fixation, he excused himself and went back to his room. I can face Voldemort, I might as well face Draco Malfoy, he thought and pushed the queasy feeling aside and with all the feigned determination he could muster, he opened the door to the balcony and approached Draco's door.
, mate? Why didn't you just say no?". Ron's face was full of worry and bewilderment. "What if he hexes you in your sleep?", he added. "Ron, darling. That's not very helpful. Harry, you described that Malfoy seems very changed, right? Maybe he deserves a second chance and I'm glad that you're at least somewhat willing to grant it to him. However, this might be counterproductive.", Hermione suggested in her caring way that Harry would not like to miss, ever.
The blonde's finger found Harry's lip, softly caressing it. Their eyes met with an intensity that made him shiver when he saw it. The thumb on his lip was soft and warm and Harry opened his mouth a little, excruciatingly slow. Draco's eyes were now fixated on his mouth. He could feel the distance of their faces decreasing and his pulse increasing, heart pounding in his ears.
Draco’s acquiescence made Harry’s heart beat faster. And after twenty long minutes, Draco was standing at his door asking: “Just as a matter of interest, did you correct her?”. Hary just grinned and apparated them straight to Sarah’s doorstep.
Harry truly was rendered speechless now. Draco seemed to be on the verge of crying and the look in his eyes was so genuine that Harry wanted to scream. He didn't understand what Draco was saying and frustration was boiling inside his body.
When Francis and Harry left Harry's room, they found the kitchen-living room area empty and the duvet was neatly folded on the sofa, almost like no-one had slept there. Francis was about to come up with some theories about the whereabouts of their new flatmate, when the front door was opened and Malfoy entered the flat, carrying a ridiculously large bag with "Baked Goods" imprinted on it.
They sat like that for what seemed like hours and the soap-opera (Francis' guilty pleasure) was actually quite amusing. "I must admit, it really isn't that bad", Harry said after a while. "All the derision from your part has been pointless then,eh? You officially are a fan of Champagne and Roses?", Francis laughed and Harry couldn't help but laugh, too, when he heard the infamous sound of Draco Malfoy's door knob being turned and his laughter died in his throat but Francis kept shaking with laughter. The look that Draco shot them then was officially worse than any he'd shot Harry's way before and given their history, that was fucking bad.
Harry was hurrying to get to the videothek, still in his robes from the Ministry. He hadn’t got the slightest idea how to explain his very wizard-y outfit to a Muggle (Sarah), but right now, he didn’t care.
“I pick Harry, then”. The boy in question jerked his head up, blinking rapidly. Clearly surprised, he cleared his throat and sat upright.
"Is that a  problem? Are you scared he will force you out of that ridiculous abstinence thing?", Francis smiled. "What? No! Francis, I don't think you understand. I once literally slit his whole torso open during one of our fights." "But not intentionally, right? Did a spell or something go wrong?", Francis enquired, still not fully grasping the intricacies of this whole magic thing that Harry had explained to him over a cup of tea two months ago (a lot of tea was spilled and choked on during Harry's explanation). "I didn't know what the spell would do but I definitely intended to hurt him, Francis. He's the last person to lure me out of my abstinence"
Harry’s face suddenly got very warm. “Sorry, I always thought that this abbreviation sounds cute. Pansy uses it sometimes”
“I don’t like to share, normally”, Draco replied vaguely. And if this confession of possessiveness wasn’t the hottest thing Harry had heard all year, he didn’t know what was.
The next few days Harry felt as if he was living in a parallel universe where smoking and eating chocolate with Draco Malfoy was the most normal routine anyone could find themselves in. He spent his mornings laying on the couch reading or helping Francis with his studies-Harry made an excellent studying partner as it turned out, Hermione had always had too high standards-when an elated Draco Malfoy entered the flat, either after a walk or a run for errands, sometimes glancing over at Harry and Francis, his smile fading. Harry had accepted that the conundrum that was Draco Malfoy simply did not want to be solved, so he didn't pay these shifts of emotion any attention. In the afternoons Draco was always out, yet Harry didn't ask where he was going. Francis was off to uni or meeting up with his infamous study group, but Asteria normally revealed herself at around 2 pm. She always stayed up until late in the night. Her rhythm was very different but Harry found it awfully convenient for he always had someone to chat with and the range of topics that were covered with two individuals as different as Francis and Asteria was astounding. The evenings felt like well-rehearsed déjà-vus and if someone were to tell Harry that all of it had been a dream, he'd believe them. The only evidence was the slowly accumulating ashtray and the decreasing amount of chocolate pralines. Their conversations had been a little stiff but were now slowly but surely evolving into something natural, something comfortable. They talked about everything that came to mind, Quidditch, their former classmates, their plans for the future, carefully tiptoeing around the topic that felt imminent: the war. One evening, Asteria had convinced Harry that eyeliner would look "super hot" on him and Harry let her go along with it. "Don't squint your eyes! You'll ruin my art!", Asteria laughed as she applied the eyeliner on Harry's right eyelid. The liquid felt cold but oddly exciting at the same time. But right after Harry closed his eyes again to let Asteria apply the eyeliner on his left eyelid, he heard the door to Draco's door being opened. It was almost as if Harry could feel Draco's stare on him as he heard the latter's steps on the floor coming closer. Harry, he was sure, must have looked like a complete idiot, still Draco just raised an eyebrow at him when Harry opened his eyes again and the blonde stalked off towards the kitchen and the teakettle.
Draco’s hand in his face and along the beginning of his neck was soft and warm, softer than Harry had dared to imagine. They simultaneously moved closer and then their lips met, light, soft and heartwarming. Draco backed off a little to search for further consent in Harry’s eyes, Harry did his best to to his eyes transport the want, the
They sat in silence for a few minutes in which Harry shifted stiffly in his chair, rearranging his blanket every few seconds. "Do you smoke?", Malfoy asked, opening a pack he had been carrying in the pocket of his hoodie and offering one to Harry. Harry nodded, taking a cigarette in his hand and bringing it to his lips. "Wouldn't have expected that. But then again, you did kill Voldemort. Why should you care about the killing side effects of a cigarette?", Malfoy said in a soft voice, smiling again. Fuck, since when was Malfoy's smile so appealing? Harry couldn't help but (half) smile back. Malfoy, too, had put his cigarette between his lips. He held the lighter in his one hand and used the other as protection from the wind, drawing together his eyebrows in a manner that was just so attractive it was unfair. Harry was sure that if he tried to make a face like that, he'd simply look constipated. Malfoy took his first draw from the cigarette and let it evaporate in the night air.
Harry decided that he was in desperate need for a cup of tea and poured water in the water boiler, patiently waiting for it to start cooking. He rummaged in their tea box situated on one of the marble shelves on the wall. He decided to go with chamomile, a calming and soothing tea for body and mind as Luna always told him. There was a clicking of a door in a lock coming from.. oh, perfect. "Are you making tea, Potter?", Malfoy asked as if the next reasonable step after announcing your support of the villain of the decade was to ask someone whether they were making tea. "Such a good observer", Harry muttered sarcastically. "Would you mind if I used some of that water?". Malfoy was slowly approaching the kitchen, as if he'd burn himself if he did without asking for permission first. "Whatever, Malfoy", answered Harry, joined by the feeling in the pit of his stomach once again. Harry took out a mug and just before he wanted to close the cup-shelf, he took out another, carefully sliding it over to where his new flatmate was standing. After putting the teabag in his mug, he poured the now boiling water into it. Just before he could flee the room, Malfoy let out an exasperated sound. "Potter, you can't just pour the water into the cup. I'm sorry, but you just can't". His tone wasn't mean or anything, still it made Harry want to punch him. "Well, believe me or not, but I just did".
Harry was thrilled to hear his name in this inherently new context, in a plea, a demand, a need he was happy to fulfill. And just as he moved his hand towards the Blonde’s belt, the doorbell chimed.
to be interested in Muggle movies. “We should visit you there sometime! You could give us some recommendations'', Pansy beamed, still wearing that same look of expectation in her eyes. Harry looked at her and then to Theodore and Draco next to her, who both smiled politely.
Next thing he knew, he was sitting in Ron and Hermione’s kitchen, a cup of coffee in hand. “I can’t believe you’re late to your own intervention”, Hermione was saying. She was sitting across from him, her dark green blouse reminding him of someone he wasn’t supposed to think about right now. “It’s not my own intervention, it’s an intervention about me”, Harry muttered as he rested his head in his hands and proceeded to massage his temples.
Draco stared at him, seemingly shocked from what had just transpired and he stormed off. Harry was alone on the balcony again, the door to Draco's room firmly shut and it was just as if none of it had ever happened, yet the aching in Harry's heart was too strong to convince him it had all been a dream.
The following days were hell. Added to his feeling of confusion was now the feeling of betrayal, and worse, the feeling of being played. Had it all been a challenge to Malfoy, a game? Had he only wanted to prove that he could get Harry to fall for him only to leave him dumbfounded and hurt? "You look like a lost puppy, mate. Cheer up! What happened to you anyways?", Francis asked on the third day as he made his way into his flatmate's room only to find he hadn't left the bed yet. Francis opened the curtains to let in some natural light. "I've a headache", Harry mumbled into his pillow. "You should go out, get some air", Francis suggested and sat down at the edge of Harry's mattress. Harry shook his head vehemently. "Imma call Hermione, see if she can help. You're acting weird, mate". Francis made it sound like a warning, as if Hermione was some authority figure he should fear. "No, she's busy with work", Harry protested weakly but couldn't even be bothered to lift his head from the pillow. It was true, his story about the headache. It was pounding and utterly abominable, yet he barely noticed it underneath all the questions swirling around in his head.
But this night had been slightly different. Francis reminded Asteria and Harry that he, in fact, had a life aside from their flat-share-friendship. He was studying Law in his third semester, occasionally even attending a lecture instead of lighting a joint at a time most people would not consider appropriate. Francis had recently joined a study group - but rather because he was extremely infatuated with one of his fellow students who, incidentally was part of the group as well, than intending to suddenly gather his mind around studying ("Harry, I can recite all of what my professor's said for the past three months, I don't
God, Harry was going to die tonight. He couldn’t take it any longer and while he contemplated which excuse he could possibly use to go to bed earlier, he heard Malfoy’s name called again. “I dare you to tell us who your first crush was or to kiss the person you desire”, Harry heard Parkinson say. More color was rising to his cheeks, making him question how that was even possible when he already looked like a bloody love-sick
Harry was perplexed. He couldn’t process this right now, not with Draco leaning in their alcove the way he did, not with him as close to him as he was.
Monday passed slowly as well, the only thing to look forward to being his shift at the videothek the following day. “Harry, mate, Willinger wants us to join Douglas and Marrow on their mission tonight, you know, the case with the vanishing flowers all across this Muggle town”, Ron announced while they made their way back to their small office space after lunch break. “Remind me again why he needs four people on that case? It’s just flowers!”,Harry protested half-heartedly, knowing full well that Ron didn’t want to go, either. “Something about ´Dark spirits destroying peace and serenity´- I really had to try my best not to laugh when Willinger told me this bullshit”, Ron laughed.
Instantly, everyone was dead silent, watching his every motion. “They are starting to tingle!”, Blaise exclaimed, looking slightly scared. “Just give in, Blaise. Give us the show we deserve”, Draco snickered, being extremely amused by his normally so composed friend acting in such a weird fashion. “Well, this is going to be awkward”, Blaise mumbled, walking towards Luna, Ginny, Neville and Hannah. Full of suspense, the group watched as Blaise sat down… in front of Neville. Neville opened his mouth slightly in surprise, leaning forward as Blaise did the same. Soon, their lips met and the kiss they shared evolved into a hungry make-out session, evoking a few shocked expressions from their fellow classmates. “The hell..”, Blaise gasped when they parted, “this thing really works. Longbottom, care to accompany me to my seat? There’s plenty of room for you.”
“It was fine, really. The primary source was this really interesting book about Muggle- Wizard/Witches relations, I can lend it to you if you like… or not, I don’t know. But, Harry, I’m sorry about earlier.” Seeing Hermione so perturbed about Harry’s feelings produced a small warmth in his chest and they walked back to the table to join their laughing, debating or just really
“Sorry, you probably don’t care. I don’t know why I said that. It’s just.. you see me for me, not for the prodigy everyone else thinks I am. I just thought..”
“I know we’re only 24. But I need something steady in my life. I’m tired of playing games, of being unsure of someone else’s feelings all the fucking time. Everyone seems to have their life together. Seamus and Dean are already engaged, Hermione and Ron are living together and everyone else at least has a job their content with. I need a constant in my life. And..”
He had seen that smile on Theodore’s face many times, but it was something only seen on rare occasions on the Blonde’s lips. That, and the many Firewhiskeys Harry had intus, made him say: “Sure, that would be great” when he knew deep down that he would have found some stupid excuse if it had been only Theodore and Pansy asking.
Seamus, too, seemed interested. He must automatically assume someone meant Dean, Harry mused. So, unsurprisingly, Seamus asked: “Well, then: Never have I ever fancied someone who was in a relationship with someone from the opposite sex of yours”. He was too drunk for proper grammar and was apparently trying to find out if a girl had a thing for Dean. To that, Dean shifted in his seat uncomfortably, but relaxed as soon as he saw that only two people drank: Luna and Draco. Draco. Again? Before he could ponder about what this could mean, Harry was nudged in the side. It was his turn.
They smiled at each other. It was so genuine it made Harry all fuzzy inside. He couldn’t let Draco leave without talking to him about Saturday night. There must be some pretense to have Draco stay with him for just a while-
"Chocolate?",Draco had stored the pralines under his chair and was now opening it to reveal that the exact amount from after their nightly indulgence was in it. Harry selected a dark chocolate one and was about to pop it into his mouth when Draco suggested that they might as well have a smoke, too. It felt strange, almost like they were having some sort of routine. Like a couple, the traitorous voice chimed in once again. Draco was taking a drag from his cigarette, accentuating the veins on his hand. His buttons-up shirt was long enough to veil both of the blonde's forearms, leaving Harry to ponder about whether or not the Dark Mark would still be visible. He must have been staring, because Draco stated: "It's still there, in case you're wondering. Reminding me every day of the ubiquitousness of my evil self". Harry noted a hint of sarcasm in his voice. "I didn't mean to stare". "You're not the first and you most definitely will not be the last, Harry". How Draco pronounced his name was almost as if it was something sacred, something worth to be enunciated fully and at all costs.
(“I think I get it now, you know. The stuff that Willinger was so excited about. Remember the stolen flowers? Shit, I’d get excited about that now as well.”)
... right? Draco thought about the alternative: seeing Potter make out with whoever he desired. And who that was, Draco had no clue. All these years it had been faintly obvious, seeing the raven-haired boy drool over the she-Weasel. But now? Who knew? Whoever it was, Draco decided, he wasn’t going to be a little baby about it, but deep down he still had the tiniest glint of hope that it was-
They were late. Sarah hadn’t given him a time, but judging by the state of the place they were. Music was coming from the living room, chatter and occasional cheering from the kitchen. “Just give your jackets to me, I’ll take them with me. So glad you could make it”, Henry was saying to Harry in the entrance hall. The house was huge and even though Harry’d visited Sarah before, he couldn’t help but feel strangely intimidated by the enormously high ceilings and the chandeliers hanging from them. The air was serene and crisp, not even the alcohol had disturbed the feeling of cleanness in this vestibule. “Wow”, Draco mouthed when Henry had left. “Tell me again why she works at a videothek?”
It was a Friday afternoon and Asteria had just left her room, bedhead and circles around her eyes so dark it worried Harry. "You and Draco get along well", Asteria said. "It's a surprise for me, too". "That's really nice. You know what they say: there's a fine line between love and hate. Of course, I am not insinuating that you're in love but.." Asteria never finished the sentence, still the weight of it felt heavy. "You're a real sentimentalist, you know that?", Harry smiled and scooted closer to her on the sofa they were sitting on, intertwining their feet. They giggled at the touch. Harry adored her, simply because with her he could pretend things were easy. Asteria then launched into a detailed explanation about her dream and what it could possibly mean, losing Harry when the words primary-process-thought and Freudian's reliance on symbolism fell.
The next morning, Harry woke up with a sudden urge to sneeze. When the sneeze didn't come, he blinked a couple of times and searched for his glasses. There was a heavy arm slung around his bare torso and Draco Malfoy's hair was so close to his nose that Harry did not only believe he could tell what ingredients exactly was in the blonde's shampoo, he also found the source of his impending sneeze. When it didn't come again, he allowed himself to fully take in his view and how the sun made Draco's hair look golden.
“What if the person I desire isn’t here? Would it require me to walk all across the castle?”, Padma Patil enquired, looking dazzled at Blaise. “Fancy a teacher, Patil?”, Draco jested, eliciting a snicker out of the group. SInce the beginning of eighth year Draco had managed to become civil with most of his classmates after displaying that he truly felt remorse for his actions, making them laugh occasionally. He had despised them once but now even found solace in knowing that people could see him for the normal boy he was underneath it all.
“I love rewatching movies, it’s so comforting”, Harry said, facing Draco again. “Exactly, thank you! Plus you get to see all the details and the special effects more closely”, Draco responded in a tone Harry had never heard from him before. On their nights out, Harry either pointedly ignored Draco or caught him in moments where he was just sitting in his chair, cigarette in hand with a hauteur Harry was repulsed by. Mostly. Sometimes, though, this arrogance made Draco’s facial features even more flattering. But Harry would never admit that. He liked blokes, sure, but he could never experience anything other than superficial attraction towards the git.
"You expect me to believe that spoiled 11 year old Draco would love to go vegan and eat chocolate with his rival, counting stars?"
At this, Harry recalled last night’s excruciating headache for which he took 2 painkillers and one phial of Sleezy’s Sleep Potion. That probably hadn’t been a good idea. But then he remembered how he had felt last night, overwhelmed by the prospect of running a department, confused because he realized he wouldn’t actually mind being fired, guilty because Ron was so much better at their job and feeling that he should be the one getting this opportunity and, of course, relentlessly present: Draco Malfoy.
“Draco. Draco and Harry. Sounds good”, she laughed. “I’ll see you later!”, and with the same ease that Draco carried she disappeared into the crowd.
“Fine, Pans, I’ll kiss them but only if you all promise to close your eyes when I do.”, Malfoy announced, drawing out a few protests from his housemates. “What the hell, Malfoy? Why should you be allowed to kiss the person with no one watching?”, Ron demanded, looking almost livid. “I agree. It would be a little unfair. If you don’t want to, why not just do the other task?”, Hermione chimed in in support of her boyfriend. “Because, mind you, the other task is equally humiliating for me, Granger”, Malfoy conceded. Harry was shocked to hear him speaking in such honest tones.
Harry woke up in waves, reality hitting him in phases. First, there was a sound. An intermittent dropping of a liquid met with a not-so intermittent banging on a door a few rooms away, followed by footsteps ascending a staircase. Then there was a faint odor meeting his nostrils, slightly moldy and wood-like. He remembered that the repairment charm for the leak in the bathroom adjacent to his bedroom must’ve let up. Well, shit. Lastly, there was someone hovering above him, shaking his shoulder gently.
“Um.. Never have I ever.. had a threesome?” This was basic, verging on boring and he was sure this question had been asked a million times. “No, that’s boring. Ask something else!”, Ginny protested, “I already know who did and who didn’t.”
Harry was on his way from the restroom back to their table when Hermione came walking towards him, a gentle smile on her face. “Harry, darling, I really did not think this through. I didn’t expect them to propose coming to the videothek.. I know that it’s your safe space”, she said, laying one hand on his left shoulder in a comforting manner.
"Thanks for the food, guys. I'll call you if something happens". Harry left the building, still feeling quite nauseated. Hermione had suspected it. Why didn't she tell him? Why was that certain piece of information about Malfoy of such importance to him?
Harry feigned a laugh and said: “Pansy made me do it” and with that, the beautiful smile on the Blonde’s face vanished.
"Draco Malfoy. You are highly intelligent, yet you're lacking common sense and please, never become an Auror. You would make a terrible one", he made a quick break and breathed in slowly, "Francis is straight, Draco. He only talks about me because he's trying to set us up. He would be laughing so hard right now, knowing he achieved the complete opposite. I don't have feelings for him. The only one I have feelings-"
“I’m going out for a smoke, anyone wanna join?”, Draco asked after a while, rummaging in his pockets for a lighter. “Sure thing”, Theodore said, just as Harry opened his mouth in an attempt of bravery. He saw Ginny arching up her eyebrows at Pansy and the latter said: “Theo, you were supposed to help me pick out a dress for my birthday party, you simpleton”. “
“Malfoy”, Neville stated to the surprise of everyone, “either you kiss the person you desire the most or you undo the trousers of whoever the bottle lands on only using your left hand”. A collection of appreciative hums went through the round. “Which bottle?”, Draco asked, scrutinizing the various half-empty and empty bottles scattered across the floor all over the room.
"Let me light yours", he insisted, scooting to Harry and bringing his lighter to Harry's cigarette. Harry crampedly looked down, fearing to meet the blonde's eyes. He could feel the warmth coming from Malfoy's body and caught the faint scent of smoke and... chamomile?  "I have a rule, you see. I'm on a first name basis with any person I've ever had a smoke with", he said, bringing one hand to his oh-so-perfect-hair and smirked. "Fine, whatever...Draco",Harry replied, blushing slightly. He prayed that the darkness would veil it, although he felt as if Draco watched him so intently that he wouldn't have missed it. This was flirting right? Offering someone your first name might not be a common flirting technique but given their history it was. Harry took a puff from his cigarette. The feeling dawned on him that Draco Malfoy would more likely be the reason for a heart attack, not the cigarette. "Hey, I found something in the kitchen", Draco said, revealing a small white box that Harry recognised as Francis' sacred box of pralines. "That's Francis', you know", Harry mentioned, "he'll kill us both if he finds out". "He won't know if we both only eat one. Chocolate and cigarettes is a divine mix", Draco stated matter-of-factly. Harry doubted that Francis would not notice- he really was obsessed with his pralines-yet who could resist chocolate? (and Draco Malfoy, a traitorous voice chimed in the back of Harry's mind).
. Almost choking on his own saliva, Harry quickly went back to studying the floor, pretending to be awfully interested in the wooden ground.
Harry eyed Pansy expectantly and she asked: “How did we not know you worked at a videothek? Hermione just told us”.
"You didn't answer my question earlier", Harry expressed, knowing full well he was headed into dangerous territory, possibly the territory of feelings. "True. You'd make such a lovely auror, with that memory of yours", Draco laughed and Harry knew then that he'd be willing to do anything to hear that rich, mesmerizing laugh again. Quite frankly, he knew he was fucked. Harry eyed him curiously, awaiting his answer. "You see, Harry, if you make wrong choices there will be repercussions, egregious ones, that, mind me, aren't unjustified. I can try as hard as I want and still most people will still think I'm nothing more than Death Eater scum", his eyes were suddenly sharp.
Ten minutes later, the door to the store opened anew, and once again Draco Malfoy entered. This time, though, he was holding a big bag of popcorn. “The gas station was the only store still open, but I found popcorn!”, he said, triumphantly.
They were so caught up in the moment that they didn’t notice how they were slowly but surely moving closer to the frantic, dancing crowd. They also didn’t notice how people looked at them in awe, in admiration. But they did notice when someone bumped into them so that the remnants of Harry’s drink spilled all the part of Draco’s shirt that wasn’t closely aligned with Harry’s own torso. “Shit”, Draco muttered, breaking the kiss. Draco looked a little sour, but after a second, his face lit up just enough for Harry to notice. “I think I need to dry my shirt in the bathroom”. Harry grinned.
Ensconced in one of the chairs of their incongruous set of chairs, holding a glass of white wine in his still so awfully veiny and pale hand and looking as smug as ever was
"I hope he's alright" was the last thing Harry heard Asteria say before he locked the door to his room and started playing some music. He threw himself on his bed, buried his head in his pillow and let out a muffled, frustrated scream. Draco Malfoy would be the end of him.
Since Ron‘s method of waking someone included rushing them out of their house in nothing but sweatpants and a shirt, Harry looked disheveled when he made his way home to quickly get changed before going to The Bullseye. He could’ve apparated, but Hermione’s suggestion of waking sounded reasonable. („If Rita Skeeter’s photographers catch a glimpse of me looking like this, I shall stage my own death”, he had joked). So the last thing he needed was seeing Draco across the street, who spotted him immediately and waved at him. He looked, as always, meticulously groomed, in a tailored suit, hair slicked back in a way Harry hadn’t seen in a while. Draco pointed at the bags he was carrying and mouthed something akin to „in a hurry“, smiled, and rushed past an old woman in front of him. Getting smiles from Draco Malfoy was something he was almost used to now. Still, Harry was embarrassed by being seen like that on the street.
"Potter was much too uptight to ever hook up with me", Malfoy said humorously, devouring every single word. Fucking fantastic, Harry thought. "That's the first thing that comes to mind when you're suddenly in my kitchen? Really, Malfoy?"Harry retorted, feeling simultaneously disconcerted at Malfoy's statement but chose not to pay it any mind (right now at least) and relieved due to the fact that he had managed to form a proper sentence. "You know each other?", Francis enquired, appearing amused and interested all at once. "You can definitely say that."
“You absolute tosser”, Draco smiled and he took another drag from his cigarette. He turned his face slightly, as to not hit Harry with the smoke. The way Draco held the cigarette, with such grace and lightness. The way he inhaled the smoke, how his cheeks momentarily hollowed, and the way they returned to their full beauty as he exhaled. Harry could not help himself, he felt incredibly turned on.
“The one that Sally told me about! She totally caught you. God. She was so embarrassed when she told me! But bring him! I’m kinda mad you didn’t tell me about him! Anyways, see you!”
to study") and therefore, had been out for tonight. Judging by the sounds coming from the kitchen, he had returned and brought company to their 4-room flatshare in the heart of London. A lucky find, as Hermione kept on reminding Harry.
The next few days, Harry spent silently cheering on Ron when he was giving out orders in the mornings with feigned confidence that had evolved into real one in the span of two successful days. It was great to see his friend thrive at something he was so passionate about and Harry admired Ron for having that spark in his eye whenever they were able to close a case, even if it was just a small one.
The group quickly grew bored from this game that they had been playing for months now, so they launched into private conversations again. Harry was talking to Dean and Seamus about their plan of moving in together. Seamus told him about a small flat outside of London, while Dean had his hand on his boyfriend’s thigh. This casual touch made Harry ache a little, but that was okay.
Work in the Auror Department stretched across his days in the old, suffocating way. Ron’s Quidditch jokes remained the same, Willinger’s requests still were unnecessary and absolutely tedious. Harry didn’t know what he had expected when he had followed Ron and many others from Hogwarts into the Ministry, but it certainly didn’t look like this.
"So, what do you do, Potter? If you don't mind me asking", Malfoy asked casually while waiting for the tea to be ready, body leaning against the counter. "I'm taking a sabbatical", Harry answered shortly. "Care to elaborate?", Malfoy half-smiled. Harry found himself flattered by the smile, cursing silently in his mind as he felt heat rush to his cheeks. It was rare to find someone that didn't have that preconceived idea in their head about how the Chosen One had to act. Still, Malfoy would never be that someone to him. "I don't know what to do with my life, if you really want to know. I'm not sure if I really want to become an Auror anymore. I'm done with hunting and fighting for the moment. So I mostly just read and spend time with Francis and Asteria while I'm here and with Ron and Hermione when I'm out", Harry explained, though only because he hoped that if he opened up a little, Malfoy would, too. Malfoy just nodded. "What about you?", Harry asked after several seconds had passed, hoping Malfoy would tell Harry about him without being asked. But Malfoy just grabbed his now ready tea, winked, and went back to his room. He had winked. "What the fuck?", Harry whispered.
“So I take it you haven’t corrected her, then?”, Draco turned to fully face him, his left leg almost touching Harry’s. He was standing so close Harry could feel his breath. “No, I haven’t”, Harry breathed out. “Good”, Draco replied and leaned in to kiss him. With one hand steady around his drink and the other tugging at Draco’s collar, Harry deepened the kiss feverently. For now, in this second, he didn’t care that he still wasn’t sure about Draco’s motives. He would ask him later. Right now, he had more important things to do. Like run his hand through Draco’s soft hair, or let Draco slip his tongue inside his mouth. Much more important.
”, a voice to his right said, and Harry turned to find Draco walking towards the vacant seat. “What’s… that?”, he asked, ogling the drink in front of him and then turning towards Pansy for an explanation. “Oh, Harry insisted on buying you a drink”, Pansy giggled. Now that Harry looked closer, Blaise, Theodore, Ginny and Luna seemed to be holding a laugh in, as well. “I-”, Harry wanted to protest, when Draco looked at him, a genuine smile on his face. “That’s very weird, Potter, but thank you”.
His eyes, oh his eyes, one of the many things about Malfoy Harry simply could not resist, were devouring Harry. Not thinking it possible, their elaborate staring-contest intensified when Harry saw Malfoy lick his lip slowly, indulging into the act. What he would do to taste those lips-
