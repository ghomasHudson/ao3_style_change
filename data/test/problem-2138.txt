“What?” Ron asked. He sounded peevish and Harry assumed this was because he still felt like he was dying.
“But someone must have a list of their members,” Pansy says suddenly. “And if it’s kept in the Ministry, there’s a chance it could have been accidentally sent to the Reliquary.”
Eventually, Draco says, “You’re looking at me like that means something.”
,” he hissed.
“Obviously,” Pansy agreed.
“Right.”
“Yes?”
“No?”
“—Promise me, Harry,” he’d said, a strange intensity in his stare. Faced with that, what was Harry to do?
“-Yes, darling. That is what the gin is for.”
“Yes.”
“How do you-?”
“And killing Dumbledore is a tall order for a sixteen year old?” Hermione asked.
“I didn’t want to cause them undue stress,” Dumbledore said. “They’re so young. I wanted to let them be happy.”
“No,” Draco snapped. “I was just going to, I don’t know, do things.”
“I’m not bloody surprised,” Blaise said. “Circe, Harry, I knew you were pretty powerful, but I had no idea just how much.” Harry worried his bottom lip and scratched the back of his head. These conversations always made him feel awkward, because it wasn’t like he had
“Oops,” Harry muttered.
But he is getting ahead of himself. There will be time enough to discuss this with the others once he has reunited Ron and Hermione.
“Thank you?” Harry was unsure why Snape was helping him, or, in fact, whether Snape was actually trying to make it worse.
Presently they stop in front of a building and Massi ushers them inside. They follow him down into the basement where they are met by a bouncer. Harry can’t hear what Massi says to the man, but they are quickly shown to the back of the club, behind a curtain and into what appears to be a VIP area. It is empty apart from them. Draco grins at Harry and Harry rolls his eyes but smiles back.
“That’s better,” he said. He began tucking in his shirt which he had left loose for the ride back.
“It’s not my place.”
Obviously, Seamus wanted to find Justin. After all, he had invited him to this party. As his date. So he wanted to do date like things with him. Or, at least, he was pretty sure he did.
a day’s worth of lessons, there was a full weekend after that.
“That’s,” Ron spluttered. “That’s not what I meant.”
“I can assure you that it will be,” he said. “And if it’s not, you may address all complaints to Pansy.”
“It might have been Dumbledore’s,” Ron allowed.
“Are you sure?” McLaggen asks.
“You fucking asshole,” Draco says to the unconscious figure of Massi. He stands up again. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Harry look up. “You. Absolute. Fucking. Asshole,” Draco says again, embellishing each word with a kick to Massi’s side. He thinks he feels one of Massi’s ribs break and is overcome with a mix of satisfaction and compunction. He blames the potion for his feelings of guilt.
“I would say undergo veritaserum, but we both know you’re trained to resist that,” Pansy says.
better than Muggles. We can do magic. Is that not better?”
“Oh,” Hermione said. Blaise frowned as he caught a note of sadness in her voice.
“Glasses?”
The next few days passed in a blur of activity. The teachers, undeterred by the upcoming Halloween festivities, assigned as much, if not more, homework than usual. Indeed, when a large groan went up from the students in her class on Tuesday, McGonagall explained that was because their mock N.E.W.T.s were coming up.
“Oh, shut up, Potter,” Malfoy says. “You’re not nearly as attractive as you think you are.” Harry grins.
Almost as though Potter could tell Draco had been thinking about him, he appears in the doorway not five minutes later.
“Alive? Yes.” Harry reaches out with a shaking hand and touches Hermione’s cheek. It is warm to his touch. He moves his hand to her shoulder and gently shakes her. She doesn’t move. Her eyelids don’t even flutter. When he had seen the IV bag, Harry had suspected as much but his heart still sinks.
“You know where we haven’t had a party yet,” Ron said on Thursday night. The six of them were sitting at the Gryffindor table along with Seamus and Justin. Seamus immediately perked up at the word party.
“Fine,” he says. “But what if I turn it into foreplay?”
“No, they can’t,” Blaise agreed.
Once he’s ready, he picks up the cover of the book and puts it back into the box it had arrived in. Then he puts that box into the built in cupboard that is nestled beneath the eaves at the far end of his landing. He tells himself to forget the book. What book? He doesn’t know anything about any book. And he is most definitely
“Not for me,” Emma says. “I don't work Saturdays.” Her face splits into a grin. “Hooray for weekends! See you lot on Monday.” She turns and quickly makes her way to the back of the store, leaving Draco and Greg in an awkward almost circle with Big Dick.
And nothing had made the war feel more pointless than standing in front of the burnt out, boarded up ice cream shop. It was an
“Incarcerous,” Blaise said, tying the Death Eaters, Bellatrix included, together. Then he looked around. He wasn’t quite sure what to do now that they’d captured them. He felt a tug at the wand Hermione had handed him and realized that one of the Death Eaters was attempting to wandlessly summon it back. He tightened his grip on it and scowled at them before shooting another set of ropes at them.
Narcissa and Lucius are engaged in a game of Wizard’s Chess when they enter the drawing room. Draco is surprised. He has not seen them do much aside from drink and sleep since the War. But then, he hasn’t been home in a while.
sorry. No one wants to hear about their date’s exes. Although, you
“Vodka!” Harry tried his best to seem excited. Vodka shots were not his favorite.
“He said he would find a way to break it,” she said softly.
“He was in his eighties, so Muggle doctors think he died of old age.”
“Please let me explain myself.”
“He knows they don’t bite, right?”
“You’re the one who’s made him change his ways.”
“When Harry and Draco get back,” said Pansy. “They’ll have the invisibility cloak.”
“It’s purple,” she said.
“I wouldn’t complain.”
By the time he finished talking, both Hermione and Pansy were crying, Blaise had a hand clapped over his mouth, and Ron had sunk so low down in his seat that he was practically falling out of it.
“I didn’t know you swung that way.”
“I’ll give you sexual favors in return,” Harry said and the corner of Draco’s mouth lifted.
“I told him.” Draco crossed his arms and slumped back into the pillows of the couch, a small frown playing about his features.
“Circe, you’re dense sometimes. I want to fuck you, Ron and I have wanted to for the past few weeks.”
“And then the walk across the grounds,” Ron said. “I would have preferred to not have to go outside.”
“That’s what the drink is called,” Draco explained. “Also, technically, it’s mezcal, not tequila, but I think you’ll like it.” And then, speaking of things that he figured people would like, he decided to make Harry a scofflaw for when he eventually arrived.
“I meant the teachers,” she muttered, even more quietly.
“I wish you would.” Pansy rolled her eyes and Blaise grinned at her.
“Thank you for the wine,” he says. “It’s really quite delicious.” Potter gives him a small, tight smile. Draco decides to move the conversation on. “So now that we’ve settled on wine and transportation, are you going to tell me where we’re going for dinner?” He catches Potter mid-sip of wine and waits for him to swallow the mouthful down.
“Good,” Draco said. “I think we should start with Diagram 42b.” Harry blinked at him.
“What is so funny?” Draco asked.
“Yes,” Harry said. He nodded, more to himself than to Draco, and held out his hand. Draco took it and together they lifted up the Rune and lowered it slowly into the potion. The potion emitted a shower of lime green and neon pink sparks as the Rune sank down into the liquid.
“What can I do for you, Miss Parkinson?” he asks. Pansy puts on a sad face.
“Why not?” Dumbledore asked. “If we get the students to safety beforehand, then Harry is right — we do have the home advantage so to speak.”
“Yes, well, the Malfoys aren’t all terrible.”
“I, uh,” Harry spluttered. “Nothing happened.”
“The wand, the stone and the cloak,” Draco said immediately, playing along in the hopes he would get some answers.
“Are you sure this is wise, Albus?” McGonagall asked from the seat beside him.
“Good, now let’s go get a drink.” He stands. “Greg, d’you want anything?”
“Quite.”
“There are curtains, Weasley,” Draco said.
“I won’t tell anyone,” Ernie said. He reached out and tentatively patted Draco on the arm. “But say, if you could put a good word in for me with Daphne, I would very much appreciate it.”
“You know,” Draco said, leaning back into the couch cushions. “Our friends probably think we’re fucking right now.”
“Why did you say to meet here then?” Cormac looks at her, confused. Pansy shrugs.
Part of him can’t believe it had turned out so well. He’s almost scared he’s going to wake up and find that evening was all a dream and that he has to go through it all again. The fear that he felt when the room went dark has haunted him the past two nights. He had lain awake for what felt like hours, in spite of his exhaustion, and the only thing that had finally lulled him to sleep were Draco’s snores in the bed beside him.
Once Blaise had scrambled upright, he followed her lead and they looked around the tunnel in the thin wand-light. There was what looked like a pile of sticks on one side of the tunnel and Pansy walked over to it, squatting down to look more closely. They were not branches, but rather were broomsticks.
“What? No, it’s nothing like that. We just. Well, we’re just friends.”
“I, uh, just wanted to say hi,” Draco said. He wasn’t entirely sure what he had wanted to say to Harry. He had just wanted to hear his voice.
“It’s been a while,” Seamus says to Draco later in the evening. The game had ended a short while earlier and most people have dispersed into other rooms. Draco has lost track of Harry but is sure he will find him before the evening is out. Harry won’t let him walk the few meters across the street to his own house alone after all.
“Should we be writing this down?” Ron asked. He stood up and walked over to the blackboard and picked up a piece of chalk. Harry nodded at him and he wrote down
“Great, let’s go.” She starts to walk towards the exit, but Potter stops her.
“That’s it,” Seamus said. “I’m never sleeping again.”
do you have all these adventures without me?” Seamus demanded. Harry shrugged and buttered a piece of his dinner roll.
“So you’re the one who’s corrupted my son.”
“We’re what?” he asked.
“No shit, Sherlock,” Potter says.
“Draco,” Pansy says. “Please don’t make this harder than it already is.” She sounds as if she is trying not to cry. Draco hasn’t heard her sound that way since Hogwarts and he immediately feels guilty.
“Well, if we take the Tube, that obviously takes longer than apparating.” Potter is clearly still stuck on the question of transportation.
“I know I’m right,” Ron said. “Emotional intelligence is one of my main strengths.”
“I had no idea,” Draco says. He looks down at his wand in wonder. “Why?”
So much for self control.
The other three wear similar shocked expressions.
The reality of the situation washed over him at that point. Draco was sucking him off in what would normally be full view of everyone. And fuck, was that hot.
“I said, I fucking knew nothing,” Potter growls. Draco can feel the tension literally building in the air, and it is only when the corner of Potter’s napkin starts smoldering, that he realizes it’s not tension, but rather Potter’s magical energy. Draco shivers. He had been unaware that Potter was quite so powerful. Pansy clearly notices, because Draco watches as her face cycles through several emotions: surprise, alarm, irritation and then resignation.
“Pansy?” Narcissa asked, proffering a cracker at Harry. Harry reached out and pulled. The cannon boom of a wizarding cracker sounded again and a bowler hat and a pair of matching scented candles burst out of the cracker. Narcissa picked up the bowler and placed it on her head. “What do you think?” she asked, indicating her hat.
“That’s it? There’s no password? Just a riddle?” She nodded.
“Don’t make me change my mind.”
“Are we really going to fuck on a train?” Draco asks. His hand has lingered on Harry’s cheek, but he lowers it now.
“Goodnight Draco,” but then he falls fully asleep, and when he wakes, it is just a barely remembered dream.
“So what do you want to see?” Harry asks. It is evening and they are standing outside of the Muggle cinema closest to Harry’s old house. Draco is bouncing lightly on the balls of his feet, staring up at the front of the building where the movies are spelled out in large, black letters.
“Not even Greg?” Draco asks.
“Does this mean you're no longer a virgin?” he asked and then quickly added, “I don't actually want the details, just a yes or no will suffice.”
“Aww, how cute.” This was Pansy. “I didn’t think Draco had that in him.” She sounded both sarcastic and pleased in a way that only Pansy Parkinson could.
They have to get through this.
“We haven’t even been back at work a day.”
Hopefully you enjoyed that ;)
“But not
“What is it with you and tunnels, Potter?” Draco asked as they made their way down the passage to the Shrieking Shack on Friday night. They were alone, so Harry had Draco’s hand in his. At that comment, he pulled Draco close and pushed him against the wall of the tunnel.
“The point is, we will ensure that he hires you, Parkinson, and it won’t seem out of character for him,” she says. Pansy nods. “Now, every morning, Malfoy, you will read the Daily Prophet from cover to cover and you will let either Potter or Parkinson know if anything jumps out at you.” Draco nods. He reads the paper most mornings, so this will not seem out of the ordinary for him. “Occasionally we may give you something specific that you need to look at.” Draco feels like he is one of those perpetual motion birds, he is nodding so much. As Granger continues to brief him, he continues to nod. His eyes glaze over and he feels almost as though he is back at Hogwarts, listening to Professor Binns lecture him on the history of magic.
“I’m sorry, I must be drunk,” the irishman said. “Because I thought you just said you were going to
“Something like that,” Draco says, even though it is not. Knowing Hannah, if Joe and Luca asked her if they could attend, she would graciously say yes, but Draco spends enough time with the pair at work that he doesn’t want to see them in his off hours too.
He has grown used to Harry’s presence in their house. He no longer starts in surprise when he wakes up to the sight of tousled black hair on the pillow next to him. But it hasn’t gotten any easier. If anything, it’s gotten harder. He wants more than anything to thread his hands through Harry’s hair and press their faces together in a place that’s not just where the gossip witches can spot them. But he can’t, because that would make it real. And it’s not - no matter how much it feels that way when they are in public.
“Fine. Don’t say I didn’t offer.”
“It’s lovely,” Draco says. “This floor is spectacular.” It is not. The mosaics clearly depict Muggle torture, from people being hung upside down by people with wands aloft, to Muggles who have been torn limb from limb, but haven’t been allowed to die, to Muggles being boiled alive in cauldrons. It is made all the more horrifying by the fact that the mosaic is constantly moving. Draco tries hard not to look at it.
“It’s not
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy lets the subject drop. Instead he turns to Parkinson and asks,
“Ta,” Draco says, sitting down on one of the bar stools. She puts the two pints on the bar and Draco picks one up and takes a large gulp. He had not realized how dry his throat is until the beer hits his mouth and he takes another big sip before putting the beer down again.
“Here,” McLaggen says, pushing a glass of water across the table to Draco. “Drink this.” Draco tamps down any snarky response he might have wanted to say and takes the glass. Still staring at McLaggen, he downs the water in one go. It takes a moment, but then he feels the unmistakable push of the veritaserum at the back of his mind.
“Anytime. Sleep well.” And then he disappears around the turn in the stairs.
“Next is being the soup course. You is having lobster consume with poached lobster, served over a bed of crispy rice,” Wilfie said. Harry watched as the rice appeared first in a shallow bowl topped with a piece of what was presumably lobster. Harry had never had lobster before, so he wasn’t one hundred percent sure what the pinkish white thing on top of the rice was, but he figured it must be that. The bowl then filled from the bottom with a clear broth, which made the rice crackle. He picked up his spoon and began to eat. He quickly decided that he liked lobster.
They chat about Harry and Draco’s Europe trip, excluding any mention of the Battaglia dinner. Ron and Draco bond over the story of Harry learning to ski.
“Ron’s in the other room.”
“Obviously,” she says. “It was when we were all sorted into Gryffindor.”
“Draco, did I not teach you that real men fight above the belt?” Snape asked.
“Home?” Cormac asks. Draco says nothing, only stares at him. “You two live together?”
Once Potter finishes his own toast, he waves his wand to send the plates to the sink. Then he turns to Draco.
“S’ok, ‘Mione. I did this to myself after all.” He gave her a half hearted smile. At this point, he felt something crawl up his leg and he gave a start. He looked down and saw that it was a piece of paper shaped like a crab. He snatched it up before Hermione could see and quickly unfolded it.
“You were bemoaning the fact that the Reliquary was off on a European sojourn.”
“Although, it’s getting kind of late now, don’t you think?”
“Oh darling,” she says. “It’s beautiful.” She immediately wraps it around her neck. Draco beams.
“You could even go to a real classroom,” Blaise said. “I bet it would be very exciting.”
“That would be lovely.”
“So I can still flirt with you?”
The door opened and Draco’s head appeared in the gap. Pansy glared at him, not bothering to hide the fact that all she had on was a bra and trousers. (At least the trousers had been an easy decision).
“Go away,” he says, covering his eyes with his forearm.
“Thank you,” Hermione shouted into Blaise’s ear.
“The last thing I remember is Hannah and Ernie’s Halloween party,” she whispers. “Oh my god. Poor Rose.” And then she starts to cry. Harry holds her and looks around the room. Pansy has clapped a hand to her mouth and Susan looks as if she too is about to cry. Draco gestures towards one of the sofas and Harry nods. He steers Hermione to the seating area and gently lowers her down.
“We don’t have any alcohol,” Hermione said in a hushed tone.
Draco is surprised when he recognizes her as Susan Bones from his year from school. He hasn’t thought about her in years. In fact, he had forgotten she even existed. And of course, now the Reliquary has provided more details on her than he ever thinks he would have needed to know.
“I hate to say it,” Hermione said. “But she has a point.”
“As I said,” she says. She puts her hands on her hips and stares at him. “There have been some developments while you’ve been away.”
“Nothing,” Draco says, shaking his head. “Forget I said it.”
“I accomplished what I set out to do,” Harry replied. He lifted his free hand to touch the now gently bruised spot on Draco's neck. His other hand stayed put on Draco's hip. Draco slapped a hand over the spot.
Draco is still slightly grumpy about the dishes as he lugs his suitcase up the stairs. It’s heavier than it looks and Draco would normally cast a levitating charm on it, but, well, no magic. Draco’s not sure how muggles manage.
“I thought last Friday made it pretty obvious how we both feel,” Ron said.
Because of course they did.
“What? No. Even after a millennium, I still wouldn’t date the Baron, no matter
“Wow,” Harry said. “Thanks.” Draco frowned at Harry. He looked different.
“So that’s the house,” Potter says, turning back towards Draco.
“Okay,” Harry said and turned his focus to undoing Draco’s trousers.
. I have a boyfriend.”
“Yes, he’s ready,” Pansy says. Draco looks at her and she nods, clearly satisfied that the veritaserum is working.
“We are,” Harry assures him. “But I also wanted to show you this.”
“Suit yourself.” Greg makes his way to the back of the mews house, where his room is, while Draco turns and heads upstairs.
“Parkinson,” he says as he draws up to her.
He liked to think that making drinks was a lot like making potions.
“Avada Kadavra,” again. And then everything went black.
He waves his wand around his head and then projects a tiny map onto the palm of his hand. Perfect. If he keeps running down this corridor and then takes a left at the next junction, he will have a chance. He picks up speed again. He risks a glance behind himself and sees that there are two hit wizards pursuing him. He shoots more stunning spells behind himself and pushes on towards the end of the corridor. He feels rather than sees the stunners, jinxes and curses that fly past him. One of the stunners grazes the top of his head and he can smell his hair singe.
“Now,” Harry says, lifting his head up. “We call the police.”
“I wonder if there are any empty classrooms we can use,” Harry said.
“Wow,” Draco said. “The first person who actually knows what they want.”
“What do you mean?”
“You know, Draco,” Blaise said. “You’re not being very subtle. People might start to wonder about you two.” Draco and the cat turned their harsh gazes onto Blaise.
“In which case, why don’t we work together to make sure it doesn’t happen,” he said. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“I guess that’s true,” Pansy said. “But I’ve never met your mother and she’s put so much care into this.” She put a hand up to her mouth and Harry could swear he could see tears in her eyes. “Oh, Ron. I’m quite sure my parents haven’t sent you anything.”
“Two old fashioneds for Master Draco’s friend?” the elf croaks. “Certainly.” He busies himself with bottles and Pansy turns to Draco.
“Should we?”
“To stupid school rivalries,” Malfoy says.
“Of course.”
he was an egotistical maniac, he had, Dumbledore theorized, decided to use precious Hogwarts artifacts in order to do it.
“Does someone need to stay in the Room to make sure it doesn’t change?” Hermione asked. She seemed to have a better understanding of the inner workings of the room.
“I feel like this is going to end poorly. Again.”
“What do sailors have to do with it?” Draco asks. He knows exactly what, but he wants to wind Potter up. Potter just shakes his head and says,
“None taken, Mr. Weasley,” Dumbledore said. “I only wish I could be here to witness this in person. I think you have a very good chance of defeating him.”
“Maybe,” he said after a long moment of contemplation. “Maybe I could go home for just Christmas Day.”
“Closer together,” Gillian instructs. They move towards each other until they are face to face. Before he can stop himself, Draco reaches out an pulls Harry flush against him. He tells himself it’s for the pictures, but he knows it’s more than that. There is a flash as the camera goes off. Draco ignores it.
“Well tough shit, because you are. I slept in your bed last night. It’s only fair you sleep in mine.”
“Well,” Ron said. “It’s hardly a surprise that Snape would have made such a high quality polyjuice.”
“Are you?” Hermione asked, archly. Harry looked up from the pancakes he was piling onto his plate. Hermione was giving Seamus a strange, calculating look that piqued Harry’s curiosity. He filed that information away for later as it would be a conversation best had away from the whole group, particularly Ron.
“Uh, Professor,” he said. “Is the bit of his soul that was in me, gone? If I was a horcrux?”
“She lives with you?” Harry asked. His voice was a bit louder than he had intended, but the pounding in his ears was growing louder.
“What do you need my brothers for?” Ron asked, turning his head to stare at the professor. She flushed pink.
splutters.
“What did we decide about who was in charge?” he asks.
“Wow, Hermione,” he said. “You look amazing.” She beamed at him.
“Good point.”
“Yes, well, touché.” Harry leaned forward and reached into Draco’s lap. He wrapped a hand around Draco’s erection and squeezed it gently.
“You’re no fun,” said Seamus and instead turned his attention to Harry. “Would you be our Dr. Evil, Har?”
And then the doorbell rings and they spring guiltily apart.
This year, the day will be better than that, but not by much. He groans as he thinks about all the Hogwarts mothers who will be descending on the store in only a matter of minutes. He wonders if this will be the year that he will run into an old classmate with their children. He is sure some Hufflepuffs had probably married and had kids right after school.
“Major Parkinson,” Banks says, snapping Pansy out of her reverie. She looks over at him. “She’s ready for you now.” She gives him a small, tight lipped smile as she heads over to Dempsey’s office. Banks is one of the good ones, she thinks.
“Right,” he says after a moment. “Sorry.” Potter looks down at his hands. Draco pours himself a cup of coffee and then looks around the cavernous kitchen for wherever the milk is hiding.
“I mean, there are now six of us who want to learn Occlumency,” Harry said. “We feel it’s going to be important for our plans.”
“Thanks,” Draco says faintly, though he’s sure Potter’s out of earshot. He stares down at the phone, idly thinking how much nicer it is than Potter’s, because thinking about that is easier than thinking about his mother. Or the fact that he has to stay here for two weeks —
“Good luck,” Harry says as they part outside of the bookstore. He leans in and kisses Draco quickly on the cheek. “See you in a bit.” He winks. Harry has his own role to play in their scheme. He is to provide the edible distraction that will keep Big Dick out of the way while the fort is constructed. Draco grins at him as he walks away and then schools his face into the mask of indifference that he wore so often at school, so as not to give anything away to the manager.
“I know,” Blaise agreed. “Now fuck off.” He shooed them along with his hands.
“Charming,” Draco said and hit him with a throw pillow.
“We can’t just use the Room of Requirement for everything,” Pansy said.
“I do not look like that,” Draco protests. He wriggles uncomfortably, wedged in between the two of them.
Or, he is supposed to.
Finally, what seems like hours later, the door to the Cooler opens and Susan steps out.
“What?” Draco asks. They are moving too quickly in this conversation. And he doesn’t want to have to see McLaggen every day. He sees him enough as is. “Well, you can’t go before Christmas.”
Pansy sighs and looks at Wise over steepled fingers. She is tired of his reticence.
“It's not,” Neville said. “But we had an impromptu gathering and I believe other members of my year may being feeling just as worse for wear as I was.” Dobby bowed.
He hears the squeak of a door hinge and he hurriedly wipes water out of his eyes. Malfoy’s face peers around the gap of the open door, and then he pushes it fully open. Harry instinctively grabs a washcloth to cover himself. He stares, bug eyed, as Malfoy walks into the bathroom as naked as the day he was born.
“If that is what you wish to do.”
Professor McGonagall announced Dumbledore’s passing at lunch. She stood in front of his usual chair at the high table and called for silence using a Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes firecracker that burned in the shape of a phoenix. Harry thought it was rather fitting.
They watch as Parkinson scowls at the alleyway. She slowly lowers her wand. Her shoulders slump.
“Careful,” she hisses. “You’ll blow my cover.” He reaches up and pulls her hand away, but does not let go of it. She finds that she’s not sure if she wants to take it away.
of this.”
“Oh,” Helena said, drifting down to stand next to him. “It’s definitely food. Ghosts can at least touch each other to a degree.”
“I know,” Draco snaps. He bats Harry’s hands away. “I’m very good at small talk.”
“Oh, bollocks,” Draco says softly. “I forgot about those. Uh, yes please, Kreacher.”
“To bad decisions,” Seamus countered.
“Fuck.” Harry leaned back and ran a hand through his hair. “How do I know if I can trust you? That you’re not plotting to kill me?” At this Draco lifted his eyes up to meet Harry’s again. He looked incredulous.
“I was going off of the initials sewn into your pajama shirt,” Narcissa replied, pointing at them. Ron flushed. “I was unaware there were any Weasleys in Slytherin house. Draco has never mentioned any of you.”
“I tried not to fall in love with him,” Draco says. This is only partly a lie. He did try not to feel the way that he does, but if he’s honest, he probably could have tried harder.
Massi is waiting for them in the corridor. He is already wearing his coat. He says nothing, only jerks his head in the direction he wants them to go and they follow. Draco swings his coat on as he walks.
“Since Halloween,” Draco says. Pansy’s forehead furrows. She turns to stare at Draco.
“The food,” Hermione said, gesturing at the spread.
“Fine,” he said. “Have it your way.” His exasperation was evident in his tone and a flare of anger went through Harry again. He didn’t have to tell Draco everything that was on his mind, just because they were… whatever it was they were.
“How? We’re still on a communications embargo, presumably.” They are not, technically, but Harry hasn’t reached out to the Ministry to re-activate their watches yet. He wants to have this time with Draco alone.
finished with my work for the evening. But I was thinking that I might go to our little privacy pod. Ron won’t be there, so I can work without distraction.”
“Most weekends. Unless there’s Quidditch the next day. Or exams or something. I mean, this is the first year we’ve been allowed to join in. It’s only for the sixth and seventh years.” He gestured around the room at the lower years who were, for the most part, enviously watching them.
“I’ve been recording on and off all evening.” Draco hopes that some of the off time was during their dancing. He knows he said things to Harry that he wouldn’t want the Ministry to hear.
Draco has to do a double take when he sees him, for though his brain (or, rather, the all knowing knowledge-base inside his mind) is telling him it is Massimo Battaglia, he looks so far from the heir to a multi-million galleon crime family that it is almost laughable. But then, Draco figures, he is probably trying to stay incognito by staying in the cheapest room and wearing hand-me-down skiwear.
“How should Shreeky get Master Draco’s clothes to him? Where is Master Draco?”
“That's not true.”
“No,” Harry said too quickly. Ron narrowed his eyes in suspicion and shrugged himself out from under Harry’s arm. He grabbed Harry’s sleeve and pulled it up to his nose.
“Yes. But also no.” Well, that explained nothing.
“Right,” Draco says. “That.” He feels his hands start to sweat and he wipes them nervously on his trousers. He wants to reach out to Potter again, but he can’t. His heart is racing and his tongue is dry in his mouth. He wishes now that he had waited until dinner time, or at least perhaps cocktail hour. This would be so much easier with alcohol in his system. And in theirs. He takes a deep breath and then blurts out,
“Documenting the evening,” Harry said.
“Dobby is sorry, Master Draco, but Dobby is still not liking your father.”
“Not in the slightest.” He glanced down at his watch. “Huh, it appears we finished with time to spare.”
Draco reads
“Yes.”
“No, you idiot,” Draco snapped. “It’s more complicated than that.”
“What?” Pansy asks. Susan makes a shooing motion with her hands. “Oh, right. Of course.” She stands up and makes her way towards the stairs, grabbing Harry by the arm as she goes. He follows her up the stairs and they run into McLaggen in the corridor leading to the storeroom.
“What are you doing?” he hissed as Draco began to undo his belt buckle. Draco said nothing, only smirked at him and proceeded to unbutton his trousers and unzip his fly. Harry tried to intervene, but Draco batted his hands away. “Seriously. What the fuck are you doing?” Still Draco said nothing. He was kneeling in front of Harry now, careful to keep his feet covered by the cloak.
“Inconsistent how?” she asks.
“Ha,” Greg cries, slapping his hand on his thigh in amusement. “I knew it.”
“Oxford Street.”
“But you’re a Gryffindor. You lot rush headlong into everything with no heed to the risks. That’s like, your
Ron steeled himself for the rejection. He had known it was coming. Of course he had. Despite their afternoon (morning? Time was irrelevant) activities, she couldn’t like him.
“Where are they?” he asks, looking around as if his parents are hidden behind one of the tapestries in the entrance hall.
“What?” Draco cried before he could stop himself. Harry would never tell him if he thought Draco was going to be upset about it. Indeed, Harry now looked distinctly uneasy. His face was scrunched up in discomfort and he was looking at the floor like he wished it would open up and swallow him.
“I’m not.”
“Something like that,” Harry said.
“Probably,” he says.
be seen to.
“The locket was Slytherin’s,” Pansy said. Ron noted that.
“I suspected.”
“I’m not sure I understand the reference.” Potter shakes his head.
Once they’re in the stockroom, Harry pulls out his wand and points it at the door. He shoots a colloportus at it. Draco rolls his eyes.
“Oh, I am,” she said. She looked up at him. “But today reminded me that there is more to life than academics.” He smiled and pulled her close against him, resting his chin on the top of her head.
“But how are you going to convince He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to come at all?” McGonagall asked.
“Greg has had a harder time of things as he actually got the damn thing. I’m not even sure when he had the time to get it. He was in Hogwarts for most of the war. We’ve done everything we can think of to fade it or cover it, but it’s stubbornly still there.
“Uh, yes,” Harry says. “But I never go there. The house elf hates me.” Draco thinks back to when he was a child, visiting his Great Aunt Walburga with his mother. He can’t recall the house elf, but then, Draco at that age wouldn’t have paid any attention to house elves.
“Beg pardon, General,” Pansy says. “What was Agent Wood doing? What is The Reliquary?”
“How would that work?” Pansy asked.
,” Harry says, witheringly. “If I have to call you Cormac, you have to call me Harry.”
“Oh, so he trusted you enough to tell you about us, but he didn’t trust me enough to tell me about you?” Harry is surprised in spite of himself. He had been sure nothing else could surprise him today. “Well, I guess everyone knows about us then.” He sits heavily back down on his chair. He feels prickly from irritation and wonders if this is his magic trying to find some sort of outlet.
“Do you think,” Pansy starts to say, but then she stops herself. Surely, that would be too far fetched.
“Maybe,” he allowed.
After a moment, the pain lessened to a dull ache. He could deal with that. He wondered what had happened to make it hurt so much in the first place and almost stopped walking when he thought it might be that Voldemort had discovered that the horcrux had been replaced. He reached out and clutched at Draco’s hand. Draco glanced at him briefly, but didn’t drop his hand.
“I don’t know,” Potter protests. “I want it to look nice.” Draco takes a deep breath.
Cormac McLaggen, is there?
“Well,” Harry said. “I love you too.”
“I don’t know. I think my thought process went along the lines of ‘fuck it, why not?’”
“This still feels weird,” Ron said, sitting down on the opposite couch.
“Oi,” Ron said, even as Pansy grinned.
“Um,” Draco says. Pansy is staring daggers at him. After glaring for long enough that she is certain that he is uncomfortable, Pansy rolls her eyes.
“That was wonderful,” she gushes. Harry can’t wait to tell George about this. He’ll be thrilled.
“Well, if you don’t need me, I might just head on home.” He begins to stand, but a quick glare from Croaker sends him back to his seat.
“I think so,” he said. “It feels like the others.”
Draco reached out slowly and put his hand gently on Harry’s knee. Harry felt some of his nerves dissipate. He was still unsure why he was so nervous, now of all times. Every other time he had been with Draco, it had been all he could do to just keep his hands off the blond. He chewed his lower lip for a moment before daring himself to bring out his Gryffindor courage again. Rush headlong into this, he told himself, why don’t you!
“Did you do it right?”
“You could even try some running,” Pansy suggested. Harry did and was immediately struck by how uncomfortable it was to run with breasts. He clapped his hands to them to try to stop them from bouncing, because even the bra that Pansy had given him to wear wasn’t doing much.
“You’re not going to want to be nice to me when you hear the next part,” he said. His voice was bitter. “In fact, you probably won’t even want to be near me.” Harry frowned.
“I don’t know. You do live with Greg,” she says. Draco scowls at her and Pansy realizes with a shock that she’s going to have to see Greg again on this assignment. She hasn’t seen him since Seventh Year, although she had barely seen him then. He and Vince had been the Carrows’ favorites and they were often missing from the common room until the early hours of the morning.
“And you’ve named them Moony, Padfoot, Prongs, Dobby, Mini-Kreacher, and Dudley?” Draco asks.
“In the park, we can lie on the grass and just chat.” Harry is now very enthusiastic about this idea and so he turns back to the Battersea bridge and they start in that direction.
“All the other Slytherins were mean to you lot, so I went along with it to fit in.” Ron blinked at her. “I’m sorry. Kids are dumb; teenagers more so.”
“Right,” he said. “Let’s get to work.” He paused as he frantically read through his notes again, trying (mostly in vain) to make sense of them. He looked up to find Draco watching him with interest. “What?”
“So,” Ron says eventually. “You finish your Christmas shopping then?”
“—Emotional intelligence,” George said. Hermione frowned at him. “Got it in spades. Plus, Harry’s practically sitting in,” and here he paused, frowning for a moment before he continued, as though it had been difficult to come up with the right name, “Draco’s lap.”
“Balls.” Draco says it before he can stop himself. At this, Potter snorts with laughter.“What?”
Harry looks up, grinning like a devil. Draco's erection bobs and his boxers shift around it. His face turns pink. He's not supposed to be this excited about the man he's decidedly
“-Can I stop you there?” Ron interjected. Harry snapped his mouth shut. “Look, Harry.” He walked over to Harry’s bed and sat down on the edge of it. “While I am not overly thrilled that you are dating Draco Malfoy, who you date is none of my business.”
“Yes,” Big Dick says excitedly. “Exactly.” He hurries over to Harry. “Would you mind if we put that on a sign?” Harry shrugs his consent and Big Dick pulls out his wand, conjuring up a sign even as Harry is still standing there.
He has sat back down in his seat but is still staring at her, not saying anything.
“Taking charge, Potter?” Draco whispered into his ear. Harry decided to go with it.
“I was just doing my job,” he says, waving away the applause.
“Yes it is.”
“I’m sorry?” he hazards.
“What? How?” Draco turned, the arithmancy instantly forgotten. Hermione gestured to the paper. Draco glared at her for a moment before turning to it. Hermione rolled her eyes.
“He’s here,” Harry said.
“I just told you about the time I’d eaten burnt pasta, Potter,” Draco says, flicking his eyes up at the man before turning his attention back to his food.
“I guess that can be arranged.” Draco turns in Harry’s arms and kisses him. He revels in the feeling of Harry against his body. It is still so novel, their actual intimacy, and he wonders if he will ever get used to it, or if there will always be this thrill in the pit of his stomach. He can’t explain why, but every time he touches Harry, it feels like the first time. And he can’t decide if it felt more like he was getting away with kissing Harry when they were “dating” or if it feels more like getting away with kissing Harry now that they’re secretly actually dating. Either way, Harry’s touch is electric and Draco can’t get enough of it.
“Oh my god you two,” Blaise said. “Get a room.”
“-Draco,” Harry said firmly. “It’s fine. Let’s not spoil Christmas.”
“Yes.” Snape made a noise here that Harry couldn’t figure out. It was somewhere between a snort and a sigh. “As I was saying, this prophecy was the reason
“How do you know it’s from Wood?” he asks. Draco points to the watch that is still sitting atop the box.
Seamus frowned. He spent so little time with the Hufflepuffs that the name didn’t stand out to him.
“I can’t believe our old house elf loves you so much,” Draco said.
Harry looked around and saw Draco staring at him from the Slytherin Table, surrounded by books and paper. As Harry did not have a quill handy, he looked Draco in the eye and gave a small nod instead. Draco’s mouth twisted and his eyes narrowed in disbelief, but he broke Harry’s gaze and went back to his dinner. Harry looked back down at his plate, decided that he was not going to eat any more and stood up.
“I don’t think we would be seen from there,” he said. He stood up and walked over to the chair. “What do you think?” He leaned forward to stare around the fireplace. “It seems quite hidden.”
“But sir—“
“Flirting?”
“So just happy thoughts?” Draco asked as he and Harry moved away from the others. Harry nodded. Draco took a deep breath, closing his eyes for a moment as he thought. Then he opened them again, held his wand out and said,

floorboards and the sound of glass breaking while they were
So he does what he has always done during difficult emotional periods, and throws himself into work.
“I mean, isn’t that why you took that task from You-Know-Who? Because you were trying to save your mother?” Draco hadn’t thought of it that way. He also hadn’t thought about getting the Death Eaters into Hogwarts in a while. He felt a knot form in the bottom of his stomach.
“This isn’t the usual Bûche de Noël,” Draco says, looking back and forth between his parents. Narcissa shrugs.
“What’s that?” Granger asks. Draco opens his mouth to answer, but Ginny, who has clearly been listening to Draco rattle off the rules, explains it before he has a chance. He stares at her, his mouth still open, impressed.
“You lot never have simple answers to anything, do you?” Neville asked and Hermione laughed.
They stay that way until the Polizia Magica arrive.
“We could take the Tube?” Draco suggests.
“It’s a riddle, Harry,” she explained.
“Do you mean to say we can get drunk in a hot tub like we did in Zermatt?” Draco asks. Massi smiles and nods.
“Settle down, settle down,” Slughorn said. “The much anticipated day is here.” He clasped his hands in front of his chest. “Professor Snape and I have inspected all of your potions and have deemed them all safe to try.”
“This is not a joking matter, Draco.” Narcissa reached inside her robes and pulled out a copy of the Daily Prophet. “Would you care to explain this to me?”
“May I have some?” he asked. Draco shrugged and made his way across the balcony to Harry.
“Why?”
“Well, that could have gone better,” Harry said after a long moment of silence. Draco sniggered.
Finally, after what feels like an age, but is really only five minutes, they hear footsteps in the hallway. Draco turns around expectantly and watches as a woman in a Hit Wizard uniform marches towards them. She has so many stars above her crossed wand seal, that even Draco knows she is important. A small name tag identifies her as the Dempsey that Pansy had mentioned.
“Fine.”
“Most of them.”
Hermione stood for a moment, chewing her lip. She watched as Pansy threw her hands over Blaise’s shoulders and began to move her hips gently against him. A bubble of irritation grew in her chest. She tried to push it away, but it stayed there, stubborn and growing with every passing minute. Other people joined them on the dance floor - seemingly buoyed by the fact that someone else had started dancing first. She spotted Ron standing awkwardly to the side of the room and walked over to him.
“Oh, the potion’s fine,” Draco said, waving at the cauldron dismissively. “Tell me who you’re planning to be!”
“On second thoughts, get those off.” There was a rustling noise and Draco imagined that Harry had done precisely that with his own underwear. He could picture Harry’s naked torso and the trail of dark hair that led down to his, ahem, little soldier.
“Uh,” McLaggen says. He looks nervously at Pansy who shakes her head.
be irrational if something happened to someone you love.” Draco glares at her. “You know I’m right. Isn’t that why you did what you did sixth year?” Draco opens his mouth to protest and then shuts it, knowing she is, in fact, correct.
“We got your owl,” said George.
“I wouldn’t even if you paid me to,” she said.
Of course she didn’t like him. He was just deluding himself. He was just a warm body on a bad day. Why would anyone as lovely as her like someone like him?
He stays under the shower stream, but he lets the washcloth drop and fact that he is excited to see Malfoy becomes abundantly clear. The corner of Malfoy’s mouth quirks up into a smirk. He stands, just staring at Harry, for a long moment, before he steps even closer. He is within arm’s reach now, but Harry is going to stand his ground and make the blond come to him. Malfoy, perhaps sensing this, finally closes the distance between them, reaching out and pulling Harry against himself.
“Well, ask him, will you?”
“What’s that?” Harry asked. He was suddenly very aware of the fact that he had shown Draco a secret way into Hogwarts.
“Shut up,” Draco hissed because Harry had perked up at this.
“What are you doing?” Potter asks. It takes Draco a moment to realize that Potter’s talking to him and not to Granger.
Shrugging, he pulled out a cigarette, then crouched down behind the balcony wall to hide from the wind. It took him several attempts to light a match and keep it lit, but after a fumbling minute, he managed it and lit the cigarette.
“Quit complaining,” Harry said. He playfully nudged Draco’s hip with his own.
“Wait,” Draco whispered as they reached the trap door. “I think I forgot my gloves at the Three Broomsticks.” Harry couldn’t help but roll his eyes.
“No, General.”
“And you said you wanted to suck my cock,” Massi shoots back. Draco smirks and shrugs.
anything together.”
Just as he feels the warmth of the potion reach his fingertips, the toaster oven dings to indicate that the toast is done. He looks up to see Potter wave his wand again. Plates and cutlery fly around the kitchen. The fridge opens and the butter flies out, presumably to be applied to the toast, although Draco cannot see where it goes. A moment later, a plate with two pieces of toast lands in front of him. Pansy still looks a little annoyed that Potter has bothered with any sort of breakfast, but as a plate hovers in front of her, she accepts it with grace.
“I just know it!” she cries, spittle flying out of her mouth. “You’s one of them Ministry wizards, ent you?”
“We haven’t explained this well at all, have we?” he asked. Snape shook his head.
“Awkward?” Pansy considered it for a moment. “No.”
“What the actual fuck, Colin?” Harry said, turning to stare into the room. Colin was hanging upside down from a piece of string on the ceiling. Harry did a double take. “Are you being Spider-Man?” This was in fact a stupid question as Colin was in his Spider-Man costume and, well, hanging upside down from a piece of string on the ceiling.
“What’s that?” Harry asked, finally seeming to hear Seamus.
“Nothing,” Draco said sadly. “I’m fine.”
“Why would you immediately assume that I was going to get in trouble?”
“The ones you were going to take to Honeydukes.”
“Now Dumbledore had wanted to explain things to you slowly by showing you some of his personal memories, Potter, but your little,” he paused. “tryst has accelerated our timelines somewhat.”
“My father wanted to see me because he was upset that I had taken you to the Wunderkammer,” Massi whispers. “But then I told him about your reason for coming here, and he’s agreed to see you.”
four of us,” McLaggen says, his eyes flashing in irritation. “But then Oliver Wood killed himself.” Pansy can’t help it. She flinches. She hasn’t had any Wood nightmares recently, but the memories are still sharp in her mind.
“What,” comes an irritated voice from the front of the store. “The hell is this?” Draco turns around to see Jamie standing, hands on hips, staring up at their creation.
“So I don’t have one?“ she asked as they crossed the Entrance Hall.
“Dobby hears that they are, how do the wizards put it? All the rage. Although Dobby doesn’t understand why people are angry. They seem quite popular.”
“Because I knew he

“I also will not be going down there,” Draco said.
“What do you think?” Harry asks, gesturing up at the tall building before them.
and Kreacher appeared.
“I’m fine.”
“Can we sit down for a bit?” Pansy asked. “My feet are killing me.” She gestured down at her shoes which had a three inch heel on them.
“Right now I just want to add these next ingredients and not think about what’s going on in the world. Beyond that, I haven’t thought what I want to do.” Blaise nodded and became all business.
“So what are your plans for after Hogwarts?” Hermione asked. She and Blaise were ensconced in one of the booths at the side of the room. They were opposite each other across the table, but they were leaning close to hear above the music.
“He wouldn’t ask,”
Draco carried the Cup over to the desk and put it down. Then he took a deep breath and pointed his wand at it.
“Um,” he says. “Yes actually.” Draco flicks his eyes over to McLaggen and narrows them. McLaggen appears oblivious to Draco’s irritation.
“I don’t know,” Draco said, so quietly that Harry almost didn’t hear it over the music in the background.
“Is Pansy going to Hannah’s party?” Greg asks, suddenly perking up.
And that’s when they hear the scream.
“Welcome,” she said. “To Christmas lunch. As is Malfoy custom, we will have a full tasting menu, complete with wine pairings. Wilfie here will explain each dish as it comes out. I do hope there are no dietary restrictions.” She said this last part in a way that made it clear that any dietary restrictions would
“Oh, no,” Ron moaned, but everyone ignored him.
“It’s the one my brothers just came out with,” Ron explained. “Extra violent. Fake blood everywhere!” Hermione looked faintly ill, but Draco was delighted.
“You have?”
“Snape gave me this,” he said. Draco took the phial and examined it. After a minute of turning it over in his hands and examining it, he gave it back.
Ministry and if he has access to the Cooler, it must be because Hermione thought it was necessary.
The End
“I didn’t
“Unless you can kill Voldemort-” Blaise flinched at the name “-for me, I’m not sure there is.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry spluttered.
“Details,” he says, but he leans over and kisses her cheek conciliatorily. Without thinking about it, Draco reaches over and takes Harry’s hand. Harry squeezes his fingers and warmth spreads through Draco’s chest.
“No talking,” he said and went back to kissing Harry. And Harry decided he was more than alright with this turn of events. He snaked an arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him closer. He moaned as Draco’s tongue ghosted over his lower lip. And then his eyes snapped open as he remembered that they were still at Honeydukes. He pulled back.
know where it was, there’s no reason I would tell you.” And with that she fled.
,” Draco says. “Imbibe. You said the “D” word.” Ginny laughs into her cup. Seamus points at Harry and nudges Dean. Draco sighs and points at Seamus using his elbow. “You too, Finnegan,” he says. “Pointing.” Seamus scrunches up his face in irritation as everyone laughs. Draco turns over the next card in the pile and the whole thing explodes.
“The park?” Draco asks. Harry points across the river.
“Yes,” McLaggen says. “Then I’m sure you’re aware that this is now a Ministry crime scene.” Harry nods once. “Since you’ve been here, using magic, we can’t turn it over to the muggles, even though it looks like it was just a common muggle murder.”
“I was getting to that,” McLaggen says stiffly. “But it seems you’ve found everything anyway.”
“Really?” she asks. “You’ve made a bet about our friendship?”
, why are we so bad at this?” Draco slapped his hands over his face and wailed.
“Do we have any confirmed members?”
“Fine,” Pansy says. She checks her watch. “See you there in an hour.” With that, she turns and walks out of the house.
“Yes,” she says quickly. “Let me just get my cloak.” The painting closes behind her, leaving Draco and McLaggen alone in the corridor.
“So she’s just a casual wizard supremacist?” Harry spat.
“We can’t let him win,” Draco whispered. A single tear escaped his eyes and made its way down Draco’s cheek. It splashed onto Harry’s shirt.
“So, are you two a pair now?” he asks.
“Hello,” Harry replies. He leans forward and presses their noses together, still keeping eye contact.
Nor did he necessarily expect them to still be together that far in the future.
“Is this more twin core nonsense?” Voldemort asked. “I don’t understand. This is a new wand.”
“Enough for the entire top three years, sir,” Dobby squeaked. “The kitchens like to be prepared.” Dumbledore gave a satisfied nod and dismissed the house elf.
“Oh, stop looking all misty eyed, Potter,” Draco said. He kicked Harry under the table and Harry flushed in embarrassment.
“Really, Harry?” Draco asked. He was still cradled in Harry’s arms, but shifted so that he could look his boyfriend in the face. Or, rather, the cheek.
“I have a contact at one of the banks, who can help us get set up,” Draco says. It is technically true. Seamus would help them set up an account to be sure, but beyond that? Well, Draco doesn’t expect anything to get that far anyway. He just needs them to be on his side for a few days so that he won’t be summarily killed.
get stuck with him,” Harry says. “Lovely.”
get in the way.” Snape raised an eyebrow at him.
Flying while under the invisibility cloak is never ideal, but he’s only going to the third floor. He straddles his broom, then reaches down and bunches the bottom of the cloak together and holds it in one hand so that he won’t be seen from below. In this incredibly uncomfortable position, he kicks gently off of the ground and rises up to the window.
“Whatever,” she says, throwing up her hands. “Croaker believes you and I suppose that’s good enough for me. But you need to understand that it is
“Plus, you couldn’t be anonymous on our team. Hit Wizards are much higher profile than Unspeakables, for obvious reasons.”
“See you around,” she says and then walks out of the bathroom without a backwards glance.
“What did you see, ‘Mione?” Ron asked, turning his attention from Pansy back to the group.
“That was one of the worst days of my life,” Harry whispers. “I felt absolutely awful for what I had done to you.” In his mind’s eye, he can still see Draco lying on the bathroom floor, covered in blood, with Moaning Myrtle’s shrieks in the background.
“Same time tomorrow then?” Big Dick asks the three of them.
“No, I am not.”
“You try cleaning a five storey house without help,” he says. Potter walks to the pantry and pulls out a bag off coffee beans.
“Really?” This is Harry.
“It was Ron’s idea,” she said.
“Believe what?”
“Yes, Draco. The safety of the country is at stake.”
“Yeah,” Ron said. “What about it?”
And he knows he’s right. If their relationship were real, Harry would keep it private.
“He’s the highest ranking in the Ministry. Stands to reason he might be the highest ranking in the Sim Soc.”
“This whole trip was your idea. I say you owe us a round.” Harry rolled his eyes, but pulled his coin purse out of his pocket and counted several galleons onto the table.
“Yes, you’re our insurance policy in case we get caught. We’ll just say the Slytherins bullied us into it.” Blaise’s mouth fell open in shock. They had reached the top of the stairs.
“On second thoughts, no. You can continue,” Harry said. He began fumbling in earnest at Draco’s belt, cursing the fact that there was this additional layer of difficulty before his hand could be on Draco’s cock. The blond’s belt required two hands and so Harry leaned hard into Draco’s shoulder to keep him pinned against the wall while he dealt with the unruly leather.
“Sure if you like.”
“Granger,” Draco intones. He turns his attention to Pansy. “Harry mentioned you needed me?” And Pansy, bless her, walks over to Draco and takes his arm and leads him into the house and away from Granger, who stares at them the entire time and looks like she wants to hex them.
“What were you running down the stairs for?” Greg asks.
“No, I’m clearly
“It feels powerful,” Draco says.
“Sit,” Croaker says as they enter the room. He gestures at the two chairs in front of his desk and they scramble for a minute to bring another chair for Pansy from the side of the room. Once they are seated, Croaker leans forward in his chair and surveys them above steepled fingers.
“Where is Malfoy anyway?”
“If they don’t know that we know that they have Hermione, it gives us the element of surprise.”
“I haven’t broken up with you,” she said with a small smirk. He grinned. “Nor do I plan to.” She put her knife down. The snowdrops were done - separated and the petals minced. She walked around to his side of the table, where he was still slicing the lemongrass into thin strands. She stood behind him and gently slid her arms around his torso.
“You can’t just distract me like that. I have another present to give you.” With these words, Draco disentangled himself from Harry’s arms and walked over to his bag. He rummaged around in it for a moment and then pulled out a small, wrapped parcel which he then thrust into Harry’s hands. Then he stepped back and stared at Harry, gnawing on his lower lip nervously.
“You can hardly talk,” Draco retorts. Harry shrugs and starts to walk again. Draco follows. They walk through the streets of Muggle London in silence for a few minutes, taking turns seemingly at random until Draco asks where they are going.
“Yes, does this mean I can get into your pants now?” Harry smirked and crossed his arms.
The following morning, Draco is awoken, quite suddenly, by a roaring noise. He sits bolt upright in bed, and looks around the room blearily. The roaring appears to be coming from the hallway. He scrabbles around on the bedside table for his wand before remembering that Potter had confiscated it. “
“Oh,” Luna said dreamily. “That makes more sense.” They reached the main staircase and began to climb it. A few people gave them odd looks, presumably because they were still holding hands, but Harry ignored them. It couldn’t hurt for people to think he was dating Luna. It might take the suspicion off of Draco. Justin had guessed the true nature of their relationship far too easily on Saturday.
“No, you dick.”
“Are you ok?” he asked. Harry nodded stiffly. He
“Look, McLaggen, I don’t know what your problem is with me.” McLaggen clicks his tongue. “But I’ve answered all of your questions, under veritaserum might I add. Harry and I were just trying to help. We didn’t kill those people. You have no right to hold me here.” McLaggen sighs and leans back in his chair again. Draco stares at him but does not say any more. Finally McLaggen nods.
“I don’t want to go home. It’s lonely there.”
“Oh, Ron,” Hermione said. “Don’t talk with your mouth full.” Ron looked down at his plate ashamed. He finished chewing.
“Draco is
They walked on in silence for a while.
“So you’re not upset?”
“No! I just think you’re a good Hit Wizard - I mean, clearly Dempsey trusts you, what with putting you on the Reliquary project.”
“Oh you love it,” Draco says. Harry grins at him.
He was distracted by a shot glass levitating down in front of him. He looked around and saw similar shot glasses lowering themselves at each place at the table. Turning in his chair, he saw Pansy with her wand out, levitating the next round of beers through the crowded pub. He frowned. They weren’t on school grounds. She shouldn’t be able to do magic.
“A friendly lunch,” he says. “As friends.”
“Wait,” he said. “This is just maths.”
“There had better be at least one bloody reporter here,” Harry muttered to Draco as they neared the doors to the Great Hall. “I want them to see that it’s done, tell the world about it and then
“But you’re the bloody Boy-Who-Lived,” Pansy protests. “You have plenty of sway.”
“I would, but then I don’t learn anything. I’m a, whatchamacallit. I learn by writing things down.” Pansy cocked her head to the side and looked at him thoughtfully.
“Perhaps we can ask him subtly if he has all his affairs in order yet,” Draco suggested.
“I don’t want to be late. My parents don’t like it when people are late.” Draco’s words were clipped.
“-More can only help.”
“Not here,” she says. Harry nods.
“Well, try me anyway,” Harry said. “I will do my level best to stay calm.” It was the best he could promise. He was, after all, known for being rather hot headed, as Draco himself had pointed out.
“Oh?”
“Your hair,” Harry said. “I forgot it wasn't there.”
“Harry, it’s an hour long get together after work where Joe and Luca invariably get too drunk on firewhisky and we all sing carols and eat mince pies. I’ll be home by seven.”
“Uh, I still need to put my trousers back on.”
“Albus,” came a voice from the front. Harry looked over and saw Mad-Eye Moody. “What’s the Malfoy boy doing here?” If people hadn’t been staring at them before, they definitely were now. Harry saw Draco shift out of the corner of his eye and knew he was standing up straighter under their scrutiny.
“Harry and I are friends,” she says.
“Spaghetti bolognese.”
“What?” Both Snape and Ron asked at the same time. Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling.
. I’m not the Draco Malfoy you knew in school, clearly.” Potter’s mouth twists to the side as he regards Draco, takes in the red pajamas he’d given Draco — the ones that Draco had finally decided just to wear and not make a huge fuss about.
“What are you lot doing here?” he asked.
When Draco doesn’t look away, a smile spreads across Harry’s lips. Draco swallows nervously. No good things are going to come from that smile.

While the Honeydukes clerk rustled noisily around on the other side of the storeroom, Harry leaned in and nuzzled Draco’s neck. He finally settled on a spot just below the blond’s collar line and sucked it gently at first, and then harder in an effort to mark Draco as his. Draco for his part, leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes, just enjoying the feeling of Harry’s mouth on him.
“You’re still drunk,” she said dismissively.
“Well you might be shit out of luck,” he says. “Their season doesn’t start until the 7
“Not really,” he protested. “I tried to but then I had a small coughing fit and I decided I didn’t like it.” Ron seemed mollified by this. He turned his attention to the balcony then, staring out across the dark grounds. They stood for a while in companionable silence before Ron asked,
“Yeah, alright,” Pansy says with a smirk. Greg’s face breaks into a smile and he reaches out and pulls her into a hug. She gently extricates herself. “Not at work,” she says. He nods and releases her, but not before giving her a quick kiss on the top of her head.
“That’s better,” Pansy said. She stretched her feet out in front of herself and then flopped back onto the grass. When he didn’t follow, she tugged him down so that his head was next to hers.
“What if I tell you about the Simurgh Society while undressing you and…” He gestures towards Draco’s crotch.
“Sounds like a plan.”
Feedback is always appreciated :)
By the time he comes back out, Draco is in the fat suit and Pansy is doubled over, fighting back tears of laughter behind him where he can’t see her. He does his best to keep his face impassive. As it is, Draco’s face lights up at the sight of Harry in his leggings and tunic.
“I have to tell you something.” Draco’s words come out in a rush. “Massi took me to the family’s collection of magical artifacts this morning.”
“Which one is yours?” Draco asked. Harry pointed at his bed and Draco dropped his bag on it. Then he beckoned Harry to him. Harry complied, letting the door close behind him.
doing here?” he shot back. The snake reared back in surprise.
“Figured I would ask the blunt question,” he said.
“Oh, aren’t they?” Without him thinking about it, his hand had made its way to where his wand was sticking out of his pocket. He took a deep breath. Hexing Draco would not accomplish anything. (Would it?)
“I’m not sure what you mean.” Pansy takes a sip of her drink. “I haven’t been working with Potter.”
“So what’s the plan then?” he asks once he has taken a sip.
“Are you ready for today?” Harry asks. Draco blinks blearily at him for a moment before his eyes snap open, bright with sudden attention.
“Circe, Greg. I don’t need to know about your sex life,” Draco says, pressing his hands over his ears.
“Not for
“I had a favor to ask.”
,” Hermione said quietly.
“Fair, I suppose,” Draco says.
“Well, no, but mostly because Ron doesn’t throw very good parties.”
“I guess we’ll have to explain it now,” Draco says, his eyes flicking to Massi and the women. Harry nods once, his mouth a thin line.
Outside, the moon rises and sets. Stars move through the sky. The world turns.
“And sad,” Harry added, thinking back to his conversation with Snape when the Potions Master had given him the lotion.
“Mum’s going to be gutted,” Ron said. “Knowing she’s been beaten out by a quidditch shirt.”
“Yes,” she said. “And although my parents may disown me for this, I agree to go out with you.”
“Nothing,” Draco says. Harry stares at him, his hands on his hips. “Fine,” he continues. “Just sometimes it seems like you’re trying too hard to make our relationship look real. Who even kisses their significant other that much?” Harry’s eyebrows lift briefly before he returns his expression to neutral.
“I suppose we’ll come with you,” Hermione said, but Harry was not fooled by her feigned indifference. He had been at the table in Hogsmeade with them all and had noticed how well everyone had gotten along. And the fact that they felt they all needed to hide their friendships from the rest of the school bothered him. So he decided to do something about it.
“I demand a new code name.”
Draco stares at the plates as they float by him. He is fascinated by the restaurant that Potter has taken them to, where they do not order, but instead they pick up food from tiny floating platforms that circle the kitchen area of the restaurant. He has yet to pick anything up - he has been too busy watching each thing go by. He can’t tell what most of them are, but he decides that is a fun challenge. Or, it will be once he actually takes some food.
They bid goodbye to most of their friends on Friday evening and when they went to the Great Hall for dinner, they found that the house tables had been put away for the holidays.
“Only if you want to,” Harry mutters. He looks up as Draco covers his hand in his.
“Draco Malfoy is the Reliquary, isn’t he?” And then she feels him pushing into her mind. She tries to put her mental walls up, but she’s not fast enough. “Holy shit, he is, isn’t he?”
because he needs to talk to Draco without worrying that Massi is going to wake up. He beckons Draco over to him, and Draco clambers out of the bed and then walks around the other side where Harry is. He sits down next to Harry who immediately pulls him into a hug.
“You know,” Blaise said. “You can be something else if it bothers you this much.”
Somehow Harry and Draco made it through the last week and a half of the term without outing their relationship to anyone else. The six of them kept mostly to themselves, and though they did all take part in their respective houses’ end of term activities, their minds were on the plan to steal Hufflepuff’s cup from Malfoy Manor.
“It’s not everyone,” he says. “It’s Hannah! She’s practically family! It’s not like you were going to keep it a secret.”
“Sure you’re not,” Harry said. “I bet you’re free to go wherever you want, whenever you want. You’re certainly not at anyone’s beck and call.” He crossed his arms over Pansy’s ample chest and leaned farther back against the sofa. The snake’s tail was twitching in irritation now, but he decided to keep pushing. “Not to mention, I’m not sure I would want to spend an immortal life as a
there an afterlife?”
“You really haven’t played Wizard’s Truth or Dare, have you?”
“Same difference.” Harry picked his head up again. “Either way it’s going to be bloody difficult.” Draco said nothing. He stared into the flames in the fireplace, nursing his own drink.
“I’ve got him,” Pansy’s voice says over the comms spell.
“Hi,” he says.
“Draco, Harry is dating you for reasons that none of us quite understand, but I don't think it's just for your looks.”
He is not sure how to talk about meeting Massi as he doesn’t want to give away any Ministry secrets, but he manages to talk about him by saying that he and Harry made friends with someone at the resort. He skips over the imperius spell and picks up the story in Milan. It’s easy enough to say that Massi had invited them to come and visit his city, and this also explains their invitation to La Scala.
your costume” Blaise asked. Harry turned his attention to him and properly took in what he was wearing for the first time. He was wearing combat boots, brownish green trousers, a moss green tank top and what appeared to be backpack straps. He was also wearing dog tags, sunglasses and a large utility belt. Harry was surprised to see how in shape Blaise was, as the tank top he was wearing left little to the imagination. If Harry hadn’t already been dating Draco and decently sure that Blaise was straight, he might have considered making a pass at him. And, even just looking at him, he was sure that Seamus already had.
“This asshole has been using a love potion on me.” Draco points to the instructions and translates them for Harry. “So, really, probably on both of us to an extent.”
“I hadn’t much thought,” Blaise said. “If I’m being entirely honest. I was just trying to get through school.” Unspoken in the Slytherin common room was the fact that many of their house were unsure what would even become of them after school. The threat of war hung over everything, and many of them knew on which side their parents lay and weren’t sure whether they did too. But Blaise was not about to bring that up now, instead saying, “I imagine you are looking to be an auror?”
“Speak for yourself,” Harry said. “How do you think it feels for me? You don’t have boobs.” Harry reached up and clutched at his chest.
This couldn’t have happened.
“Nothing,” Blaise admitted. “Which is why we’re here.”
“We would,” Seamus said. “Not that Snape’s not good.” It was true. Snape had blown away all of their expectations as Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. “But as much as I want to ignore it, I can’t help but feel like we’re in the calm before the storm. And I want to be ready when the storm comes.”
“That’s where I come in,” Draco said. “I will tell my mother to hint to Aunt Bella that I’m close to completing my tasks and that once Professor Dumbledore is gone, Harry will be vulnerable.”
“For what?”
“Speak for yourself,” Pansy said. “At least you had trousers on. I was freezing in my skirt.”
, a small voice in the back of her head asks. What about him? She’s quite sure now that she’s going to break up with Greg. She’s known it for weeks now, even if part of her has been in denial. And now, staring at Cormac, she knows she can’t stay with him any longer.
“I bet it’s before Halloween,” she said, failing to keep a small smile off of her face.
“Ok,” Harry says with a shrug. “Then sleep in your underwear. I don’t mind.” Even though Harry knows it will make him even more on edge than he already is. His job as Draco’s handler is to make Draco comfortable, not himself. He notices that Draco is still wringing his hands together. “Do you need me to look away?”
“Oh,” Bellatrix said. “What do we have here?” Her curly black hair was not contained by her hood, but rather streamed out and down her side, making her recognizable even with her mask on. “I know you. You’re that mudblood bitch. The one who’s friends with Potter.” For reasons unknown to Hermione, Bellatrix reached up and pulled her mask off. She smiled at them, her eyes wide and teeth dirty. “Where is the boy?”
Hockey is still ongoing, so I may still be delayed in publishing.
Draco could hardly complain as he himself was busy trying to undo Harry’s shirt. He felt his competitive side come out as Harry’s hands made their way down his front. Two could play at this game.
“Don’t mention it.”
“I’m a guest in this house.” Harry hoped that actually meant something. He figured it would be bad press for him to be found dead at Malfoy Manor though, or, rather Pansy.
She took his hands and placed one on her hip and held the other out. Before he could protest, she began leading him in some sort of fast dance, where he mostly seemed to stand still while she moved around him. And it was like she projected the dance moves into his brain, because he barely thought about what he was doing - he just moved with her and with the music.
“Yes, and I can’t thank you enough for those hangover potions.” Neville gave him a small smile and took a bite of his own dinner. “What was in the Hufflepuff common room? Or should I ask
to be anything,” he says. “If anything, I wanted to be bloody normal.” He leans back into the armchair’s soft cushions. “You try having teenage angst on top of being stressed out about some asshole constantly trying to kill you, all the while people are telling you that
“I know that,” Draco snaps. “But how to get it all organized? I never used to pack for myself at home. We always had house elves.”
wardrobe, along with most of the things strewn around his bedroom and ensuite. Draco hadn’t thought this was possible, but as his clothes all but fly out of the suitcase, spilling all over the floor, it’s obvious that’s exactly what’s been done. Well shit. And with no magic, he’s going to have to put all of this away by hand.
“Agreed,” Harry said. “And now that we’ve finished congratulating ourselves on how great we are, we should work on shield charms.” There was a smattering of grumbles, but it didn’t take long before they were on all their feet. Harry walked them through the basics before instructing them to cast their shields. He walked around, correcting and encouraging as needed, until he was sure they had mastered it. Then, he started shooting scores of stinging jinxes at them. Only Hermione managed to keep him out.
“How Slytherin of you,” Malfoy says. Parkinson’s grin turns into a smirk. She shrugs.
“Draco. Those are not your pajamas.”
“It’s just that it’s the last day before the Hogwarts term, and I am expecting a bit of a rush. You know how it goes - last minute supply runs.” Draco nods. His family, of course, were never so disorganized, but he understands that it can happen.
Draco feels bile rise in the back of his throat. He claps a hand to his mouth, willing himself not to be sick. He looks anywhere but at the bodies and notices the broken window. Wind is blowing through it, fluttering the curtains. He wonders if this was the shattering glass they had heard.
“Is it?” Draco asked. Harry nodded.
“Thanks.”
“I’m going to get another,” she says, gesturing at it.” Do you want anything?” She slides out of the booth and stands up. McLaggen nods and Pansy heads out to the front room. There is a gaggle of patrons around the bar, but she signals Hannah through the throng, and bless her Hufflepuff heart, Hannah makes her another whisky soda water on the spot and hands it over.
“Oh right,” Pansy says, smirking. “I forgot you had to repeat your seventh year.”
“You used an
“Yeah,” Greg says. “But you were dating Oliver Wood for months and no one was any the wiser.” Draco pauses to consider how best to address this. Of course, he and Harry had gone “public” with their relationship to establish his cover story in the Ministry, not because of their actual closeness and he can’t tell Greg that.
“-And all the fizzy drink and juice you can carry,” Draco cut Harry off.
“Please?”
“Were you not listening during your trial?” Harry sits up and looks Draco in the eye. Harry’s eyes are rimmed with red.
“It seemed like a collection of things people didn’t want found. I saw Trelawney tossing some empty sherry bottles in here once. I doubt she knew what the room was though.”
, you idiot. How could it
“It’s a necklace that will protect you,” Dumbledore says. “It’s very important that you wear it when you fight Voldemort.” Harry frowned at the necklace for a moment before putting it around his neck. The stone felt cold against his skin.
“Prost,” Draco said, clinking his goblet to Ron’s. The rest of them followed suit.
“Right,” Draco says after a minute’s long silence. “So then the working theory is that Hermione’s been kidnapped?”
“Oh,” McLaggen says, clapping a hand to his chest. “You wound me.”
Draco glances up at Harry, but the other man is not looking at him, but rather gazing out over the river.
Indeed, even just thinking back on it now, he found himself growing excited. He closed his eyes and imagined her lips on his again. Imagined her hands running through his hair. Imagined her hands running over his chest. Imagined her hands moving south and… It was too much. He reached into his pajama trousers and imagined that his hands were her hands.
Draco can’t quite believe the conversation he is in. Nothing about the past few days seems real. Most of it has been shrouded in a veil of tiredness after his late night Reliquary reading and, ahem, after last night’s activities led to him not getting much sleep for a second night. But Circe last night had been worth it.
“I still feel like you’re mocking me with that name. “
“That was his watch.” His voice catches slightly in his throat and he prays that Greg does not notice. Greg begins to move his wand through the air, staring at something that Draco can’t see as he does. Draco does not ask where Greg learned how to perform that sort of magical analysis. He is sure the answer would have something to do with Greg’s time as the Amycus Carrow’s teacher’s pet in his Seventh Year at Hogwarts. That time is not a topic they discuss frequently, as both of them are still working to put it behind themselves.
Harry talks to it quickly and then dispatches the patronus. Then he lowers his wand and his shoulders sag. Draco reaches out and pulls Harry back into his arms and Harry falls into them gratefully, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“There’s no need to shout.”
“And I’ve sometimes wondered exactly how close you two are,” Fred said. Draco gave a strange, strangled yelp, which set them all to laughing.
“Cheers,” Potter says, smiling warmly, and they clink glasses. Draco moves to the sofa and sits down. After a moment, Potter chooses one of the armchairs and lowers himself into it. “And yes, I imagine that Ron does still think you’re a twat.”
“I think McLaggen’s an equal opportunity lover,” Draco said and Harry snorted in amusement. “He’ll get off with anyone.”
“And what did you tell him?”
“Which could have been prevented if you had tried harder at your Occlumency lessons,” Snape hissed.
It’s a flimsy excuse, but Pansy’s had three drinks now and hate sex with Cormac McLaggen sounds oh so appealing. She’s seen him in the training facility and knows exactly what kind of irritatingly attractive physique is under those robes.
“Do you,” Blaise started to ask, snapping Hermione back to the moment. He faltered there, then took a deep breath. “Do you want to go sit outside?” When she didn’t respond, he continued to blather on. “There are chairs and fire pits. I mean, it should be warm enough. But then again, we don’t have to-”
He pulled down a bottle of Campari, a bottle of gin and then rummaged around in the cooling cabinets for some vermouth and mixed up a quick Negroni for himself.
“Look at me,” he instructs. Draco flicks his eyes away from the camera. “Are you OK?” Draco nods. “Because we don’t have to do this.”
“Why didn’t you ask me to join your coalition?”
“We heard there was a party tonight,” Joe says.
“There aren’t any pictures,” he said.
“Welcome back,” he says.
“I thought-“ he starts to say.
“It’s ok,” Harry says slowly. “Wait. He let
“This is so frustrating,” Harry said to Draco later that night. They were sitting on an outdoor sofa in front of a roaring fireplace courtesy of the Room of Requirement.
“Give her a chance,” he said. “I think you might be under the impression that Hermione’s more uptight than she actually is.”
“Harry Potter?” someone asks.
“Plumbing?” he repeated.
“Those two things aren’t related?”
“Because we could be,” Joe says, appearing behind Luca. “We’ve been good for like a whole week now.”
“Oh my god, you two,” Blaise hissed, walking over to them. “Stop being so bloody obvious.”
“Water under the bridge. Welcome to the Ministry, Mr. Malfoy.” Malfoy purses his lips but nods.
“Don’t give me that bullshit, Draco. I know I haven’t seen you in a while, but if you’ll recall, there was a time when I was the one person who knew you better than either Greg or Vince.” She can tell by the way his scowl intensifies that she is right.
“Can I have four more of these, Dobby?” he asked, thinking of his fellow Gryffindor roommates. “In fact, it might be a good idea to distribute these to the entirety of the Sixth Year.” Dobby looked at him, his head tilted to the side in question.
“Oh, right. Yes, of course.” He moves to the side and leans in what he hopes is a casual manner against the wall next to the door. As his hand touches the wall, he feels for the security ward and adds Potter to the list of allowed people. “Come in, come in.” He gestures and Potter finally takes the hint and walks inside. Draco shuts the door behind him. “Uh, the sitting room is upstairs.” He allows Potter to walk up the stairs before him and it is only when he is then eye level with Potter’s arse that he thinks that perhaps he should have gone first. And now he is worried that Potter will think he is checking him out. Which, in all fairness, Draco is, but he does not want Potter to know that.
“How? You were training people in magical skills. For war and fighting and whatnot.”
But then, all too quickly, it was gone. Harry looked down at his plate again. Why was there so little of this delicious meat? He knew you could have too much of a good thing, but he didn’t think he would ever tire of that flavor.
“And it's not as though I can't come up with things to do on my own.”
He orders dessert even though Harry protests that he is full. Harry doesn’t know it, but dessert is half the reason they came here. He is confident that Harry will be able to eat at least a few mouthfuls of soufflé once he sees it.
He nervously pats down his hair and saunters (casually he hopes) into the main aisle where he finds said brunet, loitering by the Witch Weekly’s, all of which depict the two of them passionately making out on the cover. (Draco had successfully snuck one into his locker earlier for later wanking sessions.)
“Charming.” At this, Potter chuckles. Draco ignores him for a moment in favor of his wine, which he swirls around in his glass, before raising the glass to his nose. He wishes he were better at distinguishing the different aromas of wine. He always just thinks it smells like wine, a fact that Hannah likes to tease him about. He tries, he really tries, to discern hints of blackberry or leather or whatever, but fails. He takes a sip and lets it settle over his tongue. It is good wine - very good wine in fact. Draco may not know how to discern the individual notes in a glass of wine, but he can tell if it’s good. He holds the glass towards Potter.
“Right,” he says as the team members begin to move throughout the store. “I will be in my office.” He hurries away, eager to get started on his morning cauldron cake.
“Sorry,” Draco says. “Flourish and Blotts employees only.”
He needn’t have worried, however, as Narcissa was far too distracted by Draco and worrying about the other guests who were coming. She spent most of the walk to Draco’s bedroom fussing over his hair or his tie or just resting a hand protectively on his shoulder. It made Harry strangely jealous - not because she was doing all the things he wanted to be doing, but because it was clear how much she cared about her son, and Harry had never had someone love him that way.
“What are you sorry for?” Harry pulls Draco closer to him. They are toe to toe now.
“You were fucking there,” Potter spits. “You were the last person to see him.” At this point, his voice catches and he balls his fists in his lap. Pansy’s head snaps around again.
“You mean, me taking all of your money,” Draco retorted. Harry rolled his eyes.
“I have other skills,” he said. “It’s just that taking shots is not one of them.” Pansy reached up and patted him good-naturedly on the shoulder. At that moment, the song changed and Hermione watched as excitement crossed Pansy’s face.
“And now he’s dead,” Blaise said. It was not a question.
In Transfiguration, he did make more of an effort, for fear that McGonnagal would take points from Gryffindor if he didn’t. But the teapot that he was attempting to change into a cat still steamed slightly out of its nose at the end of class.
“So you’ve just dispensed with the niceties?”
“Are you going to let me in on what these things are? Or are you going to dance around talking about it all morning?” Harry asks. He walks over to the table against the wall as he notices it is covered in papers.
It takes him a moment to find the source of the noise. The creature making it is much shorter than Draco would have expected. It’s shiny and round and with the bedroom door now open, it’s almost deafening. As Draco watches, it lurches towards him. And that’s when he notices the bits that poke out from underneath its shiny shell. ‘Bits’ is the only way he can think to describe them. They’re almost hairlike, and they’re spinning faster than his eyes can follow. He jumps backwards, but the thing keeps coming for him.
“Fuck me, you’re incompetent,” the first person hisses.
“You have an amazing poker face,” he said. “Where did you learn how to look so impassive?” Draco picked up his beer and took a large swig of it. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. He considered Harry for a moment as if deciding how best to answer.
“Nothing,” Blaise said. “Just curiosity.”
“We should probably ask Hermione if she would want to join,” Harry said. Ron turned pale and quickly shook his head.
“I don’t deserve you,” he whispers before he can stop himself. “But then, I don’t really have you,” he adds sadly. He doesn’t think he has said the last part loud enough for anyone but himself to have heard it, but evidently Harry does.
He tries to stay positive. They have a plan. They do. And if it all goes well, or rather doesn't all go tits up, they will have helped bring down one of the most notorious crime families in the European wizarding community. He concentrates on that light at the end of the tunnel as he fixes a smile to his face.
“I don’t know if I would say escalating,” Pansy says slowly.
Really though, Harry thinks, looking around the table. He could almost imagine himself in this family. And isn’t that a strange thought. Not that he’s ready to marry Draco or anything like that. But it’s nice to think that it’s a possible future. He catches Draco’s eye and Draco smiles, still chattering to his mother, and warmth blooms in Harry’s chest.
“Sandwiches,” he says confidently and then tears open the paper. It is not sandwiches, though Harry cracks a grin at the guess. Instead it is a beautiful remembrall that glows red as Lucius holds it.
“To get spotted by wizarding paparazzi, of course.”
“The port key team has isolated the coordinates.The house in question appears to belong to a civilian, though we are not sure who that civilian is just yet. Beryl has gone to fetch the property records.”
dressed as a dementor,” Hermione said.
“So, is now the time to prepare the castle for battle then?” Professor McGonagall asked.
“And why wouldn’t I do that?” Harry shrugged.
“That and you’ve both stopped denying that your obsession with each other was most likely due to you two being attracted to each other,” Hermione said. “And as you were no longer actively enemies, the obsession no longer manifested itself as hatred.”
off of the bedroom. Draco’s eyes go wide as he looks around at the built in shelves. You could fit all of Draco’s closet in here and still have over half of the space empty. And this is even
“I’m still not sure this is a good idea,” he said.
“It’s none of my business, mate,” he said. “But if you ask me, aside from cursing your dick off, this is the happiest I’ve seen you in a while. You haven’t worried about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named all week.”
“Claudia in particular?” Seamus asked, waggling his eyebrows suggestively. Neville dropped his gaze back to his plate and said nothing, which was all the talking he needed to do to say yes.
“No?” he hazarded.
“Voldemort tried to kill me.”
“Like Occlumency.”
“How’s Hogwarts been without us?”
“What did I say about the details!”
Malfoy continues to scowl and Harry isn’t sure there is much he can do to change that. He tries to put himself in Malfoy’s place and imagine what he is feeling. He imagines just picking up a book one day and that being the reason he works for the Ministry. But as Harry loves his job at the Ministry, he doesn’t quite see how this is a bad thing.
“Fine,” he said. “But no one else can know.”
“Circe,” McLaggen says. “Let’s put up this evidence board and you’ll see what I mean.”
“How about the Szechuan crispy pork?”
on me?” Draco asks, incredulous.
“Same thing?” Draco asked. Seamus frowned and thought about it for a moment.
“Nothing,” he said sweetly. Draco crossed his arms and tapped his foot on the floor, but Harry just continued to smile. He scowled and then turned to look at Seamus and Ron.
“I think there are some bad people in the Ministry.”
“What are we supposed to do with these names?” Pansy asked once they had finished deciding on them.
“Should we all come?” Blaise asked. The plan had been for Draco, Ron and Harry to go and the rest of them to stay behind as they could only fit three people under the invisibility cloak to get out of the Hogsmeade cellar.
“I was just surprised by him,” Massi says. “That’s all. Please Draco, keep doing what you were doing.”
“I gave you my jumper,” Ron pointed out.
“You’re no fun.” Draco shrugs again and walks off only to be accosted by Joe and Luca who are dressed as jungle explorers.
“He got hurt in his trouser area,” Draco said. Then he frowned at himself, irritated that his grasp of the English language seemed to have failed him.
Draco looks Harry square in the face as he continues to move ever so slightly under him. After what feels like an age, Harry lowers himself back down to Draco’s level. He kisses him briefly before moving down his body again. This time, he catches the waistband of Draco’s trousers between his teeth and tugs. Nothing happens. Draco lifts his hips up and Harry tries again, before Draco bats him away and pulls down his trousers on his own, bringing his underwear with them.
“Four people, dying on the same street in two months? That seems significant. Not to mention, the person who had owned Potter’s house died of an apparent drug overdose in August.”
“Shots.”
“The rumor is that they're dating,” he whispered.
“That’s not at all distracting,” he said. She smiled into his back and hugged him closer. With a sigh, he put down his knife and then turned in her arms to face her. “I thought you were very serious about school work.”
“Potter,” she acknowledges as the door closes behind her. “Nice place you have.” She looks around the entrance hallway appreciatively. Harry nods stiffly and leads her into the sitting room, where he left Malfoy.
“No.”
,” Draco said. He walked over to Harry and sat down next to him. “See, you’re more than just a pretty face.”
“Excluding my Weasley jumpers,” Harry said quickly.
“Draco,” Harry calls after him, but Draco ignores him, so Harry follows him. Narcissa and Lucius look up in surprise as they cross the threshold.
The proprietor of the Hog’s Head had not been pleased to see one Hogwarts student emerge from behind his sister’s portrait shortly before his eleven am opening time. He was even more displeased to see six of them emerge fifteen minutes later, including a pair of twins. He had always been slightly distrustful of twins.
“How many fucking Unbreakable Vows do I have to swear?” McLaggen asks. He crosses his arms and slumps back in his chair.
“Thanks for rubbing that in.”
“I don’t know about you two,” Pansy says as they make their way over to the elevators again. “But I am starving.”
If anyone feels like beta-ing a story, let me know. ;)
“Well, he’s at the very least smitten with you,” Greg says. And then in true Greg fashion, he walks away before Draco can protest any more.
“But why, Pansy?” Malfoy asks, ignoring their back and forth. “Why lie about that?” She shrugs.
“Yes,” she said.
“Would you consider being more than that?” Her heart soared, which was both unexpected, and also, had she been paying attention to any of the signs her body had been giving her, completely predictable.
He tries to think about what he might offer to do if he heard Harry being tortured. But things are different now. Right? He’s not a sixteen year old boy anymore. He knows how to fight. He’s fully capable of holding his own against another wizard, or even, he hopes, a group of wizards. And more importantly, he knows he’s not alone. He has Pansy and - gag - McLaggen, not to mention Mortimer Banks and that other bloke who’s apparently on the anti-Simi-whatsit team. And Greg, in a pinch.
“That’s like half the dessert table,” he said once she had finished.
“I’m being serious.”
He bit his lip guiltily and looked away from Draco, turning his attention instead to Hermione who was sitting across from him. He took in her costume for the first time and his eyebrows went up in surprise. She was wearing the silver mini dress from Austin Powers, and presumably, though Harry couldn’t see them under the table, the knee high silver boots. Her hair was swept up into a slick pony tail on top of her head and she had straightened her curls. Harry was agog. He suddenly felt like everyone had better costumes than him.
“What do you think you might see?” Seamus asked. He was sitting across from Harry, playing with his food more than eating it. Ron shrugged.
“Go back inside,” he said. “I’ll join you in a bit.”
An hour, and several drinks later, everyone was in high spirits. Hermione had emerged as undoubtedly the best player, as evidenced by the way in which she was still the most sober, which was how she preferred to be. Most sober was a relative term as they were all three sheets to the wind.
“It’s going to be fine,” Harry whispered and he saw Draco nod beside him. After one last squeeze of his hand, Draco dropped it and reached instead to the door handle. He turned it and pushed the door open.
“Not so fast,” Harry says, loosening his grip. Draco pouts at him. “No,” Harry insists. “You’re not allowed to come yet.”
“Don’t call him that,” Harry said, exasperated.
So Draco starts thrusting. He doesn’t go far with each thrust, just enough to get some friction, but with each rock of his hips, he gets a little deeper. He keeps up the rhythm of his hand, matching it with the rhythm of his thrusts, and before he has the chance to ask Massi if it’s alright or not, he’s all the way in.
Harry, who had previously felt at least slightly optimistic, felt his mood drop.
“Do you know something we don’t know?” Blaise asked, grabbing her arm and looking intently at her. Hermione flushed. She shook her head, not daring to speak for fear that her voice might give something away. Blaise let his hand drop. He turned back to Pansy.
“Do you love him?”
Draco swung his legs around and clambered off of his bar stool. He swayed slightly as he tried to gain his balance. He glared at the bottle of whisky that was still sitting on the bar. It was the whisky’s fault he was so tipsy. But liquid courage was what he needed, so he grabbed the bottle by the neck and walked over to the door.
“Shit,” he said. “Narcissa can be intense sometimes.”
“Thank you, Blond Unicorn.”
“You were hardly an unwilling participant,” Draco pointed out. Harry scowled, but conceded the point.
They are going to take the Eurostar to Paris and then change to an overnight sleeper which will take them through France to Switzerland. From there, they will board another train to take them to the alpine town where they will be staying.
“Covert affair? You make it sound like we’re spies or something.”
As dawn’s pale fingers begin to stretch across the sky, Draco finally sets the book down. He has read the entire thing in one sitting. He takes a deep, steadying breath, and then immediately falls asleep, his head finally falling back against his pillow. He does not see the pages of the book tear themselves out of the spine, fly up into the air and disappear until he is left with nothing but an empty cover.
“Well then,” Dumbledore said over the sound of Kreacher’s sobs. “Who wants to destroy a horcrux?” Kreacher abruptly stopped crying.
“And you haven’t even taken me on a date yet,” she said. “Do you just expect me to put out?” Ron’s eyebrows shot up.
“And now it seems we have to destroy all his other souls first.” Harry threw his head back dramatically on the sofa cushions, being careful not to spill the scofflaw he was holding.
“Seriously, Ron,” he said. “Go have fun.”
“I don’t have time for your feelings, Draco,” Pansy snaps.
“During an attempt to neutralize a cursed object, the object got the better of me.” There were several oohs of sympathy. “Professor Snape helped stabilize the curse and localize it to my hand, but unfortunately that was only a temporary measure. I regret to inform you that before the summer is upon us, I shall succumb to the curse.” He paused and allowed for the group to talk amongst themselves for a long moment.
“Would you mind,” Harry says to Draco over breakfast. “If we took our time getting home?”
“I take it you’re staying then?”
Is Massi actually an arsehole? Was he really just wanting one night with Draco in Zermatt and didn’t know how to go about doing it? Is Massi just playing Draco like he and Harry are playing him? Or does he actually like him? And if he does, what does that mean?
“Is he?”
“Greg,” Draco calls, walking from room to room looking for his friend. Ginny is in tow. “We have someone who wants to learn Exploding Gobstones Snap.” The alcohol in his system is telling him this is the most important thing in the world right now. Ginny is chattering in his ear as he looks for Greg and Draco is surprised to realize he is enjoying her company.
“So we’re going to stick plastic on your face,” Pansy confirms.
“She’s still at the Ministry.” He slumps back down in his chair.
The box does nothing as he approaches it. It just sits there, box-like and unmoving. Draco decides to just bite the bullet. He walks the last few feet to the box, crouches down next to it and picks up the watch. Before he can stop himself, he lifts it to his nose. It smells like Oliver’s cologne. Draco recognizes it instantly and falls backwards onto his arse, all the energy draining out of him. It is so sudden - it almost feels like being punched in the gut. He feels Greg’s hand on his shoulder again, this time from above.
“But it’s Friday and I'm tired and Ron usually supplies the conversation and the entertainment for the evening.”
walk,” Ron said.
“Why don’t we start with once a month,” Harry says. Kreacher scowls.
“No, I think it would be far more fun to do it that way,” Draco said, a smile playing about his lips.
