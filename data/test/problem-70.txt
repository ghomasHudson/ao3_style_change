“Hell, no.” Ron Weasley curses before walking out the doors, and toward the parked car. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas follow him, calling their friend’s name.
But it is too late to go back on his word now. “3...2...1….Go!”
Although Kingsley’s nowhere to be seen, Robards is there, standing in front of the door almost in an effort to guard it and prevent the crowd from entering.
Her eyes open wide as she looks up at Harry - for a moment, Harry sees Hermione’s face in her, despite her of shock of similarly curly, but red hair. “Really!?”
He chuckles. "I'm glad you liked my technique - I honed it at Hogwarts."
“But Hermione told me something. She reminded me that we were all children, that you were just a child-”
“Thanks.”
“No,” Harry sighs, dropping his head, “you’re not.”
“I don’t want this class to consist of just lecture. You all get enough of that the rest of the year. I want this class to be interactive.” Malfoy starts passing out the textbooks and paperbacks. “It’s one thing for me to explain my research, but it’s another thing altogether for you to
“Goodnight, Draco. And don’t worry about the paperwork.” She wheels away, and there’s nothing else for Draco to do but close the door.
"That's very interesting..." Hermione trails off. "I've made a few connections before, but I never thought to fully explore it."
Something snaps in him; Malfoy comes to a dead stop and begins some sort of rant with: “Potter-!” but before another word can leave his mouth, the books that had been slowly slipping out of his grasp tumble painfully onto both his and Harry’s feet.
“Why should I?”
“You’re welcome,” Harry replies, his voice careful.
“And stick around, will you? I have something to give you after this.”
That surprises a laugh out of him. "I suppose you could call it that."
He whispers back at Hermione, "What do you mean?" Arthur glances at them and raises an eyebrow.
A hand comes down on Harry's shoulder. It's Ron. "It was really awesome, Draco."
“Harry.” Malfoy takes a deep breath in, as if preparing to say something important, but he doesn’t have a chance to before it all goes to shit. Rain begins smacking into the roof in big, fat droplets. They bleed through the ceiling, through the walls, through everything.
Outside, a wind picks up, its howl audible even inside. Though sunny, the sky is still gray as gravel, and the shrubs and grasses still shriveled and leached of color. Normally, on a day like this, Draco would be out shoveling manure, curing meat, or shoring up on wood. Something to get his hands on the dirt, in water, into something real.
“Not everyone can have blonde hair,” Harry grumbles while self-consciously running his hand through his hair in an effort to rid himself of the snowflakes he’s sure have congregated there.
He shoots Harry a pointed look and turns up his nose a little bit. “You always had a choice, and you chose to bother me.”
Harry can’t think. His brain is foggy, muddled, and he can’t quite comprehend the sequence of events that just occurred - it seems like Malfoy is constantly running circles around him.  So he just mumbles an answer, “Hagrid’s,” and feels like he’s slowly sinking into the couch now that Malfoy isn’t sitting there too, helping him float.
“You earned it.”
“What are my duties,” Harry manages to get out through tightly gritted teeth. “You forgot to mention them during the meeting.” Behind him, Harry feels and hears every stroke of every letter of every word of every sentence that the reporters are scribbling down in their notepads.
Harry still goes to the Burrow for Christmas, and Ginny is still there, but they aren’t an item anymore, let alone parents. With Bill and Fleur still madly in love, Percy and his wife going steady, George and Angelina happily married for almost a decade, Charlie and his boyfriend going strong for longer, and Ginny with a different woman on her arm every year, Harry is the only one to show up alone. And Christmas is just around the corner.
Harry marches up to the counter “Excuse me.” The barista waits for him to catch his breath. “Have you seen a tall, blond man in here?”
“Mm. Goodnight.” And with that, Draco slips off into sleep. Harry knew he was too tired for his own good.
“The Manor?”
As promised, it comes sharp and insistent precisely at 7pm. "Coming," he half-groans, half-shouts at the door. Usually Kreacher is the one to greet guests for Harry, but he's not here tonight for some reason.
A strong flush has risen to Ron's cheeks now, almost turning him as red as his robes. "Don't you dare blame her for your own mistakes."
Draco turns. It’s Longbottom. “Yes?”
“I said don’t be. Nothing you said wasn’t true.”
heroes here are you all - the original activists. The original organizers. Yousef, Tammie, Aria - you three laid the groundwork. You were fighting for werewolf and non-magical rights when I was in the womb-” This elicits a few laughs. “-and you were doing a damn good job of it, too. I’m just here to design the merch and plan brunch.” More laughter.
"The new Enchanted Scorebook. I've been trying to get it for months." He starts thumbing through, his face full of awe. Harry likes the look on him. "It will mark notes while I play, and even give me suggestions when I'm composing. It's a must-have for the musical-magical community."
"It's quite an unusual path," Arthur says, "I'd be very interested in reading your research sometime."
"She’s right," Hermione jumps in, scrutinizing his look. "You don't look half bad like that. Especially with the suit."
"Okay," he manages to get out before Ron all but wrestles him over to the group and out the door. The last sight Harry gets before the door slams shut is Draco sitting at the very front of the club, giving him a slight wave.
“No, I wasn’t.”
“Even if you’re with the love of your life?” Harry asks. In some of Draco’s ex-boyfriends’ mouths, the question would be a trap laid at his feet, ready to sink in its metal teeth and never let go. But Harry is empty-handed, and the ground is flush only with grass.
“Hey.”
The cabinet handles dig into his thigh. “Alright,” he breathes out. “Alright.”
Harry turns to Draco. His face, like all of him, is memory, yes, but also oracle, prophecy, future truth.
“What does ‘endemic’ mean?” Longbottom asks, walking beside him.
Rose’s upper lip quirks, bringing Harry back to his Hogwarts days when frequently saw her very same expression on Ron’s face every time he tried to bullshit an essay. “I have to check my schedule,” Rose announces before scrambling out of Harry’s arms and running into the hallway, presumably heading to her room.
(Art by me)
It takes him a long time to fall asleep that night; the knot in his stomach refuses to unravel enough to let him slip away.
“Oh. Sorry.”
Draco rises to his feet and puts on his coat. "I'm afraid not, I must go the club for some last minute rehearsals."
The men thaw, too. Draco teaches them how wizardkind used to walk with dragons, and how dragonkind taught their ancestors numerology and a crude form of alchemy. How wizard tongues used to know the sounds of Draconic, but, with generations and generations of strife, the muscles have atrophied, and the knowledge lives in them no longer.
?” Upon realizing that no, they hadn’t decided what to research, the pair dissolve into laughter.
Public events like those were always hell, what with hordes of hungry reporters and arse-kissers constantly on the Golden Trio’s tail, but at least they had each other to rely on.
Supper passes uneventfully, and without much conversation. Longbottom tries valiantly to buoy his group’s mood and appetite, to no avail. Weasley still looks as though he’d swallowed a slug. Thomas and Finnigan are trying their best to pretend as though Draco doesn’t exist. And Harry. Harry is still staring - a little subtler than before, but staring nonetheless.
"I think this is what Draco's research might be about. I think there's something...magical here."
Draco doesn’t respond, just watches as the car crawls closer and closer, enters their circle, and pulls off the side, to a mostly unused parking lot. A few minutes later, he hears the doors slam one after another and men’s voices rise in the air - muffled through the glass.
The whispers increase
"But...it's black."
After brief introductions with the rest of his team - Robin, Stella, and Gordon - they all get down to business.
Harry spots an empty desk in the front left corner and quietly slides into the seat. He looks around to see if anyone is staring at him or questioning his continued presence in the classroom, but every single student’s attention is already focused on Malfoy and words coming from his mouth.
Instead, he’s here. Waiting on people who, for all he knows, have canceled already.
“U-um, Malfoy?”
Harry’s thoughts are interrupted when Draco slides on the couch and into his arms. They’ve stopped practicing, and someone has charmed the piano to play small ditties all by itself.
A pause. “My point is that this is normal.”
A beat. "Fine. I'll fuck off. Just don't talk to us - especially not 'mione - until you get your shit together, alright?" With that, he turns on his heel and stomps out of Harry's cubicle, not bothering to close the door behind him.
"Okay."
Draco’s affections come swift and easy after that - like all this while he has been holding his breath, and now he’s finally letting go.
They stay like that for several long moments, holding each other close while Draco shudders and tries to regain control of his breathing. Their embrace is pleasant - perfectly warm for the wintery conditions outside. Harry is surprised it isn’t currently snowing.
I'm on tumblr: @Inofaro - I will be posting some of my thought processes behind this fic over there in the coming days, so if you're interested in that, check it out! And generally, that is where I post updates on current projects, so give me a follow if you enjoyed this and want to see more.
“Draco.”
“Alright, alright. We can hyphenate.”
"Jazz?" Arthur leans forward with interest and a steaming dinner roll in his hand. "Do they hold shows every night?"
Harry breathes out slowly and looks to the sky. The stars have come out. “It must be nice in the summer.”
, though Harry wouldn’t know personally.
“Ready?” Ginny’s announces the start now. Draco and Harry look at each other and their audience once last time. Ron is holding Rose, who gives them both two thumbs up. The rest of the children look on in awe.
Suddenly, Stella jumps onto all of them, knocking the wind right back out of Harry.
"So it's settled then?" Angelina asks. "Because I'll have to let my parents know that we're leaving early from dinner tomorrow."
Harry and Malfoy step inside, careful to avoid the letter blocks strewn across the linoleum. The woman waves them over to what seems to be a sitting room that was repurposed into a large playroom before disappearing up the stairs, the cries of the baby bouncing off the walls and echoing around the house.
They dig in. Draco finds himself quite ravenous after another long day packaging manure. Prasad smears a bit of icing on their girlfriend’s face, and the ever-stoic Lin Walker cracks a smile. Amira challenges Harry to a game of Exploding Snap, and when Harry loses - which was most of the games they played - he laughs and laughs, his voice a miracle in the setting light.
Malfoy gives Harry a disapproving stare, clearly not convinced. “He sounded extremely upset.”
"Would Master like some breakfast?"
Amira’s platitudes, Prasad’s cautious jokes, Walker’s shoulder squeezes - they are stones to him, gray and lifeless. All of it falls away, like the husks of skin and dull scales he harvests from the dragon nests. Hollowed out, pale without blood thrumming beneath it, Draco does his job, and he does it damn well, but always, he remembers: Harry Potter, tilting his head in farewell. Harry Potter’s hands on the wheel, expertly backing out. Harry Potter’s car pulling off with the friends he chose, to his wife he chose, toward the future he chose.
When he cranes his head to look across the field, he sees the one with all of their wands, the student that Harry thought was going to beat him: Lucas. He's laying perfectly still, face up in the snow, staring at the sky. Malfoy jogs over and gives him a hand and the two and the rest of their team huddle around and smile and talk.
He shoots back, his words like a weapon, “Well maybe you fucking should have. When you and Ron came I was about to do it. I really was - I had a plan and-” He stops.
“Good morning everyone,” he greets the class when they step back in the room. He’s got his teacher voice on: kind, yet no-nonsense. “Today we’re continuing your projects, so please come up and pick up the books you used yesterday.” The students follows his directions and soon the sounds of focused research and conversation fill the classroom once again. Harry takes a seat next to Sophia and Lucas, as he did yesterday.
"How can I?" Robards all but roars. "It's probably thanks to this fucker that this circus has dragged on for so long." He rounds on Harry. "Did you know about this?"
There is a pause. Hagrid’s next words come softly - barely even audible.
It’s full dark when they begin to clean up and make for home. Up above, Draco hears the strong beating of wings - dragons returning home to rest. And from far off in the valley comes the hooting of the owls as they rise, only beginning their hunt.
“It’s okay,” he says, the defeat drenching his voice. “You should go back, it’s cold out.”
Harry snorts.
They are silent for a moment as Draco worries at his bottom lip.
To his complete surprise, Edwards burst into tears, and instead of struggling against his bonds, lies limply on the floor. Harry flounders.
“Hold on,” he turns back to his work, brow furrowed. “I need to finish these last few measures.”
“We’re here!” Someone from the front group calls out.
“That’s the point,” Malfoy says in response, but the clothes reappear on his body anyways.
Draco snaps the book shut and leans forward with interest. "Yes, how did you know? It's such a niche object - and rare too, due to the complicated spellwork done on it. To think it was just under my nose the whole time I was at Hogwarts..."
Draco has lost much of his patience for dramatics. “So why come here?”
He shuts up as soon as Kingsley lifts a finger to his lips. Harry's never seen him make the motion before, to anyone. Then, the Minister of Magic winks. "Don't tell my boss, would you?"
“Yes please! I’m hungry.”
At that moment, Belle walks out of the door and nearly runs into Draco.
“Malfoy, I don’t want you to sleep on the floor!”
“What?”
It's peaceful. Almost domestic.
“You’re not going to force me this time?”
“Because I told him I was gay,” Draco answers simply, without much emotion in his voice. “And he wants an heir more than anything.”
Mercifully, Malfoy cuts off Harry’s rambling: “Did….did you just ask me out, Potter?”
A flicker of movement draws his attention to the picture frame on his desk - the one of Hermione, Ron, and Harry during the charity gala - only when his eyes settle on it, he realizes that both Hermione and Ron seemed to have left the frame entirely. Picture-Harry swirls the champagne in his flute, his eyes darting around the hall. The warm smile usually resting easy on his features has gone, leaving only a nervous grimace in its place.
"Mm?" Harry takes off his robes and hangs them to dry on a chair. "Er, yeah."
“Nature has that kind of effect. It is unfortunate modern wizarding life is so…”
” Harry’s struggling - Malfoy’s legs are considerably longer than his, after all.
“...I don’t know what to tell you, mate.”
Draco falters, suddenly unarmed, but only for a moment. “Are you not tired?”
They stand silent, watching the patch of dirt for a long time. So long that even some of their most vigilant “fans” begin to droop on the other side of the iron bars.
In the shocked silence that follows, Harry swears he can hear the dust settling. (Not really though, as the children are all eating on noisily, paying no attention to the adults.) Harry shovels a forkful of green beans into his mouth to keep himself busy.
“Jenny, I appreciate your opinion on the matter.” She nods in acknowledgement. “But unfortunately, since the Second War, relations between the British Prime Minister and the Ministry have been...fraught. And even through the years, they haven’t recovered much. Some of you probably already know this.” Harry and Ron make eye contact. The only reason they know is because Kingsley accidently let it slip after one too many drinks at an Order of the Phoenix reunion once. Apart from them, the only ones in the room with recognition in their eyes are Jenny, Robards, and another senior Auror - who happens to be Jenny’s partner - Ash.
Two weeks later, it’s full-dark when a knock comes on Draco’s door. He sets his journal down and opens the door without looking through the glass.
Slowly, Harry nods, but says nothing. No longer does he trample through, thinking he can save Draco from himself with the force of his words alone. Now, he waits. And waits. And when he does touch the glass, the fragile petals at his feet, he does so how he touches all of Draco: like something beloved.
They reach the cafe from before, and a glance inside tells Harry that it’s just as quiet and empty as before. The barista notices them and gives them a slight wave.
“Here.” Suddenly, Harry’s not drowning in the couch, but in a flood of blankets.
He's not sure how much time has passed when his fireplace flashes green and Hermione steps out and marches up to Harry.
It sounds strange coming from a teenager.
Draco closes his eyes. “I commend you.”
. Harry slumps in his chair, exhausted all of a sudden.
Once he's fully on his feet, Draco walks over to Rose and bows his head. "My apologies. I don't think either one of us caught the Snitch this time."
“Welcome!” The barista calls, but Harry barely hears her. He’s searching the tables for blond hair and a disapproving frown. Harry is almost ten minutes late. But the cafe is mostly empty and Malfoy is nowhere to be seen.
He’s dressed in a simple black tuxedo this time - no sequins, no loud colors. Is Harry imagining things, or has he lost weight? The jut of his cheekbones seems sharper and his waist seems smaller.
Suddenly, Harry’s all choked up. He can’t fathom why. “...Thank you. Thank you, it’s more than I deserve. And yeah, it’s been...a lot.”
They stand on the edge of the nest for a long time, watching the eggs, unmoving like stones, and the slow rise and fall of their aunt’s chest. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco catches Weasley sliding his hand over Harry’s back, and inclining his head to speak something in his ear. Harry shakes his head and shrugs Weasley’s arm off.
hatred, layer over his vision like ice.
Luna follows close behind. "Your suit, as well."
Harry stares at it for a moment before taking it. “Thank you.” He hesitates. “How did you find this place?”
"A fly off..." Draco purses his lips, his brows scrunching up in thought. "Not a bad idea."
but she definitely knew what her sister was capable of. And she still took that risk letting her be around you.”
“I’m sorry about what I said.”
"Haha!" Malfoy shouts in triumph as he runs past him to man the fort. He sends another two snowballs at Harry while he's down, and they hit his gloved hand and his back.
“I’m…” Harry entertains the idea of lying, but he figures he’s in too much shit as is. “...here to help Hagrid around the castle.”
“What else Potter? I play with the children.” The light condescension in Malfoy’s tone sends a shiver down Harry’s spine. It brings back memories. The mug is back on the table now, but Malfoy’s finger lingers, tracing the rim. Harry stares at the movement as his mind turns over all the new information.
Sophia and Lucas are coming too - Sophia is Portkeying in from America, where she’s been wrangling their Magical Creature problem (though they call them ‘Cryptids’ over there) - and Lucas is just going to be walking down the street. He has it all planned out - he’s going to take time off Draco’s lab the day of, citing sickness, and then show up unannounced to celebrate.
His mother had responded, he was sure of it, but he no longer remembers what exactly she said. It doesn’t matter now. Because now, he understands.
Outside, through the window, snow falls.
For several, long moments, they don’t speak. Then:
Fantasies and dreams do nothing - like Harry said. They did nothing during the War, when Draco was caged in fear, and they do nothing now, when he is finally free.
“That’s what Mind Healers are for.”
Maybe it's the alcohol. Or maybe Harry's just a crazy bastard. But he opens his mouth again and says, "You know, I could say the same for you."
“But this is my dream,” Harry protests weakly.
Ron pats Harry on the shoulder. "You look good too, mate. Draco's going to be impressed."
After supper, as students and professors alike bid farewell before retiring for the night, Harry watches Malfoy slip away in the direction of the Slytherin common room. Harry follows behind him, trying to figure out what to say.
Harry laughs. "Hot chocolate, anyone?" The cold is really starting to seep through his clothes, and any kind of hot beverage sounds extremely attractive right now.
The report still wasn’t done by the time Robards popped in again on his way home, so he instructed Harry to stay late and get it done.
"Did anything happen after I left?"
Harry starts running too, but makes it a point to head straight for the smirking, blonde git. "I'll cover you!" He yells to his teammate.
(See the end of the chapter for
But still, one question burns a red line through Draco’s chest - the cinder cord that makes music out of every glance, every smile, every kind word Harry gives him. Draco opens his mouth, and sings it:
Harry tries to make friends with Draco, too, and quite incessantly. At every turn, Harry is there - offering Draco breakfast in the morning, helping him spell his bags back to their cabin after a trip. They settle into an uneasy rhythm: they wake up together, walk to work together, take turns cooking, and go to sleep together. When Harry goes out to buy groceries, he always comes back with a box of Draco’s favorite tea. And when Draco accidentally falls asleep in bed, with a book in his lap, he always wakes the next morning tucked in, with his reading glasses neatly folded atop his book - both set on the nightstand.
"His songs. They must follow his findings in his research. And they must have some kind of magical effect on people."
Kingsley closes the file in front of him and looks up. "Ah." He looks neither disappointed nor surprised. "Good, now we can begin. I believe there are two open seats right here." He gestures toward two seats near the front.
"I see," he murmurs. "And you said that your Ministry supports research into the connection between Muggles and Wizards?"
“I-uh. Huh?”
They sit, unspeaking, for several moments. Blood thrums in Draco, a rush in his hands and legs. The vial in his pocket - the one he grabbed in the half-dark, hours before - burns. He reaches in, and takes it out.
“Do you worry about attacks at all?”
“Er, yes please.” His earlier surge of nerves gone, Harry once again collapses on the couch.
and begins her speech as everyone is settling back in their seats. “Wow. I...I have no words.” She lifts up the medal and looks down at it.
“And Mother was, naturally, reminded of her sister. So she talked about her for a little bit.” A pauses. “And she said that she still loves Bellatrix. Even after everything, she still loves her.”
Longbottom doesn’t press the matter further, and the rest of the group barely get out a grunt of recognition at Draco’s words. Draco decides to spread his remaining material over the next -
Harry's reply leaves his desk in record time. When he's done, he cradles his wrist a little bit - it's cramped from writing so fast.
"Welcome back."
The crowd is quiet now, and expectant. Hermione reaches over and squeezes Harry's hand, but when he looks back at her, his face questioning, she avoids his gaze and trains her eyes instead on the stage.
A few hours pass, and the shadows outside deepen. One by one, Longbottom, Weasley, Thomas, Finnigan retire for the evening - the latter two pounding Draco on the back on their way out (the last game ended with Draco being the Old Maid).
Harry gives him a quizzical look. “Uh…”
Slowly, Longbottom approaches, takes the board, and begins writing and signing, talking through the logistics with Prasad, who hasn’t faltered for a single moment.
“That’s quite a ways away.”
“Your le-”
Sophia coils up - which vaguely reminds Harry of baseball, the muggle sport that he vaguely remembers is a favorite of Americans - and her arm lashes out almost like a whip, sending the snowball in a painful trajectory right into the head of the fort-builder who's already endured so much at her hands already.
“This isn’t a competition. Awful things happened to me, so I need help. Awful things happened to you, too, and so you also need help.”
As the rest of the department dutifully files out the door, conversation subdued as morale drops a little, Kingsley speaks up. "Harry."
A blond eyebrow quirks up and Malfoy’s face creases. “A resurgence. Of-”
“I don’t know how to swim,” Draco admits.
The vial, left on the table, pricks at him.
Draco lets himself smile, casts Impervious, and joins them.
, Harry fills in the blank for her.
At the request, Robards snaps out of whatever world of resentment and hatred his brain has run off to and quickly follows Kingsley out into the hall, heading toward the latter's office, Harry assumes. As soon as they leave, the mood of the room relaxes enormously, and the newbies begin chatting amiably as they also pick up and head for the door.
“Oh!” Harry grimaces. “Sorry, should have clarified. They got married last fall, remem-” He stops himself, and the rest of his sentence swings free.
Arthur chews, then swallows. "Just in passing, I think."
“Well, Draco?” Walker says, her arms folded and a slight smile on her face. “Make a wish.”
From the other corner, Molly speaks up, "Now, now, let the adults have Harry first."
Though Longbottom has filled out over the years, now both taller and broader than Draco, it seems old fears die hard. His guts twist when Longbottom practically cowers, and says, “I see.”
Suddenly, Harry realizes that he’s dreaming and it’s like he’s emerging, gasping, from a pool of vague dream-consciousness.
“Mr. Potter,” he greets him.
After putting their crup - a smiley pitbull christened Trent by Hagrid - to bed and fighting over the first shower before settling on taking one together, Draco and Harry are finally ready for bed.
heard a lot about him you dummy!”
“I’m glad I came back. I just wanted to tell you.”
Longbottom gapes. Thomas and Finnigan swivel around, checking the ground at their feet. Weasley looks to the peak with his brow drawn. Harry looks straight on, unfazed, at Draco.
It’s then that Harry realizes that he’s been so busy watching Draco that he hasn’t had more than a few bites to eat yet. Hurriedly, he stuffs some meat slices and potatoes in his mouth, chews, then swallows. “It’s pretty good, actually. I like it.” He isn’t even lying.
“It’s been so long, and I’d practically forgotten about it anyways…”
They often speculate about Harry's role in the entire ordeal: a spy? a mediator? a leader? a lead investigator? The theories run as wild as they want them to and the public snaps it all up; the first issue of the Prophet that broke the news was almost impossible for anyone to get their hands on, it ran out of print that quickly.
Harry’s head is swimming, and his body feels like an anchor. “I-uh-sure? Where is he sleeping?”
“Do they have a specific motive?”
Draco swats Harry’s arm. “Shush. You’re not the one who’s giving the keynote address.”
Silence settles for a moment as Harry stirs his cold coffee and resolutely refuses to meet Malfoy’s eyes, the ones that Harry can feel searching his face. The barista comes and places a coffee and a sandwich in front of Malfoy. He tears it in half and offers it to Harry. It looks to be of the ham variety. “Hungry?”
“Happy birthday, Draco,” Amira says warmly, rolling over to rest a hand on his arm. “Come, we made you something.”
They don't say much more, and just resume looking and listening on as Draco plays into the night.
“It’s okay. Really. I should be the one saying sorry.”
Draco looks over, and almost starts at the look on Harry’s face. Open, serious, pointed like an arrow towards Draco.
Malfoy doesn’t budge and instead continues to breath heavily directly into Harry’s ear - he can even feel his fluttering heartbeat where he’s pressing his chest to Harry’s back.
Ginny kisses her again, holding it a little longer this time. "I love you." It's a whisper, clearly only meant for Luna to hear, but Harry can't help but to catch it anyways. Tugging on his tie and needlessly adjusting it, he pretends to be too preoccupied to hear.
In the end, Malfoy leads his students to his living quarters for hot chocolate. They ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ at his place, even though it's fairly plain and modest. For some reason, seeing eight teenagers piled on the couch Harry had crashed on earlier in the week is a strange sight.
“Hm.” Malfoy turns his head and regards the world out the window. The snow has stopped, but plenty of it remains on the ground in icy piles. Harry prepares himself for flat, resolute rejection, but it never comes. “Okay,” Malfoy decides, “But it’s Muggle, so be careful what you say. They don’t know the whole story of the War - or even that there was a war at all. To them, terrorists killed their parents.”
Blood drains from Harry’s face, and a quick glance over to Malfoy sitting at the end of the table confirms that he’s similarly pale. The insinuation has caught them off guard - especially since it’s completely plausible. The line between exercise-induced exhaustion and sexual debauchery is very fine indeed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco takes some of the supplies, and Harry juggles the rest while still trying to change out of his pajamas. When they open the door, it is indeed Walker on the other side, the set of her shoulders tense.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Must be quiet lately.”
Draco tilts his head back.
"I knew you wanted to do it." The blonde briefly looks back at him with one eyebrow raised and a smirk playing on his lips. "I know how competitive you are."
For the rest of the Ministry, it's just a regular Tuesday. The statue-fountain of the 'Golden Trio' gurgles freely and the receptionist practically breaks his hand waving at Harry and trying to get his attention, like always. When he steps off on the Auror Department's level, however, is when hell breaks loose.
“How did you know?”
“Fine.”
In his trainee days, Harry had imagined his future life with the Aurors vividly. There would be danger, the stakes would be high - it wouldn't phase him because that's all he's known his entire life. He wouldn't want to start out at a high level due to his name - no, he wanted to earn a position as a leader. He’d envisioned twirling in his scarlet robes, firing spell after spell from his wand. He’d envisioned himself dashing through the alleys, getting mud all over his boots, and taking down a suspect. He’d envisioned himself grabbing a beer with friends after closing a hard case and going home to Ginny and his children and falling asleep feeling warm and wanted.
“Can I sit in on class again today?
Harry starts, and turns to look at Draco, his eyes wide. “What?”
Once they finish collecting all the books, Malfoy bundles up again and they head out together. “So, what did you think?”
Harry knows he’s lucky to have them.
They walk in silence for a little bit. Up ahead, the rest of the class are chatting animatedly with Malfoy. Sophia is with them, but every now and then she’ll glance back at Lucas and Harry.
He thinks, half ready to tear his hair out in frustration at his own idiocy. He briefly considers owling Hermione an apology, but decides better of it. It wouldn't be worth anything anyways. And he's afraid that making amends would just be inviting her to poke her nose into his life again, which he can't have. She can't see me like this, he thinks, reveling in the coolness of his desk against his forehead.
“Draco,” she says.
The men sit in their awe for a long time. Watching the bruising sky, pointing to the hashed lines of exposed rock - so clear to them, now, that they are scars of long settled battles. They ask Draco if the other mountains are dragons, as well. He says:
A sigh of relief from Thomas, “Thank the Lord.” He sets down the cooler he’s been carrying by hand.
Harry is sitting on a small stretch of stone peeking from the grass, and Draco joins him so they’re sitting shoulder to shoulder, facing the vastness before them.
When Harry steps out the door and kicks off, what was only a slight, playful breeze on the ground becomes a full blown windstorm high in the air. Even with all the visibility-enhancing charms on the broom and his glasses, Harry can barely see past the tip of his nose. But still Harry flies on, hunched over his broom and casting
“What? What are you saying?”
Harry can tell that he and Draco have the same thought at the same time, from the looks of the blush tinting the blonde’s cheeks.
“It smells - and looks - divine.” Draco comments, taking his seat.
“A co-worker recommended me.” Malfoy is still smiling.
“Good morning Professor!” They intone almost in unison. A few of them also greet Harry, albeit shyly.
Any argument left in him seems to die in Harry’s throat. He swallows it down, and his eyes bear into Draco’s with such heated intensity that something inside him thaws under the pressure. The melt collects, and drops to the earth.
While moving his knight, Draco complains, “Teddy’s become too smart for his own good - that’s what happened.”
Draco waits. Again, he is quite good at it.
"Yeah."
A familiar blonde man groans from under him.
“Isn’t she cold? Isn’t it dangerous?” Longbottom asks with a frown.
Even Arthur gets in on this. “And that is?” There’s nothing malicious behind his question, and none of the Weasley’s look angry either.
Mouth gaping, Robards tries to protest, "But Kingsley! That's not what-"
Malfoy takes in a deep breath and puffs out his chest, perhaps in an effort to make himself look less like a man who just sprinted through the halls of a castle to make breakfast. Harry makes no such effort and simply steps forward and opens the door.
Harry glares at him. “I can walk back, just cast an Impervious.” Apparently, he had left his own wand in his cottage.
Fleur sighs and combs her fingers through her long blonde hair. Throughout all the years that Harry's known her, he swears that she hasn't aged a day. Especially after signing her modeling contract a few years ago, she seems to grow even more beautiful every year. "Bill woke up in the middle of ze night to throw up."
The two men walk to the door and Malfoy sees him out. The last thing Harry sees before the door swings shut is Malfoy’s face: tired and full of shadows.
Malfoy throws his hands up in frustration. “He was angry! It’s the right thing to do?! I don’t know! If you don’t want to fix your relationship, then nevermind! Forget I asked.” He speeds up.
"Go."
“Did everyone else get home okay?”
"I know, I know." In hindsight, it might not have been the smoothest move, but Draco seems to have enjoyed himself regardless, and that's the ultimate goal, right? Maybe Harry is just trying to blindly justify himself.
But now, when he looks around, he sees through Harry’s eyes: the rock paths worn smooth by both ancient and modern feet, the grass and brush and forests cultivated by unknown hands. The mountains that used to take to the sky. The river down below, and how it ebbs and flows even over the span of a week.
“So, what made you want to be an Auror?”
"Okay, okay. Basically, we’ve been hanging out all this week while he’s been teaching his class and he didn’t have any other plans for Christmas so it just...happened. Sorry for not giving you all an earlier notice."
The classroom is silent. Even the students outside have moved farther away, making their voices no longer audible. Harry can’t bear to look at Malfoy right now, but he doesn’t hear him move or react in any way.
"To a degree. I primarily use that and Muggle physics as a basis for my research." Draco takes a sip from his glass of water.
Andromeda smiles. “Are you nervous?”
Draco’s smile wavers. "N-no. I don't think so. I mean, I'm not sure yet what will happen in the future, but for now I just want to focus on finishing up my research."
- as if compassion is a currency to be squabbled over.
Wait-no! I didn-”
Friday afternoon, after the students’ presentations of their final papers - Sophia and Lucas doing especially well, at least in Harry’s opinion - Harry and Malfoy agree to a class snowball fight as a celebration of the course’s success. Also because the students asked so politely, clearly eager to spend as much time as possible with Malfoy before he leaves.
The Lake is quiet. No birds, who have wisely decided to travel South, and no students - not even any wind. The only movement is the falling snow and the sun moving across the sky. Oh, and of course, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter skating across the ice.
“It used to bother me a lot, but now I’m okay with it. I didn’t see it at the time, but Dumbledore was right. I could’ve still turned away from the prophecy, if I wanted to, but I didn’t. And that was my choice.” Harry takes a deep breath. “There’s one thing, though, that still bothers me.”
“That’s...good.” Harry doesn’t know what he expected. He vaguely knew that the Malfoy name hasn’t been the same since the War - and likely won’t ever be the same again - but he never bothered to stay up to date on the status of Lucius or Draco or even Narcissa, who save his life and, really, the entire Wizarding world, during the War. He feels guilty for it now;
"Bloody hell. What's happened?" Not that Harry really cares anymore. He's mostly just annoyed that his non-plans of laying in bed and feeling sorry for himself all day have been ruined.
He catches a little from sitting in on the meetings - small attacks, kidnappings keep happening in the London area, but there haven't been any fatalities yet, the Aurors have caught some of the group's members, but none of the higher-ranking ones. The Muggle Prime Minister has been warned and Jenny, Ash, and Kingsley are currently formulating a defense plan with them.
No cheers. The audience is eating up his dramatic pause, waiting for him to open his mouth again and continue.
"Excellent. And you?" Belle turns her attention onto Harry, her dark eyes glittering much like Ava's had been.
Over forty minutes past their scheduled time. His teeth gritted, Draco gets out, “They are.”
It doesn’t help that Harry is one of only two people of color working there - the other being Kingsley, but the literal Minister of Magic has his own responsibilities to take care of and can’t micromanage the actions of individual Aurors.
“Merlin.”
8:47AM. Does Malfoy sleep in on Saturdays?
!" His wand soars toward Harry in an arc, and he catches it with his free hand. "
Edwards swallows. "O-okay. So I said yes. I joined them. I was supposed to be their spy."
Draco watches the flames. It’s dark now. In the summer months, all the croaking, squeaking creatures would be emerging and singing their songs, but it’s still winter, and the night air is cold and silent save for the crack of the fire and Draco’s own heartbeat - a living thing in his chest.
The ceiling is vaulted and high, making the small living space - a living room, kitchen, bed, and bath - seem larger than it is. The living room consists of one long, burgundy couch with a silvery pattern sewn in, a gray rug, and a small coffee table with a dozen or so books stacked on it. Harry plops down on the couch after entering, but not before putting the books away in the bookcase in the corner.
And a few minutes of walking through the Ministry, ducking his head whenever anyone passes by to avoid conversation, Harry’s settled in his office chair again, in his empty cubicle. His desk is just as messy as he left it when he dashed off to dinner at Andromeda’s the Friday before last.
“Jesus.”
Hagrid’s hut has remained mostly unchanged, but next to it now stands a larger hut: Gawp’s place. Gawp comes and goes, never really able to decide between the Forest and the hut, but he always retreats into the Forest in the winter -
“Harry, did you not know?” Molly asks.
“Have you given what I said a week ago some thought? About getting help?”
“Yes, I did. Though it was not in my lesson plan for today.”

Enjoy!
of water on grass, water on rock, water on the snaking rivers. In the summer, Draco sits on the hillsides and lets the world crowd in.
Rubbing his side, he rolls his eyes. "We didn't sneak off. I went to put him to bed. And we were both too drunk for that, anyways."
Outside, the moon shows its face to Harry. Its light creeps through Draco’s window and touches him too, a silver afterthought.
Draco takes his hand, a tender anchor. He opens his mouth and surprises himself, “Yes. Yes, I think so.”
The couch is not long enough to accommodate Draco, he knows this, but he persists. “I will find something. Just, go.”
“Don’t worry, Draco. Take off your pack already and relax. Might as well.” They shuffle some papers into the file cabinet behind them. “Mint?” They gesture at the bowl full of them.
“Yeah. Are you alright?”
not a ‘song’.”
“You made the same excuse for me,” Draco says. “That I was young.”
The orphanage itself seems to be a repurposed house, complete with faded marks where furniture or picture frames used to exist. Normally, the house would be too cramped to hold this many children, but the lack of proper furniture allows for more room. It seems the main expenses in the orphanage are, from the look of the enormous fridge and the toys scattered everywhere: food and toys.
“Even better than Uncle Harry?”
So they hurry, levitating the supplies halfway, then opting to carry them by hand. Though human lives are short, dragon memories live on, and they remember what magic has brought unto their kind. Even bringing out a wand in their presence is enough to scatter them into the sky, soaring and skittish.
Blinking slowly, Lucas says, “...Yes. You’re right. Sorry.” They resume their task of combing through the books, half-teaching themselves Muggle physics and half-researching proof for the theories they began to formulate about music and magic at the end of yesterday’s class.
“Don’t forgive Dudley.”
"Yes - I just needed to pick up my pay from McGonagall. Care to walk with me?" As he's in the process of saying that and fiddling with his sleeve cuffs, he glances up and sees the mistletoe hanging innocuously above his head.
Harry only knows because he's resubscribed to all the outlets. It's an act of self-destruction, he's keenly aware of this, but he can't help himself.
He stands tall among the students and talks to them with a tone of confidence that Harry can hear even from far away, though he can't catch the individual words.  Harry supposes that Malfoy has always been a natural leader; his gang of Slytherins only ever listened to him back in the day, an accomplishment that none of the professors or even Dumbledore could claim.
“Encouraging.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"So?!"
Ava grins sympathetically at him. "Yep, sorry, but he's never mentioned any Harrys either. Sometimes he talks about his Mum, but that's only after either me or Belle ask after her. But she’s never come to his shows - not as far as I know."
“I asked Charlie,” Harry admits. “Charlie Weasley. He-uh-works with dragons too.”
Harry gives Draco's chest a light push. "Shut up, wanker."
Harry would think that stage lights would make Draco look even paler, more gaunt, but it's doing quite the opposite. The light gives him a healthy glow; it dances on his high, prominent cheekbones, slides down the bridge of his nose, and graces the hint of collarbone peeking out of the window formed by the unbuttoned top buttons of his black collared shirt underneath his suit jacket. When Draco beams at the ocean of faces - his audience - he almost literally glows. It could be a subtle magical effect, and Harry doesn't doubt that it's well within Draco's magical capabilities, but Harry doubts it for some reason. It seems real. Natural. Harry can't explain it.
“Oh Harry, you’re here!” Hermione walks out from the kitchen and scoops Rose up. “Sorry about that. Rose, be nice.”
Though his behavior catches Harry off guard, he takes the slice anyways and murmurs his thanks before taking a bite. He’s right. It
“I’m pregnant.”
“Er-yes.” He adds quickly, “It’s alright, this was my fault, so I apologize. I didn’t plan for enough time for us to catch up and I have to be somewhere soon.”
“Since the trials?”
“Fantastic. Then you’re okay with me choosing one for us?”
Harry knows that the show will start soon. And he knows that his friends and family are waiting on their drinks. But he still takes a seat at the bar, promising himself that he won't stay too long.
He would laugh if his heart didn't feel so heavy. He doesn't know what he'll do without Draco. He had foolishly gotten his hopes up, gotten ahead of himself; there were times when Harry envisioned himself growing old with Draco. Adopting a crup together. Merlin, he even had a name picked out for it.
"Thank you Audrey, you're too sweet." Molly says while beaming at her. Every since the first time they met, Molly has been her biggest fan. Harry remembers, with some amusement, a conversation he overheard between Molly and Percy once when he was dating her, which really just consisted of Molly threatening him: "Percival, you better not mess this one up, or I will have several choice words."
Belle immediately moves away and gestures toward their table, her smile gracious. "Oh please, go ahead."
“Lake Traws is not a natural lake,” Draco explains as they kayak across its surface, riddled with raindrops. “Muggles designed this, filled it, to be their water source.”
“I’m trying, you-”
He reappears at the gate of Andromeda’s house; it seems smaller in the dark and cold, its cobbled bricks and gently sloped roof vague outlines in the night. Harry draws his robes closer to his body and walks down the path to the front door. The sitting room light is on, and Harry can hear piano music through the walls. Andromeda must have charmed the instrument again. She likes a bit of background noise while she knits by the fire.
Harry pries his eyes open again. By the soft glow of the lamp, he can pick out the gray hairs that have cropped up on Draco’s head recently. He feels his body, which is softer now - less angular. He sees the wrinkles on Draco’s neck.
“Are you going to be here for the rest of the week?” Sophia asks while opening up the physics textbook.
"I just-I just think it's so funny that, as soon as I start going into work on time, I bust the case wide open. Completely by accident!" He snickers into Draco's shoulder. "What is this, a movie? A book?"
Draco, in the face of all this information, simply raises an eyebrow. "That's very...interesting. And the secret is safe with me, I assure you."
Things are really /heating up/ eh? Too soon?
” He makes a point to make direct eye contact with her. “I’m fine. There. Happy?”
Harry feels as though Malfoy isn’t going to sell him out anytime soon, surprisingly. The Harry Potter from ten years ago could never have imagined this. “I don’t mind, particularly, no.”
Harry manages a weak laugh before grabbing an empty wine bottle hidden in the corner. It'll have to do, he thinks with a grimace. After spelling some water in it and setting the flowers in the makeshift vase, he makes his way back to Draco.
He takes a deep breath. “You know that I went to visit Mother on Saturday.”
The adrenaline takes a while to settle in his veins; it's been several years since his last, real date, and the stakes are even higher since it's with Draco Malfoy. Once his heart is beating at its regular rate, Harry feels his earlier enthusiasm slip away. Sure, he may have a date tomorrow night, but he's still here, sitting in his chair in his cramped, gray office, working a sham job. He checks the time and groans when it tells him that he still has several hours left to waste away.
Harry whips his head back around to look at Draco. The blonde is still playing, with what seems to be a slight smile on his face. But there's nothing to indicate that he's casting a spell.
Paper airplane memos are so thick in the air that they regularly collide with each other and fall to the ground briefly before taking off again, more crumpled than before. Everywhere Harry looks there's a flash of red - someone's robes - as they dash from cubicle to cubicle, round corners with frightening speed, and sprint down the hall with bundles of files cradled in their arms. There's a distinct coffee stain on the carpet to the right of the elevator that no one's bothered to clean up, even though it's only a simple swish and flick of the wand. For the first time since Harry's begun working in the department, not a single person greets him as he walks past toward his cubicle. Not a single person even spares him a glance - they're too busy completely immersed in their files, in their enchanted maps, in discussing strategy with their team members. Harry wonders if this was what the department was like during the Wizarding Wars.
“How could Mother still love her? I just don’t understand.”
Harry deflects his barrage of questions a little. “Are you interested in becoming an Auror?”
But Ron has known him for long enough to know when Harry's bullshitting him. He just frowns disapprovingly at him and sighs. "You know I can't hide this from her. Not after what happened last time. I promised her."
The children seem okay on the surface - covered from head to foot in soot and ash and dressed in slightly tattered pajamas, sure, but okay.
“I’m proud of you,” Harry says, the last part of his sentence getting muffled as he presses his mouth to Draco’s still-wet cheek.
“Summer is our peak time.”
“It must be hard…” Longbottom trails off.
Above, Draco and its coils shine, unmoving.
There. They climb a particularly high dune, and once Longbottom reaches the top, he gasps and flings out his arm to hold the rest back. Finnigan gapes and Thomas clutches his husband’s arm, whispering furiously in his ear and pointing. Weasley’s jaw drops. Harry adjusts his glasses and squints.
She doesn’t get angry, just sits onto the couch beside him and lays a gentle, warm hand on his shoulder. “Are you okay?”
Letting out a breathy laugh, Malfoy states, completely monotone, “You look like shit.”
With a few minutes to spare, Harry apparates over and runs down Ravel Avenue toward The Amber Tap. He quickly realizes that he should have lined up earlier.
Another pause. “Fine.” Gravel crunches and there’s a
Ginny reaches over and squeezes her hand, smiling. "I second that. You never seemed that way in Hogwarts, at least.”
"What the fuck are you doing?"
Their conversation lulls and Harry’s mind races, desperate to keep it flowing. Flakes of snow are still raining down outside, and streams of people tightly bundled in their winter coats flow down the sidewalk, right in front of the window Harry and Malfoy are sitting at. The barista is wiping down the counter while humming a little tune to herself.
Draco breathes deeply, and nods.
“Ron, er, I’m gonna catch up with them - I just thought of a question.”
Hermione clears her throat, and everyone's attention immediately snaps to her. "Everyone, I have an announcement to make."
Everyone nods their heads.
Harry disarms him before Edwards can do anything else. "
“That was excellent work, Draco,” Amira says, warmly.
"Harry?" It's Ron. He stops outside the door and knocks. If it were Hermione and she were coming to check up on him because he skipped work, the door would have flown off the hinges by now. And this isn't merely conjecture - it has precedent. Spelling the pieces of the door back together is more difficult than it should be, mostly because all the splinters of wood are hard to find back.
"It's the truth! If she was upset then...that's her problem."
A scoff. “It was obvious, mate. At Hogwarts during break? You two were inseparable.”
“That’s all we wanted to say,” Prasad says, cheeriness filling their round face once more. “Happy birthday!” They file out, and leave the door open. From the sitting room, Draco hears Harry compliment Amira’s cloak.
Draco’s explanation of some of the theory is interesting - but not really because of the subject matter itself. Harry has never been particularly musically inclined, anyways. In fact, he's never really had a favorite singer or band in his life. He rarely even listens to music at all. When he met up with Dudley a few years ago, just to catch up and make amends, his cousin offered to buy him a popular Muggle music player - out of guilt or whatever else, Harry doesn't know - but Harry ultimately turned him down and the two ended up just grabbing lunch at a pricey Muggle restaurant. He wouldn't have any use for it, and he didn't foresee ever finding a use for it. Ginny mostly likes the mainstream Wizard artists, and she used to play them in the house all the time when they were married, but Harry got used to tuning them all out.
“Already? You don’t know their gender yet.”
Silence descends as everyone watches Malfoy who, seemingly oblivious to the pressure, flexes his wrist and runs his fingers up and down the keyboard. When he’s done, his hands fall on his lap, and he stills for a moment before laying his hands on the keys again and beginning to play.
“Great.” The door clicked shut. Harry heaved a great sigh.
The mountains, the rivers, the sea - all these places that have and will always exist - will take him in, and at least one part of Draco will last.
Ion nods to confirm. "The Wizarding community there is very accepting toward Muggles. And their technologies." He digs around in his pocket and pulls out a small flip phone. When he flips it open, the screen lights up, but instead of numbers on the buttons, there are only letters. "Instead of Portkeys now, we use this. Type in any location, and you will go there. Perfect for those who can't apparate, like me."
“Do you know french?”
Draco allows himself to be led to the kitchen, where a lopsided cake sits on the table, smeared with white icing, and topped with an icing serpent that’s been charmed to weave through the candles. He looks back at his coworkers.
The door opens and Ron strides in, dressed in his red Auror robes. It must be his lunch break already, Harry realizes, if he has enough time to come and visit.
. Our first priority right now is to secure the safety of the victims - Muggle orphans - and to thoroughly investigate the scene.”
- the Auror department’s number one priority, and it shouldn’t ever matter again whether or not they’re Muggle or magical.” Jenny snaps at that, and the two intertwine their hands at the table.
The students stifle laughter and stare at Malfoy, awaiting his answer.
Though his parents were fond of trips in his childhood - taking him to see French chateaus, the ancient sites of Egypt, the golden temples in Thailand - they had only taken him to the ocean once. The Mediterranean, during their trip to Italy when Draco was very young - young enough to only remember a single image: looking over the rocks, stacked to his feet, at that impossible blue.
"Time's up!" Stella calls to the other team. Malfoy signals for his team members to stop talking and walks over.
not 2 be banned from ao3 or anything but.... ACAB, fuck c*ps, and abolish I** No I will not be taking any bad faith arguments. Google is free.
They are silent and unmoving for one, loaded moment before: “Fine.” Draco says, ducking out of the door frame and out of Harry’s range. “If you don’t want to tell me, that’s fine, I apologize for being so intrusive.”
Longbottom and Finnigan laugh, and when Weasley lets out a huffing snore, they laugh even harder.
“When did-” When Harry begins talking, he grimaces, realizing that his mouth tastes of vomit. “When did I get here?”
“Like being a Death Eater.”
The woman drops his credit card and disappears under the bar, scrambling to find it again. She pops back up within a few seconds, and a lock of hair has escaped from her hijab. While tucking it back under the fabric, she asks Harry, wide-eyed, "You know him? Personally? Do you work at the orphanage?"
"I know. I've been there. But I never knew they had
Waiting a bit before answering, Malfoy turns his head slightly to regard Harry out of the corner of his eye. Harry shivers. “It’s a Clementi Sonatina. And it’s a
One fifteen hour flight later and I'm safely in China! Hope you enjoyed this chapter.
Harry realizes,
His feet has a mind of its own. Harry protests, tries to leave the room, but he ends up on the bed and in Draco’s arms anyways. His pale, bare, exposed chest stares at Harry, taunting him.
"Two," Kingsley continues, "we're currently in the process of working with the Muggle Prime Minister on a precautionary plan that will prioritize Muggle and Muggleborn safety, especially for those who are nonwhite. Jenny and Ash are leading this project and are in talks with top Muggle officials at this moment; they don't need additional help right now, but that may be subject to change as we confirm details and construct a solid plan. I will keep you updated."
- week, so they walk without uttering a single word to each other for the rest of the way.
He tries to go back to sleep, he really does, but the thought that Harry is somewhere on the other side of the wall, breathing and awake at the exact same time, jolts his body with energy.
“Mountains, rivers, the sea...You have it all.”
“Well. I will give that ‘congratulations’ to you, then.” Draco pauses. “Are you still hungry?” He asks, nodding to his bag.
Draco laughs and rolls on his side so he can look at Harry full-on. His blonde hair has come out of its usual position and falls on his forehead, over his eyes. “Kidding. You’re so cute when you’re embarrassed.”
Shoving his wand in his coat pocket, Harry turns to Ron and says, "Ready?"
"How's the shop going?" Harry asks him.
Draco bursts into tears.
In the background, Teddy makes a face. Andromeda sees and chuckles.
Malfoy’s blushing. He’s turning increasingly redder by the second and his voice rises an octave higher: “Well I….certainly don’t think that’s a
"But you definitely shattered them all." Harry waves his hand at the emptying tables and chairs. "Did you see them all standing and clapping for you?"
Harry places his other foot on the ice, which elicits a squeal from Malfoy. His hands feel pleasantly warm on Harry’s stomach. “I’m on the ice now.”
“Wait,” Harry catches Draco’s arm before his cup reaches his mouth, “How many have you had?”
A bit annoyed with himself for not thinking forward enough, Harry begrudgingly joins the back of the line and sinks into his coat, seeking warmth.
“Naturally. I suspect Amira has a hand-”
Harry and Draco getting along.
"I know! He seems almost rehabilitated now!"
“I want to.”
He manages not to be embarrassed again, and instead dons a conceited and all-too-familiar smirk. "Jealous?"
As they’re trudging through the snow-covered grounds, heading towards a suitable location, Lucas approaches Harry.
“I see.”
They separate and Ginny wastes no time in holding her hand out to Ma-Draco. "Nice to see you again, Malfoy."
“Actually…there’s been an uptick. A resurgence.”
“Potter.”
"Tired?"
“When did you get over it?”
Harry thinks.
She hugs him. "That's okay! I'm so glad you're okay."
“Yeah, of course. And not really. Even if I don’t understand the topic, I could at least organize them or something,” he finishes lamely.
"It's the afternoon now," he snaps, "I'm here instead of taking my lunch break. So you better talk."
Laughing, Draco lightly punches Harry on the shoulder in retaliation. "Wanker."
Molly sighs and looks wistful. "Young love. I do hope they invite us to the wedding."
“We’re gay. I mean I’m gay. Technically bisexual. Fuck. I shouldn’t have outed her-” Harry’s mouth snaps shut when he sees the expression on Draco Malfoy’s face.
“Draco.”
“Yes.” Draco closes his eyes. “I know you are still friends.”
Another round of cheers come, and Harry swears passerbys outside the walls can l hear the thunderous applause.
“Bed time?”
Unfortunately, it looks like Harry’s several year long-streak of successfully avoiding Neville will end soon. He tries to channel the sudden shaking of his hands into sipping his tea and petting Cane, whose eyes are getting droopy.
He watches Draco carefully - watches his gleaming hair falling in waves onto his forehead and neck, the way his knuckles bend, his polished dress shoe reflecting light as it periodically presses the pedal underneath the piano. The line of his shoulders was tense before, but relaxed now, allowing him a freedom of movement as he plays. At times, Harry even spies a small smile playing at his lips after a particularly fast series of notes.
"Merry Christmas!" Roxanne, Angelina and George's youngest daughter, beams up at him, her curly hair dashed this way and that across her forehead. "Did you get me something this year?"
"Who's the team captain?" He asks once he's within earshot.
in the first place. Lucas may be mature - at least from what Harry’s seen - but he’s no less naive about the world than Harry was at his age, or anyone else for that matter.
"Wha-" He stops and stares at the unassuming, unmarked package. "You didn't have to. I didn't get anything for you."
He shivers as the wind blows over them - the warming charms are wearing off, and the night is settling in. Spring, he had named the teasing warmth, but he was foolish and too optimistic: winter hasn’t released its grip upon the world quite yet.
Harry nods, heart in his throat.
The afternoon sun peeks out from behind a few clouds. His mood drops when he realizes he has work in the morning, but soars higher than before when he remembers he’s having dinner with Hermione, Ron, and Rose in a few hours and falling asleep in Draco’s arms a few more hours after that.
There's a brief lull in their conversation as everyone watches Draco and the kids interact. Like he's a new toy himself, the children are obsessed with him, asking him to play, to watch, to speak.
"You look good, Hermione," Luna says as she and Ginny stand and walk over. The two share a hug.
"Weeks. Probably two months."
Harry closes his eyes, and the mundane thoughts disappear as his consciousness slips away for the night.
“I’ll owl you,” he promises, cringing internally at what this looks like. He hopes the barista isn’t paying attention anymore.
The next day and a half pass quickly and Harry and Malfoy fall into a sort of routine. They sit at breakfast together, go to class together, and hang out in Malfoy’s living quarters at night - grading assignments, shooting the shit, talking until late. It’s nice, Harry thinks. He wonders if this is how it could have been all this time - even before the War.
“You did great!”
“I’ve never been so close to that many adults before!” Prasad exclaims, their face open with awe.
Snow has begun to fall slowly - just a few snowflakes here and there. Both men slow down to enjoy the view.
“...Fine,” Harry concedes, however unwillingly.
Glancing at each other nervously, Harry and Draco obey, though it is indeed a squeeze.
The rest of the afternoon passes with similar conversations - sometimes technical as the students interrogate Malfoy on his research, sometimes meaningless and playful banter. The only awkward moment was when Stella asked Malfoy, "Do you have someone special in your life right now?" To which Malfoy answered, albeit after a coughing fit and an obvious blush, "No-! Not that it's any of your business as my students."
"It seems that fate always gives you the most pivotal role. Even when you've done nothing to deserve it."
The woman stands and sighs. “A break for me, I guess.” She turns, sees Harry, and gasps. “Oh, I’m
Subtly, Harry uses some magic to help him slow Rose down. The pair walk back to Grimmauld house, and Harry Floos them back to her house.
"Is it your first time here?" She asks conversationally while punching his information into the computer.
“Y-yes.”
“Spotty.”
Harry’s voice is so soft that Draco doesn’t want to look at him.
“I lasted until the day of the wedding. I thought I could do it.” Harry’s voice is torn, raw. “Then I remembered what you said. About not wanting to disappoint anyone.”
The tallest one, maybe a girl of about seventeen refocuses the attention on Malfoy, “How’d your performance go?”
“Wait.”
The articles themselves, Harry reads in earnest down to every last sentence. He has nothing better to do after all, just sitting alone in his office as his coworkers apparate in and out trying to save Muggles and Muggleborn people.
Finally, they reach the wide double doors of the Great Hall and stop outside to collect themselves.
Molly shrugs and keeps her eyes focused on her knitting.
Night falls away and the sun comes up for breath once more, but Draco barely notices its pink light.
“My mother has the rest of him. I haven’t spoken to her in a long time. I don’t-” Draco falters for a moment, but pushes on. “-I don’t know what to say.”
“Two whiskeys, right?”
idea, necessarily, But um.” He pauses. “Isn’t it strange for the….the f-first date to be a family Christmas?”
"Draco, catch."
She does - her broad palms are a comforting weight. She doesn’t break eye contact.
"Hey."
“Bloody hell,” Harry says, his voice a little muffled by the sweater he’s pulling over his head. It’s his favorite one - a nice cream color with red stripes. Harry throws his robes over it and pulls on a pair of his trusty bootcuts.
But it’s still strange; Draco hasn’t slept with another person in a long time. Apparently, living in one of the most remote places in the Isles is not a quality people look for in a partner. Everything - the extra rhythm of breaths, the sharing of the sheets, the radiating warmth - feels out of place in Snowdonia, a place Draco has only experienced alone for half a decade.
Malfoy laughs often, making the corners of his eyes crinkle up. And when he looks over at Harry without any masks, without any guards, Harry looks back.
“Don’t hesitate,” she says.
“They all came out so healthy - I guess we were worried over nothing,” Dr. Khanyile muses.
"It's the newest one, and I thought it would help the paperwork go faster."
"I-I'm sure? I don't know what you all are talking about..." Harry trails off. He must be missing something here, or maybe it's the hangover that's messing everything up for him, but he is completely at a loss.
“Gentlemen, you are seated on the arm of the most ancient dragon of the Isles: Glyder Fawr, the Greatest Ancestor, the Eternal Dreamer.”
His Mind Healer told him during their first session together - after Harry spent thirty minutes hashing out, then backtracking through his own memories - “You love them, Harry, I can see that from the way you keep trying to protect them. But the truth is, I’m not here to pass judgement on what they did. That has to come from you. My job is to make you feel safe enough to do so.”
With a pinch of powder and the roar of the flame, they're gone, on their way to the Ministry.
ass, he sighs in defeat. “Okay, fine.”
Working there is hard. Ron commiserates with Harry and is a good ally - regularly calling his fellow Aurors out on their bullshit - but actually changing minds in the department seems like a hopeless prospect. Fixing the system from the inside is - and always has been - utter bullshit.
And Harry can tell Robards is seeing them too. They both know that they’ve entered dangerous waters now; neither can divulge too much about Harry’s current professional state, as the media still believes that Harry is a successful, brave, high-ranking Auror. If any evidence of the contrary comes to light, especially during an already stressful time for the Ministry, Harry’s day-to-day life would once again become a literal battleground - just as he was immediately after the War and his divorce.
Hours of light banter with Ginny, Luna, Hermione, and Ron and impromptu and highly unorganized flying lessons later, Harry's trying to get ready for Draco's performance. Keyword: trying.
They’re swerving into potentially dangerous territory now. Harry tries his best to steer them back onto the right track. “You said you perform regularly now, right? At the jazz club?”
They fall asleep like that, on the soft moss that grows between the scales of Glyder Fawr, face to face, holding hands.
good - juicy and tender.
"You think you can outsmart me, Potter?"
“Don’t. I told you not to pity me.”
Sometimes, their coworkers join them: Prasad, chattering and joking away, Walker, softly laughing, and Amira, touching her hand to Draco’s and smiling. If they notice any change, they don’t name it, but Draco sees the tenderness in the looks they give him. Or maybe that tenderness was always there, and now he finally knows to look.
as if working closely with a War orphanage for years is something that
Another sound, a rumbling, like a particularly prodigious dragon snore.
“Draco!” The two kids call from the bench - their feet not even reaching the floor. “Teach us!”
He holds up a hand and Harry’s mouth swings shut. “It was a War orphanage, Harry. And the casualty report has yet to arrive.”
"Wh-I-er-" Draco's staring at him, but his look is level, calm, and otherwise unreadable. "Yeah?"
Draco tilts his head a little to one side, his brow making deep wrinkles between his eyes.
Finally, he takes out the bulk of the supplies: the food. Although dragons are more than capable of hunting for themselves, dragon caretakers prepare a special meal for newborns. The pellets, although unassuming, are packed with essential nutrients, and have proved to be so beneficial that the adult dragons at Snowdonia allow it. And since baby dragons are born with teeth, they can eat it with no problems.
At that moment, Ginny walks into the living room still in her pajamas. Luna follows closely behind and stops to admire the Christmas tree and its decorations.
“Harry.” Neville’s face is frightening. It’s unmoving, unreadable, like stone. “You’re an absolute bastard, you know that?” And then he storms out.
“Did you expect to be sleeping in the bed?” Malfoy’s perched at the end of the couch now, smiling mirthfully down at Harry as he struggles to untangle himself from the blankets.
"You two went to school together?!" Sophia gapes at them. The look on her face suggests that she has finally connected all the dots.
“It was...interesting.”
And Harry knows he’s the same way, knows from all the lazy mornings he’s spent tracing them that they have the same crow’s feet and smile lines. The same soft thighs and stomachs. The same gray.
“Welcome back!” The smallest one squeaks. He looks to be about 4 or 5 years old. When his eyes lands on Harry, he asks, “Who are you?”
“Well, Saturday also happened to be Aunt Bellatrix’s birthday.”
Time flies when Draco's playing; before Harry knows it, it's late into the night and Draco just lifted his hands from the piano from the last time - with a flourish - and the audience practically jumps to their feet as one in passionate applause.
Kreacher apparates back into his room after a few minutes with a tray of tea and small snacks - biscuits, cookies, and fruit.
“Er.” Though he’s groaning internally at the prospect of his vacation ending, Harry forces a smile. “Yep.”
Bill whistles at that. "What city?"
“There they are!” Prasad whisper-yells from the lip of the nest, the words nearly snatched away by the wind.
“W-wait!”
Harry Potter doesn't know how he could ever compare.
When he speaks again, his voice is thin and weary. “What bothers me is what the adults in my life did to me. How Snape took out his grudge on an eleven-year-old. How Dumbledore kept everything from me, until it was almost too late. How-” He stops to swallow. “How he gave me over to the Dursleys, knowing who they were. What they were.”
“Yeah?”
The rest of Draco's audience doesn't seem to be facing the same problems that Harry is. They clap, snap, stomp their feet, and even sing along to the pieces - their joyful faces illuminated by the spotlight, by the light reflecting off of Draco's sequined suit. Most of them know every single word by heart. They go especially wild when Draco plays jazzy renditions of what Harry vaguely knows are popular Muggle Christmas songs. But the small group of wizards and witches in the back just sit in silence, opting instead to watch and witness Muggle culture.
“Before you ask, no, Potter, I do not have love advice for you.”
"I'm....alright." Draco's voice doesn't sound upset or frightened. On the contrary, he sounds quite calm, and other than for the flush in his cheeks and the rapid rise of his chest as he catches his breath, there's no other indication that he just went through a near-death experience. "Nothing hurts, at least."
Charlie is the first to respond, "Really? Which one?"
"...Thank you. I will let you both know when that is." Draco's face is smooth, clear, his eyes hooded and his lips drawn in a straight line.
Harry waves goodbye to Molly and Arthur and proceeds to lead the remaining group to meet up with Draco. Something akin to a line has formed, directed by what seems to be the same person who rolled the piano onto the stage, and Harry and the rest of his friends stand in the very back.
He takes her hand and they share a formal shake, as if they're potential business partners meeting for the first time. "Likewise, Ms. Weasley."
Malfoy’s eyes narrow and the finger on the mug stops. “Why?”
With a nod and a flourish of robes, Ron disapparates. Harry does the same a moment later.
Draco considers this. “I understand enough. You’re carrying through with it because you think you owe it. To her, to the Weasleys, to the world.”
After work, he apparates home, shrugs off his robes and shrugs on a Muggle coat, and spells his hair blonde to lessen the chances that someone will recognize him. It's worked a few times before when he wanted to run errands unbothered or play in public with Rose, so he figures it's worth a shot. The fact that it's apparently an all-Muggle event helps his chances at anonymity greatly.
“Morning, Malfoy! Crazy storm, huh?” Longbottom comments, cheerily.
The Auror Office doesn’t think they’re planning any kind of widespread takeover soon, given the size of the group, but the possibility grows alongside their recruitment efforts. Ron told him over lunch the other day that, in the past month alone, they’ve acquired a few hundred members. It seems that, with each passing year, the terror felt from Voldemort’s reign slips further and further from people’s minds. Blood purity sentiments are slowly, but surely, resurfacing.
With Edwards' compliance, it only takes another day and a half to track down and arrest all of the higher ups in the neo-Death Eater organization. Ron leads most of the raids, and Hermione's so ecstatic about it all that she cuts out a photo of him from
“Want to grab drinks sometime? To properly catch up. Sorry - I’ve got to dash over to meet my boyfriend right now.”
The latter adds on that while carving himself some of the ham. "I think I’ve heard the name around the office once or twice."
They give him a confused, but kind look. “Are you joining this class, Mr. Potter?”
“Then I’ll teach you.” He stands and shakes off sand in glittering waves. He offers a hand to Draco, smiling. “Come on.”
"Very well." George puffs out his chest a little. "We're looking to opening our first store in America in a month, actually."
“I believe in french you would call me ‘un con.”
“I will.”
Though Harry groans in protest, he still picks himself off the floor - an action that he doesn't remember being quite so difficult when he was young - and obeys. With the two men levitating five mugs each, they make it in one trip.
He checks the time again and realizes he'd better make his way to the conference room soon. He doubts anything said in the meeting will actually be pertinent for him, and honestly no one would miss him if he didn't show up, but he's grateful for any distraction at this point.
A few minutes later, he’s running down Handel Street in the middle of Muggle London, sweating under his jacket. 54 Handel Street turns out to be a small cafe nestled between a fancy-looking hotel and some unmarked corporate building. The sign in front is chipped, but the words
When he opens it, she flies in and perches on his shoulder. He unties the piece of parchment attached to her leg and it reads:
“Often enough. I mainly go over to her house for tea or supper once every few week.”
Sophia swats at Lucas’ shoulder, laughing. “
His wife puts on her coat and fiddles with the collar. "I think Arthur and I will head back to the Burrow. Are you kids staying?"
Harry reminds himself. “You’re distracting me.”
"New York."
As soon as Arthur, Ginny, Luna, and Molly rejoin them, the house lights dim again and cues the crowd into silence. Moments later, Draco walks out again, still in his suit, his hair still wild and covering most of his forehead. The crowd cheers him on, he bows deeply, and picks back up the microphone.
"I hope the first half has been as fun for you all as it has been for me."
It feels so surreal to be posting the final chapter of this series. It's like the past two years of my life have resolved with a click of a button!
“Are you coming?”
"Good morning ever-" But before he can finish, the children flock to him en masse, clamoring for his attention.
Adrenaline makes Harry's heart pump, makes his legs work faster and faster. He's moving so fast his breaths come up in a puff of steam and quickly blow past him. The air is cutting. The voices around him are loud. He doesn't dare look behind to see how far Lucas has gotten. He doesn't dare peel his eyes off of the sight in front of him: their collapsed fort, Gordon and Robin cheering him on, and the empty spot where their wands used to be.
They do keep a light, however, with the help of Harry’s wandless magic. By the glow of his fingertip, and with a few, small apparition jumps, they reach the coast with all the supplies intact.
"Merlin, no! What gave you that idea!?"
“Wha-? No, I’m not disappointed.” Gently, Harry lays a hand atop the bureau. “Really, this is great. Better than I imagined.”
“I don’t think anyone knew, even my closest friends. I wanted to fit in.” Draco eats a small cut of the pork and groans. “This is fantastic, Molly.” Then he turns to Harry and splits the rest of his piece with him. “Here, have some, Harry.”
“Sorry about this.”
Vaguely, he also wonders what Draco's doing right now. Maybe sleeping. Maybe at that cafe. Maybe even at the orphanage. When Harry closes his eyes, he can imagine the blonde at any location, relaxing, smiling, working.
“You alright, mate?” A hand waves in Harry’s face, and he snaps out of a daze and blinks his eyes and realizes that he’s no longer at the club. He’s in a bathroom. Specifically, he’s in
“That doesn’t change the fact that she did horrible things to you. And, God-your
“A whim?”
Above, the gulls still call, always interrupting, always overlapping - until question and answer bleed into one.
“I beg your pardon?”
Malfoy looks back at Harry, sighs, and stops. There are many heavy-looking books tucked in his arms - Harry spots what seems to be a Muggle Physics textbook.
And above all else, Harry keeps his distance - physically. When their hands accidentally brush as he hands off Draco’s tea, Harry jerks back, ever so slightly. When Harry passes him in the kitchen, he gives Draco a wide berth. Draco thought the pricking at his collar would ease - that the gripping tension he felt in his chest every time Harry got too close, looked for too long, would fade as Harry kept away.
“This is the main building,” he says, avoiding eye contact, “All of our offices are in here, and this is where you will work.” Draco rests a hand on the receptionist counter. “The restrooms are down the hall, first right. There’s a breakroom, too - last right.”
“They go to my Mother’s place for Christmas. I might pop in but it’s a bit of a squeeze.”
Albeit a little unwillingly,
He's right. Since most of Harry's job is just copying the same information on thousands and thousands different forms, the Copy Quill - which he's been eyeing himself for a few months now - will make it far less depressing. "Thank you - hopefully this will shut Robards up about 'efficiency' for a while." He tries to joke, but it comes out half-hearted. The gift only reminds him that he has to go back to the Ministry, to his small desk and his small cubicle tomorrow.
“Anyway, I came to tell you that we won’t need the report anymore.”
“Yes?”
“Will do.” Harry stands and looks down at Draco. “Let’s go?”
"I agree! I never knew jazz could be so uplifting," Hermione enthuses while coming around Harry's other side.
"That's okay. I just happened to see it while I was out." That's a lie. Harry racked his brain to think of a suitable present for hours and made a special trip to Hogsmeade yesterday morning to acquire it.
"Tempus." The spell reads: '9:47am.' Harry sighs and vanishes the note. From afar, Harry can still hear the hurried footsteps of his coworkers in the hall.
"Master? Master Harry?"
"Yes. God, yes," he moans as Harry kisses him again. “As long as you’ll have me.”
“Draco?”
He's wearing a green suit - Slytherin green - but it's completely covered in sequins . The light reflected off of him makes Harry squint through his glasses a little. His hair isn't slicked back - in fact, it hangs in his eyes and frames his face, making him seem younger.
"I forgot, okay?!"
Stella answers him. “The rules are: no wands, no cheating, and no contact with anything other than snow. At the start of the game we’ll all pile up our wands in our territory and the other team will do the same with theirs in their territory. The objective is to steal all the wands from the other team.”
“Yes, that’s correct. They do not need to intake food or water during hibernation.”
“This isn’t about what you want!”
"...Yeah. Yeah, it's Draco Malfoy - can you believe it?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Charlie smiles. "I don't see why not. We don’t have to go back until the day after."
"I'm sorry, I know."
“Yes. I’ve wanted to be an Auror since I was little.”
"Enough," Kingsley interrupts him with a firm hand on his shoulder. "This isn't anyone's fault but Auror Edwards'. And there's no use in pointing fingers at this point in time. Our priority should recovering the accuracy of the files and going from there. Auror Potter, you are dismissed."
“Malfoy…?”
“I said no. I said
Less like a confession and more like a joyous proclamation, it falls from his lips, “Me too.”
He whips his head around but doesn’t see a single head of blonde hair gleaming by the light of the fire. His hand twitches toward his wand, ready to send a Patronus to him, but he catches sight of a group of children a little ways away and immediately runs toward them.
to get hurt." Ginny adds while braiding Luna's hair.
The blonde, immediately upon touching the mattress, stops moving and stares up at the ceiling. Somehow in the struggle the top three buttons of his shirt came unbuttoned, and Harry tries not to stare out of respect. “You move fast for a first date, Harry.” Other than a little slurring, he almost sounds completely sober.
The two hold a heated gaze for a moment. “Fine,” Harry breaks it and picks up a book, a smile tugging at his lips, “you have a point.”
After, they squeeze onto the two-seater in the living room, and listen to the song of rain. The dryer hums in the background, and their clothes tumble around together. Draco could dry them with a flick of his wand, but there is no rush, and he’s grown quite used to doing it all the Muggle way.
Malfoy’s eyes open but are still directed at the ceiling. “I mean good job in class today.” The couch groans as Malfoy sits back up - his hair mussed. “Do you actually want to learn about my research?” His voice sounds vulnerable, almost raw.
The students
“I love you too.”
obvious?”
“Uh, yeah, it did. Froze over during the winter and everything.”
A sigh of relief. “That makes me feel better.”
“Her scales act as insulation, and no, it is not dangerous, especially with the Refuge keeping watch. Though before, when dragons freely flew the Earth, there was some level of danger due to their open nest design. But the eggs need to be kept cool to survive - in the warmer months, the dragons bury them in the sand.”
Though Draco knows how trite it is, he says, “I’m sorry,” and squeezes Harry’s hand.
Pat runs over and joins the hug, even though Jones doesn’t seem quite finished with her. “Thank you for coming. God I-” She takes a shuddery breath. “Thank you.”
Then, he speaks: “So what now?”
They sit there, read, and organize for an hour or so - Harry’s lost track, too distracted by the mountains of parchment and by Malfoy, who, other than when he got up to bring back the tea, has been sitting right next to Harry the whole time. Occasionally he would change positions: both feet on the floor, cross-legged, reclining against the other end of the couch with his feet nearly in Harry’s lap. In contrast, Harry hasn’t dared to move anything more than his eyes as he scans the readings.
Those same hands touch Draco any chance they get. When cooking supper together, they slide along Draco’s waist as Harry squeezes by. When on a hike and Draco stumbles on a loose bit of rock, they shoot out to catch him. And when kissing, well, they are everywhere and endless.
For some reason, Draco's been hesitant to put labels on their relationship all this time, but Harry doesn't mind too much. He's happy with whatever Draco's comfortable with.
They laugh and Harry finds himself joining in. Even after all these years entrenched in the Wizarding community and in magic, both Harry and Hermione find themselves forgetting it all for a moment.
"But we're happy that you did," Arthur jumps in too, "Draco was...surprisingly good company."
Sparks spray from the fire.
But suddenly, Malfoy stands up and moves across the classroom to look out the window. Harry watches his back warily.
“Are you sure about that?”
“It is.”
“But…” Longbottom trails off.
Harry takes Draco’s hands, which are trembling, and says, “That’s...understandable. Family can be illogical, sometimes.”
Harry's drawn to the crowd gathered at the left wall and when he draws near he can make out what the banner on the wall reads: 'Draco Malfoy's Benefit Concert for the Harmony Orphanage; Donate Here.' The Muggles are gathered around the table directly below it, which is being manned by the club owner - Belle, Harry remembers to be her name.
He spots his sweater on the other side of the room, hanging off of something. When he pads over and unhooks it, he realizes it was covering a portrait of a man with a monocle and a pointy moustache. He looks miffed at being covered for probably the entire night, but grateful for being uncovered at the same time.
And when all the food has been eaten and Harry’s had two glasses of wine with Ron (Hermione sipping some tea), he stands up, hugs both of them, tells Ron he’ll see him tomorrow at work, and makes his leave.
Malfoy relinquishes his hold on Harry’s stomach, and he immediately misses the warmth. Now that he’s on the ice - which seems to be Malfoy’s greatest challenge - Malfoy has little problem skating on his own. He only seems rusty at the most. “Thanks.” Is it Harry’s overactive imagination, or do Malfoy’s cheeks look too red to be attributed to just the cold?
"It's...hard to live as we are. After the War and everything awful that's happened. For a long time, I thought I could never see anyone again because I thought...I would be a burden. Or they wouldn't understand."
Hermione, who had been listening quietly until now, adds her two cents. "Rosie, which one do you choose?"
Unchanging and eternal, Draco had thought of Snowdonia. A constant in a world of fickle forces and the vagaries of life.
“I’m just...curious.”
“Getting warmer.”
"Ye-yeah."
"Yes?"
“Where is that?” Thomas asks, and Finnigan stretches out a hand and traces the hunter’s lines for his husband.
"What were so wrong with those?!" Harry protests.
“By the way, professor,” Lucas ventures, “would you ever be willing to play for us sometime? As a class?”
Paperwork. Classic. "Sure. Anything else?"
His coworkers - M. Prasad and Lin Walker - flit in and out, helping him here and there, but he scarcely sees them. Amira comes by, too, giving him direction. Bringing him the lunch he’s been neglecting:
They step into the hut and shut the cold out. Harry lets out a sigh of relief as he loosens his muffler, relishing the warmth of the fire.
"Are they bringing the piano out?" Arthur asks, clearly directing his attempt at a whisper toward Molly, but he's loud enough that everyone at their table and probably the ones once over hear him clearly.
They're all laughing and smiling. Sophia joins the pile-on moments later and they scream and yell together.
In comparison, Percy just isn't even on the same level as her. He's not particularly ugly, but he's undeniably dull as a person, and kind of a prick - at least in Harry’s opinion. For Audrey, however, he's obedient and compromising and loving, so perhaps Harry is only opposed to their couplehood not because they're bad for each other, but because he's a bit jealous.
He steels himself, tries to calm the thrumming in him - the music of his heart - and steps out.
“Alright, lovebirds. Let’s settle down.” Harry pats the chair next to him. “The food is going to get cold.”
Hermione laughs, modestly trying to play it off, but Harry can tell from years of knowing her that she's pleased.
Finally, Harry asks, “Did the rest of the family know?”
“That’s fine.”
"Merlin. It's just so ridiculous."
“O-oh. I guess so.” Harry laughs, embarrassed. “We were that obvious huh?”
They stop by Malfoy’s place to pick up the textbooks - Harry’s carrying the heaviest ones again - and head straight to class.
Harry presses a kiss to his temple. His voice warm, he says, “I’m happy for you. And thank you. Thank you for everything. Oh Merlin, this is going to be so fun.”
It isn’t a surprise; no one lives long after being Kissed, and Lucius Malfoy has lived past the average, anyways. Seven years. Draco gets dressed. He doesn’t bother checking himself in the mirror before leaving, he knows what he would see.
” White sparks fly out of Harry’s wand and arrange themselves into ‘6:33 PM’ in the air. After a moment, they melt away.
She looks up as Harry enters and sits on the couch next to her. "Good morning."
"Were you a Seeker? Like Uncle Harry?"
Harry shifts his body so his hips aren’t aligned with Draco’s.
Harry chuckles and takes Rose from Hermione as he emerges fully from the fireplace. She immediately latches onto him, clutching at the collar of his faded T-shirt. “Did you miss me?” He asks, teasing her.
“Harry,” Draco says, his voice a scraping whisper, “You were raised that way, too.”
“Malfoy!”
And on they walk, through Snowdonia, the place where everything changes, and everything lasts.
The same.
Mouth full of buttery biscuit, Harry manages to get out a muffled "Thank you." Kreacher doesn't react too much, simply bows and apparates away without another word. At Hermione's insistence, Harry has technically freed Kreacher, and he now technically works full-time in the Hogwarts kitchens. However, due to some drastic circumstances a year or two ago, Kreacher has been on extended leave from Hogwarts and has returned to Grimmauld place to take care of Harry. He doesn't really understand the loyalty because Harry is technically a half-blood and the godson of the Black family's greatest traitor - though he begrudgingly appreciates it while highly suspecting that it's also Hermione's secret handiwork.
Harry muses.
"Shit."
The smile freezes on Malfoy’s face, but only for a second. “Small jobs, here and there. Part-time.” He pauses to take a sip from his cup. “Is this what you meant by ‘catching up?”
“That’s awful.”
"Musical Theory?"
Harry lets out a small breath of relief.
“Fuck,” Harry bites out. Spotty hoots reproachfully at his language, but Harry can’t bring himself to care very much right now. His brain is processing, running through all the possible responses he could send and trying to figure out which one would be able to convince Malfoy to go out for drinks with him.
Harry gets the feeling that maybe it would be unwise to go any further, especially with Malfoy as a former Death Eater
Lucas adds, though not unkindly, "Yeah, it's in our Modern History of Magic textbook."
Harry knows that, coming from McGonagall, it’s a high compliment. One glance at Malfoy tells him that he understands the honor as well - his head is slightly and graciously bowed. Behind the Headmistress, Dumbledore smiles, eyes twinkling the same as they always have. Snape isn't in his frame.
Blinking, Harry says, “Yeah. Just tired.”
He's nervous about breaking up with me, probably, Harry thinks as he sullenly stabs at a piece of chicken.
he thinks,
“I am not amused.”
A whisper: “I know. That’s what makes it so painful, right?”
“...Good work.” It comes so quietly, so haltingly, that for a moment Harry think he’s misheard. He glances over at Malfoy and he’s lying perfectly still, his eyes closed and his face peaceful.
The seabirds call and call - waiting for an answer. “He wasn’t a good man,” Draco says. “He wasn’t a good man, and he wasn’t a good husband or father, and hardly anyone is sad to see him gone, but-”
Harry looks over at Draco, heart pounding. The blonde doesn't speak for a little bit, too occupied with turning the gift over and over in his hands, inspecting every square inch of it. In the background, Harry barely registers Fleur coming back from the kitchen with a steaming pot of tea and a collection of cups. He's only focused on Draco, on his hands, on his face, on the way he's biting his lips.
Harry sneaks a look at Malfoy. He’s still hunched over the desk with a few strands of blonde hair hanging over his eyes. Underneath his robes, he’s wearing a light tan sweater with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Harry’s eyes linger there, and when they look back up again they meet Malfoy’s.
He wonders if Draco is a dog person. He can see him as either - dog or cat.
Malfoy nods and stands. “Well, anyways, it was nice. This past week, I mean.”
“Something we have in common, then."
Draco knows what he is thinking of. “The Tri-Wizard Tournament? The dragons they carried in for that were deliberately agitated. Under ordinary circumstances, they would not have paid us humans any mind at all.”
For the the next several minutes Harry alternates between sitting in his chair and staring blankly at his wall and leaning back and hoping to 'accidentally' fall asleep as he waits for an owl from Robards to give him some direction.
“Oh. Okay.”
“I will Rose, I promise, but not today.” Her whole body seems to deflate that at. “It’s too dark outside right now.”
Idly, Harry rubs the dusty framed picture of him, Hermione, and Ron with the corner of his sweater. They took it a few years ago, at some kind of fundraising event for Hermione's nonprofit - which has since closed down, but Hermione is currently working on getting it back up and running - but it looks like it could’ve been taken just yesterday.
“Neville-” Harry pauses, gathering his words. He’s the one who invited Neville here. He has one chance to make everything right. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I don’t think I can say it enough.”
“Oh, uh, yes. Please. One coffee, extra cream.” Harry hands her a few bills he finds stuffed in his back pocket.
Summer in Snowdonia is green, lush as this far north can allow. The skies are light and the dragons play in the clouds up high, their tails whipping and wings snapping. The ravens make their nests in the birch forests, and the otters build their homes on the tributaries. When it rains, the foxes go to their holes and the wild owls burrow into their hollows, and the only sound across the valley and mountain sides is the
Harry’s dish is indeed ‘a hodge-podge of meat and potatoes,’ as Draco described, only the food is more artfully arranged than Harry was expecting a ‘hodge-podge’ to be.
“It’s a crowd favorite.”
The song is...nice. It’s light and upbeat and Harry finds himself almost tapping his foot to the rhythm or swaying to the beat. He doesn’t, of course, but everyone else does: the children, the woman,
bullshit?” Harry barks out a laugh. “I haven’t read a single paper like that since the war.”
Adore, as it turns out, is an extremely upscale Muggle French restaurant complete with real plants hanging from the rafters, tables lit by candles, and unlimited, fresh baguettes.
Everyone knows the Malfoy vaults were emptied after the War. Apparently, Harry was too busy courting Ginerva Weasley to read the tabloids. Draco tries to control his breathing.
Harry falls asleep and does not dream.
They laugh at that, and suddenly Harry’s back in the Gryffindor boys dormitory again, staying up late with Neville and the rest, cracking jokes and giggling so loud the upperclassmen would pound on their door to get them to shut up.
He holds out his hand and Harry passes it over to him. While he inspects the previous spells cast on it, he tells Harry, "Get Kinglsey."
“Yeah.”
"1." The two teams form a chorus.
“I’ve always wished I could ride him,” Thomas says. “Weird how we have unicorns but not pegasi, eh?”
It’s hard work, and before long, everyone except for Draco is breathing heavy, their footsteps slowing and their hands scrambling for the water they packed. They follow a haphazard stone path, the moss and lichen like a carpet underfoot. A few birds call, the wind plays through the grass, but otherwise the valley is still quiet with winter.
"I understand," Hermione says, nodding her head in empathy. Harry feels similarly - although he and Hermione need to don disguises for reasons other than Draco's, they're all under the same risk of public scrutiny.
It's cold, but the group lines up behind the Muggles, who are chatting lively about everything - from the weather (cold and snowy) to what they did for Christmas to the performance they're about to watch.
They walk in tenuous silence, and it’s a long walk too. It seems, for whatever reason, Malfoy’s destination happens to be on the exact opposite side of the castle - or maybe he’s just fucking with Harry. Both are very distinct possibilities.
The pounding at the door continues, and Draco grows more and more certain of the circumstances. “Harry, it’s an emergency, we need to go.”
"I've never shared my own music before, but-" Draco has to stop talking because the cheers of the crowd suddenly overwhelm his voice, even with the microphone. Once they calm down a little bit, he continues. "I want to share some of my compositions with you all tonight, for this last half. If that's alright with you."
“Oh, the one over in America?”
“Yes, we have.” Longbottom gives him a smile, slightly more genuine than the ones yesterday. “Shall we?”
Something sounds in the kitchen - a cross between a bell and a horn - and Molly scrambles to her feet, placing her knitting gently on the table. "Breakfast's ready!" She shouts, loud enough to reach the upper floors. Harry swears he hears a distant thump from some bedroom somewhere in the house.
“How did you learn all this stuff? About history and nature and everything.”
Harry can’t remember a time when he thought his uncle, aunt, and cousin were in the right, but he does understand what it feels like to want to defend them anyways.
“What was the song you played?”
Afterwards, Harry skips the reception in favor for some home cooking - it’s Friday, after all.
"You-I-what? You're not?"
Snowdonia is an old place. The dragons it hides are younger, but still unfathomably ancient to mortals - so old they predate most Wizarding lineages. Though some visitors shudder at the thought, it steadies Draco’s hand and quiets his heart. He touches the smooth horn of a young dragon, curled in on itself and snoring, and he touches a creature born before his father was even a thought. He disturbs a stone, and sends it tumbling off into the river below, and he’s moved something that hasn’t in centuries. The continuity is like a balm on his raw heart.
“No thanks, Prasad.”
And all of this is not to mention the nature of the department. Police are police, no matter if they’re wielding a wand or a baton or a gun. The Auror department’s job is to protect the rich, ruling wizards and witches more than it is to actually serve the marginalized, and no amount of “fun” community initiatives or open office parties will change that.
Draco suddenly shoots up so he’s sitting, turns, and waves at the Weasleys. "I'm alright!" The children, who had been looking on worryingly, some even closing their eyes in terror, smile and cheer in relief. "Help me up?" Draco mutters to Harry, and the latter obliges.
As soon as Harry steps through the threshold of
Harry wonders what time it is now, but makes no move to grab his wand off his bedside table and check. He might not even want to know. If he's late for work, then he'll be anxious. But not knowing if he's late for work yet or not makes him anxious too. So instead of doing anything to potentially resolve either anxiety, Harry just continues to lay, unmoving, in his bed and stare up at the ceiling. It's a drab gray color, and he suddenly flashes back to promising himself a long time ago that he'd makeover his room - and by extension the rest of the ugly house - some day.
Malfoy grins back. “Ah, excellent choice. They’re my favorite subject.”
“We’re just friends!” Harry winces and adds, “Maybe even less.”
“Thank you.” Draco says, the sincerity in his voice surprising him. He looks up, and there Harry is, suddenly. Watching him, his face intense. And very close.
Draco steps out into the gray morning. The rain is not as heavy anymore, more aluminum than lead. At the flooded fire pit, the men are already strapped up, Impervious’d, and waving to Draco.
The group is quiet as they begin the hike, which leaves Draco no other choice but to fill up the empty space by himself. He introduces the Refuge to them, their history, their mission:
“Fuck.”
"What?!" Ginny's head whips around to look at Harry, outraged. "You call meeting the family a
“You’ve forgotten to eat.”
“I-” He looks as if he’s going to protest, but suddenly deflates. “You’re right. I apologize.”
Harry shakes his head, transfixed. “It’s fine.”
Thankfully, tonight’s dream falls in the middle of the two poles. Harry dreams of the last time he saw Malfoy: at his trials.
“Everyone,” Draco continues, feeling pleased with himself, “Weasley, Granger, Longbottom, Lovegood, Thomas, Finnigan. And Ginevra.”
Harry starts as he's in the process of adjusting his robes and walking out. "Yes?"
“When, then? Tomorrow?”
“Oh. Why didn’t anyone tell me? Hermione?” When Harry turns to look at her, she’s avoiding his eyes.
Rolling his eyes, Neville replies, “It’s always been obvious.”
Then, they walk into view, strapped up with various packs, one carrying a small cooler. They are so busy laughing and joking among themselves, that they barely look inside the building they’re walking towards, until they enter.
Harry would like to do nothing more than shoot the breeze with his best friend for a few hours, but he knows Ron can't afford to take breaks. Not when he's leading the field teams.
But the dragons are flying. And he has work again - hard work collecting manure and feeding the fledglings and wrestling thermometers into dragon mouths. Draco writes his mother, telling her he’s happy, and he is - really, he is. Because what was he expecting, anyways? Harry Potter is over there, and Draco Malfoy is over here, and that’s always how it’s been.
"I-thank you." Draco flashes Harry an uneasy smile before he tears back the wrapping in quick, efficient strokes. Harry follows suit with his own present from Hagrid. He thinks it’s a snitch at first, but when it swings open on its hidden hinge Harry realizes it’s a pocket watch enchanted to vibrate gently at times that Harry can customize. From its accompanying note, Harry learns that Hagrid bought it for him in France while visiting his now-fiancee.
Despite himself, Draco Malfoy cries when his father dies.
“Good, I think. The firs’ years get bolder an’ bolder every year. One o’ them the other day nearly got ‘is hand taken off by a kneazle. A
"But it's not a bad effect, right?" It doesn't seem to be, at least. Harry feels pretty good at the moment - but not in an addicting, enchanted way that makes him want to listen to the music forever or something like that. No, it feels gentle and non-malicious - like a blanket warmed by a loved one's body heat, or a spot on the rug close to the fire.
