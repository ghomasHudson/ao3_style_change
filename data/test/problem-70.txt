Draco lay there was a while, his back pressed against the ground, breath frantic trying to get some oxygen in. His vision focused dazed up at the sky before him.
Draco finally took the time to get out of his head and looked at the hazy figure of Potter, reaching out to him, saying something he couldn't hear. The magic tugged on him again, and this time Draco let himself go. His knees gave up on him, and before the ground came rushing in upon him, he let his eyes close. Falling deep into the abyss.
Twisting back, he aimed for the raven’s face, only to be stopped mid way. The raven had his wrists in a speed that was much too impossible for a normal human. He winced, as he was harsly spun around, and pressed back against the other’s chest.
The realization hit him like a bullet. Ripping through his flesh, tearing and digging deeper with every growing second. He scrambled for the knife laying discarded in the pile of snow. Draco dug into the snow, reaching for the blade, but Potter was on him in an instant, knocking him over sending them both rolling down the hill, away from the fight.
Malfoy's movements halted for a moment and he continued. "You, the son of a death eater, and me the savior of the wizarding world, the one who is meant to keep death eaters like
He took his seat on the ground next to his sister, wincing slightly at the small sting in his stomach. It was a simple game of wizard cracker-pop it. Draco snapped his neck to the side a little, cracking his knuckles, and let out a wide grin.
“Oh! Did you eat that Treacle Tart that they served in breakfast today?” Draco shook his head, he hadn’t eaten anything at all. And now that potter had spoken of it, he could feel his stomach quench at the emptiness. Perhaps he should’ve tried to eat something. Potter seemed to be genuinely surprised by his answer. “YOU DIDN’T?!?!”
Panic rose within him and he moved slightly on the broom to look at her. He shook her a little. Tried to call out her name, and yet she wouldn't wake. Draco eyes widened and his breath quickened.
It seemed that Potter had finally returned to finish the job. To end him once and for all. Maybe the raven finally found out about his secret, or maybe it was all out of pure spite. Could someone really hate him that much? To the point where they want to kill him?
Hermione had half the mind to stop, and hug her friend, tell him that it wasn’t his fault. He didn’t know, but it was already to late. The raven shot off, sprinting down the hall, and disappearing around the corner before she could as much as take another hasty step forward.
He pockets the photo in his jacket, looking around the closed off warehouse. The two doors had been blown open, the girl undoubtedly being trapped. He takes note of the gun on the floor, not daring to dwell too much on the thought.
worried about Malfoy. Not at all! Madame Pomfrey had forced him to stay here until Malfoy woke up. Her reasoning,
But Draco was not his father. Not at all. Draco was Draco. Draco Malfoy. And Draco Malfoy would do no such thing.
“What is your name?” Granger repeated, Carrot top simply leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed, looking more amused than one should. Maybe it was just Draco didn’t transform properly in this world. How...how was it someone could be amused watching another hurt? Was that how they worked now?
The lump on the bed shot up, tumbling off the bed and onto the floor. Potter groaned, and looked up scratching his head just a little. Draco took in his form. Hair disheveled, glasses tilted, and eyes groggy. Now this was the Potter he knew.
The raven scratched the back of his head, and gave a cheeky smile. “Give me a break. I did live in a closet for half my life.”
It didn’t matter now. They’d given her a proper burial nonetheless. Now she was but a distant memory. Draco refuses to remember before those two year. He didn’t want to...and he didn’t have to.
Draco rolled his eyes, and craned his neck to look at the raven standing by the cell door. “No, I’ve been sleeping just fine on this cold,
"Mornin' Draco! Sleep well?" Draco looked up to see Pansy with a huge smile plastered on her face. "Well you know cause' I slept pretty well!"
She wanted to laugh. Laugh so badly, but all that would escape her parted lips was a pained groan. So she allowed herself a smile. Lips wavering, threatening to falter back to their plain ol’ frown.
They were gaining up on him, and he didn’t know how much longer he could carry on. His arms aching with every blow, and swing of his bat. Sweat dripped down from his forehead to his chin. He didn’t dare to lick it. It could’ve been mixed in with unfortunate blood, and no way in hell was he going turn by drinking in his own sweat. No matter how much his throat craved it.
So..Lilliath or Lilly is an OC character. She practically looks like a younger version of Draco Malfoy, but without the gel. She's also Draco Malfoy's sister. Yeah.
Also, if someone is having a panic attack, don't be like Harry, and forcefully force hugs upon them. Get them to calm down, and respect their space. Try to get them to be aware of their surroundings, and just be with them. I don't know much about panic attacks, but I would still respect their personal space. Harry's has trouble understanding what that means~
And Draco sobbed. For the first time, his cries loud, and pained. He clenched the shirt in his fists fearing if he didn't hold on tight enough, it might slip out from his fingertips.
He took in a deel breath, trying to shake the tiredness out of him, and then started again. "Well then, Potter. I'll just remove myself from your presence. You keep doing what you were doing." He stood, making his way to the door with his bare feet. Right now, there was no use asking question like 'how he got here?' Or rather '
“I’m not going to hurt you,” it claims, but Draco knows better than to trust it. He couldn’t let himself be fooled now just because it had found a human face. It was a mask. Nothing more. He’d read the files. The studies. He’d seen the pictures and he..he knows better than he did two years ago.
“I–I can’t..I nee–” Draco let himself stop there. He knew where this was going. There was only one way to get out from the barrier around the house, and that was through flying. The barrier was broken from the top as though it were a room but without a ceiling.
Draco really needs a better plan, because this dumbass raven wasn’t going to let him do anything but sleep.
This pain felt endless...was death supposed to be this long? He didn't really want to die, and every growing second was giving him false hope that he would live. The false hope was worse. Were the fates so revolted with him that they wouldn't even give him as much as a peaceful death. He supposed his first theory was right. Someone up there really did fucking hate him. That was all up until, the gold plated door slammed open, a mast of black unruly hair sweeping towards him in an alarmingly fast rate.
Draco's eyes widened, and his face reddened even more. He swiftly turned his head around, and bit his lip, not daring to move, or even think about what Potter would feel like against him.
It's a zombie AU, featuring Harry with a mullet. If that sounds interesting to you guys, please go check it out! I promise it won't disappoint!
His wand core. Unicorn hair. Designed specifically to resist dark magic, and Draco would've laughed at the irony of it, hadn't it been him choking to death a few moments prior. Unicorn's are meant to be pure, and beautiful creatures of the light side and here he was. All dark wizard and "death eater."
Draco turned his attention back to Blaise, who gave him a guilt drenched look. Draco tried to smile, but his lips wouldn’t move. His
The raven stopped, turning around slightly, and giving Draco a wide grin that only spoke trouble. “Oh, don’t worry about him. He’ll be joining you here soon enough.”
Ron places his hands on the table making his plate clatter a little, and looked at Harry dramatically. "I mean, have you seen him?! He didn't even pull his ugly sneer of his when we crossed. I even called him a ferret when he walked by...didn't stop even once. It's like he wasn't fazed at all!! The most he did was brush against my clothing and mutter a weak grunt."
Of course Potter wouldn’t forget that, and that made Draco bite the inside of his cheek harder in frustration. Without another word, he unbuckled the satchel hidden underneath the safety of his cloak, handing it to the raven, who took it without hesitation. Oh if Poter knew the wand was useless, binded with magic, he had yet to understand.
Sorry for updating so late! School started and my grades were beginning to drop, so I was focusing more on my studies. This new chapter is a bit small, but I hope you all enjoy it. I'll be sure to make up for not updating in the next chapter. Until next time~ Be sure to review!
I don't know. I'm not opposed to writing sex scenes, but I've never down it before, and don't want to ruin the story in anyway. Let me know what you guys think.
P.S I wrote this at 12 at night, and didn't have the will power to grammar check or read it over twice.
Draco let out another yelp when he heard more chains clanging from around him. More unfortunates reaching out for him, but stopped only by the chains. They surrounded him in seconds, and Draco stopped. The air. The sight. Rotting flesh, and blood. The saltiness at the tip of his tongue, and the stench. Gods, the stench.
Shots ran through the air, and he kicked the unfortunate off. He scrambled for his bat, and stood up, coming back to back with Blaise. The moved around in a circle, watching each other’s back. Trusting one another with their lives.
Draco knew that wasn't the case, but he couldn't help his thoughts as they grew more and more sadistic with every passing second. Had Potter known that Draco wasn't faking, he probably would've helped, wouldn't have said those words. That hero syndrome of his would've taken over....or maybe. Maybe he would've been even worse. Telling him that this is what Draco deserved. And maybe Potter was correct. Maybe he did deserve all this. He deserved this....
“Stop,” the husky voice commanded, Draco didn’t listen. Couldn’t listen. He let out a slight whimper, as pain shot up his wrist, and yet, Draco refused to let go of the knife. It was his only source of security. The only thing he could trust.
During the 4th year, someone had given pictures of Pansy to the press. The pictures had spread like wildfire. They had called her a slut. They'd made video's, taken photos of Pansy in ways they shouldn't have.
His skin pierced through the barrier and before he knew it, Draco was on the other side. He looked up from his place on the ground, gaze meeting a violent shade of green. Potter was on the other side. Banging his hand against the barrier.
Weasley scoffed, and Draco spared him a challenging look. Potter, and Granger only watched them from the sofa, not bothering to join in.
He didn’t have to look far. They were kept in the room at the end of the hall, at the corner of the room, covered up lousy with a blanket. Draco allowed himself to grin in satisfaction. He quickly moved to the pile, and removed the blanket.
. A spell used to put a stop to simple, and small hexes. This however was no small hex. It was strong. Powerful. Meant to give the victim a torturous death. This spell, however had been broken.
She could help right? Tell him how to deal with it..or tell him that it was only a curse and she could remove it...or maybe even better. But...what if it doesn't turn out that way? Would they send him to St. Mungos to be treated? Is he..is he going...
Dumbledore was in a mess. He had to figure out how to execute his plan without it failing. And the most important fragment of this plan included Draco Malfoy. Lucius Malfoy's son.
Instead, he felt rather safe. Warm. Something he hadn't felt in a long while. Not since, Voldemort had moved into the manor. Not since he'd heard the screams of prisoners calling out to him. To help them. Not since all he'd done was watch. Watch as they trashed, shrieked in agony and begged for death.
Draco's wand flew out of his hand, and now rested in the palm of his rival. Draco gaped and his eyes grew wide.
Draco is confused, lost, unsure with what he has done. These past two years, he had been telling himself that betraying the Third Eye was for the best. It was the only way to ensure survival for all those outside the walls.
He wants these people to know he’s suffered. Wished nothing more than to for them to feel pain if they chose to kill him. To make sure they felt guilty and
Mrs Weasley almost chuckled. Malfoy acted more like a child now and less like a stuck - up, spoiled prat.
Grinning sheepishly, she turned on her heel to meet with the one and only Argus Filch, and of course the ever so loving...
She looks over the two, eyes meeting as they stop on a set of steel silver eyes. Silver eyes were rare, but unlike the stories, they did not sparkle, or shine like the diamonds she’d heard so much about. Nor did they run deep within the roots of frozen water. Instead, it was a rather soft green. Faded and worn out from the years of gruelling and pain.
Draco should be scared. He really should. His almost murderer to be was only a couple feet away from him and all he could do was watch with half-lidded eyes as he drifted between the boundaries sleep and awake. Maybe it was the potion. It was keeping him calm and relaxed but deep inside he knew it wasn't. It was different. Something was off. The atmosphere, the air, it all changed whenever Potter was around. It almost put him at
Harry rolled his eyes, seeming almost unaffected by the unfortunates around him. “For starters, you should be thanking me. I dragged your pathetic, sorry arse back here when you collapsed onto the ground like a weak ass bitch–”
"You...so you..did this?" Harry said. His voice so low and threatening that it caused Malfoy to take a step back. It felt as if something heavy had been placed upon him, and he couldn't help but tremble.
. Harry was normal back then, and now he's fighting to hold onto the last threads of his humanity. He was so close...so
Would Blaise have been willing to die to save everyone outside? To protect the lives of those who had turned their backs on them?
His food, was a simple plain green apple. Everyone else ate with their plate full. It's not that Draco ate any less, it's just his sleeping habits. They make him uneasy in the stomach causing him to lose his appetite. If it weren't for Pansy and Blaise, he probably wouldn't have eaten anything.
Harry grabbed him by the waist, keeping his up while dragging him around the unfortunates, and towards the door. Just as they reached the door, the raven glazed back, meeting Draco’s eyes. He flashed him a toothy grin, and his eyes gleamed with a shade of green he couldn’t exactly make out. “
Hands trembling, and breath shaky, he gripped glass shard, placing it against the barrier. The touch sending gentle ripples through the surface. It didn’t take long before he pushed the probity probe up against it. The cool metal of the probity probe pressed flat against his hand, as he tried to feel his magic.
Dying didn’t sound so bad. It’d put an end to the pain and if heaven truly did exist, he could be together with Pansy and Theo and his parents, and...and Emery. Surely, she deserved to go to heaven. Even if she had made a mistake. Blaise’s made mistakes too. Mistakes that haunt him to this day, and he hopes God is forgiving. Afterall, had he not suffered enough?
He pressed down on it, pushing another peice into his mouth. The favour the same, but this time Draco wanted to spit out. It was disgusting and
Blaise closes his eyes as the brunette pulls a knife out from under the cuff of her sleeves. He accepts his fate, his heartbeat slowing down. And he waits...for the knife to pierce through his neck...or his skull...maybe they’ll go for his heart. He isn’t sure, but as Hermione steps closer, he begins to relax, letting go.
Draco nods unsure of what the raven has planned. What Draco hadn’t expected was more exploding pain, this time sprouting from the width of hs stomach. He coughed attempting to topple over his aching stomach, red spilling from his lips like water.
He felt nothing but pure anger towards Malfoy. Harry knew that the boy infront of him would occasionally mess with his friends. Bully them. But this time, he'd gone to far. To the point of no return.
He could hear Potter take in a deep breath, and watched as the raven a hand through his unruly hair in frustration. “Ok Malfoy, I want you to be honest here. I-is...
” the raven stuttered for a moment, before putting that scowl back onto his face. “Well, then. You can stay here with the freaks until you agree to what we say.”
He'd asked for water which he'd been refused. The reason? Water components might mix in with the potion causing the effects to change and so he waited. Madame Pomfrey was long gone, amd the only person next to him was Potter.
patrolling at any place around the edge of the city, and they'd refused to take the risk to get out. Right now, it was all about survival, and they’d managed to live more than 2 years in this same city that tore them apart...why try their luck elsewhere? “
Harry gulped, realizing that the blonde truly had no idea of what a lawn mower was. His cheeks began to heat up slightly, eyeing the angry blonde, fidgeting and grumbling under his breath.
almost kill me!” Draco tried, but it only got Potter wallowing even louder. The raven rubbed a sleeve over his eyes trying to rid of his temporary weakness, but it no avail.
Draco felt a wash of relief wall over him. He welcomed it. Weasley ran his hands through her hair, cradling her lithe body. Granger was a strong woman. Draco wanted to remind Weasley that, but he figured it really wouldn’t matter. Granger wouldn’t break. She wasn’t glass. If anything, she was a force to be reckoned with. The brightest witch in all of Hogwarts.
He motioned to the pages stuck stuck to the walls, to the pictures of the two girls kissing. Holding hands. Touching.
Blaise is sure his heart will rip out from his rib cage, and he wonders if his captors...the one called Hermione...could hear the fear oozing out from his skin. Wonders if they could see his caged soul trashing and begging to be released. Looking for a moment’s worth of peace.
to hurt Malfoy, and now here he was. His lips spread to a grin and Harry let out a cackle. The pleasure it gave him to see Malfoy withering beneath him. Clawing at his neck in a futile attempt to breath.
The thought terrified him more than the unfortunate. He welcomes the tingling sensation, the suffocation slowly settling into his bones, becoming one with his body. It’d only be moments until he became used to it; every breath filling his lungs with poison. Until then he waits. Lays down on this short lived luxury, closes his eyes, holds his makeshift weapon tight in the grip of his palm and waits, feigning sleep. The clock ticking down to his ultimate end with every passing second.
. The one in which Potter reached out to grip his hand. The one where he was smiling like a buffoon. The one where he may or may not have
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. What was Potter talking about? Pictures? He opened his mouth to speak, but before he could say anything his back was slammed against the wall and he gasped when his head gave a slight thud as it came in contact with the stone. Potter's hands were on either side of his head, making Draco feel smaller than he was, and a lot more vulnerable. Now Draco took to time to see the look on Potter's face.
“Why do you think?” Draco lets out a sneer. “You think we want to spend the rest of our lives stuck in this hell hole? Five years has been more than enough, trust me. You broke in through the walls...
caught his father’s attention. His head tilting to the side, but wand refusing to move from Grangers crippled self.
Harry didn’t let Draco get close to the crowd of people waiting in a circle, instead opting to drag him away, into a deep underground tunnel. He wanted to talk...and touch and laugh together with them all. Wanted to feel what it was like to be close to another human other than Blaise.
family. He’d always gotten what he wanted, so there should be absolutely no reason that Malfoy should have such a strong response over...over
“Good boy,” the brunette patted his bruised cheek softly. Gods, Draco hated her already. “What’s your friends name?”
Draco huffed, motioning towards to door. Potter only sighed in return, and shook his head. "How about we
His eyes began closing, and if this was natural selection, than Mother Nature was a fucking miracle.
The warmth of Harry’s hand when he’d “cradled him in his arms.” It was something Draco would rather than admit remembering. He remembers how soft, and welcoming that disgusting shade of green was. How much warmer it felt than the green on the tip of the Dark Lord’s. They were the same colour, yet so much more different.
The brunette tried to follow, failing to keep up with the raven. Harry was long gone, and by this point, should be by Malfoy’s side. She came to a pause, frozen, and not knowing what to do anymore. She always knew what to do, and not knowing was not a good thing. The sound of footsteps coming from the other end of the hall, only foretold her doom.
He heard a small chuckle from behind him, and Draco couldn't help the small smile that found its way to his lips.
low. He knew what such things could do to a person. He'd seen what it did to Pansy. It'd broken her.
His only sense of security. This was the only thing he could trust...rely on. Blaise wasn’t here, nor was Pansy. He was on his own, and
“What if he doesn’t like me?! I mean...of course he doesn’t like me. I’ve been an arse to him and his friends for like 5 years?! What if he hates me?! OH GOD PANSY!! HE
Had he spared a bullet, his parents could have passed painlessly, but instead he was selfish. He ran away, their screams forever echoing in his mind. Sometimes Blaise wished he had his headphones back to tune out the pained sounds, but instead they opted on singing once or while when the nights got to hard.
“What are you–” Draco started, but was cut off, as Potter pushed him outside. He looked up startled at the raven. The raven stepped out with him, shutting the door behind him.
Draco squinted when the blinded his eyes as he walked out of the dark and into the light. He shut his eyes again and turned snuggling deeper into what seemed like a pillow. It was an attempt to go back to sleep, but when had sleep ever been easy for him?
Draco may have not been the most nicest person in Hogwarts. He may have not liked the Weasley's or the bloody saviour and he may have wanted nothing more than to make their lives miserable, but never would he stoop so low. Never
"Ok...so the stairs started to move, a-and I lost my balance and slipped thus m-making me fall down the stairs," Malfoy said with a shaky voice. Madame Pomfrey on the other sighed and waited in silence, as if expecting more from the injured boy infront of her. Draco groaned. "Ok..so
Blaise sits slumped down on the chair, not that he had a choice of getting up. The ropes dug tight on his bare wrists, the aching on his feet rumbling up his spine. His face throbs, feeling the bruises start to form, and his gut...gods, it hurts so bad. He has half a mind to vomit, but tries his best to swallow down the bile.
Dumbledore smiled yet again. And to the other, it almost looked a little creepy. As if he was finally having a dream come true.
If it had been anyone else, Draco would have long flipped them off, and already begun to walk in the opposite direction...but this was Harry they were talking about. Bloody Potter, with his stupid ass smile, and adorable gleam that made Draco forget about why he hated the rain in the first place.
Whatever it was, Harry didn’t like the sound of it. A panic attack...He didn't know. He didn’t know what it was. He didn’t...know. The floor opened, swallowing him with bitter guilt. It made him uneasy. He looked at his distressed friend who shook her head slightly.
'. His breath hitched and he softly traced the words with the soft of his thumb. Potter would do this? It had to be. No one else had a writting as sloppy as him.
Draco wants to throw up. His father, and mother are eating without care, and he’s....he’s eating too. He doesn’t want to, but he does, stuffing another mouthful into his mouth.
Lilly in response put her tiny hands on her hips, underneath the cloaks, cringed her nose and curled her lips upwards to sneer at him. 'She'd make a good Slytherin,' he thought. Then she stuck her tongue out.
He knew Potter and Granger were light sleepers. Weasley slept like a rock, but all of them slept with their blinds open. You’d think they’d cover their windows in fear of being seen by outwardly dangers, but they were bloody gryffindors. All mighty, and looking out for danger rather than hiding from them.
The man before him only sighed slightly, and looked up with discontent. “This coming yule ball. You are required to come. I will tell you where and the timing after. You should feel lucky. The Dark Lord has finally decided to take you under his wing, even though you are not of age yet.”
Draco turned again and returned his attention back to the door. Looking around, he grabbed the decorative metal lion that was placed on the stand beside the bed. He raised the heavy object and dropped it down on the door knob, hoping the break it.
Harry didn’t reply, glowering slightly, before getting up, fists clenching slightly. Shit...had Draco gone too far? Had he ruined his progress? Does Potter finally hae him now? Shit shit shit..fuck.
The raven jumped back slightly, keeping his guard up, and careful to stay between Draco and the window. They weren’t going to let him escape easily, but then again, Draco hadn’t expected anything else. He had to act quickly, before the raven’s friends joined him.
From the corner of his eye, he can see the newcomer scoff and its then she decides she doesn't like this man. She frowns slightly, no longer feeling the same excitement she did when they first caught them. Capturing two lone wolves was a good sign. It meant there was a reason the two were lone wolves and not part of a pack. Maybe their pocket had kicked them out...maybe they’d run. Either way, she knows they have information and knowledge that has long been forgotten and lost.
When the cup was emptied, he looked and the face of Molly Weasley came before him. Draco gagged and moved away, in horror. Why was he with a Weasley? A..a
Pansy tapped his shoulder, and motioned for him to get up. Breakfast was probabaly over. This was the time him, Blaise, and Pansy went out to play quiditch, or rather a modified version of it, consisting of only 3 players. Today was class free. At hogwards, there are 5 days with classes, and 2 without. He thanked merlin for these breaks. Without them Draco wasn't sure he'd survive.
Draco took his spot at the Slytherin table. Blaise to his left and Pansy infront of him. He felt horrible. There was a queasy feeling in his stomach, and his head throbbed. Draco knew he should be taking the potions that Pomfrey was giving him, but he just couldn't being himself to. He was afraid. To let himself fall into the oblivion of dreaming. If he slept, Draco feared he might never want to wake up again and he'll fall back into that place again. Draco shivered and slowly crawled out of his thoughts as Pansy's voice came into view.
” the raven growls, pulling his back up by the hair, and pulling hard. Tears leaked from Draco’s eyes, pain growing by every waiting moment. “You think I didn’t have a chat with your other friend before I came up here?”
“Don’t trust me, Mullet?” Draco asked, catching a glimpse of something above his captor’s right eyebrow. Foundation? No..concealer. What would the raven need concealer for? Maybe a scar or a cut.....
He was born to trust, but changed with mistrust, and as Potter's arms tightened around him, he wanted nothing more than to scream. To cry, and yell. To speak. To talk, and to...
Potter nodded in agreement. They got up, dusting their robes off before trotting their way back to the castle.
Draco wouldn’t say he hid...more like run. He’d run. Farther away than any of them, so far they wouldn’t be able to catch up with him. He was running from the top to the bottom, and it was so fucking lonely. So empty.
"Calm?! Potter didn't keep me calm!!He practically forced me down on the bed, just like your doing right now!! I told you I'm fine."
His other hand wavered close to the cuffs of his torn jeans. Draco sucked shit at hand to hand combat, and the raven would probably overpower him in seconds, but that didn’t mean that Draco was going to make it easy. The least he could do was give Blaise some time to escape.
Draco swore he could see the sneer that his father sent him from behind the safety of the mask. “You are no son of mine. You were disowned the moment you turned your back to the Dark Lord.
"Po-Potter," the boy infront of him breathed out and something tugged on Harry. Again. He let it pull him deeper, and smiled when the magic's hold on Malfoy's neck tightened.
“The rain,” Harry hissed, pointing to his covered glasses “hinders my eyesight. It’s like flying blindfolded!”
Draco mentally cursed himself for being as dumb as he was now, but then again could you blame? He hasn’t had “
!! ACTUALLY CHEWING?! You could've choked, and Harry being the dumb Harry he is, wouldn't even know how to unchoke you!!"
Draco choked out a broken sob, laying there curled on Potter’s bed, not really sure what to think, or feel. Wondering why he should have to feel at all. It’s be so much easier...if he couldn’t feel. If he just couldn’t feel a damn thing.
He snatches it from the pudgy hands, opening the crumples mess, feeling warmth spread across his chest. He lets his fingers trace over the figures in the photo, and looking over to the mass of unrecognizable flesh. He smiles sadly, feeling a sense of loss...failure. Knowing he hadn’t been there fast enough to save her.
He looked around at the battle surrounding them, a painful reminder that he was still alive. “What did you do?!” he screamed, trying to get out of the hold, but it was half-hearted. “...
He did not just think of Potter during a conversation like this. He coughed, letting out a small cheeky smile. “Oh father.
Guild pulsed through his veins, but Draco pushed it aside, trying to blink away the tears that threatened to pour from his eyes.
Draco paused. The air had changed again. Suffocating him once again, on the verge of pulling him back under the tides. The water he hated oh so much. After all, he never did learn how to swim.
She cringed at the sound of her full name. Harry never called her by her full name. Never. She could begin to imagine what both Malfoy, and Harry were going through right now. Harry looked so...horrified and it made her want nothing more than to turn back time.
Her eye twitched. What was it with teenagers and trying to do things they can't do when they are injured. First Ron, then Fred, and NOT to mention Harry!
Draco was begging. In this dark world of his, it was all he had. No power. No magic. All he could do was beg, to....to himself. How low had he fallen into this self-pity?
Draco grinned, satisfied, and worked back to turn the mattress back over and pushed off to the corner in its original position. He gripped the spring tight in his palm, the edge sticking out from the space between his fingers.
“Forget it. Tell me how you knew I was out after curfew?” Draco questioned, trying to reel the conversation into another direction.
Harry felt himself drop to his knees, and pull the limp body up in his arms, closer to his own self. Cold. So contradicting from his own. He was warm. Too warm, to the point where it burned. And the feeling of Malfoy's body to his felt better. Gave him a sense of the freshness, a break in this scorching heat. This madness. It made him feel almost...
A chuckle filled the air, and for a moment it caught Draco off guard. “Oh, I know we aren’t friends, Malfoy. In fact, I despise you. Perhaps even loathe you more that Voldemort himself. Though I haven't really decided yet. I mean, you two truly aren’t that far apart. After all, you both have made my life living hell.
Funny, now that she put her mind into it. Her fingers convulsed, the marker slipping past her bruised fingertips, and falling onto the floor, the sound barely audible to her own ears. The snarling, shrieking of the freaks, only a door from breaking away had filled her head. It was almost like music, a melody. Flowing so gently in with the air, putting her mind into a daze. A feeling....music that only she...or rather the unfortunate ones could hear. And an unfortunate never lived long enough to play their soundtrack.
He turned his head around to get a better look at the other's face. Potter face was hanging low, cheeks flushed red, all the way to the tip on his ears, and his gaze low. Kinda cute. Potter was averting his gaze, and that's when the sudden realization dawned upon him.
Blaise looks towards the busier side of the clearing. He can see Harry talking to an older man, and the redhead he’d met earlier talking to another light haired female. He remembers her. He’d seen her before, curled up against the cool glass, arms wrapped around her head, as she rocked back and forth. A monster in the making, and here she was. Laughing, imitating the doctors and nurses she’d grown up around. Fake. An imitation. Around them there was a group of children, playing and scrambling around, emitting an artificial sense of innocence.
It seemed endless. The pain, the fear. This...this endless loop of despair, and utter dreadfulness. He felt weak, vulnerable, and so exposed. The crying faded to a soft throbbing in his head, and the shaking reduced as the potion began to kick in. Eventually Draco found himself laying limp in the bed. Face wet with angry tears. Eyes red and swollen. And his whole body numb. He had gone through the agony, and  now he was laying in hell. The panic attack had done it's worst, but the after affects were seen worse. It made I'm feel lost, devoid. Empty. With no real reason to want to continue. No, Draco didn't want to die, it was just the frustration and the anxiety Nothing else. He didn't want to die. He didn't...
Signing, he crept through the room, salvaging anything that could be of any use. He found a few clean t-shirts in the closet, along with a few pairs of pants. Too big for either of them, but good to keep them warm during the night. The blankets had been taken away from the bed. The group staying here must’ve taken them. He was ready to leave the room, when he caught the glimpse of a picture frame that lay shattered on the ground.
for anything?? Not for wrongly accusing somebody. Not for almost taking my life! You know what?!” Draco yelled. “You should’ve gone right through with it. I have no idea why you even
“You see, we had a nice little chat, that turned a tad bit violent. “We got a little bit, but unfortunately, your little loyal friend passed out on me.”
“Come now, Blondie. You’ll have to try a lot harder than that to kill me.” And there’s that chilling voice again. It’s familiar. The fear. It crawls up Draco’s spine, into the pits of his mind. His hair stands up on the back of his neck, a choked cry forced its way up his throat but stopped half way, fingers shaking.
Aching for the sweet release of death, but not sure if he could handle the guilt of leaving Draco alone.
She couldn't tell. She wasn't sure wheather Malfoy was simply burying his face on the bundle or kissing it softly.
Pansy and Blaise chuckled. They dragged Draco to the great hall, and he sat on the edge of the table, Blaise beside him, followed by Pansy.
How could he even dare to think about getting together with the girl that used to be Cedric's girlfriend whom had died
The bundle in his arms turned again, and this time stuck her head out. She hugged his body closer, and shivered.
She needed to forget about the dark thoughts for once. Right now, it were her children that mattered. How was she to take care of her children if she couldn't even take care of herself?
Ah...fuck. He really was royally fucked. He was too deep in, and with his father snooping around on his every move, Draco wasn’t sure what to do.
Draco rolls his eyes, wondering what his next move should be. Should he tell them? Tell them about the mass of black running up the white of his arm. Tell them about the cure...if it even was a cure. Nonetheless, Draco liked to think it was what could save them all. Gave him hope for a future...a
If there is anything confusing, feel free to ask below, I will try my best to explain without giving away any spoiler. And ye...hope you guys enjoy this chapter. I know it's a bit short, but yeah...I tried adding humour, but like...I'm not too good at that, so it's all I have for now.
"W-what do you need, P-potter?" Damnit. He needed to get a hold of himself. He was stuttering and Malfoys'
With a final attempt of despair, he stomped his foot down upon his captors’ foot, hoping the grip would loosen. It only tightened in return, and Draco was sure if those fingers held any tighter, his wrist would snap in two.
"Yes. But he still was my father. And he's not always been like that. Not at the beginning. The last thing he wanted was to see our name disappear."
He looked behind him only to see an out of breath Harry Potter running towards him. "Potter? What are you doing here?"
"I don’t see why I should talk about my private life with you, Potter, but yes, she does. She’s known from the beginning and she’s okay with that."
Just like his, Astoria’s chambers had three rooms. A reception room, a bedroom and a bathroom. The place was as clear as Draco’s, but with discreet tones of red and gold about everywhere. Draco thought it looked awfully like a Gryffindor’s den, but she always laughed and said she just loved the colours and the warm feeling it gave to the place.
"I’ll go take clean towels. And warm water." Harry said quickly before disappearing in the bathroom again.
Draco met the green eyes and startled for a few seconds. The look on Potter’s face was... weird, suddenly. But he couldn’t quite tell why.
“Oh, yeah. I figured something like that. Sorry, I needed to Floo-call the office and let them know I won’t be coming today. I need to rest too and... I wanted to stay with you. But... I mean, I’ll understand if you wanted to stay alone. Even if I think you shouldn’t after what happened. I don’t know, I...”
“Now I know from where we’ll watch the fireworks, tomorrow.” Draco grinned as he lied down on one of the sunbeds on the terrace.
"Yes, you are. Look, my tapas are all wet. Come on, suck it up, have some decency and go talk to him."
It was a good thing they weren’t alone, because Draco had a sudden and furious desire to jump on the man and make love to him. Harry looked and sounded both respectful and fierce. His eyes were almost glowing, giving goosebumps to the blonde man while his smile was... peaceful and happy.
The door opposite from him opened and a nurse looked at the only couple in the room. "Miss Weasley? You can come in. Sir, you can wait here for now, I'll come for you in a bit."
The both of them smiled at each other. He could have been free, but he chose to have a family instead. But his son, he promised it, would be as free as he wanted to. No matter what.
When Draco told her he wanted to go see his mother in France, she suggested he ask Harry to go with him. To enjoy this time together with Scorpius. And he did. And Harry said yes. So, here they were, on Christmas Day, waiting for an early flight to Nice to be in time for lunch with his mother.
When he entered the living room, Draco had a dreamy smile and a flushed face, which made his wife gently laugh.
But when they were both clean and dressed up, the two men looked at each other in the main room, clearly not really knowing what to do next. Or not ready to do it.
“You mean Harry?” She nodded and bounced Scorpius on her knees nervously. “Yes. Everything’s perfect, Mother.” He studied her face a little. What was she really thinking? She loved him enough to accept his relationship, but that didn’t mean she approved it. “I love him, you know? And he does too.”
“Hey, I’m joking. We fucked every night at your mother’s house. Two nights without sex won’t kill us.”
“Astoria told us she was happy he stayed with you, that she didn’t want you to live all this alone. She said he is a good man. Good for you
At that moment, Draco thought the look on her face was odd, but the feeling was quickly brushed away when a tray with a tea-pot and two cups and biscuits on it appeared on the coffee table in front of them and Astoria almost jump on it.
Absentmindedly, he walked back to his chambers. Too much had happened in the last few hours. The encounter with Potter and all the sex they had both at his office and in his bed, Astoria’s condition and the birth... He just wanted to crash on his bed and not move or think for the next two hours. But when he pushed the door, he immediately saw Potter, waiting for him on the couch. The young man jumped to his feet.
“The only way to save Lady Malfoy’s life was to remove her uterus. I am sorry to tell you that, but your wife won’t have any children.”
Draco sighed in frustration but lied back. Of course, he would need the third finger. He had Potter's cock in his mouth a few minutes ago and could still feel the burn in his throat and how stretched it had been. Plus, he hadn't fuck in weeks, probably months. He definitely needed it. But he wasn't a patient man so, when he started to moan as the three fingers moved deep into him, Draco reached behind and grabbed Potter's black hair.
He screamed when he felt a tongue entering him slightly, joined a minute later by a lubricated finger. That felt amazing! Draco pushed his hips back onto Potter's face and finger, craving for more, then sighed in contentment and moaned when the man added another finger. But when he started to add a third one, Draco whimpered.
The man looked at him for a while. Draco was sure people around them heard the whole talk, but he really couldn’t care.
Draco froze. He was rummaging inside the bag for Scorpius’ bottle and milk, and wasn’t quite sure of what he heard. “Sorry, what?”
"No. I go there from time to time, just to make sure everything's in place. But I can't make myself sell it. Once again, too many memories."
Teddy nodded, apparently very concentrated and Draco got up. Then, he noticed the arrival of Astoria’s parents and excused himself to go greet them.
won't? ‘Cause if it's the latter, the way he’s looking at you right now tells a whole different story, Sweetheart."
They had shaken hands, that night and Potter had congratulated him for his wedding, but nothing more, before the dark-haired man had left with a giggling Aaron – or so he said he was called.
Draco looked at the green eyes. He knew his own grey ones had sadness in them. "Don’t get your hopes too high, Potter."
Harry did ask him if he wanted him to leave once or twice, but Draco would always shake his head and ask him if
"Do you remember the way to my room?" Draco asked when they landed in the manor’s living room. He only used his personal fireplace from time to time, and he made it work only one way: out. The rest of the time, he, Astoria or their guests would use this one. "I have to pass by Tory’s chambers. To see if she’s okay and let her know I’m back."
Harry moved closer and smiled at the baby. “It’s not that. I’m more than happy to be here, as I’ve been for the last month. I just don’t want to make it weird or uncomfortable for you. People don’t really expect to see me here tonight.”
After a few nights of running back and forth from his chambers to Scorpius’ when he would cry, Draco decided to just take his crib to his bedroom and sleep with him next to his bed. At first, it was weird because Scorpius was doing all those little noises when he was sleeping, but he soon got used to it and only woke up when he would actually cry. It was tiring, but he was happy to do it. And the fact that it allowed Astoria to rest and heal was the most important.
“Nothing. It’s just that he’s been here for a whole month, now. We were-” He stopped when his wife coughed a little. “
"Exactly. Oh! That's good!" Je moaned when the dark-haired man took his neglected cock in his hand. "I wanted that too at the time."
But now it was different. The war was over, they were adults, both gay… There could have been something between them, and that's why he stayed tonight, but once again, he was stupid to think that. He wanted Potter. Badly. But the thing was: Potter didn't want him. He was just curious about his life and his choices, that's all. Tonight, Potter would fuck this Kyle guy all night and not think about him at all.
"I said I'll finish my drink. Which should have taken me less than five minutes. I waited more because I'm polite and well-behaved. Something you're clearly not."
Draco smiled when he saw his mother almost running towards them. Her blond hair seemed even lighter that before and her usually pale face had pretty colours. Was it because of sun, or happiness?
“Lady Malfoy is alive. She’s extremely tired and lost plenty of blood, but with a lot of rest and some blood-replenishing Potions, she will be fine.”
"I’ll go find-" Harry started but, at the same moment, Dr Gobler appeared in another crack sound, Poppy beside him.
“Sir? Your wife is awake, but probably not for long. If you want to show the baby to her, now is probably a good time.”
Draco frowned at that. "You don't seem very… aware of it all. Hope your wife is a bit more concerned." It seemed strange to him. Even when he wasn't in love with his wife, he knew everything there was to know about his baby. Maybe… Maybe Potter knocked up the Weasley girl and was just being… responsible? After all, the nurse called her
So, he dressed up, took the floo and landed in the Atrium, ready to shake hands and smile. It worked… for a while. Until his eyes crossed Potter's. He didn't seem surprised to see him there or, if he did, it didn't show on his face. He had nodded at him, acknowledging his presence and Draco had nodded back.
"Yes, Potter. I did. And to have an heir." The man looked at him, speechless so he sighed and explained further. "I'm a Pure-Blood, Potter. I'm sure you know that."
“Harry. You need to calm down. Nothing is going to happen. We’re safe, okay? The three of us. We’re going to board this plane, take off and land in Nice in just two hours. Alright? You don’t have to be afraid. I’ll be with you all the time.”
“Obviously not. Or you wouldn’t have been sleeping in my bed for the past month.” Draco yawned. His eyes felt so heavy.
After a last lick and a playful slap on his butt cheeks, Draco felt the lubricated tip brush at his entry. He tried to relax as Potter slowly pushed inside him, inch by inch. Damn, he was big! The young man gripped the sheets and grunted in discomfort, making Potter freeze.
She smiled again, her eyes going from one man to the other. Draco was used to this kind of situation, even if he didn't bring a lot of men home since their wedding. But he could almost feel Potter's nervousness. Of course, it must be awkward to chat casually with the wife of the man you're going to sleep with. He could have waited a bit longer, sat next to her, have tea, only to see Potter suffer, but he decided not to. Out of kindness? No, mostly out of fear to see the man run away.
The party lasted until late that night, even after Draco put Scorpius to bed. He asked Poppy to take care of him in a nursery for tonight, because he knew they would probably won’t go to sleep early. So, when Draco and Harry finally walked into Draco’s bedroom at nearly four in the morning, they both nearly passed out all dressed up onto the bed.
“Oh, she’s good. I’ll tell her you’re coming today with little Scorpius. I should go, now. The sun is rising. And, congratulations for the birth of your son, Sir.”
Draco looked around the reception room. It was full of people, friends, family, colleagues... They all came to meet Scorpius and it made him happy. He rocked the baby in his arms for a bit, soothing him as he started to whimper, and finally found the man he was searching for. Harry was on the other side of the room, talking to Blaise and Pansy. He walked to him, smiling to guests on the way and stopped next to the man. He wanted to know. He needed it. But was it a good idea to ask him know? What if the answer wasn’t the one he expected? Did he really want to smile all night in front of the others after that?
Her voice was weak, raw with emotions and exhaustion. Draco lifted the baby and carefully put him in Astoria’s arms, still holding a bit to ease the weight.
“I know, Sweetheart. But... do you think it’s a good idea to start a new relationship now? With Scorpius and all... What if he leaves? Having a new-born is never easy.”
He almost fell for it and turned around to check. Almost. He knew his best friend by heart and, of course, she was fooling around. After all, Harry Potter could not be watching him, right?
“Scorpius only needs to burp, then you can change him. I have all his clothes ready on the bed. Will you be okay?”
the baby. But if you don’t try, you’ll have regrets all your life, wondering what could have happened. Trust me, Draco, you don’t want that."
Those words broke something in Draco. No. One night could never be better. It would never be enough. He was afraid that if he took a taste, he won’t be able to live without him. Yet, right now, he knew he wouldn’t be able to say no. Even if he had to suffer after that.
The little creature disappeared and the young man sighed and closed his eyes. He was already exhausted. Good thing it was Sunday, or he would have had trouble focusing all day. Then, the thought of being distracted from work by the feeling of Potter’s cock lingering in his ass made him almost moan.
The man did as told and moved back, pulling his aching member out of the blond man. Draco quickly got up, searched for his pants and put them on, a look of slight terror on his face.
“Hey! I... I went back to Astoria’s room, but the nurse said you left with the baby. So, I came here to wait for you.”
Draco immediately lifted his head from the mattress and turned it to the left, then to the right. Indeed, at the end of the bed, there was a bright orb of light.
"I want you, Malfoy. I always did. I know I was  a dick to you for all those years, but I didn't know what to do, how to act with you, with all those feelings." Draco's eyes widened. Feelings? "You said I had a type, earlier. And you're right, I do.
The said man burst out laughing and went back in Draco’s bedroom to finish dressing up. Tonight was Scorpius’ birth party. The party he and Astoria planned months ago. He wanted to cancel it, wait for her to get better and be there with him, but she told him not to, that he had to have fun, to breathe a little bit, see other people. And, even if it didn’t seem right to do it without her, he accepted. And it was natural for her to tell Harry to stay to. After a month of being here night and day, he had every right to be at Scorpius’ party. For her, he was already a part of the family, even if she didn’t say it to the dark-haired man. She knew Draco’s feeling for him even better than Draco himself, and she knew he had to stay.
“Here Scorpius. This is your room. Look, there are bunnies and dragons everywhere. No need to be scared, they are just here to protect you.” He whispered, afraid to wake him up.
Draco looked at Harry more closely. There was fear in his eyes. Pure terror. Draco put Scorpius back into his carriage and turned towards his lover, took his face in his hands and forced him to look at him.
"Oh! I see." The woman grinned and yawned. "Well, I have no remorse in wanting to sleep, then. Go join your Potter, big man."
"The contractions seem close. Don’t you think?" Draco asked the dark-haired man, his eyes full of worries.
"Yes. Oh God, it hurts so bad!" She cried out and grabbed Draco’s hand again. "I can’t do that! I’m sorry Draco, but I can’t do that! Take him out of me and-"
Draco sighed. “Because Scorpius is way too young for us to apparate or take a Portkey. I don’t want to take any risks. Plus, planes are one of the safest mode of transports. Well, that’s what Muggles say.”
over him so he would sleep a bit more. He wasn’t angry about that. Instead, he would spend long minutes watching the man moving around slowly with the baby in his arms, singing him lullabies until he would fall asleep again.
enter his dreams. But, even asleep, he was the best, so dreams were just dreams. He never crossed Potter again after the night they shared, not even once at the Ministry or at the bar. He heard about Weasley and Lovegood’s daughter’s birth and thought about sending him a congratulation letter, but he didn’t. It was too painful to hope.
“Sorry, Ignatius. Actually, I don’t really know what Harry and I are. He wanted to help me after Scorpius’ birth and given the circumstances, he stayed. But... I don’t know, really.”
Draco moaned loudly when Harry took him in his mouth. He was beyond frustrated since weeks and needed the man so bad. Having him between his legs now, sucking at his cock felt wonderful. And his words, his husky voice against his burning skin... It was driving him crazy. He could feel his tongue licking every inch, his lips closing at the base of his cock, and the sides of his mouth squeezing it. It was wet and warm, and Draco was so sensitive already.
Draco thought about it. As enticing as it sounded, he couldn't do that. "No, Potter. Astoria’s alone, and she’s nearing the term... I really need to go home."
The edges of his lips rose up a bit. How he loved hearing that. “Well, I know you are. What I don’t know is
“Le soir du réveillon est toujours très demandé, mais nous avons toujours des tables réservées exclusivement pour les suites. Je peux donc vous ajouter aux réservations.”
“Don’t push things too quickly. She will come back when the time is right. In the meantime, rest too Dear. I don’t want you to get sick too.”
Their orgasms felt intense and endless. Perfect. When he finally came back on earth, Draco opened his eyes he couldn’t even remember closing. Potter was still on him, breathing heavily and his cock was slowly softening, allowing his cum to run out of Draco’s hole. Legs still spread wide, Draco gently run his hands on the man’s back, giving him time to calm down.
"You know me too well, Tory. It’s almost frightening. Last night was... wonderful, but what if he grows tired of me and decides to leave? He told me he gets bored easily. He may go after a few days, months, or even years. It’ll be painful anyway."
Draco flinched. Her fears mirrored his own almost perfectly. Did that make them more justified? No! Harry promised him he’ll never break his heart. “I know that. But Harry stayed when I most needed help. And he stayed after that. He’s not here only for the easy moments.”
“Yes. Still tired and pale, but better. I was hoping she could spend Christmas with us, but the doctors said it was very unlikely. That it would be too much for her.”
After a two-hour flight and a one-hour drive, they finally arrived in Saint-Raphael and parked in front of Malfoy’s house. It was a pretty villa with white walls and ochre tiles on the roof in a calm neighbourhood. Draco couldn’t really remember the first time he came here, he felt like he did all his life, but knew he always loved it. So, when his mother chose to live here after the war, he was relieved. He knew she would find some kind of peace and happiness there.
He closed his eyes. He couldn’t do that. He just couldn’t. "Don’t say another word. You know I can’t, Potter."
"I'm not going through that explanation again. Sorry, but it's way too late for that." He started to turn away, ready to leave. But Potter grabbed his arm.
When they reached the bed, they helped the pregnant woman lie back on it. Draco turned on the lights with a flip of his hand.
asked. If I didn’t, you probably would have started by that. Or we would still be mute like two idiots."
Hair as wild as ever, tight jeans and tight T-shirt, green eyes sparkling under the bar's lights… It was almost ridiculous to see how attractive he was that night. Everyone else noticed too, but apparently, he was not being very discreet about it all.
Now, he was just an inch away from Draco, clearly waiting for a sign, a word from the former Slytherin to kiss him, and Draco desperately wanted to, But… it was Potter. Could he trust him? Could he… surrender to him? Plus, there was the rule: no love story until the baby's birth. He wasn't sure he could stay away from Potter once he'd have a taste of him.
Then, the man walked to him again and took him in his arm, sticking their foreheads together. "Call me Harry."
"You’ll wait for me?" Draco nodded and Harry smiled. A big, wide smile that made Draco’s heart flutter. "Good. Then I’ll wait for you too. And, when you’re ready, I’ll fight for you. And for the baby."
Draco knew how it looked. Him waiting for Potter like that, but he couldn't make himself move, because after years of preventing his own happiness, of making choices for everyone else beside himself, he wanted to act selfish, for once. The most selfish thing to do right now was to wait for Potter.
The morning after, the sunlight woke the young men up, shining brightly through the large window. They both grunted, but after a few touches that led to heated kisses, they were more than awake. They quickly fucked again, Potter making Draco scream his name in ecstasy, and ended up in the shower, kissing and washing each other.
Draco and Harry took the luggage out of the car’s trunk and followed her into the house. The amazed look on Harry’s face made Draco laugh. The house was very pretty inside too. Warm and cosy, nicely furnished. The main room’s walls were all white and the brownish tiles on the floor felt welcoming. The dining room had a long oval-shaped table surrounded by ten chairs. On the left, three steps lower, was the living-room with comfy-looking armchairs and a wooden coffee table. On the right was the kitchen, not big but modern and practical. The three rooms all had French-doors opening on the covered terrace, the swimming-pool and the garden. The last rooms on ground floor were two bedrooms and two others were on first floor.
?" The green eyes widened. "Oh! You thought that…" Then, he burst out laughing. Draco was a bit annoyed by that reaction. What was so funny? "Gin and I are not together! I just came with her because Luna couldn't. That's all!"
"… and Pure-Bloods fancy having an heir. A male one, preferably, but I'm not the kind to care about that. Plus, it was my father's last wish for me to marry and follow the Malfoy's bloodline."
"Oh. Well… That's good. So, what now? Do you want to go back and have another drink? Talk a bit longer?"
When he exited the bedroom, she was already fast asleep. Except for the nurse, the living-room area was empty. No sign of Harry. His heart fell a bit at the thought that he left without saying goodbye. Maybe this was just too much for him? Maybe he realised what it meant to be with Draco? That know the baby was born, it couldn’t be just a game between the two of them. Maybe Potter was just not that serious about all that, after all.
He couldn’t. He just couldn’t tell him that everything changed the minute he took his arm that night. That now, he desperately needed him in his life. More than anything.
Arrived at the end of the West Wing, he knocked on the door and entered without waiting for an answer.
“The bathroom. It’s next to the bedroom, so we can hear Scorpius if he wakes up. I just want to blow you so you won’t be all excited when we go out for dinner.”
Draco rolled his eyes and gave him his drink before seating on one of the couches, soon followed by Potter. "Of course, with Astoria! Did you forget what I said about children born out of wedlock? And, I don't know. We may consider it in the future, if we're still married and if Tory wants to. I won't force another pregnancy on her."
The month following Scorpius’ birth went by both quickly and desperately slowly. For the first days, they had daily appointments at St Mungo’s to monitor him and see if everything was okay. Then, when it was clear the baby was as good as he could be, the appointments went to once a week. For Astoria, however, things were a bit more complicated as she didn’t seem to recover very well. She was more and more exhausted; the pain wasn’t fading away and the paleness of her face made Draco’s heart stop each time he entered the room. The only times she seemed fairly alive was when she had Scorpius in her arms. She would feed him at least once a day, but Draco would take care of the other meals. He wouldn’t let Poppy or another House Elf feed the baby. Even at night.
"Relax, Malfoy. Even if there is someone, the offices are soundproof when they’re closed. Mine’s the only opened door right now."
She widened her eyes. “That is what my father used to say. Thank you, Mr Potter. I really appreciate your gift.” Draco took Harry’s hand in his discreetly and squeezed it. The man didn’t tell him about this gift, only that he had an idea about what to offer to his mother. Narcissa reached into the Christmas tree and took a white envelope. “Here. It’s for both of you.”
Draco took a while to recover, fighting back the tears. He didn’t want to appear in front of Astoria looking like that. Then, he glanced at the clock hanging above the fireplace and saw it was nearly noon. A bit late for breakfast. But he knew that, at this hour, he would find Astoria in the living room and decided to join her for a late cup of tea. On his way, he thought about his unexpected night with Potter. They had fucked all night and all morning and he felt so sore, but also entirely satisfied. He remembered the kisses too, both sweet and mind-blowing. And the words whispered against his skin, the sighs of pleasure, the heated looks...
"Good. Boring. Daphne came to visit with Oliver. He is so sweet. I really hope our son will be that sweet!"
“If it can appease you. I promise you, Draco, that I will not disappear from your lives. I promise you that I will tell you if anything happens. And I promise not to break your heart.”
What he did tonight… Drooling over Potter, talking to him about his private life, waiting for him… Merlin, he was clearly stupid! But he knew
"Nothing as deadly, but not far. I could lose a lot, Potter, but mostly, I could lose my son, if I was to break this vow."
“And here I thought we would have to be discreet in bed. Finally, I can make you scream all night without worrying about your mother’s look the next morning.”
Draco took his hand and pulled him on the bed with him. He lied on his back, legs spread wide open and Potter settled between them, his hands automatically grabbing his thighs.
"Okay. We... We have to go to St Mungo's. Now!" Draco turned around and found Harry standing on the doorstep. "Potter! There’s a bag in the bathroom. Can you-"
“No buts. Tomorrow... well, today, we sleep in. That’s final. Poppy will come if needed, but not before noon. At least!”
"I was just startled. That you’re gay." He added when Draco threw him a questioning look. "I didn’t know."
“Oh, it’s good you’re here, Harry Dear. I feel relieved to know Draco’s not alone to face all that. Even if they are cute, taking care of a baby alone is hard. No matter how much you love them.”
“Sorry, Mother. We had trouble tucking Scorpius in this stupid baby seat.” He looked at Harry, both their eyes bright with amusement. They had trouble, indeed, installing the baby in the car. And after fifteen minutes of pushing and pulling, they had both seemed to remember they were wizards and spelled it correctly in place.
"Well, I'm a nice person, Malfoy." Potter's grin widened when Draco rolled his eyes. "But, I'm the baby's father, so it's natural that I came."
“Why would it be? I want you to be here, Tory wants you to be here... I don’t see why you shouldn’t be.”
Draco moaned both at the words and the feeling of Potter moving in him. He knew he was tight. It was, in his opinion, one of his best assets.
Draco didn’t move. The moment the woman put his son in his arms, his eyes locked on the little chubby face. He seemed so peaceful, so... perfect. Draco’s heart swelled with love and pride. His son was born. He was right here in his arms. Draco was holding him and the world didn’t stop. It would be perfect if Tory was there too. But right now, he couldn’t think about that. He only felt Potter getting closer when the man put his chin on his shoulder to look at the baby too.
Draco, now Lord Malfoy thanks to his father's death in Azkaban, had been invited by his future father-in-law, Ignatius Greengrass, a close acquaintance of the Minister. He had thought of not going, given his past, but decided that if he wanted to clean his name and reputation, a ball at the Ministry was a good place to start.
too much? She offered us a cruise, Draco! That’s awesome and I’m super happy to spend a full week on a boat with you, but like you said, it’s way too much! How can we thank her?”
“How is she?” It was Harry that talked as Draco was way too lost to think about anything else than his son.
“Because you never let me.” Harry moved even closer and gently kissed Draco’s lips. “I love you, Draco Malfoy. I've wanted more with you for years; I was attracted to you. But since that first night we slept together… it all changed. It's not only physical, far from it. You made me fall in love with you.”
But after a few minutes of light touches and silence, Potter came off his body with a sigh and slowly took his member out of Draco. The move made him moan, both at the feeling and at the loss. He loved having him inside, to feel so full he could hardly move. And now, as Potter was searching for his wand to clean both of them, Draco felt emptier than ever. As if Potter made a hole in him that could never be filled again. Suddenly, the young man felt like crying. But he couldn’t. He had to hold back his tears until Potter’s gone.
Draco nodded and relaxed as much as he could. Slowly, Potter made his way inside his body and finally settled with a sigh. Draco moaned as he kissed the back of his neck in an attempt to distract him from the pain, but it wasn’t really enough. The burning sensation was there, sharp, but he knew it won’t last. So, the blonde man rolled his hips under Potter’s and whimpered a bit. He felt so full.
Draco sighed in the kiss. Finally. After guessing it for so long, he finally could hear him say it. The young man rolled on his side too and wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders to deepen the kiss. But as he wanted to take things further for the first time in a month, Harry let go of his lips, laughing slightly as he whimpered at the loss.
He walked to the changing table, laid him on it carefully and looked into the bag he took with him. The one Harry went to fetch in Astoria’s bathroom, where all the baby’s stuff was. He took the little onesie with bunnies on it, plus a diaper and started to dress his son. This was something he longed to do. Change him, dress him, just take care of him. He took his time, enjoyed the privileged moment and, when Scorpius was all set and miraculously still asleep, he laid him in his crib, all warm in his bumper. A part of him wanted to stay here and watch at the baby for hours, but he knew he had to sleep for at least two hours before going to St Mungo’s with him. He thought about taking the crib with him, but decided otherwise.
Potter looked sad, but nodded and kissed him. "Alright. I missed you, you know? But I try to be patient."
The man moaned again and pushed him to sit on the desk, his legs wrapped up around Potter’s waist. Potter prepared him quickly, inserting one finger after the other and, when he felt he was ready, he pushed his cock inside Draco in one swift thrust. It made Draco moan so loudly he feared someone would hear him in one of the other offices, but when Potter started to move in him, he forgot all about it. It was quick. A few well-angled thrusts and Draco was coming all over his belly. A few more, and Potter was releasing his seed deep inside of him.
His chambers were a good example of this change. A large and bright living room welcomed the guests with two big couches placed in front of a fireplace, a heavy carpet had been thrown on the wooden floor and a library, which took an entire wall, was full of books. On the opposite wall, two windows allowed sun to flood the room with light during day time. A door across the fireplace led to the bedroom. There, his king-sized bed took almost all the space, the white linen sheets bright and spotless. The only other furniture were two white wooden side-tables on each side of the bed and a comfy chair under the only but big window. On the wall, just above the bed, a beautiful painting was hung, showing the moor of Scotland, one of Draco's favourite places on Earth. Pansy was the one who painted it and he adored it. Two other doors in the bedroom led to a dressing-room for one and to en-suite bathroom for the other. Large, white marble everywhere, two more windows as it was on the corner of the manor, a huge tub and a walk-in shower… classical, but lovely.
Harry and Narcissa looked at each other for a moment, a certain comprehension passing between them. Then, the woman smiled and called for her House Elf to bring the drinks and toasts.
“You’re a Wizard too, in case you forgot. And you took the plane before, for that World tour of yours.”
"Well, we'll be going, now." He heard a discreet relieved sigh next to him and grinned. "I'll be in my chambers if you need me, Tory."
During the kiss, he could feel Potter’s sex growing hard again and it made his respond. He moved his hand down and grabbed his partner’s member, giving it a few strokes. Then, the young blond man rose from the bed to go sit on Potter’s hips, never ending the kiss. He rolled his hips a bit, moaning when the man’s tip brushed against his sensitive hole.
"So," he moved his kisses lower, on Draco's chest and belly. "you were more jealous of the fact we could be openly gay, right?"
"Huh?" Draco, whose head was still buried in the pillows, didn’t notice the change. But he did notice Harry’s stillness. "Why are you stopping?"
“Hello there, my boy. How cute you are.” The baby looked at her curiously, then to his father, and stretched. “Oh... you’re so big, already! I can’t believe you’re three-month old, now.”
"Potter! Wait!" He shouted before changing his mind again. The man stopped, and turned to look at him, a glimpse of hope clear in his eyes. "You were right. You
"It's because I had to grow up faster and handle things I shouldn't have. You too, when I think of it. It's a mystery how you're still such a child after the life you had."
"Well, well! I thought I would not be seeing you today, Darling. How was your night? You seem... satisfied!"
They both walked to the fireplace and stood before it, awkwardly. Then, Potter grabbed Draco’s arm and pulled him in a kiss. When they parted a few minutes later, foreheads against one another, they sighed in contentment. It was weird. Draco felt both happy and sad. He hoped this night was just the beginning of something, but also feared that it was the only time they could be together like that. And this last thought was devastating.
“We just went to see her before coming here. That is why we are a bit late. She seems better, don’t you think?”
When he walked back to their seats with a wiggling Scorpius in his arms, Harry looked and smiled apologetically at him.
“Yes, before we boarded. But he didn’t eat everything, so I guess he’ll be hungry again soon. Oh! I forgot his bag in the car!”
"…Potter? What do you mean, exactly?" He wasn't sure. He heard the words, but his brain couldn't understand their meaning. He was afraid to understand.
For a long minute, Draco remained silent and immobile in the living room, his eyes staring at the closed door. Then, he broke down and fell on his knees. And Harry was immediately by his side, taking him in his arms and talking to him silently. He couldn't hear what he was saying, words didn't matter. Only his presence, the sole anchor preventing him from sinking into despair. He stayed motionless in his embrace as they waited long and endless minutes. It seemed like hours, but he didn't really know. He didn't really care actually. All he cared about was behind this closed door. His wife and baby fighting for their lives and one question haunting his mind all of a sudden, almost out of nowhere: since when, exactly did he started thinking about Potter as
The blonde man nodded and Harry took his fingers out. He stepped down from the bed and undressed himself under the hungry grey eyes.
Helped by Harry, Draco settled on the man’s hips and directed his member to his entry, sitting on it easily. He swirled his waist a bit, tightened his hole around the hard-on into it and started to move up and down, making them both moan.
They climbed the massive, white marbled stairs silently, then took a large corridor on the right. There were doors on each side, a heavy carpet on the floor, paintings on the walls and, after a turn left, a few other doors. Draco led the man to the last one and opened it, revelling a large room that let the Saviour speechless.
The young man nodded and helped his wife open her sleeping gown and settle the baby on her left breast. He then watched in awe as Scorpius frown slightly and instinctively found the nipple and sucked at it. The view was fascinating. To see his wife feed their son for the first time, when a few minutes ago he thought she wouldn’t make it. He should be jealous of this link he would never have with the baby, but he was simply amazed and happy. Utterly and truly happy.
"Sorry, I just can’t help it." He climbed on the bed and kissed her forehead. "Hello lovely. How was your day?"
"Well, sorry to tell you that, Potter, but you sure need to higher your standards. You seem to have a type, but I’m sure there’s some pretty blond guys out there who are more than just good fucks."
“Oui. Il est déjà installé dans la chambre. N’hésitez pas à appeler le service d’étage si vous souhaitez changer la disposition.”
"What? There’s still someone?" As he wasn’t answering, Draco took a book on the desk and threw it at the laughing man. "Potter! Answer me! Did someone hear us fuck? I’ll kill you! I swear I will!"
So, when the meeting ended, Draco quickly left the room, not staying to talk to the other board members like he usually did. He almost ran to the elevators and sighed when one of them opened immediately. But, of course, unlucky as he was, Potter entered it right before the doors closed.
Draco felt Harry pull at his arm and followed him, powerless as two women appeared only to run into the bedroom, closing the door behind them.
“Okay.” Harry mumbled a cleaning spell, then slid a finger between Draco’s ass cheeks and pushed against his entry. “How do you want it, Baby?”
Then, after five days, they finally left for Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat on the Thursday and discovered the Grand Hotel du Cap Ferrat. Harry watched in awe as Draco checked them in at the desk in fluent French.
Draco nearly laughed at his aunt’s choice of words. Andromeda Tonks was cooing over his son, her 6-year-old grandson Teddy Lupin playing with Harry. The younger man who was the little boy’s godfather, was delighted to see him and Draco cursed himself for not telling him he would be here.
"I did wait, Potter. For thirty minutes. But when I realised you were busy with Blondie… Kyle, I left. I have better things to do than wait for you to stop playing around, Potter."
He was good at it and knew perfectly well how to drive the other man crazy. He sucked on Potter's member, rolled his balls between his fingers, licked at the tanned sensitive skin around his groin, again and again, his eyes never leaving Potter's, studying his face and reactions.
"Sorry. But what I meant is that even if I fucked a lot of men, I never felt like that with any of them. You’re... everything I waited for. At first, I thought it was just some sick obsession from the past, but it’s clearly not. I think I’m-"
They looked at each other for a while, smiling, until a soft cry made them look at Scorpius. All diverted he was, Draco had let the baby bottle’s nipple slip out of his mouth, and he seemed rather angry at that.
"Thanks, Malfoy." He smiled brightly and knocked his glass against Draco’s, before taking a long sip. "Twenty-four, huh? Time flies..."
“Fuck! You feel so good, Draco. Keep going. Faster.” Harry helped him by moving his hips up to meet his ass.
"They’re both doing great. Ginny’s been wonderful and she and Luna are delighted. Little Pandora is... She’s adorable!"
The man remained silent for a long while. Enough for Draco to finish his drink and get up to refill it. Then, when he came to sit again, the look on Potter’s face had changed. He seemed almost resigned.
The way he moaned his name made Draco go crazy. He pushed the man against his desk and pulled at his shirt, breathless.
He didn't say another word and grabbed Draco's blond hair, pulled his face down and kissed him. Hard. Finally! Draco didn't notice how badly he wanted that, until his lips were on Potter's. It felt so good! Potter's lips were soft and plump against his, and tasted like whisky and cinnamon. The man was a damn good kisser! He licked Draco's lips, nibbled on them, bit them and, when Draco opened his mouth to moan, he shoved his tongue inside, exploring every inch of it.
“That went well.” Harry mumbled, lying on his back, head on his folded arms. Draco was in a similar position, only he was on his belly.
"Yeah." They fell silent until Potter spoke again, searching for his words. "You were... wonderful, Malfoy."
Draco and Harry watched the man and one of the nurses disappear in the fireplace. He couldn’t believe how close they were to disaster. A bit longer, and Astoria would be dead.
A minute later, they were in the bed, naked, Draco in Potter’s arms, his nose hidden in the tanned neck. As he was nearly falling asleep, Draco heard the younger man mumble something in his hair.
He resisted turning around to look at what was holding him behind but, after nearly thirty minutes, he gave up and looked over his shoulder, only to gasp. There he was, the little shit, almost lying over a table, is tongue deep inside Blondie's mouth. What a way of dumping someone!
"Well, let’s just say I get bored easily. Kyle, for example. I met him last Saturday at a party and I’m trying really hard not to tell him to leave right know."
Then, he offered his arm to the man and, a second later, they both disappeared with a 'Crack' sound.
They stepped into the guest house and dropped the luggage in the nice living-room. Draco didn’t have to check the two bedrooms. Merry was as efficient as Poppy.
It was a bit weird to talk to his in-laws about the man he was sleeping with. But when he married Astoria, they had talked it out and made things clear from the very beginning. And after four years, the idea of him being gay and not spending his whole life with their daughter finally worked its way in their brains.
Draco didn’t care at the moment and ran out of the bedroom while trying to put his shirt on. He ran through the hallways, his heart beating loudly against his ribcage. He thought about everything that could be happening. To his wife and to the baby. But he refused to panic. He had to be strong, no matter what. He stormed into Astoria’s bedroom only to find her sitting on the floor, with tears flowing down her face.
Potter immediately walked to him and took him in his arms. “Of course, I will. Come on, let’s have some sleep.”
He wants to say goodbye, but knows it’s better if he doesn’t. It’s easier to think that he is only doing this so Draco wouldn’t have to suffer more.
Molly had gotten her ingredients and everything out. The over heating at 345 degrees and the cake batter ready and prepared. Her mind was only on the cooking. She pulled out the cutting board ready to cut the chicken into pieces and hummed the tune to an old ballroom dance song. The one to which she had first danced with Arthur. Oh, those days were a delight.
Another sharp pain exploding to the side of his jaw, reeled him back from his thoughts, leaving him hacking and coughing on the floor below. The ropes dug deep on his wrist, and the chair rough, and cutting ragged scraped against his pale structure.
“Don’t what?” Potter asked, tilting his head a little in confusion. How dare he? He knew exactly what Draco was talking about!
"Really Potter, I always knew you were a little cracked here and there, didn't expect you to be completely broken." Draco grins and looks up at the storming cloud before him. "Such a shame though. It looks like the all so mighty saviour might not be strong enough to protect us all. Let alone himself." Draco paused for a moment, letting himself think of the right words. "How...
The words hit like needles in his heart. They hurt, and along with them took away the last bit of hope he had lurking beneath. Was this how badly his own words had hurt others?
"Shut it, Potter! I-I have a..essay due tomorrow..and since I was busy being kidnapped, I couldn't do it! I don't know about you, but I don't plan on failing."
Draco imagines the curly black hair, the gloriously tanned skin with he splatter of freckles, and the smell of cheap cologne dripping off from his shirt. The one he seemed to wear every fucking day.
It was a problem. It was a huge problem. Something Draco wouldn’t have even considered if it had been two years ago. He couldn’t fall in love with the son of his father’s blood sworn enemy...but merlin was he hot.
Maybe a little longer. A bit longer on this carousel and then the pain would be reduced to small shimmering tingles growing just under his skin. Spreading slowly like the virus he knows all too well, only it would bring peace. And unlike the virus, the numbness would bring silence.
Like a mad dog starved for months, Draco made a wild dash for the dagger, gripping it tightly as he backed away from both sides. Granger let out another howl, and Draco placed the dagger up to his throat. “Stop father...”
He doesn’t waste time dwelling on what is pointless. Only knows he must be alert, and awake, looking around for anything that would be remotely helpful to getting him
He tried again and again, still with no success. He felt his struggles get weaker and his arms trembling. Curse his arm strength. Time to resort back to words. It seemed to be the only weapon he got, and if he reached for his wand Potter would have caught him in no time. Quidditch reflexes.
Fear came sprawling out from the back of his mind. Taking over, and consuming. He trembled, and a few tears that he'd been holding back pour down  his cheeks. So once the first tear broke free, the rest followed in an unbroken steam. He was scared. What if they weren't here? Would he and Lilly be left here to huddle infront on their porch until death comes visit them? Would this be all he'd be able to do for Lilly? His final birthday gift to her..would be death?
? What did Madame Pomfrey? Panic slowly crept across Harry's mind, and he unconsciously brought his hand up biting the dead skin and peeling it off slowly.
“Names,” Harry demanded, and Draco wanted nothing more than to bash that stupid face in against the wall.
And there he is. The cold grey eyes staring and judging, looking for something Blaise doesn’t know. He breathes...it’s just one breath in and one breath out, and yet he can’t seem to understand why it is so difficult.
And Draco attacks, lunging at the other with the spring in hand and aimed straight for the head. His prey stepped out of the way, but Draco didn’t waste any time on a second attempt, instead darts towards the rusty door. By the time Harry realizes what he is about to do, it is already too late. He slips past the door, shutting it behind him and twists the latch shut.
me!! You locked the damned door!!!!" Draco yelled, twisting and pulling on the knob frantically in an attempt to escape.
Blaise facepalmed. "It's a muggle saying draco! It's like a short from of asking someone what they are doing..or how things are going."
Draco scrambled to the limp body, and brushed the snow off her face, and layed her head in his lap. He patted her cheek, calling out her name.
Pansy gasped and pouted before reaching over the table to grab 2 pancakes and proceeded to drown them in syrup.
And as for why Draco refers to Harry as "it" in the end of the chapter will be revealed later on in the story, but few free to speculate!
"B-But he..he-" Draco thought about telling Madame Pomfrey about the incident. He knew very well that she wouldn't believe him. Like how ever could
He smiled at the irony of it all. Just like these footsteps, he too would make a hole in the snow. One everyone would be able to see, but it would only be a matter of time before the snow covered it all up. Only a few moments before he became invisible, if he wasn’t already.
With that, he made a false charge for the raven. The other prepared himself. His hands were bare, no doubt ready to use his fists. The boy seemed unfazed with the knowledge of having no weapon, and his eyes narrowed in dangerous over-confidence.
Harry heard another muffle of protest, and the body underneath his twisted again, in a futile attempt to get free. Malfoy glared at him and Harry let out a chuckle.
Just big black nothingness, and the melody playing by the unfortunates. It was getting louder. She could hear the snarling and the gurgles. The shrieks and screams that drowned her own. The head of the pistol pressed deeper into her forehead, and she closed her eyes, trying to imagine the setting sun of the Cuban beaches. The waves of water rushing up to her ankles as her feet sunk slightly into the sand. The breeze dancing through her wet hair, as the salty smell of the ocean would engulf her senses. And the sunset.
Harry walked back to him, and crouched down to his height. He tapped Draco’s cheek mockingly, who in return just pulled away from the touch. “Oh, but I would....
Days went by, and Draco spent more and more of his nights in Harry’s room. They talked and argued. Laughed and fucking
She let out a cry of despair, as the doors from the other side of the warehouse burst open. The unfortunates sweeping in, tongues sticking out like slobbering dogs in a heat. Stumbling on their feet, climbing on top of each other, in a race to see who could get to her first.
” Draco screamed, trying to push the raven off him. He thrashed around in the cage that Potter’s arms had created. “LET GO!!”
The bed dipped, and Draco bit his lip bracing for the agony that was to follow. “Hold still...this might pinch a little.”
"Oh? And you aren't going to become one? Not going to follow behind your father's steps and become a mindless slave to that lord of yours? Voldemort."
Malfoy glared, and with a final force he pushed at Harry again, managing to throw off the grip. Harry staggered and Malfoy would have gotten away.
was. But knowing his father as the coward he was, he wouldn’t as much as utter a hint about him and it was wiser to do so. He unconsciously rubbed a hand on his trembling wrist, and swallowed his growing nerves. “Y-yes, father.”
Potter!? First with the nonsense with the photos, and now this?! Accusing him for the photos was one thing. But this?!
He picks up the marker laying not too far from her body, and writes on the wall. Writes and writes, until her name is bold and bright and high for everyone to see. He writes it once. Twice. Over and over again, covering the entire mass of the concrete floor and the pillar where she’d been laying.
Fuck. There was no window in this room. They knew. They’d known all along that they were being followed. It all made sense now. No one was up on watch-duty. He hadn’t seen anyone. The food had been left unguarded in a room
"What the fuck, Draco?" he muttered. Draco gaped, and Potter gave him a confused look, unaware of is mistake. He'd called him Draco.
Harry frowned. Sure he got this overexposure thing, but a part of what Malfoy was saying seemed to be rather
Just like there had been no one for her. Crying, he kicked at the freak, trying to get away from her grasp, but it was relentless, scratching and clawing out for him. Her eyes black, and soulless. And the hate. Gods, the hate.
Draco groaned and tried to pull away again. He could feel the croud growing around them, and every now and then a wave of nausea would hit Draco ceasing all his movement for a few moments.
Harry didn't hesitate. Not when he used 'Crucio' on Bellatrix. Not when he almost cursed Petter Pettigrew to oblivion when he'd killed Cedric. So why now? Why was he
Holding back a small chuckle, he spoke to the door, speaking a some phrase in Parseltongue., smiling when Malfoy shivered. The door opened and Draco bolted out, half running, half walking, and almost stumbling in the process.
Draco gulped, trying to crawl further back into the chair, but in no avail. The man reached forward grabbing his jaw in a bruising grip forcing Draco to keep his gaze locked with the raven, and he had to bite his lip to keep from crying out in pain. “Name Blondie,” the Raven stated out, no longer a question but a demand.
Draco forced himself to look down at Lilly. She...she wasn't awake. She probably fell asleep...yeah, that was about right...WAIT! what if she wasn't sleeping?What f the cold had taken over her? What if she...she was-
Silence. Nobody knows why he should stay alive. No one wants him. No one needs him. Maybe they did, but not for the him...they didn't want
"Ok ok..just calm down," Harry spoke, voice still muffled with his sleep. He got up again, carefully climbing back into the bed. He raised his hands up in surrender when Malfoy's foot lifted again. "Woahohh Malfoy...calm..no one needs to get hurt here. Ok?"
"Why the bloody not??? You are supposed to help me!!! YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A MY FRIEND!!! MY BEST FRIEND AND THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT ME!@***#&***@**!!!!!"
” he whined, throwing himself deeper into the pillow he was snuggling against, feet rocking back and forth. “It’s bad...it’s really bad.”
The trio remained quiet before him, and Draco raised his head to look at them. “How did you all manage to secure such a place..if you were new here.”
Black filled his vision, and Draco let out a broken sob. Heart clung to the edge of his skin as goosebumps spread across his forearm like wildfire. White masks, adorned with black brail, came before him, covering the beautiful sunset. A pair of arms grabbed him from behind the armpits, pulling his broken figure up.
Red dribbled out from his swollen lips, pooling up on the floor. Draco let out a small groan, pulling himself back up from the hunched position on the floor. “D-does it really matter?”
He wonders if this is what those people he’d helped down in the facility’s basement felt like. Caged and trapped like some wild animal, only Draco was barely wild. More broken and worn out with the never ending wind. And tired.
, like the rest of his body. The thick atmosphere was still there, making it difficult for him to breath even though there was nothing to choke him. So why? Why did it feel like he was sinking. Drowning. His movement slow as if he were moving in water.
“It’s not the same,” Draco grumbled, thinking back to the time Harry hugged him, holding him close, and refusing to let him go. It wasn’t the best way to get Draco to calm down, but hey! It worked, and now that he thinks about it, it was definitely worth it.
He caressed her head, feeling, trying to feel, but couldn't.  His hands were too cold to feel anything. If Lilly was sick, or injured, or...worse. He didn't know.
“But you love me the same!” Harry winks playfully, and Draco doesn’t know how to explain the raven how much he actually loves him. Gods, he loves him so much..it’s almost unbearable.
A gust of magic hit Draco's head and he stumbled back. His senses dulled, and Potter's panicked voice became distant in the background. Why didn't Draco feel afraid right now? Why didn't his heart thunder, and his breath quicken?
"Yup, they won't! I won't let them! And guess what? You can even grow your hair, and wear dresses, with a sunflower hat! You'd like that wouldn't you?"
"Let me finish...I didn't come here looking for a place to stay or for my own protection. I wanted to request protection and a shelter for my sister. She's innocent. Just a child. I can't let her get caught up in this war."
Neither of them had seen another human other than their own pair in weeks. He turned to give Blaise a knowing look, but the raven only shook his head. “No,” Blaise whispered. “We...can’t trust them.”
Thick ropes whipped out from the light at the tip of the wand, wrapping themselves around him. They dug into skin, the twine like the blade of a dull knife.
” the raven behind him ordered, and as if on cue, the redhead dug his knife deeper into Blaise’s neck. “Or your friend over there–”
“I’m no–” Draco didn’t have a chance to reply, before a wet glob of mud found its way to his neck, splattering up his chin, and all the way up to his nose. He gaped, wiping the dirt from his lips with his sleeve, and swallowed in annoyance.
His lips curved up ever so slightly, at the thought. Maybe they’d make Lily one of those horrid Weasley sweaters. She’d
He swiped his tongue over his lips, feeling the saltiness of his own tears. He’s started to cry. Draco hadn’t noticed. He continues nonetheless.
'But these...these experiments,' he thinks remembering what they had said before, 'are no better.' They were just the same.
Harry was only trying to understand. Trying to figure out what he was missing, which now it seemed was nothing. And the more he tried, the harder it got for him to push out the image of a sobbing, broken Malfoy. It was fake.
"You might as well just drink the syrup for breakfast." Draco said. Pansy only grinned in response. She frowned when she looked down at the empty plate before him.
Determined, and slightly annoyed at how easily this short-ass could keep him down, he bit down on Potter's shoulder.
"What the fuck, Draco?" Harry spoke, rubbing a hand on his head, trying to ease the slight sting, where Malfoy had just seemingly kicked him.
” he croaks out, voice so quiet, Harry wouldn’t have heard it if it weren’t for the pin drop silence in the chamber.
I just want to thank everyone who has read this story, leaving kudos, and such supporting comments, I really appreciate every single one of them. they all inspire me to write more, and I know I've been lazy with my updating, but I'm kinda stuck at the moment.
He twisted the captured hand and tried to pull it out of the death grip that Potter had graciously bestowed upon him. When failing to do so, he scratched at the other's hand, pinched it, even dug his nails in the flesh hard enough to see the red starting to pool up in little drops. Potter, on the other hand only tightened his hold, and continued to argue with Pansy as though Draco hadn't fazed him one bit.
No. There was no need for guilt!! Malfoy had it coming. He's cruel, vile, and absolutely pathetic. To top it off, he's a death eater. Malfoy supports Voldemort, for Merlin's sake and after what he did to Ginny, he
“Draco..” His father’s voice is soft. Something, Draco hasn’t heard in a long time. He finds warmth in the lies hidden behind that spark of love. “Put the knife down.”
Draco closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sends his thanks to whatever gods are still on his side. The monster is a fucking idiot.
Malfoy, he was trying to walk away...he was trying to leave, and occasionally losing his balance, but somehow managing to stay on his feet.
He needed to fly to get out and to fly he needed the broom, and if he gave the broom or potions to Potter, then he wouldn’t get out, and if he wouldn’t get out and if he didn’t get out he’d endanger everyone's lives here...he’d be the reason they died.
“Positive.” the raven stated, his face mostly dark from the lack of light, but the gleam of green in his eyes was unmistakable.
It was just to avoid more conversation, Draco told himself, but even he knew his own lies. The bed was comforting, and Draco was a fucking selfish human being. If Blaise was taking a nice long nap than so can he. It’s only fair...besides what could a few hours hurt?
part. To think that Potter still truly believed that it was him behind the pictures. To think that Potter would compare him to..to
Her wand pointed forward, ready for someone to barge in. The being on the other side, banged at the door. Molly expected the door to crash open any minute, but instead, the violent bangs on the door faded slowly, and soon turned into soft, weak tapping. She could hear the scratching and the soft mumbles. Confused she stepped a little closer.
Draco ignored the first question. He had once known the answer to that one, but no more. “You won’t be getting
It’s empty, and the smell of fresh meat and fruit still busting through his nostrils. He feels full. Every ounce of his stomach stuffed with the contents of his plate. His lips tug up the slightest bit, and Draco looks up at the rest of the members around the table.
The raven tightened his grip on his wrist that held the knife, and growled as a warning. He could hear the creaking of his bones as they were crushed harder. Draco didn’t dare let go of his knife.
"Yes yes, I heard. Malfoy is up to something..again. Now why does Dumbledore want you to make Malfoy fall for you?"
“What do I have to agree to?” Draco asked again, when the raven pulled him up by the arm. Draco’s mind dazed for a bit, and he stumbled forward only a moment away from falling into the unfortunate grasp.
Draco blinked at those words. They would send someone alone on look-out? “To send someone alone...isn’t that dangerou–”
That's when Malfoy turned around, and grey met green. Harry flushed and the other boy's lip curved up, nostrils flared and sneered. Harry wipped his head around almost instantly and looked down at his half eaten plate.
His glasses weren't there and his lips had moved to form a sneer. His eyes glinted a dangerous green and his hair was disheveled. And....he stared right at him. At
He’d left Pansy to die like this. Along and afraid, clinging to the hope that they would come to save her, and he didn’t. He left her holding onto false promises and dreams.
It’d be beautiful. Coral skies, with small brushstrokes of white as though they were angel wings. A bright yellow sun, basking its warmth to her skin, and for a moment it was as though she were truly there. Breathing in the fresh ocean air, and basking in the sunlight. The ghost of a smile graced her lips, and she pressed harder on the trigger. So close.
So...like I know this is like really late, but it's here now!!! New update!! I was trying to make my chapters longer, and have it make sense at the same time. I hope it makes sense.
” Potter defended sounding genuinely shocked by his words, but Draco wasn’t falling for it. He knew better.
There are no blankets he notes, shivering, and feeling the cold envelope his body like a second layer of clothing, but he doesn’t ask the other for any. He couldn’t bring himself to let go of his pride. He’s handled the cold before..and this was nothing. Nothing at all.
Going outside without a good pair of shoes was about just as good as trying to commit suicide. One cut to the sole, and that could lead to the deadliest of infections, and in the worst case scenarios turn you into an unfortunate if they come in contact with fresh unfortunate blood or saliva.
Draco threw his head back, onto the bed, ignoring Potter's frantic words. His gaze shifted to the ceiling. It was white, simple, plain, nothing to taint it of it's bareness. Draco wished he could go back to those days. When he was bare, young, and free. Longing to be back into the days where it were just his mother and him. His mother wearing a white sundress, adorned with a tawny hat, holding his hand as they walked through the bare woods, and sooner or later Draco would jump at strange noises that would pop out from the darkness. That's when she's smile at him, and ruffle his hair, telling him it was alright. That the darkness wouldn't hurt him. That it
“No can do, Blondie,” the brunette spoke. Her voice course, and rough, unlike how he would’ve imagined it to be. She looked far too
his way out from under Potter. Grabbing his wand, and the vials from the tableside, he quietly made his way to the door, only to find it locked.
Five years ago, Draco would have foolishly attacked at this man with no reconsideration or second thought, but that was five years ago and now was not back then. Draco was maybe half a meter away from the raven, and right before his bat made contact with those fists, he switched directions, sliding past the other’s feet, and making a charge for the window.
When all else failed he grabbed the other's hand and pulled, trying to get the hand away, but it didn't budge. Was Draco trully this weak? Had his father been here to witness this, he'd have been fed to the wolves.
Draco swore he heard Potter laugh, before letting the pleasure of warm fingers running through his hair lull him into fabricated bliss.
His head was in a jumble. Potter. Potter of all people had tried to kill him. Intentionally. And where'd he learned such a dark spell? Draco knew it was dark. If it hadn't been so, the spell would've never broken.
The brunette let out a small growl slamming her hand on the back of the chair next to Draco’s head. Draco flinched, jumping slightly. “Listen here Sylas, I don’t want any lies out of you. Which group do you belong to?”
And Draco let go. Sobbing into Potter’s pillow, a tiny part of him wondering if Potter would feel anything at all when he would find this ugly body of his, cold...
Dumbledore rubbed his beard..in a stress like manner. And when the lightbulb finally turned on, his eyes twinkled with delight.
Harry sighed and took in a deep breath, going over his decision one last time. He'd made his mind. He was going to get Malfoy to sleep, whether the blonde liked it or not.
"Oh fuck you! You don't know anything! And don't you dare assume! You ..you THINK that I am abandoning my SISTER?!! Exactly how insane and empty headed could you
Underground it is like a maze, winding and turning around in a unorganized manner, reminding Draco much of the past. Grey concrete walls, illuminated by a single string of lights running down the halls.
“What’s up in your head, Blondie? Can’t have you going on mute on me now can I?” Carrot top spoke, startling Draco out from his thoughts.
They were around him, merely an arms length away, and he was an arms length away from them. That’s what terrified him. They were so close.
He ran his hand through the other's hair, feeling the blood seep onto his fingers, tainting them in red. Harry's bottom lip quivered, and his hands shook when they brushed away from the blonde.
"Not just last night! The few nights be-." Harry paused abruptly, realizing his mistake. He looked up a little to see a sneer start to cover Malfoy's face. One of disgust and anger.
Pain greets him like a bolt of lightning, spiraling up his arm, and crackling down his spine. Draco had expected it to be painful, but it was a risk he was willing to take.
. But the funny side of things always hit him like the bottom of his father’s cane. Never hard enough to laugh, but hard enough to make him smile. Smile because he didn’t want to give his father the satisfaction of his yelps, but not to mock. It would only be mocking if he
He knew they weren't really going to help Malfoy and neither did they want to. They only wished to get close to Harry. After all, he
Chapter is a bit late, but I hope you guys like it! It's not my best, and not that long either, but it is more a leading thing for the next chapter! If you guys like this story, you can also check out my other Drarry fanfic called, 'The Unfortunate Ones.'
“What are you going to do?” Draco question not daring to break eye contact, and Draco swear what follows next made him almost shit himself.
And as the bodies piled upon one another, he had found it harder to convince himself that it was for the best. That what they were doing was right, and after Jake’s death, he couldn’t take it anymore. He’d let them free.
They came to a slow pause, and Harry crouched down, to lift a heavy concrete door off from the tunnel floors. Underneath was a pair of stairs, leading further and deeper into the ground. The cold beginning to tingle up his spine, to the soles of his feet.
If he was going to die, he’d rather as well die somewhere away from his sister. Somewhere where she wouldn’t be the first to find him...but if it came down to it. He might just have to end his own life here.
“Huh?” the raven stopped taking a moment to understand what Draco was getting at. “Oh, right! There’s more than one exit, of course. It’d kind dumb if it didn’t...uhh..secret passages through the walls and all.”
And with that Harry lets himself fall back on the bed, unaware of Malfoy snuffling out of the bed. It isn't until he hears the door rattling does he open his eyes again.
He could see Mullet head turning around in shock, reaching out for him, while Blaise struggled against the ginger’s hold, while Hermione was yelling something into her coms.
Anyways, I hope you like it!! I'll try to update the next chapter as soon as possible! Until next time~
..” he whispered, broken. The tears blurring his vision and leaking from his eyes like an open faucet. “Please...
She leaves one last hateful look at the blonde before turning back to Harry. “Get that hand taken care of,” Hermione snaps, before turning and leaving.
This is when Ron Weasley realizes that Harry was obsessed with Malfoy, wheather he admitted to it or not. Before both him and Hermione had thought that Harry was just being paranoid, and making random assumptions on Malfoy. Now it seemed clear that Harry was obsessed. Not like a stalker obsessed, ok maybe a little bit like stalker but not too much.
That was the other scary things about pockets. They were able to gather so much food..for so many people, but there were questions. So many questions. Ones that he hadn’t thought about in his previous pocket.
won't repeat itself again,' Harry decides. 'Not unless he doesn't get the dark mark. Then even Madame Promfrey herself wouldn't have a reason to stop me from snuffling the life out of Malfoy.'
behaviour towards them. He'd expected a whole presentation on his deeds, on his family name and the evil lurking in his blood. To him, she probably wanted some sort of reassurance that he wouldn't kill them in their sleep, or slip poisoned potions into their food. Oh, how wrong he'd been
to get killed or some shit. C’mon. Get up you crybaby, or would you rather stay down here?” Hermione’s voice is cold, mechanical in a way that made her seem almost inhuman, but he can see a crack of pity through that wall.
Draco gave a small wavering smile, and waved his hand in a careless motion. “I’m just kidding! Ha ha...I’ll just sit...right here..ha ha!”
“I don't know. Maybe because some of us need to fucking eat to survive!?” he exclaimed sarcastically.
“Me?” Draco laughed off, tugging the sleeve of his sorn up shirt further down his wrist. The concealer was still there. It’d last him only about another night, before it starts to smudge revealing the mass of black hidden underneath.
His darling young sister. Lilliath Lucius Malfoy. Oh how Draco hated that name. Lucius. Malfoy. And what he would give to be rid of it.
Draco stared quizilly at the worried boy infront of him for a straight whole minute, before it finally clicked in. Memories came flooding back and Draco gasped when he realized that this was the same Potter that had tried to kill him minutes before. Minutes? No...but he'd just slept...why was he sleeping?? Rather
Anyways, I hope you guys like it and I hope it gives you guys an insite into Draco's mind and why he doesn't want to sleep. Be sure to review and comment!
Draco scrambled to straighten his back, and erase the smile that was finding its way back to his lips. “Yes, father. I am listening. Forgive me for my ignorance.” He bowed his head slightly in a feigned form of respect.
him to do this. As long as it cause the Weasley's pain, it didn't matter how or what method was used.
Harry sat up. "But I don't get why?!! Why me? Dumbledore could've chosen anyone! But he chose me!! And I HATE Malfoy!"
Crouching, Draco picked it up, wiping the dust from the cracked glass, and taking a good look at the photo. It was of a little girl. No older than eight. She was smiling brightly, a smile he hadn’t seen in years. Her tiny, pudgy arms were wrapped around whom Draco assumed was her little brother. The boy had a scowl on his face, facing away from the camera.
"What sleep, Potter? I've already slept more than 8 fucking hours. More than I have in 3 months. Do you really think I'll just be able to fall back asleep just out of the blue?"
Draco joined in with his father’s cackles. “Y-you think I’m bluffing?” he lets out another burst of breathy chuckles, pressing the blade deeper into his skin, wincing slightly as the red pooled up, slipping down his neck in thick droplets, and just like that, everything came to a halt. The spells ceased, Granger no longer screaming, but panting with heavy gups of breaths. It was silent...and all their eyes were on him.
He knows escape is futile whether he ran or not, but he couldn't help but feel the fear crawl up to the tip of his fingertips, telling him to run. To run and
with you people.” It wasn’t much of a comeback, but in Draco’s defense, he hadn’t slept for 74 hours. Fuck him if he wasn’t exactly on par with his sassiness.
He'd suffered through nightmares, and still does. The death of his loved ones haunting his every dream, but never did he have reaction this bad. Well, not unless he's just witnessed a vision or a scene through the eyes of Voldemort, but Malfoy didn't have to deal with that. So why would Malfoy react in such a way. And that made it all the more less believable. He looked down at the sleeping figure and ran his hand through the other's hair.
Dumbledore payed no heed go his words and proceeded to down the beer. Today was a day of celebration. Today was the day of victory. Today Drarry would finally become a cannon. TODAY HIS OTP WOULD FINALLY BECOME ONE!!
On the pages there was the Weasley girl, with another girl. He'd seen the girl before, just never talked to her, nor did he ever bother to ever learn her name.
Hermione furrowed her eyebrows and pouted at Harry, which in a way was cute, like Malfoy. Wait. No...Harry. Malfoy's not cute
Black hair drenched in blood and matted to her face. She brushed them back with a convulsing hand careful not to let any of the blood fall into her eyes or her mouth. She let a shaky breath, and moved along the wall, trying to make way to an exit. She had to survive. Survive.
"Oh, its coffee!" Drake said delightedly. The sudden mood change was strange. "Bet you don't know what that is!"
“Lying, eh?” the raven walks forward leaning down to come to eye level with him. “What’s your name Blondie?”
Potter didn’t listen instead, flipping them over, pinning his wrists in an agonizing grip. “It’s okay,” the raven whispered softly, but Draco wasn’t having it.
Draco thought, trying to push his nerves back down. He dug his nails painfully into his sweaty palms, panting, trying to get just one good breath in through his lungs.
Draco thought, sweeping out from the bedroom door, and down the hallway trying to find where the supplies would be.
The boy infront of him growled. His eyes darkened and Draco's hand now went limp as the hold tightened yet again, crushing his wrist. The pain however was long forgotten, and now left with a bitter aftertaste. His hand tingled, slowly turning numb.
Draco fell. No. Draco was falling. Meaning Lilliath was falling. His arms tightened around the small body,  and turns his back around so it was facing the ground, breaking Lilly's fall. Almost.
to get to know Draco better. It would hurt me deeply to see Draco more injured than he already is, even though we don't get along very well."
Draco turned around, and gasped as a frenzied Potter reached out to him. His hand outstretched and so close Draco almost thought he wouldn’t make it.
It was an awfully ugly sound. Metal straining against itself, and sounding much like how nails would on chalkboard. Light came creeping in through the crack, revealing a tall freckled lean boy. Couldn’t be much older than him...but a lot more fuller. Draco didn’t know exactly how to put it in words, but he could tell that the other was well fed..and not in any lack for food. “Carrot top!” Draco exclaimed, not really remember the other’s name.
Well here it is! New update! Sorry for the delay. I had a lot of stuff going on. Anyways, I hope you like it! Be sure to review!
“There are those who’ve survive but they’re no better than the Unfortunates themselves.” Draco spoke in a hushed tone. “They have no more humanity. This city...this city tore that away from them.”
Draco didn’t know how much time had passed. His running had turned to a fast jog, muscles aching and begging for a res, but he didn’t stop. The back of his throat burned with bile, and the cold air.
. A soft hand closed weakly around his wrist and he turned his head around only to see the frail body on the bed looking painfully up at him with wet, drowsy eyes.
And so Draco just sat there, with his head in his arms, trembling. Shallow breathing, tight chest, a racing heart, and feeling clammy. The same old routine. He was so...so tired. His body numb, and he felt strangely detached. It hurt....
“Don’t sound so worried, Weasley. It’s not that bad.” Draco whispers in the shunned silence, almost in disbelief. His father makes a reach for him, but Draco steps back, pressing the blade deeper. “Uh uh...You come anywhere close to me, and I’ll do it. I-I’ll do it.”
Harry didn't reply, he didn't want to tell Malfoy about how he knew where he was. He couldn't trust Malfoy. He couldn't trust the son of a
Draco twitched at that, and glared at Pansy who looked at him grinning from ear to ear. She placed a hand on her hip and let her weight go down on one leg, before turning back to Potter with a demanding look.
"No buts Lilly. Papa isn't here now. We ran away, remember? I won't let him come back. ok? We will go to a safe place...where you will have friends of your own and people who love you," he looked up to the sky and smiled as the skin-seeping cold brushed through his hair. "You'll have a family, Lilly. A family."
Draco flushes a light red in surprise, before glaring at the other in disgust. The jokes were horrendous, disgusting even, full of dark humour that Draco understood all too well. “No.”
Draco winced and this is when Blaise walked in for his rescue. Grabbing Pansy's robe he pulled her back and took her place next to Draco.
He takes in a sharp breath, a piercing screech reeling him back to the present. It’s all too familiar. The same screeched he heard every morning come. The same wailing sounds that lulled him to sleep at the brink of night. “Please don’t tell me that was what I think it was.”
Before Malfoy could complete his sentence, Harry placed his hand on top of Malfoy's mouth, muffling any sound that he was making. "Honestly Malfoy. Has anyone ever told you how utterly annoying you are??"
meet. Think its better that way," he said while slowly inching up and out of the bed. "You never saw me whimpering pathetically and I never had the saviour of the world trying to kill me. Ok? ..yeah...good talk."
His father didn’t say anything. Only shipped his wand up, motioning the others aside. Draco knew he was furious. He’d seen what this spell could to to others. Heard it. Smelt the rotting and burning of their flesh as they broke to a whimpering slobbering mess. And as the spell began to pour out from his father’s cursed tongue, he found himself looking up at rising sun from above his father’s cloaked figure before closing his eyes bracing himself for the pain that was to come.
“Malfoy,” the voice came back. Draco gave a small chuckle, but it came out as more of a choked sob. How foolish of him.
"Thanks," Potter whispered back, before moving his free hand to grab the potion. He brought it up to Draco's lips, but Draco lurched back, refusing to open his mouth.
Wasn’t that why Potter, and his family had tried to nurse him back to health. So they could find out all they could about the dark lord? Draco wasn’t a fool. He’d heard them talking. Trying to figure out what to do with his useless existence. He’d heard.
He lets out a groan, feeling another sharp throb in his stomach, but tries his best to stifle it. It was painful, and he hoped Draco wasn’t going through what he was.
The other boy gasped, and turned. Streams of tears, and puffy red eyes. His face wrinkles in an ugly manner. “S-she’s–” he paused, unsure as what to say. He looked broken, and Draco felt helpless.
Malfoy could feel his hair standing on his back as Harry became more and more distant. Had he gone to far?
?" Potter spoke slowly walking closer to Draco as though he were hunting. Draco gulped, swallowing the spit that piled up in his mouth. Its wasn't a question, more of an order. Gave him a choice though. Either do what Potter told him to do and be in a somewhat ok situation, or resist and regret it. And Draco knew what he should do. He was slytherin. He looked for his advantage and gain. But of course, Draco wouldn't let Potter completely boss him around.
. He didn't shoot any nasty remark at him, when he insulted his father. Didn't even pull off his infamous Malfoy sneer. The way the sweat pooling on Malfoy's forehead, the clenching of his fists and Malfoy biting his lip didn't seem to calm his nerves either.
Draco groaned with his head embedded inbetween his arms. He would close his eyes every now and then hoping to catch even the tiniest glimpse of sleep, only to open them again a few moments later when the fear would come reeling in again and again
Broken bones were never a good thing. First there’s the pain. Then the infection, and finally death. A horrible way to go, but still better than being turned into an unfortunate.
But now Harry had grown. Become more muscular. He's stronger now. The fraud, skinny, tiny boy no longer existed. The one that stood here was strong, and brave.
Draco flushed, his face heating up in embarrassment. “I’m not fucking scared to hurt you, you fucking piece of shit!! And I said, don’t come clo–
it. Remembers seeing that haunting look everyday through the monitors. He’d helped it so long ago he could hardly recognise it.
Draco was dazed. His head had once again, hit something, this time the door, and he stumbled to the ground when the door opened on him. His head was now pounding. As if swelling and then crunching back together again and again. One more hit, and draco didn't think he would make it.
Only in a much more compromising situation. Draco flushed a deep red. Potter had pulled him down on his lap, Draco's back against his chest, and the hold on still very much tight on his wrist. He squirmed a bit, trying to get out of the hold, but Potter held tight, and it wasn't like Draco could bite him this way.
The door flings open, and Harry shoves Draco inside. He stumbles, trying to regain his footing. He looks up, feeling suffocated around these gray walls.
He imagined it’s look like water, but gentle. Flowing softly in wisps through the tips of his fingertips to wrap itself around the pole to the circular end of the probe. Soft ripples turned to violent waves moving across the mass of the barrier all the way around the house. It gave off a soft glow, which was only turning sharper by the second. The area around the probe, turned a neon blue, almost white, but he could still make out the blue tint. He winced slightly, eyes narrowing as the intensity of the barrier glow. It shone bright, no doubt already alerting the residents of the house.
as as potions. Slowly, he nodded, showing to her that he'd take them. Not really. He'd put up a front, like he'd done these past weeks, only a better one this time.
..," the voice croaked out. Malfoy's lips quivered, mouthing something Harry didn't hear, before closing his eyes again. Malfoy's body sagged a little, and the grip on his arm loosened but didn't let go.
were after him, for something he didn’t remember doing, but knew he’d done. Something important enough for Draco to erase parts of his own memories.
Draco eyes fell upon the other’s face, taking in every small detail, finding even the smallest flaws to be beautiful. The small freckles and the tiny hints of acne hitting his forehead in a way it mirrored the stars, and Draco wondered if he could connect the dots to spell out the constellations themselves.
The blonde looked up a little, taking note of the people around him. His expressions softening, and bare of his usual defenses...
Turning his attention back to the window, he slowly crept up, peeking inside. It was hard to see. The sun was long down, and the lights of the house had been kept off, for the same reasons as them. Still, he knew there were people inside. He’d heard their whispers...the shuffling.
Draco blinked, a rush of relief passing over his chest. They didn’t know...not yet. And that gave him some time. Draco let out another husky chuckle. “What is this? A walking interrogation session? Aren’t the big ol’ kidnappers supposed to wait for the rest of the group before all this questioning?”
After Potter had left, he proceeded to walk around the barrier, pressing his palms against the invisible wall, and watching as his touch sent ripples through the surface. It was as though he were looking through a thin wall of water.
Of course Draco knew that Potter was powerful and must've has some sort of strong magic considering the face that he was the savior of the Wizarding world, and he
Blaise and Pansy stared at him strangely through the whole process. They exchanged curious looks and proceeded to tap Draco on the shoulder. "Draco...what is that?"
Taking a couple steps forward, he smashed his bat onto one of the unfortunates, that was making its way to Blaise. It snarled, and reached out for his ankles from the ground. He stepped back, bashing at the head. It feeling never got old. The adrenaline rushing through his veins. Pulsing with every hit. With every sickening crunch of the bones. Guts spilling, and blood spilling out like a horror movie murder scene.
His current situation was not by any means comfortable. He doubted Blaise’s was either. Roped were tied around his wrists. The ones on his ankles giving him little walking room. His captor held the rope attached to his wristed, often giving a small tug if Draco slowed down, or said something out of line.
And I've been having difficulty choosing and writing my next chapter, and my brain started wandering, so I started on other stories. So sorry for not updating, but I'm working on another copy of this chapter and I promise I won't erase it this time. So for anyone wondering, no this story is not being abandoned. I plan to update this month, hopefully by next week. I'm simply taking a break from my drarry stories for a while.
He could just fall into this illusion of bittersweet nothingness. Draco supposed it was selfish of him, but then again, could you blame him? For wanting to have even the smallest taste of this forbidden fruit. One taste. Just
I know this chapter is pretty late. Sorry about that. I had school, and exams and I also had to catch up with my other stories. It's no excuse, but still. Speaking of other stories. I also have another Drarry Story out there, and some other ships. Be sure to check them out!
The figure before him doesn’t smile, and he wonders if he has said the wrong thing. It doesn’t matter...it was all he could do, Draco tells himself. He cries more, begging, his mouth rambling on and on about how they didn’t want any harm. How they just wanted to live...to get past the walls and
“Fine,” he muttered, pouting slightly. He resisted the urge to smile, and coced his chin up as if to say, ‘lead the way.’ Draco is letting go of his control...his
"Young master, young master!" Came a high pitched female voice. He turned around and saw Liddy. The house elf he'd grown familiar to. At night, or in the middle of the day, usually the mornings Draco would go to the kitchen, and sit there for a while. He'd sit there waiting for tea. Draco had hoped that the tea would keep him awake, and feel less tired. Ofcourse that wasn't the case. It only made matters worse.
” Potter asked sounding more like he was begging. The raven had begun to fiddle with the cuffs of his sleeves, nails digging into his arm every now and then. Draco bit himself from the questions that rolled down to the tip of his tongue, knowing now would not be a good time.
Draco Malfoy was scared. Hell he was terrified. And fighting for the life of the one closest to him. And his own. To make things worse, he couldn't even use magic. Draco groaned and then played his head on the bundle resting on his lap. He rested it there, and closed his eyes for a few moments.
Pansy would start the song on, and Blaise would happily join in, Draco following not to long after. Draco remained quiet though, barely whispering the words under his breath, but Blaise had heard him sing his heart out on rare nights. When Draco thought they were all asleep, his voice would be clear and loud for the outside world to hear.
“And what exactly are those ways?!” Draco was getting frustrated. The desperation and need straining loudly in his voice.
And Hermione does. Moves her eyes away from the disformed wood and up at the sight before him. She sees the second newcomer pulling themselves up from the vault and onto the grass, Harry close behind.
Draco crept in from the window, careful not to knock anything over or make any noise. He wanted to go see these people. Wanted to talk to them. Make a bigger group, but that was always a risk. A risk that neither of them were willing to take.
“I’m sorry,” Draco croaked is a hushed whisper. So quiet, that even he himself could hear it. He pressed his head back against the bark of the tree, and peered up at the setting sky before him. Pretty, like always. He wondered how someone as ugly as him could exist in such a beautiful world. It was a funny thing. It really was.
with Malfoy...” he whispered, continuing when the brunette gave a small understand nod. “Yeah...so we argued. Like how we...always do. And..And he just. He went all out and I-I didn’t understand..I just-”
He lifted his chin, crossed his arms, and gave glared at the raven defiantly. They stayed like that for a moment. Staring at each other. Challenging. Waiting to see who would give in first. Potter broke first.
When she was younger, she loved the idea of heroes. Of happy endings. The ones in the movies where the hero kisses the girl, and they live happily ever after. They never did show what happened after that, but it was nice to believe that nothing came after that. That that was it. Where it ended. Where everyone iss happy, and loving. And there is no evil queen to ruin it all.
Madame Pomfrey on the other hand beamed with delight and smiled sweetly at Potter. "Oh, I knew I could count on you. When did we ever find such a wonderful student like you?"
“Not yet, blondie. You haven’t earned out trust.” The raven clicks his tongue and Draco resists the urge to punch the asshole.
He let out a small cry, feeling the metallic taste spread like wildfire through his mouth. He spit out a glob of blood, and brought his head back up to give the other a toothy grin. “Feisty.”
Draco and Blaise preferred to be more of the vultures, that scavenged off things that the predators had left behind. It didn’t make them any better than the predators, but it sure did help them feel a whole tom lot better about themselves.
.it was no different than a ticking time bomb, ready to give out at any moment's time, and Draco needs to find a way out
Carrot top narrowed his eyes, studying him with a calculated gaze. “How long have your and your friend been...out there?”
Draco swallowed, and let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. “I didn’t fucking doubt it.” This was definitely
Draco glared, and took in another deep breath trying to keep his mind away from the fortunate that were still currently surrounding them. Chained maybe, but Draco still didn’t feel safe. “Fine...but you will not touch my friend, and let him go. You dare lay a hand on him, and I’ll kill all of you.
in this school, and the raven has the audacity to wiggle his eyebrows. “No. Nope. I’m not keeping up with this. We can’t be friends anymore, Potter.”
Malfoy opened his mouth to speak but paused. His eyes narrowed and he looked at Harry with suspiciously. "Wait...how..how did you know..that
All his life he’d been so jealous of Potter. He’d always figures the raven would’ve been pampered and showered with love and gifts. This did not fit his description of Potter.
And Draco couldn’t help but let his mind wander off when the fireplace to his dorm lit up in bright flames. His father’s crinked up face coming in view.
Looking back on it now, he wishes he would have held out a bit longer. These experiments he’d let out, they survived. Survived two years. The creationshis brother had been so keen on making his personal army ended up
He dreams of it gone. He imagines what it would be like, in a world where he was not a Malfoy, where he lived with another identity. But reality always seems to shatter his dreams. He WAS a Malfoy. Nothing would ever change that and Lilliath was cursed with the same fate as him. But he wouldn't let that happen. Lilliath would not grow up to get the dark mark like him. She would be kind, loving, and definetely not under the dark lords rule. He would...
Draco's smiled faltered a little with the words. Oh, if only Lilly knew that he probably wouldn't survive the winter. Merlin, they might not even survive tonight.
The newcomer sticks out like a sore thumb. It is not hard to miss. Shabby pants, a crooked walk, torn leather jacket and a scowl to complete the look. He looked worn, tired and beaten. Skin marred and eyes so weary, begging to tell a story.
The room is eerily plain. Heavy concrete walls, smelling a lot of wet wood, with stains running along the side. He doesn’t want to know what caused those stains, because whatever it was, it sure caused one hell of a struggle.
"Draco doesn't get cold, Lilly. Draco is a big boy now, and big boys," He booped her nose and smirked, "don't-get-cold."
"Potter...what is this?" He found himself asking. This was it. His advantage. His ticket away from Potter once and for all.
Harry watched now with a staggered grin as Malfoy scratched at his neck with one hand, while the other curled slowly inside his robes.
Potter sighed, and started to walk trotting ahead of him, his footprints digging deep into the snow. “Come along.
Today, Draco uncovered one of nature’s greatest secrets. Someone. It doesn’t exactly matter who...whether it be Merlin, or Christ, or what the muggles seemed to call god.
” he whispered, not really sure whom the question was for, or whether he expected an answer back or not.
"Oh, shut up, Malfoy. I don't have any personal reason to keeping you here, and neither do I want to. I have to do this, else I'll be skinned alive....MADAME POMFREY!! MADAME POMFREY!!" Harry yelled still trying to keep Malfoy pinned onto the bed. "THE BRAT IS AWAKE!!"
But then again, who wouldn't? Who wouldn't want to free this beautiful world of something as gut-wrenching as he is?
Draco peers up at the raven, the fear returning. He’s stuck in a fucking labyrinth with a goddamn monster. The minotaur was barely two feet away from him, and unfortunately for Draco, his attempt on being Theseus didn’t play out too well.
If the fates were lucky, they’d grant him death here and now. A peaceful sleep, filled with his guilty pleasures. He could die now. Freeze to death, watching the sunrise, and of how beautiful it would be.
And here's the new update! I know, Harry seems a little..no scratch that..VERY confused about his thoughts. That's because he sort of has two personalities. It'll make more sense later on in the story. And he's also as clueless as ever.
Sighing and a bit weary from the previous unrolling of event, he left himself relax for a bit. Laying there, and accepting the warmth that radiated from Potter's body. He could forget his troubles like this. He could be happy with Potte-
“I don’t want to,” Draco groans, pushing away the vile that the raven was shoving towards his face. “I’ve had enough sleep...trust!”
he whispered begging the Brunette to stop, but she remained relentless. Hitting him once again. “..I’m not..l-lying...”
The panic filled through his every vein. Chemicals running through his very bloodstream, flooding them with  unbearable dread as it leached up from the deepest pits of his bones to the tiniest tingle of his fingertips.
And he couldn’t. The tears welled up at the brim of his eyelids, threatening to spill the second he blinked. Perhaps, they were already leaking. Pouring out from his swollen eyes pathetically. If only father could see him now. He looked up at Potter desperately trying to reach out, but in no avail. He was going to die...and he was going to die
“FUCK!” he screams, kicking the wall, only to regret it a moment later. Gritting his teeth, he bites the pain down, walking away from where the screeching and wails seemed to come from.
He’d seen their files, knows they aren’t...they don’t feel anything. They are monsters at most. Demons hiding in the body of a child.
Harry nodded, letting out a toothy grin, and Draco almost dropped at the beauty of it. “Yeah! That’s what makes it fun!”
Draco lay on the floor panting, and gagging when the spell finally broke the hold on his neck. His neck now ached and stung with the scratching. Little bits of blood pooled up and ran down his neck in thick drops. It wasn't a grave wound, but it hurt.
only if you promise to meet me by the black lake tomorrow night before curfew ends. Do we have a deal?"
to join voldemort sooner or later. Not that he didn't have a choice. Oh, he had a choice. It was to join or to not join. But then again, what would Potter know about that? What the hell would Potter know what position he was in?! After all, it was the oh so good Gryffindors and the evil, slimy Slytherins.
Lilly giggled as if Draco had gone mad. "But, Lilly does have a family!! Draco and Lilly. Draco is all Lilly needs, and Lilly is all Draco needs. No one else. Just Draco and Lilly."
"Cuz it involves Malfoy. For all you know he might be up to something. After all he's been acting a little strange. You know for the past few days he sneaks out after curfew and he drinks more water than before now!!"
Draco faked a laugh and scratched his head, only to feel rough cloth rather than soft hair. He had questions.
” he asked, almost confused to why his father would contact him...through the slytherin fireplace of all places. The snarl that followed made him straighten up, brush a hand through his pants trying to get rid of any wrinkles that may be visible. Giving a slight cough, he took one deep breath, before turning to get a better look at his father’s face. “Father.”
Pansy quirked her eyes up in realization, but it was short lived. The small gap of shock turned to a sinister smile creeping across her face, stretching from ear to ear. Draco deadpanned, as Pansy closed her eyes for a moment, letting out a scoff. “What your father doesn't know, can’t hurt right?”
The thought alone made Draco want nothing more than to bash the others head in...but he supposed he couldn’t blame them. Humanity doesn’t exist in this world. In this world, it’s hunt or be hunted.
go through it the previous times, only this time he felt this sort of thrill. A terrible want. It was like an itch underneath his skin and when Harry scratched at it, he felt satisfied.
Draco gulped. “Dead...they don’t exist anymore. Everyone’s dead. They were all overtaken by the unfortunates. T-those who survived are now scavengers or in pairs. Pockets are g-gone.”
Draco waited for Potter to say more, but only silence greeted him. He could feel Potter's gaze boring into him, cold and calculated. Unlike how he had been before. Potter truly wasn't going to repeat himself twice, but Draco wasn't about to go down without a fight.
Potter gave him a hateful look, and turned to leave, but stopped in his tracks. “Don’t try to leave again, Malfoy. I won’t be so kind next time.”
” Potter spoke, before taking a gulp of the vertesium potion Draco had improvised. Draco followed not long after, taking his shot from the vial in front of him.
And he continues writing...until the ink fades away from the marker, her name whispering away with the black.
Potter frowned at his insult towards their home. “It’s past midnight, Malfoy. Last time I checked, people don’t go on walks in the middle of the night, and especially not with a broom.”
.” Harry stuttered, trying to make sense of his own words. His friends eyes widened, and Harry felt the need to continue. “I mean...he wasn’t dying! Nothing should even make him think that. I was just trying to understand his problem, and he just starts freaking out! I was just trying to help, and he starts to doing this, like-
It’s just like before, and these people are no better than the ones who started this entire mess. No better. No worse. They were all the fucking same, and a part of that knowledge sickened him to the core. Knowing that no matter where he went, it would all be the exact same.
Draco groaned frustrated, but followed Potter nonetheless. “If you didn’t get the memo, Potter. I wanted to walk
It didn’t matter. None of it. He’d end up on the wrong side at the end of it all, so why not live this last month like it was his last? For all he knew, it could be his last.
you have problems with." It wasn't a lie. Potter lied all the time. Draco just so happened to be the only one to see through them.
from ok. He was in pain. So much pain, and he’d put him here! Draco could hardly think straight. Why?
Draco gave a crooked grin. “Yeah? Don’t seem like that to me. Seemed like you were pretty intrigued with our little
The rain kept washing down upon them, and Draco wondered how it was that life could become one of those cheesy romantic movies he’d see on the muggle boxes. It felt too good to be true, and as one of Harry’s hands landed close to his hip, he felt his heart swoon the slightest, pumping blood filling with adrenaline throughout his entire body.
Its eyes were pitch black, one half gouged out dangling off sickeningly by a single thread of fibre from the sockets. Wrists, and ankles were swollen, and shredded down to bone in an attempt to escape. The unfortunate gaze bore deep into his eyes, looking for something he couldn’t make out.
Draco moved swiftly by the old house, Blaise following behind. They had long gotten away from the hoard of unfortunates. They’d rested, drinken the last of their water, and eaten the last can of beans. Neither of them dared to touch the final piece of gum that lay protected in the confinement of his pockets.
“We have to find a way out of here,” Blaise whispered frantically, eyes wide and fearful. Draco raised an eyebrow. Had Blaise found out what they really were? Did he know about the experiments? “We
Harry had taken his shoes. It was smart, and it ensured his captivity even without all the bindings. Going out with a pair of shoes was as good as suicide.
to do this. Only doing it because Pomfrey asked me to. I, honestly, couldn’t even bother to give a damn about you.”
"Hey mate, why are you all red? Oooh, were you looking at Cho Chang again?" Ron asked, before giving the sly smirk of his and looking eerily towards the table where Cho sat.
It was all going to leave, and Draco would be alone once again. The body holding him shifted, and Draco braced himself for the cold. Only the cold never came.
The raven lets around another laugh, despite the battle commencing around them. Draco holds him tighter, as though it would protect Potter from the chaos unfolding around them, but it doesn’t do much. Potter lets out another grunt of pain, biting his lips too keep him from crying out.
The raven is curious, but it’s not for Draco...it’s for the intel that Harry knows he holds. It wouldn’t make sense for them to keep them here otherwise, wasting both water and food, even it was just barely on them.
There was nothing wrong with being a slytherin. Nothing really. They were sly and cunning, ahead of everything. They had the ability to get themselves out of practically every situation.
The soles of his feet were blistered, and his eyes drooped threatening to close and give up on Draco then and there. He hadn’t slept for the last three days. Not since the incident. He’d offered to take up on ‘watch-duty,’ knowing Blaise needed sleep more than he did. But that was before they were captured by this group, and tied up.
When Draco woke up, he found himself cuddled against the soft fabric of the pillow, and rather...warm? No, that wasn't right. Draco wakes up cold. Always cold. The warmth that would engulf him in his dreams always disappeared the moment his eyes opened..so why? Why was the cold not returning? Was he still dreaming?
Draco gasps slightly, feeling himself being reeled back into reality. Greasy, damp, concrete walls, a winding hallway before him and a psychopath asking him if he was okay.
When Harry retuned to the room, he found the body of Draco Malfoy sleeping softly in his bed. He looked over to the night stand, and found the vial missing. Looking down, he found it shattered to pieces on the ground. Sighing softly, he cast a soft
just a few moments ago?!” Draco yells, deranged, heart thumping at the speed of a thousand horses. “Let her go..let her go or else–”
Idk if this chapter made any sense at all...but it was basically Draco deciding he wants to live, against all odds. He's not joining either side of the war, because neither place is somewhere he belongs, but he just wants to live, much like the other slytherins.
Draco didn’t dare look back, as the probe slowly began to slip past the barrier, the light flaring up against his skin. It was warm...burning. Scalds and hot welts began to form on the tip of his skin, and he let out an anguished cry.
However, Harry's realization came in a little to late. Malfoy's eyes shut close, the hand inside his cloak closed together into a fist, and his lips moved as a soft quivering voice breathed out.
He’d never killed a living person before. He wondered if it would be any more different that ending an unfortunate. The thumping of his heart didn’t help calm his nerves. Maybe if he just pretended the green-eyed boy was an unfortunate it would help. If it came down to it, he’d have to do it, or try dying. For Blaise.
Molly sighed yet again. It seemed to be becoming a habit. Not that Molly minded. It helped her get things off. She would take in a breath, and let it go, as if letting go of all the worries out with that one breath.
“No no no no..please..god now,” he pleaded, a tiny part of his hoping they’d feel sympathy. “No...nO..
!!" He yelled, trying to defend himself, but the other three ignored him, not even giving him the slightest of glance.
scared. Ok. Maybe he was a little scared, but it's not like he'd ever show that to anyone. Expessially not to the oh so great saviour.
Suddenly, the door swings open, and Draco falls forward, his arm extends to prevent Lilly from hitting the ground.
he thinks, clenching his fists until the nail dug into the soft of his palm, threatening to tear open, and spill.
Draco groaned again in frustration and turned onto his head and stuffed his head into the pillow letting out a small scream of anger.
Slowly he made his way to the bed and crawled onto it, keeping a foot off the mattress. "Just so you know, this is kidnapping! This is completely illegal and...I-I'll tell!"
Harry hated Death Eaters to his very core. He despised the Dark Lord even more, and if Harry knew that Draco was involved, there’s no doubt that he’d hate him as well. And judged by Harry’s strange violent outbursts, Draco feared he might even be killed in that fury.
She said the name with disgust and without fear. It seemed to shock Draco. To see how brave she was. If only he could be so, but as much as he admired her bravery, he was beyond pissed. This old, orange headed hag seemed to think that he was abandoning his sister for good! This is why he didn't like Weasleys'. Always thinking that they are the only family that ever has any human emotions.
Complete and utter silence. One wouldn’t consider it as something wrong, but this was Pansy they were talking about here, and Pansy was
The way things were going, Draco knew he didn't have much of a choice, but to drink the potion, but that didn't mean that Potter knew. Draco was going to use that to his advantage. "Fine...I'll drink it and stop moving,
Anyways, how is quarantine going for you all? I hope you guys have found some picked up a new hobby, and I hope that you al are safe and doing well!
Draco trembled a little, and goosebumps began to cover his body. He shakily got to his feet, feeling a little light headed and raised his wand in a defensive stance. If Potter even dared to bring his wand out, Draco would hex him.
. His lips curled upwards, and he smiled the biggest smile he had in a long time. Smiled till it reached the tip of his ears, till his eyes watered, and threatened to spill. Till the guilt poured out from his lungs and his breath no longer felt locked up in this cage he’d made for himself. Till he no longer cared, because the truth was bitter, and he wondered if Potter had figured it out.
,” he warned. He was losing control again, and a small something told him it wouldn’t even pretty. Malfoy wouldn’t be so lucky this time.
The raven looked hesitant, hands twitching slightly as he contemplated on the others words. “Anything?” he replied after a while, and Draco nodded frantically. Gods...he was desperate. “What about...quidditch?”
It was wrong, and he knew it. To be sitting around this polished table, adorned with candles, and piles of endless food. All seats full, with their owners smiling and laughing like there was nothing to hurt them. Draco looked back down at his plate away from the sparkling sight. His mouth watered, and stomach churned for him to eat.
Harry gritted his teeth, and continued ignoring Draco’s little interruption. “Second, we don’t have time to go through the whole
Harry looked back over at the Slytherin table to get a glimpse of Malfoy. The blonde was staring down at his apple, looking quite peaceful, and rather
Harry on the other hand, shook his head frantically. His anger faltered and he seemed more flustered than enraged. "It's not what you think," he said raising his hands and moving them about to make Malfoy understand. "You don't understand!"
And with that Potter backed away, and Draco sighed in relief. Although relief didn't last long. Potter's hand squeezed down on his wrist and pulled, making Draco stumble on his feet. He twisted and pulled, but his wrist was held in a wrenching grip. Draco scratched at it, when Potter pulled at it yet again and dragged him along.
Later, Draco would come to know how wrong he'd been, but for now he was being lulled into the darkness and the last thing Draco saw before he faded away was a smirking Potter, looking as though a predator would to a prey.
The boy on the other hand only glared harder, as though it would pierce a hole through his head. "What time is it?" Malfoy snapped, making Harry flick back a little, in fear of being kicked.
Draco didn’t know if it would work, or not. It was a simple Probity Probe. A device that enables wizards to sense dark artifacts. And with that, it should be able to break through pure magic, if concentrated on one spot. Thus, the glass.
Granger let out a small satisfying smile, and walked closer up to his tied up self. “Now, that wasn’t so hard now was it, Sylas?”
Draco blinked, his mind reeling back to Potter, standing there with his bloody disgusting emerald eyes, and stupid unruly hair.
That year she confined herself inside the curtains of her bed. Nothing that Blaise or him said would bring her out. Her parents had refused to take her back during the summer. And why would they in the first place? To them she was the reason disgrace was bestowed upon the family name.
