"You've just about convinced me to leave myself," Harry tries joking. "Look, sorry. You don't have to—"
Draco drops his gloves to the tiles, his arm guards following shortly after. Harry loses his words somewhere between the shin guards and the jersey, eyes rapturous down the curve of Draco's spine to the twin globes of his bare arse, begging to be cupped in each hand.
It's a wonder how easy it is for Harry to get drunk on Draco, to jump down his well of being and drown with his eyes closed and no concept of days or weeks or months. Harry never does anything in halves, a trait Hermione says is residual from their school days on the run, though Harry disagrees. His father was rash before the war, and his mother reckless enough to get in the thick of it with a baby in tow. Not that Harry really knows how they are. It's only, he
," Draco whined, lurching toward Harry until he stumbled and fell to Harry's feet. He reached for the slice.
The Great Hall of Hogwarts came pouring through the foyer. Ernie MacMillan and Hannah Abbott came hauling in a cauldron of soup. Three Weasleys popped in with pockets full of pranks. Then the Ravenclaws turned up with a Wireless in tow, belting
"Okay, okay," Harry mumbled into Draco's elbow. "It's 'cause I liked how the book felt in my hand. Like a soft thing with hard edges. It felt good to hold. It reminded me of you. And I liked that."
Girlfriend is an exaggeration. They haven't even held hands yet, but Ginny wants to badly enough that she's getting a divorce.
“Look at Stella,” he beams over Miracle No. 3235.
"Oh," Draco says. "That's um. A lot. What — what bothers you more?"
Harry Apparates.
Neville Longbottom was the first person I killed who I knew well. Hermione had been complaining about him for a full half-decade. He wanted to uphold every pureblood tradition there was, right down to regressive marriage laws, and I was bloody sick of him. Funny how people change once they leave school. They take the train back to their fancy estates and reconnect to the rotten roots of their upbringing. School may have mixed us all up, but the sediment settles down to the distinctive layers in the years after, and we go back to the parts we were born to play.
Draco's wearing a thin Quidditch shirt, slightly untucked, soft and worn over his chest like something that Harry wants to bury his face in. Draco must've changed out of his work robes before coming over—there's no way those pastel high-tops would've passed corporate muster—and there's a smudge of weariness under his eyes.
"I don't give a fuck what other people think," Harry says, when what he really wants is to scream.
Draco went home and shelved the fresh additions, delighting in the glow they brought to his favourite corner of the house. He was sitting in the window and waiting for his tea to steep when he remembered a cozy book he read a week ago that would be perfect under the nook, warm as a blanket and twice as soft. He spent the night searching for it everywhere, under sinks and behind planters, between bags of rice and flour—nothing. He could've sworn he left it on his bedroom table, but still—nothing.
"I'm not sure." Harry curls his lip under his teeth and comes up blank. He shakes his head. "I just don't want to." He's never been good at explaining himself. Intuition is like magic itself: it simply works for Harry.
Harry made a ham and cheese sandwich after and split it with Draco. Draco pulled off the crust before taking a bite, which of course Harry made fun of.
“Tell me something you remember,“ Draco says, so Harry tries, reaching for a memory that he sometimes forgets is his own.
Lunch is after a change of clothes and a rousing round of complaints (“A bow-tie? Really, Dad? Really?”). Narcissa outdoes herself with a summer banquet enjoyed in the greenhouse on picnic blankets over freshly grown grass. Harry takes a bite of biscuit and surveys the snowman on the other side of the glass, wondering if he’s watching them too, like looking into a snow globe made of summer. A sun globe? He ponders on this until Scorpius snugs up against his side, half-asleep, and they take it as their cue to head home.
Harry poses for photos with Hermione. He dutifully answers questions for the Prophet reporter, who, in turn, refrains from asking any about his personal life. Harry poses for a few more photos with Hermione's staff, and finally, after another hour or so of wrap up, Hermione finds him and envelopes him a hug, her eyes wet with tears. She says, "I don't even care if I win anymore. I'm just glad you're back on my team."
Ron tosses Harry a beer and crooks a brow as though asking, and?
"Yeah. I mean, of course it does. But I want to see those fuckers die as much as you do. They killed my mother."
“This — thing. This insect thing.”
Draco smirked. “You’re drab.” He leaned in, his finger jabbing Harry in the chest.  "Dreary.“ Another jab, another inch closer. "Utterly. Unspectacular."
Harry breaks the tab off his can and flicks it at Ron. “Fuck off.”
"Hermione's friends with Malfoy now?" he asks.
"Read it, and maybe you'll find out."
“Am I wrong?”
She slaps him across the face. "NO WAY. Oh, shit, sorry—" she takes the sting off Harry's cheek with a wave of her wand, "—but, Malfoy, really? Merlin, I can't believe—"
"It's late," Draco says.
I’m finishing up a cup of tea in the living room with Hermione when an eagle drops a letter into my lap.
I'm walking down Diagon one day and catch Neville taking a sharp turn on Knockturn Alley. He had on a cream-colored coat Hannah bought him the year before for their third wedding anniversary. He was so proud of it. It got a whole two lines in the Christmas letter they sent out with a button to vote for him for some position or whatever. I couldn’t keep track; the wanker was always trying to get to the next position up at the Ministry.
"Why?" Harry crossed his arms and leaned against a bookcase, his back slouching as he smirked. "What would you do if I was?"
Harry's crimson robes pooled over dirty tiles. His boxers were tugged only half-off— his left arse cheek clinging desperately to decency—a red-checkered, picnic-blanket pattern over hairy thighs. His eyes found Draco's with alarming precision, unblinking as he chewed with slow, menacing rotations of his jaw.
"Just okay?" Draco rubs his eyes. "We can't really have
"Says he'll meet us here before we go."
It was a crisp morning in early September, and Diagon Alley filled with families finishing their back-to-school shopping. The door shut behind him, and Draco took one step forward into the fray. Then he backpedaled all the way back inside and hid in his room for the rest of the day.
I led him to the pub. I wanted people to recognize us, so he felt safe. We had three drinks and talked up a whole lot of nonsense about the "good old days" when Voldemort had a firm grip on the world. I went home after and waited a full week before I murdered him.
"Jesus Christ," I murmured, wondering who Jesus Christ was.

Harry pulls away.
"No?"
"Please," Harry manages weakly.
"You're not bad," Harry says.
“Orange,” he said. And that was the last we ever spoke of it.

Malfoy's wearing charcoal-grey joggers and a tee that rides up his stomach, his hair half-fucked and sleepy. Harry knows an opportunity when he sees one. He lowers his voice. "You want to come in?"
“Fuck the case,” Draco declared, climbing into Harry’s lap. “I don’t need you to save my life for us to fuck.”
Draco’s eyes flit to meet cool steel. He looks away, heart quickening. “No reason,” he swallows.
"Feels good," Harry whispers into the crook of Draco's neck. He pushes up to sitting, the mattress dipping as he shifts his weight.
Hermione throws him an annoyed glare before beginning to pick at a loose thread in her jacquard blazer. "There's a chance. It's slim, but there's still a chance. Though Greengrass is already asking me to concede, and I'm afraid that I'll look like an idiot for even
“This is cheating,” Draco says, though he keeps his fingers pressed against Harry’s breastplate. “I don’t understand how you can sit with all this armour on.”
"I'd say, you're far stupider than I thought."
"Oh." Harry sets down the crisp in his hand, half-eaten. "I… I thought it was obvious. I do. I know you'll win."
The bathroom they share in Grimmauld Place is lined up to Draco’s chest in pale yellow subway tile. The rest is wallpapered in white narcissuses that remind Draco of his mother. The wallpaper looks fresh even though Draco knows Harry didn’t put it up himself. It’s obvious which rooms Harry redid and which ones he hasn’t. When Draco walks between them he feels as though he’s being ricocheted between his past and his future.
"It's not smart to mix your hard alcohol. You'll get drunk faster that way," Ron says when Ginny calls for a round of vodka.
"I have a system," Draco said. "Comfort reads by comforting objects. Fun stories where the light shines brightest and dark reads in dark spaces—under beds, behind closed cupboards."
Harry sat down next to Draco and pressed his shoulder against a misty arm. There was that time when they'd been nineteen, and all they required was a soft bed and a pack of condoms. And then there was a week ago, when what Harry required most was to hear Draco's voice again. Alive. But Harry should have known that magic twisted simple desires, monstrous. He was a fool to cheat Death.
"So, can we have fun or what? I'm
“We’ve got eggs, and I’ll fry up the rest of the potatoes from last night,” she says.
Draco raises the vase between them. "You bought this?" he accuses, a blade-thin threat concealed in his tone that Harry vaguely remembers from their Quidditch years.
Draco flushes. "But —"
Harry’s voice on the other end of the line is tight and controlled.
"Did you make a reservation for this place?" Harry asks. He doesn't bother with the menu; Ron will order for the both of them, forever Harry's tour guide to the world of magic and unfamiliar foods.
“Yeah.” Harry licks his lips. “You want to see?”
“What, lover? You don’t love him?”
"Shouldn't it go first? Seems wasteful to move all the furniture, only to empty a room again to paper it," Harry asks into the air above. He's got to do something about the ceiling; it's far too blank to be the first thing he sees every morning.

Harry's cheeks heat. "He's just helping me with the redecorating," he says. Besides, they're at the point in the renovations where Harry sees more of Pansy than Draco. How can there be so many different types of fabric and prints for curtains alone? They took two days and a bracket showdown before finding the perfect one: not-floral, not-white, not-tasselled. Blue.

Maybe Harry doesn't hate Draco anymore, since Malfoy stopped trying to kill people. Maybe Malfoy's just another fuck up from the Hogwarts Class of '98, lost as the rest of them.
There’s a dot of ink right after the first
"Yeah. No thanks," Harry says. "I don't fly anymore."
Harry makes eyes at a woman at the other end of the bar. He leans back and jabs his thumb toward Ron, who, for some goddamn reason, is staring at the laminated cocktail menu with his pinky out like he's at a wine bar instead of a sweaty warehouse where people get drunk off vodka Redbulls and search for intimacy against the porcelain of a bathroom blowjob.
"Merlin, Harry," Draco whispers.
"Calm down," Harry says. "We're not, like,
“This is better in the long run, anyway,” Draco said, a tinge wheedling now.
"What about you? This is

," Harry says, groaning.
“Her eyes weren’t jade,” I say to him.
"I live in an empty box," Harry says at the end of it. His living room is a long rectangle, the same grey as a mausoleum.
Yesterday: Hermione's cat got loose; Ron had a heart attack when he found him in his work bag. Kingsley wants Harry to give another speech. Classes are boring, Junior Auror duty is boring, people suck. Also, the canteen food was nearly unpalatable — pizza! More like congealed cheese over bread.
“I told you. Said he had a limp.”
"What do you think of it?"
Harry wipes his hands on the dishrag and moves the four paces across the cabin to Draco’s side, his hand resting over bandages around Draco’s waist. The dog gives a sleepy snort and burrows his head deeper in Draco’s lap.
"Yes," Draco said. He held down the index card with two fingers and wrote down the original publication date: 1996.
There is something very wrong with Harry Potter.
. Whatever's in your head is ridiculous," Draco says. "You're about as charismatic as they come. You've had people believing in you since you were eleven."
Draco Disapparates in Harry's hesitation.
Ron slaps his knee. "Some friend
Breathe.
Draco stops and stumbles on his own feet. He hunches over, catching his breath with his hands over his knees.
Three bubbles kiss his nose. His head’s woozy, and he’s got a fish’s eyes, thinking—this must be what love feels like, floating up.
"That's the bloody goal, idiot," Ginny laughs. "Don't tell me you drink for the
Was this Imperius? Whatever it was, it beat sleeping in a cell.
“Even in your daydreams, I wear black.” Draco pulls at the gauzy webbing around his neck. “Would it kill you to dream up a nicer fabric?”
. What
"Stop wearing my name out," Harry growls. He thrusts, one hand shoving Malfoy down by the shoulder.
"Rain in the afternoon, though," Draco says.
Upstairs, Harry opens a window and spells a breeze through, smelling of grass and lemon. Draco watches him from the bed, a curious expression playing across his face.
(Eyes that see on another’s face. Heart that beats outside my body but is no less mine than my own. The ends of our lives folded up so that our past and our future touch.)
Dobby rouses at his name, blinking open big brown eyes and shaking out noodly purple legs over sloppy initials—DLM. “Is Dobby really seeing Harry Potter?” he squeaks, his ears twitching.
"No, I'm not," Draco says slowly, "but you were. Before."
The bartender takes a step back. "Thank you…" he hesitates. "I never thought you noticed before."
"I almost like it better that you didn't know. Like it's fate," Draco says. "Like if it's out of my control, then I can stop second-guessing things and just give in to what I want." He takes a step closer, the vase still between them.
"Lube me up," Harry said. "Like you did with Neville's gloves last week. Poor bloke dropped every last Quaffle—"
He said, "I was waiting for you to come for me," like he wasn't surprised at all. He said, "I know a lot of guys who deserve to die. I can show you where they live. I can tell you when they kiss their wives and when they take the kids to school. Okay? I’ll give you everything you want about them."
Dear sky, dear soil, dear pine cones crunching underfoot. Dear wing-song, dear wind-warble, dear quiet from the clutter of words. Dear brook, babbling into spring, clear as your intention toward me. Alone in the woods, stripped from double-meaning. Your hands, your mouth. Press me against a tree, dearest, until we disappear into it.
"For." For staying too long. For lingering. Harry gestures in the empty space between them, unable to solidify any of his fears into words. He buttons his shirt instead, zipping up his trousers on the way out. Some agreements are better left unspoken.
"I thought we agreed that I've done enough caring for a lifetime."
"This is exactly why we won't work. I just think we're better off as friends. Or acquaintances, whatever you want. Please, Harry. I don't want to end things on a bad note like this."
"WE SHOULD DO THIS MORE," Harry yells sometime later in Ginny's ear, their bodies sweaty under neon lights pulsing heavy to the bass. Harry doesn't remember moving to the dance floor, doesn't remember
The faucet twists off. Harry scrambles out of bed, heat rising up his neck as he digs around the sheets. He pulls on his pants just as the door squeaks open, and Draco walks in, dewy-faced and his mouth slightly parted, a towel slung low around his waist.
I told him to give me another name, or I was going to take his own.
If Draco’s favourite word is No, then Harry’s favourite word is maybe something like Alright, okay, okay, I’ve got you, I’ll stay.
"One. For all of Nylon, a club that crams in over three-hundred people at max capacity," she deadpans. But she's all smiles for the server.
“Shut up. I can’t imagine you out of your uniform.”
Malfoy nuzzles the soft outline of Harry's cock.
Oneirology: the study of dreams.
Draco's been lied to a lot in his life.
"Why do you want to open that door?"
Harry misses his ten-am interview. He misses his three-pm photoshoot. His mobile rings, and rings, and rings, until it too, dies.
Harry shakes his head.
The Floo rang then, and Harry made an apologetic face, excusing himself for the moment. Draco took the opportunity to creep up the stairs, his curiosity getting the better of him.
"Well. That didn't go as well as I'd hoped," Eltanin says. "We might've smoked too much. But at least he looked pissed, right? He was definitely jealous."
Harry buys a cabin nestled deep in the woods, but the distance is of no consequence to him, because he is a wizard, and the Floo is a friend. The Floo soon becomes his best friend when he tumbles through it every few days to the Granger-Weasleys or the Burrow or Draco’s flat in London.
beat through his chest. Did his sheets smell of Draco, or was that in his head too? It was a wonder how an absence can be so consuming.
"I didn't know he passed," Professor Snape remarked from his portrait with surprising emotion.
"Yeah? How do you know?"
Harry's orated many times, but the audience has never been as enthusiastic as they are tonight, sustaining their applause even as Draco ushers Harry off the stage away from the blinding lights. They push against each other between the velvet curtain folds. Harry's forehead is beading with sweat, which Draco wipes off with a linen handkerchief.
"Shut up," Harry says. It's hard not to laugh, but he manages. "I eat plenty of it. I'm going to eat it now, yeah?"
Apparating is indeed better for the environment than driving. There are many ways to bore yourself to death.
"I'm loyal," Harry says, getting to his feet in a panic. Bile rises up his throat and sours his mouth. "I'm not—"

"Are you looking for someone?" the bartender asks when he brings Harry a second drink.
Ginny pulls Harry back from the step he's unconsciously taken forward.
“What, I can’t push my hair back too?” I’m trying to sound annoyed, but it’s hard to be when he’s wearing my jumper with the lightning bolt pattern.
"Eager," Draco parrots. That wanker, always looking for an easy comeback. But he obliges, shifting Harry's weight over them so that the blunt tip of his cock presses against Harry's entrance and slowly, smoothly, presses in.
“Good morning,” Harry says. His hair is mussed from sleep, his glasses left by the bedside table. Little creases in the corners of his eyes squeeze together in age or joy or both. He drags an arm around Draco’s waist and pulls him in closer, their legs tangled up in seafoam sheets kicked off in the night.
“Nothing,” Harry murmured. He pressed Draco onto the bed and kissed him slowly. His body moved like it was pushing through amber, ensnared in sticky sweetness and cooling slowly.
Draco wrinkled his nose. "You haven't read a word of this book."
A funny feeling bursts in Harry's chest, as though someone squeezed his heart until it ruptured, simultaneously warm and painful, and sick as an open wound. He clamps down on it, letting out a too-even chuckle. "I think I deserve to get my dick sucked, then."
Draco is a beetle.
Seams fray at the edge of days. Draco is easy to pick out because everything is easy with practice. He fishes for the plums that Harry forgets to buy and settles for Harry’s hand instead… ripe and sticky to the touch.
He did. He

Pansy stamps her foot over an imaginary cigarette. "You've been
“All that water.”
Draco stood so close that his sneer was all that Harry could see. Harry wanted to kiss that ugliness right off his face, so he did.
"I have several blond friends…but yes, the one I had in mind is my roommate. He's the type that Harry—can I call you that?—usually goes for. You know, blond, pointy."
One he starts, he can’t be stopped. It’s
Harry comes first, but who's keeping score?
Then it's Saturday night at Nylon, and Malfoy's already there at the bar with his shirt off and his tats on display. Malfoy catches sight of Harry looking (of course Harry is; as if he could look away from that inky dragon crawling up Malfoy's back) and waves him over.
Draco charms their cups cool, the paper thickly insulated to protect from hurt. He puts his wand away. "Would you prefer that I sneer?" he asks.
The man at the counter finishes his last slice of bacon. He wipes his fingers on a paper napkin and burps his satisfaction before turning on his stool, a hand reaching for the duffel. He locks eyes with Harry. And then his expression changes.
That was three days ago. Tonight, Molly is walking her youngest son's crup alone, at nine-pm, because her youngest son's girlfriend kicked her out. All over a bleedin' dinner, too. Okay, sure. Maybe Molly shouldn't have cooked up a whole roast when Hermione said she was bringing home pizza. But who in their right mind would ever choose glorified cheese toasties over their mum's home cooking?
They wait outside because it's too hot, with their faces still flushed from the run. They watch the neighbourhood pass by them, some with their dogs, some on their phone. Then, finally, the barista calls Draco's name, and Harry gets up.
Harry bangs his fist on the counter. "Yes! Me too!"
Gravity. Magnetism. Force. Attraction. Words to explain how things come together, even if you don’t fully understand the why behind them. Harry’s not really even into skateboarding. He just likes watching Draco move — in the sky, on the ramp, against him.
Harry leans over the plates and tilts Draco's face up by the chin. "We can see where it goes," he says, kissing him.
Harry scoots his chair forward. "Did you hear what I said? He's roommates with the
Harry made a face. "I'd rather avoid another horcrux situation if I can."
Hermione hugs herself, wishing it were Ron's arms instead of her own. Maybe she made a mistake.

"No!" Draco bit back his anger. Trust Harry to misunderstand him. Some things never changed.
Draco turned to Pansy. "He wants me to make tea?"
"Bloody hell," Draco reared back, his own fist balled up and ready to strike.

Harry leads Malfoy to his gym. The weather system is still up from the last time he rode, and a storm has coalesced in his absence, violent winds whipping the door tightly shut. It's only with a considerable amount of exertion that Harry pries the door open with a loud grunt and coaxes the clouds dry and the sky blue.
he mouths. Listen. Wait. Then, then, then…
I had the gun pressed to his back when he called me by my name.
"Malfoy has a nice one," Harry says. "Silky as fuck."
"Wait," Harry said. He punched Draco lightly on the other shoulder. "Come on, we're getting off track. Quidditch game, remember?"
Harry runs a hand through his hair. "I told you, nobody cares about what happened during the war anymore. You've done plenty—"
"Shut up," Harry says. He sits to her left and drops the tin of pre-rolls onto the glossy black coffee table.
“You’re the one who insisted on wearing dress robes,” Harry whispers back. He waves at a portly guy sitting on his front steps. The guy gives him the finger in reply.
"Oh, that book."
Amelia Bones raised a brow. "He told you this?"
“Go on,” I urge.
Harry follows him to their closet, where Draco pulls out a frame wrapped in brown parchment. Harry knows a little of what to expect, and his head’s dizzy just thinking about it, his fingers clumsy like he’s forgotten how to use them.
Draco says, “And we’re leaving tomorrow, so you won’t get the chance, not until—”
"Mountains of Diet Coke," I sneer. "My honey, lines of aspartame, fake sugar to the brain. Wanting is a wasting sport, Potter. Cavities. Rotten teeth. Rotten apple."
“But you said,” Draco says into the crook of Harry’s neck. He yawns and forgets the rest of his sentence.
Malfoy lives in a Victorian terrace with two roommates, and his jumper's threadbare though his hair is still nice. Why?
Harry stood up and paced before a bookcase, eyes scanning down the spines. "It's all for show, then?"
"What the fuck, really?"
Harry wakes at noon, starving. His fridge is full of leftover takeaway, so he peels the Stasis off a box of pizza and gives it a good sniff. The shaved truffle has wilted over congealed cheese, but that's Harry's own fault—he should've cast the charm while it was still hot—so he digs into it with a sigh, fridge door left ajar.
"Kiss me," Malfoy says, so Harry does, all tongue and teeth. But Malfoy's lips are pillow-soft and unexpectedly yielding, his arms looping around Harry's back and holding on with the lightest touch, nearly an embrace. Harry's own grip eases from the back of Malfoy's head, blond strands falling between his fingers. He closes his eyes, the velvet of Malfoy's tongue coaxing his jaw slack and his mind blank. He slips from his hands to his elbows. And then he tenses.
. He chews the name up, swallowing.
"Close your eyes, then," Draco snorts from Sirius's bed. Harry wants him to take his shoes off, but he also doesn't want to fight.
The bartender grins back. "In an hour, actually, I—"
He reports all of this back to Ginny later that night at Dean's new restaurant.
Are they…making out?
Wait a minute, redhead?
"I—I think maybe he did, once," Harry says. "But I thought he was making fun of me."
Harry shrugs, the steel melding fluid around his shoulders. “Less talk from you, I think.”
“Where are you?”
Fresh-ground coffee, brewed in a Chemex Harry found in a ratty cardboard box pushed to the back of the Potter vault, behind a tall stack of Gringotts gold. Two steaming mugs and yesterday's photograph beside it, encased in an empty wooden frame left on Dumbledore's desk. Tomatoes from Molly's garden, and cucumbers and radishes too, with still-warm slices of sourdough and a creamy ball of burrata slit down the radius and spilling out to be served.
“No, no,” Draco says slowly. He looks up, realisation rippling over his face. Harry feels hot; fragile.
"Shut the fuck up. You know I'll love you forever."

Harry silents him with a weak spell, magic dissipating quickly in the wind. He smoothes a thumb over Draco’s lips in apology. Draco never understands. Still, Harry tries.
One day the potioneer refuses to take his galleons. The potioneer says, “Potter, I won’t let you kill yourself this way,” in a plummy sort of a hiss, like a jewelled cobra, or maybe a dragon.
Harry grabs Draco by the arms. "Draco," he says. "Look at me. What are you afraid of? Tell me."
“Wear the—sorry.”
Kissing Potter feels like running your tongue over a flat stretch of desert so unyielding that the ground cracks under the pressure of air. Potter’s lips are chapped to the point of ruin, his teeth harsh and unrestrained, like, like, like surprise cacti on the horizon —
"Pretty cool," Draco said and made a note to introduce Harry to his copy of

"I thought all my mistakes had ruined me for life. But Harry and his friends taught me that people just keep moving forward. I guess what I'm saying is that Harry doesn't hate you anymore. Nobody does. They can change as much as you. But you can deal with that when you're ready."
Harry buries his face into his hands. He sniffs, smearing snot over his palm. When he looks back up, his eyes are blurry with tears.

He takes another step toward Malfoy.

“But you do so much for me.”
"Bloody hell," Harry says. He pulls out and flips Malfoy over with rough hands so that he can look down at that pinched, ugly face. "So are you. What the hell do you want?"
Draco scrunches his face up, making his own list. When he finishes, he says, “Seven, actually.” His face is soft. “I was going to wait until after the wedding, but it’s probably better if I show you now.”

. Doilies and delicately crocheted tea cosies bring up nothing but the Dursleys. Dark, tasselled curtains remind him of Sirius and wingback armchairs of Snape. Harry tried the opposite of everything he knew with his last decorator, but he hated that, too.
"You're alright," Harry mouths against his ear, his hands tangled up in Draco's hair.
Harry looks up very slowly. The air stings like static between them. Whatever Harry wants, then.
Three bangs of green and a rain of window glass behind a hasty Protego. Right. Back to work.
"I go up, I bark out stuff people expect me to say. Then I sit back down, like a well-groomed crup."

Crumbs lingered at the edge of Harry's grin. Cheeky bastard. Draco breathed in once, slowly. He wasn't sure how to deal with all this newfound effusiveness from Harry Potter, but Pansy wouldn't leave him alone with someone she thought would hurt him, so maybe it was alright if he talked about the book.
“Alright, then.”
"I should bloody hope not. Just thinking about that bob makes me cringe."
Disappointment weighed heavy on Harry’s shoulders. He hated how desperate he was for Draco to care. To show compassion, and maybe even love, to someone whom he’d hated since first-year. Harry thought, after five years and a dozen apologises, they’d be in a different place, but—
"You can buy this?"
"This is fucking weird, even for you," Draco said, but he opened his mouth.
"It's not." Harry breathed in again. He shook his head. "You know I can't."
“No, I do.”
"You’re so different. I can't imagine it's easy."
"He hasn't yet, technically," Harry said. With a sigh, he tidied up the log books before crawling into the tunnel behind Dumbledore's portrait. Then it was three left turns and a final cobweb in the face (secret passageways really weren't as cracked up as his younger self made them out to be), and he was there, twelve paces from the Room of Requirement and watching the knob pass through Draco's translucent hands.
. Also I got high and watched bo burnham’s new special.
Harry nudges the mug forward. “Try it, then.”
"Not even a little?"
"Cool," Ron nods, following Harry to Grimmauld for a nightcap before Flooing the rest of the way home.
Harry crosses his arm so that his hand grips Draco by the wrist. “I’m ready to go,” he says.
Draco pulls back, lashes wispy over the delicate skin under his eyes. They flutter then still, grazing over Harry's mouth, tongue darting out to wet the corner of his lips. "Again?"
The other day Harry mixes up the bottles at the apothecary and picks up a Forgetfulness Potion instead of his usual Sleeping Draught. The potioneer at the counter gives him an odd look when Harry takes out his coin purse to pay for it, but Harry disregards him because the potioneer is Draco Malfoy. That night, when Harry gets ready for bed he notices the tag on the potion, blue instead of the usual yellow, and realizes the mixup. But it’s already past midnight, and he’s had a long day, so he pretends he doesn’t see it and knocks the potion back in one gulp.
“It’s a blood curse, Potter. It lasts forever,” Pansy tutted dismissively.

"I'll tell you what he was like," the dark-haired bloke lounging across from Harry says with a conspiratorial smirk. "Got the low-down from a hookup last week. Called himself Draco Malfoy."
"Your turn," Malfoy smirks.
"I'm glad you tried to break into my house," Harry said with a great sloppy grin on his face. And then he brought out a plate of sliced apples, and what was Draco to do, except to stay the night?
"Fire trucks. Are all Muggle firemen incredibly fit? And did you know they have a calendar?"
"Kiss me," Harry says, reaching behind Draco's head to pull him down too.
"I hate it," Draco says when he comes over for the first time.
"It's not for sale," Draco growled, snatching the book from the stack and stalking toward the stairs in time to see Harry Potter, grade school nemesis, best and worst of all wizards, unlacing his trainers at the door.
“That’s just his face when he thinks about Scorpius’s da,” Albus says.
Cherry lips stained dark & sugared against skin smooth as cream. Harry imagines them sticky against his mouth; each kiss sweet & slick on his tongue, cool until it flambés down his throat, where he’s choking with want. Touching Draco feels like drowning, like his every breath, burning.
"I know."
"Nice house," Harry said. He had a finger looped around a fraying belt buckle, and his jeans were ripped at the shins, though his glasses glinted gold and new. Kohl lined his bottom lashes.
"Pretty," Harry says about the bracelet. He thumbs the thin chain, the small diamond studs. Two fingers encircle Draco's wrist, briefly, before Harry lifts it to his lips, his stubble dragging down the back of Draco's hand. "Pretty," he says about the diamonds, about Draco. Dainty. Delicate. Indestructible.
"Something like that," Draco says. "Drink the tea, too."
"That's not how fucking works. Fucking's…" Draco waved a hand in the air. "You either fuck or you get fucked."
"Sure," Ginny snickers. "Harry talks about you all the time."
for @drarrymicrofic prompt: paper
What Harry likes most about weed is how all emotion slows to a roll, drifting by one at a time so that he can reach out and touch it, feel it, hold on to it. The joy of Draco’s knee against his as he fumbles with the rolling paper, finesse lost to fingertips crusted with kush. Fear and expectation drowned out to a half-parted mouth, an unhurried transition horizontal onto the sofa. When was the last time Harry could focus like this? Latch on to Draco’s face and lose himself in the shell of an ear, waiting for it to echo back his devotion.
A week passed with no change. Pansy left out a bit of milk and bread for him every night. On Saturday, she asked if he couldn’t set her up with a weekly allowance from his vaults for his expenses. “Nothing big,” she said smoothly, presenting him with crisp scrolls fresh from Gringotts and an ink pad for him to press his forked claw into, to sign.
Malfoy pushes Harry harshly back. Harry stumbles, his vision temporarily lost to vertigo. By the time he can see clearly again, Malfoy's pulled up his trousers.
"Except
Harry clears his throat. "I'm not—"
“Mm.” Potter leans in, the metal snaps of his coat sleeves clinking over the glass countertop. His hair is its usual curse-swept mess, his uniform wearier than his face. From close up, I watch his mouth stretch the barest millimetre wider, and something tugs in my chest in return.
Harry hangs up. What is he thinking? He's a fucking disappointment to everyone he knows. It was only a matter of time before Draco gave up on him too. He isn't sure why he thought Draco would be different. It's only—Draco hated him
There's a new wreath at the front of his house made of dried branches and autumn leaves. Miniature Snitches weave in and out of the foliage, humming sweetly when Harry pulls open the door to see light streaming down from the newly installed skylights. Harry drops his car keys in a shallow ceramic dish that Teddy moulded during art class at school. The giant lightning bolt painted across the bottom flashes once in cheeky greeting, too lemon-yellow to remind Harry of his scar.
"No!" Ginny giggles, holding her phone tightly against her chest.
"Tequila! Tequila shots!" Ginny yells.
Draco takes a step back to admire the spread. "Is this where you take all your dates out for dinner?"
a dozen models," Harry says, which isn't entirely true. They slip into his DMs often enough that he gives in and replies if he's horny and they're particularly athletic. It doesn't take much to want someone to come over. But Harry's bored of models now, the same way he's bored of Ron's constant nagging, bored of his Weasley monogram knitwear, bored of the same fucking grin that greets him when he hands his fire-truck red Bugatti Chiron over to the valet every night. He wants to find—well, he isn't sure what he wants. Anything but models. Harry is in the mood for…messy.
"I want to kill whoever did this to you," Harry says.
"Okay, fair," Hermione laughs. "My odds against Greengrass are loads better than yours against an immortal dark lord." She smiles down at her egg salad sandwich. "I like this side of you."
Molly lets the crup down. A glimmer of green catches her eye, and she turns to it, staring into the half-shuttered windows of a cafe. Her reflection stares back, solemn under dusky streetlights.
“I know,” I say.
It's true. He's sick of playing the same game with the same friends he's known since he was eleven. Harry could've ended the match in the first five minutes the last time he flew. But instead, he let the Snitch flutter higher and higher until it was lost to the sky. Where do lost Snitches go? Is there a flock of them somewhere high up in the clouds, where nobody can bother them?
Draco's an art thief. Harry's in it for the chase.
Harry snorted, disbelieving. “How so?”
"Of course I read. Everyone reads, unless you're Goyle."
The list was written on the back of a letter to Draco’s mother. There are eight names indexed total, each an invaluable piece stolen from the Reina Sofia.
Potter retracts his hand. He scratches his beard, and I follow the movement up to his smirk. “I dunno, you look pretty open to me. The door let me in and everything.”
The problem with shots was that two was fun and four was fine, but six and seven and eight turned nine and then you found yourself stumbling in an unlocked stall that was very much occupied by a Harry Potter sitting on the toilet with a box of pizza in his lap.
God, Malfoy. They didn't exchange a word at the club, but Harry already wants to take his cock out and shut Malfoy up with it. He undoes the button and lets the zipper split itself open the rest of the way, his cock jutting out and springing back slightly, the tip already slick with precum. He licks his palm and imagines Malfoy swallowing his length, hot and wet and choking enough for his eyes to water.
But I was wrong.
"You're the more likely one to back out."
If it were up to you, you’d rather die.
Ron slaps Harry's hand away from the ceviche. "Don't

“Don’t wear that,” Draco calls from the doorway. He walks up and slaps Harry’s hand from the cupboard door. “Don’t fucking wear a baseball cap around here, alright? Didn’t you read the handbook?”
Malfoy says that Harry should patent the weather system then sell it to BroomBod, or manufacture it himself. "Though it's probably too much work to do it all by yourself," he says as he towels off his hair. "You're better off selling it to BroomBod. They already have the brand and the marketing team. They can build out the integration for you in three weeks. Then you can live off the royalties for the rest of your life."
"I needed some time alone," he said.
"Sure can't," Harry said. He couldn't help a smile.
Fill me up with the good stuff. Ice cream and peaches and ribbons of whipped cream lace. Apple pie and oven-warm mitts round and around my waist. Blueberries boiled down so they’re thick again. Four or five plates, then a few more of those little dishes for sugar and butter and melty chocolate flakes, to taste. My taste is more like a space than sense. It wants to take up room. It tells me, fill me up with the good stuff. Swallow up your love and keep me company where it’s dark inside.
Woodfire ash and glow. The warm hum of a song cottoning in the ear. Eyes of twin emerald —
"It doesn't have anything to do with my gun on your back."
"I have his address if you want it," Ginny says. "Found it when stalking Hermione to his door for—ah, yikes. Let's just say, for reasons we will not go into."
Harry reaches out with both hands. It's a perfect fit.
Harry wakes to an eyeful of Draco's collarbone, a warm arm tucked around his waist. Draco blinks awake not two seconds after—a light sleeper; fussy, as Harry would expect—and they're kissing again, Draco rolling over Harry to grind their hips together. Last night was good—great, stupendous, amazing—and this morning looks to be more of the same.
They move to the living room, with its vast expanses of marble furniture camouflaged against marble walls, and tasteless Warhol portraits hung uncomfortably low. "Like a snobby hotel lobby" was Ron's critique of it the first time he saw it.
Draco had the tea steeping and was plating biscuits when Harry reentered the kitchen and declared that the book was nowhere to be found.
"I'm two blocks away," Pansy says. "Your neighbourhood is
Harry Floos home after and changes out of his joggers, standing before his bathroom mirror to comb his hair and shave his beard. He takes out the bottle of cologne that Ginny bought him when they were still together and holds it in his hand, considering, before shelving it back in the cabinet.
Harry groans; Ron's bloody unhinged. He shoves a twenty into the woman's hand for her trouble before manoeuvring Ron out of the club, his gaze still locked on Malfoy. He's at the exit when Malfoy finally opens his eyes and stares back. But Malfoy doesn't look surprised at all — no, his eyes are narrowed, and his smile beckons, like a lure.
“You’re really going to wear it?”
"Great-Aunt Lucrecia's. I thought I threw that out," Draco said. He rubbed a hand over tired eyes before rummaging through the shelves for his new ceramic mugs. He found two gold-rimmed tea cups, stamped in the silver Malfoy crest.
"No, no. Please...please stay. It's not often that I have company."
, not intentionally, and yet, the guilt still eats me up inside. I never could apologise for it.
The door bursts open. The solicitor breezes in with his arms full of release forms, and Malfoy is back on the street in a matter of minutes.

"We didn't order—" Draco gasped. "Did you
“Where?” Draco asked. The ends of his mouth kept twitching, though he tried to hide it behind his hand.

BroomBod has classes in thirty, forty-five, and sixty-minute increments. Harry selects sixty and regrets it in the first five. The trainers try to pump it up with music and overly-enthusiastic mantras, but there's no rush from nose-diving towards a Snitch or flying buffeted by the rain. Maybe if Harry conjures a gust of wind, the damp dew of clouds, then he won't die of boredom.

"No. I'm sorry, I just need time." Draco looks away. "I shouldn't have come." He stands up. "You won't hate me if I leave, will you?"
“Yeah,” Harry croaks. He fumbles for his sunglasses, before realising he’s already wearing them.
"No?"
"How well do you know your roommate?" Ginny asks.
Harry shapes the water molecules in his hands and lowers the atmospheric pressure until fluffy, fat clouds hang at eye level.
" Draco shrieked, voice shrill and cruel against the same ancient stones as when Harry had first followed Draco down this corridor a lifetime ago.
"No," Draco said. "No. No. No." His mouth twisted. Were Harry's eyes always this black? Bloody hell. Looking at them made Draco want to push Harry down and, and, and—and really give it to him.
"No bloody way," Draco said. "We finish this
"Dear Merlin," Molly murmurs, looking away to give the teeny gremlin some privacy. Someone turns on the telly from a second-floor window and the pavement crackles with the distorted dialogue of some melodramatic Muggle movie.
“Oh my god, they’re
"Merlin," Harry muttered, a wet laugh prickling his throat. "I miss you so much." So strange, how people change. They'd once walked down this very corridor as enemies, but now Harry didn't want to imagine a life without Draco. He couldn't. No, he must. Draco was dead.
Harry couldn't recall much of the wedding either, now that he thinks about it. The champagne was good. And no one expected much from the bride's ex-boyfriend, anyway.
“I know,” Harry said.
"Bleh," Ginny says. "I fucking hate truffle."
Harry had gotten as far as the Portkey station. He said, "I wish you wouldn't go." He said, "I don't want to live without you." And then he said goodbye.
Ginny pops a pickle in her mouth. She wipes her fingers on the edge of the linen tablecloth and waits for Harry to continue.
"We finished the last of the tiling this morning. Once the guest mattresses come tomorrow, your home is complete," Draco says.
"Don't say that."
Draco rather agreed with Pansy’s assessment, but still, Potter came by, week after week, neverending with his questioning: “Black or Malfoy? Are there any records? What species—” as though Draco’s condition wasn’t so hopeless as long as he didn’t stop trying to change it. As though, after all these weeks and years, Draco could still change.
"Yes," Harry said. "But I know people." And then he changed the subject to Quidditch.
"You've seen mine," Draco gasps, blinking salt out of his eyes like tears down his cheeks.
“Got to cover the scar somehow,” Harry says. His eyes linger on the scuffed brass doorknob. But he shouldn’t, he knows.
"You can't." Hermione licks a dribble of mayo running down her pinky. "Not while I'm running for Minister, anyway."
"I've got you," the bartender says with a wink.
It is a windswept day, and the sky bleeds grey into the sea. Harry thinks his time left is like a blowsy yellow, warm as Draco’s hand. He wants to tell Draco to never let him go, but what’s the use in that?
for looking this over for me! 💙
I don’t bring you flowers anymore. You’re all around me—like you never left.
Draco's hands ball up in Harry's shirt, his breath puffing hot over Harry's face, and Harry, he wants, he wants—
Ginny catches Harry staring again and gives him a knowing look. "It's not your fault," she says, patting his hand. "Quidditch arse. Bloody irresistible. Trust me, I know."
The bar is empty except for Draco and the barman, and they’re chatting — though Harry can tell it’s all bilge from how Draco lounges back with part of a hand swept through his hair, forgotten.
“And why’s that?”

like Ron. You'd think dating your childhood best friend would mean near-telepathic communication by twenty-two, not weeks-long sieges of shoulders turned stubbornly away in bed and silent mornings of breakfast for one.
That night Draco stands in front of the mirror. The man who stares back is pale but warmed by candlelight. He finds that he doesn’t mind the way he looks. But he knows that what he sees before him is a pale reflection of reality. Mirrors only show you what you want to see, and Draco sees a man in another universe where Harry Potter forgives him because he’s done something good with his life. Draco knows the dangers of delusions, so he wills for his face to grow gaunt and sallow, the way it had looked in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, or the way his father’s had looked in Azkaban.
"He said we had to," Harry says sulkily.
"You liked holding the book in your hand."
Draco pinches his brow. “You know what I mean.”
"Me too," Harry gasps and squeezes his hand tighter, unable to stop the building pressure as Draco squirms over him, breathing harshly into his ear.
job, even."
The snow’s good today. Fresh. There was a storm over the weekend, and the wind wiped the lake clean; made the snow all soft again. The kind of soft that makes you want to take a nap in it and disappear for a while.
"So you threw a magnum of vodka at her?"
"What about me?" Harry asks. He ducks his head back down, tracing another slowly past Draco's ribs, his tongue flat against Draco's chest.
. You've got a billion-Galleon idea locked up in your gym. And you built it, what? Over the weekend?"
"What side?"
Harry swallows back his denial. He's sick of all this truth talk. "Look, I'll reconnect the bloody broom. Can we fuck already?"
"Are you jealous?"
"Can we get back on topic?"
"Oh," Eltanin remarks, gazing at the marker curiously. He takes it and draws a thick line over another scrap of parchment, the ink flowing out dark and vibrant. "Huh," he says again, crossing his arms.
With my eyes shut tight, the choice is clear. I follow my nose down the copper beneath his neck, and bite.
It was one of those days when the sky hugged so low that I wanted to take a broom up through it and stir it up. “You could drown in a cloud like that,” Draco said, so I told him I’d be fine; I’d drowned in his eyes and lived.
"I thank the gods every day that I'm not married to Ron," Hermione laughs. "It's alright. You're lucky I can handle her for the both of you."
"Hey." Harry nudged him with the base of a coke bottle. "Want something to drink?"
Harry's bedroom was the smaller one overlooking the garden, with windows thrown open and the sun filtering in between the branches of hawthorn. His sheets were a slate grey and slightly silky, his pillows the kind that begged to be sunk into. By his bed was a bedside table, and on that table was
Malfoy bites his lip. "You'll listen?"
It is six-thirty, the sun a yolk-yellow beacon rising between the trees. Draco laces up his trainers and tugs at his socks before opening the door to the dewy dampness of morning.
I’m in a room and seeing another from when things were golden-hued and begonias bloomed where you walked and bells rang when you laughed and your eyes shimmered like the silver reflection of a lake in the distance. I want to go back to that time so badly that my whole chest sticks to itself like a wad of gum. Like I’m stuck in the past, skipping breaths until I can be with you again.
to be chased around all the bloody time?"
Harry wanted to pull Draco in by the coat lapels and press his face against Draco's neck. Harry wanted a lot of things he couldn't have if he thought about it too hard — so he stopped thinking and held out his arms.

be here. That's bloody awkward."
Ginny props her elbows on the countertop and leans in. "Harry here says you have a roommate."
The silence gets deafening after ten minutes. Harry jumps up and down in the entryway, trying to distract himself from the utter stillness around him. It doesn't work, so he changes tactics, turning up the Wireless as loud as it goes, which is not nearly enough because he can still hear himself breathe.
Ron pinks. “Yea… it’s Rose. ‘Mione says I’m besotted over her.”
Crackerjack purrs between their legs as they step back out of the Floo. “I’m going to put him to bed,” Harry says again about Scorpius in his arms after Draco yawns over him the first time. Draco blinks slowly, so sweet with his hair mussed that Harry can’t help but pull him in too, his whole family in his arms. “Thanks,” he murmurs against the shell of Draco’s ear, Scorpius’s lashes tickling his cheek. He doesn’t want to let go.
“They’ll have detention for three weeks,” Minerva says.
“You’re copying me again,” Draco says. He smiles; makes a show of running a hand through his bangs.
him. It's her Harry.
Draco takes her hands. He runs a palm over her eyes, nudging them closed. “Breathe,” he says. “Feel your heart. Then let the music sweep it away. Where does it go?”
My own affections fester within me, building momentum until it’s a tornado of turmoil tearing through my chest with nowhere to go.
He catches me in front of the mirror. I try to fight him off, but he's strong, or maybe I'm weak. My wrist is thinner than I remember, closed tight in his fist. I stop moving. If my mother taught me anything, it's to know when I've lost.
"I fucking did, alright? You can make fun of Harry all you want, but he's just — just. He makes me feel good about myself, alright?"
Eltanin comes back empty-handed. "Can't find it. I might have left it in the kitchen. Come on," he motions toward Harry, "follow me in. I'll fix you a cup of tea while you wait."
“On the behest of your lover.”
"Fine," Draco said and stomped off, only to stroke a remorseful hand along the walls an hour later. The house was all he had. And so he convinced his house to hammer up the last shelf in his bedroom before leaving to find books to fill them up.
"No, no. Actually, yeah, can you? Purple. No—can you do silver?"
Right. Pickup Quidditch: Ex-Aurors vs Harry and his Exes. Draco scowled at the memory. Harry had accused Draco of hexing Ginny's broom. Draco said it wasn't his fault the Weasley bint couldn't afford anything faster. Fists were thrown, a nose bled, Hermione raised her voice—
Draco nudges him, holding out the vape.
The door jingles. A woman sitting behind the cashier looks up from her magazine and waves.
"That's not—Harry, I'm never too busy for you. I have no idea what I'm doing with the campaign. I mean, it's not like I've done it before. Sometimes, I think I'm in way over my head—"
Question: How do I know when I'm in love?
"The club didn't bother pressing charges, so…" Dean shrugs as though to say that he has far more important things to do than babysit a bunch of drunkards, powerful wizards, or his ex-wife.
“Sure,” Harry said.
“They remind me of headstones,” he says, hollow as though they were closing in on him. Cold and suffocating even in death.
Harry pockets the phone and mixes himself an old fashioned, the same one he always makes, but he can't get himself to drink it. So he goes into the living room where the weed's still left out from last time, and smokes up the room so thick with smog that the ugly shit around him disappears into a white haze, and for a moment, he thinks he's died again. Then he goes to bed.
Ginny refries the potatoes with rosemary and red pepper flakes. She’s almost done with the eggs when Luna floats in big-eyed and blinking and says that she’ll make griddle cakes. Draco fiddles with the coffee machine and sets the table and cuts apples and hovers when there’s nothing else to do except wait for Luna to finish. There’s a joy when his hands are busy, but his mind is not, and he savours it as he heaps sugar into Harry’s coffee and swirls the spoon slowly, as though he’s brewing a potion. Twelve turns counter-clockwise, for love.
"What do you want to do today?" Draco asks later in the kitchen. Ron's left a box of asparagus wrapped in strips of wagyu beef, and they eat it with a side of fried eggs and orange juice.
Draco’s side is cold when Harry wakes in the dark. The moon spills in between the blinds, hard shadows playing with shifts in the sheets the shape of Draco’s body. Harry imagines Draco outside on the deck, pale and luminary, still as the stars he sees, and turns to sleep.
"I hate this room," he tells Draco.
“Oh what”

She nodded rigidly. And then I saw the room for what it was: rebellion, in the only way Mother knew how. She was like me: trapped. Except she was letting me escape.
Harry tucks Draco’s fingers under his own, fingertips smoothing over knuckles.
Ron puts down the menu and reaches for his water glass. "The takeaway in your fridge? Where do you think it comes from?"
“Oookaaaayyy,” they say, and let him into their hearts.
Malfoy walks barefoot over Harry's carpet. He throws the damp towel over Harry's dresser and pulls his shirt on while looking in Harry's mirror. Harry watches him warily from the corner of his bed. When did Draco get so comfortable in Harry's space? They've only hooked up three times. And yet, Harry isn't surprised, either. Draco is the type of person to make any room into his own home. It's the sort of entitlement that Harry expects from Purebloods.
Harry walks through the neighbourhood the next day with no plan in mind besides curiosity. Someone's playing music that's more pleasant than provoking from the other end of the park, and he follows it until he stumbles on a farmer's market bustling with produce and people. He tries samples of strawberries and peaches on bamboo toothpicks and poses for a photo with three primary schoolers, who burst into giggles if Harry so much as breathes.
The mouth opens and closes in a fluctuating flow of words that compresses through Harry’s vaguely empty mind as though playing through static.
Draco feigned a gasp. "Really? Why would you do that?"
Harry Potter's dick felt about as good as anyone's, saintly or otherwise. The perfect girth for his own fist. Who'd have known that hand jobs would be the great equalizer. I sighed into the sheets, stomach tightening as the tension built, little zip-zaps fizzing down our spine and shocking us into completion.
problem now. Says I'm bloody fired if I can't get you to listen."
"Tosser," Ginny laughs at him. "You know she hates that you drive."
"Look at me. Look into my eyes and see the truth."
The lake is an expanse of white and Draco a swirl of wind above. Harry leans out from a window in the owlery, his whole body strumming loud with every swell of Draco’s broom. He longs to be swept up; to take off. He wants to grow wings and fly.
"That's what I said, aren't you listening?"
“But I have my father’s eyes.”
"Now, hold on. I don't know many pointy blonds in my life, but..." Ron starts, his brows furrowed in slow-dawning mortification.
Hermione blinks. "Really? I mean, really? Sorry, I don't mean to sound so derisive. Sorry, it's just that I know I'm not supposed to say sorry, they always say—"
, the bagger assured me, but could I trust him? I didn’t know what plastic was, but paper, I knew my whole life. Then, curiosity bit me again, and I said plastic. But my apples were already bagged up.
"Voldemort," Draco repeats louder.
Harry doesn’t recognise him at first. But here he is, standing in the back of his Care of Magical Creatures class—Draco Malfoy.
“Uh-huh.”
"He does?" Ron and the bartender ask simultaneously.
"Not anymore. Sensitive. Stupid, definitely, when you were younger. But not bad. Now I see." He presses his hand over Draco's quickening heart. "You're loyal."
Harry holds a hand to the wall. Solid. He presses his ear to it, knocking, and nothing echoes back. A little giddy, Harry steps back and surveys the new blank space. Maybe he'll put up coat hooks and a mirror, a shallow dish for things he'll need on the way out the door. He should write that down, though he has no idea where to procure coat hooks. He could Transfigure them, but… no, he wants something more solid. Permanent.

Draco stirs when Harry nudges him awake, rolling over to sit up with his hair mussed. "Sorry," he says. "We were cleaning out the attic, and I just got so tired, and the mattresses for the other rooms haven't been delivered yet—"
“Not my place to say.”
Hermione says the best way to win an argument is to not care. She did a lot of not caring, running for Minister and changing the world that way. It's too bad my favourite way to win an argument is to blow the brains out of the opposition.
He thumbed the page with a hesitant hand. "I'm only about halfway through, but it's all very exciting. Lots of action, and they've developed a secret code of communication with each other using flowers and mind-reading. Right now, they're trying to overturn the government, but they're arguing about ways to do it, which created a bit of a rift between them and friends they used to trust."
If time and time again serve true, then there is no reason for Harry to be at St Mungo’s that Monday. The Healer marks his scrolls and smiles his smile and says that Harry is dying and nothing can be done, the same as the week before.
Harry's thumb grazed over a nipple, a thoughtful expression flickering over his face. "Why not? You're mad, I'm mad. Let's do something more than yell ourselves hoarse over it."
“No.”
The plates were gold-rimmed and scalloped. The forks were small and silver and turned every bite into three. Harry stabbed his into the cake so that the chocolate oozed out. He wasn’t hungry; he’d stopped smelling things after the war.
"Yeah, I have my doubts too. I won't be surprised if it's all for show. You know, so that he can put on his resume that he supports Muggleborns now. Prove that he's not following in his daddy's footsteps."
“I wanted to be respectful and dress for the occasion,” Draco sniffs. “But I should’ve known better; Molly didn’t even give us a photo. I don’t know how she expects us to pick him out of the miasma of — oh.” Draco jerks to a halt, lurching Harry back into his chest.
"You weren't let on?"
Harry writes up the report in his mind. “Patient docile. Potion effective. Philosophical babble—side effect.” He wonders if it’s a minor enough side effect that they’ll write it off, ink it on the bottle in small print. It’s not Harry’s choice, and Draco’s not hurting anyone. But he is hurting; Harry can see that because he knows Draco these days. He knows how much it hurt when Draco woke from the war a werewolf. How the lines hardened on his face like he aged twenty years in one. How they soften under Harry’s touch, like wax. Softening, but never melting. Pliable, but never yielding enough to reveal the child that hides within.
"Don't see why you're kicking up a big fuss about it. You've got a thousand more to choose from," Pansy said the next morning. She'd slept over, though that was nothing new. Her new roommate snored like a hippogriff, or so she claimed. Draco suspected it had something to do with making sure Draco didn't disappear again, but he kept his silence, the Slytherin way. Besides, he liked having her around. It made living less lonely, even if she never did the dishes. Just having someone to complain to was nice. Like now.
Mother said: “The wedding should be in spring.”
Harry licks a streak of spilt coffee from the rim. "Yes? So what if I am," he smirks, nearly coy if it wasn't directed at Draco.
Pansy plucked an ancient tin of biscuits from a dusty corner and ran a finger across the top, blowing the dust off with a disgusted scoff before setting the package aside. She sighed, crossing one hand over the other before settling the weight of her full attention on Draco for the first time since she arrived. "What are you doing here, Draco? It's been months."
"Jesus," Harry says. "I'm sorry, alright? Don't have to bite my head off over every little thing I fuck up."
For @drarrymicrofic song prompt: hope is a heartache.
It's all
“Just about fifty pounds of confidence.”
It is forty minutes later when Harry’s Auror partner Ron Weasley asks him if he is alright. Says, “it can’t be easy to watch anyone go like that, even if you hated him”, and “I know I’m definitely feeling something; you don’t have to hide it if you do too”, and a few more words about how it’s totally okay if Harry isn’t okay.
Draco holds up Harry’s mobile. “They’re listening, you know.” He jabs at the camera. “Watching, too.”
Harry's still thinking about the great outside while he showers. What makes a Pensieve work? Could he take a good memory—flying over the Great Lake, maybe—and ride through it? Would it actually work out his physical body?
, but Draco shushes him with a hand.
"C'mon, Malfoy. Don't make a big deal out of nothing."
"Fuck what Malfoy says. You don't deserve any of this love," Ginny mutters to Harry.
. Then maybe someone would actually read it.
"Fucking Draco," Harry growls.
Harry shrugs. He doesn't get the Muggle fixation on moving pictures. Nobody liked Dennis Creevy until he made a movie about superheroes. Now everyone wants to kiss his arse.
Pansy snorts into her martini. “Like surprise cacti,” she repeats, deadpan.
Harry’s vision focused on Draco’s mouth. The crumb still lingering in the corner of it, forgotten. Or was he depending on Harry to remove it?
“Better?” Harry asks. He’s dressed in his Gryffindor Quidditch robes, and his face is as round as when he was eighteen.
For Scorpius: wizard chess set (charmed against breaks, for when Uncle Ron gets a wee too enthusiastic).
"Harry!" Ron hollered again.
"Sure," Draco laughs. "But not like me. Last time, we broke up over a toilet paper roll. Couldn't take a shit without him nagging about how I never replace it."
. A witch walks by with her phone pressed to her ear, loudly going on about the merits of cutting out all sugar except sugar-babying
Draco loved nothing more than a world where all the choices were made for him. He lost himself in the lives on the page, so utterly immersed, he didn't notice Harry enter the room until the bed dipped.
"It's not my problem. It really isn't," Draco says quickly. "You aren't my responsibility because you saved my life. Life debts don't work that way. Otherwise, we'd all be a million times indebted to each other without any of us knowing it. I think it's what the Muggles call the Butterfly Effect. I watched a moving picture about it."
"You'd rather I stay here and make you tea than help you—"
"Oh."
"Merlin, Harry. That's why. You only ever want one thing from me, and that's not fair. I'm not—I'm not going to just have sex with you. I thought I could, but that's not enough for me. I want...I
"Yeah, you too," Harry says.
“I met Reynolds at a party my father threw after everything went to shit. He was the only guy young enough to remember the first time he fucked someone, so, yeah. I talked to him.”
"Something for your mum?" the florist asks, wiping his hands down on his apron. "Mister…?"
"I mean,
"Jealous?"
Harry shifted from my back to touch the plastic bag. “Plastic isn’t a good thing.”
"Fine," Draco huffs. "I suppose you're right. Don't laugh at me, okay? Vol—Merlin, why is it so difficult.
. Bet that's how you—"
cw: implied major character death, grief
Harry shivered, but it wasn't from the cold. "I'm sorry," he said.
Harry crosses his arms and scowls. "I just hate them, alright? Are you going to follow me to the toilet next and badger me about why I piss?"
“You’re supposed to kiss me now,” Harry says from the edge of his four-poster bed. Thick velvet curtains fringe his forehead. A lazy, lion-like smile stretches across his face, though Draco can’t imagine him comfortable under all that chainmail.
Harry shrugs. "Haven't done it in a few years. Might be out of practice."
Harry grinned, his abs tightening as he lowered down with one, firm thrust. The bed squeaked, then everything was quiet. Draco didn't dare breathe. If he did, he was going to come. He was sure of it. Trust Harry Potter to have the slickest, tighest arsehole known to wizardkind. It was—Draco couldn't put it in words. Some arseholes just fit right.
The redhead grabs him by the scruff. “Hold on, okay?” The two make eyes at each other until the wifebeater guy backs down with a snarl. The redhead turns back to Harry. “My mom was a Weasley. What do you want?”
Ginny whines all the way to dinner about how Hermione already knows because Dean has a big mouth and is terrified of losing all his friends to Ginny.
Draco wears a smog-grey jumper when he picks Harry up that morning, though he has no logical reason to do either. His wardrobe holds fifty-five jumpers in varying colours, textiles, and states of disuse, and Harry can Apparate to St Mungo’s on his own, as he has demonstrated time and time again.
Draco waved a helpless hand at the empty shelves. "What do you suggest I do?"
"That you…um…are good…behind the bar…".
Ginny has a contemplative glow to her face. She polishes off the popsicle and starts chewing on the stick.
"You're not going to look inside?"
"So good," Harry murmurs when he's fully seated. He rolls his hips, sighing.
Answer: When someone lets you take their lucky cigarette. And you know, you know, he's the one.
Hermione shivers. Eats another biscuit. Stares, swallows, looks around.
“Someplace in between love and hate, I think, I’m not sure. Look, do you hate me for crashing your broom? I’ll buy you a new one, look,”
you do? I could kiss you right now."
, which is crap because Tuesday is as good of a night as any for going out. So it's only Ron and Harry tonight, and Harry's been trying to lose Ron since they pulled up to Nylon. Nothing's duller than a goody-two-shoes cling-on when Harry's dying for anything, anyone unexpected.
"You mix great drinks," Ron says. "I like to watch you use that hose thing that shoots out soda."
The wifebeater guy growls. “You’ve messed with the wrong —”
Harry looks up. There’s a radiance to him that feels like hot sunbeams over Draco’s face.
Harry leans back against the kitchen counter with his arms crossed. “Back into the sea, I suppose. Why?”
Ron and Hermione live atop a steep hill with a good view of the city from one side and more hill on the other. It was a hassle to get anywhere on foot. Here, however, the streets flatten out to a smooth plane, the road quiet and empty, the trees evenly spaced apart.
Ron throws back his head and laughs. "A bloke who looks out for your safety. Alright, I can get behind that. What'd you two do? Where'd you take him?"
“No, I wouldn’t have—”
Harry casts a cautious glance down at Malfoy's face. "I get that a lot," he repeats slowly. "But not usually from you." At least not lately, anyway. What happened to all that talk about what Harry deserved? "What did I do this time?"
“I don’t really think you’re dull,” Draco said after. “It’s only; he’s my father.”
“I’m dying,” Harry says later at the shore, though Draco already knows.
I spied Dolohov out my window one day and followed him three blocks to his townhouse, where he wiped his shoes on a welcome mat before shutting the door behind him. The living room lamps were lit, and I could smell meatloaf from the open window. Can you imagine that? A Death Eater, living three blocks from Harry Potter and walking around like he owned the bloody place. He must have thought I was soft.
Harry’s shuffling in the adjoining bedroom and it startles Draco so that he catches the pink lippy in the upper right corner. It says, “Have a wonderful day! I love you!”. The word love is underlined twice. Draco feels himself growing pink. He wants to rub the words off, to hide from them. He’s afraid they’re true. He’s afraid that he feels the same.
"I bought out my fucking neighbours," Harry hollers back. But he lowers the volume with a flick of his wrist.
"What about now?"
Eltanin glances at the wall clock, his lips pursed in thought. "Actually…" he says, his smile quirking playfully again, "do you want to smoke a blunt?"
Brown eyes blink quizzically back at him. "I work most nights when you're here."
, I thought.
"I can put a shirt on," Draco says, his grip tight on Harry's shoulder. "Or we can stop. Whatever. I'm—yeah, I'm. Whatever you want."
Harry doesn’t need to look to know vertigo. But he looks anyway.
Potter asked him where he was going, to which Draco replied, “Sorry I must have the wrong floor” and “Sorry about your divorce” and “Sorry about my whole life yeah okay good catching up,” and tried scrambling around Potter before remembering he was a bloody
Harry turns around. "I'm guessing you do," he grins. He reaches out a hand.
“I’m not hungry anymore,” Harry decides, and Draco nods, his eyes drooping once more, dreamy as though he never woke up. They leave the pomelo on the counter, for later.
Cobwebs pulse in place of a heart. My eyes water from more than the dust.
A cruise ship came in today, and off it ran wizards and Muggles and everyone in between, like sprigs of basil in twos and threes and more. Draco is twenty-three and prepared for the crowds as he is every July, the ice bucket double-charmed and fortified, a triple shipment of limes stocked, and extra lounge chairs laid out on the beach where only stray dogs slumber on ordinary days.
"It's hard for me to explain. It's...it's something like...I like the idea of always having an answer an arm's reach away."
“Say,” Draco is saying, “do you think, if you had a choice, you would’ve killed Voldemort with a gun?”
For drarrymicrofic prompt: androgynous. Heavily inspired by Frank Ocean’s Chanel.
Draco pushes a plate of biscuits in front of Hermione.
"Thanks to you, we hit a record number of co-riders. Unfortunately, we did not have the resources necessary to support the new demand, which resulted in a temporary outage of our services. But if you warn us next time—"
“Shut up,” Draco says, his face hot. “You didn’t tell me how it worked. I hate this stupid daydream. Why am I even dressed like barmy old Baba Yaga? Morgan le Fay would’ve been more era-appropriate. Merlin, do wank over evil or —”
Love was like that, sometimes; left out to harden into hate.
"Oh," Harry says. Affection swells within him in waves until he's sick from it.
Draco looks down at Harry's hand, the scarred remains of
He twists open the cap. “Merlin!” he hollers when the coke fizzes to the brim. I steady him before it slips from his hand.
“You’re not a throwaway, Draco.”
Harry heaves him inside and levitates the vase to the entryway table before pressing Draco against the door. He groans into Draco's mouth, his hands riding up Draco's shirt to paw at his stomach. Their position is the same as the first time, but Harry's fingers slide slower over Draco's chest while his heart beats faster and faster. Even the door itself isn't the same, solid walnut replacing the tacky gilded beast that guarded the entrance prior.
“Say, do you ever think,”
What happens next, Molly will never know, because her Harry's large arse is obstructing the bleedin'
Draco takes out the stamp pad from his drawer, unsure how to say that he half-expected a notice of Potter’s demise dropped off with his coffee this morning. He scans over the parchment before stamping it firmly and handing it back.
"I don't know." Draco's voice is muffled by something, maybe a sleeve. He sniffs. "I've never been able to help myself around you. My whole life, I've wanted you to look at me. I'm an idiot."
Pansy laid a hand over Draco's for a soft second. Then she slapped him across the shoulder, mouth morphing back into a smirk. "Well,
. Like a typical Friday night fantasy except on a Saturday and stickier. So
"Be nice," Ginny laughs.
"There is nothing wrong with being gay," Harry clarifies the next week, "except that if I weren't gay, I wouldn't be lovesick over a man who's too stupid to love me back. Also, fuck this shop. How dare they be closed — how am I going to get my coffee otherwise?"
He arrives at the venue with five minutes to spare. Someone magics his hair neat and his stubble trimmed, and then he's whisked to the podium, where he says a few words about how great Hermione is and will be for everyone in the world. His speech rings true. Hermione
you to see all of me, not only the parts you like."
"Thanks," Harry says. He hands Draco his coffee. They take a seat inside the shop, by the window. "Thanks for your kindness," he repeats when Draco doesn't look away from the outside.
Harry looked back down at his cake. It was a rich brown, dark and loamy as the earth.
before popping back to attempt about seventy different ways to break in. Harry walked in on Draco transfiguring a hedge into a ladder.
“Are you surprised?”
Harry takes out his wallet. One of Malfoy's friends brings out a little tin of salt from her purse and makes a show of licking it off of Malfoy's neck.
At best, the universe is perfectly flat and expanding at a constant rate toward the edge of infinity. Tonight, I can almost see it, shifting over my eyelids: the faint shape of a body; the familiar smell of ink.
“The waves are no good by now,” the surf shop guy insists, so they walk back onto the beach emptyhanded.
Harry takes in the cerulean blue walls, stylistic waves painted in white and charmed to ebb and flow with the wind. The restaurant's busy, and there are groups of people waiting outside for a table.
Draco pushes him away with a weak fist. "No, we can't," he says.
Draco sits down at the table and stares at the peach pit until the bathroom door opens and a steady roll of steam fills the room until everything smells of sun. The mist doesn't look anything like Harry Potter. Until it does.
"Old things have a way of making their way back home," Pansy said, giving Draco an odd look before turning back to the cupboards.
Ron takes them to Thestral & Gold and tells Harry that it's his third time back already. "The ladies love it," he says. "And they don't skimp on the margs. Good value."
For @drarrymicrofic prompt, technique! (or a lack of). happiest belated 420, my dudes
But it did.
Harry came home that evening and kissed me on the cheek, his arms heavy over my shoulders. I was still sitting at the desk. He smelled of ink. Or maybe I was smelling myself. Harry had a way of getting me to look beyond my eyes. Taste things again. I could hear the rain on him now, though his jumper remained dry, and soft. And warm.
Draco? Come over and sit next to me, will you? That’s a good boy. Breathe. You understand, don’t you? It’s for your own good. There’s nothing to forgive.
"I'm not afraid," a second voice murmurs.
They sentenced me to a year's worth of community service. The chains came off my hands as I flooded back into my own body. I wanted to cry. I yawned instead.
Harry showed him out to the backyard after, and they did lazy laps in the metres above his garden, swooping in and out of the glint of the sun and chasing a good feeling in the wind. Joy squeezed too-big in Draco's chest. It was hard to breathe around it.
"Sorry," Harry mumbles, flushing at the sudden view of Draco's bare chest.
"Yes, yes, I know. Perfect Potter forgave you for all your sins, yada-yada—"
Draco inches forward. "Can I kiss you?"
Two raps on the doorframe. “Apologises for interrupting, sir, but your three-pm—”
Harry opened his eyes. He pulled the door shut and smoothed down his robes, his eyes sliding once more over the worn, brass knob.
Harry brushes a thumb across Draco’s mouth to quiet him. Then he tells the barman to bring them another round.
"I know, Harry."

“Jesus Christ. Eggplant or peach, Potter?”
, he starts again, and gets stuck on the name.
. Malfoy's address," he decides.
“Bloody Weasleys,” Draco mutters.
“You’re not going to say it back?”
“No.”
"Well," Draco said instead. "I thought it was high time you took a turn at making tea."
"Ginny told me Malfoy volunteers for your campaign."
Hermione laughs until she's crying again.
Harry nods to Draco. "Are you going?"
Minerva purses her lips. And then she says, “One week.”
"Then why did you testify for Draco after the war? Why did you vouch for Goyle's stupidity? For Pansy? Why do you bother with Hermione's rallies, for that matter?"
Draco adjusts the baseball cap over Harry’s eyes before dropping his hands onto Harry’s shoulders. Draco’s eyes are a crisp, intelligent grey, his mouth thinned in thought.
Why had his father, who was well-practised in Arithmancy, failed to prognosticate Harry’s victory?
Their first time was an accident. "Sex pollen," Draco claims, though everyone knows it was too much Ogden's after Puddlemere beat the Tornados 240-230.

The storm comes like an upended bucket from the heavens, gator-cruel and biting, love it or leave it and nothing in between. Soon, even the blood smells of rain.
All this fame and all it buys is drugs and sex with strangers. It isn't that Harry doesn't respect women—he's gagged on a fair share of cocks himself—it's that he doesn't respect anyone, really. Least of all himself.
good at buying stuff. I'm good at other things too," Draco says, pushing Harry down onto the bed and straddling his waist.
Woodfire ash and glow. The warm hum of a song cottoning in the ear. Eyes of twin jade, cool to the touch and heavy in my fist.
It wasn't until after the party that Draco noticed his book was gone.
“Wasn’t expecting you in today,” Draco quips before he can stop himself.
Ron makes eye contact with a server and grins before flashing Harry a dismissive look. "Don't be such a prude. When you grow up with six siblings, you're bound to overhear many natural and beautiful acts of—"
Merlin's balls. When did Ron get this bloody annoying? It's not Harry's fault his stack of mail is ceiling-high every morning. So what if he misses a few?
Draco's mind was velvet forest and the cool rush of streams. They'd gotten lost, chased by snakes in the bloody shadows of oaks, until Harry came across two brooms propped against a flowering hawthorn tree. He threw one to Draco, and up and up they flew, beyond the canopy until the sky was a perpetual blue, and Harry saw Draco for the first time.
Hermione asks Harry that same question often enough—her expectations neck-high as always—but Harry expects to fail her. Malfoy, though, Harry can't brush it aside as readily. Harry groans, exasperated, and shoves off, turning to the kitchen and motioning for Malfoy to follow.
"Yes! Maybe with a few chocolate biscuits?"
"I hate my eyes, too," Draco says. There's paint smudged on his cheek.
They don't fuck after that disastrous attempt on the bed. "Bloody awkward to fuck after we've made a mess of the sheets from apology crying," Harry explains to Hermione. "I've apologised, but that doesn't do shit to erase the scars," he clarifies later to Ginny. "I hate myself," he confides to the mirror that night, because how sickening is it to run your finger over old scars and only feel a twisted satisfaction that he'll wear your mark until he dies?
“I’ll have to ask Harry,” Draco settles.
None of this explained why his book was missing.
Harry reached over and swiped the crumb off. Then he took a bite of cake and imagined muddy trainers and the forest soaked through under rain, though he tasted nothing.
Pansy threw a pastry wrapper at Harry. "Keep your corny lines within the confines of your bedroom,
," Draco grumbled. He could find a book by feel. Except this one—but Pansy was wrong. Draco simply didn't
“He had the worst Humplevort infestation I’d ever seen,” Luna says.
“It’s fine,” Harry says. He reaches an arm around and tugs Draco to his chest, their pillows already pressed together.
"God, you're stubborn," Harry said. "Fine. I'll give you this one." He gripped Draco's shoulders, hugging Draco’s hips with his knees, and rolled over, pulling Draco over his chest. Draco's cock slipped out just a bit, before sliding it back in. Snug. And there it was, what Draco wanted this whole time. Maybe his whole life.
"Fuck it," Harry says and casts an amplification charm over the bell-shaped speaker. The verse comes in booming:
.’ I miss the old Draco." She sighs, the nostalgia escaping her in a long, whistling breath.
"Draco says—"
Harry does know. The wizarding world is small and stifling traditional; there’d been maybe one divorce in the last fifty years, before the Malfoy-Greengrass Potter-Weasley doubleheader. It was a literal double header: they’d shared a line on the front page of the Prophet. Rivals, even in marital separation. Jesus. Harry needs a drink, just thinking of it.
"Not really," Harry says. He holds back a glib comment about how nothing's scary when he's died once before because it isn't true at all.
Harry heads upstairs and finds Draco sprawled out over his bed, asleep under a ceiling still magicked to a perfect sunny day from that night a week ago. "A bit excessive," Pansy declared, but Draco said Harry could have anything he wanted.
Within minutes Harry’s mind is cotton-soft and blissfully blank. It’s the best sleep he’s ever had. He buys two the next day, and swigs one down just outside the door, just before he remembers the smell of blood spilling out of Draco’s chest again.
Malfoy looks up with narrowed eyes. "Stella is my boss. She says that you're
"He'll turn around," Harry says. "He's obsessed with me. He's always been." Harry doesn't know where the confidence comes from, but the more he says it, the more it sounds true to his own ears. If he doesn't believe it himself, then who will?
"He's like a vengeful sex demon after he's lost," Harry confesses in the privacy of Hermione's kitchen. "A lustful, bitter jackhammer."
"Did you blackout last night? You couldn't have missed Pansy and—"
"You drive me crazy," Draco says. "I can't—I don't want to have this conversation in a club, half-drunk like this."

Harry fishes out another morsel of crab from the bowl. "I dunno," he says while licking his fingers. "They wanted me for the nine-am class."
Pansy dumps the bag on the counter and counts out her coins. She can hear Draco breathing from the other end of the line, but she's back on the pavement before he speaks again.

A server brings the man at the counter a plate with seven strips of bacon. The man says something, and the server laughs, red curls shaking as she pours his coffee.
Cake crumbles to the counter, falling from Malfoy's back as he sits up. Harry slides off the island and into the vee between Malfoy's legs, forcing his breathing even as Malfoy caresses his cheek. "Slow," Malfoy says in one long exhale. Harry leans into Malfoy's palm, eyes slipping shut and a warmth building in his chest.
“Doesn’t cost much to wear a leather jacket.”
He pours them bourbon into tumblers and transfigures water into spheres of ice while Draco rifles through the collection of takeaway boxes.
Draco haunted the seventh-floor corridor of Hogwarts. A Third Year found him up there one night, knocking the frames together as though trying to shake something out of them. She reported it straight to Headmaster Potter, who passed her a Cockroach Cluster and sent her off to bed with a promise to handle it.
Harry let out a peal of laughter. "No, but god—can you imagine. The look on your face—don't tell me, you
He kissed my hands.
Well. It's certainly not a movie-quality declaration of love. The crup yaps in agreement.
. He’s 99% ridiculous and 9% rude. His mouth goes faster than his brain, and despite all that he’s given into being good, that will never change.
Eltanin focuses on Harry with the same quiet consideration as he gave the pen. "Draco said you were impressive, but I didn't believe him, to be honest. I was expecting like, heroic Protegos or epic duels with Unforgivables, or something, I don't know, huge. But you really are quite remarkable, aren't you? Imposing in the most innocuous of ways."

"Bet you
"Why would I run?" Draco frowns, though the urge overwhelms him all the same, like a swift breeze threatening to sweep him away the moment the door jangles closed.
Why? Why did losing three books matter so much when he had a thousand more to choose from at home? Why, in a world full of people, was Harry Potter all Draco wanted? The answer was simple: because he loved them.
“Not if you come back, no”
"Yeah," Harry said with an apologetic smile. "You'll have to explain it to me later, then."
Harry opens his mouth, unsure.
Draco lives and breathes Arithmancy in the aftermath of the war. He studies it in lecture halls, in the university libraries. He practices it each day from the moment the morning rouses him awake. What is the probability that he will get out of bed today? What is the likelihood that he will have clean socks? He starts with simple questions—questions that don’t require the rigours of numerology—and finds solace in the certainty of their answers.

“Call me a bore again, and my feelings might start getting hurt,” Harry said, trying not to smile.
Love like a kick to the head meant for someone you love. Like breaking me out of Azkaban on dragonback; singed robes, Diffindos oozing down your arm. Again and again. Like a kick to the head. Give you all my bruises and watch them bloom across your face. Like love.
"I'm feeling awfully used right now," Harry says. He hasn't seen Dean since he got married to Ginny a year ago. "Some friend Dean Thomas turned out to be."
All Harry can think is to get his hands under it. He shoves Malfoy into the townhouse and pushes him against the closed door.
Harry blinked. "No?"
“No. It makes you sick. You begin wanting things, seeing things that aren’t there — until your eyes swim in lies.” He downs his glass.
“I like your place,” Harry says, though the narrow walls squeeze him tight, distorting the kitchen funhouse mirror style. He knows he should be agonising over something about the Dursleys, but all he can think about is how funny that even a kettle swallows up space in a small room.
“You pulled your hood up. The grey one that practically everyone owns a copy of. Even Mum Weasley couldn’t recognise you wearing that.” Then he yawned like he was waiting for Harry to leave, so he could go to bed.
"Bloody hell. Is that Malfoy?" Ron yells.
Harry considers the glow of a candle in a dark room. The way it burns, only to die. The way it eats the air thin as the breath before a kiss.
"I do." The bartender wrings the rag in his hand. "Two, actually. Did you want anything to drink?"
The potioneer’s words sound like a threat, and when Harry responds back he sounds dangerous too, or angry, at least. Harry says, “Piss off, Malfoy. I’m less dead than I was without it. It’s the only way I want to live.”
As always, Draco was late.
Harry punches him.
"We're going somewhere?"
Harry tries tracking Malfoy down after, but Malfoy's far busier than him. Harry loses sight of him, and when he checks back, Malfoy's already gone home.
The bag crinkled under his hand.
"Yeah," she says. "Yes. Ah, sorry. It's another speech." She wipes her nose with the back of her sleeve, then Scourgifies the snot away before handing him the parchment. "God, I hope the cameras didn't catch me with snot all over my sleeve."
He drops his head into the crook of my neck. I wrap my hands around his waist. His collar tickles, the yarn stretched and lived-in with the kind of wear that makes you think, yeah, somebody loves it, alright. Maybe too much. I don’t know if I’m talking about Draco, or the jumper, or both. It’s hard to stay annoyed with what’s mine, is all I’m trying to say.
Answer: Trust echoed between words, devotion clasped between hands.
"And I'm riding you like a Cleansweep 900," Harry said.
Malfoy lives with two roommates that Harry doesn't recognise but appear to be wizards from how they step into the alley to Apparate. The portly brunette leaves at around five in the morning, and then Malfoy follows after, at seven. Then, nothing happens for hours until dusk falls, and out the door emerges a black-haired bloke that Harry realises with some alarm is the bartender from Nylon. Harry waits ten minutes, and then he carefully slips past the wards and into the flat, though the cat scares him out before he gets a good look around.
What is it about a roof that oppresses? Walls like ribs caging a heart. Jaw clenched when what I want is to chew life up and hold it heavy in my gut. Mine.
Funny how you’re dead now and my Patronus comes to me like water from a river, flowing effortlessly from my wand with every memory of you. I see you in treacle tart and bacon, in the glint of the sun. In the sudden gust of wind that rocks me on my broom. And in the dead of the night when I’m the most alone, I feel your strength lending me the courage to move on.
Harry swallows in surprise, having forgotten why he called Draco first. "I'm—yeah. I wasn't lying."
"I didn’t touch Weasley's stick," Draco growled, then gasped, the breath knocked out of his chest as Harry slammed his hips down, enveloping Draco's cock in velvet heat. "Why you think—"
"The biggest mistake of my life," Harry murmurs into the dewy curve of Draco's soft navel. They'd made it onto a bed, finally—only took three shots and a promise of a blowjob—and Draco said that thing about Harry's lips again that got Harry buckling to his knees with his mouth full of spit, at least until Harry caught sight of the scars.
, and it’s not hard to imagine him slumped over his desk, quill stalled to sudden slumber, the parchment an aged, yellow relic under the bright light of a laptop screen.
Jesus Christ. “We’re
The Veil is a kinder end.
Six-thirty is too early to be alive, let alone running. Father said that exercise was an unattractive activity that Muggles pursued when they weren't clever enough to plan ahead — look at them, poor pitiful souls, too stupid to Apparate — and isn't that another thing Father got wrong? Because Draco loves the uneven pavement under his trainers, loves the harsh air in his lungs, loves how every step forward is another step back, the past unravelling at his heels.
, huh? What's it about?"
Sure, he forgets things, but Harry’s figured out a system. The potion comes in waves, leaving troughs of lucidity in the morning for Harry to jot down agendas for himself. The rest of the day follows easily as 1-2-3. One, shower. Two, work. Three, the apothecary. Every day the potioneer’s brows raise higher and higher, but he never speaks, because they’re not friends, or so Harry thinks anyway, he can’t remember why. Maybe they dated before, and it didn’t work out. It’s a shame, because the potioneer is really devastatingly attractive, with his crisp angles and flinty grey eyes, exactly Harry’s type, and Harry is lonely enough to want even through the fog of forgetfulness.
“What can I do for you?” Draco asks under his big straw hat, his smile shoreline-wide and gleaming at the messy-haired tourist that Draco realises too late is Harry Potter.
“I think it was a pretty good choice,” Harry says with his eyes unblinking and a curious lilt to his smile. Draco has the terrible, heart-fluttering fear that Harry’s toying with him like how he did all through eighth-year before Nana died and left Draco her cottage. What was it about that year that swims so easily into now? The same feelings washed ashore once more.
"Draco," Harry says. "Good to see you." He tries standing, but he's wobbly from the weed. Besides, he doesn't want to. He'd rather sink into this sofa and become one with it, another piece of furniture in Draco's life. Then he'll finally belong.
Harry's trying to listen. He really is. But Malfoy's anger only turns him on more. This is what was missing between them last time. Harry wants to slide a palm down Malfoy's chest and watch him shudder, his eyes teary with hate.
. I thought I was going to die if I didn’t eat something before I Flooed. You know that feeling when you’re in the in-between with the Floo. They say it’s better to close your eyes and breathe, like passing through the brick wall of Platform 9 ¾ for the first time. Leap of faith, better to not ask kind of deal because where
"I—" A sob wracked through Harry's chest. "I love you. You. No one else. I'm trying to keep it together because you bloody hate it when I cry. Use your
"I can't leave my clothes strewn over my mattress all the time," Harry argues without much heat, his eyes still trained on the closet door in anticipation of its undoing.
"Do you remember me?" Harry asks, keeping pacing. "Harry Potter, do you remember?"
," Ginny agrees empathically. "She's so bloody caught up with perfecting the future that sometimes I wonder if she'll let us in once she's finished with her utopia. I mean, we're fucked up. We won't belong."
"Thanks, thanks so much, Mr Potter," the attendant said and helped Harry set up his folding chair between platforms nine and ten before leaving for more essential matters. A little boy wearing a Puddlemere jersey asked for Harry's photo, and then some more time passed.
Harry's eyes were so very green. Draco wanted to close them, kiss the lids. Tuck into that warm crook of a shoulder. He was completely, utterly fucked.
"What was he like?"
“Sure. But that doesn’t make me any less sick.”
for june’s run of the drarry discord drabble challenge. the prompt was “night of summer stars” 💫
"Thanks," Harry says. "Um. I don't want to be a stalker or anything, so I guess just mention that they're from me."
"Chocolate. Nice," Hermione says. She lifts one to her mouth and bites the Malfoy crest neatly in half. The sweetness spreads across her chest to her hand. She wriggles her fingertips.
Harry peels off the Statis charm and sniffs. Passable. He catches another before it smacks into his face. Then another, and another. Malfoy sends over twenty boxes in total, fifteen of which haven't spoiled, and pulls out all of Harry's good china (a gift from Molly, who should have known better) from dusty cabinets so he can plate the selection. There's caviar and oysters with generous squeezes of lemon and hot sauce, half flanks of steak oozing hot from a reheat. There's a half-empty bottle of Fiji and plastic containers of guacamole, kao soi with a side of garlic bread, toro and uni and hamachi over a bed of reinvigorated chips, duck tongue and lengua from that time Harry got curious and didn't regret it.
A slyness creeps into his grin, though his eyes burn the same brilliant green as I remember, always a shade too intense for polite conversation. “I’ve got the night off and a bottle of wine waiting for me at home, if you’re interested in joining,” he says.
Harry covers Draco’s face with his palm. Presses. Moves, presses.
“Thing’s scarcely useful now that they’ve got regulations on everything. Can’t cast a Bat-Bogey charm without some low-level Auror showing up at my door. Say,”
Harry takes Draco’s hand and kneads it; kisses it tender. “Relax,” he grins, showing his teeth. “We’ve got time. We’ve got a whole lifetime of it.” And then he pulls off his shirt and runs straight for the waves.
for @drarrymicrofic prompt: From Eden by Hozier
Draco leaves the perfumed invitation on his bedside table half-folded in a paper doily, pink ribbon unknotted and crumpled to the side, the morning light a hot slice of summer lancing across the front.
Ginny chokes. "I was kidding," she says, but she gamely follows him into the living room with her wand out. They take turns Vanishing the ugly square ottoman, the weird geometric art, the tacky antler chandelier. The industrial coat rack, the tentacle-like floor lamps, the marble coffee table. The shelves of dusty medallions, signed Snitches ("maybe I'll keep Gwenog's," Ginny says, squirrelling it away), the ashtrays, even. There isn't a single thing that Harry likes about the place where he lives, so it all disappears to nothing, one after another.
"You said we were friends," Harry says. "As your friend, I'm pretty sure I'm allowed—"
“You missed a—” Harry said. He stopped, startled at his own voice, thin and scratchy and old.
. Who is he if he doesn't hate Malfoy?
“What?”
if only he’d left the blood to burn
That's it. He'll call Draco.
I sigh, twisting up toward him.
“That’s it, what?”
Harry snorts. "I never asked you if you thought I'd win against Voldemort."
"You seriously think that I
His words sound strange to him, dreadful in their heavy despair. He’s mortified by how hateful they are, and he wants to take them back.
Harry recalls the boys in the office, red-faced and squirming in overstuffed chairs; their glue-on moustaches drooped pathetically over gaping mouths. He can’t help but laugh.
"Come on," Harry said. "You're about as slow as Ginny's broom today."
"You're really excited to see me, aren't you?" Harry laughs.
"Pansy probably paid them off," Ginny whispers to Harry. To Dean, she yells, "Thank you for aiding my prison escape, dear ex-husband!", and cackles when Dean turns bright red, his head spinning around like an owl's scanning for anyone who might have witnessed his embarrassment.
“Stop,” Draco says. “Stop. Apparate. I can’t —”
“Don’t call him that.”
"Going through a lover's things in a hunger to know his entire world in your heart." Draco's face flushed. "It's hopelessly intimate."
“Alright,” Draco agrees because summer never ends in summer. They walk barefoot to his nana’s cottage, where they bring in the linens sun-washed from the heat, and Draco finally cuts into the tart that he baked that morning for luck.
“Your cheek,” I say. I made the first cut—a stray shard of porcelain during a nasty fight. I didn’t do it on purpose. I
"Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a baby. I have no blood on my hands."
“Did you say you crashed?”
“You drunk owled me an hour ago!” Malfoy crowed.
"I work here," Harry said. "Why are
"You give so much without asking for anything back. Take Granger's campaign. You'll campaign for her even though it kills you, and you get nothing to show for it at all. I just want to see you get what you deserve."
"They're not my type," the bartender continues gamely whilst pouring fresh drinks, "I prefer my blokes a bit more freckled, and, well…ginger." He winks again.
"I deserve it," Harry says, nearly says,
"I thought it was some sort of terrorist attack," Harry says.
A gnome peeks up from under a lemon bush. Harry thinks about chasing after it, spinning it out of orbit and watching it fly at some specific km/h privy only to the universe. Whatever he feels for Malfoy, it’s not what Ron holds for his daughter. Harry’s just a fan.
Harry looks up, eyes wet.
“We’re closed,” I say to Potter’s right hand, still hovered over the countertop.
Inside are tables stacked with chairs and a funky retro menu board. What a funny little cafe. She'll have to tell Ron about it when she gets back.
Does he?
“Minister?”
Up went shelves on every wall. Shelves pushed beside the fireplace mantle. Shelves lined up the stairs, behind the toilet, under the beds. Shelves spaced neatly between windows, shelves under the tub! All the space for all the lives he could have lived. Draco would have covered every inch of the house in shelves if the house didn't refuse in the end, spitting out a mouthful of nails to clatter at Draco's feet.
“Weasley? Ian Weasley?” Harry asks.
Harry curls a hand around Draco’s wrist. “You’re not.” He tucks the gun back in his belt.
"How was your lunch with Hermione?" Draco asks.
Some bloke comes around with a camera, so they pose for a photo. He stops Harry when he tries to smile because he says it'll look less authentic that way. So Harry scowls while Ron beams beside him, and Dean gets the photo op he wants for his adverts.
Draco wears a lilac hoodie and stonewashed shorts that cut high up his thighs. His neon kicks stick out the window where he's propped them up. The sun/shade cleaves him through; two-toned light and dark, the left part of his long hair a halo and the right shorn clean off.
he simply sits up and walks to the bathroom to brush his teeth.
Draco raises a brow at his reflection. It stares back, a dare.
, he mouths. Please.
Okay is a word with four letters, nonrepeating. Okay means both not very good and not very bad, which means neither good nor bad, which means nothing much at all. Harry feels vaguely okay in that he feels how it feels to feel nothing. His mind is washed through and emptied of noise, and everything is exactly how it is because it is.
Fresh drinks replace their empty glasses. Ginny gamely tries a chip before spitting it out onto the table. "What's wrong with serving regular chips? Ugh. I hate it when people overcomplicate things for no reason at all." She holds out a sweet potato chip for Harry to try.
Harry keeps rolling off the bare mattress on the floor of his bedroom throughout the night, waking in a tangle of limbs with creases on his cheek from the floorboards. He does a lap around the barren townhouse and clocks an hour on the BroomBod. He snapped off the ugly industrial shower head in his bathroom last night, so he's forced to turn a wand on himself to get clean.
Does Draco remember —
Harry hates politics, and it's all they ever want him to do. He's getting a headache just listening to Ginny talk about it.
"You're pissed."
"It's sad they can't see how they all want the same thing, and how in-fighting only weakens their cause. I bet someone’s going to apologise by the end. I bet that's what this story is about: love and forgiveness."
"And you did as you were told. Wild. Let me guess...it was either that, or he wouldn't suck your cock."
“You know, vids of men fucking.”
Pansy’s flashing her tits on stage, and all Draco can do is yell, “THAT’S MY BEST FRIEND! THAT’S MY BEST FRIEND!”
"Touch me," Draco says. Harry's hand is halfway there; another second, and it's wrapped around their cocks, already slick from precum.
Harry catches Malfoy's wrist in his hand on an impulse, though he has no idea what to do once he has it. So he lets it drop and rolls over onto his side, feigning sleep while Malfoy gets dressed to leave.
Draco flies through the open window of his sixteenth-floor studio flat where he lives alone. His kitchen is in his living room and his living room is in his bedroom, and in the middle of it all is a table with a plate. On the plate is a single peach pit and the ghost of something that still smells of treacle. There's someone singing in the shower.
The pizza: delicious. Was there a more perfect creation than baked dough and sauce and cheese? A gift from the gods only second to Harry Potter himself. Draco closed his eyes and followed his nose, his head dizzy and his movements off-balanced.
"I looked at you," Harry says into the phone. "I look at you all the time."
"You're too drunk to Apparate," Malfoy pants.
Draco snorts. "The whole block knows that, Granger." He casts his gaze out the window before turning to look Hermione straight in the eye. "But do you?"
"He's coming?"
“It’s only eight, Draco. We’ve got time.” Harry’s words rumble through him like the dull roar of an ocean wave, lulling Draco back down the depths of sleep.
"Uh-huh." A wry smile plays at the corners of Draco's mouth. "I
"I stand by my innocence," Draco sniffed. He steadied his gaze on Harry, waiting for the usual witty repartee. But Harry's mouth stayed shut, his hands fidgeting with the hem of his jersey. His eyes met Draco's for a brief second, and then he was pulling the jersey off.
"Merlin, please," Harry says.
was what I’d written. So Draco came and dusted and kissed my temple and left for a late lecture. And, just like that, I could breathe again.
The space left is as dusty and dim as the inside of a coffin, long enough for a skinny orphan to lie down, though it's hard to imagine that as Harry's head hits the top of the doorframe. He pushes the door firmly shut. "Let's not," he says. "Bloody hate closets."
“Are you what?”
Harry's throat clots and deepens. "What is it about, then?"
"Ready?" Ginny asks. Ron holds up one finger while wiping his mouth on the back of his sleeve.
"I wouldn't have given you his address if I knew how much of a fucking creep you'd be," Ginny says.
cw: recreational drug use, questionable Science, questionable Writing if I am perfectly honest
“She’s too much,” Granger says to Draco. “I can’t keep up.”
“You’ve got something in there,” Draco informed Potter, to which Potter only smiled and held up his hands like he had nothing to conceal. So Draco had him take off the coat, the waistcoat, the tie, the shirt, the undershirt — too many layers for a healthy man under the precise laboratorial temperature of 23.8'C — until finally, Draco’s hand met flesh, and there was nothing left to uncover except for Potter’s heart flashing blue from the alarm system.
They don’t kiss after the Fiendfyre, but Harry wonders if they would’ve if Draco had stayed, said thanks. Saving someone’s life ties you to them, inks their name in your book of cares, so worrying for Draco becomes reflexive, blends into a love that dies with the war. Like an ashwinder, risen from embers only to crumble to dust.
I am eighty now, and I have been the Master of Death for many years longer than my godfather walked this earth. I keep a quiet existence, my cottage small and my winters mellow, but even the Cloak cannot hide me from Death when it summons me as Witness. “Watch,” the beast commands, and I obey because to master Death does not mean to conquer it; only that I see it for what it is: King.
Harry kicks the tree in front of Draco's flat. He circles around it, waiting for Draco to catch his breath, to invite him in.
"You're joking," Harry says without thinking.
Eltanin is rolling their second blunt when Draco comes home.
Potter would ride you.”
Draco’s eyes round. Hesitates. “That’s… on there?”
, I getcha." Ginny makes a cha-ching sound and winks, pointing her fingers at Harry. "Well, he's not wrong. I mean, you did save the world. So, in a sense, it's yours now."
It is a half-tone day; the world washed out and left to dry. The sun rises behind shades, and Draco sinks deeper into the miasma that has become his bed. Eventually, his stomach grumbles, but nausea subdues the hunger, and a numbing chill sweeps over his skin. He stills, his breath shallow in half-breaths, half-life as though himself half-there, suspended in a translucent, catatonic consciousness. Quiet so that he can see through his guts to the back of his spine.
Come to think of it, where
“You do?”
First thing I did when I got home was to throw away the apples from last month and make room for the Muggle ones. The basket had a preservation charm weaved in, but it only lasted a couple of weeks. I tossed in the first apple from a distance, in case it exploded. Nothing happened. Apples were apples, and there was no magic beyond their taste. But I wanted to check.
"What?" Draco asked.
"No reason," Ginny says. She's as bad of a liar as Harry.
Harry drags his tongue down Draco's ear. "Let's go upstairs," he whispers. Draco shudders beneath him, nodding.
"I'm going to kill Pansy," Draco murmured, overwhelmed and angry, and stalked up the stairs in search of her. But there was no one upstairs, and Draco, too tempted by the quiet to resist, crawled back into his own bed and hid behind a book.
"Don't you? Obviously, you don't like, own the deed to it or anything. You won't get custody of it in court. But don't you feel responsible for how it's going?"
They take Harry's car to Nylon "for the full experience." Ginny rides shotgun and Ron sprawls out in the back. Harry flips on auto-drive since he's sloshed already.
“Yeah. Of course.”
“Fine,” Draco huffs. “Maybe we’ll replace the logo with something less sports-like. Like an eggplant. Or a peach? I think I’ve seen them in Muggle clothing catalogues. Or a skull, but that might be too, you know—Death Eatery.”
Delicate like the gossamer close of lids, the pale flutter of lashes; delicate like the gauzy cling of lace up the neck. Delicate fingers, slender and exacting, reaching through jagged ribs to the coarse muscle encaged, whispering Harry soft; fragile; vulnerable. He knows he can break them, but he doesn’t.
"This is…" Malfoy takes a moment to inhale the sweet citrus of a sunny breeze. "This is impressively constructed. Nearly lifelike simulation. Where did you buy it from?"
"Right. Magic," Harry says, failing to hold back a smile. "Can you do patterns?"
Except I do. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a biro-hating, old-fashioned Pureblood now than I ever was. But there is something about a man who, in a fraught, new world of instant gratification, takes time out of his day to write out his love to you with his own hand. I don’t reciprocate in kind, mind; I’ve not the patience. But I love him, and I love that he does.
"You're smiling way too damn much for
His phone rings again.
I found the mirror in the dungeon cell, positioned directly across the cot where Luna had slept those grimy last months of the war. Of course, I knew what it was. The Mirror of Erised is as old as magic itself, an artefact more holy than material. I didn't touch it at first, but I looked. And that was my mistake, wasn't it? Or maybe it was my saving grace. It's hard to know pleasure from pain when I cry all the same. Maybe it was both.
Draco grips his cup tighter, his face turned down to the pavement. "I'm not pretending," he says. "I'm trying to change."
Draco blinked. "Yes, I—" The Quidditch leathers dropped to reveal nothing but dick underneath. Draco swallowed, then blinked again, and—
Draco brings the bouquet, vase and all, to Harry's door. It's nine-am on a Saturday, and Harry's still in his pyjamas when he answers. He's embarrassed by the way his hair must be sticking up, his glasses smudged and askew on his nose.
"You—" Draco stepped back. "No. You—" The blood rushed from his head.
"Number 12 Grimmauld Place," Potter said when I stepped us into the fireplace, and off we went, spinning through the tubes until we stumbled onto his hearth, a whole two people in one.
"How could you think that, because this whole time, you've been squeezing
"Hey," the woman says, having fought her way over from the other end of the bar.
"Sure you do," Hermione says. "That's why you're moping around, scheming up all the ways you can hate him back in your bed. Because you
"Do I know you?"
"Which was it?"
"What would you say to him anyway?
Harry drives back to Nylon, like he's done every night this week, and waits. The bartender brings him a gimlet and asks how his day was. Harry replies with one-word answers, his jaw clenching tighter with every passing minute.
“Enough today,” he says, and I give in to him this once.
Run-on sentences, broken up with laughter; their vows a messy to-do list of hopes and dreams. Harry finds himself searching for Draco in the crowd and spots him a couple rows ahead, a glint of gold under the afternoon sun. Draco looks back briefly, a small smile flashing that, when gone, takes a part of Harry with it.
Maybe it’s because Draco’s not used to Potter on the field, or perhaps it’s because he’s always been hung up on Potter’s every move, but no one else seems to notice how Potter never takes a day off, never so much as scrapes a knuckle during missions. Draco’s heard of such sorcery before, but it’s Dark Magic, locked away behind heavy wards and shrouded in cautionary tales of damnation and destruction for all who seek its powers.
Draco writes.
"You aren't seriously—" Malfoy swallows. "I'm not. I don't want to mix work with whatever we've been doing—" He breathes out slowly, warm against Harry's neck. "You're drunk."
Harry closes his eyes and groans, his hips spasming over cotton sheets. He cleans himself off with a wave of his hand before sinking back down into the bed, his forehead still sweaty.
"Nuh-uh," Harry said. "Out of my hand." He boinked Draco's nose with the cheesy tip.
