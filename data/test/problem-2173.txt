‘What?’ Came the bored response, the owner not even looking up from the piece of parchment he was writing on. .
It felt like every time he got the blonde out of his head he would catch a glimpse of him walking down the hall or he would be in Harry’s next class.
Draco grinned and sat up to straddle Harry’s waist his own cock hard again as he rose up and impaled himself on Harry.
Before long he was panting, his eyes screwed tight shut, feeling the water running down his body and the heat of Draco’s mouth on his neck pressing kisses into his skin and biting him in a way that Harry knew would leave a mark.
‘You’re useful to have around.’ Draco chuckled and Harry rolled his eyes. ‘In more ways than one.’ Draco purred running fingertips over Harry’s chest and he immediately became hard again.
‘Is this okay?’ Draco asked quietly but clearly, pressing kisses to Harry’s neck and jaw as his fingers slowly explored Harry’s chest.
She wasn’t the only one acting strangely either as he looked to Hermione’s left and saw that Ron was red faced and avoiding eye contact. Whilst Ron was quick to blush this particular reaction was something Harry expected more of Ron when someone like Fleur was around, not when he was just eating some breakfast.
‘And I once threw one of those badges at Ron’s head.’ He said. He didn’t know why he was telling Malfoy that other than out of some baffling desire to hear that laugh again. There was something missing from Malfoy’s grey eyes. A light that Harry had always expected to see whenever he and Malfoy were butting heads that Harry hadn’t seen since well before the war.
He had snuck out of the Slytherin common room so late the night before he must not have noticed that he took the wrong tie and had then been so tired when dressing that morning that he had not noticed.
He smacked his head up into Malfoy’s own and connected with his forehead, pain exploding behind his eyes. Not the smartest move but the one available to him.
‘Huh,’ Harry said processing the information slowly, ‘Ginny does like to say that ‘everyone’s a lot gayer than you think.’ Harry mused.
For that reason he had almost jumped out of his skin when he had turned to his left and seen the person he had just been thinking about sitting on the chair a few away from his.
Harry withdrew his fingers and lined himself up but stopped and Draco wined at the loss at sensation.
Harry just grinned to himself as he pulled on clothes, by the time he was dressed Draco seemed to finally be satisfied with his hair and he took Harry’s hand and began to lead him from the changing room.
Draco caught the bartender’s attention again and made a gesture that got him scurrying to make Harry another drink.
He grabbed the front of Malfoy’s shirt and slammed their lips together in a bruising kiss. Malfoy gasped as Harry tackled him to the mat, using his gasp as an opportunity to slip his tongue into his mouth.
‘This is quite kinky from you Potter, I didn’t expect you to be into choking, thought maybe you were more vanilla. I’m pleasantly surprised.’ He said in a strained voice.
‘I don’t remember you at the Battle either Smith, I remember you abandoning the DA, I don’t remember you ever having to think about fighting your own family, I remember you being a self-absorbed prick, so I suggest you keep that fat mouth of yours shut about things you don’t understand a damn about.’ He said he voice dangerously quiet.
‘Anyway,’ Malfoy said looking down at Harry from above, ‘I can fight and flirt at the same time, I’m multi-tasking’.
‘I think,’ She murmured to him quietly, ‘That you and I would be better suited, you can keep me practised and I can help perfect and sharpen your technique’ She offered.
He swallowed the rest of his drink and stalked onto the dance floor taking the hand that Draco reached out for him and pulling him off the dance floor towards the door to the smoking area.
At the beginning he had been kind but firm that he needed time to ‘adjust’ and ‘get over Ginny’ and by the last he was irritable and embarrassed.
Harry had to fight the urge to press his face into Teddy's hair and squeeze him. He loved him so much it almost hurt. Why had he stayed away so long? He'd missed so much, he never wanted to miss another moment.
"Would you believe," said Draco brightly, "My delight of a probation officer swears to me that she definitely did her part six months ago and that I should starve just a little longer."
"Hermione…" said Ron slowly. "I meant the stuff about Malfoy. Don't you think it's weird he agreed so quickly to volunteer after hearing Malfoy was there? It's going to be sixth year all over again!"
Harry found himself thinking about four-poster beds that night, trying to imagine whether tying people up to one would appeal to him. With Ginny — god, no, she'd hate to play the damsel, especially with Harry, and the whole thing felt wrong — would
then they could, say, offer to pay for a night in a hostel, or buy me a suit for an interview, or recommend me next time they hear about a job opportunity with an unfussy employer. But you don't just go
"Fine, I'll buy them," said Harry, laughing at Malfoy's scowl. He pulled the LP out of Malfoy's hands and turned to the shopkeeper, who was watching the exchange with amusement.
"What would you know about it?" said Malfoy, eyes narrowed in perfect hatred. "It's not like you invited any to your little hero club."
Harry was so distracted he let Kreacher give him the full tea service, and when he returned upstairs Malfoy and Dean were talking again.
"Parkinson," said Harry, copying Draco's habit of turning formal when he couldn't summon anything genuine. "It was — nice to see you. I hope the rest of your trip is pleasant."
Harry sighed again, staring at the bubbles in the sink as though they held the secret to escaping his inevitable embarrassment.
And then Ginny whooped and the two of them broke apart, Dean's hands falling away from Seamus's hips in slow motion, Seamus still so close that he had to arch his neck to look up at Dean.
"One Yves Saint Laurent jumper," read Dean. "Two pairs of stonewash jeans, one pair of combats in sage, one pair of walking boots, one pair of Converse All-Stars, two packs of socks, two white t-shirts, two green t-shirts, one long-sleeved grey top, one denim shirt, one green flannel shirt. Shit, Harry, this is a lot of money."
"No, it's not," said Hermione, repressing a grin. "It's very serious and very illegal and it could have dire consequences. I can't imagine what your brother was thinking."
"Well, to be fair, sometimes stuff slips out about magic," she said, grinning. "They just think I have delusions. You know, from all the trauma."
Harry and Draco looked back up to the house, in unison. Seamus was hanging out of the third-floor window, hair ruffled and grin wide. Draco's muscles tensed under Harry's palm; Harry reached down and squeezed his hand. He squinted up at Seamus, shaking his head. Dean stuck his head out, beside him, saw Harry and Draco on the lawn, and rolled his eyes.
"Look, I'm sorry he's like that, but it's not my fault," muttered Harry, as everyone bickered over setting up.
Neville seemed too happy about the first part of the sentence for Harry to have much faith he'd taken the lesson of the second half.
"Something like that," Harry agreed. "And yeah, he is from serious money. I thought he'd left the country, but I guess not."
"Lesson one," said Malfoy, smirking. He pulled out his wand and muttered something, and the sticky mess covering them vanished.
Harry spent the morning reading the same three sentences of his book repeatedly, scanning all the week's Pamphlets, and had finally taken to flipping through the Littlewoods catalogue and wondering if he needed a wristwatch when the door to the drawing room opened.
Harry's body was hot all over from the barrage of compliments, and it was taking all the energy he had not to crush his lips to Draco's. Draco's eyes were sliding away again, the pale skin of his cheeks flushing. Harry was close enough to see the capillaries blooming across his ice-white skin.
"Maybe I'm Malfoysexual," said Harry, then had a terrifying vision of himself in a clinch with the Malfoy father and shut his brain down on the idea.
It was a very long moment, that could have been a minute or could have been an hour, before Malfoy pulled himself up from his position on the sofa to glare at Harry.
Harry wondered just how far Draco was planning to undress him, because he wasn’t sure he would be able to say no if Draco stripped him naked and rode him right there on the table.
As Harry sat at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall having returned to Hogwarts after the Christmas break, he could tell something was seriously wrong. Hermione was giving him a look somewhere between exasperation and embarrassment that Harry didn’t like, despite becoming very accustomed to it over the years, and it was stopping him from enjoying his toast. He strongly associated that look with explaining one of his, arguably, paranoid theories to a teacher and it was difficult not to cringe slightly.
‘I think you had a lack of choice,’ Harry said, ‘I think we’re both teenagers who should never have had to make the decisions we made, to even be in the situations we were in.’
Draco threw it to rest on his own shoulder and withdrew Harry’s Gryffindor tie from the back pocket of his trousers and began the process of tying it round Harry’s neck.
The way Malfoy spoke to Harry and the way he acted around him had the same charge it had always had, created the same energy in Harry that it always had, but now that the anger and the violence had gone out of it, it felt completely different. He felt almost magnetised to the boy standing in front of him, sleeves rolled up, tattoo on full display.
‘The whole party is very cool,’ Harry said, searching for something to say, ‘You guys really went all out.’
‘That was more than flirting.’ Harry grumbled, but he got his hand round Draco’s hard length and fished it out of his jeans, swallowing it down in one fluid motion.
In just his underwear, one of Draco’s shirts (that he couldn’t properly button up due to his broader frame) and his hair wilder than normal it would’ve been an insult to pretend Narcissa didn’t know exactly what was going on.
‘Yes well I was expecting to get some attention this morning,’ Draco said in a playfully sulky voice, but then something shifted in his tone, ‘I worried when I woke up and you were gone.’ Draco said quietly, not quite meeting Harry’s gaze.
Draco let himself fall backwards onto his elbows and then watched Harry as he scanned him. His clothing slightly askew, his hair mussed, his eyes bright. Harry decided he looked good enough to eat.
‘Can we just agree to get along,’ It felt weird to say the words to the back of his head and Harry felt that old irritation at the git as the other boy continued to write on his price of parchment. ‘I don’t care if it means we just stay out of each other’s way or whatever I can’t be bothered to hate you anymore.’
It seemed Draco would rather lose the fight than say something too risky in front of such a large audience. It seemed like maybe Draco didn’t want to out Harry and something about that almost made Harry want to throw the fight.
‘You’d be dead by now,’ he said to Malfoy, panting a little as the other man focused on catching his breath.
‘Yeah well my parents weren’t being threatened, everyone has a price,’ Harry said as he watched Draco twist the ring, ‘I made my decisions to protect the family I have just like you did.’
Draco turned and smiled when he saw it was Harry before he stood gracefully and dropped onto the sofa with Harry.
She looked concerned as she watched Harry, obviously catching something of the wildness in Harry’s eye.
‘But no, I agree with you on one thing Potter, I’m too tired to bother making badges or compose songs.’ Malfoy said as he turned back to his page.
Harry had wanted to ask questions about that but decided he didn’t want to push his luck. He knew from Luna only bits and pieces about her time at Malfoy manner but he did know she had struck up some kind of bizarre friendship with Malfoy. Two teenagers that were prisoner in that house not one. It had been another reason he’d gone to defend Malfoy at The Trials.
‘I didn’t see what he did Potter, if I had you know I wouldn’t have tolerated it either, but for the moment you cannot take things into your own hands like this. Whether you like it or not you are a role model to a lot of these students and your actions have consequences. I will see you in my office Wednesday evening.’
This was not a popular option for any members of the Gryffindor team, most preferred to shower back in the dorms in Gryffindor tower but if the room was empty Harry quite enjoyed the peace and quiet.
It had started a chain of fortnightly parties with the different houses rotating hosting duties and, on this occasion, it had been Slytherin’s turn to host.
‘That was so much fun.’ Luna said dreamily, appearing next to Ginny’s shoulder with a vague smile, ‘Hello Draco, this is such a nice table isn’t it.’
‘It’s very clever.’ Harry said, trying to hide his blush that had been caused by the insinuation that the chairs around the room were specifically so that couples could make out undetected.
He almost wanted to ask if he had something on his face, but he’d been too tired and irritable to bother.
Every time he caught the sight of white blonde hair or a flash of grey eyes he was reminded of Draco and his cheekbones and his forearms.
Draco caught Harry looking at his lips after one such joke and he just smiled that cocky smile, taking a sip from his beer, his grey eyes burning.
Someone must have overheard there break up though, either as it happened by the lake shore one afternoon as Harry had promised she would always be one of his best friends or as it was recounted to Ron and Hermione later, the former gobsmacked and the latter trying to be as supportive as possible even as Harry was sure she was pleased with herself for having already guessed. By the evening meal everyone in the school knew that Ginny Weasley was gay and that Harry Potter was single.
His sheer shirt was an iridescent green that shimmered as he moved, partially tucked into his tight black jeans. His eyes were lined to make them look darker making the grey stand out and his long blonde hair was loose around his face. His fingers, wrist and neck were bedecked with dainty pieces of jewellery. The whole outfit showed off how delicately he was built and complimented his sharp features.
‘This is subtle.’ He murmured quietly, although he knew that in the silent hall at least a dozen people would have heard his remark.
Malfoy dove for Harry, taking him down onto the mat once more, getting a leg over his own, and pinning his arms above his head.
‘It’t not that I don’t want to,’ He said, turning to face him fully, ‘It’s just that it will kick off around here, its going to be in all the newspapers, I’m going to get death-threats again, and that’s fine,’ Draco said quickly before Harry could interrupt. ‘That’s to be expected, but I want to enjoy the anonymity for a while, have you just to myself for a bit before I’m willing to share this.’
‘Just doing my bit professor.’ He said with a grin. Harry was sure he saw McGonagall’s lip twitch before she turned to him.
All ability to put another sentence together completely left him however when Malfoy reached into his sweats and wrapped a hand around his aching prick. He’d practically been half-hard since Malfoy opened his mouth and the friction of that calloused hand sliding up and down him was perfect.
His head fell back onto Draco’s shoulder, his eyes fluttering shut as he focused only on the sensation of Draco touching him.
As they sat chatting Harry couldn’t help but notice that whenever they spoke, whilst it always started friendly it descended into something more seductive.
‘Pleasantly so.’ Malfoy replied before he moved up onto his elbows to kiss Harry again. Harry felt hands on his chest and then Malfoy pushed him roughly away. ‘But you’ve seen nothing yet.’
‘More difficult to do that when I’m actually fighting you again.’ Draco said, but there was nothing malicious in his voice, in fact he sounded more teasing.
Cool pale knuckles brushed against his Adam’s apple and he had to refrain from biting his lip, instead opting to raise his eyebrows at the boy who was so clearly enjoying the show he was putting on.
‘Malfoy’ He said, trying to catch the boy’s attention, from where he sat a few seats up ahead of Harry.
‘Potter may I have a word.’ She asked over the clamour or students grabbing bags and leaving the room.
‘Don’t give me that look Harry, we knew you were dating someone, especially after you kept sneaking away from the Burrow over Christmas and we guessed it might be a Slytherin because you didn’t tell us about it, we just didn’t know which Slytherin it was. I thought it was Blaise.’
‘We didn’t have to fight to get like this Harry, you could’ve just asked nicely.’ Malfoy said with a sweet smile. Sweat was beading on his forehead and his hair was a mess, falling out of the bun he had tied it back in. If Harry’s hands hadn’t been pinned either side of his head he might’ve reached out a hand to card his fingers through that white blonde hair.
‘You always do that, you’re too forgiving, you give too much and expect nothing in return.’ Draco said, finally turning his head and opening his eyes to look at Harry.
‘Have dinner with me.’ Harry blurted out, drunk on the close proximity of the person who’d been occupying so many of his thoughts.
Draco stepped back, admired his work, and used Harry’s tie to pull him towards him in a kiss before he dropped down onto the bench next to him and pulled a plate towards himself.
Harry grit his teeth, hating the implication on Draco’s behalf, but Draco was his usual charming self.
Harry tried his best not to flush red at the realisation that the reason he had been receiving more stares than usual and his own best friends didn’t know how to speak to him was because he had been wearing a tie that was not his own.
Harry had taken an instant liking to her, she was precise and brilliant with a wand but firm and took no nonsense from anyone, even Harry.
‘You actively defended me and my mother at The Trials. At best I wouldn’t have been able to come back here, at worst I would’ve been sent to Azkaban.
As Harry tried to get used to the tight, warm sensation he began to set a rhythm, moaning as he thrust in.
‘No I want to take a shower, I don’t want to have to walk up to the castle like this,’ He said, gesturing down to himself. Over the course of the training session he had executed a poorly timed dive that had resulted in him coming off his broom and skidding into the muddy pitch. He had been covered head to toe in muck. ‘Don’t wait up for me.’ He added.
I couldn’t sleep that night. Anxious anticipation filled me as the year approached. I couldn’t wait to see Harry, hopeful to make up for the last time we spoke. Despite it only being two months, it felt like years since I saw him. I felt I had aged years with Voldemort constantly breathing down my neck. The weight of my coming allegiance drained most of my life from me. Despite having no great love for Hogwarts, I rejoiced at the reprieve from Voldemort. Despite only being fifteen, I feared that we were no longer kids. Voldemort made certain of that the moment he duelled Harry —
“I promise,” He whispered before pressing a sweet kiss against my lips.  I could feel us both smiling into the kiss.  We spent the rest of the night talking as we usually did, but I could feel a tension in my gut I wasn’t used to.  I could see that me not saying ‘I love you’ was making him upset to some extent.  I hated the slight pang of sadness that would pass through his eyes as my moment for saying it passed in silence.  I hated how his kiss lacked for a moment before fully relaxing into me.  I hated that I knew I was hurting him but still couldn’t bring myself to say it.  He kept promising that he understood but understanding why and hurting regardless are two different stories.
“Amazing.”  Draco turned to face Harry with a lazy smile.  They shared a quick kiss before Harry shifted.
“Except pointing out that she’s stupid and incompetent!” Harry huffed, crossing his arms.  He looked like a young child being told they couldn’t have a lolly.  I sighed.
“He’s alone now.  If you can catch him in the hall, maybe you can slip him the note then!”  I rolled my eyes.
“I still care about you.”  I placed my hand on his neck and brushed my thumb against his cheek.  “I’d do anything for you.”  Harry finally turned back to me again and nodded.
Harry’s hand travelled up Draco’s shirt, running over the slightly raised scars that littered Draco’s chest from the Sectumsempra.  Draco gasped and shivered from the touch.  No one had touched his scars — hell, no one had seen them since he got them.  Harry pulled away brows stitched together.
“Pansy, seriously, I love you but you have got to stop elbowing me there.  I’m gonna have a bruise,”  I scolded her, not bothering to look up.
"Hmm?" Draco froze with Harry so close. He was acting much more casual than Draco ever would have expected, especially after all the time that had passed. "Um sure."
“So, what did you think of the movie?” Harry asked, nuzzling himself into Draco’s neck as the end credits rolled.  Draco hummed at Harry’s warm breath tickling just under his ear.
“I didn’t agree to the bet, Pansy,” I whispered back before plastering a smirk on my face and approaching the pair.
I felt an anger bubble inside me.  It dissipated as I kept staring into Harry’s eyes and was replaced by an overwhelming crushing weight on my shoulders.  Harry saw my father come to Voldemort’s side.  I knew he was an ex-Death Eater.  Ex.  He was under the Imperius curse.  He was.  But if what Harry was saying was true…  My mouth was dry when I finally tried to speak again.
The enclosure was surrounded by similar smaller trees, the red vines weaving around the outer trees and eventually ending on the ground.  The forest foliage fades into thick green grass covering the field.  Towards the right, a small pond lapped gently against the surrounding sand, and off to the left, wildflowers danced across the rest of the area.  It was secluded, empty, and, well, beautiful.  Plus, you couldn’t really just stumble across it, so it's relatively safe.
This became a semi-regular occurrence.  If Draco had to wake Harry, he'd first try yelling, and if that didn't work, he'd quickly cast
“I trust you.”  We ate in silence for a few minutes before the Trio walked in, looking varying levels of miserable.  Harry looked exhausted, his face dark and scowling.  They quickly sat down together and dove into the meal.
“Very good.  It started a bit tense, but then I just told him, and everything just got instantly better.”  I smiled.  “He said he likes me too and that I’m apparently not very subtle at all.”  Pansy began laughing uncontrollably.  “It’s not true and not that funny!”
"We were just a couple of kids at the time, thought we were too young to die." Despite his best efforts, Harry couldn't stop thinking about that face. It's not him, you know that. Malfoy wouldn't show up to Edinburgh pride, much less with rainbow hair. Harry shook it off and tried to turn his focus back to his performance. "But life changes just like that, and there's just no going back."
“I saw it in Divination.”  She looked at me seriously before cracking a small, tight smile.  I choke on some pumpkin juice.
“CEDRIC DIGGORY!”  The great hall erupted with cheers from the Hogwarts students.  I clapped. It wasn't like I knew him, just respectful. In the midst of celebration, Pansy nudged my arm and whispered: “Look!”
“Hey, hey, hey,” He groaned.  Draco stopped his hand and looked up with wide eyes.  “Everythings okay, I just don’t wanna…” Harry motioned with his free hand and Draco let out a soft chuckle.  Draco stood up in front of Harry, pulling them together by the hips.  Harry’s hands instantly went to Draco’s arse, giving it a squeeze.  A whiny laugh escaped Draco and he reached up for a kiss.  Harry tugged the waistband of Draco’s briefs before breaking the kiss and dropping to his knees, bringing the briefs down with him.
“Send it.”  She whispered.  I glance around, waiting for a busy moment to drop the note next to Potter.  I stepped behind two Gryffindor boys and dropped the note as I walked past, grabbing a knife from the shelf and some leaves from the jar Snape had placed out.  As I walked back, I watched Potter notice the note, contemplate it, take it, open it, contemplate it again, pocket it and stand up to get materials.
Pansy gave me a concerned look and elbowed me in the ribs. She nodded her head towards the door and raised her eyebrows at me. I nodded slightly and followed her out, silently.  It wasn't until we got into an alcove that she looked at me.
This became the new norm — once one of them moved to the other's couch, they would just stay there.  After helping each other, they'd shift back to opposite ends, Draco's arm draped over the back of the couch.  His long fingers almost brushed Harry's shoulder.  Harry was hyper-aware of this, always making him flush slightly.  Occasionally, Mittens would join them in the space between them, effectively distracting them from their work and usually leading to abandoned books and a very happy cat.
but somehow our wands met and all these lights started sparking out.  Then these… these echoes of Voldemort’s last kills appeared — my mother and father, Cedric, Voldemort’s father, Bertha Jorkins — they spoke to me.  When the connection broke, they shielded me for long enough so I could get back to the Cup.”  Harry was no longer wiping the tears, letting them fall as he sobbed through the story.  “Cedric asked me to take his body back.  I got to the Cup and then I was outside the maze.  Dumbledore was there, and, well, you know the rest.”  He wiped the tears from his face before turning fully to look at me.  “He’s back.  He’s really back.”  I wrapped him in my arms before choking out a breath.
“Yes,” said Hermione.  “Surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
The sun was starting to peak over the treeline, warming the fresh air ever so slightly.  I head back through the green vines, carefully following the red vines back to the edge of the forest.  I take my time getting back to the castle and head back to my room. Blaise was just getting into the shower when I got back.  I grabbed a scrap of parchment and quickly wrote out a note before grabbing my school robes and leaving for breakfast.
After a long, hot shower, a makeout against the wall and a gentle massage, they returned to Harry’s bed and collapsed.  Draco laid his head against Harry’s chest.  He ran his finger along Harry’s body as they dozed off.
I quickly lost count of the days spent in my room before deciding to join my father in the drawing-room every morning. He’d receive The Prophet every day, commenting on the foolishness of the editors and the Ministry of Magic. I’d sit silently, attempting to focus on my book as he’d babble tensely. Harry’s birthday passed without recognition. A few mornings later, I entered the drawing-room to find him chuckling at a headline.
“Well,” He scoffed. I looked up. “They’ve set a trial date for him in front of the Wizengamot. It appears as though Dumbledore is attempting to bend the rules for him.” He shook his head, throwing the paper down on the side table before staring into the fire.
“Yes.  She’s a bitch.”  He sighed heavily.  I chewed on my lip for a moment.  I could feel anger lightly rolling off of Harry.
“I got it!”  She stopped pacing and turned back to me.  “Ask him to meet you by the lake — anonymously!  Just don't let him know it's you.  When he gets there, tell him your feelings, and either he'll return them or not accept it yet.  Either way, he'll know at least”.  I shook my head.
“We’ll… everything will be okay.  I promise Harry.”  My voice shook.  I prayed to Merlin that I’d be able to keep that promise.  Harry practically melted into me and I couldn’t help but hold him tighter.  “It’ll be okay.”
After a few minutes, Draco looked up to Harry and nodded.  He added more lube and added another finger.  It took less time for Draco to relax and he started quietly whining after a few minutes.  Harry smiled and moved a bit quicker, reaching deeper and up slightly.  Draco’s whines turned into quiet moans and one hand gripped Harry’s shoulder tightly.  Harry teased a third finger until Draco nodded frantically.  Despite barely working, Harry was panting from the sounds Draco was making.  His head was thrown back against the mattress, mouth open and eyes shut tightly.  His free hand was tugging at his own cock, moaning loudly.
Now months into their training, they both began coming across more complicated topics in their books.  Harry would groan every time a new difficult potion was brought up, causing Draco to look up and ask if he needed help.  Harry would deny it, but by Harry's third or fourth quiet, heavy sigh, he'd join the dark-haired man on his couch to talk through the potion with him.  Draco, on the other hand, asked for Harry's help when he came across difficult transfiguration or defensive spells, and Harry would join him on his couch.  Usually, they would return to their own couches, but one night Draco could not be bothered to move back, so he shifted to one end of the couch and lazily threw his arm over the top.
"There was this one bloke." It's fine. I'm drunk, Draco tried to convince himself. "Total prat. Couldn't stand him." Draco leaned against the bar next to Harry, leaning in slightly.
?” A quiet screech was heard across the room; several students looked away or flinched.  I clenched my jaw and drew a quick breath.  Professor Umbridge, however, did not flinch.  She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face.
Granted we weren’t too different. I couldn’t owl Pansy anything, not even to say that I’m alive. My room was the only place I could sit in peace and quiet without feeling secretive pairs of eyes watching my every move. There was not a place in the house I could speak freely, to myself or to my parents. I had to break my habit of speaking to myself to sort out my feelings when I’m alone, knowing if anything about Harry slipped, we would both be doomed. If I wrote it, there would be a very good chance it would be found. Even thinking about him was dangerous as the Dark Lord was a very powerful legilimens. I could feel him creeping into my thoughts often, even when I was considering what would be served for dinner. Even when I felt as though I had pushed him far away, I did not feel safe to think of Harry. I prayed to Merlin every night he would not appear in my dreams, as they were not safe from the Dark Lord either.
The rest of the class went by without a hitch.  The rest of the day seemed to drag on, Pansy consoling me every so often.  Our last class ended at three, leaving me with four hours to fret and worry.
“Yes you dingbat,”  Pansy laughed. “But you need to tell him. Or at least become friends.  It’s way more than just a silly crush by now.” I shook my head.
“It’s completely okay, Draco,” He insisted.  I nodded, still looking at the water.  Harry’s other hand found my chin and turned my face to his.  “Hey, look at me.”  I raised my eyes to meet his, sparkling in the twilight.  “I don’t want you to ever feel like you have to lie to me to make me happy.  You make me happy regardless.”  He smiled a beautiful, soft smile that lit a fire in my stomach.
They quickly became friends and formed a cover band.  At first, they sucked, as just about every cover band does at first.  But then, something clicked — they found their sound and even began writing their own songs.  Cole wrote lyrics and played the bass, Jasper wrote the music on his guitar, Mason banged around on the drums, and Harry just poured himself into the lyrics. Harry decided to try his hand at writing a couple of times on sleepless nights but found most of his lyrics were too influenced by magic and the war. He did keep a couple of songs he wrote, ones vague enough a wizard would get but wouldn't sound out of place among Muggles.  Not long after that, their band began picking up steam.  They needed a name, and Harry being, well, Harry, wanted to make a reference to the wizarding world.  Mudblood would have fit their vibe, but he couldn't fathom naming a band a slur, especially one now scarring his best friend's arm.  Then he thought about spells—
"He bought me things. He took me out. He made me laugh. People started knowing me by name just for being around him, saying hi, being friendly. I knew he sold drugs, but he told me he had an honour code. He told me that he wanted to get out of the business eventually. You probably think I'm an idiot."
He drew back, sneering, and swept past their audience with his mother close behind. The Aurors did not stop him - one of them laid a hand on Harry's shoulder. Harry shrugged it off, pushing through the crowds, and buried he memory of that hot, tense flare under the crushing weight of his fury.
"In this weather?" complained Draco, but he followed Harry to the back door. A cold breeze swept through the corridor as they opened it; Harry shivered and reached for his wand. Draco stopped him.
Harry couldn't shake the feeling that he was seeing the relationships evolve from a distance, like an alien trying to learn human customs. Or a child at the window of a toy shop, nose pressed against the glass. He'd had such a rigid idea about love, as though it were something abstract and untouchable, like his parents' love. Watching his friends, he was beginning to realise there was something profoundly mundane about it, profoundly tangible, like the touch of Dean's hand on Seamus's shoulder, the cup of tea that was always waiting for Ginny after Quidditch.
"Yeah, alright," he said. "Meet you over there by that lamp post when you're done with the God-botherers."
Then there were the Pamphlets that appeared one particularly memorable Saturday morning. Harry didn't see them straight away, as his first thought was getting to the kitchen for coffee.
, I tell you," said Malfoy in his normal voice, looking glittering and smug as Harry tried to muffle his laughter behind his hands.
"Seems you have it pretty sorted already. House, friends, money, freedom, an extremely attractive man in your bed…"
It did seem like a nice thought, to see the soup run regulars again. For the last few weeks, Harry had been avoiding the van and its influx of Christmas volunteers, working in the church kitchen with a rotating cast of friendly middle-aged women. He knew they'd be serving turkey soup and roast potatoes today, with plenty of salt.
Once out in the fresh air he continued to lead Draco past the few small groups of smokers and down some smaller alleyways till they were alone, Draco chuckling to himself the whole time.
They walked back up to the castle in companionable silence and Harry thought about how much he enjoyed the simple act of holding Draco’s hand, how right and easy it all felt.
When Harry had returned to Hogwarts there had been a certain element of awe that followed him around. He was used to it and it certainly had its advantages when it meant he could sprint through any corridor, the crowds parting for him like the red sea, when he was late for his lessons.
He thought about him constantly, was hyper aware of his presence whenever they were in the same room, he had even cropped up in his dreams.
He flicked his wand and Draco was suddenly completely dry, his hair going incredibly fluffy as he took a step back with the surprise.
‘What are you so happy about.’ Harry said, looking away from him, from a sight that was so tempting, especially from those eyes that promised such sinful things.
Harry had thought at the time it might be a good idea, hitting things for a while usually helped him focus. He wasn’t so sure now.
Narcissa left after breakfast, having rescheduled their luncheon and she kissed them both on the cheeks before stepping into the fireplace and flooing back to her own home.
‘I would’ve died in the room of requirement, I owe you.’ He said with a twirl of the quill in his hand, it wasn’t as fine as the quills he had once seen him use.
Having settled into this routine Harry hadn’t realised as soon as one person wasn’t present he would find himself with a new partner. With the autumn in full swing and the number of cold and flu cases in the castle rising it had only been a matter of time. In this case it was Pansy Parkinson, one of the two Slytherins in their class, that had been ill and failed to show. Her usual partner, one such Draco Malfoy, was suddenly alone.
‘I thought we were calling each other by our actual names.’ Harry said through gritted teeth, avoiding a particularly fierce looking stinging hex.
Now that he was no longer panicking about being attacked by revenge-hungry maniacs he was suddenly very aware that there was a man stood behind him in the shower and he was naked.
‘The Slytherins should host more often.’ Ron said appreciatively as he looked around the room, and Harry and Hermione could only nod in agreement.
‘I might have some little knick-knacks.’ Harry said as he began to rummage in his bag for the map and the cloak.
Draco gasped and his hands came to grip Harry’s hair, pulling at the messy strands as Harry circled his tongue and sucked.
He shot forward with a succession of three jabs that Harry blocked, but the movement unbalanced him and Malfoy managed to grab him and flip him over his hip, throwing Harry onto his back.
Harry Potter had earnt himself his first detention of his final year at Hogwarts in the second week of October when he had discreetly jinxed Zachariah Smith after watching the Hufflepuff student trip Draco Malfoy as he walked by. The fact that he had never much liked Zachariah meant it wasn’t a stretch for him to reach for his wand however it was the lack of reaction from Malfoy that had really forced Harry’s hand. He was used to withering glares and snide comments, some flicker of anger but there was only a resigned, somewhat annoyed look on his face as he bent to pick his books from where he dropped them.
‘I hear you’ve sold the manor.’ He said, dragging up anything he could remember about what Draco had told him, murmuring a thank you as she placed the coffee in front of him.
‘You stuck your neck out for me and my mum at The Trials and you wouldn’t except anything in return.’
‘Cheekbones, hmm?’ He said, his eyebrows raised. ‘Do I take it Potter, that you quite like a bad boy?’ his voice huskier than Harry had heard it before.
Without a word of explanation Draco had begun to untie Harry’s tie with a small smirk, all the while keeping those startling grey eyes, that Harry loved so much, trained on his.
Harry woke before Draco did that next morning and after throwing on his boxers and a shirt he found over the back of a chair in Draco’s room he headed out into the kitchen.
The changing rooms were equipped with showers but they weren’t often used due to the fact that there were no stalls or partitions, if you wanted to shower you had to do it in front of anyone in the changing room.
Harry moaned and his head hit the practise mat with a thump. He focused on the incredible sensation of Malfoy’s mouth on him, sliding a hand down into the silky hair and enjoying the hum of appreciation that reverberated through him.
Harry watched him move to the beat of the music and Draco kept his eyes on Harry the whole time, teasing him, grey eyes alive and challenging him.
Malfoy pulled away and looked at him, and Harry didn’t know how to address the intensity of that look.
But did this mean he was gay too? He’d never even considered it before, he had definitely had crushes on Cho and Ginny but if he was being honest with himself that was probably true of Cedric as well.
‘Non-verbal and wand-less Potter, trying to impress me?’ He asked teasingly even as Harry could tell that he was slightly impressed by the surprise in his eyes.
Clearly Harry wasn’t the only one who appreciated his dance moves as before Harry could finish his drink a man had slipped behind Draco and pulled him against him.
‘Potter, you know I don’t care, but please remember I have a school to run and students to teach. If you could scale down the dramatics just a bit, I would be grateful.’ And with that table she turned and strode away.
Hermione glared at him as she handed over a galleon. She looked sheepishly over at Harry whose jaw had hit the table.
Harry couldn’t stop the snort that came out. There always seemed to be one group of students trailing him around the castle and on occasion he has taken to ducking under the cloak to avoid them.
‘You haven’t forgotten that you have a boyfriend already I hope?’ Harry asked with a growl before he backed him against a wall, attacking his lips with his own for a moment before dropping to his knees in front of him.
But spending every spare moment he could with Draco meant it was becoming more difficult to balance his school work and his commitments and he’d even asked Hermione to help draw him up a timetable, obviously not mentioning what he was doing with several of his evenings and lunchtimes.
Ron and Hermione weren’t the only ones exchanging coins. Across the room money was being exchanged. Harry even thought he saw a silver sickle move between Professor Sprout and Professor McGonagall.
With the help of the Marauders map it had not taken Harry long to find the person he was looking for.
‘Well you could. You shouldn’t because they’re great but technically you could.’ Harry said, wondering if Malfoy was actually trying to encourage banter between them.
Not being at war and no longer having the Dark Lord staying in his house had obviously done wonders for Malfoy. He had filled out again, no longer looking ill and gaunt as Harry had last seen him. His pale hair was brighter and longer, down to his collar bones, and he would often pull it back from his face. On one occasion Harry had even watched at the breakfast table as Pansy had braided it back in a French plait that Harry had thought about for longer than he would’ve admitted to. There was a thick tattoo wrapped around his forearm where his dark mark had once been and there were even several hoops in each of his ears and one through his nose. The whole effect was rather distracting.
‘What are you holding back on me for Potter?’ He asked in a low, velvety voice. ‘What are you so afraid of?’
Later on Harry sat at the bar and continued trying not to stare. Draco had pulled him into the club and immediately pulled him towards the bar, managing to get them drinks very quickly by flirting shamelessly with the bartender and not even having the decency to look guilty when Harry raised his eyebrows at him.
He turned off the shower, grabbed his towel up from one of the benches along with his wand and turned to face Draco again.
The arms around him loosened enough that Harry could turn around and he was met with those lovely grey eyes.
‘That’s three uses.’ Harry said to Draco when he noticed the man watching him from the other side of the counter with raised eyebrows, as Harry began to fry things in the pan and sliced up some bread.
‘I don’t want anything Harry,’ Draco said and there was a smile in his voice. ‘I want you to enjoy something for once without feeling like you have to immediately give back to others.’
The closer he got the quieter the room became and before Harry could really make sense of what was happening the boy was stood in front of him and reaching across the space between them, going towards his neck. There was an almighty scraping of benches, that rung out louder in the silence caused by the scene, as students stood around the room to get a better view of what was happening.
‘Been thinking about me much Potter?’ Draco asked with a smirk and Harry’s mouth dropped open. The room was loud enough with the sounds of other partners duelling that Harry was not worried about people listening in but the question shocked him and sent his brain spiralling away from the fight.
Harry had assumed that Draco’s departing comment had been that Harry needed to decide whether or not he was straight and then actually talk to Draco but with every day that had gone by he had begun to question whether or not that was actually just Draco’s kinder way of saying that he wasn’t interested. But then how could he have kissed Harry like that?
Draco took his chance and began the duel with a quick jinx, taking the offense immediately and Harry gasped and focused on shielding and blocking himself from the worse of the attacks. He had started out on a back foot which was unusual for him and he had to concentrate on defending himself whilst looking for an opening to change the direction of the fight.
The comment could’ve been self-pitying but Malfoy spoke so rationally and calmly it didn’t seem that he was trying to get sympathy, he just seemed to be stating a fact.
‘That was much dirtier than I could ever have hoped for.’ Malfoy finally said, still breathing a little heavily.
‘Yes, well she definitely proved that didn’t she, she and Luna make a good couple, I’m glad Luna’s happy.’ The comment could’ve been considered sarcastic but the softness with which he talked about Luna was all the convincing Harry needed of his genuine happiness for her.
As Draco was finishing knotting his tie Harry noticed that the collar of his shirt was open just enough to see a purpling bruise on his neck that Harry was pretty sure he was responsible for. He wouldn’t have put it past Draco to decide to come out now and come up with this whole performance just because he couldn’t be bothered to explain away a hickey.
Harry was not exactly a stranger to this, things has happened between Ginny and himself but there has never been the current between them that existed between himself and Draco, and he desperately didn’t want to screw this up.
Harry let his eyes go out of focus as he stood in the spray from the shower, enjoying the feeling of the hot water loosening the muscles that had gone tight from the effort of the quidditch training.
His head turned to the side, opening his eyes looking blindly for a moment before his vision focused on the door just meters away from them.
‘Suit yourself.’ Draco said with a pout before sauntering onto the dance floor leaving Harry to try not to stare at his arse.
He never spoke to or approached Harry but he couldn’t get over the feeling that Draco might be watching him at different points over the course of the night.
Harry dropped low and swung out a foot, but his opponent jumped and danced away a few steps, all the while keeping those grey eyes on him. He was so light on his feet, he seemed to be dancing more than fighting.
‘Faster.’ He panted and Harry set a faster more punishing pace, moving between Draco’s legs as they came up to wrap around his hips.
The whole thing felt so much like 6th year Harry felt he was living in a near constant state of déjà vu. It wasn’t suspicion though that made him want to be close to Draco though. He didn’t really know what it was.
‘Shit I didn’t even think of that, I just wanted to surprise you.’ Draco said and Harry could hear the wince in his voice.
Even when his hatred of Malfoy had turned into grudging respect and then into lust he had been protected by years of animosity and the knowledge that his desires certainly weren’t reciprocated. What was supposed to protect him now, the cat was out of the bag.
He looked around and his eyes widened as he saw Draco Malfoy strolling up the Gryffindor bench towards him, seemingly without a care in the world.
Unlike the other houses they had gone all out. Usually houses would supply a table of drinks and snacks, music for dancing and occasionally have some cards or some Knick knacks for some game or other they wanted to play. The Slytherins however had made everything Halloween themed, from the orange, black, purple and green streamers everywhere to the carved jack-o-lanterns bobbing around the room providing flickering candlelight. As Harry stepped towards the table laden with food and drink, grabbing butterbeers for himself and his friends he noticed the apple bobbing that Lavender and Pavarti were doing and Seamus and Dean at a pumpkin carving station, the latter laughing uproariously as the former carved a very large dick into his pumpkin.
In one particular match however, one of the burlier recruits, Jackson, had managed to get Malfoy into a headlock, and as he had writhed around Malfoy’s shirt had risen up a bit, it wasn’t until Malfoy had had to tap out of the fight that Harry realised how much his breathing had sped up at the sight of Malfoys lithe body.
Harry stared incredulously at Draco who didn’t look at him but must have understood Harry’s silence because his lips twitched.
He had to stay behind to put the equipment away and by the time he went into the changing room most of the team members were on their way out, eager to get back to Gryffindor common room with the warm fire and hot cocoa waiting.
He had been waiting on the corner to the club, watching the line of people waiting to get in when he heard a sigh behind him.
‘Now’s not the time to be smug.’ Draco muttered as Harry rose to his feet again, kissing his way along Draco’s neck till he got to his mouth.
Malfoy slammed his hand into the mat, tapping out of a fight that he couldn’t win, and Harry almost moaned in relief as he let Malfoy go, allowing him to roll away and pant into the mat.
Finally being able to get back into Quidditch and on a broom again had been like realising he’d been missing a limb for months and then finally getting it back. Returning as the captain and still with his sixth-year team intact had given the Gryffindor team an advantage over the others that Harry had been exploiting. With the help of regular practise and genuine enthusiasm Harry was enthusiastic about the team’s chances.
The grey eyes were empty and it actually frightened Harry, seeing them going from being so alive in the middle of their duelling to so dull, upsetting in a way that Harry couldn’t explain.
‘Oh well you know… the hair and…the tattoo and the… cheekbones.’ He gestured vaguely at Malfoy who had a small smirk playing across his lips. ‘Also, the whole bad boy thing.’ He finished lamely looking anywhere but at him.
‘No, no, of course not, but there was always a connection between you two, I saw it at the trial, a mother knows.’ She replied
‘Mmm hmm, they were all talking about it in the corridor, Harry Potter yet again standing up for Draco Malfoy, always bound to cause a buzz.’ He said quietly.
‘I’m not getting fired from the ministry for walking around topless just because you enjoy it.’ Harry said with a chuckle as he pulled his t-shirt over his head.
‘I don’t think so.’ He said in a sing song voice, before rolling onto his front and springing to his feet with incredible grace.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and dragged him to a room off the open-plan space they were in and Harry hummed in appreciation at the big bed he saw before he pushed Draco back onto it.
He focused on keeping his breathing normal even as his heart raced uncontrollably, listening for even the quietest noise over the gentle patter of the water on the bathroom floor.
To Harry’s amazement Ron was grinning delightedly as Draco pulled a rack of toast his way and began to butter slices.
Draco didn’t say anything but he stayed very still and continued to watch Harry with those bright grey eyes.
Harry learnt forward slowly to give Draco a chance to stop, watching him carefully before closing his eyes and gently pressed his lips against Draco’s. It was short, chaste even but sweet and Harry pulled back and opened his eyes.
At least 13 different girls had come up to speak to him about going on dates by the end of his meal.
He flicked on the wireless that Cootes had brought down to listen to at the beginning of the year, claiming that it helped calm his nerves, and pulled off his dirty robes and stepped into the already steaming shower.
‘Don’t worry, I’ll hex anyone who messes with you.’ He said as he took Draco’s hand again and began to lead him up to the castle again.
Draco’s head fell back against the wall with a solid thump as he pulled on Harry’s hair again, Harry decided he quite liked the feel of Draco’s hands in his hair.
Overall it meant Harry had become fairly immune to the whispers that always seemed to follow him, getting used to tuning them out, and he understood it even if he resented it.
They were both sweating and panting at the end and the room was quiet for a moment. Harry couldn’t help the small self-satisfied smile that tugged at his lips.
‘You are such a git.’ Draco said and then gasped when Harry ground his hips against Draco’s, letting him know he knew exactly what Draco wanted.
‘If you want to perfect your duelling you need to work on fighting that ability for your opponent to distract you.’
He looked around the room and saw eyes following his, whispered conversations behind hands, blatant pointing and staring. Unfortunately for him, the chosen one, the saviour of the wizarding world, this wasn’t exactly uncommon and so it was still difficult to judge whether or not anything was the matter.
The realisation that he wanted a relationship with Draco had struck him hard and fast but not nearly as badly as the sudden realisation that Draco may not want a relationship from him in return. Harry hadn’t realised how much he felt for Draco, and all from the simple act of walking quietly, hand in hand.
‘I’m very sorry mother but I completely forgot about lunch today, as you can probably tell I’m entertaining guests.’
He had been surprised when Malfoy had caught him in the office, he hadn’t technically asked Harry to train, he’d asked if Harry wanted to ‘work off some frustration’ and when Harry’s eyes widened slightly he had gestured to the unsolved case Harry had been puzzling over for days now.
He was twitchy and distracted to the point that even Hermione and Ron, occupied with each other as they so often were nowadays, noticed.
‘Are we going to tell people about this?’ Harry asked suddenly, stopping on the front lawn not that far from the doors of the Castle.
‘You like that?’ Harry asked between pants and Draco could only moan. ‘You close?’ He asked and Draco moaned louder.
Suddenly, before Harry could think, they were moving and their lips collided. Draco’s hands were in Harry’s hair pulling at the messy strands and his own were on Draco’s waist pulling him closer, holding on tight enough to bruise. Draco’s lips on his made his whole body burn with desire and Harry groaned loudly as his tongue danced with Draco’s, lips moving hard against each other’s. His hands slipped under Draco’s shirt and Draco climbed into Harry’s lap in response allowing Harry to wrap his arms all the way around Draco’s waist, arching his spine off the sofa with a gasp when Draco tugged on Harry’s hair. Harry nipped at his lip in retaliation and enjoyed the feeling of Draco shuddering from his ministrations.
‘Well I do feel slightly awkward here.’ Harry murmured as he looked down, Draco was fully clothed, although sopping wet, and Harry was entirely naked.
‘If I knew all it took to get you on your knees was a little flirting with other men, I would’ve done it ages ago.’ Draco said still laughing as Harry worked his belt buckle open.
‘So you do want this.’ Harry said, his feeling of anxiety both relaxing at the answer and tightening at the idea of the backlash Draco would be on the receiving end of.
As he sat down at a desk Malfoy himself had walked in and sat down a few seats ahead. He found himself staring perplexed at the back of a blonde head trying to work out what Malfoy had done to end up here.
Harry had seethed as he walked away but he had not missed the curious grey eyes that watched him as he passed.
He had caught glimpses of him around the room, talking to different students, dancing with Pansy and even drinking with Luna and Ginny who weren’t actually 8th years but were always invited to the parties as honorary members.
It had been somewhat satisfying to see Ron and Hermione hate the attention he had always retrieved and he had tried not to take too much pleasure in telling them to ‘just ignore it’ as they had always told him.
‘Are you kidding me Malfoy, have you seen your arse?’ He responded, and was rewarded with a huff of laughter against his abdomen and then a bite.
‘What makes you say that,’ Malfoy asked slowly as he turned to look at Harry again. His entire attention had shifted to Harry.
Harry walked slowly into the astronomy tower and slid down the wall till he was sitting next to him.
‘And this?’ Draco asked as the other hand trailed lower, inching over the ridges of his muscle past his belly button.
‘Your best friend just admitted something that must have been affecting him for a long time and that’s how you respond!’ She cried, ‘How long have you known?’ She asked as she turned to Harry again.
‘Mm, my big strong Gryffindor huh? You got any idea how I’m going to get back to my dorm without being caught by a very angry Filch?’ He said.
Some days the whispers and the gossiping were worse than others, although it often had some kind of discernible cause, like the day he and Ginny had broken up. She had expected him to be mad at her, but the complete lack of sadness or anger he felt had worried him more than her sexuality. It made sense now of course, he thought maybe his love of Ginny as a friend and his desire to be a part of the Weasley family had blinded him to the fact that it had never been true romantic love between the two of them.
‘Yeah well, I’m just focusing on getting through the school year, I’ll avoid giving anyone any extra incentives to kill me. Terrorising the ‘golden trio’ definitely wouldn’t help me on that mission.’ He said grinning when Harry all but hissed at the nickname he and his friends had been given.
It felt like they were duelling for hours, every time Harry was beginning to get the upper hand to a point where he could finish the fight Draco would say something, quietly enough, to distract him and quickly take the offense. As time wore on though Harry could tell that Harry was getting the offense back quicker and Draco was having to defend himself harder. He was waiting for Draco’s distracting comment when he suddenly realised that it wasn’t going to come, the class had grown quieter without the sound of duelling students and Harry realised people around the room where watching them, the last fighters standing, talking to their partners, Harry was pretty sure Dean and Seamus were betting on them.
‘I don’t think I ever did, just repeated the things I heard my dad say, the things I thought would make people think I was cool and important. Backfired a bit.’ He said sighing, turning to look at Harry.
Before Malfoy could reply, McGonagall had walked back into the room and stopped dead at the scene as both Harry and Malfoy’s heads snapped in her direction.
‘Oh hold up, I’ll walk with you.’ Hermione said, kissing Ron before grabbing her bag and walking down the table to meet Blaise and Pansy who were already heading out.
Harry couldn’t think of a single reason not to do what every single cell of his body was screaming at him to do.
‘I am focused,’ was Draco Malfoy’s quick response, ‘You’re the one who seems to be lacking clarity tonight Potter.’
They walked on in silence for a bit before they got to the entrance hall and began to split towards their own respective common rooms.
He sped up as he heard Malfoy’s breathing increase and soon they were both panting and gasping, pressing kisses into whatever skin they could reach.
‘Looks like you won’t be needing me today Potter,’ Palmore said as the room divided into pairs as usual and Draco reported Pansy’s sickness, ‘Pair up with Mr Malfoy’
‘Huh, this looks like it might not actually be that messy.’ Harry said as he watched Hermione and Pansy chatting as they waited at the doors of the Great Hall.
He stared up at the blurry red canopy above his head, shocked at this new way of thinking about himself.
If he thought about it, it made sense, he just hadn’t thought Draco had come out with a game plan. Then again as Palmore had said, he was incredibly smart. But that wasn’t what he first thought about
‘I don’t like it necessarily, but I understand it.’ He amended. ‘Well, I don’t know the whole thing is very confusing to me.’ He said scrubbing at his face with his hands.
‘No, I’ve taken a residence in London, it allows me to be closer to my son, perfect for when he remembers he’s supposed to be going for lunch with me.’ She said, giving the reason for her visit without making him feel rude for asking.
He was about to turn so that his back wasn’t to the door when he heard it. A rustle, something moving, there was someone in this changing room with him.
‘I don’t like people being jinxed when there back is turned’ She had said to Harry, pulling him out of the flow of students after sending Smith smartly to the hospital wing
‘I thought you liked a bad boy Potter.’ He said, a lightness coming back into his tone, as a small smirk twitched at his lips.
‘What right now? I think its past curfew so we might be looking at more detention Potter.’ Draco said teasingly.
Harry had gone over and over everything that had happened in the detention over and over in his head.
Harry sat up onto his knees and pulled Malfoy into another kiss, before shifting into his lap, spitting roughly into his palm before wrapping it round both their pricks.
Harry was instantly furious and he grabbed Draco’s chin, making him look at him. His eyes flew wide and Harry could’ve laughed at the look of shock on Draco’s face if he hadn’t been so mad.
‘Are you going to do something about it then.’ Draco retorted easily, the challenging look back in his eye.
They had never really spoken about taking their relationship any further, Harry had thought about it but he had never wanted to say anything, had never wanted to put any pressure on Draco.
He didn’t answer, forcing Harry to look back at him. Malfoy only tilted his head with that wicked smile.
He was aware of Palmore watching them duelling carefully and flushed, he had always done well in their duels and he didn’t want her to think he struggling all of a sudden.
‘Every time you take your shirt off in training, I have to concentrate on not drooling.’ Malfoy said as his fingers delicately traced across Harry’s chest, lingering on his nipples and on the planes of his muscles. Fingers were quickly replaced by his tongue, steadily moving down his body.
‘And yet you still managed to make better decisions than I did, with everything over your head.’ Draco said twisting a silver ring round his index finger. Harry thought it might have had a crest on it.
Harry froze, his mind going blank. Why the fuck didn’t he bring his wand. There were still death eaters at large, could one of them have snuck back into Hogwarts for revenge? Lucked out on finding him here, quite literally with his trousers down?
‘Duelling skills like that would’ve been useful on Harry’s side of the Battle back in May.’ Said a snide voice.
Malfoy stood up from his chair stalking towards where Harry was sitting, that small smirk still on his face.
Malfoy gasped, the hands pinning him down loosened enough around his wrists for Harry to grab his shoulders and spin him onto his back until Harry was underneath him, an arm wrapped around his throat.
‘I was right here,’ Harry said softly, pressing a kiss to his lips, ‘and I’m not going anywhere.’ He said firmly, looking at Draco till he met his eyes.
‘Of course, Professor.’ He said politely before walking away a few steps and taking a duelling stance, withdrawing his wand from his robe sleeve as he did so.
The room burst into noise and Harry swung his legs back round on the bench to face his friends, still completely shocked.
They had always been very careful about not being visible in public together before and after the Christmas break, originally it had been at Draco’s specific request as he wasn’t ready to be outed which Harry had been all too happy to comply with until he was happy to be open about it. He wouldn’t deny he wanted to delay the drama that would inevitably follow them being seen together. And after that breakfast in Draco’s kitchen they had agreed that they would let everyone know but Harry had still been in no rush, happy to wait till Draco decided. And here he was walking up the Gryffindor bench, warily eyed by its occupants as he came, in front of the whole school.
They chatted happily over breakfast and Harry got the sense that despite his glares every time Harry and Narcissa ganged up on him to tease him about something or other Draco was actually very happy.
‘But I knew my best mate, knew he’d been after you Malfoy since sixth year.’ Ron declared, proudly polishing his gold coin with his robe sleeve.
Harry watched as Draco got ever closer to where he was seated, seemingly completely unfazed by the effect he was having on the room. Everyone was watching, every eye was trained on Malfoy’s progression up the table, probably expecting a fight. Hands were twitching towards their wands, in pockets, up sleeves, on tables, all around the room. Harry could practically feel the stares of the Professors up on the teachers table boring into the back of his head, ready to step in at any moment.
He wasn’t wrong though, Harry and Malfoy were arguably the two most skilled fighters in the Auror recruits, both physically and magically. Harry had been surprised how quickly Malfoy had taken to it, believing that Malfoy would think muggle fighting was beneath him. But Harry had watched him in training, there was a grace to the way he moved, he was quick into the ring and quick out of it, usually leaving another recruit panting on the floor. Occasionally he’d make a mistake but usually he managed to wriggle out of most tight situations.
‘Yes, to a muggle family ironically, it took an entire ministry department to come in and remove all the magic surrounding the house to make it safe. It seemed odd to stay in that entire house just for me.’
There was most definitely something wrong with his friends, something they weren’t telling him, something they felt embarrassed about to mention. Frankly Harry was too tired to bite and ask them what they were so stressed about, preferring to let them sit and stew about whatever it was causing them so much angst. If they wanted to tell him they would.
However, the air of untouchability that surrounded Harry certainly had its disadvantages too. One such example had come to light when in his new defence against the dark arts class, with its 13 students, he suddenly came up short without a partner. The class consisted of 2 Slytherins, 5 Gryffindors, 2 Hufflepuffs and 4 Ravenclaws and naturally, despite McGonagall’s best efforts towards interhouse unity the students paired up within their houses. Ron and Hermione had automatically looked to each other when their new teacher had called on them to form pairs but then immediately offered to work in a three, switching in and out with Harry.
Harry wasn’t sure where they landed except that it was in a small but nicely decorated flat. He guessed it was Draco’s but focused on the task at hand rather than his surroundings.
‘Course you can, you idiot.’ Ron said eyes closing again, but he opened them when Hermione flicked his forehead.
‘Knowing what gets under Harry Potter’s skin is precious information, and I intend to abuse it.’ he said playfully.
The classes they shared were never an opportunity to talk, either sat too far away or not getting paired up.
As Draco jerked him off with one hand, he felt the other gently moving over his chest, scratching him ever so slightly, playing with his nipples.
If Harry could hadn’t watched him frown to himself as he sat there, he would not have believed he was awake.
He kissed his way up Draco’s taught stomach as he undid the buttons on his sheer shirt, standing between Draco’s knees as he did and slipped it off his shoulders as Draco sat up to kiss him, fully naked under his exploring hands.
," she said eventually, dropping a plate back into the sink with a splash. "I'll see what I can do."
"Oh, hey, that's not cool," he said. "I might ask Hester in Probation Administration and Rehabilitation of Prisoners if she can do something, I think she likes me."
"Oh, right," said the guy, laughing. "You really are all over the place. Let me have a look." He turned to the cabinets, and Harry glanced at Malfoy, who was scowling at the man's back. He caught Harry looking, and turned away towards one of the record boxes. Harry stuck his nose in another box, judging each album mostly on covers. He lingered on an image of several naked bodies pressed together in a line, wondering if it were a good enough reason to buy an album in itself.
"Why won't you just drop it, Potter? I'm not up to anything, and even if I was, it's none of your fucking business!"
Harry could feel the pulse of his heartbeat in his ears as he slipped downstairs to the front door. He took a deep breath, resisted the urge to check himself in the mirror, and swung the door wide.
"So I went back," said Malfoy, and a curl of sick suspicion flicked at Harry's stomach, as he remembered where this story had started.
"That's my room," said Harry, pointing to the door that led to his room at the front of the house. "And Dean and Seamus have those two rooms. That's our floor's bathroom, and yours too, since there's not one on the floor above."
"Er," said Ron. "Yeah, just an, um, tasteful publicity shot. She's got all that blonde hair you see, and she's pulling a bit of a lady Godiva with it on her Firebolt…"
Malfoy looked at him then, eyes wide and confused. He looked younger all of a sudden, a scared boy huddled on a bathroom floor.
"In that case," he said, and it came out lower and rougher than he'd intended. "I'm very flattered to be hated by you."
Harry was still a bit mystified as to why Neville, particularly, was so much more hostile to Malfoy. Malfoy had been utterly horrible to him in school, of course, and Neville had every right not to trust him — if anything he'd expected
"Good point, Harry, good point," said Dean, snorting and patting him slightly awkwardly on the back. He didn't make a move to push Harry away, and so Harry didn't move, safe in the warm dark behind his eyelids.
"Honestly," she said, "I swear all the nice men have the self-esteem of Bubotubers and the shit men think they are gods. You're both lovely, kind, beautiful people and I love you both very much, okay?"
, she'd taken shift work, something Muggle that made her smell of incense and street food. They were in the drawing room, and she was silently embroidering a moon and stars onto one of the arms of the sofa.
"Dunc's my brother-in-law," she said, making a nod to the other tattoo artist behind her. "I asked him to teach me to tattoo, and I got hooked."
She pulled his arm a little closer to stare at it through the clingfilm, and Harry reflected that he was glad she was the first to see it. She'd do what she always did, and accept his mad decisions without questions or judgement. "Do you want a cup of tea? We have a hundred varieties, you know."
Only he ended up coming into contact with Malfoy's mouth, and his own mouth was already open and it seemed the only way to win, to thrust his tongue through Draco's parted lips. Draco froze, but Harry won only a second's shock before Malfoy released Harry's wrists to hold Harry's head tight and begin his own assault with lips and tongue and teeth. Harry was hotly aware of the rapid beating of his heart; he groaned and caught Malfoy's lip between his teeth, biting almost too hard before Malfoy's tongue thrust its way into Harry's mouth with fierce determination.
He walked along the corridor in a daze, only remembering that he still hadn't got rid of the magical deodorant when he reached the entrance hall. The hall was busy with people crossing to get to their next lessons, and Harry froze in horror as the closest girl sniffed, breathed deeply and turned blindly. Sensing prey.
"No way," said Harry, about half a second before Malfoy took a leap. Malfoy pinned him to the wall, and Harry wasn't quick enough to get his wand, and maybe Malfoy just wanted to fight...
"I had to look it up too," said Ginny, shrugging. "Well, Hermione gave me a book. Absolute bunch of nutters. They think Hitler was right, they think that people who don't look like them are weaker, or stupid, or a threat to modern Muggle society."
"Can you play Clair de Lune?" said Luna, before anyone could say anything to him about the lesson. Malfoy shrugged.
When everyone had pushed themselves back from the kitchen table, full and holding their stomachs, Harry cleared his throat.
things. Ginny set up an appointment with a Mind Healer after the trauma pamphlets; Luna was now attending an embroidery club after a stack of leaflets clearly targeted at getting Harry to leave the house.
In the end, however, it wasn't so bad. On the day of the party Ginny decided to take the lead, and sent him and Ron to make sandwiches and vol-au-vents in the kitchen with Kreacher. Kreacher was almost beside himself with excitement at the idea of hosting, so much so that he barely complained at all about their assistance with the cooking, and Ron kept Harry distracted with idle speculations about who might be shagging who in the Aurors. Harry was
"Well," he said, smiling uncomfortably. "Who am I to judge? I don't think I'm reading from the same manual as anyone else, either."
But Malfoy was like a glittering thing, dancing in the corner of Harry's eye. At the end of his second drink, Harry summoned up the energy to say hello to everyone: making awkward conversation with Parvati Patil at the buffet table, kissing Blaise on the cheek like it was something they did, hugging Hannah Abbot. Malfoy was perched on the arm of the sofa talking to Ernie, waving a vol-au-vent and looking exaggeratedly at ease, all long slim lines and a loose smirk. He made it look easy, like he wasn't scared to be here at all, but Harry could see that it was an affectation; every now and then, when Ernie looked at his plate of food, Malfoy's mouth would turn down, his eyes flicking about the room as if anticipating an attack.
to be," said Luna, who didn't look surprised either. Harry was vaguely offended — he wasn't sure why everyone had leapt to Malfoy quite so quickly. It could have been any old down-and-out ex-Death-Eater…
"Sent what?" said Harry sleepily, and sat up. Dean and Ritchie were already dressed, looking curiously at the package; the other three boys were already gone.
"Urgh," Malfoy sighed. "Fine, but if you think I'm going to be persuaded downstairs for whatever torments await me at that table —"
Harry sighed and pulled out his wallet. He'd have to make more than one owl order for Muggle money this month.
The next hour flew by in a blur of fascinating and completely awkward conversation. Most people picked something out of the box in silence and then shuffled away. A few tried to take armfuls, but Harry used his DA voice to ask, gently, if they really needed all that. Several people talked to themselves in the queue, and one particularly memorable man shouted bizarre obscenities at anyone who got close to him. One woman flirted with him outrageously, until someone else mercifully dragged her away.
"You'd think," said Ron, grinning, "But I went to the canteen. It's just I have fifteen minutes until Poisons and Antidotes and there's a slice of mum's coffee cake in there. Accio lunchbox!"
"Excuse me," he said, painfully posh, "I don't suppose you know the closest place to get tea and cake?"
He glanced up at the cafe sign as he approached, considering, rummaging in his pockets for change. He had a pound coin, so he entered the little shop and ordered two coffees; he was handed something watery-looking in a polystyrene cup by a woman with a none-too-friendly expression. He loaded them both with sugar to disguise the taste, and walked back out towards the alley.
"Tea?" said Andromeda, gesturing Harry to the sofa. "Here, have Teddy for a moment. He's still a little dozy from his afternoon nap."
"Right.” Malfoy nodded. "Of course. I'll just be going. Thank you for — well, for not murdering me and burying me in the garden and telling Potter I ran away, but also the chat."
"I bet he did," said Harry dryly. It sort of hurt to think about Snape; a tangled mess of pain and resentment and pity and the knowledge that they were not
would have a day that was honest and good. He caught Malfoy's eye and something flickered in Malfoy's face, fearful and uncertain, his smile turning down at one corner. Harry stared at him, uncomfortably aware of his body, the way he could feel his heartbeat pulsing in his fresh tattoo.
"He's not our problem," echoed Dean. "And it's too much. Even if I forgave his stupid rat face I wouldn't suddenly be fine with sharing a bathroom with him."
"Don't touch the curtain," Harry warned. "She's silenced, but I still haven't figured out how to take her off the wall yet."
and I'm holding you personally responsible. You made it look easy, you are a truly terrifying person."
. No, Ron, don't say that. It'll be fine," said Hermione weakly, and Harry stomped off and out the door, annoyed. What
Harry half-expected the bookshelves to rattle, so strong was the knot of rage and grief in his chest, but they didn't, and so Harry forced himself to sit in it. To let himself feel it fully, for the first time in a long time.
"How rugged," said Pansy, with another evil little smirk at him. "Perhaps I see why you like him now, Ginevra."
"Great. Sounds like a good plan. Will these places stop helping you if you have somewhere to stay for a bit?"
"Shall we Apparate?" he said, voice gentle, and Malfoy stared at Harry's grip on his arm and nodded. Harry closed his eyes and concentrated on the body beside him, on that strange sensation of drawing up a slow, deliberate power that engulfed them, compressed them and transported them across the town in the space of a second.
Malfoy watched him, apparently speechless for a moment, then sighed and scooped the money back towards himself.
"Well," said Hermione, voice soft. "As I said, I can't make you go, but if you're hoping for an ally in this household, you'd better make me believe you are taking this opportunity seriously."
"Actually," said Malfoy, tapping his book against his chin, "Someone's been offering to buy me one pretty much constantly."
The conversation broke as the wine was poured. Harry took his glass gratefully, pulling himself up from his position curled on the sofa.
Harry was going to come in seconds. He was sure of it. He clenched the sheets, a groan forming deep in the back of his throat.
It was strange to exit the shop, like leaving a dream world. Harry was assaulted by the smell of the street food and the sounds of the crowd, the glare of the afternoon sun. He wanted to move closer to Malfoy — absurdly, as though Malfoy represented some kind of safety.
Then Malfoy covered Harry's mouth with his, and Malfoy was definitely affected, and Harry was a bit too shocked to fight back. And Malfoy's tongue was tracing the inside of his mouth and his hips pinned Harry's to the wall and really this was... horrible, but he couldn't get to his wand and it was difficult to think with Malfoy moaning faintly into his mouth and he didn't know how to make it stop...
Harry grinned. It had taken some time to get used to Andromeda's dry sense of humour. Harry couldn't bear the idea of anyone being sarcastic about Teddy, like the Dursleys had been about him, but Harry had learned by now that her words and behaviour to Teddy himself were nothing but doting.
It was hard to imagine Malfoy Manor as a home to anyone, but he supposed Draco had been happy there. Flying in the grounds, bumping into helicopters, losing himself in expensive toys, playing with friends.
"Oh, really," drawled Malfoy, smiling the depraved smile of a filthy corruptor as he leant casually against the bookcases. "Is that why you're flushed?"
"Well, I suppose we will have to have a whole school announcement," she said. "Tell everyone of your predicament, get them to block up their noses."
The next day, the kitchen sink had a sullen air about it, the drain leaking water all over the cleaning supplies, the tap refusing to run for the washing up. Harry didn't really know how you apologised to a house for being sick on it, but so far manual labour seemed to have worked, and so on Monday afternoon Harry dragged the rusty toolbox down to the kitchen and began to prod optimistically at the pipework. Ron, aware that he was responsible for the sink's sulky behaviour but having very little to contribute in the way of practical knowledge, sat at the kitchen table accepting snacks from Kreacher and occasionally making unhelpful observations about Harry's plumbing skills.
Seamus very much wanted to, but in the end Dean persuaded him he had the steadier charmwork. Harry watched them squabble it out, watched the sharp flash of a Severing Charm slicing at Ginny's childhood locks, and laughed along when Ginny saw the result in a conjured mirror and burst into bright, happy giggles.
"No," said Harry, for the tenth time, although he thought he might burst out with it any moment, and he dearly needed to talk to someone.
"They're at work, mostly," said Harry. "Gin's probably at the Quidditch pitch, I don't know. Dean works shifts at Flourish and Blotts. Luna works in a Muggle shop selling crystals or something, when she's not writing for the
"You're not going to get away with it, whatever it is. You're going to fail, and your new master is going to punish you, and you're going to realise what an idiot you've been."
Harry was unable to quite believe he was here. Doing this. Draco's face softened under the intensity of Harry's scrutiny, eyes fluttering closed, and Harry moved his hand, gentle and sure.
Harry lurked in the kitchen with Seamus, fighting over the pizza and arguing over whether spelling the kettle to explode in glitter was hilarious or deadly, with both of them switching sides half-way through. After what felt like hours, Kreacher appeared, looking cheerful to have had Slytherins to serve, and told him that Zabini was on her way out.
"Ta-da!" said Ginny, dropping Hermione's privacy screen to reveal Hermione's new dress — a strappy, low-cut, figure-hugging column of gold glitter. Harry loved her like a sister, but even he could admit she looked good.
"Besides," said Ron, smiling softly at Hermione as she tucked her own hair behind one ear and brandished her wand at a page, "He's making an obvious effort right now. With 'Mione. He's been making an effort for hours. That counts for something."
"Sounds good," said Ginny, disregarding the kitchen chairs in favour of sitting on his favourite spot on the counter. She watched him make the tea in silence, unusually patient, and when he sat down at the table she hopped down to sit next to him, on his level.
"I was," Draco mumbled after taking a sip of his drink. Harry furrowed his brow. "I was an ass to you and your friends. To pretty much everyone, let's be honest." Draco stared down at the bar, swirling his drink. Harry cocked his head to the side, observing Draco.
“Come on, let's get back to the Common Room.  I’m exhausted,”  I said, a sudden wave of exhaustion washing over me.  Pansy nodded, winked and stormed away, fake tears welling in her eyes.  I waited for a second, until she was far enough ahead before I started walking back, shoulders hunched, gaze down.
“Yes sir.  Dumbledore has proven to be an effective negotiator in the half-giant’s rights.  However, the Defense Against the Dark Arts position has been filled by a reliably ignorant source.”  Voldemort turned swiftly and moved towards the door.
“Draco, love,” She patted the spot next to her on the sofa. “Tell me about your trip home. How was it?”
news to announce.” His voice sounded strained. “And as Dumbledore announced unceremoniously at your Leaving Feast, the Dark Lord has returned.” I straightened my back and inhaled sharply. “Despite claiming to be under the Imperius Curse during the first war, I remained a faithful follower of the Dark Lord since his rising. I was proud to return to his side at his return during the final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Not only have I returned to his side, our family,” My mother gently clasped my hand. “Will be hosting the Dark Lord for the foreseeable future.” A wave of nausea washed over me and my knees buckled. I did my best to maintain my composure as my father watched me. Slowly the door behind him creaked open.
“I didn’t think it’d get this far,”  I replied.  Really, I thought I would’ve cast obliviate and gone back to Pansy with a broken heart at this point.
“That’s a big ‘if’ Pansy.  I can’t just expose myself like this.  Even if I obliviate him, then I still have to live with the crushing truth he doesn’t like me back.”  I watched Pansy walking back and forth, slowly getting a headache.  I need to sleep.
“Not my fault you leave me high and dry most nights,” Harry retorted with a slight blush.  “Besides, it’s better than dry or lotion.”  He poured some on his first finger and circled Draco’s tight hole.  “It might sting a bit,” Harry murmured, gently pushing his finger in.  Draco hissed at the new pressure but Harry rubbed a reassuring hand on his thigh.  When Draco relaxed, Harry began slowly moving his finger in and out.  Draco slowly breathed, getting used to the new feeling.
"Come on, Malfoy!  I don't feel like cooking and you don't know how to!"  Harry leaned against the counter, jacket in hand.
“Behave,” I muttered.  Pansy helps me for a few minutes hanging my clothes before we flop onto my bed and draw the curtains.
I woke up the next morning much more rested than the day before about an hour and a half early.  I contemplated staying in bed and daydreaming about Pot—
“Yeah.”  We stayed like that in silence for a few minutes before Harry pulled away and started straightening his robes.
Meanwhile, Harry scanned the crowd.  He always did, just in case that white-blonde hair was lit up under the coloured lights.  He allowed himself that one small fantasy — the boy the song was about showing up in the crowd one night, magically falling in love with him.  He knew it was ridiculous. Guilty pleasures.
“But then you could move on!”  She stopped in front of me again and grabbed my hands.  “Hun, you’ve been in love with this boy for at least a year, definitely attracted to him for more.  If you tell him, you have an answer either way.  And if he likes you back, then great!  You figure out how to move on!  Look,”  She made the most serious face she could.  “Just do it.  It’ll work out either way.”  I snatched my hands away and turned to look out of the alcove.  She had a point.  I should listen to her.
“Potter, what is this supposed to be?”  I looked over my shoulder to see Snape towering over Harry, sneering at his potion.  My stomach dropped for a moment, silently thanking Merlin that Snape wasn’t commenting on the note.  I glanced to the cauldron, now spewing dark grey steam.
Harry stepped out onto the stage, clad in ripped jeans, an All Time Low t-shirt, his now grown out hair left undone in the messy curls it was known for in his school years, and the pansexual flag tied like a cape around his neck.  The stage smelled like beer and cheap vodka, and the coloured lights were hot against his face.   He always loved this moment — the initial adrenaline rush of stepping on stage, the crowd cheering, even if they didn't know who he was, the way the light blinded him, leaving him alone on the stage with his bandmates.
“Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?” I asked.  His smirk turned tight and his eyes fiery.
.  “But not everyone does, and it’s better to be on their good side when this whole thing comes to a head!  Arguing with Umbridge brings you nothing!”
“To our newcomers,” said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips.  “Welcome!  To our old hands — welcome back! There is a time for speech-making, but this is not it. Tuck in!”  A round of applause and a few whoops of laughter rang out as food appeared on the tables.  As the meal began, I stole a glance at the Gryffindor table.  Harry was beaming, tucking into a heap of food on his plate, looking as though it was the first time he had eaten in months — probably not too far from the truth.  Pansy started talking about her summer, a trip to France and Italy with her mum.  I nodded along, wishing I could tell her some interesting story from my summer.  Of course, I couldn’t tell her how joyous it was to have supper with the Dark Lord every evening, even if I wanted to.  Instead, I smiled, exclaiming at the important bits, and she hardly seemed to notice over her food.
“Is this okay?” Harry breathed into Draco’s neck, completely frozen, sucking in the sweet floral scent of Draco’s shampoo.  Draco nodded after a moment, his finger’s combing through Harry’s soft locks.
"That? No, I figured that out a long time ago." Draco laughed.  Harry leaned against the bar and raised an eyebrow, smirking.
“Yeah, of course.”  We walked back to the Common Room together silently, thoughts about Harry flying around in my head, Blaise presumably thinking about Pansy.  When we arrived back at the Common room, Pansy took one look at me and stormed into her dorm.  I rolled my eyes and walked up to mine behind Blaise.  After changing into pyjama pants and saying goodnight to Blaise, who reminded me it was only eight, I drew the curtains around my bed and laid down.
got off with it!” I restrained myself from letting out a breath of relief. Thank Merlin. I’d see him again at Hogwarts. He would be alright for now.
"He does look pretty good," Pansy agreed.  The crowd erupted around them as the band finished the first song.  Draco immediately began pushing through the crowd to get towards the front, Pansy yelling at him as he left her.  "Asshole," She muttered as she lost sight of him, but Draco didn't care.  He needed to get closer, to see more of this new Harry.
"Too many." Said the blue-haired boy — Cole, Draco noted. He tried to ignore the cold on his now empty wrist. "Who's this?" He nodded towards Draco with a lazy smile.
"Getting you to bed,"  Draco grunted.  Harry giggled and nuzzled is head into Draco's neck.  Draco felt his face heat up again and he brought Harry into his room.  As he placed Harry on his bed, Harry wrapped his arm around Draco's neck.
"Care to grab a drink?" Harry gestured to the bar where he assumed the boys were. "I'm meant to be meeting my bandmates." Butterflies erupted in Draco's stomach. He never imagined any of this in a million years — Harry Potter was inviting him to drink with his friends, entirely willingly, while looking like a rock star.
“Relax Weasel, I’m not here to fight.  Just simply doing my rounds.”  I smirked.  Hermione rolled her eyes.
“Hey, I’m going for a walk.”  I stood up and placed my napkin next to my almost full plate of food.  “Don’t come looking for me,”  I said to Pansy as I kissed her head.
“And Potter did get what he deserved,” Crabbe joined in.  I scoffed as Blaise and Goyle nodded in agreement.
"I'm not cooking!  I'm getting takeaway, so you can either come with me or starve."  Draco stopped and glared at Harry.  Draco knew he was right — he didn't know how to cook and he was quite hungry after the day he had.
After studying for a few hours, Harry abruptly stood up and walked into the kitchen.  Draco watched as Harry came back in with a bottle and two glasses.
“I still can’t believe Potter flipped out at Umbridge like that!” Goyle said as soon as we were within earshot.
"How was I supposed to know I'd fall for you?"  Harry gave up searching the crowd and let himself go.  Draco watched in awe, now just an arms length from the barricade.  Harry captivated the stage, pulling every bit of energy out of his body and the air around him.  "Grey eyes and lips of lies and that dark tattoo!"  Draco froze.  Grey eyes... that dark tattoo... was he...  "Love seems like a curse, you made that true.  What the hell am I supposed to do with you?"  Harry was leaning down to the audience now, reaching his hand out to a handful of fans.  The opening riff poured through the speakers again as Harry turned away and began moving across the stage.  He scanned the crowd again, just for shits and giggles, until his eyes caught on a specific man — a sharp face with pastel rainbow hair.  Harry paused for a moment before turning his back to the crowd and raising his arms into the air.  Sure, it rallied the crowd, but more so, Harry needed a moment to recuperate before the rest of the song.  Hell, the rest of the set.  There's no fucking way...
“Right.  You go up to that corridor, I’ll stay around here.  Have fun!”  She started walking in the direction Weasel and Hermione left in, before calling over her shoulder: “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!”  I rolled my eyes.
“I probably can’t.  Slytherins only do rounds on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.”  I place my hand on his cheek.  “If I could sneak out, I would but…”  He nodded as his smile faded.
“Well did you tell him?”  Pansy was nearly bouncing on my bed now.  I shook my head, not meeting her eyes.
“Draco,” Pansy whispered.  I tore my gaze away from the gleeful Gryffindors and turned my attention back to my breakfast.  “You gotta stop staring at him.  Someone’s gonna notice.”  A pit grew in my stomach.  Despite the cheerful nature of breakfast, I could already feel a weight settling on my shoulders.
“Don’t be.  It was so many years ago.  It was an accident,” Draco murmured.  Harry’s eyes stayed transfixed on the scar, travelling up to Draco’s collarbone, before leaning in to press a light kiss where it ended.  He ran his hands down Draco’s sides, holding his waist as he peppered more kisses along Draco’s collarbone.  Draco sighed into the kisses.  His hands quickly found the hem of Harry’s shirt and pulled it over his head.  A pink mark was growing on Draco’s collarbone where Harry had been kissing.
Now when they got home, they'd flip a coin to see who would pick out the music for the night.  Mittens would occasionally join them, opting to sit next to Draco who would pet him in time to the music.  They'd listen to two or three albums before going to bed, Harry occasionally taking breaks from studying to dramatically sing a ballad or dance to an upbeat song.  Draco would always roll his eyes first before smiling through Harry's antics.  Harry would then collapse next to Draco with a hazy smile on his face.  Occasionally, he'd just watch Draco as he read, until Draco would meet his gaze and pink would tinge his cheeks.
“The Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this.  It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are.  It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.”
“So you’ve apologised for the bullshit you pulled earlier?”  She giggled innocently.  I rolled my eyes and pulled her out of the closet.
“Shall we sit?”  I gestured my hand to the sandy lake edge.  We walked over and sat on the last bit of grass before the sand.  “So, tell me about you.”
"I should shower at night so my hair is dry when I wake up!"  Draco said, walking past Harry to the bathroom.  Harry stuck his foot out enough to trip Draco and earn him a scowl.
“Come on, we have to go to the Prefect’s carriage.”  Pansy pulled us away from the window and we made our way to a private carriage near the front of the train.  We entered to find the Head Boy, a tall and lanky Ravenclaw, and the Head Girl, a prideful Gryffindor, waiting for the Prefects.  We were the first to enter, followed by the Ravenclaw Prefects, Hufflepuffs and finally, running in, out of breath, Hermione and Weasel.
.  Who would have thought I’d be thinking that about that godforsaken tournament.  Harry fighting a dragon or saving people from drowning in the lake?  It all seemed like nothing now.  The empty halls seemed oddly threatening, the silence seeping deep and distorting my thoughts.
“Hi.”  He looked down and swallowed.  “Look, I just wanted to apologise for last night.  I’m just tired and stressed and—”  I pulled him into my arms.
“Harry Potter?”  Dumbledore mumbled.  He looked up and glanced around.  The entire Great Hall turned and looked at Harry, who glanced around with wide eyes.
"Great," said John, beaming. "So, your role tonight is mostly just to hand out clothes from the boxes and try to engage anyone you get a sense might want to. You might get a bit of hostility sometimes, but try to respond to it with calm. You'll also get people trying to take more than they need to try and flog it, and some of them will spin you a story about how their starving children at home need four pairs of shoes. And they'll be especially enthusiastic about it because you're new. Just be calm and firm, and call me over if you think something's getting out of hand. Similarly, if you see something that makes you uncomfortable or if someone shares something with you that makes you concerned for them, let me know." John paused to look directly at Harry, face serious. "That's an important one, Harry. You need to tell me if something doesn't feel
"Yeah," said Harry. "And it's not like he could get magical intervention without admitting that he took drugs and therefore broke Muggle law."
"Yes, I know. And I also know that one can't cast aspersions on The Statute of Wizarding Secrecy without people wondering if you're the next Grindelwald. But honestly, Granger. You have Muggle parents. There's no way you haven't asked yourself why they have to have harder lives to preserve our secret? Do we
"Right," he said. "Yes, well. Thanks. And much as this has been a delight, I'm not here to ruin your afternoon, I'll just —"
"Oh, Harry!" she said. "It's easy. I'll get you a sign-up form. You can come with me on the next shift!"
Christmas seemed to arrive with no prior warning. One minute, Harry was trudging to Adhikari's office in the cold November rain, and the next he was dodging men in Santa hats passing out leaflets for Christmas musicals.
"Well, yeah but that time it made sense," said Seamus, shrugging off the discomfort of the moment. "Before that, I mean, when I used to make dirty jokes all the time —"
"Can't have that," said Harry, and let her loop her arm through his. She led him down the stairs, guiding him over a 'No Entry' sign that someone had wisely strung up on the first floor.
And it turned out he was very good at beer pong. He beat Seamus, Dean and Ron — who had forgotten his promise for 'just a quick look' — and was only narrowly beaten by Ginny, who ought to have been able to manage victory easily, but was clearly distracted by Alicia Spinnet's hand on her waist.
"Guys," said Harry, summoning his Serious Voice, the one he used when DA lessons got out of hand. "Give me the catalogue, please."
"Potter," he said. Harry couldn't speak to reply. "Harry," he said, gentler. Malfoy was bending down over him, staring into his face, and Harry felt hot and cold all over, the movement of the crowd around him claustrophobic. He couldn't see the men, he needed his wand but he couldn't do magic in front of the Muggles — his vision was tunnelling —
"You pick the items," said Dean, settling into the other beanbag besides Seamus, who gave a little snore and flung a hand over his face. "Tell me the number and the price, I'll write it down, then we can check it over and fill out the order form in the back."
He went to Quality Quidditch Supplies, and bought half the shop for Ginny. The girl behind the till looked a little faint as he rang up the order, and he politely pretended not to notice.
"You're actually mad," muttered Malfoy, making him jump. His breath tickled the back of Harry's neck.
The alarm clock read ten in the morning. Harry yanked Ron's dressing gown on in a panic, stumbling out of the bedroom and looking across the corridor to see Luna in the drawing room, nodding and talking to someone out of view.
"Look, I'm sorry.” Harry forced himself to look up at Draco, who rolled his eyes at the words. Harry winced. "I was trying. I honestly don't hate her or anything, but it just wound me up how she wouldn't leave you alone — "
"So," he said, trying to think of something he could say that would make it clear that he was totally, completely fine. "Do you think it'll go any further?"
"I hear you've been making plenty of men happy," said Seamus, waggling his eyebrows, then yelped as Dean and Ginny both prodded him. "Not a criticism!" he said. "I should be so lucky."
"Harry," she said huskily, and dived for him. Feeling a little put-upon, he allowed her rather enthusiastic hug but attempted to protest when she pinned him to the wall and stuck her tongue down his throat.
"Or alternatively," he said, voice sounding very strange, "We could skip breakfast and stay right here."
In the kitchen Seamus prattled about his feud with Healer Jones on Ward Ten as he flicked the oven on and Summoned a frozen pizza from the larder. Harry was only half-listening as he put the kettle on for tea. He picked at the wood of the kitchen table, adding a hmm at all the points he hoped he was supposed to be responding to. The Floo flared while they were waiting for the pizza and Ron jumped out of the flames, grinning and red-faced as though he'd been training moments before.
But that just meant he could always work it back to being my fault. That I was nagging, that I didn't support him enough, that I didn't understand… then he got nastier, telling me I had no right to criticise him when I was such a brat, when I'd had everything handed to me and still fucked it up, and I… I just gave in. He wasn't
"Really?" said Ginny, talking fast as though he might rescind the offer if she didn't keep speaking. "It's just, home is kind of
Harry continued to study Draco for a long moment until Draco huffed, grabbed the clipboard, and pushed it into Harry's hands. Harry, swallowing down his guilt, filled out the form and handed it back to Ellie.
Malfoy gave up his position lurking in the doorway. He sank onto the sofa and put his head in his hands.
Harry settled back into the beanbag, staring at the ceiling. He was both vaguely annoyed that Malfoy had picked today to hit the depression phase of his recovery, and vaguely comforted that he wasn't alone. They all got it, everyone in Grimmauld, but the rest of them all seemed to deal with it better than Harry. Or that's how it felt to him today.
It was ironic, really, that the thing he needed the most from therapy was help to get him to therapy.
Malfoy stuck his hand into the shelf and brought out a small paperback. He flicked through it, opened it at a particular page and handed it over.
Harry opened his mouth and arched, head turning as the hand in Harry's hair pulled too tight, and Harry fought back with tongue and teeth and nails digging into Malfoy's sides. Malfoy was more controlled this time, more precise, tongue flickering over the inside of his mouth without giving Harry a second to breathe. Harry groaned, hips moving involuntarily, and Malfoy gasped and pressed back, grinding with almost painful pressure. And Harry wanted
Harry shrugged. "Not my style.” Malfoy stared at him, as though expecting him to say something else, but Harry didn't really know what else to say.
"Ah, there you are! Dean put up a valiant fight, but now he's refusing to play again. Will no one try to knock me off my spot as reigning champion?"
"It's alright," said Harry quickly, dying inside. "Don't mind him. It's this, er, light-hearted antagonism we've got going."
"Well, I only met him six months ago," said Fish. "In the pub, the first night he was homeless. He had fifty quid in change on him and a rucksack. Stood out like a sore thumb. He sat in a corner and ordered a drink an hour for most of a day, watching his little coin pile go down. Eventually when it'd been just me and him for a couple of hours I asked if he wanted to play pool and he said he didn't know how to play, but he bought me a drink and told me that his friend had kicked him off his sofa because, get this," Fish stuck his nose in the air and pulled a face, doing a very bad impression of a posh accent: "I have a
It was dim, fully shadowed by the neighbouring buildings and blocked at the midway point by a rusting fridge-freezer jammed in between the two shops. There were empty takeaway boxes and leaflets on the floor, and an unfolded cardboard box propped up in front of the fridge. Harry mistook the box for junk at first, until he realised it had been deliberately placed to make a makeshift shelter.
"Gotta love that posh bollocks." Fish gave Harry a conspiratorial wink. "Who talks like that, anyway? I see you're on the other side of the soup spoon these days, so I reckon you owe me a thank you."
Harry slumped into the sofa opposite her. They stared at each other for a long moment, not quite glaring, but not friendly either. Draco was momentarily oblivious, as he tipped his head back and continued to inform Ginny she was profoundly incorrect about her predictions for the next Tutshill Tornados friendly.
But Malfoy did charm Ginny, Harry could tell. He started strong by continuing to join them at dinner, mostly silent but inexorably drawn to the safe topic that was Quidditch, and it seemed as though he and Ginny had a natural alignment of opinion. And then one night Ginny was mocking him, challenging him to a match at the Quidditch club, and Malfoy was
Maybe even turned on. But it just felt… kind of nice, and the ache in his chest was more jealousy because they had people to kiss, than a desire to have Ginny be
"Did you know his probation officer has been blocking his ability to get Muggle ID?" said Harry, because it seemed like a more reasonable thing to be annoyed about than 'Malfoy has a friend over'. Ron's eyebrows descended into a frown.
"Heard you were in need of some naive Gryffindor to take advantage of," said Harry, when it appeared Malfoy wasn't going to say anything else.
By five o'clock Ron and Harry had stopped making sandwiches in favour of eating them behind Kreacher's back, something Kreacher evidently had no intention of preventing, despite their increasing lack of subtlety. On one particularly transparent grab, Harry was fairly certain Kreacher winked at him. At about half past five, Ginny came downstairs. There were sparkly shamrock-shapes in her hair.
," said Dean, shrugging. "He said there was nothing he could say to make it right, but that he was sorry, and if there was anything he could do to contribute to my comfort or recovery, he would do his best."
"Pansy, you promised you wouldn't be mean to his face," drawled Draco from the stairs, and Pansy's whole face lit up. It made her softer, prettier.
Then Malfoy did stop, or at least he moved his mouth to Harry's ear, and Harry found himself shivering a little as Malfoy murmured,
Slowly, painfully slowly, Harry calmed, while Malfoy murmured quiet comfort. He stayed still for a very long time, listening to Malfoy's voice murmuring things he could never have imagined coming from that mouth.
Harry let out a heavy breath. His eyes followed Luna's nimble fingers as they stitched constellations onto his furniture with a mix of affection and despair. Perhaps romance wasn't really for him… perhaps friendship would be good enough.
Draco laughed contemptuously and leaned close, and Harry's mouth formed a silent gasp as Draco's lips came close to his own. Something hot shot through him, but Draco's lips simply dragged past his cheek, whispering in his ear.
Ron and Hermione were engaged in some enthusiastic snogging on the sofa.  Harry sat for a good ten minutes before they noticed.
"He said, and I quote, 'I am sorry I nearly killed you, and also that I was such a disgusting bigot at school.' Then he said he realised now that character is not defined by blood lines or bank accounts.
Harry bought it, relieved that Dean had warned him about how good Camden would be at relieving him of Muggle money. Then he thrust it at Malfoy, who looked astonished.
Cho's face went stony, and Harry wanted to dissolve into a puddle on the concrete and dribble away into a gutter. But then she laughed, probably at his mortified face, and patted him on the arm.
criminal. Maybe that's why he was so interested in Draco, him being a real Lord or whatever. Jenny and I warned him to stay away from Spider, but Dray kinda went all gooey from the attention and I reckon we might have driven him into his arms a bit, so to speak, because of all the fighting we were doing."
"Hermione," said Harry quietly, as they walked arm-in-arm down the darkening streets, huddled close to ward off the evening chill. "Do you have any more of that brain juice?"
Another pause, and Harry was about to snap himself out of it and go down to the kitchen when Malfoy spoke again.
The next day, Malfoy went out early again, and Harry agreed to go out to the pub for lunch with Luna and Ginny. But Harry was having one of those days where the noise was too much, where every stranger's eyes on him made him want to reach for his wand, so he begged off with a headache and went home while they were still debating dessert.
"Ah, excellent!" John gave Harry a grin. He had kind eyes that reminded Harry a little of Hagrid, if Hagrid were five foot tall. "You must be Harry. We've got you down for distributing clothing donations today. Everyone's decided to give us their winter clothes all at once! Must be this good weather we're having. If you just bear with me, Harry, I'll do your orientation in just a second."
Harry stared at him, his anger warring with his better judgement. Why was Malfoy being like this? He was just concerned. And he'd thought Draco — he'd thought there might be something there in return —
But Harry had regretted it. Even though Draco had wanted to use an Unforgivable on him, Harry regretted it, because Draco had been a mess and he was so damned proud and Harry'd never hated him enough to wish him true suffering, much less death.
Harry's birthday passed exactly how he wanted it to. He woke to a pile of presents at the foot of his bed that morning, just like at Hogwarts; his friends, bearing hugs and cups of tea, teased him about being an old man and then presented him with a stack of new vinyls and a wonky cake. They spent the evening by the fire in the drawing room listening to the new music, drinking silly mixed drinks from the cocktail book Seamus bought him until everything was soft and hazy. They played a round of charades, resulting in the worn denim of Harry's favourite jeans tearing all the way up the back seam, a split that no amount of drunken
"Yeah," agreed Jack, who looked a little like the Hardy to Derek's Laurel, "Is she, you know, good?"
Harry snorted, and headed back up the kitchen stairs. Absent-mindedly rubbing wax into the bannister of the second-floor staircase, he wondered if he should be upset. His ex, having loud sex with a strange man. And it was true that he
Draco's eyes roamed his face, settling upon his mouth. Harry's heart pounded, time stretching like elastic until Draco finally pulled himself up and crushed his mouth to Harry's.
"Hmm," said Ginny, as though she was thinking about it. Malfoy stared at her in obvious alarm. "Well, I
He didn't really understand. He didn't know if something was really going on between them at all, or if it was his own fevered imagination. He didn't know enough about what constituted a
Harry laughed and elbowed him. Malfoy elbowed him back, a smile still playing at the corner of his lip.
candidate you could think of. Literally anyone else in the room would be more likely, excepting Granger perhaps."
"Yeah," said Harry, and sank down to sit cross-legged on the gritty pavement, offering him the coffee. Malfoy took it without a thank you, and swigged it despite the scalding temperature.
Harry woke again around half-past seven, a beam of dawn light piercing through the curtains, falling into his eyes. He sat up, torn between the twin urges of thirst and the need to urinate. He slipped his arm out under Draco, careful and slow.
"Yes, isn't it odd," mused Draco, faux-casual. "Nothing ever turns out the way you think it will when you're in school. But perhaps that's for the best."
Hermione, face soft, swept forward to place the back of her hand on his forehead. Behind her, Ron raised an eyebrow, as though he were surprised such a smart woman could believe Harry actually left because he had a headache.
"Bold of you to assume he doesn't already like to hurt me," said Harry, because he was a bit giddy and because it was supposed to be a dark sort of in-joke, but Malfoy just gaped at him.
Harry looked at the money, turning the problem over in his mind, looking for a Malfoy-friendly angle on getting him to keep it.
"Take a seat. Do you mind if I draw on you? You can tell me if you like the look and placement, then we'll get started."
"Maybe I will," said Malfoy, perching on the edge of the coffee table and sipping his pineapple juice. "I've been wondering if there would be room in the dining room. I could start a mail order service, perhaps."
Harry snorted, but slid obligingly out of the van anyway, and as someone new came up to the van to talk to Draco, Harry slipped away into the crowd.
"You've got away with so much shit because of this," he said. "I really think I ought to confiscate it."
"I want you to know," said Draco, following him, "That I am only here because I didn't have a better offer. Which sounded much cooler in my head, and is actually not true. I had several offers, including being smuggled out of the country illegally to celebrate on a moonlit balcony in Paris. Some of my housemates are going to a
"Nope," said Malfoy. "Very sure. Give it here. Hermione Granger never fucks up, even I know this. Besides, what have I got to lose?"
"Sounds like you know what you want," he said, only a tinge of jealousy in his tone. "You're right not to settle for less than that. You deserve it."
"Come on," he said, following Malfoy's path through the now-open door into Ron and Hermione's dressing room. It was clear neither of them were actually using the room for dressing; the wardrobe was partially blocked by a weight rack in one corner, and in the other corner was an ornate mahogany desk carrying, incongruously, a PC, a monitor, and something that looked very much like a sort of cobbled-together industrial printer, encompassed by a set of runes all written on Post-its.
"Merlin save us all," said Malfoy, but he sounded amused rather than judgemental. "Alright, well. I was actually looking for Granger for our little testing session, but since she's not here —"
"No," he said, after another long and breathless moment. "I spent my childhood being told on the one hand that I should pretend I don't exist, and on the other that I'm personally responsible for saving the world. Honestly, I don't know how good I'm going to be at managing
"Go back to bed, Seamus," said Harry, and the sandy blond head disappeared. With the sunlight flashing on the closing window, it almost looked like the house winked, too.
"Like… like a black pit opens up inside of me when I think of it. I feel stuck between wishing I were dead, and knowing that I…"
Harry almost wanted to laugh. Sirius had built his young identity around this poster, even down to the biker jacket Harry now wore. Next to it, he'd cut out an advert of a digital wristwatch; Harry was suddenly reminded of Arthur Weasley, obsessed with Muggle things, and he wanted to laugh even more. He'd thought Sirius was so cool — and he
"You're mad, Luna Lovegood," said Malfoy, resisting her pulling hands, but he seemed a bit giddy with relief that she'd pulled him into the room, and then Ginny joined them, waving her hands above her head and barging Malfoy with her hip. Malfoy did it back to her, and then he was letting Luna drag him into her spinning dance, tapping his foot as she looped under his arm and it wasn't
He wasn't being actively hostile to Harry anymore, but he appeared to be calculatedly ignoring him most of the time. Harry, unashamedly watching Malfoy in any room he was in, still saw the glances in his direction, the little flash of silver gaze as Malfoy checked to see if his joke had landed, if Harry was still paying attention. It felt like those moments in the Great Hall, where they'd always been pretending not to notice each other, except Harry had never felt the burning urge to push Malfoy into a bean bag and kiss him senseless in the Great Hall.
," continued Hermione, and only then it occurred to Harry that something might be wrong. He didn't have much time to think, though, as Hermione pulled Ginny back by the hair and dived in, requiring his second dodge of the day.
, and Harry fumbled with Malfoy's trouser buttons, biting his lip to keep from moaning. He pushed the trousers away and wrapped a hand around Malfoy, whose hips snapped forward in a desperate, involuntary movement. Harry exhaled sharply against Malfoy's lips, thrusting his own hips, and it felt
"So now I'm sharing a house with a bunch of artists, poets and general layabouts," he continued, waving the ladle. "I
Maybe if the person he was with wanted it. Someone who wanted him, who trusted him… who loved him enough for that.
"You're not." Harry's voice was a dark growl, now. He tried, but he couldn't quite hold back the feelings burning in his chest. "I've watched you swallow your pride and take help over and over again, even when you didn't really know if you were safe. I've seen you face people you hurt. You've had to deal with everything from Voldemort threatening your family, to losing your wand rights, to having nowhere to live and surviving the attention of a nasty piece of shit, and you're
Malfoy was out again by the time Harry dragged himself out of bed. Harry tended to the garden in the morning sun, carefully spelling greenfly off the roses, and at lunchtime he flopped down beside the sunflowers with a coffee and a sandwich and read one of Neville's gardening books, occasionally prodding optimistically at his flagging sunflower.
"Both things can be true," said Malfoy, giving him a glare. "Did you think he was so unsubtle as to compliment me on things that were obviously false?"
"Yeah," said Harry. "On a somewhat related note..." He pulled a face. "I sort of need to talk to you."
the same, it felt like Seamus was just having fun, but Harry wasn't sure now. Fish had seemed fun, too.
A rare silence fell as everyone dug into the food, and Harry took up his customary habit of giving Draco a stealthy glance every few minutes only to find that Draco was already looking at him. Draco would stare at him for a long moment, as though Harry were a mysterious apparition, then his gaze would slide away, and Harry would glance at Hermione, and then sharply down at his dinner. Then he'd vow not to look at him again, until Draco made a quip or moved too fast in the corner of his eye, and the whole thing would repeat.
Inside was a leather wallet, cracked with age and held together with string. Harry slid it from its hiding place and set it on the desktop, fingers tracing over the leather binding. It felt faintly warm, another familiar signature, but not Sirius this time. It felt more like — like the faint tang of magic in the bathrooms as he cleaned the grout, the hum of the corridors as he painted over cracks in the plaster.
," she said, showing a page to Luna. "Do you think I'd look good in this one?" Luna's eyes went very wide, which seemed like a yes to Harry.
Then Malfoy was shoving too, shoving until Harry's back met the sharp spine of a book, pinning him down as he thrust his tongue into Harry's mouth. Then Malfoy tilted Harry's head and bit down on his neck, licking the mark as he tugged Harry's shirt out of his jeans. Harry groaned, unable to think with Malfoy's hips grinding against his, and scrabbled at Malfoy's chest. He struggled with himself, struggled not to succumb to this, but then there were fingers at his zip and a mouth against his earlobe and a sudden, shocking hand sliding down into his boxers.
"Draco's actually been a pretty good friend to me, for a smack'ead," he said. "It'll take more than that I think."
, and Draco was pressing back, swallowing him with a groan, and Harry was completely lost, every muscle tensed to stop himself from sinking deep into Draco and thrusting until he came unravelled. He'd never felt so connected to every part of himself, nor so attuned to every breath and gasp and flex of someone else. It was too good; he squeezed his eyes shut, because the sight of Draco with his head thrown back threatened to end him.
"No," said Malfoy, with a dark laugh, voice edging back to plummy. "This might not surprise you to hear, but the Dark Lord thought I was rather a wet blanket. I wasn't exactly
Harry set the pan down and stretched up to the top shelf to get the milk jug; when he turned back to the stove, the eggs, flour and milk were on the counter beside him. The first few times this had happened, Harry had actually jumped, but he was used to it now, and he knew better than to ask Kreacher not to do it.
"It can be like that," she said. "When Ted died, I felt lost for such a long time. It felt like it would be forever. But one day I looked up and I realised that nothing was as dark as it had once appeared. The weight of grief had lessened enough for me to start moving again. It never goes away, of course, but it always changes. Over time."
The two ladies tittered, and the one sitting closest to the van hopped up into the back of it. Hermione took up a position by the vast tureen, and they all began to distribute plastic cups of soup, bread rolls, and cups of tea down the line with practiced ease.
Harry sometimes thought he might be happiest in the garden. Closing his eyes, he could smell the warm dampness of the earth, feel the grass between his fingers. Sometimes he missed the sense of awe and space that came from seven years in a castle in the Scottish Highlands, but there was something comforting about the garden's enclosed, albeit definitely Wizard Space proportions. He often wondered who had first designed it.
"It has its perks," said Ginny, breaking the moment with an encouraging grin, and Dean's hand resumed a slow, gentle comb. Harry let out a breath. "But to be honest, the shine's gone off it a bit. Strangers are a bit of a mixed bag. Creepy or awkward or just crap. And people you know and like want to make it
Harry stared at the planes of Draco's face, familiar and dear. The idea of never knowing the man he was now hit deep in the stomach.
Pansy Parkinson did not decline Harry's invitation. The next week, Harry found himself — wearing a shirt, inexplicably — opening the door to welcome her in for dinner.
"You could eat with us first," said Hermione. For reasons that he couldn't quite explain, he avoided her eye.
"He did say he didn't feel well last night," said Dean. "I hate that he does nights, I'm sure it's bad for you."
"But that's… not enough. I want serious, and I kind of have my hopes set on someone else, but the timing isn't right for her yet. And I don't want to get involved in something with Ginny and then get my heart broken two ways, and I
Malfoy's eyes swept over the room, taking in the embroidered curtains, the bean bags and blankets, the Pamphlets, and the Black family tapestry still dominating the walls. Then he looked back at Harry, a little blank.
But as soon as he asked the question, the answer was obvious. Something cold and horrible settled over Harry's chest. He abruptly wished he were sober, too.
sorry," said Malfoy dryly. "And I'd barely slept, I was terrified he was going to wake up still angry and I'd have to do something, find somewhere to go when I didn't have anyone I could trust any more, but he was so sorry and loving and I felt so relieved it was like a high. I figured that he was probably right, I should have done better to calm him down, I shouldn't have been drunk, I should have been
be – and it seemed unavoidable that he should cover Malfoy's smirking lips. Malfoy was quick and a little vicious, biting Harry's lip and digging his nails into Harry's hips, and Harry realised he was still shoving Malfoy,
"You're right, of course." He nodded, fake-serious. "Whatever will I do then? We can't all be so lucky as to bump into a former enemy who happens to be renovating a dilapidated old wizarding house with room to spare."
"Yes, well," said Hermione. "It's all very funny, but Harry could have been hurt. What were you thinking?"
"Thanks," he said. "Look, if you wanna chat about music some other time, I'm here most weekends. Or you can give me a call. We could go for a drink, even catch a gig."
It was getting dark when he finally sat up, empty of tears and strangely lighter. He stretched, wiping his face, then went over to the desk to tidy the letter.
Harry laughed, a little hysterically, powering along to the main road and looking anywhere but Malfoy, unable to articulate the whirl of embarrassment and euphoria inside him in a way that wouldn't sound mad. How could he explain that a flirtatious exchange with a stranger had thrown a spotlight on how sheltered he'd been? How isolated he'd made himself? He'd spent so long seeing himself through a shattered lens, broken and unloveable and uninteresting besides being famous Harry Potter, but after just a few hours relaxing in the Muggle world instead of darting in and out of Tesco, he'd seen himself through new eyes. He'd met people who didn't know him, but
"Oh, Harry Potter, what a surprise," said Ginny, angry and embarrassed. "Avoid me all day only to come and find me now, when I've finally found someone who actually listens?"
"I know I'm not," Dean agreed, calm. "And let's be clear, he made a bunch of people's lives a misery when he was hanging out with that gang. Kids who might have done the same thing he did because of his bullying. Kids who deserved my time more than he did. And it's not my job to fix racist pricks, I shouldn't
Harry watched the room, listening with one ear. At one point, George and Seamus wandered downstairs, presumably to explore the dining room. Seamus's cousin became visibly bored with Ernie, and wandered downstairs as well. Then Susan Bones arrived, and Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson came upstairs to grab snacks, shedding glitter as they went. Then Blaise Zabini came up the stairs, fashionably late and wearing a dress that looked painfully expensive. She seemed perfectly at ease despite the odd look Ernie flashed her, and settled herself next to Lavender Brown as though there was nothing at all odd about her presence. And perhaps there wasn't, because Padma Patil promptly stopped looking bored and moved to give her a kiss on the cheek, like they knew each other well.
"Hermione has a leaflet about that," she said, Irish lilt sharper than Harry was used to. "Maybe you should give it to him."
. And given he had some dark shit going on in his past, nightmares and that, I guess he took to whatever it was like a duck to water. We didn't see him at the pub for months, until he turned up looking like death, with a black eye cos they'd had a fight and Spider beat the shit out of him. He wanted to come back to live with us, but Spider turned up and did a whole grand apology. When Draco caved in, he took him away, and then came back later to tell us to keep our noses out of it, in none-too-friendly language."
"Yes please," agreed Harry. Seamus grinned and pulled his head back into the corridor. "And bring the biscuits!"
"Should we be letting him wander about like that, unsupervised?" he said. "He could be, you know, buying drugs."
his front door was quite short, but familiar dread still reared its head as the door swung back, only abating at the sight of Neville's brown hair bent over the nearest window box. He took a moment to notice the door was open; Harry coughed.
Hermione said the same thing to Harry sometimes. Malfoy looked at him like he disagreed, but he closed his mouth.
Harry froze as Malfoy rounded the corner, and scrabbled for his wand. He didn't know how long that nose-blocking spell lasted, and stupid bloody Malfoy had probably taken it off anyway.
Teddy had a certain enthusiasm for making them crash, and he spent a good fifteen minutes knocking over the chunky plastic water tower and laughing hysterically when Harry set it right again. Harry listened diligently to Teddy's babbling instructions to set up the train set in ever more dangerous ways, laughing when Teddy giggled uncontrollably. He was fairly certain he wasn't supposed to be enjoying himself quite so much with a small child's toy, and a non-magical one at that, but it felt good to just
"What am I going to do?" said Malfoy. "Follow him around insulting his innuendo skills until he kicks me out?"
it a bit rough. Prefer it, one could say. I'll tell you if it's too much." His eyes darkened, flicking down to Harry's cock. "I want to
"Hey, Hermione," he heard Seamus say, as they all entered the drawing room behind him. "Malfoy was looking for you earlier."
She looked at him for a long time, first in confusion, then alarm, then slowly sliding into understanding.
"Tattoo," he said, and she looked up at him then, an appraising look. He obviously met with her approval, because she smiled.
"The next time," Malfoy continued, his voice a cut-glass drawl, "She asked me how I was doing and I said 'Well, thank you, and how are you?' and then immediately wanted to curl up and die of embarrassment. But she laughed at me, which didn't strike me as terribly professional, and I told her so. So then she apologised insincerely on purpose, and I laughed even though I didn't want to, and realised I'd found the right sort of Mind Healer for me. To answer your question, Potter, yes it helps. It took time, and it's not easy, but it helps."
, talking to Malfoy. A little uncomfortable, a little risky, like running through a briar patch, but not
he slid a hand under his pyjamas, trying not to think about what he was doing, and bit into his pillow as he brought himself to a hasty, guilty release.
"Maybe I don't understand," said Luna, "I've never done it. But why can't you love more than one person at a time? Is it something to do with being sexual together? It can't be magical, I've looked it up, but everyone
"Yeah but mate, it's a four-poster. Worth the risk, if you know what I mean," Seamus waggled his eyebrows suggestively.
The sound of the stairs creaking distracted Harry from hearing Blaise's reply. Seamus had paused on the staircase, bleary-eyed and pyjama-clad, eyeing Harry's position by the door with his eyebrows raised.
The flagstone path ended in a miniature orchard at the foot of the garden, forming a circle amongst the trees. The back wall behind the trees was a dark, mossy stone; at the right time of day, you could almost pretend the garden went on forever. Two carved stone benches fought against encroaching ivy at the centre of the path — cutting it back with a spell, Harry found himself looking at the letters
They were still at their task when Hermione swept into the kitchen, looking disapprovingly at Ron's pre-dinner sandwich and then stealing it out of his hand with a wink.
Then Draco's face hardened. He shoved Harry back; Harry stumbled, landing against Sirius's bedroom door with a thump.
Harry walked up the stairs, concentrating on the familiar steps, trying not to think too hard about what he was doing. Malfoy's door was shut; Harry knocked it awkwardly with his left elbow.
"I didn't know it was enchanted," said Harry, irritated. "You really thought I'd done it deliberately? What does this potion do exactly?"
"Oh, joy," said Draco, rubbing a hand over his face. "You want to talk. I thought you were ignoring me this week, can't we go back to that?"
They had a kind of accidental second party that night. Ginny poured everyone what she claimed to be Hair of the Dog but was really just a stiff vodka and orange, and Harry proceeded to get the dopey, messy drunk of someone who was not yet fully recovered from the previous session. He found himself lying with his legs over Ron and his head on Hermione's lap, watching Luna dance ridiculously with Ginny while the piano played a shaky tune to itself. He was warm, so warm, with Ron's hand on his ankle and Hermione gently stroking his hair. He wondered if this was what being a cat would be like — no cares, no thoughts, just the comfort of his friends.
Malfoy blushed scarlet at that, and Harry's heart threatened to hammer out of his chest. He wasn't sure why the idea of putting a collar on — or putting a collar on Malfoy — did such strange things to him, but it did, and he ended up too flustered to deny the suggestion that Malfoy was his boyfriend.
Malfoy looked at the busy street, then at Harry, then sighed. He strode up to a man in a trenchcoat, smoking a cigarette against the nearest lamp post.
"I know you live to serve, Potter," he said, with a punchable smirk that Harry chose to ignore. Instead, he focused on filling the cafetière, comforted by the rich and familiar smell of the grounds, the pleasing sight of the water filling the jug.
"You're going to be the death of me," said Draco, and Harry slid his fingers firmly into Draco until he made a desperate noise, and then closed his mouth over Draco's cock again, moving up and down with relentless rhythm. Every muscle in Draco's body tensed, his voice cracking on a groan, and Harry's mouth flooded with more bitter heat than he'd anticipated. It made him splutter in surprise, but he kept his mouth on Draco through the throes of his orgasm, until his hips stopped moving restlessly and his arse stopped clenching on Harry's fingers.
"Potter, after what's happened here tonight, if you take more than three seconds to come inside me I will take it as a personal failing, so you needn't worry about that at least."
in the hallways? And eventually kidnapped me and hid me in a cave while he attempted to murder anyone in the school he didn't like?"
"He asked if you have a problem," said Dean, much less brightly, "With two men kissing in the privacy of their own lounge."
They walked down a side road and emerged onto another street. It was immediately clear they were in the right place. The way to Camden Lock was obvious on their right, painted on a large bridge above the road, and on their left stretched a street that was almost stranger than Diagon Alley. The shop fronts were painted bold, bright colours, huge figures fixed high on the walls. Harry could see giant logos, figures of women, plaster elephants, giant shoes. The people weaving through the streets and shops were eclectic too, every kind of Muggle dress represented from the conservative to the downright bizarre. Harry and Malfoy stood there for a moment, staring, and Harry's skin tingled with a rush that felt familiar. It was like his first day on Diagon Alley, discovering a new world in the midst of dreary normality.
"God, what are we even looking for?" said Malfoy quietly. Harry shrugged and peered into the darkness for a shopkeeper. There was a man with a goatee and an eyebrow piercing leaning against a cash register at the very back of the shop, reading a magazine with a gurning guitarist on the front. Harry slipped through the shop, towards him.
Regret made Harry's feet heavy as he followed Draco to the third floor. He was foggy and irritable and unaccustomed to the weight of the feelings he'd felt tonight, and Draco looked exhausted, and he should just open his mouth to say something,
Harry strolled up to the entranceway, racking his brains for what the etiquette was for 'friends of your old rival who have dropped round for tea'. Malfoy and Zabini were there already; Zabini was raising an eyebrow at the corridor in general, and muttered something that made Malfoy laugh.
"Perhaps one day," he said, looking down at the soup. "Pass me that cup, Potter, we have another customer."
"Alright," said Harry, although ignoring Malfoy felt like ignoring something brittle and dangerous lurking in the corner of the room. He turned to the washing up. Malfoy sat for a moment, and Harry could see the confusion on his face out of the corner of his eye.
"I… think we might prefer to go out," he said, taut. "On balance, probably the best plan. Although we appreciate the hospitality."
"I like your piercing," he added, and would have died of embarrassment if the man hadn't looked thrilled.
," explained Harry quickly. "Look, I'll pay for your hostel, I'll buy you a suit for a job interview, book you a place in rehab, whatever works for you—"
Harry considered it a sign of Kreacher's emotional progress that he didn't immediately burst into tears. He simply beamed, giving Harry an appraising look up and down.
"Well," he said. "I may have downgraded to a mild dislike. On principle, you understand. Nothing personal."
George scowled at Harry, like he'd committed an act of betrayal, and stalked off. Harry's chest ached for a long moment; George used to be the more circumspect one, but he had a short fuse nowadays.
"Humans are very diverse creatures," she said. "Nobody feels exactly the same about their sexuality. I could spend forever wondering about exactly how to define all the details and boundaries of my attraction. Is it pheromones that attracted me to Ron? Does he remind me of my father? Is it that I'm attracted to personality more than looks? Then what was going on in my head with Professor Lockheart in third year? That sort of thing, round and round in circles. But at the end of the day, I know what I like and what I want when I see it, and that's all I need to know. No right or wrong about it."
He leant forward out of proximity of Malfoy, brushing the soot off her shoulder. She blinked at his hand as it approached.
When the doorbell rang a week later, Harry nearly fell off his perch on the kitchen counter, saving his tea through quick reflexes alone.
"Yeah, like that," she said, sticking her tongue out at Dean. "I was trying to fit what I thought a pretty girl would look like."
"Mr Malfoy!" said Slughorn with cold eyes. "I'll ask you to hold your tongue about the greatest hero of the age."
Luna helped him erect new wards and figure out how to re-cast the Fidelius Charm, with Harry as the Secret-Keeper. They read books about it at the kitchen table, a long discussion about phrasing and intentionality; he wasn't sure if he could call Grimmauld
Sharing in the communal hangover in the drawing room the next morning, Harry had pretty much forgotten about shopping for new clothes until Dean returned from his mission to buy milk.
But Harry knew he couldn't say a word, because if Draco thought he was just another Spider… he had to prove he wasn't. He had to be better than that.
"Yes, Potter, don't be a child about it," said Pansy. "Just because you don't understand what it means to have responsibilities to your family name — I suppose it's hard when — "
"Good," said Hermione. "Anyway, I'm not here to demand restitution. I have something for you. It's as much a favour to Harry as it is a gift for you. No need to be alarmed."
It was several cakes and two hours later when Malfoy's stream of commentary petered out. Harry looked at him, painfully aware of what a nice time he was having, and how
"Want to apologise for breathing next?" said Dean, voice amused. "It's fine, Malfoy, it's a shared space. Did you want something?"
Malfoy bucked into Harry's grasping hand, and came between their bodies with a spasm that tipped Harry over the edge. He moaned, all objections forgotten as heat and pressure pulled him over into ecstasy.
"Everybody feels like a Bubotuber at fifteen, am I right?" he said, a little loudly. "Good job we're all happy functional adults now, eh?"
Malfoy was absent at dinner again, but to avoid any funny looks Harry decided to stay downstairs to eat with the others first. Hermione, to Harry's surprise, was also absent; when he asked, Ron shrugged and said she was, "Faffing about with potions equipment upstairs again. Honestly, Harry, she keeps banning me from the dressing room to do mad projects, I have no idea why she's like this."
" he muttered, wandless, giving the alley a shifty once-over for onlookers. "Malfoy, what the fuck?"
?" whispered Seamus, bushy blond eyebrows raising, but he was distracted from responding by the soft sound of footsteps on the lower staircase. Luna and Ginny appeared on the stairs below them, Ginny wrapped tight in Luna's silk dressing gown, both blinking up at him.
"She kind of is," said Harry. "That's what's behind the curtain downstairs. She yells at us all for being Muggle-lovers and blood traitors when she's not covered up."
Harry frowned, but at least that was a good explanation for why Malfoy was helping him. He followed Malfoy deep into the bookshelves, staying close to the light, and nearly bumped into him when he stopped abruptly.
"Well," said Harry. "Technically, but I want you to feel like you're at home. And this isn't, um, an ordinary circumstance. Or, well… it's not an ordinary person."
"Actually, it's easier than I thought. Grace thought it might help just to listen, but it turns out if you kind of start vague and pause whenever you're struggling to translate something, someone offers up the right words anyway. For example, did you know that I was
"Allow me," he said, pulling his own wand out of the waistband of his pyjamas. "I'm still not used to having it back yet."
"Come on," he said gruffly, touching Malfoy on the arm and tugging him gently down the stairs. Malfoy looked at Harry's hand on him, eyes wide, and Harry dropped it.
Draco slammed into him again, pinning him hard against the wall, nails biting into Harry's shoulders.
was a perfectly reasonable adjective, besides I was thirteen years old and very much not the suave and sophisticated adult I am now —"
"Afternoon, chaps!" said Ginny, leaning against the drawing room door frame, still sweat-slicked and in her Quidditch uniform. "Good day? You'll all be delighted to hear that I
"I'm going to try on my skirt now," said Luna, pulling down her harem pants without any apparent hesitation.
Harry wasn't entirely convinced he'd always been a good friend to Neville, but he supposed that was no reason not to try now.
can't do anything right. And I'm not even fighting back now; I'm just trying to be my absolute best, hoping for those moments where the sun shines through the clouds and he smiles at me like I'm perfect.
"Get in," said Hermione, speaking before Ron did, gesturing a thumb at the bed. Harry was so grateful he could cry. He slid under the sheets between them, and it should have been weird now but it wasn't, it felt good to have Ron's steady weight on one side of him again, Hermione sliding in beside him on the other. He slid down into the covers a little, rested his forehead on Hermione's shoulder.
"It's your name," said Draco, not looking at him. "I've called you Harry before. Positively a mundane occurrence."
Malfoy returned home at ten minutes to seven, while Harry was burning his usually reliable pasta sauce and trying not to go insane. There was an odd edge to the conversation in the kitchen, everyone tense, everyone putting on a performance, as though Malfoy was already there to see them; at the sound of the front door, the conversation abruptly stopped.
"You're not a coward," he said. Malfoy just gave him a dirty look, as though Harry were insulting his intelligence to say such a thing.
He looked at the girl's nose ring, the hoop in her eyebrow, the chains in her ears. Aside from Bill's fang ear, he'd never given it much thought, but piercings were kind of
Harry wrote to his Mind Healer to confirm his appointment. He replied to Narcissa, assuring her that Draco had comported himself with the utmost dignity and decency whilst living in the house, and that his departure was entirely Harry's fault.
feeling the jealousy — jealousy and joy, because he could see that something had changed, some balance had asserted itself between them. They looked… happier, together.
"You can't make people change," she muttered, perfectly audibly, then grinned at him. "You know where I am if you need me."
He saw him again in the corridor, all glares and hate despite it all, and Harry expected them to pass each other without a word until Draco slammed him into the wall.
"I might have gone a little teetotal," he heard Draco mutter. "Just a touch. Doesn't agree with me. I'm sure you understand."
"For tomorrow we may die," agreed Harry, flashing Malfoy an encouraging grin over his shoulder. Malfoy stared back at him for a long moment. Harry's gaze slid down to Malfoy's left arm, the faint silhouette of something there beneath the makeup, and suddenly felt awful for even
"Do you protest too much, Malfoy? Because when I shut down the trade of those changing room photos in fifth year, I saw the buyer list."
Harry burned at the injustice of that, but he knew he had only himself to blame. It wasn't as though he'd stopped to eavesdrop in the hope two Slytherin buddies would say nice things about him, after all.
"Where was that energy when you swore you were too sick to help me with breakfast?" complained Ron, from his position lying on the floor by the hearth.
"Don't bother," she said. "He needs new clothes, and I've been dying to give him a makeover for years. Honestly Harry, it's not normal that all your t-shirts are four sizes too big."
Janine, laughing incongruously all through, told a story about being approached by a stranger for directions, nearly punching him in the face and then spending the rest of the day dissociated until her girlfriend found her on the couch, staring into space and surrounded by empty crisp packets. Harry wanted to tell her about the time he'd had an intrusive memory and spaced out mid-spell, turning a harmless
Harry, thrumming with relief, grinned and gave Ron the finger. Seamus snickered. Ron rolled his eyes, winked at them in an uncanny impression of his sister, and shut the bathroom window again.
It's not like I had a lot of opportunities to learn about weird sex stuff, what with all the mortal danger and everything."
Then Ron was pressing a stiff drink into his hands, something pink and fruity and smoking mysteriously. Ron tugged him into a beanbag corner, Hermione settling down gracefully beside him, both of them making a subtle barrier between him and the rest of the room. Harry loved them for it, and cursed himself.
"I'll get that," he said, smoothing his long hair back and attempting to look casual. Seamus and Ginny gave each other amused, significant looks.
wondered, and he was an open-minded person, and if nobody here in a room of his best friends thought it was weird — then it wasn't weird. And if he
but the running commentary is always there, ready to fall out of my mouth. Spider used to think it was funny, but it's not. I know now that what I think is just so, so wrong, and I try to think and speak differently, but I keep doing it, I'm doing it now, telling you every stupid thought that runs through my head like an
Then a stranger in a hurry managed to kick Malfoy in the leg, and Malfoy cursed and fell over sideways, and Harry found himself bursting into unexpected, breathy laughter.
," said Malfoy scornfully, as though it were a joke. "The extremely handsome and famous hero of the wizarding world, who used to date two of the most popular girls in the entirety of Hogwarts, is an innocent
," he drawled, a word Harry would never have imagined emerging from Malfoy's mouth. "Sounds delightful. Can I sleep now?"
The clouds came over at around half past two, and by three o'clock the sky was thick with wet, heavy raindrops. Harry pulled himself back indoors with a sigh, and was using his t-shirt to dry his hair off in the hallway when the front door opened and Malfoy walked in, bedraggled and miserable. He jumped when he spotted Harry.
"I've sort of had other things on my mind," said Harry. "And I'm not reading into it. But it does make me wonder why you're so opposed to doing it again."
"He told me why, Malfoy, and what happened next, it wasn't the point of the story," said Neville, cutting off the awkward flow. "That's not why I'm asking. Did you do it to anyone else?"
"Oh, yeah," agreed Dean. "Pretty sure he has. Luna, he asked if you'd be willing to talk to him now. He's in the kitchen."
"Why would I do that?" said Ron, looking slightly shifty. "I don't need girls to throw themselves at me. I already have the best one."
. She was definitely beautiful, apparently available, a girl. They did have a connection, of some sort. Was it
"No," said Hermione. "And I'm sure some humility will do him good… but you didn't see him. I'd have said he was on drugs if he were a Muggle."
"I know," agreed Hermione. "But if I'm honest, Ron and I thought it wouldn't last. We thought she'd get out of this phase she's in and change her mind."
Harry's birthday fell on a Friday, and the household persuaded him it was customary to spend your eighteenth getting embarrassingly drunk in a pub. In the end, he owled Neville to ask if he was being similarly badgered and if he'd like to join forces. Neville scouted out a Muggle pub to book, and Harry handled the payment.
"Does the Mind Healing help?" he asked, and Malfoy's expression of alarm dropped. He looked at Harry for a long time, mouth twitching as though he were restraining the impulse to call him rude. Which Harry thought he was a bit, but he didn't know how to have these conversations normally, how to come at a topic gently rather than just saying whatever it was that was eating at his chest.
Harry moved up the staircase a little. He could see Malfoy's back, now; he hadn't moved from the doorway.
"God knows what for, a toff like that, he said it was something to do with getting caught up with bad people, like joining a gang or something. It must have been a juvie record, he barely looks old enough to leave school. Reckon he was lying to sound like an 'ard man, to be honest. What kind of posh kid joins a gang?"
"Life of luxury, is it?" said Ron through the flames, as though they hadn't spent the past two months too exhausted to speak to each other. "PJs at three in the afternoon?"
"I mean," said Hermione, "You have too much power. Malfoy would have every possible incentive to say things he doesn't mean. Let you cross boundaries he doesn't want you to cross. If you got closer to him and then found you didn't really like him, he'd lose everything he has. He's very vulnerable, and you wanting to take care of him is only healthy if he can
In the new year, Harry used his book on House Magic to put his energy into Grimmauld, although he was running out of things to do, save for exploring the attic, which so far Harry had used only to hide old clutter he didn't have the heart to banish. And, of course, there was clearing Sirius's old room. He hadn't been able to face it yet. Regulus's room had been bad enough, a story of a childhood told in dried up quills, long-perished sweets, letters, notes from classmates and disturbing newspaper cuttings. He'd cleared away the papers and rubbish, put the letters and keepsakes aside, stripped the beds of their Slytherin green and spent an afternoon digging into the room's secrets, all the mundane little objects they'd been too busy to care about when they'd last searched the place.
"They didn't acquit him," said Harry. "He's on conditional discharge. He's monitored, he's got restrictions on travel, he can't use a wand. I think he was staying with Blaise Zabini maybe, but Zabini's trying to get in with the Unspeakables."
Harry nodded, scrubbing at his face with a tissue. Typical, they were just supposed to be talking about practicalities, and he was already crying…
Fish turned up again, more visibly drunk than he'd been the last time, but still sober enough to recognise Harry and pat him on the back.
Then the front door slammed, followed by the sounds of Dean making his way up the stairs. He entered the room by kicking the door with his foot; he was levitating a collection of plastic bags in front of him.
Except it wasn't the back of the shelf. Behind the first row of books there was a second row, and these had much more appetizing titles. There was a naked women on the spine of one particularly thick book, and she winked suggestively at Harry, tossing her long hair.
"Walked past a shop on the way to Tesco and they had big piles of these at the door. Have at it, Harry."
Harry's hands hurt and his head ached and he was conscious of every inch of his own body, of the heat where it met Draco's, of the hot, unmistakeable hardness pressing into his hip. He shifted, and Malfoy broke the kiss to exhale sharply, and Harry looked blurrily at the silver lashes inches from his own before it occurred to him that he was
"Oh good," said Malfoy, sliding up the bed to put his face in the pillow. "The best part of any hostel experience," he mumbled.
Harry wouldn't have gone to Grimmauld, not for all the gold in Gringotts, but there were reporters camped out outside the Ministry that day. He didn't think he could Apparate in the state he was in, so he ran. He ran until his legs burned, until his chest was on fire, until the world around him blurred and even the most dedicated paparazzo had given up. He ran a familiar path in the grey London rain, ran without thought, right up the steps and to the front door.
Harry sighed. Family, heritage, sexuality, who he was and what it meant… it was too much to think about. It was easier not to. He Summoned his broom from beside the back door, and spent the next few hours cleaning out the gutters, stubbornly thinking about nothing at all.
"Yep, we're all dying to enact vengeance on a homeless addict," said Harry, rolling his eyes. "Makes us feel really big and tough. Don't worry, they've all agreed you can stay."
Then Ginny resumed her speculation about Seekers, and Luna started a conversation about growing a catnip-like herb that would subdue exotic creatures with Neville, and Malfoy put his head down and ate his food in slow, careful movements, eyes flicking around like someone might snatch it away.
Harry folded his arms, annoyed he couldn't defend himself. It was perfectly normal to have complicated feelings about your only remaining nemesis. Wasn't it?
A firework went off nearby, a screaming whirl of yellow light behind the curtain. It echoed in Harry's skull, mind temporarily empty of all thought but for the image of sinking into Draco.
afraid, he thought he might be as afraid as Draco was, but he wasn't going to give up now, not when Draco walked like that and kissed like that and while he thought there might be something good that could come out of this.
"I just don't know how," Harry continued. "I thought I was going to do good by catching Dark wizards for the rest of my life, but I can't bear the thought of it now."
"Obviously," said Draco, looking at Harry's mouth again. "Not least because you are just outrageously,
all the way back to a nice, tranquil toddlerhood. Permanently. In some cases of Cruciatus damage, this is preferable to the alternative, but you're obviously not a candidate for that. You should think about this carefully."
Kreacher left him to do the lunchtime dishes, and five minutes later, the front door swung open and Malfoy walked in. He was actually
"Max offered me something called Molly once," said Ginny thoughtfully, gazing at the ceiling. "I often wonder what it would have been like…"
"Don't be ridiculous, Draco," she said. "The Greengrasses never trucked with all the pure-blood supremacy nonsense, so you've no need to snub them on principle."
"Mind you," continued Hermione scornfully, drawing Ron's attention. "I wouldn't be surprised. Have you seen what she's done with that robe? They are
on the list when he finished his round of apologies the next afternoon, leaving Neville quiet, while Seamus and Ginny dealt with their feelings by doing exaggeratedly posh impressions of their respective speeches. Malfoy stayed out of the way and didn't come downstairs to get dinner, and in a fit of pique Harry sent food upstairs by spell rather than by hand.
amount of touching, what constituted friendship and what constituted flirting. Ginny and Cho had one thing in common, and that was disinterest in being subtle; he knew where he stood, and if he wasn't sure then Ron would be there to give him a little kick. On the friendship side, he was touchy with Ron and Hermione, but he wasn't sure if their friendship was particularly normal, given what they'd been through together. They felt more like a kind of surrogate family to him, unquestionably bound.
"Right," he said. "I guess that's pretty much what happened." "In terms of being able to talk about it — yeah, it's close enough."
It turned out to be a blessing, however, when it gave him something to think about the next day other than the fact that Malfoy was out again. Even with that distraction, he must have been quite obviously moping, because Ginny spotted it and dragged him outside to the Quidditch hoop.
"Not your strongest, but I'll let it slide given the circumstances," said Harry. "Alright. I'm going to leave you alone now."
Seamus and Dean were on a date tonight, and Neville was visiting Hannah, so only Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna were waiting to greet Pansy in the dining room. Hermione was stiff in her chair, and looked as though she were only there to make a point. Ron hastily stood when they entered; Ginny looked askance at him, and he shrugged and mouthed
Harry was sure Draco wouldn't joke about it now, if he really meant it. Draco wasn't going to run away to Paris, now or any other time; Harry knew it with sudden, giddy clarity.
. The air smelled of cinnamon and sounded like Christmas bells. Everlasting icicles hung from every corner. A stand was decanting roast chestnuts to customers by itself; someone tried to take an extra one off the coals, and took a chestnut to the forehead for their trouble. As Harry watched, a young boy in front of him dropped a cup of mulled juice on the cobbles; his mother flicked the drink back into the cup with a wave of her wand, tutting. Further down, a wizard in a large top hat demonstrated a flock of flying dragon toys to an audience of starry-eyed children.
"'Human Sexual Reproduction'?" he read aloud. "Oh my God, Potter, you're reading about sex? Most people do that in
Harry hadn't really noticed. He pulled a pillow a little tighter to his chest, letting his book slide down to the floor. It had a little bee embroidered on the corner, rough silver and gold strands woven into the threads.
"Don't think this changes anything, Potter," he growled, and Harry was confused and angry, too shocked to fight back. "Don't think I'm going to roll over in gratitude, just because you deigned to give us your noble Gryffindor attention. Or do you just like to have people in your debt?"
Draco's expression was tense, but as he took in Harry's blank stare, his lips began a slow curve upward. Not quite a smile. Definitely a smirk. Harry couldn't think about anything but his desire to kiss that smirk —
He got the owl saying that Hermione was back in the country a few weeks later. He left it on the kitchen table, unable to decide if he should seek them out or let them have their reunion. He was so bad at grief, and Ron and Hermione overflowed with it.
"Yeah, heard that before," said Fish. "Look, you seem alright, but I'm not going to tell any stranger anyone else's business. Most of those who come here are avoiding someone or other who means us harm and for all I know
"What, that I hate Malfoy? I don't really. I mean he can be annoying and everything, but he helped us out in the war and I think I do like him a bit, that's why I went to his hearing –"
Luna let go of him gently, floating forward towards Ginny. Hermione spotted him and made a beeline to fill Luna's position, her movements somewhat hampered by her spectacular gold dress.
," she said. "Is Gin's memory a bit, um, compromised, or was your boarding school secretly some kind of bizarre cult? Because based on what she's told us, I don't think they'd have passed Ofsted."
"Alcohol and recovering addicts don't mix," explained Hermione, with the edge of condescension she occasionally used on Luna. Harry was fairly certain Luna noticed, but she never commented. "There's
Ginny and Ron insisted upon following Dean to the post box, fascinated by how it worked. Harry let them go, and in the quiet he picked up the catalogue again, surprised at how excited he was to see his new clothes. It felt like more than just a necessity. It felt like new growth, like the start of a change. He'd almost forgotten that he was allowed to have nice things.
"Potter," called Malfoy, from the kitchen doorway. He was leaning against the doorframe, the Nirvana shirt tight over his slim shoulders, black pyjama bottoms low on his hips, feet bare. He was staring at Harry with a grey-blue gaze that sent a jolt through Harry's veins.
"Most Muggles have absolutely no idea how a CD player works, let alone wizards," said Dean. "But good luck to you."
"Yes!" said Ginny, ripping into a plastic bag and pulling out her silk-and-string dress. "Right, nobody look!"
Harry didn't wait to hear Dean's answer to that. He stomped up the last few steps into the drawing room and dropped the tray onto the coffee table.
He didn't know how he got down to the first floor, and he didn't really register knocking on Ron and Hermione's door until Hermione peered out at him, in a hair wrap and pink pyjamas. She took one look at him and slung the door wide.
"Hey... so if Gryffindor girls are kinky... your sister is a Gryffindor girl, isn't she?" teased Jack to Ron. Ron threw his pillow at him.
"He told us a bit," said Dean slowly. "I don't think he represented it to us in quite the way you're representing it now, though. Malfoy, are you gay?"
Draco clutched at his hips, encouraging him into a steady rhythm, and Harry could only think about the pounding of his pulse in his body. He looked down, and the sight of himself vanishing into Draco made him stutter; he shifted position, lifting Draco's hips, and Draco made a desperate sound. He thrust a little harder, watching Draco's tensed limbs for the twitch that let him know he was doing something good. Draco was muttering curse words into the air, one hand sliding to grasp his hardening cock; the sight of Draco's balls drawing tighter brought Harry close, too close. He jerked, unable to do much more but hold onto Draco's hips and make shallow thrusts before he was dragged, unwilling, over the edge. He came, and it felt like infinity, a spark of lust up his legs and throbbing, pulsing through and out of him.
