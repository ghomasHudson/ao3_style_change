“AVADA KEDABRA.”
“A salad?” He asked arching an eyebrow.
“It’s a stupid list, weasel.”
“Potter, if I’m right, I’m going to be the only one of us who got two horcruxes. There is no place for humbleness.”
“You haven’t. You were too afraid to do something about it, because of many reasons, one of them being your prick of a father.” She said determined. “I need you to forget about those reasons and just go for it. If we are lucky, we’ll see each other when this is all over.”
“The prat’s lips kissed you and you woke up; I don’t have proof, neither do I have doubts.”  He could punch her, she was so annoying when she got like this.
“It seems-“ Potter’s voice stated, determined. “-despite your exhaustive defensive strategies-“
“But what if I never find anybody else?”
“I apologize, your highness.” Was the only thing that came out instead.
"Malfoy."
And now, apparently, Draco had said an atrocious thing again because Harry took off his glasses to rub his eyes with exasperation as he let out a groan.
If only the conversation would have ended there.
“It’s
“Let me put it this way: you are not leaving this house. You are still
“Hey, at least we kiss and stuff. What are you doing with the weasel, huh? Oh, that’s right: nothing.”
“For Salazar’s sake Pansy! This is getting old.”

The flowers were constantly cutting him. He became used to the disgusting metallic taste in his mouth mixed with the flowery taste. And the lungs, Merlin. Breathing was so fucking difficult, it was a chore, a job, he had to do it and force himself to keep on doing it because otherwise he would die... But it was so painful, so fucking painful. Like, right then, Draco could feel the breeze caressing his face, he could smell the scent of the forest, but when he tried to take a deep breath it would just end in coughing. The flowers missed Potter and Draco felt the same way, he couldn’t even argue with them about it.
Nott said that he needed help with the prisoners, given the fact that he had to feed three people (which made Bellatrix sneer just at the idea of calling them people) that had been starving for four days. It was a given that Wormtail would be suggested for the task, considering that no other wanted to come near the cellars, clearly.
“No, I see you often enough, weasel. Besides, I promised Blaise I’ll sit with him and Pansy.”
“Yeah, it’s just this bloody door” He opened more and pushed it more forcefully. Not a problem then. Weird. He sat beside Blaise, still confused about what just happened. When he looked at the empty space next to the girl, he saw a flash of something white that quickly disappeared. He frowned.
Draco couldn’t figure out why suddenly Potter was sad again but the flowers started to get anxious, begging him to put a smile on the boy’s face. He didn’t think much as he got off the bed and pulled the covers to get inside of the bed. His heart hammering against his chest to the beat of the daffodils slamming themselves against his lungs.
Draco hated to talk about this because Sirius would
—————————
“Sirius, we are all adults here.” That was professor Lupin, of course. He had always been kind at Hogwarts, he’d understood when Draco has asked not to face the boggart in third year, just smiled and said that he would give him a paperwork to keep his marks up. (Draco hated Boggarts, they always ended up being Lucius).
“I’ll send a Patronus. Anything else?”
He sat next to Pansy.
He walked toward Granger’s room and knocked.
When Draco finally got to the gardens he smiled. Potter and his father were flying around, and Sirius was taking pictures of them together on the air. They looked so happy together... It always made him feel peaceful. He was watching them when he heard Granger beside him.
found him eating alone at the Leaky. Apparently it was their
And Draco hated them a little for knowing him too well.
“Jamie, could you leave us alone for a minute?” He asked kindly, looking at the man behind him.
She stormed out of the room and the sound of her steps on the stairs echoed around the house. Harry just turned to look at both of them.
“I- I-“ And the few things that were still on his hands, a bag with quills and parchment, falls off his hands. “Shit.” He cursed as he bend over to collect his things.
Potter had broken up with Ginevra in the first year of Auror training. No explanation, nothing. Now it’s been four years and he hadn’t been in a relationship since, at least not that Draco was aware of.
“Call it a hunch, Potty.”
"Wait! Malfoy!"
“I thought you were sleeping...” His shy voice made the flowers move inside of him, trying to state their dislike with the situation.
“Did you know that your son had to kill a teacher in his first year? Or that he voluntarily went inside of the Chamber of Secrets
"If he gets in one of those moods today, it's your turn Ronald."
A lot of ways to respond to Potter flashed through his mind.
2. The parents of said children would sleep in the house because five kids were enough of a headache, eight were too much of a nightmare for Harry and Draco to handle on their own.
It wasn’t easy. He always noticed Malfoy in a physical kind of way... His features, how he walked or the color of his hair and how it reflected the sun when he was playing quidditch. He just thought that everyone noticed that, after all, Draco was very pretty, like Fleur, it was hard not to see it.
The mischief in his hazel eyes was the most indecent thing that the blond boy had seen in his short life. Draco laughed and called him a deluded idiot before pushing him to lay on the mattress and kissing him again.
“Write!!” Elio shouted.
He was at the infirmary, lying in the bed next to Theodore. He had asked Severus to spend the night, and because he saw him really upset, his godfather allowed it.
"Harry, It's not real,
He heard a knock on his door.
“What day is it?” His voice came out rough, his throat was dry.
And after that, they had to camp in different places every three days. But it was taking time, they brainstormed where the horcrux could be but it was useless. There wasn’t any sure lead to follow. Not like the vault at least.
He couldn't sleep, and usually it wouldn't have been something odd... These last two months falling asleep was difficult because his mind wouldn't shut up, but that wasn't the case that night.
“They are not back yet!” He said and that made the daffodils hurt him because it was like he kept reminding them that Potter was not here. He coughed a few times before speaking again. “
He needed to find them.
“Kid, I was the one who drag him away from you after that fall. He was frantic, screaming bloody murder... I don’t think he is right in getting angry about this, but...” The man looked at him with kind eyes. “Maybe you don’t realize it, but he cares so much about you.” Draco could feel the daffodils moving all over, happy. “And he’ll probably kill me for telling you this, but he was really upset and worried when he heard about your condition.”
Hermione barked out a laugh almost knocking the tea right next to her.
“Great, first:” Harry said as he took his Firebolt and put it in his lap. “Finish polishing my broom.”
The boy raised his eyes to meet Draco’s. Soft blush on his cheeks and nose. He thought that he had, not ever, been so close to kissing him. Their faces were barely apart, he could close the distance in only seconds. The daffodils seemed to realize that this was not the moment to make him cough, they just kept dancing around, inside of him, giving him this amazing feeling of anticipation.
He didn’t want to lie either, not again, so he just responded:
Draco spent the rest of the day brewing potions with Hermione. Weasley helped them doing basic stuff like chopping or looking at the cauldrons when they were busy with another one. Potter was nowhere to be seen, the blond boy imagined that he was being told off and educated while the three of them tried to brew pepper up potion for an army.
“Sex, Weasley. Say the word. You are sixteen years old and will be seventeen on March.” He huffed and saw the redhead smiling brightly at him.
The dark haired boy had a confused look in his face. He shook his head.
Draco knew that they had this conversation a thousand times already. Often enough, Theo would said something that upset Draco, and then he would asked for his forgiveness. He didn’t know how this would work right now, since they weren’t talking to each other. He sighed, this sucked.
And Draco watched him go, being indecently handsome and flirty in the most subtle way possible.
“No.”
Three weeks. Three weeks and he would go on a date with Malfoy. Harry couldn’t wait.
“Right??” Weasley said in agreement. He turned to look at the rest of the golden trio, making a face:
"Why?" He insisted, the kind look in her silver eyes almost disappeared with how annoyed she was.
If Draco had to separate them by closeness, he would say that Leo and Rose were one pair, while Albus and Kale were another. Harry always said that the twins would ended up in Slytherin together but Draco had his doubts... He thought that Leo would probably end up in Gryffindor with Rose and Albus most certainly would go to Slytherin with Kale.
"I don't understand what that has to do with telling Potter."
Draco nodded and gave him one last hug before he went looking for the Gryffindors.
“So, are you saying that the eight years of age gap don’t matter? Does he like blonds?”
The boy turned around and left. Draco could feel the tears starting to come out of his eyes. He could also feel his lungs burning.
“Hey!” He complained but Draco’s words had almost an instant effect on Teddy and soon enough he let Harry go to wrap his little hand around Draco’s finger and glare at Harry.
His hair was blue now, it changed with his mood but Draco never saw him with this one so he couldn’t guess what it meant.
He tried to incorporate himself, cleaning some of the blood that was left in his mouth.
Then, everybody gasped and the students voices filled the silence. That had to be Harry, it just had to be. The daffodils twirled inside of him, anticipating seeing him, hearing him.
“I’m glad you were my first kiss, though. I love you, darling.”
“Don’t call the ferret that, he could kill you.”
When they got in, Padfoot came to greet them, and frowned when he only found Harry with his father. He didn’t ask, though. It was better that way.
“ Yeah? Well, don’t hold your breath.” He ended the conversation right there and stormed off to his room; dramatic door slammed and all.
“But it sounded like such a brilliant idea, Nott.”
well...huh...”
Sirius blinked.
’. It always amused him how cheeky Potter was with everyone, with his Gryffindors or even with the professors. Because Draco saw that the other two men didn’t know how to respond to that he intervened.
“That-... That goes to you as well. Do whatever you need to do Draco. You already have the death sentence, please try to have the option of being alive.”
“Yes, you are right. Of course.” The boy cleared his throat before continuing. “I’ll meet you outside in 15 minutes? I think I need to be alone for a little while.”
’. Of course, none of them said a word on the matter, they just made gestures of displeasure in silence.
“He sent you to die, Harry.” And that was James, saying what Draco had been thinking since the beginning.
Pansy couldn't believe that she was doing a Gryffindor make-up for Draco Lucius Malfoy.
? But Harry knew that Draco did have feelings and Nott was the twat who took advantage of that. What a fucking prick.
The tents were three. Separated by years: there was the big tent where the twins, Kale and Rose slept; and two others, one for Lily and Hugo, and one for Adhara and Elio.
“Oh, come on! I’ll pay for everything. The robes, whatever you need, the haircut even.”
Ps. Sorry if you find any errors (from grammar or vocabulary)
it was Harry? This is really bad Mione. He will hate you for keeping this from him. I’m not going to be a part of it.” Then he turned to Draco. “Eventually, that door will open and I’m going to tell him, don’t think I won’t.”
“I like her, I care about her... I just... How do I know if I love her? Shouldn’t it feel earth-shattering or something?”
————————
” said the boy with a smile on his face.
“I- I’ll go see if your- if your dad needs help with dinner.”
But when he turned to look at him, the blond boy had his face all red. Tears were escaping his grey (some would say beautiful) eyes, before the sobbing began. Soon enough, Draco had threw himself
“I-I’m sorr-y” Harry starts to say in between sobs. “That was awful to say. I-I’m awful to y-you, all the time.”
The boy was still unconscious. Draco was looking at him, trying to fall sleep... But the scene from the bathroom kept repeating in his head. He shouldn’t have approached Theo, if he hadn’t, then maybe this wouldn’t have happened.
“Yeah... but I guess it wasn’t very
Hello!! I hope you like this one! Tell me in the comments what you thought 💕
He tilted his head a little and closed the distance between them, planting a soft kiss on Harry’s cheek.
Blaise and Pansy were already at the Gryffindor table with the Golden Trio and some of the other Gryffindors. It was kind of bizarre to see them with green ties in a sea of Red and golden.
Weasley, who was looking at the scene in front of him, trying not to laugh, grabbed Potter by the shoulder and drag him away from the table. He could hear him saying to his best friend ‘Come on, mate. Let’s go.’ The green-eyed boy turned to look at Draco before walking away.
look at the titles of the songs. Potter teased him for it, said that he was the most weird person ever; Draco tended to ignore his comments on the matter.
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me, Potter.” The boy frowned at him. “Would you explain why were you even spying? Did saint Potter thought that this was an opportunity to finally find out if I’m lying about what side I am?” The boy shrugged and crossed his arms.
“What?” Mr. Potter asked.
After a while they said goodbye to Potter, with the promise to meet him at the common room when the match ended. The green-eyed boy just nodded and wished them luck before going to meet Severus for his detention.
And the Elf lowered his ears, turning around, muttering things along the lines of ‘Gryffindors never listen to Kreacher’ and ‘Just like Insolent Master Sirius’.
He was really lonely, wasn’t he?
?” Harry asked beaming. “I was under the impression that my glasses are out of fashion, that my hair is a bird’s nest...” His tone was playful and the blond boy was glad that he was starting to give all those insults a different kind of meaning. “That my scar is ugly, and that I look like a third year because I’m short and skinny.”
Edward Remus Lupin had been born on the beginning of March and Draco craved to meet him, he just wished that it would have been in other circumstances.
“So the only thing that could make you stop loving him, would be if he turned into a murderous lunatic like your Aunt.” And Malfoy stared at him then. Curious grey eyes looking for something.
It’s not like if Draco had asked to sleep with him or anything either way... Harry wasn’t going to ask for it... The blond boy was in love with someone else and
“I know, I’m just saying that maybe my son needs to hear that... He thinks that you hate him now.” The flowers started to scratch him, hurting him. “We all know that you don’t, Sirius is in his room trying to make him understand, but his brain is just not listening right now. Maybe if you talk to him...”
Ps. As always I’ve checked but I’m sorry if you find any grammar or vocabulary errors.
“Do you know the rules, weasel?” Ron shook his head. “Well, it’s simple. Each of us gets a glass filled with firewhiskey, someone says something they never have done, and if you’ve done it: you drink.”
“I’m sorry, Mr. Nott, it’s just our policy.”
"But what?"  He heard her sigh with one of those sighs that meant she was now pissed off at him. "...What?"
“I really doubt that, Potter.”
The flowers were slamming themselves against his lungs, begging  for him to do something. He tried to hold down the coughs but he couldn’t, Potter’s eyes were too pained and he couldn’t handle it.
“Err- I- I didn’t realize until a year after the Hanahaki-“
Weasley was looking at him, as if he was trying to figure him out. Then he pulled a disgusted face.
It was a mistake. Weasley didn’t see anything bad with it, clearly, but what happened next was that Remus Lupin started to lecture Draco about the dangers of what he had implied.
Theo even kissed him and swallowed some of the petals. Draco thought that it was the hottest thing he ever experienced.
“Are you going to just stand there?”
“The stone... We don’t have the wand, no one tried to look for it so we don’t have it, but the stone.”
Harry chuckled softly.
His best friends seemed delighted with the idea, Harry was just thinking that he could barely stand to look at the brunette, much less exist in the same fucking place for a few hours.
“Severus, yes.”
Draco left Harry’s mouth to star trailing kissed down his throat. He could hear him panting, he could see him curling his fingers around the sheets until they were white, biting his lip to avoid making too much noise.
“Dragon, are you okay?” Said Blaise while he looked at him with kind eyes. Draco smiled and nodded, said that maybe he was tired. The boy told him that he could put his head on his lap to rest a little if he wanted. It was comfortable enough... most of all, it felt really soothing to be close to him this way. Maybe he had a shot at asking Blaise for
after Ginevra.
Draco chuckled and pulled away from the hug to look at him.
Potter excused himself and left the room. Weasley sighed.
He moved smoothly across the room and directly into the bed, lifting the covers to get in. Everything seemed to happen so fast, faster than Harry’s brain was responding at the moment.
When everyone stopped yelling at each other to look at them, Draco just raised his left hand to show the beautiful ring.
Draco frowned.
“Oh, I forgot to tell you! Charlie arrives tomorrow so he will come too.”
“How was I supposed to? Are you kidding me?” But Mr. Potter seemed to ignore him.
See? It’s useless for me to do anything else than enjoy what’s left. That was her mercy in all of this.”
“Dragon! You’ve got-“ But his voice was cut out by the door of the room getting closed.
Draco couldn’t find it in him to regret the less cunning decision he made on his life. Thinking that, probably, he would make a whole bunch of un-slytherin decisions if it meant to have the people he loved happy and safe.
“Please, don’t say things that you are not sure of. I’ve never felt like this and everything already is complicated enough.”
"I shouldn't be saying this to you. To be frank, I can't find any more information than what Dumbledore told Harry... Maybe you know about this." She said with hesitation in her tone."Apparently,
And now he needed to count again. He closed his eyes.
“Did you came to tell me ‘I told you so’?” The blond boy asked in an annoyed tone. Potter walked quietly to where he was.
“You possess all three of the Deathly Hallows, The Invisibility Cloak, The  Resurrection Stone and The Elder Wand... And even having all those items, you decided to face Death rather than to run away from me.”
.” He cleaned his eyes with the back on his hand. “I know it’s really shitty of me but sometimes I wish that he would choose me. And I know that it’s wrong because it’s going to kill him. I fucking know it, but I want it. I want him to write letters to me, I want him to
“I didn’t ask for them to be involved. We were going to run away, remember? We all agreed that living in a house was much more comfortable.”
Trying to ignore the fact that the daffodils were practically eating him from inside out, begging him to go back to the boy sooner. Draco was not going to listen to them, though. They could tried to make him throw up flowers for all he cared.
His hand began to move, tracing the petals with each movement. Harry fixed his glasses and peeked over his godfather’s shoulder.
“Your secret is safe with me, Theodore.” Then everyone got in and that was that.
Ps. Sorry if you find any errors (grammar or vocabulary)
“I don’t!”
, I don’t need Potter going with the tale to Kingsley.”
Potter laughed and hugged them again, then he turned to look at him.
———————
He decided to read a book outside for a change. If he was going to be a depressing teenager, he would at least have a nice view while he was at it. He found a quiet place next to the lake and laid down on the grass. Draco closed his eyes for a little while, to let himself enjoy having fresh air inside his lungs for once. Breathing was different now, though. He could tell. It was like if the air never got too deep. Fucking daffodils.
“Cheers to that, weasel.” Ron rolled his eyes before continuing.
, Salazar. He should always just know things.
, He thought as he hid the table, right by the end that was opposite to the kitchen door, and also (this is just a coincidence, he did not do this on purpose) next to Potter’s chair. The prat who live looked down to where he was hiding as if Draco had utterly lost it.
“Well, not all of us have options, Potter. And Caleb makes me happy. I thought you all were going to be happy for me,at least-“
Bloody Potter. All the things he made for him and he still didn’t trust him. Fuck him. He got up and left the compartment. He started walking through the hallway of the train.
“Hales.”
“No, Pansy and Blaise feel a little abandoned because I spend Sundays with Weasley already. I promised to be with them the entire day... But this happened. I’m meeting them there later.” The girl murmured something like ‘Oh... okay’ and nodded.
He was tired, a nap wouldn’t be a bad thing either... Draco slowly got off the bed, just so he could lay beside the boy properly. He snuggled closer and spooning Harry with his body, breathing in the smell of his hair that brushed the blond boy’s nose.
A few more days and between the magic of the sea and a few hugs from Bill, the redhead could be purified from everything... He would still miss everyone, that wasn’t going to just disappear, but it would be more bearable.
The boy shrugged and started to play with the sheet that was covering him.
It was unbelievable, how Draco could be crying, inconsolable, and still threaten someone in between the sobs. He wanted to kiss him so bad that his lips were hurting.
Sirius was right behind him, putting a hand in his shoulder.
, face torture; I don’t think that’s fair for a sixteen year old, don’t you agree?” Dumbledore said as he took another sip of his tea. “However, since you are close to him... let him know that we can provide shelter for him, that he has options. I would appreciate it very much.”
New friends.
“I think I would want the stone... Jamie is here with me, but Regulus isn’t... It would be nice to tell him that I destroyed the horcrux he stole.”
They weren’t moving, the moment seemed to stretch out, time was much more dense, the air was so enchanting, and Draco could swear that Potter’s magic was calling for him.
When he turned to look at the boy, he saw him as red as the Gryffindor flag, looking at him with wide eyes, expectant. But it was too much, at least for him, right now.
When the door closed behind him, Draco touched his ribs. The tickles were still there, but smaller. He spent enough years reacting to Potter and feeling stuff to know that this wasn’t normal.
Draco heaved a sigh, “I know. I don’t think about it.”
Draco nodded but he was frowning. He’d always cared what people thought of him. It was another hard lesson to learn that he shouldn’t. That he couldn’t, if he ever wanted to separate himself from their expectations.
Thank you so much for the encouragement. I am several chapters ahead and the feedback really helps me not to get discouraged. You are fantastic for helping out.
The new comers bustled by and took chairs at the circle. Ben scowled but turned towards the chairs as well. “Yes, Healer Murphy.”
Draco showed interest at the news and glanced towards Harry.
“Fine,” Harry bite off.
“Yes,” Harry warmed up to the idea, “you and me, yeah. I want to test myself against you. Duel me Draco.” He nudged him again, batting his eyelashes when Draco looked at him.
Harry chuckled. “If we keep it up maybe they’ll toss us out.”
“I’m Harry.” He shook her hand.
Harry nodded. “Yep.”
. What are you supposed to do when every adult around you is using you and you can’t trust a single one of them? Anyone here had that woe?” He looked around briefly but most students seemed too shocked to even try. Harry rolled his shoulders, “so me and Malfoy again, becoming a theme here.”
“Mandy!” Healer Murphy snapped.
Draco glanced Harry’s way again, the other boy gave him a small nod of encouragement and a mental push of reassurance. Draco put the sunglasses on with as much daring as he could gather.
Next to Harry, Ron hissed in aggravation with a muttered, ‘unbelievable’. Harry sighed. He had never really thought of Malfoy inheriting the Black title. It didn’t really bother him, as Sirius had been disinherited he’d never held it anyway. Harry turned as did everyone else towards the door. He noticed the reporters nearly salivating with want.
“No worries lads,” Tawy turned, “come along now and well get started.”
Only seven or eight of the group stayed to hear what he had to say, and it was George’s luck that it was pretty much the group he wanted to speak with.
The others looked skeptical but that was as far as Harry was going to talk about the wand. The Ministry had wanted the wand, badly. He’d told them it had been broken and had disappeared after the battle. He also knew those who knew him well enough would see the lie. He thought Draco might be one of those. Hell, the Ministry had wanted his own wand and Malfoy’s too, but Harry had refused. He thought quickly and then something from earlier poked his thoughts. “My god-father was not some kind of deranged monster.”
Mandy’s eyes widened. “Yeah, she’d be alright with that.”
“Father had it made for me.”
“Except every other student hasn’t spent their summer in a madhouse.” Draco muttered.
never done with Fred at his side. George knew someone had to handle this newest crisis. He also knew it couldn’t be him, not now, maybe never. He hoped they had more to give as he was just tapped out.
Hermione was much more circumvent about her body’s complaints, but she too was glad they were taking a break.
Charlie jumped slightly as he was yanked away. He turned to see Bill shaking his head, “a longer moment Charlie. They’ve been apart awhile and it’s been doing Ron no good to be separated from Harry so long.”
“I don’t mind.”
“Father chose it.”
They sat on the couch, and she gave them a few moments to arrange themselves. She did note they chose to sit together on the couch rather than apart. “Now that you’ve been here for a week or so, I’m sure you both have some questions. Let’s start there.”
Harry nodded, “yeah, let’s just get this over with.”
Harry jumped up, “sure,” Draco titled his head in Harry’s direction and Harry brushed a kiss across his cheek before joining her.
Harry smiled at his back. He glanced back towards Violet’s wide eyes and remembered muggles weren’t as accepting of same-sex relationships as wizards were. “Ah,”
Ron chuckled. “And that’s the best of the lot.”
Draco nodded and kept the disgust off his face. It wasn’t like he had a choice. He rather wished the woman would stop asking him like he could say no.
Tawy nodded, “yes, have fun. Talk to your friends, play.”
They shook hands as Ms. Black said, “I’d like you to meet my son, Severus.”
“The highest,” she replied primely, before she grinned, laughing.
Draco huffed in wounded aggravation. “I’ve always known that if I wasn’t what they wanted me to be, they wouldn’t want me. And I’m not, I’m so not, I’m so far from what they want, what they expect of me. I’m a coward. I’m not strong. I don’t agree with what they want. If you kill everyone you’re better than then who are you better than? I’m glad the Dark Lord lost. I’m glad he’s dead.”
Narcissa smiled and made small talk. She mentioned he looked well, but that was an understatement. She couldn’t remember the last time he’d looked so well. When last, she’d seen him the dark circles beneath his eyes had been nearly black. Now they were shades, it hurt that another had been able to help him when she herself had not. Between her own feelings and those of Lucius’ that twisted into her, but did not show past his icy demeaner, it was everything she could do not to scream and cry at the boy. Narcissa glanced towards Tawy and took a deep breath, determined to hold her grace in the presence of the ministry.
“I’m going to the ministry. I can’t abide that woman sending back my letters.”
She couldn’t speak, for her tears, but he saw the destroyed paper and took the crumbled pieces from her hand.
Draco found the mall horrifying. They’d been there an hour and bought nothing even though Violet had pointed out several things that would be good enough. He leaned into Harry as Violet and Mandy pursued a sales rounder a few feet away. “Harry all this stuff is cheap. Look there’s lots of the same thing, nothing is original. They don’t even measure you and I think some of it is made from things not fabric and the leather feels wrong.”
“Vane, you touch that step and every one of us is gonna be drugged to the gills and restrained.”
The light turned off by itself as they both lay down.
One of her regulars danced by, “Thanks for bringing in the eye-candy Violet.”
Draco quickly answered. “No. Father would never have it.”
Harry nodded as he stood up. Speechless as Draco led him to the fitting room, until the doorway where he grabbed a kiss. “You’re gorgeous.”
The Healer raised an eyebrow, “Is there something I should be looking for?”
“My roommate had a nightmare last night and she kind-a blew up her bed with accidental magic. It really scared me.”
“Ah,” he looked to Shacklebolt then Andromeda, “there isn’t one sir.”
Draco nodded and tried to find all the different shades of green.
The room wasn’t big and there were no windows, but it was a lot larger than a cupboard, which was really all he asked of from a room. There was a table with four chairs. The fore mentioned wardrobe with a door to the bathroom between it and another wardrobe. The twin bed he sat on had a nice puffy pillow and soft, warm blankets. He looked across the small night stand to the second twin bed, where Malfoy was still upset about having to turn their wands over, for a little while Tawy had promised, but still.
“Draco.” Harry squeezed Draco’s hand.
“Huh, would you go with me…to see the goblins?” Harry bit his lip, putting all his attention to the hair he was braiding as he waited. He was a little wary of asking the goblins for anything after the dragon incident. Even if they’d theoretically forgiven him. Harry feel better bringing his own dragon.
Harry watched him go with lead in his stomach. He threw off Hermione’s hand when she reached for him again. The lead turned to molten lava when someone began to clap and then everyone was clapping and laughing and Harry knew this was where he lost it too.
Murphy noticed their silent conversation, “Healer Tawy has signed for you both to take part.”
Harry threw up his hand as he stood, the doors responded by slamming shut. He stood on the bench and then the table and said, “shut the fuck up.” He didn’t yell but he might as well had as the room went dead silent.
Harry couldn’t help but agree. They’d been here since this morning and he was pretty sure the next couple of hours, after the lunch break, would be more of the same. So far, the Wizengamot hadn’t cast judgment on too many people he actually knew. People he knew of, yes, such as Goyle Sr., who had been re-sentenced to Azkaban for life. Most of the people he knew were either dead like Bellatrix or students like Pansy Parkinson and Goyle Jr., who had already been sentenced to very strict probations, community service, and fines by the lower courts. There were only a few students and young adults being charged and sentenced with their parents. Millicent Bulstrode and her parents had gone yesterday. She’d gotten two years of house arrest for her actions during the battle.
Draco huffed and leaned in. “I’m a villain in disgrace and you’re the hero. Of course, they want pictures Potter. Thankfully they’ll have to live in want.”
“Yeah, might take me a few minutes depending, but yeah, I can throw it off.” Harry looked to Draco.
She looked to Draco.
He took the seat across from her at the welcoming wave of hand, “Malfoy and Potter.”
“Surely you had noticed.”
“What does that mean?”
Tawy gestured for Andromeda to sit and sat down at the table across from her, “before you go, I’d like to discuss how this will be handled with you.”
Draco looked at Harry who nodded and he added, “it helps.”
Draco took the potion and made a face, “ewch.”
Hestia Jones, Professor McGonagall, Madam Poppy and several others of the ladies ended up around the kitchen table, where Molly had put out snacks, regardless of the fact that they’d all just eaten. They all had tea in hand and Harry was fairly sure he knew where the conversation would lead. He put Ron and Hermione off when they wanted to join the younger people outside and waited until he was sure they had gone before he found himself a chair. The perfect chair turned enough that he wouldn’t be in direct view of the kitchen but close enough to hear. He hung his robes over the back and now in his tee shirt and jeans settled in as if he were taking a nap. It didn’t take long.
She waved him off with the warmest smile yet. She leaned forward. “I work at a gay friendly nightclub, no judgement.” She shrugged at his shocked look.
Hermione refolded the page, “we put it somewhere. Somewhere neither of them would ever run across it. Or at least not unless we think Malfoy needs to see it.”
child to this intrepid war. My family has been fighting and dying in this war before
Ron groaned, “Not you too. How did I not see this?”
“I wanna know how they did it?” Mandy asked, staring their way with a scowl fixed on her face.
George looked around the group and nabbed Neville’s arm, pulling Neville away as he called out, “just a moment.” He took them a few feet away and with a flick of his wand raised a privacy shield, hoping none of the group knew Harry’s little trick. “Look, you need to only bring in the people you trust. I know Ron and Hermione met with this group before they left out, but this is going to get hairy…
Several men in solicitor’s robes made a fast pace into the room.
“Wait,” Draco sat up, “wait, we’ll still be your wards?”
“Vane,” Draco answered back just as dully.
Harry shook his head, while Draco said, “Oh I can assure you, it’s no more exciting being kicked around by Voldemort than by any other adult. Unless, you mean by excitement, the possibility that he might actually kill you.”
George didn’t interrupt. He may not understand this group, but he knew better than to interfere.
Harry shook his head. “Na, we’ll buy something. I plan to take him shopping and somewhere to eat.”
“Everyone knows they’re heroes. We didn’t know they were your godfathers,” Rey offered, “we didn’t mean any offence.”
“Where else was he to go?” A voice Harry couldn’t quite place asked.
“I’m sorry.”
Harry scoffed and rolled over, “Do you think they’ll be able to fix it? Should we pay for it?”
“Tawy wouldn’t have put you here if something hadn’t happened to you.” Mandy called out. “You might as well sit and spill.”
Harry shivered. “Me either, sometimes I can’t help it.”
Teddy nodded. “It’s for kids who are orphaned or abused. There’s at least one on every populated continent.”
They paused, and Draco quickly called out. “We forgot our journals. We were going to go get them first.” Draco was not looking forward to hashing out whatever it was Tawy wanted to dig out of him and could only imagine Harry felt the same way as he nodded along to Draco’s words.
Hphphph
Harry nodded and handed him the joint. “Exactly.”
“I don’t understand, why did you defend me?” Draco didn’t sound angry just defeated and Harry hated the lack of fire.
Rey quickly handed over the knife, “ah yeah, sorry, here.”
“No, you are not.”
Another Healer stuck her graying head around the doorway, seeing them and Tawy’s come-in gesture, she moved swiftly into the room. “We don’t have a file of any kind for young Malfoy here, just what Madam Pomfrey has sent over.”
There was silence for several minutes, until a loud huff had everyone looking to Pansy Parkinson, who glared around her, “Really?” She questioned, she glanced to Blaise Zabini, who nodded towards the rest. She huffed again, “Well it’s obvious isn’t it? The Ministry told them, who else could say something and get this reaction from the Australian government.”
Ella giggled. “I’ve thought on how to go about it, being friendly. But it’s like having the royal bloody family in here, it is. All the celebrities you ever heard all about in the news, they’re entangled with. It’s so fantastic.”
“Did you ever play any muggle games when you were little? Maybe your friends knew some.” Boy had some talent in drawing, she watched him, teaching himself to size his lines.
“Merlin,” Draco exclaimed, “Potter, what is this stuff? It’s incredible.”
She nodded graciously, “Harry then, thank you for visiting with our Draco.”
Harry could barely hear the Healer speak for all the whispering going on around him. He looked at Hermione, who had a tight pursed look to her face and then to Ron, whose lips were tight with, well Harry wasn’t sure, but he didn’t look happy or vindicated by Malfoy’s pain. Harry didn’t know how he felt. He was maybe hurt for Malfoy or hurt about Malfoy. Harry wasn’t sure what he felt but it twisted in his gut.
“My mum’s addicted to potions.” Mandy announced with an ugly smirk.
Draco cleared his throat, “You see, we’re not who you think we are.”
Pansy shook her head, “It’s just none of us can imagine you ever calling that man da, he’s more of a ‘father’ type.”
“I think he’s worried that I’ll get kidnapped and they will know everything I know now.”
Draco threw himself over Severus, tears coursing down his cheeks. Harry thought that his heart was going to stop working just from seeing him like that.
At least this time, Harry wasn’t the only one who didn’t know what was going on. Parkinson, Zabini and his friends were all asking questions, demanding to know what this disease was. Snape was the first to speak, voice strangled.
They tried to take Nott too. It was pretty funny to see the faces of the Aurors (the ones that weren’t actually in the war and just came to take people away) when the entire DA began screaming bloody murder at them saying that if it weren’t for Theodore Nott they would all have been long dead before the Battle even began. Nott said that it was cool, the trials were made for that, weren’t they? He could spend some time in custody until the statements, it was not like he had amnesia and forgotten what his stupid tattoo meant. Harry would never forget Luna’s reaction...
“You offered, Potty. You can’t take it back.”
even though you used to be together?” Harry pulled a face, Sirius looked at him with sad eyes.
He looked down at the sink and there it was: a single flower petal covered in blood. He opened the tap and washed it so he could see it better.
His mouth was forming a little pout. Draco thought it was the cutest thing he ever saw. The flowers were so confused by the conversation that he didn’t even cough at the thought of Potter marring the she-weasel.
“No,” Harry and Luna say at the same time. Harry throws Luna a grateful glance, which she returns with an amused smile.
“Um, are we going to do anything…?”
“So?”
Harry gasps, and practically falls out of his chair in his endeavor to get to Draco. He scrambles, and by the time he’s standing cautiously next to the window, there are tears welling up in his eyes.
“You can leave the room!” he exclaims with shocked delight.
And Harry remembers the Hippogriffs. How they stared and bowed when they acknowledged someone. He remembers Dumbledore, and his insistence on proper names. Harry remembers, and he understands.
“Why did you tell Robards about Malfoy?! Wait and
But I cannot guarantee quality over time—because I rushed, I'm not too confident in this chapter I suppose.
So he really
Harry flinches again and green eyes meet grey. “Um…” He panics and looks to Luna, hoping for some kind of reassurance.
excited? Scared?
“Well, it seems like you’ve found something to do.” Luna gives him a small nod and a smile.
“Responsibility?!” Malfoy stands up. “You think
It’s times like these that fills Harry with a sense of nostalgia. He’s nostalgic for something he’s never had, and since he’s never had it, he also doesn’t know what it is. But it’s nostalgia all the same, and it’s nice, and it’s sad.
He spends seventh year haunting the halls of Hogwarts, watching the fruits of his labor blossom and spread its poison. And he lies to save Harry, Hermione, and Ron, and he panics even as flames threaten to catch him in the very same room where it all started.
Asking Draco questions does seem to have at least opened him up a bit more. He starts disappearing and fading less, and fires back a few questions of his own. Harry’s rants finally turn into proper conversations, and though it’s rather slow-paced with Malfoy’s letter-pointing, Harry waits patiently and answers back as fully as he can. They jump from potions to auror work to muggle literature, and it’s with a hidden delight that Harry realizes it’s the first time in a long while that he’s had a conversation without feeling frustrated or annoyed. Rather, Draco provides the curiosity he himself is lacking, and through mutual interests, they fill each other in with words and music and things that nurture the mind and comfort the soul.
Then in a sudden moment of epiphany, Harry gets it. If he can’t understand this Malfoy, then this Malfoy might as well be a stranger, or a—or an acquaintance. That’s right, an acquaintance. He’d treat and talk to this person like he would one of his co-workers: with just enough respect and detachment. And while something doesn’t quite sit right with treating Malfoy in such a way, the tension leaves Harry.
It’s a lot of if’s to pass through, and if Harry’s being honest, he doesn’t think it’s going to work. Because through it all, he knows himself. And if this past month taught him anything, it’s to pay more attention to himself above all else first. And he has. He’s learned and tried, and though he doesn’t dare to broach the subject, he knows somewhere in his soul that he’s changed.

, he’ll forget everything. And he’ll simply drag this one second out to another, and another, until he can’t anymore and he loses this rare feeling.
It drives him a little crazy, that Malfoy’s like this. That anything can be like this for that matter. It’s not a solid thing, and Harry’s never handled uncertainties well. And right now, Malfoy’s an uncertainty.
“A friend described it to me once,” she states simply. “Seemed nice with all the plants. We could never have all these plants in the Ravenclaw common room. It was bad for the books.”
“Mate, he’s

no less. And he’s frustrated and mad, because suddenly, this precious experience was just taken away from him and he can’t even do anything about it. He has no say, and there’s no control over the one thing he
The healer smiles at him and passes him a calming draught. Harry downs it, and slowly relaxes as the potion works its magic. He watches the healer go back to her work, waving more spells into place and getting Malfoy to drink an assortment of potions.
He blinks a few times to clear his vision, and when they finally focus, there’s a man looking with clear disgust down at him. Draco’s tied to a chair, and from his viewpoint, he observes the man best he can in the dim lighting.
But he knows his imagination and expectations don’t line up with reality, and when the more realistic Imaginary-Harry appears, Draco’s reminded of the impossibility of his wants. This Harry yells and screams at Draco, and he repeats
“No, no, it’s not… it’s not bad.” Harry scratches the back of his head.
the world and the world with Harry. He protects his place and the world gives him respect and places him on a pedestal that’s all too wobbly.
“Harry? Oh, I was wondering when you’d show up. C’mon in. Tea?” She turns around and walks back towards her kitchen.

fault. It is
Imaginary-Harry shakes his head. “Probably from Hogwarts though, since he remembers you and your friends.”
“Well, this has been a nice talk,” George yawns. “But it’s still early and we have to clean up and open shop, and… ugh.”
“Hey, hey. It’s ok, it’s ok. We’re here because well, I wanted to get you out of your house and figure out how to help. So I thought I’d take a look at the situation. Is that ok?”

explosives and potions. Not to mention our moat, pixies, snapping books, exploding quills, booby traps—”
“Home…? I…
More and more often, he starts finding himself in Luna’s kitchen when he needs a break from the world. The world that always needs him. Him as an auror and hero. Not him as Harry, just a broken and angry man who desperately wants it all the stop. Who wants to walk into the ministry and give Robards a piece of his—oh wait.
“I was at the office late for my report because the interns weren’t doing their jobs, and when I was trying to get a point across to one of them—”
“Unfortunately, we were not able to locate their headquarters. It seems the manor was simply a prison of sorts.”
Malfoy tilts his head and hums. “Hm, doing my own thing I suppose? Brewing potions and the like.”
* * *
“You can’t actually get rid of Dementors,” Eleven says. The woman rubs her temples. “You can only isolate them away from people and hope they disappear by themselves eventually. We have some of them kept in our department.”
“Harry! Harry, are you there?”
He turns to look back at Robards, and notices rather belatedly that everyone’s staring at him, waiting for him to speak. So he speaks.
“Noted,” Harry says.
“Woah, what happened?”
When Harry finally feels his feet hit solid ground, he turns around only to see his auror partner already set on obliviating and warding off muggles from the scene of crime. He had had his doubts at first about the man, but Victor Walker turned out to be a solid-good auror, even if he is younger and inexperienced. He does his work wordlessly and efficiently, and makes up for shortcomings with sharp observation and intuition. He rather gives off Luna-vibes, Harry muses, albeit not as dreamy or… crazy.
to tell Aaron that he really ought to gather more testimonials and proof before he tries to do anything
It’s not a week later that Harry walks into the auror office to a flurry of panicked activity and the lights on the wall blaring red. An attack, or assault maybe. Always the worst, because red means people are involved, and hurting people is the worst kind of crime someone can commit. Yet just as he’s about to question someone, the lights turn off and the panic subsides.
* * *
It's also like some kind of barrier has been breached and broken, once they both realize Draco can freely leave the room. The day after, Harry leaves the hospital promptly at 8 PM, and doesn't question it when he feels the fox still clinging to his shoulder. Draco lets himself fade as they approach the crowds exiting the hospital and around the nearby apparition point, but as soon as Harry's landed properly at Number 12 Grimmauld Place, the fox is back in full force, tail wagging in excitement.
Harry’s eyes snap up to Malfoy’s face, only to quickly glance away to avoid the stare.
“Yeah, we gotta get the aurors outa our hair and Hermione still has work. Talk to you guys later? Maybe meet up some time for dinner?”
can’t everything go nicely for once?
“Why the fuck are you here?” he blurts.
“Harry?”
Draco nods once.
“Yeah… thanks for telling me ’mione.”
Ik it's sorta bad to update so infrequently cuz ppl forget the plot etc etc but sometimes it's so hard to bring myself to write...
But just as Harry drinks the last dregs of his tea, Luna declares her cookies cool enough and goes to grab her cloak. Harry stands, thinking she’s about to leave on some business and he really can’t be intruding, despite all his unanswered questions.
“Luna wasn’t there.”
“Wait,” Harry suddenly asks, his first thought popping back into his head, “why are
And once he has his jacket, they apparate away.
“Yup. He’s quite tame now. Would you like to see him? He lives across town.”
* * *
Harry wakes to blinding light and refractions of tiny rainbows dancing across his squinted eyes. It’s never been this bright, and to say that Harry regrets getting rid of his horrid curtains is an understatement. But nothing stops the forces of nature, and when he’s finally rubbed his eyes open, it’s to the disorienting view of a misty paw batting at some floating strands of his hair.
“Yeah, I’m okay. I think.”
Draco paws at the surface and makes a few jabbing motions with his snout.
Ron comes in the morning as promised, and he leaves after dropping off some pastries, a supply of coffee, and a trunk no doubt Kreacher packed. He rifles through it and is glad—and amazed—to see practically his entire wardrobe stuffed in it. He’s not sure he’ll even be staying long enough to get through all his clothes, but he guesses it’s better to be prepared—which reminds him that he’ll probably have to send in another notice of leave later.
And now here he is at St. Mungo’s, two days later, and he can’t care less about Hermione’s invitation to dinner. Because surely he would be able to see Malfoy by now? He still doesn’t know why exactly he needs to see Malfoy, and he tells the receptionist as much. But that seems to be the wrong answer as she then refuses to give out any more information. At his continuous prodding, she only gives him a noteworthy death glare, and tersely announces that “It’s a matter of privacy, sir.”
“Luna? What—”
Harry’s honestly a little hurt by the whole thing. He knows he probably shouldn’t be taking this personally, but he’s really trying right now, and it’s a bit frustrating when that sentiment isn’t being shared.
Because Malfoy
Another cold tingle as Draco swipes at him.
“It’s god damn six right now, Harry! Six! Merlin’s balls do you know how worried we were? I went to Grimmauld to check up on you during my lunch break only for Kreacher to tell me you’ve never even gone back! Were you here the whole time? Have you even had any food? What gives?”
But he turns and suddenly there’s a wall full of vials. All of them containing that shimmering silver liquid he recognizes to be memories. And all of a sudden Harry’s a bit creeped out. Because while it’s totally normal and common for people to have a brewery in their house, and less common yet still totally socially acceptable to have a professional brewery, it’s
And if Harry isn’t the antagonist anymore then someone would have taken his place. Someone the world is against and is forced to fight against it with every last breath of their being, just like how Harry had. And that someone is Malfoy now, and Harry finally understands why Malfoy was so mad, so hurt, so frustrated.
Then suddenly, a thought hits him. Why is he crying over Malfoy at all in the first place? Why is it Malfoy? Would he cry in the same way over Hermione? Ron? Luna? Ginny? Hadn’t he decided what he has is enough? Just him and his friends and family? So who is this
Harry sighs and gestures at the water barrier. “It started raining and I couldn’t just leave and let the house flood!”
He cries.
He doesn’t think past that though, because his gasp draws Malfoy’s attention, and the fox turns to look at him. He solidifies fully this time, and then the fox is staring down at Harry’s hands. At his own hands. At their
Then he sees the flash of silver from his peripheral, and the fox is there, sitting on the bed staring up at him. Harry holds his breath. But still, the fox sits and stares, and when it finally lets out a silent huff, Harry gets it.
Thirty-nine eventually stops in front of a door somewhere deep within the compound. Harry’s pretty lost by now, and he figures he should have mapped out where they walked. The hallway they’re currently standing in is pristine and all-white, and it’s the brightest and cleanest place Harry has seen, ever. A window at the end of the hallway lets in light that only makes the place brighter, and the quiet is a sharp contrast to the bustle and noise of the rest of the building. This must be what heaven is like, Harry thinks absentmindedly.
It’s just not enough. It’s not fast enough. He needs to be in control. He needs other people to take him seriously. For
“How can it be any more quiet than, well, being human?”
So he’ll help, Harry decides. He’ll help with Malfoy’s reconstruction while he’s gone. He’ll watch over his home, his dream, and keep it safe and alive until Malfoy himself can come back to claim it. He’ll protect it.
“Thank you.”
no one else to turn to. So the anger and fear keep piling up and he knows that one day, it’ll break the glass road he calls “a life.”
Harry finally goes to sleep early in the morning, and when he waves a tempus, it’s 3 AM. He collapses into his sleeping bag and falls into a dreamless sleep.
Malfoy closes his mouth and shakes his head lightly. “No, she went on a spontaneous expedition through Brazil. I’m watching her plants—and house.”
It’s always
He’s selfish really. Harry knows. To want someone back for forgiveness, for understanding. But it’s enough for now, he thinks. It’s enough.
* * *
* * *
He takes his time sitting up—takes in the room, the windows, and his friends at his side. He roves over Luna’s form in the corner, further over, and right at his feet—Harry sees a deer for the first time in years.
“Well nothing to be done about that now, mate!” Ron jumps into the conversation and just as soon passes out on the floor.
fault Malfoy’s all
Draco thinks back to all the times he’d acted arrogant and a bully. Just to keep himself safe, away from the Dark Lord’s suspicion and the possible rejection of his friends. Was it worth it? Was it worth it, keeping himself alive at the cost of his love? Once upon a time, he would have answered, yes, it was worth it. Anything to keep himself alive. But the war’s over, now that he thinks about it properly, and what’s stopping him?
“Listen Potter. While Mr. Malfoy is under isolation at St. Mungo’s, you will see him with the

can see him except the healers. The aurors who got him out aren’t even allowed to talk to him. So calm down, they won’t let you talk to him either. Give it a few days maybe.”
s and “I’m fine.” Because he can’t tell Draco when Draco himself doesn’t seem to be aware of what’s happening. So he worries and wallows alone.
Robards breaks out in sudden laughter. “Snape? Severus Snape? And Umbridge? Oh merlin, what an image! This is the best thing to happen to me all week,” he gasps.
Well that was a rather blunt way to get straight to the point. Harry walks forward to sit down in the chair next to Thirty-nine, and as soon as he settles, he can’t move.
“I’m not mad this time, I swear.”
Draco pauses to let Harry take that in. And when Harry finally nods, Draco continues.
“Um…”
Harry glares daggers at Ron. For a while, no one speaks. Then Harry lowers his head back to his tea. “I swear to god you’re becoming more like Hermione every time I see you,” he mumbles.
With his own mug in hand, Ron sits down across from him, and for a moment, there’s no sound except for the quiet sipping and muffled noise from the store below.
With everyone introduced, the meeting progresses. They go over the finer details of Malfoy’s case, including the chase and tip-off that led to his finding. It’s new but already summarized by Robards. Then they move on to the newer findings and Harry sits up straighter.
Harry pauses. Well nothing was going according to his plan so far, so he might as well improvise. “Yeah, uh, sure. Thanks.”
“Hey, Harry, isn’t yours a stag?”
* * *
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s a prolonged pause as Malfoy looks Harry up and down. Suddenly self-conscious, Harry regrets rushing out of Ron and Hermione’s house right after breakfast. He knows his hair is still a mess—a birdnest, as Ron calls it—and he’s still wearing the t-shirt and sweatpants he wore to sleep. At least he also has the hoodie Hermione had thrown at him as he left. He will have to thank her later.
Night turns to day, and as always, the moon leaves the stage to the sun. Sleep relinquishes its hold, and Harry wakes. Another day, another life; to start and live as he pleases.
But nothing lasts, and just as he’s beginning to think that he’s safe, his home is blasted open and he’s cruelly burned again and left to die in a place at the edge of the world. But it’s okay. He lived. He’s alive and well, and as long as that’s that, he can fix it. He will fix it. He’ll put the pieces together as lovingly as the first time, and it will all be fine. He has Luna and he has his home. It’ll be okay.
Harry sputters and almost spits his tea out. “I don’t—wait—”
“Well,” Thirty-nine stands and stretches. “I need to get back to the Ministry. You can stay for as long as the healers allow. If you find anything, shoot me a message.”
“I—I’m sorry,” he says quickly. “Hermione told me I had to get your permission and everything but you were
The man sneers. “Remember me, Malfoy?”
He skirts along the edges of the rooms and hallways, but he’s sure that the people he passes all stare, because, well one, he
He really shouldn’t be surprised. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Harry counts back the years and months from the trials and knows this is around the time Malfoy would be let off probation. He’s probably here for paperwork or something, his rational side supplies. And yet...
Anyways, hope u all enjoy this chapter and stay safe and healthy ppl!
Harry shakes his head.

“I’m serious here, okay? I don’t care what you do once Malfoy’s… cured and out of the hospital, but while he’s in there, you are not to do anything rash or uncalled for. Do you understand?”
For four days, Harry doesn’t see Draco. For four days, he doesn’t see so much as a wisp or whiff of mist. He spends each day by Draco’s body, fingers clasped and staring off with red eyes that has Draco’s healers worrying for
* * *
Luna’s whips around to stare at him, and the sudden movement startles him into almost rolling off again. “Harry.” A sigh. “You can’t do that.”
He feels a bit guilty, now that he thinks about it. Should he have asked? He knows some people find comfort in telling others. And if Harry had known something, anything, perhaps he could have made it a bit better. Even if it was just a little.
“Ugh, fuck you. Is your brain messed up or something now? Dark lord drive you crazy? Well either way, I’ll get straight to the point.”
* * *
Ron shrugs, but mid-movement, Harry’s vision turns white. And when he
He thinks that normally, he never really has any problem with small talk and starting conversations. But this is
“Yes, I’m not.”
Harry’s never once regretted joining the magical world. Instead, he immerses himself fully in it, taking advantage of his magic and this new escape. He had used magic as often as he could, especially after first leaving the Dursleys and then after the war. It’s gotten to the point where he can’t understand why Hermione sorts her library by hand, why Ron brews his tea without magic, why Luna makes her absurd amount of baked goods and ends up with flour all over her hands and face.
“I’m—” Harry starts. Then he pauses. The fox is staring expectantly.
He then spends the rest of the morning flipping meticulously through Malfoy’s notes, making his own notes in a separate journal. He would’ve just written in the margins of Malfoy’s, but he feels guilty enough for snooping as it is, and doing so would be a level of intimacy that thinly borders intrusion. Yet the more he reads through the journal, the more Harry’s amazed at the level of detail. There’s so much information—and extra history—that Harry doubts he’ll even have to do more research on his own.
there’s no more water coming in. He stares at his water barrier in panicked satisfaction for a while before looking back at the room.
“Potter!”
“Ah yes, we did get sidetracked. Harry, have you seen the news this morning?”

Just fixing the discrepancies in tense for all my verbs was a struggle rip
“Fuck, fine be that way prick.” The man walks over and kicks his chair so that it skids back with a screech. Draco winces at the sound.
“It’s enough,” she says. “You being here is enough.”
“And it’s totally fine if we get lost. We have plenty of time—hey, don’t give me that look, I took a day off work—so we can wander the whole village until we find it, and that’s ok.”
“How is that my problem?”
“I didn’t kiss anyone, you know that. Unless you are counting that lame attempt in fourth year.”
A woman’s voice, but it was not his mother’s. He raised his eyes to look at  whoever said those words and found a

“Lower your bloody voice.” He hissed. “And
He sighed tiredly and kissed Harry’s belly again before crawling back to lay next to him, knowing that it wouldn’t be long until Albus came running to their bed.
"Why don't they just kiss? They are obviously into each other." Draco whispered so only the green-eyed boy could hear.
He heard someone running down the hallway, the door being slammed open.
When he turned to look at him for a moment, he saw him blushing and still polishing that damn cup.
Draco didn’t bother to answer, he just moved to start tracing his jaw with soft kisses. A moan escaped from Harry’s mouth.

Harry was sleeping when he started getting pecked by the owl. He put on his glasses and recognised Arcturus. His heart sank. This could not be good news. He quickly checked his watch. 3 AM. He sat up and untied the letter.
Draco nodded.
"Draco.. Look at me."
Draco's eyes widened.
"Why even bother after I tried, Pansy dear?" Blaise asked, raising his eyebrows.
"One reason you said?"
"Er.."
Hermione looked him in the eye.
"Here."
She rolled her eyes.
Harry took his hand and pulled him into an empty corridor.
"Are you daft, Pans? He can't write back to me! Don't you think it'll be suspicious for my parents if my supposed enemy is suddenly writing to me? Especially now when.. when He has returned." Draco uttered with his fork hanging near his mouth. He put it down. He'd lost his appetitite.
"Let's see how brilliant your Transfiguration skills are then, Draco?"
“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked.
"Sorry.. I'm not feeling well.. I want to be alone, I'll- I'll eat in the kitchens." he said, glaring at Pansy Parkinson who's arm was around Draco's shoulder.
It was at precisely 7:46 PM when Arcturus returned.
Harry took his hand and they walked out the shop with Molly.
But the Death Eaters did not strike.
"I don't care, Draco, I can't just sit in Hogwarts while.."
They looked at each other for a long moment. Harry wanted to run away.
"Hello, Arcturus. I guess you'll have to stay a few minutes while I write a reply to your owner." he said to the owl who hooted in reply and went back to his treats.
“What are nargles?”
"Fuck off, you
"I'll tell you later, okay? I just need to go to Snape's office, right now."
Harry raised his eyebrows.
"Because of.." Draco repeated.
Harry glanced over the bed.
"But it's not the same!" Draco whined. "We won't be alone and you Gryffindors are so bloody noisy and messy! Not to mention they all hate me."
"Er.. I got lucky?"
"Potter?"
"I believe I need some more persuasion." said Draco, dazed.
"At any rate, Mr. Malfoy needs to get out of his house, the rest we can manage." Dumbledore said.
"I knew she was dodgy. She was at my trial, you know?"
Harry shifted slightly to give Draco space to settle in the armchair with him.
"You're an idiot at time, Malfoy."
"You can still come here with me.. Our relationship isn't a secret, anymore, Dray."
"That's the entire, problem, isn't it?"
What is he doing? The plan was to just give a small peck to Malfoy's lips to shock him and shut him up. Why is he still kissing him? And why is he enjoying it so much? He needs to snap out of it!
He glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf.
He wanted to cry but he wouldn't. He wouldn't cry for Draco Malfoy. The boy who had tormented him for 3 years and now had stolen his bloody heart.
"That bad?"
"What did she make you write?" he asked, curiously.
"Oh, Harry.."
He couldn't go to Draco like this.. He would ask why his hand is bleeding. What would Harry tell him? He would be furious..
"Malfoy!"
"I'm fine, 'Mione."
"Yeah, it is my dorm." Ron replied, rolling his eyes.
"Didn't you?"
“They’ve found Montague, sir. He’s turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor.”
"Mhm."
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. He seemed to be thinking for few minutes and paused his hand in Draco's hair but resumed when Draco shuffled his head.
"HARRY!"
He grabbed Harry's arm and pulled him along.
Before Harry could open his mouth, Luna replied, "I think they've been for a while."
"You know me so well." Draco said, settling down on a couch. "So? Aren't you two gonna tell me how you finally got together?"
"Yeah.." replied Draco, blushing harder.
"Yeah, I didn't expect it.."
"Hullo, Arcturus.." Harry said, petting the owl.
Harry turns around and walks away, fully ignoring the screaming audience.
Harry scowled but plopped down on the bed where she'd put the tray of food. She left when she was satisfied Harry would finish lunch.
He was at Hogsmeade. Alone since Draco wouldn't come but was also whining about not having any chocolate left.
"Good."
"Harry, mum was- AHHH!" came Ron's voice when he saw the two of them kissing. They both bolted away from each other.
"I can't, Harry.."
Harry groaned. What was Draco playing at?
"When did I ask you to?"
"You said, and I quote, 'I'm hopelessly in love with Harry Potter'.. Did you not realise..?"
Everyone else stood there, frozen in shock.
"Sure."
"I suppose I can."
"Mhm, why don't you tell me more about those things.. in the old transfiguration classroom?"
"Thank you, Pinky. I'll make sure he eats it." said Pansy, dismissing Pinky.
"Hmm?"
Hermione rolled his eyes.
"Anyway.. Was someone in here?" asked Ginny.
Harry rubbed his eyes.
"What's wrong?"
"I only disliked his favouritism towards you but seeing as I don't.. dislike you anymore..  I'm not sure I ever did dislike you, though.." he said, wandering off into his thoughts.
Harry frowned in confusion. He looked at Pansy who was looking to the floor.
"What the actual fuck, Hermione?! And you believed them?!"
"Harry.. Do you think Theo..?"
Cho waved her wand and murmured a "Finite" and suddenly she was Draco Malfoy.
"But.. Malfoy.. Hermione, how can you just forget all the things he-"
"Were you talking to yourself? And where's Cho?" she asked looking straight at where Draco was standing. Perspiration ran down Harry's forehead.
"NO?!"
He frowned. Had he said something wrong? Why hadn't Harry written back? Was Harry okay? Draco was filled with worry.
Harry sighed and plopped down in the armchair.
More tears were falling from her eyes. Merlin, Harry felt so guilty. Why did she have to try to kiss him like that?!
"Are you alright?" Draco asked, sitting beside him.
Harry frowned.
"Okay, okay." said Harry and sat up.
"She's your mother.. I'm sure she would've respected your decision." Harry replied.
He walked over to the table, still feeling as if it were all surreal.
"No, you don't understand! He.. He sent me a letter!"
"Have you seen this? It's got your name on it.."
Draco glared at him.
"That was at 5:00pm!"
Draco smiled.
Then, Harry regains his composure and adjusts his tie. He looks Malfoy right in the eyes and winks. Malfoy gets impossibly more red.
"I, Draco Malfoy, am in love with Harry Potter. It's him I've been seeing since last year. It's him I'm with, every fucking night and it's him that's in there with bloody Umbridge, Dumbledore and the sodding Minister while I'm uselessly strutting out here!"
Draco snatched the book back and scanned the page. Oh dear.
"W-what? No! Gross!" Draco replied.
"Harry, I'm sure it was just a nightmare-"
"Ron was really curious about how I've been doing my homework on time, nowadays.. And Hermione was looking at me weirdly.. Like she knew something."
"Are you and Potter involved together?" he asked, looking disgusted by just the idea of it.
"Back to Potter, am I?" Harry replied, rubbing his eyes.
"What's on your mind, Harry?"
"Merlin's balls.. You.. You did this?"
They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight. There was nobody there at all. All was echoing, dusty silence.
"Oh, Harry, you can cry. Holding it in would only make it worse."
But Harry wasn't listening, his eyes were on the door.
Harry frowned.
Draco opened his eyes and felt a pang of hurt.
"Er.. I'm sorry." Draco said.
"Oh shut it, Potter. I always barge into your compartment to insult you and your friends, nothing new to see, here. And Pansy's standing guard outside."
"Potter. You came out to Cho Chang. I'm sure you can come out to Weasel and Granger."
“Er.. It’s probably full of nargles, though.”
He let the owl in, took his letter and gave the owl some treats.
"Er.."
"Wouldn't be me if I weren't." he said, pulling Harry on top of him on their bed and kissing him.
"Really, Draco? I thought we were friends but I guess you think I'm also another minion of yours like Crabbe and Goyle." Blaise said, enraged.
"Old Transfiguration classroom at midnight, be there."
"Well, if I wasn't so infuriating, how'd you have noticed me?" said Harry, innocently batting his eyelashes.
“Ninety-seven!” whispered Hermione.
"Sorry."
Harry pursed his lips, trying hard to control his laughter. However, his body was still shaking from the laughter, infuriating Draco to no end.
"Well, at least someone has a healthy and happy relationship.. Blaise and Theo have been fighting since the beginning of the year! At first, it was just ridiculous banter then it got serious then there accusations of hiding things and cheating and-"
He shrugged.
"We hung out like three days, ago, Pans."
"Can you at least stop playing with my feelings if you can't be with me? One moment you're here kissing me as though your life depends on it, the next you're gone, sitting in Parkinson's arms.. It hurts, Draco. Just.. Just leave me alone or be mine."
"Potter!" was the only voice he heard as his body slammed onto the table.
"But Voldemort might."
"Well.. at the volume.. you're yelling.. Filch is bound to-"
Harry looked at Draco.
"Draco is not his father, Ron." Harry said, quietly.
"Er yeah."
Draco frowned.
"Malfoy?" said Ginny.
"What's the matter?" Harry asked, cupping his face.
"Oh, I never said they were a girl, Draco. I know you more than you know yourself. So.. Who's the boy?"
"Serves you right for scarring us with the horrible snogging - if it can even be called that - you do with your Lav-Lav." said Ginny, settling down beside Hermione who was smirking.
"Oh, don't look so surprised, Draco, you were after all the one who told me Theo fancied Blaise back in third year." Pansy interjected.
"We can't, Potter. If I'd met you in another lifetime.."
"Sorry."
Harry nodded.
"What?" said Harry, gobsmacked.
"Let's go to breakfast before Pansy gets mad." he replied.
"Draco?"
"Me? Why would you need my help?" he asked, surprised at Draco's request. He finally shifted his attention from the trophy to Draco who was fidgeting with his robes.
"I also happen to quite love this book."
Harry let go of his hand.
The day after the party, the Daily Prophet was plastered with theories about Draco's and Harry's relationship. The front page had the headline:
Draco looked at him as if he was crazy.
"I FUCKING HATE YOU, POTTER!" yelled Draco, getting up.
Blaise snorted and plopped down on his bed.
"I asked you a question." he said, folding his arms and leaning on the desk behind him for support.
"He's sleeping, then?" Hermione asked, seeing Harry's bed curtains drawn.
"Why are you pacing in front of a wall, Potter? Have you finally lost it?"
Pansy shook her head.
"You know what I mean." replied Draco, rolling his eyes.
"No need to thank me, Harry. If anyone wants to join the right side, who are we to stop them?" Dumbledore replied, his eyes twinkling.
"Alright then, Harry."
Harry gave a dangerous smile.
“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively, but he did not want to respond. His mouth was very dry now.
“How she got to be a prefect when she’s thicker than a concussed troll . . .” she grumbled.
"Shut up, Gin."
"Why are you in.. bed? with.. I.."
"Draco, it's useless, it's gonna scar anyway." Harry said trying to pull his hand back but Draco held it tightly.
"So er.. Does that mean we're not sleeping together, tonight?" Harry asked and Ron coughed, loudly.
"Well.. That was certainly unexpected but you must leave, now." Dumbledore said and Harry nodded, not letting go of Draco's hand. "Take this Portkey."
"GIVE ME ONE SODDING REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T BLOODY HAND YOU TO FILCH FOR BEING OUT AFTER CURFEW AND GIVE YOU DETENTION FOR ALMOST KILLING ME BY SCARING ME TO DEATH!"
"Huh?"
He thought Parkinson must be quite clever if she'd discovered the nature of Harry and Draco's.. well.. relationship by her own.. But, of course, he wasn't going to tell that to Hermione. He did feel a little guilty about it. Draco's best friend knew about them and he hadn't told his best friends anything.. But how could he tell them?
He didn't know when Harry had grabbed his hand but he realised it when it was being squeezed so tight it started hurting.
"No, no.. You look beautiful."
"So, it's serious, then?"
"A cute little pet for my cute little boyfriend." Harry replied, putting the pygmy puff on the bed.
"Oh." Draco reddened. "I think the word you're looking for is handsome, Potter." he said, biting his lip.
"You're a prefect?"
And.. I'll leave what happened in the Prefect's bathroom to your imagination 🙈🙊
"I don't know.."
"Well.. She was crying.. And besides.. I didn't even want to kiss her."
