“I want you walking funny in the morning,” I said, dipping my head to catch Potter’s mouth in another kiss. Potter smiled against my lips and released a shaky little puff of air, thumb still moving over my leaking slit as we crossed through my living quarters to my bedroom. I jerked helplessly at the touch of his fingers and fumbled with the clasps of his robes. It took me a few moments, but I finally got them open just as Potter released his grip on me and flattened his palm over my racing heart to push me away. The backs of my thighs hit my mattress and I tumbled backwards to the sound of Potter’s laugh. His face was alight, and he whipped off his glasses and tossed them onto one of my pillows, then stripped off his trainers and socks. I struggled onto my elbows to watch — hate sex, as far as I was aware, was generally a one-time thing, and this would likely feed my wank-bank for years if I paid attention — and held my breath as Potter met my gaze and continued disrobing. He slipped his robes from his shoulders, the material bunching, then let them slide off him, one arm at a time.
“I don’t want to,” Harry said. “I love you too.”
“Okay,” Harry says, firmer this time. “Yeah. Just— wait a second.” He lifts his injured hand to his mouth. Raises his eyes to the ceiling. Then, with a shaky breath, he bites down on the loose leather over the pinky finger of his glove, and slowly tugs it from his hand with his teeth. His body flashes hot, then cold, as he drops the glove.
“Here,” Potter said. He unwrapped the scarf around his neck — perhaps a Christmas gift; it looked new, knit in a rich burgundy that brought out his eyes — and ruffled the snow from his hair with one gloved hand. “It’s cold outside.”
~ ~ ~
Looking at me, Potter unbuttoned his jeans and flipped up the hem of his t-shirt. He rubbed his knuckles over the line of hair that trailed into his jeans. He was fitter than he looked with his robes on, his stomach taut and narrowing to a defined v at his pelvis, his belly button an imperfect, mostly flat circle that made me swallow back a flood of saliva. It was a secret weakness of mine, a gorgeous belly button above a dark feathering of hair, and Potter’s lips quirked like he knew it. I gritted my teeth and Potter’s grin renewed; he tugged his t-shirt over his head and dropped it to the ground, then covered the bulge in his jeans with one hand. He gripped his cock. Stroked over it.
your cock is, but we can’t really do it from opposite sides of the room, can we?”
coming, and his face was frozen too, gaze trained on something to the side.
But saying any of that would be an insult to the mercy Draco had just shown, so Harry simply found his glasses in the mess of Draco’s bed, and did as asked.
“Yes, well— to you, too, Ms Granger.” Barnaby smiled at her warmly. “I can’t tell you how— unpleasant this has been for our offices. The joining of two people who are opposed to a match is not, I think, what my ancestors had in mind when they lent their magics to such unions.” He nodded to the contracts, then reached into the satchel resting at his feet and drew out something else: The original Potter/Malfoy scroll. Harry’s heart skipped a beat, and Barnaby said, “Let me simply go over a few items and we can see about issuing an addendum.”
“Not that.”
“Mmm. Ta, Potter.”
Harry thought ‘happy’ to be a relative term. Yet he wasn’t
Then Harry mounts him, and works his cock into him. Every part of Harry’s body shakes with arousal but he takes it slow, bringing Draco to the brink again and again. Draco’s knees are pressed up to his chest, his hands are pressed into the mattress; his fingers are laced through Harry’s own. And when Draco finally comes in long spurts between them, body clamping tight around Harry, his eyes are glassy and they look like stars.
Harry adds a finger, two, three. Twists them in your slick, your inner-muscles clinging around them. He laps over your rim, your seam, your bollocks. Sucks them into his mouth one at a time. Covers his teeth and hollows his cheeks, pulling, a different sort of massage. You think you should perhaps be mortified by the new gush of warm wet around Harry's fingers, but you're not.
Twice before, Robards had put off retiring when certain members of the Wizengamot had made it plain that, no matter Harry’s accomplishments to date, they had no intention of promoting someone barely into their twenties to the position of Head Auror. Trying not to take issue with their reasoning — or the extra work Robards piled on him to make a point of his capabilities — Harry’d not made a single complaint as his twenty-third and twenty-fourth birthdays ticked by. But with every successfully closed case since, Robards had assured him that by his twenty-fifth he’d have his promotion.
“He thinks he is,” Draco said. The slender line of his lips was downturned. “But he’s a good friend when he forgets to pine. Is that what he was telling you?”
Harry shudders; his gaze drops to Draco’s lips. Draco tilts his head, unaroused yet more than willing, mind wiped so clean of petty concerns like doubt and pride, he doesn't know how he held onto them for so long. Draco relaxes. Makes himself pliant. Harry's free hand slides to his hip, clenches there once, tight and reflexive, his eyes still on Draco's mouth, and then Harry tears himself away.
“More like been subjected to it,” Harry said. “The women in your life insist on telling me.” Draco sucked his lips between his teeth as though trying not to laugh, and Harry huffed. “I thought it might be smart to prepare myself for the next one. Though I doubt the ‘romantic’ bit.”
Marital relations had been lovely with him from the start, but in the years since they’d been wed, it had never been like that — she hadn’t
enough like her that Draco’s knees go weak. “What—? Why—?” He can’t think what to ask; he feels slow. Stupid. “Is Father with you?”
Malfoy collapses into Harry’s arms, his head sagging on Harry’s shoulder. But he’s breathing, and the horror on his face has been chased away by the slack of unconsciousness. Harry taps his cheek lightly with one palm and sighs when Malfoy’s only movement is a brief fluttering of his lashes. He doesn’t stir, and when Harry lifts him up, he understands why: Malfoy is light as a feather, his muscle and fat stores depleted after who knows how long he’s spent starving in here. He places Malfoy on the bed, a new flicker of unease rippling through him.
thank you,” Draco snaps, and Harry’s smile grows a fraction.
, and had been stupid of Harry to think otherwise.
Potter lifted his head, his eyes narrowing a little. But he only said, “It’s not fine, though. Not really. You made a good point; there’s a reason locking charms prevent the techs from leaving their labs right after a mishap. You were just doing your job and you’re the best consultant we have, and we’re friends,” he blurted, earnest enough to make Draco blink. “I shouldn’t have shouted at you.”
“That good enough?” Malfoy asks, panting. His forehead feels sweaty against Harry’s nape.
Harry,” he added quietly when Harry stumbled, “—and they’ll find something else of interest soon enough.”
— when the curtains at the back of the room rustled, and—
“But this is great!” Ron said with renewed enthusiasm. “We’ll get you fixed up right and proper; maybe the Wizengamot will be able to appreciate everything you do when you’re not at their beck.”
“Now wait just a minute, Malfoy—” Ron stepped forward, hands fisted, and Bill caught his arm.
Calmly fitting a bookmark between the pages, Narcissa closes the book and sets it aside. She folds her hands in her lap and regards Hermione wordlessly, an expectant eyebrow arching. Hermione wonders if a lack of soul is the reason Narcissa’s face remains so unlined at her age. It seems appallingly unfair that a woman who’s been witness to and responsible for so many atrocities should remain beautiful, when the last time Hermione saw Harry, she’d noticed he already had a few gray hairs hidden in the curls at his nape.
It didn’t anymore.
They stared at each other, the shock spiking through Harry comically reflected on Malfoy’s face for the barest of moments. There was a room-length between them, but Malfoy looked mostly as he had the last time Harry’d seen him, tall and lanky and pale as snow, only now his eyes were clear and his complexion healthy — and he wasn’t swaying on his feet.
. Kissing Harry’s lips swollen under the drizzling shelter of the hawthorn tree’s boughs, and slipping Harry’s dressing robe open with one hand:
Ten minutes later, he was bending Draco over one arm of his sofa and fucking him within an inch of his life.

Overwhelms hawthorn wands.
talk about them, Harry! These are magically binding contracts, and I wouldn’t break them even if I could! Every citizen should have —
“I want him,” Harry said bluntly.
“I thought… I thought the scarf first, perhaps. It’s been cold,” Draco said, licking his lips. He looked at the scarf. It was in ghastly tones of yellow and red, but was made of a thick, soft wool.
“Yes,” he says, giving in. He slides the glove back on and stores his wand in his pocket. “Later.”
“Harry,” Draco said. The sheer amount of
“We… No.” Granger’s breath hitches with a tiny, disbelieving gasp. “Oh, Merlin.
“Hermione!” Ron said, but Hermione looked at Harry steadily, waiting. Expectant.
“What?” I forced my neck to work and looked at him.
Harry stroked over the shape of Draco’s cock. “Kinky.”
Whatever. It didn’t matter to
* * *
“You’re welcome.”
How long had he been on the cusp? Before, it felt like, that first kiss in the parlour. But Harry was stalled by some grand design, or desire, wanting to live in the feeling, right there but not tipped over. The place where he could plunge into Draco again and again, his cock aching, on the verge, surrounded by so much heat. Where he could touch Draco’s face, and breathe in Draco’s gasps — where he could splay his hand across Draco’s throat to feel his pulse, and get a veiled look, Draco allowing his hand to rest there, unthreatened by its presence. Where Draco was turned on by it, his breath speeding up, hips rising to meet the snap of Harry’s, a timely beat.
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose, almost wishing for a headache. At least it’d give him some excuse for the way he can’t seem to make himself
“What is it? What’s wrong?”
lube, goddammit.”
Harry rolls his forehead against the wall. "I've got to—” He stops, his eyes fluttering shut. He blows out a breath, straightens, and opens his eyes. “I've got to go.”
of his life, seeing his wasted frame and those ropy scars on his torso, hearing him panic in his sleep— it makes Harry remember what feeling things is like, and he wants to turn it off again.
“No, he didn’t— tell me.” Harry swallowed, the reminder sour in his throat. It was inconceivable that Draco couldn’t see the depth of authenticity to Theo’s feelings, or didn’t know how to believe them. Harry wished he hadn’t said anything. He tensed his thighs around Draco’s hand. “Who was the fourth?”
“What have you got, the last few days?”
“Harry.”
Potter’s mouth twitched indecisively, somewhere between a smile and a frown. “Not… Not really,” he said hesitantly. He skimmed his wand down the buttons of his cloak and stripped it off when they came undone, then pulled off his gloves, tossing the items on top of his trunk. “But it was good. We’re going back day after tomorrow, for lunch.”
Harry laughs, a dry, unamused sound. He rubs the back of his neck. “You know what it is.”
, blue maybe, no, dark, or purple, there were so many— I don’t
He translates everything again, and it comes out the same. Hermione needs him to get Draco Malfoy. Put together with the rest, it's even more jarring:
Draco's jaw bunches, his eyes going bright. Harry pushes away the ever-present haunt of ghosts and lets his mind go, lets himself feel Draco surrounding him. He doesn’t need anything more. He jostles Draco’s hips and Draco closes his eyes. He starts to move, riding Harry’s cock with exquisite skill that has Harry’s chest heaving, pleasure racing up and down his spine with every pump. He clenches his arse, fucking up into Draco slow and steady, the way Draco wants, and at some point the ache between them bleeds away into something sharper, more focused.
But Malfoy didn’t comment and this time didn’t laugh; he merely tightened his hand to do as Harry bid, clenching around Harry’s glans, twisting his fist with agonising skill over Harry’s shaft and matching the pace with his hips. He mouthed over the curve of Harry’s neck, tongue leaving cool wet trails that broke chills over Harry’s skin, and he murmured, “
, and in the tenderness of that, felt Draco’s shudders start. Draco’s arse convulsed around Harry’s cock as he came, a spread of warm wet spilling between them. First, he was coming first, the rhythmic spasm of his inner-muscles milking Harry’s cock.
“Because that’s something I’m allowed to do, is it?” Malfoy said, the shiver of a clench to his jawline. He lifted his gaze from the cherries strewn across the ground and stood, a hard cast to his face as he prowled up to Harry, every apex predator Harry had learned about in primary school, all of those he’d fought growing up at Hogwarts. He stopped a hair’s breadth away — jabbed Harry’s chest with one finger. “No, it
“True.” Malfoy gave him a flat look, and the pit in Harry’s stomach grew. Lurched.
“Draco, I don’t need to be good at Legilimency to know you like Potter. I wouldn’t even have to be particularly bright,” she said, wheezing a little. “You can barely go an hour without mentioning him.”
supposed to be comforting
And Harry does — finding out, in the process, that it’s possible to climax with a laugh falling from your throat. Finding out, in the process, that love can live somewhere like that, too.
“How was it?”
Malfoy’s face was close, his eyes glittering at Harry from inches away, his breath tea-sweet. As Harry watched, Malfoy’s smirk faded, his expression transforming into one Harry had only seen a few times before — unguarded and warm and pink-tinged — and never out in the open, as they were.
Later, Harry would wonder if Malfoy regretted that first, surprised mutter after three days of hard-pointed silence. Later, Harry would wonder about his own lack of regret over looking up when he heard Malfoy’s voice. But that would come after everything had already happened, the way events always seemed to, when even a Time-Turner couldn’t change things. The shape of a path, as Harry knew very well by then, once walked, was a lot like a paper crane — unfolded and pressed flat, you could try to fashion it into something different, but the original creases would always remain.
“Malfoy?” Harry asked, following Kreacher’s eyes to the door. “Is he okay?”
~ ~ ~
She’s been like that from the start, her brogue severe when Hermione protested her own place there —
“Do you expect me to disagree? Pride has been the downfall of man since the beginning of time,” Narcissa says, disregarding that. “In one way or another. Some are sunk by their own hubris; others are sunk by attaching theirs to someone else’s. As was the case for Lucius, forced daily to live in a reality where the man to whom he had pledged himself had become twisted by his own madness.”
Harry cracked a laugh. Shrugged. “I’ll show up on Wednesday for the lessons, I swear. This week has been worse than usual; about a year’s worth of reports had been misfiled at the beginning of ‘98, when Voldemort was—” He stopped at Malfoy’s quickly-drawn breath. “We discovered them last Saturday, and I had to track down the original sources and refile them on top of the rest of my work. But I finished the last of them today, so I should be able to—”
Amusement pushed aside the gnaw of apprehension in Harry’s chest. “What do you think I am?” he joked. “Your—?”
Without thinking, Harry drifted his lips to the knuckle below Draco's ring. To the tiny valley between his ring and middle fingers, parting his lips enough to dampen the spot with his tongue, and again over the bone of Draco’s middle knuckle, and into the next dip, and back up. Continuing, when Draco tilted his hand, arrested, the balance of his held breath loud between them as Harry followed the line of his hand down to his thumb, each kiss saturated with a gentleness Harry hadn’t known he still possessed, rising from some place inside him he’d secreted away. He kissed the jut of Draco’s thumb knuckle, and moved along to the bone of his wrist, then turned Draco’s hand and nosed the cuff of his sleeve higher to press his lips to the pattern of veins Harry knew by heart.
Draco blinks. “I suppose so.” He hadn’t even thought about it, though if the magic Silencing him about the work they did on Nine was still in effect, there's a very real chance he would have choked to death. “I’m a developer of magical instruments and objects, specialising in configuring common spells to suit the undercover needs of the black ops and special forces teams. My team has made half of the defensive mystical items that your group have been so fond of using the last five years.”
“Close enough, I’d wager.”
And it really might; he and Malfoy may not have been able to form any sort of friendship over the last couple of years — and Malfoy’s made it rather clear he never wants to, so dismissive once Teddy’s out of the room, he often won’t even
Since Harry hadn’t confronted Draco about avoiding him for almost a month, and Draco had barely met his eyes during the exam, that seemed more than a little unwarranted. “How am I looking at you?”
“S’there something wrong w’m loo?”
Malfoy blinks, slowly. His eyes land vacantly on Harry and then with a small twitch, they focus. He stares at Harry for a long beat, arms growing tense under Harry’s hand. Suddenly, he crumples the paper in his fist and shoves it into Harry’s chest. “I honestly might rather die than go another step with you,” he says.
” she snapped back mulishly. “I
“Hopefully we won’t have any international incidents on the dance floor this time,” Harry said, exhilarated.
“Yes,” Malfoy says, sighing, “he’s still attached to me like a growth.”
“Couldn’t you have picked a— I don’t know,
Potter recently made headlines for his brand new look, as well as for shopping at the exclusive—
” Harry blurted.
Harry blinked. His ears were hot, his breath coming a bit too fast. A quick scan of Malfoy’s  face told him he’d already missed the opportunity to respond without sounding like an idiot — Malfoy was staring at him, wide-eyed, a pink stain spilling over those cheekbones. Harry cleared his throat. His voice cracked anyway.
He headed to Employee Resources as soon as Potter was gone to put in for a week of holiday leave. He needed some distance.
didn’t — it felt like a year or more had gone by in the week since he’d last got to touch Draco like this, his physical desire a faint echo to what Draco’s thoughtless responses were doing to his heart. No longer tense or guarded, Draco was moving against the fit of Harry’s body as if he belonged there, hips working a slow, rolling beat against Harry’s pelvis, his free hand coming up to sink into Harry’s hair. He twisted his head and brought them nose-to-nose, panting against Harry’s mouth.
“Moonstone.” Draco’s Adam’s apple bobbed as Harry’s knuckles grazed it, his fingers slipping between cool fabric and hot skin. “They’re— They— go with my robes.”
Harry’s heart was running at a sprint, that small point of contact with Draco through the material of his shirt so tantalising he could barely draw a breath, the words,
Harry acknowledged the truth of that. But sometimes Draco's resistance made doing things a lot more fun.
Really, it was because Draco wasn’t sure Weasley would accept the best one if presented in person, but Potter’s explanation was good enough and didn’t paint him in a bad light, so he shrugged again.
“It does not.” Though, actually… the dressing gown had been his favourite since he bought it in fifth year, and he’d grown at least four inches since then. But, wait. “
Horrified, Draco took in her sly smile — he’d known there would be
Draco hesitates. "Sorry," he says. "I was just… I thought you'd probably be thirsty. I brought water."
* * *
He won't stop rambling. Or moving. Or
Another sigh, a hesitant nod. Harry Summoned one of the chairs as Malfoy eased back to sit against the headboard. He was still in his white shirt and black breeches, but he’d discarded his ever-present boots after dinner, and for the first time Harry realised that the breeches stopped well above his ankles, right at the swell of his calf; he’d only ever seen them on or off, before. Malfoy’s legs were dusted with golden hair, his ankles sculpted and bony. It made him look younger, being barefoot but fully dressed on his bed, a hickey visible just above his collarbone. Like the teenaged version of himself, stripped of calculation.
“I don’t want to have to take it on and off every night to get dressed,” Potter says, glancing down at his shoulder. “It’s better if I can keep it as stationary as possible while it heals.”
did you keep finding—?”
~ ~ ~
Pausing in the act of pulling off his socks, Potter quirked an eyebrow at him. He pulled his jumper and shirt off over his head, a grin creeping over his face and walked over to Draco’s bed, setting one knee at the foot of his mattress. “And what plans would those be?”
Harry thought,
“It sparked gold when you used wandless last week in front of me,” Malfoy said. At the confusion he must’ve seen on Harry’s face, he added, “Just under your hand, when you took off your robes? But it left a shadow. I could do you,” he said, smile taking on a wicked slant when Harry gulped, “very easily. If you change your mind. Take some time to think about it, Harry — and let me know.”
, his nose squishing against the warm curve of Bill’s neck, his glasses tilting precariously. Bill held him tight for a few seconds, breathing in deep, then gripped him by the waist and gently moved him away. He searched Harry’s eyes, then slid his gaze over Harry’s shoulder. Something in his face changed, his fingers loosening, letting go.
“Do you think whatever you felt about it would have disappeared in the last ten hours?”
The clause was a small thing, a single note made to her marriage contract, which was preserved in the historical records of Gringotts. It had been written six weeks before Harry and Draco’s marriage contract had been drawn:
something.
He stares at the top of the tent and scowls as he considers. There’s been something of a tonal shift to his nightmares lately, more memory than accusation. Softer, too, and quieter; almost comforting. He’s gone over them ad nauseum, but can’t think of a reason for the change. Can’t think of any reason why else his mind is caught on her reassurances — on her remarkable, hidden tenderness and on the sense of connection they’d always shared — rather than the gruesome reality of her death. Can’t figure out why they nevertheless feel like nightmares upon waking. They just… do.
In the short time Harry’d spent falling for him, Draco had done more than revise his wardrobe and take him to task for proper pinky-in-air placement while he sipped his tea: he’d made Harry laugh and want…
“I wasn’t finished,” Draco says. “It’s all part of the same one.”
“I’m… flattered?” Harry said. Draco squeezed his arm, his hand bleeding warmth through Harry’s shirt.
isn’t it, Potter. So I can toss out any manner of person I want, just

Draco lifted his head. “I wasn’t.” He disengaged, stroking over his softening cock with his fingers and thumb and shuddering a little as he pulled out, then slid off the warmth of Potter’s body. “You’re on my pillow.”
8. Slytherin tie clip.
Harry looks back to the coin; they’ve got to be getting close to the limit. He taps out,
“I don’t want one, thanks.”
“Yes? And why is that?”
“Make love to me,” Draco says, and Harry brings up his head.
“And?”
“Ha ha.”
Now that they’re out of the room, Potter seems to have expanded somehow, the caged tension prowling inside him let loose. It suits him, Draco’s surprised to notice. Being stuck in a tiny tent in the middle of nature, chin smudged with ash, sweaty hair drying in ridiculous curls, a rust-toned streak of soup near the corner of his lip. It makes Draco feel strange, separating Potter from the situation they’re in like that — guilty, somehow.
So, still a bit of a dick, although Harry had already known that about him. But afterwards, Malfoy never troubled himself interfering in Harry’s repairs; he seemed content in the knowledge that his claim over the bike irritated Harry to some degree.
,” Harry said, angry about it anew. His hand was starting to sting, the clean white towel sopping red. He turned back to the sink and ran the water again, mostly so he didn’t have to look at Ron’s face. “I got as far as ‘tall and blond’ before the argument went sideways and
"Not— usually," Ron hedges. "This doesn't… happen, anymore. I think they covered it for about two minutes in the Pairing Dynamics course. The, uh. History of pheromones." He sighs and scratches at the scar on his wrist. Hermione likes to bite him there when they're fucking. Ron's always in a brilliant mood following nights when her teeth has broken skin again. Her own staked claim, a symbol of ownership.
“It’ll hurt for a few days, there was too much damage to fully repair both of them.” Draco mutters, avoiding Harry’s gaze. “There are probably specialists who can, later.”
It was two a.m. But the length of Draco’s side was warm against Harry’s front, both of them nude, pressed flush, and Harry wasn’t particularly inclined to answer. He kissed the knob of Draco’s shoulder and lifted his arm from where it was lying across his stomach.
“Right. Yeah, okay.” His voice is hollow to his own ears, distant, the world around him rocked on its side. He thinks of Draco’s hand under his, and on the back of his neck. He thinks of the heat of Draco’s skin and the way Draco moves against him, then shuffles those memories to the furthest reaches of his mind and draws himself up. “When?” he asks, voice unwavering. “Am I supposed to call back—?”
Harry didn’t get out.
“Yeah.”
"Right." Harry tossed him gently to the ground. "Now go get into some trouble outside the Manor."
“Confess,” Robards echoed hoarsely. “No. I’d—”
Draco’s brows drew inward. He paused, then slowly said, “I know that six months ago, you hated me more than anyone else alive—”
” was the last thing he said to him. They only got to the landing of the third floor before Geoff shuddered, pulling back against his grip. Draco looked back in time to see the white film cover Geoff’s eyes, to see the way Geoff’s chest deflated and stayed that way. Without thinking, he swung his wand —  it transfigured into a sword of sorts, and then Geoff’s head was quite disconnected from his neck and Draco didn’t have time to contemplate what he had done; he was too busy slashing down an elderly woman on his way up the stairs, her brown eyes going half-white, her face twisting from pain into blank avarice.
Draco didn’t cry. But he was malleable in Harry’s arms, letting himself be soothed — as much for Harry’s sake, Harry suspected, as his own. Harry ran his hands down Draco’s back. Slipped them under his pyjama shirt. He crossed his wrists and pressed his pinkies to the shallow dips at the small of Draco’s back, the span of his hands wide as Draco’s narrow hips. Touching Draco, and finding comfort that the jagged edges of golden thread hadn’t affected his inexhaustible want.
“I know,” Draco says. He rubs his hand over his face to mask the residual warmth of his flush and moves to sit in the chair behind the desk, placing Harry’s machete next to his wand. He rotates the chair to face the window. The storms have mostly raged themselves out in the last few days, and diluted light pours in through a crack in the curtains. “It doesn’t matter. Anyway, none of that—” he gestures to the empty space where they stood together “—was what I needed to talk to you about. To tell you.”
“We’re not—” Forcing his panic down, Draco attempts to look at the situation objectively, and can’t. But he takes a breath and pushes forward. “Are we?”
And sometimes — more often of late, when Draco comes home smelling of someone else — what they might have been.
"Not tomorrow, or, ah… today," Draco mumbled in their bed as the sun came up. The birds, moved to their window, had begun chattering, and Fearful, as he did every morning, slithered up to the glass to watch them. Draco exhaled, words spinning out soft and light as candy floss. "Another day, yes. Here, at home, perhaps," he said, and fell asleep.
” and reached back between them for Draco’s flies — Muggle things, a button and a zip, so normal that he fumbled undoing them. Draco stilled as Harry manoeuvred a hand into his trousers, curled his fingers around his shaft.
“The contract alerted him, just before dawn,” Harry said, reading it again. He sounded odd, his throat constricted. “We can invite guests at our discretion.”
“Master Harry was being very worried for Master Draco,” Kreacher continued critically, not missing a beat. “He is caring for him in his ugliness and cleaning him when he stank of urine, he is panicked and crying when he sees Master Draco, and saying he is sorry, sorry, and please won’t his love find a way to live, he cannot be left a widower—”
“Merlin, I hadn’t realised,” Draco said. He put a dramatic hand to his chest. “I shall Owl him to offer the use of my body immediately. As I’m sure you’ve done for every admiring bit of post you’ve received over the years.”
Then Harry says Draco's name like a question, and Draco swallows and says "
“It means what it means,” Potter said cryptically, stopping further questions with a long, open-mouthed kiss.
with the public!” Ron said, starting to look angry again. “You talk to every kid you meet, you donate, you—”
“I’m a liability to you and I’d rather not be,” he says.
to… Who did you get?”
"None of us want you to." Bill’s eyebrows drew together. “Hermione’s looking for a way to get you out of it. I am, Fleur is. I’ve no doubt even the Malfoys are looking. We would never, ever make you.”
A pale gleam of hair comes up from behind the small sofa. “Malfoy,” Malfoy says, and laughs, high-pitched and almost giddy. He pushes up, rushing to Harry so fast that Harry nearly raises the machete. But Malfoy skids to a halt just before him, hands moving over Harry's chest and arms, fluttering little touches of disbelief. Harry stays still, heart thundering deplorably loud, not quite sure what to do. He feels floaty and disconnected, as though he’s watching their meeting several paces away, the madness in Malfoy’s face setting him off-kilter — Malfoy, who always seemed so calculating, even that last awful night of the war when Harry saw him beg for his life.
“And only four more days,” Harry said, adding, with an innocent smile at Draco’s raised eyebrows, “until Christmas.” Draco snorted and Harry grinned. There was awkwardness in their exchange, and something softer, too — the sort of thing Harry had once thought Draco not capable of.  Maybe he'd even been right, before they landed here and back at Hogwarts. But he wanted to fix what misconceptions he could, and wanted Draco to know that he had. He wanted to do things right; he had the sense they both did. Bumping Draco’s shoulder with his own, he said, “What would you have done?”
“I didn’t— know that,” Harry admitted. “I mean, yes to the—” he gestured between them, “—but you—” What.
,” he said at length.
“There is no finishing it.” Harry cleared his throat, conscious of the way Malfoy made it sound as though he was talking in hypotheticals, or about proxies — a method of distancing that had the room around Harry narrowing dizzily, the nape of Malfoy’s neck compelling as the light at the end of a tunnel. “We've indulged it enough.”
, but he knows what it is to need something that feels good, and this
“Ask him if he likes the shrubbery, or if he wants a different sort.”
“Harry,” Hermione whispered.
Under normal circumstances, Harry might have been comforted by the memory of his excessive wanking sessions that morning — might have thought that would ensure a measure of protection from being caught out — but as his cock seemed determined to ignore his many, increasingly exasperated lectures, he didn’t exactly feel prepared to disrobe. Already, he could feel a slight twitch of arousal lengthening it against his thigh, Draco’s eyes expectant and… and
?” Malfoy said, lips curving in a mocking smile. “And how many times have you seen those friends of yours since you met with me? How many times have you actually made it home to sleep? I bet they have a room down at the DMLE just for that. Right? So Aurors on-duty can have a kip? S’that where you spend most of your nights, Potter? Bet you do it even when you’re not on schedule.”
Shifting Teddy onto his hip and lowering onto his knees, Harry grabs a handful of powder and throws it against the grates, then sticks his head into the flames that erupt and calls out Malfoy’s address. He’s got one of those fancy call-signalling chimes Harry keeps meaning to invest in, and Harry listens to it ringing faintly in the background of Malfoy’s empty study. Bouncing Teddy on his hip, he resigns himself to either a long wait, or an incredibly cross Malfoy spewing venom his way for being woken up.
And even then.
Blaise bit his lip, looking back and forth between Pansy and the desk, dry amusement replacing stupefaction. “Told you that you should leave one empty.”
“Magically binding?” he asked. She glared at him and nodded. Harry leaned down, brushed a sympathetic kiss against her cheek, and straightened, looking around her disordered office. Despite how overwhelmed with work she was, she’d been smiling when he’d arrived, even before she noticed him. Disturbed, he realised he couldn’t remember the last time
“Well, not me, personally,” Malfoy said over the sound of a zipper sliding down, a current of hard laughter in his voice. “Where is he, by the way? Don’t tell me you scared off our only witness; knowing he’d be watching as I defiled you was the only reason this was remotely palatable.”
Draco grinds his teeth audibly, so frustrated Harry can’t stop himself from grinning — which, of course seems to piss of Draco even more. “
Malfoy makes a sound of frustration. “What the bloody—”
“Then give up!”
* * *
Harry found the first one by accident, a wrong turn that turned out not to be — a turn taken where there shouldn’t have been one to take, the corridor unravelling before him.
Eyes locked, they both stopped moving. Malfoy’s lips were parted, his gaze shocked and wide — and Harry felt that as well, as much as everything else, all of it tangled up inside him, want and pain and disbelief that no, it wasn’t a long-running nightmare after all. They’d
“B-because—” Malfoy closed his eyes, his throat working silently. He canted his hips towards Harry, pressing the solid line of his cock against Harry’s pelvis, and they drew in simultaneously sharp breaths. He turned his doorknob and pushed the door open, but didn’t move from his spot, leaned against the door jam. A far less comfortable a spot to fuck than his posh bed, glowing from the light of the fire in Malfoy’s room, right in Harry’s line of sight. He looked back to Malfoy’s face, saw Malfoy’s eyes on his mouth with the same sort of fascination Harry felt every time Grimmauld place revealed one of her treasures. “Because of the date,” Malfoy got out. He rotated his hips, ever-so-slightly. “Potter, do you want to—?”
But hating Potter? That part hadn’t changed, and it had served me too well to give it up. It entertained me when I was young and bored enough to stay up all night making badges, and it soothed my pride when he stood up for me in front of the Wizengamot. Hating Potter had even distracted me from my nerves the first week of my fellowship, Potter always in the background as chatter from the students — who quickly learned their discussions about Defence while in Potions would cost them House points — and glowering at me in the corridors. I hated everything about the man. Perhaps stubbornly, but it was… comfortable.
Harry thought, reassured. Trying to be.
“I—” My throat closed up. Potter flashed me another smile and stepped forward, between my splayed legs. He dragged his fingertips over the loose waistband of my trousers, my boxers, carefully avoiding contact with my cock, and then abruptly grabbed them and tugged them down, hard enough for the fabric to burn my arse. I hissed and lifted my hips, and Potter wrangled my clothing off, kneeling down as he went. He plucked one of my shoes off, the other, gaze flicking from my prick to my face, breath ghosting over my bollocks. He raised his eyebrows questioningly.
, so perfect Harry’s tempted to just peel the knickers down and finish him off like this. But each halting breath Draco takes, each stutter from his hips into Harry’s hands, is a promise for how much sweeter it’ll be if Harry lives up to his word, so he pulls off with regret. He slides his tongue over the damp lace covering Draco’s cock and looks up through crooked glasses.
“There’s a, a, a lit
“I’m not— I wouldn’t—” Harry swallows, reaching for an honest answer that doesn’t give too much of himself away. “I’d do anything for them; they’ve earned my trust,” he says, and has to brace himself against the bitter grimace that pulls at Draco’s mouth. “But I wouldn’t let you die to save myself. I said I'd defend you, and I will.”
Harry removes his glasses and strips down. Tosses his clothing into the laundry bin. He pushes into the steamy bathroom and stops for a moment when he’s close enough to see Draco in the shower stall through the mist; Draco stands under the spray, both hands flat on the tile, his head dropped defeatedly forward. Though his posture is concerning, Harry can’t help his admiration for the visual: the cascade of water down Draco’s back, the pale warmth of his complexion, his lanky, narrow-hipped height and the easy flex of his buttocks.  It’s been a long time since those first few years when they could barely keep their hands off each other, but Harry thinks his body will respond to the sight of Draco’s nudity if they manage to live into their hundreds. He clears his throat to announce himself and pulls open the shower door.
” Harry said again. He wrapped his arms around his midsection.
Because doing… whatever, with Potter,
He sat up and set the book he hadn’t been reading aside when Potter came in. Potter’s cheeks were pink and he was breathing heavily. Snow dotted his hair.
“Yeah.” Potter stared at him for another moment. He took a step back and nodded, his Adam’s apple bobbing. “Yeah. I’ll— I’ll, uh, go. It smells really good, Malfoy. Save me some, if you think of it.”
and even though their refractory periods have slowed, Harry believes him. He pulls out his fingers, turns Draco around, and takes the time — they have
Minerva lifts her face to Dumbledore’s portrait on the wall as though silenting asking him to weigh in — and, really, Hermione sympathises — but all of the portraits have gone regrettably dormant since the curse was unleashed. Every likeness reduced to nothing more than canvas and paint; all of their specialness suffocated by the magic that once breathed them to life.
“Possibly, to some degree. It is... intimate,” Draco says at length, hedging. “But mostly because it wasn’t ever…” His Adam’s apple bobs, and the lines around his pursed frown deepen. “It’s never been like that, before; it’s... an uncomfortable exercise. We only train to become proficient because knowing how to do it with another person makes it easier to identify the specific balance, that elemental give-and-take, required when performing more complex magics. Once I could do that without thinking, I stopped practicing that particular spell. In the interim, I must’ve forgotten something, or I was too distracted; whatever the case it’s my fault we’re still linked.”
is the one keeping him at arm’s length anymore, rather than the other way around.
“It’s not ridiculous.” Harry retrieved his Invisibility Cloak and rolled it into a tighter bundle, then took a moment to hunt for the cloak he’d worn over his robes. He pulled out the little drawstring pouch within it, worked his Cloak inside, and felt around for the brush of wandwood against his fingers.
Still not quite convinced he wouldn’t come at the slightest provocation, Harry took a few deep breaths. “Right,” he said, voice cracking. “Yeah.” He frowned. “Wait, how—?”
“If that’s what we’re calling them, these days,” Draco says. He closes his eyes.
“It’s, uh…” Pansy sounded hoarse, and Draco glanced at her. She pointed to his desktop.
He’s seconds away from doing it, from stepping forward and taking back whatever it was he gave Malfoy last night — the last of his of control, of his ability to compartmentalise, the last of his fucking
There’d been a funny, pained note in his voice, but the look he turned on Harry had been fond.
— legal advice under those circumstances, ethically, I’d need to know why you need to know so badly.”
“—the spell—”
Robards paused, grey eyebrows rising fractionally, in the act of lowering himself into one of the visitor’s chairs. He cleared his throat and sat. “Yes?” he asked.
“Fuck.”
Potter folded his arms over his chest. “You’re scared of me. I bet you don’t even know what you
“Of course not,” Draco said after a pause. “And I’ll admit, it would be convenient to add you to my list of Floo calls when I’m feeling particularly—”
Catching his lip between his teeth, Draco finished up with Harry’s hand in silence, then wrapped it in a bandage and thrust his hand away, and rolled another phial across the table towards him. “That’ll help with the muscle repair. It’s going to hurt, come morning,” he warned, slumping back in his chair.
“Gone,” Harry says curtly. He jerks the broom from Malfoy’s grip and mounts it, but with the way the Inferi suck magic from the atmosphere, he’s already used up what he can manage from his initial burst to seal the door. Malfoy’s still staring, and Harry growls and shakes his arm, “It wouldn’t work for you, either?”
“I don’t know,” Hermione says. “Only that Ron was able to get Narcissa Malfoy here, and that it’s imperative Malfoy gets to the castle.”
“Have you changed your mind?” Draco asked levelly.
” Harry met Draco’s eyes, barely pacified by the regret he saw there. He sighed and stretched for his glasses. “Tell him we’re done— that we were showering. Separately! That—”
Draco blinks, surprised. “Uhm.”
” Harry breathed out, chills rising along his arms, the back of his neck a flash of hot and cold. He looked up, met Malfoy’s gaze squarely. “You’ll have to stop. No, it didn’t occur to me that wedded people could and do live apart, but that’s irrelevant. We’ll never have any hope of getting to a place where we can… if you can’t—”
"I don't know about everyone else, but… The night you turned seventeen," Bill said, blue eyes steady on him in the way that always made Harry— "Fleur Polyjuiced into you."
your ‘burgeoning business’?” Harry asked, irritated.
He did. “My parents.”
god, love."
Harry tried to tell Draco with his eyes.
Not from just looking at him.
* * *
The set of Draco’s mouth eased a little — softening, inviting. He swallowed and said, “And there was, ah, another… complication.” He traced his way back up the gnarled branches, over Harry and Sirius, Walberga, to her brother Cygnus. Down again, finding Narcissa, linked to Lucius, his name partially hidden by leaves, and then further:
The mutinous fury on Malfoy’s face slowly shifted into wariness. “For fuck’s sake, Potter, when was the last time you got a full night’s sleep?”
it had said,
, that Potter might really want him.
Ron says wryly in his head.
"Hey." Ron swallows, seeming to realise he's tweaked Harry's instincts. Better than Harry, apparently, who can only focus on his own rage, and whose mind seems intent on feeding him an image of Malfoy being dragged from his arms. Then Ron's beside him, a hand firm on his shoulder. "He
Sometime around that point, the mistletoe magic decided it was a ‘proper’ kiss, and Harry and Hermione broke apart, laughing along with everyone else. Ron was grinning at Ginny, barely paying any attention to his wife and his best mate snogging a few steps away; he looked over, his grin taking on a diabolical slant, and Harry's heart filled with so much affection for him, he had to hold onto Hermione for another second before he was sure he could stay upright.
“I know. I
“All right,” Draco said. He nestled the outer edge of his hand in the curls at his pelvis and ringed two fingers and his thumb around the base of his cock, tight, familiarly — the same way he’d held Harry’s wrists. He sighed, the tension bleeding from the muscles under Harry’s hands. “All right.”
Potter reached down and put his hand over Draco’s. His lashes fluttered and Draco’s heart did, too — Potter looked a bit like the holidays himself, all rosy red cheeks and bright green eyes. Draco thought of how he’d look in a few minutes and tilted his head for another kiss. Potter sighed against him. “When, what?”
Pansy fell silent, still looking at him. Their parents had come to the table multiple times over the years to engage in talks about their future. For awhile, it had seemed the thing, an obvious choice to make. It still did, sometimes, though they’d probably have to use Muggle technology to have any offspring; Draco learned at thirteen that even kissing her made his bollocks virtually disappear inside his body. It hadn’t been pleasant. But this was. And they were of-age, and he trusted her, and Pansy’d never once looked at him like...
They’d got drunk on cheap wine the night he’d said it, laughing like lunatics, and celebrated their second anniversary by making love with the windows thrown wide open for once, so Draco could prove himself an honest man to anyone listening.
Instead of trying any longer, Harry had warded the parlour doors in a fit of temper and left Kreacher to manage things, finding a flat with Ron and Hermione in Highgate near the woods. He spent most of his days walking through them, or sitting on the private terrace of their flat that overlooked a communal garden, which got noisy with children in the afternoons. Hermione worried about him, silently at first — fluttering about him whenever he came indoors — and then openly, bringing home pamphlets for different careers or courses of study.
” Draco gritted back, fumbling for his wand to throw a good hex and somehow only managing to squeeze Potter’s generous erection through his trousers. “
Shepherd’s pie and an emerald green and grey. Royal blue over navy on veg night. And finally, a deep green shirt and black breeches, silver hieroglyphics marking the outside length, from hip to boot. Harry forced himself to keep eating.
“How much time did you take?” Malfoy asked, stopping by the reception desk.
" Potter breathed hard, hands roving up and down Draco’s sides. “We don’t have time,” he said at last, gaze rising from Draco’s cock to his face. But he swallowed hard. He pulled his wand from where it was tucked into his towel at his hip and pointed it at the doors, locking them with a crooked little smile. “So no one sees us,” he explained. Draco yanked him back in for another punishing kiss, getting Potter’s towel off and casting it to the floor. His cock throbbed against the heat of Potter’s skin, Potter’s erection fiercely hard against Draco’s pelvic bone. Potter dug violent fingers into Draco’s arms, breath hitching as he rubbed against Draco, twisting his hips so their pricks coasted off each other. Draco hissed, pulling Potter’s upper lip into his mouth for a final, biting suck, then turned in his arms, rucking up his robe and canting his hips back to meet Potter’s cock with his bare arse.
Kreacher, peering down the corridor when Harry called him, only said houses kept secrets even house-elves could not know. Harry considered that for a while, Sirius’ words in his ear as he tried to pick out details from the shadows in the distance, then walked away.
“Yeah, I don’t care. Malfoy and I will do it if you can talk Ron around,” Potter said, pulling Draco along over his protestations. “We’ve got to go.”
Harry banged into the tea shop, scanning everyone who looked up until he got to Malfoy, who lowered the paper he was reading, and then spat his sip of tea all over it when he spotted Harry. Malfoy half-rose from his chair, coughing and trying to shake the paper dry, one wary eye on Harry as he approached.
You come, overstimulated and overfucked. You come from the thought of being owned by him, and from the pressure of his knot throbbing against your prostate, pleasure lit into every jangling nerve you have. You paint your shirt with your climax, your belly, you never want it to end. Harry slumps over you, breath hot on your shoulders, and you let him slide you to the thin padding of the cot.
“I know,” he repeated, taking another sip of his coffee. “I’m just—  I wish I’d paid more… I wish I’d known. But you couldn’t have known all of—”
Belatedly, Theo echoed the sentiment. Then he stepped in — against protocol, before Draco had responded — to pull Draco into a hug. Draco returned it with a small, affectionate scoff that had the tendons in Harry’s forearms flexing tight. Blaise hesitated and then held out a hand, forcing Harry to pull his from the pockets of his robes to grasp it.
“I guess— thank you,” Harry said. “For, you know, checking on me the other night. I appreciate it.” A painful-looking groove appeared between Draco’s eyebrows. Harry cleared his throat. “And that, um,” decision made, he didn’t know why this was so difficult, “I thought maybe we could try to, you know, get on.”
Harry let Malfoy move his wand hand away, because — he did. He’d had front row seating for that show, knew precisely what Malfoy was prepared to do to protect her. It was probably the most decent thing about him. And the worst.
With a forced unclenching of my jaw, I say, "Perhaps. Usually when I haven't been coerced into missing lunch to follow a dead lead down Knockturn Alley with you." A faintly hurt expression flirts with his features, and I can't help but sigh. "Look. I'm going to freshen up; why don't you finish and we can talk after I've eaten."
“Shh.” Draco lifted his hands away. He moved around the table to Harry’s right and came down low, his breath tickling the back of Harry’s ear. “Let your mind drift. I’m going to untangle the shadow in your wandless; I think it’s connected directly to your magical core. It may feel strange at first, but it’s just my magic so try not to fight it. Understand?”
Potter eyed him, lips quirking. He stretched out long, denim-clad legs under the table, raked careless fingers through his disaster hair, and tipped his mug of beer up to his mouth. When he set it back down, there was foam on his upper lip. He licked it away and gestured to the other beer on the table.
“He wants you.”
A flash of guilt crosses Malfoy’s face. “That wasn’t what that was about,” he says, gaze swerving away. “That wasn’t what I meant.”
“I could
, in matter of fact,” Lucius said. He tapped the small table in front of the sofa with his wand, and an unbound scroll resting there snapped closed and shot into his grip. Smoothly, he tucked it into an inner pocket of his robes.
She pulls away at length, her dimple flashing when she peers back up at Hermione. “If I get all my maths done this morning, can I go see my friend later?”
“No.” Pansy made a throaty sound that Harry could have sworn was genuine amusement. “Although that’s not unheard of for people who are six months shy of their wedding.”
“Of course it is!” Harry says, cringing inside because
, if Malfoy wanted. Thinks there could be a way for both of them to share the space they’re slowly moving into. Harry lifts his hand to touch the satiny strand of hair that had rested on his shoulder that night and Malfoy catches his wrist, the bones grinding in his grip. They stare at each other.
“I meant to ask something about that,” Malfoy says as Harry takes a first tentative sip from his own tin. He’s fairly pleased with the result, even given that he generally likes his coffee with heavy doses of cream. Malfoy says his name and Harry drags his attention back. Malfoy purses his lips. “That one we saw…” He pauses to clear his throat. “On the road. She was alone.”
“Yeah, and I dried and cleaned it for us when you passed out. You’re welcome. Keep it up and I won’t let you fuck me for a week.”
The matters they discussed seemed less important to Harry than the fact that meals no longer seemed a thousand hours long, that they could learn to survive each other’s company. The better they could, the better chance there was that one of the Floos might open to admit guests. Malfoy wasn’t sweet, but he was animated and skillful and shrewd, and Harry supposed having an established routine with him couldn’t hurt.
,” it said.
them, but it’s been… simpler to not broach the subject.
,” Draco said coolly, colour rising in his cheeks and seeping down his chest — hot, inconsistent blotches, a skitter of pink from the taut tendons above his clavicle to below his belly-button, reminiscent enough of his hives to give Harry a moment of concern, until Draco took a deep breath. “Wouldn’t Granger be more well-versed? As I was given to understand, she’s embroiled herself deeply in our little saga.”
“Is this the part where you appeal to our few commonalities?” Grange exhales a small, scathing laugh and says, “Even pit vipers care for their young.”
Their mouths met again, Draco’s palm curling tight around the back of Harry’s neck. Harry felt it like an anchor, Draco's hand possessive and commanding on him:
get in?” Draco said.
“I know.”
Harry ground the heels of his palms to his eyes until light flowered in the darkness from the pressure. “I didn’t know,” he said, feeling helpless. “I didn’t know.”
— explosion, you utter shit, what was I supposed to do?”
, Draco mouthed, a wrinkle tucked on the bridge of his nose. He slowly rose so they were at eye level with one another. “What did Pansy tell you?”
“I know.”
“You bought me coffee,” Draco said flatly. He nudged the tall cup further away from him with one knuckle. “Slip something in it, did you? What is it, a cheering potion? Something to make me more amenable to whatever asinine plan you’ve got in place for today’s patrol?”
it’s hard to be proven so clueless so many times in one night. He touches the folded edge of the coverlet on the empty side of the bed. “Should, uh, is it— Um, can I listen to the story too?”
“Are you going to invite me in?” he asked.
“We’ll leave tomorrow at first light,” Harry says, abruptly certain they can’t stay any longer than that without serious risk. “Somehow.”
“Quill and parchment,” he says, and Malfoy grabs the complementary set the hotel offers with gratifying haste. Harry jots down the symbols to translate.
“It is being ten—”
* * *
Malfoy’s fault, and he should have just
“I meant— I didn’t want it to be a reaction to something else, the first time,” Harry says, each word dragged painfully from him by the demand in Draco’s gaze. “I meant I didn’t want you to wake up and regret it, regret me. I meant that I wanted to do it right so we wouldn’t end up…” He trails off when Draco starts shaking his head.
“Do you care?” he asked, licking the shell of Draco’s ear.
Licking his lips, Potter moved with a swiftness that startled me — and crawled
“Yes?”
there?”
He rolls the coin against his knuckle with his thumb, chest tight. It’s always been a bit of a laugh, what the public thinks of his connection to Ron and Hermione, the way the press implies the three of them can read each other’s minds or possibly underwent a life-long bonding spell, but right now it stings that that’s not true. As grateful as he is for this small link to them, he wishes they’d done something grander, that the old wizarding tales were true and there'd
“Or maybe you just think I’ve changed?” Draco asked. His grip eased, the pads of his fingers stroking the soft inside of Harry’s thigh. “After all, you
“I think it maybe would have been smart to work stuff like that out before running off to marry someone you’d been shagging for only a couple of weeks.”
For some reason, that seems to register. Harry blinks again and pins Draco with a stare. The walls and floor stop creaking as though on the verge of flying apart. The windows take a few seconds longer; the screech of Inferi, at length, slowly begins to subside.
Running her fingers over it, Hermione scans it for what feels like the thousandth time. In truth, it might be. Torn from
On the third night, Malfoy buried his face in the mattress and didn’t even try to guide Harry’s hand over him, fisting his own cock as Harry had and coming just as hard, only softly groaned instructions or commands passing between them.
Now, Harry didn’t know which parts of himself to fear losing. If he pulled Draco’s hips tight to his, if he kissed him, if it no longer felt tainted by obligation. He let the thought settle in his mind, and put his fingers to the soft cotton over Draco’s hip. Draco drew a breath — pulling further away.
He's airborne.
“I’m the love of your life,” Draco murmured, digging out a strip of medicated gauze from his bag with one hand. He pressed it against Harry’s palm and said, “Hold that,” before turning to hunt through his bag for something else.
me you didn’t call some new bloke hot in front of your husband
Harry never comments on it, doesn’t seem to mind more than a sleepy frown at Draco indicates, but Draco would just as soon avoid blatant reminders that might instigate his more graphic dreams.
The tyres were in place. The chain, the pedals. The white covers on the handlebars. The bike looked just like the one Harry had seen his mum riding in the single photograph Petunia kept of her — or, more accurately, the single photo Lily hadn’t been cropped from. Petunia probably hadn’t seen the need; the camera was focused on her posing with a similar bicycle in the centre of the picture, Harry’s mum a blurry streak behind her, riding out of frame. She would have been about fourteen then, was Harry’s best guess, and Harry felt proud restoring something that he thought she would have liked.
“Yes, that’s right,” Harry heard as he contemplated licking the strip of skin visible between Draco’s collar and jaw. “I do remember reading about what happened with the Spanish Minister’s daughter.”
"You mean my friend and mentor? A man I trust, who cares deeply about justice?" Harry said, bristling. "No, I assume you've got a history of making sure your interests are taken care of first. So: how much?"
“Draco,” Harry whispers again, and Draco swallows the acrid burn in his throat as two Inferi start rounding the far corner, time slowing to incremental shreds. Harry scrambles to reach the rung above, misses and kicks at the air, swinging hard and trying to regain his balance. He raises his voice, “Draco, you can make it—.”
Annoyed, Harry rolled his eyes. “Buckbeak did not leave a—”
“Yes?” Narcissa Malfoy asked. Her voice was cool, poised, though it was obvious he’d just woken her up; her eyes were sleep-puffy, and her hair floated soft about her shoulders, her fingers clutching the neck of her silk dressing gown closed. Harry spared her a tight smile and pushed in past her.
“Dobby,” Malfoy echoed with a blink. His voice was flat. He slowly took his seat once more but didn’t pick up his fork. He narrowed his eyes. “Think what you want about that, but at least I’ve never abandoned an elf to die of boredom and loneliness.”
“I’m not your
Draco swallowed. “You
, if we hadn’t been forced into this house? Forced into touching each other?”
"I'm sorry, mummy."
“Come out of here,” Harry says with a long sigh. One of these days, he’s going to learn to keep his fucking mouth shut. His shoulder gives a throb not unlike the one in his chest when he looks at the defensive stoicism on Malfoy’s face. Malfoy looks about to reiterate his demand, and Harry shakes his head again. “Come on. Put on your shoes; I’ve made breakfast and we need to get going soon. Plus,” he adds quickly, “I need your expertise on something.”
, she says savagely in his ear. Then, in a softer, more recognisable tone, one laced with laughter,
Pulse thrown into overdrive once there, Harry pretended not to notice Draco on the sofa and took his time looking around. Draco’s flat resembled his — smallish and cosy, cluttered in the same manner of most people who spent the majority of their waking hours at work. Framed photographs lined the mantlepiece; a Wireless was half-hidden by stacks of files on the desk in the corner; a row of unwatered herbs rested upon the ledge of one window. One of Draco’s living room walls had a built-in shelf crammed with books, Medical texts, mostly. Some fiction, several true crime novels.
I can't. I come with a small, unspooling yelp, a whistle of air like a ready kettle. Potter's eyes grow even larger as my prick pulses in my hand, under me, in front of him. My arse clenching, spasming, wanting something in it. On it. Wanting his weight, and the
“Slow,” Harry says. The corners of Draco’s mouth are gleaming with saliva. “Don’t suck. Just move your mouth over my cock like that,” he says, and Draco does, sliding his mouth up and down Harry’s prick with lazy bobs of his head. He relaxes his throat with each dip, just enough that Harry’s cock can slide into it for a single second or less, then rises to drag his stretched lips over the tip, his tongue around the flare, making small, sweet sounds of enjoyment. Harry shudders, his cock glistening from base to head and suffused with pleasure that has as much to do with those sounds as it does the feel of Draco’s mouth engulfing him. He feathers trembling fingers through Draco’s hair, careful not to curl them into it. “That’s it,” he breathes, so pleased even his words are trembling, “that’s perfect. You’re perfect. So good, Draco, you feel so good, sucking me just how I like—”
“You can,” Potter said softly, after a little pause, “if you want to.”
, how a-out at?”
“A tell,” Harry repeats, nodding. “Well, a few. But one of them is obvious enough to give me clear advantage: You keep dropping your shoulder.”
“We’re both clear that he’s exactly the type of guy you date, right?” Blaise said, checking over several trays of hors d'oeuvres before spelling them strategically throughout the room. He grabbed two glasses of champagne and shoved one into Draco’s hand as Draco sputtered outraged denials, because that wasn’t at
His grip is trembling. Draco twists a glance over his shoulder; the bolts holding the beams in place don’t seem to have loosened any further. Bewildered, he looks back to Harry, whose expression is unreadable.
” he says, choosing the laugh from his options, and again when Potter sighs with relief into the kiss Draco boldly takes. “I hate it more than anything, you lot are the
Draco blew out an irritated breath and Summoned Potter's jar of Every Flavour Beans, then drew out three and tossed them into the grass. The gnome scrambled to gather them, eyes lit with absurd glee.
“Which is bigger?”
Harry’s chewing slowed as he considered, and then he swallowed and said, “I need etiquette lessons. Or something to that effect.”
Thankfully there isn’t, and she’s able to conclude the meeting. But as everyone scatters to their respective tasks, Neville loiters as Hermione stows away her things.
“You’re ridiculous,” Pansy informed him upon returning Sunday night. Irritated, he cast a Healing charm over the marks dappling her fair throat. What was
But there’s no point in picking that argument, not now when things are going as well as they can.
Harry hesitated. Nodded.
“I’d like to say goodbye to Malfoy, too,” Hermione said when it was time to leave. She deflected the identical looks of shock Harry and Ron gave her with a serene smile, and after a prolonged, flustered moment, Harry sent a Patronus asking him to come down.
Granger’s eyebrows snap together; she clearly doesn’t appreciate the reminder that Harry Potter only lives now because of Narcissa’s actions. “I rather thought the testimony that kept you out of Azkaban would have shown the extent of my… gratitude.”
“Good first date activity,” Harry said, mouth dry. He pinched the seam running up the side of Draco’s robes and subtly pulled. Casting a nonchalant look around, Draco took a single step nearer, closing the gap between them, until Harry could feel his breath on his cheek. “You look handsome.”
As it turned out, however mundane or silly the tattoo was, none of them were random like Harry'd thought. Some of the reasons behind them were obvious — a tiny Slytherin snake drawn into the veins of a Hawthorn leaf; a dainty, white Narcissus flower tucked behind the ear of a hare (which, Draco told him softly, was his mother’s Patronus) — and others required explanations, but they each made perfect sense to him, if not Harry. They each meant something; a memory, if nothing else, and Harry wanted to understand them all.
Malfoy’s lips parted. “No,” he said. “I don’t trust you’ll do it at a decent hour.” His tongue darted over his lower lip, a strangely unsure gesture. “Be there on time Wednesday or I’m not rescheduling you again.”
It was the first and only time Harry had cried since waking up in the forest — until recently — and Kreacher had patted him tentatively on the shoulder, just once, then resumed fixing the room. He doesn’t tell Draco any of that. Instead, throat constricted, he says, “I did love her, you know. I loved her. I just wasn’t able to feel it for a long time. It was like…” Harry hesitates, then pushes the words out. “...like when I died in the Forest, part of me was buried there, and I had to claw my way out of my own grave before I could live again.”
Draco blew out a breath. “All right. I want you to talk about something mundane,” he said. He touched Harry’s back with two fingers at once, on either side of his spine. A fruity, floral scent. “The last thought that occured to you that felt… unimportant but curious.”
“Of course not,” Draco said, pushing him away. Potter rose to his knees, hair dry and more disheveled than ever, face pink.
“Shh. Hey.” Blaise stepped in, wide shoulders blocking Draco from Harry’s view, and vice versa. “What’s that about, lad?” He slipped an arm around Theo’s waist, and murmured something in his ear. Theo subsided abruptly, slumping against Blaise's strong frame, and Blaise glanced glanced at Harry with a grimace. “He’s just—”
Draco blinked, dizzy. He flipped the series of steel locks, blankly remembering how he’d smirked at them only days ago, an unnecessary Muggle precaution.
“Bloody hell, Malfoy—” Potter breaks off, striding towards him. He grasps the side of Draco’s neck again, palm moulding to the curve of it, a look of intense assessment on his face. He leaves space between their bodies, but Draco can feel it rise between them, the same expectancy which replaced the oxygen in his lungs last night when his tears finally petered out. Potter swallows and mutters, “Put the wand in your pocket; I’ll unshrink it later. And put your stupid glove back on.” He searches Draco’s eyes. “I can always rob another shop.”
— some younger elves in to substitute.”
“Should I tell him that?”
supposed to be a secret. Which didn’t make doing it any easier to admit, because it was never a thing that was supposed to have happened in the first place. And although (or perhaps because) Draco’s past was riddled with bad decisions, he’d learned how important it was to always understand his own motives. He liked that that he was able to, rather a lot. Being able to look at himself, clear-headed, helped him understand other people, too. But Potter defied understanding, as did every single other element about Draco’s… whatever, with him.
“You actually thought I’d make that up as a way for you to secure— No,” Malfoy said, bringing the heel of one hand up to grind against his forehead, “don’t answer that.” He sighed and dropped his hand, turning back to look at the letters, spilling sideways now, across his desk. “I might have, if I’d thought of it,” he said. “I was going to mention that it would be wise of you to rotate between a few regular plus-ones rather than attending on your own, until I saw…”
“Then maybe someone wants to humiliate all of us. What kind of a Slytherin
“Uh huh, yeah,” Harry said. “I mean, sure. What conditions?” The warmth of his face was less distracting than the skittery shocks of desire lengthening his cock — but more visible, so he could only hope Malfoy would attribute the colour of his complexion to lack of sleep. He widened his eyes to show he was listening; his cheeks were starting to hurt. “Name them.”
Harry nodded, tuning out what seemed a never ending rant as he crossed over to where Hermione stood near the counter. Lifting his coffee mug to hide his mouth, he whispered, “What’s got into him? I mean, I was expecting him to say no and maybe throw something, but he’s pretty much made his peace with me seeing Draco, so this can’t all be about—” He side-eyed Hermione, whose lips were stretched into a vacant smile, her unfocussed gaze on Ron’s face.
Draco goes first, one eye on Harry above him even as he scans the ground below. Harry’s coordination is clumsy at first, but by the time they reach the fourth floor he’s steadied, and Draco’s able to pick up the pace. Running out of rungs for his feet requires some awkward use of upper body strength but he manages it, lowering himself one rung at a time until he’s dangling from the last, about the length of his own height between himself and the ground. The drop is bone-jarring but painless. There’s a wheeled bin a few feet away that would probably make Harry’s drop a little easier; Draco attempts to get it rolling with a hard lean against one side as Harry suddenly freezes, three rungs from the bottom.
"Right. Yeah." Potter looks down at the bag. Closes his fist around it and stuffs it back into his pocket. He nods, almost to himself. “Well, it's good you know how to take these, though. I wouldn’t suggest Apparating with them—”
“I know,” Harry said.
The smell of Draco’s hair roused him, the perfect fit of Draco’s back to his chest. Harry tightened his arm around Draco’s midriff with drowsy pleasure, and tucked himself closer. The ever-present space between them in bed was gone for the first time, without warning, but Harry was unsurprised.
“It’s too late,” he says. “I love you.”
“I was too intent on stomping your face to pay much attention,” Malfoy said. “What’s—? This material is—” He let it slide through his fingers, the ghost of reverence on his face.
Harry shook his head, and Draco jerked his chin, an order —
“Say it,” Harry says. He scrapes his teeth along the tendon at the curve of Draco’s neck. Prickles of pleasure skitter up the tops of his thighs, his balls drawing tight.
Harry starts, almost tipping the pot of porridge in his surprise. Malfoy’s standing disturbingly close to him, trainers on and hair brushed. The nearly invisible growth of stubble over his jaw that Harry only noticed a day ago is gone. Harry gestures to the stove, mouth dry. “I didn’t hear you.”
There was a beat of blank silence. Draco’s smile took on a perplexed slant, then faded abruptly, his foot already drawn from Harry’s hand, his body already stirring the water. He kissed Harry hard, plastering against him, wet shaking hands finding his hair and gripping it. His tongue curled into Harry’s mouth and he groaned, the sound as heated as the room around them, and then softer, turning into a bubble of laughter that had Harry’s heart skipping three beats in a row.
Both of the elves automatically seek out Narcissa. Eyes on Hermione, one corner of Narcissa’s lips twitches, lifts, and then Narcissa dips her chin with a nod so short, Hermione might think she imagined it, if she hadn’t been watching so carefully.
Waiting.
But he'd left the silence too long, and Malfoy's sharply-indrawn breath, the squeeze of his hands, felt a warning. "Potter--"
The mirror, the steam, and Teddy and Teddy and Teddy (
Draco flicked him a glance. Immediately looked away. “I showered last night, when you did.” A tiny, warm flush stole over his cheeks. “All I had to do this morning was freshen up..”
Astoria took a step back. “Harry—” She hesitated, fingers rising to toy with the gems of her choker. “Oh, no. Oh, dear. He
in touch?” Harry asked, recalling Draco’s comment about him crying.
Maybe he should just let him sleep.
“Why you think I care is beyond me,” Draco said, “unless you’re comparing the length of time you’ll be playing with how long it’s taking you to put your mouth back on my dick,” a rush from the Delighted Thing in his chest at Potter’s laugh sweeping through him.
something hungry inside him blotting out all of his senses. Potter made a sound of complaint and tilted his head, opening his mouth for Draco’s tongue and fumbling open the tie of Draco’s robe to slide his hands inside. Draco stumbled into him, gasping when he came into contact with the terrycloth of Potter’s towel, hips jerking helplessly to trap his swollen prick between them, and Potter wrenched his head back once more. Fuck Potter and whatever game he was playing,
“You were feeling me out.”
* * *
Shuddering, Harry kissed him, gripping Draco’s tie, his collar, the underside of his knee. Draco’s hands were just as fierce, on Harry’s face, on the back of his neck, in his hair. Both of them dwelling long after they were beyond ready to proceed to other activities — in the alarming hunger that only seemed to grow with each kiss, and in the absurd sense of satiation.
He blew out another breath and Potter made an appreciative sound that had Draco’s heart thudding in lazy circles.
“Ron’s got a lot of scarves,” Potter said, turning away with a fast flutter of his lashes. He exhaled, his chest dipping under his t-shirt. “His mum makes them.”

hair, hips bucking as he gracelessly rode Draco’s face. “Oh f-f—
“It’s a tent.”
Ron whispered on their honeymoon when she teasingly asked him why he loved her. She’d squirmed a little, having expected some ribald comment about sex. He’d still been firm inside her, his cheeks flushed, and he’d pulled her down so they were pressed against each other, her breasts squashed against his chest. His big hands had come up to frame her face.
“Wanted to see if you were actually using the kitchen,” Potter said, squatting briefly in front of the oven to peer inside. He nodded to himself and rose. “You like cooking, then?”
And others, that should have blurred in Harry’s mind, fast and furtive and dangerous, but that he remembered with perfect, painful clarity, alone in his bed at night. Memories that were a bridge from one Saturday to the next.
“It’s fine.” Draco waved a hand. “Come on.”
I was pretty sure I could manage that part, at least.
It travels twelve hundred kilometres away, as Hermione sits down in the Great Hall, her skin still flushed, her muscles still twitching with little zings of pleasure. She eyes Rose and Hugo to make sure they’re behaving themselves and makes a mental note to discuss expanding the family table; as younger witches and wizards are taking on fellowships, more and more children not yet placed in Houses have been taking up occupancy.
“When we settle for the night, I’ll take one of the beads and see about transfiguring your belt,” Harry says tersely. He can’t even look at him, but he can sense Malfoy gearing up to say something, so he holds up one hand. “We’ve got a long way to go. We need to get moving.”
! Just because you don't want me to talk about it doesn't make it irrelevant!”
Spending time with one another, learning how to—” Pink tipping his ears, Malfoy glanced away. “—how to fit into each other’s lives, copulating like rabbits, that’s what this time is for. Historically, anyway.”
Helplessly, Harry rocked into his touch. “You—” he said. Breaking the sentence off — leaving it there, explanation enough.
“It’s…” Malfoy turns a veiled gaze on him. “It’s fine. But it’s not wise to go off without letting the other one know,” he says. “Especially with our resources. I know you’ve got some
“Have you given any thought to who Summoned the Inferi, or for what purpose?”
The first explosion sweeps through Draco’s veins like a Summoning charm, and lights up the warming sky at his back; he guards himself against the energetic lure of the first sensation but can’t stop himself from making sure Harry’s still on his feet. Harry is, stance firm and shoulders set, the air around him filled with fluttering glow-white particles of the magic he used to detonate the first device, pitched as far as Harry could manage. The Inferi on the ground barely seem to notice the sound, but as the discernable glow of Harry’s magic fades into the atmosphere, there’s a sharpening of awareness, and they begin moving away from their position below where Draco stands. He reins in his impatience until Harry’s knocked off and detonated the second device from where the ledge where it was stationed and the Inferi are spilling fast around the corner in search of something to devour, and then he aims Harry’s wand at the vehicle, marshals every scrap of suppressed magic inside himself, and casts the strongest combined general Initiation and Propulsion spells he can muster. The third blast behind him and subsequent glow make it impossible to tell if the vehicle really shifted or if the magic has been eaten by the atmosphere, but Draco casts another spell at it just in case, forcing his magic out of Harry’s wand, and then slams it with every version of Alohomora they’d never dare teach at Hogwarts; he puts Harry’s wand away and starts lowering the fire ladder.
, Draco said, like he had that morning. The word ran over Harry like an incantation that would lead them to
a bit like a kid dressed up in an adult’s clothing, but even he had to admit that he looked the part. He toyed with the tip of his tie, his mind wandering to the feel of Draco’s in his hand. “I spent the day with Greg and I was able to leave with more than a few things.”
Things didn’t improve as the morning wore on; Draco was waspish, irritable, his posture upright and stiff, his responses terse and unfriendly. The day had dawned clear and auspiciously spring-like, sweet with the chatter of birds outdoors, but it felt as though the gloom of the previous week had manifested inside, halo-ing Draco — trailing in his wake. Lingering, even when he removed himself to his room after breakfast.
Pulling himself from the wind’s trajectory, Potter took control of his broom and gentled his land, coming down onto the middle of pitch, unharmed. Draco flew down to meet him.
“Harry,” Teddy says, clearly this time, and Harry closes his eyes against the sting in them.
,” Minerva says.
“Well you’re not
“No.”
“What?”
“I didn’t fill out the form,” he said. “Just so you know. I wouldn’t have ever; I didn’t even want to take part in it.”
The lifts were overrun with the creatures, which left the stairs. Overrun as well, but at least that was partly due to the living. Draco took the stairs three at a time and caught an Inferi with a hand around the throat of one of his teammates. He shouldered it over the bannister and grabbed for Geoffrey’s robes, yanking him along and ignoring his grateful babble.
from — and then he saw Malfoy, was scrambling onto the bed with him, where Malfoy laid unmoving, beyond the shadow of a lift and sag to the blankets over his chest.
His shoulders tensed. “Except that you don’t.”
Granger stares at her for several seconds, frowning deeply. But her voice is level when she says, “Make a list of what you’d like to read and give it to the elves stationed at your door. I do hope you’re a swift reader, though.”
“That’s just what happens to wizards who push themselves for too long,” Malfoy said evenly. “I’m aware. But it only starts as a mild fever. Keep on and you really will get sick. You know, what I do — what I
Harry inches closer on his back, arm shifting above Draco’s head. “Come on,” he says gruffly, clearly reticent.
“So you told your mother we were happy,” Harry said. He touched Draco’s elbow, guided him back around. “And you didn’t think I would back you? Draco—”
“Well—” Potter’s brow furrowed. “I was okay rooming with you after about a week, I guess. And then we ran into each other in the showers and you were wearing that stupid dressing gown like you didn’t realise it clings to your skin when you’re wet and parts a little in the front.”
“My word was that you would get to speak to your son,” Granger says, drumming her fingers against the arm of the chair. “Which you did.”
“I don’t know how boring

“Don't,” Draco says, and for one stark, mad moment, he thinks it’s the only word he
Harry watched him carefully. Draco’s expectations had likely been grandiose, full of the bowing and scraping that befit his status, spoiled little shit that he’d been. But with a disconcerting flash of insight, Harry could see why, beyond that, knowing what to expect would appeal to him. Draco was drawn to the uniformity of things, their order, their virtue; it was why he liked magical repair, why he was so good at it.
Until Molly retched blood into her sink while trying to spell her dishes clean after Victoire’s birthday party:
Harry nodded silently and watched Draco stand. Allowed Draco to pull him to his feet.
of it meant, when it might not have been right, before.
“It may hurt my feelings if you don’t invite me in,” Narcissa says, and smiles.
Harry turned to harangue Kreacher further, but he’d made a slippery escape, leaving him alone once more with Draco. “I didn’t,” he said. “Why would I?”
“Tell me,” Draco says, hips jerking in search of friction. “I'll do it.”
“Why did you come here, Mr Potter?” she asked, eyes narrowing — suspicious; steely. He respected that, too. She said, “What is your business with my son?”
“Do I have to say the ‘thank you’ part?”
“Two years, but—” Malfoy shook his head. “
Draco pulled back, just enough to look at him. “Well, that’s another lesson,” he murmured with a prickly push of his magic against Harry’s palm.
of a fire, sucked clean of oxygen. Twinkling colours danced under the crack of his door, around its edges.
Potter’s mouth twitched, and his gaze sought Draco once more. “Sorry for, um, interrupting.”
“You’re straight,” I tried to point out. It was exceedingly difficult to force the words out, proof of his arousal pressing against my pelvic bone. Obviously, he wasn’t—
With a bleak sort of hope that he could cling to what remained of his dignity (and perhaps sanity), Draco made the attempt to avoid Potter the next day. Unfortunately, everyone’s Saviour seemed to be able to find him anyway. He tracked Draco to the abandoned classroom on the third floor where Draco’d chosen to study, leading Draco to escape through the side door after pretending he didn’t notice Potter’s noisy arrival; suspiciously familiar footsteps followed him to the broom shed when Draco decided to go flying while everyone else was at dinner, and Draco’d been forced to go back into the Great Hall to sit with Blaise.  And after he’d eaten, he was only holed up in Pansy’s private room for an hour when a soft knock came at her door.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Malfoy said, right behind him. Harry jumped, whirled, and Malfoy pulled off the Cloak. His face was flushed and his eyes were bright and elated, but his smile was downright sly. He held the Cloak out to Harry. “I’m sure I could think of some new ones.”
“I swear I haven’t,” Potter said, grimacing. “That I knew of.” He looked at Granger. “This is something you guys talked about?”
Draco huffed a laugh against Harry’s jaw, warm and damp as the water, a surprised sound, sweet and just as dizzying as what he was doing with his finger. The fingers in Harry’s hair loosened, petted it back. “My god, Potter,” he said with another laugh, and rested his forehead to Harry’s nape. Dripping strands of Draco’s hair sticking soft to Harry’s skin, he shook his head. “My god.”
, and Victoire’s, caught between
“Yes, yeah, thank you,” Draco said, with another flustered glance in Harry’s direction.
“You thought I’d start shagging you because you put it on your wishlist?” He spluttered, gesticulating wordlessly, and Draco’s own ire rose, because of
“Lab accident,” Draco muttered, clapping a hand over the hickey. He found his wand and Glamoured it gone.
Because Draco could invite her to visit, along with whoever else he wanted: his Slytherin friends, his horrible father. Anyone from Hogwarts.
, and the objection I’d been about to form was lost in the fray. Potter squirmed a hand down the back of my robes, palm warm on my skin, and I pulled Potter’s leg higher around my hip.
Oh, god. Oh,
“Mrs Malfoy.”
“You should be able to call him, no matter where you are!” Draco grabs his arm, demanding his attention. Harry’s bicep flexes in his grip, his mouth, if possible, going even more immobile, and Draco says, “He’s your elf; you can call him here, he could—”
The first time he’d issued an objection, Harry had given him a hard look before simply nodding and circumventing the commune he’d originally routed them through. He hadn’t even asked why, not that Draco would have been able to explain if his life depended on it, not then. The second time, Draco voiced his objection with a bewildered apology: It was only a collection of four or five houses, after all, with a tiny petrol station on the road leading to it, why
Harry stared at him and Draco stared back, pained and stubbornly proud. The fire spat, fizzling, such a mundane sort of sound, like the whistle of a kettle — out of place in the wake of everything they’d said, and couldn’t say. And then Kreacher popped in, a covered silver tray balanced aloft in each hand, and their gaze broke. Draco looked at Kreacher, and Harry looked at the window to see it was getting light outside. The rich, fatty salt scent of sausage teased Harry’s nose, the earthy smell of coffee. He took the opportunity to collect his scattered thoughts and helped Draco into a sitting position. Draco accepted his aid without comment and settled his tray on his lap.
“Yes, and I can’t say I understand it,” Draco said. “You didn’t used to be like that. Even after the war, I read— You’d give interviews, here and there. Talk about the importance of understanding people as individuals, about how dangerous it could be to apply singular thought to an entire line of thinking; you used to chat with people in the street and walk away smiling. Now you’re a coil of anxiety when you’re not in your Auror robes.”
What Draco had been worried might be a short, easily-resolved game stretched on for hours; three, then four. Some students disappeared, probably for breakfast, but they returned in larger numbers, sitting in the stands and making room for friends from all years who came out to watch.
Malfoy blinks, the high arch of his forehead creasing. “On what?”
Draco fiddled with his cufflink, laced his fingers together over his stomach, and said, “That’s not reason enough? You don’t think she’ll tell anyone.”
“What did you mean?” Harry asks. Draco gives him a sidelong glance.
“Is that really only occurring to you now? A lot of wedded people live apart… if they’re physically capable.” He threw Harry a smug look. “You’re physically capable of more than I gave you credit for, but—”
He was leaving it up to chance, Harry thought. Assuming Harry wouldn’t return to the club, or that he wasn’t serious about the invitation for a dance. Harry was suddenly keen to disabuse him of either of those notions, but he didn’t get the chance; on Friday, Draco didn’t show up.
Ron did, walking in, but at least remembered to Firecall before inviting himself over from then on.
Harry took a step back as Draco pulled her in for another hug, then hesitated. Draco’s left arm had hooked around her back, his hand cupping the outside of her right shoulder. A tight clasp, familiar, warm. Harry blinked and excused himself, taking care he didn’t look to be in a hurry. He closed the arched doors behind him and sagged against them, mind racing. Catching his breath, he headed to Draco’s room, then called Kreacher.
Harry let his smile grow at the challenge in Draco’s eyes when he brought his gaze back up; it fizzed excitedly through Harry’s veins and, like that, made what had felt like a
Draco’s breath leaves him. He looks at Harry in silence, face twisting. There’s pain in his eyes as though he doesn’t know that the upheaval he feels is the kind that leaves everything clean, the kind that turns the earth so a whole forest can take root. Harry strokes down Draco’s lapels, grips them. He slides Draco's jacket off; he lets it drop to the ground.
“Seasonal globe,” Draco corrected. He took it from Harry’s hand and placed it on the low table in front of his sofa. “And no, I’m not and I don’t.” He huffed a laugh, gaze seeking Harry’s once more. “Though a lot of things do seem to escape your attention.”
“Yeah.”
They’d fucked, they’d touched. Harry wasn’t sure why they hadn’t done that, why neither of them had ever initiated it; he liked getting blowjobs, had wondered about giving them.
help.” Granger leans forward, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes.
It broke every agreement between them, spoken and unspoken. Every one, but for the contract that had brought them there in the first place. Harry took a deep breath and kissed him again, and, for a moment, didn’t let himself care.
And Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.
Draco frowns, then slowly lets Potter help him into a sitting position. He manages not to gag getting the potion down and, once he’s fairly confident his head will stay in place, turns to look at Potter. “How did you know where I keep my Hangover Cure?”
“My truths, not yours,” Harry reminds him. “But no, there hasn’t been. I think—” He searches for the best way to phrase it. “I think the only insurmountable thing would have been if we’d…” He doesn’t say ‘died,’ though that’s closer to the truth than anything; his gut tells him they’d have found their way to each other, no matter what. But that’s arguable, and too sentimental. “If neither of us had changed,” he says, working out another truth as he goes, “enough to know each other.”
"Shut it and wank me harder."
” Malfoy said. “It’s your lesson for today: polite greetings and introductions. You’d never address an Auror of the same rank by their last name when coming across them in a social setting.”
“No you’re not,” Hermione said loyally. She took his hand, voice firming. “You’ve got
“They’re Healing plants, right? Revolutionary, you’ve called them,” she says slowly, and takes a breath. “How revolutionary?”
she’d said, mouth twitching at Hermione’s expression after she’d explained that she was stepping back into her former role teaching Transfiguration. Several years running Hogwarts has taken a lot out of her former (and, often, current) idol, Hermione knows, though she sometimes wonders when it really began. Even right after the Battle of Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall, so stalwart until that point, had seemed more frail. Smaller, somehow.
“Oh.” Draco wasn’t really sure how to respond. There had been a long exposé in the
“You can, it’s just—” he yawned again, wider, “—not advisable. I won’t sleep in it. But neither will I be able to at all, if I’m sticky. I wouldn’t expect you to know it, but
“But it’s illegal, isn’t it?” Ron asked. “Since—” He looked to Hermione, who shuffled her papers but didn’t bother referring to them.
. With their marks all over me, their come. The taste of it in my mouth,” Draco says. “You’d lick me clean of it if I let you, is that what you’re saying?”
“It’s something to consider,” Granger says lightly. She waits a beat, and then turns and strides out of the curtain shrouding Narcissa from full view.
"Says my biggest problem," Draco said, but his lips curled up affectionately and Harry smirked.
“I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true,” Parkinson said, that gimlet stare still steady on Harry. “And I have a class this afternoon, and I need to go to the library before then. I’m not scrounging up a gown for
He’d never liked Pansy Parkinson, and maybe he regrets that now, regrets never having made the effort to understand her better, but— she’s just another of the dead, in a long line of them. There’s no reason he shouldn’t be able to dispose of her over the balcony, to get rid of the reminder that’s obviously driving Malfoy mad. He could say he Vanished her if Malfoy asks, could say he Disillusioned her. But in the end, he knows it's not really an option. It feels… unfair not to allow Malfoy to decide. Harry bends and folds the sheet up over her face instead, hiding the stillness of her death and the tenderness implied by her fastidiously brushed hair.
“Pity you weren’t interested when I was,” Draco says, upper lip curling.
There was a beat of silence, and then Hermione sighed and rested her hand against the back of his head. “How long do you need to sulk?” she asked, stroking her fingers through his hair.
In theory, it's true; we tend to work well together in that fashion. When I can concentrate. Which I emphatically
“Because this is a
“Move back in with me,” Harry said, massaging them. He looked at his name on the tapestry when Draco stilled, and then at the first wand he’d made, displayed on the wall near it: hawthorn, the switch taken from the tree outside, and fitted with a phoenix-feather core. A replacement, in honour of the one Sirius had before it had been snapped. Turning back, he said, “I mean it. I want you here.”
Harry came, untouched and overstimulated, Draco pumping into him and holding on, his breath hot against Harry’s back, his groan of pleasure a bolt to Harry's heart.
She shrugged again and Weasley covered his face with his hands. “You’re still
Freeing Harry’s jeans and belt from his fist, he nudges Harry back. More than a few seconds can’t have passed, but timing will be important. Harry nods and this time when he turns, he keeps going, jogging to the other side of the roof as he removes the remaining devices from his jacket. Draco watches until he reaches the girders, before looking away, still breathless but oddly composed. Inferi are so tightly clumped around the service tunnel, they look like a single, writhing mass; their numbers are so great, the ones on the outskirts edge into the perimeter of the hardstand. Otherwise, it’s mostly vacant of them, drawn as some of the Inferi have been over to where they could sense magic, and there’s a not-insignificant crowd of them grouped just below. Draco waits.
Draco turned with a sigh. He sneered at the disgusting little creature and raised his shears in threat . "Go back to your hole, gnome. I'll do more than spin you."
“There’s been too much between us for anyth—”
” Harry stands without meaning to, a nervous, disbelieving movement. His throat works; his eyes are hot. “
“You din’t mean to,” Rose says innocently. Hermione doesn’t know whether that exoneration of her parenting skills makes it better or worse. Rose meets her eyes, a subtle tension flickering over her features. “You— you always say never to hurt anyone on purpose…”
at him. He cleared his throat. “You can follow in ten.”
He held out his hand and Summoned his fallen broom to go, but it fell right out of his grip, Potter abruptly grabbing his waist and dragging him forward. Draco froze, a swell of sound around them, sharp inhales and murmurs, and Potter brought Draco’s head down an inch to kiss him. Stunned, Draco let it go on too long before he remembered to pull away. But Potter didn’t let him speak, just kissed him again and again, small, hard kisses over his mouth and cheeks and, when Draco tried to pull away once more, his jaw and ear.
Harry gestures impatiently. “Stop it, we’re supposed to be telling the truth about each other, here.”
Sometime after dawn, the screams quieted.
Hastily, Ron says, "Both of you, I mean, yeah. Both of you. Yeah, you… We just got you into a room before anyone got hurt, put up," he clears his throat, "charms, to prevent—"
“I know.”
Fucking hell.
Draco shuddered, that Terrible Thing so big now he thought he might be ill. “You think
Draco searches Harry’s eyes, his guarded expression slipping away. “At least a few more days,” he says, smiling a bit.

“Going to a costume party?” he asked, in a harder tone than he meant to. He cleared his throat when Malfoy didn’t answer. “What do you want?”
Harry’s heart skips, twice — a funny little hiccuped beat. He looks at the stars and says, “That’s exactly what I thought, too.”

he’d said.
“Ah.”
Draco blanched, and clasped it, ticking Harry another little befuddled look as they shook. He said, “Potter’s the one who invited you.”
Maybe.
Or, fine, I hadn't
A helpless sound tore from Harry’s throat as his dick gave an enthusiastic jump, the head rubbing against the damp spot leaked into his pants; Malfoy’s gaze shot up to Harry, unblinking, the shape of his mouth forming a small ‘o’. Harry put his hand tight against his dick through his jeans, pressing the base with the mound of his palm until the hard-edged ripple of desire working through him faded to a manageable level.
“An hour ago,” Harry said, with a caustic laugh that burned his throat. “And apparently I’m practically engaged! I’ve bought rings! But I’m not quite so engaged that I’m off the market! Which Astoria — who told me to send her thanks, when I called her — said
in those contracts he could use.
this. Oh, no. Oh,
Malfoy’s head twitches and the poisonous gleam disappears from his eyes. In a blink, he deflates and becomes a sad blend of vacant and weary. He takes another step back, head bowed, the damp hair of his fringe hanging. Eyes on the ground, he skirts past Harry and heads over to the rocks, where he bends to retrieve his clothing. Harry follows to stand beside him and takes the blanket when Malfoy silently passes it to him. Malfoy rises and stays still for a moment, clutching his clothes to his stomach.
“It’s defensive.”
“It was the worst thing I’d ever felt.” Draco’s voice dropped to just above a whisper. “Wanting you and having you and hating you, all at the same time. But the hating you made it— easier, better. And you couldn’t even let me keep that. So perfect you even stopped to feed starving sparrows. I love birds, I don’t know if I’ve told you that.”
But that doesn’t stop the wanting.
“Only because—”
“None of that’s true,” she said distractedly. Draco gave her a black look, and Pansy huffed a sigh. “I mean—”
Propping his head on his arm, Harry rolled to study her. She’d unbound her hair from the ribboned plait she’d been wearing upon her arrival; it trailed over her shoulder and arm, curling into the dip of her waist, and made her look about fourteen again. Harry smiled. “You knew about Fearful?”
, Harry almost brandished his wand at her again. Draco huffed. “And why aren’t you wearing a Muggle gown, I asked you to wear a Muggle gown,” he said, and Harry finally understood that Draco and Parkinson were speaking at cross-purposes. He made note of the incongruity of her dress: Muggle jeans and a Hello Kitty t-shirt. A far cry from witch robes or the pleated skirts and knee socks she so favoured in school.
Harry looked around and spotted the book on the table at Draco’s side of the bed. Harry crossed the room and picked it up; it was bookmarked with a folded sheet of parchment, and Harry opened it to the page, already knowing what he would find.
Green coverlet, purple pyjamas. White sheets, and white pillows.
“It’s your own fault, you know,” Draco said as they walked up the stairs to his studio. “You don’t want to hurt their feelings.”
“The chess set,” he said, nudging it with his wand. It was a good find, one Draco was particularly proud of. Older sets were more devoted but grew weaker over time, and this one’s base was made of a fine, gleaming black walnut, inlaid with charms for heightened loyalty. Its pieces were rendered in ebony wood, for courage and purpose, and maple, for ambition and achievement. Draco liked it so much, he’d almost decided to keep it for himself.
,” he said, words almost running over themselves in his haste, “
Sirius said when Harry was fifteen, disgust in his voice. He hadn’t opened the door that had appeared, instead throwing an arm over Harry’s shoulder and giving a comforting squeeze, as though Harry was the one who’d been unnerved.
bizarre:
Harry nods. Tilts his chin up and kisses Draco; parts his lips for the teasing fuck of Draco’s tongue. It’s hushed, measured, and closer to what Harry imagined might distinguish him from Draco’s other lovers — but no more or less exquisite than taking Draco’s prick into his mouth had been, on his knees in the shower; no more or less special than the feel of Draco fucking into him, so hard and fast he can still feel it.
“Right, because
Harry closed his eyes against it, the raw honesty almost painful — something Draco had demonstrated but never admitted to. Harry hadn't known how much he needed to hear it, or how lonely he'd felt, out on the limb by himself. He'd been lonely for so long it had become second nature. A habit, unfair of him when he had so much, and he'd taken worrying the feeling as one might like sore tooth with their tongue, the snap of nerves its own sort of company. And he could feel Draco's loneliness, too, in his confession. That same wound Harry had lived with, watching the people he loved move on with their lives,  knowing his differences might preclude him from doing so. He opened his eyes to find Draco watching him, heavy-lidded. Harry tipped his head for another kiss, careful, slow. “Sweet,” he said roughly. “D’you see?”
There was a tiny, thoughtful frown concentrated between Draco’s eyebrows. He studied the ceiling and fondled Harry’s prick absently, detached. Like he couldn’t hear the uneven change to Harry’s breath, and was completely unaware that Harry was starting to get hard.
Oh fuck, they were really going to—
Harry grunts. “I will if I have to. But I think the timeline she gave us was significant. I’ve been wondering if activating the coin before that deadline could put everyone at Hogwarts in danger. I know they’re monitoring their magic usage because anything over a certain amount is a risk to the wards, and the coin uses a lot of energy. I think she’s got some defensive magic woven into it.”
“No.” Draco turned around, his glare at Ron more of an interruption than his hard denial. He strode to the coffee table and picked up a quill resting atop a sheet of parchment, then scrawled something at the bottom with an angry flourish. He threw the quill back down; it clattered, bounced off the table. Draco’s eyes glinted at him. They looked like the block of knives from the kitchen before Draco had tended to them — blades exposed, a shiver of air away from lethal. “Because nothing,” he said grimly. “If you’ll excuse me.”
Harry watched and listened until they faded, then removed himself to his room, his shower, his bed. Frustrated,
“It’s a favour for Granger,” Malfoy said, conveniently leaving out the rest of their terms. But, much to Harry’s surprise, that was enough to shut down Zabini’s next objection. His broad shoulders came down a little and he pursed his lips, but nodded. Malfoy snapped his fingers impatiently, then held out his hand. “I need your— thing, what is that. Your mobile.”
“Fuck.” Harry felt Draco’s lips twitch against his ear. Felt the stiff line of his erection against his arse, through his dressing robe and boxers. His own cock began to harden, rising from the placket of his pants so swiftly it left him lightheaded. Harry canted his hips, grinding back against him, and Draco wound his arm around Harry’s ribs with a grunt. He rolled his hips lightly, curiously. Harry gasped, “
“It’s fine,” Potter says. When Draco still doesn’t move, his jaw hardens, voice roughening. “For fuck’s sake, I used yours once, didn’t I?” He starts to turn. Stops. Without looking back at Draco he says, “Be quick about it; you need to eat. Call me if you need any help,” and strides away, leaving Draco alone in the doorway with his wand.
Hagrid’s hut was visible through the trees but Harry went with it, clenching his fingers in Malfoy’s soft hair and fixing his eyes on the scatter of white-blossomed Asphodel spilling from Malfoy’s basket to the forest floor. Until then, they’d only kissed and used their hands on each other, or worked out a good rhythm to rub against one another, half-undressed and panting.
“Are you—” Draco stares at him, offence and disbelief warring with each other. “Are you under the impression I didn’t fight because I was
’” Draco considered. “I suppose he does do that one well enough. And it’s not as though plenty of people wouldn’t stand in line to fix his glasses for him. He really should consider eye charms, you know, the way people go on and on about his green eyes. As though they’re so special, when they’re not.
Harry met his eyes. “I want you to have it,” he said again.
Potter didn’t return until after dinner on Christmas Eve, when Draco’s nerves were stretched tight. They’d been studying Entertainment in Muggle Studies before the break, and all day he’d felt like those blokes at the circus who swallowed blades and walked over hot coals. When first reading about them, Draco had wondered if they were tapping into magical abilities, subverting the Statute somehow. But one of them had given an interview, and he’d said,
How much else about Malfoy did he not know?
Harry glanced over his shoulder, the chaos of want building in him at those two words, at what they implied. But it would mean detaching from Malfoy, at least long enough to walk a few steps from the tree to Malfoy’s flat rock, and he was hit with a flash of worry that in the time it took, one or both of them would change their mind. Harry couldn’t even remember making up his mind to begin with, just that course of heat from his scalp to his toes flushing through him when Malfoy went to investigate the bicycle, then turned on Harry with a grin that looked like Christmas morning.
“There were stories in the papers, when you were younger, that you and Mr Potter were romantically involved.”
in love, remember? You rejected
“But that’s
“Burnt banana-and-butterscotch tarte tatin,” she said, “with rum and raisin ice cream. When he arrived, your partner asked for whatever in our selection someone who loved treacle tart might enjoy. This is very sweet — but divine. Will he not be joining you?”
Studying the stiff line of Draco’s shoulders, Harry responds with a pointless nod. "But, later," he says with uncharacteristic insecurity, "if you're willing... there's something I want to show you."
Draco finally squirmed. Harry let his legs fall open and propped himself on his elbows, watching Draco pull himself up with a hand on the edge of the mattress.
“Just for everything else?”
“No. I don’t want you there,” Draco said, voice abruptly weary, bitterness drained away. His expression had shifted like a faultline; or at least Harry felt it that way — running jagged across his heart. “I never wanted you there. I’ll keep them to the study, you’ll have full run of your house. I don’t want you there. Greet them tomorrow and go.”
“I don’t think the word ‘just’ is very applicable in whatever you’re about to say,” he said, but covered her hand with his anyway. Hermione took a breath and squeezed his knee. Took another and pulled away, her chair creaking as she leaned back in it. She fiddled with the fluffy curls slipping from the clip that held her hair back for a moment and, intensely uncomfortable, Harry laced his fingers together on his lap, resisting the urge to apologise, to take it back. Waiting her out.
Out of breath a while later, Draco panted, “I don’t think you need potions yet, but remind me to ask Kreacher to get some specialty salves in the morning.”
Malfoy scooted his chair further back and stood. Temporarily paralysed, Harry watched Malfoy walk away down the length of the dining table, his breath a gentle rise and fall under his ridiculous shirt. He stopped at the end of it, three fingers of one hand splayed over the corner drape of the tablecloth, his head bowed. His hair had grown a bit, but Harry’s eyes immediately sought Malfoy’s crescent scar, his dark freckle.
“Humps for ½ mile,” Draco said, then irritably snapped, “and the snail is
“Are you rationing?” he asks, mid-chew.
Stunned, Harry stepped away. He glanced over his shoulder, then stepped back and crouched down. “
, we even,
“And what do you want to hide from, Potter?” Draco cocked his head at a curious tilt and gazed at him through lowered lashes, so inviting a picture, a burst of adrenaline hit Harry, like the ones he got when he was cornered in a wand fight.
"Watch me." Hermione has to swallow. It occurs to her that without the rage lining her heart, her magic might wisp uselessly into the atmosphere. That if it doesn't, she could do real harm to those living in the castle. The knowledge should incentivise her to lower her wand. But she can't. "Yes.
Drinks arrived, two whiskies Harry’d barely heard Malfoy order. Malfoy hurriedly took a long swallow of his and, confused, Harry followed suit, silent when Malfoy set down his drink and cleared his throat. “Those things leave scars, you know. Bad enough having one on my arm, I’d be terrified of getting one on my cock.”
Midday has well come and gone by the time they break. Draco, by then in a numb sort of zen state of those thoughts looping around in his mind, is surprised when Potter brings up a hand to touch his wrist. He jerks away and Potter displays his palms. “Whoa. Sorry.”
Despite that, Blaise’s shit comment and Pansy’s shit counsel were what had kept Draco from pulling his wand upon seeing Potter at work, when every raw, jangling nerve he possessed was screaming it was the only appropriate action. Taking a deep breath, Draco stared at Potter silently, and kept himself from getting into an unnecessary duel by simply… committing to the idea that he had no clue who Potter was.
Eyes trained on the far wall, Harry says, “I don’t know,” and hears Draco scoff under his breath.  “I don’t. I just — fuck, ow —” he blows out a hard breath “— somehow knew you’d got… lost, needed my help. I followed the thread of that thought to find you, but it resulted in… that.”
“That’s what you were doing,” he says. He gestures abstractly at the hall, unable to tear his gaze from Draco’s face. “That’s why you took so long.”
” Harry says, tersely enough that, after only another moment’s pause, he hears Malfoy start moving about the room for the few things not in Harry’s bag. Harry waits, distractedly taking and shrugging on his jacket when Malfoy nudges him in the shoulder with it, staring down at the coin all the while. It’s gone orange-white with heat, which means Hermione and Ron must be utilising a lot of magic to contact him; the coin only heats as quickly as the messages can be sent, which is not very. Its temperature running so high, so fast, goes beyond ‘urgent enough to use’ and straight into ‘listen to me right the fuck now’ territory. Appropriate, considering the magic itself might signal the fuckers outside.
The sweep of her lashes fluttered and she looked up at him, her brow knitting, but she was cut off by Draco before she could respond.
“I do what?”
“It’s a possibility,” Potter says. He takes another drink and tucks his wand away with a grimace. Draco broke his wrist as a child but still remembers how infuriating his limited mobility had been before the regenerative potions took effect, and he doesn’t envy Potter’s journey without such help. He’s decently skilled with practical Healing — all Unspeakables need to be — but magic would put those skills to shame. Potter runs his fingers through his hair and sighs. “Still, I think we’re better off risking that than sleeping where we know people are.”
“You get plenty of opportunities for ‘flattering,’” Draco says with another, more half-hearted, scowl. “If you wanted that—”
“Let them miss me,” Harry murmured against his mouth. He fucked his fingers into Draco, rubbed his thumb in small circles against his perineum, felt his own massage through delicate layers of skin and muscle. Draco broke out of the kiss, hips juddering, a deep whine humming in the back of his throat.
, and
“You fuck around, too,” Draco says, a dark cast to his face. “You’re not so pure as you like to pretend.”
“Or you’ll what?” Narcissa sighs and, setting the photograph upright amongst the others, considers the potential irony in alienating the girl further now that the threat of her has been effectively neutralised and she might be of use. She gentles her voice. “Come now, Hermione, do you really believe I would lower myself to come to your residence just to taunt you?”
“About time,” Draco said, snorting. Harry stole into his space, crowding Draco into the corner of the stall, breath held expectantly. Draco’s gaze flicked over his face, and he murmured, “You’re covered with oil.”
“Use me,” he says. He hesitates only a moment, heart thundering, before pressing a soft kiss to Harry's unresponsive mouth; pulling back, he tries to push whatever warmth exists in him to Harry through the blown-open link. “Use me. However you need.”
— and sat down when it hit the backs of his knees. He crossed one leg over the other and wandlessly unbuttoned his robes to loosen the pressure across his chest. Then he propped his chin on his fist and gazed at her.
It was fast when it happened, and not what Harry had wanted. Not in the dark in Draco’s bed, or in the study with his lips against Draco’s ring, or the dozens of times when his only defense had been to tell himself it meant nothing. Those wants were still nameless, waiting, subject to the countless obstacles he hadn't let himself examine too closely yet. But, rocked rhythmically against the floor, Draco’s cock sliding exquisitely against his own, Harry’s head spun, and he held on, and wanted for nothing else. Spinning, with that same sense of vertigo he’d felt at the top of the stairs — of falling from great heights, of being caught.
Harry looks at Draco’s bed hangings, a toile pattern in rich navys and silvers depicting a wizarding home being built, and runs his hand down the line of Draco’s back. Traces the rungs of Draco’s ribcage.
He’d never known to
Taking a deep breath, Harry reclaims the space between them. Draco flinches but allows it, and Harry rings his fingers lightly back around Draco’s wrist. Turns Draco’s hand palm-up.
“So what’s special about it, then?” he asked. “For you, I mean.”
Pansy didn’t thank him, perhaps because she knew that Potter’s were better. Objectively, of course. Pansy’s were really more of a green-hazel, whereas Potter’s were a bright clover green with a starburst of amber around the pupil. Very compelling, like the works of modern art they’d been examining in Muggle Studies; something a person could forget their own name, looking at.
A low, hard gasp falls from Draco’s throat. He slides his free hand over his thigh and between his legs, massaging over the bulge of his balls for a moment before moving it lower, lower, just to where Harry’s ordered. He curls in slightly to allow for better reach, stomach muscles flexing, and then he taps his hole a few times with his middle finger.
“You can’t steal something that
, finally,
Harry watched the slender line of his lips, the relaxed cords of his neck and the turned position of his head on his pillow, and said,
“Oh, am I allowed to talk again?” Harry asked. “I wasn’t sure.”
“—she helped one of them,” Harry said. “Who told another, and another, until a lot of them were seeking her help. And then someone who’d been— monsterous to her, the leader of a subset of the group she was helping, approached her.” Harry shot her a look, caught her staring fixedly down at her files, face pink and shuttered. “But not for himself; for a friend of his. Someone else who didn’t deserve her help, but needed it.”
“So Longbottom has made me aware. Yet that was not my question.”
The fact that Malfoy was right didn’t make Harry any less curious about what, exactly, it was that Malfoy offered, but he shook his head. “No, it’s personal. A personal issue.”
want everyone coming up to me with apologies or— or congratulations and praise. I hate that. But an apology from you?”
“Hermione.” She tips her head at Minerva. Smiles. “Professor McGonagall.”
, what the smacking sounds like?
“Probably would have even before I heard them,” Harry said unapologetically.
Harry thought of it in the morning, when Ron stepped through the Floo, and then Hermione, both of them smiling — thought of the wand calluses on Draco’s index and middle fingers sliding over the sensitive inside of his wrist, and how Draco had known what to say, and how he’d been right. Thought of how he hadn’t even thanked Draco for the milk or the company, or the reassurance he hadn’t known he’d needed.
, Potter had stood in front of the sinks for a good long time, carefully using a shaving charm before the mirror that Draco could do in his sleep — which was probably why Potter’s jaw was always slightly darker than it should be — without bothering to put on a dressing gown first.
Draco pursed his lips. “More,” he said, short and cryptic, and pulled on Harry’s arm.
But no. Replaying it in his mind, Draco can’t discern if it had been rejection or mere indecision on Potter’s face. Either way, Draco feels an utter fool for having made such an offer, despite the knowledge that still streaks up and down his spine when he feels Potter glance his way.
“Thank you,” he said again. “Go away now.”
Despite the directive, Draco wanders to stand a few feet away. It’s close enough that, for the moment, Harry doesn’t feel the need to follow, and since Draco doesn’t seem to expect him to, Harry stays where he is. The phone is heavy in his grip, Draco’s admission heavy in his mind.
Harry stepped closer. “Can I invite myself?”
“Oh Christ,” Harry heard as he began to suck. Draco groaned, a deep, rough sound, and Harry hummed with satisfaction, tonguing around the head of Draco’s prick each time Draco’s hips fell back to the sofa. Letting his throat relax each time Draco pushed back in. He’d forgotten how rawly powerful it could feel getting on his knees, and there was something especially compelling about doing it for
Malfoy recovered first. “Potter,” he drawled, just as the silence began to stretch into the territory of awkward. “Granger sent you?”
“That she was a Slytherin, I think,” Harry said, eyes on the creamy, precarious tilt towering above the rim of Draco’s crystal serving dish. “That maybe Teddy will be, too.”
to like each other, do we?” Malfoy said. His thumb danced over Harry’s slit, spread the precome around the head. Harry shuddered in response, blinking in a room blurry with faded colours as the first beams of sunrise spilled through the window. Hating Malfoy for being right.
see, as if he might be able to strip Draco nude if he just looks at him hard enough. He uncurls the blanket from around him, tossing it off onto the pillows at his back, and seeks relief with one hand, watching as Draco’s chest hitches. Harry strokes his cock — carefully. “And then you want it so hard.”
"Bill," Malfoy said flatly. “Weasley. Well, by all means, we should wait to hear back before doing it again, in case he thinks we’ve done it enough. Honestly, Potter."
Draco was stiff at first, overcompensating the way he had a tendency to do, and Neville didn’t bother to hide his doubt, as wary of Impeccably-Mannered Draco as he’d ever been about Arsehole Malfoy — “It’s like being at my gran’s house, only with someone who I keep expecting to criticise everything I… It’s like being at my gran’s house,” he muttered as Draco was pontificating on the importance of Herbology. When Neville removed himself to the loo after lunch, Harry told Draco he was giving them both the creeps; Draco huffed but stopped sitting like he had a broom shoved up his arse, and turned the conversation to Quidditch.
“You— Are you allowed to tell me that?”
“Ukrainian Ironbelly,” Ron said, side-eyeing him.
She supposes Ronald Weasley could have inherited the odd gene from the Prewetts, who are born — in most cases — possessing a level of discernment above everyone in the Weasley line combined, but Narcissa’s observations of him over the years give her cause to doubt it. Which is… curious.
Maybe Malfoy understands that he needs to take in sustenance slowly; maybe he doesn’t want Harry to get as weak with hunger as Harry guesses he’s been. Either way, Harry’s oddly touched, and he doesn’t argue. They crunch on the slightly-stale crackers for a few minutes in silence. Secure in the room, it’s almost easy for Harry to tune out the foreboding sounds of the Inferi in the hallways and outside. Like having music on in the background as he does paperwork. He eyes the way Malfoy nibbles around the edges of his crackers and pauses intermittently to take sips of water from the empty bottle Harry’s filled. It’s a bit weird to pass the water back and forth. It reminds Harry too much of sharing the last bottle of beer with Ron, and when Malfoy’s finished off his crackers — long after Harry’s done — Harry waves off the offer of another drink from Malfoy's extended hand.
“Mmm,” Draco says, voice going low, his knuckles rubbing down the trail of hair on Harry’s stomach. He grips both their pricks together in one elegant, long-fingered fist. His eyes are dark. “Like that?”
“It makes an adjustment every ten minutes,” the man tells her. His face is wreathed with exhaustion. “It’s been getting steadily darker for the last half hour.”
Tracked down at breakfast by the paps who demanded an answer from Harry, and then Draco again, however, Draco’s smirk had faded:
questions, or were you going to accept my terms anyway?”
“Can’t hear that enough,” Harry muttered, slumping back in his chair.
“Y-yes?”
There were wards set on Draco’s bedside drawer. Harry ran his hand over the scarred wood, felt the creak of the wards fall. Heard the clatter of something rolling, loose, inside.
“It’s heavily wooded,” Draco says, before taking a drink. His pause lasts longer than he means for it to, the water delicious and soothing to his parched mouth, and Potter nods.
you?”
Draco yawns and stretches, lazy as any cat, his slender, pale biceps bunching, and peeks one eye open to see if Harry means it. Harry tries to look serious, threatening even, but after a beat Draco sends him a cocky grin and fists a hand in Harry’s shirt, pulling him down. His kiss is sloppy on Harry’s cheek, warm and damp. Harry swallows the stone in his throat as he straightens.
* * *
“All of those, too.”
None of them. I’m Draco Malfoy, lalala.
found work so enjoyable. “I love my job,” he said softly, “but it’s probably time I stopped letting it decide my entire life.”
Potter straightened, blinking. He nudged his glasses up. “What?”
Draco found it, but didn’t open it, curling bone-china white fingers around darker, creamy vellum. “What is it?” he said again.
Turning away, he gathers up Teddy’s soiled pyjamas from the floor — Malfoy’s clothes are nowhere in sight — and trudges back out. He detours to Teddy’s room to strip the bed and remake it with clean linens, then carries the laundry downstairs to put in the wash, delaying the inevitable just a little bit longer. As glad as he is Teddy has so many people who care about him, there’s something about seeing someone else meet his needs so easily that throws Harry’s inabilities into stark contrast. Something about it that makes him ache, deep inside.
But it actually
“Problem?” Draco asked.
The magazine fluttered, slithering off Draco’s legs to the floor. “Yes,” Draco said.
Which meant at least one thing: Draco, wherever he was, wasn’t hurt. Harry could take his time figuring out the rest.
form! McGonagall’s just informed me that no, despite not actually signing up, I’m still beholden to participate. Which means I’ve got to buy presents for—”
Draco gasped, “Make me— Uhhh,
“That’s what you think of me, isn’t it?” is what came out instead. “You think I—” His voice cracked.
I’m stuck
“Um, Greg?”
Walking as though carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, Harry leads them to a dodgy set of trees that might shield them from sight, but won’t do much to protect them from the blustering winds and mercilessly pelting downpour. In the mud and without much cover, their set-up takes them well into the twilight hour or perhaps beyond — it’s hard to tell when, precisely, the sun sets. Once they’re done, they crawl inside with sighs of relief and, in silent accord, strip down to their pants. Soul-weary and shivering, Draco sits unmoving as Harry casts drying charms over them, and huddles close under the blanket Harry spreads over their shoulders. They share a tin of barely-warmed soup and finish off a package of biscuits together.
Draco made an irritated sound, as though Harry ought to be aware there were distinctions. “
“Bill,” Draco said flatly.
“Hello.” Harry slipped an arm around Draco’s waist and felt him freeze — could practically hear the terrifying speed of his thoughts. But when Draco lifted his head, whatever shock he’d felt at Harry’s presence had rearranged on his face to better resemble the frustration that matched his tone. Harry said, “I didn’t have as much to do as we thought. I hope it’s okay if I join you for lunch.”
“I’ve got the original paperwork you signed when I relinquished it into your care,” Harry said. “And I’ve already cast a
, Harry thought, trying to shake off the thought of putting himself in Malfoy’s— anything.
In a far less surprising turn of events, our very own saviour, Harry James Potter, was named in the statement as his mentor’s interim successor, and our same anonymous sources claim he's all but guaranteed to take over the position permanently. We at the
“Yeah.”
,” Harry said, dropping his feet from the desk, his magic boiling up from his centre. Tensing for action.
“It’s Wednesday afternoon.”
There are a thousand ways Draco could interpret that other than as the promise it feels like, and it’s a twist of the knife Draco’s got embedded next to the heat building inside him. But ultimately, he knows his own guilt won’t deter him. He and Potter are going to have each other again. The awareness of it slides up his back like the whisper of a lover to settle on his shoulders as sure as the perfect fit of the jacket Potter picked. The knowledge isn't even so much shocking as just
“Blaise runs one side of the shop,” Draco explained. “And Greg runs the other. Well, works there. They own it together, but Greg’s never been particularly… business-minded.” He lowered his voice and leaned in, firmly taking Harry by the elbow once more, and this time Harry didn’t object. “He just enjoys creating things,” Draco said, “always has. But his father was a bit of a shit about how appropriate a hobby that was for his only son, and when he died a few years ago in Azkaban, Blaise offered him a job designing and making… specialty attire. It got so successful, so fast, that Greg was able to buy into the business.”
Rather than the flinty accusation Draco expects to see, Potter’s green eyes brighten further. He turns his face away and clears his throat, sounding husky when he says, “Right. Unspeakable. Alright, then.” He swallows and rolls his head from side to side with a long exhale. Taking something out of his pocket, he pops it in his mouth and says, “Stay here; you’ll know quick enough if the spell is an attracter.”
the dandruff from those who don't condition, the sludge they're serving for lunch in the canteen, the Alphas who look your way and get hard. It nauseates you, makes you gag, makes you bare your teeth in a silent snarl.
"Can I assume from the distance you’re keeping that you signed?” Draco asked, and Harry took a breath.
, enough to take what he wanted and damn the consequences.
All of which may or may not have left Draco feeling oddly unmoored during his first several months at work, but amused Pansy and Blaise to no end, and did wind up being extremely helpful in separating the old Potter from the fit-yet-annoying stranger who began popping down to his lab all the time with coffee, inane questions, and the occasional humorous observation. And it continued being helpful — “I told you so!” Pansy sang, before frowning and asking Draco something stupid about what kinds of beverages Potter brought to which overworked techs every Tuesday and Friday, and why he would do that, as if ingratiating oneself as a friendly Auror with the technicians who did the real work solving their cases wasn’t reason enough — right through to Potter’s twenty-seventh cup of coffee. That one was significant only for the fact that it was splashed all over the floor before Draco got to take a single sip, and because Potter was ranting at him, his newfound composure fully breached.
“Someone I don’t really know,” Potter said quietly. He coughed. “A Hufflepuff.”
For a beat, Harry considered confessing that he’d simply had trouble deciding on what to wear from the new abundance of choices in his wardrobe. “An orphanage, actually. I got fifteen children out, then stayed to help them rebuild. They named the new building after me.”
With a subtle thinning of his lips, Potter slants him a glare and folds up the map. Mildly, he says, “Hermione doesn’t assume I’m an idiot, but thank you for that.”
Pansy finally looked up, irritation wrinkling the bridge of her nose. “Not as much,” she said stiffly, “if you’re implying—”
Draco’s answers to the same question were,
“It’s Master Malfoy,” he said with a negligent wave of his hand, the ruffles of his cuffs falling back. The bones of his wrist were elegant, his skin so pale Harry could make out the trails of his veins underneath. “But that’s quite all right, Kreacher. And whatever you’ve ready for dinner is fine as well, though I’d like something real to drink with mine.”
Darting Harry an uncertain look, Draco keeps his hand out, a light, tantalising press under the weight of Harry’s. Like their bodies at night. Trembling. The improbability of the situation makes Harry want to laugh, that in this moment Draco Malfoy feels like all he has. That for all intents and purposes, that's precisely what Draco
“Sure, I could do that. But potions aren’t working on us right now.”
“He—” Pansy curled her fingers around the edge of Draco’s table. A grimace crossed her face. “—can’t.”
“I was being proactive.”
be willing to call happiness — after he examined Potter’s second comment about liking him, later — sizzled its way up his spine. Weasley blinked again.
and only see his own hunger...
“Get. Out. Or I’ll—”
"I mean." Harry stares down at their clothes. Gulps. As though it takes a monumental effort, he says. "It was useful to me, too. But. It's just..."
Fucking Pansy. It really was kind of hot.
before. But the last item listed was the worst:
Draco blows out a breath, more rattled than he should be by Harry’s impotent rage. By the events of the day. He lifts a hand to Harry’s face, forces him ‘round so their eyes will meet.
“What does that mean?”
“That
“—teaching formal dancing less— What the shitting fuck, Potter, put that away!” Draco said, a verbal lashwhip of astonishment. Harry didn’t break her gaze, didn’t move, wanting with every fibre of his being to meet the challenge on her face, but then Draco was standing next to him, one hand exerting ruthless pressure to force Harry’s arm down. “What the hell did you say to him?” he asked Parkinson. But his tone rang with a sort of exasperation so familiar and— and
Harry looked from one to the other, their striking similarities and multitude of differences. Genetic inheritance versus environmental influence; one less complicated to change than the other, but achievable with the right sort of effort. Harry didn’t want to leave them. But then Draco squeezed his forearm again, and leaned in to brush a kiss over the corner of his mouth.
Harry stops so abruptly, Draco’s taken a few extra strides before he realises it. He turns around, tensing at the struck expression on Harry’s face. A strange foreboding snakes through him, pitting in his stomach.
Hermione swallows. She pushes the grief away; it’s been the only way she’s been able to function for the last two days. “I know. My— my kids are safe. And Molly, Arthur. Harry’s alive,” she says, drawing from that and using it to contain the horrible claws of rage and fear in her chest. There are so many unknowns: her parents, Charlie and Percy, most of her friends, her husband. And so many losses that she can’t even make herself consider them. But not Harry, at least. For now. “Harry’s alive. I— The gauge finally dipped low enough that I could send him another message, and I saw him get it.”
There was a pause, and then Draco’s hand slid into view, down his stomach, fingers teasing at his waistband, slipping inside. He cupped his cock, fingers extended around its length, and simply held it under the cover of his pants. “Then you should go, now.”

, Harry could only assume he must have even less hope than he’d originally thought.
“It can’t come from you,” Malfoy continued after a beat. “I’ll need my things. Lovegood will take them from you and set me up— wherever, before she leaves. I’ll Owl as soon as I can.”
“—and that whole thing in the
Harry followed the shift in topic with surprising ease. “Because being here feels like that. To me. Like the mirror did. Except I don’t know why. I don’t care much for mysteries, or jewels or rare things, whatever’s hidden in all of those trunks. But the second I came in here, I felt like—” He hesitated, struggling to put it into words. “I felt like it belonged to me, like I belonged here. Is that— Could that be a curse of some kind? Like the ones you mentioned?”
Dismissing the heavy irony in Granger's tone with an airy wave, Narcissa says, “That wasn’t your doing.” She ponders for a moment. “I wonder, is it a Muggle habit to take credit for someone else’s actions? You’ve been in our world for many years now, at some point you should allow for growth.”
“As I well know.” Harry nodded, assessing her. There was almost nothing about her he liked — but he did respect her love for Draco. He met her eyes. “I’m going to give you some help with that.”
Hermione stares at him. “The elves have lost years from their lives simply keeping the castle going with their magic. The ones volunteering with you have given decades. Are you suggesting we kill them for a phone call?” she asks. “My coin uses less magic, and I can force my own into it. I’ll transmit the time the spell will start, and—”
“Or not,” Malfoy says, profile lit by the sunlight coming in through the door, his expression closed. “Fix that for me, would you? I didn’t particularly appreciate being left outside without a way to defend myself,” he adds. He brushes past Harry and walks out, stopping in Harry’s line of vision. He clasps his hands behind his back and faces the distant horizon. Harry’s exhale feels more like a gasp, the oxygen having turned stale in his lungs.
Draco bolted upright in bed, turning his head from side to side. “
The next day was marginally better; Draco presented him with a buffering charm to wear on a leather cord around his neck, which gave Harry a slight cushion of space. But he still felt unable to simply walk away when he got overwhelmed and didn’t get home until well after dark, so on the third, Draco added a propelling charm to wear next to the first, which reminded whoever wanted to talk to Harry that they had more pressing matters elsewhere, thereby shortening any exchange he had to under thirty seconds.
Harry glances at Draco, surprised. He’s still sitting on the wall but upright now, rigid. Watching. “No.”
to get involved, not where those two were concerned.
Harry was as loose as he was wet now, the ache vanishing, his mind swept free of thought. He reached between his thighs and cupped his balls, rolled them, plucked at his sac and trembled at Malfoy’s gasping, pained, “Ah!”, both of them rutting in tandem. Harry craned his neck, found Malfoy’s glittering stare on him. Malfoy's cheeks burned copper, sweat misting his forehead.
“I—” A wild bark of laughter breaks, roughly, from his throat. “I’m— safe, as you said. Mum," he says, a thoughtless, aching address he hasn't used in more years than he can recall, "why are you at Hogwarts? Are you— helping?”
Draco rolled over beside him: that gentle tug of the covers, a dip in the mattress Harry recognised, delicious as the best sort of secret. “They’d wish they’d razed it to the foundation.” He snickered, then yawned and said, “Now shut it and go away, or go to sleep already,” and Harry Summoned his own blanket, and went to sleep.
it. It didn’t matter that Harry could complete four pushups to each one of his own, that he got winded after jogging in place for five minutes in the middle of the room.  What matters is that Malfoy is as driven as Harry needs him to be, despite the long silences between them, despite the dead girl haunting Malfoy’s dreams.
, you
He says it matter-of-factly, with the sort of confidence that’s impossible to argue against, and strokes his thumb over the back of Harry’s hand. In the cold November air, the warm ghost of his touch lights up Harry’s nerves, and gives him an excuse to recall how Draco had looked on the desk. How tight his fingers had been in Harry’s hair as he’d drawn Harry closer. Smaller demonstrations of generosity have brought better men to their knees. Harry had wanted to go to his, too, and would have, but... hadn’t been able. Too crippled to figure out why at the time, he sought the only catharsis he could that felt like it wouldn’t cause lasting damage. In retrospect Harry thinks it might have had something to do with the balance Draco spoke of, for complex magics. For complex anythings capable of changing you. Everything that works requires a give-and-take, or the system warps and eventually breaks apart.
“I don’t think so,” Harry said, uncertain — babbling. “I think he knows that— I’m sure he just wants to, to make you comfortable, and since he’s been— Well—”
That brings a reluctant smile to Harry’s face. “About food,” he clarifies.
ninety-eights, thank you. I’m entertaining Granger by meeting you tonight, but you’ll have to give me a good reason for actually helping you in any way. I’ve done enough.”
it makes my hips snap harder, my cock poking through my fist, the head rubbing the satin of my duvet. My bollocks tingling, rising to hug my groin. Stop, Draco,
“He told me his name,” Harry said, going back to his chair.
“Maybe you should—”
“Mm. Why Lithuania?” Harry said, releasing Draco’s arm to slide his fingers up to his nipple. He toyed with it, watching it tighten.
Granger’s expression hardens; she hesitates, scowls, and then, stepping back, allows Narcissa entrance into her domain. Narcissa takes the liberty of closing the door on her little spies, and glances around. Though she’s interacted with Muggles and a mix of their offspring on numerous occasions, she’s never before had the time or inclination to examine how they lived. Granger’s parlour is informal, nearly every surface cluttered with books and scrolls in a manner that gives the first impression of disorganisation. But upon Narcissa’s second sweep of the room, she can see how tidy Granger keeps it around the the madness, and the wealth of tasteful details in the decorative approach she’s taken — matching sofas populated with an overabundance of honey-coloured cushions, yet solid enough to last; a winding, copper clock on the mantlepiece surrounded by photographs in rose-gold frames; a secretary desk at least two hundred years old, by Narcissa’s eye, carved with intricate runes and inlaid with cloudy apricot crystals.
— suddenly, and all over. “I’d rather know what sort of things to watch out for, on your behalf, than go through another day like yesterday,” he said, then dropped his voice low. “And, we’d still be— but it’d complicate things less. And then when we can go…”
“So,” Hannah said, cheerful as ever at a mixer a few weeks later, when Draco returned from the loo, “you and Harry are… together?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry blurted, as Malfoy’s eyes drifted shut. “I’m sorry about last night.”
Malfoy had never begged for Harry’s forgiveness, had never even apologised. He could bust down Malfoy’s door and make it Malfoy’s fault with no effort.
“A good host would ask their guest what they’d prefer.”
He doesn't let himself make a sound. And the scent is stronger than the taste; blocking it helps. It clears his head a little.
“That was gross,” Harry said.
“It’s not for me, either,” Draco said, breathlessly. “I can stop doing that.” He left his chair again, this time swooping forwards and coming down onto his knees between Harry’s legs. He put his hands on top of Harry’s thighs, rubbed up and down the fabric of his trousers. “I get… I look at you, and us, and it’s so... I get… I’ll make myself stop," he promised. "And— And I’ll tell you when. When I can hear what you want to tell me.”
The world faceted around Harry into impressions, each of them reflecting off the last. Draco’s arse, tight around him, wet, clinging; a drag of his hips back; the sound in Draco’s throat when Harry rocked back in. Draco’s legs pulling up on either side of his torso, the bunched muscle of his calf resting over the small of Harry’s back. His panting
