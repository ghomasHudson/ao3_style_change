“Who am I to tell you no.” Potter outright snorted at him and Draco flushed glaring at the other boy.
and Draco sneered at him. “Oh, is it. I can push you into someone next time, too, if you think it´s so hilarious.”
Honestly, it was Potter´s own fault. Draco could´ve just as well landed on his hands and knees. At least then he wouldn´t have to deal with Potter and his stupid fucking eyes. Instead of letting him fall Potter had, quick as he was, reached out and grabbed his waist, what ultimately resulted in him sort of dipping Draco.
Neither of them noticed Blaise walking down the stairs to the common room. “What the bloody hell are you idiots doing on the ground?”
He wasn´t really surprised when Potter didn´t look up as he carefully rolled up his parchment and gathered his quills into his bag. When he had everything together and Potter still didn´t look up he hesitated. He resolved himself to say something but was again interrupted, this time by Weasley´s cough.
“Harry’s right, Ron,” Hermione agreed, placing a hand on Ron’s arm. The touch shut him up far quicker than Harry ever would have been able to do with his soothing and he shot Hermione a grateful look.
I don't usually write Harry and Draco out of Hogwarts and in their early twenties, so this is a fun experience for me, imagining them a bit more grown-up with some time between their last interaction! Hope it reads okay!
A long sympathetic pause grew heavy in the air and Draco finally risked a glance towards his best friend, thinking that he might just let what tattered remains of his dignity disappear and hug her. The comfort would be nice.
Then a sudden ‘pop!’ sounded and they quickly broke apart as O’Leary appeared, carrying a large thermos of tea.
“Oh, Merlin, are they going to ask me to do that?” Malfoy asked anxiously, running a hand through his flour-streaked hair. “Is that some sort of ritual at their house, having the latest newcomer cut the turkey and make a complete arse of themselves in front of the whole family in some sort of hazing? Potter, I’ve never carved a turkey. I wouldn’t know where to begin! You’ve seen how rubbish I am with these cookies; what do you think is going to happen where there are knives involved?!”
“Of course, I’m alright. What did you think had happened to me? And why are you here?” Harry asked, deeply confused by his friend’s presence.
“Yes, thank you,” Harry echoed awkwardly, before he followed Malfoy out of the shop, back into the dull roar of the bustling streets. He felt rather drained and almost as if he could use a nap. But Malfoy had never seemed more energetic, a strange gleam in his eyes as he examined their surroundings with purpose.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed as he looked back at Harry, and he brushed snow off of his coat self-consciously.
Harry felt his face flush redder than it ever had before. “What? No. I just-- actually, you see--” he floundered, unsure of why his heart was pounding so fast all of a sudden. “Well, you weren’t exactly looking away!” He finally blurted out, tone accusing and head spinning with confusion. Where had that come from? And what was happening?
Malfoy waved a dismissive hand. “That doesn’t matter. But what does is that I have to spend large portions of the next month around you both and I promise you that it will all be a hell of a lot easier for everyone if you idiots just get over yourselves and go out, for Merlin’s sake!”
Harry watched as Draco practically stormed out of the common room, leaving only the echo of the slammed door as a reminder of his presence. He slumped back against the arm of the couch they had slept on, heart thudding painfully. Why had Draco rushed out like that? Maybe it was because he had expected Harry to end this farce sooner and not have taken up so much of his life.
Harry followed as the Slytherin walked out from the room, leading him through the house, which was just as barren as the room they had come in. Finally, Malfoy stopped in front of a door, hand resting lightly on the tarnished handle. He looked at Harry, biting his lip with something that almost looked like . . . nervousness? Whatever it was, it made Harry’s breath quicken and his heartbeat pound a little harder.
“Ah.” The syllable was left hanging in the air between them, as they both avoided eye contact to deal with their individual shock.
“Really, Potter, I want to tell you.” Malfoy sighed heavily, steps slowing as he gathered his thoughts. “It’s because, well, because of the Dark Lo— I mean, ah, Voldemort.”
Malfoy frowned, taking a sip of the bitter drink. “Sorry, but what is ‘Poker’?” He scrunched his nose with distaste, the gesture uncharacteristically cute for someone with such aristocratic features. It made Harry feel rather dizzy, something strange curling inside of him at the sight of it.
“Yes, Sir.” He answered stepping further into the classroom. “Very well, I´ll have these papers to grade but you can go ahead and clean up the room. You can leave once you´re finished.” The Professor averted his gaze back to his work and Draco sighed. He put his bag down next to one of the cleaner tables and grabbed the first pot to take it over to the sink.
“Are you alright?” Potter´s voice sounded scratchy and quiet and his eyes shifted with embarrassment as he tugged Draco back to his feet. Draco avoided his eyes glancing over his shoulder and meeting eyes with a smirking Weasley. “I´m fine.” He hissed icily glaring more at Weasley than at Potter but pushing off his hands regardless.
“Oh, how nice of you to get help, my dear boy.” If Draco wasn´t busy being terribly offended he wouldn´t have been surprised. So far Potter´s grades had never been worse than his which was a crime in and off itself since the bloody prat had no idea what he was doing at any time.
He made his way to the dungeons as slowly as he could without being late and came to a halt in front of the door to one of the classrooms. Reluctantly he knocked at the door opening it when he heard a soft “Come in”.
Potter gasped at the tugging and leaning back. Draco almost whined at the loss of contact panting softly into their shared breathing space before slowly opening his eyes. His cheeks filled with warmth when he was met with emerald eyes solely fixed on him.
Draco hadn´t had the chance to speak to Pansy before Slughorn showed up but he´d sat next to Blaise in protest and kept sending light stinging hexes at her back. Unfortunately, Potter had decided to sit directly behind him and he could feel the git staring at him all through the lesson.
They were both breathing hard the kiss mostly tongues and teeth. Harry pulled their hips together again rutting up into the movement. They both groaned at the friction and Draco tugged at dark hair when Potter broke the kiss to suck at his neck.
He was still lying awake on his bed after every one of his roommates had gone to sleep, dreading the next day. At roughly two in the morning he found himself wondering if Potter was down in the common room but quickly banished the thought. With a frustrated sigh he tried to focus on sleeping.
To Pansy´s great delight Potter had taken to good-naturedly teasing him about everything and nothing so she officially rested her case. Draco himself was less than happy, clearly Potter had no interest in him, the git just really liked getting a rise out of him.
“Draco, wait!” Potter jogged after him and grabbed at his wrist to slow him down “I swear I didn´t mean it like that. Don´t be mad I-“ the rest of his sentence was cut off with a yelp and Draco found himself once again tumbling to the ground groaning when Potter landed on top of him with all his weight. Draco froze when Potter groaned right into his ear shifting against his back. He flushed bright red when he felt Potter crotch rub against his butt as Harry tried to get up.
He wasn´t usually a deep sleeper but he didn´t notice the other student walking down the stairs, nor did he notice the blanket draped over him and the sudden warmth by his side.
“You can´t just go around telling bloody Weasley that I want to make friends with Potter.” He sighed the tight knot in his stomach slowly unfurling. “It´s not even true.” He added as an afterthought and thumbed his head against the wall when Pansy only lifted a judgmental eyebrow at him.
He woke punctually as always and gradually made his ways out of bed. He was surprised he´d been able to fall asleep at all but it barely could´ve been more than four hours. He felt sluggish and queasy and was convinced it was because he´d have to spend an hour alone with Slughorn.
Really, it was their own fault they were only a few meters behind them. Clearly, they were both idiots. “Don’t be so dramatic, Harry.” Weasley snickered and Draco could hear Potter groan. They went down a different flight of stairs and before they were out of earshot Draco heard Potter whine. “I just want him to like me. At least a little bit.” he blushed again and even more so after hearing Weasley snort faintly and Pansy and Blaise broke out into loud laughter.
“Yes, you did! You admitted you´d been avoiding me!” His eyes had turned dark and unlike the usually friendly moss green color.  “You´ll notice, Potter, that that´s not the same thing as telling you to bugger off.” Draco hissed back crossing his arms over his chest to mirror the other boy.
He pushed himself to his feet in a stumble brushing down his robes and avoided eye contact with all three. “Sorry, Potter. If you´ll excuse me.” He mumbled picking up his bag and striding after Pansy whose laughter could be heard echoing in the hallway. Before he rounded the corner, he could hear a baffled “Did Malfoy just apologize to you, mate?” from Weasley and promptly started running.
Their eyes met and Potters face lit up with an awkward smile. “Nightmare?” he asked in a tone that spoke volumes about why he himself was up at ass o´clock in the morning on a holiday. Draco considered agreeing to it just to avoid the awkwardness but the tightness around Potter´s eyes and his haunted look made him think otherwise. “No.” He offered his voice much quieter than he´d wanted it to be. “I just couldn´t sleep.” He added at the questioning look.
“I guessed.” He said when he turned back to Draco smiling delighted when he noticed Draco´s smirk. And really, if this was what being friends with Potter was then Draco wasn´t sure he could handle it. Wanting to kiss him every two seconds was bound do drive him crazy. “I´m sure.” He replied with a smirk, voice dry. Either Potter didn´t notice that he was being made fun of or he didn´t care. “Did you sleep well? I haven´t seen you in the common room recently.” Potter seemed genuine enough but Draco felt slightly embarrassed, remembering what had kept him from sleep all those nights ago.
“I was just-“ he stammered cheeks burning faintly red and Draco let himself relish in the moment, Potter really was too damn handsome for his own good. “I´m sure ´you were just´” Draco mocked in a sneer “but I would prefer if you would just
The moment was broken when Pansy´s cackling registered in his brain and he sat up quickly only evading collision with Potter thanks to his fast reflexes as he sat back on his heels. Draco stared at him for another second before he pushed himself up glaring at Pansy who skipped down the hallway. “You fucking bitch!” He yelled after her storming off and ignoring Potter´s muttered “What the hell just happened”.
“What did you do to him!” Draco swallowed the bacon and eggs in his mouth and raised an eyebrow at Pansy who stood fuming on the other side of the table. “Who?” he asked once his mouth was empty even though he was most definitely certain who she was talking about.
“Why?” Potter sounded almost hurt at that and Draco wondered if this was what people that accidentally stepped on their crup´s tails felt like. “Why.” He scoffed ignoring the desire to hug Potter. “You´re making fun of me all the time and you want to know why I avoid you.” The dryness in his voice must have surprised Potter because he reeled back dropping Draco´s wrist as if burned.
“I- uh. I also wanted to apologize.” Potter added sheepishly and Draco closed his eyes breathing out through his nose before turning toward the boy wonder to give him his full attention. The faster he got this over with the faster Potter could go back to ignoring him. And that was
“But-“ My god what was it with Potter and his inability to speak in full sentences, Draco rolled his eyes, hard. “So, you didn´t want me to stop?” Potter asked dropping his crossed arms and taking a step closer.
This whole mess had only started when Pansy had – in a roundabout way – tried to get him to act on his feelings. Not only had he gotten numerous bruises from that, he´d also gotten detention. Any and all distractions from school were just not acceptable, especially distractions that landed him in detention.
.” He answered when his laughter subsided and looked back at Potter who watched him attentively eyes twinkling with wonder.
“What did you do?” Blaise asked wearily as he shuffled away from the raven. “Nothing.” Pansy sniffed haughtily and Draco growled at her. “She pushed me into Potter!” He yelled.
Due to the constant teasing he´d retreated to the one place that was most likely Potter-free – the library. The only time Potter deigned to study was shortly before his exams and thus far it wasn´t even winter hols. There was simply no way he´d be here at this time of year, he´d more likely be found outside playing quidditch. Or hunting Draco for that matter.
It wasn´t really a kiss. More a brush of lips but Draco let his eyes slip close and exhaled shakily against Potter´s lips. Harry seemed to take that as a sigh and Draco felt his stomach swoop when he increased the pressure their lips sliding together almost clumsy with nerves.
The rest of the week went by eventless, until Monday that was. Pansy and he were on their way to potions with the other eighth years - Blaise and Greg being late as usual - when they happened about the golden trio. Draco only noticed them in the subconscious way he always noticed Potter with his stupid hair and stupid green eyes before continuing to argue for the potency of Unicorn hair in felix felis.
Draco should have realized that wouldn´t be the end of it, but between Slytherins things were usually cleared up after a little shoving and hexing so he hadn´t been worried. It didn´t occur to him that Pansy was specifically choosing to push him into Potter because he refused to confess until the third time.
Bloody Potter was standing in the doorway gasping for breath exaggeratedly. “Professor!” he almost yelled “One of the third years brewed a potion in the Gryffindor common room and drank it. He went yellow and blew up like a balloon and now he´s stuck on the ceiling-“ Draco almost scoffed. For whatever reason Potter was lying out of his ass. It was so obvious Draco doubted Slughorn would even go for it.
“I don´t need your help, Potter. I´m capable of carrying my own books.” He almost hissed and watched as Potters expression fell almost like a kicked puppy further accentuated by Weasleys amused snort. “I know that. I just thought…” he trailed off green eyes roaming over Draco´s face and Merlin be damned he was sure the attention was making him blush. The answer came in form of Potter´s smug smile and glinting eyes which unfortunately only made everything worse.
earnest, looking directly into his soul. His throat clicked on a dry swallow and it felt like hours before he got a hold of himself, averting his eyes. “Fine.”, he muttered embarrassed.
” Draco drawled sarcastically forcing himself not to look at Potter. “I swear I wasn´t!” Potter insisted. “I´m sure, it was just a bit of good fun was it. Can´t be mean spirited because it was the bloody savior who did it.” He was getting worked up over this, Draco pressed his lips together in annoyance, partly at himself.
When he woke a few hours later his back ached and he groaned sleepily pressing his face deeper into the soft wool against his cheek. He blinked his eyes open sleepily, feeling drowsy and sluggish eyes following a hand as it moved a wand to reignite the fire.
“No, you don´t. I mean I like you, romantically.” Potter sounded almost sullen, like a pouting child and Draco felt his lips twitch at that until the words registered to him.
“You are terrible friends and I´m disowning you.” He threatened in a huff. It was of little effect, though.
“Me, too.” He agreed softly allowing the giddy smile to stretch his lips. For a while they just sat there almost leaning against each other their sides pressed together, watching the flickering of the fire. Draco felt himself slowly growing more awake and still refused to be embarrassed that he´d essentially used Potter as a pillow since Potter apparently didn’t care at all.
One moment Pansy was calling bullshit on his theory and the next she was viciously pushing him with all her strength. In hindsight Draco should have seen it coming but in that precise moment he did not. Which is why when he stumbled backwards he grabbed the first thing he could get his hands on and tugged.
The prat-who-lived had been avoiding him ever since their run in in the library and Draco had to admit that even though the teasing had been mortifying this was much worse. This was like the beginning of eighth year with eyes avoiding his and turning corners to not pass the other. Draco would never admit it out loud but he felt almost desperate for Potters attention.
He felt Potter´s eyes on his back trying badly to ignore his and Weasleys bickering. “What´d you do that for?” Potter hissed sounding righteously angry. “You´ll see.” Was all Weasley said to that and he could almost hear Potter´s teeth clenching “What?” he asked again.
They were off to the eighth year accommodations, walking up the stairs after dinner and Draco idly listened to Blaise and Pansy discussing if Luna looked ridiculous in her new get up or not. Draco snickered along with Pansy when Blaise stammered out that Luna always looked lovely when it happened. Blaise turned his flushed glare on Draco and yelled “Hey, Potter, catch!” and before Draco could even turn Blaise pushed him down the stairs.
over Potter´s head if only to avert being made fun of. He was pretty sure another reason why Pansy had given up so easily was that by now there was no way Potter didn´t know exactly how he felt about him.
“Not that I wouldn´t want your company!” He grinned and Draco scoffed at him. “Whatever Potter.” He pushed off Potter´s hand missing the dejected look on the others face as he walked a step faster, utterly embarrassed. “Good job mate” he heard Weasley say and felt all the more embarrassed. It wasn´t like it was Potter´s fault. He was well in his own right to say no. Draco just shouldn´t have gotten his hopes up like that.
Draco’s fists clenched tighter. Merlin, what was taking so long? Surely the entire class wasn’t going to be spent just standing around, smelling the infuriating potion? If that was the case, points be damned, he wouldn’t be able to take it. He’d have to tear out of the room, slamming the door so hard-
“Morning, Potter,” he yawned. “You should tell your friends to try to rescue you in the middle of the day next time.”
And without a glance back, Malfoy spun on his heel and continued down the corridor, Harry once again forced to jog to catch up.
Harry stood up so fast that he knocked over his cold cup of coffee, rushing over to the foyer to find Malfoy hanging up his coat, cheeks reddened from the cold, but otherwise appearing unscathed.
“What?” Harry asked disbelievingly. His stomach turned over with shock and a bizarre tingling sensation went through his insides as the words sank in. “Why would you say that?” For some inexplicable reason, inside of turning to his friends, first he looked to Malfoy, who, for the first time in Harry’s memory, seemed to be . . . blushing? At least, Harry couldn’t think what else to call the faint pink tinging the boy’s usually colourless skin. Harry felt as though he had to touch it to make sure it was not simply a figment of his imagination, run his fingertips along the stained edge of Malfoy’s cheek and-
The address Harry had been given was located a little ways outside of Painswick, ten minutes down a narrow paved road. After his incident earlier, he was careful to watch out for patches of ice lurking on the ground, his back already starting to ache from the impact.
“Hmm.” Malfoy looked around at his surroundings for inspiration, a mischievous glint in his grey eyes. “I dare you to go up to that man over there and tell him that you think holiday-themed drinks are the stupidest thing you’ve ever heard of.”
Reaching for some of the Muggle money he had stashed in his pocket, he made his way towards a stall selling hot drinks and pastries, falling into the back of the short line in front of it. He was on vacation for Merlin’s sake, and Hermione and Mrs. Weasley weren’t around to stop him, so he was going to have dessert first if he bloody felt like it.
“I agree,” Malfoy said. “And I’m sure that Granger and Weasley do as well. Since you’re here anyway, would you care to stay for a cup of hot chocolate? It’ll give you time to ascertain that I’m not holding your beloved Golden Boy captive.”
Still seething, Pansy allowed him to lead her into his dormitory, Crabbe and Goyle following close behind.
“Well, ‘us’, I suppose,” Harry said, shrugging. He traced an invisible line on the ground with the toe of his shoe, finally risking a glance up at Malfoy. His expression was unexpectedly thoughtful.
“Sweet Salazar, you’re not my mother!” Draco sneered. “I know you have some sort of hero’s complex, but I didn’t know it extended to making up situations so you can pretend to save people from them!”
“Remember when Weasley vomited slugs?” Crabbe said gleefully. It was obviously one of the few things that had made the cut to be remembered by his brain. Not spellwork or his own birthday. Miserable moments suffered by the Gryffindors.
As soon as Harry had shut the door behind him, he found himself pressed up against the wall by a determined Draco Malfoy. Grinning against the other boy’s insistent mouth, Harry closed his eyes and melted into the kiss, matching each grazing of lips with his own.
At the end of the day, it all came down to one thing: he had lost control. He was a Malfoy, goddammit! They kept their emotions in check.
“Thanks, Potter.” Malfoy rolled his eyes, but as he turned away, Harry saw a faint smile reflected in a passing store window.
“Exactly,” she said, returning his grin and looping her arm through his to slow his pace down as they came nearer and nearer to the Great Hall and the site where his reputation would soon be lost in a spectacular display of faux flames threaded with grimacing ice.
“Well, I wouldn’t exactly call that a ‘well-done performance’,” Harry said. “Charming maybe, but not ‘well-done’.”
Draco had always considered himself a more than decent chess player and had boasted as much when sitting down to play. He obviously had not taken Potter’s warning seriously enough.
“I thought you had gone to bed,” Draco commented idly, his attention still on the page in front of him.
Draco groaned, collapsing back into the chair again. “What happened to Supportive Pansy and ‘you’ve got nothing to worry about’?”
“Sure thing,” Harry said dazedly. His insides felt rather numb now, as if his nerve endings had been dulled. Numb because he had just realized something:
“Yes?” Potter said, casually leaning against Draco’s shoulder, the action so sudden that Draco nearly fell off the back of his seat.
“They still leave near a wizarding village,” Harry explained heavily. “Someone would recognize me and then the press would be everywhere and they’d never have a moment of peace again. I can’t do that to them. They’re my family.”
“Always with apple pie,” Malfoy said to him, smiling with an easy sincerity that Harry had never seen before. He had known that Andromeda and Teddy visited with the Malfoys every so often, but he hadn’t realized how close Teddy was to that side of his family and, by extension, to Malfoy. It was an odd moment, thinking about how few degrees of separation really had been between him and Malfoy these past five years, despite their never running into each other until now.
Stuffed to the brim with Mrs. Weasley’s excellent cooking, everyone crowded into the living room again, piling on the couches and chairs, while some stretched out on the floor. O’Leary helped Mr. Weasley pass out large cups of apple cider and eggnog, Celestina Warbeck crooning from the radio in the corner.
“Ahh, Harry m’boy!” He said jovially, looking up from his cauldron, which was filled with a bubbling green mixture that smelled like compost. “What can I do for you?”
Harry was certain he saw O’Leary roll his eyes, stirring the cookie dough with an expert hand before begrudgingly passing it back.
Malfoy opened up his gift from Andromeda and Teddy, which ended up being some strings of charmed silver and gold lights, in a not so subtle prod from Andromeda to get Malfoy to put up more decorations.
This chapter was a ton of fun to write, so props to larosesombre for the lovely prompt! It also definitely made me want to have a romantic snowball fight with someone, so . . . (sarcastic) thanks larosesombre!
It was getting late. Windows in the castle continually darkened as everyone settled in for the night. Ron and Hermione were probably waiting up for him.
Harry glanced over at the Slytherin table. Malfoy’s friends were watching them fixatedly, so Harry placed a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, hoping that the touch would distract from their angry expressions.
“Right, well, I’ll go first and then you follow,” Malfoy said briskly, stepping closer to the fire place. “The address is 67 Meadowes Lane. What is the address?”
So when Malfoy abruptly slid into his chair at the dinner table just as Harry was finishing up his supper, with a pleased smile on his face, Harry barely looked up from the last dregs of his soup.
That smile grated at Draco’s pride and he threw himself furiously back into looking for any form of escape.
Mere seconds later, he made his choice, ordering his queen over a few squares. Draco hardly had a moment to collect himself and reconfigure his strategy before it was his turn again.
“I won’t, promise,” Harry said, meaning it. He sensed that whatever was behind all of this wasn’t something to be flippant about. And even if it was, it obviously made Malfoy happy, and even with their complex past, Harry wasn’t going to tear that away from him.
“What are you talking about, Potter?” Malfoy demanded crossly, swinging his long legs off of the sofa.
Malfoy snorted in disbelief. “It’s a little more than a week until Christmas and you still haven’t done your shopping? Merlin, it really is a good thing you had Granger in school or the Boy Who Lived would have been The Boy Who Procrastinated Too Much To Pass His Classes.”
“Well, maybe I have it—” she began to suggest, pulling back from Ron, but Harry quickly cut her off.
“Ugh. Messing around with Malfoy.” Ron shuddered. “That is a sentence I could have gone my whole life without hearing.”
“Want some help?” A weight sloped down onto the couch pillow beside Draco as Potter sat down, nodding towards the board.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but with surprisingly little exasperation. “I cast warming charms before we left. When you live in the dungeons, it’s an everyday necessity.”
“This person is obviously magical, but is the majority of the town Muggles?” Harry asked, trying to sound casual while his mind was already conjuring up images of a snow-covered village glowing in preparation for the holidays. But most importantly, a snow-covered village where he could walk down the street, enjoying the sight without being mobbed by reporters or well-wishers.
Potter was handsome like always, hair looking like he´d just been shagged, green eyes bright against his dark skin and broad shoulders nicely displayed by a visibly old and fading muggle shirt.
“You know,” Potter started in a low voice sending shivers down Draco´s spine. “I almost thought you were avoiding me.” He teased clearly mocking the other but instead of scoffing and making fun of him Draco found himself unable to say anything. Carefully he pushed two books back into their righteous place glancing at Potter who observed him with a raised eyebrow. “And yet you´ve found me.” He blurted out swiftly turning his back to Potter as his ears burned red why in Merlin’s name had he said that. He busied himself with returning three more books to their places only one left in his hands he turned to the exit of the aisle where Potter stood expression stormy.
“I like you.” Draco flushed at the declaration as his heart started to race. He gripped the blanket tighter and swallowed the giddy feeling before answering. “I like you, too.” Potter immediately made a frustrated noise, something between a huff and groan and sunk further into the couch. Neither looking away from the fire.
He made his way into the bathroom to get ready for the day, not looking forward to any of his classes. His stomach was still upset by the time breakfast was ready and so he opted to stay inside the dormitory sending Blaise on his way and proof reading his DADA essay one last time.
“Then what are you saying.” Potter demanded voice dry with annoyance and Draco chanced a glance his way. “I thought we´d been getting along before you started making fun of me.” He blurted and immediately started to scrub harder face alight with color. He was so doomed; this boy was frying his brain to mouth filter with just one look.
“Draco?” Potter spoke again after what felt like hours. “Yeah?” he mimicked the hushed whisper even though there was no way anyone could have heard them all the way into the dormitories. But it made this feel intimate, almost like a dream.
Potter´s hand on his hips tugged forward and Draco followed gasping out a breath when Harry pulled him snugly onto his lap the hand on his cheek sliding down his side to rest on his other hip. He felt hot arousal light up his spine as Harry´s tongue slid over his bottom lip gasping out a moan when he did it again. Their tongues met and Draco shifted his hips restlessly at the uncomfortable feeling of his tight pants. He shifted forward both hands buried in Potters hair and whined into the kiss when Potter pulled their hips together.
If there was one teacher that absolutely hated everything about Draco it was Slughorn. The man was a terror and even if Draco knew his potions were brewed to perfection he rarely got above an Acceptable. “Yes, Headmistress.” He nodded to her and she looked at him a second longer something almost gentle in her gaze. “Enjoy the rest of your dinner.” She said in passing and Draco grimaced down at his plate. He probably wouldn´t be able to stomach anything tonight anyways. He told Blaise he´d go to bed early and left for the eighth-year accommodations.
He sighed to himself and sunk further into the comfortable loveseat of the common room trying to focus on the potions book in his lap. He vaguely noticed how most other students went to bed and when he looked up what felt like hours later the room was deserted and the fire almost dead. He reignited the flames with a swish of his wand and resigned himself to a night of restlessness. An hour later he was asleep, head resting back against the couch and book slack in his grip.
!?” He yelled jumping to his feet gratified in the way Pansy shrunk under his glare. Ignoring the scolding “Mister Malfoy.” from the Head table he grabbed his wand. “You intolerable
“Forget it, let’s get to Charms, yeah? Don’t want McGonagall to give us that speech again.” Weasley sounded so nonchalant it pissed Draco off even further. His own friends were bad enough but to be pushed by Weasley in a corridor full of people was just humiliating.
He found himself ringing for an answer but when nothing came out Potter only scoffed, putting the books in his hand down on a random shelf he took a step forward almost menacingly grabbing Draco by the wrist.
Luckily, they weren´t far from the ground when Draco tripped backwards into Harry and they both landed on their butts. All the fight drained out of him Draco slumped back against Potter´s chest from where he sat between his legs and groaned.
“Mate, I’d be hiding too if you´d keep making fun of me.” Weasley huffed and Draco cast a quick notice me not charm before ducking down behind his wall of books as both teens rounded the corner to his table. Just bloody great. They were going to sit at his table and notice him. With as much grace as he could muster, he scooted out of his chair and past the boys to the next bookshelf. The last thing he heard was Potter asking who the books belonged to before one of them cast a muffling charm.
“Draco, I promise I wasn´t making fun of you.” His voice was soft and eyes back to their soft green, wide and so,
He saw Potter´s eyes flicker down to his own lips and nervously licked them. Green eyes followed the motion and he watched the dark skin of his throat move in a swallow. Potter looked back up again his eyes appearing darker as his pupil expanded. They were close enough that Draco could feel Potter´s breath on his face and forced himself to uncurl one of his hands to raise it to Potters shoulder. He tugged softly on the ugly knitted sweater and Potter followed willingly, their lips meeting in a soft brush.
He peered in almost hoping it wasn´t Professor Slughorn but found him sitting at the desk up front. He must have been teaching a first-year class before, all the pots and utensils were still at the desks and slimy with a green sort of liquid. Half the desks were sprinkled in the substance and one desk in particular looked like the potion had exploded.
Were they friends? Probably not. They´d barely spoken all year the short amicable interactions in hallways and between and during classes hardly spoke of friendship. He hated to admit it but only Pansy´s terrible attempt at matchmaking had finally gotten them to talk to each other. In more or less full sentences.
“Draco, common you promised to help me with my potions essay!” Pansy yelled, smirk audible in her voice, and only then did he look up. As if his face wasn´t red enough the dozen pairs of eyes turned onto them only made it hotter and he pushed off Potters arm to get up.
“Oh.” Potter spoke voice scratchy from disuse, he cleared his throat. “I can-“ Draco made and awkward gesture back up the stairs cursing himself for being so undignified. Potters eyes flitted to the staircase as if considering his offer before they settled back on him. “No, that´s alright.” An awkward shuffle later Draco had dragged an armchair closer to the fire and sat comfortably blanket thrown over his legs. He tried to ignore the way that Potter was
“You suppose?” his voice sounded icy to his own ears and successfully wiped the smile off Potters face. “Yes. I mean, no. I´m really sorry I didn´t mean to- it wasn´t my intention to make you uncomfortable.” Even Potter stuttering was adorable. He kept shifting his weight, green eyes wide with something like shock and bloody hell he kept licking his lips. This needed to stop. “Okay.” He conceded with a sigh and a short nod. “So, we´re alright?” Draco mustered the hopeful expression on Potter´s face tempted to say yes but hesitated.
“I´m fine.” He grumbled pulling out his wand to undo his laces. “I never thought you of all people would be clumsy, Malfoy.” Granger smiled mirthfully at him and Draco felt dread at her expression, sure, he´d apologized to her and she´d been sweeter than she had any right to be after how he´d treated her but that didn´t mean women weren´t fucking evil. Pansy was the best example.
Potter lifted himself onto his forearms and they both stared at each other slightly dumbfounded before Potter broke into a giggle. “Looks like you fell for me.” He grinned impishly and Draco groaned letting his head fall back against the floor rolling his eyes “Shut up, Potter.”. “It´s funny.” Harry insisted still with that charming grin and Draco badly wanted to kiss it. He licked his lips smirking when green eyes followed the movement. “It isn´t.” he insisted again tugging softly at Potter´s hair.
“Really?” Granger said, shutting her book suddenly, the pages slapping together with a heavy ‘thump’ that almost made Draco jump. “I thought that the bit on Edgar Bellington was quite fascinating.”
“Hey,” he said, raising his voice to a shout when he realized that the person couldn’t hear him over their own screams. “HEY! YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN! I CAN’T HELP YOU IF YOU KEEP FLAILING AROUND LIKE THAT!”
Still clinging to the act, Malfoy continued to edge towards the door and his escape, insisting, “I don’t know what you’re talking about Potter. Really, such an accusation—”
The Slytherins were some of the first to slip into the potions classroom, taking their customary seats behind their cauldrons as the Gryffindors who they were doubling with filed in chaotically, filling the air with a dull murmur interspersed with laughter obnoxiously cheerful for so early in the morning. Draco shared customary eyerolls with Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott. Honestly, was Slytherin the only house with any dignity?
Hermione smiled triumphantly. “See, I knew you’d like it! Ron, where did you put the Prophet from this morning?”
Draco gritted his teeth, pacing closer to her chair so that the entire bustling common room didn’t hear his next words. “But that means that I can’t go off and go to, ahem, you know.”
Comments and/or kudos bring me as much happiness as wearing my Gryffindor scarf during the first snow. :)
But that didn’t explain why Malfoy had been uncharacteristically silent for the rest of the evening and during every interaction of theirs in the days since.
Harry slumped forward onto the table, enjoying the feeling of the smooth wood against his aching head. It was the day before Christmas Eve and all he wanted to do was enjoy one of his last peaceful days with his boyfriend and instead he was getting raked over in the press. Brilliant.
Due to demand, I have added a second part to this Amortentia fic with what ensued after the statement ending the last chapter. Hope you enjoy!
Harry realized with horror that Malfoy’s appearance had reverted back to its natural form, meaning that the Polyjuice potion had worn off. People began swarming their table as whispers ran through the pub that Harry Potter was sitting in their very midst, heads craning for a look as voices began rising.
Just then, a tapping noise sounded and Harry looked up to see an owl outside of the dining room window, something clutched in its beak. Malfoy went over and let it in, taking the item and handing it to Harry.
He entered the foyer as Malfoy opened the door, to reveal a group of five children grinning at them, bundled in coats, scarves, and hats, but still rosy-cheeked from the cold.
She continued to stand. “Are you sure? What’s it called? You can’t have my collection of books memorized, Harry.”
And with that, she stood up and marched back towards the castle, Ron gaping at her before quickly getting to his feet and running after her, robes billowing in the wind.
Just as he was approaching the stoop, the door was flung open by . . . Malfoy? Closely followed by a house elf dressed in a long flannel shirt.
“But Malfoy, truth or dare is a competition,” Harry said, hoping that the angle he was going for would pay off. “And if you refuse to follow through, then you lose a point.”
But Harry knew that no amount of fake break-ups could make him go back to seeing Draco how he used to. Not after he showed him his garishly yellow car and drove them around while singing Queen. Not after sneaking out to kiss him in abandoned classrooms. Not after waking up in his arms in the Gryffindor common room and never wanting to leave.
Granger nodded eagerly. “Yes, as opposed to the minister for magic at the time, Leving Quilp, who tried to pass all that legislation in the Wizengamot about restrictive rights.”
“Sorry, it was freezing out and O’Leary said it was alright if I wore . . . but I should have asked— I was just going to shovel snow . . . your snow, actually, not random snow, walkway snow. So people can . . . you know . . . walk on it,” Harry finished lamely, pulling off the hat and gloves and holding them awkwardly, wondering if he should hand them to Malfoy or simply close his eyes and wait for death.
“It’s my pleasure.” Harry smiled, tugging up the zipper on his coat, before opening the door and stepping outside. And promptly coming back in again.
Her fiancé stared at her. “What do you mean, where did I put the Prophet? Have you gone deaf? Harry practically just said he’d go!”
So I ended up tweaking the prompt a little bit, because both of these two hopeless boys are still too antagonistic to voluntarily share clothing, but the mechanics are still roughly the same!
“The fuck?” He spat, sitting up and glancing over to see what had hit him. If he didn’t know better, he would have thought a rogue Bludger had been let loose in the dining hall as some sort of practical joke; Potter getting back at him for accidentally saving Draco’s life yesterday. Wanted to remedy what damage he’d unintentionally not done.
But even better than all their fun in the snow were the cozy nights that they spent in the Gryffindor common room, hunched over spirited games of Exploding Snap or intense chess tournaments. They even tried Poker again, Hermione gleefully cleaning up without Pansy to challenge her.
“Pretty well actually,” Harry said, intentionally holding his gaze until Malfoy blushed and looked away.

“Hullo to you too, love, no need to be so rough,” Malfoy drawled, smirking and settling his robes around him primly. “Pass the coffee?”
“God, yes,” Harry said emphatically, digging out a handful of bills and exchanging them for the warm cup.
“Yes, yes I am,” Harry agreed hurriedly, all but running over to the stairs to his and Ron’s dorm. “Not sure how long it will take, so don’t wait up.”
At the beginning of the drive, Harry kept snorting every few minutes, so Malfoy, to his great astonishment, instructed him to rummage in the glove compartment and put on a CD. The itch to comment tore mercilessly at Harry, but with one glare from Malfoy, he silently slipped in the first one he grabbed, once again shocked as Freddy Mercury’s voice began projecting through the vehicle.
Finally, he came out of the forest, looking satisfied. “O’Leary has found his tree,” he announced proudly, leading them through the trees until they came to a stout fir that stood a bit taller than Malfoy. The needles were a glossy dark green and the branches were layered tightly, with no gaps at any spots.
Without thinking, Draco reached for Potter’s hand, tangling their numb fingers together as they wandered past the shuttered greenhouses and towards the Quidditch pitch. The gesture felt right. A reminder that there was still life in this ghostly world.
“That’s too bad,” Harry said lamely, both of them skirting around the unsaid thought that was ricocheting off the walls; that Malfoy had been too busy working for Voldemort after school to play Quidditch. “Ron and some of his buddies at the Auror Academy do pick-up matches every so often, so I’ve joined in with some of those, but that’s about it.”
. If he’d just gone to a random small town and stayed with a stranger and gone home again, exactly the same as before.
He pressed a hand to his stinging cheek, where Pansy had placed a hard-handed slap. The rest of the common room’s occupants had given up pretending that they weren’t watching and were now goggling at them, mouths open.
At dinner he ignored both Pansy´s and Blaise´s efforts to include him in conversation and after their worried - but not in any way quite - whispered conversation that were obviously about him. He forced himself to nibble at at a dry piece of toast and managed to successfully eat half of it before it was time to go. His friends gave him encouraging smiles which he also ignored, not in the mood for any form of encouragement.
“For what?” Potter gave a weak smile when Draco met his eyes. “For making you uncomfortable. In the library and before that I suppose.” Potters smile spread wider, almost resembling his impish grin except it looked more sheepish. He looked adorable and Draco tried to squash down the warm feeling that bubbled up in his stomach.
“You should go to bed.” Draco mumbled but despite his words shuffled closer to the warmth hands fisting into the blanket. Potter´s shoulders shook with soft laughter and Draco felt his own lips tug into a smile.
“Listen, Potter. I don’t want any more trouble. You´ve been doing a fine job ignoring me this past week I´m sure it´ll be no problem to continue until the end of the year.” When he looked up Potter was gaping at him. “I-” he started ringing for words cheeks flushed with color and brows furrowed in a furious expression. “I did that because you told me to bugger off!” Draco scoffed at him, “No I didn´t.”.
A strangled scream later he found himself pressed to the floor a heavy weight resting on him. His heart was beating heavily in his chest and his fingers twitched helplessly when Potter groaned on top of him pushing himself up on one hand and rubbing his head. Green eyes blinked open and for what felt like hours they just stared at each other.
Harry passed her the cash, taking the paper bag she handed to him, echoing her “Happy Christmas!” Carrying his purchases, he headed back outside, stepping into the cold where Malfoy stood, a cloud from his breath in the air in front of him.
He leaned back in his chair, scanning the last inch of his looping cursive. “Granger, does this look right to you?” He asked, passing the parchment across the table. “The bit about the Secrecy Statute.”
But Pansy’s warning was cut off as something suddenly smacked into the back of Draco’s head, the item bouncing off and crashing onto the floor.
“What, Malfoy, are you going to run away now?” Potter demanded, the taunting effect slightly undone by his obviously flushed skin.
“Well, I suppose we should go in,” Draco said reluctantly, staring at the entrance to the Slytherin dungeon.
“But we already are separate for most of our classes,” Harry pointed out, walking over to sit next to the Slytherin.
“So, am I allowed to ask why?” Harry ventured finally, reaching out and turning down the music a few decimals.
“It’s just Ron and Hermione. They so obviously have feelings for each other, yet they somehow don’t see it, so they’re wasting all this time bickering and beating around the bush when they could be together.”
Draco could feel a blush rising in his face and ducked his head back down, cursing his tell-tale paleness.
“Hey,” Harry said hastily, fed up with waiting. “Can you go back in there and tell Draco Malfoy that I’m waiting for him?”
Laughing awkwardly, Harry watched Malfoy with confusion, wondering what had prompted this strange action.
As hoped for, his self-deprecation caused a slight smirk to quirk across Malfoy’s lips as he tracing idle lines across Harry’s chest with his fingertips, his touch sending shivers through his skin.
“Well, you should at least get a tree, so you have somewhere to put your present under,” Andromeda said. “And you know how much O’Leary would like that.”
“Alright,” she said slowly. “Well, then I think it’s great. I know I went off about all that stuff about reputations and appearances, but if you really do care about him and he makes you happy, then I’m really glad for you.”
Set on edge, Harry nonetheless nodded, taking a mug from a stack on the counter. “Sure. That would be great.”
“Same to you, Mr. Prewitt,” he said with as much sincerity as he could, while simultaneously trying to discreetly wipe off the sheen of sweat that had been transferred from the other man’s palm.
Every few minutes, Malfoy’s gaze would flit up from whatever he and Madam Malkin were studying to fixate on Harry. A faint smile would curl the corners of his mouth and something indecipherable would flash in his eyes before he turned back to the seamstress, nodding along with whatever she was saying. The first few times this had happened, Harry tried to pretend as though he hadn’t been looking at the other boy in the first place, but eventually his blush was so pronounced that he couldn’t deny it. So he would meet Malfoy’s eyes, examining their gray depths, searching for . . . something. But what it was, he wasn’t quite sure.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Yes, and barely spoke to anyone the entire time! You slumped in a corner and glared at anyone who dared to come within five feet of you!”
“Well, because it’s festive for this time of year and it smells good and where else am I supposed to put your present?” Harry listed off.
Malfoy glanced towards the house elf, at once becoming deadly calm in a way that was more unnerving than his anger. “I’m going out, O’Leary. Don’t wait up.”
“You’re probably right,” Draco agreed, stomach churning at the thought of Pansy’s reaction. Oh well, he thought stubbornly, she would learn to be fine with it or at least outwardly pretend to be. Crabbe and Goyle probably wouldn’t even notice if he didn’t make a point of telling them, and even then it might be a struggle for them to even recall why Draco and Harry dating would be something they were against. Even something as ingrained as house rivalry was hard for them to remember.
“Alright, what do I do now?” He asked, eyes wild and hair standing on end, looking as though he’d lost a battle with a loaf of bread.
“Obviously not a very good one,” Malfoy shot back, sneering and leaning back against the desk adjacent from Harry’s. “I’m surprised that she fell for it. Hufflepuffs.” He snorted disdainfully.
“It’s my first year as captain of the Gryffindor team, so I want to do some recon on the other teams,” Harry explained stiffly.
“You won’t ruin anything,” Harry told him, tracing comforting circles on the backs of his hands. “Sure, it might be a little awkward at first, but I’ll be right there beside you the whole time, alright?”
“Merlin,” Malfoy sighed, grabbing one of Harry’s cold-chapped hands and dumping a small portion of the metallic stuff into it. “You’ve traveled by Floo before, yes?”
Further excited whisperings filled the classroom as Snape waved his wand over the cauldron, vanishing the magical seal. Instantly, Draco inhaled the scent of broom polish, and treacle tart, reported by the Daily Prophet’s gossip column to be the favourite food of one Harry Potter. He gripped the sharp edge of his cauldron tightly. Not that he was all that surprised. More . . . disappointed that his expectations had been confirmed. Another sharply jabbing reminder of his doomed infatuation.
So that was it, he thought numbly. He had to tell Draco that it was time for them to break off the act and go back to how it was.

He sighed. “Look, if you all could just stand back for a moment,” he said, trying to raise his voice above the hubbub. But the crowd paid him no attention, simply pressing closer and yelling their demands and questions louder, camera shutters snapping in a near continuous roar.
“Makes sense,” Potter said reluctantly and he tentatively slid his fingers between Draco’s. His skin was surprisingly warm, the sensation sinking into Draco’s palm so suddenly that he nearly dropped Potter’s hand.
“Yes, I’m so ignorant of wizarding customs, I know, we’ve been over this before,” Harry grumbled, setting the vial back down on the table and focusing his attention on capturing the last mouthful of soup at the bottom of his bowl.
Half way along the next corridor, Harry stopped outside a door, folding up the Cloak and the Map and tucking them into an inner pocket in his robes. Whispering a soft ‘Alohomora’ he twisted the knob and opened the door to the empty classroom.
Malfoy was frowning at him now, obviously perplexed by the odd expression that had come over Harry’s face. He could feel a blush starting to splotch across his skin and his head spun as he tried to come up with a diversion.
The silence was palpable, hanging uncomfortably in the air. Harry snatched quick glances across the table at Malfoy, still not quite used to seeing him in Muggle clothes instead of a Hogwarts uniform. His hair was shorter too, closer to the length it had been in sixth year rather than when they had first met. Little details Harry had known by heart after seeing him every day for six years, suddenly strange and unfamiliar with the change of half a decade.
“I’m going to head up to bed,” she said, dropping a soft kiss on Weasley’s cheek and squeezing his hand.
“Of the Weasley girl? Never,” Draco scoffed, scrambling to come up with a move that would put him back in the lead, trying to focus despite Potter’s fingers, which were now undoing his cufflink with surprising nimbleness so that they could trace farther up his arm.
By the end of it, Draco’s patience was running dangerously low and his head was aching horribly from trying to put himself in the other boys’ shoes to explain the wandwork, which was impossibly simplistic to begin with. On his way out of the Great Hall, he allowed himself one glance over at the Gryffindor table, in an attempt to curb his irritability. Weasley and Granger were participating in their usual old-married-couple bickering, each glowing with secret enjoyment, while Potter . . . Draco faltered, nearly smacking into Goyle when he saw that Potter had his arm around the Ravenclaw Seeker, Cho Chang, and appeared to be whispering something into her ear with sickening intimacy.
Harry pretended to consider him for a moment, taking in the meticulously coiffed hair, polished shoes, and posh coat. “No,” he relented. “But that isn’t a good enough reason to yell at someone.”
“Why would you?” Malfoy sneered, colour rising in his pale skin. “You’re the saviour of the entire world. Everywhere you go you’re hailed as a hero. You don’t even have to ask to have anything you want.”
“That is not fair,” Harry protested, dropping Malfoy’s hand and stepping away from him to go on the defensive.
Then he saw Malfoy stand up, ice-cold determination in his eyes as he cast a spell that raised his voice above the screaming rabble, “STOP! Right now, all of you, stop what you’re doing this instant.”
Malfoy shook his head, letting out a bitter laugh. “I don’t know, because I fucking worked for her all year, on her precious Inquisitorial Squad?”
Teddy nodded enthusiastically, staring hard at the tray before choosing one shaped like a snowflake, blue sprinkles dotting the edges of his mouth as he munched on it.
“It was Cho. Remember how she was wailing on about Cedric during breakfast. I think she dragged him off to blubber some more.” Granger shook her head, bushy curls bouncing with the motion. Draco’s stomach sank, his suspicions about Potter and Chang confirmed.
Harry clenched his fists and said through gritted teeth, “Holiday-themed drinks are the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard of.”
She nodded slightly and threw the Quaffle across to Demelza, who swooped to the left, before chucking the ball across where Katie smashed it through the right hoop past Ron’s fingertips.
That smile was simply illegal. “Great! I mean good. I-“ Potter floundered over his words and Draco felt his lips tick upwards in amusement. “Uh…” Potter finished lamely eyes fixed on Draco´s face. “Don´t hurt yourself, Potter.” He teased in a way that he hoped didn´t sound too friendly. Potter gave another blinding smile and Draco new he´d failed to rebuild the distance between them. He huffed at the savior who almost resembled a little crup.
Potters hands were now caging him in on either side of his head and Draco noticed with mortification that he was positioned between his legs. Green eyes twinkled down at him as he felt a blush spread from his cheeks to the tips of his ears. He knew he looked ridiculous while blushing, almost feverish with how easily it showed on his face.
, Draco?” Pansy scoffed gesturing over to the Gryffindor table. Draco´s eyes betrayed him as they followed her hand eyes landing on the ruffled black hair. For what felt like an hour he stared at the other boy frowning when his hands felt tingly from the thought of running them through that disastrous hair. And
“I like you, too.” He whispered again, his voice cracking. Potter immediately sat up eyes wide and cheeks flushed. “Really?” Draco smiled hesitantly. “Really.” He blushed embarrassed at the sheer awe in Potter´s eyes as if Draco had gone and gifted him something immensely precious.
Potter was sat, like before, next to Weasley. His head was hung over a roll of parchment brows furrowed in concentration and looking undoubtedly every bit the handsome savoir that the papers made him to be. Draco really had to get his shit together, just because a bloke was
“Potter.” His dry tone would have anyone else sit back down to avoid awkwardness but apparently Potters stupidity excelled even that of ogres. He was next to Draco in the blink of an eye gathering the remaining books with a blinding smile and gentle eyes.
Since studying would be utterly impossible, he´d put away the books and hightail it out of the library hopefully without being shamefaced by the boy who lived to annoy him.
Draco groaned softly sitting up and blinking his eyes open only to find wide emerald eyes staring back into his merely an inch away. Draco felt his face flush with embarrassment and cursed his frail complexion for the color was unmistakable.
He couldn´t change the past and he´d always have to work at least twice as hard as other people but he´d made his peace with that after his trials. He´d tried
“Potter?” Draco hedged fingers gripping the book a little tighter. “So, you were avoiding me?” he asked sounding oddly pissed off and fuck was there not one thing about this idiot that Draco found unattractive?
“This is how I die.” He whispered more to himself than to anyone else but the rumble of Potters laugh let him know he heard. “Wanna tell me what all this is about now?” Potter said lowly and Draco could feel his breath against his neck. “No, thank you, I´d rather die now.” He grumbled still slumped against Potter. He couldn´t make himself get up and only when he shifted did he notice that Potter had slung his arm around Draco´s waist. The dark tan of his skin looked almost ridiculously hot next to Draco´s pale white complexion.
“You leave me no choice, love.” She mused and Draco sneered at her. “As if-“ he cut himself off with a yelp as Pansy pushed him harshly right into Potter. The poor thing never saw it coming and both toppled to the floor in an undignified tangle of limbs.
He gasped softly and awkwardly tried to sit up ignoring the painful tingling in his legs that had fallen asleep. Potter turned to meet his gaze and Draco took a second to look him over. He looked weary, his dark locks sticking up in all directions and framing his face in a way that shouldn´t have been handsome but was, painfully so.
“Now stop wasting my time and do something useful for once.” He sneered playfully and Harry grinned wider. “For once?” he asked with a raised brow sounding slightly offended but still grinning.
They´d been lounging outside for a while now when Pansy complained about being thirsty and made Draco get up to fetch some water. “I´m not your dog.” He hissed at her good-naturedly but she only stuck out her tongue.
After Potter left it took another two hours to clean everything. One and a half hours longer than his detention was supposed to last but Slughorn didn´t say anything about that. Draco was bone tired once he made his way to the dormitories and fell face first onto his bed, asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.
“Why the hell are you talking to Weasley.” He kept his voice low but Blaise, who sat beside him, shifted his cup and plate further away from him so it couldn´t have sounded all that calm. “It- I mean it was necessary. For research.” Pansy stammered avoiding his eyes guiltily and Draco felt the ground slip from under his feet.
He´d just finished his potions essay and stretched his arms over his head back arching with the movement when he heard Potter´s voice.
It honestly felt a bit like he couldn´t catch a break. Just as soon as he´d made his peace with being friends with Potter shit just had to go and ruin everything. Not only had he –
“Draco?” the hesitant voice came around the corner and he looked up quickly wiping his eyes. Pansy slowly made her way over to him. “I´m sorry.” She whispered face as grimace of guilt. Draco clenched his teeth against the urge to draw his wand. “I promise I didn´t tell him about” she hesitated “You know.” She laid her hand on his right knee carefully like approaching a wild animal and sat down before him on the cold floor. “I only told him it´d be fun to mess with you both. I said you´d been trying to make friends.” She winced at her own words and Draco´s glare alike. “What the
The Love seat closest to the fire, surprisingly, was already occupied and Draco stood still for a second reconsidering if he should just head off to bed. Before he could decide the student turned and Draco was pinned in place by green eyes.
With one last glare at a dejected Pansy he grabbed his bag and almost ran out of the Great Hall. Unfortunately, he couldn´t just up and skip all his classes but Merlin did he want to. Soon he found himself in the dungeons, having walked there without consciously knowing.
“So, if I tried to kiss you, you wouldn´t hex me?” Potter hedged turning sitting up slowly and gently placing one hand on Draco´s knee. He felt his breath hitch even though the touch wasn´t necessarily intimate and felt his eyes wander down to Potters lips.
“Good morning, Potter, Weasley.” He greeted nodding to both of them. “Malfoy.” Ron nodded back with a smirk turning to whisper something to Pansy. Which was really honestly very suspicious but Potter didn´t seem to care. He softly tugged at Draco´s sweater and urged him to walk with him.
“It won´t happen again, promise.” Pansy snickered and Draco mustered her with a distrustful glare. For now, he decided, he couldn´t do much more about it anyways. With a final scowl he strode back to his friends, sat down and began to eat.
The following week Draco had given up on walking anywhere with Pansy alone, it was a safety hazard. Blaise called him a drama queen but at least he wouldn´t stoop to Pansy´s level of matchmaking. Not that there was a match to make, that was ridiculous. He didn´t like Potter.
He cast three cleaning charms in quick succession before slinking back into the bedroom. For a second he stood at the legs of his bed, hesitating, not nearly tired enough to get back to bed and so he snatched a random book off his nightstand as well as his blanket. Casting
. Do you want?” he seethed throwing a nasty glare Harry´s way. “Uhm.” Potter stuttered still fidgeting. Draco rolled his eyes with an annoyed groan turning back the cauldron he was currently scrubbing clean off a disgustingly sticky green slime. “I just want to-“ Potter started but cut himself off grimacing at himself before trying again. “I mean I´m not sure what yesterday was about but…” Draco could feel Potters eyes on him but refused to turn back to meet his gaze. “Ron didn´t tell me anything weird about you. He told me nothing. I mean.” Potter finally finished.
“If you don´t tell him I´ll have to do it for you.” She warned nodding toward the golden trio that coincidentally had just turned a corner a few paces ahead, coming their way.
and left me alone.” Potter looked truly crestfallen and Draco felt bad enough that he almost amended what he´d said.
knew. Clearly Pansy couldn't be trusted, even if she'd claimed Weasley didn't know about certain feelings he had. It was only a matter of time before he spilled the beans to his best mate.
Draco felt himself flush and swallowed slightly turning away and grabbing the nearest dirty cauldron to occupy his hands.  “That´s not what I said.”, he started scrubbing at a particularly nasty spot trying his best to ignore that Potter had taken another step closer and was all but pressed to his side. Every time Draco moved his arm brushed against Potter´s chest.
“It´ll be alright, Draco. It´s only one detention.” Pansy whispered and Draco gave a strangled laugh not really surprised that she knew he was mostly upset about that. They sat side by side like that staring at the stone walls until the mass of eighth year students was in earshot. They slowly gathered their stuff and followed the small group of mixed houses towards the potions classroom. And if some students seemed to gossip about him, well, he just tried extra hard not to notice.
“I sat on him!” He continued when all three just gave him blank stares. For a second there was silence before all three broke out into laughter. Draco felt his face heat up and with a withering glare stood up, picked up his bag and spun around to leave not noticing that a certain Gryffindor, too, was watching.
It wasn´t until dinner that he finally found Pansy sitting peacefully between Greg and Blaise at one end of the Slytherin table. Draco threw his bag onto the floor on the other side of the table all the while glaring at her. “You
“Potter.” He found himself speaking before he´d really thought of what to say but when the intensity of those green eyes snapped onto him it would have been useless either way. “You´re not the only one.” He managed willing down a blush as Potter mustered his face looking for something Draco couldn´t name. Finally, the furrow in his brow lifted and with a soft smile and a cock of his head to the side his fingers and leg stilled.
“I just-“ Potter cut himself off again, running a hand through his unruly black locks and tugging at the ends clearly frustrated with himself. “Whatever Parkinson told him or didn´t he didn´t say anything.” When Potter didn´t try to talk again Draco glanced at him eyeing the nervous boy up and down.
“Let me help you with these.” He dimpled and if Draco had been a weaker man his knees would have given out right then and there. It was for obvious reasons why everyone fawned over the boy-who-lived but as he´d grown from the awkward boy into the young adult he was now there were other reasons that could not be denied.
They stood like that for a few ticks. Draco felt the urge to fidget in place when Potter continued to not say anything but reigned it in. Malfoys don´t fidget, he told himself. “Err…So I don´t have to avoid you anymore?” Potter finally spoke and Draco flushed anew at the hopeful and almost giddy note in Potters voice. “I suppose not.” Tentatively he looked back up feeling faint when he was met with a blinding smile.
Draco finished his potion just a tick before Granger did and they both went up to put their labeled test tubes on Slughorn´s desk.
It was a stupid idea and Draco honestly had no idea why he had ever considered Pansy a smart person. He scoffed again just for good measure ignoring her eyeroll as they walked down the hallways towards the library.
“No promises.” He chocked breathlessly, hating his own voice but forgetting all about that when Potter chuckled, sounding just as breathless as him and moved his hand up to grab at Draco´s hip. They caught each other´s eye both blushing and breathing faster already. Draco clenched his fingers around the blanket almost too scared to move in case this was all a dream.
Harry took off running, weaving through the remaining desks in the classroom and bursting out into the hallway, chasing after Malfoy.
Harry nodded along as the song began, the clashing of the wizarding and Muggle worlds oddly satisfying. Malfoy gave him a strange look as he began humming along, singing a few of the lyrics out loud just because he could.
Draco looked back at him, still smiling, and arching one eyebrow quizzically, obviously confused by the expression on his face.
“Merry Christmas, Draco,” Harry replied, grinning like a madman at this beautiful boy who held multitudes that he never could have imagined. “Well, after that, I don’t think my present is going to hold up, but here you are anyway.”
A moment later, another set of footsteps thudded against the floor as Malfoy came around the corner, robes billowing behind him, stopping short when he saw Harry sitting on the floor. His gray eyes were wide and frantic and his pale cheeks had gone even pinker from running. A lock of his light hair fell over his forehead and Harry felt the sudden urge to push it back for him. Instead, he clenched a handful of his robes and turned his eyes away from the other boy, who was so infuriating, and beautiful, and . . . and confusing! Or maybe it was Harry who the confusing one. Or at least the confused one. Confused by Malfoy, who was watching him so hesitantly, mouth open as though he wanted to say something. But most of all confused by himself and his reaction to the Amortentia. Harry knew that such a powerful potion was unlikely to be wrong. And Snape may be many things, but a poor potion brewer he was not, much as Harry hated to admit it. Which then had to mean that . . . that the strange feeling he had been getting around Malfoy recently was exactly what he had been afraid to admit to himself it was.
“So,” Granger said conversationally, obviously of a similar mindset as Draco and seeking distraction. “A shame Harry didn’t make it for such an interesting lesson.”
“My parents worked directly for the Dark Lord himself and if he hadn’t been killed, who knows what I might have ended up doing?” He said desperately, pausing and gripping onto the back of a chair so hard his fingers went white.
Unsure of how to respond to this movement, Harry decided to pretend he wasn’t there, focusing so hard on the page of his book that the letters became meaningless black squiggles. Suppressing a sigh, Harry wiped the dust motes off of his glasses and tried to get back into the book.
Even Draco had gotten mostly used to it by now. He and Potter had fallen into an uneasy routine. They alternated meals at each other’s tables, making an ungodly amount of effort with each other’s friends during it, as Draco didn’t think it would be seemly for him to get into a fist fight with his apparent boyfriend’s best mate, much as he kept being tempted to by the russet-haired tosser. They walked together to any joint Slytherin-Gryffindor classes, pairing up whenever possible for assignments. In the evenings, they would study at one of the most central tables in the library and then walk back together as far as they could before they had to split to their various dorms. They casually held hands, called each other by their first names the majority of the time, spoke mostly civilized words whenever they had to talk to each other, and played off any fights they couldn’t hold in as lovers’ spats.
