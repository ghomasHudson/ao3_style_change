“Err…” Draco took a moment, trying to think back on the day before. He remembered they had sat down having a drink to celebrate the hex being broken.
“Er… That’s really not… I don’t want to bother-“
“Yeah, what a bummer. I was the perfect bait.” Draco bit out, uncertain as to why he felt angry at Potter’s way of thinking. He was being cunning after all. A true Slytherin would be proud.
Damn it! Draco thought, as his brilliant plan had failed him miserably.
like that.
“That… Why… I mean, it’s me. Why would you?” Draco scrambled to find his words.
They both looked at each other with a hint of cautious shock as Draco slowly got up and could finally put some distance between himself and Potter.
Draco got to work on a potion that had a sort of airiness to it. It was quite lightweight and required him to carefully scoop it up and distribute it into the hair evenly.
Pansy and Hermione was in a serious discussion involving the exams coming up before Christmas. Those two weren’t the ones who should be worrying about passing to be honest, Draco thought to himself. Ron was the biggest concern to the whole group at this point, although Draco still couldn’t help the uneasy feeling of Harry being so damn calm about everything. It was stressing him out, but he knew, if anyone was going to somehow get through it against all odds it would be none other than Harry Potter.
“Really?”
He groaned as he struggled to get back on his feet. Potter was fending off about a dozen dark cloaked figures that were all sending various curses his way.
“Auror Potter!”
“Yeah, so… Well, he told me his room number and said I could go visit. Should bring a headache potion if I could.”
“Ron was late, so I had to get dinner done while simultaneously trying to watch the kids. I will be back in a minute after I’ve cleaned up and had a couple of shots of firewhiskey.”
“Look, Potter. I was only saving you from complete embarrassment. Imagine how people would’ve talked if the wonder boy had turned out to be shite at something as mundane as Quidditch. I wasn’t even that interested in the sport anyway, so I figured I could let you have it. Good grace and all that.” Draco was failing miserably at making his point, since both Ginny and Potter seemed less than persuaded by his words.
“But getting in there isn’t that easy. I had to go through many classes trying to procure the ingredients I needed in order to not seem overly suspicious.” Draco sighed at the thought of having to go through the same procedure once more.
“Yes, about 10 percent of wizards have a reaction to the potion because it’s most commonly brought to a boiled state too quickly. Letting it simmer first avoids the issue of the slug juice being the dominant ingredient.” Draco said while cleaning the used cauldron.
“That’s an awfully long title.” Potter chuckled a bit. “Indeed, it is.” He said smiling fondly at the flames.
“Here you go!” Amelia said as she handed a present to Draco.
“I’m not. You’re on the same level as Hermione when it comes to potions, you might even be better than her, and that says a lot. I’m also the one who messed things up for you when we were switched, so I’m gonna set right my own mistake is all.” Harry shrugged.
years were seen loitering around getting ready for bed. Everyone seemed tired from the journey and not in the mood for staying up late.
“What?! Why??”
“Gather the ingredients needed for any of the potions we’ve discussed and brew it before the end of class.” Shrew said as he finally decided to sit down and look through the previous homework, they had handed in.
“It doesn’t have to same feeling though…” Draco mumbled to himself.
“Yeah, I suppose the news would travel quickly and we would probably have people snooping around for a scope or whatever. However, it might be a good idea, nonetheless. Especially if Hermione can’t figure it out.” Potter said, perching up from his unwillingly intense conversation about dubious creatures with Luna.
“Huh? Oh yeah! No, just thinking, but sure let me try the drinks”
“You brought him medicine?” Lovegood’s dreamy gaze was focused on the dark purple vial standing on the bedside table.
It was still difficult to even imagine something like this working out, but Pansy had always been good at convincing people, and that included Draco as well.
“Please…” Draco could only mutter as it felt agonizing to have Harry touch him all over but not where he truly wanted it.
“Since he became the potential future husband of my best friend. Now, answer my question.” Pansy said, not letting him off the hook.
He saw Potter clutch at his own chest and realised that something was still very wrong.
“How nice of you to do so.”
“Huh?” Draco felt confused for a second.
“Okay, I get that it looks bad coming back here for another Burn-Healing Paste just two weeks after the last one.” He began. “However! It’s only because my quick thinking, heroic attitude and selflessness made me jump in front of people to save them.”
“That’s rude.” Harry pouted slightly; faking being hurt.
“W- What are you doing, Potter?”
“Granger…” He said in a low, almost inaudible voice.
“It… just feels strange…” Draco said, trying to breathe steadily.
“I… about the… the manor-“ Draco stopped short when he felt a warm hand on his cheek, his eyes widen as they darted up to look at Luna.
“I simply had a bad day. Can I assume I’ll see you here again in a week or so, as that seems to be the limit for you to stay uninjured?”
“Fuck!” Draco gasped as he clutched onto Harry’s black hair. Carefully Harry started sucking him off, and it was sending waves of pleasure through Draco’s body.
“Yeah, we always close up for a few days around Christmas. Makes everyone in the company a lot happier as well”.
Sure, he had a few crushes back in the day, but the feeling wasn’t the same either. He didn’t just feel attracted to the way a person looked, no, with Harry he felt attracted to his behaviour, the way he smiled and laughed. He liked how caring he was and how serious he looked when he was baking and creating new pastries.
“I would’ve expected it to be more evened out, but she seems to have inherited your brain solely.” Draco chuckled.
“Yeah… Not really used to this type of weather” Draco felt embarrassed, as his appearance had always been important to him. Now he felt pretty shabby in front of this guy that managed to look stylish even in a black t-shirt and jeans.
“If I get the chance, I might stop by some day.” Draco said, returning to his work. He knew it was a lie, but it seemed easier than trying to argue with Granger. He had seen first-hand how impossible it was and how much misery was plastered over Weasel’s face when he tried to argue with her.
Amelia had sneaked in a small “tell me if Harry does something stupid, and I’ll beat him up” when she and Draco was lagging behind the group one evening.
As Draco tried to refocus on finding the hint of gold in the air, he suddenly saw Potter speed up. For a second he wanted to follow, thinking Potter had seen the snitch. But he soon realised that Potter was steering straight towards him at an incredible speed that only his broom could muster.
“I-… I’m sorry, that was…” Before Draco could come up with a decent excuse for his sudden outburst Harry had closed the gap between them. The kiss was much more passionate than when they had previously kissed. It was overwhelming, as Draco felt feelings of love pour through the kiss and Harry’s strong gaze on Draco after parting their lips only solidified it.
“Temping to go flying now?”
“Shit!” Draco yelled as he felt a curse shoot over his right shoulder, missing him by an inch. He was running while simultaneously trying to avoid the blasts of magic being whirled at him from behind. This is it; I’m going to die. The thought ran through his head in a frenzy as he realised, he was pathetically outnumbered.
Harry continued, unaffected by Draco’s silence. “Looking into it, all I could think of as a possible reason would be the manor. So, I decided to send your mother a letter.”
“He didn’t have time today, sadly” Amelia chimed in before Harry could finish his stuttering.
“Oh, I would never do that.” Luna said her voice tinted with a hint of worry. “It might ruin what is going on between the two of them, you know.” Luna seemed to be truthfully worried about it, which only prompted Ginny to laugh harder as she breathed out “You’re so right, I’m sorry love. There’s no way I want to ruin this blooming relationship!”
“I bet he did.” Draco chuckled a bit at the thought of Weasley grumbling over it.
“Did you see that!?” He whipped around looking at Potter with wide eyes. His whole body was vibrating from the sheer amazement.
“I love you too.”
“It’s not luck, Pans. It’s just your complete lack of potion skills.”
“What is going on…” Potter groaned leaning forward and resting his forehead in his palms.
“About that. Why did you neglect to mention exactly who I would be dealing with?”
“He has no reason to be nice to me though.” Draco whispered back, as a few students passed by them.
“Here we go again…” Draco huffed before meeting her eyes. “Weasley.” He said with a short nod.
“It is, isn’t it? I’m confident when I say she’s the best minister there has ever been!” Weasley grinned obviously proud of showing off his wife’s amazing career life.
Draco opened his eyes and frowned. “Hold on…”
Draco whimpered at the sudden loss of contact. But before he could complain, Harry let the towel slide off his hips as he lined himself up with Draco’s entrance. It was first then that Draco saw Harry’s completely naked body. He would’ve been in awe at the size of Harry’s cock, had it not been for the fact that it was currently set on entering his hole.
Draco felt a thumb slide over his hole slowly. It was such a tender spot that he couldn’t help it as his legs closed involuntarily.
“It’s fine, we’re just about to clean up anyway.” Potter said as he had just been cleaning of the table when Hermione dropped by.
The briefs were quickly discarded, and Draco unconsciously tried to cover himself. He had never been in this situation before, and he couldn’t help the embarrassment.
A few days later and Draco was making his way over to the bakery. He opened the door and was greeted by a room bustling with customers. It seemed like a lot of the customers were taking a trip to the bakery in the few days before Christmas.
It was fun to get to see the town properly and having Harry talk about the various places and their history. The guy did know a surprising lot about quite a few places in the town.
It wasn’t long until Draco realised that the number of people that he could get along with were scarce. The only person he knew would be safe to room with was Blaise, which, with the new rule would be impossible.
“Well…It’s not like you’re gonna find anyone else in this tiny place, anyway, so why not be a bit crazy?” Pansy said between bites, with a shrug.
“If it’s about the other day, then I’m sorry if I overstepped. I don’t want us to end up not talking anymore because of it.” Potter frowned as he looked at him with a troubled expression.
As Harry reached his cock, he slid one finger slowly down the shaft.
“Hey guys!” Hermione was red in the cheeks and only a fraction of her hair was still left in her ponytail.
After the Valentine’s day, things had changed between Harry and Draco. They had barely managed to get any chocolate cookies done in-between kisses and Harry finding it increasingly hard not to touch Draco.
“You’re full of energy early in the morning, huh?”
“Let’s take yesterday for a start, shall we?”
“Isn’t he dating that Weasley girl?” Draco frowned, thinking back to the time he had learned that Potter had decided to date Weasley’s little sister of all people.
Draco opened the gift. Inside was a beautiful glass sculpture of a deer. It had a light blue colour to it, and the details were amazing.
“Maybe you’ll be able to stick to being friends” She said, which made Harry scoff a bit.
“Yes, absolutely! I’ll get to it first thing in the morning!” Granger said, and Draco knew she wasn’t lying about that. Of course, she would be all over this issue until she found a way to fix it. It was ingrained in her to always figure out solutions after all. “However…” her voice sounded a bit more hesitant now as she was addressing Draco. “It would really help if I knew what lead up to this moment.”
“You were awake?!” He yelped out, then felt heat surge to his cheeks as he realised just what he’d been doing while Potter had most definitely been aware of it.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” Draco murmured as he ran his hand through Harry’s messy bed hair.
“Of course.”
Draco desperately tried to find some sort of hair products, but he should’ve known better. As if Potter with his unruly, crazy hair would even know that hair products existed. With a sigh he gave up and could only find some comfort in the fact that his hair could never become the sort of mess that Potter was sporting.
“Fine, you win. I’ll show you.” Harry grabbed his wand before he swiftly moved it and spoke the word “Patronus.”
“You better not embarrass me, Potter.” Draco gave him a pointed look as a grin spread across Potter’s face, making it hard for Draco to recognize his own features. Potter had always shown a lot of his emotions through facial expressions, which Draco thought didn’t suit his own face that usually tried to hide any emotions from showing.
But, of course, Potter had never been able to read a room before, and that certainly hadn’t changed despite the years that had passed by.
‘I’ll have time to think about it before the New Year Eve party’ Draco sighed to himself before getting through the last paperwork he had left for the day.
“Give me 5 minutes first!” Amelia said “I have five different kinds of drinks that I think would maybe suit the new cheesecake recipe, but you have to try them and tell me”.
Draco just nodded slightly, startled at the sudden intimacy between them as well as Potter’s determination.
“I…” Draco hesitated for a moment, also a bit put out by his own words. “I know, Pans. I just… There’s no way he could ever like me, and I just don’t know what to do if I were to hear that from him.”
“Which is?” Draco questioned quietly.
“Don’t worry, you can borrow my shower if you want to. I’ll get you some dry clothes in the meantime” Draco was stunned for a moment, as he realised the weirdness of the whole situation.
“Yeah, you’re right.”
“You’re that easy to read, huh?” Draco taunted, chuckling at Harry’s embarrassment.
Potter, as usual, wasn’t one to step down from a challenge, even when Draco wished he would have done so. Fair enough if it had been with his own body, but why drag Draco’s body into it.
“Hi there.” He felt his hand twitch slightly as he hadn’t heard anyone come in. He looked up to see Granger standing beside him, the look on her face difficult to interpret.
Draco reached down and got hold of Harry’s black hair, feeling the softness of it as he tried not to push down.
“I’m also glad you were right.” Draco agreed, both watching the dim fire crackle as the continued murmuring voices of Ron and Harry could be heard in the kitchen.
“Yeah, well, maybe… We’ll see…” Draco was just tumbling over the words now, barely heard over Pansy’s rush of agreements to the idea.
Hope you like it!
Draco got out some of his work that he had still to finish. He had made a convincing argument for himself as to how it would be good for him to get out of the office for a bit and have a change of working environment. It was perhaps more of an excuse to go to the bakery instead of working overtime at the company or at home, but Draco thought it was a good enough excuse.
It was strange being back at Hogwarts after all that had happened. The castle had already been fully restored showing no indication of having been a key structure in one of the biggest wars in wizarding history.
“That would be too dangerous.” Hermione said.
Harry then went to make some hot chocolate to both of them before they settled down on the couch again and continued talking for a while longer.
“Easy for you to say. There is a small difference between being a prior Death Eater and being the Saviour of the Wizarding World if you haven’t noticed.”
So that’s what Pansy had been talking about when she had urged him to go on some get-together. Certainly not something he would be meddling in.
“Not at all.” Potter shook his head slightly as he took in the environment like it was his first time there. “I must say, you do suit the place though.”
“Fuck.” Harry muttered as Draco pushed down, taking him as deep as he could. He pushed down a few more times, earning himself a string of moans, before pulling away slightly. He pumped his hand down Harry’s cock, licking the slit at the same time. He felt Harry tug at his hair, and as he leaned up, he was caught in a messy kiss.
“Maybe…” Draco muttered, slightly abashed at the compliment. He almost jumped as the alarm went off, and he got back to the potion at hand.
“So casting a Protego is not considered quick thinking anymore?”
“Hey…” Draco started not liking what person came to mind when he considered other bright witches or wizards of their time. “You’re not about to call that Granger girl, are you?”
“Alright everyone, that’s it for today. I do expect you all to reflect on your performance and write three pages on it for next class. Dismissed.” Everyone seemed to whine in unison at the homework that seemingly never stopped increasing.
“Definitely!” Hermione seemed to have calmed herself down enough to sound certain as she spoke. “Hang in there for the night, and it’ll be back to the way it was tomorrow. I’ll discuss these findings with Hannah, and we’ll figure this out, I promise.”
“Well, you didn’t get the Patronus showing, that’s true. But I felt your magic as you tried it, and it’s definitely something there. Just needs a bit more practice, I think.”
“No way! I won’t be able to sleep” Draco felt himself still being on edge from the far too many scares he had been put through.
It was strange, really. The way Pansy and Potter was getting along, and her support for Granger would have been seen as a big joke just a couple years back. But Pansy had changed. That much Draco knew. She had certainly felt the toll of having supported the wrong side during the war, but instead of letting it break her, or keeping her old superiority, she instead chose to change her views. It had made it easier for the both of them to have each other through it all. Many of their former friends and pureblood families were still unable to leave their old beliefs behind them. Being able to have each other, both Pansy and Draco started learning and understanding more about the world besides their parents’ views and it helped them change their own views for the better. So yes, Draco knew that when Pansy said she was happy for Granger, she truly meant every word.
“When did it become Harry and not Potter?” Draco frowned, raising an eyebrow at her.
to make an effort.” Granger was scolding Weasley who looked miserable there he sat at the potion desk picking at the cauldron in front of him.
Harry slid one finger up Draco’s shaft, and it sent tremors through his body. Harry gripped tightly around his cock and started pumping it slowly. It made Draco moan as he arched his back into the touch. Harry’s eyes seemed to grow darker as a smile tugged at his lips.
Draco learns about Harry’s past, his childhood which was so different from his own. They both allow each other to talk and say what’s on their minds without any judgement. It’s the most calm and peaceful Draco has felt in years. Suddenly he’s able to just talk to someone without fearing what it would mean to tell them even the tiniest bit of detail about himself.
He took both his legs and lifted them slightly before kissing Draco’s inner thigh. That sent waves of pleasure up Draco’s body. He clenched the sheets as he felt his body shiver with each kiss getting closer to his cock.
Potter chuckled lightly as Draco accepted the cup. “I just wanted to apologize for my outburst the other day.”
“Having done one ‘heroic’ deed that was forced upon me doesn’t mean I’m capable of absolutely everything.” Draco felt himself scoff loudly at that. Had the great Potter just diminished the importance of defeating the dark lord to just a small ‘heroic’ deed?
Draco, on the other hand, knew he would be lucky to even get a job. He had to focus on his N.E.W.T.s. and only achieving great results in order to maybe be considered for a position where he could actually get the chance to showcase his skills. Even with full scored N.E.W.T.s. his last name could easily make most people turn their back at him.
“Your shop was closest, so I ran over. Luckily you were still here.”
Potter was giving him a sheepish grin as he scratched his head. “It’s not like I’m doing it on purpose.”
“Well, I don’t know about you guys, but I think it’s about time for me to hit the sack” Ron said, stretching.
“What I have is… well, it’s not much, but it’s something.” Granger started. “I do believe the hex we’re dealing with is the stickfast hex, but it seems to have been distorted as it hit you during your apparition. Somehow it must’ve not known what to do as there were nowhere to stick you during your apparition, so instead it settled on the first surface it could find, namely…Harry.”
“I doubt anyone would ever believe anything of such. How are they even allowed to print stuff like that? Wouldn’t they get sued and publicly shamed for it?”
“Right.” Draco breathed, he was still processing the sensations of coming and being filled up. It was something he had never experienced before. Something that felt too addictive.
“Yeah.” Draco muttered as he retreated out the door.
“I’m certain you’re perfectly capable of doing it, or is the status as ‘most powerful wizard’ not applicable after a little workout? I’m so very disappointed.” Draco challenged.
Draco groaned as he opened his eyes, the headache coming at him full force.
Harry slid his hand down to his cock, stroking it to the pace of his thrusting, making Draco whimper. “God. It’s so good. Fuck.” Draco felt himself start to ramble as he was building up.
“Stop it! We’re both gonna fall if you keep this up!”
“Hopefully they won’t drown us in homework from the start.” Draco said answering Pansy’s question as he picked at his toast. His appetite hadn’t recovered since the time the manor had been filled with death-eaters and you-know-who for what felt like an eternity. He found it to be disgraceful as he had become thinner and thinner each day, which had added more worry to his mother. Yet, he couldn’t help it. The endless nightmares had kept him awake at the manor long after the trials, and it appeared they had followed him back to Hogwarts as well.
Once again, Draco could feel his cheeks warming up. This time, however, the reason for it was the awkward similarities of those eyes staring at him in his previous dream.
“Am I interrupting something?” Draco jerked back as he heard a voice behind him. He swirled around only to come face to face with the same person who had just winked at him and given him a lopsided grin.
“You’ll make me expect things if you keep talking like that.” Draco huffed, unable to hold his head up any longer and finally resorting to placing it on the side of Potter’s face, turning it slightly so he could use the pillow behind Potter’s head for support.
They chatted a bit more, until Harry had to go back to tend to the customers. Draco was stopped before he could leave, as Amelia got hold of him.
“Why are you awake?” Draco asked, fiddling with the edge of the blanket.
Draco shrank back a bit at the words, his gaze dropping to the floor. He knew she had every right to hate him for what had happened in the past, but lately he had been in such a good mood, almost forgetting that he barely could get along with anyone other than his friends, and, strangely enough, the golden trio where even Granger would introduce him as a friend to those around her. Suddenly he felt awfully aware of himself, but before he could utter a word, the witch continued.
“And that makes some people a bit afraid. Thinking I might actually use it for evil, despite having seen what that does.” The bitterness was clear in Potter’s voice as he spoke. “Also, the papers can basically write whatever. Or at least they could. Hermione is working on making it better, less conspiracy and more truth, that kinda thing.” Potter said, his voice more relaxed.
“Oh wow… You’re completely drenched!” The guy said as he had turned to properly look at Draco.
“I’m asking if you’d want to go out with me. Romantically I mean.”
He surveyed the long tables until he finally got hold of Granger, still seated at her usual spot besides Weasley.
But Draco knew it would be used against him later.
“That’s not true at all!” Granger said, and it took Draco by surprise at how strangely angry she seemed on his behalf. “You might not think so, but you did change sides during the war, knowing that there would be repercussions for it whether your side wins or loses. Sure, you were one hell of a twat throughout most of school, but you finally took a decision on your own in the end. We were all kids at the time, it doesn’t mean you deserve to die. The ministry didn’t think so, so then why should those damn Death Eaters have a say in it?”.
It dawned on him as he hurried over to the mirror on the closet door, hoping to be wrong about his deduction. “This can’t be happening!” He felt horrified as he was met with green eyes and what could only be described as a bird’s nest of black hair sticking out everywhere on his head.
For a moment they both just stayed like that, feeling the aftermath of it. Draco whimpered as Harry pulled out slowly. He could feel semen leaking out from his hole, and knowing it was Harry’s made him shudder in delight.
Potter had only managed to get up into a kneeling position as his movements stopped short when realising his own wand was pointed towards him. He looked dishevelled and slightly bloody from the earlier fight.
“Well, most of them are cold-blooded killers who see nothing but the dark lord. And they seem to only go after ‘traitors’ at this point, so it’s not overly concerning though, is it?” Draco felt himself sound much more nonchalant than he truly felt. He just couldn’t help the guilt that started to tighten at his chest. He wasn’t really a man worth saving to begin with, that much he knew. He had, after all, made terrible decisions that had aided the Death Eaters in their quest.
“You sure? You should tell me if I’m hurting you.”
Harry slowed his thrusting and rode out the orgasm with his eyes closed.
“Is this normal?” Draco whispered to Hermione as they both sat there waiting for whatever was happening to finally end.
“I did not!” Draco protested, feeling his face flush.
“Oh! Yeah, just lacking some sleep” Draco waved it off, as he got some paper to clean up the spilled coffee.
It took Draco a moment to process why Granger was looking so overwhelmingly shocked as well as what exactly was creating said astonishment. He looked back at Potter and then it hits him. He was literally sitting in Potter’s lap with his arms clutched tightly around his neck. Even Draco found that to be a rather precarious situation to be in.
Draco tried making as little noise as possible as he got ready for breakfast. He had the feeling that interacting with Potter would not be the best way to start his first day back at Hogwarts.
“Oh, I’m very nice, so nice I’ll even help you get that mop back into its natural state of mess.”
“Was it all nightmares?” At this Draco closed his eyes to try and remember. He had been too focused on the times he had seen you-know-who that he hadn’t taken the time to realise that there had been moments where everything felt peaceful. He would be enjoying late nights with Hermione and Weasley or fly across the quidditch field so fast that he felt like nothing could stop him.
“Here, I put together quick dinner for you. Of course, you don’t have to eat it, but I just thought you looked a bit tired, so maybe it would be nice not to have to make it yourself” Harry said as he handed him a plastic bag with a container inside it.
“Look at me!” Draco hissed back, and as Potter turned, he just stared at him for a minute in complete silence.
“That’s not it.” Potter had visibly tensed at Draco’s words, confirming Draco’s long suspicion that Potter was still not able to accept having lost people in the war. “You just look… sick… or exhausted.”
He felt his muscles contract as Potter’s hand travelled down to the waistline of his trousers before it started massaging his cock, making him moan softly. The slow teasing left him completely hard as he clutched at the sheets.
*Warning*
He had ruined it… Everything… The friendship he had built with Harry over the last couple of months, the friends he had got through Harry and the moments of shared happiness was all gone. Just because of him, not being able to keep his feelings out it all.
“Prat.” Draco grumbled.
potion skills to that extent as well.
“It’s also easier if your stance is proper. Here-“ Potter lifted Draco’s arm up, pointing it forward, while lightly pushing his foot between Draco’s to widen his stance. “This looks better.”
“Only a little. Rumours spreads quickly you know.” Draco shrugged. Potter nodded his interest faltering as he resumed to reading through the various papers.
Draco put the cauldron back to its place quickly and only when Potter was out the door having looked more than pleased with himself, could Draco sit down and let a big sigh escape his lips.
“It’s… busy…” He said, not meeting the eyes of the man leaning against the wall of the Malfoy company.
“Alright, fine. Obviously I’m not as dense as you two are when it comes to seeing what’s right in front of me.”
“I had to keep myself from laughing to be honest. I’ve never heard a Malfoy struggle so much with his words before. It was refreshing really. Made me realise just how much you liked him.”
“I just… In case you ever were to come knocking, I didn’t want you to feel the wards and decide not to go any further.” Potter’s voice was low as he spoke. “I made sure to not include you in the wards.”
“I was just caught off guard when I turned around and your hair was back to its normal state of horrendous untidiness. Something like that would scare anyone.” Draco huffed, trying to save his grace just a little bit at least.
“Yeah, yeah.” Draco waved him off. “I’ll believe it when it actually happens.”
“I won fair and square!” He said as he was walking to the door, Draco following him and sighing.
“That’ll be 12 Galleons.”
After putting the paste on Weasley’s shoulder, he was coerced into another round of wizarding chess as Weasley so eloquently stated “It helps me calm down, so I won’t just be sitting here worrying.”
As Draco entered the room again, he saw that Potter was soundly asleep already. He had only bothered to draw the bed curtains the first few days before he deemed it too troublesome. This regrettably led to Draco seeing his messy bed hair every single morning. Fair enough, Potter wasn’t an ugly guy, but there had to be limits to how untidy someone’s hair could be.
“You really must be more daft than I thought if you’re putting that much trust in your former nemesis. Who’s to say I wouldn’t send in some anonymous tips on the kinds of potions the great saviour is buying in a small inconspicuous potion shop?”
“It’s been a while, Granger. Or should I say, Minister of Magic.” The well-mannered, calm response, despite the current situation, sounded ridiculous. However, it was all Draco could do, as the option to run away or look any sort of decent was frankly impossible at the moment.
Just then Potter caught Draco’s stare and Draco furrowed his brows giving him a glare. Potter was just as infuriating as he had been since the start of 8
“Oh, how nice of you to say, Potter.” Draco couldn’t help the bite in his words, as he cursed his own misfortune.
“Poor darling… Maybe if you send him a letter begging him to wear one, he’ll come by and let you have a look, eh?”
Draco snorted and they both silently took comfort in knowing each had to carry the weight of being the brains in their relationships.
Draco readjusted his scarf in order to hide the slight pink that was now dancing on his cheeks.
“Oh! Yeah, my sister is much more proficient at potions than me, so she’ll be helping me.” The witch said, mirroring the smile back, seemingly relaxing her tensed shoulders a bit before accepting the bag that Draco had put everything into.
“What are you saying, love? Why not make it your business? I can tend the shop if you want to leave now? Or I can come with you and wait outside if you want? Either way, you’ve been given permission by none other than one of his best friends to visit him, so why not take it? I’m sure he’ll appreciate it immensely. Especially if you bring the potion as well!”
“Fuck, Harry…” Draco felt his cock tremble as he was filling up more and more. But before he could reach it, Harry slid his fingers out.
“I’m still literally right here.”
“Although I wouldn’t say I’m the best minister there was, I’m glad to hear that the new laws have made a difference, that is indeed the most important thing.” She smiled. “I’ve been on leave for a while now though. Not long until the baby is due.” She sighed. “Having one on the way, a toddler and constantly feeling nauseous was just too much.”
He walked past some Auror’s practically running to and from places. Noting that the whole department seemed rather busy and frantic this morning. To him that was a blessing in itself, as most seemed to ignore his presence altogether.
“Oh my god!” Hermione looked frantic as she could only stand and watch the events unfold in front of her eyes.
The Potter that he had seen so far was more composed and didn’t seem to take much notice whenever Draco gave him a disdainful look as they passed each other. Draco knew he should be careful with how he behaved now that the war was over, he had chosen a side although with not much of an option, and he would have to live by that decision for the rest of his life. Trying to piss of Potter wasn’t gonna help his stay at Hogwarts or his future. However, the lack of animosity between them, mainly from Potter’s side, made everything seem too unnatural for Draco. He needed something that had been normal before everything changed or he would surely loose it sooner or later.
“Good morning! I had to leave early to get some ingredients from a nearby village, please eat the breakfast I made for you and you don’t need to lock up before you leave. Have a good day!” The note said.
As Potter tried to calm the situation, Macmillan had pushed him harshly against the wall.
“Really?” Potter looked slightly impressed as he continued. “I was recommended this shop by a mate. I had no idea Parkinson was so proficient at potion brewing.”
“What?” Draco was taken aback slightly at the sudden question.
“You’re a prat…” Draco mumbled, feeling a bit heated as he was pinned to the wall after having given a confession.
“Huh? What did you-” Harry was cut short by the sudden chanting that had started.
Draco arched his back as he moaned at the fast pace Harry was moving at. Just hearing Harry’s hitched breath behind him and feeling the strong hands gripping his hips made him feel a second wave of heat rise up.
“That’s just because you can eat the result, isn’t it?”
“I’m not fucking doing anything!” Potter’s voice was still reasonably filled with horror as he too tried to push Draco off.
“You saved Potter?”
“Malfoy?!” Granger’s voice went up a few notes, her eyes big and full of disbelief and shock.
“You and Harry.” Luna said before her eyes widen slightly. “Oh, was that supposed to be a secret? I’m so sorry, Draco?” It felt odd hearing his first name spoken so lightly by someone not in his group of friends.
“Yeah, I asked Narcissa to keep it a secret from you, as I figured you wouldn’t be too happy about it.”
Potter had complimented him, saying it wasn’t long now until he would be able to do it. Just had to properly focus and find the strongest memory he could. It had put Draco in a good mood for several days, where he even joined Pansy in her shopping spree in the places he usually avoided.
“It’s fine… I’ll live.” Draco said back, reasoning with himself that Potter had already gone through the trouble of keeping him out of Azkaban. It would be a bit farfetched to think he’d bother with him after all that. Although he would probably be able to do whatever he wanted without anyone questioning him, Draco thought. It was highly likely that Potter could’ve gotten away with murdering him in broad daylight if he so wished. Luckily for Draco, he knew Potter was not evil. That much was certain, so perhaps he could survive this year even under the current circumstances.
“It’s certainly better than the current predicament.” Draco muttered, not lifting his head still.
“Stop it. You’re not a death-eater anymore, and I know you never wanted to follow that path to begin with. You were forced.” There was a hint of comfort in the words Potter was saying. His strong faith in him was admirable, but it also made other feelings rise inside of Draco. Sure, he hadn’t wanted to be a death-eater, but he hadn’t gone against it, not enough. He had been too much of a coward to choose a different path, and he knew he would’ve never had the same courage as Potter had in order to defy and kill the dark lord.
The next week went by slowly. Too slowly, in Draco’s mind. It was hard to keep his focus and to be honest he had been thinking too much about spending time with his friends. It had been particularly boring to not be able to spend any time with Harry, since he was busy with the bakery and Draco himself was working non-stop through the week.
“I…I don’t understand… I mean…” Harry was stuttering and looked completely lost there he stood.
“Oh… Well, as long as everything is fine” Harry said, Draco could feel that Harry wasn’t overly convinced, but he was kind enough to let it be it seemed like.
“I must say, I was a bit surprised though.” Draco felt himself glancing over at Potter as he prayed that he wouldn’t somehow manage to knock down one of the stands. “I wasn’t aware of the fact that we were, somehow, romantically involved as she put it.”
Harry, appeased by the response, seemed to relax more.
“Also, you’re coming here almost daily, so you’re one of our best customers to start with. You deserve some free samples just for the effort, if you ask me” Amelia laughed.
The idea of returning to Hogwarts was far from what he had imagined. Yet, the possibility of finding any sort of work in the wizarding world without N.E.W.T.s. after the war was close to zero when your last name was Malfoy.
“I can’t! It’s weird if I go too often, isn’t it? I’m sure he or Weasley will pop by any day now anyways.”
Granger stopped short as she took in the sight in front of her. For a second everyone is just frozen in place, when finally, Potter decides to act.
Potter followed his gaze towards the flames, cracking and sending small sparks flying. “I’m sure she’ll pop by the minute she has something to share.”
After a while both decided it was time to head to bed, and Harry had put Draco’s clothes to dry over the night.
“I still need this one and…” Draco skimmed through the page once more, memorizing what he still needed in order to make the potion.
Harry had come to the conclusion that Draco might’ve realised that he didn’t particularly like Harry as much as he thought. Perhaps the dates had been bad enough for him to realise something
Anxious to get away, Draco excused himself to the front of the shop. Luckily, he was saved by another customer who needed a few ingredients. Draco made sure to take his time deliberately explaining the process of the potion to the poor customer, who probably thought the visit would be swift, and void of a frantic shop keeper who wouldn’t let him leave before he knew every single brewing method for each ingredient.
“Yeah, of course!” Harry chimed in, feeling his curiosity take over, as Draco had mostly been on the receiving end of offers to spend time.
“It needs to be ingested right before going to bed, and hopefully, if it works, it’ll turn us back before morning.” Draco added, looking at Potter.
Both jumped when Weasley grunted loudly.
Even during dinner, Draco was sat at his usual spot on the counter watching as Harry prepared it.
He sighed and nuzzled into the warmth, before he realised that it wasn’t a bed he was draped across. Instead, he felt a firm chest underneath him. A naked chest that is.
“Yeah, yeah…” Weasley huffed. “Doesn’t matter though, I’ll still beat you. I know how you play now!” He looked smug as he said it.
He must be relieved to know he won’t have to be stuck forever to his former nemesis who had, just five minutes ago, also admitted to harbouring feelings towards him.
“Is this the last of it?” Harry looked rather stunning as he was wearing a t-shirt and carrying a moving box that made his muscles stand out in full view for Draco to drool over.
Draco felt himself relax into the touch. He knew that no matter what Potter wasn’t a bad guy. He wasn’t someone who would hurt him.
“I think so too.” Draco muttered.
years, gather around!” Draco felt Pansy tug at his sleeve as they heard McGonagall’s voice.
“Can I help you?” Draco arched an eyebrow. “I’m not usually tasked to do something for the law department.”
“Oh… Uh… Yeah, I hope I’m not intruding” Draco felt a bit awkward as he hadn’t fully thought about the possibility that Amelia wouldn’t like the idea of having him join in on their Christmas party.
“Yeah, the endless meetings are often giving me a headache”.
Draco just nodded and turned to the back room, Potter following behind him. As Draco started gathering the ingredients, Potter decided to look through the various potion notes this time around.
“By the way…” Draco said turning to the guy once more “the cake you gave me… It was pretty amazing. It’s gotta be one of the best cakes I’ve tasted”.
Harry’s movements were interrupted quickly as Draco grabbed the back of his neck and yanked him back into his personal space. Where the sudden confidence was coming from, Draco had no idea. But he was sick and tired of having Potter so close and then for nothing to happen a second later.
“Watch out!” He heard the warning but felt himself unable to act quickly enough. As he braced himself for the pain coming his way, he was yanked away with so much force that he stumbled to the ground.
However, it wasn’t that easy when he now constantly had Potter within arm’s reach and the scrawny boy had grown into something actually resembling a fine man.
“That’s okay. I’m not exactly experienced in this either when it comes to two guys, so we can just do what’s comfortable and go from there, alright?” The reassuring smile was back, and it was damn good at its job of being comforting.
“Then why don’t St. Mungo do that? I wouldn’t try to avoid getting it treated for as long as possible, if it was prepared like that.”
He felt a slight burn as Harry’s finger started sliding out and in of his hole in a slow pace. He continued the motion for a while until Draco breathed out “Another one.”.
“You’ve been to one?” Draco looked at him with wide eyes. He didn’t think Harry of all people would ever be needing the help of a mind healer. He was a hero after all, wasn’t he? But then again, that was ignorant to think. If anything, Harry had been through the most.
Draco was just about to close up shop when he heard the jingle sound of the door opening and the sounds of the thundering storm outside could be heard loudly through the empty room.
“That’s good!” Potter said unexpectedly, a smile on his face as he stepped back.
“You’ve been imagining this?” Harry turned his head in surprise at Draco.
Potter looked up from the current document he was working on and chuckled lightly, the flames from the fireplace reflecting his glasses and making it difficult to properly see his eyes. “Miracles do happen after all, it seems.”
Draco wasn’t pulling away, so Harry figured it would be fine to taste a bit more.
“Oh… Is it bad? I’m sure Hermione has some medicine laying around if you-“ Draco cut her off before she could finish her sentence. “It’s fine, I just need some sleep and quiet” Draco said. He was sure Amelia had noticed his strained expression and that something else was up with him, but she did not press the matter.
Harry looked to the side of the bed, searching for his wand before casting a nonverbal spell at his hand. It procured a thick lube that he smeared across his fingers. Draco would’ve been impressed with his spell work, had it not been for the situation at hand taking all of his attention.
“My place is something I got from my father as a work gift, I hate it…” Draco scoffed.
“He’s an Auror, huh…?” Draco muttered.
“She said she talked to you the other day and you confirmed it. I asked whether you explicitly said it or not, and that made her a bit more unsure, but still not enough to make her believe my objections properly.” Potter shrugged. He looked far too calm about the whole ordeal in Draco’s opinion.
“I think it’s rather cute.”
The minute of awkward silence between them gave Draco a chance to take in everything that was currently going on. He quickly realised that he was basically straddling his completely naked nemesis, while their chests were pressed together firmly. He also found that the only way to relax his head and neck was by leaning it onto Potter’s shoulder. If he hadn’t been so worn-out from the fight, he would’ve tried to keep his head as far away from Potter’s shoulder as he possibly could, but his pride would have to wait.
“I like you in this kind of way” Draco said once more, feeling himself blush at having to state it so many times.
“Alright, fine… As long as wine is included, I’ll allow it.”
“It’s not… I don’t want to stop, but if you…” Draco mumbled having to battle himself between wanting to feel more of Harry and the sudden fear he was feeling.
“You okay?”
“P-please!” Draco managed to gasp out. His cock was throbbing, and he could feel himself building up.
“No! I too, I mean…” Harry scrambled for the words for a second before smiling down at him warmly. “I love you too.”
“Right.” Hermione said solemnly. “It might look like his life is easier than it actually is. I always feared what might happen to him in the long run, having people constantly invading his personal space.” She looked troubled as she spoke.
“I…” Harry said, catching his breath. “I’d like for us to live together as well”.
“Hey, wake up Potter!” Draco was astounded at how easily Potter managed to sleep through the ruckus he was making.
Harry slid his hand down Draco’s stomach before positioning himself properly between Draco’s legs.
“Won’t the weasel be worried about you?”
“Sure.” Draco said, not able to decline her invitation a second time. He also couldn’t imagine Potter would come invite him along to their tea-time, but then again, Potter was one who always surprised people.
Draco narrowed his eyes slightly as he regarded Potter who was whipping up a sauce at the moment. “Never mind…” Draco huffed out in defeat, as Potter looked unbothered by his own prior actions.
“I’m glad.” Harry smiled warmly, and Draco still felt an odd sensation at having Harry direct such kind and loving expressions his way. It had always been sneers and glares back when they were still students.
“What?”
‘I’ll know when I wake up.’ Draco thought to himself as he hid the potion again and leaned his head back down on his pillow. He slowly dozed off, hoping that the potion would soon start to take its effect on him.
They had spent so much time together, and Draco had spent more than a few times sleeping over at his place. Harry had never really thought about it before, but he now realised that it felt like Draco didn’t really have anyone else around him that he was close to.
Impressively enough she managed to keep the other two from speaking until they were sat in charms class listening to the professor.
It happened so quickly that Draco barely managed to swallow a gasp before his head was yanked up and Potter had a strong grip on the back of his head, fingers clutched around blond strands of hair tightly.
After a split second of shock at what Granger was seeing compared to what truly happened, Draco scrambled to get up from Potter’s lap, wanting to reassure Granger that she had once again had very bad timing with her entrances.
“You know… it’s quite nice to be coming out of the shower and seeing you in my flat.” Harry grinned as Draco slipped into the bed beside him.
The pounding got faster and faster, making it difficult to breath. It didn’t take long before Draco felt himself tighten even more as he came with a loud moan. His come shot out onto both his and Harry’s chests. It seemed to tip Harry over the edge as well as he became ridged and stilled his thrusting. He came hard and plentiful, groaning as he closed his eyes, feeling every single sensation. Draco also closed his eyes as he felt his hole fill up with warm cum.
“It did always seem a bit too crowded no matter the time you went there. I always felt a little bit claustrophobic there, so I can’t imagine how it would be for someone who’s deemed the most famous person in the whole wizarding world.”
“Of course, sorry if I take too much of your time” Harry said apologetic as he knew how much work Draco had to do on a daily basis.
“I wouldn’t dream of it.” It just gave Draco a sense of uneasiness, as Potter was too much of a wildcard in general.
He stared at the small tracking device that had once again found its way to his lab after another one of Potter’s spectacular stunts out in the field.
Thank you for reading so far :)
“Yeah, I… I have a friend over from my hometown, so I wanted to get something for her as well”
He was a Malfoy after all, and that meant pushing his feelings far down while keeping his chin raised high. “I’ve spent years at Hogwarts already, one more won’t make much of a difference.” He told her as she hugged him goodbye.
“How you’re so shite at potions, when you’re able to cook so well.”
“You’re a pretty guy, I’m sure he won’t turn you down” Pansy said, knowing full well she had no idea whether or not that was true. But the thought of Draco passing up a chance at love was not an option.
“Well, I guess it was those qualities that saved us all, so we bitterly have to accept them.” Draco hummed back with a small smile forming on his lips.
The first few times they had met had been fairly awkward to say the least. After the whole war and trials being over, it was strange to stand face to face with his old school rival and the thought of having been on different sides in said war. Draco knew better than to make a scene and was definitely not about to give anyone any reason to doubt his current position as a worker within the ministry. Potter had only nodded shortly and seemed as nonchalant about everything as he always had. Sure, he had grown since their childhood years, and the once scrawny boy had now turned into a young man that filled out his Auror uniform properly and had layers of authority surrounding the air around him. He had grown up, Draco noted. Much more than he himself had. His only victory was the few inches of difference still apparent in their heights.
“Y-yeah.” Draco scrambled to get his wand out, awkwardly going along with it all.
“What the fuck am I watching right now?” Draco frowned and looked between the two guys having some sort of ‘bro moment’ going on.
“I suppose if they were madly in love with me, then yes.” Harry hummed jokingly in response.
Harry had showed a second of surprise on his face from the persistence of Draco before letting himself be drawn into the blonde’s actions.
Perhaps this time he would finally be able to sleep properly without the hauntings of his past.
“I think I should bring him home now. Molly’s been watching Rosie, so we’ll have to get back soon.” Granger said, taking another sip of her tea before waking Weasley.
“Damn it.” Draco huffed as he had procured nothing.
‘I’ll be heading home for Christmas now, and I’ll be bringing someone with me. I hope you do not mind. The skies have finally cleared, and I can honestly tell you that I am fine, mother. I hope you are doing well, and I’ll be swift in my arrival. Until then. Signed your son Draco Malfoy.’
“You can try moving now.”
Everyone went silent as Weasley’s voice rang out. To be fair it seemed like it wasn’t just Draco who had forgotten that Weasley had been dragged into the whole ordeal at this point as well.
It took a moment for Draco to realise that he had muttered his thoughts out loud, and he instantly felt heat rise at the back of his neck.
With a slow pace, Harry pushed a finger in, and Draco felt his body react as he spread his legs wider allowing more access. He moaned as he felt the heat enter him. Harry’s other hand was stroking his thigh in a soothing motion.
“That’s not very convincing considering your state right now.” Potter’s eyes dropped down for a second, only to make his point clear. Draco knew without looking. He knew he was hard, probably had been since seeing Potter walk around in only a towel.
Potter was standing behind him. His hand holding onto Draco’s wrist as he was motioning for the movement needed for the spell. It was then Draco realised that he was still slightly taller than Potter, but not by a lot. Potter had grown taller during the last years or so, and his breath felt like fire as it hit the back of Draco’s neck.
His father had said something about making it look more ‘homely’ in order for more people to want to work with them. It was perhaps a good business tactic, Draco thought, but to him it didn’t really matter. He was just glad to be able to escape the big cities where he had spent most of his life.
“I love…I…” He felt his breath stop for a second as he convulsed, white streaks smearing over his and Harry’s stomachs.
Draco felt weird as he tied a red and golden tie around his neck. It was outrageous to be draped in the clothes of the Gryffindor house instead of Slytherin. The only relief about it was that it wasn’t his own body who had to wear these colours.
Draco had started to enjoy walking back to his villa rather than taking his car, as the town was small and beautiful with cherry blossom trees and flowers making the sidewalks look like paintings.
“I think she’s right…” Hermione said thoughtfully.
“It’s karma. I finally understand the hardships I put people through with my endless rants and questions.”
But each to their own, Draco thought. He was aware of the fact that people have their own reasons for what they do in life, and he had learned not to bother too much with other people’s business. It might be why he had a hard time making friends, or maybe it was just his lack of interest in properly getting to know other people.
Harry continued on lifting his t-shirt and kissing down his stomach, making Draco gasp and shiver as he started stroking his thighs.
Harry sighed as he cleaned the counter mindlessly. It had been a few weeks, and he hadn’t had the chance to talk to Draco at all.
“What?!” Draco’s eyes widen in surprise with the realization that Potter clearly didn’t trust him at all. Sure, it wasn’t weird for Potter not to trust him, but to think Draco hadn’t learned his lesson from the whole war and all. It made something twist uncomfortably within Draco’s stomach.
“It’s… well, you’ll just have to hear me out once we get back. And just as you know, I was reluctant about asking you.” Draco sighed, earning himself a strange look from Granger.
It was a peaceful atmosphere, and Draco wondered why he hadn’t taken her up on the offer to have tea earlier. Perhaps he just felt much more confident to face everyone now that he had someone by his side. Someone he trusted fully.
“Good seeing you too.” Draco said, feeling a hint of relief at knowing his friends would be accompanying him back to Hogwarts. He hadn’t been too sure whether or not any of the former Slytherins would return.
“Yup! I’m a good listener you know” She grinned.
It was weird, but it also made Harry feel a surge of something in his stomach. The quiet voice that always seemed to hold a hint of nervousness in it, had started sounding cuter by the day.
The past few days Draco had felt something strange when he and Potter crossed paths. He knew what had caused it though, as the previous conversation they had delved into involved lots of shouting, heavy crying and falling asleep tightly locked into an embrace with Potter.
“Great.” Draco muttered.
I don’t want to die! He felt the desperate plea rush through his tired body mustering up just enough strength to apparate. The shouts and screams disappeared as he felt himself being jerked away at the exact time that another spell came at him.
“Well, I would say he’s more the beautiful type if I had to categorize him” Amelia said, wanting to see how far she could take this before Harry even realised what he was actually uttering about
“You live above the bakery?” Draco asked as they walked up the stairs.
“Want to hold my hand, love?”
“The Auror department is doing their best! Only a few have still not been caught, but the Aurors are working day and night to get them.” Granger said, not letting Draco’s bitterness insult the Great Harry Potter that easily.
“Okay.”
“Why do you ask?” Harry seemed slightly perplexed at the sudden out-of-nowhere question.
Draco fell back onto the bed, pulling Harry with him as he did. “I want it.” Draco could hear his voice being hoarse as he spoke. “Please, let’s do it.”
Saying he was shocked was an understatement. How dense was that bloody idiot anyway? Draco felt his cheeks go a dark red and couldn’t help the feeling of embarrassment that washed over him when he realised just how much effect Potter’s actions had on him.
“Why, do you know something about Patronuses that I don’t?”
“Well, I’d say from the moment you allowed yourself to be vulnerable with me, but it seems like I might’ve liked you since before that.” Harry said, lightly kissing him. “I enjoy being with you, and there were a few times I had to hold myself back from touching you.” Draco gaped at this. Was Harry for real? There was no way.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, I’ve never really… I mean, I’m a bit horrible when it comes to cooking or baking” Draco said sheepishly.
“Oh… Yes, the potion. The potion, yes it has to, the time of day is really, you have to make sure-“
“Hmm… It would’ve been easier if I knew what spell hit you, but I’m also wondering if it kinda ended up clashing with your apparition and therefore twisted it. It would explain the weird effect it has on you two, because I’m fairly certain it’s a type of sticking spell.” Granger said, looking thoughtful for a second. “I’ll read up on it and see if my assumptions hold some sort of truth to them.”
“I didn’t know how you felt, so I didn’t want to ruin the friendship we had managed to build.” Harry shrugged, being too calm about the situation for Draco’s liking.
“I think the most important thing to ask right now is-“ Draco said ignoring their want for an answer. “Do you know any spell or so that could get us out of this… sticky… situation.”
“I promise I won’t try to kill him.” Potter laughed loudly as he straightened out his robes.
“Of all people… It had to be Potter.”
“Short version?” Potter said, not waiting for an answer. “That you’re not a bad person, you’ve gone through more than enough and you deserve a chance despite having a sharp tongue at times.” Potter shrugged.
Draco slumped down on his bed with a loud sigh as he felt the exhaustion rush over him. Having to pretend to be Harry Potter was far more tedious than he had ever imagined. The guy was supposed to have an easy life being the chosen one with all his popularity, but no… Draco had gone through too much disrespect and annoyance throughout the last week. Potter never had a minute for himself, and although Granger and Weasley were trying to help, it still felt like he was constantly being drowned in people wanting his attention.
“A doe?”
“Hi…” He heard the familiar voice behind him, which as of late, had been strangely unnatural as Draco was being far more timid around him.
Draco jumped in surprise as a door beside the bakery opened up behind him. He turned around to see the all too familiar face of the bakery guy.
Yet another jump scare made Draco yelp as he tried to hold on to the glass of soda in his hand.
“I must admit that pointing a wand at and calling the person who saved you a pretentious fool is a bit harsh.” Potter kept the eye contact, making Draco feel even more uneasy.
“Yeah, of course. He was so excited to hear about the whole romance going on.” Pansy said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“No, I- I’m fine. Just need to keep breathing, so I don’t-.” Draco stopped himself midway, feeling heat rise to his cheeks at the fact that he was struggling so badly with restraining himself.
“Sorry about that, I’m so used to the customers being from around here, so normally we don’t talk much about it and everyone just knows that when the weather gets bad everything kinda just closes down for a while”. The guy said, weirdly apologetic to something Draco felt was his own fault.
“I thought you said you could handle scary movies” Harry grinned.
“I like you, I can’t hide it anymore” Harry said, stroking a hand carefully across Draco’s cheek.
“You lot! Meeting in Draco and Potter’s room, now.” Pansy looked livid as she barged into the common room followed by Blaise and Potter.
“Oh, come off it, Potter. You used to be much more fun back in the days when you actually tried to stand up for yourself.” Draco snickered. “It hardly worked, but at least you made an effort back then. Getting old?”
“Yeah, it was quite a spectacle. I even had to step in and help here and there” Sebastian said, not looking overly bothered by the fact that he could spend more time with the person he loved.
“What’s going on?” Granger looked between them with worry and confusion at the sudden change in their behaviour.
Draco had been able to deal with such antics so far. However, things got a bit trickier as Potter waltzed into the shop one day at an odd hour when only Draco was working at the shop.
“It’s a misunderstanding. I’m not together with Potter, we were having an argument as you walked in, nothing else.” It felt awkward having to convince Granger of all people that Potter wasn’t his boyfriend.
That was when it clicked in Draco’s head.
“I’ve been busy as of late.” Draco had received a fair share of letters from his mother, but when she had returned to the topic of visiting his father in Azkaban, he hadn’t been able to send her a letter back. She knew how he felt about his father, and she should’ve known better than to ask him about it. “She should rather find a hobby instead of starting to talk about my private life to just about anyone.” Draco said bitterly.
“I mean, like what Christmas present will you give him? Or is it secret? I know Harry has been pretty busy getting one for you”.
“Oh! Then I’m sure she’ll like these” Harry pointed to one of the very delicious pastries in front of him “It’s a puff pastry blueberry version”.
“I was just lost in thoughts.” Draco defended as Blaise didn’t not lower his gaze.
“I’ll move.” Potter said and didn’t waste any time as he headed over to the couch and slumped down, clutching at his chest, which was still very much naked. The pain ebbed out as they were now standing close to one another once more. However, Draco didn’t spare him another glance before heading into the bathroom with only a small sting in his chest present. He made sure not to spend as much time as he had the day before, but just enough to compose himself from the utter embarrassment.
“I don’t want to be a bother, I’m sure I’ll be able to get back home” Draco said back, feeling a bit torn between not wanting to bother others and the dreadful thought of having to walk through this weather.
Draco had to mentally shake his head to avoid completely losing control of himself.
all today”.
“Then we’ll figure something else out.”
“Yeah… I’m just wondering if you are?” Draco looked at him questionably.
Sure, he wasn’t the most experienced guy, but he had kissed someone before, and it had never left such a big impression on him as Potter’s kiss did. He could feel his heart rate rising rapidly and knew Potter must’ve felt it too.
“I can’t believe I just had a civil conversation with a Weasley…”
Harry positioned himself better and lifted Draco’s legs up slightly, allowing him better room to enter him. He coated his cock in lube before guiding it to Draco’s entrance.
“Yes.” Draco all but whispered back, not trusting his voice at this point.
They both followed her into the back of the house and through a quaint turquoise door that led to a beautiful garden filled with numerous flowers in different colours.
“You ready?” Harry asked, waiting for Draco to give him the thumbs up.
“Oh really? I’ve already managed to have Potter recommend the shop to even you, despite knowing our history, so how sure are you that he will take your side? He clearly likes the shop, and I’m willing to bet it’s not
Somehow, touching Potter’s hair had always been something Draco hadn’t even dared think about. It just seemed too intimate and too off-limit for him to even consider a possibility.
“But no one can beat the Chudley Cannons.” Ron looked smug as he spoke, blissfully unaware of how bad his favourite team actually was.
They sat in silence for a moment until the train started speeding up and they were on their way to a final year at Hogwarts.
“Yeah, sorry about that…” Harry reached out and touched Draco’s cheek. “This really did it though. I should’ve told you properly to begin with. I’m not even sure why I hesitated. I love you. A lot. And seeing you in danger like this made me realise that despite having thought it would be better for you not to be with me considering what people might think or do towards you, I now know you’re safest with me. We can make it work, as long as we’ve got each other, I’m sure of it now. So, I’m sorry. I should’ve told you my worries and how I felt much sooner.”
“Well, if you’re trying to convince me to move in, you’ve definitely succeeded.” Draco joked, laughing as Harry pretended to look overly relieved.
“Who? Luna?” Potter asked, his eyebrows lifting slightly.
There was a moment of silence before Potter spoke again. “I’m sorry if I pushed you into admitting something you weren’t comfortable admitting.”
Back to Draco’s POV
intend to apply for?” Draco knew his voice was on the verge of a sneer, but Weasley seemed too preoccupied with the topic at hand to notice.
“Well, I didn’t really have the luxury of time to wait around and ask for your permission.” Potter shrugged; his relaxed behaviour was only igniting more anger in Draco as he came to the realisation that Potter was, in fact, not afraid of him regardless of the power balance between them.
He was at this point clinging to his umbrella with all his might, as he first now realised just how stupid he had been for believing he could walk through this terrible weather.
After first spreading it all over, Draco started properly working it into the hair. The potion didn’t make the hair wet or anything, but rather just attached to it without one being able to properly feel it there.
“You can move.” Draco breathed out.
“You sure about that, mate?” Ron said, not overly fond of the idea.
“Malfoy.” She looked sick to her stomach, and Draco felt himself shrink under her gaze. There was no saving this, was there?
However, luck was not on Draco’s side as he slumped back down into Potter’s lap the moment he tried to get up. He first looked at Potter in disbelief thinking he had been the one dragging him back down again. Potter just arched an eyebrow and looked down between them. That’s when Draco realised his ministry badge had somehow entangled itself with Potter’s own Auror badge. He was therefore, unfortunately, stuck in Potter’s lap for the time being.
But now… Now he knew it had been a disastrous decision of him. He had just robbed her of her last remaining family member, and she would never know the reason for it. He cursed himself as he realised just how bad he was at choosing the right decisions. This was not the way he wanted to die, not at all.
“No, Malfoy were just leaving.” Potter said as he looked at the documents Granger was holding.
Saying it out loud didn’t sound as bad as he had imagined. He liked Harry a lot, more so than anyone else in his life. Draco hadn’t had many real friends around him, but he knew he was feeling differently towards Harry than he did to his friends.
He had been cutting the chocolate, and as Harry moved over to his side, he gently put a hand on his lower back as he was about to instruct him. This had made Draco jump and drop the knife.
Harry never seemed bothered by it and would tell him he was always welcomed to stay.
“It’s just… I’ve never even considered the idea before, and now I’m suddenly unable to think about anything else than that” Harry sighed. “I don’t want to lose him, that I know for certain, but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do any of the physical stuff, you know…” Harry felt a bit awkward at discussing such a topic with his friend, but he knew he needed some advice on all of this, and Hermione was always the best one to consult.
“And you are sure of this? I mean, I love my flat and it’s convenient for me, but it wouldn’t stop me from moving here if you want to. This is far bigger than what I have to offer.” He said with a worried look on his face as they stood in the living room of his flat having managed to get all of the moving boxes inside before the rain started pouring, splashing against the windows.
Draco gave her a smile back and a nod before following her inside the flat.
“Well, I’m not really, I just…” Draco trailed off, wondering to himself why he took it so seriously all of a sudden. Perhaps it had more to do with the calmness and joy he felt now that he could sit here and relax while having a normal conversation with someone that didn’t have to involve Death Eaters, the war or being on the run from countless dangers.
“You think so?” Draco looked at Amelia and she gave him a reassuring pat on the shoulder before getting up to leave.
afterthought.
3.	His eyes are emerald green and sure they are pretty, but… oh well…
“The nerve!” Draco said, as he smacked Potter over the head, regretting it a second later as he realised it was his own body that he was putting through the rough treatment. However, it had done the trick.
The weekends were a bit more… eventful… if you could call it that.
They continued on chatting for a while, which Draco found calming, as the place had been packed with a lot of people he didn’t know.
“Fuck, you’re big.” Draco murmured as he stroked slowly up and down. Harry had leaned back and closed his eyes as he arched up to the touch.
“I can imagine… I didn’t have time to stop by during the week, but as I passed by it did look awfully cramped with all the people”
Both Draco and Potter nodded, glad to move on from the previous topic at hand for the time being.
just a misunderstanding, are you?” Granger leaned over her desk as she propped her head on her hands.
“What?!”
“Are you okay?” Draco felt himself tense for a second, he hadn’t noticed Potter scrutinizing him, and now it was too late. Potter was standing close enough to see the worn-out look on his face, which Pansy had been nagging him about for days now.
“I’m glad you could come…” Harry said with a voice filled with emotions Draco didn’t fully understand.
“That’s bloody awesome! Now Hermione doesn’t have to know it even happened!”
“Sure.”
“You were putting me on the spot so badly, I thought I would die from embarrassment, you know.” Draco chuckled.
“I figured it would wake you right up, hearing something like that.” Potter had a cheeky grin on his face that was irritatingly charming to Draco.
“Expecto Patronum!”
“It’s charming that you think you’ve got a chance at hitting me.” Potter seemed to pay no attention to the taunting and was just keeping a relaxed posture as he watched Draco.
“They broke up before the war. It was just too much going on I suppose.”
They both packed out their things in silence. It was an understatement to say it was awkward between them. Draco tried to pay it no attention and got his things sorted before heading down to the common room where Blaise and Pansy were waiting for him.
“What?” Now it was Potter who spoke up. “I didn’t act like a weirdo.” He tried to defend himself.
“Actually, it went rather well.” Draco said, feeling pride swell in his chest as he continued. “I managed to conjure a Patronus if you must know.” He tried sounding nonchalant.
“Welcome!” Draco saw a pretty dark-haired girl smile at him as he entered the bakery. There were a few customers scattered around, all looking content as they were eating, chatting or reading books. It gave off a peaceful atmosphere Draco thought.
However, although begrudgingly, Draco couldn’t get himself to throw the most advanced hexes. His energy level was just too low, and he could feel that his magic was weaker than usual.
Draco sighed as he looked away from the microscope.
“Listen, I’m sorry if you didn’t like me talking to Ron about everything, but he kinda had to understand the whole picture in order to get a better understanding of you as well. If you just give him a change, you’ll see that he’s a good guy. Hermione too, the two of you would probably find that you have much more in common than you might think.” The conversation became more serious with Potter’s words and honesty.
Draco had been right regarding both Hermione and Ron, they were both lively people who Draco felt was easy to get along with. Hermione was incredible smart and talking to her was a lot of fun since she shared many of the same interests with Draco.
Slowly, Harry pushed into Draco’s tight hole, stretching him to his limits. He felt both his and Harry’s breathing become shallow, trying to overcome the overwhelming sensations.
Surely it was a strange mix of people gathered together at the Gryffindor table, but Draco paid it no mind. He felt, for once, like things were about to change for the better.
However, Potter didn’t seem to let that stop him, as his left hand ran down Draco’s waist before sliding behind him and grabbing his ass firmly, squeezing it. The motion made Draco whimper as he felt his hips buck up and seconds later he was rubbing against Harry in a steady pace while still kissing him like there was no tomorrow.
“That I didn’t kiss you?”
“That’s quite the compliment” The guy grinned “Thank you! I was considering making it a regular, but it’s always nice to get some feedback on it before doing so”.
They had found a cosy little corner in the pub which gave them a bit of privacy as Draco had made ‘not being spotted easily’ a requirement for him joining her outside.
The moment suddenly felt too tender, and Draco was having trouble knowing what to say. It somehow felt like Granger was sharing too much intimate information with him, despite them not having talked like this ever before.
“Of course you’re not my responsibility. That’s why I simply changed the wards but didn’t go out looking for you. Now I’m quite regretting that decision, as we probably could’ve stumbled upon those remaining Death Eaters that way.”
With his other hand he grabbed Draco’s hair and pressed them both closer together as he slipped his tongue in.
Two and a half week had gone by with only one visit from Hermione where she told them she got caught up in a big case at work and would have to postpone working on the potion for a little while.
“If you’re helping her, then please let me in on it too.” Blaise said as he scurried closer to the other two.
“Oh… well, it’s not important. I just thought of buying some pastries on my way home” Draco felt a bit of heat rise to his cheeks as he thought he had been subtle.
“Sorry about that.” Draco wished he knew about Granger needing it earlier so that he could’ve spent some sleepless nights trying to change the taste to something better, like he had done for Potter.
“Would they now.” Harry chuckled.
“Okay, both of you!” Granger interrupted once again. “Arguing isn’t going to solve anything. I need to check this out more and I’ll search the library to see if I can find a way to get you two back to where you belong.”
Harry continued kissing Draco’s neck and collarbone. His hands were roaming over Draco’s body, making him feel hot all over.
“I’m sorry.” Harry looked him in the eyes, obviously going for some sort of puppy-eyes. “Don’t try to act cute, Potter.” Draco scoffed, unable to withstand using his last name. That was certainly a habit he had to get out of.
Potter was standing right in front of him as he looked down. “Care to tell me why?”
It felt hot, sending a shiver down Draco’s back. He felt Potter explore his mouth, their tongues intertwining.
Draco was trying to avoid showing too much of his neediness and would only occasionally come up with excuses as to why it would be better for him to just stay the night at Harry’s place.
Harry threw his head back and laughed loudly before leaning forwards again and kissing Draco hard on the lips. It merged into a gentler, soft kiss before Harry pulled away slightly. He put his forehead to Draco’s, close enough that Draco could feel his breath on his lips.
“You like it.”
Draco slowly turned the device under the microscope as he inspected the damage. He hated it when he had to do repairs on the smaller devices as it was such a pain to locate it all.
“Look, I’m not an idiot, I can see that you’re not overly happy to see me, but I definitely need this potion today, so please. If you could do it now, I’d be extremely grateful.” It was strange, really, to hear Potter speak in such a composed and, frankly, polite way to him. Perhaps Potter had grown up a bit throughout the last couple of years.
This time the previously shocked expression was replaced by a look of embarrassment as Granger saw who was standing in her doorway.
“By Merlin’s beard, I would Potter. But I can’t fucking seem to get away from you.” Draco drawled back.
Wow, Draco thought. She really was just blatantly outing him for no reason. Great, now Potter knew about something so embarrassing as him not being able to cast a Patronus.
The breakfast placed in front of him was on a whole other level. Having both a delicious sandwich as well as yoghurt and fruit mixed together was definitely a better option.
“What?” Harry asked, amused at Draco’s reaction. “Tell me, now that you’ve seen mine, would you mind disclosing what memory you were thinking of when conjuring yours?”
At that Rosie looked impressed and her interest was caught as far as Draco could tell.
“How about being a bit more careful next time? There’s a limit to how foolhardy one can be, even for you, Potter.” Draco stood up and rounded the desk to grab some of his tools.
“It’s… well, if you don’t like it then…” Draco mumbled, feeling vulnerable for being the only one to express feelings towards the other, regardless of having been too caught up in the moment to let it slip out of him.
“You bet!” Amelia grinned back at him.
“FIVE, FOUR, THREE”
“Huh?”
“Yeah, surely. But don’t you guys think it’s weird. He doesn’t even bother us at all, and when we pass by him and his friends, I could’ve sworn he smiles at us and I mean smile not smirking or leering.” Weasley seemed laughably upset about it, and Draco cursed himself for not having thought of this as a way to mess with Weasley back in the days. He apparently goes mental when he thinks Draco is being nice to him.
“Oh…Wait…You’re not? I was certain! I mean, you’ve never even treated your girlfriends the way you treat him! I thought you had finally found the one” Hermione looked shocked as she had now turned her full attention to Harry instead.
Potter just looked gobsmacked as he stumbled out of bed and slumped down on the couch, trying to process what had just happened.
Harry couldn’t blame him though. What had happened at the party had been a complete catastrophe.
“Yeah, I guess he would be considered the pretty type” Harry said back.
Draco stood there stunned for a second. He first thought Pansy was playing a cruel joke at him, saying he and Potter had been roomed together. But the concern that was plastered on her face made it highly unlikely for it to be a prank.
It wasn’t that he disliked Potter or anything, but he felt embarrassment. He had let his feelings take over the other day and had been completely honest with Potter there he stood shouting at him. Potter had been calm throughout it all and hugged him until he fell asleep. That definitely made him a decent guy, but Draco couldn’t help it.
Just then Professor Shrew appeared out of thin air, seemingly unaware of the situation. He gestured for everyone to head inside and ready their cauldrons.
“I was surprised indeed, but I can’t deny how important a creation you’ve made has been for me. Since I don’t know you personally, I can’t say much about my own thoughts, but knowing Hermione trusts you enough to call you her friend, I suppose a lot of things must have changed since the war.” She reached out her hand, and Draco looked at it for a moment, before taking it. “The world is a better place now, and if Hermione is willing to turn a new leaf, so am I.” She shook his hand and chuckled lightly. “No need to look so shocked. I will definitely come back here again when I need potions of any sort. Good day, Malfoy!”
“That’s true. Be careful on your way back, it’s still icy outside” Harry said before embraing Draco in a warm hug.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco felt a surge of magic rush through him and without thinking the words left his mouth.
“What is it?” Granger looked more than curious as she studied him.
“I…We’re not! That’s not!” Once again, Harry found himself at a loss for words when it came to his relationship with Draco.
“I would normally be offended for not knowing about it, but I can’t help being grateful for it right now.” Draco huffed out, his lips quirking upwards.
Draco leaned back and gasped loudly as he felt Harry engulf him completely without warning. Draco felt his hips push upwards, desperate for more contact. Harry’s mouth was warm and wet, causing Draco to cry out as he felt the overwhelming pleasure. He tangled his fingers into Harry’s messy black hair, and continued to push his hips up, while Harry hummed around him, sending tremors up his body. He could feel his cock start to build up as he was nearing the edge. He mustered up the last he had of strength as he pulled on Harry’s hair, whimpering at the loss of contact.
“What could that possibly be?” Draco gave a humourless laugh.
“Well, to be honest he’s quite alright I think.”
Harry just looked at him, saying nothing allowing him to speak his mind.
“I’m thrilled.” There was definite sarcasm dripping from his words as he kept his eyes focused on the uneaten soup.
“I thought I heard someone outside. What are you doing here?” the guy asked him.
“Most don’t, but some absolutely do. Apparently, they are grateful for what I did, but it also made them fully aware of the fact that I have quite a bit of magical power.”
“I’m just going to use your legs for now, so try keeping them close together” He said as he positioned himself properly behind Draco.
“I’m… I’m coming.” Harry breathed shallowly into his ear. “Me… too…” Draco barely managed to whisper.
“You tried making it taste like treacle tart?”
The house had felt eerily quiet since Granger made her departure.
“Tone it down, Malfoy.” Draco stilled as he heard Potter’s voice. “It’s all just fun and games, no need to argue about it.”
Draco stared for a while at the beautiful girl in front of him. She had long dark brown hair and shared the same emerald green eyes as her brother. So then why? Why didn’t Draco feel any attraction? She would be the type he would instantly fall for usually, but somehow; he didn’t feel anything romantic.
“Just like at St. Mungo’s.”
“You were stealing ingredients and making a potion in secret. Anyone would be worried about what you might be putting together!” Potter huffed.
He looked back to see Potter groaning as he had taken a direct hit. Draco staggered back on his feet trying to deflect the curses, but he was a split second too late. He felt another curse hit him straight on, and he fell back down once again.
The door jingled and Draco had to tear himself away from the packaging station and over to the counter to tend to the customer who had just entered. Pansy was working at Bewitched Dresses that day, so it had been more than a little bit hectic.
“Of course not! I- why would… I-… That’s not! I don’t!...”
“Expectations from whom?” Draco scoffed, butting in on the conversation Potter and Pansy was having over at the small table, while he was sat in front of the potion table, cutting the ingredients.
A little while passed, and just as Potter seemed to focus his attention back at the report, Draco frowned as he eyed the fireplace. “Shouldn’t Granger have found something by now?”
Draco didn’t know what was happening, he felt his cheeks flush red and he got weirdly embarrassed.
“Wait, don’t-“
Normally, Draco was good at keeping his emotions in check, never letting himself turn into some stuttering fool, but the sudden turn of the conversation was something he was far too unprepared for. “I… I don’t! What!? Have you lost it?!”
Draco tried following the conversation, but it was difficult to focus when Harry had decided to sit much closer to him than normal.
Draco focused his attention to the chess board, trying to force the heat from rising to his cheeks. There was no way Weasley of all people would pick up on any feelings he may harbour towards Potter, he reassured himself. This was just him trying to be polite and accept Potter’s decision to let Draco even a tiny bit into his life.
“So… How do you both feel?”
A few seconds passed before Potter opened the door slowly. “Why ask when you do whatever you want anyway?” Draco huffed, not meeting Potter’s eyes.
Harry sighed as he carefully turned Draco over and put him down on the bed, trying to avoid the mix of cum.
After the potion was done brewing, Draco did the final steps in order to complete it. Adding Valerian Sprigs and stirring it 7 times clockwise before waving his wand and pouring it into the sleek vials he had put forth.
“Just take your time, I’ll be working on the pie in the meantime” The guy said as he laid down the clothes on the drawer next to the shower.
“Oh, leave me be. I’m already fearing Hermione’s wrath if she sees this.”
“Anyway, I did check it out, but since the vial had no label on it, I had no idea what you were planning. I opened it and sniffed it to see if it was something I already knew what was. When I couldn’t determine what it was, I put it back. I was thinking of either confronting you about it the following day or ask Hermione if she knew what it might be.” Potter said as a matter of fact, making it seem like he had all the right in the world to look through someone else’s stuff.
“Oi Malfoy! You better not start imagining Harry is yours now just cus you’re stuck to him. It’s gonna be a major let down the moment he’s free from you and you can’t depend on the saviour protecting you anymore.” Weasley jeered, evidently unaware of the current situation between Potter and Draco.
“Sorry, it’s a bit messy. I got caught up in some new recipes just now, so I’ve been thinking out how to do them” Harry said, as Draco noticed the dining table being filled with papers spread out across it.
Any comments or kudos are much appreciated!
“Wait! You actually are together??” Ginny looked panicked and her eyes was shifting between him and Potter, taking in the fact that she probably already knew Draco was wearing Potter’s clothes, and how close they were standing to one another. “They do make a fine couple, if you ask me.” Luna gave a small smile at them in support of their supposed relationship.
Visiting the Weasley family had become a custom that even Draco had more or less become used to. He quite enjoyed the homemade meals that Molly Weasley made and the very comfy sweater with a ‘D’ on the front that he had received from Mrs. Weasley as a Christmas gift.
“What can I say, I’m very talented.” The tiredness he felt, made the sarcasm slightly less apparent in his words.
“Here” Harry turned to Draco with a neatly wrapped present in his hands.
“Yeah, I added homemade gingerbread on the bottom of it. I thought it would be perfect for the holiday season” Harry grinned.
“Yeah.” Harry whispered back, leaning back down onto his pillow.
“If you don’t mind…” Draco felt relieved. He had slept in Harry’s bed before, and he slept better there than anywhere else.
“Yeah!” Draco stated, happy that someone understood. “It makes other people self-conscious. I know I’m fairly attractive, but then you come along, and I start wondering if I’m even attractive at all! We’re so different, so if you’re that bloody hot, then doesn’t that mean I’m not? It’s outrageous!” Draco huffed out in annoyance.
“You don’t have to feel so bad about it, Draco. It wasn’t your fault.” The small smile on Luna’s face made it clear that she knew what Draco was trying to say.
“Everything needs to have a counterpart, even if we can’t find the exact correct formula for this, something close enough might be able to do the trick.” Draco muttered back, aware that if Hermione was uncertain about finding a cure, it might very well be close to impossible.
Harry knew that Hermione was right. He wouldn’t be able to keep the friendship if he didn’t agree to a relationship. He just wasn’t sure he would be able to love Draco and hurting him because of his own selfishness of not wanting to let him go was a gloomy thought.
“You’re so good Draco. So tight.” Draco gasped at the naughty whisper in his ear.
“Sounds like getting burned is a frequent issue of yours, Weasley?” Draco raised a brow.
“That’s true…” Harry murmured as he watched the players beneath them.
“What…?”
“Do you mind turning around?” Harry said, as he had removed his trousers and boxers all together and was coating his cock with lube. Draco noted the size of it. It was thick and long.
Harry wasn’t far behind as the sudden tightness of Draco’s hole made him groan loudly and with one last thrust Draco felt himself become filled up with hot, wet semen.
“Maybe someone cast a spell on us?” Potter was pacing back and forth in their room. They had both decided to miss breakfast after Draco said he would rather die than have to try and act nice towards that Weasel of all people.
Somehow, the nightmares had already greatly subsided just from having Harry by his side. Waking up in the middle of the night and seeing Harry Potter sleeping next to him had made it easier to calm down. The feeling of warmth and protection was something he hadn’t realised he sorely needed.
“Then if you’re able to give it a chance, why not? Don’t give him any big expectations and just make a go for it. You already seem to know that he won’t stay as friends, so if you want to keep him around, then this might be your only option”.
“Not at all… But you get used to it, I suppose.”
“I suppose that won’t be an issue. It’ll take about an hour and a half though.” Draco turned and walked into the brewing room, knowing Potter would follow like he usually did. However, still not feeling overly excited about the idea of having a Weasley enter his sacred space.
He turned on the water and couldn’t help but feel relaxed as he felt the hot water on his body. He hadn’t even realised just how cold he had been. It would’ve probably made him sick if he hadn’t taken a shower at this point, he thought.
Draco felt himself having trouble sitting still as Professor Shrew was pacing back and forth not stopping his ranting about potion history until Granger reached her hand in the air asking about the potion they were going to brew. For once Granger hadn’t been a total bother as she had stopped the frantic rant of the professor, allowing for the lecture to continue on to the practical part.
“Potter. He’s an Auror, you say?” Draco knew he shouldn’t be starting this conversation again, as he had been the one trying to avoid it, but his interest for the topic got the better of him.
“Ron is pretty bummed out by it. He was looking forward to having Harry be part of the family.” She added with a faint smile.
It was silence around him, he was finally unable to escape the thoughts he had to properly process at some point.
Pansy outright ignored Draco, never letting her focus leave Potter as she smiled her most charming smile. “Thank you, I take that as a compliment. No way this sophisticated place could have grumpy over there be the face of the shop.”
Draco took that as a clue and stood up, straightening his shirt and tie that had become crooked with the sudden rash movements. He moved over to the door where Granger and Potter was still standing. He gives a polite nod towards Granger. “Malfoy.” She mutters back with a short nod and avoiding any eye contact.
“You were so cute, clinging to me like a little koala.” Harry laughed.
Draco turned and scanned the shelf of ingredients behind him before picking a few and placing them on the counter. “You’ll also need some mistletoe berries.”
“Now let me see that burn.” Draco said, getting up and with a flick of his wand, vanishing the paste.
“He’s one of my best friends! You should’ve just dealt with it properly. Don’t go around making me look bad, just because you can!” Potter grabbed his collar, and Draco felt like he was in a surreal situation at this point. He knew it was Potter before him, but it was his own face that was firing a deadly glare towards him. ‘How odd…’ He thought.
“Not telling me only resulted in exactly that! I would’ve at least had the time to steel myself if you had given me a warning beforehand.” Draco said in an exasperated voice.
Potter just laughed and gave Draco a kiss on the forehead before getting up.
“Right answer. Cus that one could’ve been a deal breaker, you know.” Harry said teasingly, laughing at the wide eyes on Draco.
He had won. The applause could be heard as Slytherin was going wild. Having lost to both Gryffindor and then Hufflepuff had been difficult. Getting a win like this would boost the whole team’s spirit to the max.
“I wasn’t bad at it. There were just some things…” Draco muttered, before Pansy took over.
The next couple of weeks, Draco spent a lot of time at the bakery. He felt like he was getting closer to Harry each day, and the guy was so easy to talk to. It was become a habit at this point that Draco would do some taste testing for Harry’s new recipes. He really had no idea why his opinions would be useful, but Harry had insisted that it helped him in choosing which pastry to put on the menu.
“I’m already so used to having you around, I’m not sure I would’ve managed if I were to come home one day and you weren’t here.”
Granger seemed to let it slide though, as she nodded and muttered something about incessant late-night studies potentially being too much for him.
“Yep.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He literally came flying at me while I was in the bath. I still haven’t managed to get a proper explanation though.” Draco felt himself move with the shrug of Potter’s shoulders.
Draco stepped back desperately trying to maintain a decent distance from the half-naked man, but he couldn’t help it when his eyes darted down to the muscled chest in front of him. Having him up close made it even easier to trace the fine muscles. It was a surprise to Draco as he hadn’t realised just how buff Potter had become after the war. His eyes were once again caught by green ones as he felt his back hit the sturdiness of a stone wall.
“Thank you…” Draco muttered as he took a bite of the pie as well.
“Hi” Draco said back, looking around. It was pretty quiet today with only a few customers scattered around.
“Fuck!” Draco moaned as he started pushing back into Harry’s movements.
Harry started smearing the lube around Draco’s hole. He circled his finger a few times before he gently pressed against his entrance.
They could hear snippets here and there of Ron and Harry discussing quidditch and Auror work passionately from the kitchen and the low murmuring that seeped through into the living room was soothing to listen to.
Potter sounded apologetic as he hesitantly walked into the room and sat down on the couch beside Draco. It felt like such a relief as the pain ebbed away and Draco felt like he could finally breath properly, however he kept his gaze firmly directed at the flames dancing in the fireplace before them. “The pain was getting pretty out of hand, despite the potion.”
“There’s no time to act innocent, I know what you’re up to.” Potter’s hold on him was still impossible to shake off, and Draco felt unwell. He knew the consequences it would have to be found out, especially if it was an Auror that found out about it. This could be the end of him.
Harry pulled away ever so slightly to look at Draco. He gave him a lopsided grin as he added.
“No, she’s at Bewitched Dresses today. There was an emergency, so she had to leave here early.”
Draco sat there for a while contemplating what he should do about the situation.
“Is that not your name?” Harry said with amusement as he walked over and hoisted Draco up, somehow having become used to him clinging to his chest, and therefore carrying him like that instead of on his back.
Instead it looked like everyone was just happy that they were back to being able to hang as a group and not having the tension between the two lovebirds hanging over them.
After a little while, Amelia’s boyfriend named Sebastian also showed up, apologizing for being late because of his shift at the hospital.
Sorry for taking some time before posting another chapter. Work is tiring and taking up a lot of my time.
Turning around again he almost fell as he jumped back from the towering Death Eater who had sneaked up on him. Just as he took in the look of sneering hatred on the man’s face, he noticed more hooded people emerging from the shadows.
“I won!” Draco was dragged out of his thoughts as Weasley was sat smiling broadly, the victory having brought up his mood considerably.
Potter just laughed as he gazed out over the big green field. “I can assure you I’m taking this seriously.”
“Of course it does! We’ll be in this together no matter what!” Pansy cheered gleefully.
“He tells his stories in a wildly different view.” Draco laughed a bit as well, remembering how proud Weasley had looked as he told the story himself.
“Yes”
Draco knew he had messed up as he lifted his gaze back up to Potter’s eyes and realised that Potter had seen his gaze linger at his lips.
“Yeah, you better not!”
“How many vials?” Draco grabbed lavender and valerian sprigs before heading into one of the storages and getting the rest of the ingredients. He neatly put them down and started working on the potion.
Draco jumped a bit as he heard the familiar voice.
‘Great!’ Draco thought to himself. Leave it to the boy wonder to instantly figure out a situation despite being thrown off his game by whatever the hell was happening. Well, chalk it up to his Head Auror position, Draco sighed. Yes, he might have stumbled upon the prophecy once or twice and it had been hard not to notice the glaring headlines ‘New Head Auror – Our very own saviour!’ and the picture of a grinning Harry Potter shaking hands with the Minister of Magic who was none other than Hermione Granger herself. That hadn’t particularly surprised Draco. Begrudgingly he had to admit that there probably did not currently exist any other witch or wizard capable of competing with the brightness of Granger’s mind.
“What?” Draco looked stunned at the last sentence. What the hell did she mean by that?
“Yeah, that’s it”.
“Well, that definitely takes a twist on the whole conversation about touching, I suppose.” Potter seemed to find it appropriate to try and ease the situation by the use of humour.
Draco halted his movements slightly, before waving his wand at the concoction, leaving it to brew for a while. He finally looked up to meet Potter’s gaze, which was still firmly on him like it had been from the start, however the mocking expression Draco had expected to see was nowhere to be found. Instead he just looked, quite honestly, fascinated.
This was definitely new to Draco and he was trying his best to keep up with Harry’s pace. It felt a bit reassuring that Harry seemed rather confident at what he was doing. Draco also noted that Harry was still as hard as ever, which was the biggest reassurance of all.
“You okay?” Harry asked as he kept his pace steady.
“I’m sorry, mate.” Draco felt like he had finally reached a new low as he was pretending to be friends with a Weasley. “I’m just stressed from all the homework, makes me a bit on edge.”
At the end of his ramblings, Draco had to take a moment to pause and take a deep breath. This was in no way helping him hide his feelings for Potter, and to Draco’s horror, Granger seemed to have lost none of her intelligence and ability to know exactly what was going on.
“Like what?”
“Er… Does it matter what it’s about? I made it happen, didn’t I?” Draco felt exasperation seep through his words as he couldn’t understand why Pansy was acting like she did.
Without properly thinking and seeing the look of happiness on Potter’s face mimic his own, Draco felt a laugh escape him as he threw himself forward and hugged Potter tightly.
Draco blinked as he felt something sturdy beneath his hand. He opened his eyes fully to see Harry’s sleeping face beside him. The memories of the night before flooding back to him.
Pansy had just huffed loudly. “It’s fine. They just have a potion they need brewed quickly. Also, trust me, Draco, they won’t run away. More than anything, I’m concerned you’re the one who’ll run away. So please stand steadfast and greet them with a dazzling smile, alright, love?” Before Draco could say another word, Pansy ended the floo call with a heavy cough, mumbling about it being late and having to sleep.
Hey guys!
It was all too common for Draco to have people look at him differently the moment he told them about his job and status. Everyone seemed to cling on a bit too much once they knew and then they all tried to use the friendship for their own gains. Growing up with this kind of thing happening on a regular basis had made him wary when it came to friendships or relationships.
“I won’t go all the way since I’m assuming this is new for you as well. I think it’s enough to do this much, and then we can work on getting you used to it later” Harry said as he got out some lube stashed in the cupboard.
“So… Er…” The atmosphere was tense as they sat around the living room table after Potter had tried to awkwardly explain everything to Granger and Draco had just been quiet the whole time, arms crossed, avoiding eye contact as best as possible. “I’ll just tell you what I have so far.”
Draco quietly left the room, and on the way back as Pansy was chatting away about everything and nothing, Draco couldn’t help but be glad that it was Lovegood he was caught off guard by, and not one of Potter’s other friends.
He would reach out to put a strand of blonde hair behind the guy’s ear, and before he could retract his hand, he felt a quick shiver from Draco.
“I love you.”
Draco couldn’t help but wonder who those ‘people’ were that had had the chance to touch Potter’s hair before him. “I don’t mind though. I like your touch, you have nice hands”
“Hm?”
“If there’s something I can do to help you, then I won’t hesitate you know.” Harry said, as he leaned in and kissed him. “Also, I love you, so I might just allow you to take advantage of me whenever you like.” He gave Draco a lopsided grin.
“Well, now you could be either one of you.” Unexpectedly Granger was visibly finding this more amusing than she should.
“It’s fine, it always takes a while to get all the cleaning done anyway, so I don’t mind having some company while I work” the guy smiled, making Draco honestly believe what the guy was saying.
“Well…” He felt himself having difficulties with how to word it, as he truly didn’t want Granger and Potter of all people to know about the nightmares that had haunted him since you-know-who and the death-eaters took over the manor and made life a living hell for him.
Draco stood outside the Blue Ocean Bakery, clutching his umbrella. It had been a week since his first visit. He had been swamped with work all week, and it was finally time to once more sit down with a book and allow time to slow down a bit. Even with the heavy rain cascading down the windows of his office, Draco had decided to walk back home once again. He had been waiting for a day where he would be able to enjoy some peace without having to sit in the complete silence of his villa. The bakery had been such a place to him. Not too crowded, and not too deserted. It was a perfect mix of having people around him without it being overly noisy. The heavy rain was also making the bakery seem even more inviting.
The day had been extremely hectic. It seemed like everyone wanted to buy some chocolate in the nick of time. Although there had been quite a few customers throughout the week, there were still a bunch of people who came in on Valentine’s day.
There was a moment of silence as they both sat there, a hint of awkwardness filling the air around them until Draco furrowed his brows.
They kept on working in a comfortable silence, both silently agreeing to a truce for the time being.
“Thank you, Malfoy. You saved me there.”
“I can’t believe it. I guess it’s true that I don’t particularly like this situation. But I’m obviously more hurt over not knowing anything about it!”
New beginnings…
However, he quickly realised that it wasn’t as easy as it seemed. People were constantly crowding around him, allowing him little space to think. It was like everyone just wanted to be seen together with the great saviour, but no one truly respected his privacy or was cautious with their words around him.
Thanks for reading. Any comments or kudos are much appreciated :)
Draco noted just how strong Potter had become over the last couple of years. He was no longer the weak and lanky student that Draco had taunted throughout their school years.
He felt his breath being knocked out of him as he was slammed against the stone wall. It took him a moment to realise what was happening, as he looked into fierce green eyes.
Harry kissed back more intense this time, making Draco feel light-headed. He felt Harry’s hands sweep down his chest and slip under his shirt. His fingers trailed up his stomach, making Draco shiver. Harry pulled the shirt over his head, Draco shuddered at the way he was looking at him. He could feel his own arousal as he wanted to explore Harry as well. Sure, he had seen his body before when he was switched with him, but to be seeing it from this perspective…That was something completely different. He tugged on the shirt, and Harry seemed to get the gist of it as he pulled it off, revealing the toned body that had been hidden beneath the clothing. Draco felt his own hands reach out and start to explore the defined chest and broad shoulders.
“Hi…” Draco couldn’t help but feel a bit uneasy. Him and Harry had only just agreed on trying for a relationship the day before, and not having seen Harry for a few weeks were only adding to the awkwardness Draco was feeling.
“Nope! Your drink and pastry combining skills is making sales go up, so I won’t let you pay for doing a great job”.
“It’s not like we did anything on purpose. And honestly we figured it would be for the best if no one knew about it.”
“I never noticed you being bad at charms or DADA…” Potter said thoughtfully. Again, Draco did not dare to look at the guy, as he knew his cheeks were starting to get red.
“What?”
“Auror Potter needed the potion at that time, who am I to deny him of it when we had the opportunity to be of assistance.” Pansy slid of the table lightly before circling around him. She looked like she was hunting a prey with her slow, calculated steps. “And I knew you would run and hide or make up some excuse if I told you who it was. Not a risk I was willing to take with such an important customer.”
“Hello again. Same procedure as always, I suppose.” He said looking a bit bashful as he rubbed his neck.
“Yet even I have noticed changes in the wizarding world that has been extremely beneficial to those who used to have close to no rights. Perhaps Weasley isn’t far off in his assumptions.” Draco said, remembering how he had read a few papers about new laws that had been implemented after Granger took over the position.
“Right?” Harry said and grinned.
“You’re way too optimistic.” Draco felt himself tug at his sleeve a bit, feeling an uncomfortable worry of never being able to cast a Patronus creep over him. He had been a death eater after all, so there was no telling if he could actually make it happen.
They started making the chocolate, and Draco was dutifully following all of Harry’s instructions.
“Was it up to your expectations?”
“Wake up, Malfoy.” Draco groaned as he felt someone shake his shoulder. “I must say you’ve lost quite a bit of handsomeness during the night.”
“Good, good.” Shrew said as he examined Draco’s work as well. Draco didn’t care to feel offended at the lack of interest from his professor. He had felt the look of displeasure from the first lecture when his name was mentioned. It wasn’t something he could run from.
He took in his whole length before slowly letting his lips drag upwards, letting go of his cock with a loud pop. Before Draco could protest at the lack of contact, Harry was back on him. This time he let his tongue work, sliding up and down the back of his cock, while his thumb rubbed at the slit.
“Then tell me. I don’t want us to stop talking now that everyone gets along with each other.” Potter made no indication of moving his hand or allowing for more space between them.
“Hey! Where are you going?” Amelia said as she bumped into Draco who was starting to feel sick.
He felt Potter’s eyes regard him for a second, it made Draco shift slightly as he felt uncomfortable under the scrutinized gaze. It was just typical that even when supposedly being in charge of the situation, Potter still held such a powerful aura around him that it did not feel like he was.
It wasn’t anything new after all.
“Hey sweety!”
“I want to give it a try”
“How bold.” Harry chuckled, amused.
Harry got the fire going before heading to the kitchen. Draco was still fumbling a bit, and Harry noticed that he had probably spent a lot of time mustering up the courage to do this.
“Quite the demanding type, huh. Were you thinking I’d just obey you like a dog?” He smiled lasciviously, as he looked far too confident in his current predicament.
Draco barely registered Potter drying his hands on the towel behind him as his brain had now decided to start the shutdown process by itself.
“That was…Incredible.” Harry sighed.
“Nothing to be worried about.” Draco felt like Harry had read his body language far too well. “Well, we did steer the conversation towards you a bit. It’s basically the link between her and I to begin with, so yeah. Just random stuff. She told me a bit about you as a child and how you used to be quite a mama’s boy.” Harry chuckled.
“Your hair, your body, everything about you. Why…?” Draco started mumbling. “I just don’t understand why you’re so damn handsome. It should be limits, you know!”
Harry stood there for a moment, looking a bit surprised. He had felt like Draco was trying to keep him at a distance for a while now, and suddenly here he was, on valentine’s day, talking about making chocolate together.
Ron wasn’t as interested in the highly intellectual discussions, but he was easy to get along with and he had a good sense of humour.
“Oh, I was talking to Parkinson? I had no idea; the letter only showed the shops signature. Parkinson owns this place?” Potter looked around as he was talking, taking in the environment with interest.
Somehow, he had started to enjoy watching Potter cook. The man seemed fairly adept at it, and it was fascinating to see how well he handled everything relating to it.
Lately whenever he and Draco had been going out together, Draco had spent most of his energy on trying to keep them at a friendly distance.
“Potter.” Draco didn’t know if it was a question or just a statement as he whispered his name.
“Especially if your opponent has too much pride.” Potter reached out his hand, but Draco only scowled at it before getting back on his feet, brushing off the non-existing dirt on his cloak. He dismissed the notion of dizziness that was now present.
Amelia gave Draco a big hug, thanking him excessively. Draco had expected some joy over it, but this showed just how much she loved the show. He was glad that the endless conversations about it finally paid off.
“You’re not even the slightest worried about what your dear brother will think of it? Even if you’re just joking around? If he heard you now I’m certain you’d be on the receiving end of a depressingly bad and most likely backfiring jinx by now.”
“Did you sniff it as well?” She inquired as she turned the vial around in her hand inspecting it.
Harry zoned out as his thoughts were filled with a certain blonde.
“You know about the that?” Potter’s face shot up to look at him, and Draco felt a small thrill at finally having piqued his interest.
The room fell silent for a moment, the only sound coming from the crackling of the fireplace as it continued its dance of red, yellow and orange.
Draco could feel himself burning up from embarrassment. He felt so vulnerable and exposed. Yet, strangely, in all the passion and embarrassment there was a soothing sense of security as well. He felt safe being at the mercy of Harry.
“You really didn’t have to” Draco said, feeling relieved at this point for having decided to give a present to Amelia as well. He hadn’t told her, because he thought she would most likely tell him it was fine and he didn’t have to, but he had the perfect gift so he couldn’t help it.
“Considering the… watchful… eye you’re keeping on me, I just can’t help but to wonder if you want anything? You know, eye drops or something.” Draco muttered the last part, unable to restrain himself from throwing in some remarks as the staring had gotten on his nerves.
“What?!” Draco jerked up looking down at Harry with wide, blinking eyes. “You’ve exchanged letters with my mother?”
Although it was just on the other side of the road, he took on the way home, Draco had never really stopped to look at it before. Same as the other stores a bit further ahead, this small bakery was warm and welcoming as it was standing there glittering in the sun.
It wasn’t something to take lightly. Hurting Draco wasn’t something he wanted.
“Not if you plan it well. And even if it is dangerous, it’s the best way to get them all. They obviously all want Draco dead, so it’s more likely that they’ll go together to attack him. I think it’s the best option, and with Harry around, he’ll protect Draco. It’s, of course, up to Draco to decide if he wants to do that though.” Draco didn’t know if it was because of Luna’s exceptionally airy voice, but somehow he felt compelled by her idea.
All Draco could think was that Harry looked especially attractive when he was showing off his determination and confidence.
He felt the rush of wind as Potter came to a halt right beside him, their knees touching as Draco’s eyes widen. For a second everything stood still. Potter’s face was inches from his own, and without a word Potter’s hand grasped the air besides Draco’s head in a mere second.
He leaned his head back further, wanting to give more space for Harry to explore. Harry trailed down his chest and stomach, licking and kissing him, sending shivers down his spine with every touch.
“I wasn’t hiding!” Draco snapped back, hating himself for not having been able to stand tall and composed when Potter had entered the shop. “I was simply caught up in looking for some ingredients.” He felt himself cringe at his own lie, and the awkwardness of it all.
“Say, your words were a bit difficult to catch, but right before you… did you?” Harry looked at him, stroking circles on his arm. It was a soothing and calming feeling and it was difficult not to be honest in such a situation.
“Alright then. I will say your names and appoint you a number. This will be your room for the entirety of the year, and you will not have the opportunity to change rooms. Is that clear?” McGonagall looked around the room as a few people nodded here and there while others were grumbling. “Patil, number 5. Granger 7.” McGonagall started, and Draco felt a lump start to form in his throat at the thought of who he might end up sharing a room with.
“Yeah! I got a bit caught up in the book. I’ll go to bed now as well.” Draco said placing the book down on the table and putting his teacup into the sink.
“You just have to heat it up, but if you don’t feel like it you can eat it tomorrow instead. It’s good for another two days if put in the fridge”.
It was a message from Harry ‘Hi! Are you coming to the bakery today? I have a new recipe, but I would like your opinion on it’.
“Sorry, I’m just tired.” Draco said, trying to mimic Potter’s usually soft and calm tone. It proved more difficult than he had expected.
“Well, I did sleep for most of yesterday and managed to indulge in one too many espresso shots so yeah, I’ve got no understanding of time anymore. I might end up dead on the floor halfway through the day, who knows. Just enjoy my current mood of energy and happiness, alright!”
“You are insane! There’s no way I’ll be letting Potter teach me!” Draco felt the panic rush over him.
“Harry, Look! I found a location that might be linked to the case!” The door was slammed open and the tension broke as both turned to look at the intruder.
Draco felt his heartbeat quicken as his gaze fell to Harry’s lips and then back up again to his emerald eyes, shining with desire and something mischievous.
“It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them.” – Agatha Christie.
A moment of ear deafening silence ensued as both parties sat there looking at each other. Potter looking taken aback by the second time of Draco admitting to something he’d swore would never be said out loud. And Draco being just as taken aback by realising that he had said too much in his moment of anger.
“You do remember the animosity between us, do you not?” Draco furrowed his brows slightly, as he knew Lovegood had always been difficult to understand.
Once again, he allowed his eyes to close as he felt Potter’s lips on his neck once more, tracing down his collarbone. A shiver ran up his spine as he felt Potter’s hand trace his abdomen with such a light touch it was barely there.
“What?! You’ve told Blaise about it?”
“No, that’s not the issue here. I’m not lying to you.”
“You didn’t though. I’ve come to the conclusion myself; you know. I was pretty confused at first, but I didn’t dislike you, so I gave it a chance to see how I truly felt. And now I know” Harry smiled, as Draco buried his head in his chest, sobbing.
“What’s
“No need for sarcasm. Potter and I are getting along quite well, and I would hate to miss the opportunity to be around him whenever he visits the shop.” Pansy said before taking a long sip of her wine. “How did the lesson go today?”
Draco knew he had changed drastically since the war, and with the help of Harry and the others, he was no longer a Malfoy that would make his father proud. Deep down he felt a hint of satisfaction from the thought of it.
“Welcome new students at Hogwarts, and welcome back to all old students!” McGonagall’s welcome speech boomed over the great hall as she continued on to matters regarding the older years. “This year will include an added 8
“Of course! We could’ve both died!” It took Draco a second as he realised what Harry was talking about. “I don’t…” He felt his face heat up as Harry wasn’t letting his eyes fall from Draco’s. “I don’t regret everything, no.”
Draco gasped as he felt his erection being freed from his trousers. Harry pulled his trousers and underwear down and easily slipped it off completely, leaving Draco completely naked.
“You work pretty late these days…”
“Are you excited for the match today?” Draco was dragged out of his own thoughts by Pansy’s voice.
Once Potter had calmed down Weasley they re-joined Draco and Hermione. Ron seemed less angry in his accusations at that point, despite still mumbling to himself how crazy it all was.
“I like you too.” Harry said in a genuine voice. “I’ve said we should try it out, and when I make a decision, I go all in on it. Believe me.” He reached out and stroked Draco’s cheek gently, before turning even more serious.
After a bit more bickering and overlooking Potter’s futile attempts at not being ignored, they all, mysteriously, managed to get a comfortable conversation going.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s too unfair.” Draco breathed as he traced Harry’s defined muscles. “What is?” Harry said, earning himself a scoff from Draco at his obliviousness.
“Ask him to show you next time.” She grinned mischievously before refusing to answer more questions.
“Hold still.” Draco put the paste on Weasley’s arm and made sure to cover the whole burn in a thick paste.
“I love you”
“Ah… It’s okay. If what it takes is for me to challenge death, I’ll gladly do it if it means I can be with you. No problem whatsoever.” Draco said, a bit surprised at his own irony and how he was even able to speak properly after Harry’s words.
“Don’t try to twist it. I won fair and square. No one likes a sore loser, you know.”
“Why is that?” Draco frowned, slightly confused.
When Draco didn’t immediately answer, Granger continued. “You’re both able to understand each other on a whole different level considering your pasts, and you’ve both had times where you were obsessed with the other. What harm would it do to date?” Granger was far too unbothered by her own words at this point.
Draco got a bit startled as he saw Harry’s hand about to touch him, but before he could react properly, Harry’s hand reach for his hair and he pulled it back with half a leaf in his hand.
“You wanna play a round?”
“Do you have your wand?” Potter said as he got out his own. It was a strange feeling of habit as something inside of Draco twisted uncomfortably when seeing Potter draw his wand. Perhaps it was the numerous times they had spent hexing each other, or just the plain fact that Draco knew he would not stand a chance against Potter in a proper duel. But they were no longer fighting. No, this time around Potter had offered to teach Draco a spell just out of the goodness of his heart apparently. Draco would’ve never expected the day to come where they would act friendly towards one another and even help each other with potions and spells. How strange.
“…Home…?” Draco answered, unsure as to what was going on.
Ron looked sullen as he waited for the painful itch. After a few minutes had passed by his brows furrowed as he studied the skin around the paste. A perplexed look on his face, before he looked up slightly surprised.
Draco broke his attention away from his book once more and gazed at her. She looked fairly uncomfortable asking him the question, but it seemed like curiosity had gotten the better of her. “Better than expected.” Draco shifted a bit, glancing between Pansy and Blaise as he realised Blaise was now attentively watching him as well.
“I’m not even gonna argue with you on that. I’m too relived I can finally think without wanting to puke every second.” Granger sighed and sat back, relaxing into the couch before looking up at Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
As Draco climbed into bed, he reached out and opened the drawer containing the vial. With a quick glace in Potter’s direction making sure he was sleeping; Draco unscrewed the lid and gave it a good sniff.
“I thought so too. But this is just…” Draco sighed as he was now more or less glued to Harry.
“Harry is bi and that’s not something he’s been hiding. That’s why so many guys are after him too, knowing there might be a tiny chance he’ll fall for any of them. He’s also not someone who would base his love for someone on their past. If he likes you, he likes you. Simple as that!” Granger said, sipping her tea.
What a sly bastard, Draco thought.
“Bloody hell.” Weasley yawned and stretched as he got up. “Yeah, yeah… I’ll do it. Of course I will! You might actually get a good night’s sleep for once, so I’m glad to help make that happen.”
Draco gave a light chuckle, knowing full well how annoyingly miserable Ron had been for the past weeks now, mumbling on and on about not surviving a re-sit. “I’ll be there in a minute” Draco smiled, as he quickly went back to writing the last of the letter to his mother, while Harry went out to the common room levitating both his and Draco’s bags with him.
At that Harry withdrew his fingers slowly, earning himself a gasp. Draco whimpered at the loss of contact but waited patiently as Harry once again conjured more lubricant onto his hand. He coated his cock, and Draco couldn’t help but stare as he did.
“If… I’ll go if you come with me.” Draco knew he was being difficult, but honestly, he wasn’t sure he would be able to go through with it unless Harry stood by his side.
“I can’t believe I did that.” Draco was still in shock as he leaned back and looked at Potter, who was grinning at him. However, he was starting to feel the high of the adrenaline slowly seep out of him as he started to land again, and realisation dawned on him that he was still holding onto Potter.
Pansy looked over her shoulder, with a mischievous smirk and a raised eyebrow as she pointed to Draco.
“Good morning.”
Draco spent the rest of the day trying not to think about Potter and what Weasley had said.
She shrugged. “Well, when one of your best friends is the number one rule breaker in school it’s difficult not to be affected by it.” Maybe Granger wasn’t as bad as Draco had always assumed.
Potter proceeded to lean in further as he turned the tap on, his chest leaning into Draco’s. Draco’s hands flew up on their own accord, gripping onto Potter’s shoulders for a split second before he abruptly jerked them away, finding no good place to put them as he stuttered on, pressing himself back against the sink, but finding no escape from the closeness. There was no way Potter didn’t hear Draco’s frantic heart trying to break free from his ribcage.
“Well, it’s a bit weird to say I guess, but sure… I think he’s an attractive man. He’s not the manliest guy though, so I guess he’s more beautiful than handsome really…” Amelia knew that Harry wasn’t aware of how his answer sounded to her, and it frustrated her even more.
The position was awkward and all the more frightening with the forced proximity. It was almost laughable as to an outsider it would’ve been difficult to discern if a heated love scene was about to ensue, but only if you didn’t have a front row seat to the blazing glare of one Harry Potter.
It was strange really, but not very surprising. Each one of the golden trio seemed to have the most forgiving attitude Draco had ever seen. How on earth could they all thank him so sincerely when helping them should’ve been the least he did after everything. But maybe that was exactly why those three ended up saving the whole wizarding world. Perhaps their kindness and forgiving nature were the reason as to why love prevailed.
“I came to return your tracking device.” Draco said as he entered the room and closed the door behind him. Potter just gave a small hum without looking up from his work. He had a frown on his face as he concentrated.
“What is?” Harry was now certain Hermione knew about Draco avoiding Harry.
“Fine.” The taunt obviously worked as Potter was now staring at him, squinting his eyes slightly, a look that was familiar to Draco. It resembled the young schoolboy who had snapped back at everything Draco had said, be it taunts or outright accusations. “If we’re going to get on the talent wagon, I can’t help but bring up the favourite topic of the day. Quidditch.”
“Wait… You actually hid from him?”
“If that’s what you want, then I’ll buy you the manor.”
A few heads turned in the great hall when Hermione jumped up in glee as Draco and Potter told her about the potion doing its work.
“Yes, I think so”
Because it was all buried underneath a joke, Draco felt oddly confident as he said things he would never dare say had the situation been different and not so absurdly ridiculous as it currently was.
“You already know that I’m not completely innocent, so it would be foolish not to be pointing a wand at you.” Draco scowled. “And I didn’t ask you to save me, now did I?”
The next week Pansy was called in for emergency work at Bewitched Dresses, which meant Draco was alone when he heard the bell jingle and saw Potter appear through the doorway.
“Hold on. How do you know about the potion?” Draco felt himself tense up, both in anger and in fear of having been caught. It had to be bloody Potter!
The look in Potter’s eyes had turned from playful to outright desire as he waited for Draco to make up his mind. “Yes.” Draco breathed, realising he had lost control of himself, unwilling to stop what was going on.
“Malfoy,” Malfoy looked up to see Weasley look at him with a strangely apologetic look. “I’m sorry about that, alright. You shouldn’t listen to what they’re saying.” He gave Draco an awkward pat on the shoulder before going into the classroom.
Draco was a bit taken aback by the friendliness of this stranger who seemed to be around his own age. That would indicate she was more than aware of the past and should know who she was currently talking to. “I’m glad to hear that. I was helping a friend at first, but word must’ve gone out as I’ve been swamped with orders of it now.”
