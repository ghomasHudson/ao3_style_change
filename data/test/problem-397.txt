"Yes, well the shop doesn't get the paper and I haven't seen news for a few years now other than the occasional wireless bulletin," unsure of how to respond to Potter’s comment.
"Don’t mind you hanging around at all. Honestly Aby should have been free now, but the customer in the back is just being difficult. Wouldn't see Luke for his appointment, but still demanded and tattoo, so here we are," she shrugs.
“Seeing as I very much do not want to tattoo anything beneath your pants I think you’re safe. Just strip off your trousers and shoes and I’ll get started. Shouldn’t take more than half an hour.”
“This is going to hurt. Not as much as a muggle tattoo, but it’ll still sting,” he warns, dipping the wand in black ink.
Harry sits back down as Malfoy turns back to his station to prep the new ink. He watches as he pours in a nearly clear ink into a cap, adds a crushed powder of sorts, and casts a spell. It reminds Harry of a pensieve memory, the way the color is just barely there but very alive in a way.
Harry was beyond impressed by what Jane has managed to create with something so innocuous as an earring. “That’s impressive Jane. I’m sure that there are plenty of people who could use a piercing that does that. I may have to tell my two friends to come see you.”
Aby took a deep breath, trying not to grip his tattooing wand too tight. "Yes, I became alright with many things before the war even ended but I had to play a part to stay alive. It's not an excuse but an explanation," he grits out. "But being at the shop and living with my friends, and having my own life has shown me how wrong my family was in so many ways."
Liam smirked when Aby lowered his voice. “Oh come on, Aby. What’s history matter when you’re just going to fuck? I could always see if Charlie would be up for a foursome, that way it could break the ice between you two.”
Harry laughs at Malfoy’s teasing and playfully gives him two fingers before extending a hand to help him up. “Hey, I can’t help that I’m not tattooed from head to toe like you and that I still look like a professional. I tried though.”
"A year? I really need to think you department needs work if you were looking for a year and couldn't find one man sleeping rough in London," he barks laughing, though his heart was breaking knowing his mother had tried to find him and believes him to be dead.
"I just want a tattoo, and from my homework I learned most shops had portfolios and flash so I thought I’d pick something out here and I did," he continues, impressing Aby with his knowledge of the basic vocabulary.
Her lips were a deep red, and earlier in the day she’d reapplied her makeup, much to Aby’s disdain. She was eager to see Harry Potter, not because of who he was, but just because she thought him so pretty.
“Yes, any issues with that Auror? Michael would be more than happy to pay another fine and I’ll be more than willing to stop this tattoo midway.
"Yes in a way. It's a mix. Not just one band on the record. This is a band called the Pansy Division," Aby replies, trying to not break concentration.
"Part of Michael's apprentice training it to go to a muggle shop and work there a bit. Muggles came up with tattooing not us, so it makes sense that we go to learn from them...and a few of my friends are artists in that area. One of them did about four of my muggle tattoo,” he explains, leaving out the part that his very talented ex had been that muggle.
“Usually a few days but it can be longer if needed,” he answers, still stunned that Potter was being understanding. Usually at this point half of his clients would wonder why they couldn’t just get it all done in one go.
Shaking himself out of shock, he clears his throat nervously, and answers the question the man behind the desk had asked as he entered. “I, erm, I have an appointment.”
Aby walks back to the front desk, writing down the session in the charge book and opening the schedule for his next week or so.
“Seeing as almost half my tattoos are muggle, and I’ve apprenticed as a muggle tattoo artist as well, I think I have a good idea,” Aby chuckles, keeping his hand steady.
Aby goes over the plan one more time before the decide on the final course of action, even deciding placement - on Harry’s ribs.
"He's an old new friend. Knew each other as kids and ran into each other when he booked an appointment at my shop," he explains vaguely. "He's definitely fit but not sure if it's a good idea to make a move on my part. Too much history and still just only know him barely as an adult."
“Can you take my 2pm movement charm on Thursday?" He asks after the sun has gone down and the pair began to stir. "He's a good tipper," Aby assures, and Luke agreed.
"Merlin why do people like doing that. I saw Aby get his and I nearly passed out and I become a wolf once a moon cycle,” Luke laments, his face whitening from the thought.
“Oh yeah? Like what? What have I done that’s worse? And it’s not that I’m afraid, I just...Well I’d be lost,” he corrects.
"Oh well I've certainly done a fair amount of those. Aby actually helped design charms for cock piercings," she says casually. "For sex I'd suggest either cock, nipples, or tongue. Up to you," she lists, getting out supplies, and placing it on the tray.
“It’s nice that you care about him enough to help him with his potion. Remus had to be self sufficient in that area if I’m not mistaken,” he murmurs.
“Well it can be if I’m actually being poisoned. Tonight, I get to be dosed by three poisons by Jane to see if her detection charm works right. I have antidotes, believe me. And a bezoar just in case.”
"I am saying fucking it and forgetting about it Jane! Or at least trying to. But it's complicated..."
Several weeks ago though, he’s found one of Sirus’ old journals from his time after Hogwarts right when the first war was getting underway. Between the secrecy and planning was Sirius detailing how he’d gone into London and gotten a muggle tattoo, and how it amused his friends to no end. Soon after he got another, magical this time, that tracked the phases of the moon for Remus in case they went somewhere without a calendar.
“Hey, I’m just asking,” Jane insists, throwing her hands up in surrender, walking to the sofa to sit down next to Luke.
“I’m surprised you didn’t find someone else to have fun with. You’re definitely attractive enough to have anyone you want,” Harry admits, blushing slightly at the idea of Malfoy taking someone home, as if it wasn’t exactly what he had been out to do.
"Such chivalry," Aby remarks, mildly sincere. "Oh Liam? They agreed to go home with someone else before I got here so no fun for me. Which is a shame seeing as my flat is empty for once."
“That is true. Wizards still don’t talk about anything too taboo” Harry murmurs. He heard the clack of Aby’s tongue ring and turns to watch him fiddle with it again, unable to look away. Merlin, why does he like that so much?
“Thank you for the compliment, but unfortunately from my understanding that spell requires a lot of genuinely happy memories, which I do not have in abundance. So in case we want to check the coloring, I might ask you to do me a favor,” he finishes, making some markings on the sketch.
“Oh. Well alright,” Harry replied with a nod, putting his clothes back on, a bit disappointed that Malfoy seems to just brush him off like that. He knows he shouldn’t expect anything more though, they aren’t exactly friends or anything, but he doesn’t understand why Malfoy seems drained all of the sudden.
“Malfoy!” Harry calls after him, frowning deeply as the blonde walked quickly away from him. “Do...do you want me to tell your Mum?” he asks, unsure of what he had said to upset him.
“Thanks. I was really lucky that Michael took a chance on me, even if it's cost him some business. I try to make up for it when I can," he murmurs, continuing his work, moving onto the gold ink, making sure he got the details right.
“I think that you both need closure at the very least,” Jane points out, rubbing his back. “And you know he isn’t a nuisance to me, part of me hopes he hangs around to continue flirting with me,” she jokes, trying to lighten the mood a bit. “You and Michael certainly don’t flirt with me,” she adds dramatically
"Don't worry about it. I do all my work here in long sleeves," he explains and uses his own wand to shoot a cooling charm his way. "Besides I'm almost done here so sooner I finish the sooner you can head out."
“What are you doing?,” Harry whispers as Malfoy grabs his hand and begins dragging him over to a group of admittedly good looking men.
"That they are. All science and no magic," Aby nods and takes his own slice of pizza before passing the box around, chasing it down with a beer, allowing himself to enjoy the cheesy goodness.
“You’re not too bad yourself Aby. Good luck finding someone, but let me know if you wind up talking that delicious brunette home. If not then I may ask him to join Charlie and me,” he notes, before they go off.
Coming out to wash his hands, he sees the unmistakable profile of Malfoy and gives him a smile in the mirror as he turns on the tap. The blonde gives the the auror a curt nod, dries his hands, and heads back out to the floor.
Aby balks. "You just said last time that you saw her from time to time. I just thought you meant a casual chat and wave if you passed each other in Diagon…”
"Yes it hurt but luckily we have potions that help. As for the charms, they’re, um, sex related," Aby responds, pinking a bit. “I won’t tell you what they do. That’s for me and the men in my bed.”
Aby just nods and turns to start cleaning his station. He needs to rest a bit from Potter’s session, having overworked himself a bit today after two back to back sessions.
“So nice to see that you’re feeling better Aby,” she teases, and motions for Aby to step back, and comes through the flames.
“Well I didn’t know until Dumbledore told me. My father gave it to me,” Harry explains, frowning slightly. “And I can’t help that I was literally thrust into that life. The stone was destroyed and I destroyed the Elder Wand after I defeated Voldemort,” he adds.
Aby was about to say something when a knock at the door signalled the pizza and he went to get it, taking the muggle money from the jar to pay.
Aby begins to work and puts some music on, opting this time for 70s punk on original records so the room fills with Clash as he works. Murmuring spells under his breath, focusing on the charmwork, he begins to work up a sweat.
"Because people will find me, first off. Then people will remind him of who I was, and how I'm no good for him, second. So it doesn’t matter if I’d be happier if he was more than a friend. Right now friend is enough."
"He just stayed the night after we drank too much at a party," Aby explains, as he starts the coffee, making sure it’s enough for three.  "It was one of those basement shows at Will's, you know how it goes," he shrugs and roots around in the fridge for two vials of hangover potion, tossing one to Harry.
"Thanks for the tip,” she says, handing Harry his receipt. “He gave his earnings, from this afternoon's jerk client, tip and all, to Luke so this will make up for it," she beams.
Harry blushes at the obvious flirt, and just smiles at her. “So what does Malfoy have to do with the charms?”
“Sorry! I didn’t mean to imply anything, I’m just still learning about you, Abraxas, versus Draco,” Harry clarifies. “Was he any good?” he adds, causing Aby to raise his eyebrows when Harry holds up his hands to clarify. “I meant art wise, not, you know...I was just curious about the piece he did?”
"Pretty standard. Had a few walk ins and a standing client who I'm doing a whole back piece on so it's taking a bit. Exhausted me when I finished the session yesterday but she's paying a pretty penny for it so I don't mind," he describes through a full mouth before crumbling up his trash and tossing it into the bin.
“Trying to get me drunk now, Aby?,” Harry asks with a smirk as he takes the drink, downing half of it in a gulp.
“Well I'm certain whatever witches do see them will be properly amazed," he murmurs, gathering the supplies for aftercare together for him.
“Long And I’m glad that it’s over. I ended up having to go out in the field this week and it made me realize how I yearn for desk work in the winter,” he answers. “How was yours?”
"Harry you need to realize that we've had a lot of people come around and screw us over," Jane explains.
"I think seeing as Harry's godson is the son of a werewolf and a metamorphagus, I'm certain he'll be okay with us being wankers," he quips, looking to Harry for confirmation.
"Honestly make you more sore," he laughs. "I'm imbuing more ink into your skin and it's on top of other ink so it will be unpleasant to say the least. But I can send you home with some potions to take that will help the pain and won't hinder healing.”
“Mmm I don’t think I’m going to go with tongue. Since my job is so public I don’t want people to see it, well, not all of the people,” Harry muses as he sits down in her chair, glancing at the door to see if he could spot Aby as his station was right next door.
“There seems to have been an error. It seems Luke, must have booked you under the wrong person. Let me just look at who's on shift and see if we can get you with another artist today,” Aby replies, trying to keep his voice even.
Harry frowns at Luke, resisting the overwhelming urge to tell him off. That definitely wouldn’t make anyone like more. “I’m not trying to control his life,” he begins, “I just want to bring him and his mother back together is all. And maybe try and fix this tension between us...because I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.”
Harry pauses for a moment and takes Jane’s words in. “Perhaps you're right. I’m sorry to have bothered you all tonight. I won’t come back to the shop for anything other than work if Malfoy doesn’t want me around,” he tells them, looking expectantly at the still silent Malfoy.
"No Potter I didn't think you'd enjoy getting your cock pierced because I didn't know your were doing that,” Aby spits back, ignoring the fact that his misconception was cleared up, and opts to run headfirst into an argument. “Just figured you two were having a moment alone and I was interrupting. After all you brought up how you're looking to date since you’ve got a lot of alone time. Playing the field and such, which you should certainly know Jane."
Harry spends the next week focusing on the information he’d learned. It was crazy that after so many years of trying to track down Draco Malfoy he was living right under his nose. In a tattoo parlour of all places. He was anticipating his next appointment, even if his boss at the DMLE frowned when he saw him reading through the Malfoy case file again.
“It is certainly very different to Celestina Warbeck. I’ll admit I don’t listen to much music but I’ve never heard any of the wizarding bands sing about this kind of subject...it’s a bit refreshing actually.”
“Is this what this is about?” Harry calls as he follows him down the hall, “is that why you’re so pissed at me? Because I have lunch with your mum?,” he demands as he moves to block the blonde’s way.
He beams at her, blushing a bit at the compliment and winks at her cheekily in turn. “You’re an angel, Jane, honestly.”
“If it helps, I have you down in his book for next Wednesday. Last appointment of the day and your listed as ‘Handsome’ so now worries,” Jane offers in consolation.
“He...he told me my family had me declared dead and I knew that would be the case but...it was hard to hear. And, he offered to reach out to my mother for me and goodness knows I don't need that sort of upheaval in my life...and if I get found. It's bad enough.”
Aby can’t help his wince at the name. "Potter, I’m going to do us both a favor and table this conversation for tonight. Tonight we are making proper fools of ourselves as if we didn't spend our teenage years as tools of war."
Harry sighs and nods. “You’re right. I’m sorry, I’m being wildly inappropriate. I just...nevermind,” he says pulling away.  “I need to respect your wishes. I’m sorry.”
“I’ll definitely be back for more ink and I’ll think about a few piercings. They’ll have to be hidden though,” Harry replies with his own wink, glad that she’s here to make him feel a bit better.
“Got it!” she chimes, leaving as quickly as she came. Harry looks over to his arm for the first time and notices the blood, not having realized this was making him bleed.
“That can be done, just need to put anchor points all over you. Really that’s just a pin prick of magical ink that I make invisible, so no worries on it being seen. You’ll just need to strip more than just your shirt next session.”
Harry shut up as soon as he hears the annoyed tone in Malfoy’s voice, feeling as if he’s put his foot in his mouth - again. He lets out a quiet sigh and decides to close his eyes and try to rest, focusing on the small hum of magic coming off Malfoy’s wand. He doesn’t want to wear out his welcome until his tattoo was finished, after all.
“Well,” he starts, biting his lip a bit unsure of whether or not he could trust Jane with additional information that would be a field day for the media, but seeing as the shop was a bit private, he took a gamble. “Well, I was with a man and Malfoy said that he was just being polite and giving me privacy. Besides there is no reason Malfoy would want me to stick around. I’m sure I’m just a customer to him, and someone from school he’d rather not see again,” he explains, running a tired hand through his curls. “I’m just...I’m so confused. We get along sometimes but other times it’s like he’s gone right back to hating my guts, as if he ever stopped in the first place.”
"It's nice that you want to be a part of Aby's life love," Jane says as he floats the tea tray in front, her tone a lot friendlier than Luke’s, "but from what I can tell you sort of run into situations head first without thinking of what might happen," she adds softly.
Harry pulls out the card and looks at it, marveling at how wonderful it was. “He is pretty amazing isn’t he?,” he breathes, swallowing hard before he grabs his coins. “Here, please make sure Aby gets all of this. Please let him know that I will be back for more work. And thank you and your husband for giving him a chance after the war, Jane. I’m glad to see he’s doing well.”
Jane frowns at that, torn between her need to run the shop and her desire to protect Aby. "Well then he's avoiding all his other appointment today as well,” she points out, wanting to prove Harry wrong in order to save Aby some face. “Best I can do is either have Michael do it for you, and he trained Aby, or move you to another day..." she offers in compromise.
Laying his shirt over the back of a nearby chair, Harry stretches before he takes his seat, letting out a soft groan. “So I wasn’t expecting to be so sore the next day when I woke up,” he comments, glancing at Malfoy as he pours over the magazine.
"My mother is under the impression that her son is dead and he is as good as. After all if my father gets word that I managed to scrape by and even more so if he learns how, my mother will have to mourn me again. Best just let it be. As for his tattoo, if he comes in again tell him that not everyone gets what they want, not even Harry bloody Potter."
"No need to bribe me. I'm not turning it down for me, I was giving you an out,” he scowls, taking a step back, still not trusting Jane’s wards after last time. “But if you want to continue, come back. My station is ready, I’ll just eat my lunch after we do the consult,” Aby murmurs, gesturing to the hall for Harry to follow.
Harry smiles as Draco slips an arm around him, automatically tucking his body into him. “Invite me over for a cuddle any time. I’m always this warm,” he promises.
Soon enough, Aby was done with the main snitch. Lathering a healing ointment over the piece and wrapping it, he taps Potter to let him know it was done, as the other man had clearly zoned out.
"By worse I meant scarier than walking into a sex shop and asking for some magical toys. Things like killing a megalomaniac, killing a basilisk, dealing with my godfather in Potions," he lists, letting himself enjoy the banter between him and Potter, as if they hadn’t been yelling at each other less than 20 minutes ago.
“At least it was a good split and that you still talk to him. Ginny and I ending was rough at first, and it’s still awkward from time to time...” he trails off.
Aby pulls his wand away fast enough that he’s able to laugh without ruining the shading. "Oh goodness no. Jane is Michael's wife and very much not my type."
Harry spent the next week focusing on the information he’d learned. It was crazy that after so many years of trying to track down Draco Malfoy he was living right under his nose. In a tattoo parlour of all places.
“I do, it’s nice but it gets lonely sometimes,” Harry admits. “I’m always having to go out if I want company since Hermione and Ron are usually busy with their family. It’d be nice to be able to stay at home and cook and watch a movie or something with a friend,” he adds with a sigh.
"Death eater gutter punk, what does that even mean?” he murmured to himself more than once that week. He’s played back all the conversations he had with Malfoy and wonders if he had called the man a death eater...had he? Unable to recall he was determined nonetheless to get his tattoo finished and talk to Malfoy.
Harry for his part lays against the chair, wondering how he could fix his fuck up from the other night, let alone approach the topic of conversation. But as he thinks about his options he finds himself tapping his fingers on the chair along with the beat.
“Stop looking, they are under your skin now and not visible. You’re all set for today. In two weeks' time we’ll get your movement charm done and you’ll be done. Same rules apply as last time with aftercare, and since Jane is up at the front you can get your healing potions from her and close out," he yawns, waiving Potter off.
"I didn't know you were in school with him,” she answers, a little surprised. “Honestly I don’t know much about Aby’s past. He’s private like that, but it figures that he went to some fancy school,” she giggles. “But if you want an answer the best I can give you is that he was probably getting on with you while tattooing you and decided to, well do what he did best, and push.”
"Next session I'll do the movement charms and chart the path. After that it’s the rest of the spell. Take your time getting dressed and I'll be at the front to check you out and book your next session," Aby says, pulling off his gloves.
Transfering the drawing was easy as it was a matter of placing the tracing paper on Potter’s arm and tapping it with the wand. Harry looks at the piece of wood in Draco’s hand and notices it wasn’t his old wand. He was about to ask about it, but thinks better of it and stands up as Malfoy guides him to the mirror.
"Potter the gay community is not that big. And it isn't as if I'm sleeping with my friends' boyfriends. I'm sleeping with other hookups and casual one nighters. If someone is off limits because of feelings, I'm not an arse and I stay away," he elaborates.
No amount of punishment, however, changed anything beyond Harry’s silence. It happened again and again. A man he passed on the street, a child playing in the river during a hot summer day, one of Mistress Figg’s numerous cats – he would feel their death, a metallic taste on his tongue, a prickling in his fingertips, a cool whisper against his neck.
Draco frowned when Harry came into the café later that day. There was a long queue for the lunch rush, but the look on Harry’s face was enough for Draco to take off his apron, tell his manager that he was taking his fifteen minute break, and slip out from behind the counter. He grabbed hold of Harry’s wrist and tugged him towards the disabled toilet. He locked the door with a flick of his wrist.
“This okay?” Harry murmured against his wrist, his eyes watching Draco’s face. Draco nodded mutely. Harry kissed the inside of his wrist above his racing pulse, and Draco drew impossibly closer. Harry ducked his head, suddenly shy. Draco pressed his chin up with his fingertips. He searched Harry’s face for any sign that this was a joke, that Harry didn’t want this, that this was a horrible mistake – there was nothing, just green eyes wide behind wire-rimmed glasses. Harry’s gaze flickered between Draco’s eyes and his mouth, and he licked his own lips quickly, unaware of the tsunami threatening inside Draco’s chest. Draco, on the other hand, had had enough.
Draco whipped around to gape at him. Potter chuckled. “Well, over your trial, really,” he corrected. “She couldn’t understand why I defended you in court, after – she all but blamed you for Fred’s death, even though it wasn’t your fault – and there were other things,” he finished with a shrug. Draco narrowed his eyes. He suspected Potter was skipping over far more than he let on, but for once, he decided not to push things.
Draco rounded on Harry. He raised his hands in surrender. Draco, his face set in stone, strode over to Harry. He placed his hands on either side of his face, his sweating palms against Harry’s jaw, and pulled him into a rough kiss.
He heard an intake of breath and looked over his shoulder. Harry stood, leaning against the doorframe, watching him from a distance. He was barefoot and wore a tight black jumper that stretched across his broad chest and a pair of dark wash jeans. His green eyes reminded Draco of a cat, the way they looked him up and down, like he was a mouse Harry considered eating. Harry pushed his glasses up his slightly crooked nose with a smile.
Wilkins did not look in shock. He was whistling to himself as he did the dishes, standing on top of an upended milkcrate to reach the sink. It was only when Auror Williamson, who had been awkwardly keeping watch by the doorway, told him that Wilkins had been washing the same dish for the past twenty minutes that Harry began to see the problem. Harry set his empty coffee cup down on the kitchen table and approached the house elf, clearing his throat. Wilkins turned around. He was wearing a neon pink pair of washing up gloves, a harsh contrast to the filthy pillowcase he wore. His tennis-ball sized eyes bulged at the sight of Harry.
Harry didn’t care if anyone saw them. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck and kissed him. Draco pulled him close, one arm around Harry’s waist and the other in his hair as he deepened the kiss. They only came up for air when something cold and wet landed on their cheeks. They looked up.
“To be fair, that was your father he got into a fight with, not you,” Harry pointed out. Then, choosing his words carefully, he added, “And you’re not your father, Draco. Give the Weasleys a chance to get to know you, and I’m sure they’ll like you well enough.”
Harry let out a long breath. He lowered his hand until it came to rest against Draco’s chest, where beneath the pyjamas the silvery scars criss-crossed each other across the pale skin. “And these,” Harry whispered back, “remind me of what I did to you. Your skin bears all the marks of our mistakes. But you shouldn’t have to carry them alone.”
The king, perhaps, didn’t help matters by addressing Harry first when he came into the room – “Ah, good, you’re here, excellent” – before turning to stand at the end of the council table and demanding, without preamble, to know why his councillors were keeping him in the dark. Harry smirked, crossing his arms and legs and sitting back in his chair as the councillors scrambled to reassure their king that of course they’ve been keeping him informed, where in the world had – was it this human, trying to turn the advisors against their king –
Harry frowned at the note. They had never met up at any other time, always assuming that if they missed tea that day, they would simply see each other the next day. He told Neville about it over lunch when Malfoy didn’t show up. Neville shrugged.
couch – Neville and Lavender quickly followed suit, leaving Harry, Luna and Ginny sitting loose-limbed on the floor, trying to ignore the couples around them. Ginny snuck glances at Harry through her lashes. Luna, meanwhile, chattered on about crystals and auras and how she could absolutely tell someone’s future based on the alignment of the stars on the day they were born, or the lines on their palm. Then, she reached over suddenly and took Harry’s hand in hers, flipping it over to look at his palm.
Penelope. When Death called her name, Harry had tried to stop it. He had planned to skip Mistress Figg’s lesson so that he could play with her out by the stream behind her house, or go with her to market, or do anything that would keep her from the main road that day. But then his aunt had him help the cook prepare for his cousin’s birthday dinner instead of going to lessons, and he had been trapped in the kitchen, stomach roiling from the smell of boiled pig’s feet for the aspic and the panic rising inside him as he watched the sun outside climb higher and higher in the sky.
“D-Draco? Come off it, mate, I was just – what’s gotten into you?” Parkinson stammered. He looked from Draco to Harry and back again. Harry could see the wheels turning behind Parkinson’s dark eyes. When his mouth dropped open in an ‘o’ of realisation, Harry knew.
And for his part, he kept his word. Then, on the Beltane before his nineteenth birthday, Harry tumbled into the drawing room, flushed and out of breath. He called for Draco as he straightened up, looking around the familiar old room. Draco’s pale figure appeared in the doorway with a curious look. Harry grinned at him.
Every time, Harry would push down the tears, the urge to try and stop the death, to avert her path, to save them. When he saw the young girl from down the road laid out in her casket, her sparkling black eyes closed to the light of day pouring in through the warped glass of the sitting room window, he had wanted to fall to his knees and sob. He had known she would die the week before. She was one of the few children who didn’t fear his cousin enough to play with him, who made him laugh and forget that when he went home, he would have to clean out the chamber pots and wash the bed linens.
“What good comes from you being in love with a fucking ghost?” Draco retorted with a hint of his old sneer. “For fuck’s sake, Harry, you have a whole life ahead of you! Who knows, the love of your life is probably back in London somewhere, and you haven’t even met them yet! You can’t stay here with me forever!”
He jumped and turned around. Draco snickered at his surprise, a hint of his old sneer on his lips, though now it was teasing rather than malicious. Harry put a hand over his racing heart as he scowled playfully at him.
Draco sighed sharply, his shoulders falling dramatically as he turned at last to Harry, dropping his hands onto the cutting board with a clatter. “Do I have to spell it out for you, Potter?” he demanded, frowning.
Harry looked up. His smile was crooked as his green eyes shone behind the dirty lenses of his glasses. “Because I’m realising something,” he said, “that I should have realised a long time ago.”
“And why not use the Killing curse?” Harry added, gesturing at the blood-spattered table with his coffee cup. “Why use that particular curse? This was personal. Vindictive.”
“I’m not going to fight you, Malfoy,” he said. There again was the surprise, but this time Malfoy pressed his lips together as he watched Harry, considering him warily. “You know I can’t just leave and let you do whatever Voldemort sent you here to do.”
But then they heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs, and they leapt apart, flushed, lips slick and bruised from kisses. Eyes wide, they both grabbed their books and ran towards the boys’ dormitories, passing a bleary-eyed Neville and yawning Kevin on the steps as they went.
Neville shook his head as he grabbed his coat. “Can’t believe I bet five Galleons on New Year’s,” he muttered to himself. “Who would have thought things would escalate so quickly?”
Draco looked from Harry’s earnest green eyes, at the flecks of gold and brown around the pupil he’d almost forgotten all about, then down to the curve of his lips. Without thinking, he leaned forward and kissed him.
He heard Draco give a dry laugh. Then, a cold breath of air fluttered against Harry’s side. He turned, and there was Draco, lying next to him with his arms behind his head. His skin was like starlight… Lord, what was Harry thinking? But still, he couldn’t look away.
Malfoy was sitting in the bed, his knees pulled into his chest, the lightweight coverlet tucked in around him, all the while staring at the dresser covering the fireplace. He startled when Harry came in, his hand flinching towards his wand besides him. Almost immediately, though, he relaxed, his shoulders slumping.
“Draco, Draco, God, I’m not going to last, Draco, fuck, you okay?” he asked as he felt Draco gag around him. Draco gave an affirmative hum, and that was it. Harry came hard with a cry and Draco, in his surprise, swallowed. When Harry’s orgasm had passed, he pulled off his cock and rocked back on his heels. There was a bit of cum at the corner of his mouth as he stared wide eyed at Harry.
Draco turned and caught Harry’s lips with his just to be sure. Harry grabbed hold of the front of his shirt, pulled him impossibly closer, licking up into Draco’s mouth. The kiss was slow and deep, exploring the sensation of lips against teeth against tongues. Then Draco pulled away, kissed along the line of Harry’s jaw, nipping his teeth along the line of his neck, making Harry gasp out a moan. He pulled at Harry’s jumper. Harry didn’t hesitate in taking it off and tossing it into a corner. Draco pushed him back towards the bed, a predatory glint in his eye as Harry, grinning, backed up until his knees hit the bed and he stumbled onto the mattress with a yelp. Draco snickered. Harry scowled, but then Draco was crawling on top of him, straddling his hips as he pushed him back into the mattress.
Harry laughed. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he said as they made their way down the grand staircase. “There’s no such thing as vampires or ghosts.” He looked over his shoulder and winked. The pale figure of a man waved at him from the landing with a smile.
The group gasped. They all turned to Harry, expecting him to grimace or laugh or, better yet, punch Draco. But Harry was smiling that dangerous smile, and the way his teeth bit slightly into his lower lip made Draco want to whimper. He was still a Malfoy, though, and this was Harry. So Draco only smirked back in answer. Harry got up and crossed the circle to Draco. He offered his hand, an excited glint in his eyes as he said, “I dare you to come with me, then.”
It was Neville’s bright idea to draw straws. So one by one, they drew a straw from the bundle Neville conjured, and went about finding their pair. Which was how Draco found himself matching up with Harry ‘Let’s Be Friends’ Potter.
Harry, who had leaned forward to read her writing upside down, scrawled in a free space on the parchment,
“You think so?” he asked, trying and failing to keep the incredulity out of his voice. “Could have sworn he threatened to have me killed just a minute ago.”
Piers cut him off with a high, cold laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stand on end. “Oh no, no, no, Draco,” Parkinson said, stuffing his hands into his trousers, “I’ve already done all that. Sent it off this morning.” A muscle in Draco’s jaw jumped as he clenched his teeth. “No, this is a more personal touch,” Parkinson continued. “A little coming out party, as you f**s call it.”
Their kiss grew hungry, desperate. Draco crowded him against the parapet, the stone wall digging into Harry’s mid-back. The hand not already tangling itself in Harry’s curls slipped down Harry’s back, making him arch like a cat up against Draco. Harry wanted more, needed more. He rose up on his tip-toes, trying to gain control of the kiss, using his arms around Draco’s neck to pull himself up while trying to scoot up the wall, one leg wrapping around Draco’s hip. Draco pulled back slightly.
Instinctively, irrationally, he winced, expecting a blow that didn’t come. Draco moved his hand from the back of the sofa to rest on Harry’s knee, before it slipped down his shin to curl around his ankle, his touch sending an electric current through Harry’s leg. Draco’s thumb brushed back and forth against the jut of his ankle bone. Harry shivered.
“Seriously, Draco,” he said. Malfoy shivered, and Harry thought he could see a pink flush in his cheeks as he continued, “I am so sorry. I can imagine what you’re going through right now, and I’m here if you need me.” He stroked the back of Malfoy’s hands with his thumbs. Malfoy’s skin was so soft under Harry’s calloused fingertips, but also so cold. Draco blinked at Harry, processing his words. Harry’s gaze dropped unconsciously to Draco’s lips, which were chapped and dry. As he stared, Malfoy licked his lips, quickly as if he wasn’t fully aware of it himself, and Harry felt his heart begin to race.
Draco’s brow furrowed. “Tetsuo?” he asked. Harry shrugged. “That was ages ago. It didn’t even last that long.” Tetsuo, it turned out, was great in bed, but was even more emotionally cold than Draco – they ended up freezing each other out. He was the one who had found the mouse remains in his shoes. “Who even told – Pansy.” He shook his head with a twisted smile. He was going to kill her for letting out that titbit of information. For now, though, he pulled Harry in for a chaste kiss. “I’ve missed you every day,” he murmured against his lips, their noses brushing. Harry beamed.
“Does it matter?” Draco asked, his voice only shaking a little. “He’s gone now.” Then, under his breath, barely loud enough for Harry to hear, he whispered, “He’s safe now.”
“It’s fine,” he told Harry, forcing a smile at the canopy of the four poster. “You’ve done worse.” Harry scowled.
“I can’t tell you that,” Harry said softly. “But I have to ask – do you know if any of the Death Eater’s knew of or used that spell besides Snape?”
“Still,” Draco insisted, turning around to look at him. “I am sorry. Really. Especially after the way I treated you all those years.”
“Pansy. When she was beating me up she said that the best thing for me was going back to Hogwarts thinking the love of his life was better off without him.” Draco looked down at his hands, pressing himself as much into the corner of the couch as he could. Harry sucked in a breath. “I… I just needed to know… It’s stupid, I’m sorry, I should go.”
“Perfectly alright, my boy,” he replied. He turned to Draco. “As far as your tale, Mr. Malfoy – don’t worry, I believe every word, but you have to admit, it is quite a tale. I assure you, I do not blame you for your attempts to kill me. You had much to lose if you didn’t succeed. Now, of course, we must consider what to do in light of all this. Are you willing to hear what I have to say?”
He could feel Draco’s cheeks blazing against his skin. “Oh,” Draco whispered. “Oh. Okay. Well. Good.”
“I talked to Hermione,” he began slowly. Draco raised an eyebrow, but said nothing. “She did some research, and we, er, talked it over.” He readjusted his sweating grip on the paper, took a deep breath, and blurted out, “I think I might be asexual.”
“Shoot,” said Harry as he wiped the back of his hand across his mouth. Draco’s eyes tracked the movement, lingering on Harry’s lips before looking away, a rosy blush on his high cheekbones as he sipped his whiskey.
Harry shook his head. “Not necessarily,” he said. “Memories don’t always work. It can be a thought, a hope, a dream, anything. It just has to fill you with light, you know?” He pulled his own wand out and murmured the incantation almost lazily. A silver stag burst out of his wand, coming to stand expectantly on the hearth rug. Harry smiled at it, the corners of his eyes wrinkling affectionately, before waving his wand again and dispelling the stag into a misty haze.
Harry had never been good at hiding his emotions, and that moment was no exception. Malfoy narrowed his eyes at him and scoffed.
A prophet once told Voldemort that there would come another that could vanquish him, and that neither could live if the other survived, for there could only be one Master of Death. Mad with power and greed, he found the family last known to hold the first of the three sacred relics and slaughtered them all – except for a baby, who somehow caused the curse to rebound. And so Voldemort was sent into Hel.
“Or his other head, if you know what I mean,” Draco said under his breath. Harry snorted. Hermione ignored them and continued.
Later that night, as the children drowsed on the couches and the adults broke out the spiked eggnog, Draco let himself be pulled into Harry’s side as they sat around the dining table with the others. He rested his head on Harry’s shoulder, closing his eyes for a moment with a content sigh. Harry played with the hair on the back of Draco’s neck, marvelling at how long it had grown since Draco had shown up at Hogwarts. The rest of the Weasley’s shook their heads at the sappy couple, some with knowing smiles and the others with disbelieving frowns. Harry didn’t mind, and Draco didn’t seem to notice. Finally, Ron and Hermione had to go and put Rose to bed, and many of the other parents followed suit. Teddy protested when Andromeda woke him up from where he had passed out on the couch, still wearing his leather jacket, but Harry came over and promised to come see him soon, after which Teddy reluctantly let himself be led away by his grandmother. Draco watched them, having gotten up sleepily to watch from the doorway. Harry gave him a funny look.
Hermione frowned as she turned on Draco. “Alright, then,” she said, her voice calculating and cold. “Let’s do this, shall we?”
Luna shook her head with a bemused smile. “It was bound to happen sooner or later,” she said cryptically. “Which reminds me, Seamus and Neville owe me twenty Sickles.”
“Do you.” It wasn’t a question. Blaise leaned forward, both feet planted now on the stone floor as he rubbed his hands together slowly, elbows on his knees. He considered Draco from beneath furrowed brows. “Do you ever think,” he said, picking his words with care, “that maybe it’s something else?”
Draco shook his head, distracted by how close Harry’s face was to his as he held up the Cloak a bit with one hand. Harry grinned and grabbed his hand, half-running and half-dragging Draco down the empty corridors. Their hushed laughter woke some of the portraits, who grumbled about new, inconsiderate ghosts. Draco didn’t care. Harry’s hand was just like he remembered back in his family’s kitchen, warm and calloused and perfect. His heart raced with their feet as they snuck out the castle doors into the grounds, the frost crunching beneath them as they ran.
Harry jumped. Malfoy’s lips quirked into a smile, his grey eyes twinkling with laughter. Harry put his hand over his racing heart with a sharp exhale.
McGonagall hummed and set her cup down in its saucer. “But you have no reservations beyond that in regards to his character?” she prompted, studying him over her glasses. Harry rubbed his face, pushing his own glasses up into his curls to scrub at his eyes. He wanted to say yes, that Malfoy was still the arrogant brat he had known during their school years, but… he was almost thirty, and it had been years. He wasn’t completely unaware of what Malfoy had been up to since he had been released from Azkaban – he had been sentenced to a year, but got off after six months for good behaviour, and because Harry had testified on his behalf at both his initial trial and his appeal. He had apparently gotten his NEWTs through a private tutor – it had been too much of a risk for him to come back to Hogwarts – and then on to a certification to be a Potions Master. He collaborated with St. Mungo’s Healers to devise new potions for the medical field, and was known throughout the wizarding community not for his family, but for his accomplishments. Harry couldn’t help but feel a bit proud of the bastard. Not that he would ever tell him that.
Draco, intrigued, approached Potter, leaning against the balustrade next to him. Potter looked up and gave him a smile, handing over the parchment.
“Well, Mother is in France with family – she says I can come out to see her, but I’ll probably just stay here. I don’t want a horde of Malfoys demanding to know if there is a woman in my life, or if I’ll work for the Ministry like Father.” His knight took out Harry’s bishop and dragged it off the board before returning to its spot. “What about you?”
“House elf by the name of Wilkins reported the crime at 10:05am. He did not see the crime take place and says he did not hear anything unusual. He found his master dead and his mistress bleeding out at the dining table – he did not see anyone else, although the Malfoy son, Draco, was at the breakfast.”
Malfoy pressed his left forearm close to his side, his expression closed even as his eyes cried for help. “I didn’t have a choice,” he snapped. Harry scoffed.
“Do you have plans for the winter hols?” Harry asked, moving his pawn forward. Draco pursed his lips as he studied the board.
Harry looked at Draco in surprise. Tears were starting to spill down Draco’s flushed cheeks, and even as he clenched his jaw, Harry saw his chin tremble. “Draco,” Harry whispered, “it’s okay, let me handle this.” But Draco shook his head, a determined light in his eyes.
. Now, you think that Draco got into some sort of heated argument with his parents – over what? You don’t know? Well, it must have been something incredibly important for him to have used this specific curse. Interesting choice, isn’t it? Not a very common curse – in fact very few people know about it. Why not use the Killing curse? It’s faster. Ninety-nine percent success rate, although if you ignore me it would be a hundred percent, wouldn’t it?” Harry raised an eyebrow, and Jenkins whimpered. “But no,” Harry continued, “he used a curse meant to maim, to hurt, a curse that without the counter curse keeps the blood from clotting and is thus almost impossible to heal. A curse he himself has personal experience with. Did you know, Jenkins, that when he was sixteen, Draco was attacked with that same curse, leaving him scarred for life? No? Why, do you think, Jenkins, would he use that particular curse to kill his parents in a fit of sudden and uncharacteristic bloodlust over breakfast? Explain that for me, would you, Jenkins?”
“Oooo, so original,” Harry teased. He nudged Draco’s shoulder, looking up at the other boy with twinkling eyes. Draco smiled back. The hopeful warmth in his grey eyes sent Harry’s stomach skittering in circles so that he had to press his lips together to ensure it didn’t come tumbling out of his mouth. Then Draco’s smile faded, and he looked away, shoving his hands into the pockets of his trousers. Harry’s shoulders slumped, crestfallen, as he frowned at his boots.
Harry tugged him along, whispering, “Come on, come on, come on!” as he pulled him into one of the greenhouses. They cast off the cloak and Harry, pulling his hand from Draco’s, folded the cloak over his arm. Draco’s heart only had a moment to protest before Harry’s hand was back in his, as if it was only natural.
But Harry knew. He knew why his aunt and uncle despised him, why his cousin Dudley bullied him, why they beat him with the books they found secreted away in the cellar. He knew it had to do with his parents, with the scar on his forehead, and with the way he could sense when someone was about to die.
Draco’s blush darkened until his cheeks were completely crimson. He came down the stairs, stopping on the last step as Harry strode over to him, his hand trailing on the banister. He bit his lip to hold back his pleased smile and draped his arms around Harry’s neck. The robe was made of a heavy wool, and it itched slightly against Harry’s palms as he rested them on Draco’s narrow hips.
Draco let out a long, audible sigh and planted his hands flat on the table, his head hung low. Potter passed a hand over his face and shook his head.
Malfoy laughed again. His laugh was so free, relaxed even – Harry had never heard him like this, not even when Malfoy was with his friends. For a moment, Harry saw him not as Malfoy but as Draco, open and vulnerable. The other boy stood, straightening his button-down and passing a quick hand through his hair.
“Your powers of observation are improving. It’s the second volume,” Draco replied as Harry flopped into the seat opposite him.
Pansy had been right, it seemed. No one cared that he was there. Or, rather, no one cared that a former Death Eater was crashing their lovely reunion. Most gave him a polite nod, others waved. The other Slytherins quickly flocked to them, and soon Draco found himself stuck in a booth as another round was ordered while they chatted about life after Hogwarts. Draco, squeezed between Pansy and Blaise, just wanted to go home. He sipped at his second whiskey, exhausted by the noise and incessant chatter. Pansy kept nudging him, trying to get him to engage, but each time Draco would just respond curtly to whatever question was asked of him before returning to staring at his drink. He wondered if it was possible to Apparate without moving. So far, no luck.
“No, I’m sorry, please just send Kellen through, it’s urgent.” His gut twisted at the thought of Ron helping with bringing his own brother in – no, he and the Weasleys had been through enough, and now…
“So whoever is selling them the stuff must know who they are,” Draco finished, already reaching for his robes. “No time like the present. Let’s go.”
“Because I will not have a queer as a son!” Lucius bellowed, slamming his hands on the desk. Draco winced. Then he nodded once. His expression shrivelled as if he was swallowing acid. He stood, shoving the watch into his pocket.
“Alright, that’s enough,” said Harry. “Thank you, Kellen. I’ll see you tomorrow in the office, okay?”
Harry snorted. “You put far too much faith in my position,” he said morosely. “If it was that easy, they would have gotten rid of the Dementors at Azkaban already, or taken my advice and started a Prisoner Rehabilitation Program, or done anything with any of the fucking proposals I sent Kingsley my first year or so on the force. Nothing.”
Draco stormed into their room, fists clenching and unclenching at his sides, heart pounding, partially from climbing seven flights of stairs. Of course, not only had he been matched with Potter, but they had both drawn the short straw, which meant they got the top room. Draco glared at the red curtained four posters, at the tall eaves above, at their luggage somehow already neatly stacked in the middle of the room. He strode over and kicked at Harry’s chest (a few times).
In the end, Harry left the office that night convinced that it would take them years to solve the case. Wanting to clear his head a bit, he walked home from the Ministry instead of Apparating. It was a clear, warm summer night, the sky ablaze with the late setting sun. The square near Grimmauld Place was full of life, the trees waving their young leaves at Harry as he passed, the sound of children laughing and muffled conversation drifting on the breeze. Harry smiled to himself. He forgot, sometimes, that life went on.
Draco tried to shrug and winced. Harry’s brow furrowed, but Draco shook his head a little, letting him know he was fine. “Two sides of the same coin, hate and love,” he said at last. “That memory I showed you? The first one? That was when I began to realise…so many things, but mostly that I had loved you all my life.”
Potter shrugged. “You’re right,” he said. “Dean, Luna and the Patil twins are sat just down the corridor, I could go and be with them.”
“But I do,” Harry reminded him firmly. He rubbed Malfoy’s back, feeling the knobs of his spine, the sharp just of his shoulder blades. His heart twisted, and he pulled Malfoy closer, as if doing so could absolve him of his sins. “I know exactly what he can do. And I promise, I won’t let him hurt you. Not if I can help it.”
“And ladies!” added Daphne. There was a chorus of groans throughout the common room. Daphne smirked at the gaggle of disappointed girls who approached her, digging the coins out of their pockets. Harry squawked in protest. Draco ducked his head to bury his mortification in Harry’s curls. Zacharias Smith stared at them from his seat by the fire, mouth agape.
The kitchen was long and narrow, with a galley kitchen and a massive stone fireplace next to a no longer functioning Victorian range. It was, by far, Draco’s favourite room in the house, filled as it was with all the familiarity of domesticity – herbs drying above the stove, jars and boxes of teas arranged on the countertops, a bouquet of daisies in a chipped blue jug on the table. He was sure some of these were Ginny’s touches, but he also couldn’t help but see Harry in every detail, from the massive box of PG tips to the Stasis spell on the flowers to keep them from dying too quickly.
“I’m right here, you know,” Draco protested, straightening up a bit in his attempt to look dignified. His body was starting to gripe about sitting on the hard stone hearth, and he crossed his legs, trying to get comfortable. “And I would rather not be made responsible for my criminally insane aunt, thank you very much.”
But Harry grinned. He picked up his book and came over to the other side of the bed, setting his wand and glasses on the bedside table. Draco watched, wide-eyed, as Harry got under the covers and laid next to Draco, holding the book out to him.
Harry knew that sleeping with a witness was a conflict of interest. But if all they did was sleep, with the occasional lingering kiss and explorative touches, surely it was fine. Besides, Kellen was the one officially investigating the case, he was just there to be a counsellor to her and a bodyguard to Draco. And seeing as the murderer was the brother of his best friend, well… Harry sighed heavily. He still couldn’t believe it, even though he had been the one to connect the dots. But grief, he knew, could change a person. Sometimes it made them kinder, more grateful of life’s small graces. Other times, it made them desperate, angry, and there was no telling what could happen if those demons ran unchecked.
“I don’t need to want something from you to be nice to you,” Potter retorted, flashing Draco one of those sparkling smiles he knew Potter reserved for his friends. Knowing that, of course, only made things worse. It was the same smile he gave Granger and Weasley when they chatted over drinks at the Drowned Siren, the same one he gave Luna when she told him about the research she was conducting on Nargles. Worse, it was the same one he gave to his fiancée, Ginny – on a good day, anyway. Draco shook that thought from his head just in time to hear Potter say, “We’re mates, and mates don’t go around insulting each other 24/7.”
It was a few kilometres into town, and another mile or so beyond to the manor. By the time Harry found himself on the old towpath towards the manor, his feet were sore and the sun had climbed high into the clear blue sky. He sat down on a rotting stump to drink his water and eat one of the apples he had brought with him as he wiped the sweat from his brow. His T-shirt stuck to his back, and a bead of sweat trickled down the valley of his spine. His knobbly knees stuck out from his well-worn cargo shorts, the black hair of his legs curling in the heat. His shoes were caked in mud and dust. He put away his water bottle, tossed the apple core into the undergrowth, and shrugged on his rucksack once more. There was no turning back now.
Harry nodded. He’d known when he and Hermione had argued. He’d known when he had watched Draco’s memories, when he had kissed him for the first time, when Draco had moved his things from the guest room into Harry’s bedroom. He’d known when Draco had excitedly shown him new buds forming on Amelia the orchid’s stalk, when he had looked over from reading
One day, Potter came into his office where Draco was writing up his case report and deposited himself into the chair opposite Draco’s desk before promptly burying his head in his arms on top of Draco’s files. Draco looked him over before returning to his report.
As Draco added salt and pepper, Harry asked, a sinking feeling in his gut, “So you can get out of this house? Was that what you were going to say?”
The chaise lounge smelled heavily of mildew, and the wall below the window had taken severe water damage. Guilt ran through Harry like a chill as he realised it was because he hadn’t closed the window properly last time. He slung his rucksack over his shoulder again and looked around. The drawing room was empty, dust motes floating in the sunbeams sneaking through the boarded windows.
Draco, surprised, nodded. Harry smiled, gave his arm another squeeze before his hand dropped away and he stepped back. Draco swayed slightly, as if Harry’s hand on his arm was the only thing keeping him upright.
curse. But,” he straightened up, his green eyes sparkling with smug mischief behind his glasses, “I can assure you, I didn’t do this, since I was in the office when it happened. So bang goes that theory as well. Maybe try not jumping to conclusions before you have all the evidence, eh, Jenkins?”
Wilkins trembled. His gloves squeaked as he wrung his hands. “Well, sir,” he said, voice shrill, “master and mistress have not had it easy since the war. Poor mistress, all those years without master, and neither went out, as they once did. Perhaps those who supported you against You-Know-Who would want to hurt them, but it’s been years, sir, and they’ve been so good to Wilkins. No, Wilkins can’t think of anyone, sir.”
“Oh.” She looked down at her feet and bit her lip. Draco wished he could sink into the stone floor. But this was his fault, too.
Harry laughed, and Draco couldn’t help but smile. He kissed the top of Harry’s head as he held him against his chest with both arms. “Fine,” he mumbled, “maybe I did.”
“I thought it would be nice for you to have your own cup,” Harry explained. “I know you like the one with the flowers on it, but this one has a charm on it to keep the tea warm so it never goes cold.”
Draco dragged his hands over his face, his fingertips covering his mouth as he stared at Harry in consternation. “Okay,” he said, lowering his hands back into his lap, “start from the beginning. What happened exactly?”
“I had panic attacks for years after the War,” Malfoy said, his voice so quiet Harry thought he might have imagined it. Malfoy let out a huff of laughter. “Mother chalked it up to the house arrest, especially in
He kissed down Draco’s chest, following the curving line of the dragon’s body with his tongue. He ignored Draco’s leaking cock, despite Draco’s whimpers, instead mouthing along the crease of his thigh. He proceeded to kiss all the way down the serpent wound around Draco’s leg. Draco clutched at the pillows as he arched up, desperate for more. Harry kissed the inside of his ankle where the serpent’s tail coiled around the bone.
Then, one day in May, so many years after their first visit together, they were married in that old stone church in the clearing. And as they slow danced on the grass outside, they held each other close, their hearts singing a single hymn.
“We share a locker room. They were bound to figure it out at some point. Luckily, Oliver was captain when I came out, so it wasn’t like the idea was new to them. Plus, if anyone had a problem, Oliver wouldn’t have hesitated to kick them off the team,” he said. “We’re all pretty close. How else did you think we pulled off last year’s prank? There was no way you could have thought Ron and I were the only ones putting shaving cream in your and your friends’ beds.”
“I know!” Harry called back with glee. Draco threw up his hands, but couldn’t suppress his grin. He’d get him back one day.
“Do you have something you want to tell me?” he asked, his voice a barely audible murmur. Draco shrugged, watching as Harry was berated by the elderly woman who was, it seemed, half-deaf, half-blind and convinced Harry was her nephew.
Hermione came down from the girls’ dormitories, hair frazzled and eyes dazed. She didn’t even notice Harry and Draco in the window seat and instead made a beeline for the snacks table, piling a plate high with custard creams and chocolates before turning back towards the dorms. She was taking every N.E.W.T. subject possible and already it was starting to take its toll. When Harry had asked her over lunch if she was coming to the party, she had thrown up her hands and exclaimed in a very shrill voice, “It’s a Tuesday! No, I’m not going to a party on a bloody school night!”
Malfoy still didn’t look at him. He pressed his knuckle down into the wood, biting down hard on his lip. Harry was quiet for a moment, then asked, “Why didn’t you say anything? At the Manor. You knew it was me – even with a Stinging Hex, you would have known because Hermione and Ron were with me.”
Potter sighed and pulled his knees up into his chest. “Sorry,” he said, his voice muffled by the glass. “Got a lot on my mind.”
“Sorry.” Draco raised his hands momentarily in surrender before returning to plopping two teabags into identical grey mugs. “Old habits die hard. I’m sure their house is lovely, despite everything I’ve said in the past.”
A few weary looking wizards scowled at him as they passed. He shoved his hands into his pockets self-consciously. It had been five years, but people still didn’t really trust him, even if he was acquitted. The goblins didn’t care, neither did most of the people he worked with, so long as he handed in his reports on time. But standing there in that vaulted space with its new abstract golden fountain glinting at its centre, he felt a hook in his gut, tugging him back through time and space, and he closed his eyes, lost in the memory.
“Well, maybe it was someone else then, maybe the same person who attacked Draco when he was sixteen?” Jenkins suggested in a small voice. Harry’s lips twitched into a cold, crooked smile.
“You are very cruel, Kellen,” Harry said, wiping tears from his eyes as he straightened up. Kellen tried to catch her breath, angling to face Harry.
“Draco.” Harry’s grip grew more firm. “Listen to me. Maybe you did know better. But you are making up for it. You are doing better. You’re here now, with me. Okay? Where are you?”
“I want to start over,” he said, addressing Malfoy’s scuffed up Oxford shoes. “With you, I mean.” He shrugged. “That, and if you died, this case would fall apart, so I have to keep you alive.”
did… all those years of him in my head….” He shook his head, rubbing at his scar absent-mindedly. Draco frowned.
They never actually talked about what happened the day of Harry’s suspension. Ron had come over for tea a few days after, probably at Hermione’s behest, and after an awkward moment of them both staring at their shoes, they had carried on as normal. At Christmas, he had noticed Ron glaring daggers at Draco, but amidst the hubbub of Weasleys, it was easy to guide Draco out of firing range. It had helped that Teddy was there. He and Draco were practically inseparable the entire time, and if Draco noticed Ron’s glaring, he didn’t say anything.
Harry chuckled. “Well, if I’m being honest, since sixth year. Although I knew I was attracted to boys since fourth year – I had the biggest crush on Cedric Diggory, before… well.” He grew quiet and took a bite of his sandwich, a bit of cress falling out and landing on his plate. Draco frowned.
“Four and four, yeah?” said Neville, looking around at their little rag-tag group. He, Harry and Dean were the only Gryffindors returning. Zacharias Smith, much to Harry’s dismay, had returned along with Ernie Macmillan and two Ravenclaw boys, Terry Boot and Kevin Entwhistle. “We could draw straws, or…”
Draco swore silently. He sat back down, considering his options as he tried to steady his sprinting pulse. Did he ask for the truth, and risk exposing himself in front of everyone, or go for the dare and pray that Potter had mercy on him? He let out a short huff. Right. Only one thing to do. He raised his chin a little in challenge. “Your choice,
He pulled away. Harry kissed along his jaw. There again was that distant voice – that feels nice, he liked that, but what was he supposed to do? Even now, Harry’s touch felt like it was reaching him through several layers of clothing, as if he was simply imagining the whole thing rather than experiencing it in real time. He groaned in frustration and pulled away further, away from Harry’s wonderful wandering lips. And when those green eyes blinked at him, confused and slightly hurt, he felt he might as well have shoved Harry away.
Harry pushed his glasses up to rub his eyes with a sigh. “Oh God,” he muttered. “I knew I shouldn’t have said anything.”
“Who are you?” demanded old Bathilde. She blinked owlishly up at him through his thick coke-bottle glasses.
He went quiet. Harry turned his head into Draco’s chest to press a kiss against his collarbone, a gentle reassurance. Draco kissed the top of his head in kind. When he continued, his voice was barely above a whisper.
In a heartbeat, Harry knelt down in front of his nemesis, his hands already reaching for the other boy when he realised what he was doing. He hesitated. But in his moment of hesitation, Malfoy tilted forward until he collapsed against Harry, his forehead on Harry’s shoulder as the tears sank into the exposed fabric of his shirt. Harry, unsure how he had ended up in this situation, wrapped his arms around Malfoy and held him through his tears. “It’s okay,” he murmured. “It’s going to be okay.”
“Same as you. Couldn’t sleep,” Potter replied easily. He turned away from Draco, his attention drifting over the grounds again. “I like to come up here. Check the map. Make sure everyone’s okay. I still can’t shake the feeling that something is going to happen, because when have we ever had a normal year at Hogwarts? But….” He trailed off, his fingers tapping against his crossed arms on the railing. “Maybe it’s just in my head,” he murmured, half to himself. “But that doesn’t make it any less real.”
Draco handed Harry a medium-sized parcel wrapped in green paper as Harry handed him a paper bag stuffed with gold tissue paper. Draco insisted that Harry opened his first, watching intently as Harry unwrapped his prize. There were two items – one being a letter-writing set tied in twine, complete with envelopes and self-inking quill, and the other a leather-bound book. Harry raised an eyebrow at the first.
“Her too. Did you know her name’s actually Chae-Yeong? She just used Cho because it was easier for people to pronounce, apparently.”
Harry squeezed his arm gently. When Draco dared to look up, Harry’s expression was soft, tender even. “Hey,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “It’s okay. I’m glad you’re here, actually. I’m just returning my uniform and picking up my last payslip, I’ll just be a moment. Wait for me?”
“Prat.” Draco raised his head to glare blearily at Harry, who grinned back. “Why do I even like you?” he mumbled. Harry tucked a wavy lock of white-blond hair behind Draco’s ear.
Draco rolled his eyes but got up, only to flop down on the bed behind Harry. Harry couldn’t stop smiling. Draco stretched himself out, arms behind his head as he settled against the pillows. Harry took his damn time taking off his trousers, his eyes constantly fixed on Draco, memorising the shapes and lines of his tattoos. Draco ran his hand down his own stomach, watching Harry watch him, never breaking eye contact as he slipped his hand under his pants. Harry swore, his eyes almost black with lust. He stepped out of his trousers quickly, then his own boxers, never looking away from the show Draco was putting on. Draco stroked himself languidly, mouth falling open in pleasure, his cock already leaking and staining the front of his pants. All the while, his eyes combed down Harry’s body. At the sight of Harry’s half-erect dick, he let out a shaky moan.
Draco sighed and set his half-eaten lunch on the desk. “There isn’t. I was just….” He hesitated, biting his lip. “This volume focuses on the counter-spells. I thought, maybe, there was a way to break the bond.”
Slowly, Harry’s breath began to even out. His grip on the back of Draco’s shirt relaxed. He sniffled.
Draco’s jaw dropped as he stared at Harry. Ginny blinked once, turning to look at her fiancé. If she was surprised, she didn’t show it. Instead, her shoulders slumped, an odd mixture of pain and relief rippling across her face. Harry rubbed at his eyes with the heel of his hand, pushing his glasses up with a sigh. He slid them back into place. He looked first at Draco in apology, then at Ginny for forgiveness.
The next morning, Harry woke bright and early, a little stiff but no worse for wear. He immediately looked over at the bed. Malfoy had fallen asleep curled up on his side, a small crease between his eyebrows. Harry had a sudden urge to smooth it away. Instead, he threw off his blanket and got up to start his day.
“No, wait.” Harry hand lingered a moment on Draco’s knee. “Please.” He bit his lip and withdrew his hand, leaving Draco feeling suddenly cold without it. He looked down at his lap. “I… I don’t know what ‘love of my life’ even means… but I know that not a day, not a year has gone by that I haven’t been in love with you. But… if you don’t feel the same way, I understand.” Harry swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. “I know that you… that last night meant nothing to you –”
Draco pushed off from the table and pulled up his stool. He sat down, resting his head in his hand as he listened to Potter ramble on. He smiled to himself as Potter, in his exasperation with the case, began gesturing wildly. He hated when Potter talked with his hands, it was very distracting, the way they made him wonder what it would be like to have those hands on his body, if they were as strong as the rest of him. He inhaled deeply, let it out through his nose so Potter wouldn’t notice. He didn’t care about doing more work on the case. He would sacrifice every weekend he had just to listen to Potter all day with his horrible, distracting hands.
Malfoy laughed softly. “Fair enough,” he said. “Well, as I said before, I just got back from France. Visiting family, all that. They would rather know why I’m not married yet rather than my recent work on cancer treatment potions.”
Then, when he saw Potter limp and lifeless in Hagrid’s arms, he felt his own breath stop, the darkness poised to swallow him whole. It was over.
Ron stared at Draco as he stood, frozen, in the kitchen doorway. Draco looked at him over the rim of his mug, one eyebrow arched as he leaned against the farmhouse-style kitchen sink. Outside, the bleak winter sun shone on the frozen earth around the Burrow, and Draco could just hear Harry laughing at something Molly Weasley said. Ron shook his head slowly and rubbed his eyes.
“You survived Christmas at the Burrow,” Harry pointed out in an undertone. “I’m sure you’ll be fine here, too – at least here everyone has to be polite.”
The minute the door closed behind Malfoy, shutting out his chuckling laugh, Harry dropped his head in his hands and groaned.
Harry shrugged. “He wasn’t what I wanted, really,” he said quietly. “It’s hard to love someone when you’ve already given your heart away.”
Teddy bit his lip as he looked from one godfather to the other. Draco gave him an encouraging nod. With a long sigh, Teddy mumbled, “I think I fancy boys
Malfoy seemed to know he was being watched but continued to ignore Harry. Something about the tone in his voice let Harry know that the conversation was winding down. Malfoy ran his free hand through his fine hair, mussing up his perfect coif, as he muttered, “Oui, oui, bisou, Maman.” Finally, he hung up and tossed his phone onto his bed before flinging himself down onto the bed as well. He let out a long groan of exhaustion that made Harry’s lips quirk up into a smile.
Draco let out a small laugh, tried to disguise it with a cough. “Yes, well, I don’t exactly believe in all this, anyway,” he admitted, waving in the direction of the curtain only to remember with a blush that the priest couldn’t see. His hand fell back into his lap. “My family isn’t exactly the religious type.”
Harry didn’t know how to deal with a crying Malfoy. The last time he had, Malfoy had tried to curse him. But the man had just lost his parents, and Harry did know how to deal with that.
“HA! Yes! Blaise owes me twenty galleons!” she crowed. Draco almost choked. He just managed to swallow before he spat out,
“Weasley. Granger,” Malfoy said, giving them each a curt nod. When his gaze landed on Rose, his brow furrowed. “Tiny Weasley,” he said at last.
Again, Draco nodded. He pulled his hand away from Harry’s, who was looking from Dumbledore to Draco in aghast astonishment. Draco folded his hands in his lap, his back ramrod straight as he bowed his head, listening to Dumbledore’s plan.
“Not really, no,” he said slowly. He picked at the pilling on his old Weasley jumper. “I, er, well, I.” He cleared his throat.
“Before two days ago, we didn’t talk, period.” He raised his eyebrow at Harry, a challenge. “And what is there to talk about?”
Harry grinned down at the cat as he leaned back on his hands. “This is my kind of cat,” he chuckled. “Although he does remind me a bit of Crookshanks, who absolutely hated me.” He glanced at Draco, sucked his lower lip between his teeth as he considered the other man. Draco felt his cheeks flush and refused to meet his gaze, instead focusing entirely on petting Scorpius. “Why did you come to see me at the Ministry?” he asked.
“If Harry is helping, I can help,” Draco argued. Harry turned, confused at Draco’s sudden insistence on being useful.
Draco blinked. There again was that indecipherable look, but Harry thought that, maybe, he was beginning to understand. Before he could unlock it, it was gone. Draco turned away, taking the lid off the pan and adding the herbs before checking on the water, which had begun to simmer. He added a generous amount of salt to the water, then pulled a can of tomatoes and a tube of tomato paste from the cupboard. Harry’s smile grew as something swelled in his chest, like a Hippogriff spreading its wings. It was strangely endearing to see how comfortable Draco had become in Harry’s kitchen. Draco peeked at him out of the corner of his eyes and scowled.
Harry swallowed. Unsure how to respond, he simply slipped the coin back into Malfoy’s pocket. Malfoy glanced up, eyes searching. This close, Harry could see a scatter of freckles across his pointed nose, a scar above his lip, the flush creeping up his neck from beneath his starched collar. He smelled like lemon and mint muddled in ice, melting in the sun. Harry’s heart sped against his ribcage, a sharp tattoo tapping out a beat both new and startingly familiar. Malfoy’s gaze lingered on Harry’s lips before he forced himself to meet Harry’s eyes. With a strange sense of satisfaction, Harry noticed Malfoy’s breaths were sharp and shallow, his pupils dilating as they stared at each other, reconsidering and reveling in the heady tension between them.
“I know my son,” Narcissa replied with a smirk. “In any case, there are lives at stake. Draco knows this. He wants to be a good king, a good ruler, and – well, suffice it to say, Lucius would never have asked an Ænglian necromancer to help him, no matter their accolades.”
“Like what?” Hermione demanded. “Like what, Harry? I want to know. Because believe it or not, I want you to be happy, but I’ll be damned if you get your heart broken over Draco fucking Malfoy. I know you,” she added, pointing a stern finger at him, “you don’t do anything by half. In for a penny, in for a pound, you are.”
“I didn’t know you like to run,” said Potter, his gaze raking over Draco’s lanky form. Draco’s cheeks burned even brighter.
“I understand,” Draco said, his voice quiet but as gentle as he could make it. “Well, I don’t really understand, but I’ll try. It’s just a lot to process.”
Dinner was a splendid affair. The dining table had been magically extended to fit everyone, but even then people were right up against each other, knocking elbows as they reached for the overflow of food. It took Draco a minute to relax amidst the chaos, used to as he was a much more formal dining atmosphere. Harry put his arm around the back of Draco’s chair protectively, eating one-handed. Ginny, who was sat next to Harry with Luna on her other side, nudged him and leaned in to whisper, “You can ease up a bit, none of us are going to jinx him.”
“Depends,” Draco said, echoing Potter, who smirked. Draco’s lips twitched, maybe a smile. “Some nights, he’s killing me. Other nights, he’s killing everyone I love. And sometimes… sometimes he’s asking me to kill them.” He looked away, frowning at his arm on the balustrade. “Dumbledore offered me a way out, right here,” he whispered. “And Snape killed him. He did what I couldn’t. He killed my last chance to escape.” He could feel Potter’s gaze on him, almost as if he had reached out and put his hand on Draco’s shoulder. His gut twisted, wanting that simple reassuring touch, yearning for it. He pressed his nails harder against his palms, his knuckles growing white. “Stupid, isn’t it?” he said with a mirthless laugh. “To still be thinking about it, after all this time?”
Once on the train, it wasn’t hard to find an empty compartment. He put his luggage away and sat down, settling into his book. He had wiled away almost a full chapter as the train steadily filled, the growing chatter of students filtering down the hall, when his compartment door opened.
Harry bit his lip to try and stop grinning. “Good night, Draco,” he murmured. Things were about to get very interesting.
“I don’t care if it’s a long story, there shouldn’t be a story at all. You’re not here to gossip with your friends, Potter, you’re here to work.”
He never could get a good night’s sleep. Before the war, it was a constant gamble of whether or not his dreams would be his own, or if what he saw would be real. During, well. After, the nightmares haunted him, ghosts he couldn’t escape. He thought coming back to Hogwarts might help, a return to normalcy, but if anything, the thought only reminded him of everything he had lost.
Draco hummed to himself as he made his morning coffee the next day. Pansy raised a carefully plucked eyebrow as she ate her toast. Draco didn’t even make his usual comment of insisting that she wear more than a thin bathrobe to breakfast while he turned the wireless on, a little skip in his step as he picked out an apple to eat.
“Don’t jinx it, you idiot,” he muttered. “Just watch, someone will try to hex me before the night’s over.”
But then Draco was there, beaming at him. “You came!” he said, rushing towards him. Harry couldn’t help the smile that stretched across his face.
On Harry’s seventeenth birthday, his godparents presented him with a gift. Inside a plainly wrapped parcel was a folded cloak made of a fabric silky to the touch that looked like the surface of water rippling beneath the sun. When Harry pulled it about his shoulders, he yelped in shock and momentary horror – his body had disappeared before his eyes. Sirius and Remus laughed.
“Hey,” Harry interrupted him, scooting forward so that he sat on the edge of his chair, his knees brushing Draco’s bare ones where the bathrobe had fallen open. “Hey. Don’t be sorry about anything that happened last night. I – I wanted it to happen. Not like that, obviously, not after your father – but I’ve been wanting to kiss you for ages and just never knew until last night that that was what I wanted, does that make sense?”
Ron finally turned towards Harry, his brow furrowed. “I thought he would love the spotlight,” he said under his breath, waving a hand at the pomp and elegance around them. “Honestly, I’m surprised he’s still sat with us and not kissing up to some of the top brass here.”
Harry set the book down on the bed when he saw how worked up Draco was getting. He got up and crossed the room, placing his hands on Draco’s shoulders. Only then did he realise that Draco was shaking. He squeezed Draco’s shoulders.
Harry forced an understanding smile. “Yeah, of course. Listen, I have something I need to tell you two.”
“She knows I’m here?” Harry asked. Malfoy raised his eyebrows, his attention focused on his breakfast.
“Oh God, I’m going to come,” Harry warned him. Draco shrugged as if Harry had commented on the weather outside. He pulled Harry’s hand to his mouth.
“Alright!” Hermione shouted, waving her hands in front of her face as if to erase the image from her mind. “That’s enough from both of you. Jesus, I don’t even
Harry didn’t go out for coffee much. Between work at the Ministry and co-parenting Teddy with Andromeda, free time was scarce, and when he did go out it was for a drink at the pub with his friends. But it had been a few years since he and Ginny had split, and his friends wanted to play matchmaker. So here he was, standing in the queue to order coffee at a Muggle coffee shop, while his date sat a table by the window.
“Why do you waste your time thinking about that boy, Draco?” Blaise asked, cocking his head to one side. Draco blinked.
Robards stared up at the ceiling. “I mean,” he explained, still staring at what appeared to be a burn mark on the plaster, “that it would not be considered appropriate for you to discuss your, erm, lifestyle while you remain employed in the Ministry.” Only once he had gotten his words out did he look at Harry. Harry swallowed back the nausea rising in his throat, his tawny skin pale as Robards’ words sunk in. Robards sighed. “Do you understand what I’m saying, Potter?”
Harry stood, getting so close to Draco that their noses were inches apart. “Yes, I do,” he said, his voice firm. “I know because I have him in my head as well. I’ve seen you, Draco. I know you. All of you. And for all your mistakes and your flaws, I love you. For all the kindness and gentleness you have shown me over the years, I love you.”
“Well, I grew up with Muggles,” Harry began slowly. He spun his glass around in circles, not meeting Draco’s eyes. “My aunt and uncle, and their son, Dudley. I still talk to him every so often, but… well, things will never be great between us. Anyway, er, I never got on with my aunt and uncle, they didn’t like my parents, and didn’t much like me either. Loved their son, but not me. I was nothing like them.” His lips crooked into a half-hearted smile. “I look like my dad, so of course I didn’t fit in to their perfect white, middle-class life.” He gestured vaguely at himself, at his wild black curls and dark skin, at his small, slight build. Draco’s stomach twisted as he listened.
“Draco,” Harry interrupted him, leaning forward and cupping Draco’s cheek with one hand. “I love it. Thank you.” He kissed him, sweet and chaste, before pulling away and wiping his eyes with his sleeve. “This makes my gift look stupid in comparison,” he added in a low mumble, gesturing at the bag in front of Draco for him to open it and blushing slightly. Draco pressed his lips into a fine line as if to hold back a comment.
He made to try and struggle his way out of the couch. Harry’s hand shot out and held him back, his eyes wide and pleading.
“I didn’t see it happen,” he said quietly. “Not really. I had gone to the toilet, and when I came back, he had just cursed my mother – ”
It was cautious at first, neither quite believing it was real. Slowly, it deepened as Draco buried his hands in Harry’s curls and Harry put one hand on the nape of Draco’s neck, the other against his low back, pulling him in. Tongues and teeth and panting, gasping breaths were all they knew. Hands against skin, pushed up under shirts, desperate for more. They explored friction, the taste of each other’s skin, the small intimate sounds the other made. It was everything at once, and Harry thought he’d drown in it.
. Half the villages on this map no longer exist, and there are just as many that aren’t here at all.”
“If it was in the first war, then maybe they know who it was?” Draco asked, glancing up at Hermione who suddenly looked cagey, rubbing her fingertip along the edges of the book. He frowned. “Who was it?”
Draco let out a small breath of a laugh. “Yeah, it is, but it’s fine. Let’s try this again, shall we? What’s your name?”
has pictures of him at a Muggle gay club in Soho, but that might just be a rumour.” Draco tried to take a deep breath through his nose, but when he closed his eyes, he saw Harry – not the awkward sixteen year old, nor the haggard war hero, but Harry the man from the newspaper photographs, with his strong stubbled jaw and broad shoulders – dancing with some other nameless, faceless man in the depths of a shadowy nightclub. A storm churned in his stomach, which had settled somewhere in the vicinity of his shaking knees. He wanted to vomit, to cry, to laugh – but he kept his neutral mask in place. Pansy frowned, disappointed. She’s hoped to glean more from Draco’s reaction, but the only sign that he was bothered by her gossip was a slight sheen of sweat at his temples, and even that could be a trick of the light.
“Hermione’s right. I don’t want to believe it for Ginny’s sake, but…” Harry’s laugh was soft, broken. “I can’t say I’m surprised.”
“Well, shit, does this mean you’ll break up with me if I get you a bad gift? Birthdays are going to be nightmares.”
The old Black house had undergone major redecoration since Harry had moved in – gone was the dusty four-poster bed, the heavy velvet curtains, the peeling wallpaper. Instead, the room was painted a deep blue, the mahogany framed queen bed taking centre stage with its heather grey sheets, lit primarily by the tall window opposite the door. Draco only had a moment to take a look around before Harry pulled him back in, kissing him slow and deep. Nonetheless, he let Draco dictate the pace.
Harry chuckled darkly and looked down at his clenched fists. “Yeah, well, that’s not what happened. I broke his window, and then I got suspended.”
“Hey now.” Malfoy held up a warning finger. “I was doing just fine before you came along, thank you very much.”
“The green one was more festive, dear,” said the mirror wearily. Draco groaned and dug back through the pile of discarded clothes in front of the closet. “Are you sure” he asked, holding up the green jumper against the black one he was wearing. “I feel like it’s too on the nose.”
Draco looked up at that. “Does that mean – do I have to – can I go back to my flat, or should I stay here, still?”
“Oh shit,” Harry blurted out, cutting off Ron’s comparison of Fred Junior’s antics to sweet, perfect Rose. “Guys, I’m so sorry, I have to go. Actually, if you could send Kellen over for me – I’m so sorry, I’ve just had a breakthrough. Give little Rosie a kiss from me, and tell Molly I said hi and that once this is over I’ll take over babysitting duty again. But right now – ”
Harry nodded. “Fair, but still.” He sipped his tea, the memories flooding back as his mind woke up. “That couldn’t have been easy to deal with. I’m sorry.”
Silence descended in the sunroom. Harry swallowed hard. Draco and Narcissa glared at each other over the breakfast dishes, burning holes into each other. The tension mounted. Finally, Harry cleared his throat.
By the time he got to the top of the Astronomy Tower, he was even more sweaty and out of breath than he was when the match ended. He leaned against the doorway, gulping in deep lungful’s of fresh air as he tried to slow his racing heart. The tall figure standing braced against the parapet didn’t turn around. Breath caught, Harry said,
Mistress Figg also couldn’t tell him about his parents, and would only grow tight-lipped and feed him stale fruitcake when she saw the welts and burns on his hands. When he asked about his scar, she would sigh and tell him that, “we simply do not speak of these things.”
They didn’t say anything more about it. Ron’s father was getting older and needed all the help he could get on the farm, so Harry and Ron spent most of their days hauling in the harvest or sorting out the animals, milking the goats or feeding the chickens and so on. It was such a welcome relief from studying that for the first few days, Harry found himself pleasantly exhausted, mind clear and muscles sore from the work.
George looked more like a shell than a man. His usually sparkling blue eyes were sunk deep into his skull, his stubble uneven and only emphasizing the shadows of his cheeks. His copper-bright hair was dull and heavy. The grey uniform hung off his lanky form, the chains around his bony wrists rattling as he moved. They sat him down in the dock, locking him into the chair. His empty eyes roamed the crowd, and when they found Harry and Draco, a dark fire burned in that once jovial face. Draco looked straight ahead, but Harry bowed his head, unable to meet that accusing fire.
Teddy nodded. He didn’t meet Draco’s eyes. Draco pursed his lips. Then he waved his wand so that the rest of the salad ingredients could start preparing themselves – the cucumber slicing itself on the mandolin as the olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette poured themselves in equal measure into a jar – and came around to sit down next to Teddy.
That first night had been strange. The eighth years initially sat with the rest of their houses, the hall feeling incredibly empty without the usual hive of excited activity. Harry, sitting between Hermione and Neville, looked over at the far table. Only a handful of Slytherins had returned, most from the younger years, but one stood out. Draco Malfoy, as part of his sentencing, was back at Hogwarts.
Harry’s knuckles turned white as his grip on his book tightened. He heard Draco suck in a breath. The temperature in the room dropped several degrees in the space it took for Harry to hear him say over the roaring in his ears,
Draco laughed. “So I’ve been told. I was once given a pair of socks by an ex because he didn’t know what else I could possibly want or need. Needless to say, that relationship didn’t last long.”
“He wanted to reach out to you,” he continued, not knowing what was going to come next, “so many times over the years. But everyone told him it wasn’t a good idea, and he was so busy between becoming an Auror and helping rebuild Hogwarts and trying to keep his relationship together that he convinced himself that he shouldn’t, that you wouldn’t want to talk to him anyway. He married Ginny because he hoped it would save their relationship, because he loved her and didn’t want to lose her because he wasn’t
“So, tell me,” Harry said, his voice suddenly too loud, making him wince. “What do you do now? What have you been up to?”
“Ginny? Oh, no, they broke up last year or something, never even got to the altar. Skeeter tried to do a whole exposé on it, but Potter had it pulled, something about compromising their privacy and everything. Minnie told me all about it.” Minnie, Pansy’s girlfriend, was a news correspondent for the
Harry hummed. “I’ll be sure to make it as riveting as possible,” he assured him. “Although, there is one loose end that’s been bugging me. I’ll have to question you further, I’m afraid.”
It took less time than Harry thought for Malfoy to become Draco. It took longer for Draco to call him Harry.
“Fantastic. I just… I have to go do something. I’ll see you back in the common room, yeah?” He shrugged them off as best as he could. With a wave, he made his way off the pitch, taking only a moment to put away his broom and shove his change of clothes into his book bag.
“Because,” he began slowly, “to be honest, I had been hoping this compartment would be empty,” he added with a smirk. “But when I saw you, I thought, why not? I promised myself ages ago that the next time I saw you, I would try to start over, so to speak. So, what do you say?” He sat up, pulling his feet away so he was no longer fencing Draco in, and held out his hand. “Start over?”
Harry couched out a laugh that came out sounding more like a sob. “When did you get nice?” he asked thickly, sniffling. Draco chuckled.
They were at breakfast, chatting about the upcoming match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. Harry had come from an early morning training session with the Gryffindor Quidditch team – they barely had enough players, even with the first years they let join, and most of the practice was spent running simple drills to get them comfortable on their brooms. Still, Harry had worked up an appetite, and had already polished off a plate of eggs and streaky bacon and was eyeing the toast on Draco’s plate across from him. Draco noticed this and raised an eyebrow.
He took out the Map as he jogged up to the castle, searching it until he found the little dot up in the Astronomy Tower. His stomach did a somersault as he slowed just for a moment. Then he put the Map away and set off at a run.
“I know, but still.” Harry buried his face against Draco’s hair and sighed. “Do you want kids one day?” he asked, his voice quiet and soft. Draco shrugged, too tired and tipsy to be embarrassed.
Their first kiss was sloppy, forceful, with too much teeth. But slowly, it grew tender as they explored what the other liked. Draco’s hands buried themselves in Harry’s thick black curls, while Harry’s hands gripped his narrow hips, pulling him against him. Draco nipped at Harry’s bottom lip, making him gasp and moan as tongue followed teeth. Harry pulled Draco’s shirt out from his trousers so that he could run his hands up the bare skin of his back. Draco shivered against him. When he pulled away to kiss and suck love bites into Harry’s neck, he was rewarded not only with a throaty moan but with Harry’s hips grinding against him. They both gasped as they rutted up against each other, chasing friction. Harry’s shirt was gone, long ago tossed aside so that Draco could continue his trail of kisses down his chest, licking and sucking at each nipple in turn. Harry tried to unbutton Draco’s shirt, but he pulled away, shaking his head, something like fear in his lust-blown eyes.
Harry got out of the car, swinging his duffel bag over his shoulder as he followed Ron up to the house. “I’ve always been quiet,” he argued, trying to make his tone good-natured and nonchalant. Ron shook his head again – his flame-red hair needed a cut and stuck out at all angles like he’d never met a comb in his life, not unlike Harry’s own mop of wild curls.
He should have left Vincent and Greg outside the Room of Hidden Things. He shouldn’t have let them shadow him the way they’ve done all his life. Maybe, maybe, if he had told them the truth, Vince would still be alive. Or they would have abandoned him, maybe even killed him for the traitor he was.
He raised an eyebrow. “Scared, Malfoy?” he teased. Draco laughed and gave his boyfriend a quick, chaste kiss.
Draco sighed. He rolled his eyes, but Harry could tell his heart wasn’t in it. “Way to kill the mood, Potter,” he muttered. He sighed again and nodded. “You’re right, though.”
“Like what?” Draco asked. He sipped his water, his eyes narrowing at Harry over his glass. “You’ve been up to something, haven’t you? You had that long call yesterday and were being all cagey about it. Come on then, let’s hear it.”
“So we’re not going to have to move to France?” Harry asked with a teasing grin. Draco laughed and shook his head.
“Listen, the last time I tried that, I never got those trousers back. And my wand is in my pocket, I don’t want to risk it. Off.”
It was New Year’s Eve. Harry adjusted the cuffs of his dress robes over his button-down as he stepped into the hallway. “Draco,” he called up the stairs. “We have to go, we’re going to be late!”
“You would give Hermione a run for her money,” he said. “I haven’t had a lecture like that in ages.”
“I just can’t believe he led me on like that!” he said again after his second glass. Pansy refilled her cup, then emptied the rest of the bottle into Draco’s half-full glass.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco’s shoulders relax a little. Kellen said goodnight and, followed by Humphries back in human form, disappeared into the flames. The minute they were gone, Draco crumpled. Harry pulled him into his arms. The angle was awkward, and Harry doubted it was at all comfortable for Draco, but neither of them said a word. Draco pressed his forehead against the crook of Harry’s neck, his breath tickling the hollow of his throat. After a long silence, Draco whispered one word – “Arrangements.”
“Well, that’s not entirely true,” Harry pointed out. “This is a lot like a stakeout, really, like the one I did on the drug ring last year? I was gone a whole week that time.”
When Draco said nothing, Harry looked up at him, his green eyes wide, vulnerable and afraid. “Draco?” he said. “Please say something. Anything.”
“We’ll just be going, then. Lovely to meet you, I’m sure.” Without another word, he pulled Harry from the church, weaving their fingers together to better tug him out. He didn’t let go until they reached the baffle gate when Harry cleared his throat and glanced pointedly at their joined hands. Then he dropped Harry’s hand like it had personally offended him and strode off through the gate.
“Really?” Draco sneered, resuming chopping up the carrot on the cutting board. “You really think people will like a former Death Eater and the girl who wanted to turn Potter over to the Dark Lord showing up at their reunion party?”
“Good. Now go see Ms. Wallace for the forms. I’ll see you next week. And Potter?” he added as Harry stood and made to go. “I want you to know that if you weren’t the Chosen One, I would have fired you just then.”
“How was your day?” Harry asked, glancing at Draco just in time to see him look at Harry in surprise. Draco pursed his lips.
Draco pushed open the door to the pub at half past eight. The place had apparently been rented out for the event, the narrow Tudor-era building packed with his former classmates, half of which he barely recognised. The pub looked over the Thames, a balcony in the back with a set of steps leading down to the shoreline. Pansy saw him from her perch at the bar next to Blaise and waved him over. Draco rolled his shoulders back with a deep breath. One drink. He could do this.
They drove down the old dirt road towards the farm in the tiny car Ron had inherited from his brother Charlie who lived in Romania working on wildlife conservation. Ron had the windows rolled down, and the smell of warm grass and green earth blew through the car with the dry wind. Harry rested his arm on the open window, his hand hanging out and catching the air as they drove. For a while, it was quiet except for the sound of the radio.
Red. Red. Harry looked around again, more slowly this time. “Armchair. Scarf. Erm, jumper. Rug. Curtains.”
“Overheard it from one of my patients, an Auror that had gotten into a bit of a scrape. Her visitor was another Auror, McKinley or something like that. Anyway, she asked him why Potter couldn’t take over her case, and this McKinley or whatever said that Potter’s handed in his notice. Imagine my surprise!”
“What are you going to do?” Narcissa asked him, her tone pleading as she reached a hand out, trying to stop her son’s constant pacing, but he shrugged her off.
“It’s so nice,” Parkinson drawled, his greasy smile broadening, “to see you two become so close. But I guess it’s true what they say. Birds of a feather and all that.” He sneered at the two of them as he stood only a few feet away. “It makes our job a little easier then, doesn’t it?”
Draco just had to accept that his blush wasn’t going away. “Er, s-sure,” he stammered. “I wouldn’t want to impose though, if Ginevra’s home…” He and Ginny were never really able to see eye to eye, and their encounters were stand-offish at best. Besides, the last thing he wanted was to get in the middle of one of Potter and Ginny’s spectacular fights.
Harry came home from a long day at work, a heaviness in his limbs as he dragged himself through the Floo. He and now full Auror Kellen, no longer a Junior, were trying to piece together the case of a smuggling ring, the details of which were too horrid for Harry to talk about outside of the office. Draco was already in the kitchen making dinner. He had moved in the week before when the lease on his flat had ended, and if Harry had raised an eyebrow when Draco showed up with all his moving boxes, all Draco said was, “I’ve basically been living here, why pay rent for a flat I don’t even like?”
Harry tried to bury himself in Draco, his arms around Draco’s back as he held onto his shoulders, his leg wrapped around Draco’s hip. Draco sighed. He was just about to give up on getting an answer from him when he heard Harry whisper,
“Why ever not? She’s a good girl, and her family’s one of the sacred 28 – sure, she’s a little sickly, but Draco, what other possible objection could you have to this match?” Something dawned in Lucius’s face and he smiled, spreading his hands as if absolving a sinner. “If this is about finding a love match, I completely understand, but I don’t think you’ll find a better girl than Miss Greengrass. Besides, you can always find a mistress later.”
As they came into the atrium, however, it seemed that word had gotten round that Harry Potter had arrived, with Draco Malfoy. People turned to stare openly at them as they made their way around the room. In the corner of his eye, Harry saw Draco raise his chin a little. The proud tilt of his head was enough for a number of people to look away, but not all. Harry gave Draco an encouraging smile. Draco’s returning smile was tight, his silver eyes flashing as he leaned in and whispered in Harry’s ear, “Don’t you dare leave me for a second in this pit of vipers.”
“What, for asking him to accommodate my disability? No, no, I know what you meant, but you know I couldn’t resist. God, his face! Oh, boy, I promised Jackie I wouldn’t do that anymore, she gets so annoyed.”
Draco sat up, silencing Harry with a kiss. “Of course,” he murmured with a small smile against Harry’s lips. “I’d like that.”
“I will. And Harry?” Harry knelt back down and Ron gave him a stern look. “If he does anything funny, I’ll curse the git myself.”
Five minutes passed. Then ten. Draco began to get fidgety. More and more people filled the atrium, off to start their days. Some gave him strange looks, but most ignored him. Draco took out a Knut, flipped it with his thumb into the fountain, made a wish. A strange, panicked thought popped up in his mind – what if Harry had gone to get the other Aurors to arrest him? For what – he didn’t know, he’d been a law-abiding citizen since the war. He shook the thought off just as the lift doors opened and Harry came barrelling towards him. He all but bowled him over as Draco stood to greet him.
“Just… curious.” He downed the rest of his whiskey and stood, setting his glass on the window seat. “I’m off to bed. See you in the morning.”
“You can tell me anything, Draco. That is the point of the confessional. To confess and be forgiven.”
“And you just left a child on his own? Great parenting skills, Potter,” Draco sneered, but there was no malice in his voice. Harry chuckled and sipped his beer.
“Down in the kitchen, sir. He was very upset. We got his statement, I have it here, and there’s an officer down there with him, but he insisted that he carry on with his chores. I suspect he’s in shock, sir.”
“If you would desist disrobing me with your eyes,” he said, adding over Harry’s spluttering, “I’m not concealing anything, if that’s what you’re worried about. I’ve been perfectly law-abiding for the past five years, thank you very much.”
Harry frowned. He pressed a little more firmly against the scratch marks. “Why?” he whispered. Draco swallowed.
“Potter?” Draco asked, voice soft and unsure. He watched Harry’s Adam’s apple bob up and down as he swallowed. After hours of work, Draco smelled like too many coffees and sweat, and Harry didn’t smell much different, save the faintest traces of yesterday’s cologne, something smoky and spicy like whiskey.
They held each other close, their breaths mingling, chests pressed so close together they couldn’t tell whose heartbeat was whose. Then Harry ducked his head in for another kiss, slow and sweet at first as they explored, remembering the taste of each other on their tongues. Draco undid the buttons of Harry’s shirt, which Harry shrugged off without a thought, tossing it aside before setting on divesting Draco of his. Their kisses grew heated, their touches hungry. When Draco suggested they move to the bedroom, all Harry could do was nod.
Draco woke up sometime in the early morning, his ears ringing and his tongue tasting like Scorpius had left a dead moth in it. He was still wearing his clothes from the night before. He sighed and rolled off the bed. After he had brushed his teeth and stripped, he stood in the shower, hot water beating against his back as he leaned against the wall, his thoughts sluggish and painful. As he finally managed to soap up, an idea began to form in the back of his mind. By the time he’d dressed and started making his breakfast – espresso and toast – the idea had become a crazy, idiotic plan.
“You know what. Try to distance yourself. You do this. You lash out when people try to get close. You do it to Pansy when she asks how you’re doing, you do it to Hermione when she offers to help on cases, hell, you even do it to your mum when she visits. Don’t do it to me. We’ve hurt each other enough.” He took Draco’s chin in his hand, more gently than Draco expected, and forced him to look him in the eye. “Let me love you,” he said, enunciating each word, “you self-righteous, gorgeous bastard.”
Harry shook his head, chewing his lip. “You know I can’t tell you,” he whispered, his voice choked. He looked away, at Amelia on the dresser bathed in warm afternoon sunlight, trying to ground himself, to snap out of it – why was he bloody crying? In front of
Draco blinked several times. He opened his mouth, reconsidered, and closed it again. He hummed. “Right. Okay. That’s, erm. Right.” Draco bowed his head to hide the fact that his mind was starting to implode.
The eighth-year common room was small and cosy, hung with tapestries and portraits depicting themes from each of the four houses. A fire blazed in the fireplace, around which were arranged an eclectic mix of sofas and chairs. There were a couple of tables at which to study, and a wide window with a deep sill that overlooked the grounds. McGonagall explained that there were two sets of dormitories, two rooms for the girls and two for the boys, and that it was up to them how to split up the rooms. The nine girls had a more difficult time than the eight boys, if only numerically.
Draco turned back to his onions, but Harry still caught the soft smile he tried to hide. Harry grinned and shook his head. The knowledge that Draco was an absolute sap was Harry’s little secret. His heart soared as he hummed to himself, putting the slices of aubergine in a bowl for later. Draco raised an eyebrow, but Harry just beamed at him. He was too happy to explain.
“Find him,” she murmured. He nodded, his expression suddenly vulnerable and earnest – but only for a moment.
Draco chuckled. He knew it was an empty threat – Harry loved teaching his kids to fly too much to take away their brooms. He went back to slicing the tomato for the salad with a shake of his head. Teddy watched him in silence, his eyes distant as he stared at a point just above Draco’s hands. Draco waited. When Teddy was ready, he would talk.
“It’s… difficult,” he admitted. “I… I don’t know what to do, anymore. Where do I go from here?” He looked up at Potter, as if maybe, maybe this man who had been through so much worse than him, who had survived, would know, would understand. He looked up at Potter in desperate hope and asked, “What do I do now?”
Draco almost dropped his mug when pain pierced the fleshy part of his right palm – but that was why he was using two hands. He slammed the cup down on the counter and pushed open the window over the sink. “Just throw the damn gnomes, stop trying to hold them!” he hollered out into the cold.
He went to the only person he knew would have all the answers – Hermione. Harry stepped through the fireplace straight into her arms. Harry held her close, breathing in the smell of her floral perfume, magnolia and jasmine. She sat him down on the threadbare couch she and Ron had found on the side of the road, brought him a cup of strong tea and a plate of biscuits, the gingersnap ones he liked. He mumbled through his thanks, not entirely trusting his voice. Hermione just smiled and sat next to him, hands folded in her lap. There was a hole in the toe of her black stockings. Harry focused on that, knowing that if he looked Hermione in the eye, he would fall apart.
“Since when have you been into politics?” Harry teased. Ron’s blush turned the tips of his ears scarlet to match his hair. Harry laughed again.
Harry straightened up, wiping at his eyes as he muttered, “God damn it, Jamie.” He cleared his throat and said to Teddy, “I’ll be right back, but just know, I love you and support you whatever you decide to do. Let me just….”
“There you are,” he murmured. Draco rolled his eyes but ducked his head to hide the sappy smile spreading across his face. Harry gave him a quick peck on the cheek before leaning his head back against the headboard with a sigh. “It was just a really nasty nightmare,” he said finally. “Voldemort was killing everyone, but I was Petrified and trapped under the floorboards of the Shrieking Shack. I couldn’t move, couldn’t do anything.” Draco flinched at Voldemort’s name. Harry, noticing, gave him an apologetic look. “Then,” he continued in a hushed tone, “I looked up and there was the Dark Mark, hanging over me, and I knew I was next. I think that’s what set me off the second time, seeing your Mark.”
Next week, Harry and Hermione would present their case to the Wizengamot, but tonight was their first battle. Harry was taking Draco to the Ministry’s New Year’s Eve gala, not as a ‘friend’, but as his date. Which was probably why Draco had spent the past few days stressing over his outfit, and two hours getting ready.
Draco opened his mouth, closed it again. He couldn’t think with Potter looking at him like that. He stared straight ahead, his fingers picking at the cuffs of his jumper. “Why’d you decide to return my wand?” he asked, if only to change the subject. Potter shrugged.
His grip on the water bottle was loose as he made his way through the house he knew so well. He followed a service corridor up to the first floor that opened just outside of Draco’s room. He didn’t knock – he never knocked – as he slipped into the room, calling, “Draco? You here?”
“No, really,” Harry argued firmly. “He’s a good man. We’ve been talking almost every day since term started. This… whatever it is, it only started at the end of term. His father died, and….”
Down the road, Harry and Draco found a quiet alley and Disapparated back to Grimmauld Place. Once inside, Harry kicked off his shoes and buried himself against Draco’s chest. Surprised, Draco hesitated before wrapping his arms around him.
Kellen and Harry exchanged a look. “Well,” she said, “we’ll have to relocate you to a safe house and get a security team in place, for starters.”
“The young master,” he said, choosing his words with care, “had an argument with master, a few years ago now. Then, last Christmas, the young master visited, said he wanted to make amends, and master and mistress were so happy. Oh, Wilkins was overjoyed, sir. This was only the second time since then that he’s visited, sir – it was to be breakfast, then master and mistress were going to give the young master a couple of presents – a notebook from master and mistress had gotten him a lovely set of dress robes – and then they were going to walk about the grounds, just like they used to when young master was a boy, or so Wilkins has been told, Wilkins was not with the family then.”
“So violent.” Draco sighed as he scrubbed a hand over his face. He still couldn’t look at Harry, whose expression had gone from shock to a thunderous anger, the weight of his gaze heavy on Draco’s shoulders. “I wanted – I wanted to know if it could be done,” he said slowly. He gestured vaguely, his other arm wrapped around his waist as he slumped in his chair. “I – after everything with Ginevra – I hate to think that you don’t have a choice in this, in who you’re stuck with for the rest of your life, unable to fall in love or get married to anybody else. I just – wanted to give you the option.”
“Surely there’s another empty compartment somewhere,” Draco drawled, leaning his head back against the seat as he looked the young man up and down. “Or I’m sure any of your fans would be happy for you to sit with them. Where’s Granger and Weasel? Or better, the Weaselette? They must be saving a seat for you somewhere.”
Dean won twenty Galleons that night. He and Neville had been playing a game of wizard chess when Harry and Draco stepped through the portrait hole holding hands. When Dean saw their blushing, beaming faces, he clambered onto his chair and announced to the crowded common room, “Pay up, lads!”
Draco sat at his makeshift desk by the window surrounded by an organised chaos of books, papers and quills. He looked over his shoulder, one eyebrow raised as Harry came in and shut the door behind him. Draco turned in his seat, the crease settling between his brows as he frowned. “What is it? Has something happened?” he asked, his voice tinged with concern. “Was there another attack? Are Granger and Weasley okay?”
“You really think your team is going to protect you, f*****? I bet none of them want to share a locker room with a pouf like you,” Parkinson sneered. Draco, fists clenched, took a step forward, but Harry grabbed his arm and pulled him back.
When they finally pulled apart, leaning their foreheads together, not quite wanting it to end, their breath was ragged, their chests rising and falling against each other. Draco searched Harry’s face, one of his hands disentangling from Harry’s hair to ghost his fingertips against cheekbones, the line of his jaw, the curve of his neck. Harry shivered at the touch.
“Yes,” he admitted. “But I don’t live with my parents. I haven’t in two years, and trust me, there are no house elves in my flat, just ask Pansy. Yes, Parkinson – she’s my flatmate, she took me in after my parents evicted me.”
“Could you, er, could you face me when you talk?” Kellen piped up. Malfoy turned back to her, one eyebrow raised. She pointed at her ear. “I’m Deaf and my hearing aids aren’t the greatest at picking up every word.”
Draco hated running. His feet hurt, his knees hurt, his chest hurt, everything hurt. But it was halfway through January and the only progress he had made on his resolution to exercise more was to buy some new work out clothes. So, that morning, he’d screwed himself up and went for a run. Or, he tried to. It was more of a painful jog down the pavement at this point. He stumbled to a stop in the middle of a small park, hands on his low back as he looked up at the grey London sky, the freezing winter air burning in his lungs. Good lord, he was out of shape. He closed his eyes as he tried to catch his breath, wishing he had taken Blaise’s offer to spend a week in the Zabini villa outside of Turin, drinking wine and basking in the Italian sun. In his mind, it was always summer in Italy.
By the time the security team and Kellen had left, it was late in the evening. Harry, not having eaten much for lunch besides Malfoy’s toast, was starving. He set about cooking a simply curry while Malfoy unpacked upstairs. Harry found it oddly reassuring to hear the movement of another person in the quiet old house. He often missed having Teddy around, filling the house with sparkling laughter and excited chatter. But this was something else, as if without realising, something had been missing, only for Harry to find it in the sound of Malfoy’s footsteps on the creaking floorboards.
“It’s not – it’s just – it’s the principal of the matter.” Malfoy looked up at the ceiling, trying to collect himself. Harry relaxed his grip a bit – he could feel Malfoy’s pulse race against his fingertips, the sensation alone making his stomach flip. Malfoy swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. Finally, he looked back down at Harry. “Just that moment, right? Nothing else from that day?”
“I know,” Harry said, even as he took off his jacket and hung it up on the coat rack, knelt down to unlace and take off his boots, just like it was just another normal date. His smile was nervous, though, when he turned back to Draco. He took his glasses off to clean them with the hem of his shirt, and that’s when Draco saw the dark, heavy shadows under those summer green eyes. Draco turned away and stalked off to the living room, knowing without looking that Harry would follow.
It was a long time before Draco finished talking. They paused only briefly when one of the kitchen house elves arrived, carrying a tray of sandwiches and small plates. When she was gone, Harry grabbed one of the sandwiches with a free hand and proceeded to devour it. He hadn’t realised how hungry he was until that moment. Draco watched him with hint of a smirk at the corner of his mouth.
Blaise blinked and looked up, shaken from his thoughts. “We were on our way back to my family’s tent after the match,” he said, passing a hand through his rich brown hair. “But when he saw David, my cousin just froze on the spot. It was the first time I’d seen him in person – David, that is. Tall and fit, he has the kind of face that would make any girl swoon. Really,” he insisted when Draco scoffed, “the minute I saw him, I hated him, because he made the rest of us look like peasants, even us Purebloods. Oh, yeah, David’s half-blood – Muggle mum, I think. Anyway, so there we were, my cousin just stood there like he’d seen a Basilisk. David saw us and just nodded at my cousin, bold as brass, and went back to his conversation like he barely knew my cousin at all. My cousin went all scarlet, and I saw him grit his teeth like he was gearing up for a fight.
Another hour later, long after he and Kellen had gone over the previous evening’s events, Harry heard footsteps on the stairs. He got up and started boiling more water for the coffee while Kellen stood up to stretch. She had taken off her robes, too warm in the summer morning light pouring through the kitchen window, and was wearing a simple knee-length skirt and gauzy blouse with a black bowtie, looking more like a 1950s office worker than an Auror. She put the papers back in the file, setting the notepad on top, ready to take Malfoy’s statement.
“I said I was bringing a guest,” Draco pointed out, blushing furiously. “We brought gifts,” he added, raising the presents like a peace offering out to his mother. Narcissa took the gifts suspiciously, but stepped aside to let them in. Draco’s shoulders slumped in relief, and he bounded inside, giving his mother a quick kiss on the cheek as he passed. Harry followed, hands in his pockets, and glanced nervously at Narcissa, who pursed her lips.
“You know,” Harry said, his voice rough. He cleared his throat and continued, “At some point in time, we are going to have to talk about this.”
Harry shrugged. A week ago, the idea would have been a nightmare, but now, in a surreal moment of clarity, he knew this was the right thing to do. Kellen blinked several times, processing everything. Malfoy was watching him with that indecipherable look on his pointed face.
“Hallowe’en.” Draco’s voice was small, vulnerable, as he watched Harry with tears he refused to shed. “I’m always a bit more solid on Hallowe’en.”
Potter gave him a wry smile, his eyes sparkling behind his glasses. “Not today,” he said, his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket, pulling it in tight to his waist. “But I do come bringing gifts.” He pulled out Draco’s wand, spun it between his fingers before handing it over, handle first, to Draco. “Sorry it took so long.”
Draco snorted. Harry was looking their way pleadingly, hands raised in surrender at his opponent, who had launched into a lecture on gratitude and respecting one’s elders. “I know he’s no idol,” he muttered to Father Nicola. “I went to school with him. And it’s not him exactly I believe in.”
They sat across from each other at the long wooden table, a map spread out between them, the parchment crackling as the king swept his well-manicured fingers across the outline of his kingdom. Harry frowned as he listened to the king describe the attacks – reports of Elves going missing, especially children, bodies only occasionally reappearing, twisted and deformed. There was something odd about the map, Harry thought.
“No,” Harry said immediately. “No, absolutely not. It’s a lot to process, but we don’t think you’re crazy. Right, Draco?”
. Harry blinked, trying to take it all in. The very air smelled of jasmine, the flowering vines winding their way up the stone pillars, inching their way towards that impossible sky.
They walked down the hallway in silence. They passed the drawing room, and Harry caught a glimpse of the crystal chandelier, the dark purple walls and ornate marble fireplace over which hung a great gilded mirror. Harry shuddered, the memory of Bellatrix Lestrange carving ‘Mudblood’ into Hermione’s arm flashing through his mind, the sound of her screams and Ron’s protests ringing in his ears from all those years ago. He closed his eyes, trying to force himself to stay in the moment, for the vision to stop there. His head ached as it remembered the splitting pain in his scar, and behind his closed lids he could see Dobby’s shaking form as he stood up to the family he had served, ‘
“After the war, I was acquitted of any war crimes thanks to Harry’s testimony, much to my surprise, but my father was not. Even though I was acquitted, no one wanted anything to do with our family. We were tainted. No one would hire an ex-Death Eater. I tried – I got my qualifications, I applied everywhere, and everywhere turned me down. It was just me and my mother in this old house, haunted by our mistakes and the atrocities the Dark Lord committed here. There was no escaping from everything I and my family had done. I was trapped.
Harry rolled his eyes and grinned. He rolled up onto the balls of his feet to press a lingering kiss to Draco’s lips, tasting his own mint toothpaste in Draco’s mouth. He tried to deepen the kiss, but Draco pulled away with a laugh.
