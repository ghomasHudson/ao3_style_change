“How would you know?” Pansy cackled as Harry and Draco both rolled their eyes. “Yes, moist is good, fantastic in fact.” She winked at Ginny.
“That’s all for now. Are you sure you can handle things while I’m away?” Draco always worried when he wasn’t there to control everything, so didn’t often take time off. However, he knew Joshua was perfectly capable of handling business for two weeks.
“Lucky them” Harry licked his lips.
Draco woke up slowly, first becoming aware of the clean linen smell of the pillow his face was smushed into, then the sound of the shower running, finally the scratchy feeling in his eyes and the pounding of his head. It had been a good night; his worries had been for nothing and seeing Harry again for the first time in months had been a balm for his tired soul.
“What is that supposed to mean?” Draco frowned at her.
Harry followed Draco back to the table, trying to keep his eyes off his arse, but finding the back of his head equally tempting. He had a strong urge to tangle his hands in that long silvery hair. Once again shaking away his traitorous thoughts, Harry made a concerted effort to focus on his role as games master for the rest of the evening, ending up with a pocket full of sickles and a pleasant tipsiness as the group said their goodnights.
“But dad-”
“Ugh tell me about it. He’s been a right prick lately,” Ginny grumbled.
After walking Harry back to his studio and picking his brain about the work in the gallery, Draco said his goodbyes and agreed to call Harry later that night. He went back to Ginny and Pansy’s flat and spent the remainder of the afternoon frantically working through some design ideas of his own, inspired by what he had seen in the gallery. That evening while he was swept up with wedding business, he allowed his mind to consider what it would be like to move back to London. It was never a topic he ever let himself think about, with the very real fear that returning would be dangerous. So many years after the war it didn’t feel so frightening, and after a beautiful afternoon spent with Harry on Diagon Alley, Draco couldn’t help but think he might be ready to come home.
“It’s from that muggle film, American Pie. It means Mum I’d Like to Fuck. So DILF is-”
“After dinner. We’ll play four a side or something,” Ginny replied. “Might blow away the hangover.”
Draco followed Pansy and Ginny into the pub, taking in its bright, sunlit atmosphere. It was a busy Saturday night, full of muggles making the most of the evening sunshine. A waitress guided them to their large table in the beer garden, the other patrons eyeing their prime spot enviously. They were the first here, as Pansy had wanted to ensure everything was in order before the rest arrived. Unofficially it was a celebration for Ginny’s birthday; with the wedding so close they hadn’t wanted anything too ostentatious. Tea-lights and potted succulents adorned the rough wooden table, interspersed with bottles of red and white wine. It was simple and elegant, and Draco felt a pang at everything he was missing out on by living so far away.
Pansy smirked as she returned his gaze. “Well I have to make the effort when my best friend is a bloody fashion master.”
When he returned Draco was perusing one of Harry’s favourite possessions - the vinyl collection he inherited from Sirius. Draco selected a record and put it on the turntable before sitting back down. Harry smiled as the opening bars of a favourite song played out. Glancing at Draco he saw he had relaxed into the couch, a soft smile on his face as he quietly sang along.
The two men moved to the comfort of the living room, with a nightcap of Ogden’s in hand. Harry groaned as he sat down on the sofa, rubbing his sore hip to try and ease the ache from a full day on his feet.
“Excuse me you wretch, my conquests are actually extremely fortunate,” replied Draco,
After sampling a blushing bride, monster-in-law and four groomsmen of the apocalypse, the three of them headed out to The Wander Inn.
Games master Ginny squealed, “One sickle for that dreadful potty mouth darling,” before planting a kiss on her fiancé’s lips. Harry held his hand out for Pansy to deposit a sickle in before he started the first of many stacks of coins in front of him.
“Well that explains the shrieking.” Draco raised an eyebrow as Ginny huffed out a sheepish laugh. “I would love to imbibe with you, but have I time for a shower first?”
Then there was Harry. Potter was Draco’s guilty pleasure, their frequent interactions decorating his grey world with sparks of pure joy. The reason Joshua thought that Harry was Draco’s
: his thoughts were treacherous. Everything about this interaction was doing something to Draco, who saw himself getting hard before this call was over.
They all groaned at that one, Ginny giggling and clutching her stomach as Pansy grabbed onto her shoulder and cackled.
“Please stop talking,” begged James, trying a more polite tactic. Lavender ignored him, and continued rambling on about the latest sex scandal the Minister for Transport was embroiled in.
“Oh. That. I’m not sure where it is to be honest. Somewhere in my bedroom maybe?” Harry shrugged then returned to chopping vegetables. Draco stared at him for a moment, trying to comprehend that statement and Harry playing down his tremendous skill. Harry turned to face him; head cocked enquiringly. Draco shook his head in return and went to pour a glass of wine for himself, Pansy and Ginny.
P.s. I am embelini on insta if you'd like to say hello
Draco bombarded Harry with questions about the glassblowing demonstration he had witnessed while they waited for their starters of green mango salad and fresh spring rolls. The food was exquisite, and so was the company, the back and forth demonstrative of their ease in each other’s company. True to Harry's word, Draco was completely safe from confrontation during their outing, with Harry such a regular face on Diagon Alley that the shoppers barely spared him a second glance. Draco relaxed as their meal progressed, revelling in the company of the man who knew him so well, and could match him both in intellect and friendly verbal sparring.
Lavender huffed out a bitter laugh before turning narrowed eyes on James. “Actually Jamie, if that were the case, I’d put out a lovely double page spread on what a fuck up the precious war baby is WOULDN’T I?” voice rising as she went on.
“Well that was awkward.” chimed in George, “Personally I have always enjoyed Lavender’s unique brand of reporting. That last one on you was inspired Harry, even if you are a sad middle-aged pouf. What was it she called you?”
Before Draco could respond, Harry gently took the bottle from him, gave it a look of concentration, then made a pulling gesture with his hand over the top of the bottle. The cork came loose, and Harry caught it before passing both back to Draco.
Harry grinned down at her and took something out of his pocket with his spare hand. He gestured at it and it slowly grew in size. He passed Ginny the bubble wrapped parcel with a peck on the cheek, wishing her a happy birthday. He took the seat opposite Draco as she unwrapped the present, nodding his greetings at the rest of the guests. She gasped as a glass sculpture of two naked women, face to face in an embrace, and pulsing with an ethereal light was revealed.
Draco kissed the top of her head before asking, “So what is the itinerary for this delightful adventure?”
“Oh, I know, Ginny’s a fucking snack but can you imagine how much of a nightmare her mother has been, planning this wedding.” Pansy rolled her eyes with an exaggerated sigh.
James’ face was flushed a deep red, and he seemed unable to tear his eyes away from the carpet. “I’ll apologise to Aunty Lav. I should have spoken to you sooner. I’m sorry for embarrassing you at nan’s house too. Shall I send nan a card?”
++++++++++++++
” Ginny rolled her eyes as she mimed air quotes.
“You nearly died as it was Potter,” shot Draco sharply.
He knew he was only worrying this much over his appearance because Draco would be there, and Harry felt completely inadequate next to him. Draco had become as famous (or infamous) in the muggle world as Harry was in the wizarding one. Although Harry spoke with Draco most days, that was not face to face. Being confronted with the blonde in real life made Harry nervous, especially considering the increasing frequency of their video chats whilst one or the other was in bed. Draco in crisp white sheets, vulnerable and sleepy with bed head, was a special kind of delicious torture for Harry. It had always been platonic, and Harry treasured the friendship and the easy way he could now talk to Draco about anything. What he struggled to ignore was the insistent buzzing in his head that he wanted more. He wanted it all with Draco, but he knew he couldn’t measure up and would never get the relationship he was so desperate for. It hadn’t helped when Pansy had gleefully plonked Vogue magazine in front of him last week, open on the double page spread of a topless Draco Black, tight black jeans clinging to his hips, tattoos adorning his thin, pale arms. He looked more a model than designer, with cheek bones that would cut glass. He held his head back, elongating his elegant throat, pale hair cascading over his shoulders. Harry’s breath had hitched at the sight of him, to which Pansy gleefully smirked, “Fucking fit isn’t he?” laughing at Harry’s mumbled, “If you like that sort of thing.”
“At least he’s flying again,” observed Ginny. James had been kicked off his house Quidditch team last term, for not turning up to training and simply having a poor attitude. He was putting in as little work as possible in all aspects of his schooling which was difficult for the family to understand. Fred and George hadn’t excelled at school, but they had at least built an empire while there. James had little interest in anything lately.
“Salazar Potter, you sound like a drunk farmer. Or a pirate,” teased Draco, unable to keep the laughter from his voice. His eyes softened as he smiled fondly at his friend.
“I cannot even bear thinking about it Pans. You look amazing by the way; domestic bliss obviously suits you.” Draco raised his eyebrows as he appraised Pansy’s sleek black bob, dark sunglasses, and green jumpsuit.
“You just jump in a fire and tell it where you want to go? Deathwish, much?”
Lunch at the burrow was a reasonably sedate affair, by Weasley standards. Harry showed up early to relieve Andromeda of his son, in a pair of faded jeans and a loose black band t-shirt he’d picked up at the Blossoms gig he’d taken the boys to last month. He made his way into the kitchen to give Molly a squeeze and offer his help and headed out into the garden when she declined his assistance. Although Molly had been disappointed that her daughter and Harry had never really made a go of their relationship, she still treated him like a son and he affectionately referred to her as “Mother Weasley”. James had barely grunted in his direction since he’d arrived, preferring to sit out on the grass with Ted, listening to what sounded like the Beastie Boys and messing around on their phones. Arthur and George had managed to set up a magic dead-zone surrounding the shed so Arthur could get his muggle contraptions to work, and the boys had soon cottoned on that they could use their tech in a certain spot. The others all got the same treatment when they turned up, many in sunglasses and groaning at loud noises. Teddy was polite enough to come over and shake Draco’s hand when he arrived with the girls, turquoise hair hanging down around his shoulders. James hung back behind, muttering a sullen “alright?” in Draco’s direction before he and Teddy decided to go for a fly. Harry, Draco and Ginny stood and watched them swoop around for a while, as Pansy went to get them all a drink.
++++++++++++++
It made Harry uncomfortable when Draco mentioned him picking up men. So many times, he had come close to telling him that the only man he wanted was Draco, particularly if he’d been drinking. He enjoyed their text exchanges, which usually ranged between silly and sarcastic, but he loved it when Draco phoned him infinitely more. When they were on the phone, they dropped the bravado and sarcasm and Harry got to see the sweet and vulnerable side of Draco that he had inadvertently fallen for. Their late-night calls, which had lately become video calls, adding an extra layer of delight for Harry, covered all the serious topics from the past, present and future; things Harry never spoke to anyone else about. He suspected this was the same for Draco. With everything that had happened between them, having seen both the best and worst of each other, there was nothing left for them to hide behind. Harry often lay there in the middle of the night, having hushed conversations with Draco about his worries with James, his business, his bouts of insomnia and panic attacks, the PTSD which had faded significantly but he would never be completely free from. Some things Harry never talked about were relationships, loneliness, or his desire for more children. Those things he guarded more closely than anything else, as they were all wrapped up in his hope that Draco would one day come to love him back.
“Hey boss,” answered the keen 21 year old, a New York twang purposefully colouring his Boston accent.
“Glad you didn’t, I’ve missed you.” Harry’s crinkled eyes glittered.
“Pretty cool, huh,” replied Harry with a grin. “There’s nothing like working with molten glass. Sorry I couldn’t be there when you got here, I was at a crucial stage and couldn’t risk losing the whole thing. It just takes a bit too much cooling for the piece to crack and become useless. We’ve had a challenging few days trying to get that one in the kiln.”
The group groaned as Harry chuckled and stated that was fair. “What bingos then love?” he asked Ginny.
concerning. Pansy reminded him they were leaving early for bridesmaid dress shopping so he shouldn’t stay out too late. Draco made a horrified face to Harry when she turned to leave. He had hoped they might have finished more of the wedding preparations before his trip, however they had decided that as the designer, he should be the one with creative control. He had attempted to remind them that Harry was a bloody artist and should have been helping them the whole time. Apparently, Harry’s good taste did not extend to fashion or table settings, so Draco was stuck with the lot.
“It’ll be fine Draco, we are all one big happy family nowadays. I promise there will be no trouble or war talk. You’ve seen us all since then any way. It’ll be lovely, honestly. Plus they’re all on their best behaviour for the duration. The only one more terrifying in their rage than me is Ginny fucking Weasley. No one is going to wreck our wedding.”
“Thank you,” Draco replied, ignoring the slight, and grabbing his wand and bags before rushing through the exit to Pansy. The sooner they got back into muggle territory the better, as far as Draco was concerned. Pansy and Draco wrapped their arms around each other, squeezing each other tightly and giggling as they broke apart.
“It’s like looking back in time.” Draco observed, needlessly pointing out that James was the spitting image of his father.
“That was it.” Draco smirked. “I’m half pissed already, thought I had better pace myself if this is to continue for two more weeks.”
Harry cleared his throat and reluctantly pulled away before he continued, “Sorry about that. I know she would never have given him up by that point, but that’s just where my head was at.
As they entered the flat, Draco found himself tackled by an enthusiastic ginger female, squealing as she wrapped herself around him. “Draco I’m so happy you’re finally here! Pansy’s been a fucking nightmare waiting for you,” she shrieked.
If his mother notices his shaking hands, she doesn't comment on it.
“Oh, Draco,” she says gently, holding him tight against her body. “I’m terribly sorry darling.”
The wall opens up, revealing a door, and they disappear inside it. Draco rushes forwards and enters, Crabbe and Goyle following him. Draco walks through the familiar mazes of cluttered objects, stacked high upon one another.
He thinks of Harry,
“Thank you,” Draco says earnestly. The lump in his throat presses painfully against his windpipe as the reality of the situation settles over him, and this time, his vision blurs as tears cloud his eyes. He looks down at his feet and blinks rapidly, clenching his trembling hands into fists by his side.
Pansy is sorry for him, Draco realises, because she would never lie about something like this. No matter how unkind she may be at times, she would never do something so cruel.
“I knew you would never let me,” Draco says. “You were always too stubborn for your own good.”
In his peripheral vision, Draco sees them begin to walk away, and the knot in his chest eases slightly.
Draco turns back to his essay, staring down at the roll of parchment blankly. The words stare back at him in a muddle of letters. Draco shivers again, and only when he reaches for his quill does he realise he’s shaking, not shivering from the sudden cold.
He stares unseeingly out of the windows, towards the Great Lake. He sees a flash of blue-green glinting in the water, but it disappears as soon as its come. It’s the mermaids, and Draco watches the water ripple across his window.
“Yes,” Draco says, and his voice sounds distant and odd, like it doesn't belong to him, like Draco is in someone else's body. “Yes, I’m alright,” he manages hoarsely, because he doesn’t want her worrying over him. Neither does he feel like talking about this.
To his dismay, he utters an Unforgivable, his mind muddled with fear. But the words do not get a chance to leave his mouth, and Harry fires an unfamiliar spell at him, as a blinding streak of white light hurtles towards him.
“I would’ve appreciated it if I had a say in it,” Harry says defiantly, his bottom lip jutting out and Draco feels like laughing. He gives Harry a small smile.
It’s Harry. He knows it’s Harry even before he begins talking again. This section of the library is secluded away from the smattering of students spread across the library.
Draco thrusts the piece of paper towards her, and she takes it hesitantly. When she reads the spell written on it, her eyebrows draw together in confusion. She looks up at Draco and back down to the piece of parchment, and he watches as realisation dawns upon her.
The dark circles under his eyes, however, makes the hard lines of his face more prominent than usual. He looks exhausted, Draco thinks idly, like he hasn’t slept in weeks.
In his free period before lunch, Draco goes to the library instead of the Room of Requirement.
“It’s a very risky charm,” she says, trying to get Draco to reconsider. But Draco has made up his mind, had for weeks ever since Harry had told him about the visions.
Nott’s father sees Draco, and he advances towards him with the beginnings of the killing curse forming around his lips. Draco stuns and hexes him, sending him crashing down next to his son.
Draco watches him from across the Great Hall. He’s laughing at something that Weasley has said when a Hufflepuff girl taps his shoulder.
The war rages on.
that Snape had seen yesterday. He must have been under his invisibility cloak.
Draco looks at her, and sees the way she’s sitting up straight uncomfortably, the way she looks as though she is in pain. It reminds him of Granger, all those months ago, when she had caught him listening in to their conversation.
Under the silver rays of moonlight, Draco holds Harry in his arms.
Draco screams, and tries to find his wand from where it had rolled away from him. Draco locates his wand, and by the time he turns around to stun Crabbe, he’s already running away.
“You do Draco,” he says calmly. “Or else you would not have done what you did last year, to protect your beloved.”
“Draco,” a familiar yet hoarse voice exclaims, and Draco freezes where he stands. His parents turn to him in surprise. His mother nods at him, letting Draco’s hand fall from hers as she turns to walk away, tugging his father along with her.
“What?” He asks, and Pansy worries her lip between her teeth, still avoiding his gaze. “What is it? Has something happened?”
Draco finds himself in an empty bathroom on the sixth-floor corridor, with only moaning Myrtle as lousy company.
Draco’s gaze flits across to the person beside them, and sees that Harry is grinning at girl Weasley. He feels far too hot, suddenly.
And then, he’s gone, leaving Draco alone once again.
The answer claws itself out through the empty corners of Draco’s heart, and he tries to swallow them down. But he’s tired. He’s so tired of running from himself and pretending he doesn’t love Harry. Pretending he still isn’t in love with Harry. There’s no reason for him to hide anymore.
When he wakes up, the first thing he sees is the ceiling of the infirmary. His limbs ache, and there is still the faint sting of the wounds across his chest.
Greyback sees him, and his eyes narrow in disgust, before raising his wand. Draco stuns him just as a killing curse hits him from another direction.
“You do it then,” she bites back. “I don’t want to do this to Harry.”
“Come,” he says, turning around abruptly and walking away with his robes gliding behind him. Draco follows reluctantly, biting down a scowl.
He walks in with Weasley and Granger in tow, and they both freeze when they see him. Harry, however, narrows his eyes at Draco in suspicion, and Draco stares at him with his heart trying to beat out of his chest and into Harry’s hands.
Harry is no longer
Everything hurts so terribly, and every inch of his skin burns. Draco’s screams smother themselves as he feels himself slipping through the cracks of his mind. He can not fight any longer.
“…..I can help you Draco,” Dumbledore says, and Draco’s attention focuses back on the man in front of him.
He hasn’t been for a while, but now Draco is forced to accept the cold, hard truth.
Draco lives with fear having seeped into his bones, and every step he takes feels like the last one.
With one arm holding Goyle, Draco reaches his other one up towards Harry. It slips right through Harry’s and Draco almost cries. Then, Weasely and Granger are flying towards them, taking Goyle from Draco’s arms and perching him on their broom.
He feels trapped, like a cornered animal, and suddenly the library is far too small. He feels far too exposed without Blaise and Pansy standing on either side of him protectively.
He takes Draco to his potions storeroom, and inspects the shelves for a dreamless potion. Draco stands by the door stiffly, ready to flee at a moment's notice.
Red eyes hiss down at him.
Vaguely, he thinks about this father in Azkaban, but he can not bring himself to care, not when the boy he loves will no longer care about him in a matter of a few hours.
His father comes to stand on his other side, and his mother grasps Draco’s upper arm in a firm hold.
“I think I'll always love you,” Draco admits.
Draco sees him in Madam Malkins.
He hears someone scream, a blood-curdling scream that makes his stomach drop. It’s McGonagall. Then, several other voices are screaming, shouting Harry's name into the cold air, and yelling at the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters.
Draco splashes cold water onto his face, and draws in a shaky breath looking at his reflection in the mirror.
His blond hair hangs around his eyes limply, the gloss that had once glistened his hair, now lost. There are dark circles under his eyes, and his skin looks pale and clammy. He looks awful, and if his mother were to see him now, she may cry.
Narcissa frowned. “When did I become Mrs. Malfoy? You called me Narcissa before.”
He grinned as her eyes cleared, then lit up with delight. “Excellent. I don’t think I would have had it in me to do that again anyway.”
The older of the two children was probably around six years old. He was clutching his sister’s shoulders, stoically silent, and glaring at the Malfoys with hatred in his eyes. Hatred and anger, but surprisingly no fear. That adamant look — it looked like Potter. Even if he could cast the killing curse, Draco didn’t think he would be able to kill this one.
“So you talked to Luna, and now you want to go to Hogwarts.” Hermione stated flatly.
— Fleur knew more spells, more techniques, and had had a lot more practice — but Ginny made up for it in sheer savagery. More than once, she’d cast a mild
“One of
“I brought you some bread and butter,” Harry said, conjuring a plate and knife and levitating them over with the bread and butter.
“We don’t even know what it is!” Harry replied.
She immediately snatched it up, skim reading it by the fire for about ten seconds before triumphantly saying “He’s shagging Malfoy.”
He sprinted across the grassy park, thanking his good luck, as every time he felt the need to turn around to check a spell was flying towards him with just enough time to deflect or dodge them.
Harry asked, looking at Draco shyly from under his eyelashes.
“Voldemort comes first. We are going to Malfoy Manor, and we are going to kill that bastard.” Harry was surprised at how authoritative his voice was, but at least everyone listened to him.
“Didn’t see you guys at dinner,” Ron said, an eyebrow raised and a lopsided smirk on his face.
“No need to be scared, Potter, now drink this.” Harry tore his eyes from Malfoy to see Snape, looking greasy but…concerned?
The news that Harry and Draco were now a couple spread like wildfire, whispers following the couple through corridors and knowing smiles being directed at them during lessons. Flitwick had been especially delighted with them during charms the next day, giving them twice the usual number (which was already high) of smiles, and house points for no apparent reason (“10 points to Slytherin for picking up your quill! 15 points to Gryffindor for doing your tie correctly!”
Away from the bustle of Hogwarts, Severus would have expected to feel alone, with long hours in the potions room in the basement, but somehow, he felt less alone than he had in years. Grimmauld was now a family, and Severus couldn’t fight the warm feeling when someone called him upstairs to lunch, as if they
them. But all rational thoughts left his mind when he caught the scent of dark magic and death.
Harry continued to grind up the egg while Draco cut up the horseradish, then moved it all to one side and started on the murtlap.
Not for the first time that day, Severus traced his dark mark over his robes. This afternoon, that skin would be unblemished.
Perhaps
Remus frowned — what was this about? He’d recounted his story in the dining room — he’d seen Death, who’d informed him of things, and then he’d been essentially booted out of the afterlife and woken up in the forest.
Thank you for reading!
Voldemort sat at his chair, which wasn’t nearly grand enough — but apparently Lucius didn’t have anything better. A
Still, she’d found herself in no danger, so continued to reside in the manor.
Severus sat down at the table as Kreacher emerged from the kitchen, levitating several plates filled with a full roast beef dinner behind him. Severus talked as Kreacher put all the plates and cutlery on the table. “It was slow going at first, as we established a system, but now we’re going through a county or two a day. Most of the muggleborns chose to leave, but quite a few wanted to help as well, so our forces have grown, allowing us to get around quicker. However, the Dark Lord has caught onto what we’re doing, so we have to go in a more random pattern — we’ve missed a small ring of counties to get ahead of him, after sending scouts and finding, regrettably, that some towns and villages had been burned to the ground. We could be doing better, but we’re fighting, and saving people every day; and that’s what counts.”
He had seemed relieved when the elf stopped him from answering Draco’s question, his shoulders sagging and his eyes dimming slightly. It seemed he had no answer anyway. He also didn’t seem to have the presence of mind to question what Draco was doing in the kitchens, which was good because Draco
into the wall.
Draco shrugged. “If you want.”
After what seemed like an age Harry had woken up, Draco only knowing as the shadows of Harry’s mind were reeled in as they usually did when he was awake. Those shadows still terrified him - but for Harry’s sake. He knew they would never hurt him, but he wanted nothing more for them to disappear. On better days, they seemed less opaque, but now they were a void, absorbing all light (if it could be called that - their minds were on another level of reality, after all).
“What are you gonna do now, Harry?” Ron asked.
Kingsley asked the twins, “Do you have enough Polyjuice for the four of us? Nymphadora—”
each from the Carrows, rather than the several ‘cast’ on them by the Slytherins. Crabbe seemed to have been genuinely trying his best, but hadn’t been a very good spell caster, fortunately.
“I might have an inkling,” Harry replied, smirking.
“Bye guys.” Ron waved to Dean and Seamus, who were whispering urgently in the corner. “Don’t miss the train!”
Draco sighed irritably and shoved his hand into Harry’s pocket, his fingers like ice against Harry’s. When Harry looked at him questioningly, he rolled his eyes.
“I just — seeing her — looked like Bellatr—” Harry’s head disappeared back in the toilet.
“I felt well enough to come down. Also a bit of cabin fever — there’s only so much that happens on the streets of London.”
Once everyone was out, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, Remus and Severus sat around the dining table.
“Lucius!” he shouted, his voice echoing through the corridor.
“Am I now?”
Draco sighed, turning back to his runes homework, but they turned and swam off the page. Huffing in irritation, Draco got ready for bed and slid under the covers, casting a
“Never.”
kissing them.
, Draco thought.
Harry fell to his knees in front of the grave, his good humour evaporating. He thought he was ready for this, but he wasn’t. What did he say? Was he supposed to speak?
“Does that mean you’ll be at dinner then?” Granger had leaned around the back of the Weasel to look at Harry.
Draco laughed, a fond look on his face, and half–carried Harry to bed, gently tucking Harry in. Harry knew he was blushing, but he couldn’t bring himself to complain; not when Draco was looking at him like
Somehow, Potter was always where Draco was. When Draco left class, Potter was there. When he walked into the Great Hall, Potter was often on his heels. And where Potter went his adoring fanbase went - girls and guys alike, after the wizarding world had a crisis over Potter coming out as bisexual.
Harry wasn’t quite sure when he noticed, but at some point he realised that he was falling in love with Draco. It didn’t quite hit him all at once, but rather seeped into the edges of his thoughts and settled into the corners of his mind, ready for him to acknowledge when he was ready.
I’m not hungry. Harry felt a pang of guilt at the reply, but reminded himself just how much he hated people coddling, and decided to talk to Draco when he got back.
They’d asked Harry if he was comfortable with them telling Draco and Severus about him being a horcrux, since they really needed some new information, and Harry agreed. Draco had shot concerned glances at Harry throughout the conversation, but had regrettably no new information to offer. Severus, as a potions master, knew a lot about the potion, but had no new information other than what he’d told them that first day. He did go slightly more in-depth with the theory, though, causing Ron’s eyes to quickly glaze over — even if he trusted Snape, he didn’t enjoy potions in the slightest, and would much rather stick to baking — but Hermione frowned at the implications. Since it was old magic, it was void of loopholes; at some point in the fourteenth century, an Italian wizard had brought new magic based on Latin rather than the original Germanic languages that the English lower classes usually used, and everyone had taken them as they came, wanting to be like the french royalty. No one had noticed the loopholes in the more complex spells and potions until the spells were well integrated into society, so they stuck, and the solid, older magic was forgotten.
They got down to the vault without a hitch — while Narcissa didn’t have Bellatrix’s wand, the spell she cast matched their records well enough, and the light underground was so pathetic that no one saw the slight lengthening of Severus’ hair, nor the change in Narcissa’s features.
“I am not
he managed to say, before dry–heaving into the toilet.
Harry looked down at his own fingers, dutifully wrapped around the pestle and holding the mortar in place. His fingernails were blunt and bitten, although he couldn’t remember biting them. The skin was dark, with little scars all over, and his left hand was marred by the words
“Ron, they haven’t won a single match this year. They’re at negative points.”
Harry dragged himself out of the shower, regretting it as soon as the cold air hit him, but determinedly pulled on his school trousers, shirt and jumper, leaving his robes for the while.
“I think I can manage a little
As the last rays of golden sunlight illuminated the sand, making it sparkle like glitter, Remus decided that he should probably go into Shell Cottage. At some point during the day, one of the kids had left out a meal for him — it was still on the sand, under various charms to keep the sand out and keep it fresh. He felt a stab of guilt at not eating it, but he had spent most of his time in the woods. He hadn’t even seen it until he’d made the decision to go back to the house. But after a childhood of having barely enough to eat, he still felt that pang of guilt whenever food was uneaten.
Draco released the breath he did not know he was holding. “I know Pans, it’ll be perfect.”
“You did not! What are you doing buying Witch Weekly?” cringed Harry.
“Yeah, just had a busy day, think I’ll have a paperwork day tomorrow to give it some rest.” Harry made a horrified face at that; avoiding paperwork had become his special skill.
Pansy gave him a knowing smile. “Hermione and Rex, Blaise and Luna, Ron and Lavender, Harry, Greg, Theo and Astoria, Nev and Hannah, George and Angelina, Daphne… um… think that’s it for tonight. You know Theo just separated from Astoria right? Might be a bit awkward.”
Thank you to everyone who has left comments and kudos, and to those who have subscribed. All the feedback is very much appreciated. This is my first attempt at writing and it's so lovely for me that people are enjoying it.
Harry laughed and said, “Don’t tell me, the four groomsmen? Fucking lethal.”
“Fucker,” replied Pansy, before the group cried out for her to pay up.
“There’s no one to write home about,” Draco stated firmly. In an effort to steer the conversation away from his non-existent love life, he asked Ginny how she was getting on with the Harpies, but was rudely interrupted from this transparent tactic by Pansy.
“Salty rim,” Ginny replied as the group laughed and Harry wrote it down. He could see it was going to be a particularly raucous night, but he thought they needed it after the months of worry they had gone through with James. He didn’t think he could possibly turn maudlin tonight, not when flying high with Draco’s presence.
Harry enjoyed the
Based on my behaviour, the doctors set me up with a routine of physio in the morning and therapy in the afternoon. I enthusiastically complied with the physio, pushing my body so I could go home and be a proper dad again. I was less compliant with the therapy, at least in the beginning. Those first few days I would sit and glare at the therapist, who smiled benignly in return. She asked a few gentle questions but didn’t push me. In my third session, she informed me that I couldn’t be discharged without sign off from both herself and the physio. You can imagine the rage I threw her way. Once I had calmed down enough to return to glaring at her, I realised I’d better fob her off with something if I was ever going to get my kids back.
“That’s cheating!” Draco practically shouted, also a little on the drunk side. “I won’t tell if you let me have some,” he continued with a lazy grin, as Harry tried to shush him. Harry passed him the bottle and enjoyed watching him swallow a little too much.
“It looks fabulous Pans,” Draco reassured his friend. “Relax, I’ll get us a drink.”
“You too.” Draco blushed and looked away, gesturing for the bar tender. “A lemonade and a…”
“Fuck yes.” Draco reluctantly removed his hands from Harry’s shoulders and followed him inside. It was busier in the pub than it had been when he and the girls had arrived. Pushing his sunglasses up onto his head, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and led him through the crowd, ensuring they didn’t get separated.
“Terrible.”
“Don’t apologise Harry, it’s nothing. We were far worse at his age,” Draco reminded him.
“Harry. It’s me you’re talking to. Just tell me what you’re thinking.”
“Oh no, he’s at Andromeda’s with Ted. No doubt they’ll be going out to cause chaos somewhere.” Ginny handed him a pink drink in a margarita glass.
Harry batted Draco’s hand away as he moved to take out his wallet, and he passed a tenner to the barman. After retrieving his change, they grabbed their drinks and carefully weaved their way back outside. Draco returned to his seat beside Pansy, and Harry stopped by Ginny’s chair, Ray Bans back in place, giving her shoulder a squeeze. Ginny turned to look at him with a raised eyebrow and an “About time you twat.”
Harry averted his eyes as he continued, “After the war, I was looking for distraction from my own thoughts everywhere I could. To start with it was Ginny; we lost ourselves in each other for months before she went back for her seventh year and by then I’d started auror training, which was as intense a distraction as you could imagine. We’d split up by the time we found out Gin was pregnant, and she was freaking out; she’d had an offer to train with the Harpies after graduating and was adamant she couldn’t keep the baby. At this point I was pretty positive I was gay and thought it might be my only chance of being a dad, so I offered to raise the baby; told Ginny she didn’t have to be involved at all if she didn’t want to. The decision was made once she told her parents she was pregnant - there was no way they would have been on board with her getting an abortion. With that came some extra pressures; they desperately wanted us to get married and continued to try to convince us to do it for years after. They still mention it on occasion, though I’m sure it’s a joke by now. They didn’t really care when I told them I was gay, they still thought we should be together to raise the baby properly.
Ginny and Pansy exchanged a knowing glance, before wrapping him in a hug and exclaiming their love for him, along with a “Less of the old!” from Pansy.
“Well he wouldn’t tell you about any dates would he.” Pansy chimed in.
He felt his anxiety rise as he considered the trip ahead. Eighteen years since the war ended and Draco still avoided going home as much as possible. He knew things had moved on back in England, and ‘Death Eater Draco’ had faded into insignificance as the years passed, but memories of those first few months of relentless confrontations in wizarding Britain never did quite fade. When there was no sign of the animosity letting up, Draco and his mother had fled to muggle Paris, renouncing his incarcerated father, and changing their name to Narcissa’s maiden name Black. It was there that Draco studied fashion design, before accepting a coveted internship with Louis Vuitton. By the time he set up his own brand in New York, he was well known both for his boundary pushing muggle menswear, and his playboy ways, photographed with a different man on his arm each week. After ten years building his business, Draco’s partying had settled down somewhat; now he was more often found spending time enjoying meals with friends, who had quickly become his adopted muggle family.
find a lovely muggle to settle down with. Walks in central park, morning papers in bed and sex in the kitchen. The whole shebang. But as I am sure Potter can attest, it’s not that simple. You can never tell them the truth of yourself, and that always leaves a wall between you.”
, he thought,
“Don’t be silly, I was perusing your gallery and got chatting to your manager… though I can’t for the life of me remember his name.”
Shaking himself from these maudlin thoughts, Draco searched his mind for something light-hearted to bring to the conversation. Only four days into his trip and he was already at his wits end with discussing decorations and seating charts and favours, so was keen not to let the conversation move to the wedding. The previous chat about relationships with muggles brought to mind one of Draco’s favourite silly fantasies.
Draco was nervous as he made his way from The Leaky Cauldron floo to Harry’s gallery. He hated being out of control and was filled with dread about what could happen to him here. He was still absolutely recognisable as a Malfoy; like Harry he was an almost perfect copy of his father. He may have changed his name and moved to another country, but he knew the wizarding world was damaged irreparably by the war, and that those memories were not easily forgotten. His thoughts were tumbling over the countless accusations and curses thrown his way by shoppers on Diagon Alley before he fled to Paris all those years ago, and his hand was gripping the wand in his pocket with vice-like force. He needn’t have been so worried however, as nothing untoward happened on his way to the gallery, just as Pansy and Harry had assured him they wouldn’t. He safely arrived at the gallery and ducked inside with no issues. Draco couldn’t help but be impressed by what he saw. He knew how talented a sculptor Harry was, owning some of his work himself, and having attended several exhibitions of Harry’s over the years. Seeing pieces displayed in his own space was a different experience though, and Draco found himself overwhelmed by the talent. He knew Harry focused his work on the human body, using both the male and female form as inspiration, but seeing so much of his work all in one place left Draco breathless at the pure erotic nature of it. He had always assumed that Harry would be nice in bed, being such a lovely normal man. But when confronted with his body of work, Draco felt he may be completely wrong about just how filthy his friend could be. These thoughts in mind, Draco realised he was going into this rendezvous completely on the back foot. Spending more time around the beautifully sexual sculptures made by Harry’s own hands wasn’t likely to ease his tension.
“That’s your own fault you great idiot. You know I’m always gagging for you. I can’t believe I have to get married to get your stupid yank arse back home.” She poked her tongue out at him before the irrepressible grin came back.
The group were still giggling an hour later, at a table littered with debris from the meal and an evening spent boozing. James came home late, on the scrounge for leftovers, and heard enough of his parent’s conversation to decide it was probably for the best to eat in his room.
“That escalated quickly,” remarked Harry, as he slid from his seat to stir the curry. This was a subject he was never happy to talk about with Draco and wasn’t sure why Pansy brought it up here when he was staying at their place. With his back to the table, Harry busied himself with the dinner, the tension in his shoulders not going unnoticed by Ginny.
Harry waited until the waitress retreated until he held his hands up, bowed his head and exclaimed, “And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how it’s done.” The table laughed and applauded him as he took the sickle off the table, flicked it into the air and caught it before putting it in his pocket.
Draco was drawn into conversation with Hermione’s husband Rex, a muggle psychology professor from Yorkshire. He felt on edge, as everyone had arrived with one notable exception, and found he wasn’t really following the conversation. He usually enjoyed catching up with Rex, however he knew there was only one person he was desperate to see. Trust Potter to be late as usual. He went through the motions with Rex, mumbling, “Yes”, “I see”, “Mm hmm” in appropriate places, as he sipped his way through his drink far too quickly. He was about to offer to go to the bar, when a deep voice muttered “Boo!” in his ear, making his stomach jump into his throat.
eyes in?”
“Moist is always a winner,” Harry suggested.
“Owls deliver your post?” Ginny continued, wavering between Welsh and Scottish as she got a case of the giggles.
Draco let loose a contented sigh as he grudgingly said, “I suppose I had better be off, seeing as they have me fully itinerised for tomorrow.”
“Don’t you dare talk to him like that!” Ginny added, warningly.
Draco excused himself to the guest room, loosed his hair from on top his head, shaking it out and running his fingers roughly over his scalp. He showered quickly and selected a tight black t-shirt and closely tailored trousers to wear with his trademark ankle boots. He slipped on a thin blazer and rolled up the sleeves to show some of his tattoos. His obsession with collecting tattoos started after wanting a cover up for the dark mark. The faded snake did nothing for his image of a French-educated fashion designer, and once he got the dragon covering it, he became addicted. His favourite was the field of daffodils on his bicep, which he chose for his mother. Draco added a light grey Alexander McQueen scarf to finish his look, then joined the girls in the kitchen.
“Yes Josh?” he replied.
“Go ahead and write about me, you silly old cow, I fucking dare you. Your only skill is making grandmothers cream over sad middle age poufs,” James replied, filled with venom.
“Well what about a lovely wizard then? Brooklyn has a fantastic magical district, remember when we went to that bar in Dumbo? Diagon is a joke in comparison,” chimed in Ginny.
Although Draco shared most of his deepest, darkest secrets with Harry, there was one that he would never tell, and that was the starring role The Chosen One had in Draco’s rich fantasies. He shot a silencing spell towards the door then relaxed back into bed. He had a few favourite screen shots of Harry on his phone, from their many night time video calls, and those combined with his fresh memories from last night gave Draco’s imagination some good material to work with. He slipped his t-shirt over his head and pulled his boxers off, enjoying the feel of the soft sheets on his naked skin. Draco lazily ran his soft hands over his chest, travelling down to his hip bones and then back up. He shut his eyes and imagined Harry’s hands were the ones teasing his nipples, biting his lip and wishing Potter was there to capture his mouth with his own. He enjoyed caressing his own body, feeling his cock thicken but not allowing himself to touch it just yet. He ran a hand up the inside of his thigh, remembering the feel of Harry’s body against his, imagining more than a hug from his friend. As he moved to slowly stroke his shaft, he imagined pinning Harry up against the bar, trailing kisses up his neck, biting his ear, and feeling an answering hardness press against his own. He brushed his thumb over his slit, smearing pre-come back down his length. He sped up his strokes, his breath coming quicker as he thought of all the delicious things he wanted to do to Harry. It didn’t take long before Draco was close, one hand pumping his cock while another cupped his balls and stroked his perineum. He was panting now, thinking of tangling his hands in Harry’s messy curls, while his beautiful mouth devoured Draco’s thick cock. He came with Harry’s name on his lips, decorating his hand and stomach with white stripes. He lay with his eyes closed, letting his breathing return to normal, while he fantasised about something he never had until Harry; that the man was beside him in the afterglow, wrapping his arms around him and kissing his neck until he fell asleep.
“Hm?”
The waitress appeared before he could sneak off to the bar, taking their order for three mojitos. As she left the others started to arrive, and Draco masked his nerves in friendly greetings. The group had been friends for years, since Blaise and Luna got married a couple of years after the war; the Hogwarts house system becoming less and less relevant the further from school they got. Draco had been back every year or so since setting up in New York, and after the first few rounds of awkward apologies was welcomed into the fold. Due to being so far away, he never felt as relaxed in the group as he should, and it took a few days into each visit before his nerves dissipated. He kept in touch with many of them via email or phone, but that was sporadic, with them all having their own lives to pay attention to. The exception to this was Harry, who had inadvertently become Draco’s closest friend. Their friendship groups had become intertwined, and the more time they spent together, the more they realised they had in common. Spending their childhood as pawns for powerful wizards had left each of them with similar baggage. Nowadays, barely a day went by without a text or phone call, and Draco wouldn’t jeopardise that for anything.
Ron gave her the two fingered salute then continued, “But let's do our best to keep the celebrations going eh? There’s not many single ones still standing, so who knows how many weddings we have left to be completely immature at. So, next on the agenda - Wednesday night we will be down the Leaky for the quiz. I hope you can all make it. For now, it’s Gin’s night, so Gin is games master. First though, two fingers for the birthday girl!”
“I was just making sure - I worry about you, alone in that house. You could come stay with me and Ron?” Hermione had breached this topic at least once a week since Harry had left the Burrow; that is to say, since he broke up with Ginny. They lived in an apartment Hermione was renting in London until school started, and then were planning to use the money they’d received with their Orders of Merlin to buy a house. Harry would, but he worried - if he forgot to do his glamours, if he forgot to put up a silencing charm, if the charm failed...he couldn’t worry them anymore. He couldn’t be a burden - they’d already gone through so much for him in the last year, he couldn’t ask any more.
“How do you know he’s at Malfoy Manor?”
Quickly realising that it was almost impossible to have a private conversation in such a crowded house, Narcissa was sent to get a system of safehouses set up with Millicent, Seamus, Dean and Luna. After a lot of arguing, it was determined that Ginny could stay, but first she had to go and visit the rest of her brothers.
“I’d be honoured.”
“Fine.” Ron groaned. “I’m not going to be happy about it though.”
Draco once again woke up having been blocked out of Harry’s mind. This time he hadn’t even been able to see the nightmare - he’d just been blocked, no matter how much he shouted and pleaded and hammered with metaphorical fists.
Harry leant into Draco, allowing himself to be encircled in long, strong limbs. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco. He knew they were both crying, could feel the shuddering breaths Draco dragged in as he nestled his face into the soft skin just above his collarbone.
Happy with his plans, Voldemort walked over to his bedside table, removing the various wards around the top drawer. He’d been using all of the chaos to avoid this, but it needed to be looked at.
“That’s the point,” Draco replied, raising an eyebrow.
“Do you want to stay upstairs? I think she’s leaving in a few minutes.”
“Why are you asking?” Weasley’s tone was definitely irritated at the start, but it jumped up in pitch as Granger stamped on his foot again. Draco’s respect for the girl was growing with each passing moment.
” Hermione screeched, causing Severus to startle at his seat and Remus to come running out of the kitchen, wand raised.
“Well we all know what happens to blood traitors, don’t we?” An eerie chuckle from the Dark Lord, echoed by a few followers around the room.
After being released and three panic attacks in three hours after walking into the Manor, it had been sold within a day, and the Malfoy family had gone to France. But Draco had felt uncomfortable there - he missed England, with the shitty weather and rude people and
terrible.”
“Thank you, my lord.” Draco didn’t allow even a flicker of disgust across his face, as he knelt to kiss a polished, black shoe.
“What do you
and so on.”
The Weasleys had broken off into two groups to cover the grounds quicker; Fred, George, and Percy had gone one way, and Bill, Ron, and Ginny had gone the other. The scent of blood was strong, even though the ground was bare, with only the occasional snowdrop peeking through the damp dirt.
“How soon can we get him out?” Draco’s skin had taken on a grey tinge, and he was resting his head on the tiled wall. He was clearly in no shape to be breaking old classmates out of dungeons. Not to mention, they didn’t know when the rest of the death eaters would be back — and fighting hoarders of death eaters with an unconscious Potter wouldn’t be good. Not to mention, this would blow their cover, so they’d have to time it
He’d registered this in the split second he’d bought as a masked death eater fell, petrified, while two others flailed as bright flames ate at their cloaks.
“Fine. In any case, I’ll get the pleasure of watching you fall down them.” Draco smirked, opening the door with his hand and pushing it open, before gesturing with his hand. “Go ahead.”
He cast a spell to dispel the stench, gingerly stepping on the stone floor.
Then they got to the Great Hall, and it was as bad as the Feast last night. Flashbacks of everyone who had died, even those who didn’t die in the Battle, like Moody, hit Harry harder than the Hogwarts express ever could. He pushed all the emotions that threatened to well up down, down, where he didn’t have to acknowledge them.
it. Without utilizing it, your plight was doomed from the start.”
Harry figured that was something to look forward to, after dinner, which would probably be exhausting.
He still got nightmares - mostly of being forced to torture other people, while his parents were held at wandpoint - and he woke up sweaty and with his heart racing, but when he’d asked the elves they’d said he didn’t make any noise and his nightmares didn’t tend to invade his day.
Potter stumbled backwards, leaning heavily against the wall, blood pooling on the floor. Voldemort smirked and took steps forward, deflecting spells with easy flicks of his wand.
Blaise ended up taking thirty-seven minutes, and was immediately punched by Pansy for wasting her money on
I’ll get the ingredients,“like I
Bill cleared his throat again, before reading:
“Of course I’m ready.” Fleur flicked her hair and rolled her eyes, but Remus didn’t miss the slight tremor in her voice, and from the look of Bill’s arm around her shoulders, neither did he.
Remus rolled his eyes. “You used shield charms,
Potter held out his hand for the flask, but promptly dropped it. A hasty levitation charm stopped it from smashing on the floor, so Draco sat next to Potter on the floor, grimacing at the smell, and held the flask up to his lips. Thankfully, Potter drank the potion - Draco didn’t know what he would have done if Potter was being difficult.
“That’s reasonable. Ginny, fetch some parchment and a quill.”
, because this was the second person from his inner circle who had left. Behind the shield of instability, Harry heard the word
Draco sighed and took a measured sip so they each had the same amount in their glasses, and held it up. “On three?”
Thank you all for reading this far <3
He watched Draco’s breathing even out before letting out a breath and letting go of his emotions slightly. He held his breath again as Draco shifted in his sleep - either a dream or a result of the onslaught of emotions Harry sent down the bond (he wouldn’t have, but he found it really difficult to keep them coiled up and hidden) - mostly shame, embarrassment, fear and guilt.
“I think that would be for the best. Thank you.”
He was silent for the entirety of the train trip. Pansy had figured out that he wasn’t feeling talkative, finally, and didn’t attempt to engage him in conversation, allowing him to wallow in self pity in the corner of the train carriage.
Which meant he was stuck in this jumper for the rest of the day.
Harry slumped back in his chair. “Yeah. And we need to actually meet Ginny.”
He sighed and shook his head. He’d put up barriers to prevent Harry from feeling his emotions, but he didn’t know how good Harry was at leglimency.
would have found a way to contact us.” Hermione stood at the head of the table, the assorted Weasleys and Fleur sitting around the table.
It became that this was the most enjoyable meal Harry had had at the Gryffindor table since he’d come back. It didn’t quite measure up to those intimate meals with Draco, sitting on one of their beds in comfortable silence, but this was a close second - Draco took all the pressure off Harry and brought it onto himself, allowing Harry to be in the presence of his friends without the pressure of being the Saviour. Hermione shot a couple of weird looks at him, but that was something to worry about later.
He didn’t get much before a pair of red eyes were looking at him, rippling around the edges with a hot, burning fire.
Hermione’s eyes started to fill with tears as the old elf started to rock faster.
“No, no — I can go in through the Forbidden Forest, the natural magic will interfere with the wards. If I’m wearing my invisibility cloak, I am practically undetectable, as long as I stick to the footpaths. And I know exactly where I’m going.”
Malfoy — Draco — rolled his eyes. “Alright, I’ll go get my books. They’re all in the room with Pot—” he caught Hermione glaring at him, “Harry. In the room with Harry.”
“You’re not supposed to gulp it, you moron. You’re supposed to sip it.” Draco did so, delicately, grimacing at the taste but clearly not as close to spluttering as Harry was.
“Can we go visit their graves first?”
Voldemort had meant to take it out, he really did, but what with Severus leaving, then Narcissa breaking out the kids and ruining the trap at Godric’s Hollow, he’d really had a lot going on. Not to mention, Alecto and Amycus were completely
Draco huffed and flopped onto the sofa —
Harry clumsily climbed in, Dumbledore followed with much more grace, barely rocking the boat. As soon as he’d sat down, the boat began to move across the unnervingly still lake, Dumbledore’s lumos casting an eerie light around the cave.
Thirdly, I wrote this back at the very start of September and actually haven’t written since. I’ve got exams next week, university applications in October if I get decent predicted grades, more exams in November, and genuinely have no idea when I’m going to be able to write, so there probably won’t be a posting schedule for the last 5 chapters (it genuinely irritates be so much how few hours there are in the day)
Hermione huffed lightly as the blonde turned and went up the stairs, his steps falling a little heavier than they needed to. She turned to Ron. “Library?”
Draco breathed a sigh of relief as Potter’s bright green eyes flew open, wide at the sight of Draco. Suddenly aware of his position — one leg draped over Potter, his nose bare inches from Draco’s — and flew off as quickly as he could.
“Not that witty, really,” Ron muttered, and Hermione elbowed him, before smiling encouragingly at Draco.
Draco sighed, and rubbed his forehead. So much for Potter being easy to deal with - of course the git was being a self-sacrificing hero. “Well what am I supposed to do with you then?”
Dumbledore or away
“If you’re going to do this, at least do it so you don’t get caught. They’re going at ten in the morning.”
and had no way out of here.
“I guess we’re not supposed to reply then.”
“Hurry up, Potter, I don’t have
One by one, his cuts closed, and
“He’s strong — and he can’t die, not while Voldemort is alive, because of that potion.”
However, Draco was quite sure he was the only person who had seen Harry’s true self. The fear he’d felt when mentioning the other two thirds of the golden trio...well, they weren’t much of a trio anymore. At breakfast, it had just been the couple, whispering over eggs and toast, laughing with the Gryffindors. Harry hadn’t even been there.
“Well, we’ve only been back for twenty–four hours, so not much. Actually, now that you’re awake, we should probably test your magical core. We’re also learning some diagnosis spells, then we’ll be able to learn the right healing spells to speed up your recovery.”
She rolled her eyes. “Fine.”
Harry hung off the side of his bed, searching underneath for a pyjama top. Every night, the one he was wearing the night before had disappeared, and he’d gone from five overly large t-shirts filled with holes to no overly large t-shirts filled with holes.
Harry rolled his eyes and forced his mouth to turn up at the corners slightly - Ron always waited until the last day to pack, always forgot something and that something was, without fail, needed the day before it arrived. “It’s impressive you’ve got him packing this early in the week.”
“Well this is going to be a fun few weeks,” Hermione said.
Draco stumbled back a step as the realisation hit him. That wasn’t just
“I am,” he took a breath,
After leaving a note for Ron saying he wanted to be left alone and would be back after dinner, he grabbed his invisibility cloak and walked out of the castle towards the Forbidden Forest. He hadn’t been near it since the Battle, but it was the last time he saw his parents, even if they were shades. It seemed...right.
“Hermione, I understand that you’re worried, but they probably just haven’t had an opportunity.” Molly’s words were kind, but her tone was clearly condescending.
“Throw it away, the book said one should be enough.” Voldemort hurried out of the hall, trusting Severus to do what was required.
disappear from the back of his mind - Harry hadn’t disappeared, of course, just closed off his mind a bit. Draco could see a hedge, the same green as Harry’s eyes, surrounding the shadows, keeping them in check. Draco’s heart broke a little as he imagined having to deal with those at all times.
He was almost there.
Double chapter! (tbf the last one is just a little epilogue)
“Harry, mate, what’s wrong?” Ron knelt beside Harry, laying the back of his hand against Harry’s forehead. He was burning up, but also shaking with full body tremors.
“So what do we have to do guys? I’ve got my trunk shrunk in my pocket.”
“It’s fine. You needed time.”
Harry had zoned out again. He watched emotionlessly as small children (“We couldn’t possibly have been that small, ‘Mione, look at them!”) walked from the hat to the tables, registering somewhere in the back of his mind the amount of applause the Slytherin first years was significantly less than the other three houses, but couldn’t find the effort to be mad about it.
“Holy shit! I’m of age now, aren’t I?” Harry cut into the silence.
“We can’t beat ourselves up
— sending letters every other day about how there were no students, everyone was hidden, and the rest of it. And of course, he couldn’t entrust Hogwarts to any of his other followers; they’d probably leave him too.
Draco jumped in shock. Rather than the bathroom being empty, Harry was standing there, shirtless. Draco realised he hadn’t seen Harry shirtless before this point, and now saw why. Harry was standing with his back to Draco, and his back…
Kreacher muttered something under his breath, and turned hateful eyes on Hermione. She glanced to the side, but Ron still seemed breathless, so she was on her own.
“It will work out. It always does.” Molly stroked her daughter’s back, before turning to the rest of her family that were present, tears finally leaking from her eyes. “I love you all very much. Tell — tell Charlie, and Harry, and — and — and Percy, if he ever comes back…”
Draco pushed himself up with his right hand, sitting beside Harry as he drew the bowl over to his lap. He sniffed at the water - murtlap and dittany - before examining his arm. It was marred with raised, white scar tissue, going halfway up his forearm. Under the scar tissue...Draco almost threw up. While the mark was even more faded than before, it was still there, light grey against the pale skin. Draco flexed his wrist - there was a dull pain emanating from beneath the scar, but overall it could have been a lot worse.
Hermione scanned the parchment, smiling. “It says — hang on, I’ll just read it out.
Harry slid into his usual seat beside Draco, who sneered at him. “Late get-up, Potter?”
Harry thought - the two had got together straight after the Battle. Harry made a mental note not to go into their room unless it was absolutely necessary.) However, Harry couldn’t find his name...until he got to the very bottom of the list.
in Latin. Ron tried to relax and just let his magic flow out of him, gritting his teeth as his knees threatened to buckle. Still, he let the magic flow, occasionally sneaking glances at the beautiful girl beside him.
“Draco?” Narcissa breathed.
” Potter’s motionless form shook a few times before his eyes shot open. “Excellent, you’re awake. Drink this.” He held out the potion through the bars expectantly. Potter sat there and watched him, his face expressionless.
Harry’s ears strained to hear anything past the footsteps, but only got a whisper of robes before he felt the cut on his cheek reopen. Another swish, and the end of a wand lit up, illuminating the face of Bellatrix Lestrange.
Draco hesitated for a moment, before removing his trousers, standing before Potter in only his underwear. He started blushing as Harry started staring, just at him, before saying “Enjoying the view?” It was an intimate moment, but Draco didn’t deal well with delicate situations.
Bellatrix pouted, while Greyback leered at Harry. “And why would that be, My Lord?”
He easily restrained him with ropes, leaving him hovering in the air.
Ron saw Hermione bidding Snape farewell, and frowned.
“You are going back to school, right?”
On the bright side, this is the last chapter where I didn’t really know what I was doing. I have a good idea for most of the other chapters, which means when I actually get time to write I should be able to churn out the chapters pretty quickly!
