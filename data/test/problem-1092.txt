Fotheringham continued,
“Fuck me.” He exclaimed as he came in and threw himself down on Harry’s beaten up armchair.
After his Auror training he had agreed to do some work with the press to provide some assurance to everyone, ensuring them that they could trust in their ministry and their Aurors again. After all, he, Harry, was there so no-one needed to fear. It had worked too well, however, and he had found himself spending more time going to photo opportunities than doing any serious work in the field. Robards had refused to listen and maintained his mantra that being a successful Auror was to use your best skills and attributes. And Harry’s best attribute was his name and his reputation. After a while, it felt like he couldn’t say no, it was too late. He had missed his chance at helping people and was instead a celebrity wearing Auror robes.
The night air was cool and cleared his head. Owls hooted in the distance and the path was dark, clusters of trees either side of him.
He thought about the way that Draco had never turned his back at the man, had walked in front of Harry the entire time and seemed genuinely wary in his presence overall. “You don’t trust him.” It was supposed to be a question but came out more like a fact. For he knew it was true. Had spent enough time watching Malfoy as a child to know what it looked like when he didn’t trust you. When he was trying to keep himself safe.
“Shut up,” Harry said with a roll of his eyes.
Draco giggled, his cheeks were pink and his lips stretched into a lopsided smile. He rolled his eyes at him. “Don’t be absurd, it was a moderate performance at best.”
He examined the assortment of curious items on her desk. Random orbs, dried animal feet and a small portable cauldron that was glowing vibrantly were some of the items taking space.
Hermione found him in the waiting room outside where they were working on Draco. Every time a healer walked past, lime green robes billowing behind them, he stood and tried to get some information but they ignored him.
Harry nodded, struggling to come back to himself. He pushed his fingers through his hair and exhaled shakily. “What p-potion is it? I can’t recognise it.”
Draco sucked in a breath and shouted. “POTTER!”
Fotheringham stood and began pouring them both drinks. It made Harry’s stomach churn at the thought. The two crystal glasses were brought to the desk and Fotheringham sat again, eyeing both Draco and the drink.
“And how do we know this?”
Harry paused for a moment and his laughter dying out. “Yes. I think I can, Draco.” The name seemed to melt on his tongue and he tasted it. It was softer, sweeter somehow than saying ‘Malfoy.’ Harry found he preferred it.
“Hi….um…can I…what do you want?” A flush was spreading across his face, of course it was, as he stuttered and stumbled over his words.
The following two nights saw Harry visit the three out of the four pubs and still come up with nothing. No other mentions nor hints of foul play was anywhere to be seen. He was getting impatient.
Long and winding hallways and a rickety set of steps leading to some type of basement, found them in a store room filled with rows upon rows of bottles.
His legs began to carry him aimlessly down the street.
“Yes, yes – of course, darling. Anyway, I’ll give you these and I best be off.” She thumped a woven basket in his arms and patted his cheek lovingly.
“He wants something from me, Potter and I don’t know what it is.”
that he couldn’t have done anything else but obey.
Harry shared in Draco’s excitement. “Alright? Draco, you were brilliant! Incredible. Fantastic.”
He was keenly aware of Potter watching his every move, no doubt expecting Draco to poison the daft bugger rather than just give him dairy induced diarrhoea.
“What weird stuff?”
“Okay, well we’ll have to just get you to sign something to say it was an accident and then we can – “
“Well, I didn’t say that, Fotheringham.” Draco’s voice was silky and so unlike his own,
The rest of the night continued as expected. Draco made cocktails, muggles got drunk. At one point, two men got in a fight over something and Draco verbally eviscerated them while continuing to make spin bottled and pour drinks into a glass, popping in a straw that sang tunes. He really had to ask whether the straws were battery or Draco operated.
“No, the name Bernard; what do you think of the name?”
“Right,” Patil said, “We’re going to Apparate him there, I can’t stabilise him more than this and waiting will only put him in more danger -  Harry hold my arm.”
It was a while before Draco spoke. “I thought that was it.”
It was fairly quiet by the time he got there, and he felt the need to congratulate his good timing for getting drunk and sending letters at the weekend where less people were around to watch him set his life on fire.
It strikes Harry how different the people are in here. This pub seems to cater to all demographics. There are couples, the elderly, teenagers of dubious drinking age and everything in between and all are holding…the most bizarre drinks he had ever seen in his entire life, and he once drank wine made by elves.
She moved forward in the queue and began to place her order, which must have been for a large gathering as she had to read from what looked like an extensive list. She was engrossed in her conversation with the person at the till and Harry could find no way to interrupt to keep the conversation going. Soon she had a bag in her hand and was heading for the door. Hesitating with one foot literally hanging out the door she turned around and smiled at him.
Harry leant back on his hands. “Sorry, did you say something else? I was still thinking about just how decent your arse is.”
“Yes, exactly.”
Draco snickered. “Fair enough. Four?”
“Oh yes. I fled to America for the war, you see. But I kept abreast of the situation here at home. It really was something.”
“Yeah. Or.”
When he saw who it was, one of his regulars, he motioned for Harry to take over the argument with the van driver for him.
Stepping gingerly over an empty bottle of something that was oozing green sludge, he went into the smallest bedroom of the cottage.
“Then, he would quit his job.”
As he rounded the corner, he saw the driver sitting at the side of the building as Harry levitated the van back down the street.
“Right, I’m going to head.” Draco looked up to see Tempy picking up her jacket and walk towards him.
Fotheringham said.
Harry’s heart sank. “No, Ron – you should go. Honestly, you deserve to celebrate.”
The van, however, was gone.
It was Smith’s turn to look admonishing now, Harry flipped him off.
Draco rolled his eyes at him. “Muggle sports. Not really interested in muggle sports. Too much running and the rules are tedious. Also, without the threat of death from falling from a great height what’s the point?”
“Yeah I’d gathered that thanks. Why’d he do that?”
Robards was moving and saying ‘right, let’s go’ again and then everyone was busying themselves about the room. The suspects were told to stand and the younger of the two Aurors, pimply faced and who looked no more than nineteen, took them by the elbows and directed them downstairs with Harry close behind.
Spells were being cast everywhere overhead. He had to duck as one of the men they hadn’t seen had come from the shadows and began throwing curses all around.
Fotheringham clapped loudly, again, and then the meeting was over and they were climbing out of the basement and walking towards the door.
“Now, now, Potter…even Death Eaters have names. You don’t have to call him an ‘it’.”
Draco withdrew his arm from his face and looked at him eyebrow raised. “Well thank you for that insightful interruption as I was going through the possible wizarding weirdos of this town.”
“Problem here, Weasley. Can you speak privately? Your office floo in two minutes.” The eel thing didn’t wait for a reply and slithered out the room again.
“They’re ready for you.” She says.
“What? Pretend what?”
Draco nodded and began to fetch a tray and pull glasses down from the shelves above the bar, he truly felt fortunate being quite tall, or tall enough to reach most shelves.
“Why don’t you use a barber then? I think there’s one near the edge of the village,” Harry said. Draco looked coldly at him and then resumed lying on the floor. “Really, I don’t know why you’re fussing. I think your hair is…nice.” Draco stopped fussing with it and turned his head to see Harry clearer. “I mean, well, it’s soft and it’s blond so that’s a bonus, right?”
“Shag him senseless?”
Harry found himself amused rather than irritated as he would have been before at the sight of Draco stomping ahead, nose in the air.
A feeling like curdled milk pooled in his gut, creeping on to his back. The hand holding his robes twitched as if to wipe it off. This shame was a living thing that came with him wherever he went.
When Harry apparated into Draco’s apartment, Patil gripping his elbow, he immediately began looking for Smith.
That stopped him dead. “Potter tell me you are not in a fucking tent in that forest.”
“The mirror? Yeah. Weird.”
Everything inside him tensed up. Swirling motion in his stomach caused his hands to grip the kitchen counter. He let go of a shaky breath and turned slowly to look at Potter.
“I’m going to be here for the next few days. For the investigation. I’ll be dropping in regularly to see how things are.”
“If you’ll come this way.”
Long, pale limbs were carelessly thrown over him. A slender arm across his chest and a leg across his. His brain was trying to give him numerous explanations as to why he was in bed with a stranger in a random room until the previous night came flooding back to him. He sagged in relief; it was just Malfoy. Although that thought brought him up short.
“And for him? If we decide that we want to be together then he’s going to get the brunt of the shit from people.”
Harry moved onto his knees in front of him. “Draco, please wake up. It’s a dream. It’s just a dream.” His voice was pleading, panicked.
“Harry! Snap out of it!” Patil was shouting at him. “Send a Patronus to St Mungo’s.”
Hermione cleared her throat, “How is he? Is Draco going to be alright?”
Draco’s pale brows knitted in confusion until he remembered the reason why Harry was perhaps being so gentle with him this morning. Blood rushed to his face and he groaned inwardly.
All at once everyone was moving. Cracks of Ron and the remaining detectives coming into the flat.
“I’ve contacted Kingsley – he’s going to see if someone can do some sort of re-routing if you will on the Apparating tracker. Hopefully, they can see if it will attach itself Side-Alongs too.”
“I see. I think I would –“
“Then I would never see daylight. What usually stops you from sleeping?”
Bewildered, Harry looked around, trying to see the next threat and then he looked to Draco. Everything in him seemed to stutter and halt altogether. He heard nothing but the buzzing of his blood in his ears and his breaths, rough and staggered.
“It did have a dragon, Ron. And goblins.” Hermione chipped in.
Their audience of three were looking between them both, amused and concerned both. “Ever so fortunate. The girls said it cured their acne. Cured it. Completely took it away. Bam! Almost like magic.”
“Yeah,” the taller replied, brows knitted in confusion or perhaps concern, Harry was unsure.
He found them in the living room, cramped around what appeared to be a small speaker. Voices could be heard coming from it indistinct at first to Harry’s ears. Smith was sitting on the floor and holding some sort of old looking telephone. One part, connected by a black wire, he held to his ear and the other to his mouth.
“God, how inconsiderate. You need to find a new friend.”
“I know,” he smiled, “I’m rather looking forward to it.” He moved closer and kissed Draco’s neck and then along his jaw.
Harry was shocked at his candour. His mouth opened and closed several times until he simply nodded, accepting the statement. Draco nodded in turn and began to walk again. They didn’t speak until they reached the pub.
Potter it seemed was in two minds. Half his body tuned towards the door to run away screaming and the other half eyeing the bed which must have looked like heaven on earth after being in a bloody tent. He raked his hands through his dark hair and then he climbed under the covers, face burning.
Harry smiled at him. “Well, if we get hungry tonight I’ll just send you to one of their doors.” Malfoy rolled his eyes and bit back a smile. This only served to spur Harry on. “Oh, Draco! You’re far too thin! Draco, will a steak dinner do? I have a fillet of salmon if you prefer!” He broke off in cackle and Malfoy’s smile was unmistakable.
Draco threw a helpless look at Harry and began a quiet, as was possible in the noisy pub, conversation that seemed to be mostly Draco looking mortified and hissing things at her and she continuing to cackle in return.
Malfoy’s long fingers were in the middle of spooning some blueberries onto his plate when he stopped suddenly, hands in mid-air, staring at his tea.
He began to mop the juice and pulp off the bar. The ends of his hair were green from the kiwi and cucumber that had dived into the air and then onto his face.
“Wha – I – go home, Malfoy.”
Harry’s heart stopped dead and he whipped round to look at them both. The two were none the wiser and continued with their utterly baffling conversation.
An hour later, Harry was in full swing of feeling sorry for himself. He went over the day in his head, the humiliation of it. Head tilted back on the arm of the chaise he pressed the bottle to his lips. He had had enough. It was ridiculous.
Gingerly, he turned his head to get a look at him. The sight that met him did something to him, for the man in front of him could not be Malfoy.
Sensing victory, Draco began to slowly walk back towards town. Potter was grumbling behind him and could be heard stuffing his feet into shoes and readjusting the wards.
Draco rolled his eyes even though Potter couldn’t see. “Of course, couldn’t have the saviour sleep anywhere unsavoury now could we.”
Harry looked around and pulled out his wand. The alley was dark, the sides of a warehouse towering over them oppressively. The smell of hot garbage permeated the air and almost caused him to gag. The ground was damp and the puddles reflected the dull sky blanketed in the city smog.
“Will you ever in your life say my first name without taking the piss out of me?”
Draco keened and shook his head, “No. It’s just, you haven’t…I don’t want you to – just promise me you won’t make a big thing about it.”
Drinks in an array of colours are in every hand and have all sorts made things sprouting out of them. Umbrellas, sparklers, long straws curled into shapes, plastic Santa heads that sang Christmas tunes. There are people dancing in the corner, snogging openly at the bar, and generally having what looks to be the fucking night of their lives.
Sitting up, he stretched and his feet were grateful for the cool floorboards underneath. The noise of breakfast being made and amusement at the peculiar smell coming from the kitchen forced Harry to detour to the bathroom. Thankfully, he could avoid the conversation of its whereabouts as Malfoy had nodded at the door last night and said ‘Bathroom: don’t listen to anything the mirror tells you,’ and then continued with the rest of the tour.
Writing to Pansy, however, was another story. It made him painfully miss home. He had learned lots about muggle culture in his time here. Enough to see and admire the beauty in their art and histories, but it was akin to learning about life on other planets: interesting but not home.
“Yes, I believe I am late to the party on the whole developing a moral compass part in life.”
Harry had abandoned his ice-cream by this point and was focusing intently on the players, who looked deliriously happy despite their exhaustion from running so hard. “Draco are you watching this?”
When he had checked the wards for the third time, he stepped outside and drew out the small piece of parchment with the Apparating coordinates.
“What?” Harry said, supressing a groan at how red his face most likely was. “You’re looking at me like…”
“Go to St Mungo’s. I need someone immediately. Muggle poisoning, possibly by Deadlyius, restriction of airways. Then go to Kingsley. Tell him I’ve broken the statute and a team needs to be sent.”
He was warm, deliciously so. The mattress was soft and the covers smelled sweet, like lavender. Sunlight gentle on his face, he could feel the heat of it. His hand moved to feel the weight on his chest and he came across soft skin.
They had moved into the cottage three months ago. It was quaint, like something painted onto the side of an old British biscuit tin. Ivy covered brick walls surrounded the building which itself was losing a fight to the climbing roses who appeared victorious in their attempt to climb in through the windows.
“Huh?”
Harry jumped up from the chair and followed him into the office. He had been there before. Just after the war, he had frequented Kingsley’s office more than his own home.
“No, I swear to you, no connections. Not anymore, I –“
“It sure is. May I purchase this from you?”
“Will you calm down? He wouldn’t listen and then got the van wedged – I know, like you said it would – and then I did a little memory charm so I could get it back out for him.”
Harry came around the side of his bed and sat on the stool. He breathed deeply and took Draco’s hand.
Draco stilled, his breaths shallow. “Hmm. Ironic.”
He nodded solemnly, again faced with the implications of having any kind of relationship with Draco, never mind a romantic one.
“Whatever you say, love.”
Draco shook his head and then marched back up the street to continue arguing with the shite-van man.
“Well, it’s ridiculous, green, easy on the eye and fucking deadly…so I called it the Harry Potter.”
“You should be grateful, you know. I am possibly saving you from being bitten in the arse by something unsavoury.” He smirked as he saw Potter clench his fist. “But perhaps you like that sort of thing, eh?”
“Yeah, you should have him speak to your friend.”
“Really, I am sure I will be fine. I’ll meet you back here.”
“Wha – I…honestly, sir, it was kind of a spur of the moment type of thing.”
“I think that sounds like the first step of talking and thinking about it. But, I’ve been there. You figure it out eventually.”
Shoulders dropping in defeat, he made the journey back to the tent. It was long and arduous after the day he had but forced him to think.
Harry ran his hands through his hair and wondered for the second time that day what was going on with him.
“Can’t remember.”
Harry went to stand aside to let him make it when Draco shook his head and dragged him back over. “Well you’re the inspiration for the drink, darling, I think it is you who should be making it!”
“Ah well, you know how it is. Lots of protein, plenty of veg and little bit of luck from Felix.”
“…Smith are you listening? Right, good. Now remember: no smiles, straighten your robes and for Merlin’s sake look professional. The press will have a field day with this if it goes tits up so no-one better disappoint. As you know, the suspects have been read their rights and are upstairs detained – all thanks to Weasley here –"  A few ‘well dones’ and slaps on the back were passed around and Ron’s cheeks matched his flaming hair. Harry couldn’t help but smile. “So we are just waiting on – oh, nope he’s here.” Several pairs of eyes found Harry and he could do nothing but stare at his feet. Their expressions were familiar; resentment and mild disgust. He couldn’t blame them, not really. “Right then. Potter will take the detainees outside and the official arrest will be done there, we will follow and then they will be escorted to the ministry and then we can go the bloody pub. Understood?” A chorus of ‘yes sirs’ followed and then everyone was moving.
“Hey, where am I sleeping?”
“Hi. Would you by any chance have an envelope? And an owl. To send the envelope. I’m not just sending envelopes I have a letter to send. But I need an envelope and an owl in order to send it.”
Potter tripped over his own feet and cursed. Draco couldn’t shake the grin that had taken over his face. He wished he had known earlier in life that you could tease people without being cruel.
He now came onto the question of how to send the bloody thing. Hermione was his best bet and would be the only one still up and near envelopes.
“Dick. Continue.” Draco made a pompous gesture with his hands to motion him to go on. Harry was delighted.
He rolled his shoulders and then took the lead into the building.
“Yes. But you can take the day to pack, have someone feed the cat, I’ll owl the paperwork and instructions to you and then you can be on your way.”
Draco smirked and tilted his head to one side. “I feel we will become fast friends, Fotheringham.”
“Honestly, nothing happens here. People go to work, they walk the hills, go out for a drink, people are happy…the rugby team is fabulous. Incredibly so.”
His mouth was open as he looked at the madness in front of him.
“Draco?” Harry gasped. He was moving forwards, moving on his knees to get to him.
“I’ll need the light brighter than that if you expect me to cook,” he warned the house. It was capricious and treated him more like a poor house mate that paid less rent and left the milk out.
Harry’s eyes widened and felt slightly horrified until Draco chuckled at the morbidity of his statement. Harry shook his head, “They shouldn’t have even been there, I was so stupid, Draco –“
It was a struggle not to roll his eyes at this man he had to call his boss. Harry had learned pretty quickly that Robards was more concerned with how things looked rather than doing the right thing. And Harry really wanted to give him a bloody thesaurus as all of his sentences began with ‘right’ or ‘let’s go’ and, worst of all, ‘Potter! Here!’
Harry turned and was immediately alarmed by the look on Draco’s face. He was smiling, that was certain, but the smile seemed a bit…well, manic to be honest. Grey eyes were wide and his smile tight.
He laughed breathlessly at the true absurdity of this moment. He was in Draco Malfoy’s muggle apartment, holding his face thanking him for being brave and questioning some wanker who was giving potions to muggles. It was one of the most bizarre moments Harry had had in his life thus far and a half-giant had once told him he was a wizard at eleven.
Draco said nothing for an entire minute. “No.” He said eventually. “I don’t trust him.”
“Kingsley – I’ll do this and then that’s me. I’m out.”
Harry strode over to Draco to send a signal for everyone else to fuck off too. It worked. The only one who approached him was Ron. In between organising the muggle’s memories being modified and then sending them on their merry way, he came over to them both. An odd look passed across his face as he surveyed them, his gaze eventually fixing on Harry. The man seemed to have developed his mother’s ‘what the fuck are you doing’ face and was using it full force right now.
“Yes, I hear the local team is really quite something. I’ll have to see it for myself.”
“Jesus, Bernard, is that good idea? I really don’t think the plumbing can handle it.”
“Can I offer you a drink before we do business?”
“Enough of your cheek, love or I’ll order two!” Bernard’s face split into a shit-eating grin and Draco knew the bastard was serious.
“And who am I sending it to?”
Most of the regulars came and greeted him like a friend; updating him, albeit at a high volume due to the music, about their love lives and local town gossip. He listened carefully intoning ‘oohs’ and ‘ahs’ at the correct moments. This was one thing he didn’t expect to enjoy about the job when he took it on. He found he actually enjoyed talking to people and seeing their face light up when he asked about their mothers or their children and how their dog got on at the vet. At first, he did it as it was a wise business move. His father always taught to be amicable and gracious when it was needed. The second part of the advice, the part where you take the information people entrust you with and use it for your own benefit, Draco ignores nowadays. But the conversations remain.
“You flatter me, Draco. But it seems that you are deceiving me.”
“Stop. You promised. Besides, there are worse scars to have.”
Draco began fluffing his pillows to keep his hands busy and away from Potter’s neck.
“Whatever for?”
“Er…Can I…what does she mean? She was talking about…about Skele-gro…what did she mean by that?”
When the tent was finally erected, he sat huddled around the small fire he had made and looked over the paperwork Kingsley had sent him.
Once inside, he dumped his bag and ate quickly, eager for the day to be over.
“Potter…please…. I work here…stop making a scene. This is a new shirt you know!”
“Connections? I’ve told you, I  have no fucking connections. I went to Azkaban, I’m on parole, I’ve lived here, with no one since it all happened. I barely speak to anyone from home. Jesus, do even read the newspaper? My father is in Azkaban, my mother barely speaks to anyone and the rest of them, the whole stinking lot of them are in Azkaban – where they should be. So you’re going to have to elaborate when it comes to asking me about my current connections.”
“Something like that,” Potter said.
“My god, you’re insufferable. You and your arse!”
“Oh please, I clicked my fingers – they think it’s a magic trick.”
“I literally can’t explain it another way to you. If you reverse it up that pathway, you won’t get it back down.”
“Really?” He asked again. “Nothing…weird?”
The manager had a friendly face and waved at Draco. Typical, Harry thought.
When they both went back to Draco’s flat that night, he declared that his life’s ambition was to continue working at the Cock’s Comeuppance, and no he would not change the damned name, and buy the cutest cottage he had ever seen. So that was how they found themselves house hunting in the muggle town that had brought them together. And if Draco had Confunded the estate agent into accepting the asking price then who was to know.
Ron walked into the room like some kind of guardian angel. “Ron! Thank fuck you’re here. That total wanker has sent Draco in with –“
He struggled with what to say. He couldn’t make the situation better and certainly did not want to make it any worse. Instead he settled for saying anything that would remove the pensive and contrite demeanour that had overtaken Draco. “Just as well you’ve got those long legs of yours then, eh? Or, you know, you could fly. You were fairly decent at that if memory serves.” He grinned up at him from his position on the floor.
Fotheringham’s voice was closer now, his breath could be heard in Harry’s ear. Almost as if he was there in person.
Harry was watching the scene a few feet away, jaw clenched.
“Sure. I’d go mad if we just left it here.”
“You did?”
“Yes, but he might recognise you, Draco.” Harry wasn’t sure how to properly word what he was going to say next but pressed on nevertheless. “I know you don’t get the Prophet here but you still feature in it from time to time. And your parents. Well, your father mostly but it wouldn’t be entirely out of the question for someone to know who you are.” Harry looked up at him sheepishly, concerned that he had just imploded the tentative friendship they had built over the past few days.
He leaned over, hands on his knees and tried to focus on his breathing, in and out through his nose the way the therapist that came in sometimes had told him. He supplied her with drinks in an array of colours and glasses and she gave him tips on how to remain stable.
“I understand and I feel that I have done that for long enough and I want out. I can’t do it any longer, Kingsley.”
“Ah,” Draco said eventually, “That was very naughty. You caught me!”
“Someone is breaking the Statute of Secrecy…by talking to muggles about wizarding things…but nothing else? No magic being used, or anyone being hurt?”
The smell of bitter flowers bubbled forth and things began to click into place for him.
Draco smirked. The irony of this woman who had worked all her days in a pub in which she drank more than that of her patrons being called ‘Temperance’ really tickled him.
It was gentle and terribly soft. Draco’s hands were shaking as he placed them on Harry’s chest and something deep within Harry seemed break open, promising a whole manner of trouble.
“Very wise, your friend.” Harry could tell that he was smiling.
Draco stood now and shook Fotheringham’s hand, a polite smile adorning his face. “If I were, say, in need of brewing something…you wouldn’t know of an ideal place to do this would you?”
“And why ever not?” The mirror asked hotly.
“Perhaps start from the top.”
“I can’t ,” he breathed, “Patil, I can’t – “
Bernard seemed bored of the conversation by this point and swallowed the rest of his Nipple shot. The smaller glasses were harder to configure so it was more of a tumbler full of Nipple. Draco toyed with the idea of calling the drink a Drippy Tit but didn’t want to appear entirely uncouth; just enough to be interesting and not disgrace his mother.
“Tonight, I thought it was over. My life here, my life after sentencing, just my…life. I thought they would arrest me, even if I hadn’t done anything.”
After he had been walking for a couple of miles he had grown frustrated and tired from tripping over god only knows what. He sighed gruffly hands on hips and surveyed the area.
As soon as Bernard was served Draco looked back at Potter who seemed to be concerned for Bernard and the drink he was about to consume. Potter should be concerned but not for the reason Draco was. Draco had learned not to argue with the man and his drink choices but anything with dairy did not react well with him for some reason and Draco just knew he was in for a night of Bubble Head charms and Scourgifying the gents afterwards.
There was a disembodied cackle from the other side of the bar. “You really are shite at this whole bartending thing, Draco.”
“Apparently.” Draco was distracted by his ice-cream dripping down his hand. He licked a drip from his finger and Harry had to look away.
Draco’s meeting with his supplier was odd to say the least.
It was a blur to Harry, a haze in which the only thing in focus was Draco; how his breaths came, how he fitted around Harry, opened for him. The sounds he made in Harry’s ear when his tongue grazed just below Draco’s jaw.
“You’re such a dick.”
“Harry?” Hermione’s face peered down at him from her desk, concern covering every inch of her face.
“Those dark circles – dreadful! What you need is some radishes. Dice them and fry them in a butter sauce…” She continued rambling while he washed his hands and then his face. When he turned to leave, the mirror coughed loudly to get his attention. “I can see that you are not interested in receiving any of my expert advice but…do be gentle with him.” His head shot up. Harry thought she looked rather embarrassed at having strayed for what seemed like her usual monologue of abuse. He nodded, thinking this was the simplest way to leave this conversation.
“I don’t know how to…carry on with you here. I can live with the banishment and exile and try to pay the price for what I have done but I don’t know how to act around you. After what I’ve done to everyone…to you. Maybe I don’t get to be around you.”
In his field, there was no such thing as coincidences. Simply connections; sometimes harmless, sometimes not.
He really was doing an excellent job at this. Smith seemed to be thinking the same as he looked very smug all of a sudden. Prick.
Even in the dark the scars were clear to see. He didn’t want to upset Draco, to spoil everything, but he didn’t know how he could just move on after seeing this, as if the lines weren’t there and instead was a smooth chest, unmarred by a moment of hatred and fear.
To have a drink called ‘Finnegan’s Fireball? Sure, it wasn’t that uncommon a name but paired with the other weird shit going on? If Harry found out Seamus fucking Finnegan was serving drinks and naming them weird shit, he would honest to goodness kill the bastard.
Draco was soft and warm clung to Harry, pressing himself against him wherever he could.
Draco threw him a baleful look and motioned for Bernard to come closer. He was already looking a bit green and had only had one dairy drink this evening.
When she had finished dabbing her eyes and had caught her breath again he looked at her seriously. “You’re not angry at me? I mean, he was an insufferable little wanker at school and then was an actual wanker the longer time went on…I know he hurt you. And Ron. I just…” He trailed off, not sure exactly where this though process was going.
“Anytime. What are you having?”
“He would. We’re talking about your hypothetical friend remember. This isn’t personal.” Draco attempted to sound imperious but came off petulant instead. It made Harry want to pinch his cheeks.
Draco sensed Harry’s trepidation and seemed to misread it for something else entirely. Until the doors opened and people started to trickle in he had been reassuring Harry that he really had nothing to worry about from the alcohol or the muggles. So much so Harry had to stop mid-rant on the fire safety procedure with a “Draco, I’m not worried about you.” This relaxed him a little and he went back to chastising Harry about the music he was putting on the jukebox.
“What? No. You don’t have another bed?”
The investigation was currently at a bit of an impasse. People thought he was some kind of English weirdo who had rocked up to their peaceful village and started asking questions about ‘weird things happening.’
He all but staggered to the kitchen, wondering if the alcohol he had had the last few nights had addled his brain.
“It’s what I do best, Sir.” He smiled and let go of the breath he hadn’t been aware he was holding. They made arrangements about Harry coming in and said their goodbyes.
“Why? It’s alright, we’ll catch the guy.” But Harry was hurriedly picking up his stuff and cramming it into his bag. “Harry,” Ron tried again, “Why do you need to go?”
Harry was perplexed. It had been so long since he had properly questioned someone while on the job that he was worried he had forgotten how to do it.
With a deep breath he dumped his back at the door and walked to him. Hands wavered uncertainly at his sides before he brought them to either side of Draco’s face. He looked incredible fragile to him then, pink lips wobbling slightly.
“I get it, Harry. I really do. But I don’t think just leaving is the best idea either. You are valued as an Auror but more so as public figure, always doing the right thing.”
Draco’s lip was bleeding and a small, poppy bruise was blooming on his cheek, dark under this light. It stood apart from the rest of his alabaster skin, glaring at Harry. Draco’s hands were tied to the chair and his hands were clenching and unclenching, continually pulling at the restraints. He was shaking his head in answer the questions being thrown at him and Harry someone knew him well enough now to understand he was more or less telling the truth; brows clenched together and lips downturned. He shook his hair out of his eyes and it seemed to wake Harry from his stupor.
Fotheringham looked delighted at this turn of events and clapped his hands together twice. For a second Harry panicked that he himself had been tricked and Draco was somehow more familiar with this man than he had let on.
Draco whispered in his ear as Harry prepared him. Sweet murmurings of,
Draco was stood in front of the van in an attempt to stop him from getting the bloody thing stuck at the back of the pub. He had to be sneaky when emptying the bins with magic, he couldn’t very well levitate them over this shithole of van.
He was lucky. In more ways than one. If the restrictions placed upon him had been any kinder it would have been cruel. He would have been forced to grovel and beg instead of being banished and forced to start anew. For this is what his punishment was: banishment. A large sign that said, ‘you failed here, try again somewhere else.’ But this was what pushed him. That, even when muggles stared at him strangely when he got confused about toasters or terrified of their little gas lighters they held too close to their faces to smoke…he was granted the opportunity to try again. When he was feeling selfish it didn’t feel like enough. On good days, it felt like a gift and one he most definitely didn’t deserve.
“It’s Dittany,” Harry said matter-of-factly.
“Sleep is for the weak.”
Harry took a rather large gulp from his pint and scratched his beard. It was a new addition to his look. He had finally gotten over the shock of seeing the bearded version of himself in the bathroom mirror in the morning.
Draco felt alive in moments like this. When the music was pounding enough to rattle the glasses on the shelves, people were smiling openly at him for they didn’t really know who he was, and he could forget himself. For those brief, sweet moments he forgot who he was, what he had done, and he was just some guy that worked in a pub and made interesting drinks. It was a part of every day that he looked forward to. Like taking a well-earned breath after swimming underwater: blissful and full of relief.
Draco’s jaw seemed to clench and he angled his face up to look him in the eye defiantly. “Or what?”
Potter was lying very still. The light emanating from the gaps in the curtains told him that he had his hands clasped on his stomach. It was strange to have someone in his bed, strange to share any space.
“The same way you know that he’s…up to something.”
Draco
“Who did you say your supplier was for this, Mrs Peterson?” Draco asked politely, smile tight.
“No, no, no…” The tallest of the two was saying, shaking his head vehemently. “That’s not the one that knocks you on your arse, it’s the Whomping Willow that does it.”
“Are they weirdly happy thought? As if they’ve been dosed?”
“True, but I think that it’s possible you represent hope for him. I mean, you’ve both hurt each other and saved each other. I don’t mean to upset you, Harry but he has seen a side of you that others haven’t. And maybe that’s enough.”
“I need to go,” Harry said thickly.
As Harry came to stand next to Draco, the man’s expression faltered slightly. “What’s this? A friend, introduce us at once!” He held his smile in place but his eyes roved about Harry’s face which immediately made him want to touch his fringe.
Three bowls of goodness knows what, were stirring themselves on the kitchen table until Draco began levitating them to the garden. “Keep stirring!” He called as he walked away, a huge block of ice trailing behind him.
“Rubbish.”
“I already explained why. There really isn’t anything nefarious –“
Harry rolled his eyes although Draco couldn’t see.
“Well that is good news. Anyway, my reason for you being here was not a ruse you should know. I would like to have your opinion on the stock and numbers for the next shipment you need.”
Again, this felt like flirting, but it had been so long he couldn’t be sure. “Positive.” Draco smiled properly now, with all his teeth like his mother taught him.
“Right. Course. I’ll get ready then.” Moving to stand up, Patil puts her hand on his.
It was dimly lit, most of the light coming from the back, obscured by what appeared to be rusted containers and shelves stacked with various bottles and random equipment.
The doorbell chimed from the front of the cottage.
“Look, just tell me what you want. I am being entirely honest with you,” Draco was trying to reason with him, imploring them to listen. It made Harry’s blood boil. “Just tell me.”
“You’d better have an idea of where I am going to sleep by the way, I’m not kipping under the bar.”
He had pondered everything from retribution, squibs unhappy with their lot to a resurgence of death eaters trying to manipulate muggles. For now, that didn’t matter. For now, he simply needed facts.
“Don’t be thick. Of course I don’t want you to go, we both know that I’m selfish. I want you around but I shouldn’t get to. I shouldn’t be allowed to.”
Draco returned Potter’s imperious look which was much more effective: he’d had far more opportunity to perfect the act of being a twat.
Harry took his hands from Draco’s hips and instead cupped his face. “Draco – look at you…nothing in the world would make me want to be anywhere else.”
Wow, that’s…impressive. May I?”
He was halfway up Main Street now and decided to drop into the shop for something to eat. Exhaustion creaked in his joints from walking about all day and sleeping in the bloody tent with the terrible mattress, if you could even call it sleep. He seemed to toss and turn for hours and then when he did drift off it was to dreams of horcruxes and snakes and black, swirling robes.
“Exactly, would you look at the state of it!” He sat up now and dramatically turned his head for Harry to see apparently see something he didn’t think was there.
Harry stopped in his tracks. “Wait, what if…what if it’s not a weird accident and potions aren’t being someone mixed up and in the hands of muggles what if someone is living here under the guise of being a muggle.”
Harry touched his hand where Draco had held it, warmer than the rest of his body, and caught up with him.
The shop was small and slightly stuffy, the smell of lavender and herbs wafting around the room and seeping into every pore. The person serving was a very petite woman, she was currently rubbing some ointment on Draco’s hands, rubbing the cream down to his fingertips. He had his head stooped to view his hands and the cream, smiling gently, and nodding at the woman. She was clearly enamoured and Harry had to refrain from rolling his eyes. It was no wonder the git loved living here, he was adored.
“Really? You need to ask me that? I came to you – years ago – and told you that what they were having me do was ridiculous and you said it would be temporary, Kingsley and temporary it bloody well was not. I mean it’s pathetic. Surely you must see that. The embarrassment of it. Of being paraded and handed round for photos, not able to properly do the job I wanted, was good at and trained for. But, no, you told me to hang on, for you, to help you out and I think I have done that and I am not doing it any longer. Its humiliating. After –“ He felt his throat catch dangerously and he tried to reel himself in. “I think, given my history, I should have been treated like the Auror I wanted to be, could have been…but I was never given the chance. And I’m not saying this to make you feel sorry for me or anything like that I just – I want it to stop. Now.”
He laughed wickedly and resumed lying on the bar, blond hair sticking to his forehead.
“Draco…you made mistakes in your past, we all have, but I think anyone that knows you now can see that you’re different. You’ve paid – are paying – for those mistakes.” Harry found that he believed wholeheartedly in what he was saying. He wasn’t sure how he had come to this feeling so quickly but it felt true to him nonetheless.
The most basic things he thought he would need was stuffed into a rucksack and he had made a short trip to Ron and Hermione’s to borrow the tent that had been both a blessing and a curse during their horcrux camping trip around Britain.
“No. I – I want this. You don’t even know how much but I want – I’m okay, Harry. Really. Despite…everything.”
The minutes ticked by as he waited for Ron to come back and give him some kind of news. He had made for the door twice to burst in and demand what was going on but feared it would distract them from whatever was happening and put Draco in danger.
Epilogue
“I’d like to celebrate with a mate though.” He sounded awkward and Harry scolded himself for being a total arse.
Harry’s hands were on him trying to see where the curse had hit him, where the blood was coming from, there was so much of it, so much it couldn’t be possible.
“I’ve told you that’s not a thing.”
“Huh?”
He looked at Draco and thought of the nights they had spent in the same bed, telling each other things, how Draco said his name, how he had felt when Harry held him, came inside him and the stag left his wand. It wasn’t happy, per se, but it was strong.
“I see. It is only midday though, we’re not opened yet.”
He began walking back down the path towards the village.
Harry laughed properly this time. “I’ve had better. Some blond git had me terrified and pacing in a hospital waiting room.”
The book was less horrifying however and Harry felt the familiar swooping sensation as he was swept into the ministry.
“How did you swing that? The town is packed for the upcoming games.”
“Draco, no one else can see me. It looks like you’re talking to yourself.”
“You’ve never watched them?”
It was dark but they could hear voices near the back of the warehouse, too muffled to hear any one of them distinctly. There were crates everywhere, piled high and ready for shipping, their destinations scribbled across them carelessly.
“Hi,” Draco whispered.
Harry could feel the spark of heat in his gut that he felt every time they went toe to toe. It was exhilarating, stupid and too damn tempting to pass.
“I can’t sleep either,” Draco said into the dark.
Zacharias Smith was standing in front of Draco and firing a number of questions at him. He was stood only a few inches from Draco, far too close to be appropriate in Harry’s opinion. Smith had a couple of inches on Draco and seemed to enjoy using this to his advantage. He was smiling cockily as he asked him questions appearing to delight in Draco’s hunched shoulders and downturned gaze.
Draco sounded less than ecstatic at this assessment.
“All I have done since I left Hogwarts is play things a certain way. It is never been the way I have done things  but I allowed it because I thought it helped and maybe it did in a way but I don’t owe the ministry anything and I am not playing the game like that anymore. Being here and doing something important has given me the shake I needed. I’ll come to the ministry to submit the memories, I will talk to the detectives and then I am leaving to return here. The Aurors you send can continue to tail him or collective evidence, whatever, but I will be coming back to finish this.”
“Okay, firstly, you need to stop reading Sherlock Holmes and watching ‘Clueless’ at the same time – you’re getting them confused. Secondly, I have notorious bad luck, if you’ll remember every one of my years at Hogwarts ending in disaster.”
The following day began uneventful. He tried his best to simply blend in and go unnoticed. Mostly he listened to inane conversations that would bore him senseless if he were not on the job. Occasionally he was privy to village gossip which was mildly amusing, and Harry had to hide smirk as he listened to a younger couple moan about their neighbours, the owners of the shop he was in, having loud sex in the flat above them only to smile and wave as they came to the till.
They were then led through the winding corridors as last time but instead of heading for the basement they arrived at an office.
Forest. A forest was where they had sent him. He could hear the distinct sounds of humans nearby and was reassured that he had arrived at the correct place.
Harry’s stomach took a dive but he refused to flinch or look away from Robards. He held his mouth tight, eyes narrowed.
“I…didn’t think I was allowed to call you…Harry.”
Draco knew he was fortunate now, however. Fortunate that he had only served a few short months in Azkaban. Fortunate that, rather than snap his wand, the Ministry had only restricted him from Apparating and using any form magic considered uncouth by polite society. And being refused entry in every wizarding job had stood him in good stead. He had left England, everything he knew, and moved to a small village in Scotland. Not too far from Hogwarts that it could still feel like home. Where the people were direct but friendly and their lilting voices washed over him like a balm.
“This is so weird.” Potter eventually said.
As he turned to look away, he caught eyes with one of the women whose gaze was turned towards him. A small smile brightened her face as she looked between himself and Malfoy.
An owl that morning from Kingsley’s assistant had asked him for updates and he attempted to big up what he had discovered already. Yes, he had heard weird things going on, no he didn’t have the source yet and would keep him updated with new information.
“And what’s this one called?”
Harry looked around wildly for him but when he spotted him he was holding down of them men and gesturing wildly away from himself.
Draco’s voice sounded hesitant now.
Slowly, so as not to interrupt anyone’s dancing or set his hair on fire with the sparklers he made his way to the only empty table that was positioned just in front of the bar. Gingerly, he sat down and tried to refrain from looking shell-shocked.
A Patronus, some bird Harry couldn’t quite place flew passed him and through the door. It came out a few seconds later and Marion sneered at it, her lip curling. It was an unusual look for her usually kind face.
Harry stepped forward, a need for Draco to understand his point pressing on him. He cupped Draco’s face between his two hands. “No, you did beautifully. You were confident and brave and clever…” Draco gulped. His tongue darted over his bottom lip. “And, we got lots of information from him. You can submit your memory for evidence and we’ve got a good case. I couldn’t do this without you, thank you.”
“I have a bed, Potter.” It occurred to him that it perhaps wasn’t the best idea to rescue his ex-nemesis from a forest and then invite him into his bed but he was going with it now.
Harry still wanted to fixup Grimmauld Place but, for now, this was perfect. He was away from everything that had caused him to wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and instead was currently living a peaceful existence. Well, as peaceful as a person could live when living with Draco.
A memory of Ron trying to call him at the Dursleys at the beginning of his third year came rushing to him. Harry’s heart picked up a couple of notches.
Red robes littered the streets of the small, quaint wizarding village. The press were being kept at bay, like a huddled group of vultures they strained their necks to take in the scene. They had clearly been tipped off, no way that word of mouth could have travelled this quickly, despite them circling overhead of every misdeed the ministry partook in.
His hands were on Draco, in the sea of red that was trying to drown them both. Harry’s hands were on his chest, trying to compress the wound but he couldn’t see where it was. His clothes made it hard to tell.
Draco’s heart thudded in his chest. He usually tried hard to not think about this. To deaden the notion that he had a life different from the one he was living. That he was no longer welcome home despite being homesick.
“Patil and Jackson – you’re going to cover the exits. Patil – pay particular attention to the roofs, I know how good you are with an Incarcerous from a distance,” he nodded and smiled at her then turned his attention to Harry. “You and I are going to attempt to ward the perimeter –“ when Harry began to interrupt he held up a hand patiently, “And then we will go in through the back, take stock of the situation and, fuck it, decide from there depending on what we see.”
Cautiously he stepped round toilet to stand at the sink and have a good look at the mirror. The sight that greeted him was, well, odd. He could see his reflection, tired looking and a bit scruffy from his recent adventures, but the frame somehow resembled a face. The bottom, with its golden curves, were pinched at the sides and held in shape strikingly similar to a mouth. Harry suspected the top righthand corner was a raised eyebrow.
It was the first time he had heard Draco say it since the trials. His voice was bland, unaffected. It held no emotion either way and was another change in Draco that added to  the conflicting emotions Harry held for him. Rather than being slighted he was acquiescent. Accepting the punishments with understanding rather than anger.
“Pass.” Harry said, not looking up.
Harry drew his eyes away from the street and looked to where the Auror  was gesturing. A small, blue door stood proudly at the back of one of the cottages. Houses were overrun in the sea of crimson and supposed criminals inside.
“What if…what if he can’t use a phone because he has never been used to using one before? As in, what if he was brought up without them?”
This began the thought process of who, at Hogwarts, knew Seamus and knew enough about muggles to first survive in a muggle village and had a decent understanding of pubs and mixing drinks. He tried to name as many muggleborns or half-bloods he could think of that would possibly fit the bill.
“Ah, that.” His shoulders relaxed and he slipped back into his imperious tone. “Yes, Potter is currently living with me. He’s investigating apparently. Entirely clueless, I tell you, thick as he ever was.” Draco took delight in verbally bashing Harry a little and Fotheringham nodded along serenely. “Anyway, he’ll be on his merry way before long.”
Draco tried to smile but it probably looked pained.
“Oh aye, was that after my second or third bottle of whiskey?”
“Hmm, pity.” Long fingers drummed on his stomach impatiently. “I feel like we should have gotten somewhere by now. I mean there’s two of us, we really should have made some headway at figuring out who could be slipping muggle teenagers acne potions. Which is, by the way, fantastic. I used it religiously for almost three years.”
Smith’s face fell and a bright flush accompanied his ruddy complexion. He walked past Harry and muttered ‘prick’ under his breath.
“Am I…what? No, I’m not the police.”
“Ready.”
Draco’s eyes drifted slightly to something going on behind Harry and then everything changed.
“I can’t hear you! What did you – oh for fuck – BERNARD! Turn it down a decibel, will you?!”
“Ah, well mainly because they treat him like a show pony. But more so because he doesn’t enjoy it anymore. He’s done enough of catching bad guys and it’s time to leave that behind because perhaps…” he inhales sharply at this next confession, “perhaps he is good for other things than conquering evil and doing what everyone wants him to do.”
He looked up at Harry gravely. The lines of his tired face betraying his age and his energy. “There’s been funny things happening, up in the north of Scotland.” He said this matter-of-factly and Harry was thrown by the bizarre direction the conversation had went.
“Why are you naming the drinks after wizarding things?”
Pushing the drink forward he smiled smugly.
When he had shifted to get himself comfortable, he turned his head slightly to look back at Draco.
Thanks again for reading everyone! If you feel like it, leave some kudos or a comment - it keeps me going!
His room was in an unusual disarray from his lack of desire to clean it, tidy it or really do anything in it besides toss and turn on the bed pretending that he didn’t have insomnia.
“Different things. I can’t Apparate without requesting permission – fair. I am forbidden from using anything beyond the most basic spells – understandable.”
As he caught her up on the case, she eventually twigged that he was being vague on some important aspects. “So you’ve been working closely with him then? With Malfoy?” Her face appeared nonchalant but judging by the way her eyes continued to dart sideways at him he knew she was dying for more details.
“Yup, apparently there is. Some idiot has been opening their mouth and blabbing to muggles about stuff they shouldn’t. We’re not too sure how far spread it is. So, we want to send someone there, find out what’s happening, give them a talking to and then modify the muggles’ memories who have been affected.”
Fotheringham hummed in response. “But you seem to have wonderful relationships with these muggles, I’m afraid they see me rather as an oddity. An eccentric. You have clearly ingratiated yourself towards them.
By the time midnight had come and gone Draco was stomping upstairs to his cramped flat and cursing all men with green eyes and great arses to hell and back.
Withdrawing the parchment and quill to write to Pansy, he resigned himself to the heavy feeling in the pit of his stomach. He smoothed the parchment with his fingers, enjoying the cool feeling on his palms. Picking up his quill he thought about the best way to respond: to grovel or not to grovel.
“It’s over now.” He kept his voice low.
The men turned to look at him, distaste written across their features.
“I know but we were both there. Nothing is going to happen, it wasn’t your fault. We’ll look into it so it doesn’t happen again. Everything’s alright, we’ll –“
As soon as Draco opened his mouth to speak Potter stood up abruptly and announced his departure. Draco was left staring after him and trying not to look at the bastard’s arse as he walked away.
Draco sat up slowly and looked at him with sincerely. “Potter…did you…did you just give me…a…compliment.”
Draco peeked inside the basket and saw an assortment of breads and pastries, his stomach grumbled. Harry had fobbed off breakfast this morning in what Draco saw was an attempt to not put anything near his mouth lest it get him in trouble.
“…and then, when I am on the verge of giving up, you will explain in full detail how you knew who it was right away as they had dust on their boots that could only be from one place –“
“Aye, aye.” A hand was waved from beside the jukebox and the music quieted a little.
“What did you mean earlier?” The question seemed to bounce around the room and Draco was thrown by it.
“Remember, if you need back up send up red sparks and then request backup.”
“Well, I want to say that he’s perhaps a bit thick but he’s too slimy for that.”
“You are much too thin, Draco. Now, tell me about your visitor that you’ve got there – the one with the nice arse.”
“It’s okay. You don’t have to –“
Thanks for reading!
“Harry, will you be a total darling and fetch me some more of that new vodka that was delivered this morning? It’s the disgustingly pink coloured stuff we got today. I’ve completely ran out since the golf group at the back keep bloody ordering the Pink Dolores.”
Grey eyes drawn wide, a look of mild horror swept across his face as a high pitched scream tore through the air behind him. Harry’s hand went for his wand immediately, the thought for the amount of muggles that filled the room not crossing his mind in that instance.
The high chiming sound of glass transfiguring back into its original form snapped Draco out of his thoughts. Sighing, he drew his wand and properly got to work. He felt he had done well to be able to do so much by hand but it was a relief when he was finally alone and could do everything by magic.
Draco looked at him, confusion written clear as day on his face. “Um…I’m not sure actually. I don’t believe they specified.”
“Right, let’s go.”
“Eh?”
“Draco, I mean it, I’m going with you. I don’t trust him. it’s too dangerous for you to go alone.”
The next hour was a blur with Healers Apparating into the pub, muggles fainting at the sight, Aurors coming in and fixing their memories.
Harry closed his eyes and inhaled deeply in an attempt to not scream. He stepped forward into Smith’s range of sight. Smith froze when he saw him and smiled weakly. Harry clenched his teeth and mouthed quietly, “I will fuck you up.”
Draco seemed tireless, however. He continued serving with an easy going attitude and unwavering smile that Harry did not think was possible for him. Charm unwavering, he poured drink after drink, offered a smile, and explained the bizarre menu to newcomers. ‘No, it’s called a Lestrange Liquor. Think Pina Colada but with more rum and extra fun. You want two?”
The man’s hands went to his throat and he got in Draco’s face. “Don’t you fucking speak to me like that, you filthy, inbred little bitch.”
Morning brought a cool breeze and thick clouds as the sky awakened, casting them all under her shadow.
The golfers were keen and cheered as he brought the tray to their table.
A huff left Malfoy’s mouth and he sat back in his chair and crossed his arms. “Fine. You think I’m up to something. Follow me around for as long as you like. Stay in my house, have breakfast with me, sleep in my bed, come watch me work and I’ll show you that nothing is amiss. I shall even throw in  tour of the town.” His chin, still pointy Harry was pleased to see, jutted forward in defiance. Malfoy was challenging him.
“R-Ron what’s going on?” Ron looked seriously at him as if contemplating what to tell him. “Please just tell me.” His voice was verging on pleading.
It took less than a second for Draco to realise he had made a grave error. For under the beard and wild hair was a pair of eyes he would recognise even if blind and an expression that was brought out for him and him alone.
“I just don’t understand this thing.”
He thought of holding Draco between his hands the other night. His palms damp from tears and heart confused but delighted. “Expecto Patronum.” The stag erupted from the end of his wand and people screamed.
The final pub was the farthest away from the rest of the town, hence why he had left it until last. His eye could just catch it at the bottom of the dark street, not even the streetlamps touching it with their hazy orange glow. Harry could hear music faintly emanating from the windows that were cracked open.
He hung up and Harry waited anxiously to find out the other end of the conversation he had just heard. “Fotheringham?” Harry asked.
So as Dolly blared from the jukebox, Draco mixed drinks and threw bottles into the air and smiled, graciously the way his mother had taught him to and flirtatiously the way Pansy had chastised him for.
Heaving it from under the bed, which was harder than it looked, he took out the cloak and began to roll it up. His clothes were everywhere in the room. Draco, while being fairly particular about mess in every other room of the house was fairly lax in here. A towel hung over the door, laundry was unfolded and sitting on a wooden chair at the desk. Mixed in with Draco’s belongings however was Harry’s stuff. A book he had been reading on the bedside table, boots in the corner of the room, a stray shirt lying on the bed next to Draco’s pyjamas. It looked as if he had been here for a long time. As if he belonged here.
“Hiya. Mental this, eh?” A lopsided grin painted his face.
Harry drew in a shaky breath, “And failing that?”
The street was empty, so he thinks it’s safe to add couple of glamours to his appearance. He makes his beard a bit scruffier and grows his hair long enough to tie it up. When he looks enough like himself to still feel comfortable but different enough to not be recognised right away, bar his eyes of course, he heads into the pub.
He checked his watch. One more hour. One more hour and then he could stop pretending for the day.
“Goodnight, Draco.”
“I don’t ever remember you even having one spot.”
Draco huffed a laugh, “Then you’d better be quick, Potter.”
They had been careful with each other this morning. Not distant but polite and wary as if waiting to hear blame or admonishment from the other. It pained Harry. He wanted it to be simple. To come out and say,
“Yes, you practically run this shitehole anyway, I’m hardly ever here. And I’ve told you to stop calling me Tempy. Temperance, my name, will suffice.”
A man, shorter but broader than himself, stood there with a thunderous look on his face. It did something to Draco’s insides and he felt himself squirming under the man’s gaze.
Smith was frozen between picking up the charmed quills and parchment and staring at Harry with growing horror.
“Shortbread?” Draco said with a quirk of his lip.
“Ironic? Ironic how?”
“Oh, Harry you’ve got to be kidding. You can’t send your boss a letter you’ve written while drunk, it’s irresponsible!”
Harry is making his way over to the shop assistant with a small gas cooker in one hand and something he isn’t quite sure of in the other when a conversation stops him dead.
“…exactly, exactly. So, I staggered to the bar, practically paralytic at this point, and I asked him what he would recommend, and you know what he comes back with?”
“This is the team that’s supposed to be amazing, right?”
Draco ran a hand through his hair and then immediately fixed it.
Tempy grabbed her coat from the pathetic looking coat stand and with a wave back at the bar stomped out the door.
It’s busy tonight. This is mainly because he said last week that all green drinks were half price. And most of his drinks were green, being that old habits die hard and such.
Grey eyes found his right away and he found his heart breaking all over again at seeing the tentative smile Draco held for him.
Standing under the hot shower he replayed the conversation they had. He really should be more careful. The last thing he wanted was to be in front of a committee for being weird with muggles, his record was bad enough that they would ship him off to Azkaban right away.
“What is this? Who are you? Are we being burgled? Thieves! Good heavens, leave me be!”
“Or you know, you’re the golden boy and you’ll just luck out and Expelliarmus their arse to oblivion.”
“I don’t know what you want me to say to you, you were a child –“
“Do you like blonds, Harry?” He sounded serious but Harry could see a glint in his eye.
“Hey, hey, hey ,it’s alright. It’s me.” He held his hands out. The man in front of him looked like an animal caught in a trap. One that, if pushed to it, would gnaw its way out if necessary. “Just a dream.”
He supposed that was why many of the more eccentric locals took to him so kindly. He didn’t batter an eyelid and someone wearing stuffed birds on their head; wearing an assortment of creatures on one’s hat was common place in the wizarding world.
“Let’s get closer.” Harry took off toward the pitch, heading straight for the coach.
“You can.”
He smiled with teeth this time. “Did she mention how dehydrated your skin looks?”
Harry had a hard set to his jaw. Kingsley nodded slowly. “Alright. But you’re not finishing this investigation on your own. Whether it is fair or not, you don’t have the experience and others do and they will be conducting the investigation in full. I will, however, allow you to remain on the case to assist since you know the town well by this point.”
Draco raised a hand to rub the back of his neck and the tail of the snake on his left arm could be seen, the inky black stark against his pale skin. Smith caught it as soon as Harry did. The smile on his face turned cruel and Harry decided to intervene before he said anything that would ruin Draco from the growing confidence he appeared to be rebuilding.
Ron nodded solemnly. “Yeah. Might do the same. Have a quiet one.”
“Harry,” Draco deadpanned. “You’re talking to me, working with me, you’re in my bed.”
When the floo died out, Harry arranged the cover back over it and turned to see Draco eyeing him curiously.
The garden was looking slightly wild as they hadn’t gotten around to trimming much yet but it did have a free-spirited feeling about it. Harry had been instructed to hang up some lights and lanterns while Draco had transfigured almost every piece of furniture they had in order to provide enough seats.
“I still don’t – what were the terms?”
“What’s the point in that? I’ll only be gone a couple of hours to hand over our memories and then will be heading back.” Kingsley shifted in front of his floo and didn’t meet Harry’s eyes. “Right? Just a few hours?”
“Potter…I know we’re…that’s just…we’re not that far from the fucking Forbidden Forest and you’re camping in the bloody woods.”
“Nope. I mean they’re not that new an invention are they? Every time he calls, I have to talk him through how to use it. I think I am the only number he has to be honest, seems like he doesn’t get much practise. I usually write to him in order to prevent the ridiculous conversations like that.”
It was an exhausting thing to do, constantly compare himself to when he was younger. His younger self was a prick and unless everyone was doing his bidding, he would have thought himself unsuccessful.
“It’s – I’m not sure…could be possibly something with Deadlyius because of the quick reaction time and the smell.”
It really was a beautiful room with an elegant chandelier and baby grand piano. Its purpose was for entertaining guests but Harry thought it served just as well in a ‘drink your feelings and feel depressed’ type of situation too.
personal, just more nostalgic).
“It’s quite alright Mrs”, Oliver stopped and was met with a hard stare from Lily before continuing, ”…
Hermione continued, “I just think that…I think it would be a good show of unity. You know? Like, we’re putting things in the past. Moving forward.” There was the determination he knew.
Harry went back to his room but couldn’t stop thinking about the incident. His mind kept turning over, what was Draco crying about? Draco Malfoy didn’t cry…
“Well, I always said – a seeker is nothing without a good keeper behind him.” As soon as James made the comment Sirius let out a laugh he had been holding in for far too long. Harry shot him a death glare before his father commented “What? What did I say…?”
“But she said no…we started divorce proceedings one month into the marriage – Scorpius was born six months later, then she left. She left without saying anything – just took off.”
Oliver moved in and kiss Harry. This kiss was different from the one inside. This one wasn’t sweet, it wasn’t due to a mistletoe – this one was purposeful. Harry felt this kiss with every fiber of his being.
Harry was starting to piece things together. “Oh….”.
Harry just nodded and watched the boy he liked rise from the fire and run upstairs. Harry decided to wait so they wouldn’t cross paths while up there. He found himself staring into the fire and crying.
any longer. Draco noticed Harry quickly look away from the kiss.
He stood outside the wizarding bank and looked around. The city was still struggling, even a month after the war. Diagon Alley was a shell of what it once was, but it was trying. Many businesses were beginning to re-open. Several being opened by new owners, since the originals either died during the war or simply were too afraid to come back. The rest of the world seemed as if it was trying to move on; Draco thought it best if he tried too.
Draco tensed up at the thought of acceptance, “It’s definitely not accepted across all of the wizarding world. I imagine the Weasleys are okay with it because they have seven children, so if one is gay it’s no issue. There are six more to carry on the bloodline. And Dean isn’t pureblood so…” Draco was growing heated and hated himself for it. He was projecting way too much into this conversation. He didn’t even know the Weasleys or Dean’s family. It was wrong to make these assumptions.
He even went to Hogsmeade with Oliver and he helped him pick out new gloves for the upcoming match against Hufflepuff. Harry and Oliver were slowly becoming…friends? Well, they were kind of friends before, but this was different. Harry and Oliver in the past had been more like…Oliver and his much younger teammate, Harry. But now the four years didn’t feel like so much. This felt…equal.
“Oh…um, sorry Oliver. Or…Mr. Wood?” Harry didn’t know how he was supposed to address him now.
they were together.
Draco agreed without hesitation. The two were set to leave one week after graduation.
or anything, but he didn’t really have anyone else to talk about some of the things with and decided his godfathers were probably his only option. When he finished, he couldn’t help but notice the look of concern and pity on both of their faces.
“Yeah? You’re sure?” Harry nodded in affirmation before grabbing Draco once again for a kiss.
“Good morning to you too” Draco smiled because he honestly couldn’t help it.
Teddy screamed a loud “Ha!” before continuing, “Nope! Blueberry with chocolate and hot fudge!” Teddy seemed proud that the man had gotten it wrong, but the wizard just smiled again.
He made one final stop at his family’s secret vault in the cellar of Malfoy Manor. He took out the money and held it in his hands, studying it. He knew he needed to convert it to muggle currency and didn’t really know how much it would be – but whatever it was, it would have to be enough.
“Bye Mr. Draco! Bye Scorpius!” the boy turned to look at the younger boy “Maybe Harry will let us play together some time.”
That’s how he landed in front of his current cottage. He remembers being dressed in dark pants, a button-up navy-blue shirt, and the most worn-out looking shoes he owned. This was as dressed down as Draco Malfoy got in those days. He carried nothing but some muggle money in his left pocket, and his wand in his back.
In the beginning of their breakup, Harry went to the astronomy tower every single night. Part of him knew Draco wouldn’t be there, but just being in their space made Harry somehow feel whole. But in the past month, he forced himself to stop. He tapered off. Three times a week, once a week, once every other week….and now, never.
Harry fell asleep that night with thoughts of blonde hair dancing in his brain and was awoken at 6 the next morning to taps at his window. A rather posh looking bird stood outside nearly tapping its foot in impatience before Harry opened the window and took the letter. The bird stood still, and Harry figured the letter needed a reply.
This couldn’t be good.
“Based on your father’s expression, I don’t think this is the end of this Draco. But it’s a start.” Harry moved to hold his boyfriend. Before moving back towards their class.
Harry and Teddy arrive at the Manor for a play-date and learn a little bit more about what's happened with Draco since the war.
on a mission to find the child, Harry Potter.
The meal dragged on, Draco eating more than he had in two years. Night fell on the cottage and as he was about to get up to light candles, he watched Harry look up. And just like that, the lights in the cottage were on.
After the night of October 31, 1981, Lily was always protective of her son. When Sirius and Remus first started taking Harry to their house for sleepovers, they had to promise to be careful with him and to not let anything happen to him. They promised Lily that when Harry was with them, no harm would ever come to him.
“Ah, I see. And I trust everything went well?” At that moment a rather sleepy looking Draco came into view. He was wearing what Harry could only consider to be his version of ‘lounge wear’ – a loose fitting t-shirt and dark bottoms. Harry had a sudden surge to reach out and see what material they were but fought against it.
Draco continued, “Harry. We’re drunk and this is really fast. Our kids are literally down the hall…” Harry knew these were all valid points but still hated how much he wanted to keep going.
So, that’s what he decided to do. Before going to bed after speaking with Ron and Hermione, he wrote to Draco and explained everything just as Hermione had said to. He even asked if they could meet again.
“You asked if I wanted to talk about it! If I knew you were going to be homophobic about it, I would have kept my mouth shut!” Harry stood to leave and noticed that he wasn’t as drunk as he was before – but still nowhere near sober.
happen?” Hermione asked and Harry began to explain the events of the night, the drinking, the doorway, the…
When Draco and Scorpius arrived at Grimmauld Place, Harry forced his anxiety down. Thankfully, Teddy hadn’t brought up Draco and his ‘relationship’ since last weekend, but Harry was still having a lot of thoughts and feelings about the possibility. When Draco and Scorpius came into the house, Harry found himself staring again. Merlin, that man can really walk into a room.
Draco stood and hesitantly opened the door. It definitely wasn’t his father. Instead, it was Harry Potter. A rather flushed and breathless Harry Potter, but a Harry Potter, nonetheless.
they must have cost a small fortune. When Draco noticed Harry staring, he took it as an opportunity to be his awful self, “close your mouth Potter.
But word traveled fast. Harry Potter was now The-Boy-Who-Lived. Word of his name began to travel through Wizarding communities around the world. As his fame spread, Lily and James decided to shield their son from it as much as possible. They wanted their son to grow up with a normal childhood (or as normal as he could). The family was together, and everyone was safe; that’s all they cared about.
The next morning, the rumor-mill was working in overdrive. By the end of breakfast, it was very much known that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were an item. The specifics surrounding the couple varied widely. Some heard the truth – they had been found shirtless and making out. Others heard they were caught in the boy’s restroom having sex. And some even went so far as to say the two were running away together… Regardless of the
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione boarded the train they started to search for a place to sit. When they neared the end, they opened a carriage only to be met face-to-face with a rather obscene image of Ginny and Dean.
As the two walked side by side, Harry couldn’t help but notice how much the man had changed in the past four years. Professional Quidditch suited him… His chest and arms had filled out more and Harry noticed a beautifully even tan spreading across the man’s exposed skin.
“Well, I don’t know. Pansy won’t shut up about being a bridesmaid and Crabbe and Goyle keep fighting over best man…” Ginny was trying to give all the information she had.
“He said I could possibly be…bisexual. Or something.” On that Harry looked up at Draco who was definitely already staring at him.
seen me in a Quidditch changing room.” Did Oliver Wood just…wink at him?
speak to him. Harry turned to look at his mother whose eyes had followed her husband out the room before looking back at Harry.
“I, uh, I should get home. It’s pretty late.” Draco began to move towards the front door.
“Draco! Listen to me!” Draco rolled his eyes once more and found Harry was still following him up to his door. He stopped just short of the porch and looked around at the house. “Is this…is this where you live?”
Harry tore his eyes away from the man and back down to the two boys in front of him. One, obviously being his godson still pushing down tears and staring at the other little boy. The other, a smaller boy (likely younger), blonde haired with grey eyes – like his father, Harry thought. Neither of the boys spoke and so Harry moved them to the side of the shop and knelt down.
“These aren’t sleep robes Potter, it’s just a robe. And it’s actually quite expensive, I’ll have you know.” Draco hated himself.
Draco was gone for what felt like forever. How long could this letter possibility be? Harry couldn’t eat and just moved food around on his plate while watching over the boys.
“Oh, I’m not going to go. Just too much right now with…everything.”
When she looked up and saw Harry, she rose elegantly out of her chair and greeted them, “Mr. Potter, so pleased you could join us at the Manor.”
Harry couldn’t believe what his life had become.
“Harry…” Harry heard Draco’s voice and looked up to see his family (woah, his family…he liked that) looking up at him.
It figures that just as he has something he’s always wanted, his father is still here to take it from him.
And Draco quickly realized he felt…nothing.
and deflate when he turned to see no one there.
Harry was awoken in the morning by very loud banging coming from downstairs. The wake up was jarring and he took a moment to gather his surroundings before turning to reach for Draco.
“Harry…is Mr. Draco going to be your…partner?” Harry was thankful he wasn’t drinking a beverage, or it would have just come out of his mouth.
“That’s…that’s exactly what I wanted…” Scorpius seemed surprised by the wizard’s response. The wizard simply smiled and looked at Teddy.
“Yeah – I’m happy for you! It’s great! I’m sure your dragons and your co-workers miss you loads.” Harry knew his voice was way too high pitched but couldn’t bother to care. “Wait. Have you told your family?”
Harry was surprised by the reaction, “Oliver… you made me happy too. And if Draco didn’t exist…” Oliver cut Harry off before he could continue.
Hermione and Ron shot him back a smirk, “Of course mate. I thought that was obvious. It’s kind of the same with you. I mean I didn’t know
Charlie didn’t know what he was expecting, but it wasn’t a thank you. Charlie had grown fond of Harry, but he always knew he would be going back. “Harry, we made it clear in the beginning what this was. We both knew I would return to Romania sooner or later. We discussed this…”
“He’s my goat, Potter. He’s kind of…attached to me. And it seems like it’s going to rain soon, so he’s probably just scared and wants to come inside.” Draco stood to let the goat in.
Draco’s eyes went wide but he stayed silent.
Harry waited several seconds before responding, and even when he did – it wasn’t with words. He moved towards him and closed the small distance that sat between them. He pressed his lips to Draco’s and wrapped one hand around his head. Draco tried to fix his shock and respond back, and quickly found himself pressing back against the man on his sofa.
“But Harry, I don’t think Dean is interested in men…” And there it was. A fact Harry knew, but hadn’t wanted to really think about.
“So talk to her. Or better yet, take her out that way she’s less likely to cause a scene.” Honestly, Harry was less concerned with Astoria causing a scene than Draco – but he wasn’t going to say that. “Let her know how you feel.”
Thanks for everything?! Really Harry?! That’s what you want to say?! Harry screamed at himself inside his head but made sure that his face remained neutral.
“Of course you knew! Why didn’t you tell me?”
By the end of the conversation, his mother was crying. His father just kept looking back and forth between Draco and Harry.
He turned to look at his boyfriend and found him already staring at him.
These were the thoughts going through Harry’s head as he sat at breakfast one morning with Ron and Hermione. In an act of deja-vu, Ginny approached the table with her usual, “Did you hear the rumor?” except there was no excitement in her voice. Instead, she sounded…torn. And she looked directly at Harry.
“Not that world, Potter! The wizarding world! I live on a muggle farm! I don’t use magic! I raise goats for fuck’s sake! That isn’t my world! No one in the wizarding world needs me for anything, Potter. As evident by the fact that literally no one has bothered to look for me for the past two years.” The rain was pouring harder and harder and Draco noticed that Harry was inching closer and closer towards him as he spoke. “Oh – right, until Precious Harry Potter comes looking for me. But that’s because he bloody needs me to play detective and help him solve his pitiful case!”
“Draco! That’s ridiculous! You may have done some bad things, but you aren’t a bad person. Trust me, I know bad people. I killed one and I’ve been hunting them for the past two years. I wouldn’t have spoken for you if I thought you were a bad person.”
He loved Christmas dinner – all of his favorites would be made, and he would sit at the table with his mother and father. All happy.
“Harry, earlier you called me…Harry. Why did you stop?”
“Draco…” Draco looked up from the spot on the table where he had been staring and nodded.
“No, I completely understand. Take your time. I wasn’t ready either – I’m still not ready for it all to be out there if I’m honest. I think that’s why I let mum think what she wants and I keep living so far away.”
Harry arrived and looked up at the large house. He knew he had been here before, but he didn’t want to think about that. He decided to try and act as though this was his first time at the house.
He wanted so
Scorpius and Teddy shrieked before tearing out of the room and back into the playroom.
He places one hand on Teddy’s shoulder, “There there – it’s alright. Accidents happen. What’s your name?”
“Oh. That’s probably just Billy.” Now, that look. That’s the look Draco liked from Harry. One of shock.
reached for Draco’s hand when they walked down the hall. He always showed up to the astronomy tower first and he always made Draco feel like the most important person in the world.
“Not exactly…Hermione said she already ‘had a feeling’…whatever that means.” Draco smirked, that girl was too smart sometimes. “She just said we needed to be careful. She actually agrees with you about not going public yet.” Harry looked up at Draco and smirked.
of an adjustment it was.
The other man apparently didn’t feel the same way. Draco watched as Harry’s eyes looked him over rather slowly before his mouth began to speak, “Um, I was instructed to invite you to breakfast.” He said as he let out a yawn.
“Wait wait wait. I have to say bye to Scorpius and Mr. Draco.” Why was this kid so polite?
Draco and Harry are enjoying their time together, but things with these two can't always be easy...
liked this Draco. He also began to realize that this was a very different feeling than what he had with Charlie. He and Charlie were, for lack of a better word, physical. They had begun physical and remained physical. Harry’s feeling towards the man evolved because of their closeness and the intimacy they shared. Draco, on the other hand, hadn’t even tried to kiss Harry. And yet, Harry could feel himself falling.
Harry honestly thought Draco was joking, so he agreed to it. But now that Draco Malfoy is standing outside the Burrow in tight Muggle jeans and a sharp black crew neck, Harry understands it was not a joke. Draco looked…amazing.
This was going to be an awkward dinner…
parents, and godparents that loved him unconditionally. This was going to be a great year.
“Yeah, you seem…better.” Harry looked as if he didn’t want to bring up Draco’s father either.
“No, I wanted to tell you first and…well, in private.”
“We aren’t…together.”
Harry went silent again. He knew he owed it to Draco to give him his whole self. He also knew, as much as we wanted to deny it, that he probably wasn’t ready to commit to Draco. Part of the tightness in his chest still belonged to Charlie.
“There’s been suspicious activity happening in small muggle areas in Scotland and Ireland. The work seems to be dark magic and we have reason to believe Rowle is gaining followers and attempting to terrorize local muggle villages.” Draco could see Harry’s passion as he spoke, but he wanted nothing to do with this.
One of his favorite parts of his childhood was when he and his parents would go to the Weasleys’ home, the Burrow. The Weasley family were also part of the Order of the Phoenix and fought alongside Lily and James during the war with Voldemort. The fact that both of their families survived the war brought the two closer together.
Draco watched as the Dark Lord spoke to him, but he couldn’t feel his body. His hands had gone numb and his brain went blank. He tried to listen as instructions were given but had tuned out a majority of the information. He didn’t snap back until he heard Voldemort say, “take the dark mark”.
After about a month of living in the cottage, Draco finally had to go into town. He needed to figure out his food situation (having gone through what the old man left behind). It was in town that he found out he lived in Lancashire and that the reason so many sheep lived on his land was because he was technically supposed to be a sheep farmer.
Harry finally moved through and went to get Teddy. The boy protested as he tried to take him home but subsided once ‘Mr. Draco’ agreed they could come back again next Saturday.
He still walked around with a strong sense of arrogance and pride. His dress robes for the dance were immaculate. Harry looked at them and

“Harry…are you okay?” Hermione wore her ‘comforting friend’ voice well.
Harry had seen the man, he never changed. He always wore all black robes (similar to Draco’s in fourth year – immaculate, cost a fortune) and carried an intimidating walking stick. His hair was the same color as his son’s, but he wore his long and allowed it to frame his face in a way that made him look even more intimidating than he already did.
“Draco…we still need to talk.” Draco shook his head as he felt a raindrop hit his nose. He looked up and noticed dark clouds starting to form.

talked about it. Draco talked about healing the way Hermione talked about books, but unlike with Hermione, Harry found himself listening. Also unlike with Hermione, he found himself looking at the way Draco’s face and mouth moved as he spoke.
“No. Um, not that. I just didn’t know you and Draco were…real.”

Oliver moved his eyes to meet Harry’s and continued, “I like you Harry. I like you a lot actually. And I’m willing to wait for whatever this is with you and Draco to be done, but I’m not going to be the person you sleep with before eventually getting back together with him. And I know this is partially my fault. I shouldn’t have pursued you – I should have waited. And I
“Harry, why are you crying?” His son looked at him with the most pitiful look.
His father’s voice became angrier, “No. Draco – what are you thinking about? Are you thinking about a boy?”
“Oh! Dear! So sorry!” They heard the voice of Leona Greengrass and they broke apart quickly. Harry felt embarrassed but noticed irritation on Draco’s face and felt the need to smirk a little.
Draco remained silent. He didn’t exactly know what was going on, but already felt uncomfortable being with just the two of them – he didn’t need to put his foot in his mouth to make things worse.
He stood up in a trance and walked over to the window and grabbed the letter. He opened it and found familiar handwriting –
When Harry was 9, he started to develop questions. He decided to go to the smartest person he knew, his mother.
Draco thought he had stepped too far when the room turned silent except for Ron who turned red and said, “Oi! Please don’t talk about that when you’re dating my best mate! I don’t need to know what he knows about Weasley…parts OR Malfoy…parts, thank you!” On that the whole room erupted into laughter just as Harry descended the last stair and entered the living room.
“Well, you are quite good at that. Do go on.” Draco gave a half smile that was returned.
“Drop it, Potter.” Harry put his hands up as if to signal he was indeed ‘dropping it’. They continued the rest of the way in silence.
He opened the box and found a small, white card. It looked kind of like the ones he collected as a kid that he would find in the boxes of chocolate frogs, except this one didn’t have as many colors or embellishments on it. It had the face of a man who was moving and information below that read:
Draco was taken aback by the sudden change in conversation, but decided to entertain the question, “Well, Potter, it’s the best way to meet guys.” Harry’s eyes widened. That’s not what he was expecting at all.
Draco, that’s stupid. He’s in Azkaban. Open the door.
By November Harry was starting to feel like his old self. He found himself more focused on his classes and with the help of Oliver, more focused on Quidditch. By now, he knew Oliver was out-right flirting with him. Oliver wasn’t shy about it and Harry liked that. Oliver seemed to know exactly what he wanted. Harry.
thing I saw you doing in your room?” There was no missing the tone in his voice this time.
They walked in to find a bleeding Scorpius and a terrified Teddy.
It was exactly one month after the war. Draco Malfoy was on trial for his involvement with the death eaters during the war and he was fully prepared to accept his fate. He was in a terrible place mentally, and he secretly hoped for the Dementors Kiss – rather than just a life-long stay in Azkaban.
Before the tears could hit, Harry ran. He ran all the way up to his dorm, where he intended to stay for forever. Forget classes. Forget friends. Forget…everything.
Charlie went slow and made sure Harry was comfortable and would enjoy the experience (however uncomfortable it might be). Harry became fixated on watching the way Charlie’s arms moved while he was on top of him and loved watching Charlie’s eyes open and close while he was inside of him. The sounds Charlie made were amazing and he felt he could listen to those sounds for the rest of his life. Wait, that was a dangerous thought. Harry wanted to remain focused and allowed himself to take in every moment of the experience.
“Draco, we can continue this conversation tomorrow if you’d like.” Draco nodded. It was all just a bit much to take in. Harry got up and started to make his way towards the door.
. Draco pushed and pushed at these dreams – plead for them to go away. Took shower after shower and erased them from his memory, but after his 15
he was supposed to respond to that, so they continued their meal in silence. And Draco strangely enjoyed it. He liked having someone here to eat meals with, even if that someone was Harry Potter. He also appreciated that Harry didn’t seem to have any interest in bringing up the whole ‘you have to come back’ thing again. At least…not right now anyway.
“Actually, they’re traveling this year. So it looks like, for the first time in my time here at Hogwarts, I’ll be part of the stay-back group.” Harry couldn’t help but hear the sadness in his voice.
“Okay Teddy. I think it’s time for us to go home now.” Harry rose to usher his godson from the table.
“You were! You were pining! That’s how you know I like treacle tart!” Harry was excited to put it all together. It made so much sense…
“Salazar Slytherin!” Harry Potter stood over him by the fire – also shirtless and in his pajama bottoms.
“I’m sorry Harry, so much has happened and I’m going back to Hogwarts – you’re staying here. It’s best if we remain…friends. And besides Harry, I don’t think you and I had the right feelings for one another. I’ve thought about this quiet a lot actually and I think I always loved you more than you loved me. And that’s okay. I’m not upset about it…well, not anymore.”
“Sorry…I just…”
Enjoy!
Yet another thing that had changed – Ron. A week after the final battle, Kingsley Shacklebolt (the new Minister of Magic) offered auror positions to Harry, Hermione, and Ron. Only Ron accepted. Hermione insisted that she would finish her final year of school and McGonagall agreed to let her take her NEWTs courses via owl. Harry didn’t know what to do and so decided to do nothing. Ron, on the other hand, quickly took Kingsley up on the job and soon started training. Every day of training was another day of Ron gaining confidence. The auror offer combined with the events of the battle left Ron more sure of himself. This was something that was
Draco pushed back against Harry and Harry kept kissing. Draco couldn’t help but think how
(See the end of the chapter for
Well, mostly everyone.
“Yes. We’ve moved into the Burrow shortly after I got custody of him and needed the help…greatly. But we moved back to Grimmauld a couple of years ago and it’s just us now.”
Draco’s eyes widen, “Your sure? This is a big step, we don’t have to…”. Without hesitation Harry responded, “yes”.
That was it. The boys were done. Scorpius was nearly on the ground from excitement and Teddy’s hair had already been changing colors, there was no stopping it now.
As he passed a boy’s lavatory, he heard a familiar sound. He took a deep breath and pushed the door open. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting to find, but a drunk Draco Malfoy crying on the bathroom floor certainly wasn’t it. Harry quickly surveyed the room and saw the bottle of Firewhisky in Draco’s hand as well as Draco’s school uniform completely wrecked. This, usually perfect boy, was a complete mess and slouching on a bathroom floor.
“Well, here you are. Everything should be in there. If you need anything…” Harry paused and looked right at Draco, “…just let me know.” The two men stood in another doorway, feeling the tension rise.
Draco quickly noticed the crowd that was gathering around them and grabbed Harry by the arm and threw him into an empty nearby classroom.
Draco opened his door with no robe and began to venture down to the common room. Once there, he found the fire already going and Harry sitting in the same spot as earlier – back against the sofa, feet to the fire. Just sitting and staring into the fire.
“No, I do. I need to. That first night in the bathroom was the first time Blaise and I got into it about you. He had seen us staring at each other during meals. He had been watching us for a while, I guess. I was scared. I didn’t think you’d want me and so I didn’t want to lose whatever it was I had with him – even if it was just hooking up. I told Blaise he was crazy and that you and I were enemies, but I knew he didn’t believe me. I went to that bathroom to…force myself to get it together. Just to quit with you.”
His parents tried to shield him from the rumors surrounding him. Some in the wizarding community felt he had to be even more powerful than Voldemort, even as a child, and therefore could possibly be the most powerful wizard there ever was. Others were afraid of him. What if he ended up being the next Voldemort, but worse?
Draco knows exactly who he needs to talk to...
on dates (albeit not in public), and he liked when Draco would stay over.
A comfortable silence fell upon both men as they continued to sit at the table together, each finishing their current glass. Harry eventually decided to go back to bed. He had a lot to think about and with his glasses of Firewhisky knew that the minute his head hit his pillow he would be out.
“I – I don’t mind. I get it…don’t want to be mauled by your adoring fans. Probably for the best anyway, I think I saw one of the boxes leaking something that smelled an awful lot like a love potion.”
Draco didn’t want to think about this too much. He had no intention of ever helping his father, so there was no point. He would just need to figure something else out. Something that didn’t involve helping his father nor Harry or him getting killed.
“A date? With…Draco?” Ron sounded surprised.
And now, there was no one.
He looked at their worried faces and continued, “Look. If it goes horribly, then fine. We will find him the best damn lawyer in all of wizarding London. But…what if I can talk to her?” Harry noticed Hermione still wore a look of concern.
Upon arriving, Harry just simply was not prepared for the “fans” he would have upon entering the school. It seemed like people couldn’t get enough of The-Boy-Who-Lived. He found people staring at him during classes and at meals. Sometimes people would approach him and ask for an autograph. He never really knew how to respond to these situations, so he just politely smiled and said, “no thank you”.
Harry let out a timid ‘yes’ and looked down at the table. Shit – it wasn’t good. She still planned to take Scorpius. Harry hadn’t done enough…
Harry never lied to Teddy and he wasn’t going to start now.
When the day came for the match against Ravenclaw, Harry was all nerves. He tried to focus on the game but kept distracting himself by finding Oliver in the stands – smiling. When the match was over and he got the snitch, Harry descended on his broom and met his team with yells of triumph and hugs.
As he stood, he heard Draco whine. “Help me up Potter! You can’t just leave me like this.” Harry extended his hand out and Malfoy took it – hoisting himself up in the air. The two walked towards the door to the bathroom, “See you around Potter” Draco winked and stumbled out and began to walk towards the dungeons.
Harry poured them both a glass of whisky before taking a seat at the table with Draco.
Which is why his Gryffindor spirit came out and he decided to be daring and take Draco out on a proper date.
“That’s fine. You don’t have to say anything. Let’s just have our normal day. We can keep taking this slow. Lunch?”
“Well, that’s good…What about Weasley?” Harry gave him a look and Draco corrected himself to “Ron”.
“Thanks?” And there Harry was, smiling at him again.
“He – he knows I have a son. And he knows I was married before…but I didn’t think it right to tell him all the…
The two finished their meal and Draco began to clear the table and head back outside. He once again found Harry right behind him as he began to head out the door. Great, this was his life now.
“You’re…you’re not? But I thought, I thought he came to your house for Christmas. And rumor has it that you were kissing him on the Quidditch pitch last month.” Harry turned to look at his friend.
Draco Malfoy had a strained relationship with his father, Lucius.
Dean, being the sweet man he was, asked “…is it to a boy…or…a girl?”. Without missing a beat, Hermione and Ginny spoke at the same time.
“You’re welcome – do you want to talk about it?”
“On what…?” Draco said calmly, but Harry knew internally he was dying.
anything. But now, he’s with Harry. And now she wants him back… Draco might lose his son because of Harry.
Harry responded and they continued back and forth until two days before Harry’s birthday. Harry had written to Draco about it several times and they had discussed ways in which Harry could handle the situation (some actually helpful, others not so much – like Harry parading around in his “birthday suit” and showing Charlie “what he was missing out on”, definitely Draco’s idea).
so to speak. So
Astoria’s face grew cold, “I left because I couldn’t be near you. All I wanted was a family. The family
But when Draco arrived in the Great Hall for dinner on Sunday, he was met with a much smaller group – Hermione and Ron. He assumed, and hoped, Harry and the girl Weasley were just running late and took his seat anyway. He didn’t want to imagine the reasons
Harry led his godson from the table and began down the street. As they walked, Harry’s mind began to wander back to the ice cream shop. Draco Malfoy seemed…different. Kinder? Definitely gentler. Honestly, he hadn’t seen or heard from the man in seven years.
Harry stayed downstairs with the boys and watched as they played.
Harry moved in to kiss Draco and made sure to put as much feeling into it as possible. He felt the other man return.
All clothes eventually found their way to the floor and positions changed to where Draco was laying on his back in his bed. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry and the two continued before Harry pulled back, not enough to break out of Draco’s embrace, but enough to look at Draco’s face completely.
about Oliver being in his home, with his family, for Christmas. Harry changed his clothes three times that day before he finally heard a knock at the door.
“Our situation, Dean? It was one kiss. You didn’t like it and that was that.” Harry couldn’t help the bitterness that was rising in his voice. For some reason, talking to Dean and hearing Dean’s
“Uh – huh…and what did she say?” Harry was growing anxious.
Draco looked at Harry for a long time before responding, “Will you come with me?”
Was Draco Malfoy…flirting with him?
Harry had supported himself and Teddy with the money Sirius left him in his will after the war, but once he moved back into Grimmauld – Harry knew he needed to have a job. Something to occupy his time and his mind, but also something that allowed him to be home with Teddy a lot.
is what they were talking about and shot back quick. “And this is besides the point, what the hell Draco? What’s going on?”
“It’s really no bother. I was getting one for Scorpius any way.” Harry stood in the doorway as the blonde man attempted to get around him. Harry moved out of the way and ended up chest-to-chest with the man as he moved past on his way to the shop counter.
to tell his parents about Draco. Draco made him so happy and he loved him. He wanted to share that with his parents, and he knew if he did then they would be able to talk him out of all these terrible thoughts he was having about Draco’s lack of communication. But he also knew how his father felt about the Malfoys…
Draco caught himself quick, “No – no I don’t. Not at all. But I’ll do whatever you want. Like I told you Harry, I’m in this. I like this.” Draco gestured between himself and Harry. “I don’t really mind it being out. I know it’s going to cause a lot of people to be unhappy, but I don’t really care… I’m happy. We’re happy. And it’s been seven years…people will need to get it over it eventually.”
"Right, well. That's fine, then. Um. You see. Longbottom. These past years I've been a terrible bully. To you. And I also joined a terrible cult. And did terrible things. So. I'd like to apologise for all the terrible things I did that may have affected you, directly or indirectly. That's all. Good day and let's never speak of this again."
Or maybe it starts, more than a decade ago, in a child's nursery in a large, lonely Manor in Wiltshire, England:
Unfortunately, his mind had interpreted this to mean that it was safe enough to unclench as well, and all the thoughts and feelings that he had been keeping away behind his Occlumency shields came rushing out in full force.
"How about this? 'Don't let the slithering snake into your robes!' Bahahaha."
"I suppose."
Now, though, despite her unease, Hermione had a look in her eyes that Harry knew all too well. It meant that she was going to the library and come hell or high water, she would figure out what was going on.
Pansy huffed. "Well, you would be too, if mermen had been oogling
It was going to be marvelous. Draco went to sleep that night dreaming of castles and swords.
Pansy was trying to talk to him and he nodded absently at intervals to show that he was listening, but everything she was saying had been going in one ear and out the other. His inattention must have dawned on her, because she used one hand to take his, and the other to grab his chin and force him to look at her.
"Still holding that grudge?" Draco replied, amused.
Though Malfoy made that bloody difficult too, because he wasn’t terrible to look at. His chin was still pointy, but it didn’t look ridiculous like it had when they were children, and paired nicely with his sharp cheekbones. He had stopped slicking back his hair and it looked soft to the touch. Not that Harry wanted to touch it. Though there was no getting around it: Malfoy was fit as fuck, with his trim Seeker’s build.
“Luna, those are just fireworks.” Hermione said gently. “The muggles like to set them off there.”
At her words, Draco could feel the betrayal of his body beginning: his eyes felt too hot, his nose too stuffy, and he could feel a sob rising in his chest. He shook his head violently to dispel it. He refused to let anyone see him shed tears over his father. The Great Hall was the worst place for a breakdown—he would be unprotected on all sides and the whole school would see and know his heart. If he let them see him vulnerable, he was inviting the curses and the mockery and the disdain. Most of them still believed him a Death Eater deserving of Azkaban, and crying over the death of another Death Eater would only solidify that in their minds, never mind that it was his own father.
Draco nodded, numbly.
Harry was
"What?" Harry laughed, "I didn't even say anything!"
It was hard to love a man who had taught you to hate, who had not stopped a great evil from using you, and who had committed great and terrible acts of evil himself. And yet, Draco could not say that he did not love his father.
That had sounded better and far less rude in his head, but it somehow got Potter to quirk up his lips in a ghost of a smile, so Draco counted it as a win.
He was rewarded with a small smile. "No, not everything. Anyway, enough sentiment for the day. Who must you talk to today?" Pansy asked.
. It was a terrible thought, but it wouldn’t leave him.
He really was trying his damnedest to get over his Malfoy obsession but it was impossible when the git was going around the school throwing out apologies left and right and generally acting like a decent person. Harry had learned during one of his weekly teas with Andromeda that Malfoy also had weekly teas with his aunt, where he managed to play with Teddy without remarking on his less-than-pure blood or his werewolf father.
“You’re a stubborn git, Malfoy,” Potter said exasperatedly, but it sounded a bit fond. Draco considered this briefly, but a sharp pain from his ribs reminded him that he had more pressing matters to attend to. If Potter had any sort of friendly feeling for Draco at all (and Draco rather suspected he did, though only Merlin knew why), he would be amenable to helping him.
on him. There would be another boy, the same age as him, with a lightning scar, and they would be the best of friends.
It starts like this, on the first night of their first term of their eighth year:
“I-I don’t understand…I’m so confused Draco. Help me understand. How do you go from loving
There were others reasons he liked the idea that Draco was gay. It freed his mind to play some of the ideas he had been creating since the beginning of term. And that night, with the curtains of his bed drawn closed, Harry reached down into his pants and allowed himself to indulge in some of these ideas.
James Potter had talked about the Malfoys a lot as Harry grew up. After Voldemort’s defeat, many Death Eaters escaped and were never found, but some were captured. Lucius Malfoy was taken into the Ministry of Magic but used the defense that he was under the Imperius Curse and therefore did not know what he was doing. He swore that if he had known, he would not have been a part of any of it.
“Yes, but why are they two men? Ron said that it isn’t normal.”
Harry was sitting on the sofa when his godfathers came to sit in the armchairs across from him. He felt this made it look like an interrogation and also felt that was likely what was going to happen.
His father…
be sorry she didn’t come back? She tried to offer you up to Voldemort like a piece of centaur meat.”
“Oh! Is that so Teddy? What’s his name?” Hermione put her ‘mom voice’ on and knelt down to the boy.
“Oh, you mean the Death Eater and the Golden Trio – sharing a meal.” Draco heard the sarcasm in his voice and hated himself for it. He really didn’t mean to be rude. It just…happened sometimes.
Harry hesitated. He couldn’t tell his friend what was going on with Draco. They’d try and stop him. They’d tell him it was a bad idea and to just move on. So, he lied.
“I definitely did not think you were serious about coming…” Harry said shyly.
He thought back to that time on the train before first year. He thought about Draco extending his hand to him. He was actually incredibly rude to Draco – Draco had offered his friendship and Harry turned him away for what? Something his father had told him? Harry loved and trusted his father, but his father’s opinions were of Lucius…not Draco. And who’s to say his father was right…?
As Harry was becoming more comfortable with the idea of his sexuality, he allowed himself to not only be
Harry let out a breathy, “Um, yeah.” Before smiling and looking back at Draco, “Yeah – definitely bisexual. And I definitely like you.” Draco smiled back.
“Harry, if it will make things better for you, then tell your parents. Just be prepared for a not-so-accepting outcome at first. They love you so if this is real like you say it is, then they’ll support you eventually… as for the lack of communication, people do get busy Harry. It’s possible he’s just…pre-occupied. I wouldn’t worry about it just yet.” Once Remus stopped speaking, he and Sirius got up to hug Harry.
about how “beautiful and perfect” his first time had been.
When Charlie walked through the door the whole Weasley family crowded around him, like they usually did. Harry stood off to the side. He wasn’t interested in talking with Charlie. He wasn’t interested in partaking in the “family joy” at the moment. Even though it had been over a month since he had last seen Draco, he found his mind wandering to him several times throughout the day. He had even purchased him a Christmas present in a moment of emotional turmoil when he was in Diagon Alley last week.
“Married?! That’s ridiculous! We’re 17!” Hermione sounded outraged.
“What was I supposed to say? I had been trying to drop hints! She wasn’t taking them. She just kept talking and acting like we were going to be together forever. But my heart wasn’t in it anymore…” Harry grew quiet, “we should have never gotten back together…the war changed people.”
But he also knew, it was the right step. He wanted to get back to magic, to his family, to his friends…to Harry.
He marched up to the cottage and found it still inhabited by a much older muggle gentlemen who took pity on Draco. Draco explained that he had left his family and was looking for a fresh start. The man explained that his wife had recently died, and he was trying to retire to France and live his remaining days with his grandchildren. Draco offered him all the money he had. The man smiled, and that was it.
“Hermione. Please, just leave me alone.” Hermione backed out of the room as quietly as she had entered. She wanted to help Harry, but also knew he needed time to himself.
“Yeah, I can’t even imagine…” Harry once again trailed off and the two sat in silence.
Draco. This is the same Draco. Right? He had just changed…or maybe he was always like this, but we were too busy in the middle of a war to see it?
Luckily, this only went on for a week before everyone became slammed with work before winter holiday.
When everyone at the table shook their heads, Ginny continued, “Yeah, I heard from someone on the Ravenclaw team that Draco Malfoy’s been DUMPED.” Harry couldn’t help but wonder if that’s why Draco had been so upset the past few weeks. Maybe he and Pansy had been on the rocks for a while.
“I see…well, if this is what you think is best, then I’ll support you. You know that.” Draco looked up at him and gave him a half-smile.
Draco felt this was the time to speak, “Um, you kissed me…”
“That’s not the point Seamus. And besides, that’s an offensive word. I think we’re all just…surprised is all.” Harry couldn’t believe his ears. Dean had just defended Draco and reprimanded his best friend in the meantime. He looked at Harry again and gave a small smile. Harry had no idea what to do in return.
Harry's still in his room and refusing to leave, Draco is looking for alone time, and a letter from a certain someone contains concerning information...
The second term flew by quick. Their schoolwork was increasing with difficulty, but that just meant Harry and Draco turned their last night activities into study sessions…followed by activities. Most of the school had gotten over seeing the two of them together and by March, all whispers and stares had stopped. Blaise continued to be a nuisance, but Harry figured he must have given up on Draco because he too eventually stopped glaring.
he needed them to watch Teddy Saturday night, he knew it had to happen. So, he arrived at their house on Thursday evening, Teddy in tow.
Harry was excited for exams to end and was mentally preparing himself to head home when a sight stopped him dead in his tracks. Harry, Hermione, and Ron had been eating in the Great Hall when Harry heard Seamus let out a whistle. When Harry looked up, he was met with seeing Dean and Ginny Weasley holding hands and kissing. Any ‘feeling better’ he had previously felt was gone.
Draco didn’t know where he wanted to go exactly, but he knew he wanted it to look
“Draco, I wanted to say I’m sorry for the way I handled things the last time I was here. I’m also sorry that I never wrote you back. I read every single letter you sent me. Most of them I read multiple times. I ran because I was scared. I knew you were right; I wasn’t ready. But all I kept thinking to myself was that you didn’t want me and didn’t want to be with me. I hadn’t allowed myself time to actually process all you had said.”
“Thanks…for the water.”
“That doesn’t make any sense. I didn’t even know I was bisexual back then. I couldn’t have been flirting with him. He was just…up to something. And I needed to figure it out.” Harry tried to defend himself but knew it was likely useless.
That was the end of their conversation. But it certainly wasn’t the end of Hermione. She continued to sit there for the rest of the day and came back every day that week. She never spoke. Just pulled out a chair, sat down, and took out her books.
“Harry…he wants you to get him out of prison. And if you don’t, then…I don’t know what, but something is going to happen.”
“Ah, Mr. Teddy! My most loyal customer! What will it be today son? Triple chocolate raspberry? Strawberry vanilla custard?” The smiling wizard behind the countered peered down at the young boy.
“Yes.”
The night before students were set to return, Draco sat at his desk and repeated this mantra to himself.
“Uh, yeah. Oliver. I know. He walked to the pitch with me.” Harry tried to say it as if it didn’t matter.
Harry stood up to leave. Draco didn’t move. Harry gave Draco once last glance then took off up the staircase and Draco heard his door shut.
Draco cleared his throat and decided to just let the words flow. “I – I do…like guys, that is. Um, I….” Draco was stumbling over the words he thought would simply ‘flow’ out. “I’m not sure what to say…”
. It had been a difficult decision, but after nearly a year since the Battle of Hogwarts, his family was moving on. George was far more than capable of running the shop on his own. His mother
But an addendum to the letter came exactly two weeks later that was specific to only Draco. It discussed the new rooming situation for eighth years – a separate dormitory, away from the other houses. It included the rationale that they were now too old to live with younger students and it was proper that they were given autonomy with their age. The separate dorm would have fewer students and all of the Slytherins in his year had expressed they would not be returning. The dorms would be two students to a room, but Draco would be given his own room.
“You haven’t asked a question Potter.” Draco was now sounding too cocky, but Harry could still see that there was worry behind the mask.
“Any time Mr. Potter. I expect I’ll be seeing more of you.” She gave Harry a quick hug and left the room.
Teddy sniffled into his shirt sleeve before responding, “Teddy”.
, but enough for Ron to get the idea. Like Hermione said, Ron was fine with it. He was just upset that Harry felt he couldn’t talk to him about it, but also understood it was his brother so…
The rest of Draco’s day seemed to drag as he kept waiting and anticipating what Harry’s friends would say. He played every scenario he possibly could in his head as a way to brace himself for whatever Harry came to him with this evening.
hook-up.
“17 years ago, my son was nearly taken from me. An evil man walked into this very house and rendered your mother and I useless. I thought I would wake up to find my entire family murdered…”
“I think…I think I like you too.” Harry said the words as soon as he realized them.
Draco took a breath and continued, “I was having a hard time accepting who I was, and I wasn’t ready to be ‘out’, but by fifth year I was annoyed by having to pretend and decided to pretty much just own it. Most of Slytherin house knew by then, but you know us, we keep our business to ourselves. Well, mostly…” Harry and Draco both thought to the incident from this morning. “But, that’s how I ended up with Blaise. I liked him because he was attractive, available, and discreet. I loved feeling confident about it for myself and I didn’t mind my house knowing, but I wasn’t interested in hearing
Harry reached out his hand to take the ice cream as he followed the younger boys to a table outside the shop and sat. He took his first lick and was once again in shock. It tasted like…treacle tart.
The two made their way down the aisle of the train until they found an empty space. Not too long after sitting down, the train started to move, and a young witch appeared at their door. She introduced herself as “Hermione Granger, muggle-born. But I already know loads of magic!”. Harry and Ron gave each other a concerned look but allowed the witch to sit with them. They were actually terrified of what would happen if they didn’t.
Draco got up from his chair and moved towards Harry. Harry stayed sitting on the bed and looked up as Draco came closer. Draco put his hands behind Harry’s head, resting on the back of his neck. He motioned for Harry to move back a bit, then straddled him. Still looking down, he moved in to kiss him. Draco pushed further and made the kiss more heated, pushing his tongue to open Harry’s mouth and going in when Harry opened.
This is why Draco was disgruntled when his routine was interrupted by a knock on his door at 8am. He pulled his hand from his pants, grabbed his robe, and moved towards his door hoping the robe was enough to hide the proof of his early-morning activities.
“I know…I know he does. But this is Scorpius’ home, Astoria. This is the only home he’s ever known with the only parent he’s ever known. And he’s happy. Like, truly happy. I’ve never seen a happier boy, other than my own godson perhaps. And he worships the ground Draco walks on.”
Harry found himself stretched thin trying to balance his schoolwork and his role as Quidditch captain. The Dean situation was starting to move on, but Harry still felt a small pit of jealousy when Dean would walk Ginny to Quidditch. Often, Dean would say a quick “hello Harry”, before walking away without a reply from Harry.
This sudden change in scenery changed Harry’s mood. The anger left his body and all of the sadness he had felt for the past three months hit.
“Merlin Potter – what woman wants to be with a gay bloke? Huh? And like I said…it’s complicated.” Draco’s voice was tense.
Harry told him the full story. He knew his father would be able to tell if he left out any parts.
Scorpius was still rather sleepy, but looked up with excitement, “Is Teddy here too?”
It had been one very long week after Harry’s party. One week since Charlie and Draco had argued. One week since Charlie officially ended things with Harry and one week since Harry (stupidly) tried to kiss Draco Malfoy.
His immediate concern was Draco. They had discussed not going public for the past several months and now here it was – out in the open.
As soon as they walked in, Teddy began telling them all about his sleepover last weekend. He told them about Scorpius’ cut and all the games they played. “Yeah, and when we woke up Harry and Mr. Draco were already there. They made us breakfast!”
“I – I think I’m gay.” Harry looked down as he said it and refused to look up.
“Oh, so you think I’m cute… Interesting.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Okay – I think these compliments are getting to your head.”
But Harry didn’t love him. And he knew he might find love for him later, after spending more time with him, but he also knew this was a childhood crush. And most people never have a chance with their childhood crush, so maybe he was just trying to live-out some fantasy world his 11-year-old self had created.
Luckily, he didn’t have to wait long. Draco’s reply came the next morning and it carried with it an offer to meet in Diagon Alley the next weekend. Draco needed to pick up some equipment for his training and they could have lunch.
Draco was right about his father’s trial. Harry was not as generous as he had been for Draco or Narcissa. As a matter of fact, Harry Potter refused to speak on behalf of Lucius Malfoy altogether and instead gave over his memories of the man from the past seven years. More than enough to convict.
Taken aback by the question, Harry stared at Charlie. “What? Did I say something wrong?”
The next three months were a series of dates and ‘sleep-overs’ that alternated between Malfoy Manor and Grimmauld Place. And Harry loved it.
He began to panic.
“I wrote some letters and spoke to a few of my old Quidditch connections. Anton is one of the premiere coaches in the league right now and he’ll be looking for new recruits for next season. He’s coming to Hogwarts in two weeks to see you play against Ravenclaw. He’s interested in you.”
Harry couldn’t even imagine what that must have been like. And to raise a child on your own when their mother is still alive. What’s Draco going to do when Scorpius gets older and starts asking questions? What’s he going to say?
“I don’t think we could have gone somewhere with MORE people. Look around, there are thousands of people here!” Harry smiled and placed his hands on his hips.
“No Scorpius, I’m sorry Teddy isn’t here. Could you give your father and I a minute to talk?” Harry looked from the boy back to Draco.
They worked side-by-side for a majority of the afternoon. Sometimes in silence. Sometimes in mundane conversation. But it was half-way through the re-painting that Harry finally decided to speak about what he apparently came here to talk about.
interest in Dean Thomas. It was all becoming too much to ignore.
When Draco walked into Hogwarts on the night before his first day of classes, he wasn’t met with the shocked faces he had expected. It seemed everyone knew he would be returning. He was, however, still met with whispers and stares as he made his way into the Great Hall for the sorting ceremony. He listened as Headmistress McGonagall gave a heart-warming speech about the ‘trials and tribulations you have all experienced as a result of the war’ and how ‘we will be striving to mend the broken relationships and prejudices that have developed as a result of this war’ and on this she made a quick look towards the near-empty Slytherin table.
“You were right. And I’m sorry. You deserve so much more than to be someone’s… ‘rebound’.”
you’ll find someone new later…and maybe he’ll be blonde.” Harry caught the last thought and let out an audible groan then turned to shut his curtains and fall asleep.
Harry watched as her mask faltered for a split second before she fought back – her eyes never leaving Draco. “Well, like I said…we’ll see Draco.”
“Call me James, please. And yes, I suppose you’re right. It’s just we would have thought Harry would have mentioned it if
Shit. Harry forgot how sexy Oliver Wood’s Scottish accent was.
“Draco!” Harry’s loud yell snapped Draco back to the matter at hand.
“May I be excused? I’m really not feeling well.” Harry pushed his chair back and placed his hand on stomach in an attempt to look sick.
Seeing Draco interact with Hermione and Ron and watching his two best friends embrace Draco made Harry’s heart swell. Over the course of the term he knew he was falling harder and harder for Draco.
When Cedric left the maze, cup in hand, the entire school cheered. Harry watched as Cedric’s father ran down from the stands and met his son. Harry’s heart swelled. He told himself it was pride from seeing their champion win and witnessing a tender moment between father and son, but something told him he was fooling himself.
He had done terrible things. He didn’t deserve the Manor, his family fortunes, or even a life. He had to leave. And as much as he detested muggles as a child, he knew they couldn’t be all that bad. Anything had to be better than living in the wizarding world for another minute.
Finally, the man entered. He looked disheveled but still remarkably good. Harry watched as he approached the two, he was wearing robes this time, but they still hugged him in all the right places.
“Yeah…and what did he say?” Harry was surprising growing angry at a five-year-old boy. What if he told Teddy things that could scare him? What if he told him lies?
of his favorite people, Harry’s mind began to wander. He knew his family was loving Oliver. Every single member of this table was eating up every word Oliver spoke. He bonded with James and Sirius over a love of Quidditch. Apparently Oliver loved to cook and therefore had plenty to discuss with Remus who kept picking his brain about recipes. And Lily was impressed with Oliver’s high marks in school, his excellence with Charms (his mother’s favorite subject in school), and his desire to return to education. “I always told Harry that education is the most important thing a young witch or wizard can have. Magic is nothing without your ability to control it and use it properly.”
“Sure Harry. Just know, we are here for you if you want to talk. I know Ron doesn’t seem open it to it now, but I think he was just surprised is all.”
long time…” Draco couldn’t stop his eyes from growing wide again and he let Harry’s word sink in. “And it’s okay if you don’t feel the same or whatever! I mean, I know it’s crazy and kind of out of the blue and…yeah, well, I don’t even know if you like guys so…” Harry was rambling at this point and Draco wasn’t sure what to say.
Late in the evening, he decided to make his way to the library for a change of scenery. He moved down the staircase and began to head towards the library door before he was stopped by whispers coming from the dining area. He knew a meeting was taking place, so he decided to quietly listen-on on what was so important that his father felt it best he wasn’t involved.
“Harry…is that why you’ve been acting this way? Did something…did something happen at school?” Remus had a strong tone of concern as he asked the question.
He didn’t know which question to answer first…so he decided to answer with a passive shrug.
“A little crush, huh? And…wood? This wouldn’t have anything to do with the new
James and Lily Potter were strong and determined to fight. But soon, Voldemort heard of a prophecy in which a certain infant would need to die in order for Voldemort to continue his reign. Lily and James went into hiding to protect their son, but a friend of the Potter’s quickly revealed their hiding place and were thereby easy targets for Voldemort to find. He entered their home in Godric’s Hollow on October 31
Draco watched as his father’s face dropped. He must have not been expecting that. If he wasn’t so terrified, he might have rather enjoyed the look of pure shock on his father’s face.
The walk into town is really only about three miles, but with Harry along it felt much
“Blaise. Stop. Now. I’m warning you.” Draco looked frightened and angry at the same time.
was the right moment to talk? What about the past four months when Harry received nothing but
He checked the list several times in the week leading up to winter break and was happy each time to find he was the only one staying. He figured everyone wanted to be back home with their family after the war. But not him. He would be completely happy to stay in this dorm by himself all break.
The two laid together in the astronomy tower for hours that night, alternating between kissing and talking. They would face everything later.
. “So, it’s okay…?”
But Draco Malfoy can also recall the exact moments that changed the nature of his relationship with his father forever. The day he stopped trusting the man, the day he stopped fearing the man, and the day he knew he would despise this man forever.
“Actually, we don’t. What we need to do is get all of this back in the barn and head inside.” Draco started to pack up his materials and watched as Harry still stood there, brush in hand.
And it never did.
He liked Draco. He was enjoying Draco. And he wanted to be able to date like everyone else.
“I’m not with Draco! I don’t know what all that was about. Maybe Blaise was upset because we’ve been hanging out, but we aren’t
“So what’s for dinner?” Harry grinned as an attempt to dodge the impending doom of conversation about to afront him.
“Um, just kidding?” Draco responded towards the boys before looking at Harry with a concerned but amused look in his eyes.
“Draco”. Draco looked up from his books, in shock by the use of his first name.
This was a solid plan, until George decided to make the going-away celebration a reality. Harry tried on many occasions to get out of it, but every time George or Ron or both would respond with “Mate! Everyone will be there! We are going to a new wizard pub in London – Hermione, Seamus, Dean, Lee, Ginny, everyone!”. Harry eventually said he would go, but made it clear he would NOT be staying late. Hermione gave him a look that reeked of pity and knowing. She had been giving him this look for the past 2 weeks. Anytime someone mentioned Charlie leaving, Hermione would LOOK at him. He decided to leave it alone lest he discover Hermione
, only to turn around and see nothing but his goats oddly lurking behind him. Draco was sure he would return. He even found himself almost…hoping he would.
There. No room for discussion.
“’arry! You’re a hard one to catch, arn’ya? Thought I was going to have to break into a full jog.”
But luckily, after just a few weeks of this, the Weasleys came to his rescue. Ron came to check on him and quickly realized the situation was not good for Harry or Teddy and brought them both to live at the Burrow. Molly Weasley was ecstatic. She quickly took to helping care for both Harry and Teddy. She taught Harry everything he needed to know and made sure the two didn’t leave the Burrow until they were absolutely ready.
“Then we will figure it out. I don’t want to be without you Draco. And I know you don’t want to be without me.” Before Harry could continue, Draco was already moving towards him. Draco wrapped his hand around the back of Harry’s neck and brought him in for a hard kiss. Harry could taste the tears from Draco’s face as he kissed back.
Harry apparated to Diagon Alley and tried to remember where Twlifit and Tattings was located. He had never been in there himself, but he knew people like Draco shopped there. Which basically meant he would never need to go in there…
Harry didn’t know what time it was when he finally drifted off, but he must have because there is now light streaming into his bedroom and an all-too-quiet house.
Harry stood to write to Hermione and Ron and watched as Draco did the same for Leona.
“Maybe, son.” And at that, James ended the conversation.
boys danced in anticipation. But his favorite part was watching Draco. Draco looked at Scorpius as if he had never seen something so perfect in his life.
“Oh! Hogwarts!” Teddy’s eyes lit up as he spoke. Teddy loved Hogwarts. Of course he had never actually been there, but he knew everyone in his family had gone and couldn’t wait until he was eleven and could go as well.
“What the hell do you mean a ‘proper family’?” Harry smiled as Draco seemed to be finally ready to have the conversation. “What’s ‘proper’ about a mother abandoning her child for four years?”
He looked down at the two with a question on his face. Draco simply smiled and shook his head as if to say, ‘not now’. Harry left the two and went back to their bedroom only to be joined by Draco a few minutes later.
Harry smiled before mirroring Draco’s position. Draco looked beautiful like this. His body was lean but muscular and his white skin seemed to melt into his satin white sheets. Now that he didn’t have a gorgeous man attacking his mouth, he could give the room a proper look.
Draco smiled, “Uh yeah – I think you did. Don’t tell me you’re trying to hook me up with a Weasley, Potter. I may have changed, but I have standards.” Draco knew this sounded rude but hoped Harry would catch the joke.
“I don’t give a damn about your father Draco. This is
He also learned of many relationship revelations that had occurred since the war. Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley had re-kindled their romance (not that Draco cared or anything). Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley were now together (which made Draco confused because he assumed they always had been). Luna Lovegood was now dating Neville Longbottom (Draco didn’t care for Neville very much but had grown fond of Luna during her time at the Manor and was glad she was happy). Padma Patil was now dating Terry Boot (Draco didn’t even know if he could pick out who Terry Boot was so he couldn’t care less). The most interesting pairing to Draco was actually Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan. It seems the two had been together ever since Dean and Ginny broke up and had made it public over the summer.
“Yes. I love Draco Malfoy. And no! Not just because of that!”
“Then what is it?”
When Teddy finally awoke, breakfast was already on the table and Harry held Draco’s letter in his hand.
“Leona, as you can see, Harry is here to pick up Teddy. Everyone is fine, you can go.” Draco started to usher the woman towards the door with an annoyed look on his face.
When they all returned from a trip to Hogsmeade and entered the common room, Hermione waited for the rest of Gryffindor house to make their way to their dorms before gently asking her friend to talk.
Harry was startled by the sudden sound in the silent room. He thought for sure Ron would be asleep by now, though the lack of snores should have been a clue that he wasn’t.
When they made their way into the backroom Harry was in shock. Draco had converted the formal dining room into a playroom for Scorpius – the kid had…everything. There were toys as far as the eye could see and various magical objects sitting about.
here.” Draco could hear the disapproving tone in Seamus’ voice. Dean just stood there looking rather uncomfortable and moving his eyes around the Great Hall.
Warning: Homophobia and child custody. Just a heads up!
the Canons playing? I really don’t want my son to be subjected to this level of quidditch…” Harry was about to respond back but was cut off by Scorpius.
Harry stood up with Draco and was immediately pulled into a hug. Harry was overwhelmed and confused.
“You – you think that’s a good idea? They don’t…hate me?” Draco was cute when he was nervous.
“No. I’ve seen you sitting here for the past couple of weeks. It’s smart. Out of the way of people staring and silent. Thought I would join you.” There was no request in her voice.
have to do with me. You see, I’m Draco’s partner. We are together, whether you like it or not and that means I care deeply about his happiness. I also care greatly for Scorpius and I believe he deserves a good home. Which he already has.” Harry felt his confidence boiling up.
He tilts his face back into the stream, letting it wash away the lather in his hair that’s growing quite long. Long enough actually for him to need a hairband to keep it out of his face in a loose bun at the back of his neck. He ignores his half-hard cock as he washes the last of the shampoo out and grabs his towel from the floor, sniffing it to check if it’s clean. It isn’t. He uses it anyway.
He makes his way downstairs, gripping the handrail, he hates this house. He has only used three rooms since he moved back in. He can’t bear the thought of using any more. Bedroom, hallway, kitchen. Kitchen, hallway, bedroom. Everyday. That’s it. He tried, he truly did, the first day. He went into a drawing room, the drawing room Sirius used. He was consumed by it, an anger so visceral at how unfair this all was, that he had blacked out, only returning to his senses at the sight of the once orderly room now smashed to pieces, photos torn and shards of glass wedged into his bleeding knuckles.
“How are your parents ‘Mione?” He asks, a formality really. He doesn’t care. He can’t deal with any more depressing details of what the war has stolen.
He lurches his aching body up off the floor, stumbling as his leg cramps. Sleeping on the kitchen floor while covered in your own tears and sick probably wasn’t the highest point in his life. But equally, it wasn’t the lowest. He was just glad he’d numbed his brain enough the night before to have even just a little bit of restful sleep.
It’s unfair. It’s unreasonable. He can only speculate, along with Ron and Hermione of course, why that is the thing that haunts him. His friends have such fathomable nightmares. Hermione; being tortured, and Ron; Fred, of course. But his… Against every logical molecule of his brain, not that there are many, he envies them. But then he is consumed by guilt. Because how awful does he have to be to be jealous of someone who has lost his brother, or of someone who has been branded with a slur for the rest of her life.
They are talking. Not to each other, but at someone. He can’t see who until the boy with curls shifts, removing his arm from around Pansy Parkinson’s shoulder. Grey eyes look up.
Harry hadn’t wanted to be head boy. He wanted it even less now as Hermione, head girl, was nattering away about schedules and patrol and
He nods as Hermione says something with her eyes. She’s asking permission. He knows she has to do something to disguise him. It’s their safest best. He braces himself as the glow of a stinging spell rushes from her wand. He hates this part.
He slides out of the wards surrounding his house and runs against the rain into the small alley down the road before apparating to the Leaky Cauldron, half-hoping he splintches himself on the way there. He’s joking of course. He can’t wish that. He wonders how it would look in the papers: “The Chosen One; first he killed Voldemort. Now he’s killed himself!” No. He can’t hope for that.
He sways as he stands from his crouching position, almost careening into the table. Everything’s a bit blurry. He’s not sure why. Alcohol has never done that to him before. He feels a wetness seeping down his cheek. Ah, it does do that though, he remembers.
Bourne woods are beautiful at this time of night.
Parvati shakes her head, turns back to her sister. They keep walking.
There wasn’t a moment anymore where he didn’t feel like he was drowning.
“Are you quite done?”
He would laugh incredulously at his thoughts if he had the breath.
“How are you all,” Hermione hedges, faces still glowing slightly red from shame, “is George okay?”
“I’m not going to hex you Malfoy,” Harry sneers only to cover up the embarrassment of being watched for that entire… outburst. “No matter how much I want to.”
He thinks.
The train pulls into the station but Harry doesn’t notice. He’s stuck, frozen. They’re close, too close. The castle. Everything happened there. Everyone died. He died. He can’t go back. He just can’t do-
“Okay Danika, are you alright? Can you stand up for me?” he asks, keeping his eyes on her face as he takes one of her arms to help her. The person behind her takes her other.
She whispers it over and over again like a mantra as she continues to claw. Her voice breaks into sobs.
They break through the woods finally, tripping over their own feet as the last few branches lash against their faces. Harry stops, elated for only a moment as he sees Hermione still alive. But she’s been caught, Ron too if the scramble of a fight beside him proves true. It feels as though someone has ripped his heart out to see them struggling. It’s his fault.
“Harry,” the tone of Hermione’s voice broke through the fog of Malfoy’s face in his mind, “are you even listening?”
Or maybe he just gets off on the idea of his strict head teacher smoking a joint.
“Look Harry… I know you’ve had a hard time of it. We all have. But especially with Ginny and all-“
“Me?” Draco says, pointing at his chest in mock surprise, “
He honestly believes it could be either in his state of mind.
“The fact that I’m the only reason you’re not still stuck in there. Isn’t that just
He’s still searching for something, he’s forgotten what. But knows he needs it. And then he spots the knife he left out from earlier after cleaning the dishes. It’s sharp edge taunts him. Ah yes. That’s what he was looking for. He picks it up, doubting such a thing could cause him the pain he craves, he needs. He scoffs, his lips twist into a sickening smile.  He pushes it closer to his skin, pressing down on the soft, sensitive area of his wrist until-
Even though he feels like he could.
Hermione is looking at him oddly as she nudges Ron subtly before whispering something in his ear. He looks at him as well and frowns as he regards Harry. Hermione had asked him something.
“It’s alright,” he assures her. There’s been a lot of that lately. No one can seem to say the right thing. All so caught up in their own grief or their own relief that they don’t notice others. Or don’t care. Harry doesn’t care. He knows he should, but he can’t find himself to care about that either. “It’s… fine.”
finally died and Harry squeezes back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione is somewhere in front. He hopes.
It doesn’t stop the whispering though. Witches and wizards alike, trying to be subtle as they point him out to their friends; relatives. He gets coy smiles and giggles, Ron does too which Hermione seems disapproving of as she glared at any witch who dares to ogle him. Hermione gets positively leered at and even Harry feels grimy from some of the stares as him and Ron try to shield her from the worst of them.
He scrubs himself hard, hoping to wash away all of the many things he’s not quite sure he did from last night, and winces and let’s out a stream of expletives when his flannel rips off the half-healed scab on his knee, new blood mixing with a trickle of water running down his knee. He ignores it.
He wants his mum.
But he reaches them all too quickly and passes the schedule to Pansy before holding one out for Malfoy. He doesn’t take it straight away. He taps his right ring finger on the bottom of the paper
Harry stares at him for a second.
The bottles he stashed, shrunken and in a locked box, in the bottom of his bag won’t last him long and he’s worried. He’s not had to deal with himself fully sober for a long time. Since Lavender’s funeral to be exact, a month after the end of the war. The sight of her eight-year-old sister screaming after her as the casket lowered into the ground branded his mind. The casket of a girl he had felt nothing but contempt towards, but who still fought with him. Who had put her trust in him and died because of it. Hers was the last funeral of many, he had attended every single one, and that night he had drowned himself in alcohol. It was also the night of the first tattoo. A sprig of lavender carved into the side of his right pinkie in black ink.
It being dark outside helps. They can’t see what they don’t know is there. The ghost of blood stains, scorch marks. Rubble littering the courtyard. Scattered wands, whole, snapped. Piles and piles of dead bodies. Faces they love contorted in pain forever.
There’s a lot of gasping as the carriages pull up. Most people can see them now. He hears Luna’s voice above the crowd, airy and light, calming, “they’re just Thestrals everyone. They won’t harm you. They’re friendly really.”
And that reaction was actually much mellow compared to the reaction to the snake tattoo that wrapped around his neck, choking him as its scales glistened. Now that one he’d agreed was morbid as he was greeted with the shocked faces of all the Weasley family members and Hermione.
“But not that-“
“What are you doing here?” Harry says incredulously, not even registering what Malfoy had said.
“Ugh fine. Just hand these out. Please.” She hands him a bundle of paper, each meticulously labelled with a prefect’s name in Hermione’s ridiculously perfect handwriting.
Her head twitches, shaking a little.
But that left him with this. A huge house with only his consuming thoughts to fill it, his haunted memories. His own personal hell.
“What, Potter?” Malfoy spits.
Harry’s heart stutters as he stumbles, his mind immediately placing a body at his feet. He grabs Hermione’s arm, she looks at him before grabbing back, misgivings forgotten. Ron comes up on his other side, walking close as they guide Harry forward. Hermione squeezes his hand as they walk past the place where
him. But he hadn’t expected… he didn’t know what he expected really.
“You’re always there to talk. Yeah I know. Thanks ‘Mione but I’m okay, really.” He knows it was stand-offish, but he can’t bring himself to care, “‘bye.”
But, out of all choices, this was the best place to stay. He couldn’t stay at the Weasley’s. Their grief was suffocating. He didn’t begrudge them it of course, it was his fault they felt this way, but he couldn’t see Mrs Weasley smile that smile around her tear-swollen eyes again. No. They needed to be alone together. George needed his family. And that wasn’t Harry.
“See this year won’t be drama free, eh mate,”Ron says, throwing an arm around Harry’s shoulder. The courtyard is almost empty now, Hermione, Ron and Harry stood in the middle watching as McGonagall guides the girl into the school, Malfoy having disappeared in seconds. Harry looks around for him, an odd little weight in his chest when he can’t find him. Harry ignores it, telling himself it’s just old suspicion. “Come on. Let’s get this hell over with.”
Ron is somewhere to his left, flashes of vibrant hair shining through the thick trees, distance always changing. He’s never thought of it as a blessing before, but now he’s grateful for the reassuring but still obnoxious shade.
He sees another person come up behind her who crouches down and places a hand on the back of her neck, applying light pressure. It’s the point that calms people, if Harry can remember correctly. He doesn’t know who it is but he’s grateful as he sees the girl break through her eyes a little.
He flops into bed, closing his eyes.
Harry Potter is talking to little old me. Oh
He slams his hand against one of the walls separating the hallway from a compartment, tension falling from his shoulders when it shakes the entire row of wall. He smashes into it again. “Fuck.” He kicks at the door, hand still flying against the hard wood. “Fuck-“
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
“Yeah,” he says, he’s lying.
He had no hope of going back to sleep so he’d lain awake, surrounded by the not-so-welcomed familiarity of his room at Grimmauld Place, until the sun rose above the clouds and the time showed somewhat a legitimate hour for a stable person to be awake before he heaves himself out of bed all too late remembering the stash of dreamless sleep Hermione had made for him. For those nights, she’d said with a pat on the shoulder almost too rough, as though she’d hoped to bash the thoughts out. But it’s fine. He doesn’t need it. They are all walking on eggshells around him already. They don’t need another reason to think he would collapse at any minute.
It’s awkward. It had never been awkward before. The war had never stopped taking. But between these two, something had happened he was sure. He thinks it must of been in the chamber when they went to get the basilisk fangs. They were all fine beforehand, well as fine as they could be when fighting a war at eighteen. He doesn’t care what it was, he just wishes it never happened. He can’t lose them too. Even if some days it feels like he is.
With that, Malfoy turns and walks out of the carriage, leaving Harry to question what had just happened.
But all Hermione says is, “I hate what’s happened to you.”
and healing her cuts. He puts the hand back on his lap as he sits cross-legged in front of her before repeating the action to her right hand.
“Hermione enough.” Harry shouts, voice cold. They both stop. He rubs at his temples, trying in vain to ease the headache curling at his skull, but he winces as his thumb brushes over the reason for this entire argument earning a scoff from Hermione. “Just… enough.”
“Come on Harry,” Ron slaps a palm to his shoulder, almost too forcefully, “last one to the carriage has to eat the rotten fish Bertie Bott’s I found.”
Needless to say, he’d healed himself and then locked every room in the house that he wouldn’t need, thankful for the en-suite in his room so he wouldn’t have to venture into the east wing for the main bathroom. Sirius’ room was there. And nowhere else in this house needed to be smashed to pieces
He can’t get the image out of his head. The grey eyes. A single look. Draco
Harry tunes out, casting a look at Ron as they both grin at the constant that was Hermione Granger, thankful that something hadn’t changed.
So, here he stands, in front of an odd collection of people. And he’s seen a lot of odd people.
he hears from Hermione as he walks away, towards the back of the train.
They’re not running to a particular place, or in any particular direction. Just away. Away from the people who seem intent on chasing them until their bones give out.
He grabs his wand off the kitchen table. He’d agreed to meet Hermione and Ron at Diagon for some last minute book-buying or whatever else Hermione said they needed to do. He’d lost track of everything.
“Go on,” he whispers, almost mocking as he nods toward Harry’s outstretched wand, “do it. Do your worst.”
And Harry recoils.
“Two that we… two-“ she stutters indignantly, “what are you on about Harry? How many do you… No don’t answer that!”
Because she’s dead.
“Shame” Malfoy snorts, pushing himself upright, “you’re not as fun as you used to be. What, are you becoming one of those peace-makers now that you’ve fought, and killed may I add, in a war? I’ll grieve for that loss Potter, I truly will.” He says, pressing a hand to his chest.
He eases himself under the running water of the shower, turning it to almost scalding before switching straight back to freezing and settling under the stream. He’d always showered like this, the Dursley’s never let him use the hot water so he’d grown used to having them freezing. It saved on water bills anyway.
She doesn’t speak for a while, her eyes just flickering quickly between each of Harry’s glasses-clad ones, “Da-,” she stops and clears her throat, “Danika.”
“But he needs to know how stupid he was! He’s not a child. Why is he acting like one?”
“I-“ His voice catches around the word as his eyes burn as he continues his abuse on the door. But he can’t stop it when he slumps against the door, hand still weakly bashing the wood. “Fuck you Hermione,” he says as he slumps to the ground, pressing his hot forehead against the cool surface of the wall, breathing heavily.
He gasps.
Malfoy leads Danika away towards a bench as Harry watches him, confusion riddling his mind.
There are no reporters as the three of them track through the shops. He’s grateful for that. Kingsley warded them off.
He catches a glimpse of his body in the mirror, still lean, he’d never quite got the hang of eating enough. Habit. He blamed it on that. But still, he had quite a few muscles on his slender frame. Fighting a war apparently would do that to someone. Well, that as well as the many, many people he’d fucked over the last few months. Stamina apparently gave its own contribution to muscle mass. He needed to get his anger out some way, he reasons, and apparently copious sex with men and women alike was the most enjoyable way of doing that.
Except she had. Her monologue stops. She flinches. There’s a memorial on the side of the road. For Ollivander. She shakes herself, Harry can see she’s telling herself she’s fine, she’s alive, he knows because he’s done that too many times to count. She walks on.
“No.” He says. He couldn’t care less about what she was saying. He didn’t need to care. She has it under control. She has everything under control.
He needs to leave. Before he stops breathing.
He lifts her hands in front of her eyes, showing her   the blood. “Is it okay if i heal your hands?” He asks. The girl nods and he turns her left hand so her palm is facing upwards. He raises his wand very slowly as the girl watches his every move, before casting a light
He gets to King’s Cross five minutes before the train is supposed to leave and barrels through the barrier. He grins sheepishly at the glare Hermione immediately greets him with, arms crossed as she regards his unkempt state. His hair is everywhere, hanging out of his loose bun in strands around his face and smudged glasses. At least it was washed, he thinks. He has mismatching socks on, something he is certain she will notice, and he is pretty sure he has at least one button of his shirt done up wrong.
