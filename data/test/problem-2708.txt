If he didn’t show up in the next few days to start preparations for the new year, she would send someone to his cabin outside of Hogsmeade to retrieve him, or maybe she would go herself. She thought this ruefully, glad to have one of her favourite, if not troublesome students, back on school grounds.
"Do you think Professor Potter has a girlfriend?" A student in blue robes pondered
“Aberforth, who's at the bar?” Harry asked quietly.
“Hey now, i’m not the enemy here,'' Neville lifted his hands up, “I am just saying he's kind of a nice bloke now that he's grown up. We're not children anymore Harry. Goodness we’re nearing our thirties, maybe it’s time to let things be and move on?”
“Am I interrupting something?” Harry chuckled lowly, “you appear to be in a bit of a pickle.”
Ron looked at his old friend thoughtfully, “You have any idea what you are gonna do now though, I mean I guess you don’t gotta do anything with what you’ve saved up” he laughed and took a swig of his drink then looked around the pub they had found themselves in that day, “have you talked to ‘mione about any of this?”
Neville laughed but the two of them kept eye contact, not smiling.
“Aberforth I’ll be needing another shot,” Harry grumpled.
“No, not at all.” Neville whispered, “Just trying to convince this venomous tentacula to let me prune a few of its leaves for professor Slughorn's classes next week.”
Ron watched his friend walk into the icy November air, sighing to himself. “He’s gonna cause me a bloody lot of trouble leaving me to tell ‘mione all this…”
Aberforth whistled, “Perhaps you can still make it up to him, didn’t you say he spoke up for you at your trial?”
“I was a Death Eater, Harry,” Snape said. Harry looked at him blankly. “One of the Dark Lord's followers.”
There was a beat of silence. Then Fudge found his voice. “You imprisoned a student?”
“Mr Potter. Come with me,” Snape said. As he walked out, he shot a look at Blaise. “Try to keep your romantic activities confined to the common room after curfew, Mr Zabini.”
“That's the Tudor knot garden,” Draco pointed out an elaborate maze made of low hedges, surrounding a flowing fountain. “The first Lucius Malfoy had it built when he was trying to court Queen Elizabeth I. She spurned him though, so he spent the rest of his life jinxing any other suitors she had.”
“I have good news,” she began, before the Great Hall erupted in shouts.
“What's at Amesbury?” Harry asked.
Harry peered around her and grinned. “Er, no, Mrs Malfoy. This would be my fault. Excuse me.”
Harry didn't give them a chance to reply, but turned around and stormed out of the library, ignoring Madam Pince's glare. He wasn't looking where he was going, and just walked blindly down a corridor until he ran into something large which knocked him to the ground.
“You have your own Quidditch pitch?” Harry asked enviously.
Dumbledore smiled at Harry. “Mr Potter, you are not responsible for what you did whilst possessed by Riddle. Now, what happened in the Chamber?”
Harry spun around. Draco was leaning against the doorframe laughing. “You git! This is why you were walking so slowly!”
“It'd have to be, sharing Prefect duty with Hawthorn,” Adrian said.
“Ah, excellent! A bit of house rivalry, how about that?” Lockhart chuckled as he waved the two boys on stage. Harry smiled apologetically at Hermione and Neville as he climbed the short flight of stairs to face off against Ron.
A knock on his door made him look up, and he saw Draco standing there a little uncertainly.
Blaise grumbled and turned back to his magazine.
As Theo scrambled after Gemma, the two captains looked at each other, and grudgingly agreed to share the pitch. Practise ended up going smoothly for the most part. Flint kept the Slytherins doing drills designed to get Draco and Theo to fit into the team. They even attempted a game against the Gryffindors, but gave up when Flint and Wood started yelling at each other again. The rest of the teams simply left them to it and trooped off to the changing rooms.
Draco ran a hand through his hair and glared. “Come on, let's go.”
He stepped onto the path and looked for the grass snake he'd seen the day before. Sure enough, it was lying on the ground next to the path. There were at least ten other snakes scattered over the lawn. “
“I'm serious.”
” Draco said impatiently when Harry had slowed to a stop. He spent the rest of the trip allowing Draco to pull him along as he listed all the possible ailments Harry might have contracted.
“This can't be good,” Harry muttered nervously.
“Don't fret. There's a simple charm I can perform later, that will allow your device to work as normal. And it won't require batteries, either.”
The curtain was pulled back and Draco looked up at him.
Harry frowned. “I don't understand. Why are you here then, if you're only going to have to – to punish yourself?”
“How's your first match going?” Harry asked Draco. There was a crack of thunder overhead, and the rain intensified.
When both boys nodded, she led the way down the drive and through the gate, with both boys carrying their owls. Harry turned and took one last look at the Manor before he followed and held onto her proffered arm.
Snape sighed. “I understand how if feels to fear for a friend, Harry. But rest assured, Miss Granger will make a full recovery as soon as we are able to administer the Mandrake Restorative Draught.”
They sat up, and Draco handed back Harry's glasses. He looked over and giggled. “Your hair's all messed up.”
Hermione squeezed in between Harry and Neville as Pansy resumed the tale. Harry grinned down at the table. He hadn't realised this at the time, but he'd missed this when he was possessed: just sitting  with his friends. He felt like he hadn't seen them in months.
“I'm good, thanks,” Harry said desperately.
Hagrid chuckled. “Ah, just ignore them, Harry, it'll blow over.”
“People see what they want to see, Mr Potter, and you were already under suspicion. I dare say that after tonight, many people will be convinced of your guilt.”
“Is sirs wanting anything else?” Tilly asked as she looked up at them expectantly.
“Be good this year, darling. Please don't go chasing after any more possessed professors.”
“Are you hurt?”
“I thought you might like to get all the mail Dobby's been hoarding,” he said when he noticed Harry. “And you've some birthday gifts too.”
Draco snorted. “Of course they did. Why on earth is Hawthorn on here? Surely this would involve breaking far too many rules for him to have done it.”
“Of course it's not too much trouble. What were you after?” Mrs Malfoy smiled encouragingly.
Harry looked at the store doubtfully. It was small and dark, and he could just make out the sign above the display windows.
Harry came round to a forest of feet gathered around him.
Dobby nodded quickly. “Dobby will tell Mistress everything, Master Draco.”
“Hmm. Well, all the fields are ours, over to the stream over there... Oh, and the property extends partly into that wood over there.” Draco pointed them out.
That turned out to be a mistake, as the Bludger chose that time to rocket back towards him, and it smashed through his forearm at high speed. There was a sickening cracking sound.
Mrs Malfoy nodded once and raised her wand, which she hadn't put away. Given the shouting still coming from downstairs, Harry couldn't blame her. She silently unlocked the lock on Hedwig's cage, then aimed her wand at the window. The bars outside disappeared with a bang.
Theo grinned and looked from Draco to Harry. “Time to come good, gentlemen.”
“Oh, for heaven's sake!” she snapped. “Neville, help me out here.”
's Most-Charming Smile Award – but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon banshee by
Tracey looked up from studying Harry's work. “Maybe the protective spell reads intentions? Harry's not up to mischief, so it let him in.”
“Get your things, we're leaving,” Draco told Harry.
“When did you even have time to study? You've been Petrified!” Blaise scoffed.
Draco gave him an odd look. “No, you'd be the last to know. Trust me.”
“Pleased to meet you, Mrs Malfoy,” Hermione held out her hand.
Flitwick and Sinistra carried Justin to the infirmary, but the ghost was a bit more problematic. Eventually, McGonagall conjured up a fan and directed Ernie to use it to blow Nick to the infirmary, leaving her and Harry alone in the corridor.
Harry grinned. “Well, you have now.”
, but I can't remember exactly how the legend goes.”
“Sir, he's sending it after you!” Harry shouted.
“What? Can't it be with you? You're our Head of House, aren't you in charge of punishing us? We could clean cauldrons!” Harry said desperately.
“Nice try.”
“Unexpected?” Draco glared at him. “
“She may have mentioned it,” Draco replied distractedly. He was lifting up the discarded wrapping paper in search of undiscovered presents.
“Tilly?”
“Of what?”
“A little. Harry's teaching me.”
“I discovered that the Dark Lord was targeting your family. I couldn't stand by as he went after the one true friend I'd had, and so I went to Dumbledore that night to warn him,” Snape replied.
“Professor,” he said, snapping the album shut.
“Harry's relatives locked up his owl over the summer,” Daphne said with a little shudder.
“Out of the way, you, this is for the
“Of course that's not why I –” Mr Malfoy cut himself off when he looked around to find both of the red-robed men had their wands aimed at his throat.
Draco shrugged. “Maybe Harry's a seer?”
Draco tightened his hold on Harry's waist. “I saw it on our way into the bathroom,” he said quietly.
Susan looked a little doubtful, but Ernie shook his head stubbornly. “All we have is your word on it.”
. “All clear!” she called a second later.
Harry nodded as Draco glowered up at Snape. For his part, Snape simply resumed walking towards the dungeons. They found the common room packed with the entire house in attendance. Some people were on the couches, others standing or sitting on the floor. All of them were talking in tense groups. They quickly fell silent when they saw Snape enter.
The teams emerged onto the pitch and Hooch walked out with the ball crate. She'd just beckoned the captains over to shake hands when McGonagall hurried onto the pitch with a giant megaphone. The noise of the crowd fell away as she raised it to her mouth.
“Humph! I can mend bones instantly, but regrowing them is a much slower, and more painful, business. You'll have to stay overnight,” she said grumpily, and passed him a pair of pyjamas. She and Hermione walked around the drawn curtains as Draco helped Harry get changed. His useless arm was difficult to force through the sleeve.
“Me?”
“Of course, sir!” Tilly disappeared, and returned a minute later with a silver tray. There was a matching jug, a mug, and a bowl of marshmallows with a tiny pair of tongs.
,” he snarled at them.
Harry shook his head and took another step. “Hello? Er, sorry to interrupt, but are you okay?”
Harry grinned at Draco as the Dursleys recoiled. Dudley was staring at Dobby with a terrified fascination.
shall ask her. I do not want you two sneaking around like you did last year, do you understand?” When they nodded, he continued. “Good. Now, Mr Potter, I need to address the rest of the house. When I am through, I want your Cloak.”
“Given that you're talking to yourself, I'd say insanity is a distinct possibility,” came Draco's sleepy drawl. A second later he opened his bed curtain, smirking at his own joke. He took one look at Harry and his face fell.
Harry rolled his eyes and watched the Gryffindors huddled together at the far end of the table. “What will you do if the real heir gets caught?”
“I can see that you've all bought the complete collection of my books. Excellent! I thought we'd start the class with a little quiz. Nothing stressful; I just want to know how closely you read my books, how well you remember my exploits!” He handed them all a quiz paper. “Your thirty minutes start now!”
Draco shuddered. “They're like Daphne. If Daphne was a moron, and no fun.”
“Shouldn't I help them clean the walls, too?” Harry asked.
“Yeah, well, they're not the nicest family,” Harry grumbled, pulling a pin out to look at it closely.
“Worth a shot,” Harry said. “So, did she like flying?”
“Really?” Mr Malfoy looked at Harry speculatively. “Isn't that interesting. Say something.”
“Yeah, but he doesn't use them to hurt people! Besides, you were able to talk him out of hatching a dragon last year. Would he really have listened to you and given up the egg if he wanted to attack people with monsters?” Harry stood up. “We have to go talk to him.”
A second later Harry groaned when Lockhart walked onto the stage, waving so that his purple robes rippled in the candlelight. He was followed by Snape, who was glaring at Lockhart rather than waving.
Harry put his brush down and straightened his shirt before following Draco out into the hallway. He was suddenly nervous about dinner. While Draco's mother had been perfectly nice to him, he wasn't looking forward to meeting his father. He remembered what Snape had told him about Mr Malfoy's attitude to Muggle-borns and half-bloods, and shivered.
“Please tell me you won't be challenging Blaise for the title of vainest Slytherin,” Draco drawled after a while of this.
Draco considered this as they walked across the Entrance Hall. “Not that we
“Whoop de fucking do,” Harry muttered.
One morning during the last week of term, Draco received a letter from his mother that, for once, wasn't accompanied by a large box of sweets. He read it, pocketed it and stood up abruptly.
Harry stared down at his soup. “Last year I didn't know. That it happened on Halloween, I mean.”
Pomfrey clicked her tongue sympathetically. “At least a week. This will be a nasty one. I can give you as much Pepperup as you want, but the best thing is rest and a lot of water. Haven't you had the flu before?”
“Problem?”
Draco looked at him sourly. “Hermione, has Harry told you he's been hearing voices?”
he wrote. Like before, the ink stayed on the page momentarily before disappearing entirely. Then more words appeared in a different hand.
“It's to be delivered in person,” the dwarf went on relentlessly.
“So.”
Altogether, Harry wasn't as happy as he'd been last year to sign up to stay at Hogwarts over Christmas. At least this year he'd have company, as Draco and Hermione were staying too. Mrs Malfoy was in the midst of redecorating Malfoy Manor, and Draco declared her to be unbearable during such times. Hermione just wanted to stay for the library. Greg and Vince were also staying, as they wanted to try the food at the Hogwarts Christmas feast.
,” said the basilisk.
“Pansy, you're fantastic. Thanks,” Harry said gratefully. He scanned the Hufflepuff table, but couldn't see Justin.
Finally, on the last night, everyone sat down for one last dinner. Harry had grown used to the fancy food the Malfoys liked to eat, and was happy to see that quail was being served, as it was one of his new favourites.
Harry could have sworn he saw a glimmer of pity in Snape's dark eyes as he was dismissed.
Harry walked to the sink she'd pointed to. Sure enough, there was a thin, battered book lying in the water on the floor. He bent down to pick it up and turned it over.
Draco made as if to hug him, but stopped when Snape shook his head. “Harry, you are not the first person to be taken in by the Dark Lord. Older and more experienced wizards than you have willingly followed him.”
“Right...” Hermione said, sharing a look with Draco.
“You lot look cheerful,” Pansy said as she slid onto the bench.
“And he told us he'd done the same thing with at least one other class,” Millicent said.
“Draco, you were hysterical over Harry disappearing, made Gemma summon Snape and then left with him and didn't return,” Pansy explained. “We all thought you'd been attacked, too, but the Prefects wouldn't let us leave the common room. Not until McGonagall came down to tell us about the feast.”
Harry took off Dracos belt while leaving open mouth kissed down his neck, soon he was pulling down his pants and underwear to let his penis free. Harry used his own wandless magic to make lube appear on his cock. Soon they were bucking into one another's hands. Panting and kissing each other for dear life. Harry moved one of his hands to grab Draco's ass and kneed it. Draco whimpered as he bucked into Harry.
“Ah I see you’ve sobered up a little bit. How about I make us some hot coco and light the fire.” Harry smiled at Draco as we took his outer robes off and was left in a pair of jeans and a thermal shirt. “Here I can take yours”
“Don’t worry about me, I am going to go back to my cabin. No school tomorrow so I can wait out the storm here in Hogsmeade.” Harry smiled at the warming spell and felt Draco snuggle into him.
“If you’re sure mate,” Neville asked again.
He then proceeded to down his sixth beer and ask for another.
0o0o0o000o0o0o00oo0o00oo0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0000o000o0o00oo00o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o
“I could use a refill thanks,” Neville smiled broadly at Aberforth.
“Don’t want to go home,” Draco mumbled.
“Who's the fire whiskey for?” an inquisitive Draco asked Aberforth.
Harry wondered how he never noticed Dracos sharp canines.
Ron looked at Harry, considering his friend's words for a moment, “You deserve a break for sure… you’ve got time to think about taking the post though. I mean it is November, you’ve got until September to decide to take it. McGonagall would take you over any other sap for that position”
Aborforth made his way over then, “Goodnight Mr. Potter Mr. Longbottom. What would you like tonight?”
Aberforth gave Harry a questioning look. Neville gave him an exasperated look.
“He might be right.” Aberforth said as he approached with their next shots, “this will be your fifth shot boys.”
“I am surely glad, I am not the one on the end of that tirade,” Harry laughed, “Though I did get a good lashing for only telling her a few days ago I was actually taking the position.”
“Professor, Professor! Look at all I found! I can’t wait to get to potions next week and work on some extra credit work now that I have all of this!” Helen beamed at Harry as she held out her bag of potion ingredients.
Students were running a muck of it, most going to honey dukes first, while others found their ways into the smaller shops or into Madam Rosmerta's for a warm drink.
Neville turned to look past Harry, “I can’t rightly tell, he's ducking down. Mostly I see a black cloak.”
Draco listened contently knowing that early he himself had been the arse, “You're wrong I was being awful to you earlier… I.. I’m sorry.”
“Nah I will be fine though, I have time to figure out what I want them to learn, for now I am going to just use the old curriculum from the last professor and add things I think are important and wait on things I find useless...think I should teach the new kids to duel first thing?” Harry chuckled at Neville's dubious expression, “Don’t worry I'm just kidding mate. I’m not gonna throw them to the wolves that quickly.”
"Honestly I haven't the faintest idea where the potions shop is, but we can sure find out together. I think there used to be one down that way, let's check there shall we?"
O0o00oo0o0o00ooo0o00o0oo00oo00oo00o0o0oo0o0o0o00o0o0o0o0o0o0o0oo00o0o0o0o
"Could you show me where your potion ingredients are?" The Hufflepuff smiled
“For Mr. Potter.”
Maybe, just maybe, I made the right decision, Harry thought to himself, smiling out at the crowds of students, it doesn’t feel like the home it used to feel like, but it's much better than being back in my old flat. Yeah this will be a good year.
Harry looked at Draco aghast, “Yes, because You’re all I could think about.” Harry rolled his eyes and took his own shot.
“Sounds good,” answered Harry.
0o0o00o0oo0o00o0oo0o00o0oo0o00oo00oo00o0ooo0oo0o0o00oo0o0o00oo0o0o0o0o0o0o0
“Harry? Over here!” Neville called back.
“Yes, please.” Harry peppered kisses down Dracos neck.
Draco and Harry stared at each other and took their shots. “Another.” they both rang out.
He was certain as he got up and finally looked over at the gobsmacked Potter that he had either made the best decision of the day or the absolute worst.
0o0o000o00o0o0o0o0o000ooo00o0o0o0ooo0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0
Neville looked at his two friends knowing neither of them could aparate in their conditions even if they could to the castle. Good thing Draco lived only a few blocks away. He was sure he’d have to help him home.
Aberforth returned with their shots, “Here you are boys, Neville, how are you on your beer?”
“I think intention matters a lot, Harry come on.”
“Sure.” Draco said
“Yes I am sure, now get back to the castle before the snow comes down any harder.”
“Hmm… is he doing alright?” Neville wondered aloud.
Draco sipped on his beer, washing out the taste of the fire whiskey. Wondering to himself why he always had to get so riled up when it came to Potter.
“You couldn’t have said so sooner?” Harry huffed, “Well we're already halfway to my cabin. I'll just take you there for the night, is that okay?”
Harry smiled at his old friend, “Yeah mate, let's head there.”
Harry looked out the window to his office that held a view of the lake, knowing that in a few hours students would be flooding the school with chatter and excitement for the new year at Hogwarts. He remembered ruefully his first time crossing that lake and how amazed he was at the beauty and grandness of the whole experience. Soon, the lanterns would light the lake, and carriages would bring older students onto the grounds carried by thestrals that only a few could really see.
O0oo0o0oo00oo0o00oo00oo00o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o
0o0o0o000o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o
Draco grunted, the last thing he needed right now was a chipper Longbottom at his feet. Or rather next to him. He was far too many beers in to be anything but himself, “Longbottom.”
“I think I’ll have one more actually,” Harry said. Thinking he needed something more to cool his head and his pants. Malfoy was lighting something up in him in a different way than earlier. Harry wasn’t sure what to think about it but he knew he wanted to find out what it was. He was nothing if not someone who stared down a challenge, and he could tell Malfoy was challenging him.
“I’ve no idea what you mean Potter,” Draco smiled with perfect white teeth.
“Thanks,” he smiled back at Harry, “now to just put these leaves somewhere safe.”
“Actually I haven’t been able to get around Hogsmeade as much as I would have liked to since the war ended. There's lots here I haven't had a chance to explore. I had no idea you had a shop here, let alone that I had unwittingly happened upon it.” a rather aggravated Harry responded.
“Aberforth… please another round?” Draco laid his head on the counter completely done with himself.
“So… Draco… I’m sorry about earlier tonight. I was being an arse.” Harry pipped up after a few moments of just listening to the fire crackle. “I guess I wasn’t ready to give you a chance…”
An owl sat on the Headmistresses desk looking bored, and rather annoyed to be waiting all alone for so long. Mcgonagall took the letter from the bird's leg and opened the treat tin on her desk to allow it to eat before taking off. Sitting at her desk the contents of the letter brought a great smile on her face, “Well, finally then Potter. You would keep me waiting until a week before classes began..”
“Colleagues barely, you would call us ex rivals first. I don't think I have ever said a nice word to him directly.”
Harry gave Ron a rueful smile gripping his own butterbeer, “I don’t really know what I want to do, Neville mentioned there's an opening for a new Defense Against The Dark Arts post at Hogwarts… I was thinking about applying for it, after some time to myself…” he looked out the window staring at all the muggles walking by, with Unbeknownst to the wizarding pub in front of them, “ I think I am just ready to see where life takes me… without needing to be the Chosen One, a Savior…”
Draco looked up from his beer, “Yes, and I have made an arse out of myself the first time seeing him in almost ten years.”
“But does it matter if it was meant to be or not?” Harry asked as he made his way to a table.
“Most every night,” laughed Aberforth, “He comes and chats with me. Always leaves good tips.”
"Wel-welcome to Herbs, Healing, and Potions, can I help you find anything today?"
Harry stared at Neville for a few moments before relinquishing, “yeah, fine. I guess you're right.”
“How thoughtful,” Draco smiled at Harry, taking the mug offered to him. He took a sip and the hot flavor of coco burst into his mouth, he didn't realize how badly he needed to drink something non alcoholic.
“Oh do you now? You know I don’t recommend Mixing drinks this far in.”
“Come on Draco let’s get you home.” Harry laughed as he started to half drag Draco away into the snow filled streets.
All of Harry's previous anger hit him all at once, remembering his conversation with Malfoy.
“He’s real good though, I learned so much more about dueling in just a few weeks because of him!” she beamed at Draco.
“Of course Professor, I mean Headmistress, yes I will,” Neville fumbled a bit in his excitement to see the new students.
He hadn't really visited the town since moving, his cabin was a decent way out from the main town, and Harry enjoyed the peace of being alone. Now though, along with more teenagers than he was ready for, he found himself walking around in the autumn air missing Ron and Hermione.
“Grand, in about an hour you will need to go down to the main door and help lead the new students to line up and give them the introduction, just as you did a few years ago. Thank you Neville.”
“I don’t rightly know Mr. Malfoy.”Aberforth gave Draco a soft look, “but perhaps  you’ll find a way to tonight.” as he spoke the bell chimed and in walked none other than Harry Potter and Neville
“What’s that?”
Amazingly enough, almost all the teachers were already waiting in their seats when the two entered, McGonagall smiled at them, “Neville dear, would you mind doing the honor this year of introducing the first years into the hall when it is time? It seems Slughorn is nowhere to be found and I dearly do not want to have to wait around for him again this year.”
Harry continued his tirade in his head as he made his way into the castle halls, students milling about around him. Harry fumed, knowing that the students could probably tell he was in a foul mood as they made a path for him easily. Harry had no idea where he was headed as he wandered deeper into the castle until he nearly ran into a ghost near the herbology classroom. Neiville! He will understand my frustration!
“And I am saying you just need to let bygones be bygones and move on, I am sure it wasn’t meant to be that harmful.”
Harry scowled at Draco but before he could say anything Helen interrupted.
Harry continued to watch in silence for a few moments, “perhaps I should come back?”
“I appreciate that, thank you. I will let you know when I am in need of your supply.” Draco muttered into his drink.
"Sorry about that, I haven't gotten out much since taking the position at Hogwarts, so about the potions shop?"
“Draco, do you want… can I fuck you?” Harry pulled away from Draco's lips long enough to say.
Aberforth was on his way back to their table with their drinks, a slumped down figure at the bar.
The three chatted for a while, the hours growing colder outside and the time nearing 2 a.m. Aberforth made his way over to their table, “It’s about time you three head out. My tavern has been nearly empty sept’ for you three for a while now and a storm is heading in. It’s best if you make your way back to your homes.”
Helen and Harry said their goodbyes and made their way out. Helen headed to Madam Rosmerta’s and Harry to wander around the town wondering what in the world he had gotten himself into today.
“Well what a surprise Potter, seeing you out tonight? Couldn’t get enough of me from earlier could you?” Draco smiled, breaking their eye contact to take the shot Aberforth returned with. It went down hot but Draco was happy for it to calm his nerves.
Draco undid Harry's jeans and pulled out Harry’s member. He began stroking it, lubing it up with a spell under his breath. Harry groaned and bucked into his hand. Draco had no idea how much Wandless magic turned Harry on. Harry moved his hand to Dracos belt, “May I?”
“Anyways I was hoping you would come over and join Harry and I for a drink or two. What do you say?”
“See something you like, Potter?” Draco smiled seductively, “You look… Hungry.”
“Too Drunk… I’m not going to be able to undo my wards… Aberforth usually lets me stay at the tavern when I am this… Well… You know.”
“I don't need anything, I was helping a student. The next thing I knew I was being harassed by an old classmate.”
Ron laughed at the idea of his beautiful wife bursting into the Aurors office in a fit, at not being informed of Harry's apparent decision making, “yeah I am sure she was bloody pleased to see that hit her desk without any warning. Maybe you should have said something before now, ya know? I mean yeah you've mentioned feeling like head Auror wasn't right for you anymore, but to just sign a paper and pack your bag the same day…", Ron blew a long breath out, “well, that all explains why she sent me an owl saying she’d be working late the next couple days and to talk to you”
“Works , owned, does it matter? Malfoy is there, being just as horrible as he ever has been.”
"Mr. Potter, Sir, would you mind helping me?" A Hufflepuff from one of his classes smiled, Helen, he thought was her name, "I heard there was a potions shop, but I'm not sure where. I wanted to pick up some herbs for my potions kit."
“How flattering, though I can’t blame you for it. I am captivating.” Draco grinned again, enjoying taunting Harry.
“I’ll have a pint,” Neville gave Harry a funny look.
The three made it out of the tavern, Aberforth wishing them well.
"Ma-Malfoy?”, Harry turned around a bit taken aback, “Hello."
They looked into one another's eyes and Draco nodded smiling he said, ”yes”
“What do you mean,” Harry asked with a laugh as they continued their walk to his potion shop.
“Me as well,” Draco smiled down at Harry, drank the last of his beer and sat down at the table.
“Works there? I thought he owned it.”
“I don’t care, give me the shots.”
Draco turned his head to the noise and about spit out his beer, “of bloody course.”
“Are you sure this is what you want to do mate?” Ron asked while accepting a butterbeer from their waitress, “I mean you’ve been at this since the war ended…”
Harry found him under a table trying to coax a moving plant to let him get closer.
Draco wore back slacks and a silvery grey dress-shirt under his robes, of course he's wearing that Harry thought to himself as he put away the robes and made his way to the kitchen to make coco. Dracos clothes were tailored perfectly to his body and man did Harry want to explore that body. He looked delectable, Draco was right earlier that night, he was hungry.
The first shop they went to ended up being a novelty shop, selling some potions supplies but with such little diversity it wasn't of help.
“Thank me for what?” Harry asked, sincerely confused.
“Good evening Draco,” A smiling Longbottom appeared next to him, “I see you’ve taken up fire whiskey tonight”
“Wait Harry, does that mean you haven’t figured out your class lists and studies?” Neville looked worried.
He smiled at himself, surprised by the lack of disdain he used to feel at the thought of muggleborns. Sure, he still found a muggleborn marrying a pureblood distasteful, but his broad hatred of them had long gone since the war.
“Harry, want to head to the Great Hall with me to wait at the teachers table?” Neville brought him out of his thoughts of the past, “I know it is early, but I am so excited to see the new students. I wonder what Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs we’ll get in the houses. What do you think?”
Harry looked at Draco and in the moment he could only think of one thing to do. He grabbed his hand and pulled Draco closer so that their heads were touching, “You don’t have to thank me… I would have always done that for you…” he tilted his head towards Draco, and they were kissing. Long drawn out kisses. Like they were both afraid to break the moment, afraid they were crossing a line they should have left uncorosed. But the longer they kissed the less Harry cared. He pulled Draco into his arms and kissed him deeper, letting his tongue dip into his mouth. Draco groaned, letting himself be pulled on top of Harry so they were laying spread out on top of the comforter Harry had brought out.
“Let’s make a toast,” Neville commented, “it’s your last shots after all and I'm at the end of my beer.”
“I never think of you Malfoy,” Harry jarred.
“A couple shots of fire whiskey for me,” Harry commented
“I am telling you I saw white hair. It’s Malfoy at the bar.”
“As you wish Mr. Malfoy,” Aberforth poured two more shots and pushed them towards Draco before heading back to Harry and Neville's table.
He nodded and made his way back to the bar.
“dueling , really? How intriguing. No doubt an ex-auror would have some amazing skill at dueling,” Draco drawled out.
“I take it you two would like more?” Aberforth chimed in.
Harry was feeling bold too, five shots of fire whiskey would do that to a person, “Perhaps I just see something you can’t see in yourself.” he said cryptically
“Well, isn’t that a shame,” Draco smiled broadly, “perhaps you’ll need a tour?”
“Wonderful,” Draco clapped his hands together, “Who knew the great Harry Potter would dain to be a professor, truly a magnificent show of grace on his part I'm sure.”
The woman at the counter beamed,"OH! Mr. Potter! I am so glad to see you in my shop! I'd heard rumors you'd moved around here but hadn't gotten the chance to say hello yet!"
Harry gave Draco a curious look, “Who would have thought the two of us would ever say that to each other.”
“Yes please,” came at the same time as “of course.”
He made his way into the open classroom hoping to find Neville pruning plants or something of that nature and not having to look for him back in his rooms.
“Every night?” Neville and Harry asked together.
“Come on Draco I’ll help you up.” Harry reached a hand out to Draco. Draco was taken aback by his first name coming out of Potter's mouth. It left chills down his arms. He couldn’t help but to reach out to him. He felt himself being lifted up and his arm slung over Harry's shoulder. Yes he was Harry now wasn’t he Draco thought to himself. Never before allowing such a closeness to form between them in fear of being hurt. Before leaving Draco put far too much money on the table for Aberforth as he usually did on nights where he let himself get a little too drunk.
Longbottom.
Aberforth came back with their shots, “Thank you Aberforth. Harry, I think I know exactly what you like.” Draco was grinning knowing he was being way too forward but far too lost in the alcohol to care. After six beers and three shots of fire whiskey he was feeling bold.
Aberforth whistled lowly, “Well Mr. Potter looks like you're about to have a very lively conversation.”
“No, but I did run into a rather unpleasant person.”
That night in front of the fire they made love for the first time, neither one admitting to what it was. They would wake up in the morning cuddling each other close and wondering what it meant but being sure of one thing, in their hearts they regretted nothing and they were both, starting to feel the love they once had for one another blooming.

She sent her reply with the owl as it hadn't left her desk yet, telling Mr.Potter to be there as soon as possible to set up his office.
“Neville, I'm telling you he's nothing but a prat.” Harry continued his rant from the walk over, “Who talks to someone like that?”
Harry grinned at his friend, “nice work mate.” He reached down to help Neville off the floor.
The two men grinned at one another before taking their seats side by side at the professors’ table. It was not long before Neville was instructed to fetch the first years and the ceremony produced a fairly even number of students to each house. The students in the hall all looked excited and curious at him after McGonagall’s announcement that Mr. Potter would be taking over the spot for Defense against the Dark arts for the next few years. When the food appeared before them, students shouted in glee at the delicious amazing food. Harry stared out at them then, happy that they had something new to gawk at. Looking at his own food before him, he felt a sharp pang at the memory of Dobby, hoping that the house elves down below still remembered their amazing work mate.
What an absolute ass! Harry thought to himself as he made his way back to the castle. Why did Malfoy have to be in Hogsmeade, let alone own the very potionshop that I went into today! When did he even move to Hogsmeade? How did I miss him being there for this long!
“Strong words, he really isn’t so bad nowadays. You must have caught him on a bad day. He’s always quite cheery when I work with him to help restock his shop.”
O0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0oo00000o0o0o0o0o0o00o0oo0o00oo0o0
“Alrighty, lets get Draco home,” Neville smiled at his two friends who were getting along great after drinking together.
“Potter why do you always stare at me? Is something wrong? Something catch your eye perhaps,” Draco Smiled sweetly at the last part. The corners of his mouth twitching upwards in a snarky way but still leaving him to look devilishly handsome.
The two grinned and went in, a bell chimed awaking a rather weathered looking fellow at the front desk.
“Too new beginnings” Harry and Draco echoed, staring into each other's eyes as they took their shots. Something between them had sparked, even Neville could tell.
“Here you are, Fire whiskey for you, and a pint for you.”
“Neville?” Harry called into the echoing room, “Neville are you in here?”
“Cheery? Malfoy? You speak as if he is a friend. He tormented us both for years. How could you just let all that go?”
Soon they were both out of clothing and Harry was leaving kisses and bites along Dracos body, getting Draco ready for him.
The Hufflepuff looked delighted and chatted away about how much she loved her potions classes, Harry found himself proud. It was always good to see a student so involved.
“He did, yes, that was over ten years ago though and I haven't even thanked him for it.” a dismil Draco downed a good half of his pint. “How do you even thank someone for that?”
“Harry… gods Harry…” Draco groaned as he felt Harry's erection on his leg. His own was pressing into Harrys. “Can I.. Can  I touch you?”
"Yes of course over here, follow me." The man wobbled using his cane to walk, leading the student to the side of the store that had drawers stacked ceiling to floor. The shelves all held different things one could use while brewing potions. It could give the shop in Diagon alley a run for its money. The shop seemed to hum with the love the owner had for it, every surface was spotless, and the potions all looked to be hand labeled. Harry wandered around while his student found her supplies, perhaps he'd buy some more dreamless sleep. So he could stop needing to get some from Madam Pomfrey.
"Ma'am, would you know where the new potion shop is in town? I haven't been yet and my student needed some things we couldn't find here."
0o00o00o0oo0o000o0o0o0o0oo0o00oo0o00oo0o0o0o00o0o0o0o0o00o0o0o0o0o0
“That's not entirely true Harry, You were talking about him earlier weren’t you?” Neville peeped in, taking a sip of his pint.
Draco set about looking around and organizing his potions once again, the school year had started and the teachers had come in to get any potions they needed, Pomfrey had even been by to pick up a case of medicinal potions to be used the first few weeks at school. She’d ordered two more cases to pick up by the end of the month, lord knows how many students would come in looking for a calming drought, or something for a headache. Muggleborns seemed more common, and more overwhelmed than usual the last few years. It kept him busy though, even if the potions were less complex than the ones he preferred to brew.
“Of course,” Draco breathed out, his head swirling with emotions and questions.
“Yeah I did actually, she showed up in my office right after I put in my resignation. I don’t think she was too pleased about my abrupt departure from the Aurors.”
“Haven’t seen you in a few weeks since I last dropped off supplies for your shop. Make sure to let me know as soon as you are running low on anything.” Draco could hear the smile in his words.
Neville made his way to a closet in the back of the room, disappeared for a moment then came back, “How was your trip to Hogsmeade? Did you get a chance to visit your cabin?”
Harry was grateful for the interruption. Draco looked far too pleased with himself. Harry wanted to throw him against a wall and, and Do what? He thought. The Fire whiskey must be getting to him. Harry couldn’t stop staring at Draco though. His hair was now to his shoulders and pushed back immaculately. He seemed fairly fit now under his robes. He would put up a good fight he bet if he were to throw him against the wall.
Draco took it upon himself to follow Harry; the world had stopped spinning a while ago, and the cold air had sobered him up a good amount. He made his way through the small cottage to a living room that had a bedroom attached. No couch furnished the room sadly, and Dracos fears of only one bed seemed to be being fulfilled.
“That would be… Fine…” Draco internally was screaming at himself. Alone in Potter's cabin? What if there's only one bed? Gods what if there is only one bed. Could he handle it if it were only one bed? Was he strong enough not to let his resolve fly away and to try something on Harry. He was suddenly far more awake then he had been moments ago and he felt a growing heat in his body, and it wasn’t from Neville's generous warming charm.
Harry- Leo Harry-James Potter
“No actually,” Mikhail chuckled warily handing her a goblet of pumpkin juice, and waiting until she calmed down, “Orion tricked us.”
“Your family is very strange Tesoro.”
"Molly hated him." Ron smiled sarcastically, "She hated him for living, for being the head of the family, but most of all she hated him for demanding that everyone stay neutral. He didn't trust Dumbledore and he wanted to keep them safe."
Carina screamed, Theo held her protectively to his chest shielding her from the glass. (As their roles demanded)
“Just apologize to him Boss,” Millie begged looking frazzled, “Apologize and mean it! I can’t keep following him around at night its killing me!”
Harry blushed scarlet dropping his gaze submissively, “Well what about you?”
"Yes," Dumbledore took another step forward, the spark in his eye told Leo he believed he’d won.
Draco fussed and worried over Harry until the raven couldn’t take it anymore and burst into tears in his boyfriends arms.
Harry straightened nervously at the sight of what was obviously his Father’s writing on the envelope. Draco’s eyes zeroed in on it before he glanced at Harry uncertainly.
Leo had worked himself up again. He was so tired of everyone giving him the cold shoulder for ‘hurting Malfoy’s feelings’. He was SICK of it. Leo was DONE. “I bet you’re laughing your ass off in your room at night, because they’re all angry at me! Or is this some kind of sick twisted scheme to make me feel bad and come grovel at your feet? Or into your bed?”
“I think that’s exactly what you said,” Draco argued disinterestedly as he stood, shoving his hands in his pockets as he strolled idly toward the stairs, ignoring the two Slytherins mystified expressions as they watched him. “Merlin, if you wanted to be my friends so bad you could’ve said, I guess I wouldn’t mind allowing you two to hang around. Just don’t embarrass yourselves in front of Harry and the others, they aren’t Slytherins you know, and Gryffindors tend to be quite short tempered you know, oh and they enjoy a sense of familiarity so... I’m off to find my room. Good night Blaise, Adrian, I’ll see you in the morning for Breakfast.”
Tracy nodded, “I don’t want to be a Death Eater.” She blurted out, “I’m frightened of the violent and barbaric ways they chose to use to obtain they’re goals. I’m a healer by nature, it’s my expertise. When I graduate I’d hoped to be a Healer at Saint Mungos. If I were to join the Death Eaters I wouldn’t be able to stomach it. If I’m forced to, I know my fate will be a grim one.”
“Leo Harry James Potter!” Carina shouted indignantly. Lyra and Julian crossed their arms over their chest looking at him in disappointment.
Draco frowned trying to make sense of what the boy was saying, “What are you-”
Carina glared, "Tell him and I'll have your head for it." She threatened, her blush still coloring her cheeks.
Blaise and Adrian hesitated before grudgingly following him over when he looked over his shoulder at them expectantly.
“Oh but Julian you’ll get in trouble,” The first girl warned anxiously, gripping his arm and gazing up at him adoringly.
A startled noise shook him from his shock, “Orion’s a GIRL?!” Harry demanded in disbelief.
Draco clenched his jaw and fist, doing his best to remain calm, he can’t have failed already. Even if he did, at least he had Harry. He could survive being Homeless and poor if he still had Harry. Though his pride would definitely take a hit, and Mr Potter would undoubtedly not be pleased with his son’s choice in life partners. A knutless, failure with no place to call home.
Draco’s expression immediately darkened and he reached out quickly dragging Harry up the last two steps by his shirt. Harry winced as his ankle connected sharply with the edge of the step. “I told you, this is mine, you don’t even touch it unless I tell you too.” Draco growled gripping Harry’s ass near painfully.
“Woah kiddo!” Sirius and Remus hurried in after exiting the Den (Where the Floo was located) and witnessing the attack. It took them a moment but the four men managed to pull him off the fat man.
The name written in bright blue ink on the Photo slapped him hard in the face, as he looked at the girl smiling at him. She blew him a cheeky kiss before waving merrily. She had signed the picture for Regulus Black the year they'd started dating.
Draco ripped his own shirt off and quickly caught Harry who’d been knocked back at the quick gesture. Harry glared lightly before groaning loudly as Draco ground rough against him forcing him deeper into the bed. “You sure you wanna do this kitten?”
Draco was waiting in the living room concern etched clearly into his face. Remus like Sirius was suspicious at first. Surprisingly Sirius was the one to calm him down before leading him from the room to talk.
Harry’s eyes widened at the stressed note in the other boys voice, “I’m sorry, I guess I … I don’t know, maybe I am this needy. I think I thought you’d stop me if you didn’t want to. That would be okay you know.”
.” Harry spoke quietly, though the effect it produced was anything from quiet.  The wall behind Walburga’s portrait shattered, plaster and wallpaper flew every which direction and the frame around the nasty woman’s portrait fell to pieces as well, the canvas fluttered down to the floor and landed in a heap at Harry’s feet.
“You tell me you sodding arse! I heard you screaming so I came to wake you up but the moment I touched you, this happened.” Draco rushed through the words as he tried to shrink in on himself, shaking in fear that any moment the flames would consume them despite the defined radius they had given the bed.
The return to Hogwarts for the ‘8th Years’, as McGonagall had called them, came with little to no fanfare.  For which they had all been immensely grateful for.  They had all arrived at the castle the night prior to when the remainder of the students were set to arrive, and to no one’s surprise, they all agreed amongst each other that the pain was far too raw for them to be in the Great Hall for extended periods of time.  The Headmistress was sympathetic and told them that their common room, as they would all be sharing one rather than being split back into their houses, would accommodate a small dining room for them as well.
Much to Harry’s surprise, Draco had not protested against the embrace. Instead he remained there in Harry’s arms.  Though he did his best to will the tears away, it hadn’t worked and he was sure Harry had noticed but he could hardly be arsed to care, he was still too scared and it seemed the only thing that helped was Harry’s arms wrapped firmly around his midsection.
Hours later, saw Harry in a bed a St. Mungo, against his protests. His ribs were on the mend and his headache from his concussion was receding thanks to the lovely mediwitch that had brought him his potions.
“How?”
“Sirius Black, the last living Black heir, left me the house. I was to live with him there once all was said and done but…..” Harry faltered, his voice stuck in throat.
Harry’s heart warmed at the easy contact and he smiled, practically ear to ear.  He quite liked the sound of Malfoy’s laugh he realized.  As he was wont to do, he disregarded all thought for consequences and pulled Draco into him, crashing their lips together. In a small moment of panic, Harry considered pulling away and apologizing but Malfoy grounded himself with one hand on the back of Harry’s neck and the other on Harry’s thigh then deepened the kiss all in one movement.
“Not you too!” Harry threw his hands up and launched himself off the sofa before stomping up to his room.  If Hermione, or any of the others for that matter, were surprised with Draco’s spoken agreement with Hermione, Harry hadn’t noticed.
Harry and Draco would spend the night before Christmas Eve curled in on each other, Draco lamenting about his fear of losing Harry and Harry in turn, whispering promises and love into the soft corners and edges of Draco’s skin and together they would continue to build up their home and their happiness. And if anyone would catch a glimpse of gold and silver magic shimmering and swirling about them, they would only look on in wonder and watch as the two intertwine and weave about each other then gently fade away again.
Draco merely huffed out a laugh. “The only thing Harry will unfortunately die from, is his own stupidity. I however pride myself on being capable and quick-witted.”
“It’s just nasty snake is all!” Shouted one of the boys. “You should be thanking us! We’re doing what you did!”
“You are utterly ridiculous Potter.” Draco laughed, and leaned against Harry’s shoulder.
“Idiot.” Draco shook his head as he helped Harry readjust, muttering charms to numb the pain that was blossoming across Harry’s mid-section. “Dolohov. Apparently, you and yours had obliviated him? I’m not sure how he got his memories back, nor how he even managed to make it through our wards but I do have some veritaserum in my potions stores we could use.”
“Draco?” Harry’s voice was rough in his throat.”
For nearly two weeks Harry let that night with Draco play in his head on repeat. It fueled him through his anger, his sadness.  He let himself feel the weight of everything that had happened.  He let the memory of that night become the catalyst that allowed him to let out every negative emotion he had been harboring deep down since before he could even remember.  His life with the Dursley’s, his escape from them only to be marred by the constant threat of death all the way up until the battle.  He let himself be angry, he let himself grieve.  And he let his magic flow through him, unbridled and unchecked.  Harry held himself back just enough to not destroy Grimmauld entirely.  He let his magic strip the family tapestry from the wall and tear through the house, room after room.  Brilliant swirls of gold and orange tore through the furniture, through knick-knacks and books and heirlooms.  He brought down entire walls. He sat and saw each face before him, his friends and family he had lost in the war, and he let his magic all but gut No. 12 Grimmauld Place.
She held her son, because truly that’s what Harry had become to her.  She squeezed him tight and welcomed him back, and Harry returned the hug with such heartfelt emotion that he made Molly cry.
“Harry.” Hermione crossed her arms and leveled her best glare at him.
Upon their return to Grimmauld that night, Harry explained everything to Draco.  The war, how it ended, and how Draco’s own mother protected Harry.
“Potter! You’re supposed to be watching him. No sitting there giggling to yourself like some blithering fool!” Draco bit out as he snatched his wand back from Harry’s grasp.  “You’ll be going to St. Mungo’s once we’re done here.”  Dacro then proceeded to cast several body binding spells on Dolohov’s still unconscious form before casting Rennervate and forcing the vial of veritaserum down the man’s throat.
“No shit Potter!” Draco spat back. It was then that Harry noticed the rather sour complexion of Draco’s expression and the fear that flashed through his eyes.  His first thought was that Draco was probably living his worst nightmare, all over again.
The other two boys, the ones tormenting the younger Slytherin, had enough sense to stop what they were doing and look on in fear but they weren’t fast enough to get away from Harry. Who had grabbed the Gryffindor on the right and with a rather large amount of force, shoved him straight into the Gryffindor on the left, toppling them both over and down onto the floor.
“Where are the others?” Harry asked, his head still swimming in confusion.
That very evening, by dinnertime the entire school understood that the only thing worse than a dressing down from the Headmistress, was a dressing down from none other than Harry Potter himself. And while the rest of the students all chatted away in mixtures of awe and fear, the very few Slytherin children ate their dinner in peace, hopeful that their continued years at Hogwarts would not be in fear.
The next morning, they two awoke together, still embraced in one another.
“Fiendfrye Potter! That was fiendfyre you were fucking with! You could have killed yourself, or worse me! Or burn down this bloody castle! You need to fucking control yourself Potter!” Malfoy was yelling, his chest heaving, and his eyes went red and glassy.
“Oh come off it.” Harry laughed, letting himself fall backwards onto the bed, pulling Draco with him.
“I got hit with a stunner and Draco struck back at Dolohov.” Harry shrugged.
“Malfoy…” Harry flinched on that last poke, his chest becoming sore.
In that moment several things occurred to Harry. The first being that there were Death Eaters still out there, the second that there was a very real chance some may still come for him. The third was that that meant Draco would be in danger but Harry was certain he’d be in more danger of Draco
It wasn’t long until Harry drifted off into a restless sleep, dreaming of wild and angry red hair, the swirl of magic pulling from beneath his skin, and the distinct metallic and burnt smell that haunted all his nightmares that involved the war.
“Malfoy….” Harry began but was only cut off once more.
“Harry!” Luna’s voice carried over the noise.  In the span of a moment Harry spun on his heel and watched as the first Gryffindor, whose face was now covered in blood, stumbled up onto his feet and pulled out his wand, pointing it straight at Harry.  In the very same moment, the air seemed to rush out of the corridor entirely, and Harry’s hair whipped about his face wildly as bright orange and gold curls of pure magic spiraled off of his skin.
“I had no choice, Granger.” Malfoy said simply, turning his nose up at her just the slightest.
Everyone in the hallway stopped and starred at him in shock. Lyra, Carina, and Julian were looking at him concerned and confused. Malfoy blinked at him slowly, “I’ll just see you later then Potter.”
“What…” Draco began trailing off, was he still dreaming?
Harry scoffed rolling his eyes, “How cliché, the cinema. Come on Draco, you can do better than that.”
"Any other secrets we should know about?" Ron laughed half jokingly. When in Merlin’s name did their lives become like a muggle Soap Opera?
Vernon chocked on his Tea spitting it all across the table, while Dudley squealed like a frightened mouse.
“Now?” Draco demanded incredulously, “At half past Nine? The suns gone down, are you mad? We’ll be late for curfew!”
Leo gritted his teeth and shoved the blond against the wall, near violently though he made sure not to actually hurt the other boy. He caught the blondes’ throat pressing just enough to get his point across without actually causing any pain, “Stay away from him.” He ordered.
Lazy, Sarcastic, Smart, Observant.
He’d heard the boy profess his hatred for his parents, so he knew that was probably true. The way he spoke reminded him eerily of himself at the boys age before the Potter’s took him in. He sighed thinking over everything he’d heard them saying before he entered.
Draco chuckled before spotting Black and Nott and sobering up quickly, he cleared his throat and sat up straight.
“Huh?” Harry asked dazedly, had the boy said something?
“For now your mission is to gather information, the more you know the better. Keep your ears to the ground and do your best to be subtle. I don’t care what house they’re in you hear something you think we need to know make a mental note and keep an ear out for more, understood?” Julian ordered crossing his arms as he gazed at them seriously.
Draco didn’t let him, pulling his wrist away, “You know I’m sort of glad you brought this up, ‘m beginning to feel like that’s all you want from me,” he threw back still looking hurt.
"So?"
~Present~
Lyra scoffed, “As she should, the news papers and other students spew enough wild accusations and assumptions as it is, we don’t need to be throwing them at each other.” She snapped before stalking out after their cousin.
HPDM HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDM
Tracy hugged her friend, the two nearly slumping to the floor in relief, they didn’t have any proof this group could keep them alive, but the small chance that they could, the ability to choose… it was just too priceless to risk losing.
Julian smiled lazily, “Please, what would you do without me?”
"Violet Evans… Lily's twin?" Remus tried, not understanding why his friend didn’t recognize Lily’s sisters’ name.
Tracy nodded jerkily, a prominent blush on her cheeks,” glancing around nervously her eyes landing on Daphne. The girl looked uncomfortable sitting alone near the furious group of (Not quite) Death Eaters.
Harry cheered, before dragging an incredibly confused Draco over to the car, and began explaining what if was and what it was for. The intrigued look on the blondes face made Lily smile. She’d been so worried that Harry’s Birthday would end in disaster, but Draco had actually managed to save the day in an admittedly unusual way, but here you have it. She hugged herself loosely, wishing not for the first time that James was here, unharmed and open minded so he could see just how
“I got it,” Millie promised smiling weakly. She was worried about Leo as well. She’d noticed his rapid mood swings and the dark circles under his eyes, but as a Slytherin, was better at hiding her concern. She grabbed Daphne’s hand and hurried the girl off.
“Well I’m gone, enjoy your Bath Potter.” Draco drawled heading for the door.
“My apologies, may I ask who you are, and why you sent me this mirror in the first place?” Draco asked hesitantly, the man looked somewhat familiar actually.
“Malfoy, this is Adrian Pucey,” Blaise introduced casually, with an absent wave of his hand.
"I know," Sirius deadpanned, looking annoyed that Remus was repeating himself, and frustrated with the clinging clothes, "We just said that."
Draco climbed off of him (Much to Harry’s dismay) and leaned back against the head board propping his elbows on his knees, “Touch yourself, I want to see it.”
Harry glanced up in surprise at the innocently curious frown on the blondes face, “Malfoy, yeah I’m good.”
“Ever been Ice skating?” The taller teen asked, blinking in surprise at the horror and immediate resistance of the smaller teen.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Leo chuckled before digging into his cloak pocket, and pulling out a beautifully designed cloak, “This is a family heirloom, so please be careful with it.”
the girl if Zabini was out for her blood. Leo whipped round eyeing her sternly, his expression stiff. Lyra rolled her eyes at her twin and cousin.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “How will that-”
"Ninety-eight?" Remus asked raising an eyebrow, he was almost too afraid to ask.
“Hallo Liebes (1),” Amelia pulled the blonde from her Husband pressing a firm kiss to his cheek. Draco quickly masked his surprise, spotting the sharp spark of irritation in the woman’s eyes, they’d heard the Dursley’s and were providing a united front against them. He could do that, he could
“The dark side doesn’t use Charms, they use Jinx’s and Hex’s the darker side of Charms work. I prefer to spend my time weaving peaceful and soothing charms and spells. When I was a small child and first learned about charms, I gathered every book I could find on the subject. Looking through books I learned about Charm weavers. Researchers who weave charms into objects, to make them do magical things, things that make people happy. Like moving paintings, color changing flowers or ribbons, plush toys that expand or shrink based on a certain word or phrase. I want to make people smile or laugh with my work… I don’t want to taint such wondrous thing with hate and violence.” Daphne whispered quietly, as if unsure of how her admittance would be received.
Leo and the others looked at him sharply. Had they slipped? How did he figure it out? They’d been so careful.
“I don’t need protection,” Draco informed the room at large, because everyone seemed to be listening “Malfoy’s don’t rely on others to defend them, that’s foolhardy at best, your effectively putting your life in the hands of a potential traitor, one slip in loyalty and your dead. Keep your minions Parkinson, Malfoy’s do things themselves. After all, it’s the only way it’ll get done right the first time.”
"Anyway! We need to tell you something important," Sirius interrupted uncomfortably, glaring at his amused friend.
Lyra shot back a reproachful look, “Draco.”
Leo sat back and scowled. No… Carina couldn't like that snake. She was his cousin and he wouldn't share her. Theo would only hurt her and then Leo would have to hurt him.
Hermione covered her mouth to silence her tears, slowly sinking down in her chair again, but she didn’t try to fight them this time. She would be crying for the rest of the day after her Father got home. Apparently they had decided she was old enough to know now.
Somehow that didn’t sooth the blonde’s nerves, and Draco let him know with a pointed look. Blaise led them through the Sixth Year Common room ignoring the curious eyes of the sixth years that had migrated up for more privacy. Glancing around Blaise made a beeline for the Door that had their names etched in Silver plates above it.
Julian shrugged nonchalantly reaching into his pouch again and pulling out four more sheets of parchment. He handed them over, clearing his throat to ease his nerves. He wasn’t sure he should be telling them this. The Twins had always paid more attention to him then Percy or Ginny. He’d understood Charlie and Bill’s need to escape their overly controlling Mother but the Twins had always treated him more like family then anyone.
Leo chuckled seeming perfectly composed, “Are you nervous kitten?” Draco squirmed when he nipped lightly at a tender part of his neck.
“I’ll relax when you put your wand away,” Draco snapped, eyeing the arm Zabini had settled casually under the table.
Sirius nodded gratefully before frowning, looking like he was really trying to figure it out, before he froze seeming to understand, "Someone wanted us to, but why? Who?"
“Ah, I think we learned about this in Muggle studies, but I’ve never actually seen one. So we just sit here and watch it?” Draco asked glancing at the raven haired boy.
"My Father and Mother," Harry guessed rubbing his face and temples trying to relieve his headache.
Julian shrugged lazily dipping a hand down to pat the pups head, “One of the Crup’s is teething, I’m pretty sure it’s Moony here.”
Carina jerked back in shock, a sharp pain in her heart, so both her parents "But he's…"
Draco shrugged carelessly, “Not a thing.” He muttered shoving another grape in his mouth.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
“It’s because as soon as you graduate, as soon as you walk out those main doors everything in life will be handed to you on a silver platter.” Professor Whinsaw spat, the glass inkwell on his desk exploded causing Draco to jump back in shock. The Professor straightened his robes smartly sneer still firmly in place. “And those of us more worthy, more qualified will be brushed aside and forgotten for our lack of status.”
The tiny elves eyes widened in horror, “Oh No, no, no, no, no! Pipsy and Nixie is to be fetching Masters Kitten and friends personally. Goats is being nosey old bag, and we is being good elves!” The other elf explained seriously, the two puffed up importantly as they snapped their fingers and three elves appeared with a crack and began taking their bags.
Harry sighed knowing she wouldn’t give up until she had a proper distraction. And despite her blasé attitude, Harry remembered hearing her crying as she asked him if they could all possibly meet up that night. They'd all agreed to meet here, where Hermione told them the news, acting for all the world like it didn’t bother her. She wasn’t fooling either of them, and she knew it, Harry knew she appreciated they’re faked ignorance anyhow.
The Beginning of the summer
! Draco wasn’t even sure how he’d made it through the door without getting stuck. It must have been charmed to expand or something.
“Would it?” Draco demanded eyes skeptical as he glared at the younger boy.

Theo shifted uncomfortably as Leo slowly stood from his chair in front of the fire a cold glare curling his features frighteningly. This was definitely not the mask, and Carina had jumped to the wrong conclusion this time.
“So, will you and Millie join us in Hogsmeade or did you both have previous engagements?” Leo inquired wrapping an arm around Lyra who’d attached herself to his side in a tight hug.
Julian smirked at Carina, “Isn’t second year the year Malfoy’s Elf began stalking Leo?”
“Don’t you give me that poor Dudley tripe Isabel! The boys a menace!” Jonathan snarled, eyes burning with anger.
Blaise grunted shooting an annoyed scowl at the blonde, “A dirty little secret we obviously share Malfoy, keep up, or I may just abandon you here myself.”
Draco Malfoy was getting frustrated. Never in his life had anyone resisted him so vehemently. He was actually beginning to get self-conscious. Was he ugly? No people were always telling him how attractive he was. Was he incapable of making a straight man gay? He'd done it to Marcus Flint albeit unintentionally.
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
Orion merely laughed, “Come on you dodgy tosser, or did you forget we have classes tomorrow and Draco and Mikhail have no idea where their dormitories are?”
Leo scowled at the mouthy little blonde, he was getting tired of talking about the other ‘boy’ “He personally offended me… I’ve made it my mission to destroy him,” Leo informed him, studying his nails pointedly, while trying to understand why he felt the sudden urge to rip the older boy several different new ones in the most painful ways possible.
“Right sorry mate.” “Hello Harry!”
Fred and George exchanged an uncertain glance.
“Soon kitten, very soon.” Draco smirked covering his fingers with the slick Lube rubbing his thumb against his index middle and pointer in an attempt to warm them up, before circling the ring of muscles with his index finger to warn him before pressing lightly against the trembling bud.
“Ow OW! Get em Potter! Smack that Ass!”
Draco frowned, feeling mildly insulted, “So I was an excuse?”
“Draco Malfoy,” She called out, though everyone was already expecting it.
He started remembering why he was rushing he tossed the note on the hall table and rushed up to his room. Dashing across the room he threw open his window and quickly climbed out into the tree and climbed up until he reached what he’d dubbed his branch. He had the perfect view of his neighbor’s back yard. The boy was already on his broom swooping and gliding through the air the boy paused for a second causing Harry to frown and wonder if he’d been spotted. That was all he needed. He knew his little habit was weird, and maybe kind of creepy. All he needed was for the boy to think he was a strange Tree Top Stalker or something. He didn’t really stalk the boy even he just liked to watch him while he flew around on his broom… okay maybe he did. But he couldn’t help it. The boy just looked sooo good when he was flying.
Neville took a bite of a pastry as he thought about it. “She might have something there, Harry.”
Mr Malfoy picked up his cane and held it so that the snake headed handle was in front of Harry's face.
“Thanks.”

to attack him last night. You were all there, you saw the snake lie down and leave him alone after I spoke to it!”
“A letter that you dictate out loud to. It then repeats the words to the recipient. Usually with a lot of yelling,” Mrs Malfoy said.
“Oh. Was she in any other clubs or, er, extra-curricular things?”
Snape watched Harry grind the bones in silence for a while before speaking. “Is there anything you wanted to ask about your mother?”
“Because Parselmouths are often Dark wizards. The last known Parselmouth was in fact the Dark Lord.”
The grounds were covered in snow, and they chose to give a wide berth to a group having a snowball fight. As they curved their way around to Hagrid's cabin, they could see smoke rising from the chimney.
Draco was frowning too. “Doesn't this mean that you'll be blamed this time, too? I mean, most of the students think it's Harry, but if the staff know that you got expelled for the last time...”
Blaise shrugged. “That's their problem.”
“Sorry.”
Draco tilted his head. “Who the hell is she?”
There was a beat of silence as the entire Gryffindor team turned to look at Harry. It was broken by Gemma.
“What terrible planning. You would think they would wait until the Hogwarts rush is over, considering most students buy their books here,” grumbled Draco as they squeezed inside.
“It was in me third year, that the Chamber got opened and I was expelled for it,” Hagrid said quietly. “They snapped me wand and I had no where ter go – me dad died the year before – but Dumbledore arranged for me to stay on and become gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.”
“Who is it?” Harry wanted to know.
“Shh!” Draco glared at him. “And, well, yes, I suppose it would. But don't mention that while we're here, alright? I don't want my father thinking that!”
“I won't be for long if you don't let go,” Harry said breathlessly.
“Yes Mistress?” Tilly asked after she Apparated in.
Harry glanced at Fawkes again before he replied. “I see. Is that all, Professor?”
“Friends that don't write to Harry Potter?”
The Gryffindors' glares intensified, but they moved down the table. Draco sat back in satisfaction. “I didn't think that would actually work. I'm going to have so much fun with this.”
Mrs Malfoy glared at the Dursleys as they took in her words, then put her hand on Draco's shoulder. “Come along, boys. The sooner we're out of this place, the better.”
“I think I'd know if someone liked me, you git.”
,” said Harry.
“Are your possessions in here, Harry?” Mrs Malfoy asked him. He nodded silently, wishing there was some way he could stop either Malfoy from seeing inside the cupboard. Mrs Malfoy waved her wand again, and pulled open the door. He dragged out his trunk and broomstick quickly, and tried to shut the door but Mrs Malfoy put out a hand. It was shaking as she looked down at the old mattress Harry used to sleep on.
One morning Harry was walking across the Entrance Hall with Pansy and Millicent when they noticed a small crowd in front of the notice board. They made their way over and the group scattered as they noticed Harry.
“Not dead? Why's she all stiff then?” Filch asked.
Hermione's response was drowned out by the entrance of the rest of the Slytherin team, who were bearing a pile of sweets clearly pilfered from the kitchens.
Hermione took a sip of pumpkin juice and nodded. “And of course the story's spread all through Gryffindor, probably the whole school by now. Some of the other Gryffindors have been more vocal than usual about their opinions on Neville and I being friends with you.”
Harry quickly stood close to Draco as the teachers moved through the crowd. The rest of the second year Slytherins carefully gave Vince and Greg a wide berth, as they'd all seen first hand their clumsy wand-work. Harry winced a little as he saw Hermione pair off with Neville.
“I said be quiet, Draco!”
The two teachers strode to the far ends of the stage before turning to face each other. Snape jerked his head at Lockhart, who was bowing elaborately. They straightened up and held their wands up like swords.
“Hagrid!” Dumbledore bellowed, silencing Hagrid. “I don't think Harry did anything.”
“Over reacting? Harry, Hagrid has just informed us that there is a colony of giant, man-eating spiders living in the forest. I think I'm being rather calm given the situation,” Draco said. “What's to stop them picking off students?”
“Follow me, Potter,” she said.
be taught.”
“So you're talking to me again?”
Twenty minutes later they were on their way to the Slytherin common room when Harry stopped. “Let's go see Snape instead.”
Theo rolled his eyes. “We know you're full of it Malfoy. And the Dark Lord was pretty active last year for someone who's supposedly dead, so it's not that far-fetched. You've still got good odds, so what's the problem?”
The pixies wasted no time in escaping the cage. They flew around the room and soon most people were cowering under their desks. Four of them grabbed Vince's bag and lifted it above his head as he jumped up trying to get it back. Greg had his jumper pulled over his head and a pixie was hitting him with the blackboard duster as he tried to free his head. The girls in the front row were being bombarded with inkwells, and one pixie pulled Harry's glasses off his face and threw them across the room.
“We have. Like last time, it was Voldemort,” Dumbledore said, ignoring the way Fudge jumped at the name. “Only this time, he was working by proxy, though this diary.”
Harry considered this. “Would it be okay if I burnt them, instead?”
“I'm not
********
“Perfect,” Harry muttered, opening his trunk. He carefully pulled out the preserved daisy chain Daphne had given him last year and hung it from one of his bed posts. He could redecorate, too.
They stared in silence, before Draco shook his head.
“Plus I think Snape would be more than capable of making an undetectable poison,” Pansy added.
The twins looked at her, gobsmacked, but Harry grinned. “Try out next year, then,” he suggested.
Daphne smiled and shrugged. “Nothing wrong with being friendly.”
Harry and Draco bowed at each other and grinned.
Harry tore his gaze away from the peacocks to find Draco standing outside a small shed, situated in front of a Quidditch pitch.
Harry cocked his head. “Well, if I'm looking at a snake, I don't need to think about it. I didn't even realise I wasn't speaking English until you pointed it out last year. But if I'm talking to you, I sort of think of what I want to say, then imagine I'm talking to a snake.”
” Harry cried. A flash of red light, and Draco's wand was spinning out of his hand. He shot a surprised look at Harry and went to retrieve it. Harry took the moment to look around the hall. Pansy seemed to have succeeded, as Millicent was wandless and currently had Pansy in a headlock instead. As Harry watched in amusement, Snape made his way over to them.
,” the snake said, before slithering away.
Draco started off for the dungeons before he realised Harry wasn't following him. “Potter! Come on, you prat!”
“Even Muggle Studies? You probably know more than the teacher,” Pansy said scornfully.
“Dobby, come here!” Draco shouted quickly.
Just as Harry was about to shove Draco back, Mr Malfoy strode into the foyer, buckling his cloak around his shoulders. “Come along, I want to get this over and done with.”
Harry wandered back into his dorm and found everyone else still asleep. He frowned at them blearily before he remembered it was Sunday. “Because yesterday was Quidditch. And after the match we had a party. Didn't we?” Harry trailed off as he realised he couldn't even remember the outcome of the match. They'd played Ravenclaw, that much he was sure of. “What's wrong with me?” he muttered.
Harry sighed. “We should get back. Thanks for tea Hagrid. And, er, sorry if we upset you.”
Harry laughed. “You'll be fine. Besides, if Flint does get angry, he'll just take it out on Wood, not you.”
“Because I do not want you using it to visit Miss Granger. I recall your attempting to visit Mr Potter in the infirmary last year, and under no circumstances are you to repeat that behaviour this time.”
Harry frowned at the index as he replied distractedly. “Maybe it can't be taught?”
Not for the first time, Harry went to sleep feeling bitter over just how much he'd missed out on, living with the Dursleys.
it with you?”
When Mr Malfoy raised an eyebrow, Draco jumped in again. “Harry's a Parselmouth, Father.”
Snape's eyes darted towards the diary. “Destroy the diary, right,” he muttered.
“Don't you want to throw something at me?” came a quavery voice.
“Mother has some salve that will get rid of them, don't worry,” Draco assured Harry when he showed him his stomach.
Ollie lifted his head in interest. “
“Professor, I swear to you that –”
Hagrid dropped his arms, causing more feathers to flutter to the ground. “Right, then. I'll, uh, wait outside then.”
Harry stared at him. “Nothing you can do about a teacher removing all the bones in my arm?”
“Fetch Draco.” When the elf disappeared, Mrs Malfoy turned to Harry. “Is anything wrong?”
They walked forward slowly. There was something shining on the wall at the end of the corridor, reflected from a puddle on the floor. Coming closer, they saw there was water leaking out from a door, bouncing torchlight back onto the walls. There was something written in large letters.
“Of course. I'll just run up and get my scarf and meet you back here,” she said before trotting off.
When the train pulled up at Hogsmeade station they piled out onto the bustling platform. Harry looked around and spotted Hagrid and waved.
His message delivered, the dwarf got off Harry and set off to find his next victim as the crowd laughed. Harry gave a weak chuckle as he gathered up the rest of his things and rejoined his housemates. He noticed vaguely there was something strange about the diary, but couldn't think what. Draco took a look at his face and glared over at the line of first years.
“Why this year?” Snape suddenly asked.
“Dead or not, its gaze remains deadly,” Snape replied. He conjured up a leather bag and levitated the diary – still with the fang stuck in it – inside it, before shutting it and slinging the strap over his shoulder. “Let's get out of here.”
Harry left them to their chess game and returned to his room. He changed happily into his new pyjamas, wondering how long it would take until he stopped grinning foolishly every time he put on his new clothes.
They Apparated onto one end of platform 9 ¾. “Come along Harry, you don't want someone Apparating on top of you,” Mrs Malfoy said as she gently guided him forward.
“Of course I did, you prat. You should have seen your face! Of course, you'll get to see it tomorrow in the
He held up a small hand mirror. Harry stared at it before shaking his head.
“It's not often I have students who show enough potential in the subject to make it worth my time,” Snape said.
“So you can teach. You just need to be properly motivated!” Draco beamed at him.
“I can't!”
“Perhaps yours are too low,” Snape smirked back. “Mr Potter, I'll see you tomorrow. Don't be late.”
“Madam Pomfrey!” Draco called out.
“It's fine,” Ginny said firmly. “They were perfectly nice to me. When they were speaking English, that is.”
The ghost glared at them sullenly. “As if you don't know who I am. The only time anyone ever visits me is to make fun of me. Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! What a fun new game!”
Ollie had said that too fast for Draco, so Harry had to translate. Draco nodded. “
They both nodded. “He's going to win,” Greg said.
“I'm not proud of it. I joined shortly after leaving school, when I was young, angry and alone. That does not excuse what I did. But I realised my mistake, and offered my services to the headmaster as a spy. I have spent the rest of my life trying to atone for my foolishness.”
“We fell asleep,” Draco said.
“Do you know what this is?” Snape asked.
Hagrid released Fang after he shut the door and went to put the kettle on. “What brings you two here? Thought you'd've bin up in the castle stuffin' yer faces with Christmas goodies.”
Snape opened the door and looked down at them and frowned. “Madam Pomfrey hasn't sent you here for a pain potion, has she?” At Harry's confused look, he continued. “For your arm, Mr Potter.”
Harry huffed in frustration as he tried to remain calm. “Look, I don't want to – to hurt him, or anything, alright? I just wanted to tell him that I told the snake
Hagrid's face was covered with a fuzzy balaclava, and he had a dead rooster in one hand. “Hullo, Harry. Why aren't you in class?”
,” Ollie replied, curling back up.
“Really? You don't recall setting a group of Cornish pixies loose in Lockhart's office this afternoon?” Snape raised an eyebrow.
“Isn't that a good thing?” Harry asked in confusion. He liked his new gloves; they were dark green and very soft.
“Probably because it involves Snape going to Dumbledore, who hired Lockhart in the first place,” Draco replied. “Aqua vitae.”
“Did not, you git!”
Harry took a sip of his caramel shake before replying. “Actually, if it's not too much trouble, I'd like to stop off at a supermarket. Or a convenience store.”
Draco shook his head and tore his gaze away from the door. “I'm fine,” he repeated, then crouched down. “Dobby, are you all right?”
Millicent shuddered. “Ugh. Good point.”
Snape frowned. “According to whom?”
“No, I came to talk to you about it. We only got our Hogwarts letters yesterday, I hadn't really thought about when we might go,” Harry said.
Harry held on as tight as he could as they started to rise through the air. They moved quickly, but even so, it took a while before they got to the top of the pipe. They emerged into Myrtle's bathroom.
.” The last he'd said in Parseltongue.
Pansy pointed to the ceiling, where Harry could see it was snowing heavily. “I doubt Sprout would be holding a class in this weather. If he's not still at breakfast or in the Hufflepuff common room, I'd try the library, if you want to find him. He's a bit of a nerd, and spends a lot of time in there studying.”
“If Harry writes one word to my son that he has been mistreated as he has this summer, I shall return, and I shan't be nearly as pleasant as I have been today. I will likewise return if Draco writes to Harry and does not receive an answer from Harry. Believe me when I say I am quite capable of making each of your lives as miserable as you have made Harry's. Believe me also when I say I have many powerful friends in high places, and I am not afraid of reprisal for anything I may do to you.”
,” Harry said quickly.
Harry spent the rest of lunch trying to sort through what Hermione and Neville had told him. They chatted to each other as Harry silently followed them down to Potions, where he was so distracted he almost missed a step in his Hair-Raising Potion.
“As long as it's not Lockhart,” said Harry.
“Yes,” answered Snape. “Can you stand?”
“Quidditch matches are back on!” shouted Wood.
Daphne made a face. “Ugh, boring. Maybe I'll catch you later,” she said, then returned to her family. Harry saw a younger girl who had to be her sister; she looked like a miniature Daphne.
Draco shook his head. “Quirrell's gone, this had nothing to do with it. Anyway, you've more important things to worry about.”
“Right, okay. Thanks,” Harry muttered. The elf disappeared, and Harry made his way next door.
With a sigh Harry rolled out of bed and started getting dressed. He mustn't have been as quiet as he'd thought, because Draco immediately emerged from his own bed fully dressed.
Harry looked at Draco in alarm when he made a strange choking sound. “Am I missing something?”
“And we couldn't find the lock, sir,” added Harry.
“You enjoyed that way too much, you git.”
“Is this true Mr Potter?”
As the staff exchanged worried glances, Harry lay back and stared at the ceiling. He had the feeling that both Dobby and Dumbledore knew more than they were letting on, and while he knew there was nothing he could do about Dumbledore, he did have leverage over Dobby. All he had to do was tell Draco that it was Dobby who had tampered with the Bludger, and Draco would immediately write to his parents.
Draco had gone pale. “This is from my father. He... He says that Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.”
Harry dug through the mess on his bed and handed it to her. She turned it over curiously, jumping a little when she pressed the eject button and the tape compartment popped open. She delicately closed it again then waved her wand over it before handing it back.
“I tried to,” Harry said weakly.
“But then they'll just get out again,” Millicent objected. “Hitting them was fun, but I've got better things to do with my time.”
Harry glared down at the words before scrawling an angry answer.
Draco hissed angrily. Harry put his hand on his shoulder, but Draco shook it off. “
They walked on, and soon left the formal gardens behind, and entered a vast expanse of lawn, bordered by yet more hedges. There were pale statues scattered over the grass, a large marble gazebo off to the side, and a man-made pond at the base of the gentle slope.
“May I speak with Mr Ainsley, please?” Mrs Malfoy asked calmly. Apparently she was used to the service here.
********
Harry completed the rest of his chores in a much better mood than he'd begun them with, but his bad mood soon returned when he saw the meagre dinner Aunt Petunia had provided for him. He ate it sourly as he eyed the pork roasting in the oven. He'd be happy once this dinner with the Masons was over. Sullenly, he made his way up to his room, ignoring Uncle Vernon's final warning as the doorbell rang.
Snape smirked. “So it's not a fluke then?”
“Is this true, Mr Malfoy?” Dumbledore asked.
“Er, I wanted to borrow some hairpins from you, actually. If you have anything that looks like this?” Harry showed her his photocopied instructions.
“You are not responsible for what Riddle made you do. The headmaster said as much, and neither the Minister nor the Aurors said anything about holding you responsible.”
“Who's at the end there?” Harry asked Gemma.
“No. I'm afraid that Professor Lockhart didn't break any school rules. While I understand it led to an uncomfortable night for you, you're all right now. So no harm done.”
“Wow.” Harry put the box carefully back on his bed before launching himself onto Draco's, sending piles of presents flying onto the floor as he hugged him. “Thanks Draco!”
“Yeah. I stayed at Draco's house during the summer, and his parents found out then. Draco knew last year. He actually told me how rare it was, before that I just assumed everyone could do it. So now I'm teaching him.”
“Draco,” Snape began.
“Come
When they walked through the gates, Harry felt a hand grab his upper arm, and a second later came the horrible twisting crush of Apparition. They reappeared in an alcove in the Leaky Cauldron. Mr Malfoy handed Draco a bag of coins. “I've errands to run. I'll meet you two at Flourish and Blotts in two hours.”
“I just didn't want you being a moody prat,” Draco muttered, going pink.
Draco sniggered. “Trust Hermione to sneak two boys into her bedroom and then want to solve mysteries.”
Draco gave Harry a hug. “Come and have some tea, at least.”
“That Parselmouth book isn't very long because there haven't been many of you,” Draco explained. “But the snake book looks at every species of snake, both magical and non-magical. And there's a section at the back that lists their uses in potions, and –”
“Isn't it obvious? He likes you!”
Harry turned to Ginny. “Want to play Exploding Snap?”
“No, not you. Need Pomfrey...” Harry said.
” Dumbledore strode through the crowd, with a trail of teachers behind him. He moved around the students to gently lift Mrs Norris from the wall. “Come with me, Argus. Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy.”
“Yes, sir. Dobby has heard of Harry Potter's greatness, and his goodness. But Dobby has never been asked to shake a wizard's hand before.”
“He quit,” said George.
“Finish packing Harry's things, would you? Honestly, Potter, you're such a Muggle sometimes.”
“Snape and McGonagall,” Millicent said instantly.
As if to prove his point, the twins bounded over and pushed Ron out of the way.
Tom laughed again. “Of course he was around, you fool.”
“She gave you her special smile. The one with all the dimples,” Draco persisted.
“But – why'd you take so long to buy nice clothes? And there are so many things you don't have that you should buy!”
“Seriously, who chooses their passwords?” Draco whispered in Harry's ear as they slipped in behind her.
“Right.” Harry turned back around to see Ron gripping his wand nervously.
“I wanted to talk to Professor Snape, sir. About tomorrow?” Harry looked at Snape, hoping he hadn't changed his mind.
Harry tried to remain calm. “And why did you do that?”
“And another Beater,” Draco called from the corner. “Gemma's quitting to focus on her NEWTs.”
“No. Come on, let's get out of here,” Draco replied.
Draco shook his head. “I'm not. Just before the match, the three of us were in the Entrance Hall. Harry heard that voice again, only this time, I did, too. Hermione said she thought she knew something, then said she had to go to the library. We didn't think anything of it, really, as that's normal for her.”
“Thanks,” Harry said in embarrassment.
“No, I'll be too busy. Do well in school, and you'll get that broom if you get on the Quidditch team.”
Draco muttered something under his breath, causing Hermione to turn accusing eyes on Harry. He met her gaze placidly before looking back up at the ceiling.
“Well, no. Dobby told me what happened, you see.”
As soon as she was free, Pansy skipped back a metre and stuck out her tongue at Millicent. Snape didn't see as he walked over to Harry.
Back in the dungeons, Harry made straight for his bed while Draco rounded up the other boys. Something made Harry pick up Tom's diary to say a quick hello before heading down to the Quidditch pitch.
“That's just ridiculous,” Pansy said. “You'll burn out in a month and end up like Harry here.”
Hermione narrowed her eyes and huffed, but didn't say anything. Draco smirked and walked into the kitchen, leaving them alone in the corridor.
When they got there, there was a crowd of kids in front of the window, and they had to push through to get a glimpse of the new broom. Draco stared at it enviously, while Harry told himself that his old Nimbus 2000 was flying just fine.
“They're probably right,” Harry said, not taking his eyes off the dust mote that was floating above him. His reverie was broken some time later by Pansy hitting him with a pillow. “Ow.”
As they set off, Harry couldn't stop the grin from spreading over his face. “Thank you for coming to get me.”
As the crowd applauded wildly, Lockhart dumped his entire works into Harry's arms. Harry took the opportunity to escape and quickly headed back to Draco. He found him pink in the face from laughter.
“Yes,” Snape nodded. Harry smothered a laugh and looked at Draco, whose lips were twitching through his frown.
Harry grinned. Another thing he had in common with his mum. “What was her worst subject?”
“Harry! What are you doing in here?” Daphne squealed from her bed.
Harry shrugged. “Well, it's a stone castle, isn't it? Besides, he said in a chapter on fire crabs that he's an expert on dousing fires and repairing any damage caused, sir.”
“Yeah. But it was pretty easy since I had the Potions master all to myself.”
“You mean apart from playing my new favourite game of Let's Throw Things at Myrtle?” Draco shrugged. “Maybe it's a new and inventive way of littering.”
A muscle twitched in Snape's jaw. “Indeed.”
Harry nodded once and left fuming, giving Hagrid a quick, grimace-like smile as he passed him on the stairs. He was late for Charms now, but didn't feel like going to class. Figuring he could always tell Flitwick that he'd been held up by Dumbledore, he headed straight for the Slytherin common room. There were a few students out in the corridors at this time, and they all shied away from him as he passed, doing nothing to improve his mood.
Mrs Malfoy's face took on a curious expression as she replied. “It was nothing, Harry, really. The clothes those Muggles had forced on you were atrocious. It was about time you got to choose something you like. In fact, when we get home, I'll destroy your old clothes for you, if you like.”
Draco led him into a large dining room. There was a marble fireplace along one wall, and a long table that could have easily seated twenty people. There were four places set at one end of the table. As Draco and Harry took their seats on one side, a house-elf popped up beside them and poured them each a goblet of iced water before disappearing again.
Theo snorted and shook his head, as Gemma shifted into Prefect mode and started lecturing Harry.
Tilly bowed and disappeared, leaving Harry alone in his room. He filled his mug, piling it high with marshmallows, then began sorting out his mail. It took him a few hours and many mugs of hot chocolate until he'd read through everything and written out replies. Finally, he had letters for Hermione, Pansy, Daphne, Theo, Blaise and Tracey. He'd also made a birthday card for Neville, drawing a red and gold lion on the cover, as he knew Neville's birthday was sometime around his own.
“That voice...” Harry looked around the office, half expecting to see someone else standing there.
“Okay...” Harry was trying to figure out what any of this meant, but his brain was refusing to cooperate.
” Harry hissed quickly.
“Care for a game, Harry?”
“That was Draco,” Pansy said dismissively. “Stop interrupting my story!”
Harry gave an incredulous laugh. “Is everyone here very stoned?”
Ron watched her leave and stormed over to Draco. “Don't talk to my sister that way, Malfoy!”
Harry laughed. “You've got to admit that was pretty unexpected.”
at the time, alright? And yeah, I hate the Muggles I live with, because they're
“Damn,” Harry said feelingly.
There was an indrawn breath. “Harry –”
“Git.”
” Snape cried. A jet of red light shot out of his wand and hit Lockhart squarely in the chest. His wand flew out of his hand and he shot into the air before flying backwards off the stage to hit the wall behind it. Harry high-fived Draco as they cheered along with the other Slytherins.
“Can you see my glasses?” Harry asked Draco desperately.
and pointed at his  preening portrait on the cover. “Me. Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, third class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League and five time winner of
When their names were mentioned Flitwick hid his face in his hands and Snape exchanged a dark look with McGonagall.
“Well use your bloody brains, why don't you?” Harry snapped. “The snake was about to attack him before I spoke to it, and then it immediately stopped. It shouldn't be that hard to work out!”
There was an explosion of noise as all along the corridor classroom doors opened and people came rushing out. There were a few minutes of panicked confusion as people milled about, stepping in Nick and nearly trampling Justin. Teachers were calling for calm as Harry got pushed to the wall by some older Gryffindors. McGonagall hurried down the corridor, making a loud bang with her wand before ordering everyone back to their classes. Flitwick and Sinistra bent over Justin and the ghost to examine them. As people started to wander away, Ernie came panting up.
“My Walkman. Er, that's a portable music player.”
Harry read the instructions carefully. “It'd be the powdered dragon bone, wouldn't it? Too much of it, no, wait, it wasn't prepared properly?”
“Any time we hit it away it comes right back,” Theo put in.
Mrs Malfoy smiled slightly. “You're welcome to stay here next summer. In fact, I doubt Draco would forgive me if you didn't.”
“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,” replied Mr Weasley.
Snape chuckled. “Fear not, Mr Potter, you'll be brewing this today, not drinking it.”
When Harry and Draco had a firm hold on either hand, Mrs Malfoy gave a quick glance around them. The next thing Harry knew, Mrs Malfoy's hand jerked away from his grip, and he tightened his hand as he felt as if he were being squeezed through a tight tube. There was pressure all around him, he couldn't breathe properly and his eyes were surely being pushed into his skull and -
“That's what our dorm mates are doing. We actually needed to talk to you,” Harry said.
Harry and Snape looked up to see Slytherin's statue begin to open its mouth.
Harry smirked and deliberately jostled the bed more than necessary as he sat back against the pillows. “I got a letter from Hermione this morning. She wants to know if we can meet up in Diagon Alley. She's going there next Wednesday.”
“What happened?” Pomfrey gasped.
Harry tried to push himself up, but was still too weak to do so. Snape clasped his hand and pulled him to his feet, grabbing him by the shoulders as he swayed slightly.
When they walked into the Great Hall there was a hush as everyone turned to stare at them, before conversation started up again. Harry sat down and looked around him warily. Nearly everyone else in the hall was staring at the Slytherin table with suspicion, mostly at Harry.
Dumbledore came walking backwards into the room, with McGonagall coming after him. They were carrying something stiff between them which they hauled onto a bed. Harry raised himself slightly to get a better look as McGonagall rushed off to Pomfrey's office.
Snape held open his office door and looked at Harry in surprise. “What, all of them?”
********
“With Lockhart.”
“Yes, sir,” they chorused.
Half an hour later Harry made his way back to his own dorm. Tracey had insisted on him unlocking each girl's trunk as well as the dorm door before she declared him free to go. She'd been demanding, but Harry had to admit that she'd been very helpful.
“So, Harry, is there anything you'd like to tell me?”
Before Harry knew what was happening, Ainsley had guided him into a large changing room and was taking his measurements. He was reminded of the way Ollivander had measured him when he bought his wand, but the memory soon faded. Where Ollivander had been quiet and a little creepy, Ainsley was a cheery fellow. The way he kept saying “ah” made Harry think of a pirate, and he gave a series of friendly but detailed instructions to a non-stop stream of assistants who came in to join them. They quickly returned, each with armfuls of clothing which were hung up on hooks around the room.
“Are you saying you've used it to sneak into Gryffindor tower?”
“Fucking hell,” Draco muttered. “Here.
The boy smiled. It didn't reach his eyes. “Surely you know me by now, Harry Potter.”
in the well-lit library was quite different from trying to follow a photocopied diagram by torchlight. It didn't help that he didn't have any of the suggested tools. He was making do with some bobby pins and safety pins he'd stolen from the bathroom cabinet.
Harry fidgeted. “Er, I kind of need to look at a snake to speak it properly.”
“Why not?”
“Excellent!” Harry quickly settled himself next to Draco and they had breakfast before turning to the mail.
Given Hagrid's history with dangerous creatures, Harry doubted that, but decided now wasn't the time to press the issue. “Alright. So, they thought it was your spider. Did they ever find out what it was? Or who was behind it all?”
“No, I wouldn't say that. You've already picked up some things. Why don't you have a look in the library and see if there are any books on creating a writing system?”
“I see. Are you aware that Lockhart returned to his office to find most of the furniture in flames?”
“On it!”
“I'm glad you're back, Harry,” came a quiet voice behind him.
“Okay,” Ginny said with a smile.
,” he muttered, and retreated to his bed.
Snape looked at Harry intently. “Harry, you're not going to die. But I need you to close your eyes and keep them shut, no matter what happens. Its gaze will kill you.”
Harry took his Nimbus from her. “Thanks, Tilly.”
. He and his school mates will, in fact, be getting the real, magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”
“Harry, did you use to sleep in here?” she asked quietly.
Harry laughed. “He didn't look like he wanted to play. What about you?”
Back in the dorm, Harry pulled out the photo album Hagrid had given him the year before, and sat on his bed with the curtains drawn as he slowly flipped through it. His parents smiled and waved at him from every page, and a pang of loneliness swept over Harry as he stared down at them.
“Yes sir.”
“Waiting to see the outcome of your complaint?”
“Yes, but if it isn't, forget about me, okay?”
“Ah, I take it you've never seen a wizarding department store then?” Ainsley asked Harry as he squeezed past him. “More variety than any shop in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade. Now,” he turned his attention back to Mrs Malfoy. “How can I help you today? A new set of formal robes, perhaps?”
Harry laughed. Two of the beds had posters of what Harry assumed to be wizarding celebrities plastered around them. He caught sight of Lockhart's toothy grin and looked away to Hermione's bed, which was surrounded by piles of books and neat stacks of parchment and quills. There were two picture frames on her bedside table. One showed a Muggle photo of her with her parents, and the other had a moving photo of her with Harry and Draco.
They heard footsteps behind the curtain before it was yanked to one side to reveal a small, mousy looking man. His dark eyes lit up when he spotted his customers.
“Oh come on, it's not that bad,” Draco snapped.
Dumbledore shook his head. “I cannot say.”
“In Potions yesterday Snape told you that not chopping your caterpillars would make the potion into a depilatory. So I put mine in whole,” Theo said smugly. He pulled a small vial out of a pocket and held it up.
Gemma smiled. “He does, doesn't he...”
Harry grinned “
“Harry?”
“Stop being so modest, you prat. You're good and you know it,” Draco fixed him with a glare.
Draco pushed Harry forward. “He's sick.”
Draco began the tale again, though Harry noticed with amusement that this rendition contained a lot more swear words than the version he'd told in McGonagall's office. Harry half listened as he loaded up his plate; he was absolutely starving now that the shock was wearing off.
Myrtle twirled a pigtail around her finger as she thought about it. “Maybe.”
Harry looked up to see the Weasley twins standing in the doorway. They were looking at Harry and Draco suspiciously.
Draco sat up suddenly. “Did you reply?”
“It's going to kill someone!” Harry shouted and ran up yet more stairs. He burst onto the second floor and ran down the corridor.
. Harry held his breath as he waited for a reply. It didn't take long.
The elf was sitting on Harry's bed, his green eyes glowing in the gloom. “Harry Potter! Dobby is so sorry, sir.”
To his astonishment, the snake stopped. Both Harry and Tom stared at it as it lay there, clearly awaiting further orders. Tom opened his mouth but Snape's silencing charm was obviously still working. Tom glared at Harry and raised his wandless hands as he advanced towards him. Harry scrambled backwards on his butt.
“A drawing of the two of you saying goodbye at King's Cross.”
“Er, thanks.” Harry shrugged self-consciously. “There isn't really much else to do at the Dursleys'.”
Draco shook his head. “But he's heard it before.” Harry glared at him.
“That's barbaric,” Millicent growled.
Draco hugged him back just as strongly, then gently disentangled himself. “Harry, I'd like you to meet my mother.”
Harry looked around the wrecked classroom. “Dunno. Should we tie it shut?”
There was one more present on Harry's bed. Curious, he flipped open the card, which was filled with an elegant cursive.
As they walked along the village street, Harry couldn't help but look in every window at his reflection. He'd worn one of his new outfits out of the store, and was amazed to see how much better he looked in clothes that fit properly.
“Absolutely not, George. Carry on,” said Fred.
Dobby turned his scared face to Draco. “Dobby heard Master talking – ”
“Oh.”
With that Snape took off for the nearest pillar as Harry shut his eyes. He heard a scraping sound far above him before a colossal weight hit the ground close to him.
Harry ducked out of Lockhart's hold to pick up his bag where he'd dropped it on the floor, and stalked into the Defence room without another word. Luckily, Draco had saved him a seat in the back row. He had no desire to sit anywhere near the front of this class. He slumped down into his seat and glared at his desk.
“It tasted horrible. It burnt going down, like hot chilli, only disgusting.”
Harry stared back, before rewinding to the start of the song and putting a headphone in Draco's ear and pressing play again. “Just listen.”
Harry had no answer to this, and was uncomfortably aware that his friends were watching the conversation.
“Yes, Father,” said Draco, and walked over to hug his father.
The entire staff was looking angry, even the normally cheerful Flitwick. All except Lockhart, that was. Dressed in pink robes that precisely matched the shade of the decorative flowers, he was getting to his feet.
“Are you sure?” Hermione asked.
They said one last goodbye and boarded the train. Halfway down the carriage they found an empty compartment and entered before a group of Ravenclaws could claim it. They ignored the glares as they got settled in, and were soon joined by Daphne and Pansy. Daphne sat down between the two boys and turned to Harry.
“Probably just an article on yesterday's attack,” Blaise said.
“Because I knew that if I did not, he would most certainly follow me down into a Chamber where I had good cause to believe a basilisk lay in wait for us,” Snape said slowly, as if speaking to a small child.
“I'm not entirely sure I'm the best person to be talking to about this,” Hermione said slowly. “I think you should talk to Draco.”
“I dunno... I set a snake on Dudley at the zoo last year... And I convinced a bunch of snakes to invade the Dursleys' front garden over the summer,” Harry said with a fond smile.
