His head pokes out, then sees it’s Ginny, and sits up fully. He’s shirtless, his hair crumpled and unwashed, with a few days stubble on his chin. “Ginny?”
Really, what’s stopping him? If he doesn’t kill Dumbledore, his family dies. If he kills Dumbledore, he loses Harry. In fact, he’s already lost Harry. Every choice he makes only leads to heartbreak, to pain and loss, one way or another.
“And I lost everything,” Draco says quietly. He takes a deep breath. “This isn’t going to work. I should go.”
“—I only want to help, but you keep pushing me away! How else was I going to help you if I didn’t find out what you needed help with?”
It takes a few minutes at most, and then he hears Pansy’s door click closed, and shortly afterwards Harry walks into the room. He sees that Draco is awake, and looks surprised, then embarrassed.
Harry looks at Draco, at his apprehension, and traces the outline of the Dark Mark, ending with his fingertip on the head of the snake. Draco’s eyelids flutter shut, then open anxiously. He pulls his arm back but Harry keeps his grip around his wrist, so Draco ends up pulling Harry closer.
“I have an appointment tonight.” Draco avoids looking at Hermione. “But I can work on it tomorrow morning.”
And now he wasn’t. He will never be again, that Harry knows, and it hurts so much that it doesn’t hurt at all, his whole body numb, numb, numb, all feeling lost in the bottom of a glass of tequila, the rest of him washed on the shore of utter heartbreak.
Hermione does not understand. The game? Is this about Champagne Shackles? She creeps silently to the railing and leans over the side. She nearly gasps at what she sees.
“I could ask you the same thing,” Harry replies coolly. “Would you really have gone home with that man?”
“Draco,” Harry warns, but it’s no use, he can see the walls rising like a fortress in Draco’s shoulders, sees him pull himself up in defense. “I could help you.”
Ginny shrugs when Ron and Hermione look at her, baffled. “Dean’s waiting.” She leaves them with a grim smile like she knows something they don't, striding over to Dean who is sitting across the common room with Seamus. Dean smiles at her and Ginny kisses him briefly, sitting beside him on the couch.
Miss Granger purses her lips for a moment, then sighs. “In that case, there are certain subjects you should consider taking, though I am not sure both of you will get in.” Her eyes dart to Weasley almost unwillingly, who flushes and looks firmly away. “You will want to apply for Potions, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Government, and perhaps Charms, at the very least. Then I would highly recommend Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Alchemy as subjects that will only give more nuance and depth to your other subjects.”
“Yes,” Harry says flatly. “I knew about it. I knew but I couldn’t tell anyone because it meant Draco would get in trouble. I protected him. Though, he didn’t tell me he was going to kill Dumbledore at first.”
Everything about Luna is so different than Harry, his darkness and smolderning intensity, his agitation, his cool collectedness, his nightmares, his endless stream of sweet lies and poisonous truths. While Harry tears her world apart, Luna simply has to look at her and she steadies it.
Draco groans when the light beaming through his curtains wakes him up and stings his eyes as he tries to open them. He shifts around in bed, reaching for the covers, and his arm slams into something heavy and solid in his bed.
Inside is the same as Harry remembers it. Leather couches and velvet cushions bask in a greenish light from the lake which laps against the windows. Dark, glossy floors reflect the low ceiling, producing the effect of walking inside a layer of some posh lord, which technically, is not very far from the truth.
Suddenly the curtains are yanked to the side, and Blaise stands at the end in all his glory, shrewdly searching the bed. The light filtering in through the lake shines a halo around Blaise’s smooth, glowing skin.
He rings the doorbell, hoping he will not dump the Greek salad he had for dinner right before Harry’s feet. What’s taking him so long? He arrived a few minutes late as it is.
They both hear Pansy walk downstairs, but Draco was about to fall asleep, and so he does not move. Harry kisses Draco’s cheek, thinking he is asleep, and leaves their room. When he’s gone, Draco opens his eyes, sitting up.
“We should probably tell them,” Malfoy says in a low, caressing voice. She hears Harry make a noise of protest, and she whips her wand out on instinct. “Oh, but you don’t want to, do you? You like the game.”
Draco looks at him, the unruly dark curls falling over his forehead like tendrils of black smoke, the stormy green eyes like churning waves in the depths of a sea teeming with dangers scarcely imaginable, and that smile, the most dangerous of them all, with a wicked edge to every soft curve.
“And who’s this punk?” the buff man exclaims gruffly, but before he can advance on Harry, Draco places a light hand on his muscular arm, and shakes his head. “Well if it’s what you want,” he grumbles. Then he leaves, his mouth twisting in irritation as he passes Harry, before melting back into the crowds milling about the center of the bar.
Ginny understands, then, what has happened and her stomach drops with a sickening swiftness. Harry’s chest heaves with dry sobs and together they slowly sink down to the floor, arms around each other, blood and tears smearing across skin.
He says all this so casually and yet so honestly that the meaning registers a moment after Harry hears the words. When he realizes that this is the moment he’s always been waiting for, his chest expands and threatens to burst with excitement—but then he remembers Draco and his task and his cheeks burn in shame.
“It can only be you.” Harry threads a hand through Draco’s hair, and it’s not like anything he could imagine, slipping through his fingers like silk, like the glowing threads of a memory.
Their lives are in limbo, like this moment. A fruit hanging, swollen, on a branch, which must drop at any moment. Harry wants to stay in this space forever, without changing. He wants Draco’s face to remain still, on his pillow, like a statue, not even a twitch of his lips, or slight turn of his head. Any movement would ruin the moment forever.
After making his way past the closed double doors to the Dining Hall, he finds narrow stone steps going down into darkness. He follows them swiftly, and light sconces flicker to a glow as he passes by them along the basement corridor. Only when he reaches a bright painting of a variety of fruits and breads does he stop. He reaches out and tickles the pear.
Harry pauses, closing his eyes. The Adam’s apple in his throat shifts when he swallows. “I feel very light, like I’m falling but I
“Nothing you can do now will make me forgive you,” Harry says in a low, even voice. He looks at Draco, and it’s like they’re in Sixth Year again, his grey eyes wavering and his mouth twisted and his hands clenched at his sides. Harry wonders how he could ever think all those memories were buried with the past. “So please, don’t try.”
She keeps praying until she falls asleep, even though she knows with a damning certainty that Harry won’t hear it.
“Ginny doesn’t want to date me,” Harry says, carefully closing his book, as if sensing the interruption is leading to a longer conversation. “Trust me.”
“I’m afraid that won’t be necessary, ma’am,” Miss Granger says quietly, looking out the window. They all turn to the window and see the largest owl they have ever seen swooping down from the sky and onto their windowsill.
Suddenly he’s lurched towards Malfoy by their joined wrists, and nearly collides with his chest, stepping back just in time.
“She says he’s a mess. Won’t get out of bed. Depressed. She’s worried that…” Pansy hesitates, her hands squeezed together in front of her.
“No, Ginny,” he says forcefully. “You don’t know. You may think you know, but you really don’t know.”
Draco nods slowly, his body heavy like he’s sinking, a strong current pulling him to the bottom of a dark sea. “Right.”
“I’ve been here for quite some time,” Draco says coolly, “and only now that the Ministry has contacted me do you decide to pay a visit.” He pretends to examine his nails, then looks up at Harry, whose face has smoothed out in a skilled display of indifference.
“I am quite confused by the courses available for Eighth Years,” Miss Granger says, reading the letter again as they take their afternoon tea in the drawing room. When Harry and Weasley do not respond, Miss Granger makes an exasperated noise, looking pointedly at them. “Tell me you read the courses offered for Eighth Years. It was written in the letter, along with our supplies. Honestly, you must send your replies by tonight!”
They couldn’t hear the noises of the castle from up there, and only the sounds of owls cawing and wind whistling broke their silence.
“Right now the Auror Department doesn’t need fighters, they need healers. People strong enough to mend the deeper scars from the war. The scars I had a hand in making.”
“More sleep,” Harry mumbles. Draco feels his anxiety ebb with how undeniably adorable Harry is in the morning. He realizes this is the first time they slept through the night together.
Harry grabs her hips and she knows she’s done for. Her head rolls back in abandon. She can barely keep herself upright, her legs shaking, then spasming, as she rocks uncontrollably against Harry’s mouth.
Then he remembers his Potions exam tomorrow, and with his mouth curling in disgust, Harry trudges back to the Gryffindor tower. Someday he will find out what Draco is hiding from him.
And yet, she pities him, despite it all. He does not understand her. How could he? His eyes flash with a similar resentment that Draco had shown, as if she were hurting them, when it is really the other way around. But it’s not their fault, it’s not anyone’s fault, and she forgives them both.
Then Draco moves towards him, as if in answer to his question, curling his body around Harry’s, and looking up at him with a grave face.
Harry looks down into its clear water with dark curls like spilled ink, and after a long moment, nods shortly. Together they lower their heads into the large, glimmering basin, falling as the past rushes up from the ground.
Harry loves her for trying, for trying to heal him when he knows he never will, for loving him even when he will never love anyone like he loves Draco again, for shining a light when all he can see is darkness.
“No,” Draco interrupts softly. “I’ll go. I need to get home anyway. Pansy will surely be waiting up for me.” Harry’s head jerks up, looking at Draco with wild eyes, before forcing his gaze down at the table.
He must have froze because they stopped kissing him, pulling back. Draco brought his hands up to their face, feeling the stubble on their jaw. His hands trembled as he worked his way down to their chest, which was flat and muscular.
He sees him turning the corner up ahead, and Harry all but sprints after him. Draco turns his head, sees Harry, and scowls, increasing his pace before slipping into a boy’s bathroom. Harry holds back right at the entrance, remembering the last time he followed Draco into a bathroom.
“I guessed as much a month ago,” Hermione says. “I knew without a doubt at the Christmas party. Ron figured it out then on his own.”
Draco tugs on the waistband of his shorts, which causes Harry to stop breathing. He cannot manage to look, but he nods stiffly, hands trembling, while Draco unzips his shorts, pulling them down with uneven breaths.
Harry’s voice echoes in the night and Draco sends a desperate prayer up to the constellation of his namesake to make this moment last forever.
"Hey again, Draco," Harry said looking into his eyes, smiling easily. Why does everyone smile so much? It just confused him.
"Look, I'm gonna go get another beer," Pansy said, her eyes latching onto someone near the table littered with various beers and hard alcohols. Draco followed her gaze. Blaise Zabini.
She knows it’s not normal, but then again, when has anything in Harry’s life been normal? “I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. If it’s not from You Know Who, then it’s probably just stress.”
“Yes.” Draco’s voice is barely a whisper. He clears his throat. “I didn’t want to tell you because there wasn’t much you could help me with.”
Ginny stares at her, at the long blonde hair, the milky white skin, the trinkets dangling in her hair and hanging heavily from her necklace, the round eyes that are blue blue blue right on through, like a pool of water you can see straight to the bottom.
Then Ravenclaw hosted last weekend. To keep it brief, Harry blacked out and does not remember a single thing, although Hermione and Ron assure him that he did nothing too embarrassing.
“Don’t we all hate in our own way?” Pansy counters, and Hermione studies her face with those keen brown eyes that seem to catch the loose threads in every story. She wonders who they are really talking about now, and how truly passionate, almost borderline obsessional, that Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry can become if the fires are stoked in just the right way.
Ginny says with a grin, touching Hermione’s arm affectionately. “Sometimes I forget we aren’t still sixteen and at Hogwarts.” Her smile falters, just a little. It hurt Hermione to see it then, just as it does now. The war took so much it’s hard to find something it left whole and unscarred, even something as beautiful and joyful as new life.
Then Draco is kissing him with that insistence and attention which Harry fell in love with. Harry loves Draco intensely, and loves to be Draco’s darling, his love, and to be adored by him, to be suffocated in his embrace, to find a home underneath all that sharpness.
“I admire your insistence,” Weasley says, “but I will not be taking any of those three classes if my life depended upon it.”
They are sitting on the couch with plush, black velvet cushions, a fire burning low, and the room illuminated by hazy candlelight. Conversation has dwindled to a pregnant silence, Harry wondering how the night will end.
And Dumbledore doesn’t like the Malfoys too much, so Draco could never get close to Harry, much less even introduce himself. Only when they made it to Hogwarts, out of the watchful eye of the Headmaster, did Draco attempt a friendship.
With that, Hermione storms off, slamming the door to the girl’s dormitory behind her. Harry looks at Ron, stunned.
For a moment his eyes linger on the Headmaster’s Office, where Dumbledore’s footsteps pace back and forth tirelessly. Harry wonders what would happen if he went there now, told him everything about Draco, about the two of them together.
Hermione continues to speak animatedly, with a serious attentiveness and a generous respect for such a Death Eater as him. He can’t imagine she’d want to harm him, even if he prefers men over women, even if he’s in love with Harry Potter.
Harry twists out of the way, and the spell skitters like a monstrous spider across the floor, ripping apart the tile. He counters with a Bat Bogey Hex, which Draco dodges.
“How did you—what—Harry,” Ginny stutters, right before Harry collapses into her arms, and it takes all her strength to keep them both standing. “Harry, you’re scaring me.”
that started it all. Maybe it was just there all along, dormant underneath years of passed insults and injuries.
He feels Draco’s cock sliding against his leg, a gentle reminder. Harry bites Draco’s skin. He slips a thigh between Draco’s legs, nudging him open, and with his hand he grabs Draco’s erection, firm and smooth in his palm.
Draco turns down the corridor when he hears a noise, ever so slight, a scuffle of robes brushing the floor, that anyone less alert and suspicious would have missed. He pauses and then keeps walking.
Harry shrugs. “Why not? It doesn’t have to be holding hands. Say, why don’t you come with me to Slughorn’s Christmas party? I need a date anyway.”
But what is this knowledge matter in the face of this date? Do they mean anything, if Harry were to lean in for a kiss? How do they help him then, at the pivotal moment? Those facts seem to crumble under the weight of such significance.
Hermione reluctantly watches Malfoy’s footsteps trail down the hall, take a turn, pause, then disappear entirely, as if the ink melted away into the paper. She looks up at Harry, and he returns the look with a grim smile of satisfaction.
Once in bed, Harry cannot sleep. He fears tomorrow more than anything, as it will be the first true test of his magic. The other boys are asleep, with Weasley snoring the loudest, so Harry considers it safe to take his wand out and practice.
But these questions stirr in her heart more so than in her mind, and Hermione knows well that while the mind supplies answers, the heart will only ask for more.
“I want the best for you,” Harry says quietly, almost a whisper, though it seems like it took everything in him to say it.
“I need my best friend,” Ginny says softly, looking into Harry’s green eyes, bright and flickering despite the darkness. She reaches up and tussles his dark curls, then kisses his cheek. “You’re somewhere else, aren’t you?”
Oh no. Harry knows before he hears it that Draco has stormed off, in the direction that Harry’s hiding. Snape stalks away in the opposite direction, and Harry takes advantage of this and grabs Draco by the shoulders when he passes his hiding spot, dragging them both into a nearby alcove.
“Don’t you want me?” Draco’s voice is small and wavering. A hand slides down Harry’s side and rests on his hips, a finger teasingly skimming under the hem of his pants. Harry almost shudders, biting his lip hard until he regains his focus.
The Hermione in the memory is slightly thinner, though no less curvier, in a wine red jumper that she knew Ron loved, especially from behind, which is where they are watching the memory from now.
“This?” Harry uses his other hand to slowly slide his shirt sleeve up to his elbow. Draco’s Dark Mark is nothing more than a faded tattoo on his skin.
“Well,” Ron starts, but can’t finish, though he doesn’t have a good refutation anyway, as Hermione and Ginny walk into the common room arm in arm. Harry smiles sympathetically at Ron before rising and hugging Hermione, then kissing Ginny on the cheek and whispering something in her ear that makes her laugh.
“Don’t call me that,” Harry says coldly, and Draco flinches at the tone. “I hate it. It’s a curse, not a title. You’re the only one, Draco, that doesn’t see me like some god. You see
“Is that how you greet an old friend?” the figure says, then throws his hood back, revealing Harry’s familiar face like a shock to his system, and he drops his wand, sighing.
But Pansy awakens something in him, something else, something different. They all know it. So they like to play this game, where Pansy watches them. Harry can barely stand it, having no patience. He must sit there and take whatever Draco is willing to give. His body strains, his hips lift up, yearning, but Draco pulls back, waiting for Harry to breathe, and settle back down. If Harry’s hand strays too far and too close, Draco will move it away, or take his wrists and hold them at his sides.
He looks up through his lashes at Draco, his smile dangerous and dark, and Draco’s breath catches at how beautiful Harry is, his dark curls spilling over his eyes, that smooth tan skin a sea of intimacy, and those lean muscles visibly shifting underneath where his loose long sleeve clings to his arms.
When he pulls away, there’s a veil masking the usual sharpness in Draco’s eyes, and Harry can sense his distance, his strong hold, built like a wall around his heart. Even his body feels cold now, where a moment ago it was burning.
“Harry, promise me. Promise me if everything goes to hell you won’t go there too. Promise me you’ll find me first and you’ll lean on me for as long as you need.” She looks into his eyes urgently, and he averts his gaze. “Promise me.” Her voice shakes.
He should not have agreed to this. Even at night, the early September heat lingered in the dungeon. The close walls of the closet seemed to suffocate him further, even though he couldn't see. His breath came out short and his skin felt hot. If they didn't send someone in soon, Draco decided he would leave.
She understands now, though her brain has ceased to function. Ron and Pansy find her seated on a couch a few minutes later, silent and staring off into space.
“Friends?” Ron echoes. He scratches his red hair. “I find that hard to believe, but then again, Harry had a lot of secrets.”
In fact, Ron must be at St. Mungo’s now. Hermione mentally reminds herself to send a quick note over after the meeting.
“Ron,” Harry says gently, though his smile has a sharp edge to it. “Do you really think I’d be good for Ginny? Or do you just not trust anyone else with her?”
The closet crashed and burned around him. His lungs had stopped working a long time ago. Then his name, spoken low and calm.
“Yes,” Harry says, “I remember.” He remembers the cold wind on the Astronomy Tower that night, the same cold wind he feels on his face in the dreams where he falls over the edge.
“Want a drink?” Seamus asked to no one in particular. “Some drinks over here, please!” He shouted to the bartender without waiting for replies.
“My choice?” Draco echoes in disbelief. His lips quiver in anger and his hands tremble at his sides. “Well, if it’s
“Are you not helping?” Pansy asks with a tense drawl, motioning to the food ready to be placed on the table.
It has been three months since Harry moved into Draco’s apartment, and just shy of two since Pansy arrived at his doorstep and complicated things to such an extent that Draco can scarcely see a way out of it.
“I do not have a single class on Monday!” Harry exclaims, dropping his smile when Miss Granger looks at him sharply. “Naturally, I will use this time to study.”
Pansy’s very good at seeing the bottom, and for good reason; the only thing worse than a broken heart is broken trust. Her solution? Never trust anyone.
A few moments of struggling out of sweaty Quidditch gear and falling on the floor panting, kissing hungrily, hands fumbling against skin, and Ginny arcs against the hardwood floor, gasping, eyes flying open and then shutting tightly again and Harry kisses the crook of her neck, breath stuttering as they become still once more.
“I guess I wouldn’t mind a few shots. Feels like I’ve been working non stop what with that bloody potion you have me making,” Draco says, then narrows his eyes. “Has this been your move all along? To get me so exhausted that I go to a bar and you corner me there?”
“Hear me out.” Ginny takes a deep breath, looking directly into Harry’s eyes, the exact color of the Quidditch pitch on a bright summer day. “I’m not in love with you, Harry. But if you gave yourself to me, I would too. I would give you my heart if you ever asked, if you ever needed me to.”
But some nights Draco does dream, and for a moment he glimpses this other world, and he wonders which one he would really prefer. What would Harry be like if he was the Boy Who Lived and never knew it?
Hermione replies with something he can’t make out, but Pansy tenses just slightly, before relaxing. She’s nodding, and holding out her hand, as if to comfort Hermione. How odd the world has become in such a short time.
Hermione nods energetically, her mind naturally filtering through the necessary next steps to coordinate the raid. She draws up her calendar and list in the air with her wand and jots a note.
Hermione stares at the fire, mesmerized by it the way only flickering orange flames can hypnotize the human mind. She should be studying, but recently she’s lost some motivation. Part of her just can’t stop wondering what Ron is up to.
His mind flicked through a million guesses and thoughts and questions before settling on a blank. There was no way to know who it was until after. Should he speak? Ask their name? And if they didn't answer?
Harry grips Draco’s waist, his thumbs skimming over his sharp hip bones. Draco hums into his mouth, and drapes forward, kissing him deeper, wider, opening up to Harry like a flower facing the sun. Harry takes all of it, he pulls Draco closer, wishing them to be pressed together, against each other, flush and hot and—and he doesn’t know what else, has not envisioned it yet.
Draco smiles, because he cannot speak. Soon Harry drifts to sleep, his brows furrowing as if troubled by something, but his breath levels out, his chest rising and falling like the waves in the ocean, rocking Draco to sleep.
“And he’s already forcing you to choose now, isn’t he?” Pansy asks, and her eyes are full of pity. Draco looks down, hating that she's right, and knowing it doesn't change a damn thing. “I really wish you would stay away from him.”
“You won’t need to.” Draco takes Harry’s arms and pulls him up, and they scoot back until Draco falls onto his back, dragging Harry down on top of him until they are kissing again, building a rhythm like a repeated name, like casting a spell over and over and over again.
“Please don’t follow me, Harry.” Then he’s gone, disappearing through the corridor. Harry watches him go with a sinking feeling in his stomach.
The curses fly back and forth, and the bathroom rapidly tears to pieces under the brunt force of malice. Harry’s hands shake with how much rage trembles in his breast, but his mind hones in steady on the harsh breath of someone else.
Miss Lovegood does not seem to notice his tone. “Yes, I was. I did not think you needed any more schooling. I was under the impression you wished to be an auror, and would likely apply right away. Forgive me my presumption, Mr Potter. I suppose even Saviors must learn Herbology after all.”
“It is,” Hermione says with a pleased smile. She gives a little flourished turn, posing at the end as if she were in a photoshoot for Witch Weekly, which incidentally, Pansy had asked Hermione to model for in their next edition, seeing as she was a war hero and very beautiful—Pansy’s words, not hers.
She kicks up her feet onto the table as she leans back in her chair, and it all hits her in one fell swoop, this realization, Luna’s smile, her pulse a distant soundtrack to the scene unfolding at hand. Girls…
“I always thought I would teach here, you know,” Harry says, almost wistfully, skillfully avoiding Draco’s question, as if he never asked it at all. “Some day.”
Pansy Parkinson approaches them from a circle of Slytherins standing in the middle of the room. She hugs Hermione, and they share a mischievous look which goes unnoticed by the two boys.
Harry continues to stare into the flames. Hermione looks worriedly between Harry and Ginny. Ron just looks confused.
Harry and Malfoy seem to be the only couple not quite joining in on the festivities, alternating turns drinking from the bottle, looking around the room, barely exchanging words, though this is mostly Harry’s fault with his short replies.
This makes Ginny wince, and she reluctantly sits down in the love seat beside them. She’s reminded of her horrible experience in first year with Tom Riddle’s diary. She remembers Harry dying from the Basilisk fang, and the way he looked at her as he told her to save herself.
Hermione laughs, unexpectedly. She covers her mouth quickly, then nods, trying to compose herself. “Right, naturally.”
Only then did Draco have the strength to get up and walk out, his hands reaching up to untie the blindfold.
After a few rounds, Harry knew he was pissed. The edges of his vision blurred and if he turned too fast the world spun. Draco didn’t seem to be faring much better. His cheeks were flushed pink and every once in a while he would adjust the scarf around his neck.
It’s almost a test, and it infuriates Draco in a way he hasn’t been in a long time. He watches Harry slowly walk to the front desk, resting his hands—
Hermione laughs unexpectedly, a smile spreading across her face partly because of his compliment, but mostly because this is the first time Draco has called her by her first name.
He sees Hermione laughing with Blaise. She notices Harry’s arrival and sees his hand linked with Malfoy’s, so Harry quickly untangles them, careful not to trigger a refill. Ron is currently watching Pansy chug the entire bottle, his mouth falling open, as a small crowd forms to watch and cheer her on. When she lowers the bottle to catch her breath, Ron unexpectedly tugs at their wrist tie.
Hermione sighs, though not without a certain fondness that always accompanies any criticism of Harry. He’s just being Harry, after all.
“I want to see you,” Harry whispers, threading his fingers through Draco’s hair, which is already very disheveled. Draco’s reddened lips lift into a smile.
“It’s Harry,” Harry interrupts, then slides off the stool. “And I have to go.” He ignores the man’s protests and makes his way around the bar until he’s standing in front of Draco and the buff man, who is about to buy Draco a drink.
He thinks about his wand and attempting any magic with it. The very thought makes his throat tighten uncomfortably, and the back of his neck prickles. What will everyone say when they discover his utter inept after defeating the greatest sorcerer in the world? He will surely fall into disgrace; not being able to do magic is nearly as great an evil as using magic for true evil. Harry’s face burns under Miss Granger’s knowing scrutiny.
Hermione shakes her head, sighing. It’s too early to voice the very tentative theory she has begun forming. Not without concrete evidence. “Maybe.”
Madame Pomfrey said the scars will be there forever. She could try to remove them...but Draco refused. He didn’t want them to just disappear, for the only mark Harry visibly left on him to fade away so easily. Besides, they weren’t large, gnarly gashes across his chest and stomach. Just faint silvery lines, so faint on his pale skin you had to squint to see them.
Harry stares at Hermione, slipping back into thought. He says finally, in a low voice, “I do love her, but it would never be enough. It is not the love she needs or deserves. We parted ways on a mutual understanding.”
Harry rolls his eyes, pressing his lips together in a line, a flash of rebellion in his eyes. He does this occasionally, a movement of discomfort or annoyance, before smiling and shrugging it off. Ron never really understood this small moment of unguarded emotion. Is it how Harry really feels about the whole conversation? Or just a passing feeling?
Draco rolls his eyes with a fond smile. “I was going to say sexy but go ahead and spoil the mood.” He wraps the blanket around himself tighter. “It is rather cold, though.”
“How do you feel?” Draco asks. For a second he regrets asking, but Draco also knows he’s the only person that will listen. Harry stays silent for so long that Draco thinks he won’t respond.
“And what do you suggest I do?” Draco exclaims, exasperated. “If you were in my place, what would you do? If you’re so clever, what do I tell Harry?”
“I was thinking more along the lines of thanking him,” Hermione says with that indignance that Pansy has always admired from afar. “Do you have any suggestions?”
Harry puts out the cigarette and walks back inside the kitchen. He opens the cabinet above the sink, removing the strong glamour he had placed on it long ago, and grabbing a small vial of The Sad Nightingale he has had since the war.
“But he’s not reading the book. He’s reading the annotations,” he hears Hermione say to Ron in the background. “On that note, have
Dumbledore has been absent from his life—physically, that is—for the last several weeks or so. Harry wonders what he’s been up to. Secret missions? Order of the Phoenix meetings? He supposes he'll find out soon enough.
“We need to know the layout of the manors before we raid,” Shacklebolt says in his deep, soothing voice, clearly trying to pacify the situation. He looks keenly between Harry and Malfoy. “Malfoy understands the nature of these manors, having grown up in one and having regularly visited many others.”
Clearly Hermione’s true feelings of disdain and disgust have shown themselves when he started dating Lavender. Ron never stood a chance, and the realization of this hurt his pride more than he likes to admit.
She knows Draco is touching Harry when he groans beneath her, the sound vibrating like rapid fire through her body. In this moment they are connected by the same thread, the same pulse, and Pansy wishes it could last an eternity, that she could feel Harry’s insistent tongue pressing against her, his mouth teasing her open, while his body unravels completely beneath her, right beside the love of her life.
“I do not pretend the end of the war has erased such differences, and nor should you. Instead, use these differences as a reason,
“I gathered that, but where? I always wondered where someone like Dumbledore would live,” Draco says, and Harry tenses ever so slightly, a movement Draco narrows his eyes at.
“Maybe I should have been,” Harry says under his breath. Dumbledore tilts his head, and Harry knows this probing look well. He turns his back on Dumbledore so he doesn’t see Harry’s face. Part of him yearns to reveal the dark, teeming thoughts that plague his dreams at night, while the other, stronger side of himself desperately wants to lock everything up inside.
“And you’re just as clueless.” Pansy kisses him on the cheek, then returns to her catlike pose on the couch, looking as effortless as ever. “Boys like Potter don’t usually take no as an answer, Draco. And that’s what you told him.”
Harry has found that Eighth Year parties are more amusing than Gryffindor parties, but for that very same reason, the stakes are higher.
“Okay, I’ll try out next year,” Dean says easily. That’s the thing Ginny has found with Dean; everything is always easy. It’s part of what annoys her, which only makes her more annoyed for being annoyed about that. She should want someone easy, someone uncomplicated and adoring.
Draco nearly opens his mouth to say just this when Harry goes tense all over, and brings a finger up to his lips, before slowly sitting up, alert. He slips his hand over the side of the bed, grabbing his Cloak. It must had fallen to the ground during the night.
Harry helps. He usually wakes to Harry curled behind him, half hard and adorably sleepy, gently caressing Draco’s arm until he’s nearly wide awake and painfully aroused. After they mess around in bed, Harry must shower and dress hurriedly, as he can never refuse helping Weasley and the Aurors with some special operation or Granger and the Ministry with the reforms.
He sits up, stretches, scrubs his face, and then freezes. Memories of the night before, which had melted with his dreams, rise up in front of his mind in a tequila tainted blur. Harry kissing him like his life depended on him. Harry saying that everything is different now.
“On the contrary,” Draco says tersely, “you’ll find that for people with nothing left to lose, secrets don’t mean a thing.”
“Perhaps you still hold a grudge?” Hermione counters, and Pansy feels a rush of exhilaration that washes out the hurt pride. She has missed the innocent rivalry from her school days, when everything was Slytherin against Gryffindor. Draco puts up a good fight, but ever since Harry’s reappeared in the picture he’s gone soft.
Draco whispers, his voice choking. Harry goes still, his eyes wide for a moment, filled with surprise, before relaxing into a slack expression. Draco wills Harry to move to the door, every second filling his lungs with pain like a thousand sharp needles. Harry takes a reluctant step backwards, then halts. A vein in Harry’s forehead pulses. Draco realizes with a sick feeling of horror that he’s fighting the curse.
Harry had been gambling with Draco, taking a shot in the dark and hoping it would land. He had gone crazy, since the moment he saw Draco at the charity ball, his pale face and grey eyes scanning the room and finding his like two magnets. Couldn’t keep away, like a moth drawn to the flame.
Draco’s voice breaks through, a low growl, “...to break it, then, because I don’t need your protection! It’s my job...I’ve got a plan... a bit longer…”
It’s more than Harry could have hoped, had dared to dream. He burns from the inside out as Draco groans his name when Harry’s hands slide firmly down his sides, gripping him from behind. While never taking his mouth away from Draco’s, Harry walks Draco backwards until his legs hit the counter top, and Draco buckles in Harry’s arms, and Harry has to hoist him up almost limp onto the edge.
“But Mr Potter,” Longbottom says, “you defeated the most powerful sorcerer in the world! The auror program will not spare a second glance at a poor mark once they see your name.”
Draco fists the bedsheets in his hands, pressing his head back into the mattress, shutting his eyes tightly. He feels a fingertip grazing his opening, then pushing inside, and his legs tremble with the mixture of pleasure and pain. Harry takes more of him in his mouth, while he fucks Draco with his finger, and then another.
Harry releases his wrists. They fall against each other with short starts of movement, an arm sliding forward, a leg scooting over, while their mouths find each other carefully, slowly, searchingly. Their mouths make very subtle sounds which cause Harry’s whole body to squirm. His eyes have clouded over, but then he realizes it’s just his glasses. He pulls away, averting his eyes, and takes his glasses off. Draco’s hand is still lingering at his waist.
He props up the Marauders Map in his hands, though he doesn’t know what he expects to find, or what he’s looking for. Except, that’s not exactly true.
Harry nods, a stiff jerk of the head. “I think I knew. I think I knew from the moment I saw the Vanishing Cabinet. But I didn’t want to believe it, that he could do something like that. He told me the day I used the
A name calls out to him, but it is far away, underwater, and he doesn’t recognize it. And it doesn’t matter. Somewhere else awaits him.
"Hey," Draco said, but it came out soft and low. He couldn't manage a smile to ease away the awkwardness. Harry patted Draco’s arm, who felt startled at such a casual gesture and then annoyed to see Harry leaving, which only annoyed him more.
Hermione bows her head to hide a satisfied smile. “Of course. I’ll see you tomorrow.” She doesn’t move until the door opens and shuts closed. Then Hermione springs up, her mind revving like a machine, an engine, the wheels and cogs turning and fitting together rapidly, parsing and collecting together all the memories she has of Harry interacting with Draco.
Mrs Malfoy looks startled and ashamed. It does not fit her aristocratic features, and Harry’s stomach twists uncomfortably. He regrets his comment, though he meant every word.
“Tom Riddle was an orphan. Like me,” Harry says, looking at Ginny. His voice is cold, and Ginny suppresses a shiver. “Dumbledore took him under his wing.” He sounds sarcastic and bitter. This angers Ginny more than anything.
“I just want you to be careful,” she says sadly, knowing then that he will not confide in her with this.
When the castle finally looms into view, many gasp. To the horror of Harry and many others, they realize that Gryffindor tower is only a pile of rubbish and debris on the ground that has been half-heartedly swept into a large mound. Beside her Miss Granger bites back a sob.
Draco lifts the covers from his bed, though if he had the choice, he’d rather stay within their warmth tonight.
"I'm gonna go check on something. Catch you later." Then Harry walked away, his hand accidentally brushing Draco's arm as he disappeared around the corner.
Harry's hands were everywhere at once, a blur of motion and warm caresses, while his lips moved leisurely like they had all the time in the world.
Harry sits up and hovers over Ginny, pressing his lips on hers ever so gently, before kissing a path down her neck, between her breasts, right above her hips bones, and with his hands he spreads her legs apart.
“Maybe,” Ron begins, then stops. “If Harry’s there…” He trails off again, and looks hopelessly at Hermione. Ginny looks at Hermione too, a sense of defiance washing over her like armor.
“Remind me again what classes you are taking besides the mandatory ones,” Weasley says to Miss Granger as the three of them walk down Diagon Alley.
Pansy shakes her head, then hesitates. “Yes, but not like I love you. I love both of you. I need both of you. But I also know it’s not love, not really, that it’s something else.” She sighs. “It’s complicated.”
Some things, though, have undeniably changed. They are no longer the young hopeful sixteen year old boys they once were, dreaming of an impossible love story, and instead finding only a brutal, bloody war to greet them.
That is the truth of it. She is lost. Abandoned. Even Harry and Draco have lost her. She has been cast away by life, by her family, by her friends. She has nowhere to go.
The pale light of the moon shines on Draco, and Harry can see that he’s fully dressed in dark formal robes, like he just came from a dinner party. Draco walks to the railings at the edge of the platform, looking over the side at the sheer drop to the grass below.
Blaise raises an eyebrow. “No. I definitely heard you talking to someone. I thought it sounded like—but it doesn’t matter.” He turns around, his black robes unfurling behind him. “Hurry up and get ready. I’m hungry.”
Harry recalls Hogwarts like a dream of another life, hazy and slow like an old Wizard photograph, the picture clouded with wear and exposure, the movement sluggish as if underwater. He remembers even before Hogwarts was his school, when it was his home first. Dumbledore had decided he was old enough to leave that cottage deep in the woods, the safehouse that always felt like a prison, that Hogwarts would be safe enough from then on. Harry has only vague memories of that time wandering the castle alone at night, sneaking into the kitchens where Lucy would give him a cup of steaming hot chocolate, climbing his way up to the Astronomy Tower to look out over the vast lake glimmering under the moonlight, cupped in the palm of the greenest valley he had ever seen.
“Hermione,” Harry says, cutting her off, and the seriousness in his eyes washes away all doubts. “I really can’t tell you.”
The feeling passes with Draco’s fingers on his hips, tracing circles. Harry’s body surges, lapping on the shore of Draco’s skin. He buries his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, planting feverish kisses in the places where his skin hollows.
Draco lowers his eyes, frowning. Then a small smile curves on his delicate pink mouth, and it takes all of Harry’s self restraint not to kiss him right then and there. “It can be a secret.”
“We’re not angry with you,” Ron adds gently. “It’s just, sometimes, you come off a bit insensitive. You’re hard to read, and right now, it looks like you could care less how Ginny’s feeling. And as her brother, I can’t let that slide. You guys don’t need to be what you were, but the least you could do is check in with her.”
“Not exactly.” Harry sighs, scratching at his chin. “I kept trying to figure it out. He never wanted to tell me, which I didn't understand until later. But one day I caught him going into the Room of Requirement. He showed me the Vanishing Cabinet and told me he was trying to fix it.”
“You are as ignorant as ever,” Draco says angrily. “I shouldn’t even be here. I shouldn’t do this at all, let alone for you, of all people. But I’m doing it because I know how—nevermind.” Draco turns to hide the hot flush creeping up his cheeks. He sets the briefcase he brought on the counter top, made of black leather with silver clasps.
Blaise shrugs. “For the most part, not at all.” He smiles deviously, and with a flat hand glides up and down the curve of Pansy’s bare hip. “I find women the more sensual sex.”
“Is it someone I know?” Hermione asks, but when Draco’s eyes widen in alarm, adds quickly, “But you don’t have to tell me, of course.” Though it's too late; Hermione has already started combing through a list of people they both know. She comes up with nothing, and now is burning to know who.
Ginny, nothing, without him. I would rather be dead than be without him, and I’m not just saying that because I am heartbroken or because I want you to feel bad for me. No, it’s something that I know and have known for a long time now and tried to ignore it but I can’t anymore. So no, you really don’t understand.”
“One more, Mr Weasley? Oh no, I am afraid that ten is very much my limit,” she says, much to Weasley's exasperation and Harry's amusement.
” She leaves her cigarette in the ash tray, then walks back into the house. Before she crosses the threshold, she looks back at him. “Be well, Harry.”
“We realized it was Draco,” Ron interjects, “but it was hard to imagine at first. I always thought you two hated each other. I mean, you were constantly trying to rat him out, so it made no sense.”
“No,” Hermione says distractedly, remembering the memory of them fighting in Professor Slughorn’s class, “they didn’t…”
A few months ago, Pansy moved in, which was also when Harry and Draco made their relationship official. Hermione and Ron are skeptical of the whole affair, especially the suspicious arrival of Pansy on the scene, and perhaps more secretly, of the sexuality of everyone involved.
Hermione leans sadly against Ron’s shoulder, her eyes rimmed red. There are thousands of witches and wizards from all over the world gathered on the shore of the lake, all in somber black cloaks and with grim faces.
Harry leads them up the stairs to his bedroom, not bothering to shut the door, simply lifting a slightly tipsy Draco onto the bed and kissing him messily, one hand on his thigh and the other haphazardly unbuttoning his shirt.
After the war ended, the world seemed to slow down. No one wanted to get anything done anymore. The Ministry put a lot of people in Azkaban, but that was it. The reforms would come later, they said. Five years have passed since then, and the world has not moved. Days come and go like waves lapping the shore. Everyone complains, but no one tries to change it.
“Why?” Harry asks, clearly irritated. “Just the other night you got upset that I didn’t want to tell anyone about us, and now that I want to, you get mad?”
“He’s out there. I can feel it. And he’s angry. I can feel it in my bones. Sometimes I swear...he’s inside me, like a snake, right under my skin, so close I can see the scales.”
“Anywhere else you can sleep?” Harry asks, trying not to pay too much attention to how Draco’s body pressed against his sends an icy shot of flames through his veins.
Harry laughs. “So not the rich and arrogant bully that falls for the devilishly handsome Chosen One?”
“Yes, come here Harry. I have something to show you,” Dumbledore says, and when Harry walks further inside sees that Dumbledore is hunched over the Pensieve.
Harry’s hand drops from Ginny’s. “Did you ever wonder how we never had to choose? I was always on the right side, the good side. Dumbledore’s side, whatever that means. And your parents already fought against Voldemort in the Great War. It was easy.”
Ron and Hermione start to protest that Harry can't possibly tell Dumbledore a bunch of nonsense when Harry’s face goes very still and very pale, and he looks at Ginny with a deadly silence.
“My task is to kill Dumbledore,” Draco says flatly, and even though Harry knew it was coming, had known in the darkest part of himself for a while now, it still hits him like a punch to the gut, almost hard enough for him to keel over. “Now, are you going to stop me? Or help me?”
“Merlin, Hermione,” Harry mutters, his voice suggesting that he’s not really there, something not unusual recently. Whenever Ron or Hermione try to talk with him, he shuts the conversation down with a cold efficiency that has scared Ron, at least, from ever trying again.
Ron rolls his eyes. “Course not. The Ministry asked him to work in the first place, and he didn’t even want to! That should be proof enough.” Then he half smiles, lowering his voice. “Now don’t tell Harry this, but the reason we know for sure that Malfoy’s not up to something is because
Pansy took a liking to Neville. They kissed by the end of the night, Pansy with her catlike smile, Neville speechless, his cheeks red as roses. Harry and Dean discovered that Draco had purchased a Muggle video game, but did not know how to operate it, so they invited him over the very next day to teach him, always desperate for more players.
Ginny rolls her eyes, but swings her legs down, feet planting on the floor. Luna smiles pleasantly after Madam Pince as if she had greeted them with a good morning instead of a stern reprimand.
The rest of the memory unfolds around them, the living room of Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s new home after the war and Fred’s death, the fire roaring to life across the room, and then the partygoers, memory Ron and Harry chatting against the far wall in the corner, Molly and Arthur sitting on the couch playing with Bill and Fleur’s children, the rest of the Weasley brothers scattered around the house, chatting with other notable guests like Shacklebolt, Aberforth, Padma Patil, Cho Chang, Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan. And many others, laughing until their cheeks go red and drinking red wine until they start dancing to Celestina Warbeck, bring warmth and vibrance and noise to the memory all at once.
His eyes catch onto another name, a name as familiar to him as his own, walking down the Third Floor corridor to the Room of Requirement. Without a second thought, Harry scrambles off the couch and runs out of the common room, ignoring the Fat Lady’s yelp of protest.
Suddenly Ginny stands up. “I believe you, Harry.” Harry looks up at her in surprise, then suspicion. “But if you have proof, you should tell Dumbledore immediately.”
“Maybe Ron is right,” Harry says, and when Ginny starts to speak, he continues quickly. “Not about that, exactly.” He pauses, deep in thought. “You deserve to love someone who will want to be there for you in ways I can’t. Maybe we shouldn’t...maybe we should stop.” He looks at her with a face clear of tension, perfectly relaxed, maybe even too relaxed, Ginny thinks.
Words have become impossible. Harry cannot think, only feel. He feels Draco’s chest rise and fall beneath his own, radiating warmth. A slight jerk of his shoulders, his eyelashes fluttering, the swallow in his throat, they all jump out at him at once, overwhelming his senses.
He has a reason to be here, but he doesn’t know it yet. He is older, that he does know. Everything goes calmer, stiller, like a Muggle photograph. Harry walks over to the edge and suddenly he remembers.
A moment later, the door unlocked silently, opening a sliver. Harry pushed it carefully, walking inside. Draco was sitting up in bed, his chest bare. The
“I must wonder,” Miss Granger says in an attempt at changing subjects, “how this school year will turn out, given the circumstances.”
“We think that he’s becoming obsessed with Malfoy again. He came over when we were having dinner with him, and didn’t take it well. Said the poor bloke is trying to take over the Ministry from the inside,” Ron says, shaking his head. Ginny almost starts, but keeps her body and features still and casual.
Draco loves Pansy, they share something untouchable, immovable, deeper than the blood that runs in their veins, and yet, she is not Harry. Draco worships Harry. Harry is his lifeline, his heartbeat, his sun that rises each morning. Without him, Draco would be left in utter darkness.
To anyone else this moment would feel random, maybe even unsentimental, but to Draco it feels terrifyingly right, as if every word and every kiss and every tear before this has naturally led to Harry saying these three words in the dead of night.
“Play nice, Ron,” Hermione says as she walks away with a smirk to where Zabini lounges in a dark green loveseat, a bottle of champagne hanging carelessly from his fingertips.
“It’s Draco, I know it,” Harry says, that dangerous gleam in his eyes as he sits forward, almost conspiratorially.
“To end his life?” Hermione finishes gravely. She meets his eyes, and they are sad and heavy. “I don’t know, Ron.” They sit in silence for a moment longer before Hermione’s head jerks up. “Wait, did you say he talked about finding another world?”
Harry is walking up the stairs. It’s dark, but the moon casts everything in an eerie glow. His steps are silent as they continue up the endless staircase, up and up and up, an indefinite amount of time that feels like infinity but also just a second. He wonders where he is going, even though he already knows, like a premonition.
“Obviously,” Draco replies, his voice dripping with disdain, and Harry almost smiles. “But why? Come to turn me in?”
“It’s complicated.” His face has arranged itself in that careful indifference, but Ginny can see a glimmer of something past it, some dark and twisted turmoil he rarely reveals to others.
“I’m a former Death Eater, you know,” Draco says quietly, trying to control the slight tremor in his voice. Merlin, he needs to leave. A minute longer with Harry and he won’t be able to keep himself together.
Draco’s eyes have filled with tears by the time she stops speaking. He does not want to let her go, but he knows he will have to. He nods. Pansy moves towards him, and he catches her face in his hand, and kisses her softly. She deepens the kiss hungrily, wanting more from him than he can give her. Draco allows her to kiss him like this, even though it won’t go anywhere, it can’t go anywhere. Then he feels her take off her robe.
Draco stares at her, and can’t think of a word to say. Then the doorbell rings, and Pansy looks at the front door, then sharply at Draco.
Ron rocks Rose to sleep, her face puckered with exhaustion, and her little mouth opening wide in an adorable yawn. Hermione walks in, hands in the pockets of her sweatpants which they both immediately changed into after coming back from the party.
“It wasn’t a choice for me,” Draco says in a low voice, trying to keep the bubbling anger and fear from all those years ago from rising up in his throat. He swallows, suddenly self conscious. “He forced me to choose, when I didn’t want to.”
He pauses, and Hermione sees Molly with tears down her face, and Ginny discreetly wiping at her cheeks. Everyone has their eyes on Harry, even Draco.
Draco appears on an apartment doorstep, a blue ward shimmering in front of the door, one hand gripping his briefcase and the other on his wand, just in case. The apartment complex seems modern and yet not overly ornate, the architecture and style subtle in its elegance, a sign of more wealth, not less; somehow Draco expected Harry to be living elsewhere.
Everyone sits down in a clamor of benches scraping and suddenly the students can no longer hold back, and conversation breaks out loudly among the tables. Mostly people whisper about the High Table and the notable additions to the professors, such as Mr Ollivander and the Minister, as well as Mr and Mrs Bill Weasley. It takes a few moments for the uproar in the Great Hall to quiet down. At the podium Professor McGonagall looks sternly down her nose at the students until gradually silence descends.
Then Draco came back into his life, a willing miracle that lasted as brief as it did ten years before. A scar on his heart that never truly heals because he keeps ripping it back open again.
“We were talking about him settling down and having kids. He said something weird, though. Got me worried.”
He thought with a damning certainty like a noose around his neck that he would rather have Harry any way he possibly could than not have him at all.
“Lastly, since many of you have completed much of the Hogwarts curriculum, I find it unnecessary to reteach topics that have already been learned. That is partly why I allowed most classes to be optional, and why many classes will be taught by guests very much esteemed in their respective fields. It is time to narrow your focus and choose an area of work that you would like to pursue after graduating. The smaller class sizes will allow you to form meaningful connections with your professors, which can prove useful later on as an apprenticeship or letter of recommendation for higher education. Use your time wisely.
Hermione’s jaw sets stubbornly. “In fact, Parkinson, I was. When I asked someone for you they sent a witch named Daisy, apparently your secretary. She was quite anxious to call for you. I must say, I hadn’t expected to wait.”
“No!” Draco exclaims, throwing his hands around Harry’s neck, as if that could somehow stop him. “Pansy will be sleeping. I can’t wake her, I promised.”
Harry takes another long sip of his wine. Draco watches him, then looks away, a flush rising on his neck, which startles Harry even more. Suddenly the room grows hotter, and Harry looks everywhere except at Draco.
“I just said things were different now because of my public persona. Imagine what people would say if they knew I secretly dated a Death Eater.”
“So,” Hermione says, smirking, “you’re into those one night stands? I admit they are much less messy than relationships, trust me.” She thinks of Rose spitting up on her bib, and sighs fondly at her double entendre, however silly.
Ron stares at Hermione, slightly terrified. She doesn’t blame him. Here she is, nearly ten o’clock when they both have early starts tomorrow morning, barely dressed, holding up a vial of a memory she tucked away in her cabinets long ago.
Harry looked up, his throat straining, making a choking noise, his green eyes bright and lost, looking at Draco but not seeing him, slipping over the edge, crying out as he came, continuing to thrust into her until she spasmed around him, and fell very still.
Hermione sits down next to a Hermione ten years younger. It’s disconcerting to see how much she has aged. How much has changed, since her days at Hogwarts.
“Please, Harry,” Draco whispers, hoarse. He turns his body, face down on the bed. He looks at Harry looking at him, taking in his pale skin, his long limbs, open, wanting, and Draco flushes, seeing himself through Harry’s eyes.
When she steps out, Hermione Granger is on the other side, ready to walk into the elevator. She halts when she notices Pansy, who raises an eyebrow, and steps outside. Hermione crosses her arms, almost a foot and a half shorter than her and with that same curvy figure as in school.
Red. Orange. A candle chandelier, right above him. Velvet curtains. Pictures, so many pictures, Harry could not see the wallpaper. He saw his dad in some, but mostly they were of Quidditch teams and motorcycles and half-naked girls cut out of both Wizard and Muggle magazines.
“What do you want?” Draco asks, lifting his chin up defiantly. Harry can’t help but stare at him. He likes to look at Malfoy. His paleness astounds Harry. Pale eyebrows, pale eyelashes, pale lips, pale skin. In the cold moonlight, he almost glows, like a statue sculpted from marble.
“I don’t know. I was never in that position,” Pansy lies through gritted teeth. She thinks of Blaise, beautiful, handsome Blaise with his straight teethed smile, those warm, strong hands, gentle against her skin, and his voice, the voice she hears in every dream and every fantasy.
“I need something to hold on to,” Harry says, finally. His mouth is grim. “I just need us together, until I can—until—”
“No.” Harry stares at the seat where Draco was sitting moments before, the unfinished plate of blueberry pie the only reminder that he was even there. He hears the swoosh of the Floo, and then Hermione storms inside.
“Harry?” Luna asks, finding him a moment later in the alcove, leaning against his back and looking at the floor, troubled. “Why are you here all alone? The party is so sparkly right now.”
“That’s what got me so confused,” Hermione continues animatedly, her mind whirring a minute faster than the words could come out of her mouth. “He did say that he could never
Draco lets himself smile, at least for today. She doesn’t know for sure, and Hermione’s too nice and too thorough to ask such a dangerous question without being positive that her theory is correct.
Harry looks down at his letter again, ignoring their stares. He was accepted into Herbology, Charms, and Care of Magical Creatures. He was not accepted by Potions, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Government, all of which are needed to become an auror. At the bottom of his letter is a statement from the Headmistress. It reads:
“You’re just paranoid,” Draco dismisses, but he sounds a little less confident and a lot more desperate for it to be true. Pansy knows the feeling well, so she tries to sympathize.
“Ginny,” he says brokenly, and he leans in, needing, falling apart, the shards of a love story that was never meant to last.
But he was wrong. Draco liked him, and asked him to come over tonight, alone. He knows Draco well, from their growing friendship over the last few years, but now he doubts whether he knows Draco at all. For what does he really know about him?
“I don’t know,” Draco says, glad to have the spotlight on someone else. “I suppose she always has some fling going on, though she’s never serious about them; she has always been quite reserved about those types of things.”
Harry and Weasley blush as they hastily retrieve their schedules that were quickly placed in their pockets at dinner only to forget they were there. With a quill, they mark their classes, then lean closer together to compare.
“These goddamn buttons,” Harry whispers, and Draco laughs, the sound echoing against the stone walls. With a smile Harry’s fingers start on the topmost button, resting in the swell above Draco’s delicate collarbone.
“I….come in...please.” Hermione sounds desperate, but from what Draco can see from his place on the couch, Pansy holds the door firmly halfway closed, with herself blocking the entry. He feels a rush of relief that his best friend knows that despite his lack of tears, he could absolutely not handle a visitor. Especially Hermione Granger.
They stay silent, then Hermione looks at Ron, who nods. “I’m gonna check on Rose real quick,” Ron mutters, then his face disappears from the flames. Hermione remains, looking anxious.
Draco hands over his mug. Then Harry bows his head, and leaves, but not before Hermione catches the edge of a smirk on his lips. She watches them share one last look that puzzles her even more, her mind slow and hazy like she’s swimming underwater.
“What do you think, Draco?” Ron asks, taking another large bit of pie, smearing blueberry on his cheek, which Hermione fondly scoffs at. When Rose begins to whine, Ron dips his pinkie into the jelly and let’s Rose gently suck it, immediately calming her. Hermione smiles, shaking her head.
“We all have light and dark within us,” Dumbledore reminds him, and Harry scowls. He hates these witty turns of phrases, even though he likes to come up with them as well. However, when directed at Harry they always come with a hint of condescension that only reminds him of how his guardian always treats him like the child he no longer is.
“Good,” Pansy says shortly. She exhales, then pats his arm and kisses his cheek. “Now, can you help me with my Potions essay? You know I’m hopeless in every subject except fashion and looking fabulous.”
Harry whispers, before pulling on his Cloak. Darkness envelopes him, and he crouches against the wall, listening.
“If Ron and Lavender are out at this hour, I wouldn’t be surprised others do too.” She blushes hotly, and hurriedly continues. “Malfoy is still a teenage boy. Honestly, I don’t understand why you are so determined to find evil where there is not.”
A fireplace roars on the opposite wall, framed by couches and armchairs, and the ceiling is vaulted with dark wood and strung with banners and lights. Other students mill about, already studying at large tables or spread out playing card games on the rug. Two staircases lead to the boys and girls dormitories, exactly as they would in the tower. Harry cannot believe it.
“And just for the record,” Harry says, “I understand your situation with Ron. I know how it feels to want someone you can’t have.”
“Oh yes,” Pansy says, carelessly, laughing at Harry’s frown. “But it’s part of your charm, I suppose.”
“You’re quite grave today, Potter,” Draco says, using his last name as an attempt to lighten the mood. They have been lazying on the couch in Harry’s living room, too exhausted after school to game or search for an interesting channel.
Suddenly Harry wrenches away, scrambling from the couch and Draco’s warm, addicting embrace. “No, no, no.”
Draco’s too busy looking at Harry to notice Hermione narrowing her eyes at Draco briefly, before continuing to argue with Ron.
“If you are so curious, why don’t I show you,” Dumbledore replies, flourishing his hand towards the Pensieve.
Perhaps this is the final hurrah, the grand finale, of a long, twisted, painful, but necessary tie that must be cut off for both of them to fully heal and move on, whether they wish to or not.
“Yes, but also abandoned, and therefore private,” Harry says, opening the heavy door and slipping through. Ginny follows with one last glance behind her.
“He said he kept falling over the Astronomy Tower, like Dumbledore did. And he also said something about finding another world, and then he mentioned death being an adventure. He sounded mental, Hermione. Mental.”
Harry bites his bottom lip. “I hope not. If it is decided by my Sixth Year marks, I’m afraid I will hardly get into much. But perhaps it is best this way.”
The dormitory is dark at this hour, a pale shine of moonlight filtering through a small window, the only illumination that saves Ginny from having to carefully cast a Lumos and risk getting caught.
He also has his date with Granger for afternoon tea today. Draco scowls at the thought. She always says something to spoil his boyfriend’s mood.
And just like that, she moves on, and Draco must too. He doesn’t understand why she brought it up only to beat around the bush. To scare him? To threaten him?
“Mr. Lovegood is an honorable man. He was only trying to protect his daughter. Honestly, I would hope you would do the same if it came to Rose.” Hermione kisses the baby’s cheek, eyeing Ron, who flushes. Ginny suddenly feels awkward, like she’s stumbled upon a marital argument in the making that she does not understand and does not want to.
“But we still have a lot of questions,” Hermione says quickly, not wanting to get off track. Harry raises a brow at her. “I remembered you told me that you were in love with someone during Sixth Year, but you dated Ginny by the end of the year, and I forgot all about it.”
Snape replies with something too soft for Harry to hear, though he’s sure Draco won’t like whatever he says.
The Headmistress purses her lips, as if the situation is as dreadful to her as to the current Gryffindor students. “Unfortunately, the condition of Gryffindor Tower prohibits its use by students. A tent has been erected on the grounds that I hope will satisfy the Gryffindor house, though I understand will never replace the Tower.”
“I guess it’s not exactly about Draco…” Hermione pauses, then looks Pansy directly in the eyes, and her dark gaze intimidates Pansy more than she’ll ever admit. “Do you know if Draco and Harry were ever...friends at Hogwarts?”
Harry rolls his neck, the joints popping. Power rolls down his back like a snake rippling tall, ready to strike. “Tell me,” he says in a low voice, so broken and deep it doesn’t sound like his, “that you will not kill him. Promise me that you will find another way.”
“Can you work on them tonight?” Hermione asks, getting up again. With a wave of her wand, the floor plans roll up and magically packages them, the Ministry ensigma flaring brightly at the center with glowing strings wrapping around it. She takes it, and the spell fades.
They had been staying at Grimmauld Place for almost a month. But tonight was their last night before infiltrating the Ministry, and Hermione and Ron had fallen asleep together downstairs. Harry did not have the heart to wake them up; this could be their last night together.
“Luna has a way of knowing what’s best for you.” Harry sounds like he knows this from personal experience. He takes a sip of his scotch, seamlessly slipping into that ruminating mood where Ginny could never pierce through, those dark green eyes—a forest of secrets—going out of focus.
Hermione glances briefly at her watch before turning around, ready to find out what’s taking him so long, when Draco pops into existence in the middle of her office, coffee mug in hand, looking like he just rolled out of bed.
“Hey,” she says, sitting down on the ground beside him. Harry looks up at her, surprised. He smiles, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “What are you doing?”
“Yes.” He doesn’t want to talk about it. Pansy looks like she might say something else, so he asks quickly, “Where is Draco?”
Mrs Malfoy smiles, but it is pained. They both know if it was not for Harry, she and Malfoy would serve time in Azkaban along with her husband. “The truth is a very valuable thing.”
A large, dark oak door materializes in front of him. He can almost hear another heart beat just a little faster, so close he thinks Harry might be right behind him.
It’s an entirely typical day. Hermione doesn’t remember why she thought this memory would be helpful. Clearly she made a mistake. As the lesson comes to a close, Hermione decides to leave, feeling defeated.
When she leaves, Harry, Weasley, and Miss Granger sit beside the fire. Weasley rings for tea, and a few moments later, they all hold steaming cups of tea on little porcelain saucers.
Blaise laughs. “And speaking of Weasleys, the youngest one, Ginevra. She’s quite something, isn’t she? Fit and sassy, the perfect combination. Gets around too, from what I’ve heard.” Pansy shoves his arm.
Instead, Harry shook his head. “Stop feeling sorry for yourself. And I guess,” Harry felt the tips of his ears burning, which only caused him to ramble, “I guess, if you want, you could still, you know, smoke.”
“I think,” Draco says slowly, looking Harry in the eyes, “that McGonagall will preserve Dumbledore’s legacy, while making her own.”
“Coming?” Draco would ask as he fixed his tie at the door. Harry says yes every time, and every time Draco sighs, dramatically waiting for Harry to reach the door of the room, before he fiddles with the front of Harry’s jumper, redoing his tie.
“I quite agree,” Longbottom says, and it takes all of Harry and Miss Weasley’s self restraint not to laugh. They share a smile, but Harry drops his when he notices Weasley looking at them hopefully.
“Why?” Weasley looks surprised, then realizes and frowns. “No, you should not believe that. Your magic will right itself in no time. It just needs a little practice, that is all. We will both be accepted, I am sure. Professor McGonagall could not do otherwise with heroes of the war.”
She stands up, smiling at him. Hermione and Ron stay silent, watching the scene unfold. Harry carefully searches her face, but she knows he won’t find anything except her smile.
a Death Eater,” Ron says, somewhat awkwardly. “Come on, mate. He made some bad choices, but it’s time to let it go.”
“Naturally,” Harry says, hoping he doesn’t sound bored or sarcastic. The man is handsome, after all, with fluffy brown hair and blue eyes, and a nondescript, pretty face. It’d be a shame to miss his shot for a night of fun just because of some stupid Muggle politics.
“Oh yeah? It sure doesn’t look like it! You look as if your head’s about to explode, and that’s putting it lightly! Could it be that time of month?”
Harry shrugs. His body feels laden down, as if he were underwater, and his skin is hot and flushed. Summer has just come to an end and the days are still unbearably humid. Draco watches him steadily, then reaches out and jostles his shoulder.
Draco’s eyes well with tears, and Harry doesn’t understand. His chest aches, as if someone is squeezing all the air out. He takes a step towards Draco.
“Yes, Ron,” Harry says, trying not to sound annoyed. After all, it is about time that they both realize what is inevitable. Ginny had always joked about them being as blind as bats. Maybe a little innocent push in the right direction won’t hurt? “You should make sure she doesn’t trip and fall in the snow, though.”
“I’d better find them. Can you tell Pansy?” She doesn’t wait for his response, heading straight for the boys’ dormitories first. She walks carefully up the stairs and down the hallway, checking every room, but to no avail. She even checks the bathrooms, but they are empty, the music from below echoing through the floor.
Draco loves to ride Harry, and it’s even better when he cannot focus, cannot move, cannot do anything except take Pansy’s cunt in his mouth and fuck her with his tongue, all while Draco has Harry inside of him, making Harry shudder and groan, his arms clutching the couch as if he were in pain.
Draco would take either, for some drama to the boring routine of Hogwarts. He hasn’t always thought Hogwarts boring. But this year, everything feels pale in the face of the dangers lurking all around in darkness. No one knows about them except Draco, of course, and it’s his burden to bear. Alone. But sometimes he wishes...
“But what did the potion do, professor,”  Harry asks earnestly, as if he had not heard that people had died from it.
“Well, if you had cared to read the rest of the letter, you would have seen that the classes offered for Eighth Years are quite...unusual. For instance, there are only three core classes, Transfigurations with Professor McGonagall, Astronomy with Firenze, and History of Magic with Professor Binns.”
“Wake up, Harry,” Draco whispers, straining his ears to make sure no one else is walking around. Harry groans loudly, then buries himself under the covers, wrapping his strong arms around Draco.
Slughorn bustles around the party goers, his nervous smile and laugh filtering between the crowds. Harry looks into his cup, the wine swirling dark and purple. Luna abandoned him to chat with Ginny, but he would rather be alone anyway. He really hates parties.
The first to host was Gryffindor, and it followed the old routine of Harry’s later years at Hogwarts, much to the fascination and disappointment of the other Houses. They could not believe Gryffindor, bold, courageous Gryffindor, would not risk more than a shaky confession of a crush.
Their argument has ripped open the wound Draco has long thought closed. But sometimes deeper scars leave their marks hidden well below the surface.
“Don’t follow me,” Draco growls over his shoulder, a few paces ahead of Harry, the small heels on his dress shoes clicking softly on the marble floor. But Harry continues anyway, steadily gaining on him, ignoring other wizards and witches that try to greet him.
It turns out that he needs much more than that. Harry stumbled into his life right when he decided he had enough of it. The Wizarding World could scarcely look at him, many openly hated him, and too often he was nearly assaulted on the streets. But Harry looked at him and spoke to him and soon enough they were inseparable, and indeed, Draco could not live without him.
Pansy feels that unfamiliar clenching in her stomach that she’s come to recognize as worry. She can see just how far Draco has fallen in such a short time, and she also knows he would rather die than hit the bottom.
“Draco,” Hermione calls out, and Draco pauses, tense. Though they have gotten on better terms, there is still a gulf of awkwardness between them, as if neither wants to offend the other.
Since that conversation, Draco noticed that Harry observed them more carefully, saw all the little things others failed to see: the way Draco touched Pansy, reverently, meaningfully, the way Pansy looked into his eyes, a faint smirk on her blood red lips, the way they spoke to each other, almost flirting, almost insulting, their minds connected on a level deeper than the water below the earth, a twin flame lit in their eyes, a pull towards each other that was almost outside of their bodies, like planets orbiting each other but never touching.
“And don’t worry about paying for these. It’s a gift. And I’m sure after Mr. Weasley sees you in them he’ll be thanking
Suddenly Malfoy looks up and they lock eyes. Harry forces himself to look away, focusing on the Headmistress’s speech.
“Draco, Draco, Draco…” Harry’s voice is more of a groan against his lips, his arms tight around Draco’s body, almost holding his entire weight up.
Soon the funeral comes to a close. The large stone slab is levitated to cover Dumbledore’s face. People begin to pay their respects and leave. Harry remains, so Ginny does too.
“Harry,” he says, his voice low in his throat and his heartbeat calm and steady from the wine. Harry looks at him, his eyes burning a bright flashing green like the Floo’s fire.
Draco sighs, adjusting his tie in the mirror, a dusky silver the same color as his eyes at night. “What about this do you not understand, Pansy?”
Ron shakes his head. “No, not really. I always had the sense your heart was elsewhere.” When Harry tries to interrupt, Ron continues, “I know you love her. But you weren’t
It’s a large volume carefully bound in red velvet, with gold stamped lettering. Draco gingerly opens it, scanning the table of contents.
“I would never have asked for anything you didn’t want to give,” Harry counters. Ginny throws her hands up, scoffing. She wants to grab Harry’s shoulders and shake them until he really looks at her.
. Please send a reply signed by all eligible Eighth Year students under your care to indicate their understanding and acceptance of said terms. Sincerely, Minister Shacklebolt.’”
When it is clear a conversation will not take place, much less a duel, Mrs Malfoy and her son pay for the robes and quickly depart the shop. Harry watches them leave with an odd feeling in his chest that he cannot define, like missing a step on the stairs and for half a second being suspended in midair.
Hermione looks surprised but nods, returning to the dressing room. Pansy can barely stand the wait, and she reprimands herself for getting invested. She impatiently examines her nails—a dark green for obvious reasons—though her heart’s not in it.
Harry watches with a trained, casual eye as Snape offers the role of discipline, which Harry finds incredibly suspicious, and when they march swiftly out of the party and Slughorn attempts to restore the party atmosphere, Harry slips away quietly.
Harry leans forward, his eyes like the depths of a green forest, and Ron notes to himself that for the first time in weeks Harry seems to have come alive, with his shoulders brimming with untamed energy, a glimmer of the intensity that so shocked Ron at the Battle.
“No one will get hurt this time,” Harry says, stroking Hermione’s hair with one hand. But even as he says it, he’s not sure if he believes it anymore.
“It’s my fault,” Harry says darkly. “It’s my fault he’s dead. It’s not safe for you to be around me.” He looks at her for the first time and his eyes are storming, the green flash of a thundercloud. “There’s a war coming, Ginny.”
The problem of his “out of tune,” uncontrollable magic only becomes exacerbated when four very familiar letters, enveloped and stamped with Hogwarts’ bright red seal, arrive at the Weasley’s modest country estate in late July.
Harry fidgeted with the hem of his shirt. “His room. It’s too much. I was going to sleep downstairs, but I saw your light.”
Draco looks at him, then glances down the hall. Snape’s heeled shoes click louder and louder on the smooth floor and Harry holds his breath.
“It’s not right,” Draco says, and it comes out choked. Merlin, he has to pull himself together. “And for you of all people to do it.”
Mrs Weasley straightens up, looking at her husband shrewdly. “My dear, you don’t mean to tell me that you
He sighs, deflated, when he catches the fading impression of a large, ornate door on the far wall. Harry sprints over, but by the time he gets there, the door is gone and his hands press against the cool stone walls of the castle.
Time slows down, each second like a frame in a stop motion film, that peculiar effect when the universe wishes to tell you something, to warn you, that much hangs in the balance in this moment, that one wrong move will send the scales tipping.
“And quite right for you to think so,” Miss Granger says firmly. “I would have taken Herbology as well.”
When she shakes her head again, Harry circles his arms around her shoulders, hugging her to his chest. After a few moments, Hermione sits back, wiping her eyes with the back of her sleeve.
And then Pansy returned from her travels abroad. She was his best friend, but the aftermath of the war had wrenched them apart for the time being. Her family did not want anything to do with the Malfoys, packed up and moved to Paris, and forced Pansy to leave her friends behind.
Harry looks at Draco’s very pale face, his cheeks still wet with tears, and for the first time he feels truly terrified of what he has become. “No, I didn’t.”
The grass is damp under his jeans. Inhale, exhale. He can’t see the smoke in the darkness of the park, the nearest street lamp like a tiny white star in the distance. Harry lets the cigarette dangle in his fingers, a red glow between his knees.
his firebolt and flew after Draco. They nearly collided in the sky, and Harry chased after Draco, and when Harry caught him, Draco chased after Harry.
Hermione almost lets him go when a memory, a moment, really, flashes through her mind. A harmless, mundane conversation that she can scarcely remember now passes through her mind, but it wasn’t that which she finds peculiar now. It was Draco, when they were back in school, must have been in Sixth Year, huddled against the wall with Pansy Parkinson. They walked past and she caught Harry looking at him, smirking, and she remembers her surprise that Draco was looking right back, with a small, private smile on his face.
“I love you, Harry. I’ve moved on, but I will never stop loving you. And Ron and Hermione love you. And Mum and Dad love you. And Dumbledore loved you. So many people in your life, Harry, and yet you stand here like you’re all alone.” Ginny shakes her head, already turning away. Sometimes, the best thing—the only thing—is to walk away.
It is deep in the night when he hears a noise from across the hall, and he sits up. Pansy has left her room, and her footsteps fade as she walks downstairs. He holds his breath, listening. Even though he knows what is coming, his eyes still burn with unshed tears, and his chest aches as if pierced through by metal.
for Minister...She’s still so young, and there’s so much to do on the ground after the war, and then not to mention Rose.
He would be lying if he said he wasn't scared. Eighth year just started and he wasn't friends with anyone except Pansy and Blaise. Draco was talkative enough now, so people invited him to parties. But there was a group of loud, drunk teenagers outside the closet and he trusted none of them.
“What are you doing here?” Draco whispers angrily. Harry shrugs off the rest of his Invisibility Cloak and slips inside the curtains, crawling onto Draco’s bed. He can’t believe Harry Potter is in his bed.
“I’m not going to ask what happened,” Ginny says. “I just want to know what you need from me right now.”
Harry flinches, and Draco wonders if he’s heard that before. “I will give you protection from the Ministry. Malfoy, please, I need this.”
Hermione leaves them be to bask in the attention of a new engagement. She remembers how it felt, and looks toward the kitchen, where she glimpses Ron bent over the oven, his cheeks flushed, and she cannot escape a smile.
“Zabini?” The name resurfaces memories from long ago, huddled by the fire in the Slytherin common room to keep the dungeon’s chill away, whispering about their boys, debating who had a better smile, or who was sexier. “That was ages ago.”
At this Harry turns around, walking slowly but deliberately down the shop to a nearby shelf, stopping in front of the section of temporary mind altering potions. His hand reaches out, but does not touch, only hovering over one vial containing a smooth, violet liquid Draco knows only too well.
“Do you want to see it?” Draco asked hesitantly, as if he’s never shown anyone before. And perhaps he never has.
Pansy pretends to examine her nails, a freshly painted and sharpened black. “Oh, she just wondered if I knew if you and Harry were ever
Draco doesn’t care about scars anymore. He pulls up the sleeve on his arm, looking at his Dark Mark. How could he care about anything when
“Harry?” Hermione appears in the doorway to the kitchen, cheeks flushed and a glass of wine in one hand. She looks anxiously behind her, before looking at Harry and smiling. “What a wonderful surprise!”
“She’s great,” Ginny says warmly. “But how are you? Can’t remember the last time you came here to smoke. Thought you quit.”
“You’re absolutely love sick, Draco,” Pansy says, watching Draco smiling to himself, blushing at what must be not so innocent thoughts about a certain Chosen One. “It’s disgusting.”
Something in her eyes when she said that reminded Hermione of something, but for the rest of the day she had trouble remembering what. But she remembers now, and it doesn’t make sense.
“Malfoy has the Dark Mark,” Harry says. “I know it. We just have to trap him and force him to show it.”
“He chose his family, Harry,” Hermione says, and she feels so sad that Harry could get things so wrong. “You both had an impossible choice to make, which really means you had no choice at all.”
“No need to get defensive,” Harry says with a smirk, caressing the binding of the book and looking at Draco through his lashes. “I was only wondering what you were interested in.”
“I’d like to make a toast,” Harry begins, his voice soft. He clears his throat. “It’s been about ten years since the Second War started. I think about it a lot, we all do, around holidays, those we’ve lost, and it feels as if it were just yesterday when our whole world fell apart.”
With a weary sigh, Draco gets up, ignoring the pounding in his head, which aches in its heaviness. For a moment he feels so stupid, because Harry would do all that and then leave him in bed without a note.
“Please, sir,” Harry interjects with a charming smile that Hermione knows first hand is hard to resist. Slughorn hesitates, but Hermione knows he will cave. “It will only take a minute.”
“Would you still have protected me if I was in Slytherin?” Harry glances at the Sorting Hat, perched on a high shelf on the far wall, but it stays silent.
Harry moves forward at the exact same time Draco does, and they meet in the middle with force, their mouths fitted tightly against each other, no room for breath, until Draco moves his mouth away, across Harry’s jaw, down his neck, wet, careless kisses, finding his sensitive skin under his tongue, persistent until it stings.
So it was set. The Boy Who Lived would befriend the Weasley boy and later on the muggle-born Granger, for whatever random reason. Interestingly, Draco was not the only one who found this strange. Many other students considered these two misfits not good enough to accompany the Chosen One wherever he went. But it was Harry Potter, a well liked and powerful wizard, brought up under the Headmaster and most dangerous wizard in the world, Albus Dumbledore, and therefore everyone accepted what he did without hesitation, and Weasley and Granger received only the highest praise and attention.
“You can say yes, darling, I don’t mind,” Draco had said, lightly teasing the waistband of Harry’s briefs open. Harry groaned with his teeth clenched. He glanced at Pansy, taking in her body, all of her, and nodded quickly, closing his eyes briefly and opening them again.
“I trust you are well?” Mrs Malfoy asks politely. Harry nearly starts, being quite surprised she has continued the conversation.
“I have, though not on purpose,” Blaise says, frowning. “I really only thought about it when Draco would bring it up or ask me questions. Before he knew he was gay, of course.”
“Please,” Harry whispers, then moans when Malfoy shifts his knee closer between Harry’s legs. “Draco, please.”
“Because I’m not the enemy anymore? I’m not forbidden?” Draco suggests harshly, hugging himself tightly. Harry turns away, unable to look at him.
Ginny can quickly point out the windows and the structure and the lawn as examples of Hermione’s more clear cut, direct style of magic, while the artful colors of the wood panels, the slightly crooked attic window, and the homely pots with flowers on the porch that definitely creaks as you walk across it all subtly speak of Ron’s more casual, messy and yet personal magic touch. However, Ginny could not explain why she knows this; it’s a certain type of knowledge that comes only from careful, loving attention.
And if she’s learned anything, when it comes to Harry, it’s best not to investigate too much if you won’t like what you find.
Hermione shushes him sternly, and he clamps a hand over his mouth. With some luck Rose can’t hear him all the way up in the attic. “Yes, he told me he was in love with someone he couldn’t have, but refused to tell me who. But I’m so close to figuring it out. I just need to know for sure.”
“Don’t just stand there,” Draco says, his eyes glittering with amusement. “Please, take a seat on the couch. I have cheese and wine.”
Draco walked through the cliques and crowds of teenagers milling about the common room, left the dungeon, and rounded the same corner as Harry. He kept walking past the Great Hall, where a door just up ahead closed quietly.
“Malfoy can speak for himself,” Harry says softly. Malfoy looks up at Harry, betrayed, like Harry had slapped him. He turns swiftly on his heel, leaving the room.
“I see,” Harry says quietly. He lifts Draco again, and they walk out of the bar and behind the building, waiting for a few stray Muggles to disappear. “Hold on, Draco.” A hand squeezes his arm reassuringly before Harry braces himself for the dizzying Apparation.
“Let me,” Draco says, swatting Harry’s hands away and undoing the buttons with frightening speed, lifting his own shirt off roughly and throwing it on the ground, helping Harry shrug off his own shirt, struggle out of pants, dropping them off the side of the bed with a superior irritation, as if clothes aren’t a worthy impedance. There is no time for romance or enticing gestures of slow reveals, just skin on skin, just straight pleasure like a shot of vodka to the back of the throat, eyes stinging at the shock.
Draco swears he sees a flicker of hurt pass over Harry’s face, but then he decides it was probably just annoyance. The emotion fades, leaving a smirk and green eyes fixed on Draco’s face. He doesn’t understand why Harry has just now decided to find Draco so worth his time.
to empathize with others whom you do not understand. You may be surprised to discover that we are not so different from each other after all.
“Well, it’s just...I heard you, one night. When I was sleeping in Dean’s bed. You got up and I heard the door open and you left. I thought maybe you went to the bathroom, but no one was there.”
Up and up and up. Harry can’t see anything well, going off sound and instinct alone. Malfoy pauses occasionally, most likely to look around, and Harry freezes, hoping the rustle of his Cloak isn’t as loud as it seems.
“If by happiness, you mean acquiring a suitable marriage for each, then yes. Otherwise, I am afraid that
He hasn't talked about it yet, though that’s hardly unusual. Harry has always kept his true feelings close to his chest. But Ginny wishes that he would confide in her more, at least about something.
Pansy smiles, but it fades when he slips an arm around her waist, his touch sparking against her skin, a familiar ache in her body. She looks at him looking at her, and wonders what he sees, why he wants her to stay. Is it for the same reason?
Draco pulls the shirt over his head with both hands. His gaze wanders over Harry’s chest, down his abdomen, the slight indents of his hips. Then Draco kisses him again, his hands wrapping around his waist, sliding up and down his back, over the ridges of his spine. His back ripples in anticipation, and the edges of his vision heighten their color, so that Draco’s mouth is red like a cherry, and his skin is pale and shiny beside his glowing bronze hands.
“Stop, I’m serious!” Draco shouts, and his hands are trembling. He takes the box from Harry’s hands with a quick motion, gripping it to his chest.
Draco smiles as his mouth continues its path down his abdomen, where he looks up and touches Harry’s belt buckle. Harry nods, and can barely look, his gaze swinging up to the ceiling, as his belt falls away and Draco’s fingers curl under the waistband of his briefs, and everything goes very cold, and then very hot, and Harry labors for breath, his fingers finding curly hair, then gripping the couch, his hips buckling, then jerking, his teeth biting his lip to prevent a gasp, his legs trembling, seizing up, his eyes squeezed shut, the world black and then blinding white and then nothing and then all is still.
“I think you know exactly what I mean.” Draco smirks. “That’s the trouble of keeping so many secrets, Harry. One might just...come out.”
Hermione snaps her attention back to the present, shaking off her half formed thoughts. She’s very close to piecing it all together, but there’s still a few missing links.
“No, please, come in. I was just looking over a memory,” Hermione says, motioning for Draco to come forward. He places the parcel on her desk, and with a wave of his wand, it unrolls.
“Still,” Ron says so earnestly that even Hermione raises a brow, to which he blushes, though continuing anyway. “Still, we don’t know why they ended things in Sixth Year, and how Ginny was involved. And now, do you think they reignited their flame, so to speak?”
“Do you suppose Miss Granger right? That we may not be accepted into the classes of our choice?” Weasley asks.
“It was during Sixth Year,” Hermione says pointedly, to which Ron smiles sheepishly. “Exactly. We weren’t on speaking terms at the time, and then by the end of the year, Harry and Ginny were dating again and I forgot all about it.”
“Relax, Pansy.” Though Draco himself feels none too relaxed. His fingers tremble ever so slightly as he buttons the cuffs of his pressed long sleeve. Pansy elegantly slips off the couch and pads over to Draco, murmuring gently to let her do it, taking his cuffs in her hands and expertly buttoning them. Many people could not imagine Pansy being gentle, but Draco has witnessed her rare moments of nurture and knows how loving Pansy can be when she wants to.
Harry sits back, his heart pounding, imagining the scene of the Battle. He remembers a giant’s fist knocking into the Gryffindor Tower, the stone collapsing under the force. For some reason, Harry always assumed that the Ministry would dispatch a group of professional builders and with a flick of a wand the tower would restore itself. But this sounds ominous.
Draco’s wand wavers. He wants to believe that Harry would help him, that their love would conquer all, even this task.
She hears Harry and Draco begin to stir from the couch, clearing the dishes on the table, and slowly moving upstairs. They are lingering, she knows, because they can all sense the sun setting on their time together.
"I thought you wouldn't come." Harry. Who else? He heard each word like a vibration wherever Harry touched him.
She looks back at him one last time, standing there on the balcony, his unruly curls and his green eyes and his lips, almost pouting, still seducing her, still waiting for her to kiss them.
“Fly of course. What else?” Draco snatched the nearest broom, an old model that Harry never imagined Draco would ride, and nimbly saddled it, rocketing up into the sky.
He opens the book to where he had left a small piece of parchment marking where he left off, scanning the page not for the words already printed inside, but the scrawled handwriting crammed in the margins. The black ink is almost seductive in its hidden knowledge.
,” Pansy quotes, and for a moment Draco remembers the night he said that to her, the cold wind off the icy lake stinging his cheeks, the sheer drop from the Astronomy Tower seeming to end in a fathomless darkness in the deep winter night.
Harry never knows how long this part lasts. The torture is endless in the moment, his mind foggy, his body pulsing everywhere.
“Perhaps.” Harry walks forward, standing beside Draco, resting his hands on the railing and looking out at the lake, a flat expanse of glassy water sparkling with starlight, hugged close by rolling green hills. “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”
She gets up, moving his feet from her lap not so gently. Draco doesn’t bother. Surely it’s a Muggle that’s wandered up the wrong floor, or else a teenage wizard set on pranking former followers of the Dark Lord. Either way, it concerns him not.
Harry traces the notes with his fingertips, then turns the page. A darker scrawled note draws his attention at the top of the next page.
“Surprise me, oh dear! Invitations to my very own children, no less!” But Mrs Weasley is hiding a smile now.
“Well I know we didn’t do more than that,” Draco says irritably, then looks away, reminding himself not to sound too invested. “I remember you said something, though.”
Hermione rolls her eyes. “Yes, it is. The Ministry approached Draco asking for help. It took a lot of persuading on our part to get him to agree.”
The painting swings inward, revealing a dark tunnel. He ducks inside and meanders below the castle until he finds the kitchens, a room with a low ceiling and a large, hot furnace, low counter tops that take up the middle of the room, and shelves along the wall packed with sacks of flour and sugar and salt, jars of different jams and preservatives, and encased behind glass that must be enchanted cold a variety of salted meats and fish.
Draco turns, eyes downcast. He walks towards a nearby pile of junk, covered in a thick layer of dust, and something large and looming covered in a dirty white sheet. He pulls the sheet off in one fluid motion, revealing the Vanishing Cabinet that he’s been working so tirelessly on for these past months.
He had only ever wanted his father to be home, to treat him like his child, and not a secret weapon that could not follow him on his adventures and trips for fear of being damaged. Harry now knows with a damning certainty that Dumbledore spent many, many nights at Hogwarts instead of with him, and the ring of truth to it hurts more than anything.
Then he Apparates without another word, leaving Draco dizzy like his whole world has flipped—but instead of upside down, it’s as if everything around him is finally rightside up.
“I need you,” Harry says, choked, “It happened. It’s all ended. The world is ending. I need you. I promised. I need you now. Help me. I need you. I need you…”
“If I’m honest, it wasn’t my idea,” Draco says. “I hope you don’t mind, but I showed my flatmate, Pansy—you remember her from school?—the floor plans, as she had been family friends with the former owners. She's my best friend. I trust her with my life.”
“Oh Harry’s here!” Ron grins at him, but Harry doesn’t return it. He sits down in the empty seat across from Draco, with Ron and Hermione at the ends of the table.
“You don’t love me,” Pansy says after a long drag, the smoke curling up into the night sky. When Harry refuses to answer, she continues, shaking her head. “You don’t understand. You and Draco, you have that love which no one can take away. It runs deep. It’s not just sex; it’s more than sex. But I don’t—I can’t have that with you, or with him. I love both of you, but it’s a passing love.”
He walks towards the edge, looking down at the black abyss, knowing always a second too late that he’s falling, falling backwards like his father, Albus Dumbledore, the person he looked up to and the person he loved and the person he resented, all at the same time.
“Well, I did want to, but then I would have to drop Care of Magical Creatures. I couldn’t bear to disappoint Professor Hagrid as we did that one time. I figured Charms was the only subject I felt comfortable missing, as I have already read the assigned textbook.”
Draco wants to scream, to throw a potion vial at Harry’s face, to grab Harry’s cloak by the front and kiss him hard. The mixture of emotions results in a simmering silence that lasts for what feels like an eternity.
Hermione surfaces from her Pensieve, thoughts clouding her head. She knows this is the memory, somehow, the last piece to the puzzle, but nothing made any sense, and if anything, she’s more confused than before.
“You need a shave,” Draco whispers, rubbing his cheek against Harry’s jaw, before biting the skin there. Harry hisses and nudges him away with his head, then ducking and kissing him hard so that his head hits the wall, but Draco only growls and wraps his arms more tightly around Harry’s waist, bringing him closer.
“Mr Potter,” she replies with a curtsy, eyeing each of the Malfoys warily. The last time they were all in this shop at the same time, a duel almost broke out between Harry and Mr Malfoy.
No. He stumbles away from the edge, and Pansy rushes to him, taking him in her arms. Draco let’s the sobs heave his chest, tears sliding down his cheeks, soaking her cloak. Pansy strokes his back comfortingly.
“Done,” Pansy says. “Follow me.” She leads Hermione across the store to the dressing rooms. She opens one and hangs up the various pant suits. “Start with the black one. And use this white button down for now.”
She nods with a look of motherly affection, then steps aside. Harry hesitates for one moment. He looks across the platform, but it is empty. Malfoy must already be on the train.
Harry shrugs, and his face looks empty and cold. “We thought it would’ve been safer, with the task Voldemort gave him.”
That look was the same one Draco had when Harry had walked into their office the other day. The same stunned quiet, the same rising pride, the same utter hopelessness, all at the same time. Perhaps it is a unique trait in Slytherins? But somehow Hermione doubts that. This is something else, perhaps not unrelated, but certainly deeper, and absolutely more important.
“Sometimes,” Draco says quietly, “I wonder what our lives would be like if I had been born into a long line of Ravenclaws with no affiliations to the Dark Lord, or simply in another family entirely. Would we still find each other?”
Another silence ensues, in which both of them look anywhere else except at each other. Finally Draco sighs, running a hand through his disheveled hair.
“Honestly, I’m not very interested in politics,” Harry finally says, which at least isn’t a lie. The man looks startled, but not upset.
Just then Draco tenses, his gaze latching onto someone in the distance, coming down the hallway. Pansy follows his gaze and sees Harry flanked by Ron and Hermione, both in a heated argument that Harry seems to be ignoring.
“Draco,” Harry warns, but it’s no use. Draco’s hands are already weaving in his hair, and their lips collide in a confusion of knees slipping between legs, hands sliding between skin and fabric, their bodies entwining with such force and desperation it’s like Harry is back in Sixth Year lost in a moment he knew would never last. Draco's mouth is warm and soft and everything he remembers it to be—
“Hermione, quick, look.” She scrambles over to him without thinking, and Harry shows her the map of the Third Floor, and points to a pair of footsteps.
Hermione hesitates, wondering if she had misread—as is common when it comes to Harry—but the dark circles under his eyes, the tense set to his shoulders, and a deep weariness in his frown convince her that she’s on to something.
With her heart beating in her throat like it’s a first date and not a domestic night with her family, Hermione tiptoes down the hall, the cool air prickling her almost entirely bare skin, and quietly opens the door to their bedroom.
Harry’s hips buck up to meet him, filling him up, deeper and wider, so he feels torn asunder. He senses the moment coming, and he quickens his pace, touching himself while keeping one hand on the couch. Pansy’s legs tense around Harry’s face, and Draco knows he is close behind, and when Harry’s hips spasm, jerking forward, coming inside of him, Draco cries out, unable to hold back any longer.
She always hated it, and suspects Harry does too. Or maybe he doesn’t care enough to hate it, though Ginny prefers not to think of him like that. Like he’s a monster.
He smooths out his clothes that always get a little cramped after Apparating. Then he takes a deep breath and knocks.
A clamor of wood screeching on stone whips Hermione’s attention over to Draco, who’s standing up, his body rigid and tense. She looks over quickly at Harry, but while he has gone very still, his expression remains closed off.
“Good day, Mr. Potter,” she says, tipping her head, the bluebirds twittering softly. The doors shudder closed, and without warning, the lift drops again. Harry smooths his suit down, thankful to exit the lift when it stops, and makes his way across the grand, polished hallway to the Auror offices.
Draco Apparates to Harry’s apartment doorstep as he usually does to work on the Sad Nightingale at late hours of the night. Though it has been a few days since last coming here, as the potion required exactly seven minutes over seven days of boiling on low heat with no added ingredients.
It is Valentine’s Day. He has not been on a proper date in years. Is this a proper date? He has been around Draco many times, though always with other people. Their friends have been waiting for this to happen. Everyone says it was inevitable. Harry never saw it.
“I don’t cook.” When Draco looks at him in surprise, Harry frowns and looks away. “I usually have dinners with Ron, since he eats alone often when Hermione works late at the Ministry. And I go to a lot of luncheons and have a coffee for breakfast.” The way he phrases it makes him look charitable, but Draco just thinks he looks lonely.
How quickly had Draco slipped through his fingers? And, if he thinks about it, did he ever really have him to begin with?
Harry sits up, dropping Ginny’s hand. She straightens her head, and Harry can just make out her blue eyes, so bright and startling in a sea of brown freckles. She looks at Harry with a terrible pity.
Ginny sighs, seeing her path unfold like it always does in the things that matter. She knows how to put a brave face and soldier on. Make the right choice, not the easy one.
“Oh I don’t know, to ask her how she’s doing with something as emotionally draining as a break up,” Hermione replies tersely.
She has always loved to watch two men kiss, but watching Harry and Draco kiss is something else. Is it wrong to say that of everything she will miss, she will miss watching them kiss the most?
the answer, this is the knowing, which he had always wondered at. He places his hands on Draco and knows that he touches the truth, that he touches life, pure and unaltered life.
“Why should I? It seems the only person in my way...is you. If you won’t let me do this, well, you leave me no choice.”
“I love you.” Harry says it so plainly, not like a reason but a fact of life, with a stark surety that belies every doubt and worry Draco has ever had.
“Merlin, Harry, you scared me.” Draco narrows his eyes, tensing all over again. “Did you follow me?”
Miss Granger’s eyes continue rapidly reading her letter, which looks as if someone wrote a lengthy note at the bottom.
them. So at the time I thought it was a harmless crush from afar, but now I think it was something more. And...” Hermione hesitates, wondering if she should tell Ron her theory just yet.
Luckily, Harry has not left him, and as far as Draco is aware, isn’t planning on it. They have talked of marriage, hesitantly, but never too long, never in detail, for Pansy always lingers in the back of their minds, like a remaining puzzle piece that doesn’t quite fit in the last gap of the puzzle, but as long as that is ignored, the idea of finishing it one day in the vague future remains hopeful and exciting.
Raised in the Muggle world, Harry had to learn all kinds of antiquated manners and customs, from the way he spoke to the way he dressed. Luckily, Hogwarts holds an elective class that meets twice a month for First Year Muggleborn students. They learned how to dance, to use silverware properly, to address professors, and most importantly―though they all thought it mightily silly at the time―courtship. While Harry and Miss Granger found courtship hilarious, they both privately acknowledged how intimidating it is to think that they could offend someone simply by using their first name.
They pull apart when Draco needs to breathe, and Harry curses, his chest rising and falling rapidly, leaning his forehead on Draco’s. It’s almost too much, after all this time, to kiss and to touch each other like it’s the first time, like they hadn’t nearly done just this that night after the bar, that they hadn’t been both waiting and dreaming and
She doesn’t bother with ringing the doorbell. He won’t answer. Instead, she comes straight in without a key, the apartment recognizing her magic. The living room is empty and clean. No dirty dishes in the kitchen except a single glass. She thinks for a moment she catches a glimmer of a Concealment charm, but the thought that Harry would be hiding something in his kitchen just sounds too ridiculous for her to investigate.
“Quite.” Draco suddenly feels awkward, unsure of where they go from here. Harry scratches the back of his neck, as if feeling the same way.
She nods, and beckons him over. “This might come as a shock to you, but Harry had a secret relationship at Hogwarts that we didn’t know about.”
Harry’s heart pounded in his chest. Draco adjusted the green scarf wrapped around his neck as he took a seat exactly opposite of Harry. A bit warm to be wearing a scarf, but Harry supposed it made up for the skimpy grey t-shirt Draco wore that revealed pale arms.
He kisses Harry’s hand, and Harry gives in, less reluctantly than he had hoped, letting Draco hold him in his arms again, their mouths finding each other, kissing each other slowly, pliant lips warm like sunlight.
“A few hours ago,” Hermione retorts, lifting her bare wrist. She kisses him, and he almost staggers off balance. “I see you’ve had fun.”
“I thought perhaps you would have some expertise on the matter,” Harry says, ignoring his question. “Is there another potion…?”
Dumbledore waits, then nods. “Right then. I called you here to go on a mission with me. A very dark, dangerous mission, no doubt about it, and I would spare you if I could. As it is, I cannot do this alone, and there is no other person in this world that I trust as much as you.”
“What do you want, Potter?” Draco asks, sounding tired and pinched. He looks well, though, his pale skin smooth and his hair combed, falling just below his angular cheekbones. The white dress shirt only pronounces the angry blush blooming across his face.
“Your family,” Pansy says desperately. “Your family will die. He will kill them, and you know it. Think of your mother, Draco. She would die if you did this. Please, come here. We’ll get through this together. Just come here. Please.”
He enters into a lift that’s just closing, smiling at an elderly lady with a hat that nests a family of bluebirds. She smiles at Harry, but her eyes are sad. Harry’s used to seeing it after the war. Everyone has lost something, after all.
His lips curve into an odd smile. “I know it’s going to happen. I can sense that it’s me, at some other time. I don’t know when, but it’s real. That’s how I die.”
“Take them off,” Draco says, casually gesturing to Harry’s briefs. Harry slides them off in relief, his cock glistening red in the glow of the coals. He pushes Harry back against the couch, and Harry complies silently, lying back, his heart beating sporadically as Draco quickly slips out of his remaining clothes.
“I suppose,” Harry says awkwardly, wondering if Dumbledore hadn’t heard about his incident with Draco. It’d be strange, but not surprising.
A red taint blinds his vision like a shower of blood, and he realizes distantly, as if his mind has floated above his body, that his hand is gripping his wand.
“That’s very kind.” Then she hesitates, her smile dropping into a frown. “I do have one more thing…”
Harry fails to block the hex this time, and his limbs slow down, each step a few seconds long. But it won’t last.
Regulus Arcturus Black. There was a faint light under the doorframe. Draco must still be up, like him. The decision was made in that instance, but he only moved towards the door a few seconds afterwards. He knocked lightly.
“Well, not quite, but I do not mind in the slightest,” Harry says, attempting to be cheerful. The rest of them look at him, including Mr Weasley, who lowers his Daily Prophet. “This is all for the best. I am sure the Headmistress had good reason not to accept me.”
Draco knew the door opened when the voices and laughter outside briefly raised, before the door clicked shut and the world outside became muffled again. The presence of another living, breathing person in the room made Draco's skin prickle. He heard their breath, the slight movement of their limbs, the natural heat off their skin.
Harry pauses. If he tells Dumbledore now, Draco’s plans would be ruined, and the Dark Lord would kill him if the Ministry didn't lock him up in Azkaban first. But if he doesn’t tell Dumbledore, then…
A heavy hush had fallen among them, and it felt almost magical, as if Harry’s words had settled a mist around them and the ghosts of people they will always remember had laid a hand on their shoulders, a blessing from an angel.
Draco and his mother did not serve time in Azkaban, though his father did. They went to France for two years, then returned when Lucius was released. Harry saw him, Pansy, and Blaise walking the streets of London late at night, where he was at a pub with his friends, the usual crowd of Gryffindors, and a few more, as they were celebrating  Ron’s birthday. He called them inside, a little drunk, and they spent the rest of the night catching up, laughing, reminiscing.
Harry half smiles, and Draco has to hide his own, as it was a sort of silly thing to say; the kitchen could be seen from the door, with pristine white cupboards and shiny marble counter tops. They walk over together, Harry sweeping his arm wide in a mocking gesture of reveal when they reach the tiled floor.
Harry’s mouth flattens in that line Draco found so mysterious that one day, eternities ago, before this whole thing got so out of hand. Now he wants to slap that controlled emotionless frown right off his face.
Beneath his hands the railing begins to crumble, turning to ash and floating away. Harry leans over, but doesn’t fall. He wants to fall. He has a reason to fall.
But usually, Hermione slept up here in Sirius’ room because Harry could hardly think about Sirius since his death, while Harry and Ron slept on the couches downstairs in the living room. Draco always took Regulus’ room. Perhaps it reminded him of the Slytherin dungeon. Perhaps he just liked to be alone.
Some nights, Draco wonders what life at Hogwarts would have been like for him, if Harry Potter had died as a baby, or if he had grown up somewhere else. He once overheard his parents angrily discussing the adoption of Harry Potter by Dumbledore. His mother had observed that if only the Dark Lord had not killed Harry’s remaining muggle relatives, maybe he would be an easier target now.
That this time she wouldn’t need to save him. And then a voice asks quietly and dangerously and clearly in the back of her mind, almost a whisper and yet as loud as the truth, and it sounds like Luna right before she points to the stars.
Harry stands on Platform 9 of King’s Cross Station with Miss Granger and the Weasleys. As usual, they stand out sorely, being dressed in what is considered casual attire among the magical community. This means the women wear long dresses with corsets and multiple layers of fabric, although plain and practical for witches, they appear grossly outdated to the Muggles passing by, many of whom look quizzically at them.
He stares into the crackling fire of the Gryffindor common room. Almost everyone else has gone to bed, except for Hermione. She hunches over her notes with laser focus, probably for the Potions exam they have tomorrow.
Pansy could think of a million and one reasons off the top of her head, but scanning Draco’s face she quickly deduces he wouldn’t understand any of them. So instead she shrugs, saying, “I guess you’re right.”
Hermione carefully watches Harry as he looks at Ginny hold Dean’s hand, but he doesn’t say anything or express any annoyance or hurt. Ron and Hermione share a look, then blush, the awkwardness from the pub last Hogsmeade trip still on both their minds.
“You didn’t answer my question,” Harry says. He points to the velvet box that looks like some type of gift. Something about it feels off though, when Harry looks at it, like a sick feeling pooling in his stomach. “And what’s in that box?”
Harry smirks. “Come and get it.” Draco lunges, and Harry darts around him, but he realizes his mistake too late. He walks backwards towards the far end of the restroom as Draco corners him into the back wall, right next to the last stall. When Harry tries to make a run for it, Draco uses his wider wingspan to block Harry from escaping.
Their procession into the castle is more like a funeral march, and no one says much as they take their seats for the Welcome Feast. Harry is in such a daze that he nearly sits down right away, and is saved from embarrassment by Weasley’s firm hand preventing him. They remain standing throughout the Sorting, which is conducted with more gravity than usual. Finally, the last small First Year is sorted into Ravenclaw.
Suddenly the memory rushes away in a loud blur like a wave crashing over their heads, and they rise together with a gasp as if they had been holding their breaths. Ron stares at Hermione, stunned.
“You never stop being a Death Eater,” Harry says coldly, and his voice sounds so different than last night, like two different Harrys are trapped in the same body, one light and one dark.
“But that’s in so long,” Lavender complains. She leans in, kissing him, the only thing they seem to do together, not that Ron minds. Her round blue eyes and long lashes give him a flirty, suggestive look. “Imagine what could happen in those long, long hours…”
Then everything happened in a whirlwind, and Draco's thoughts struggled to catch up as his body took over.
Ginny briefly closes his eyes. “I don’t know what you want me to do. Luna and I are traveling to Nepal tonight.”
“Well,” Weasley says, hesitantly, “she died before she had the chance to recover it. Though I am sure if she had lived, her magic would have been restored eventually.”
The rest of the castle did not fare better, with large streaks of black as thick as tar marring the beautiful stone. Chunks of the walls are missing where a spell blasted through it. Great swathes of the castle grounds are completely burnt and show no signs of returning life.
“Let’s just say he wasn’t the first fellow to try and chat me up,” Draco says with a smirk, and now Harry can definitely detect a slight slur in his voice. Just then the bartender places two shots of vodka in front of them. Harry waves Draco’s reaching hand away, downing both of them himself.
Draco’s shirt has come up halfway, and he feels he must finish the work. The shirt is lifted more, and Draco pulls it off, sifting his hair around, his cheeks flushed from the effort. Harry becomes paralyzed once more, returning to a state of watching, his mind floating somewhere outside of his body. Draco lowers his eyes.
Pansy had agreed almost in relief. The thought of openly admitting that type of vulnerability to the entire school was nothing short of a panic attack. Behind closed doors she is safe, she is protected, she retains her power.
“Be sure to send your response by tonight, and expect a few rejections. I hardly think Professor McGonagall shall play favorites in this,” she says carefully looking at neither of them. “Now, I must rest, for I expect we will know which classes we are accepted into by the morning after next, and from then on there will be no more peace.”
“Rose has just fallen asleep for her nap,” Ron says in an awkwardly offhanded way, that Hermione has learned to realize is his way of signalling that he’s in the mood. She had always assumed his reluctance to explicitly say anything meant he didn’t care, but if anything, it has always meant that he’s cared too much.
“Is this okay?” Draco asks against his lips. He moves his other hand underneath Harry’s sweater, finding his warm skin with his cold hands, feeling like a brand of fire so hot it’s like ice. Harry involuntarily shivers, and Draco moves the hand across his stomach, which jolts with pleasure.
This time Draco scoots in closer, a hand pressing underneath his chin, pulling him towards his mouth. They meet softly, but with less doubt, fully exploratory now. Draco dips his head, his mouth opening gently against Harry’s.
“But clearly not everything,” Harry counters coldly. “What do you and your little Death Eater friends plan to do once inside the castle? I’m not stupid. I know they don’t plan to have a slumber party in the Dungeons.”
A love language, Draco thinks, when Harry’s finger begins drawing meaningless patterns on his shoulder blade.
The door downstairs swings open, then closes shut, loud enough that Draco knows he was meant to hear it.
Longbottom smiles proudly, as if personally pleased that Harry has addressed him, then sits. “Very well, thank you. It is very gracious of the Headmistress to allow us another year at Hogwarts, is it not?”
She looks briefly at Harry’s bed, where she’s spent more time than she’d like to admit. It’s somewhat strange now to sneak up here and sleep in a different bed. His curtains are drawn tight. Ginny glances around, then tiptoes over to his bed. Just one look, one last look of Harry without him looking back.
“I think I’d be ashamed of it, a little,” Draco says thoughtfully, as if Harry weren’t there at all.
Whoever compared love to butterflies or warmth had obviously felt nothing of the sort. Draco had known for a long time that love had more to do with dread and nausea than any fluttery, flimsy feeling. Merlin, Draco thought he might throw up.
His body worked on autopilot, his hand catching the door handle clumsily. The door gave, and Draco cautiously opened it.
Harry tosses in bed. He can’t really sleep, though this isn’t a rare occurrence. Sleep has never come easily to Harry. Probably a product of his parent’s death before he could say their names, and perhaps an evil sorcerer dead set on killing him doesn’t help either.
“I can stay for tea,” Ginny relents. “But I need to stop by the apartment to pick up some of my things.” Hermione and Ron share a look. “I still have some clothes there. Luna and I plan to leave for Morocco tonight. She likes to travel by starlight.” She blushes and stops talking. Hermione looks at her with a sudden curiosity, while Ron clears his throat.
“Please don’t do this,” Draco says, tears spilling down his cheeks. “Not you, Harry. I need you. I can’t—you won’t—”
“Very well,” Slughorn says, shifting awkwardly on his feet. He clears his throat, and Draco sits down, flushing. “The Sad Nightingale. A permanent mind altering potion invented year 1433 in Rome, Italy. It was banned when several wizards and witches...took their lives from the side effects.”
Then Draco gasps, suddenly, and Harry grips his waist, pulling him in deeper, finding a rhythm, the ebb and flow, his body connected to Draco’s body, their pulses beating at the same pace, the pulse in Harry’s mouth hot and smooth. And Harry listens to Draco groan, then sigh, then shudder, against him, his hands taking Harry’s hair in his fists and pulling, he feels Draco’s legs nearly give, and he marvels at his power, at his knowledge, in this position, the gateway into another soul, into intimacy with another beating heart.
