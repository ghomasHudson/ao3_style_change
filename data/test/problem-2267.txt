You still want to be good for me?
Prongs:  I lost track of you there at the end of the ball.
Harry: Fuck.
Harry: His
“Your Dad didn’t play – oh,” she said, arching an eyebrow at Harry, “we’re still on that kick, are we?” Harry nodded, dramatically.
Ginny: Can’t. I’m up now. Come make me breakfast.
Ginny: "Sorry."

Ginny: Ugh, get a room you two!
“Not really,” Teddy stated emphatically. The innocence of childhood allowing him to remain entirely oblivious to the war of emotion clearly swirling around Draco’s head. “That just happens sometimes. Dad says my eyes’ first color is brown, like my first Dad’s, and my hair gets stuck pink a lot, so I s’pose that’s my hair’s first color.”
Prongs: Are you admitting I’ve pulled you?
Prongs: What’s up with you not wanting to meet Prongs in person? You got a small prick or something?
Ginny: Fine, I’ll stop.
Greenviper: You do know that’s not the aphorism, yes?
“I can’t very well say no to that, now can I?” Draco said, looking everywhere but directly at Harry.
I made you a gift to repay you for the books. I Really did enjoy them.
Harry: I Remember. Fondly.
Harry: Alright, go ahead.
Harry: Isn’t really interested. Just wants a flirty pin pal or something.
Harry: WOW!
Draco: I’m outside the door. Come get me!
Sorry, should have warned you.
Harry: It scares me that I don’t know if you’re taking the piss or not.
Harry: "I consent.  Fuck! That feels…Merlin, it’s like.
Draco: So you’ll msg me when you’re home?
Ron: Yeah, alright. No need to panic.
Harry: "What does the other potion do?"
Draco slowly forced the rest of the towel into his mouth. Harry coughed and gagged and coughed some more until Draco was tucking the last corner into his mouth. Draco smiled, unfiltered lust written all over his face. Harry thought he could come just from Draco looking at him like that, knowing that he had put it there.
McGonagall: Feel free to retrieve it at any time.
Harry: Me too, mate. Me too!
Harry: Don’t people just use it to hook up?
Hermione: You know who’s here alone, however? Malfoy!
“Wait, breath freshening charm,” he said. Harry shook his head, laughing.
Harry: Great idea, Gin, can we use yours?
Harry: W
Harry: "Yes!"
Harry: …Well I kind of wanted the reveal to be in person.
Malfoy waited, rooted in his spot, far too close to Harry and looking confident beyond any reasonable doubt that he was right. Was he right? Who had Harry pictured during those late night phone calls, whose voice had he been expecting to hear? When Hydra swore to Harry that he had changed, why was the mere thought of Malfoy enough to understand and believe him.
Harry: Smart man.
Hermione: "Now, back to business. As the event begins at 19:30, we expect the band to arrive at 17:00."
Ron: There’s that Tristram Brassinwieght bloke a year above us. I used to catch him with Zabini on patrols all the time.
She schooled her face when she discovered she’d been caught out.
Ron: Uhh because you’ll be one of my groomsmen!
Blaise: I trust you remember it, all the same.
Ginny: Most people start with downloading it.
Greenviper: Do tell.
He’s different, I swear.
Prongs: HAHAHA You’re sick.
“This is me,” Malfoy said when, after dinner, they’d arrived at a large, grey townhouse on a London street corner. It was smart magic; to any muggles passing by it would simply look like an abandoned pop-up shop location.
Mr. Brewer: "17:00!"
Greenviper: That, they are.
Harry: Draco Malfoy.
Lavender: "Harry?"
“Uhh, rude,” Harry said, aghast.
Prongs: Is that why your family’s in Azkaban?
Greenviper: No.
Harry: I’m not sure about all the grey. It’s very...bright.
Greenviper: I have to get back to this.
Greenviper: You went to Hogwarts, yes? You should know not to give a Slytherin this much power.
Prongs: Are we fighting? When did we start fighting?
“You can’t be serious?” Malfoy deadpanned. “How is it possible you’re this thick?” He sucked in a long, exaggerated breath, staring at Harry like he’d just asked him for directions to the Yule Ball. For Harry’s part, Malfoy could give him any face he desired so long as he moved down a seat and promised to do his very best to not be so damn attractive. “You mind if I order us drinks while you work this out in that remarkably dense head of yours?”
Harry: “I know! So could you stop being such a git about it? I’m not going anywhere.”
You’ve done well, Prongs.
Ginny: Fuck no.
Ginny: It’s a good face. Serves me well. Come on, Harry, I’ll throw in another broom?
Harry: Did YOU just say I looked good?
Ginny: WHAT? Since when?
Greenviper: We’re breaking up.
“My, how presumptuous we are,” Malfoy said, utterly oblivious to what Harry was going through.  “I was under the impression that all that fan-seeking nonsense I used to spew was – “
Pansy: Oh, it’s not so bad. Woman up and stop being such a Hufflepuff.
Draco: "Does your godson know you fancy blokes?"
Padma: Parvati wasn’t eating solid food for a while.
Hermione: No more about weddings!!!
Harry: "Oh god."
Harry: "I beg you not to make me look that word up right now."
Pansy: In one of our brief and unfortunate times together, did I mistakenly give you the impression that I cared?
Whose stupid eyes, Prongs? Should I be jealous?
Harry: “That’s the best you can do?”
Harry: Theodore.
Prongs: Could be fun.
It took so long for the other man to respond that Harry broke his rule and turned toward him. Malfoy had two fingers pressed to his right temple to show Harry just how inconvenienced he was by his presence.
Blaise: Always good to be sure.
Harry: “Chang?”
Harry: Gin…this broom is worth like 30,000 galleons
Greenviper: Yes, it is a POSTPONED discussion.
Greenviper: I already asked the incompetent muggle to deliver it to my home but she informed me that it would arrive midday tomorrow. When I explained to her that I needed to wear it this evening, she said there was nothing else she could do.
Mr. Brewer: "Huh?"
Prongs: O rite!!! K pres time!
Greenviper: Wrap my legs around your waist.
Ron: Ever since Ginny and Pansy moved in together, Mum’s been really pushing the marriage and kids bit. Worried about grandchildren or some rubbish like that.
It was beneath you.
Harry: Hadn’t you heard, Gin. I Decided to take a page out of your book and give 24-7 twat a try.
Draco: "Impossible not to. You have to say ‘I consent’ to activate the potion."
Harry: But you push me to go on more dates than anyone. You’re the reason I got on Howlr in the first place!
Draco: "That sound should be illegal."

Harry:
the distraction?” Both Draco’s hands began a path up Harry’s bare chest. Harry’s breath hitched, feeling everywhere Draco touched like fiend fire licking at his skin. “When I had to watch you walk around yesterday evening like this,” he found Harry’s nipples, rubbing at them with the pads of his thumbs. Harry sighed, pushing his chest into Draco’s hands. “And because of the presence of my cousin,” Draco continued, “I could do nothing about it.”
“Says who,” Harry goaded.
Ginny: Ugh, fine.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, a bit flushed. “You can’t know how much unfair shite Teddy gets for it. And right now he’s five and adorable, what’s going to happen when he gets older?”
Dean: You’re the best!
Dean: Oh yeah…Sorry about that.
“Open up,” Draco instructed, pulling Harry out of his blissful wonderings.
“Oh,” Harry said, combing his hand through his hair a bit madly now. “Well… well, that‘s the first I’ve heard of that.” He took a deep breath. “I didn’t know why Nott went to Azkaban.”  Malfoy looked murderous. Harry could hear the long labored breaths he was taking to calm himself down.
, Draco was filthy in the best way, face red, eyes wild, hands trembling. Harry pushed back, maintaining eye-contact as he fucked himself on the tongue. Draco opened his mouth wide, holding his tongue out as straight as he could. Harry rocked back and forth until Draco curled his tongue inside him, keeping him in place. Harry’s balls drew up, painfully.
Theo: I’m trying not to be insulted, Potter. When are you taking me out?
Harry: “Sorry, I’ll take the salad, small cheese and large meat lover’s please.”
Harry: …
Ron: Sod off!
Ginny: Really?!? So if your Howlr bf apparated to your flat and offered to suck you off you’d what? Politely decline?
Harry: That’s not what I said!
“What the fuck, Potter?”  Draco hissed. Harry flinched internally at Draco’s language and checked again to make sure Teddy hadn’t made an appearance.
Harry: I just had a good feeling about this bloke. He was funny and sassy and used words like auspicious.
Prongs: Thank Merlin, now I can stop looking at these other ghastly profiles.
Greenviper: What the fuck, Prongs? Where have you been?
Prongs: :D
“Of course,” Harry said. “There are clean towels on the shelf.” Draco gave a curt nod and left the room. Harry gaped at Ginny.
Harry: Love you too, weirdo!
Greenviper: Your underlined bits in particular. They’ve proved to be very explicative.
Harry: Excellent hypothesis, Hermione, there’s only one thing wrong with it. Malfoy’s straight.
Harry laughed. Teddy zoomed around the living room chanting a chorus of “He gets to stay, Cousin came to play” and Draco made a futile attempt to conceal his smile a final time before giving in. It was the first time Harry had ever seen him look this happy and it was peculiar because it didn’t really suit his face. Draco was all angles and beautifully sculpted lines but Michelangelo’s David was made to peer, pensively, into the distance not be charmed beyond restraint by angelic five year olds. Joy made Draco’s mouth much too big for his face and his nose scrunched up in the middle, creating waves of wrinkles beneath his eyes. Harry had never found him more attractive.
Prongs: Dinner with you, I suppose. This is exciting! I feel like you should be more excited.
Ginny: Nott? As in Theo? No, he’s not. Harry’s standing right next to you.
Harry: Cheeky little -
“Huh?” Harry said, absorbed in the selection process.
“What are you on about?” Harry asked, confusedly. “I would have thought it obvious I’d spend time with – “
There’s a lot of them.
A flavor I’m all too familiar with.
Greenviper: That’s it, Prongs. Talk dirty to me.
Prongs: Hmm… 1. Secret 2. Male 3. Uh huh
“They can’t see us,” Malfoy said impatiently before distributing a line of playful bites down Harry’s neck. Harry whimpered, finally,
Ron: Eh… I know now.
“Me?” Malfoy gesticulated with a flourish. “Are you put out, Potter, because I sound like…myself?” Harry felt an amused smile quirk at his lips before he could stop himself.
“But I think the more important bit,” Harry began.
Harry: I had a really good time tonight.
Harry interrupted Draco with an impatient look.
Ron: Well could you stop NOT doing it at dinner? You know Mum hates them at the table.  I think she’d ban them from the whole house if George hadn’t invented them.
“Trying to rewrite the past, Potter?” Malfoy said, a slight waver in his voice.
Draco: Potter?
Harry: He can’t be any younger than us if he was a Death Eater at the time of the war, can he? And he was pretty familiar with who Hannah Abbott was on my birthday. I assume he’s a gay Slytherin in our year or the year above.
Harry: EW EW EW no no no no no no! My eyes!
Ginny: Hi, nice to meet you. I’m Ginny Weasley, your former basket!
Harry: I think you were right…
Teddy: *Chanting * “Cinna sticks and brownies! Cinna sticks and – “
Draco: It’s about time.
Harry: Merlin help me, that pout. Adorable.
Harry: Killer of foes, dies a ho.
Hermione: You asked me not to, so I haven’t. Not even Ron. Though, I will say again that I don’t think anyone would judge you.
Hey, quick Q if you’ve got an A.
Harry: Pardon?
‘Sir’ would be better.
Harry: So you’ve told me.
He didn’t know. He didn’t know much of anything at the moment, thank the heavens for his elevated pulse, because despite the artery’s immense pain at present, it gave Harry the knowledge that his heart must still be beating.
“Oh,” Harry breathed, when Draco’s tongue slid inside his ear.
“I’m familiar,” Draco said, finally picking up on tone.
Draco: "Good, because I just got to your place."
Prongs: LOL Fine, Dad!
to be an impossibility. Malfoy was the unfortunately attractive bloke you wanked over, then hoped to never think of again. He was the pitiable arsehole you couldn’t help but save. He was the reformed childhood bully you made strained small talk with when there was no polite escape. He was certainly not the wizard that made your chest swell at every message, the man that gave you hope for a future previously perceived as improbable; he wasn’t Hydra.
Harry: Oh, I get it now!
Harry: "What does it do?"
‘You are what you look like.’ ~ Me
Hermione: I knew I liked that boy.
Theo: You ought to be scared. Care to take the gamble, eh Potter?
Explanation: Woosh, ok so mental health is a struggle! For me it tends to be a bigger struggle during big changes in my life, no matter how good those changes are. I was cast in a 4 month acting tour, an incredible career-changing experience, but it did require me to move away from and be isolated from a lot of my family and friends and those people are my rock! As you can probably guess, things were not great for me at the beginning of the tour. But life is about adapting and learning and so I adapted and learned how to use skype! I also cultivated a new sort of comfort family where I was and I owe them everything! Long story made a bit shorter, I valued forming those relationships and keeping in contact with my estranged family over fandom. I was still connected as a reader but I didn't have it in me to write the final chapter until now. And frankly it would have been BAD had I tried to.
Harry: Give it to Ron and we have a deal.
Hermione: Are we sure about that? I always got a vibe.
“My song wasn’t to your liking?” Harry said.
Neville: Hey, could you try and get through to the Casting Castles’ people? They’ve had me on hold the past two days.
Greenviper: The Dom in you is going to hate that in the morning.

Patientpuff: hsp
Mr. Brewer: "I thought it was my dream."
Greenviper: God, that’s cute. Keep going.
Prongs: Hydra…
Prongs: Definitely! Ttyl
How many hits does that profile get a day?
“That’s right,” Harry agreed and made sure to smile at Teddy in a way that let him know that Harry was, in fact, the lucky one.
Ron: To your left, by the founders ice sculpture.
Harry: How’s the thawing going, Nev?
Draco: Yes. Why?
Ginny: "Shit. Sorry."
Prongs: Don’t you mean disappointed. ;)
“Ferret,” Harry said in answer, the volatile word out of his mouth before he could think to stop it. Draco hissed, the hand he used to pet at Harry, choking him so fast Harry barely had time to laugh – barely. Draco tightened his hold on him and Harry gasped for breath, the beginning tingles of submission bathing him in its warmth.
George: You’re one to talk.
“Well, isn’t this domestic?”
Harry: The only person worth talking to stopped messaging me.
Harry: Blow job says he won’t last two.
Harry: Merlin, what am I about to walk in on?
Harry: I was just going to ask Pansy when I dropped Ginny off tonight.
Harry: "You’re hopeless."
Greenviper: Grab tight to your hair. Frustrated. Desperate.
“Draco –“Harry begged, “please,” he let his head fall on the counter, “I can’t…I’m too close.”
Draco: *Strained and determined* "I coat a finger in lube and bring it back and forth against your rim. AH Ah Aa-and around the circumference."
Harry: Oh ok, I like it.
Ron: Deal.
Ginny: I’m on my way to pick up my favorite demon
Harry: Ha Ha
Harry: Probably. Your Dad’s obsessed, though!
Prongs: WOW!
Hermione: No, last time you'd just broken his heart and the time before that, well, he had you, didn’t he?
Harry: She’s going to kill you.
His hand picked up speed, giving long, tight pumps as he thought about how many times he’d fantasized about this; hard and wet in the showers after a match against Slytherin, late nights in a tent in the middle of a war, at a meeting, reading a flirtatious message from Hydra. Draco was wrong. Harry never needed to view this new version of Draco separately from Hydra or the git he went to school with, he just needed to combine the love he already had for all three of them.
Greenviper: See, now you’ve ruined it.
Harry: Honey, I’m home.
Ginny: Manners. Please.
Prongs: … Sorry I’m not attached to my Spellular. I DO have a life outside of this bloody dating app.
Ginny: Yes!!! He’ll let us peg him!
Prongs: You are getting way too much joy out of this.
Greenviper: It feels like I’m not going to last very long.
Are you going?
Draco: “Fine, then these
Harry: Wouldn’t dream of it.
Greenviper: So you shag witches?
Luna: I’ll check the forbidden forest.
Ginny: No thanks to you!
I’m picking up Teddy from Wiz-Kid when I get off work at 5.
Ron: We’re really sorry, mate.
“I’m-m s-s-sorry,” Teddy stammered out. Draco looked at Harry like he had three heads.
Ginny: We figured.
Harry: Mrs. Weasley…
“Mmm,” Draco mused, “I think maybe you and that cousin of yours have more in common than you think.” He nibbled playfully at Harry’s ear.
Greenviper: Fuck…that was… Christ.
Harry: I know. Neeeeeev, all the students are going to hate me!
Sneeky*
Ginny: Aww! You chose Prongs as your screenname? Creepy but sweet.
Prongs: Do you disapprove?
Neville: I know.
Draco: You’re useless.
Prongs: How big of you.
Ginny: Obviously!
Harry: “Err, I’m really sorry! Could I add an order of cinnamon sticks and the double chocolate chip brownies”
McGonagall: I think the first TWO weeks of evening patrols will suffice, don’t you?
Draco: I see you’ve named yourself “Harry Hotter.”
Harry: Hello Ginny, how was your day? Mine was lovely thanks for asking.
Draco: *Concerned* "Harry."
“Salazar, Potter, put your wand down!” Draco Malfoy said, looking gobsmacked.  He stood, stiff as a wand handle, in Harry’s fireplace, his hands raised above his head like a criminal.
Follow up, how did I get so lucky?
“Have you brought a notepad, Potter,” Draco went on with enthusiasm, “because this part may be of some interest to you.” Harry would be willing to bet his Firebolt it  wouldn’t be, but he nodded along all the same because the other wizard’s passion for the subject was nothing short of adorable. “It’s simplest just to keep in mind the six “s’s’” of wine tasting: See, Swirl, Smell, Sip, the option to Spit or Swallow and Savor.” Harry snorted, barely contained, laughter bursting from chest.
Draco: *Laughing*
Draco: I loathe you!
Prongs: You already paid the bar tab.
Harry gasped, whether from the insult or Draco’s tongue, he would never know.
Prongs: Is ‘Armani’ supposed to mean something to me?
Ron: I call your broomstick.
Ron: THAT BEST BE TONIGHT!
Harry: Am I really? Because Kreacher was doing me a favor today and I asked him to pick up those caramel cauldron cakes from Madam Puddifoot’s you love so much.
Prongs: You liked that, huh?
Harry: "It really does! I’m kind of freaking out on this end."
“Good example, Gin,” Harry griped, taking the fluffy weapon out of her hand.
Harry felt the cool sensation of a cleaning charm move through him.
Harry: So what if you’re young. I don’t know any two people that are more ready. You’re practically married as is, if you waited any longer you’d just be biding time. Not to mention you are the most prepared and logical person potentially on the planet. I don’t think you could have left the store with that ring if you didn’t know it was right.
Greenviper: I’m sitting in this adorable muggle café reading one of your books and I made myself a new acquaintance.  ‘This Bridge Called My Back’ is one of my waiter’s favorite books on the subject.
Harry: I mean, I thought we really had something but I know how to surrender when the game is won.
Draco: So you have me in the corner, what do you do next?
Harry smiled, a bit more confident than he had been just five minutes ago. He was genuinely in awe of how cordial, if a bit stilted, their conversation was going. Harry couldn’t recall one time they’d ever been this civil to one another. Well, other than on Howlr, of course, but that hardly counted.
Ginny: Harry, why are you blushing?
Prongs: I think so.
Draco: Give me something that will help me win her over?
Greenviper: Wonderful. I’ll see you then.
Harry: Nope.
Hermione: "I don’t know many other witches with the last name ‘Ganger’, as I’m sure you’ll find there’s but one Wizard left with the last name ‘Potter.’ But in case you’ve forgotten, he defeated Voldemort. It is him you’ve been dodging the past two days."
Greenviper: I just wanted to see how long I could make you sweat.
Greenviper: You’re the one who gave me access to your most secret desires.
Ron: Why are you staring at your spellular like it sprouted wings?
Harry: Fine!
Ron: Ask him out then.
Harry: Draco Malfoy used the phrase “rocked his socks off?”
“Course! Quidditch is THE BEST,” Teddy said enthusiastically, “but I want to be a seeker like Dad.”
Harry: Fair... but Parkinson? You fight constantly and break up every three months.
Harry: Is Blaise fucking Draco’s Mum?
Harry: Yup. Got it.
Greenviper: Fine. I’ll play, but you go first.
Greenviper: Mature as ever.
All these pieces are by designers that draw inspiration from popular muggle designers. I know that’s important to you.
Greenviper: I do not.
McGonagall: "Don’t sound so surprised, Mr. Potter. I have rebuilt a school from rubble, you’ll find I’m more than capable of operating a mobile spell phone."
Theo: I’m not sure what possessed you to come over to me tonight, Harry. I can’t even remember us having one conversation in school. I’m glad you did, though.
Neville: Come on, Harry. I can’t mess this one up.
Harry: Yeah
Prongs: Thrust into you hard and deep.
Dean: I’ll come get him.
Hermione: Thank you, thank you. First, I’d like to thank boarding school and unresolved sexual tension.
Fucking hell, leave it to Malfoy to make Harry forget the most important person in his life with a wink and a smirk. Shit.
Harry: "Course. I’m pretty open with him about most things. Not to mention, his Dad was bi so… I don’t know. It just seemed important to talk about it early. His gran wasn’t too keen, mind."
Greenviper: Why would your idiocy make me feel better?
Harry: I hope you’re talking about his face.
Harry: Oh it’s extremely important to me, Daddy.
Harry: Parkinson ;)
Ginny: Whatever. What’re you, the only one’s allowed to be a hatstall or something?
Harry: *Amused* “No”
Hermione:  *Copy and pastes to chat* I apologize for his lack of tact. We’re working on it.
Neville: WOW. Did Harry Potter just make a Voldemort joke?
Hermione: Oh, Harry.
Harry: Hermione’s a clever witch, I’m sure she worked that out ages ago.
Greenviper: He said you were mean.
reached Harry’s arse, he pulled one buttock open with one hand and ran a finger down his crease with the other. The finger circled his pucker once, then twice. Harry pushed back against the contact, but then it disappeared altogether.  The sound Harry produced was nothing short of animalistic.
Ginny: Look at this great shot I got last night:
Teddy: “Idiot.”
Greenviper: I thought you might. You have a terrible sense of humor and tend to gravitate toward the lowest hanging fruit.
Harry: Lying wasn’t part of the deal!
Prongs: Ok, here goes. Sorry Parkinson.
“Draco,” Harry warned, leaning into the assault on his neck and wantonly rubbing himself against the front of Draco’s trousers. The argument for why Draco should stop was lost to the world as Harry looked back to discover heat in the other man’s eyes. The wanting he’d felt all week, tugged at him deep in his abdomen.
Harry: Did you and Parkinson have another fight? Did Luna stand you up for Rolf again? Did you only score 50 points in the match as opposed to your usual 3000 again? OH, oh, oh did your Mum introduce your gf as your roommate…again? Forgive me if I’m less than shocked by your continuous cycle drama.
Draco kissed at Harry’s hole. He sucked, slurped and breathed into it, making Harry wet, desperate and begging for it.
Ginny: What?!?! Really? Finally! Damn it Harry this better be about what I hope it's about because if it isn’t I will throttle you.
Dean: You have my word.
told you to watch your language."
“Of course not!” Harry’s voice was firm and unwavering. Malfoy recoiled as if stung. Harry didn’t see what on earth he had to be upset about. He was the one who had lied!
Greenviper: Try to be cute. I’m having a crisis.
Hermione: You’re not fine, Harry, and I think you know that. I really wish you would let us help you.
Draco: Good to know.
on my fingers or the image of you doing this to yourself at home."
Prongs: Desperate… You’re right, it’s a good fantasy.
Draco: Potter.
Harry: Go back to sleep.
Draco: Certainly. You teased me too much and now I can’t stop thinking about it.
Greenviper: Shan’t.
TheRealGing: You’re dead, Potter.
Ginny: Says the man, literally destined to do what no other could before him.
Ginny: Off with you!
Prongs: Just a convenient time to put down your spell phone, that’s all.
“Draco no!” Harry cut him off, forgoing the whiplash-inducing head turn and whirling around completely to intercept his godson.
Harry: Ha. Right?
Welcome back Harry!
Prongs: She asked her ex-boyfriend, a mutual friend, to seduce me a week after we broke up.
Ron: Right, I’ve been blocking it out.
Prongs: Good boy.
Harry: Wtf, Gin. How do you even know that?
Greenviper: Does this mean you’re done pouting?
Draco pulled back, Harry followed, mouth watering, like a Crup being deprived of his treat. Draco tightened the hand that held Harry’s jaw and turned him to face his burnt and forgotten breakfast. Harry did a quick wandless spell to turn off stove and waited.
Prongs: You’re not a stranger.
Harry: "This is the sound of me listening."
Screenname: TheRealGing
I’ve had Teddy for the weekend loads of times. Everything will be fine!
Ron: Did so. I was going to tell you so too when you came out to us but Hermione said it’d be ‘insensitive to your journey’ or some rubbish like that.
Pansy: Fine.
“I shouldn’t,” Draco began, looking to Harry cautiously.
Greenviper: In any case, it’s obvious to anyone with an IQ greater than 95 where I stand in this. I would not be trying this hard if I weren’t interested.  I generally needn’t put in any effort at all.
Green
Reviews and love are always welcome! It's been great getting to know some of you that have reached out to me on Tumblr. Remember, if you're having a bad day our favorite snarky boys are always here to give you a laugh!
Ron: Just stop it, the both of you. This is not about us!
Neville: I covered for you.  Hope you’re not dead somewhere. HA HA
Greenviper: I’m intrigued.
Harry: Ha. Ha.
Dean: I was actually wondering if I could bring Seamus to your party tomorrow night?
Ron: ‘I was barking, is what I was! Missing a fair few ingredients in the old potion.’
Prongs: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
A bitter, guilty, part of Harry wanted to point out that perhaps he could better understand pureblood prejudice aimed at  children if he hadn’t been so busy dolling it out, but instead he said –
Prongs: I just walked in on my best friends having sex in my living room.
Prongs: Oh God.
Ron: Just figured it out about an hour ago.
“Bend over. Hands flat on the counter,” Draco commanded, sounding pissed. Harry couldn’t spread his legs fast enough. “If you so much as lift a pinky, I won’t let you come.”
Ron: ‘Fuck off, yeah!’
Greenviper: The earpiece is a Wheezes product. It lets us talk to each other as if it were a spell phone call except it alters the sound of our voices in case we know each other. I'm pretty sure it's intended for prank calls but I thought it could serve us just as well.
Hermione: "Harry?"
Ron: Damn. I might cry.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled before jumping in again. “Sweet pea, keeper of my soul.” His eyes didn’t leave Draco’s. “I know sometimes I’m out of control.”
Mr. Brewer: "Thanks, Ms. Granger"
“You’re not supposed to interr –“
Harry: How could I be? That paragraph was one of the nicest things anyone’s ever said to me…and to think, it came from you. Shall I search the skies for flying Skrewts?
“Right,” he said like he’d expected Harry’s answer, “you want to fuck the Malfoy you knew in school, maybe even Hydra from Howlr. When you want, Draco,
Greenviper: Christ.
Harry: No, it’s fine. I can get him. It’s no problem.
Greenviper: What gave you that idea? Because we chat on this app? Can you honestly tell me you haven’t pulled anyone else since we started talking?
Ron: I know it was… I just really appreciate it.
Harry: ‘Congratulations, mate! This is such a shock. I’m gobsmacked .’
“I’m meeting someone at the bar,” Harry told the dark haired woman standing at the hostess stand. She gave him a quick, approving, once-over and pointed him in the direction of the bar located against the back wall.
Harry: My cake needs to come out the oven. Could you just come in and meet me in the kitchen?
“I don’t really know what that word means,” Teddy confessed, past looking ashamed of himself, “ ‘sides I’ve never had a cousin before.” Draco stared at the boy, the corners of his mouth twitching with the effort not to smile.
“So what’ll it be, Ted?” Harry said, hours past the metamorphs bedtime. Harry couldn’t be blamed, of course, if Draco hadn’t shown up with his unending insistence that Harry give Teddy everything he wanted, he would have been in bed at the proper time. But as it were, Harry had agreed to two desserts, multiple games of exploding snap and a promise to take Teddy and Draco on Sirius’ old motorbike over winter vacation.
Harry: *Laughing* ‘So tell me, how does it feel to be an engaged man?’
Hermione: There’s a storm a coming!
Ginny: You know what would solve everything, if Harry/Prongs told Hydra who the fuck he was!
Harry: Did he tell you the number of shits I took today too?
Greenviper: Oh how I was hoping for a message like this!
Harry: *Laughing * "Bugger off."
Greenviper: Salazar, the ego. I didn’t orchestrate this plan to torture you! I don’t have those beliefs anymore. I haven’t for a long time, since before the battle. But he wasn’t exactly the kind of wizard you turned your back on, though, was he? We can’t all be as brave as you Gryffindors.
Harry: Mind message? I can’t hear you over the music.
Harry:
Greenviper: Call it a hunch.
Ginny: Harry Potter, you get me.
Thank you for all of the REVIEWS AND LOVE! I love seeing what you all think and it makes me feel eternally fluffy!
Harry: Draco.
Harry: Yeah, I’ll be sure to do that in all my free time today.
I’m k.
“No,” Harry said, stammering so much this time he scarcely convinced himself. But what Malfoy was saying was ridiculous. It could not be true. Harry didn’t know who Hydra was? He had wanted to know so badly at every step, didn’t he? It had kept him up at night. But then again, Harry spoke Parseltongue without realizing it wasn’t English. He’d spent years letting certain images of blonde pop up in his dreams and had managed to convince himself he was straight.
“Deal,” Harry said, thankfully, letting his gaze linger on the other wizard. He tried to imagine the boy he’d known at Hogwarts being this considerate. He tried to imagine that same boy waiting patiently in Godric’s Hollow for Harry to present himself a month ago. The images didn’t seem to compute in his brain.
Neville: I keep telling her.
Harry: I bet
Greenviper: I hate myself for it. I know it’s partially my fault but I meant what I said last week. The war really messed me up too.
Prongs: Before things go TOO FAR? What the fuck, Hydra? We’ve been talking for months! Where are you? Because, personally, I’m in pretty damn ‘far.’
“Stop that,” Harry burst, then remembered himself. Malfoy removed the canary grin from his face and traded it in for a more guarded expression. Harry watched the fingers of his left hand curl into a tense fist.
Greenviper: Well any sane person marries, Granger.
“What would you have me do, Malfoy?” Harry asked, half wanting the answer. “Obliviate myself? Forget about all the years you spent walking around like the biggest twat in recorded history.” A muscle in Malfoy’s jaw twitched and Harry knew from many a spar with the other man that that was never a good sign. It was odd though, nostalgia caressed Harry’s temper, giving him the impulse to push his school rival further still.
Ginny: Wrong answer, Potter!
Prongs: Oh My God.
Harry: Hey, I know how you feel about him and I don’t want to get into another fight but I think things are going really well tonight!
Greenviper: Longest relationship?
Harry: As long as that’s not how YOU feel then everything’s fucking brill.
Liked the sound of that, did you?
Ooh it just got better, “back in my day, they did all the shirt lifting in private and disease took care of it eventually.”
Draco: "So sure about things you know nothing about or have no definitive proof of."
Arthur: For science.
“Bye Dad!” Teddy called as Ginny cradled him out of the room.
Draco: "That’s cute. What are you doing exactly?"
Harry: True.
Harry: That’s your word of encouragement – ‘yeah?’
Prongs: I do.
Harry: "It’s in."
Neville: So, how much trouble are you in with McGonagall?
Harry: Should have sooner, I think.
“May I use your shower, Potter,” Draco clipped out. “I have an interview this morning I need to prepare for.” Harry looked from Ginny to Draco then back again, utterly bewildered.
“I presume you’ll be moving to Scotland full time?” Malfoy played absently with the scraps left on his plate.
Harry: "I sound cute."
Harry: Hey.
Hermione: I know. It’s kind of cute, right?
Greenviper: I’d rather not discuss it.
Prongs: Tell me the truth.
Hermione: "You are the manager of the band, are you not?"
Draco: "OH MY GOD! It slides in, a brilliant kind of resistance."
Greenviper: Where is he?
Greenviper: At least I’ll have a friend.
Draco: Did you ask my aunt and cousin not to come tonight so you wouldn’t have to introduce me to him.
Pansy: In so many words.
Hermione: "No, Mr. Brewer, I’m Flooing in regard to the Hogwarts Ball your clients are scheduled to play at tomorrow."
Prongs: I’m going to change your name to Sass Queen.
Harry: FUCK! I’m working. You can’t tease me all week, then send me a picture like that!
Harry: "Yes –  please! I’m begging you, fuck me open! Hard and messy. I want to feel you. I want to know you’re doing the same thing to yourself."
Greenviper: WOW
Prongs: Go into Burberry, a bloke like you knows where that is.
Greenviper: Where are you? Get back here so I can hit you.
Greenviper: You’re a sap.

Draco made an approving sound, squeezing at the buttock he’d just marked. Harry groaned encouragingly.
“You’re a bit of a distraction,” Harry stated. He took a deep breath and decided to do as he was told anyway. He picked up his small pot of clarified butter and began spooning the thin layer of milk fat off the top and placing it into a separate bowl. Needless to say it was a very un-sexy process, a saving grace to Harry if there was any hope of him finishing breakfast.
Hermione: Neither would skinning your hide, Harry, but you don’t exactly fancy the sound of it, do you?
“But you never got breakfast,” Harry protested. Draco smirked.
Harry: Fine, fight forever, use it as foreplay, I don’t give a fuck, but you’re right pissed at one another and yet you still can’t spend one bloody night a part! What does that tell you?
Harry: No curses either.
Harry: "No, that part’s been made abundantly clear."
Draco: So I’ll see you at 9.
Greenviper: ???
My Beta's bril and I love her...Like a lot!
Harry: I think Hydra is cheating on me with me.
You don’t have to wake up from a nightmare, alone, and wishing it were real because MAYBE then at least it’d be over.
Harry: You don’t have to do that.
Voice panicked* "You did?"
Nvm, it’s in the bag.
Harry: A blowy?
Draco: “Oh, well that wasn’t my intention.”
Harry: Tomorrow night.
Prongs: I’m sorry, how could I not know your house? You must think I’m really dumb.
Ron: Yeah, you’ve been in and out since yesterday.
Prongs: My mates keep buying me shots
Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up to the top of his forehead with disapproval but he didn’t say another word.
Greenviper: She doesn’t like it when you do that.
Hermione: That’s fast.
Ron: And he fits, doesn’t he? Pretentious, clever, old wizarding family.
Greenviper: Funny you ask, Prongs. As it turns, we have to work around the Azkaban visitation schedule.
Hermione: Ronald…
Harry: There’s a good lad.

Harry: I’m out.
Patientpuff: I want to cum on your toes and lick them all clean.
Neville:
Say hi to me: http://partialtopotter.tumblr.com/
Greenviper: Let’s get this over with sooner rather than later, I think. What are your plans for tomorrow evening?
When the waiter brought the (off-menu) wine Malfoy had selected, Harry watched, amusedly, as the blond did all sorts of very strange and technical things to the glass presented him. Harry made the mistake of inquiring about such behavior and ended up in a fifteen-minute lecture on the “art of wine tasting.”
Harry: Fine, deal.
Harry: Thank you guys. I’m really embarrassed. I’m not sure what to say other than thank you for caring.
Harry: Don’t tease.  Why the hell were you near Immobile Mushrooms in the first place?
Harry: "Holy…Fuck, I-I can feel you. I-it’s like you’re really here."
Harry: Had to. If anyone else did it would be inappropriate.
Ginny: "Oh yeah, I called to make sure we were on the same page about the annual camping trip. Luna and Rolf are convinced we need to get to the site at FIVE AM to see the plimpies."
Prongs: I’ve been nothing but kind to you.
Ginny: It’s nothing you’ve done per say, but we do need to talk about it.
Draco: Can you really afford to be ignorant about yet another word in the English language?
Harry: Please Parkinson, I need them for tomorrow!
Harry: Piss off
Harry: Ha. Good one!
Harry: I’m not late! I’m at the restaurant but I had to use the toilet.
Harry: “Ok.”
Cho: “Will that be all, Sir?”
Harry: "Guh! For the last time, I wasn’t hitting on you."
“Potter,” Draco cleared his throat. He dusted the floo powder off his fitted blue trousers and grey button down. “I should have texted first.”
Greenviper: ‘For the love of all that’s filthy, please just fuck me.’
Prongs: Have you stopped teasing?
Draco: "HUH YES! Yes yes yes yes. Feels so. I’m touch – CHRIST!"
Harry: I’m sure I will.
Ron: Why THE FUCK do you even have his number?
Hermione: Keep us updated.
Draco: 'Please, not even close. But fuck it! I’m lubing up the dildo. Do you feel it in your hands? The smooth head slick and ready."
Greenviper: Other than you?
Harry: …
Hermione: "It is never too late to find your dream, Mr. Brewer, but you have to go looking for it."
Prongs: Pour yourself a couple fingers of Ogden’s. Have a drink with me.
Harry: One can only walk in on their mates shagging so many times before it causes permanent neurological damage.
Ginny: And I’m really drunk
Hermione: He’s a Slytherin, he took the dark mark, he was brainwashed by his family, regrets his actions and, Harry, it was him you said you saw in Godric’s not Pansy.
Greenviper: What a development, Mr. Prongs.
Harry: *Startled yelp*
Harry: Fine. Be quick about it.
Draco: "I-I alternate pinching them as’ *Whines* ‘hard as I can with rolling circles gently at the tip. How does it feel?"
Prongs: Very nice, Hydra.
“I knew you’d understand!”
Harry: Because, lucky for you, I have a habit of giving spoiled prats second chances!
Greenviper: Indubitably.
Ginny: MSG. OTHER. PEOPLE. ON. HOWLR.
Harry: Harsh.
Greenviper: What does that even mean?
“Now it’s my turn to sing,” Teddy informed Draco. “Sweet pea, what’s all-uh – dis about?” Harry chuckled. There were few things in this world that he enjoyed more than watching Teddy do his earnest interpretation of a jazz singer. He closed his eyes and tried his best to snap his little fingers.
you to shut up!”
Prongs: Ha. I bet you’re cute when you’re this pissy.
Harry: "Right."
Ginny: You’re paranoid.
Harry: Definitely clothes.
Prongs: You know, I don’t think I do?
Dessert, Harry was pleased to find, was indisputably Malfoy’s favorite part of the meal. Harry recalled from Hogwarts that Malfoy had a rather large sweet tooth but after two hardy courses, he was beginning to wonder where his former rival kept it all. For Malfoy had not only eaten his entire slice of molten chocolate lava cake (which he proclaimed was ‘better than sex’) but also helped himself to a good portion of Harry’s salted  caramel pudding.
McGonagall: Oh, very well, go on.
“I keep thinking about the bad wolf inside me,” he admitted. He was at the point of exhaustion where all his words started to slur together. He climbed up onto the top of the bed, chose a place he liked in the middle and closed his eyes without preamble.
Harry: Why has my four poster been transfigured into a bunk bed?
Prongs: I wasn’t too invested anyway. He wasn’t really my type.
Draco: Would you like me to take you with me?
Lavender: "It’s not just
Prongs: You have a nice face, Malfoy.
Harry: Merlin, not again.
Welcome back Harry!
Greenviper: I’ll be ‘thrilled’ if this works. Until then, you’ll not find me counting any dragon eggs.
Greenviper: Don’t make me turn that train around, Potter. It’s only due to my immeasurable generosity that I allowed you to get on it in the first place.
Prongs: ‘You know I can’t say no when you’re like this.’
Draco: A relief to us all.
Harry: Merlin, what do you need me to do?
Harry: Witch Weekly just asked if I was a top or a bottom…
Harry: Fair … Paternal trauma, crippling depression – we have so much in common, babe!
“Aunty Ginny!” Teddy said at the same time as Harry’s mind had supplied the answer.  This was a common occurrence with Ginevra Weasley. Every time Teddy spent so much as five minutes with the witch he picked up the most ridiculous phrases. Andromeda does not thank Harry for it.
Greenviper: And I’d shag the living daylights out of, Potter. But he looks like he’d give a good buggering too though, doesn’t he?
Harry: Oi, my story!
Harry: Ginny always was loud.
TheRealGing: Hey sexy! ;)
” She was saying his name in that awful way Harry used to to say it; hearing it come from someone else was worse – way worse!
Harry: No sneering at the décor, turning your nose up at the clothes or connecting their freckles to make dirty pictures on their faces.
Harry: If someone tried to read back our texts, they wouldn’t understand a word.
“He looks like you,” said Draco.
Harry: I’ve already taken the liberty of transporting your belongings to your old house. Anyway, we needed to rip off the plaster sometime. I move to Hogwarts next week.
Prongs: Then it won’t be an issue.
Greenviper:  I bet.
“You’re perfect,” Draco said as he spread Harry open and pressed the tip of his tongue forward and into Harry. Harry’s toes curled and his back spasmed.
Prongs: I didn’t think I was.
Hermione: If you’re sure.
Harry: Draco.
Option one.
Harry: Can’t chat long but 500 points to Hermione!
Neville: He’s not wrong.
Draco: “You have
Greenviper: Good. I’m glad that’s cleared up.
Greenviper: What’s on the menu this evening?
Hermione: Stop texting. I feel left out.
Greenviper: *Sigh* There was a Wizard named Nicholas, if that’s what you’re asking? He was arrested in 1823 for his blatant disregard for the statute of secrecy and died in Azkaban 10 years later.
Katie: Harry no!
Neville: Just the toes left now.
Hermione: That’s right, we miss you! We had some work to catch up on but we’ll see you tonight.
Prongs: One holding you steady as the other slowly slipped inside you. One finger at time.
Harry: Try to be subtler. Ron’s going to have a panic attack before the weeks out.
Harry: TMI and why is that a bad thing?
Greenviper: You talk about ME acting superior?  Why don’t you take a dip in a pensieve.
“Fuck,fuck,fuck, fuck” Harry cursed. He turned his head around to see what the other man looked like.
Ron: Oh no…
Blaise: I heard brunch was a success. Narcissa was very pleased.
Harry: You’re delightful.
“Then why are you smiling?” Harry asked, with a grin.
Prongs: Agreed.
“Fuck you, Potter!” He stood up, straightening his slacks in the process. This struck Harry as very odd. Why Malfoy cared if his pants wrinkled at a time like this, was absolutely lost him. It was almost funny and when combined with the absurdity of the evening, Harry was left with the inapropriate task of stamping down a laugh.
“I know I’ve been holding out on you, but I thought you could at least handle a week.”
“Accio ukulele,” Harry begrudgingly incanted. Draco cupped his hands over his mouth.
Greenviper: Too late.
Prongs: I thought so.
Arthur: On my toaster’s life, I won’t use them on the ghoul.
“If you can’t take this,” Draco said, sounding on top of the world now that he’d finally gained the upper hand, “how do you ever expect to take my cock.”  Harry let out a frustrated growl around the towel.
Ron: Fuck off! No way.
Greenviper: Shit.
Harry: You think?
Greenviper: Please do not apologize to me.
Pansy: I’ve pulled three looks for you for the ball tomorrow.  I need you to select one and I’ll take care of the rest.
Harry: "Making dinn – "
It’s an inside joke, you would have had to be there.”
Hermione: SEE, I TOLD YOU I HEARD A DOOR OPEN!
Greenviper: We can’t all be as virtuous as you, Lion Spawn.
Doesn’t it look delicious?
Draco: "Your nipples are hard and erect and tempting but I don’t touch them quite yet."
He let saliva collect in his mouth, wetting the towel so more could  fit. He took several deep, steadying, breaths in through his nose then bucked his head up as a signal to let Draco know he was ready for more. The blonde gave Harry a measured look, pupils blown wide. For a split second Harry saw a flicker of awe in his eyes and had the ridiculous urge to purr like a cat receiving praise from his master.
“We’ll be leaving too, I’m afraid,” Ginny said, suddenly suspiciously in a rush. “Enjoy the rest of your morning.”
Neville: Of course, we’ve been Flooing back and forth for the past two years but…
Ginny: Don’t be offended.
Prongs: I’m going up the pub with some of my mates…Sorry.
Millicent: "Sure."
Harry: I know, Gin. I’m really, really sorry.
Harry: Yes, sir.
“What – “
Millicent: "I already did this with, Longbottom. If you just wanted an excuse to call – "
“I didn’t know you could play an instrument,” Draco commented as they reached the entrance to Harry’s bedroom. Harry tried to look around at it through Draco’s eyes, then regretted it immediately. Harry’s bedroom wasn’t up to Draco Malfoy’s standards on a good day which, of course, today was not. He and Teddy had been playing hide and seek earlier so there were pillows on the floor, his trunk half open, a partially-finished juice box creating a stain on his carpet and many small piles of clutter, for which Harry could not blame Teddy for.
Teddy and Draco:
Mr. Brewer: "If this is about the hotel in Brighton, I already talked to you all once. I don’t know nothing about it."
Does that take you back?
Greenviper: How long ago?
Greenviper: Exceeds expectations. How’d you know smirks were my specialty?
Prongs: No. Course not. I was prying. I really hate it when people ask me questions about it too.
Prongs: Sorry.
Put in the ear piece when you’re ready.
Harry, feeling rather brave for staying on his date with his childhood foe, was suddenly struck with the realization that he was going to have to be an active participant on this date with the aforementioned childhood foe. What on earth were they going to talk about? ‘Hey, still got those scars from when I almost killed you in a bathroom?’ ‘That’s right, my nose never did heal properly after you stepped directly onto my face, thanks for noticing.’
Prongs: :(
“Clever.”
Ron: That sure narrows it down… I swear, Slytherin house turns out more poofs than ancient Greece.
“There is no wolf inside you,” Harry soothed, rubbing the boys back. He looked up apologetically at Draco.
Prongs: Actually…
“I think she likes us,” Harry said, hoping to ease the tension.
Harry: Honeymoon phase? What’s that? Never heard of it.
But hit it, he did.
Harry: If he knew, he would have said something at the ball.
Me – “I don’t. Why don’t you tell me?”
“Astute observation, Potter,” Malfoy said flatly. He might have been about to say something else too but Harry would never know. Not that he particularly cared to know, mind, he was far too busy leaping on Malfoy.
Harry: She tried to give me over to Voldemort.
Draco: "Manners, Prongs."
Cho: “Are you still there?”
Ron: Hahahaha not the poshest lad in the room, is he?
Harry: Are you ok?
Harry: “Great.”
I’ll answer any question you want that won’t reveal who I am.
Prongs: Whinge away.
Draco tipped Harry’s head toward the ceiling, giving him full access to Harry’s neck. He used his other hand, fingers smooth and elegant, to pet at his throat. How fucking odd. How fucking odd that Harry was turned on by it. He gulped, feeling his Adam’s apple bob beneath Draco’s hand. Draco hummed appreciatively and Harry felt it throughout his entire body.
Hermione: You said to fix it.
Draco: 'How about this? You like it? Is. This. Fast. Enough. For. you? Are you going to come? OH FUCK!"
Prongs: Clearly. I can’t even talk to you right now.
Prongs: Ha. Not to my knowledge.
Ginny: Ok.
Harry: "Y-yes. Min – Mcgon – You have a Spellular?"
Prongs: Three Broomsticks
Draco latched onto the base of his prick, stopping him. “None of that,” he said. Harry growled.
Pansy: Sure, Potter. Then maybe you can join us in it.
Harry: ‘What’s wrong? It’s 3 in the morning. ‘
Prongs: I’d like to.
Greenviper: Should I be offended?
Neville: Who?
Ginny: I can’t believe I missed that!
Harry: Thanks for the outfit.
Harry: Godric, you’re cute when you’re cross.
Prongs: I know! He wouldn’t calm down until I took him home and laid down in bed with him.
Prongs: Come on, please don’t ignore me.
Harry: "Oh, um… A lot better, yeah."
Prongs: Huh?
Ron: She’s been acting cagey all week. We’re having sex a lot! Like, a lot a lot.
Pansy: I disagree. It will make that mop you call hair purposefully haphazard and it’s in line with that ruggedly handsome aesthetic you keep failing to achieve.
Harry: "We fry macaroni and cheese in the shape of miniature people and I charm them to walk around the table."
Harry: It’s noon. I waited until noon.
By the time the main course had arrived, Harry was in awe again of how easily they seemed to talk about their respective lives after Hogwarts. Draco told Harry he’d been studying for his potions mastery and would earn the title by Christmas. He wasn’t sure what he was going to do with it yet but made it a point to say that the idea of brewing St. Mungo’s hundreds of blood replenishing potions a day interested him about as much as an Avada to the heart.
I’m to bed. I have an early morning.
“It’s your day, Teddy,” Harry said but he was focusing on Draco. He needed to make sure he knew he wanted him there as much as Teddy did, more even.  “If that’s what you want, I’d really like him to stay too?”
Harry: I promised I’d go see my cousin’s horrible band play. Make it more tolerable?
Ginny: Bloody fucking fantastic! We Won!
I really need to thank @synonym4life this week because they beta'd the heck out of this chapter, even adding some brill lines of their own. How did I get so lucky? who knows? but I'm not going to question it!
Harry: Oh yeah.
It’s a Circe ordained miracle you got that boy to talk to you.
Harry: "Mean."
Harry: It’ll be ok, Ron. I’ll have an open floo, just for you. :)
Hermione: Look at that, Harry. Our babies are all grown up.
Literally.
Prongs: So you’ve said.
Ron: I know. He messages me non-stop!!!!
Draco: I’ll be wearing this:
Greenviper: You’re paranoid, Prongs.
Greenviper: You’re joking, yes?!
Hermione: Harry, no. You can’t possibly think that.
Prongs: It’s not exactly a common name?
“Where I
Greenviper: Yes, they’re a treat.
“Eloquent,” Malfoy said dryly.
Ginny: Of course not. But when we broke up, I lost my place in your life. You all never let me into your perfect little trio but at least while we were together, I had a reason to get some of your attention. You’re my best friend, Harry, and I was fine playing the role of the one that got away because it meant you still wanted me around.
Harry: “Huh?”
Greenviper: Send me a picture of your screen so I know you’ve done it.
Hermione: Good point, Gin.
Draco: I’m going to bed now.
Prongs: Trust me, I know better than anyone that you’re not the family you grew up with. It’s down to choices that show who we are.
I’m glad you told me about it.
Harry: Yeah… Teddy’s here so I’m just going to use him an excuse to stop responding now.
“Next week, as it turns out,” Harry said, keeping a careful eye on him.  “We have to get ourselves situated before the students turn up.” Noticing Malfoy’s expression hadn’t changed, Harry called upon Godric, Helga and whichever founders would help him, and took Malfoy’s hand across the table. Malfoy looked up at him, mask firmly in place.
Neville: A brilliant idea in theory: make them run the Hogwarts Express just for the two of us for unnecessary albeit extremely important, nostalgia reasons. Not so practical in practice, though, is it?
It is so dull, btw.
Ron: *Laughing, almost giggling* ‘Bloody hell, listen to me . I’m as bad as Lavender bleeding Brown. Fucking hell, Lavender, what a mistake that was. When I could have had, Hermione?’
Prongs: What a brilliant response.
Ginny: Did that by yourselves, did you?
Ginny: Accurate.
Greenviper: I don’t really have anything to say but I want to talk to you.
Greenviper: What?
, beautiful face. “It was easy to put Hydra’s personality on Nott, on anyone else, because he was a clean slate, so to speak. He and I don’t have the same messy history you and I do. I mean, when I look at Nott, it’s convenient to see him as Hydra. When I look at you, I just see –
Harry: *Labored breathing*
Arthur: I’m sorry Harry, but you need to hear it. Merlin knows you deserve to be happy, so if the Malfoy boy does that for you then we will, of course, welcome him. But you must know, not everyone’s thrilled at the idea.
Prongs: Don’t be disgusting.
Harry: "Nothing dearie, just making sure whatever story you’re about to tell lacks its usual… color."
Stay strong! Any second, Teddy will get bored of hiding and walk into the living room.  Finding his godfather half-hard and sexually frustrated in the hands of his estranged cousin was not on!
Harry: Yup.
Prongs: It really, really is.
Prongs: I’m on the train.
Harry: Yup.
Ron: Oh you don’t have to tell me, mate. Making fun of her that day in Charms was the best thing I’ve ever done. For both of us, I reckon. Imagine where we’d be without her?
“So,” Teddy began, “are you my Dad’s boyfriend?”
Greenviper: You’re killing me.
Patientpuff: Ur a sneaky little bloke aren’t you? With all ur secrets.
Lavender: Babe, I got you!
“Exactly,” Harry said, emotion a sticky, stuck, toffee in his throat. He made eye-contact with Draco on the other side of the bed, a world of screams and fear and riddukulus’d boggarts passing between them in their wordless conversation.
Greenviper: Stop texting me and go to sleep or the tooth fairy won’t come!
Ginny: Ungrateful arse!
Greenviper: Alright, then?
Lavender: "What do they think? That my staff’s going to roll it in on a neon bloody float or something? We are professionals, after all. We know how to be discreet."
Harry: I’d press you up against the cold, stone wall a bit harder than is strictly necessary. There’s sure to be a mark the next day but I kind of like the sound of that so I keep pushing, rolling my erection against yours. I look down and see the outline of your hardening cock through those maddening fucking trousers of yours. I sink to my knees and rub the leather surrounding your cock against my cheek. My mouth waters. The smell of the material mixed with your scent
Hermione: On the date. With Draco Malfoy?
Draco pressed in a bit further and Harry’s knees finally gave out. Chuckling, the other man wrapped his arm around Harry’s center to hold him up. He thrust all the way in.
xxx, PTP
Prongs: Seriously, thank you. I feel like sometimes we forget that.
Ginny: I think the wand you shoved up your bum got stuck and transfigured you into an arsehole.
“Right. It’s hard to say,” he continued on,” depending on the day they are evenly matched creatures. I’d say it’s a draw.”
Harry: Don’t worry, I’ll bring his potions practice set and leave him down stairs.
Mr. Weasley: Fascinating! The things these muggles come up with without magic.
Harry: So you’re free then?
“Sweet yolk,” he sang to the tune of ‘Sweet Pea’ as he worked on the hollandaise, “center of my-y egg.” He cracked an egg, separating the yolk. “Don’t know why,” did the same with two more, “and I don’t know when.” He took up his whisk and began rapidly stirring the yolks. “Beating’s the only way to – keep you – tasting good.”
I told him he was a genius and he responded, “Well, I know a lot of everything.”
Prongs: Yes! You’re totally gushing all over Mayfair right now.
Greenviper: Occupation?
Angry, almost shouting * “I lied, is that what you want me to say?”
Hermione: And Malfoy.
Hermione: We know!!!
Harry: Don’t go crazy.
Hermione: The other half of ‘MY party’ says ‘go crazy!’ ;)
Ron: You know that’s not how we feel at all, mate.
Neville: Where are you? You left me talking to Hannah 20 minutes ago and I’m terrified of running out of interesting things to say!
Harry: Oh.
Draco: "You are. So cute that I suggest skipping drinks all together."
Neville: No. Hannah’s been my eyes and ears since she arrived. She says everything’s perfect. Thanks Harry!
Harry: Hey, where are you guys?
Prongs: Oh, I see.
Harry: She does?!? :D
Greenviper: Charming.
Ron: Tell Hermione that since she proposed, she doesn’t get you as maid of honor too?
Greenviper: Oh, I’d drop you like a Snitch on fire. But I’m supposed to be the bastard.
You’re talking to a wizard.
Greenviper: You’re sensitive today.
“I – God just – “Harry craned his neck to look at Draco, for all the man’s bravado he did not look the picture of composure. His face was flushed, his lips parted and his eyes clenched with desire as he pushed his clothed prick into Harry’s arse. Harry smirked.
Greenviper: If you think for a second that I’m following you into the Muggle toilets, you are more deluded than Cuthbert Binns.
Hermione: Ronald!
Prongs: Oh My God, I can read the anxiety in your messages. I didn’t follow you. I’m in bloody Scotland.
Harry: Vikram’s in Auror training with me, he wasn’t involved with the Death Eaters at all.
Draco: First, I am loath to call this music. Second, I said, ‘this place is disgusting and the people are worse!’
“God, so lovely, so perfect,” Draco rambled. His hands trembled at Harry’s hips, “for me.”
Prongs: I know “Bae” is le-strange to you but it has me rowling on the fleur laughing.
Draco: "MMMM! Oooo-oh yeah, did I forget to mention it vibrates. I work it in and out. Feel yourself clamp down on it. L-let the vibration travel through your whole body."
Prongs: Woah, where did that come from?
Prongs: You definitely do!
Greenviper: I was a Death Eater.
Thank you.
, “Potter.” Draco spat, crowding his ear. “Or I’ll shut it for you.”
Harry: ‘She was
Hermione: I am not scared, Ronald. I am simply trying to keep a low profile.
Prongs: You’re doing this on purpose?
Greenviper: Worry not, dear Prongs. I could never seriously consider dating a muggle.
The question hit Harry like Petrificus Totalus, leaving him frozen and speechless under Malfoy’s gaze, though it felt like he had a thousand things to say. A million counter arguments must have been at the tip of his tongue and an infinite amount of objections were surely about to erupt from within him at any second. At any minute. Any five. Merlin, how long had he been silent?
“It’s a nice door.”  Harry said dumbly, pointing to the ornate black and gold pattern on it.
Neville: Who?
Hermione: "Good. Obviously only I can hear you because I’m calling their office’s main floo, so just hold tight."
Teddy looked like he had shrunk two inches and his mouth quivered into the most pitiful looking frown. Harry was not often cross with him so every time it happened, tears were likely to follow.
Ginny: Suck it up.
Prongs: Yup
Draco: See, this is the result of not giving it up on the first date.
who didn’t want to use the Floo network. It was for the good of the whole party! Do you know what soot does to lacewing silk?"
You aren’t the only one who does it. No one in the family takes Pansy and my relationship seriously and it really pisses me off. It was the same with quidditch. No one believed I was good enough until I got on the Harpies. I don’t want to have to wait until Pansy and I are married or something for people to start treating us with respect.
Hermione: What makes you think Malfoy is straight, Harry?
Ginny: You know, he’s not the only one who wants to see you before you move to Scotland.
Harry: "Yeah, I’m here."
Harry: What the hell?
Harry: Hey. Stop it! I am IN this. I don’t know why you keep looking for reasons why I’m not but I am! I woke up at five-a-fucking-clock this morning and made quiche for the Mother of a prat who let me wake up to a cold bed. All week I’ve chosen YOU over my family. I introduced you to my godson! And last night?

Greenviper: Are you the only two adults there?
So… why Howlr?
Yeah. First day.
There was a pink tint blooming on Malfoy’s cheeks and Harry was at a loss of what to do with it. What was he supposed to say to that – to all of
“The only reason I finished  the course,” Harry continued, “was because McGonagall plans for me to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts in a few years and thought I needed to learn Auror grade defensive spells. It backfired , though, I was top of my Auror class and now the department won’t let me go unless I agree to teach a seminar over the summer – “
Prongs: Save that bollocks for someone else.  Having a crap childhood does not excuse your behavior.
Listen, you’re clearly in a bad place right now. I...I know what it’s like. I was in the same place for a really long time. Not that I think I know exactly what you’re going through. Just..if you think talking to some stranger on your spellular will help, I’m here.
Harry: Yeah, no. I’m not doing that! If it wasn’t mandatory, I wouldn’t even be going to the bloody thing! I don’t know the first thing about planning a ball.
Harry: Never. This has all been an unfortunate misunderstanding. You were merely a convenient vessel for my denial, nothing more. Further correspondence will not be necessary.
Harry: Know any Celestina Warbeck?
Greenviper: Don’t even type the name. And yes, yes they do.
Harry: "You’re such an arse."
Greenviper: If you weren’t so tragically plebian, you’d have known to pair it with a full-bodied white.
Prongs: To bottles and ear somthn?
Ginny: This is so much worse than last time.
Also, what is this? Some form of torture, I suspect.
Harry: NO.
The first thing Harry saw when he sat down was a styled head of distinct, white-blonde hair. He cursed under his breath, his nerves were already shot, a Malfoy encounter was the last thing he needed, though it would be a good story to tell Hermione. It also didn’t help that Malfoy looked fit to feast on, with his fitted grey waistcoat, pointed features and, bloody hell, the way his fingers wrapped around his glass – Oh no. Nope. It would not do for Nott to show up and see Harry arse over tit for bloody Malfoy.
Ron: Wow. That’s impressive. You can dance with Nott and keep tabs on Malfoy at the same time.
Draco: "Oooh begging, there’s an idea."
Greenviper: Oh. This is really considerate.
Prongs: Yes. He just lost his first tooth and was worried the tooth fairy wouldn’t find him at his sleepover.
Harry: Right.
Prongs: Bring it to the living room. Sit down on your no-doubt expensive armchair and drink it down in one.
Ron: Harry’s in a really bad spot and he’s run off. We haven’t heard from him since yesterday morning. Please keep a look out for him or for any clues of where he might be throughout the day.
Harry: The last I heard, he was engaged to Greengrass’ sister.
Neville: Month?!?! Shit.
Harry: I’m serious, Pansy.
Hermione: You’ll do great, Harry. Remember, he already knows you. This is just another adventure you all are going on together.
Draco: Her makeup is all over my bathroom, she keeps re-organizing my closet so I have no idea where anything is AND if I have to listen to her and the she-weasel have hate sex ONE more time, I’m going to pitch myself off the balcony.
Let’s start with ‘Greenviper!!!’ Then we can make our way to ‘Hydra;’ you were almost named serpent at birth.
Prongs: Yup.
Hermione: Bassenthwaite* and the other two from that year are Vikram Thakur and Timothy Morcott.
Arthur: Would sooner see you date a troll, as it turns out.
Parkinson just woke up, didn’t she?
“I’ll have you know,” Draco said out of breath, “that
“Look,” Harry said cautiously, “I was going to tell –“
Malfoy, quickly picking up on what was happening, leaned in, opening his mouth to let Harry explore. Though the more Harry did so, the more frantic Malfoy’s movements became. He seemed to be begging for Harry to kiss him harder, to move faster and Harry was doing his best but there was also this persistent part of him that wanted to take this slow and make it last.
Hermione: Be careful!
Harry’s chest and head felt like they were battling to see which one could cause him the most pain and they were both winning.
Greenviper: You are so thick sometimes.
“Hey,” he complained.
Draco: Well, there you have it. I don’t see why you feel the need to support him in the first place.
No, I don’t. I have no idea what that means.
NOTICE: when I first uploaded this chapter, some really funky things were happening. It has been fixed! My deepest apologies for not catching in time for some of you!
Greenviper: Was I about to get another lecture?
Neville: Where are you, mate? McGonagall looks murderous.
“Crass but well played, Potter,” he’d said and Harry’s chest soared  with what he felt was a misplaced sense of pride.
Luna: Always!
“While your abysmal work ethic and utter paucity of self-preservation skills are unsurprising, I would have thought that the fucking vanquisher of the Dark Lord would have done a bit more research in this particular instance.” Malfoy had a crazed look in his eyes. “I’m surprised Granger let you leave the house.”
Dean: Lo Harry
Harry: Potter out.
Ginny: TAKE COVER!!!!
Harry: No, SEAMUS is the best!!! Please delete that message before he sees it and tries to spell my hair green again!
Ron: You’re not really going to make me pay that, right?
Lavender: "I’m really glad to hear it, Harry! So, what’s up?"
Syn, my exceedingly brilliant Beta, has said many a time that she hates me for that ending...Sorry!?!  Anyway, thanks for reading and reviewing! We're having such great conversations, it's a dream come true!
Draco: "Magnificent, I only intended to get you off but it seems one truly can have it all."
Harry: I heard…at 3 o’clock this morning.
Hermione: We have brunch at the Burrow.
Harry: Who do you think he is?
Harry: I can’t believe you just typed out IQ.
In excruciating detail.
Greenviper: I’m aware. However, I thought it might appeal to your common sense of humor.
Greenviper: Whimper.
“Why don’t you make the same recipe twice? I know you’re not exactly the perfectionist type, but surely someone who enjoys cooking as much as you do would at least…”
Draco: Nice try.
Harry: Then the whole conversation disappeared.
Hermione: "I said, my name is Ms. Granger. You should check your connection."
Prongs: Ah, Hydra!!!! : D
Ginny: You always do this. You put all your eggs in one basket.
“This room brings back so many memories,” she said dreamily. She hopped off the bed and covered Teddy’s ears.
Harry: Obviously.
Greenviper: Drink the blue bottle first. It’s a sobering potion!
Harry: Hey, I don’t know what you’re into!
Ron: We know, but we’re going to anyway.
Draco: I thought I was clear that this wasn’t a one off. What was your plan? Fuck some, sit an obligatory brunch with my Mother, then you go off to Scotland and things conveniently “fizzle”.
Harry: Fix it.

“In that case shall I tell them to push our dinner reservation back an hour… a month perchance?”
Step one, turn on your spellular
Draco:  *Deep sigh* “I’m working up to something.”
Ginny: Harry and Malfoy.
Just do me a favour and don’t fuck this up.
Ginny: Just came across your profile.
Harry: Hahahhaah If that’s not the pettiest…
Prongs: I get you’re mad at me for reasons you’ve still yet to inform me of, but come on, Hydra, I know you must be a little thrilled at the idea of meeting me.
Ginny: We’re still on for the pub later, yeah?
Greenviper: It was almost my name.
“I’m going to eat you,” He declared, then licked Harry from bollocks to tailbone. Harry’s hips went haywire, bucking at air and his bloody cabinets. Drool dribbled at the corners Harry’s mouth. Draco steadying him.
I would say I enjoy long walks on the beach but salt water wreaks havoc on my hair and the last time I did that, I ended up having a four-hour conversation with a mermaid that turned out to be a washed up clean sweep and a pair of old pants.
Greenviper: I swear, if I walk in and you’re sitting there cock out, I’ll hex your bollocks off.
Harry: I’m buying. I’m in a piss mood but I don’t wanna talk about it. Do you accept these terms?
Greenviper: Potter.
Hermione: That’s really fast!
Prongs: Ok.
Ginny: Whatever you say, Harry.
All the blood drained from Malfoy’s face, making him look paler than usual. The expected Malfoy mask of indifference was gone completely so Harry was just left with what looked like a wounded young boy.
“God Da’” Harry corrected again, fondly rolling his eyes.
Andromeda: Harry, dear, are you busy?
He’s very cute.
Malfoy straightened in his seat, looking righteously put out. “My cousin,” he said through gritted teeth. “I was going to say, my cousin. As in, the child you’re raising is my estranged relative.” He removed his napkin from his plate, flicked it, then placed it neatly across his lap. “Salazar, Potter, if it was this easy to rile you up at Hogwarts, I wouldn’t have had to be near so creative.”
Prongs: Did you come looking for me the week my depression was ... you know?
Ginny: :b
Greenviper: Oh.
Ron: *A wavering voice* ‘I’m dead chuffed, Harry!’
Teddy: "Hahaha"
Ron: But you’re rich.
“I was a seeker while I was at Hogwarts too, Teddy,” Draco said. Teddy looked at him in awe.
Ginny: Bleh! I don’t want to think about Hermione pulling anything.
Harry: Wish I could, but I gave him my word.
Prongs: Work has been INSANE today! Distract me from the chaos?
Harry: I’ll see what I can do.
Draco: Keen observation, Potter. Whatever will the Aurors do without you?
Ginny: Stop.
Ron: Are you going to wear the dress too?
Harry: You are the luckiest bloke on the planet.
Harry: Guess who woke me up at 5 this morning!
Harry: How was your match, btw?
Ron: Brilliant! Why don’t you date HIM?
Greenviper: That was reassuring.
Draco: You will find time to have tea with my mother, Potter.
Harry felt the wet blunt head of Draco’s cock press against him and his rim pulsed against it, drawing it in.
“You think you’re really clever,” Draco said, with an eye roll.
Greenviper: So, I’ve been thinking, my young cousin asked some great questions the other night.
Harry: Course.
Greenviper: That’s where you and I differ, Prongs. Did you wish illness on yourself? No. When you break your arm, do you apologise for it? Of course not. It’s not your fucking fault we were forced to fight in war when we were teenagers, Ok? Frankly, I’d be more concerned if you weren’t a bit fucked up.
Lavender: "Oh right, poor dear! I heard from Parvati who heard from Hannah that he’s had a terrible accident. Can he really not move at all? I mean, honestly, some people never change from Hogwarts. Of course, I’ve changed loads thanks to the beast that shall not be named! I swear if he wasn’t already rotting in Azkaban, I’d go full wolf and kill him myself! And to think,
“I,” Harry said softly, not knowing what would come next. “I didn’t… I don’t know, maybe I did.” He tried to blink away his confusion. Malfoy looked like he’d used up his last ounce of patience hours ago and he was now running on reserves. “Maybe I wanted to...” Harry looked at his,
This is so fucked up.
Harry: Well, I’ll be at the restaurant at 7 if you still want to join me.
Prongs: She’s not the kind of witch you just say no to.
(See the end of the chapter for
Prongs: So just to be clear, we are postponing the ‘meet up’ discussion to appease your Slytherin sensibilities but there will be one eventually, yes?
Hermione: Thanks, Harry. Love you!
“Uhh – yeah,” Harry said, both terrified to move his hand and nervous that, if he didn’t, Malfoy might hit him. “I’ll have a working floo in my chambers. In case, I don’t know, you were worried… or something.”
Prongs: I miss the old days… when he used to sleep on my chest.
Harry: I don’t know.
“I think it’s time to pick a safe word, Potter,” Draco said. Bloody fucking Christ. Harry’s knees almost gave way as the promise of Draco’s words consumed him. He’d – they’d wanted this for so long; since before last night, since before Hydra, before the invention of fucking Howlr, and now they were finally going to get it. It was almost surreal, Harry had to remind himself to stay present in the moment and not get lost in the idea of it. So he reverted back to his original plan.
Greenviper: Tell him I say ‘sharing is caring.’
Greenviper: Bond, Shag, Stun…
Draco pressed closer, sliding his half-interested prick against Harry’s. He was screwed. And not in the way he desperately wanted to be. What happened to the chaste prat that’d been making Harry work overtime for a mere snog? Despite the current (prominent) objections from other parts of his body, Harry wanted
Pansy: Not likely. I heard you really fucked up today, Potter.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry: Gin, let Pansy move back in. I’M not even mad at her for the Hydra thing.
Harry: If I have to keep talking to these reporters for you, I’m going to need a constant stream of alcohol?
Hermione: We’ll be home in five.
Ginny: Right, but you’ve never loved anyone more than me before. I watched you this morning with Teddy and Malfoy and something snapped. Well, it’s always been him, hasn’t it?
Harry: "Hydra, I’m leaking, just touch
Hermione: Ah.
Ron: Right, go on mate.
Harry: My fault?
Harry: Blimey, Gin.
Prongs: …. Maybe. :/
Greenviper: No. Like being self-aware enough to recognize that being on the right side doesn’t mean you’re always right.
There was a high pitched creek from across the hall. Harry stopped all movement.
Prongs: Cheers.
Harry: Actually, I think I’m going to stay.
Ron: You wouldn’t.
Harry: lmfao Really?
“I don’t think we’ll be needing the reservation,” Malfoy said to her, cold and detached. Harry’s stomach plummeted. This was it? After all this bloody time, it was over. Just like like that. “My sincerest apologies for the inconvenience.“
Ginny: Course you will.
Ginny: Are you calling me predictable?
“But today is a new day, Potter,” Draco pressed Harry’s nipples into his chest, “things have changed.” Pain spread like the blush across Harry’s chest, picking up pleasure on its way down the rest of his body.
Draco: Great. So I’ll meet you at Palms of Goa at 7, then? Or shall we push for 6, in case things start to fizzle.
It wouldn’t press in all the way at first, but Draco was persistent and Harry felt the tongue breach his rim and push itself in. It delved and explored Harry, pulling back only to go deeper.
Ron: Rather ‘off’ than a Parkinson.
“It was cute, then you ruined it,” he insisted. He lifted himself off of Harry and began the arduous process of standing up. “This is your problem; you always take things too far.” Harry caught his arm before he could walk away. Draco turned back to him and Harry saw it, bright and fond and unwavering.
Ragged breath * "I smack your right nipple for added inspiration."
Harry: Huh?
TheRealGing: Not that many, actually. It’s a heavily warded profile. We screen the site and select who gets to see our profile. Then we wait for them to bite. All of those selected have been interested, though. :b
Hermione: If something natural makes you that uncomfortable, we will replace the couch. Ron and I are sincerely sorry, we thought you’d be at work.
Harry: Yes.
Hermione: Thank you, Padma.
Greenviper: Fool, indeed.
Ginny: LMFAO
“Stop that,” Draco said, pushing Harry away again. Harry held up his hands in protest.
Harry: Grang?
Hermione: You WILL spend the day with him! You took the day off and you’ll drop him off at Shell just a few hours before bedtime.
“Fine,” she said. She lifted Teddy off her shoulder and placed him on the ground next to her. “You still want to play quidditch when you grow up, yeah?”
Prongs: I cum in peace.
Prongs: So I’ve learned.
Harry: Neville, Neville, Neville, Minerva could never be mad at me. I saved her school, if you’ve forgotten.
Draco: Is this an attempt at seduction? Your big move is to shield me from a sock?
“You can spit it out,” Draco said, “I’d like to hear you.” That was easier said than done. There was no simple way to spit the cloth out without the use of his hands, it was too lodged in there. Harry had to push with his tongue until something broke free and he was able to rid himself of it with steady breathing and help from his slackening jaw.
Harry: I don’t think a level of cross exists that would stop Ron from saying yes to you.
“Put me down,” he objected, kicking her in the back.
Prongs: OH MY GOD! You are sooo judgy!
Ron: My head hurts.
Pansy: Fine.
Harry: Yes…A time of ginger hairballs, no covers and the scent of sweaty armguards. You’re absolutely right, how have I managed without you?
Harry: Tell your girlfriend to keep her nose out.
Harry: Did we? I stopped reading it ages ago. I’m sorry, I should have warned you.
Harry: Wth, Gin? I asked you to sign an old jersey. This is a Firebolt Infinity signed by your entire team! Fuck the raffle, I want to keep this for myself.
Harry: There’s some space just in front of me, if you don’t mind it being a bit snug. No socks in sight.
Seamus: HEY!
Prongs: Yeah, but it wasn’t my side that drew the first wand, was it?
Prongs: 730 days give or take a few minutes.
Draco: Aww, is the saviour scared?
Prongs: What makes lips whatever-you-just-said? I could have them.
Greenviper: Well, you’re tenacious.
Greenviper: Fuck, Prongs.
!” For reasons unknown to Harry, that seemed to cheer Malfoy. He made a performance out of crossing one long leg over the other.
Greenviper: Are you Potterera?
Prongs: Do you want to call me Daddy, Hydra?
Hermione: Ron!
Prongs: I should be so lucky.
Arthur: So, this is serious then?
Greenviper: What does that mean?
Greenviper: Ok.
Harry: Ace! I’ve just put some soup on, want me to bring you some?
Greenviper: You better not be OK. You better be lying in St. Mungo’s drinking meals from a straw. I can see you saw my messages!
Hermione: "So manage them. 17:00, don’t be late. And Mr. Brewer, take pride in your occupation. If it is no longer stimulating, find work that is."
Prongs: It’s hard to believe you survived such adversity.
Prongs: : D You’ve been ‘Bae’ in my phone since our first date.
Prongs: Sure am.
Harry: NO!
Harry: I don’t get the impression he wanted to be.
Harry: And therein lies half the fun!
Harry: Not a problem.
“I don’t even know what that means,” he whined.
Neville: Focus that enthusiasm on finding me another prize.
Draco: "Fucking Salazar! I can’t do it. This is a failed experiment. I can’t tease you without teasing myself."
Harry: "OH FUCK! Yes, keep fucking me with your fingers. MMMmmmmmm That – Just do t-that!"
Hermione: You didn’t say anything either! Anyway, Draco might be hurt even if he didn’t know it was you, Harry. He was staring at you the whole night. I was watching.
Draco: Much appreciated.
Harry: Oh, it’s an eyelash curler. Muggles use them to make their eyelashes look longer or something.
Harry: “It was joke about how you won’t end this conversation.”
Prongs: I looked it up. No thank you.
“We can’t do this tonight,” Malfoy said, sounding like each word was a war he was waging within himself.
Cho: “Ok.”
Harry: "Smart man."
Draco: "Yes? Oh, listen to you. You’re so desperate for it, I can hear it in your breathing. Still, I rub around your nipples. I want to suck them, to bite them until you forget why it feels good but instead I graze the top of each peak."
Harry: Good, because consent is important.
When Draco finally,
“Ah,” Harry cut him off, “but that was the last question!” Teddy looked weary but did not say anything further.
Harry: You’re thinking of getting married?
Hermione: Mind giving an explanation, oh rude one.
Ron: Fine. Bring gloves…
On Wednesdays and Thursdays he gets a packed lunch because he doesn’t like school lunch.
Greenviper: If you say so. She seemed possessive.
Greenviper: That!!! You MUST apologize for.
Prongs: Hey, don’t use my romantic gesture to pull other blokes?
Harry: Priorities.
Harry: Hello
“Dad?” Teddy questioned, looking from Harry to Draco. He fit himself easily into the space between Harry’s waist and right arm.
Harry: Oh, those aren’t so bad.
Draco: "Right, now close your eyes and listen."
Prongs: Muggle protections. Do a Revelio.
Harry: If I choose to move forward with him.
Harry: "Is there a reason you called?"
Harry: He doesn’t hate me anymore?
Draco: As soon we’re not surrounded by your fan club, you’re going to thoroughly regret saying that.
Arthur: Some of those Acrylic nails as well.
Harry: I was going to say 22:30 but…
(See the end of the chapter for
Ginny: Pansy says to check Godric’s Hollow.
Harry: Look, I’
Feeling he’d gone through the motions, Harry was just about to head into his room and ‘find’ Teddy when his living room Floo roared to life. Harry had a warded Floo; few people knew the address and the ones who did knew not to show up on a Teddy day.
“Yes,” Draco encouraged, “open up for me.”
Prongs: I think you meant to say ‘WE did heinous things.’
Harry: They don’t call me the saviour  for nothin’
Ron: Not taking no for an answer, mate.
Ron: Harry, mate, you’ve been holding out on us!
Neville: How does everything look?
… I’m glad it was you.
Prongs: No take backsies
Mr. Brewer: "Yes but – "
Harry: Clothes!
Greenviper: Just so you’re aware, this is really creepy.
My my, that is an impressive shade of red.
Harry: I know right! I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!
Greenviper: Be honest with me, what happens when I open this attachment?
Harry: “No, I’m sorry. I just, errr, thought you were someone I knew from school. Not that there’s a school called Hogwarts – that would be
“Of course, if I
Draco: "Well that's because I don’t actually sound like this, you idiot."
Prongs: Was that a dick joke?
Greenviper: Indeed.
Prongs: She does. I love her too. Not romantically, though.
Harry: "This better be good." *Hisses* "Owe! Did you just
“I just want some fucking time,” Harry said desperately. “You’ve had months to process this. I’m asking for more than half an hour.”

Prongs: What’s with the earpiece and the second potion?
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s a play on a complete misunderstanding of a Bible verse,” Harry corrected. Draco squeezed back. Harry’s chest soured. He looked up at Ginny in time to see her eyeing their joined hands with disdain. Harry knew Ginny didn’t exactly like Draco but that was a bit much.
Harry: I know. I’m happy for you!
Neville: It’s already framed in my living room.
Ginny: That wasn’t your call to make!
Greenviper: That it is.
Prongs: I refuse to let your sour mood ruin this.
Ginny: Whoops.
Harry: "Hydra?"
Harry: Ride or die, baby.
Neville: Oh and don’t worry about calling Millicent. I talked to her this morning.
Greenviper: Do you seek atonement?
Ginny: Babe, let’s try and remember he’s doing us a favor.
Greenviper: I have no reason to lie to you.
Draco: Fuck you, potter!
The opposite of the point, you prat.
Draco: "PO – Mmmm FUCKING! Shit."
Harry: *Laughing* "Slag."
Harry: Return to sender. This is not what I ordered.
Prongs: Prick.
Prongs: It’s not eloquent but it’s accurate, ok. You hush up and take it.
Malfoy sat back down on his stool stiffly, a hint of a smile a the corner of his month and a glint of hope in his eye. Despite it all, it made Harry’s heart do a little jump to see it.
Luna: We’re just glad you’re safe.
On a moan* "
Greenviper: Do you know why I abhor muggle shops?
Harry: Need I remind you that I defeated the darkest wizard of all time.
Prongs: I drink the water, Viper
Harry: “Of course I didn’t know I was lying at the time but I think I’ve sorted it out now.”
Neville: Thanks a galleon!
Ginny: Just be yourself, Harry. That’s the point of this, yeah? You’re a simple guy. Don’t overthink it.
Prongs: Ignorance loves company?
Ginny: She's not my ex.
Draco: "Now be a good boy and ask me nicely for it."
Prongs: I’d Twist and scissor in your hole as I wrapped my mouth around the swollen head of your prick.
Prongs: Wow.
McGonagall: I always know, Mr. Potter.
Dean: Nah, I’m pretty sure we’re past that.
Ron: It’s time, mate.
My lovely beta
“Only the savior of the wizarding world,” Malfoy said, haughtily.
Greenviper: If you had them, you’d know.
Prongs: Only ever really been in one, to tell you the truth. It was about three years.
Harry: I probably wouldn’t have invited you but not for the reasons you think, ok. To start, as much as I love him, Teddy is a handful and requires all of my attention. I would have had to keep abandoning you in a room full of Weasleys, which, you now, I’m sure you would have LOVED! And honestly, Draco, you aren’t exactly a favourite around here. I wouldn’t want Teddy to meet you surrounded by people that might negatively influence his opinion of you.
Draco: “Well, that’s the best you’re getting, you narcissistic sap.”
Harry: Blimey, IT WAS ONE TIME!
Harry: What is the matter with you?
Teddy: "WE’RE MAKING MACARONI MEN!"
Ron: Not again.
“Stop,” Harry said, desperate to get that look off Malfoy’s face. “I’m doing a piss poor job of explaining.”
Anyone who’s interested message me by replying to this question: ‘If you ever met a very famous person, what would you say to them?’
Greenviper: What did he see in you?
I can’t even see you and I know you’re evil smirking.
Prongs: Oh um, don’t call me Prongs in this context.
you implying?”
Now, Draco looked at Harry for saving. Harry smirked, fuck-all if that was happening after the shite he pulled all night.
Angelina: What happened? We saw him at the party last week and he seemed fine.
Neville: Cheers. See you at 3 brooms in 10.
Harry: “But – “
Harry: "Don’t tease."
Ginny: Congratulations.
Ron: You snog one slytherin and now it’s all about the prestige with you.
Ginny: Let me finish.
Harry: You forgot Fleur, Angelina and Audrey.
Oh bother, that’s going to eat at me all night.
Ginny: Well bully for you, Harry, but YOU weren’t supposed to be her partner!
Prongs: Yes, HAHA. You think I’m dumb. My side’s splitting.
Harry: "Right. I’m taking over for Neville with all the opening ball rubbish and – "
Harry: … Out with it then.
Bloody hell … You’re not obsessed with Harry Potter are you?
Prongs: Tell me what you like, Hydra.
Ron: Good on you, mate.
Cho: “Hello, thanks for calling Papa John’s, I’m Cho, and I’ll – “
MagicWood69: They don’t need to be of your face. XD
“Do you want him to have said that?” Teddy countered. He looked very pleased with himself. Draco was stunned.
Harry: Of course not! I would NEVER purposely keep Teddy from a family event. He and Andromeda had tickets to see a show. We didn’t know Hermione was going to propose this week.
Harry: Pretty sure?!?!
Mr. Brewer: "We agreed on 18:00."
Prongs: Oh. Not out to the family yet, then?
Harry: Pass.
Grey eyes flashed, as Draco let the non-verbal dare wash over him as if it were fourth year all over again. Back when the rivalry was fun, petty and arguably flirtatious.  He gripped Harry’s jaw, firm, roving his thumb over his lower lip. Harry pulled the digit into his mouth and sucked at the tip. The act completely consumed him, he savored Draco’s thumb in a silent promise. He called the whole thing into his mouth and sucked at it like he wished it were the other man’s cock.
“Edward Remus Lupin, say that you’re sorry right now. We do not use that language no matter who you learned it from.”
Harry: See, I want him to come to the conclusion that you’re an arse all on his own.
Greenviper: *Raises eyebrow* Do elaborate, Kink boy.
Harry: Good.
Harry: Promise?
Ron: *Laughing* ‘I’ll let you go back to sleep.’
I’ll just come over when you’re done with your ex date, shall I?
Harry: No Weasel jokes tonight, Malfoy! I mean it.
Harry: Auspicious timing then.
Draco: *Whimpering* "Salazar, I want to touch my cock so bad."
Greenviper: One-word response. That’s a good sign.
Draco: “You make me happy and I didn’t think that was possible…for me. Which is, as you put it, defeating-the-Dark-Lord fucking terrifying. So, I’m sorry I keep doubting you. Eventually, I’ll become disillusioned with you and that will no longer be a problem.”
Hermione: I guess I still don’t get it. You two were mad about each other. You couldn’t keep your hands off one another… then one day you woke up and decided to end it?
Greenviper: Where’s your sprog?
Prongs: Do you know how many people I lost in the war?
Ron: Either you’re a homewrecker or it’s Nott? Good on you, mate.
Prongs: WOW. You’re not even going to try to cover it up?
Greenviper: Rather evasive than a ‘match-maker.’
Prongs: Viper, you wound me.
Harry: ‘Congratulations, Mr. Granger.’
TheRealGing: Come on, Harry! The Harpies lost today, I could use the ego boost.
Ginny: *Closing eyes* zzzzZZZZZZ
Harry: It’s not Malfoy!
Prongs: You know what, I don’t think I will. Some fool empowered me.
Draco traced down Harry’s spine, vertebrae by vertebrae. Harry pressed down so hard on the counter, he worried his sweat-slick palms might slip and he’d break something. Still, he refused to move them because Draco asked him not to. He just stayed there, planted, waiting impatiently to be destroyed.
Ginny: "Never you mind, Potter."
I’ve been on dates before.
Draco: And he’s out before noon.
I would fall in love.
“Of course. Mr. Malfoy reserved the table for the whole evening, so take as much time as you need.” She gave Malfoy another tentative look then practically ran from their presence.
“Oh, had you started?” Harry mocked. “My mistake, I just assumed you were really going to hit me.” There was no stoping it, Harry heard the crack as Draco bore down on him twice in quick succession. He rocked forward so hard by the force of it, his hard cock crashed against his kitchen cabinets. Harry cursed.
Ginny: Harry. Isn’t. An. Ex- Death Eater!
Cho: “Might I suggest ordering online.”
My Beta was wonderful this time around AND I DO MEAN WONDERFUL! So, I wanted to do something special for her. What did I do, you ask? I wrote her fluffy, cheesy, sappy poetry like my girl Ginny Weasley!
Ginny: Oh no.
Step two, go to appstore
Harry: DRACO!
Greenviper: Salazar. No.
Harry: "You’re evil."
What do I put in my profile? It has to be good, right? I obviously won’t have a picture.
Hermione: Why was Pansy in Godric’s Hollow?
[Photo unavailable]
Greenviper: Yes. I assume you feel I haven’t a right to attend.
Hermione: [Ted-text-nado] Noun
Ron: I am? Did I beat George in the pool? The Cannons ACTUALLY beat Puddlemere?
I know how it sounds, it’s not what you think.
Ron: He who?
Cho: *Clears throat*
Harry: Sry.
Prongs: Somebody’s jealous!
Neville: I wanted a challenge for the Newt students. I’m up against Matilda Spore at Beauxbatons who practically revolutionized modern magical herbology. I didn’t want the transferring students to feel like they got the bad end of the wand when they got me as their professor.
I’m apparating out of the city, so there’s no point in you coming!
Ron: And pick him up in the morning after you’ve slept off your hangover.
Greenviper: That could be arranged.
Harry: Anytime.
Draco: "Somehow I think I’ll make it up to you."
Harry: Yes. Unfortunately, yes. It has happened and I am blind. My eyes will NEVER come back from this.
Greenviper: I’m bored. Would you like to play a game?
Draco: Are you having trouble reading English? Shall I give Mermish a try, or would you like to dust off that neglected organ inside your skull and give it another go?
Draco: “Sublime.”
“Shit!” Harry squeezed his eyes shut as Draco adjusted so he was hitting the mark with every, practiced thrust. Harry grasped, frantically, between his legs, impressed by just how wet he was. He smeared the pre-come over his prick and began to stroke, moaning into the relief of it. He was so sensitive, the head of his cock red and poking out of his foreskin, he nearly feared the intensity of his building orgasm.
At least the restaurant turned out to be a great choice. It was a bit
He huffed, staring Harry down with the force of a curse. His nostrils flared and mouth sneered in a manner far too reminiscent of the boy Harry had known in Hogwarts. He sat up a little taller on his bar stool.
Greenviper: Yes.
Hermione: Harry.
Greenviper: You’re behaving like a petulant child.
2. (my take on a Tanka: 5,7,5,77)
Hermione: Since when are you the expert on gay relationships, Ronald Weasley. Is there something you’d like to share?
Draco: I suggest committing it to memory as it won’t be happening again.
The bartender placed what looked like a couple fingers of muggle whisky in front of Harry and another cocktail in front of Malfoy. Harry gave an imperceptible shake of his head, realizing too late that he’d  been staring at the impatient wizard sat next to him the whole time.
“Auntie Ginny also says you’re a tosser.” Teddy beamed with the thrill of the contraband word. Harry choked, looking up at Draco to gauge his reaction. Predictably, he’d gone whiter than Moaning Mrytle. Harry gave him an apologetic look then turned, sternly, to Teddy.
Hermione: We invited ourselves to come stay for a bit.
Mr. Weasley: I will not!
Greenviper: For now.
Teddy: "Yeah.
Harry: “Just charge it to the card on my account.”
I bet he’s just some 60 year old wizard, jerking off into a banana peel.
Put your hand in your pants and stroke your cock. Put on a show for me.
McGonagall: Well, I appreciate it, all the same.
WARNING: This chapter deals with depression and is at points significantly more serious than other chapters. You have been warned!
Harry felt rough fabric press against his lips. He looked down. It was his white kitchen towel. Draco pushed it into his mouth at Harry’s shocked gasp. He pushed and pushed until Harry started to choke, the towel pressing against his gag-reflex with nowhere else to go.
Ginny: So not the point, Harry.
Greenviper: This is ridiculous. I’m sitting right next to you. Talk to me.
Greenviper: I never want to be in the same room as you two.
“Since about third year,” he admitted desperately. “You know this.
Mr. Brewer: "Shit, like the famous one."
McGonagall: "Don’t let there be any mishaps."
I might implode a little bit.
“Mind explaining what is so fuc –“
Ron: ‘Still, who could even look at her with Hermione in the room!’
He was too nice. I just told you about my ex gf, yeah. I’ve always liked them a bit mean.
Prongs: Worried you don’t fit the mold?
Ginny: What she means is she’s working with top designers and they can’t hold the robes all day.
Harry: Yes, thank you! I’ve been looking all over for it.
Hermione: "Cheers, that’s what I like to hear!"
Ron: He’s a fashionable bloke, Hermione. Don’t be so stereotypical.
Harry: "Now who’s sappy?"
Hermione: Have you been taking your potion, Harry?
Greenviper: That’s how it was told to me as a child. I had an Aunt who said his ghost haunted Azkaban and that on Christmas Eve he stole all the presents from children who played with muggles.
Ron: It’s true! I called Dean and Seamus second year and I knew about Fred when everyone still thought he was dating Angelina. I even called you, Harry!
“Good,” Harry said. He laid down on one of the vacant sides beside Teddy. He looked at the already slumbering boy, always forgetting how small he was until he watched him sleep peacefully.
Harry: HA. He did it this morning!
Ron: Yeah, you do!
Harry: “Huh?”
Pansy: It’s your birthday, after all.
Ginny: Yeah, said you really cocked his rocks off!
Draco: Tell your Ex you’re not mad at Pansy for not telling you I was Hydra so she’ll let Pansy back in their flat.
Ginny: You ratted me out to Pansy! What kind of Percy-like git are you?
Ginny: Ugh, fine.  I promise.
Prongs: NOPE! Mm onto you. Stop trying to be snecky and figure who I am
Draco removed his tongue, replacing it with a finger to massage at Harry’s prostate. Harry bucked on a whimper, a smattering of bright dots appearing before his eyes. This was insane he’d barely touched his dick and - his balls drew up again –
Prongs: 18:30 sounds perfect!
Harry: I’d really like to see you again.
Greenviper: A week after YOU broke up with him? Tactless.
Harry: Course.
My spellular is deleting our entire conversation.
Ron: I’m cooking! Won’t be as fancy as your meals, I reckon, but it’ll get the job done.
Ginny: This is me being supportive.
Harry: What are you doing tonight?
Harry: Yeah, and I’m not one of them.
Ginny: All proceeds go to Ginny Weasley, who has been shagging her insatiable gf all day to stop her from murdering the chosen one.
Ron: Talking to him on Howlr. Theo is Hydra.
Prongs: Not really. Just always been good at puzzles. But this one isn’t a hard one to solve. I think you freaked when you found out I was pan and you needed time to figure out if you were ok with that.
Draco let his hands slide down Harry’s body, allowing himself to go flush against the other wizard in the process. Harry just watched it happen, not sure how he managed to get this lucky but certainly not going to argue.
Prongs: Ok
“This remind you of old times, Ted?” She said, ignoring the boy’s feigned protests. “You me and Harry used to sleep in bed like that, didn’t we?” Harry felt Draco stiffen next to him. What was Ginny playing at? “Tell me, Tedward, who’s the better cuddler, me or
Harry: "That sounds more like you. Ha."
Draco: "You suck them into your mouth." *Sucking sounds * "Uhh that feels incredible. Mmm makes me wonder what else you can do with that mouth."
Wait a second, what’s the worse news?
Harry: Not true. I devoured Quidditch through the ages!
Dean: Why!?!?!
Neville: Thank you, thank you, thank you! Apparate to my flat so I can go over the basic schedule with you.
“You were right earlier,” Malfoy said by way of explanation. “You need more time to get used to the idea of us,” he lifted his head to look at Harry, “of me.” Harry wanted to go back in time and give his past self a swift kick in the shins.
Ginny: Are you done being dramatic?
“Fuck, Potter – that was –“
“Teddy!” Harry gasped, cheeks coloring. Draco laughed sheepishly, looking to Harry for help. “Where did you even hear that?”
Prongs: Yes?
Greenviper: Depends. What did you pair it with?
Pansy: With who?
Hermione: That is precisely what I said.
Hermione: Besides it only makes sense that our sides be even. You’ll have George, Charlie, Percy and Bill in your party and I’ll have Harry, Ginny, Luna and Neville in mine.
Check Howlr!
Harry: HE TALKED TO ME!
Dean: Look, mate, all I can do is promise he won’t punch you.
Harry: Oops
“Clearly,” Ginny snapped, then shouted “Oi, Sprog! Wakey, wakey, hard boiled and crisply broiled.”  Teddy woke, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. You could see the moment disorientation transitioned into wakefulness. His eyes went wide and his eyebrows shot up to the top of his now ginger head.
Ron: Haha I’ve spotted Morcott. He’s a real keeper.
“Ok,” Harry breathed without argument. He lifted himself up with one arm, so the other could wrap around Draco’s neck and pull him into another heart-stopping kiss.
Harry:
Draco: Fine. Pick me up 6:30.
Draco: It’s as simple as a word, Potter. Yes or no?
Harry: For Christ sakes, fight-fuck in your own flat!
Draco blew warm air against him. Harry jerked his hips forward, feeling his hole clench, begging for the man’s attentions.
Greenviper: ‘Please, Sir!’
Harry: I was wondering if I could ask you for some advice?
Prongs: No, must have missed that class. You think my date will hold it against me?
Greenviper: Subtle, Prongs.
Harry: Ok. What do I do?
Harry: "I wish I could see how gorgeous you are right now."
Draco: *Clears throat, speech is clipped and decisive* “Thank you for your inarticulate, grammatically incorrect confession earlier. I needed to hear it.”
Harry: Yeah, Dudley's band sucks but it’s nice he has a dream.  And I warned you on the way here that the venue would be a little rough around the edges.
SheSnake: Because you’re weak, Potter, and we can all smell it on you!
“And,” Draco continued, looking somber, “the only werewolf I’ve ever met who embraced their wolf form, could even control when he changed, he was a sick and terrible creature. Nowhere near the man your father was.”
Harry: ‘Know all secrets to the universe now, do you?’
“Can I have a brownie before I go?” Teddy asked.
Harry: I don’t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable.
How about we skip the show and go for Curry instead?
Prongs: Worth it. That was a great line.
Greenviper: Stop ogling me, you fool.
Prongs: I wouldn’t assume you know at all what I feel.
Neville: THREE MEETINGS! The re-opening ball’s next week. Young British witches and wizards’ have been spread out in schools all over Europe and now they’ll finally get to come to Hogwarts! There’s no room for error. We have to prove to the Wizarding World that Hogwarts is more than a madman trying to kill off muggleborns. I thought you of all people would understand that. Hogwarts is your home too!
Harry decided that the best way to placate a potentially disgruntled Malfoy was to whip him up a delicious plate of eggs benedict and fresh fruit before his interview. He danced around the kitchen, letting his mind go into cooking mode as he gathered up the necessary ingredients.
Harry: What if I cock it all up? Or say something stupid?
yourself?"
Harry: Hydra doesn’t know who I am, Hermione.
“You’re lucky your cute,” Harry said and closed his eyes as well.
Greenviper: What the hell are you doing, Potter?
“I just don’t,” Harry said evasively, trying to do the breathing exercises that Hermione always suggested but never worked.
Harry: Thanks ever so.
Harry: Not yet ;) ;) ;)
Hermione: He’s wearing Lilac.
