“I’ve done all I can for him,” she declared. “The rest is up to him. And, if I know him at all, he should be just fine. I will return to my ward to check on Severus. And knowing him, he will return here by this evening. Might I suggest an explanation before this one out here blows his top?”
Up in Draco and Harry's room, Draco was taking Harry's trousers off. But there was no joy in the task because Harry had passed out as soon as he'd sat down on the bed.
started walking back to the castle. Except, all I did was get us more and more lost. We were in the Forbidden Forest until January 28th, spending all of Fall Term and Christmas in the forest. We faced many challenges and obstacles there, as you can imagine. We will go into that in depth at our next interview, please,” Draco said, forestalling Dimitri’s question. “Suffice to say, Harry lost his vision and his ability to speak when a nundu attacked.”
“Potter! What is the meaning of this?! Why did you feel the need to shock me out of a sound sleep?! Potter, are you even listening to me?! Potter!”
“Anything we could do to face off against one another was done. The dueling club in our second year, for instance, when everyone found out Harry was a Parselmouth. Classes and House points and the House Cup. Duels in the hallways, although forbidden, were a constant. I caught Harry and his friends smuggling a dragon once. Another time, meeting in secret in the Room of Requirement to train fellow students. He Polyjuiced himself as one of my friends to get into the Slytherin common room to find out if I was the heir of Slytherin in our second year.”
“It was rare we got meat for food, because there weren’t animals we could eat in the Forbidden Forest. And we had no weapons. Except Harry’s wand. We did take down a quintaped one day.”
PLEASE REREAD CHAPTERS 6 AND 7 BECAUSE I POSTED THEM OUT OF ORDER ORIGINALLY AND NOW THEY'RE FIXED!!!
In the doorway, Ron and Hermione looked on in shock. Draco Malfoy and Harry were in close proximity. Harry was hurt. But none of the adults were questioning Malfoy as they should be. What Hermione noticed, which Ron had not, was the look about her Slytherin classmate. For someone who had spent the last six months in the Forbidden Forest trying to survive, he didn’t look as malnourished as Harry did. Something was not adding up here.
“Not quite, Draco. Harry has used much of his magic helping your father and Professor Snape. You said he used legillimancy just before losing consciousness? That must have been the final straw. He is too exhausted. The physical exhaustion comes from the magic trying to find something else to use as fuel. I gave him some of my magic, just a little, to keep his stores from depleting and start rebuilding instead. I’m going to put him to bed so he can recover comfortably, and then we’re all going to have a little chat. Right here in this room, so Draco will not have to be moved. Madam Pomfrey did say you were okay, however.”
“Okay. I agree completely. His answers to me were pompous and he was late when he arrived. Only a few minutes, but it didn’t even seem to faze him. He thinks he’s the best simply because you’re Harry Potter. Never forget that Harry, you are first and foremost Harry Potter. You will always be you. You are only a Zabini by name.”
When the robes were loosened, Harry drew them down Draco’s arms and followed their progress with kisses across Draco’s shoulders. He wore nothing beneath his robes now. Nothing fit and too much chafed besides. Even pants were too much for his sensitive skin. All the better, as far as Harry was concerned. Never allowing his lips to leave Draco’s skin, Harry helped Draco rise from the bench. His robes fell all the way and pooled at his feet. Slowly, Draco turned in Harry’s arms and they kissed again.
“Are you okay? What’s wrong?” Draco asked, placing a hand on his arm. “You’ve been sitting there, silent, for nearly ten minutes now. You must have been thinking about something terribly important. And you haven’t spaced like that in a long time. I’m curious as to who else felt that wave of magic you just sent out.” Draco smiled and placed a hand on Harry’s arm. “Why don’t you–? Harry? What’s wrong?” Now he was concerned.
It took time for Harry to rejoin the land of the conscious. It was mid-March by the time he truly came around and Draco was truly starting to show in his fifth month. For the last two and a half weeks, Draco had fought off the pressures of the rest of the Gryffindor Trio to tell all and let them into his life. He wanted nothing to do with them. They were not a part of his life, except that they were part of Harry’s life. He didn’t know what he would do about that, but he’d cross that river when he came to it.
“Y-y-yes, m-my Lor-r-rd,” Lucius panted, struggling to breathe. He was really okay with not moving right now.
“Set them down and thank-you Kipper.” Kipper was gone once more. “I’m going to place a sheet up so you don’t see what I’m doing, but don’t worry. I’ll be talking to you the entire time.” The sheet appeared. “I’m going to spell your pants off Harry, and then place a numbing charm on the lower half of your body. Giving birth is painful, but I’m going to lessen the pain as much as possible. Okay? Here we go.” Harry gasped as the cold air hit his bare skin, then once again when he felt the spell take place. “Everything looks good Harry. You’ve formed a temporary canal. Let me know if you feel anything or experience anything.”
So the plan was to give a series of three interviews to run a week apart each to a reporter that was
Next chapter is the plan and the first interview. Draco is only getting bigger, people. And it’s summer, so he’s all out of sorts. Oh! And Harry’s birthday!
Eventually he said, “Why not a charmed bracelet or something that will heat when you need it to? We can give on one to Pomfrey and Severus and Dumblefore.”
I do not own Harry Potter, etc. I wish I did, but that belongs to JK Rowling and all her people. Lucky bastards...
are the best species of caterpillar to use and were the type used for this specific potion. Therefore, and I quote, ‘I win’. He’s right, the little bugger. We have to get these caterpillars special from the United States simply because the
A hand around his wrist startled him out of his thoughts. “Draco wait,” Harry gasped, still laughing a bit, “wait a moment. I’m not… I’m not laughing… at you…” He coughed a few times and stood up straight to look Draco in the eyes. “I was laughing because of the lyrics. Did you listen to the songs before you changed them?”
“My fault?! You’re the one who pushed me into the hippogriffs! That black one nearly took my head off!”
to see if there was anything he could do. Once Harry was sitting up again and drinking small sips of water, Blaise said, “I guess a tour of the house is off for now then.” Harry managed a weak smile before getting help with getting off the floor and walking to his new bedroom. “I’ll be right next door, okay? If you need anything I’ll be right here. Call for me or for- Oh! I forgot to introduce Kipper. Kipper!” A small crack and a shy house elf appeared. “Kipper, this is Harry Potter Zabini, my husband. He’s pregnant and I want you to care for him, okay? We’ll be getting a mediwitch or -wizard soon to help with the more specific things, but until then anything he needs you get for him, okay?”
Draco laughed softly. Harry had always been excited about presents because of his childhood. And Draco always made sure he had plenty to be excited about. “You can have it now, but we have to go down to the kitchen first. Do I need to help you get rid of anything first?”
“I don’t care if there’s anything wrong with him,” Snape snapped, finally getting irritated by being back-talked to. “If he has a disease, then you would have caught it! I won’t have my godson sick because of something he did!”
“Harry, that’s great!” Blaise grabbed Harry and pulled him toward him in a hug. Harry returned it, utterly ecstatic now that someone else knew. Blaise set him down and Harry put one hand on his stomach again. They both smiled before Harry stood on his tip-toes and kissed Blaise’s cheek. Suddenly, there was a slight thud on the ground. Both looked over toward the main entrance to the Great Hall only to see Draco’s back and a little black box lying on the ground. Slowly, Harry walked over to the box, picked it up, and opened it. Inside sat two silver rings: both slightly thick silver banded with an emerald and a ruby on each.
“Okay, before you do that I need to know a few things right now. Is he more than three months pregnant?”
“Good morning, boys. I’ve brought you some- Great Merlin! What are you doing on the floor, Draco?! Get up! Get up this instant! It’s not good for you to be on the floor! You could catch a cold or something down there! And Harry, how could you allow him to do this to himself and the baby? I thought you were watching him more carefully. Are either of you listening to me? Boys? Boys?!”
Harry stared at his husband with an open mouth and wide eyes. It was his birthday. It was not slave-over-a-hot-stove day. Without a word, Harry stood and walked to their bedroom. He lay down on his side of their bed, facing away from the door. Footsteps could be heard on the stairs a few moments later. He ignored Draco as he tried to talk to him and sweet talk him into responding.
“Yes, my Lord.” He kissed the hem of his cloak once more, then back-pedalled to his spot in line once more.
Harry nodded to Molly and went into his bedroom. Draco was sucking on some ice chips there, holding Narcissa’s hand. He lifted the camera up to show Draco, silently asking permission. Draco rolled his eyes but nodded. Harry snapped a picture or two, making sure Narcissa was in it. He knew Draco would love the picture later even if he couldn’t appreciate it now. He floated the camera in front of them as he took a picture of Draco in the rocking chair in the nursery with Harry kneeling at his side. He wished he’d thought of pictures earlier in the pregnancy. That would have been nice.
“My dear boys, my dear sweet boys,” she murmured, tears gathering in her eyes. She was just about to move forward and hug Harry to her when the door burst open and Dumbledore walked in.
Dr. Morris put her hands up in a defensive posture. “Okay, okay, keep your knickers on. Let me go get the supplies I can do them both at once, it will be easier.” She left the room, mumbling about crazy people and their messed up lives. When she came back, she had a small tray floating behind her with several vials, some empty and some not, on it. She set it on a spare counter. “Blaise, you take this one. Only half the dosage that’s in there please. Thank-you. Now you Harry, you take the other half. Good, just set that here. Now then, I will need a bit of hair from McKay, so while the Veratiserum works into your systems, I’ll cut a lock… just… here.” She snipped a few hairs from McKay’s head. “Please, neither of you say anything to Blaise or Harry. I don’t want the potion in effect just yet so no talking either.”
“Still hours apart? Yes, Narcissa had a long labor as well. I’ll call her and Molly. They’ll want to be here and Narcissa can help with Draco.” He turned to make the floo calls, allowing Draco’s mother access immediately. She went straight to her son, cooing to him as he awoke. She rubbed his belly and murmured bits of fluff and nothingness to him as he rubbed his cheek against her hand.
“Draco, look at me. Look at me. The public needs to know sooner rather than later. Your child is also Pott- Harry’s child. This is something you will have to deal with for the rest of your life. It will grow up in the spotlight just as he did once he re-entered the Wizarding World. It will be out there for everyone to see and know about. Maybe not physically,” he rushed to assure as Draco drew in on himself. The worry and despair from the younger wizard called to Harry, who reappeared once more to hug his husband. “Potter will be there to help you through this. He won’t let anything happen to your child. There is no way he would. I will also be there. Understand?”
“What’s wrong Harry? What happened?” Draco asked, petting Harry’s head. After several gestures, he explained it to Severus. “He woke without me there and panicked. When he couldn’t find me in the room, he came out here and pushed his magic all over to look for me. That’s what woke you up Severus. Sorry. But, your storming out here made him break concentration so he couldn’t realize I was only in the loo. I’ve gotten up to go every night this week. I’m okay, see? I’m perfectly fine.”
“Like the fact that Harry wasn’t moved for training and Malfoy’s not in the infirmary, you mean?” Hermione asked, having regained her breath once more. Five, yes all five, sets of eyes looked upon her shocked. “We were thinking, maybe you only said Harry had been moved. Maybe he was still in the castle. We couldn’t figure out why he would be taken from Hogwarts when it’s the safest place and Moody came here last year. Why couldn’t that happen again this year?”
Another bite on his shoulder brought him out of his thinking just before a single finger tapped across the tip of his nose. “I know, I know,” Draco mumbled. “I’m thinking too much. Does it help if I told you I was thinking of you?” Harry tightened his arms around his waist slightly in response. “There, see? It’s not as if I were thinking about Charms or Severus.” Although he couldn’t hear it, he knew Harry was growling. His suspicions were confirmed when Harry bit the back of his neck lightly, but stayed there instead of releasing as he did with his neck.
“Yeah, but it’d be nicer if Harry were here to enjoy it as well,” he grumped as they entered their Transfiguration classroom. They were given instructions and then left to their own devices. As seventh years, they were expected to be able to do their work quickly and quietly, and fights and things were not tolerated at all. As this class was with the seventh year Ravenclaws, nobody had anything to worry about. The two houses got on well enough together, which means they were neither friendly nor hostile with each other.
It was weird to hear the man refer to himself by name. It took a second for them to actually pay attention to what was being said by the unconscious man.
Harry was standing in an instant, his hand outstretched toward his Potions Professor. Draco seemed to be the only one to understand this action, because he grabbed Harry’s non-lifted arm and pleaded with him. “Please don’t, Harry! Don’t hurt him! He’s just worried about me. He doesn’t understand what’s happened these last five months. Please, don’t hurt him. I want you to stay here, with me. You can’t do that if you hurt him. They’ll take you away from me. Don’t leave me.”
Harry fell backwards, away from the bed Lucius had been laying on. His mouth was open as if he had cried out, but no sound was released. He turned on his side, breathing harshly and panting. When Madam Pomfrey moved to help him, he fended her off. He needed to help Snape. No matter how much he hated these two men, they were everything to Draco. It was vital that he help them, since he was the only one who could. Slowly, he got back to his feet and moved to Snape.
While Hermione conjured two chairs for her and Ron, Draco and Harry talked over what they would tell the rest of the Gryffindor Trio. It didn’t take the two newcomers long to figure out that Harry couldn’t speak for some reason and that they had worked out a language using motions to communicate.
Harry just groaned. He flopped back on the bed and tried to suffocate himself with a pillow. Mumbling something, he burrowed into the covers to hide from the cruel and embarrassing world.
conscious and we do have guests! Who are now traumatized, as am I. Surely Severus has a bedroom you could both use? I thought you had more decorum than that.”
He’d also started having cravings, but they changed so fast. He wasn’t sure what to take to his godson to get him in a good mood. One time, he’d brought pickles and mayonnaise only to send the blonde into a fit of vomiting at the smell. Draco had apologized profusely, but he’d learned his lesson – no foodstuffs unless he was specifically asked.
“How dare you imply that I sleep around with men and don’t know my own child’s father!” Harry yelled at the same time. “I’ve only had sex with one person and that’s Draco Malfoy!”
“Potter-Malfoy,” Draco automatically corrected. “Can you blame him, Severus? He’s scared of what everyone will think of him, say about him. He’s different enough without being this powerful.”
“Thank you Dr. Johansen.” Harry stood and led her back to the kitchens. “Blaise, may I speak with you?” Blaise wiped his hand on a towel, took some more ham off the burner, and excused himself. Harry led him to a room off the kitchens and put up a silencing charm. “I don’t want Dr. Mitchsens in this house. In fact, I want his memory erased of this ever happening. I don’t like him. He’s here because I am… was Harry Potter. He only wants this job for bragging right and I don’t believe he’ll remain quiet about this.”
“On a path… Nope, not anymore.” He stopped and started looking around. “The path is gone. It just disappeared.”
“Crap,” he muttered. Thus began the task of cutting it down to a simple, short paragraph. Once it was down to five lines, Draco was satisfied. He’d told Harry of his desire to have their own vows at the wedding, and hoped his fiancé had thought of something before they put him to sleep. The wedding was to be in… three hours now. Everything had been taken care of. Even as he sat there, house elves were cooking their feast for six. He had left the wedding cake decision up to Severus. The clothing and hair accessories had been taken care of by McGonagall. Madam Pomfrey had had their rings taken care of. Everything except bathing and dressing, and waking Harry up, had been taken care of.
“Let’s go to the library and work on our projects. Lunch is over.” They left with the Patil twins, Dean, and Seamus to head to the library. Once there, Seamus and Dean stopped to ask Madam Pince where books on dragon’s blood would be so they could do some research. Padma and Parvati went straight to the back of the library to gossip. Hermione pulled Ron over to a table near the front, but enough back so as to be semi-private. “We surprised them last time, so Professor Dumbledore doesn’t know who’s there until we reach the door.”
" A silver stag bursts out of the tip of his wand, and it gallops up to Draco before dissipating. It takes a second for Draco to remember to close his mouth.
" he yells definitely. Silvery vapor shoots out from his wand, and he's so surprised at him actually doing something that he immediately drops it. Exhaustion runs through him, suddenly and he hunches over, breathing hard.
"Why?" comes out of Draco's mouth, instead of any less personal question. Internally, Draco curses himself, and Harry even looks slightly uncomfortable at the question.
"Potential happy memories you could use," he explains. "It's pretty generic, but one of those might be able to work.
Draco deflates. He pulls back and bites his lip. His mouth feels like it's full of pop rocks. He doesn't want to agree, but what else can he do? It's
Is this what a panic attack is like? It's awful, Draco thinks, shutting his eyes tight. After a few moments, he opens them and looks down at his arm.
would have a field day. Besides, Draco still hates Harry. That's not going to change, no matter how many 'meetings' they have.
Draco feels touched that Harry noticed. He feels even more touched that Harry thinks he can actually produce this spell.
The person that Draco presumes is the head judge nods and writes something down as if they didn't know Draco's name. They ask him questions, and Draco really can't concentrate on what's being asked. His brain goes into autopilot, answering the questions without thinking. He tells the judges about his life and how he grew up around the Dark Arts.
His father's trial seems to go faster than his mother's but Draco still doesn't pay attention. In the end, his father gets one year in Azkaban — in the new non-Dementor portion. The thought of his father going to prison at all makes his stomach flop. Still, when the courtroom clears and him and his mother are allowed to talk to his father, he doesn't know what to say.
"My aunt," he manages to say, and Harry's eyes flash with slight recognition. Still, he elaborates, "Bellatrix Lestrange. Who is my aunt. And the Death Eater. Yeah."
"Er," Draco says, gesturing to Harry. Nervousness explodes in his stomach, and he can feel a drop of perspiration appear across his forehead. All he can think is,
Harry's quiet, and Draco feels triumphant, but he doesn't know what he's won. Harry not wanting to continue their lessons after just a few times? Harry going back to hating him and them having the bitter rivalry they had when they were in school?
Draco quickly goes over the pros and cons of just ignoring Harry — he wouldn't have to talk to anybody, just like he wants, but Harry might think he's rude and then they'd go back to disliking each other.
It's scary to him, that he lost his grip on his emotions. They slammed into him in a way he hasn't let them since his fifth year.
"Shut up," Draco says, standing up and brushing his pants off with his hands. His heart is beating so fast with the thought of him kissing Harry. It's like he can feel it on his lips, as if it were real. It's so
Draco doesn't know when he sank to the ground, but he's staring at the floor of his father's study and breathing hard. The remnants of pain from nearly two years ago are still coursing through his body, and he can feel moisture slide down his cheek. He's not sure if it's sweat or tears, but he keeps his gaze away from Harry's and wipes it away with his sleeve.
Harry stands up across from Draco and pulls out his wand. With just a slight hesitation, he exclaims, "
"Can I still come over next week?" Harry asks. Draco thinks that he might start crying if he looks up at him.
"Okay," Draco says. He brings his wand out from his pocket and can feel a warmth spreading through him. He's thankful that Potter bothered to return his wand; it feels
Draco lets out a breath that he didn't realize he had been holding. Something settles in him, a feeling of hopelessness that has been living within him for the past year. It's how he felt, especially, when he was at home. There were Dementors all around his house at all times; they came with the Dark Lord.
He scrawls on the parchment, leaning on his father's desk to have a surface to write on. It's a good beginning. He's not entirely sure what he actually wants to say. There's a lot he
So Potter's owl arrives, swooping in through the open window. At least, he assumes that it's Potter's owl; Draco is slightly surprised by it — a tawny owl flies through the window and he thought Potter had a snowy owl. And then he cringes because
He tells them about him taking the Dark Mark when he was sixteen, and he wants to build up his walls so badly. He wants to say that he didn't really care about it, or that it was his choice or anything to save him the embarrassment of saying his true feelings. He knows, though, that it could be that the difference between him getting locked up and him going free.
His mother frowns again, and she makes her way over to his bed. Mentally, Draco prepares defenses to avoid any questions she might ask him. He doesn't really think that his mother would try and read his mind, but still. His mind goes blank. He doesn't want a long conversation about the war and about his feelings.
"Just, try to think of something happy," Harry says, in that same soft tone. It irritates Draco further. "Something, that in utter darkness that Dementors bring, could get you to see the light."
"Just, think about your trial, and how it felt knowing that you're getting to go," he demands. "I saw your eyes when she said the verdict. I saw that you were
Seeing Harry had thrown him off. Draco spends the next several days holed up in his bedroom, exiting only for necessities. He doesn't know why he's reacting in such a way. It's childish really — but that's exactly how Harry made him feel. Like he was a child again.
"It's not eight o'clock yet," Draco notes, shooting Potter a glare. He shrugs, standing up straighter.
"Well, I had a decent teacher to learn how to produce a Patronus, so we can switch if you want," Harry offers. It's an easy out, but Draco's appreciative of it and he nods.
"Here," he says, holding it out to Draco. Draco looks to see Harry offering him a bar of chocolate. "It's medicinal. Against Dementors." When Draco doesn't take it, Harry sighs. "It's stupid, I know, since we're not using a Dementor, but when I was learning, my… instructor… gave me a lot of chocolate, so."
"You may want to brace yourself," Draco offers, pointing his wand. He's still standing, while Potter grips the arms of the chair he's sitting in. Potter's face drops, and Draco knows that Potter knows what he's about to do. He does it anyway. "
"For bringing you here," Harry replies. Draco focuses on a particularly tough section of his steak, staying quiet. "I forgot about our sixth year."
"Nice that you can forget," Draco says before he can think about the words. He bites his tongue, his mouth feeling bitter.
Draco doesn't have an answer. He's terrible at this, and he's sure that he's not the only one who knows it.
. He's supposed to be that first. "I've had a shit week, and…" Harry lets out a long breath. "I just wanted to see my friend and pretend everything is normal."
Merlin. Draco can't even get away from Potter and all his glory when he specifically goes to one of the most secret spots in all of Hogwarts.
"Then why did you come?" Draco asks, and he doesn't mean for it to sound as harsh as it does, but really. Draco honestly is over it. He's over his heart not listening to his mind, and his heart wanting to — to
Slowly, Draco opens his eyes again and his mother is looking at him, probably trying to see what Draco's feeling, but Draco looks down at his lap.
Draco has nothing to say. The memory of Potter in his house still hangs in his head, etched onto his brain like a nightmare he can't stop. He's pretty sure that memory is uncomfortable for them both.
And then he laughs a little bit more. And he's probably freaking Harry out, just a little bit, but he can't stop laughing. He laughs until his ribs hurt, and he has to double over.
, really? To date Harry fucking Potter, who's dating Hogwarts' ex-golden girl, because he's Hogwarts' ex-golden boy,
"Did you love Dad?" Draco blurts out, not at all the question he wanted to ask. His mother hesitates, and Draco has no idea why he's asking her for love advice.
He wants to answer Potter's question, he does, but something is making his mouth stay shut. He's not sure if he'd ever have an answer, anyway. He's not quite sure he understands the question anyway.
"I think that's enough for you, today," Harry says, and Draco's chest is still heaving a bit, so he agrees with a nod.
"Maybe it doesn't," he replies, looking down at his lap. There's a sharp pain behind his eyes, and Draco thinks that him crying would just be the cherry on top of a fantastic evening.
Harry comes more prepared than Draco. They go to the study again, and as soon as the door closes, Harry's pulling out a long piece of parchment.
"No offense, but why should I believe you?" Draco says, trying to keep his voice as level as possible. He thinks it wavers a little. "Of course she would forgive
Draco flinches and he hates himself and he wants to curl up upon himself and sink into the ground because he
"Your father and I would both like you to be there," she says next. Draco's stomach drops. While he had been trying to maintain some sense of normalcy after the war, it was all from the comfort of his own house. Going to his parents' trials would mean leaving the house. It would mean being under everyone else's scrutiny. He's not too pleased at that idea.
Harry's a good listener. Draco feels bad, putting a whole bunch at him at once, but Harry doesn't seem to mind. It's nice.
"Yes," Harry says, and Draco didn't think it would be that easy. Harry frowns, looking thoroughly confused. "I mean, no. I mean
"You're not," Harry says, cutting Draco off. He looks adamant about it, and somehow that makes Draco angrier.
He doesn't pay much attention to the trial itself. He sits next to his father and tries to avoid everyone's eyes that he can feel crawling all over him. He even avoids Harry, who's in the audience, a few rows over from Draco, and who tries to catch his eye.
"I'll owl you," he says, shifting. Draco nods, gripping his wand tighter. There's a slight warmth filling him, as if he was missing a part of himself. He watches Harry go before turning back to look at the burnt items around him.
get forgiveness. At the same time, though, he doesn't think he could do it. That's another thing Harry doesn't understand; not everyone is a brave Gryffindor who doesn't care about what could come of them doing something rash. Draco is
"Of course," he says after a moment, turning to Draco and giving him a little smile. He takes his hand out of his pocket and Draco was right — he's holding his wand. Draco flinches and shuts his eyes as Potter points it towards him. This is a ruse. Potter is going to kill him now. Draco braces himself to die, but Potter says, instead, "This is yours."
, but when I got close to dementors, I heard my mother dying, so I used that against them and turned it into something good."
"So, Occlumency," Potter says as they enter the Malfoys' study. Draco turns around to see him looking around at the walls of books. Draco raises his eyebrows.
"I'm sorry," Harry says, once again. Draco wants to make him shut up. "I should've thought this through more. Maybe we don't work as more than friends but… Can we stay friends?" Harry asks, sounding hopeful. Draco makes himself nod, but that's just as painful. How is he supposed to just forget that he likes Harry as more than a friend? How is he supposed to just move on and just be friends with Harry?
So he makes the split-second decision to be truthful and he says that he was scared. He had been terrified, actually, and he had spent his sixth year with an impossible task. He had spent the entire year in torture and he had to do the impossible, and he nearly killed himself trying to figure out what to do that year, and he couldn't even do it, and he —
and she'll never come back, but still — good. He had fifteen years without her. He'd like some more.
for the better part of a year. It's not such a great home, but there's no denying it. It was his home.
how thick his voice sounds. His mother gets to him quickly, and Draco doesn't remember the last time he got a hug from his mother, but it feels
Of course, a war couldn't make his mother act any less proper. No matter what, his mother always had to put on a dress. She always had to do her hair and wear makeup. When he was little, Draco had asked his mother why she always went to the effort of dressing up, and she told him that they were Malfoys — appearances made up half of how people perceived them.
When Draco doesn't respond, Potter continues in a rush. "I know that the war is over, and I know that I will almost definitely never have to use again in my life, but a part of me can't help but think that maybe I need to —" he trails off, and Draco turns to face Potter for the first time, to really focus on him. He's looking straight ahead, not letting Draco see any emotions that might be present on his face. His hand is in his pocket — Draco realizes that it's probably curled around his wand.
"Oh," Harry says. Draco looks over to him to see him watching the spot where his Patronus was. "What memory did you use?" he asks, and his voice sounds wet.
He doesn't remember them saying goodbye, or Harry leaving his house, but he remembers going to bed and one thought resonating through his head. He would hate to have someone look into his mind right now, because he's usually quite good at clearing it, but he can't stop thinking one thing over and over again. He can't stop thinking about
"Are you okay?" Harry asks, because Draco probably looks like a real dumbass, staring at Harry with his mouth agape, not saying a single word.
Draco blinks, and Harry's hand appears in front of him. He swallows hard and makes the split-second decision to take it.
. He's a coward, really, when it comes down to it. Maybe, eventually, he could make himself to it, but not yet. Not now.
"Are you sure it's nothing?" Harry asks, all calm and collected. Draco's starting to wonder why he thought liking Harry was a good idea in the first place.
He looks over to his right, and Harry is there, right next to him, the same way Draco thinks he'll be for the rest of their lives. The thought makes Draco feel sappy, and he knows he probably has the dumb 'in-love' look Harry insists he always gets. Draco takes a moment, in the silence of the night, to watch Harry's chest move up and down and his boyfriend sleeps peacefully.
"I wanted to see my friend, sorry?" he replies, and it makes Draco feel even guiltier, because it's not Harry's fault for his heart's own stupidity. They're
Harry looks up at Draco, and there's uncertainty in his eyes. The look almost makes Draco want to laugh, but he doesn't. His mouth tastes bitter.
"Thanks," he says, and he feels like a lame teacher. All his teacher gave him were curses. He doesn't really have a clue what he could give.
Draco's actually surprised that the spell worked, at first. And then he's sucked into Harry's memories.
"You saved my life with it," Potter says, filling the open air with his words. His statement hangs in the air, lingering, before hitting Draco head on.
A part of Draco hates that he's noticing the small things like that. Another part of Draco is just wondering if Harry is okay.
that he grew up with a lot more than other people, but it was still stressful, trying to live up to his parents' expectations. He rants about how he doesn't really feel any remorse that his father's in jail, and he hates that he doesn't care.
For some odd reason, Draco doesn't want that more than he wants to not talk, so he parrots back, "Hello."
"I'm sorry for asking," Draco says, cringing, and he really is. "I should've thought it through more, I just —"
chair — but he doesn't say anything. His father isn't here, after all. He would just never sit there himself.
"The emotions are all still there, but they're not mine," he says, slowly becoming numb. Straightening his back, he looks at Harry, but he doesn't feel anything towards him. It's all nothing. "If you want to see what it's like, you can use the spell on me, yourself."
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco sees Harry taking his father's vacant seat. He keeps his gaze straight ahead, though. He'd rather not make any conversation right now.
Harry comes over the next Thursday, as always, but it feels all wrong. Before they decided to ruin their friendship, it was easy to have Harry over. They didn't need to talk much, they just
Abandoning his breakfast and promising to clean it up later, he heads to his family's library. If he's going to attempt to teach Harry Occlumency, he might as well learn more about it. His family library is extensive, with topics from Quidditch to potions.
Draco hugs Harry back, and it feels so utterly natural to breathe him in, to wrap his arms around him tightly as if he never has to let go of him. It doesn't last as long as Draco would like, though, because all of a sudden, Harry jumps away from Draco quickly. His eyes fix on something behind Draco, and Draco whips around to come face to face with his mother.
Harry finishes, and Draco fidgets in his seat when the judges say they need a minute to deliberate. He expects Harry to leave his seat, but a quick glance to his right tells Draco that Harry's still sitting there, looking as stressed as Draco feels.
After a few moments, Draco makes himself look up. He should cover the rest of the check and leave. It only takes him a few moments to count the Galleons Harry's left and Draco's stomach turns over.
Draco makes a humming sound in his throat before turning and walking back towards the study. Judging by the sound of footsteps behind him, Potter's following him.
you for the first five years of our schooling." Harry makes a little noise of disagreement, so Draco continues, "And not just that, but to your friends, too. To Granger and Weasley. I
After taking several deep breaths, Draco decides that he's just going to ignore it and try to have a nice, normal dinner. With any luck, he won't have to talk to Rosmerta at all. With one last deep breath, he exits the bathroom. He spots Harry in a booth in a little corner of the pub and makes his way over to him quickly, a fake smile on his face.
Draco stares at the wand in Potter's hand, recognizing it, like Potter said, as his own. Furrowing his brows, he takes it, looking as Potter stands up.
He just wants everything to turn back to the way it was. Maybe he can even forget he ever liked Harry. That'd be nice.
Harry makes a little hurt sound, and it hurts Draco to know that it's true. He knows that he probably should talk to Rosmerta and that if he does, he probably
Draco's ruined it. He can feel it, even without talking to Harry for another week. When Harry arrives at Draco's house, right on schedule, everything feels
After the silence goes on for long enough for it to roar in Draco's ears, Harry finally whispers, "I forgave you for that a long time ago. If I held any burden, it would be too much for me. I'd like to be your friend, Draco. Not your enemy."
Now, everything feels stiff and awkward, and Draco just wants to do this lesson and never see Harry again. That'd make him feel better.
"That…" Harry says, cutting through the silence. Draco averts his eyes, because he doesn't want or need Harry's pity. "That
Harry's silent. Draco wants to say anything to break the silence, to laugh it off as if it's nothing. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco sees Harry move and pull something out of his pocket.
"Do you want to talk about it?" his mother asks. There must be something showing on his face and Draco doesn't know what, because he's feeling about a million things at once, and he doesn't want to talk about any of them with his mother.
Draco turns his head to face Harry just as his mother approaches. Harry gets up, nodding at her, and as soon as Harry's gone, Draco's mother sits down next to him.
Draco doesn't remember getting dressed or going to the Ministry, but the next thing he knows, he's sitting in a chair in his best suit, with three dozen people staring down at him.
, for Merlin's sake! — so he instead shoots him a deep glare, hoping it conveys everything he's feeling. The war is over, yes, but the two of them aren't
He knows it's his turn to be the teacher now, and he takes a second to slow his breathing and collect his thoughts.
wanted to learn that way, he must be some type of masochist. Draco's bones ache just from thinking about it.
Harry closes his eyes, and Draco immediately thinks he did something wrong. After a few beats of Harry just standing there, he manages to get out, "My girlfriend broke up with me."
"I —" Draco says, forcing his mouth open. He doesn't really know what to say. It was no big deal? It was a little bit of a big deal for Draco. He could've
A week later, Draco drags himself out of bed, puts on a suit, and faces both of his parents for the first time in weeks. His father gives him a curt nod, and his mother gives him a hug that he can't make himself return, and they apparate to the Ministry of Magic together.
His mother's trial is first, and Draco makes his mind go blank. He doesn't want to know about all of the bad things his mother did, and frankly, he doesn't care. What does catch his attention, though, is when Harry himself goes to testify. To Draco's shock, Harry tells the judges about how Draco's mother saved his life — when he went to the Forest to confront the Dark Lord, Harry pretended to be dead in front of the Death Eaters, and Draco's mom went along with the lie.
feel like home to you?" his mother asks. Draco's not sure how to answer. He's not sure he'd like his answer. He's not sure he'd like to face the truth.
"Yeah, okay," Harry agrees, but Draco can see him look slightly disappointed and try to hide it. He stands up and walks over to Draco. They stand like that, face-to-face, for a few awkward moments before Harry claps a hand on Draco's shoulder.
"I'm sorry," Harry says for the third time. Draco resists the urge to roll his eyes. "I know it's probably hard for you to think about —"
"I almost killed you, and you repaid me by lying to your entire family to save my life," Harry says quietly. He gives another small shrug as Draco steals a glance at him again.
"I got out," she tells him, in an attempt to reassure him. It's a nice try, but he suddenly thinks of his father. His father got jail.
Trying to slow his heart down, Draco leaves the study to head towards the front. He wrenches open the door to see Potter standing there. Perfect Potter. Merlin.
"Hi," he whispers, and his mother closes the distance between them by wrapping Draco in a hug. The hug is different, less intense, than Draco's hug with Harry, but he appreciates the comfort just as much.
The doorbell rings on Thursday night at seven-thirty in the evening and Draco almost has a heart attack. In an attempt to stave off the boredom, he had spent the evening holed up in his father's study, reading books about herbology, before the doorbell took him out of his dull glaze. He didn't even know they
Harry shrugs. Draco notes the change in his tone when he starts talking about his own experience learning to produce a Patronus, and he itches to ask more. Instead, though, he grabs the chocolate.
"What?" Draco demands, furrowing his brows at her expression. She shakes her head and shrugs, but she still looks shocked.
Draco looks back at Harry, and he doesn't like the pitying expression on his face. Draco doesn't like the conversation at all. Why did he want to learn something that is causing him to talk about his emotions? He really regrets it.
The second letter comes later than he expected. He expected it to come soon after the trials, because Harry saw him in person. It comes a week later, when Draco's once again eating breakfast, but Draco's glad for the distraction nonetheless.
It's become an easier thing, to dissociate from his emotions. It's useful, of course, in order to properly block his mind, but it's also nice to not feel something for once. When he starts to care too much about things, when he starts to think too much about the past, or about the war, it's easy to just…
"So that's what you're not supposed to do," Draco finally says, wiping his face again and forcing a little chuckle as he looks up to face Harry. Harry's frowning at him, and Draco recognizes the concern, but he doesn't want to discuss it.
"So let's keep talking about it!" Draco exclaims, throwing down his knife and fork and looking up at Harry. Anger is coursing through him and he should probably just accept the apology and ask not to talk about it and
—" Draco says, and he feels like he doesn't really mean it, and he's afraid to complete the spell. It might not work. He wants it to work, so badly.
He doesn't think anyone else will send him letters, so he unrolls the scroll attached to its little leg and flattens it out, reading every word carefully.
"Draco," Harry says, and Draco feels like his heart is going to beat out of his chest. That, or he's going to throw up. "Did you just ask me out on a date?"
"It depends on what you mean by avoiding," Draco replies curtly. His mother lets out a deep exhale and walks over to the kitchen table, into Draco's line of vision. Draco looks pointedly down at his coffee.
"You know Occlumency," Potter says, speaking once again. Draco bites his tongue. Yes, he knows Occlumency. His bones still ache from learning it. He can still remember his Aunt Bellatrix shouting at him for getting it wrong. He can remember her wand in his face, her punishing him whenever he let something slip.
"I don't care what you were," Harry says, his chin up. Draco believes him, but that's not what matters.
"Do you want to do more?" Draco offers. He's hoping that Harry says no, because he honestly doesn't want to
Harry's quiet, giving Draco enough time to stew in his emotion. When the quiet goes on for just long enough — long enough that Draco has the urge to open his mouth and say more stupid things, Harry says, "I forgive you. I forgave you for that a long time ago."
When Draco thinks about it, it's actually quite insane. There's no way that him and Harry should've ended up together. It just doesn't make sense. But still, somehow, Draco thinks that they were meant to be.
"Owl me, okay?" Harry says, and Draco doesn't know what else to do but nod. "I'd like to do this again."
"I'm not," Harry says quickly, cutting Draco off. Draco bites his tongue, so hard he thinks he draws a little bit of blood.
," Draco says quietly, thinking about Harry, about kissing Harry, about having a relationship with him.
"You ready?" Draco asks, brandishing his wand. If this is their last lesson, he wants to give it his all. He owes Harry that, at least. Harry nods. "
Because there he is. And there Harry is. And there their lips are, touching. Draco can't make himself pull out.
in front of the judges. The head judge nods, and he knows that he's dismissed as everyone starts to stand up and walk away. It takes him a second to get up, but once he does, he doesn't even have time to move before Harry's flinging his arms around his neck.
"Are we still on for Thursday?" Harry asks, wiping his hands on his pants. His mother clicks her tongue from beside Draco, but he ignores it.
"Er," Draco says, trying to think of what he would want to hear if he got broken up with. "I'm sorry?" he says, it sounding more like a question. "It'll be okay and there are plenty of other fish in the sea?"
"Maybe we should call it a night," he suggests. They've probably been practicing for less than half an hour, but Draco already itches to go to the safety of his room and his bed. He's been too social.
"Yeah," Draco replies, trying to sound upbeat. He gives Harry the most real smile he can muster, and then, together, they walk into the Three Broomsticks.
His mother sits on the edge of his bed and runs her fingers through his hair. "It'll be okay," she whispers to him. Draco realizes that he hasn't even acknowledged her presence. He's been too busy freaking out. He appreciates her trying to comfort him, it just doesn't work.
Harry leans in, and their second kiss makes Draco's heart race and his head spin and it's every bit as perfect as their first kiss.
"If you ever want to talk about it, you can always owl me," Harry says finally, and Draco appreciates the gesture. He'll probably never take him up on it, though.
Draco looks over at Harry, who's giving him a light smile. Draco drops his hand and he feels slightly sick.
He goes silent. He can't talk anymore. Blinking back the tears, Draco tries to make his mind go blank, he tries to detach himself from his feelings, just as if he was talking to the Dark Lord again and hiding his fear from him.. He can't do this. He'd rather just go be jailed.
"How about you sit down?" he asks, lightly touching Harry's arm. "Order whatever you want for me, I trust you," Draco says, still trying to plaster on a smile. "I need to use the bathroom."
Or maybe he does. Because he was lonely, and he was jealous of Harry's friendships, genuine, not-bought friendships, and he was upset that he was rebuffed by Harry, and he was sick of his father telling him that he should've been friends with the Boy-Who-Lived.
He heard that his aunt died in the war. Theo had told him before Draco managed to shrug him off. Good. It feels weird to know that she's
"I don't understand," Harry says, averting his eyes from Draco and clenching his jaw. "I can't clear my mind. Why can't I clear my mind?"

Harry, though, doesn't notice. Instead, a smile spreads across his face, one that makes Draco's stomach do a little belly flop. "I did it," he repeats.

Draco sees Harry out, and they share an awkward hug in the doorway that Draco can't help but hope will turn more natural in the future. The future… Once Harry is gone, Draco can't help but lean against the wall of his entrance hall, still not able to stop smiling.
Draco. Draco's going to go on the chair and Harry's going to get up and list off of the awful things Draco has done to him, starting with stealing Longbottom's ball-thing in their first year, and culminating in him
"I'm sorry," he says, sincere. "But that's true. It sucks." And now Harry looks guilty, which isn't what Draco wanted at all. He doesn't want Harry's guilt, or pity, or anything. "It doesn't matter now, anyway," he says, and suddenly his good mood is diminished. "I just don't really know how to teach it." Harry nods, and his guilty expression isn't gone, which Draco doesn't like.
He doesn't get to use any of the methods he learned about in his books, but that's okay. By the time Harry leaves, they already make places to practice at the same time next week.
They're both in the Room of Hidden Things, except it's more the Room of Burned Things now. Scorched books are spread out around them, now-black pieces of wood are crumbling, and ash litters the ground. It's slightly sad, for Draco; this room has been his
When the battle was first over and Draco got cleared by the Ministry of Magic to go home, he immediately cleared his room out in a fit of rage. The vanishing spell had never gotten so much use since he was practicing it in his fourth year. He had left everything but his bed, and then he had crawled into it and cried. He had cried because of the war, because his friends, however fake, had
What is he supposed to do? Should he just go right back out to Harry and say he's sick and wants to go home? That seems too much like a cop-out, even to him. Should he tell Harry that, hey, the Three Broomsticks isn't really a great spot for a date for him because
"Sure," Harry says easily. Draco nods and he feels like a coward as he flees towards the restroom in the far back of the building.
know. Except, Harry is being slightly weird, too. It's not just Draco being overly worried, he's pretty sure. Harry's a little bit stiffer. His smile doesn't really reach his eyes when he says hello to Draco.
"I was thinking we should practice with me again," Harry says, his voice sounding small. "To just make sure I can still do it, you know?"
think. That's just how it is. I'm always going to be a Death Eater and you're always going to be the
Harry picks him up the following Thursday and Draco is buzzing. He takes in Harry's outfit — just a simple t-shirt and jeans. It makes him relieved; he has no idea where Harry is taking him, so the fact that Harry's dressed just as casual as Draco is reassuring.
Potter's owl arrives in the middle of his breakfast and it's a welcome distraction. He's sitting at his dining room table alone and eating some eggs that he half-burnt because he's awful at cooking spells and he'll never admit it, but he's actually
Draco flinches again as all these thoughts run through his head. It's scaring himself how much he understood from that one question. Or maybe he's thinking too much into Harry's tone.
"How do I know if they really love me?" Draco asks. He hates how his voice cracks, and he blinks his eyes shut.
it is between them. He doesn't particularly want to ask. A small part of his brain feels triumphant that Harry sounds hurt as well. That's what he deserves for turning the date sour in the first place, that part thinks. The larger part of his brain doesn't want Harry to hurt at all.
," he says, and it sounds weak, even to him. Nothing comes out of his wand. He closes his eyes, and he doesn't see Harry walk over next to him, but he feels Harry push his arm down.
"Hi," Harry says, giving Draco a small smile. It makes Draco feel slightly melty, and he thinks about how good it is to finally have someone who's a real, true friend.
"She probably has forgiven you, if you want to talk to her," Harry says. Draco thinks that he might bite a hole in his tongue like this.
Third: he thinks he knows Draco's habits. He thought that Draco would roll his eyes at that 'Boy-Who-Lived' remark. Well, Draco
"Who taught you in the first place?" Draco asks suddenly. It's him trying to get the conversation away from him, but he's also curious.
"That was good," Harry says. When Draco looks back up at him, he's beaming. "I wouldn't expect you to produce a corporeal Patronus, but if you met a dementor, you'd be okay, with that."
He grips his wand, holding it out, and his palm feels sweaty. His mind goes blank, and it's sort of ironic, because that's the thing that Harry's struggling with.
Draco wasn't expecting him to be that honest. It makes him feel a little bit grateful, because he might not have the best relationship with his parents, but he never had to hear them die.
"I know it's nothing fancy," Harry says with a shrug, still holding Draco's hand, "but I thought it'd be familiar so it'd be nice."
"I love you," he says out loud. It doesn't matter that Harry can't hear him, because Draco will say it again and again when he's awake. Besides, Draco knows that Harry knows that truth through and through.
Draco tries to hide his irritation that his mother doesn't know what his room had looked like. Typical of his parents to be so distant that they're not even sure if a drastic change is a change at all.
"Good, keep going," Harry encourages, and Draco braces himself. He thinks of the euphoria he had felt when the judge told him he was going to go free, and he thinks of the joy in Harry's eyes when he had heard the verdict.
Draco would like the floor to open up and swallow him. That, or a time machine that would let him go back and hit himself over the head
There's not even a signature. Draco hesitates before responding — what if Harry's upset at him for some reason? — before figuring that Harry was probably just in a rush when he wrote the letter.
"Wait," Harry says, pulling away. Draco's breathless. He gasps, but it feels like he can't get enough oxygen unless he kisses Harry again,
"Are you okay?" Harry asks, and the question is short of shocking to Draco. He tries to keep his surprise down as he continues to look ahead. He lies with a nod. Harry's silent.
She grabs his hand and squeezes it just as everyone makes a move to sit back down and his father's trial is about to start. Draco doesn't squeeze her hand back, he just turns his head to face the trial.
On the third or fourth day, there's a knock on his door. Before he can say "come in" — or "go away", like he was planning on doing — his mother turns the knob and enters.
Draco decides to not dwell on it. He has better things to dwell on, like Harry, and their upcoming lesson.
There's nothing. Draco's vision blinks out, and he's aware of Harry seeing what's happening in his mind. For a moment, his mind is blank, and Draco doesn't see anything.
sees it, and he admits that Draco had been a jerk when he was younger, yes, but Harry tells the judges how Draco was raised in an unhealthy environment, with his father being a Death Eater. It makes Draco slightly uncomfortable, to hear the truth of his childhood, but he supposes it's just that — the truth. Harry says how he saw Draco's fear and uncertainty up close, on the Astronomy Tower, and how he only took the Dark Mark and the job to protect his family. Draco didn't know that Harry saw all of that, he realizes, and it makes him feel strange, to know that Harry's seen in him probably his worst moment. Draco's stomach does a weird little somersault when Draco tells the judges that he didn't kill Dubmledore; that he probably never would have. Harry continues to talk about when Harry was brought to Malfoy Manor, with Hermione and Ron. Draco could have, Harry says, told everyone that he knew exactly who the three prisoners were — but he didn't. When Harry finishes talking about Malfoy Manor, Draco thinks he's done, but he adds on that, in a weird way, Draco being forced to assassinate Dumbledore saved Harry's life; when Harry disarmed him, months later, the Elder Wand switched allegiances and Harry defeated Voldemort because of it.
Draco forces himself to look up, shrugging Harry's hand off of his shoulder. There's a frown on Harry's face and his eyebrows are furrowed. Draco can't really tell what Harry's feeling right now because
"The concept is simple, but the act is hard," Harry says. "There are two different forms, a corporeal and an incorporeal. A corporeal is a fully formed Patronus, which is very difficult, so don't worry if it takes a while to conjure one." Harry starts pacing as he talks, and Draco stays still, following him with his eyes. "Now, the trick is that you have to think of a happy memory. One that's pure happiness." Harry finally pauses, and Draco blinks, digesting what Harry's said. "Would you like to try or would you like me to demonstrate?" he offers.
"You ready?" Harry asks. Draco nods, thinking about how soft Harry's hand is. In a moment, he's sucked into the still-unfamiliar darkness of Apparition. When he can see again, they're standing in front of an all-too-familiar building. Draco bites his tongue.
"It's not," he replies as he gets to the end of the list, and it's true, because he appreciates the gesture. He appreciates that Harry really cares about teaching him how to produce a Patronus. It's just — "None of these memories are really happy to me."
planning on that. He doesn't need any more attention than his family already gets. Him, a former Slytherin and Death Eater, being friends with Potter,
"Alright," he says instead, hoping none of his nerves shine through. Knowing his luck, they probably do.
Potter shifts in his seat. He's still not looking at Draco, but Draco can see his brows go forward for a second.
Eventually, his bodily needs had forced him to get up, and since then, he had tried to keep a stable schedule. He would get up and eat something every single day. He had tried to keep himself busy, reading books that he snuck to his room from his father's study, or wandering around the huge house he had grown up in but never really bothered to explore. He had tried to avoid his parents as best as he could, slipping into a different room if he ever saw a glance of them.
"I'm sorry," Draco says, taking extra caution to soften his tone. It's still surreal for him, having Harry as a friend. He does like it though, but his brain can't help but think that it could be one-sided. That thought scares him. But if Harry's coming to
