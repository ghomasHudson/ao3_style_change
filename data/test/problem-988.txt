“To be honest, I thought this whole thing was all part of a cunning scheme to weaken Potter and then humiliate him by dumping him in front of a bunch of people. Just saying.” Pansy confessed while we were chatting in the common room late one afternoon. Pansy was leaning against my shoulder and I’m sure it must have looked like we were a coupe to some people. I didn’t mind that Pansy was leaning against me, I still just saw her as a friend.
Draco was gently tracing his fingers my side, which made me shiver slightly. “That tickles-“ I said and giggled silently. Draco chuckled and smiled softly at me. “Sorry, I just like the feeling of your soft skin against my fingertips.” He said. Suddenly I remembered what Draco had said about Ron being the one freaking out and I had to ask. “Draco- Before we- You know-“ I started off and Draco raised an eyebrow at me but let me continue. “You asked if it had been Ron who freaked out. How did- How did you know it was him and not Hermione?” I asked silently and looked over at Draco whose fingers had now stopped moving. Draco slowly rubbed his neck with his other hand. “Well, you see-“ he started off and now it was my turn to raise an eyebrow at him. “I actually ran into Hermione last night; she was looking for you after you had stormed out of your common room. She looked upset and worried and asked if I had seen you. I explained to her that I hadn’t seen you since we parted ways in the study room but asked what was happening. She then told me that You and Ron got into an argument about us and that he hadn’t taken it very well-“ Draco trailed off and looked down at me with a sheepish smile. “So that’s how I knew what had happened between you and Ron. Draco’s eyes darkened slightly, and he clenched his fist. “If only I had been there to teach that
Walking to breakfast was less awkward now that everyone knew that I had spent the night in Draco’s bed doing more than just sleep. I was still a little embarrassed about it, but no one had mentioned me screaming Draco’s name followed by the words “I’m coming”.
A little while later, there was a knock on the cell door and Dumbledore’s face appeared in front of the glass. “I think it’s time we all have a little chat.” He said calmly and politely avoided looking directly at us. I picked up the cover and placed it over my lap as Harry sat down on the bed again as far away from me as he possibly could. I would be lying if I said that I didn’t feel hurt by the way Harry was acting, but it made sense. Once Harry had sat back down on the bed and wrapped himself in she sheets he pulled off the bed, Dumbledore entered the room and conjured himself a stool in front of the bed to sit on. “As you both have probably noticed, you have formed what we call a soul bond. You know belong to each other. Draco, as an Alpha, your top priority should always be Harry’s safety. And most importantly, you can never leave his side during his heat. Do you understand that?” Dumbledore asked quietly. I nodded and looked over at Harry who looked rather miserable to say the least. It pained me to see him like this. Harry had never asked for any of this to happen and he had already been through so much. “Yes, I understand that Sir.” From the corner of my eye I saw Dumbledore nod slowly. “Good, that’s good. Now then. Harry my boy, as much as it pains me to say this, know that it is nothing personal, it’s just how the dynamics work-“ Dumbledore sounded genuinely sorry and I understood why. Harry lifted his head slightly to look over at him. “Whatever it is, just spill it. It can’t possibly get any worse than it already has-“ He mumbled quietly and still refused to move any closer to me even though I offered him to wrap the cover around him so he wouldn’t get cold. Dumbledore cleared his throat before speaking. “Harry, as an Omega, your primary task is to serve your Alpha, in this case Draco, and make sure the linage continues, which means bearing children.” Harry yelped and looked terrified at Dumbledore. “But- I’m a guy? I can’t get pregnant, can I? None of this is making any sense-“ harry hid his face in his hands. I felt bad for Harry, he never asked for any of this. I reached out to comfort Harry, but he immediately moved away from me again. My heart sank in my chest and lowered my hand again. I wanted to make Harry realize that he meant the world to me and that I was terribly sorry for scaring him like that, I just didn’t know how, since he wouldn’t even talk to me. “Sir, do you think it would be possible that I could talk to Harry alone? There are some things I would like to talk to him about.” I asked politely and looked up at Dumbledore, who nodded slightly. “Very well. You are both free to leave this cell now. I will have Severus brew some suppressants for you Harry. They will help you through your next heat if you take them properly.” He said as he stood up and left.
some manners-“ He mumbled and gritted his teeth.
from your best friends?!” Ron yelled at me and I instinctively pulled my outstretched hand back. “Why are you getting so upset over this, Ron?” I asked, trying to stay calm, but the tears in my eyes had already started to run down my cheeks. “Because you literally fucked the enemy Harry!” The words stung. How could he say that? “Draco is
Once again Draco had possessively placed an arm around me. I don’t know why, but I felt proud of being held like that by Draco. He was mine and I was his. Suddenly it didn’t seem too overwhelming to face Ron at breakfast. I hated the idea of having to part ways with Draco, but I had to. Before I went to sit down at the Gryffindor table Draco leaned closer to my ear and whispered. “I’ll see you later Potter. Try not to miss me too much.” And sent me off by slapping my ass. I looked back over my shoulder and Draco sent me a wide grin before finding himself a seat at the Slytherin table.
When it was finally time to head out the butterflies in my stomach slowly started to wake up and my heart started racing as I walked down the hallways towards the study room. I arrived with a few minutes to spare, but that just gave me more time to try to figure out how I would like to approach this whole thing. After debating with myself for what felt like ages, I decided to just see where things went once Draco arrived and what he wanted from me. I walked over to the nearest table from the door and decided to sit down while waiting. It was now 11:59 pm, which meant that Draco was on his way and could arrive any second. Just like last time he arrived as soon as the hands reached 12:00 am. Seeing him again was felt like small fireworks inside my chest. I sent him a shy smile and waved softly. “So.. You wanted to see me again?” I asked silently and looked over at the door where Draco was leaned against he doorframe with his arms crossed across his chest. He just stood there with the most casual facial expression I had ever seen anyone make. “Yeah.. I guess I did?” He responded and slowly started walking towards me. His casual expression changed into a more confident smile that slowly turned into a soft smirk the closer to me he got. He stopped right in front of me and tilted his head slightly to the right while looking at me. “What’s the matter Potter? You seem a little out of it. I’m not making you nervous, am I?” he said as he gently grabbed my chin and lifted my head to make me look at him. “N-no.. Not at all.” I barely managed to get the words out without stuttering. My heart was racing in my chest and all I could think about was how badly I wanted him to kiss me again. I wanted to feel his lips on mine. “Kiss me.. Please?” I asked softly, still looking up at him. I could see his eyes spark for a second and it was clear that he was considering his next move. “And what if I don’t want to?” He teased and leaned in to teasingly pretend to kiss me before gently pulling away right before our lips met. “Please Draco.. I can’t think about anything else. I need you to kiss me again..” I pleaded and stretched to get closer to him. “You’re lucky that I think you’re cute, Potter.” He said and leaned back in, but this time he didn’t pull away right before our lips met. This time he kissed me for real. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and gently pulled him closer to me. I could tell that he wanted to kiss me too, because he didn’t resist when I pulled him closer. This kiss was much more passionate than the first one had been. I slowly stood up from the table making sure not to break the kiss while I got up. I think Draco understood where I was going with this because the next thing I know is Draco gently grabbing my shoulders and turning us slightly around backing us up towards the wall. Once we reached the wall the kiss had turned from passionate to straight up lustful. Draco elegantly slid my robe off of my shoulders and was now untying my tie. Meanwhile I was struggling with Draco’s tie, but he didn’t seem to care at all. I finally managed to get it untied and slid off his robe before fumbling with the buttons on his shirt. Draco didn’t seem to have any issues with unbuttoning my shirt at all. He let his hand slide up my chest as I finished unbuttoning his shirt. We paused for a second only to catch our breaths. I let my hands slowly run up and down Draco’s perfectly formed chest. Without hesitation Draco pulled away and broke the kiss. We were both panting, and I looked at Draco in confusion. “Did I do something wrong?” I asked silently. Draco shook his head and a small smirk spread across his lips. “No, not at all. I just got an idea.” He said as the smirk curving his lips grew bigger and bigger. “Do you trust me, Potter?” Draco asked and looked at me, his head slightly tilted. “Mhmm.” I barely managed to answer his question. I wanted more and kissing just wasn’t enough at this point. I noticed the sparks in Draco’s eyes when he asked me to close my eyes, which I more than willingly did. I gasped softly in surprise when I felt Draco’s lips on my left collarbone. He started kissing along both collarbones and slowly worked his way down my chest and onto my stomach. Draco had now reached the hem of my jeans and teasingly kissed my hipbone. I had to bite my lip to mask the small moans I so desperately wanted to let out. Draco effortlessly unbuttoned and unzipped my jeans end gently pulled them down. I wasn’t sure for how much longer I would be able to hold back my moans. Draco teasingly pulled on the hem of my boxers with his teeth. “What’s the matter, Potter? You’re looking rather tense.” Draco said and looked up at me from the floor. A confident smirk spread across his hips as he kept teasing me. Fighting the moans got harder and harder the more Draco teased me. “You’re r-really enjoying this, aren’t y-you?..” I managed to ask even though every time I tried to open my mouth there was a moan trying to escape. At last I decided that I didn’t care anymore, it had now gotten way too hard to hide my moans. As soon as the first moan escaped me, I quickly covered my mouth and felt the blood rise in my cheeks. I didn’t expect it to be that loud and it was so embarrassing to say the least. I heard Draco softly chuckle at my reaction. “Ha, that’s cute, Potter. You’re so much fun to tease.” He said and slowly started to pull on my boxers. Draco effortlessly pulled down my boxers. I instinctively looked away to hide my face that was just as red as a tomato by now. “Don’t be shy Potter, I want to see and everything. Don’t hide from me.” He said and gently grabbed a hold of my member and slowly started moving his hand up and down. I bit down on my lip hard and muffled a moan. I looked down at Draco who was smirking up at me as he kept moving his hand. I reached down to tangle my fingers in Draco’s soft hair and gently pulled on it. We were both breathing heavily, and I could see in Draco’s eyes that I wasn’t the only one wanting more.
Sorry for keeping you waiting but I ran into a good old fashioned writer's block ._.
After dinner we all sat back in the common room and continued talking until it was time to head to bed. We said goodnight and headed to our dorms. Ron kept nagging me about the note and it was honesty starting to make me angry. “Seriously Ron? Don’t you have anything better to do than nag me?” I snapped at him and realized immediately. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you..” I mumbled and changed into my pajamas before crawling into my bed. Ron just shrugged it off and apologized for nagging me and then we left at that. I could hear Ron’s breaths slow down and get heavy as he drifted off to sleep. I tossed and turned in my own bed, trying to decide whether to meet up with Draco at midnight or not. After tossing and turning for quite a while, I decided to meet up with Draco just to get this out of my system once and for all. I looked up at the clock on the wall in the dorm and the hands on the clock showed 11:45 pm, so I slowly and quietly crawled out of bed before getting dressed as quietly as I could, making sure not to wake anyone up as I left the dorm and the common room. I made my way downstairs and headed towards the courtyard. I could feel the butterflies flying around in my stomach. The closer to the tree I got, the wilder the butterflies got. I could just about see the giant clock from here and it showed 11:59 pm, which meant that Draco could be here any second now. I was so nervous, that I could feel my legs beneath me shaking. I took a deep breath and told myself that everything was okay and that I had nothing to be nervous about. And sure enough, just as the clock started to strike 12:00 am I saw a silhouette approaching the tree. His platinum blonde hair glistened in the moonlight and his eyes sparkled slightly in the dim light coming from the few lamps scattered around the courtyard. I noticed something different about him. His usual tough expression had changed into a softer and almost embarrassed look. It would almost seem as if he was flustered. I couldn’t help but smile a bit, this soft expression actually suited Draco. As soon as he got close enough for me to see his face properly my breath was taken away. His eyes glistened like stars and his lips were curved into a shy smile as he approached me. That was the first time Draco smiled at me and genuinely meant it. “So, you actually showed up? To be honest, I didn’t expect you to.” Draco said and moved closer ever so slowly. As Draco moved closer, I instinctively moved back towards the tree trunk to the point where I couldn’t move any further. My back was now pressed against the trunk. The shy smile on Draco’s lips had now changed to a more confident smirk. “What’s the matter Potter? Snake’s got your tongue?” he teased and leaned over placing one hand right next to me head on the tree trunk. I could feel my cheeks turning redder and redder as I was standing there with my back against the trunk. I opened my mouth to speak but the words just didn’t want to come out, so I quickly shut it again and just nodded awkwardly. “Ha, that’s cute. No annoying comeback? Well in that case let me do the ‘talking’ and you just listen like a good little boy, okay?” he said and leaned even closer before I could say or do anything. Once again, our faces were only inches apart. My eyes flickered slightly as I eagerly awaited what would happen next. I wasn’t fully prepared for what Draco had planned, because what happened next shocked me. He placed a knee between my legs and pressed his body against mine, pressing my body even further against the tree trunk and closed the few inches gab between our faces. He pressed his soft lips against mine and my eyes widened. Draco gently grabbed the collar of my pajamas shirt. My legs turned to jelly and at this point it was useless to fight it, Draco had me right where he wanted me. I closed my eyes and slowly brought a hand up to Draco’s hair and softly tangled my fingers in his hair. It was like nothing else in the world mattered in that moment, it was just the two of us under the moonlight. Draco’s tongue slowly brushed against my lower lip and gently parted my lips. It felt like fireworks exploded in my chest and I tried my best to muffle a small moan, but I’m not sure it was very successful at all.
the enemy Ron!” I yelled back and clenched my fists to dull the need to punch Ron in his stupid face. “Oh, so now you’re on first name terms with him? That’s just great! Brilliant! I suppose that means you expect us to fall to our knees and worship him whenever he walks by?!” Ron snarled back. Hermione stepped in between us and looked back and forth between us. “Stop it you two- This is ridiculous, you are best friends for Merlin’s sake!” She said. Ron snorted and folded his arms across his chest. “Ha, I’d rather suffer under the Cruciatus curse than be friends with this
I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t excited about getting to see Draco again. I quickly crumbled up the note before anyone else could read it. I noticed Hermione looking at me with the same suspicious look on her face as the first time I got a note. I think she was beginning to understand what was going on, but I wasn’t sure, and I didn’t want to test my luck just yet. I spend the rest of the day with Ron and Hermione in the common room talking and relaxing. It was nice to have some time off from the Triwizard Cup for a change, I knew it wouldn’t last forever though. Sooner or later I would have to prepare for the next trial. As evening slowly approached and the sun began to set it got harder and harder to contain my excitement. If I didn’t know any better, I would say that I must’ve looked like a little schoolgirl about to go on a first date with her crush, which was kind of how I felt. I could barely get anything down at dinner, but I knew I had to eat if I didn’t want Hermione to suspect more than she probably already did. I managed to finish my dinner and left the table along with Ron and Hermione before we headed back to the common room to relax for the rest of the evening. We spent hours just talking just like we usually did, but I knew I would have to tell them both what was going on eventually. The thought kind of scared me, what if they didn’t want to be my friends anymore after telling them? ‘Now you’re just being paranoid, Harry. Of course, they would still want to be your friends after you tell them everything.’ I thought to myself and pushed my worries aside for the time being. I instead focused on confronting Draco about how I felt and what this whole thing made us. But how was I supposed to do it, should I just be straight up honest, or should I try to ask Draco how he’s feeling about all of this? On second thought, Draco didn’t strike me as the type of person to openly talk about his feelings. I guess I must’ve spaced out at some point because suddenly Hermione was waving her hand in front of my face. “Uhm, hello? Earth calling Harry, is anyone home?” She asked with a small laugh looked over at Ron who was laughing as well. “Ron and I are heading to bed now and we were just wondering if you were planning on going to bed or if you’re just going to sit here spacing out by yourself?” I shrugged and looked at the time before answering, the hands showed 11:15 pm. “I think I’ll just stay up a little longer. I just need to clear my head for a while.” I replied and sent them both a soft smile. I felt bad for lying to my friends, but I wasn’t ready to tell them just yet. I said goodnight to Ron and Hermione and went back to spacing for a little while until it was time for me to head out to meet up with Draco.
you!” I watched Ron as he shrunk together. It almost seemed like Ron feared me. I could feel my blood boil as I continued to yell at him. Hermione tried to calm me down by saying that was okay since hadn’t actually hit her, but I didn’t care. Ron kept trying to apologize, but I was already too fed up with him at this point. “You tried to fucking
“Of course not! Pansy, I lo-“ I hesitated at first, which made Pansy raise her brows at me. “I love him, Pansy. I would
Thank you for reading chapter IV of The Lion and the Snake!
We arranged to meet up the day before summer break. We had managed to sneak blankets and pillows into a broom closet close the study room so that we would always have them close if we decided that we wanted to cuddle. I had managed to find some candles and some matches to try to set a cozy mood. I arrived way earlier than we had planned to meet so I could prepare everything. I collected the pillows and blankets from the broom closet and scattered the candles around the room before lightening them. I had arranged the pillows and blankets on the floor right in the middle of the room. I had to move a few tables though, but it was worth it. The candles were skillfully placed on the surrounding tables. Draco had no idea what I had planned, and I decided that I would surprise him once he got here. I waited outside the study room for him and beamed at the sight of him. I waved softly at him and sent him a quick smile. “I have a surprise for you.” I said and took off my tie to blindfold him. “Potter? What the hell is going on here?” Draco asked surprised and fumbled around, confused with this whole situation. “Just trust me.” I said and grabbed Draco’s hand before pulling him into the study room. I removed the blindfold from his eyes and walked over to the middle of the room where I had placed all the pillows and blankets. “Come sit with me?” I asked softly and sat down before patting on the pillows next to me. Draco just stood there completely dumbfounded at me for a few minutes. “Potter, what the hell is all this?” He finally asked and walked over to sit down next to me. He looked around the room and I couldn’t make out if he was impressed or annoyed. “Well, I just thought that I would make out last night before summer break special- You don’t like it? I can totally remove the candles if you don’t-” I said and started to get up, but I was stopped by Draco’s hand around my wrist. “Did I tell you to move, Potter?” He said and gently pulled me back down on the pillows. He pulled me into his arms and hugged me softly. “You truly are hopeless, aren’t you? What am I going to do with you?” Draco asked rhetorically and looked down at me. I cuddled up in his arms and took a deep breath, inhaling Draco’s scent. I nuzzled my head into his chest and softly wrapped my arms around his chest.
Those words rang in my ears as I watched Draco leave. My throat felt dry and I didn’t know what to do or say. Part of me wanted to get up and sprint after Draco to tell him that I loved him back, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. He had hurt me and treated me like I was nothing but a fuck toy he could have some fun with. It was going to take me a while to forgive what he had done to me, and I wasn’t even sure that I ever could forgive him. But even though Draco had treated me terribly, hearing him say that he loved made me feel happy. He even used my first name instead of my surname for a change.
Anyways, I hope you enjoy~

I don’t know what I was dreading the most, seeing Ron at breakfast or spending the entire day with him during classes. Both seemed unbearable right now and I considered staying in bed, pretending to have come down with something. ‘No, I won’t give Ron the satisfaction of getting me down that easily.’ I thought to myself and got out of bed. Luckily, I was the only person left in the boys’ dorm, so I didn’t have to face Ron or anyone else right now. I got dressed and went down to the Great Hall to get some breakfast even though I wasn’t hungry at all. It felt like my stomach had tied a knot on itself. I was nervous that I would bump into Ron at the table. I didn’t notice that I had been holding my breath until I exhaled in relief when I saw that Ron was nowhere to be seen at the table. I approached with caution and slowly found an empty seat. I felt a hand on my shoulder and flinched slightly. “Harry, are you okay? You look terrible-“ Hermione’s voice was soft and concerned. I shook my head and kept staring at my plate. She squeezed my shoulder gently and sat down next to me. “Talk to me Harry. I can when there’s something bothering you.” She said silently. I shook my head again and looked at her. “Not now. Not here. I don’t feel like breaking down in tears in front of literally every student and staff member attending Hogwarts.” Hermione nodded and sent me a soft smile. “Just so you know- I think Ron crossed the line last night and I think what he said was highly inappropriate.” She said and the left for class. I waited a few seconds before getting up and followed her.
I think this was the first time I realized that I was sexually attracted to Draco and I couldn’t help but wonder if he felt the same way about me.
serious-“ Draco laughed and softly patted me on the head. “I’m just worried about how your friends will react if they find out what you’ve been doing.” I said softly. “More like

After Dumbledore had left the cell, I turned to look at Harry. He was still sitting as far away from me on the bed as he possibly could. I sighed quietly and moved closer to Harry while holding up some of the cover before wrapping it around Harry’s shoulders to prevent him from getting colder than he had already gotten. Harry was shivering but I couldn’t tell if it was from being cold or if he was just either really scared of me or really angry at me. I tried reaching my hand out again and this time Harry didn’t move away from me, mostly because he couldn’t move anywhere without passing me in the process. I gently placed my hand on Harry’s shoulder and watched him as he flinched. My heart sank in my chest once again. “I know I fucked up- You have no idea how bad I feel, Harry. I wish I could take it all back, I really do. I promised myself that I would never hurt you, but that was exactly what happened- I mean, you won’t even look at me-“ I trailed off and tried to fight the tears forming in my eyes. It hurt that Harry was suddenly acting this coldly towards me. “Please say something Harry?” There was a painful long silence before Harry finally spoke. “How do you expect me to be okay with all of this? First you bite me to the point where my shoulder starts bleeding, then you tried to force yourself on me in the courtyard because your stupid Alpha brain thought thinks it’s a good idea, then you rape me continuously for five days straight. And as if all that wasn’t enough Dumbledore shows up and tells me I only have one job in this world, which is to please you whenever you ask for it. And oh yeah; I have to bear your children!” He yelled as he looked over at me, his eyes were glowing with anger. “What do you want me to say? That I’ll be you little pet, that you can play house with, for the rest of my life? Or that I’m thrilled to be your fuck toy?” Harry asked furiously. The look on his face scared me a bit. He looked like he was ready to literally murder someone. For a moment I completely forgot everything about the accusations about rape, but as I snapped out of it, I realized Harry had accused me of rape, again. “Will you stop with the rape accusations? I’m telling you; I did
“Potter,” he says. “Weasley.”
Harry didn’t exactly think that’d be his thing, but there’d be wine so he could probably tolerate it. Besides, relationships were about give and take, weren’t they? “Yeah, okay. I’m free this weekend, just let me know when.”
’s hard enough and that’s direct mind-control. Easier to use but easily tested for. A potion’s subtler, but it’s hard to get it just right, to make the victim act naturally. For it to be undetectable. If you were a Potions Master, what would you suggest?”
“Take down my wards too, please,” Draco murmured, kissing at his neck a little before he turned to retrieve his trousers from the ground.
“Sorry, Ron,” Potter says, mercifully drawing Weasley’s attention onto himself. “It’s true. It’s a wonder the rest of them even know which end of the broom to hold.”
“I said I was sorry!” Draco told him. “And anyhow, I told you—”
“Yeah, well, they haven’t taught this stuff here, either,” Harry told him. “Look, instead of going on about how this is something I should already know, why don’t you save us both a lot of bother and just tell me?”
“I know,” Harry said, grinning again. “That’s why I do it.”
But all too soon they arrived. “Well,” he said, slowing and tugging Harper to a stop outside the door that led up to his flat. “This is me.”
So Harry hadn’t done quite as good a job hiding it as he’d tried. “You,” he said honestly. “I’m just really happy right now.” That was also true.
Harry Potter just lost his to Draco.
Draco moved his foot away and uncrossed his legs, picked up his wine glass and took a sip. “Very true,” he said. “But that’s what makes us so much fun, don’t you think?”
“Okay, okay,” Potter says with a laugh, and reaches for the top gift on the stack.
That was fine, because he didn’t have an answer, either. Over the last few months, pub nights had become a regular part of Ron’s week. Hermione tagged along when she was able, but Harry never had. He didn’t like the idea of spending time around a bunch of Aurors—Harry didn’t want to be one himself, but sometimes a sense of misplaced guilt still snuck up on him—and he
The robin flies off, and Draco finishes up in the kitchen, then gathers his things and gets his shoes on, and Potter scoops his keys from the bowl by the door and they leave the house.
He must not sound convincing, because Granger gives him a stern look and says firmly, “I mean it. He will be. He survived a whole War with Voldemort trying to kill him. He’s not going to get himself bumped off by some garden variety arsehole.”
. His Auror uniform fit him a little loosely, giving the faint impression of a child playing dress-up. “You’re still.” He waved one hand vaguely in Harry’s direction.
keeps confusing Form 327-B with Form H-148C.” Potter huffs indignantly, as if confusing those two forms is akin to confusing a dragon with a cow. “It’s Pritchard. We all know it’s Pritchard because that arsehole can barely spell his own name, but because they
“And give him the satisfaction?” Harry said, looking around to make sure that Kreacher wasn’t within earshot. “Never. I’m ahead this month, anyhow, and I’d like to keep my lead. We can wait a little bit. We’ll finish up breakfast and spend the rest of the day in bed.”
“Nah,” Potter says. “I was fine, the bike was fine. But that’s part of why I’m so insistent about all the protection charms when we ride. It could have ended quite badly.” He pauses to cast an Impervius Charm over the motorcycle so that any birds who may perch in the tree above it won’t be able to shit on it, then turns to the house, stretches, and tugs the hem of his jumper straight. Draco had talked him into changing into something a bit nicer today, and Potter had come up with this, a lightweight cotton jumper in a lovely cream colour that Draco could never wear. It would make him look washed-out and sickly, but it makes Potter’s skin practically glow with health.
, and pawns are always expendable.
Draco hastily threw out and slammed into the wall, leaving scorch marks on the plaster. Draco scrambled behind the chair as Harry ducked round the bed, banging his knee painfully as he hit the ground.
“A little,” Draco admitted. “Can I kiss you again?”
Mercifully, Ron let it drop and Harry returned his attention to the bacon until a few minutes later when Hermione came down the stairs.
Draco shrugs. “I dated a man in New York who wore skirts and heels and things for no other reason than he liked wearing them, and fuck what everyone else thought about it. He was the person who taught me the most about not being an unintentional arsehole.”
“I’ve got it under control,” Harry said, finally coming up with a couple of empty vials. “Shit. Have you got any Hangover Tonic? I’m out and nothing’s open before I have to be in to work at the shop.”
Potter looks over at him. “Don’t you? You run an apothecary, yeah? Don’t you have to dissect things sometimes?”
“Oh, er, right,” Harry said as it dawned on him that Draco, despite having spent quite a lot of time in his room, had no idea how to find it in the house. He’d always Apparated straight in and out until Dean and Seamus had taken over Regulus’ old room and Seamus had an awful habit of treating the upper floor like a shared dorm room. Harry had stopped expecting to have any measure of privacy within the first week, but that was okay because he sometimes left his door cracked open to hear Seamus snoring across the hall. He slept better that way.
He’s so caught up in his own thoughts that he doesn’t realise he’s not alone until someone shouts, “
“I didn’t see anything,” Potter says quickly, and he’s blushing a little bit too. “I was mostly distracted by the wings. And the, erm. Screaming.” He pauses, chews at his lower lip. “And the blood. There was… a lot going on.”
Park shrugged again and didn’t say anything else, and Draco had to force himself to pick up the dropped thread of conversation.
Rolling his eyes, Draco sucks the smear of butter off his knuckles and does as he’s told, though he slips his wand from his sleeve and fills the kettle and puts it on while Potter’s occupied with trying to juggle a butter knife and his mobile phone at the same time.
“Mm,” Draco said, folding his hands in front of him. “Tell me, Mr Harper, why do you want to work in an antiques shop?”
That was probably true. Harry had seen Ron devour one of Molly’s Sunday dinners over at the Burrow, and then come home afterward and work his way through a whole container of Thai takeaway. Other people could always make room for ice cream and other desserts; Ron Weasley could always make room for red curry or spicy beef.
Beside him, Ron rolls his eyes and nudges Harry with an elbow. “Tell me about it,” he says. “I can’t believe we’re all so
And right now, Draco’s need has never been greater.
Draco shoves himself out of bed and presses his hands to his face. He can’t do this. It’s going to happen again, and he can’t stop it, and he doesn’t know what to do. Panic rises up inside him, pressing against his lungs and making his breath go fluttery with the inexplicable urge to laugh.
But for now, Draco plans to enjoy every moment of Potter’s submission.
“But other than tiredness after the full moon, there’s no other differences?” Draco asks with a frown. “I thought you said you could smell me.”
“What, you’d have told her you were screwing me?”
someone and—
Draco makes his ninth transformation without incident and comes home safely afterward. He’s covered in blood again this time, which means of the ten victims, there are only three left now. He submits to Potter’s care so as to save them both an argument, and because Potter’s warm, dry hands on Draco’s back do more to ground him than anything else. After his wounds are bandaged, Potter leaves and Draco gets in the shower and scrubs himself clean and dresses for work.
“What the fuck,” Draco says, momentarily forgetting he’s supposed to be nice to her. “How the fuck am I supposed to pronounce this?”
And then, his mobile goes quiet. He slips it back into his pocket and watches the Muggle healers working. In the absence of his phone making noise, his mind fills the silence. At once, he runs through seven different possibilities for the remainder of their lives. All of these possibilities run short. No matter what they do after this, there’s no escape for Malfoy. Harry doesn’t have a chance of honouring Mouse’s request; he has the sinking sensation that nothing he can do will keep Malfoy alive, not long-term, anyway. At Harry’s best estimate, they can make it another six days before they’re taken down.
“Sorry. I was just in shock that you knew the word for it.
From there, their conversation fell back into the mundane. Draco meant to make his excuses and leave, as he felt that he’d got all the useful information he was going to get this evening. But somehow he ended up agreeing when Harper offered to order cottage pie for both of them along with round three, and then Draco had to pick up rounds four and five to even things out, and by that time it was past midnight.
Then Potter waits downstairs while Draco changes into a set of his Muggle clothes: black trousers and grey shirt and a soft sage green knit sweater. He checks over his appearance in the mirror, and uses a bit of Blemish Concealer to hide the darkening circles beneath his eyes. The strange bird nightmares had come earlier this month, and Draco hasn’t slept well the past few nights. He brushes his hair back and casts a light spell over it to keep it swept neatly from his forehead, then tucks his wand up his sleeve, takes his new black peacoat, and goes downstairs.
“Hi, Pans,” Draco said, leaning in to kiss her cheek before he took his own seat.
the stupid bastard sometimes. He doesn’t think that he can respond to Potter without shouting, and if he lets the tenuous thread of his self-control snap, he’s not sure he’ll be able to regain it. He’s barely holding onto his composure as it is. He bites back his words.
There’s a long moment of numb shock, and then a wave of sheer relief hits Draco like a Bludger to the gut, elation swelling in him so fast and fierce that he feels his ribs might crack with the force of it. He’s done it, after long months and endless nights, he’s finally done it. Draco refuses to think of what will happen next, of what will come through the Cabinet and the havoc it will wreak. For now, he’s saved his parents. He’ll savour this victory because in the end, it is the only thing that matters.
“I thought about taking them down,” Draco says, moving to stand beside Potter. He lets his shoulder brush against Potter’s. He wishes Potter would put his arm around him. “But I read somewhere last night that things can help trigger memories.”
“And I hit it.” Draco leans over so his shoulder presses to Potter’s. “So we’re both sorry,” he says. “In any case. While we’re on this uncomfortable subject, what’s it like for you? I mean, if we’re…” He trails off, because he’s not entirely certain what they are. “If we’re whatever-we-are, then—”
“Malfoy,” Harry breathes between kisses. “I need you to fuck me. I need you. Please. I’m so—god, I need you.”
sprawls across the yellowed parchment in bold black ink. Even though Draco’s sure that what he needs is in this book, he still rifles through it until he finds the page detailing a potion for testing the purity of one’s blood, with a footnote on how to adjust the potion to test the purity of one’s soul.
Malfoy returned just then with three fresh pints. He kept one for himself, and passed the other two to Harry and Ron.
“Nothing,” Draco says, half-distracted by how different Potter looks without those iconic black glasses cluttering up his face. He looks more vulnerable without them, and somehow younger.
They’d lost another Enforcer. She’d got too close in the chaos, and been aged sixty years in half a second. She’d been sent off to the Polish equivalent of the Department of Mysteries where they were currently working out how to de-age her back to herself, but she wouldn’t be returning to work any time soon. It’d been a near thing for Draco himself, but he’d got the Time Magic safely contained again, and they now had two Pura operatives in custody. It’d been a success, and Draco was glad of it. But it meant that he was no longer needed here. During the debriefing of today’s events, he’d been informed that he was being sent back to London, to continue his research until they had their next lead and had need of him again.
“Harry?” Hermione asks again, and her voice is edging toward that terribly gentle tone that Harry hates. “Harry, what’s wrong?”
“Wait wait wait!” Draco gasps out, and Harry backs off immediately.
Malfoy takes one look at him and says, “How about Brighton?”
“What, is it my birthday or something?” Potter asks, pulling a falsely-astonished face, and laughs as Ginny tries to trip him, and Potter pulls her hair, and Ginny elbows him hard in the side.
“Warm. Like, like a bathtub.”
“Wait, wait,” Draco breaks in, because he feels as though he’s just lost the plot again. “Houses? Why on earth do we need to look at houses?”
Park and Granger had gone off to the toilet together, and Draco was just waiting for them to get back so he could say goodnight to them and make his escape. His pint glass was empty, his tab was settled, and he was ready to be safely inside his flat with no Harry, and none of his arsehole friends mocking him, and he could have his leftovers for a nice light supper and then go to sleep and hopefully in the morning he would feel better.
“Hello,” says Potter, lifting his beer bottle in a jaunty little salute.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry whispers.
“You just…” Potter swishes the tea towel toward the cupboards.
“Oh,” he says, standing up and offering her his hand. “Aunt Andromeda. Teddy and Potter have both told me so much about you, I’m so glad to finally meet you.”
"Still…" Harry said. "I think it's amazing."
, and they are
, right. Harry understands too. He’s the Boy Who Lived. Can’t send him packing just because his memory’s gone to shit. Oh no, they’ve got to keep him around, just give him a bit of
Harry just shrugged. He’d maintained that for about a year, but it was hard to deny that the cat was his when she had her own food and water bowls taking up valuable space on his postage stamp-sized kitchen floor, and most mornings he woke up with her on his pillow, curled comfortably round his head like a furry hat. She still came and went as she pleased, though, through the kitchen window he now left cracked open year-round. “She’s her own cat. More of a flatmate than a pet, really,” he said. He offered her his fingers, and she gave him one rub with the side of her face before looking away and staring fixedly at a blank spot on the wall.
A few more minutes wouldn’t hurt anything, Harry thought as he closed his eyes. He’d stay here for a few more minutes before he headed downstairs to start breakfast.
“I don’t understand,” Desmond said. “How did they even find her?”
It isn’t. She keeps shaking. He sighs.
yourself, which is ridiculous! You love ‘Arry and he ‘as chosen to be with you, and zat should be enough.” She shakes her head. “Zey all mean well, but it is difficult. I understand what it is like to be ze outsider.”
“Nothing,” Draco said quickly. Fuck, he’d said that
Draco looks at the sheer amount of blood on the floor and nods. There wouldn’t have been time for Potter to look up the spells he’d need.
“Is that what it’s told you?” Malfoy demands. He’s wild-eyed, and honestly a little bit terrifying. Harry’s heart beats faster. “Of course it—fuck—never mind. Harry, I need you to listen to—”
“I need a name for my department, but they’ve just rejected Magical Accessories Development and Testing,” Draco says, reaching for his pliers again.
“That’s it! Out of my kitchen or I’m putting you to work!” Molly shouts at them, and Draco gets swept up in the mad scramble for the door.
The tapping gets louder, and Draco growls to himself as he hurries across the room to let her in. He’d let her out for some exercise since he’ll likely be gone most of the evening, and of course she’d come back just as he was sitting down with a cup of tea and a toasted bagel slathered with cream cheese. He gets all the way to the window before realising both of his hands are occupied. He doesn’t have a plate for the bagel, and he’s learned the hard way that sitting a full cup anywhere in the vicinity of Lucy’s perch is just begging to have it knocked over because she’s a terror like that. He starts to turn back to the kitchen to set his things down but Lucy slams her beak against the windowpane so hard Draco’s afraid she’ll either break the glass or kill herself trying. He growls again as he turns back around. For fuck’s sake, this fucking owl.
He’d gone inside afterward and had a minor panic attack over it, then managed to talk himself down. Surely it was the drinks he’d had. It was the fact that he hadn’t been out on a date for so long, and then he’d had a somewhat inadvisable amount of alcohol, and he got mixed up. That was all. He was lonely, and mixed up, and in the bright light of morning everything would make sense again.
Draco turns the bottle over in his hand, dragging a thumb through the condensation collecting on the label. “I haven’t had Butterbeer in years,” he says, and pops the cork.
“Thanks for that,” Harry said.
as clearly as if he’d begged her aloud, so he grits his teeth and puts a little steel in it when he adds, “And if that’s the case, I’ll hex you senseless, I swear to Merlin I will. I’m not brewing this a third time.”
“And this is for you as well,” the clerk says, reaching under the desk and producing a thick yellow envelope with a folded slip of parchment taped to the front. “A lovely young woman dropped it off this morning, said to give it to you when you came by.”
But it’s Draco’s own fault she’s not here. He may not have been the one to pull the trigger, but he got her dead all the same. Set things in motion and showed her the path and gave her a nudge, and now he’s got nothing left to do but keep walking without her.
“You’ll have to invite him over for dinner,” Narcissa says decisively. “If he’s an important part of your life, then we ought to all become better acquainted.”
Draco discovers, to his dismay, that at some point his conscience has grown larger than his curiosity. Potter looks miserable, like he’d rather be anywhere but here, rather be doing anything else but trying to explain himself to Draco. But he’s determinedly going forward with it anyhow, for reasons Draco doesn’t quite understand. If it were him, he’d likely pretend it’d never happened.
Part of Draco wants to disagree with him just for the sake of it, but he can’t bring himself to defend Quodpot in any meaningful way. It really is shit.
Harry tugs back, resisting. Hermione looks back at him questioningly, and then her gaze catches on the shop to their right.
pub, they were already there and it was too late to do anything about it.
“I imagine you would have been,” Draco said. He hadn’t been privy to any of it at the time—even after they were partnered and discovered how exceptionally well they worked together, it still took a couple of years for their professional relationship to slip sideways into friendship—but Draco knew that Harry Potter’s Great Bisexual Awakening, as Weasley referred to it, hadn’t happened until he was in his early 20s.
“You know,” Potter says after a moment. “I didn’t mean anything last night. I was just…” He rubs at his shoulder, then finishes, “confused.”
.) It’d finally sunk in that you were alone. It’d occurred to you that even with you here, the Manor is vacant.
Ron and Hermione were both watching him with varying levels of amusement. Harry bit back a sigh and put his arm around Malfoy’s shoulders.
“Ron,” Harry muttered darkly, then sighed. “Well, I suppose I’ll survive without it. Malfoy, that sound all right to you?”
“That,” he says, still staring, “is creepy as shit.”
(Do not think about the gaping maw of time that stretches before you.
“Fuck,” Harry breathes as Malfoy unerringly finds his prostate and rubs at it. His cock is so hard it’s beginning to ache. “You are far too good at that.”
“Hey,” Draco says. “I wasn’t done with him.”
Harry sat up and blinked at her. “Like who?”
“Thanks,” Harry said, faintly surprised.
“—and put him in the Great Hall—”
, and both Ron and Harry agreed that he probably took his time on purpose to spend more time
It was quite a surprise to see Malfoy.
heard Malfoy sound this cheerful about anything, up to and including the time that Harry let Malfoy use his Auror-issued handcuffs on him. “And to think, I was planning to spend my day at home with my feet up and my nose buried in a book,” Malfoy goes on.
Draco glares, which she of course can’t see, and goes back out into the shop where he is immediately set upon by the woman in the feathered pink hat. She berates him for his failure to provide Felix Felicis for immediate sale, and the words
Potter blinks at him. “What? Yeah, I’m fine. Why?”
“Yes,” Draco says. He feels more vulnerable than ever before, cracked open and stripped bare and entirely on display. Draco’s magic is everything he is, and Potter looking at it feels almost unbearable in its intimacy.
“That’s not important, not right now. I know what we’re dealing with,” Malfoy says, his voice low and urgent. “No, shut up, let me finish.”
“Potter?” Malfoy asks, alarmed. He reaches for his wand.
Draco blinks at him. “How did you know?”
“Malfoy, you remember George and Angelina, yeah?” Potter says when Draco returns to the table. “Didn’t think they’d make it tonight.”
Draco smiled as his photo-self laughed, eyes squeezing shut and his face going pink, and photo-Harry grinned and flung his arm around photo-Draco’s shoulders.
Probably because to him, it is. The wave of indignation and seething jealousy that wells up in Draco is as warm and familiar as a favorite jumper, and fits him surprisingly well after all these years. He’s been so focused on trying to find Potter again that Draco’s managed to forget how much he
And, Harry realized when his eyes caught on a couple off to one side of the garden who were all wrapped up in each other, clearly snogging, it was the perfect place to escape to for, well. Exactly that sort of thing.
This is everything he never knew he wanted, and it’s exactly as he’d hoped it would be.
Every last trace of Potter’s body language is broadcasting the same message. His eyes focused relentlessly forward, the tight clench of his jaw, the tense set of his shoulders, the way his hands curl around the steering wheel, all of it says
Ron snickered into his pint glass, and Harry put his head down on the table. Hermione patted his shoulder consolingly.
Draco resists the urge to respond to Potter’s sarcasm in kind. Sniping at each other won’t make this situation any easier on either of them. But since Potter’s back is to him, Draco lets himself roll his eyes.
“Tell him I’ll be by as soon as we wrap up the interrogations,” Weasley said. “I’ll smuggle in dinner from that Thai place he likes.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Potter says. “I’m going to stay down here and get through one more.” He leans forward and snags a thin volume from the top of the stack. “This one’s short.”
“I didn’t mind—” Harry started.
But knowing all of that didn’t stop the hot swell of jealousy that ballooned through Harry until he nearly couldn't breathe.
“Draco!” Hermione says sharply. “That’s enough.”
“Hey, I offered you a clementine. It’s not my fault you turned me down.” Potter stands up, winks at Draco. “You don’t have to get up. In fact, I’ll ask that you don’t.”
- - - - -
“Untwist
“Good,” Potter says, then again, quieter, “Good.” He nudges Draco’s elbow with his own and gives him a crooked smile. “I’m glad.”
“Pansy,” Draco said. “Kindly shut your fucking mouth.”
She gives him a nod and a small smile, then heads off.
. Do you honestly believe that every single person in the Auror Department would keep this a secret? From their parents? Their spouses? Their children? You’re telling me that every single person would set aside their own personal attachments for the greater good and let their families and friends sit in harm’s way? Look, the reason they’re smuggling time magic is because they’re using it to build what are, essentially, bombs. They’re going to place them at strategic intersections of ley lines all over the world and detonate them all at once. If it goes right, it’ll set off an unstoppable chain reaction that will affect the entire world.”
Harry smiled. He was still warm and loose from his orgasm, but his eyes had begun to look a little clearer, some of the muzziness fading away. “Good,” he said.
“That’s the stuff?” Weasley asks as soon as he walks in, gesturing to the paper sack Draco’s carrying.
“Unfortunately that’s when our trail disappeared.”
“What’s this about a birthday list?” Potter asks, looking between them.
, but ends up letting it go with a mild, “Don’t be an arsehole about it.” Malfoy rolls his eyes and Harry continues, “He said it was more of a really bad feeling. He’s not usually sensitive to magic, so he was rather shaken to be sensing anything at all.”
“Oh my god
Potter blinks at him. “But your back…”
“My head hurts.” Draco feels carefully along the bandage they’ve wrapped around his head. He didn’t even notice it when he’d woken up before. “I feel like I was hit by a Bludger.”
And every inch of it was crowded with stuff. Malfoy certainly had his work cut out for him.
By the time they finally made their way up to Draco’s skull, Draco was entirely sold on this sort of studying. Harry kissed him, long and slow, then slid back down his body, nipping and kissing as he went.
Malfoy groaned and hitched his legs wider, and Harry's cock throbbed. Fuck, but he was gorgeous like this, all flushed pink with his hair mussed and his eyes gone all hazy. He was looking up at Harry like he was in love, and Harry's heart nearly burst with longing. He wanted that, he wanted that so much. It was hard enough to believe that he was here at all, in Malfoy’s flat, in Malfoy’s bed. It felt unbelievably greedy to ask for more than this, but
Draco has an easier time keeping his mind from wandering off this one than most others he’s read in the past, and wonders whether it’s because he’s not alone. Even though Potter doesn’t say anything as they work, there’s something about his presence that’s comforting in the same way that it’s a comfort to work in his lab and know that Zelda’s right in the next room. For a while there’s just the occasional rustle of pages being turned, the steady
Merlin, what if he’d
"So am I," Malfoy said. "Both because of the whole saving-us-all thing, and also because I'm now getting sex out of it."
Harry lifted his arse off the chair and yanked his trousers down past his knees, and barely had time to sit back down again before Draco was on him. He looped his arms around the back of Harry’s neck and leaned in for a kiss. He obediently opened up for him, and Draco tasted like a weird mix of the sweet custard and the garlic rolls he’d eaten with dinner. It probably should have been unappealing, but fuck Draco was good at kissing, and Harry sort of lost himself in it, the press of Draco’s tongue against his own, the warmth and softness of his lips, the slight rasp of the perpetual layer of stubble Draco seemed to have, because his blond hair was nearly invisible so he sometimes skipped shaving in the morning, while meanwhile Harry had a five o’clock shadow by lunchtime.
In one hour, he should have his results. Turning away, Draco hauls out another cauldron and sets it up on another flame, puts several chunks of beeswax into it, and begins to mince leeches while he waits for it to melt. It’s easy to distract himself from the other cauldron, the one he’s using to test the feather. Of the five Potter had removed from him, four haven’t yielded any useful results.
“We’re already here,” Draco says with a shrug. “We may as well.”
“Merlin,” Draco breathed, rolling his hips against Harry’s, and Harry groaned and tucked his face against Draco’s neck, mouthing at the curve where his neck became his shoulder. His cheek pressed against Draco’s neck and he could feel his pulse thudding hard.
He’s digging around beneath the cushions on the sofa when he hears Potter clattering down the stairs. “Found them,” he says and flashes them at Draco, keyring looped over his index finger. He snaps his hand closed around them with a muffled clink. “You ready? C’mon, we’re running late.”
“Come on,” Pansy says, taking him by the elbow. “Let’s get you sorted.”
myself. I’d hoped that Mr Malfoy might have some use for me.”
“Cold?” Potter asks, and before Draco can say otherwise, Potter adds a strong Warming Charm to the mix.
When he finishes, Draco sets the quill and ink aside, and sighs as he folds up his letter and seals it with a Sticking Charm. Merlin, this is going to be fun, trying to convince Lucy to deliver the letter. He’s got no idea which box the owl treats ended up in so he doesn’t even have the benefit of a bribe.
“Don’t bother,” Draco snaps quickly. “I need it by tonight.” Trafficking in unicorn’s blood is a more serious offence than anything Tielman’s been booked on so far, but Draco’s unwilling to have a unicorn killed just to get him on it.
- - - - -
Malfoy shifted around again, the warmth of his back against Harry’s disappearing for a moment before he settled against him again. “Are you quite all right over there?”
“Is buying books specifically for one’s coffee table a Muggle thing?”
“You love it,” Draco tells him, and Harry can tell he’s smiling.
“Oh, those two,” Zelda says. “I’ve no idea why they stay married when they clearly can’t stand each other.”
with Malfoy for a whole month?
“Yeah,” he said, setting aside the glass he held. “It did.”
Potter shakes his head. “I reckon a strong Confundus Charm would do it.” He rushes to reassure Draco, “I’ll be right here the whole time. I’ll counter the spell right away if it looks like it’s going wrong.”
He’d always hated Knockturn at night, even as a child when he’d accompany his father on some clandestine business that was best conducted beneath the cover of darkness. It should have felt like a grand adventure, but instead Draco couldn’t stop imagining eyes watching him from the shadows, or danger lurking round every corner. He’d been embarrassed by it back then and done his best to cover his nerves with bravado, even going so far as to insist on accompanying his father when he hadn’t been invited along. As an adult he didn’t need to prove anything to anyone and, in any case, he’d had no reason to visit here at all, much less at night.
“Draco,” Harry says. “Our neighbors rang the police on us. Just last week. Do you remember that? When the police showed up because they thought someone was being murdered? And then we had to redo all our wards to make the house Unplottable again?”
He grunts, tries to open his eyes, but they’re so heavy. “What’re you doing?”
The sick feel of deja vu doesn’t hit him until it’s too late. He’s already slashing his wand at Potter and shouting, “
“Anything that’s not right. Focus on inconsistencies. Do exactly what you’ve been doing. Make it keep scrambling to feed you explanations that make sense. Make it keep adjusting the world around you. You can’t let it settle us, Harry, if it settles around us, we’re through.”
Merlin. He doesn’t want to hear this, but he thinks he needs to. “Fine,” he says.
and burst in a dazzle of green and gold sparks and the faintly acrid scent of ruptured magic. Harry threw himself to the side and rolled, coming up beside the bureau just in time to counter the Ear-Shriveling Curse Draco threw his way.
“Yeah,” Draco sighs. He has the idea that he’s probably too drunk to be talking about this. “Feels nice.”
“Are you going to stay there until your Healer comes in, or shall I take further measures?” she asks tartly after he draws the blankets up over himself.
Harry looks through the window into the surgery room. Yeah, he’s still going to live. Harry doesn’t know what the fuck is wrong with him because he doesn’t know whether this is a relief or horrifying. He just knows Malfoy’s going to live.
“But…” Harry began. “No, you can’t… Draco, it’s a ridiculous idea. It just doesn’t make
“That boundless Gryffindor optimism of yours?” Draco suggests.
Zelda frowns. “Do you think someone cursed them?”
Draco squeezes his eyes shut and whimpers as Potter gets his trousers tugged down and wraps a hand around his cock. There’s the clink of a belt buckle and the rustle of fabric as Potter shifts atop him, straddling him, and then there’s a hot, hard length pressed against his own. Potter wraps his hand around both of them and strokes, and Draco arches his back against the mattress, bucking up to meet Potter’s strokes.
“Ow!” he yelps, jerking back, and the woodpecker takes off, flying up to the safety of a tree branch up above.
“Mmhm,” Malfoy said again. “But I thought it would be nice to have the option. You know, for later. If we wanted to.”
Watching Harper walk away from him, Draco was afraid that this small amount of time apart would give him time to think, to cool down and come to his senses and realise what an incredibly, ridiculously, momentously,
“Go on,” Zelda says. “Get out of here. It’s been slow today, anyhow.” She lifts the paper and gives it a flap. “This is pretty much all I’ve done since I’ve been in.”
Pansy looks far too amused. “You never had to announce it, Draco. No straight man spends as long on his hair as you do.”
Potter sighs. “Okay, look. You say that you transform and then you go flying off to god-knows-where, right? I think the first step to figuring this out is to keep you from leaving.” He scribbles something down on a corner of the parchment, tears it off and hands it to Draco. “Here. That’s me. Come over on the next full moon, when is it?”
Draco rolls his eyes. He’s given up on trying to get Potter to quit using that as code for, ‘I’d like to shag your brains out right now, please.’
—and then the feather runs into itself like melting wax and collapses into a soupy mess of—
Harry thought about denying it, but he’d already admitted that he wasn’t excited for the bond to end so he didn’t think any denial he attempted would be terribly convincing. And, in any case, he suspected he was a little too drunk to be lying to Hermione at all. He was pretty awful at it even when he was sober and had his wits fully about him.
“Because navigating Ministry politics is a bit like trying to untangle a Venomous Tentacula,” Malfoy said. “There’s a very good reason I went into Law Enforcement instead of following in my father’s footsteps and getting involved in the political side of it. You won’t get anything done without knowing whose arse to kiss and whose arse to kick, the best ways to bribe or put pressure on them, or whom to bribe or put pressure on to do it for you. Getting anywhere with Babcock will be tedious, and there will be a lot of absurd hoops to jump through, but it's doable if you know how to go about it.”
“No, those will be fine,” Draco tells her. “Enjoy your lunch.”
“What?” Draco asks, frowning a little.
Then he sighs quietly to himself as he slings his messenger bag over his shoulder and stalks from the room, up the hallway, and to the lifts. His hand doesn’t quite tremble as he jabs at the button, but he feels shaky inside. Unsteady and off-kilter. Fuck, he misses Megan, and not just because he’s about to do something extremely stupid and he’d have liked to have someone at least try to talk him out of it.
Quite keen indeed. When his other shop assistant, Elisa, had applied for a position, all she’d said was that she’d seen the notice Draco had posted in the
They linger in the stands for a while longer, waiting for the aisles and staircases to clear of spectators. Potter kicks his feet up onto the empty seat in front of him, and they talk about the game, rehashing and analysing some of the more outstanding plays. Potter talks about the possibility of trying to adapt some of them for the next Weasley Quidditch game they play, if they can manage to get themselves on the same team.
Harry sort of does, but also really doesn’t. It’s always a bit of swallowing a bitter potion, hearing anything about Malfoy’s past relations, because it always makes him think about Malfoy’s future. Harry’s fine not being Malfoy’s first; what he really cares about is being Malfoy’s last.
“Empathy was never Pansy’s strong suit,” Draco says, then shrugs. “You get used to it, to working in the field. I understand how it is. It’s hard to let go.”
That evening, Harry walked Desmond home and said good-bye, then headed to the Leaky where he took the Floo back to his flat. He killed some time filling out his reports and waiting for the Polyjuice to wear off, and when it did, he changed into a plain shirt and pair of jeans he kept stashed at the bottom of his wardrobe and took the Floo to the Ministry where Robards and Ron were waiting for him.
Draco gave him a long look that Harry couldn’t describe as anything other than a leer. “Are you saying you’re not?”
“What the hell,” Harry muttered, trying to push him off, but Draco clung to his hips and put more weight onto his knees to keep himself in place.
She smiles and waves him off. “Go on,” she says. “Some of us have got work to do this morning.” She turns away and aims a Polishing Charm at the till.
on it, pulling out the last dozen or so spells Draco had cast in a rapid stream. Mostly kitchen charms from making dinner, and then cleaning spells beyond that from closing up the shop.
Working with Celene was all right, Harry thought, even though she spent most of the time that Desmond was gone for lunch going over the same information that Desmond had already covered earlier that morning. He listened as attentively as he was able, nodded in all the right places, and let her talk. Because, according to Desmond, apparently the alternative would be cleaning things that very obviously didn’t need to be cleaned.
Harry frowns, working through that. “Wait. Like, the building becomes sentient?”
“Eh,” Potter says, wobbling his hand in a
Bloody hell, Narcissa has the worst timing. Seventeen, eighteen. “I’m not here.”
“Merlin, no,” Draco says. “Brewing is a very exact art. Everything must be done in precisely the right way. There’s no room for approximations or estimates. And I like that about it. I prefer the rigid structure of it, and the challenge of trying to problem solve within a set of rigid constraints.” He shrugs. “But sometimes it’s nice to have a break. Cooking is a nice way to unwind, sometimes. Throwing in a pinch of salt won’t make the soup pot explode. It’s relaxing, to not have to think so hard for a while.”
Draco gives him an exaggerated leer. “I’m rather counting on that, too.”
“—and the pawn stabbed him in the finger!” Pansy jumps in, and dear Merlin, they’re finishing each other’s sentences.
“Do you have anything you need to do today?” Harry asked as he took his mug over to the table. He hoped some conversation would distract him from himself, or that Malfoy would say something to remind Harry just how much he disliked Malfoy.
It’s not just Weasley and Granger who meet them for drinks. It’s a whole Gryffindor reunion. Draco’s just as surprised as Potter is when they walk into the pub and everyone shouts, “Surprise!” and Potter is beaming and laughing and hugging them, and Draco trails awkwardly after him and tries to ignore the clutch of dread in the pit of his stomach, because he was not prepared for any of this. But he holds onto his smile and he shakes hands and greets everyone as though he’s actually glad to see them, and he downs his first pint in about two minutes flat, and everything’s a little easier after that.
By Friday, Draco was nearly out of his mind.
“I dislike you,” he says, glowering at her.
. That’s a start.
“God, okay. Just give me a couple minutes,” Draco says. He lets his head fall back against the pillow.
“I’ll never find anyone,” Harry said, dragging a throw pillow over his face. “I am going to die alone.” It was now September and Harry had been going on dates for almost two months. The furthest he’d got with any of them was with Maria, who’d left him with both a goodnight kiss and a lingering sense of misplaced guilt over the current state of Wizarding politics.
“How long until dinner, Mum?” Ginny asks. “Have we got time for Quidditch first?”
“So you’re going to tell him?” Hermione asked with the sort of eagerness that people in happily-committed relationships always seemed to have about them when they saw their friends on the verge of pairing off as well.
“So,” Harry says, pulling back. His cock is beginning to make his trousers feel uncomfortably tight, and given the way Malfoy’s erection is tenting his trousers he’s very obviously in the same predicament. “Blowjobs?”
“The Fieldman case,” Potter says to Draco, and pauses to flick a defiant glance at Weasley before he continues, “is about a Mister Christopher Fieldman, who has already been arrested and is awaiting a hearing before the Wizengamot on several charges of trafficking illegal goods, particularly Goblin artefacts that have been stolen mostly from Russia, but also from Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, and imported illegally into England. He’s obviously not working alone, but he’s not speaking up about who his supplier is. So now a bunch of us are stuck doing loads of tedious paperwork, going through shipping registries and invoices, and trying to see if we can find what doesn’t add up where.”
When Harry thought of somebody caring and nurturing, Draco wasn't exactly the first—or even the thirtieth—person on the list. Draco was sharp and caustic, with a pointed, acerbic wit, and a barbed exterior that was prone to prick anybody who got too close. Harry would have thought it'd be easier to picture Draco wielding a whip rather than petting and praising, but apparently his subconscious had no issues with the latter. It was disconcerting to say the least, imagining Draco in such a role, but there was something about it that was strangely alluring. Harry had learned long ago to trust his instincts, and they told him now that Draco would be willing and able to give Harry this odd, confusing thing that he was starting to think he might want. That perhaps Draco might even want and need it too, in his own way.
"You want me to take charge?" Draco asked, his voice smooth velvet. "I can definitely do that."
"So," Draco began after a tense moment of silence. "Friday night. How are you feeling about it now that you've had a few days to process everything?"
!" Harry blurted out, unable to keep quiet. "It's not like I was by myself, Draco. You were there, too."
button he'd like Draco to hit with due haste, so he pulled back from the kiss, dumped entirely too much lube on his fingers, and reached back to slick himself up.
"Good," he said, feeling at peace for the first time since he left Britain. He knew the doubts would likely creep back in at some point, but he finally felt like he and Draco were grounded enough for him to face those fears head on. He smiled and burrowed more firmly against Draco's chest.
Naked.
Well, it was out of his hands now, too late to turn back. He busied himself with cleaning the kitchen, and then with eating the last half a pint of chocolate ice cream straight out of the carton, pacing the lower floor of Grimmauld Place all the while. Draco had always had a way of making Harry feel off-kilter, but this was a whole other level, one Harry was entirely unprepared for. The constant roller-coaster of emotion was beginning to wear, and Harry didn't know how much more he could take before he went mad.
Godric, Harry hated losing. In particular, Harry hated losing to Draco. Suffering a Quidditch defeat after all Malfoy's snide taunting in the run-up to the charity match was an indignity Harry would have nearly splinched himself trying to avoid.
have control of, but he hadn't expected it work quite so well, or for it be so hot when he felt Draco's cock begin to respond. For all that Harry had come a long way in accepting his desires, there was still a bit of a block in his mind when it came to using
Harry had already been aware of the existence of kink and BDSM, of course—he wasn't a prude by any means—but he'd never felt the need to learn any more about it, quickly dismissing the practice as not really for him. Giving or receiving pain had never particularly appealed, nor had the idea of heavy bondage or crawling around on his knees while calling somebody
"We can do that. We can
, before making their excuses.
"Oh," Harry said dumbly, not sure how to process the fact that the bloke he fancied had an entirely different sort of experience than Harry had even known to wonder about. He cleared his throat. "So are you like Graham or Emily then?" he asked, attempting to sound casual and no doubt failing utterly.
"What are they?"
"Okay," Malfoy said, placing a warm, wand-callused hand against Harry's shoulder and sending tingles down Harry's arm. "I'm going to cast in three, two, one."
"I'm ashamed to say it did," Draco said with a sigh as he stripped off his shirt. Harry took a moment to ogle his pale chest, dusted with a smattering of fair hair and bisected with familiar scars. He didn't have long to linger, though, because next Draco was batting away Harry's fingers, which had gone still on Draco's waistband, and undoing his trousers, sliding them off along with his pants and leaving him entirely, gloriously naked.
Harry's face burned just thinking of what might be on those lists, and the thought of reading them with Draco right there
"Yours?"
Harry blinked and panted, still in shock. That word had taken Harry completely off guard and there was no disguising his immediate and visceral reaction to it. Humiliation washed away the usual post-orgasm endorphins, leaving Harry off-kilter and mortified. It wasn't as if Draco hadn't clearly been into it as well; he'd been the one to start it, after all. But with Harry still kneeling there in his bright train-covered shirt, the word
, as she's the only person we can count on to have a full knowledge of her plans and offshoots."
Draco's gaze softened. "Not for me." They had a gooey
"No touching. Keep your hands on your knees or I'll stop." Something hot slithered through Harry's body at Draco's command, at how clearly Draco managed to control the situation even though he was the one on his knees. He wanted to obey Draco, wanted to make him happy, so he slid his hands to his kneecaps, holding on for dear life as Draco swallowed him down.
Harry nodded, giving her a genuine smile in return. She was clearly remembering Draco wasn't the same boy he'd been when he'd made all the wrong choices. He appreciated her trying.
"Hello, Harry. Apologies for the intrusion, but I'm afraid you left me no choice. May I come in?"
Harry's breath caught as he turned to give Draco a half-hearted glare. "You're going to wish you'd done more than apologise when you get us splinched because I can't concentrate properly."
He didn't bother waiting for Parvati to answer, just flashed her a tired smile and turned to head up the stairs, ignoring her crestfallen expression. Harry would apologise for his rudeness tomorrow.
"Really?" Draco can't help the giddy rush of pleasure that warms his body. Potter's even more handsome when he's the bearer of good news. "I thought the Ministry would laugh me out of London."
"Steady on, Malfoy, it's just a scratch," Harry replied, suppressing a wince as said scratch throbbed with a burning pain all down his side. It wasn't anything particularly nasty, just a Severing Charm he'd not managed to fully dodge before it sliced open his torso. He'd mostly staunched the blood flow with a hasty Healing spell, but he
Draco wouldn't have included anything on the list that was illegal or immoral, and Harry wasn't stupid; he knew that there wasn't anything wrong with roleplay between consenting adults. But the taboo against incest ran so deep that Harry's mind shied away from the possibility, resolutely ignoring the tiny flicker of curiosity, the spark of interest inside of him that had a perverse kind of attraction to the wicked and forbidden. Draco wasn't
Emily frowned, looking over at Harry and Draco before focusing on the doll in her hands. "Can Sophie come?"
"That's all right, it's okay. I'm going to get you both out, okay? One of us is going to need to carry Sean, though."
Harry cleared his throat and looked up at the swanky set of flats in front of them, pretending that he hadn't just been caught fondling Draco in the middle of the workday.
and provide a different kind of stress relief."
He'd wake up any minute.
"Merlin, I needed that," Draco said several moments later as he slid off Harry's dick with a wince and reached for his wand.
She nodded, looking terrified but resolute. He wondered if she'd gone to Hogwarts, if she'd been sorted into Gryffindor.
information, and it had quickly become clear that the world of BDSM and kink was even more nuanced and vast than Harry had anticipated. The deluge of possibilities had been a lot to take in, and in some ways he felt even more lost than before. It seemed so messy and complicated and confusing, and a part of him wanted to throw in the towel right then and there. But there was another part, one that had perked up with interest and timid desire as he read through the online diary from the perspective of a "little".
"Piss off." Despite the comment, Draco smiles. "This is my fifth attempt."
rushed out of Harry. All feeling, all sensation, even the ability to stand left him and he crumpled to the ground. He was vaguely aware that Ron had followed him down, was still holding him close, but he couldn't feel him. Harry couldn't feel anything at all save the corner of the ring box in his pocket, digging into his side, the weight no longer as comforting as it had been less than an hour earlier.
"So," Draco said after a significant pause. "Are you ready to start?"
Harry's cheeks grew warm, and it was a little ridiculous that he had Draco's dick in hand and was currently teasing his rim with the hot, rounded head, but it was Draco calling him out on Harry not wanting this to be a one-time deal that had him blushing.
Which left one option: the internet.
They didn't have to wait long.
promise that you'll always come first for me, Draco. I wouldn't ever do something like go off to war without talking things through with you and coming to some kind of agreement beforehand."
Harry sat there for a long moment after he finished with the lists, his half-eaten plate of spaghetti carbonara cold and congealing next to him. He stared at the parchments, which appeared so harmless and innocent lying there on the table; one would never even know the filthy depravity they contained within. He felt the sudden, blinding urge to set them alight with a swift
Harry lost track of how long he played with the action figures. Each of them had been enchanted to perform a variety of tasks on command, and Harry became absorbed in directing their interactions, laughing with delight each time he discovered something new. It was just like the expansive Action Man sets that Dudley had loved and Harry had envied, but even better because
Harry waited until he and Draco were safely ensconced in their corner table at the chippy, steaming baskets of fish and chips in hand, before throwing up a discreet

home that was being destroyed. She wanted this war over with even more than Harry did.
Oh, was that all? Harry scoffed. "What, doubting your healing ability?"
Before today, Harry would have thought the answer to that last question would be an emphatic

"Thank you for the meal, Harry, it was wonderful," Draco said after finishing his last bite of risotto. He leaned back in his chair, a half-full glass of white wine dangling from his fingertips. It was clear the compliment was sincerely meant. Harry couldn't help but perk up with pleasure knowing that Draco had enjoyed the food Harry had made. The risotto
He murmured a Healing spell Harry wasn't familiar with—which wasn't saying much, Harry barely knew the basic spells—and Harry braced himself for the usual discomfort that accompanied his own shoddy Healing spells. Instead, he was hit with a wave of warmth and a not-unpleasant tingling as Malfoy's magic slid across his skin, knitting it back together. It was quite nice, actually, that strong, building heat radiating from his side. The sudden absence of pain—which he hadn't even realised he'd been experiencing to such an intense degree—combined with the caress of Malfoy's magic, the feel of his hand on Harry's bare shoulder, and his general proximity to Harry's half-naked person, turned the arousal which had been simmering in his gut into a full-fledged boil.
"You did." Harry yawned. "Remember? You caught the Snitch, Parkinson spilled her Pimms in the excitement, you told me I was the biggest loser you'd ever met, then I sucked you off and we came back here."
With what was almost certainly less grace than Draco had displayed when getting on the bed, Harry crawled over to Draco and straddled him, unable to resist leaning down for a leisurely snog that quickly turned filthy as he groped inside his bedside table for his bottle of lube. Thankfully he didn't have to grope long. The nearly empty bottle was right near the front of the drawer, a result of the drastic increase in wanking he'd been experiencing due to working in such close proximity with Draco's smirky, sarcastic face. Smirky, sarcastic faces really did it for Harry, as did Draco bringing him cups of tea when they all worked late, and them sharing amused smiles when Ron went off on a tangent about the Cannons. Draco's…
"Are you planning to let go of me anytime soon?" Draco's tone was more playful than accusatory, but Harry quickly released him, the red of the Auror's robes beneath his fingertips reminding him that they were on duty.
his job, and it wasn't as if he was feeling particularly overworked. Besides,
"Yeah, I guess." Harry actually wouldn't mind seeing a bit more of the world; he'd never so much as left Great Britain. But going on holiday alone didn't really strike his fancy, and though the idea of going somewhere with Draco sounded quite nice, he wasn't sure they were ready for a weekend away together. Maybe soon.
"I like waking up with you in my arms," Draco whispered into Harry's hair. "I want to have that for a very long time."
and had cast several grooming charms until Harry was deemed
"Fuck, you feel so good," Harry groaned as he urged Draco back towards their bed, tearing off the rest of his clothes while Draco did the same.
"I don't want to hold you back," Draco said quietly, setting his mug down on the side table and twisting to face Harry fully. "But we're together now. We've got a flat and a life and that Dittany plant Longbottom gave us as a housewarming gift. We have to make these kinds of decisions together now." He cracked a somewhat teasing smile. "You can't expect me to remember to water the Dittany all by myself, can you?"
"Yes," Harry said, too turned on to be embarrassed by his eagerness. "
Draco seemed relieved. "I thought it might be nice to have something to help get you in the right frame of mind. I'm not all that familiar with children, to be honest, but the Muggle girl at the shop said this would be perfect for a little boy, so I bought it and used magic to make the clothes a bit bigger."
He'd been mostly silent during their walk home from the pub, and it was obvious something was weighing heavily on his mind. He'd seemed fine at the beginning of the night, and
Potter had gone quiet on the walk back to the house, and has remained so as he is takes things out of the bags and stacks them on the kitchen counter for Draco to put away. Whatever he’s mulling over, Draco leaves him to it.
“It’s okay,” Potter says. The soft way he says it tells Draco that it’s really not, but the tentative way he peeks up at Draco says that it will be. “Really, Malfoy. It’s fine. Greyback was—Yeah. He was. I understand. It’s just… I don’t like what I am. And when you reacted poorly to me, I reacted poorly to that.” He gives Draco a wry smile. “You may have worked out it’s a bit of a sore spot.”
There’s no way they’re going to be able to take the sharp curve of it at speed. Draco grabs for the assist handle over his door, holding on tight and bracing himself as best he can. Potter deftly dodges a motorbike and then there’s a great jolt as they bounce up and over the kerb, the engine revving as the tyres dig into dirt and grass. There’s a sharp
And Draco is tired. He’s so tired, and his head hurts, and his back has already begun aching faintly, and he’s probably going to die tomorrow night. All he wanted was one last quiet evening at home. He wanted to have dinner with Potter, and he wanted to touch Potter one last time as they moved around the kitchen together, and he wanted to spend a few hours afterward in companionable silence on the sofa in the living room. He wanted to hear the words, “Goodnight, Draco,” before he went up to bed. He
Weasley shrugged. “I said I wouldn’t tell him while he was in St Mungo’s. Regrowing bones is painful enough, Ron, he doesn’t need to be worrying about me while he does it. Well, his bones are all regrown now. I kept up my end of the deal.”
“Mine did.”
“Like me,” Ginny said, grinning. “I’m a professional Quidditch player, you know. And that means I know lots of other Quidditch players. In fact, our Assistant Coach is single. She’s a few years older than you and quite pretty. Fantastic thighs. Lots of time spent on a broomstick, you know.” She winked at him.
“You’ll be unsurprised to learn that what got me started on this, ah, quest, was being pissed off.”
“Although I can’t help but wonder why you’ve decided to tell us now,” Narcissa says. “Have you met someone, Draco? Has a—” She hesitates, barely a fraction of a second but Draco can hear the pause as she checks her words before continuing, “—boy caught your fancy?”
And it didn’t add up for Megan when he’d finally shared his findings with her.
“Should Ron and I head off early?” Hermione asked. “I could make something up…”
Even though he’d expected this and had done his best to prepare for it to happen again, it’s still a shock to find himself naked in the middle of nowhere with no memory of what’s happened. He groans and forces himself to sit up, and swallows against the sudden wave of nausea. His head is swimming, vision blurry, and every inch of him aches like he’s been slammed by a dozen Bludgers. His skull pounds, throbbing in time with his heartbeat.
“Yeah. After this,” Harry told him. Draco’s hand slipped on the edge and he nearly pitched all the way into the bathtub. Harry curled his fingers tightly around Draco’s hips, helping to hold him steady. “After. You feel good like this too.”
“Here, take Victoire.” Bill pushes her into Weasley’s hands before he goes into the kitchen, and Weasley passes her to Ginny, who passes her to Potter, who breaks into an exaggeratedly-happy grin, and laughs delightedly when the baby copies his expression.
“Not what you expected?” Harry asked. He still had his arm over Draco’s shoulder and Draco’s hand had returned to his knee.
“Right,” Potter says, sitting up.
Draco can feel his cheeks growing warm again. Merlin, what’s taking the bartender so fucking long? “I don’t want to talk to you about this.”
“Onward, then?” Draco suggested. Because he could sure as fuck use a drink right about now. He gave Weasley a glare, then turned it on Park for good measure. Neither of them looked like they particularly cared.
“What the fuck,” he says out loud.
A Stunner comes lancing out of the darkness, and Draco barely gets up a Shield Charm in time. The Stunner deflects with a
. Not very accurate, if you ask me, but it sounds nice.”
“Fuck off,” Draco grumbled.
“She’s got flower samples,” Hermione said darkly, and Harry didn’t think it was his just imagination that the coals began to smoulder hotter, crackling and popping furiously in the hearth. “About a thousand of them, and they’re all pink.”
"And it hasn't failed me yet," Malfoy told him, and then kissed him hard.
Lucius still hasn’t spoken, and when Narcissa releases Draco a few moments later and he sits back, he can’t bring himself to look up right away. It takes two deep breaths and a handful of heartbeats before he can make himself raise his chin and meet his father’s eyes.
It’s every bit as painful as he anticipated it would be. He ends up sitting with his parents at the table and having tea, reassuring them over and over that yes, he’s fine, and no, it won’t happen again, and yes, he’s going to see a Healer for his exhaustion, and no, there’s truly no reason to worry. He’s afraid they can see the truth, that he’s scared, that he has no idea what’s happened or whether it might happen again. He’s afraid they can look at him and somehow know he’s killed someone.
“Don’t tease me,” Potter says. It’s not anywhere near begging, but it leans enough in that direction that Draco’s deliciously tempted to see whether he can push him to it.
“I’ll owl you,” he promises. He’s missed her, and of course it’s never a bad idea to know a skilled Alchemist. “We’ll have dinner one night. It’ll be nice to catch up properly.”
“I’ll get you back for that later, you know,” Harry warns, standing up. He mentally adjusts his plans for tomorrow.
“Everything’s perfect,” Harry says, urgently this time. “This is… I wouldn’t change a thing about this. It’s perfect. It’s everything I’ve dreamed about. Malfoy”—he grips Malfoy’s hands in his, holds on tight—“what if I’m still dreaming? What if I never woke up,
“I…” Harry begins, trying to work out what the fuck is going on.
“Don’t even,” she says in that tone of hers that’s half-playful and half-menacing. “You
"Well then," Malfoy said, picking up his case and offering his elbow, "Shall we?"
“It was nothing,” Draco says quickly, taking a sip of his whisky. He ordered the best one they had, and it’s not terrible, though that’s really the nicest thing he can say about it.
He says it so fondly that Harry’s heart practically melts and he very nearly kisses him, rules be damned. Harry recovers at the last moment, redirects and bites at Malfoy’s jaw, then sucks a line of bruising kisses down his neck, ones that come
“Right,” Harry said. He put Draco’s mug back down onto the table rather more forcefully than necessary. A little of the tea sloshed over the rim, but before Draco could say anything about that, Harry walked out of the room.
Preoccupied with what he’d just been told, the smell of fresh coffee didn’t register until he rounded the end of the shelves and saw Harper slouching against the counter, two steaming paper cups sitting beside him.
“I’m sorry if I’m disappointing you by not cursing Muggles left and right,” Draco cuts him off, the threads of his temper fraying. “I’m sorry if that’s confusing for you. Shall I go out and bring you the head of one of your neighbours? Would that make it all right?” He’s angry but not angry enough to verbalise the rest of his thoughts.
Draco threw the book at him again.
. The ropes of the Incarcerous Spell went slack and fell away from Harper, setting him free.
“That’s okay,” Potter says and keeps kissing. “You’re fine right where you are.”
“Potter,” Draco says to get his attention, and shoves an armload of jumpers at him. “Take those upstairs for me?”
“Your usual?” she asked Harry, who’d reached her first.
Draco frowned at him. “Why wouldn’t we be?”
He doesn’t realise he’s spoken aloud until Potter snaps at him, “I’m not.”
Then they’re in Grimmauld Place, surrounded by boxes. He looks down into the nearest one and sees a stack of musty old books.
“Well, this will make the night more comfortable, at least,” Malfoy says. “Have you got anything in that jacket of yours to help us pass the time? Gobstones? Exploding Snap?”
"Sorry, Harry. I know you keep saying this is just dinner with your mates, but we don't have the best history, do we? And there will be… children present. You know how I feel about babies."
Harry had dismissed the offer at the time, but maybe it was exactly what he needed. He had more than enough time off saved up at work, and he and Sue Li had just wrapped up their latest case, so there wasn't anything pressing he was needed for. It was a crazy idea, impulsive and completely unlike him, but Harry had already fixated on the idea, certain it was the perfect solution. He couldn't escape his problems, but maybe they wouldn't be able to find him right away in Italy. He wasn't running, he just needed to hit pause, to take some time for himself. Harry knew he and Draco needed to have a good, long conversation about the kink and the future of their relationship, but before that could happen Harry needed to figure out what he wanted. It wasn't fair to Draco to keep stringing him along, not when Harry wasn't sure he could keep going down the path they'd been travelling on together.
It was ridiculous how much every single thing seemed to remind Harry of him, as if to constantly reinforce how much more fun this trip would be with Draco by his side. Certainly it highlighted what Harry had long been suspecting: he'd already fallen for Draco, hard enough that the thought of not being with him, of calling things off, had Harry's heart screaming out in protest. Harry was mad about him, but was that enough?
Draco was panting heavily against my neck as he gently laid down on top of me on the bed. I let go of Draco’s hips with my legs and let them fall onto the bed on each side of Draco. He still had his teeth sunk into my neck, but I didn’t mind. Even though I wasn’t in heat, the feeling of Draco’s teeth in my neck felt nice somehow. I found myself wondering if it was just the Omega inside of me talking or if I actually liked it. After a few minutes of just laying on the bed, catching our breaths again, Draco let go of my neck. I winced slightly when Draco pulled his teeth out of my neck, but the pain quickly went away. Draco used a healing spell on my neck to help ease the slight pain.
“Are you done?” I asked rhetorically and looked over at Harry who had been yelling at me for the past thirty minutes. Harry opened his mouth to say something but shut it again and just nodded his head when he couldn’t come up with anything else to say. I smirked and slowly moved closer to him. “Good. Because I do not appreciate that attitude of yours. I think I’ll have to punish you again.” I watched Harry’s facial expression change from angry to intrigued in a split second. I raised an eyebrow at him. “Not so fast Potter. I never said how I would punish you, did I?” I pinned him against the door frame and leaned in to whisper into his ear. “I’m going to make you work for it this time.” I could feel Harry shutter at my breath against his ear and I smirked. “No matter how many times you beg for me to touch you, kiss you, even fuck you I won’t give it to you.” I added and gently pulled away again. I met Harry’s eyes and he seemed distraught. “What does that even mean?” He whimpered and looked at me in confusion. “You’ll see soon enough. Have some patience Potter.” I said with a smirk and turned around before leaving. It wasn’t easy to ignore Harry’s desperate calls for me to come back, but I managed to compose myself long enough to get down to the dungeons and away from Harry when all I wanted to do was go back and fuck him against the door frame.
Once I reached the common room I went straight to the dormitory. I quickly changed into my pajamas and crawled into my bed. The sheets still smelled like Draco from earlier. I hugged my cover tightly and inhaled the smell. It smelt like my Draco, but also not like my Draco. There was something else, a smell I didn’t recognize. It was strong and musky. A wave of heat shot through my body, which made me yelp and let go of the cover. I groaned in frustration and tossed the cover onto the floor. “Fine. I’ll just sleep without it then.” I sighed and rolled onto my side before closing my eyes to get some sleep. That turned out to be way harder than it should be. I tossed and turned for an awfully long time, my mind was racing. A lot of questions floated around inside of my head, which made it impossible to fall asleep. And the fact that my cover smelled like Draco, the last person I wanted to be thinking about right now, didn’t help either.
My cheeks turned hot and red and a smile spread across my face. I walked over to the Gryffindor table with my head held high, ignoring all the confused looks I was getting from my fellow Gryffindors. As I sat down at the table Hermione smiled and waved at me. “Well, you’re looking a lot better today.” She said and I just shrugged. “Guess I just slept better?” I heard Ron snort and noticed that he left the table without finishing his plate. “Where are you going Ron? You haven’t finished your breakfast.” Hermione said but Ron just mumbled back. “I’m not hungry anymore. I’m going to class.” Hermione and I both stared after him as he rushed out of the Great Hall. “Is he
When I got back to the common room later that evening everyone was waiting for me to celebrate that I had completed the first trial without too many bruises and scratches. I couldn’t help but laugh when Fred and George picked me up and jumped up and down with me in their arms. We laughed and chatted for a few hours before people slowly started to retreat and go to bed. I stayed up after everybody else had gone to bed, trying to work out what to write in my note for Draco. I had to start over so many times that I started to question if I would ever get it right. I let out a deep and frustrated sigh, crumbled the last piece of paper up and threw them all into the fireplace to cover my tracks. I muffled a yawn and looked at the clock. “Guess I better go to bed.” I mumbled silently to myself and headed upstairs to the dorm. I quickly changed into my pajamas and crawled into my bed before pulling the covers over me. The moment I closed me eyes everything between Draco and I came back, but this time it hit differently. My body got all tingly and hot and all I could think about was how I wanted to feel Draco’s body pressed against mine again. I wanted to feel his hands gently caressing my body, I wanted to smell his cologne, I wanted to feel his lips pressing against mine. My mind wandered and soon I found myself thinking about what else could have happened between us. At some point I ended up imagining Draco pushing me onto a bed before he crawled on top of me. I quickly pushed those images out of my head and opened my eyes again. What the hell was wrong with me?
I hope you enjoy the story so far~

I was starting to regret ever thinking that all I would ever need Draco for again was meaningless sex. As I was laying there in Draco’s arms, I began to realize that I really did love him, and I was now ready to admit it, not only to myself but also to Draco.
Harry had asked me to meet him after he and Hermione had taken Ron to the hospital wing to get his nose fixed up. Harry had briefly explained what had happened and why Ron’s nose had been broken. And to be honest I couldn’t help but laugh silently to myself when I read the note. I would have liked to see the punch Ron had taken to his face. Harry was not the type of person to act out of anger and he rarely ever did so, but when he did, oh boy. I had seen it once before when I taunted him about the Triwizard Cup. He raised his voice and his eyes had flashed with anger. It was kind of scary to be honest.
I let out a deep breath in relief when the clock stroke 6 pm and hereby meant that was the end of today’s schedule. I quickly gathered all my belongings as hurried out of the classroom before everyone else. I considered skipping dinner, but my stomach made a very persistent growl and I sighed before heading to the Great Hall to get something to eat. I finished eating just as Ron entered the Great hall followed by Hermione and the rest of our friends. ‘Crap. How do I get out of here without bumping into him?’ I thought and kept my head down, hoping Ron wouldn’t notice me. Fortunately for me he didn’t, and I saw an opportunity to get out of there.
I knew everyone would be busy either eating in the Great Hall or unpacking back in their dorms, so I figured that now was my chance to show Harry how I really felt. I asked him to quickly go and unpack his things and then meet me in the study room. At first he looked confused but agreed and went on his way to unpack. I quickly ran down to the Slytherin dorms and unpacked my things before heading back to the study room to make everything ready. I arranged the pillows and blankets to look somewhat like a bed and scattered the candles across the room before lightninging them. As the finishing touch I conjured some rose petals and scattered them across the room as well. Once I was done, I took a few seconds to admire my work before I heard footsteps closing in from the hallway.
It felt good to finally tell someone about Harry and I knew I could trust my mother not to tell anyone before I was ready. My mother and I talked for a very long time before one of the house elves came knocking on the door, announcing that dinner was ready. We went down to eat together, and I silently thanked my mother for listening and comforting me. I even told her that I love her, which made her light up in the brightest smile. She had always been kind to me and had always tried to understand me instead of just scolding me whenever I did something wrong, or wrong according to my father who was a lot less understanding. We ate in silence, but we always did, so it didn’t really bother me. I was just glad that it had been my mother who came to check on me and not my father.
intervene. He has already apologized a hundred times. And besides, Ron wouldn’t have hit me in the first place if I hadn’t stepped in between him and Hermione when he tried to slap her.” I turned back around to face Harry and he looked furious. I blinked a couple of times to make sure I was seeing this right. Harry’s eyes were darkening, and the air was thickening. “I won’t let you hurt him Draco. Do you hear me?” ‘So, this what Harry looks like when he is angry?’ I thought to myself and watched Harry carefully from where I had stopped in my tracks when he raised his voice. I passively crossed my arms over my chest and looked back at Harry while he was giving me a piece of his mind. I was impressed with Harry for crossing me like that and I couldn’t help but smile. “What the hell are you smiling at?!” Harry yelled and looked confused at me. “Oh nothing. You just look hot when you’re angry, that’s all.” I said and shrugged. I watched as Harry’s cheeks turned redder and redder, but that didn’t stop him from continuing to yell at me, but now he was yelling at me for not taking this seriously.
As I entered the courtyard, I saw Draco leaning against the tree waiting for me to approach him. ‘How did he know I would come here? Has he just been standing there this whole time waiting for me?’ I thought to myself and prayed that Draco wouldn’t notice me if I just turned around and walked away. I turned on my heels and walked away as fast as I possibly could, but Draco had spotted me. “Harry Please! I need to talk to you!” He called after me and I could hear footsteps following me. I started running to get away from him as fast as I could. Tears were forming in my eyes and I just wanted to be left alone, but Draco was persistent. He was taller and faster than me, so he quickly caught up with me. “Would you please stop running and just listen to me?” He asked in between small pants. I knew I would have to at least give him a chance to explain and stopped running, I tried to stop the tears, but I couldn’t. At this point I think there were tears of confusion more than anything else. I folded my arms across my chest and looked coldly at Draco. “Alright, if you want to talk, then talk. And you better have a good apology planned if you want to keep me as whatever we were-“ I continued to look at Draco and watched as his expression turned even sadder. “Harry I really am sorry- I don’t know what came over me, I’ve never experienced anything like that before-“ Draco hesitated before continuing. “I can’t hide this from you anymore- I’m an Alpha Harry. I think the reason I reacted the way I did is because I’m about to go into Rut for the first time- Which means there is an Omega nearby who’s about to go into heat- Crap, this is bad-“ Draco trailed off when he noticed that I stared at him in a combination of disbelief and confusion. I had never in my life heard of this before now, I suppose it made sense considering that I was raised in the Muggle world. I rubbed my forehead and tried to comprehend what Draco had just told me. Draco opened his mouth to say something but quickly shut it again. He was interrupted by a soft breeze coming from behind me. I could see him inhaling and saw his eyes flash like they had done earlier. I instinctively took a step back to create a bit more space between us, just in case he got any ideas. “It’s you. You’re the Omega about to go into heat, that’s why I’ve been unable to think straight around you lately.” Draco stepped closer, completely ignoring the safe distance I had tried to create between us. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me closer to him, despite my countless attempts at fighting it. “Let go of me! Don’t touch me!” I yelled but Draco didn’t care. Instead of letting go of me, he bent down and buried his face in my neck. I froze and started to panic, I was trapped inside Draco’s arms and there was nothing I could do that would make him let go, I just wasn’t strong enough to break free. I tried to pull my wrist out of Draco’s grip, but that just made him hold on even tighter. “I said let go of me! Don’t touch- Ah-“ I was interrupted by the feeling of Draco’s tongue slowly running from the end of my collarbone and all the way up to my earlobe. My face turned red and my body shivered slightly. It had felt good. ‘No, what am I thinking?! Snap out of Harry!’ I gathered all my strength and pushed myself out of Draco’s arms and made a run for it. My body was shaking, and my mind was racing. I didn’t know where I was going, I just had to get away from Draco before he could force himself on me. My first thought was to run back to the common room, but Draco knew the password and that would probably be the first place he would look for me.
I stayed in the bathroom for a while to clear my thoughts, even though it wasn’t easy. My feelings and my thoughts were a fucking mess. After around an hour or so I finally got myself together and got up from the floor. Myrtle was right. I would find a way to make this right again. I refused to give up without a fight. I took a deep breath, washed my face and dried my eyes before leaving the bathroom. The hallways were empty to my luck and I decided to go straight to my common room.
After wandering for some time, I found myself in the boys’ bathroom on the sixth floor. I closed the door behind me and let myself sink to the floor while leaning against the door. Now that I was sure I was alone I finally let myself feel everything. My shoulders were bouncing up and down as I sobbed. The guilt washed over like a tide wave, weighing me down like a ton of bricks. I pulled my knees up under my chin and wrapped my arms tightly around them before hiding my face in my knees. I could hear chatter and laughter from the hallways, meaning classes must have ended. I prayed that no one would try to enter the bathroom and waited anxiously for people to pass by. In the middle of all this I heard a sound next to me and quickly turned my head, only to find myself staring directly at Moaning Myrtle. “I’ve never seen you cry before. What’s the matter?” She asked as she looked at me. She was studying my face as if she had never seen tears before. “Why does it matter to you?” I asked and turned my head away from her, staring blankly into nothing. “It matters to me because I know the look on your face. You’re not the first heartbroken student I have seen in my time here as a ghost.” She simply replied and let herself float down next to me, copying the way I was sitting. “So, tell me, what’s the matter. Who do I need to haunt to cheer you up?” Myrtle asked, trying her best to lift the mood. “No one. This is my own fault. I fucked up, Myrtle. I hurt the person that means the world to me, and now-“ I could barely even get myself to say it out of fear of it being true. “Now they hate me- How Am I supposed to make this right again?” I mumbled as a wave of hopelessness washed over me.  My chest was aching, but at the same time it felt terribly empty. I felt something cold on my shoulder and turned my head slightly. Myrtle had placed her hand on my shoulder, and she was smiling softly at me. “You will find a way to make it right. I know you will. You’re Draco Malfoy, and there is one thing I know for certain about you; you don’t give up without a fight.” She said and sent me an encouraging smile before floating away.
I am terribly sorry for the huge delay on chapter five. Work has been crazy these past couple of months because of Covid-19.
Our conversation was brutally interrupted by the doors to the dorm swinging up and hitting the walls with a loud bang. Crabbe and Goyle came strutting through the doors and I quickly pulled the cover over me, trying to shrink into the mattress in hopes that they wouldn’t see me. But I wasn’t that lucky. At least Draco and I had both remembered to put our boxers back on, so we weren’t completely naked when they barged in.
shush me! I will not keep my voice down just because it makes you uncomfortable-” I trailed off as I noticed that Draco’s face had changed from confused and surprised to sad and hurt. I couldn’t look at him anymore, I needed to get out of there. I turned away and went straight for the door. “I can’t do this anymore Draco- I’m done.” And with those words I left the room with Draco standing there just staring after me. As soon as I was out of there, I started running back towards the Gryffindor common room. “Harry! Wait!” I heard Draco shouting after me as I ran down the hallways, but I didn’t care, and I didn’t stop to let him explain.
We stayed like this for a while until I gently pulled away and sat up straight. “Draco- I know you’re not ready to make us an official thing yet, but I need to know what we are-” I started off and carefully watched Draco’s reaction. “I mean, we’ve been messing around for an entire school year by now, don’t you think it’s time to at least admit to ourselves what we have become?” I could see Draco’s jaw tense up and he was really considering his answer. There was an awkward silence for a few minutes. “Please say something Draco?” I carefully watched Draco and part of me already knew the answer coming from Draco. “Why is it so important to you? Why can’t we just be the two of us until I feel comfortable enough to tell people about us?” he asked and looked at me. His eyes looked sad and I couldn’t help but think that I was at fault. The words hurt more than Draco had intended them to and he immediately realized that he had hurt me. “I’m sorry.” He muttered and stretched his hand out. He waited for me to take it, but I pushed it away and got up instead. “Don’t be. It’s fine- I just thought that we could maybe take the next step, that’s all.” I said and turned my back on Draco in hopes that he wouldn’t notice the tears that had started to form in the corners of my eyes. I could hear Draco getting on his feet behind me, but I didn’t turn around. I didn’t want him to see that I was crying. “What’s wrong?” I heard Draco’s soft voice behind me, and it was almost unbearable. But instead of making me sad it made me angry instead and I turned around to face Draco, frantically wiping the tears away from my eyes. “What’s wrong? What’s
After a few minutes of complete silence Draco finally looked up from the ground, his eyes were still glistening slightly from his tears. “I’m guessing you’re here to yell at me some more for not talking to you for an entire week?” He questioned quietly as he wrapped his arms protectively around himself, almost like he was trying to ward off my words, even though I wasn’t going to yell at him. I shook my head and pushed myself away from the wall to stand up straight in front of him. Even though I was standing straight, Draco was still almost a head taller than me. “That’s not why I’m here. Even though I have to admit that it pissed me off.” I replied and looked slightly up to make eye contact with Draco.
I hope you enjoy the story so far~
(See the end of the chapter for
do that to him.” Finally saying it out loud for other people to hear as well felt great, but also sad. “I’m afraid it’s not mutual anymore though. I fucked up bad Pansy.” I mumbled and tried my best to stay composed. I had been crying way too much over these last couple of days, it just seemed like nothing was able to soothe the heartache. I even tried to use a spell that supposedly, if performed correctly, temporarily turns off your emotions. Pansy’s expression softened a bit as she looked at me. “I know Draco. But if Potter doesn’t realize what he’s saying goodbye to by ignoring you, then he’s a bloody idiot. You are one of the most amazing people I know.” She said and sent me a small smile before stretching a bit to place a kiss on my cheek. “I have classes to attend, but we can talk later if you’d like? I can even sing you a lullaby to help you sleep.” She said with a small laugh as she got up from the couch. I scowled at her, which just made her laugh more. “Alright, no lullaby. Got it.” She said before disappeared out of the common room to attend her last class before dinner.
“Thank you,” Draco says.
He didn’t think that even the talented Curse-Breakers at IUMC could do anything with it, but they’d likely take a crack at it regardless.
He gives her another scowl that’s only a bit exaggerated. “I might be. Keep pressing your luck and you’ll find out.”
at the fanged geranium. “It rained nearly the entire time I was there,” he says. “Not that it mattered as I was indoors most of the time.”
At least she’s supportive. He’d still half-expected her to try to talk him out of leaving the Manor, especially after she got a look at his flat, but she’d given him a smile that only looked a little strained and informed him that she’d asked the house-elves to fetch an old set of fine china down from the attic for him to have, because although he’s bought himself a set of everyday china, he apparently needs fine china, and a full set of silver as well. Draco doesn’t plan to do much entertaining, and his little dining table barely seats four so he’s not sure what she expects him to do with a service for thirty-six, but he’d accepted it as the olive branch he thought Narcissa meant it as, kept the tea set to use regularly and packed up the rest carefully into its protective boxes and tucked it away in his tiny attic. It’s the only thing up there.
“And we will, but—Look. Peter Harper won’t exist anymore after tonight. Neither will Desmond Dwyer,” Harper said, reaching out and taking Draco’s hands in his own. “Why don’t we take tonight to say good-bye properly, and then tomorrow we’ll start over. As ourselves.”
It takes him long minutes to pull himself together again.
A flare of pure rage explodes behind Draco’s ribs. Perhaps it’s because of how many nights he’s spent thinking of Potter back then, and how many nights he’s continued to think of Potter over the years. Perhaps it’s just that he’s always wanted Potter’s attention, and it still irks him as much as it ever has to see how little Potter cares about him. Potter was an enormous part of Draco’s adolescence. Apparently Draco was a small enough part of Potter’s that he found it easy to let go of entirely. To set aside and simply
Zelda returns with an armload of sassafras roots. “Oh, go on, I’ve got the shop,” she says as she sweeps by, and Draco takes a deep breath and inhales the scent she trails by in her wake, sweet and vaguely liquorice-y.
“The entryway,” Draco decides after a moment. Yes, he’ll have to see it every time he comes into the house, but unlike the kitchen or the living room, he doesn’t spend much time in the entryway so he won’t have to stare at it.
Harry runs through facts in his head, going through everything he knows about the people he worked for, the methods they use, the resources they’ve got at their disposal. “Three weeks,” he says. “That’s long enough to plan how to break into the Ministry. We’ll just have to be real careful in the meantime. Move every day. We should move now…” He starts to get up.
She goes bustling back across the street to her own shop, leaving Draco alone with Granger. Unable to put it off any longer, he takes a slow, deep breath and then heads over to her.
Draco draws the curtains with a swish of his wand. “Did you need something?”
he’s been avoiding since last November. It’s his least favourite periodical and it features lengthy articles by some of his least favourite writers.
“Yeah, okay,” Harry said. “You know, I had a really good time tonight.”
Harry looked at Draco. “Did you really?” he asked, delighted at the wonderful mental image with which his mind was now supplying him: tiny little Draco sitting in the Slytherin common room, laboring over an enormous pile of black fabric with a needle and thread. His brow had probably furrowed in concentration the same way it did in Potions class when he chopped ingredients.
And what did it say about Harry that he knew all of that and still missed him?
“All right,” Draco says. He’s curious as to why, but can’t exactly ask about it now, right after Potter’s said he didn’t want to say. He looks up at the sky, but can’t see the moon yet.
“...and closed every Monday,” he finishes. “Did you need to ask me something?”
“You like it?”
Harry snorted. “Malfoy, come on. Do you honestly think we’d be sitting here having such a wonderfully civil conversation if it had?”
“Barely,” Draco breathed, reaching for Harry. “Hardly at all. Just a tiny bit illegal.” His fingers slid around Harry’s hip, curved gently over the swell of Harry’s arse, and drew him in closer. “I could tell you all about it. I could list every last rule and regulation I’ve broken,” Draco said, peeking demurely up at Harry through his lashes. His warm breath ghosted over the head of Harry’s cock as he spoke. “But I can think of at least a dozen better uses for my mouth at present.”
“It really is,” Draco insists. “For several reasons. One, if we’re meant to be a couple, we ought to be seen together in public at least a few times. Two, there are several things we need to discuss. And three… I really do owe you for everything you’re doing for me. Dinner is the least I can do.”
and a flash of red sparks goes jetting off into the treetops. Someone shouts, and that answers
- - -x- - -
“Not badly,” Harry said, leaning away from Draco to spit more blue-tinged saliva onto the floor. He grimaced, coughed, and spat again. “Ugh. No, the cauldron missed me, thank Merlin. Minor burns, it feels like. I think I swallowed some of it. Got it up my nose and in my eyes, too.”
They talk for a bit more about Pansy and the different places she’s dragged Potter to over the years, and by the time he finally leaves, he appears far more relaxed than he was when he’d come in. When the door shuts behind him, Draco turns his attention back to his paperwork and his lunch. Thinking of Potter’s endearingly crooked smile, he doesn’t even notice that his soup’s gone cold.
Later, Harry wouldn’t be able to say what on earth had possessed him to do it. But watching the shape of his name on Malfoy’s lips ignited a burst of
“Yeah,” Draco rasps, and it’s ridiculous, isn’t it? That there’s an arrow sticking out of him? Ridiculous. It shouldn’t be in there. He reaches for it.
Ok, now it really hurts, but for his expression? It was worth it!
- Who are you talking about? – Draco asks, playing with his food and occasionally looking at the Gryffindor table. Blaise, next to him, is two seconds from hitting his head to the table.
- It was about the correct use of magic towards living being, - he answers. – But you’ll never write it down in time at this point –
“Well, where were you the whole day?”
- I mean… okay, nothing against it, he’s a jerk anyway, - I scroll my shoulders. She keeps staring at me. I tilt my head: did she just wanted to tell me that?
- Probably at the library -. More nervous than he should, but not totally a bad liar.
- We need to find excuses for them to see each other, - Pansy affirms. – We could frame them causing troubles and let them share the punishment! –
I let me fall to the table with a painful moan. Nope. I will never get up. Let me die looking at the dinner. It will be a fewer embarrassing dead than the first one, at least.
"I'm sure it'll be great," Draco said. "Though I've got beer on hand if it's unbearable. Are we getting plates or eating from the cartons like savages?"
(okay, maybe it could be a

next to sex during scenes. He knew he wanted sex with Draco, and he knew he wanted to explore the idea of ageplay and regression, but he wasn't positive that he wanted to mix them together. It hadn't felt sexual when he'd been colouring in Draco's living room before, but Harry didn't know if that was because of his headspace, or just that particular scenario. He knew plenty of people got off on the kink in a
"Any progress?" Harry asked Parvati the moment she came up from the dungeons. He was sitting on the floor up against the wall across from the door that led down to the lower levels, waiting for an update. Parvati had been part of the group that was currently questioning Foley, the group that
exploring this dynamic with you, and if you never felt up for any kind of kink beyond what we've been doing, I'd be genuinely satisfied. I wouldn't lie to you about that. If I thought there was any chance it might not be enough for me, I'd tell you straight off.
"And what's she got planned for a distraction? It would have to be massive if she's hoping it'll draw the bulk of the resistance away from standing guard here."
"Sure, I appreciate it," Harry replied. It
A flicker of motion from outside the window overlooking the back garden caught his eye and he paused, squinting into the night. Apocrypha swooped gracefully over the neighbouring rooftops, dodging the saplings Harry had planted last spring before alighting gracefully on the windowsill with a gentle hoot. Butterflies fluttered in Harry's stomach as he caught sight of the delicate roll of parchment tied to her left leg, and he detached it carefully before digging an owl treat from one of his pockets and offering it to Apocrypha. She snapped it up with a coo and then took off once more into the night, leaving Harry alone with his missive.
"Yeah, I know," Parvati said with a heavy sigh, sinking down the wall and sitting next to Harry on the floor. "She's too proud for that." She shuddered. "God, she's awful. I never really got all that close to Voldemort, but if he was anything like
Draco gave him a long, penetrating stare as Harry trailed off.
Harry took a long sip of coffee, before muttering into his mug, "I'm not
"Please?" he whispered, not begging, per se, but not
"Come on, Harry," Draco murmured, his voice low and strained as he clearly approached his own orgasm. "I want you to come for me, want to watch this big dick of yours come all over me."
What might have been several seconds or several minutes later, Harry blinked down at Draco, feeling floaty and fantastic. Godric he had needed that, and now that the spectacular shag was over with, he found himself moving on to the delightful afterglow part where all he wanted to do was cuddle and make out until he fell asleep in Draco's arms. Which could potentially become a bit awkward and embarrassing as he had no idea if Draco was a snuggler, but he supposed there was no time like the present to find out. He leaned down, giving Draco a slow, leisurely snog as Draco's softening cock slid out of him in a sticky glide. At some point Draco reached for his wand and cast a Cleaning Charm over them both.
, and it got even better as his hands began to wander down Harry's torso.
"I get that it's hard for you, Harry," Draco said, resting his forehead against Harry's and closing his eyes wearily. "We all have different strengths, and I know you'd be happier helping out somewhere where you could see the more tangible and direct benefits of your actions." He pulled back and gave Harry a wry smile. "You've always been a hands-on kind of bloke." Harry gave a weak chuckle, and Draco pulled away, running a hand through his hair and mussing the fine strands, his expression tormented. "I'm the reason why you've not already signed up to fight, and I know it makes me terrible and selfish and probably a massive hypocrite, but I don't think I could bear it, Harry, I really don't." He looked at Harry, his expression pleading, as if begging him for understanding, for forgiveness. "I've tried to convince myself that I could survive it, that
See, the thing was… Harry kind of had a massive cock. Which sounded like the dream when you were a teenaged boy sharing a dormitory with a bunch of
"They're not wrong, you know," Blaise said before taking a sip of his ridiculously expensive Japanese whisky. "It's good to take a break every now and then, recharge, see the world."
"Quiet isn't necessarily a bad thing, you know."
Malfoy looked at him like he was a few Gobstones shy of a full set. "I beg your pardon?"
Draco laughed and pressed a warm thigh up against Harry's groin where he was already half-hard. "Oh, it's clear. Though we should probably talk about that, too."
"Harry," Draco said, and for some reason the tenderness of his tone made Harry want to cry. "Look at me. Please?"
"Come on, say yes," Harry wheedled with a coaxing smile. "Just one date. It can’t hurt."
freaking out.
Harry's brow furrowed as he tried to process what Draco had said. "Munch?"
Harry blinked, feeling as if he was coming out of a daze, his entire being relaxed to the point of sleepiness. His mind was hazy, but every one of his blurry thoughts was focused on the soothing motions of Draco's fingers carding through his hair. It felt so nice, so good, and all Harry wanted to do was nuzzle into Draco's hand so he did, his heart leaping with joy at the distinct sound of pleasure that escaped Draco's lips.
"Not Quidditch, you dolt." Draco trailed his lips over Harry's collarbone, his voice crisp, posh and deliciously filthy. "The sex."
Harry couldn't deny there was something exciting about the waiting though, the slow build-up of tension crackling beneath every glance, every word. They were still finding their legs, figuring out if there could ever be something serious between them, but Harry was fairly certain when they
He followed Parvati down the back staircase, unsurprised to see that many of the other key players in the resistance were already seated in the formal-dining-room-turned-command-centre. All of the people that lived at the Manor were already there, of course, and several others who lived elsewhere—keeping a lower profile out in public in order to maintain key positions helpful to the resistance—had also turned up.
Not even with Voldemort had Harry felt this kind of bone-deep hatred, this desperate, clawing need to take his foe down by any means necessary. Perhaps because Harry was older now and had already lost so much. He'd lived through his war and made his sacrifices, only for a similar evil to crop up entirely too close to home. He wanted to make Foley pay for all the havok she'd wrought, for all the lives she'd destroyed. He wanted to make her
"Nothing yet, but Fathi's working on her."
Harry doesn't think he minds one bit.
, they're going to think the ex-Death Eater's chaining you up in his basement and beating you and—"
"You," Draco said sharply, his voice low, "are incorrigible. Good boys don't tease, not when they don't have time to follow through."
Harry hadn't ever thought about a Dom needing to end a scene because of their own crossed boundaries.
It wasn't as if he and Draco hadn't worked with one another before—they'd gone through three years of training together and had collaborated on multiple teams and task forces in the six years since they'd become fully-fledged Aurors.
"Got it, Thistle."
"You told me to trust you," Harry replied simply.
The walls around him were cracked and charred, little fires burning and beginning to grow and spread. He hadn't seen another person yet, dead or alive, but he could hear panicked shouts echoing down the halls, letting him know there were still people inside. He ran towards the sound, his heart pounding in his chest, blood rushing through his ears. Time and space seemed to warp around him as he ran, the walls around him shifting and blurring, interposed with snapshots of a different ruined building from what felt like a lifetime ago. Anguish out of place with this current moment enveloped him, threatening to bring him to his knees, but he fought his way through it, forcing it down deep inside where it belonged. There was too much at stake to get lost in memory.
Draco didn't have to tell him twice. Harry lifted his hips off the bed and shucked off his jeans and boxers before he could overthink. Once naked, though, there was no hiding from the fact that, with past partners, this was the point where things often went awry. Biting his lip, he chanced a glance up at Draco who was, as expected, staring open-mouthed at Harry's dick.
Draco swiveled his hips, grinding against Harry and causing them both to moan at the pleasurable friction. It felt so good, and normally Harry wouldn't have any problem at all frotting together until they both came in their pants like teenagers. But Harry had had enough of acting younger than his years for the night, so he wedged a hand between them and began working open Draco's flies.
But Draco shook his head almost regretfully as he stood.
"What if it weren't me you were being good for? What if"—he gasped, his hips twitching, clearly close to his peak—"what if you were being good for
It had been another wonderful afternoon, and Harry felt sleepily content as his adult brain slowly came back online as if it had finally recharged. It brought with it a renewed sense of awareness of Draco's body beneath Harry's own, so solid and strong. He squirmed as arousal began to pulse through him, and he mouthed at the patch of Draco's bare chest above his unbuttoned collar.
"It is, yeah. Tell you all about it over a pint?"
Not just because of the word itself, but who he pictured when he thought it. When Harry thought of himself in this hazy, blissful place, relaxed and safe and happy, his caretaker wasn't some nameless, faceless figure. Of course not. It was none other than Draco running those long, strong fingers through Harry's wild hair, telling him how sweet and perfect he was, how good he was being for him.
"Oh," Harry said, oddly pleased that Draco had been looking into things as well. "I did some research, too. There were definitely some things that didn't appeal to me, but some of it…" He gave Draco a sheepish smile. "I think maybe I'd like to try it. With you."
"Right, well, it's getting late, yeah? I should probably be heading out." He began to walk at a very quick pace that was definitely
talking about sex. Harry hadn't thought he'd be able to make it through that kind of conversation without jumping Draco's bones, so all talk of past relationships and sexual preferences had been unofficially tabled until they'd decided this thing between them was going somewhere and they were ready to take that next step. He'd really not expected their first conversation on the topic to be about Draco's secret penchant for kink, and Harry had no idea what it meant for their maybe-relationship. Would Draco expect Harry to submit to him? Could Harry do it if that was what Draco wanted? Would he
He sent the owl on with his reply, polishing off the rest of his sandwich before checking his watch. Harry still had a good four hours before he needed to shower and change and start on dinner. Already his brain felt full to bursting with everything he'd learned that day, and all he wanted at that moment was to shut off his mind, if only for a while.
"I've been here before, Harry," Draco said with a raised brow as he began undoing the buttons of his shirt. "You're not the first person Blaise has offered up his villa to. But I promise that story isn't nearly as interesting as you getting naked."
feeling quite wobbly. "Let's get you over the bed and heal you up."
Harry blinked. "How did you…?"
"And what, you think I'll snap and murder her in her cell?"
had barred Harry from joining over concerns of his 'temper' and 'ability to remain level-headed', which was bullshit. Not only were they trying to gain access to the wards to Foley's manor, but they needed to find out if she had anything planned in event of her capture given how many of her followers were still at large. Over the past few years Foley and her followers had become known for their violent attacks of public places and buildings; they were worse even than Voldemort, who'd stuck mostly to isolated targets. Foley's group had hit events and high-traffic areas across Ireland, and they'd also claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks in other parts of the UK as well, showing how long their reach was.
Harry's heart began to race with excitement. This could be it. "He must have something good."
want sex. With you, right now, in case that wasn't clear."
"Yes, I was," Draco said calmly. "Did you forget that I was the one who bought the colouring books? That I stayed with you the whole time while you played?"
Harry's heart began to race and he tore his gaze away, not even finishing the Cs. He'd known there was a lot on offer, but it was overwhelming to be confronted with it all at once. Had Draco already curated this particular list to represent the things he was personally interested in? Was Draco really into—Harry scanned the list and gulped—
"Okay…" Draco said slowly, his brow furrowed. "I think we probably need to have another, more specific, conversation about kink and the things we each want, and what it would mean for our relationship, to clear up some assumptions and misconceptions. I told you before, Harry: I don't need kink to be happy, though it is certainly a preference. How that manifests, however, is entirely up to us. It seems like perhaps there's something you could get from it, and I really like the thought of being the one who's able to give that to you. But that kind of dynamic—even if it's something we decide to experiment with, which we don't have to—it doesn't have to be all the time, and it absolutely doesn't detract from how I see you as a man and potential partner. You're not a child, Harry Potter, and I certainly don't think of you as one."
Harry nodded and wandered back to the guest room where he first changed. Falling asleep and waking up again had seemed to slip him out of the littlespace he'd been in for most of the afternoon, and Harry felt the rest of it fall away as he shucked off the little boy clothes, carefully folding them and placing them on the bed. It was like the burden of adulthood he always carried around had been placed once again on his shoulders, but it seemed somehow lighter than before, or at least more manageable. His session with Draco had refreshed him. He waited for the shame to come, but it was nowhere to be found; he felt too good. Harry wasn't so naïve as to think he'd escaped it entirely, but for now he just let himself enjoy its absence.
"As you wish," Draco murmured, ghosting a kiss against Harry's throat as he disengaged his hands from Harry's cock and climbed gracefully onto Harry's bed. He lounged back against the pillows, hands folded beneath his head, looking haughty and gorgeous, a prince waiting to be serviced. His cock was hard and leaking against his stomach, making Harry's mouth water and his arse ache as he tried to decide if he had the patience to give it a quick suck before moving on to the night's main event. Harry'd always been a fan of giving head, but when he sucked somebody off he preferred to have the time to really luxuriate in the experience and drive them wild. Tonight, he was too desperate for Draco to fuck him to really do justice to a blow job. He'd just have to save it for next time. And there
"Yeah, all right," Harry said, snuggling in closer. "As long as there's coffee in the morning."
"I'm sure you're all wondering why I've called you here for this emergency meeting, so let's not delay any longer. As you all know, Byrne has managed to ingratiate himself with Lady Foley's inner circle, and he's brought us some news." He gestured towards Byrne, who nodded calmly.
Highly Desirable
Harry shuddered, overwhelmed. Between the dick in his arse, the hands jerking him off, Draco's filthy words and the sound of Harry's name on Draco's tongue… well, Harry didn't stand a chance. He sat down fully on Draco's cock and came with a long moan, his hands gripping Draco's chest. Draco swore, low and emphatic, and vaguely Harry was aware of his hips twitching and bucking beneath Harry as he chased his release.
Though Harry hoped more was on the table tonight than just these—admittedly magnificent—kisses, because his cock was so hard it was almost painful, and he felt like he might actually combust if he didn't get off soon, preferably with Draco. He moaned, grabbing on to Draco's hips and arching against him in a way he hoped was sexy and suggestive. Apparently he missed the mark, because Draco seemed to take that as his cue to break off the kiss and slide off the bed. He looked fit as hell with his mussed hair and kiss-swollen lips, though less hot was the look of concern in his eyes as he looked Harry over.
out there and he'd rather have a partner who preferred playing with pain as opposed to building blocks?
Robards looked deeply uncomfortable, as if we wanted to comfort Harry but wasn't quite sure how. Strong arms wrapped around him, and he was filled with a momentary elation before he realised those arms weren't Draco's, but Ron's. He sagged into him as Robards gave him another compassionate look.
longer dry spells and had been perfectly fine, but his body was used to regular sex now and wasn't keen on going without.
… I needed some air."
It was just a bit of mental experimentation. It was nothing at all to worry about.
Harry growled, and Draco stopped pretending to put up a fight. He'd been wanking to the idea of him and Harry getting off after a Quidditch game since they were at Hogwarts—this was a bloody dream come true. He helped Harry shove down his trousers, his hard prick bobbing free as Harry dropped eagerly to his knees.
"Then do it, Harry," Draco growled. "Come for me."
Thankfully, that wasn't necessary, because a moment later Fathi's fingers twitched, and suddenly the forest was filled with shouts and the bright flash of spellwork as the resistance attacked.
"You show it just fine," Draco replied, his voice husky, before drawing Harry into a toe curling kiss.
"All the others are quite distracted by Seamus's latest tale of housemate woe," Blaise told Harry as he sat down. Harry snorted. Poor Seamus lived in a house with five other people, all of whom appeared to be absolutely bonkers. They'd all tried to convince Seamus to move out at one time or another, but Seamus never did; Harry was pretty certain Seamus actually liked the chaos, if for no other reason than he always had a new story to tell at pub night.
"Thought we'd try something new tonight," Draco said as he ground his erection against Harry's.
to die for all she's done. But I didn't kill her, did I? Even though I could have." He gave Parvati a bitter smile. "This isn't my first Dark Lord, you know. I'm
that Hermione had clearly helped him perfect, before turning to Malfoy.
fan and went to a lot of their concerts. Harry remembered how panicked she'd been when they got news of the attack, terrified Padma might have been there, which she thankfully hadn't been.
"Yes, Harry, I'll see you tomorrow."
In one fluid motion he rolled them over, pinning Harry to the bed and taking Harry's lips in a hungry kiss. Harry shuddered into it, sliding his hands through Draco's hair and arching up into the firm weight of his body. They'd barely even started but Harry was keyed up and ready to go, already desperate for Draco's touch. He wondered what Draco had planned, eagerly hoping that getting fucked was on the menu. They'd not gone that far yet, and it had been ages since Harry'd had a proper shag. Right now, getting fucked through the mattress sounded like just about the best idea ever.
. But Draco wanted Harry to indulge his desires, wanted to help him do it, and already the feelings inside of Harry were too big for words.
"How are you feeling?" Draco asked as he rubbed a hand soothingly up and down Harry's bare back.
While Harry had been gaping, Draco had taken the opportunity to get himself back under control. He straightened, brushing off his robes and giving Harry a brisk nod.
"What is it?" Harry asked, desperation beginning to well within him. Whatever it was, it was bad.
"Harry," Draco called out. There was something in his voice—worry and anxiety and self-recrimination—that made Harry's heart clench, but Harry couldn't stay, not even for Draco.
- You’re right, - Harry nods. He seems to have only half of his attention to the conversation. Who knows what he’s thinking about: Voldemort? The war and how no one says anything to him to protect him? Or the scariest thought: McGonagall test next week!
Hermione nods next to me, sitting on the stairs. We look at the little window to the corridor below us. Pansy, leaning at the wall right there, winks at us. Ron, at the opposite wall of the corridor, just raises his thumb.
- This has nothing to do with you, Malfoy! – Miles hisses back, because he didn’t already show everyone how mature he is.
Her eyes seems to sparkle at my words. Before she can add something, Ron finally speaks. – Thanks Ginny, see you later –
Even with eyes closed, I
I dedicate to him my best ice glare. – Has this anything to do with you? -. I would raise my eyebrow, if only I was capable of it.
- Those are the conditions for our help, - she insists. I look at Pansy: she’s bored like me, but we can’t suffer a whole year of endless pining. We sigh and nod.
- How. They. Can. Be. So. STUPID! – it’s my calm, relaxed answer while I raise my head from the table.
She stare at me with ice in her eyes. I smile back as I can’t feel her homicidal intent.
“…thank you, System”
- Weasley girl, - I reply. Ron looks at with a frown, probably trying to understand when we met each other.
The peaceful atmosphere breaks when someone opens the secret door and storm in.
I don’t answer and focus on eating a couple of eggs. My character is… really like me! I always imagined doing those stuff at Hogwarts! What a shame I wasn’t here to do them in person… But, well, if everyone remember them, it’s a win anyway!
My silence must be a very good answer. She sighs.
The System woke up again, apparently.
- Absolutely! – I smile with the most innocent expression I can do. She doesn’t seem reassured at all. – Could you tell me where are the books about the wands? Their story, how we started to use them, how they work… -
- He’s a student at Hogwarts School, - it’s her answer. – He can’t behave that way under this roof, nor he can hurt another student –
Draco goes to bed. Eventually. After two hours of comments on Harry Potter annoying character. I spend this time sharing desperate looks with Blaise.
- Do you want to explain what happened? – she asks.
- What a cruel friend I have! –
- Nice talk, - I gets up, adjust my uniform, and put my wand back in the uniform. – I disagree with everything you said, but I’m proud of your increased speaking skills! – I smile at him like he’s a three-year-old baby. Then, I do as to walk away from him.
-…no? –
- What happened? –
- Who… Who’s Aurora? – I repeat, sure to have heard bad. It can’t be.
- Being the most annoying human being ever until he runs away and prays his parents to brake the engagement, - I affirm.
Transfiguration is… boring as hell. I thought it would be incredibly interesting, with all the schemes and rules of magic to learn to understand how to use them at our will… But it’s only difficult and boring. Not that Professor McGonagall isn’t a good teacher, but I really prefer practice lessons rather the theory’s ones. I try to follow her and copy her schemes and rules, but I end up staring at my notes.
Also... OC/Ginny is starting... muahahahahahahahahaha!
- Come on! It will never work otherwise! –
I said what I had to say. And now I feel so tired, like this speech took all my energies.
Silence follows my words, but it’s not an uncomfortable silence. It’s more like we’re not communicating with words, but with our simple presence for each other. Luna gives me some raw meat and I step closer to the Thestral, a hand raised to them. A little Thestral slowly walks to me, then takes the meat with a quick move and run back to the others.
- He’s an idiot, - Zabini affirm.
Come on, Aurora, just focus!
After another staring session, she sighs and gets up. – Professor Snape is already taking care of mister Bletchley punishment, go to him if he bothers you again. And… - she hesitates. – You can go to my office for any problem –
- Why did you get one our carriage? – she asks.
to know it before, but hey, what can I ask from the idiotic System I have?
Oh no. I think I know this sweet voice. I turn very, very slowly. Here she is. The nightmare. The most hated character of the whole saga. The real villain of the story. Dolore Umbridge.
- Oh, come on! – I exclaim. – Still feeling guilty? –
Damn, she’s good at it!
My last thought is how much I’m lucky to die: at least I won’t have to face the disgusting face of my aunt and her realization that all the years she spent calling me a useless piece of trash she was, in fact, right.
- Who? –
- Miss Reckless? –
Following the 3D map, I arrive in the library in just ten minutes. I inhale the beautiful smell of books… and immediately sneeze. I forgot that ancient books = dust, okay? Stop laughing!
- You know what? I reconsidered, - Pansy glares at him with disgust in her eyes. – You’re totally useless, idiotic piece of shit -. She turns and get out the secret passage. I’m following her -before I end up really hitting one of the main characters- when Hermione jump trying to stop me. I don’t think. I only see a figure jumping towards me.
- You really don’t know? – Pansy asks, pain in her voice.
- Are you thinking of not going to the afternoon lessons, again? – a familiar voice tease me from a three at the border of the forest. A second later, Ginny lands in front of me, a grin on her face, eyes sparkling.
Let’s get it straight.
Pansy is smiling. And my stomach chooses this moment to remind me I don’t eat anything since yesterday’s lunch.
- We need to think about a plan, - she continues. – So use you’re shitty troublemaker brain and help me! –
- Oh, - it’s my clever answer.
- It’s still something impossible, - Draco says.
- Oh, no, he really isn’t my type. But… Hermione Granger! – I turn to the golden trio, who got off the carriage and assisted at the whole scene in astonishment. Hermione looks at me in terror.
With another sight, I sit down between the shelves and start to read.
They don’t realize I didn’t go to History of Magic. No professor came to scold me, so I take it as a full win! My friends don’t even try to stop me.
I sit on a red loveseat next to a window and start to read.
- Not if I can do something about it, - I reply. – And trust me, I
“System! The insults!”
- Aurora? Aurora? Hey! –
- I’ll wait you at the dormitory tonight! – says Pansy. – I need your help with something! – .
- You’ve sit in the wrong place at the banquet the first year, - It’s Pansy’s answer. She doesn’t even try to deny she’s evil.
- Ehm… sleepwalking? –
So. The occidental world has always done this, so they don’t even think there could be another way. The oriental world… No books about it, but if I think about their traditions, I can see a sort of pattern they could have used for magic.
were you dreaming? –
Never again. Next time I’ll invent another way to escape him, but never again a run like this!
- Even if we all know they will kill us if they’ll find out we think that, - Pansy adds.
- Yeah, sure, - this is the red-head near Harry, so I guess it’s Ron Weasley. – So you can report what we say to your parents? –
I let go his wrist and turn around to finally find some quiet place to work on my magic without idiot’s interruptions. I’m at the top of the stairs when I hear him.
A worm idiot strickes again, but Ginny's at the rescue!
- Well, I’m tired, - I say to Ginny. – It seems like I will stand up your brother. Do you know any good place to shake off some idiot’s feelings –
- Everyone on his own way, then! – I point at the door. – After you –
- You seems exceptionally quiet today, - Pansy turns at me. – You’re not even complaining how annoying I am! –
Okay, this time I have no idea how it ended up there.
Desperate times calls desperate actions!
- Potter! –
- That’s strategy, - I replay.
“You’re evil, you know that, right?”
But what “something” should I use?
- Yep, it’s Aurora, - he nods at Draco.
- I know you don’t find my subject interesting, - she starts. – I wanted to ask you what your plans for the GUFO are –
- And your point is? –
- Sit down, miss Reckless, - she says. I obey, hoping to take off that look from her.
- Oh, the usual, - Pansy answers. – Aurora’s death… You know, - she winks at me.
The first thing I hear is a scream in my right ear. A very annoyed scream.
Aanndddd she’s staring at me. Again.
- Stop there! – Hermione looks at us with an expression so severe that for a moment I think to see Professor McGonagall. – No breaking rules, no causing troubles, no taking hours that Harry could use to study or exercise on Quidditch –
- If my brother won’t ruin everything, - it’s her answer.
- What are
The “Yes” lights up and the window disappears.
- Of course not! –
“Just answer!”
I raise my eyes from the book I’m currently reading. – Pansy? Weren’t you at the lesson? – .
- But… And he’s a son of two death eaters! – Ron doesn’t seem to want to shut up very soon.
- I’m fine! – I raise my wrist to show her. – Madame Pomfrey fixed it! –
fighting, and they even didn’t realize all this tension they feel is attraction!
I blink. Blink again.
I can’t wait…
So... yes! I'm not completely dying on my styudies but I will soon, so I'm writing as much as I can for now!
- Seriously? What are you, three? –
“What about the weird percentages of characters depths?”
The kids that were studying and minding their business either run away immediately, scared, or glance angry at us. Pansy glances back and takes her wand. – Do I have to repeat myself? –. After these words, even the last ones get up and leave.
Immediately, a 3D map of Hogwarts appear in front of my eyes.
At my words, Draco holds out his hand to Blaise. He sighs and gives him two galleons.
- Of course I do! -. Wait. I’m not completely certain… but I’m sure I would recognize him if he’d approach me! I would sense his “idiot aura” and understand it’s him!
- It’s little, you can hide it under your clothes and nobody will know I gave it to you, - Luna affirms.
- Sure! – I wave at them running to the library. Only to realize I have no idea how to arrive there.
I smile like I’m not internally praying for a miracle. – Professor! Good morning! –
- Aurora? –
After I controlled if there’s someone in the corridor, I cross the legs, close my eyes and start.
- We won’t ask help to a half-blood and a traitor of his blood! –
- I’m a prefect, you’re right, and if you won’t calm down and go back to your dormitory immediately, I will report you –
I mean, yes, other professors could find out I’m not at my lesson and punish me… But only if they catch me!
- Sorry, I wasn’t thinking about you for a while and it took me some moments to remember who you are, - I smile innocently. He’s now shacking from the anger. It shouldn’t be so funny to make him angry, right?
She sigh in relief. – What’s your plan? –
- Dinner? – I repeat. I’m still half in the book, it’s not my fault if my neurons haven’t reconnect to the world yet!
- But I don’t know? –
Pansy and Blaise look at each other and burst in laughing. I’m too busy looking at a damn written that literally floats in the air.
And… well, she’s kinda right.
- Guys! – I interrupt them. Last time they continued to discuss for an hour, I would like to avoid it, thank you so much. – We have a plan to do –
Absolutely not!
I do it again. And again. And again. Until I can recognize my wand’s magic from my energy even when they connect and became one.
An elbow between my ribs make me painfully come back to reality. I can’t help but hiss and dedicate a deadly glare to Draco. He tilts his head towards the teacher.
I eat really fast and run to the library. I would went this morning, but I couldn’t miss another class, so I’ll have to use this hour. Madame Pince checks if I’m alone right after I entered.
