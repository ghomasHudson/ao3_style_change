Harry reined in his frustration and ran a hand through his messy hair. They’d had their interview with Ernest Foxley scheduled for early that morning. When he hadn’t shown up, they sent out a team to go find him and bring him in, but Harry had assumed he’d just forgotten or mixed up the time. He was a weak lead, at best. And nothing about him had suggested that he was involved and certainly not that he’d be a flight risk.
“So, no. I don’t think magical creatures are half-breeds or less than. And I don’t think house-elves deserved the treatment they received under wizarding rule, or even in my household growing up.” Draco cleared his throat and picked his mug back up. “I know words are cheap, but I hope you believe me. I care that you know all that, actually.”
Draco looked up at him, his eyelids heavy, before grasping Harry’s sides and pulling him closer. Harry closed his eyes and tried to let go, forget about everything else and get lost in the moment—in the soft moans, the gentle caresses. His heart clenched with just how much he cared for Draco, how much he loved him already. Harry knew what their relationship had been turning into over the past few weeks, but he still found himself surprised at just how deep it ran.
Later that afternoon, Harry entered the staff room, taking a deep breath to catch his breath. He tried to school his face, but the large grin he was sporting wouldn’t be suppressed. Malfoy looked up, his furrowed brow softening as Harry approached the table and pulled out a chair.
Harry grabbed their used glasses and headed to the bar, taking a deep breath. He needed to order some food also—the alcohol on an empty stomach was hitting him hard, nearly as hard as the realization of just how attracted he was to the Potions professor on the other side of the pub. His feelings certainly had softened for the man over the past two weeks as they made their plans and attempted to execute them. Harry had even found himself having fun, despite their lack of any success, but he was still unprepared for just how intense his crush had got.
Draco continues to lightly drag the flogger along Harry’s body, lighting up the nerve endings along the reddened skin. Goose pimples break out across Harry’s body, and he’s surprised his cock is already so hard. Normally after two orgasms, it takes more work to get him going again. But his cock is ready to go, bobbing up against his stomach.
After several disgruntled meetings, Ron managed to get a reduced sentence offer for Isabelle George, provided she had any useful information about both cases. Aurors Higgins and Perry would interview her for potential evidence on their case, and then Harry and Mel would take over for their case.
Harry nodded against Draco’s shoulder and neck. “I’m sorry I left without saying anything this morning.”
“You know how it is,” he continued with a sigh, hating himself a little for this act. “Everything always has to be done by Monday, not like we’d
“He hits on you every single time you talk to him. Tries to get you away by yourself, asks you to do date-like activities. Remember his dinner invitation two weeks ago?”
“Yes, sir.” Harry swallowed. Draco rarely sucked him off to completion, but this… It wasn’t something Harry wanted often, but given the chance, he’d be crazy not to ask.
Part of him wanted to just continue to rub it in, but another part, the part that may have actually matured over the past ten years found him just not wanting that sort of conflict in his life anymore. He’d come into the year determined to be professional—he really didn’t need another repeat of the Falcons and press situation. And his foray into charity work after that career hadn’t worked out much better. Really, Harry learned he just needed to stay away from the press, reporters, and events where the press were anywhere near him. But with this fresh start, he felt like he needed to prove to himself that he could be professional. Even if Harry still couldn’t stand the git, Malfoy seemed a good place to start.
The students were shouting and pointing at a large plump bird that was nearly as tall as a first-year student running through the Quidditch pitch. After a moment of confusion, Harry remembered Hagrid’s lost Diricawl.
“For fuck’s sake, Harry.” Draco stood up, running his hand through his hair again before pacing the small room. “Of course you can stay. Stay as long as you need.”
It was surreal—seeing himself, or his body to be exact, sitting across from him in their office. It wasn’t Polyjuice like they had first hoped, and the effects didn’t seem to be wearing off on their own, either. The best they could hope for now was that the Ministry Potions Lab could figure out an antidote. The potions in the illegal lab were known as Party Pops—illegal single-use potions that created a range of euphoric effects. Supposedly, they were fun, enjoyable…and not supposed to cause this.
“I’ve never been so sure of anything.” Harry threaded his fingers through Draco’s hair. The upcoming raid—the looming of
“God, I can’t believe that bullshit is still going on,” Draco said after a minute, clearly digesting this new bit of information. “Well, I’m extra glad I left it all behind.”
“Good boy.” Draco bends over to kiss him on the forehead and Harry heats at the praise. “I’m putting you in the corner restraints today; I want access to every inch of your body.”
Malfoy had gone back to grading papers, and Harry allowed himself a moment to look at the man. Malfoy still looked like his same pointy self. Sure, he’d grown into himself a bit, and his shoulders were definitely broader, he was still Malfoy. While Minerva’s little speech about the man had made Harry determined not to muck up his new job by bringing up their old baggage, he hadn’t really thought Malfoy had changed that much.
“Next is that you two rest up. I need you back to full strength before we dig around too much.” Ron gave Harry a look that clearly meant he would not be able to pull his usual bullshit of going back to work too soon. Harry nodded.
His face flushed, and he ducked his head slightly as he nodded. Instinctively, he wanted to correct her, but he forced himself to remember that it didn’t matter what she thought. It didn’t even matter if she guessed Harry was gay, really. He’d likely never run into her anywhere but this pub, but nevertheless he couldn’t help the panicked feeling after years of conditioning himself to keep it secret. He was struck by how strange it was that this woman he didn’t even know might actually be the second person to know this about him. The thumping noise from upstairs was back, and he found himself increasingly irritated as it seemed to raise his heart rate whenever he was around it.
After a sharp smack on Harry’s arse, Draco steps back, and Harry forces himself not to scramble into position. God, he loves this. Being used, being of service. He already knows that he’s going to spend the better part of the day rock hard and leaking. After sinking slowly to his knees in front of Draco’s large and ornate desk, he crawls in the space underneath, turning around and getting into position.
Harry grabbed the letters and notes with specific dates and walked out of his office, heading straight to the lifts. It was a long shot, but he had learned over the years that sometimes those paid off. And if it did, this was definitely a job best left for a Saturday when most everyone would be out of the office. With any luck, he could get in and out without anyone knowing he’d been there. During the week, he’d need a warrant or, at the least, an interdepartmental agreement. And technically he knew he should have a warrant even for this, but that would only give the person involved time to cover their tracks. The fatigue in his bones was being replaced with the buzz of tracking down a lead, that edge of excitement that energised him.
Draco pulls on his pyjama top and blows out the candles. Just as he starts to put the candles away, he hears the Floo sound downstairs. No one should be calling this late. With a frown, Draco heads quietly downstairs to see Molly Weasley’s head in the flames.
Draco sighed melodramatically and huffed, before dropping a chaste kiss on Harry’s lips. “I suppose.” Draco twisted around and grabbed the phone, handing it to Harry.
He looked over at Malfoy, who seemed to have noticed the same and sighed, before jerking his head toward the door. Harry gathered his satchel, shoving his lesson planning notebook inside and following the man out to the hallway.
Harry mumbled something and pushed through the kitchen into the sitting room and then out to the balcony where two women were smoking and talking. Harry nodded and went to the far end, relieved to be out of the oppressive noise of the party. After leaning up against the building, he let out a long breath, wishing he hadn’t drunk quite so much. Even the building around him seemed to be spinning a bit. The two women on the other end of the balcony continued to talk about something in hushed tones and left Harry alone, much to his relief.
“I wasn’t sure about the state of your kitchen so I ran out for some breakfast.” Draco put a couple takeaway cups on the bedside table and gently tossed a small brown bag at Harry, before shrugging out of his coat and climbing in the bed next to Harry. “I didn’t know what you liked, but I found a coffee shop a few streets over that had a fantastic looking avocado toast.”
Dinner actually goes well. They have entire conversations that are uninterrupted by children, eat some excellent food, and drink too much wine. By the time they head home, they’re too drunk to apparate safely, so they call a taxi to get them to the nearest Floo. Draco flat out refuses to use the Knight Bus when he's been drinking; his stomach is barely strong enough for it under normal circumstances.
Harry currently doubted the veracity of her statement. He hadn’t known he could get physically exhausted from trying on clothes, but here he was. Had he not frequently trained to keep in shape for his job, he’d have been worrying about what that said about his fitness and health.
“Oh my god. You are the absolute worst.” Harry rolled his eyes but couldn’t stop a smile from forming on his face. “We’re not just friends.”
Harry pressed a soft open-mouthed kiss to the red ink before moving just below Draco’s heart, tracing along the spiraling roots of the large tree over his pec. Harry then traced along the trunk, watching as Draco’s nipple pebbled underneath his touch, and then along the branches and leaves. He dragged his finger above the branches, tracing the birds in flight across his shoulder.
Harry and Mel stepped over the threshold into a small run-down flat. The smell of pot and stale cigarette smoke hung in the air, and Harry had to work at not wrinkling his nose.
There was a pop, and Harry turned to see Auror Savage drop a can on the pile of Portkeys before heading over to them with a smile.
And with neither of them married or with children, and all the obligations that come with that, they’d each been around when the other had needed support. They’d been there for one another through Harry’s meltdowns over his fame, through Ginny’s worst breakups, and through the ups and downs of both of their careers.
Montgomery put his hand on Isabelle’s arm. This was why Harry loved when suspects and interviewees agreed to take Veritaserum, they always offered more information than was asked. It was impossible to not
Harry took a long drink of his water, finishing it off. It had been a mistake to come. Just hanging out at the pub it had been easy to forget that Draco had a whole life out there. He’d had nearly fifteen years of a life outside of the magical community—friends, work, dating, all of it. Harry knew vaguely about it, but being there in the middle of it, he realised just how much he hadn’t ever really fit into Draco’s life. Even as they continued to become closer friends, Harry would never really fit into Draco’s life any more than Draco would in his.
Draco moves slow, his tongue circling the head, swirling patterns on the underside of Harry’s cock. Harry moans and squirms and whimpers. His eyes squeeze tight as he gets lost in the sensations, unable to form a coherent thought beyond
Edwards flicked his wand, making a parchment appear. “Once I hold my wand to the paper, go ahead and say what you want to say.” He made a complicated motion and then rested the tip of the wand on the parchment, before nodding to Harry to start.
“There were quite a few reasons when it came down to it. First, it was only a few years after the war. So, while my father might have started making connections for me at the Ministry, no one actually would have wanted to hire me. It’s one thing to hire a Malfoy as a favour, knowing there’d be some payoff down the road, and an entirely different thing to hire a down and out, recently disowned Malfoy. Especially one with no real work experience,” he added.
After a long moment, Draco pulled back. He turned his head and scanned the hall, then pulling Harry roughly with him towards one of the doors.
Harry can feel himself growing hard again under Draco’s ministrations. But before he can wonder how long until he comes again, there’s another whisper.
With a contented sigh, Draco tucked himself in and crouched down, dragging a finger through the mess on Harry’s stomach, drawing circles on his skin, seemingly mesmerised as he mixed their come together, as a small smile played on his lips.
delivered to his doorstep. He don’t let no owls in his place—paranoid that one. He meets the owl on the doorstep at a quarter after seven every morning. Then he goes back in and leaves for work at eight. Every morning except Sunday, he does the same. Then he comes home at six and he turns off his lights at ten,” she explained as she slowly walked over to them, leaning heavily on her cane.
” He thinks he might babble “green” several more times between curses as he tilts his hips left and right trying to escape Draco’s hand. But it does no good, there’s no escape.
After a moment, he decided he’d given himself enough time and straightened out, his aching body protesting at the movement. He flicked his wand to summon a thick envelope and gathered up all the parchment, shuffling the evidence in the envelope. After closing and securing the flap, he tapped his wand on it, shrinking it down to the size of a Muggle credit card. He pulled out the moleskin pouch around his neck and shoved the file in, just to be safe, and then headed out of his office and to the Floos. He contemplated heading straight to Ron’s to tell him about the files but decided against it. No need to interrupt his weekend just for even more clues that didn’t lead anywhere solid.
“We’ve got one person dead, two people missing, and about five hundred contacts to follow up with,” she replied without looking up, still flipping back and forth between files.
but before the news came on…” David looked like he was straining himself to remember, his eyes flicking up to the ceiling as if in deep thought. “I think that was in the afternoon. But then I had that frozen pizza, so I got distracted. I remember asking Draco if he wanted some though, so it was definitely after the frozen pizza!”
He opened the door and was hit by a blast of cold air, colder than was typical for London. Draco stood before him, wearing a thick wool coat, a pale green scarf wrapped around his neck.
“Well, just one thing to do now.” Draco circled his arms around Harry and grabbed the cards on the right, counting them silently and slowly. Harry’s chest continued to heave, his cock bobbing in the air. He was so worked up, having been edged and brought back down with pain over and over for all 26 rounds. He tried to count along with Draco but quickly lost track, so he let his mind clear. Draco would let him know one way or the other.
“Erm—” Fuck it. He could stay and have a pint if he wanted, he thought rebelliously. “I guess a lager or a stout? Not a big IPA fan.”
Harry looked around the room again and knew he couldn’t stay there. He grabbed the phone, pulled himself up, and stepped into the hallway before apparating to Grimmauld Place on the spot.
Harry knew there were several complicated spells that could date evidence that the Magical Forensics team used, but he’d never had reason to learn them as a field Auror. His instincts were to call the Aurors straight in, but wasn’t sure how Draco would take that request. And Harry didn’t want to scare him off; this was still his family home and his father’s belongings, regardless of their history. Plus, they didn’t even know what they might find yet.
The opinionated spectators of former Headmasters didn’t help either. That was until Snape decided to make a snide comment, and Harry saw red. Dumbledore followed shortly after, with some vague and “all-knowing” drivel, and the next thing they knew, Harry and Draco turned to the portraits of the two people they were angrier at than each other. They spent the better part of the next two hours yelling at the canvas echoes of the former headmasters. Finally, once they were completely and thoroughly exhausted, they went to Hogsmeade for a drink that turned into seven.
“This looks like something Lockheart would have kept in his office.” Draco snorted as he balled up the cloth and tossed it aside before stepping in front of the ornate mirror.
But as dangerous as the raid might be, it was the second stage of the plan—the part that involved making numerous arrests at the Ministry without tipping anyone off—that made Harry’s stomach twist. And he wasn’t alone in feeling from the looks on his friends’ and colleagues’ faces.
Draco nodded. “That’s fine. There’s a restaurant around the corner, Bread, they’ve got good sandwiches.”
“I believe you,” Harry said. “I just—I needed to check, and not have any more surprises this week, I guess?”
Grabbing the cane, he made his way across his bedroom to grab his dressing gown and then headed out into the hallway and down the stairs to the sitting room. Technically, he was supposed to be on bed rest for another day. The Healer had said he could get up and start moving around on Friday and expected he’d have a full range of movement by Monday, though he would likely still feel a little fatigued.
“Come on, just a few more outfits,” Ginny said as she manhandled him into another changing room. “It’s not actually going to kill you.”
Instead of closing the gap, bringing their lips together, Draco shifts on the bed and drops lower, ghosting his lips over Harry’s jaw. A teasing breath travels the length of Harry’s neck as Draco moves lower, never leaning in, never making contact.
Harry slowly awoke, a pain shooting down his neck in its cramped position. He opened his eyes to a view of a blurry sitting-room; they must have fallen asleep while talking the previous night, tired as they were. His head was propped against the arm of the sofa, legs stretched out and tangled with Draco’s, curled up tightly on the other end. It appeared Harry had claimed most of the sofa. He patted his jeans for his glasses and then stretched over the side, careful not to wake Draco, as he felt around on the floor until he found them. Putting them on, he saw Draco in what could only be described as a highly uncomfortable position, head propped up over the edge of the opposite arm and shoulder crammed into the corner.
It’s not uncomfortable due to the spellwork, but Harry never feels more exposed than when he’s in these restraints. His arms are pulled out, his legs spread-eagle, and every inch of his body is on display. More importantly, it is accessible for Draco to do with as he pleases.
“So—and there’s no judgment here, I’m just asking—you’ve been closeted for nearly twenty years?” he asked carefully.
Too soon, the t-shirt was pulled down, covering up the beautiful artwork. Draco’s eyes darted to the space on the bed next to Harry.
Harry shoved the last broom in place, looking over the state of the shed. It was already a mess, bits of mud and grass everywhere. A handful of the brooms already needed repairs, too.
“Really, she’s perfect for the position,” Harry continued. “I wanted a change of pace, and Ron has offered me a trainer position. I think it might be a good fit, actually. I just want to take a few days to think about it.”
His mind was too languid to even begin to process it all—how much had just changed. He knew without a doubt this wasn’t just sex. What they’d both seen, what that meant… Harry knew it would never be the same. He felt like he should be panicking, wondering about the future, but he only felt the warm embrace of contentment. This was Draco. He’d known him nearly his whole life, and if they’d managed to work through the war and their baggage to get to the close friendship they developed, Harry had no doubt they could work through anything a relationship might throw at them. So he let himself close his eyes and just enjoy it.
Ron rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean.” He looked back and forth on the street. “You better get out of here, then. I’ll make up some story about where you are staying for the night… a safe house or something, and I’ll let them know I did the initial interview. I don’t want you coming into work on Monday either, you are on ‘extended medical’ leave as far as anyone is concerned. You and Mel—”
Harry sat up in bed. The Transfigured cane that Draco had made by borrowing Harry’s wand the previous day was leant up against his bedside table.
“Another drink?” Harry asked. He stood up a bit too quickly, knocking his leg into the table in the process and jostling the contents.
Draco slipped his hand around Harry’s cock. This time he went slower, working him up. Harry glanced down at the deck. It looked like only a couple to go. He was quickly right back at the edge with Draco’s slow and firm strokes.
A momentary panic nearly settled over him as he was reminded that they were at work… in the middle of the day. But then he looked at the expression of pure lust on Draco’s face and couldn’t seem to bring himself to care. So, he toed off the designer shoes and pulled Draco’s trousers the rest of the way off, and then slid off the tight black pants before adding them to the pile of clothes.
As Harry unravelled the ropes around his hips and groin, he became almost overwhelmed by the feeling of openness, the lack of constraint. He whimpered as Harry lowered himself back to a seated position and continued to loosen the ropes around Draco’s torso. Draco felt his throat constrict, his eyes burning. His body felt so light, free.
Slowly and steadily, Harry continued to pull out all the way out to the tip of his cock before pressing in hard and firm. On a particularly rough thrust, Draco fell forward on his elbows with a moan.
Ron cast several strong privacy spells around the room. He looked exceptionally tired and worn out, far beyond what missing one night’s sleep would have caused. When Ron was done casting, he cast another series of spells to check the strength of his protection and privacy spells. Harry felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. Those weren’t standard procedure spells. Something was wrong.
Draco barked out a laugh. “Well, you’re right about that. And I was definitely jealous of the amount of attention you got.”
In a surprising turn of events, Narcissa had volunteered to have her interview conducted under Veritaserum. It seemed she wanted to find her husband’s killer sooner rather than later and preferred that the Aurors weren’t following dead-end leads, such as herself or her son. Unfortunately, she also hadn’t had much information to give them. It seemed she had stayed out of his business completely. In what was likely a slip due to the Veritaserum, she even had explained that since the war, she had wanted no part of anything Lucius was involved in. Harry had been surprised but certainly understood her position.
He wondered if it was enough, if Draco could be attracted to someone like him. Or, really, what kind of men Draco was attracted to at all? Were they young and fit? Older and impossibly stylish? Harry had noticed the man’s eyes lingering on one of Lila’s artist friends earlier and had to stamp down the jealousy that threatened to boil up at the sight, reminding himself that they were just friends.
Draco looked at him, an eyebrow raised. “What could you possibly disappoint them with? Your excellent Auror skills? Your saving-the-world resume?’
no secrets. Harry kept a very tight hold on one secret, the one that he knew had the potential to ruin their friendship: the flame he’d carried for the other man for the past few years. For Harry, their friendship bloomed right past affable into love. He loved Draco with all his heart.
“Yep.” His smile turned bittersweet. As much as he wouldn’t miss the job, he’d really miss working alongside Mel.
They set to work, conjuring overstuffed sofas and warm blankets. Mel swished her wand to push some of the sofas back before making a large plush rug and then levitating the sofas back over the area. It still didn’t feel like enough, but it would have to do. Harry found Adrastos feeding the mooncalves and asked him to let the other house-elves know they could wait in the more comfortable area until help arrived. Then he asked Edwards to relay the same message. A few house-elves braved leaving their cage, and, eventually, the werewolf family joined them, wrapping their children up in the warm knitted blankets.
The feather stills and Harry feels himself relax ever so slightly as his orgasm courses through him. Then he hears Draco say, “That was one.”
“How could you not after this?” Draco asked incredulously, his eyes wide. “You almost died, and it seems like that’s not an uncommon occurrence, which is pretty fucking disturbing, actually.”
“So little left,” Draco says as he wipes the small dribble of come onto the bronze skin of Harry’s abdomen. “I don’t think there will be any left on the next one.”
Harry still couldn’t wrap his head around Higgins and Perry being so deeply involved. He saw those two daily. He sparred with them, went to the pub with them… How could he have not seen it? “So, Higgins and Perry were the ones that actually killed him with the Markupo?”
“So, anyway,” she continued. “It just kept going from there. I’m sure we’ll learn more as the interrogations continue. Weasley wants you and Mel to meet him back at the Ministry, by the way.”
“Harry, hand me that bottle. No, the bay leaves.” Draco sighed and leaned over where Harry was chopping potatoes to grab the right bottle after Harry had made a move for the marjoram.
Draco followed the curve inward, keeping Harry’s leg high on his shoulder with a strong arm. Harry felt Draco’s breath ghost over his skin as he made his way closer and closer to his cock. When Harry felt Draco shift, he tensed, ready, and then startled when, instead of his cock, Draco licked a stripe up Harry’s bollocks. He cried out a desperate sound.
“You’re not just—wait—” She leant forward. “Is it official? Are you dating? Do you have a boyfriend?”
“I got my inventory done, not that it’s not going to need to be redone after tonight,” Draco replied with a soft laugh. As if on cue, Seamus yelled something out across the room, holding up his pint as some of the stout sloshed over the edge.
Malfoy seemed to let it go and sat at the next table over, plopping a stack of parchment down in front of him and pulling out a pen, a smirk playing at his face.
“Yeah, also known as the Othala rune,” Mel said, frowning as she traced her finger along the cover of one of the leather-bound journals. “It has a real sordid history, even in the Muggle world. I can’t believe I didn’t notice it… it’s almost like…”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Don’t ask. These nouveau-hipster restaurants have the worst names. I’m pretty sure most of them just put an ‘and’ between two completely unrelated words, but the sandwiches really are good.”
Draco was walking down the steps, taking slow steps in tall heels, his long pale legs clad in fishnet stockings flexing from the movements. Above the stockings, a short black skirt with an abundance of white ruffles peeking out bounced with every step. And just above the skirt, a black corseted top hugged his stomach and came to a rest just above his nipples. A French Maid costume, Harry’s barely-functioning brain supplied. Fuck.
Harry flushed. It wasn’t common knowledge that he was let go from the position. The coach and owner had decided it was best for both the team and Harry if it looked like he’d resigned.
Draco shifts and then the tingle of a cleaning spell rushes over Harry and a slick finger presses at his entrance. Harry drops his head back, breaking the kiss, as Draco teases the nerve endings, running his fingers in circles over Harry’s sensitive rim.
“Yes, sir.” And Harry had to admit it was. For all that he was resistant to admitting when he couldn’t do something, he could relax now. Draco was in charge, and Harry didn’t have to fight his body’s instincts anymore.
After a moment, Harry shakily sat up and looked up at his house, at the empty space where the door had been. He couldn’t see past the hallway. The coat rack was nowhere to be seen, and he had no idea how much damage the house had taken. Shit, he had no idea what spell had even been used or if it would be safe to enter his house.
She nodded, pressing her lips together, clearly holding herself back from asking more questions. Next to her, Ron was nearly twitching with the effort of not asking his own questions.
Harry looked up to see a blurry outline of a fully dressed Draco walking into his bedroom. After grabbing his glasses, Harry pulled himself up to a seated position, leaning back against the headboard.
“Okay, so someone would need to have brought a live Markupo from the Philippines into wizarding England and into Malfoy Manor for this to have been the cause of death?” Harry asked, understanding why Auror Hardy seemed hesitant to even bring this up as a possibility. On the other hand, he was glad she did. They needed to learn early in their careers not to dismiss leads out of hand, that was how stuff got overlooked.
Harry couldn’t remember if he’d ever been held like this—someone enveloping him in their arms, their warmth cocooning him. He must have had something like it at some point—with his parents when he was a baby. But there was no clear memory of it. The feeling of safety he felt at the present moment was overwhelming.
why you called from a different number. Someone is actually trying to kill you—it’s not that you were in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
Harry looked up to see Ginny walking towards him, hair pulled up in a messy bun, looking like she’d just dragged herself out of bed.
As soon as he closed the door, to Harry’s gratitude, Ron raised the wards again. Harry didn’t think he could manage it again; he was already slumped in his chair, his strength failing him.
As much as Harry wanted nothing more than to go crawl into a bed after that morning, guilt bubbled up at the thought of leaving the work for everyone else. Harry knew Ron was just trying to look out for him, but he couldn’t help bristling at him coddling him. He wasn’t injured or incapable of doing his job.
“It’s okay, you don’t have to tell me.” Harry put a hand on his cheek, keeping his head from wandering back to the mirror. “I’m just so happy I get to do this.” He leaned in, brushing his lips against Draco’s, letting himself get lost in the sensations.
As his mind tried to make sense of it; he saw the scars—on their arms, on a few faces—and he knew. Werewolves. He pushed back the despair that threatened to overwhelm him and quickly opened the door, crouching down and putting his wand in his robes. He showed them his hands.
Harry let out a shaky exhale. Last one. It was likely lower; he should play it safe. But then, there was the siren call of more strokes. What if it
Once they finished comparing notes on the interview and agreeing on the next steps, it was already the end of the day. It was also Wednesday, so Harry wondered if he should continue his new tradition and head to Draco’s pub. It was usually slow on Wednesdays, plus he could grab dinner at the same time. Decision made quickly, he ditched his Auror robes and headed out.
She pressed her lips together, as if fighting back a large smile. “I think that will be very good for you.”
Once he was in the attic, he stretched—knowing he might be waiting for a bit—before getting into position. This time, the waiting was harder. Neither the softness of the plush rug nor the warm firelight of the wall sconces helped him relax. The anticipation just wouldn’t abate, and his caged cock quickly became the focus of his whole consciousness. Nothing had changed. It was the same cage he’d been wearing all week—every day and every night. But kneeling in the middle of the room, ready and on display with his knees spread, with his balls and caged cock hanging freely, he felt the full weight of the chastity.
“Get undressed,” Draco said, voice steady. Whatever hesitation had been there—either from disbelief that Harry would actually play along for once, or the sheer insanity of it all—seemed to be now gone.
“Oh my god. That’s the most hipster reply I’ve ever heard. Were you one of the originals?” Harry laughed.
“Heya, Harry,” Neville said as he pulled out the chair next to him and took a seat. His hands were full of a few books and a biscuit tin. “How was your first day?”
“Erm—well, not very likely. They are Class 5 magical creatures and highly restricted. They are under careful watch and protection in the Philippines. Both their Magical Senate and local governments have layers of restrictions over any Markupos under their jurisdiction, for the protection of the wizarding community and the Markupos alike.”
“Yeah, just need to check in with Ron.” Harry started typing out a vague response so that Ron knew he was still okay.
Harry looked around the room for something to temporarily take his mind off it and saw his phone on his bedside table. Ron or Hermione likely had brought it because Harry never carried it out into the field, and he’d left it on his desk at work.
Harry laughed. He put his hands down on the cold bench and leaned back slightly, attention back on the pond again. Watching the wildlife, a squirrel on the far end climbing a nearby tree, the ducks still swimming in circles. It was peaceful, something he never thought he’d associate with any part of Malfoy Manor. He was surprised at how light he felt, how relieved. Instead of the dread he’d felt when he’d gone to that Muggle bar all those years ago, he felt freer. That itchy feeling under his skin felt dispersed, smaller, no longer right there waiting to come out. Instead, he felt calm, like he could sit and watch the ducks for hours. Unfortunately, he had come here for work and not to lounge around with Draco, as much as he’d have preferred the latter. He knew he had to get back to work.
Harry scrubbed his hands over his face, pushing his glasses up on his forehead and letting out a long sigh before pulling himself together. He could deal with all his whirling feelings about this later, right now there were cages of magical creatures that needed to be taken care of. And hopefully, Ron and the team would get every last bastard responsible for this.
“Harry, that was fucking perfect.” Draco shoved an arm under his own head, propping it up slightly. “That was so fucking hot. You are so fucking hot and, god—the sounds you make…” Draco closed his eyes for a moment.
Harry smiled, imagining a young Draco feeling so loved by his mother’s small trinkets. Regardless of his feelings about Draco’s family, he knew Narcissa had loved her son very much. The war had proven that at the least.
Malfoy huffed a laugh. “Well, it will be frustrating and difficult, but I don’t see why that should scare you, of all people, off. It just takes some hard work.”
When dinner finished up, Harry helped clear the plates and found himself in the kitchen with Molly on washing up duty, his guest status having long expired.
Harry watched as he walked back to the group that was still standing and they reached out for a Portkey, disappearing from sight.
“A Fennec fox,” Ron replied with a relieved sigh and small smile, likely remembering Hermione spending the better part of the afternoon talking Harry out of it.
“Well, you know, I've been getting a bit bored just training all the new recruits these last few years.” Savage thumped Harry on the back. “So I hear we’ve got a conspiracy on our hands. This’ll be fun—it’s been a while since I’ve stormed the Ministry.”
“Oh god—” Draco tilted his head back, giving Harry more access before turning back towards the mirror. “
“Like this?” Harry held up a nearby beer mat with the pub’s name, Stone & Hops, printed across its width.
“We will, sir,” Mel said as she moved to the next cage, conjuring a large bowl and filling it with water before levitating it into the cage where a sphinx stood still, clearly listening to their conversation.
“Ron actually offered me a trainer position with the MLE. I told him I’d take the weekend to decide.”
While those muscles generally need to be massaged as well, particularly when Harry’s been training a lot—even as just a coach, hours on a broom will work the glutes fairly hard—this is the point in the massage where Draco loves to change tactics. He massages the firm muscles of Harry’s arse before leaning down and spreading his cheeks wide. Draco watches as Harry’s furrowed hole contracts and then loosens in anticipation.
At least the weather was nice for the moment. The lessons were apt to get more uncomfortable as the school year went on. He considered, not for the first time, that he’d never actually finished his flying lessons as he’d been quickly put on the Quidditch team. There was something slightly unnerving about teaching a class he’d never actually attended, having no reference for how the class should go. And, frankly, that first class had been a bit of a disaster, even if it had ended with him playing Seeker. He recalled the way chasing Neville’s Remembrall had felt, the sheer rush of it all. Very few moments in his life had compared to the rush he’d got from flying that day. He smiled as he remembered the wind in his hair, the feeling of elation when he’d caught it, the look on Malfoy’s face. He chuckled to himself. That had made the moment just a little bit better.
Draco didn’t speak and just stood with him until Harry could hardly stand it. He didn’t know if he wanted Draco to leave and go back to his friends or stay there and make Harry feel less alone. But as his eyes flicked up to Draco’s face, he knew what he really wanted to do— Draco’s features were relaxed and handsome. God, when did he get so lovely? Harry knew he should stop staring but he couldn’t quite manage it.
“Disappearing, yeah, they do that.” Hagrid sighed. “Ah well, I’m sure it’ll turn up eventually. See yeh at dinner!”
Draco shrugged. “You always seem careful with it around me, like you aren’t sure what to say. I thought maybe it bothered you… two different worlds and all that.”
Harry sat down on his chair and stared at the far wall. He’d expected the dread to start to lift by then. The initial shock of the case was past. And while he’d had some nightmares, waking up to Draco holding him and whispering soothing things in his ear, Harry no longer felt like he was about to come apart at the seams. But as that feeling had faded over the past couple of days, he was left with a general sense of wariness that seemed to permeate every fibre of his being.
“I know, but it’s enough for now. The spell, the magic, curse, whatever that was didn’t touch me. My shield held,” Harry explained. “Well, that and the door seemed to protect me.” He nodded to the door laying in the middle of the pavement next to him.
“Just rest, for now. Hopefully, we’ll be back to work by next Monday.” Harry lifted himself out of his chair carefully and dropped the privacy wards.
Harry didn’t wait for Ron to finish his orders. As a numbness spread over his body, Harry walked to the other side of the room towards the cages. He fought back the panic building in his chest as he approached one of the larger cages and crouched down.
“And after you brought me to this”—Draco leant forward and lowered his voice—“god-awful pub that you love so much—”
The last scene in Chapter 15 shows magical creatures, including house-elves and human-form werewolves, in captivity. While there will be no graphic violence (only a fight scene between the Auror team and criminals), the concept and imagery of the captivity may be disturbing. This scene/location will continue into the first scene of Chapter 16. (The scene in Chapter 16 will have Harry and Mel taking care of them).
“Maybe,” Ron replied. “They were getting sloppy though. Think about how many people went missing in the last few weeks. Apparently, Lucius got greedy and had demanded a position on the Wizengamot, saying that he’d sell them all out. Then Abnor joined in, making all sorts of demands. So, Robards had Higgins and Perry take care of them. They were apparently doing the majority of the dirty work.” Anger seemed to radiate off Ron as he said it, and Harry understood the feeling well. While he hadn’t been particularly close to them compared to Mel or some of the other Aurors, he’d worked alongside them for many years. He’d trusted them to have his back.
“Indeed. I’m going to have to rethink this.” He nodded towards Harry’s phone. “So it’s just the case? It’s a normal phone otherwise?”
Harry had made his excuses to not keep up their normal text conversation on Sunday, stating he had work to do, as he laid around his house moping. But before going to bed, Harry sent off a message about the tv show he was watching as a sort of olive branch. As embarrassed as he was, he knew that Draco had been nothing but polite about the whole thing, even making sure he got home safely.
“Sure, okay.” Bradbourn crouched down and started going through the supplies, and Harry watched his shoulders release as he focused on the task.
“Ah, well, you know how word gets around. Plus, Professor Malfoy may have asked a student or three if they couldn’t manage to pay attention in class because they had a head injury from flying lessons.” She bit her lip, and Harry could tell she was trying not to laugh.
“My husband wanted to remove him after Draco left, but I wouldn’t let him. I kept hoping…” She trailed off. “You can’t possibly think he would kill his own father.”
“Well, I’m glad you have somewhat decent taste then. I’m quite sure that menu hasn’t been updated since the 1950s. What kind of establishment serves stewed prunes and figs? I mean, really,” Draco said, looking mildly horrified.
“Of course. Do you think you can let me know by next week? We’re about to have a few new Auror positions open up as well.” Ron gave him a knowing look. Including Robards, they’d lost three Aurors that week to arrests—not something the department was going to recover from overnight, no matter how good Ron’s leadership skills.
He grabbed a protein bar from Mel’s desk drawer and forced it down as his stomach protested. Then, putting on what he hoped was a convincingly neutral face, he opened his door and strode out, running straight into Hermione.
Draco cried out when, without warning, Harry wrapped his hand around Draco’s cock, giving it several firm tugs. Then, Harry stopped, loosening his grasp and running a finger along Draco’s length.
“It’s connected to my father’s study. I don’t know if I’ll have access, but with the property falling into my possession, I would think it should open to me now. Before I couldn't even tell you about its existence, so it bodes well that I can talk about it with you now. Would you like to see it?” His jaw was still set, but Harry saw his lips quirk up just a bit at the idea.
Minutes ticked by as Draco held the position. Even though he really just needed to be able to snap to the position once he heard the Floo connection, he forced himself to keep his back straight, head bowed, and let himself get lost in the pre-emptive submission. He eventually relaxed into the position, and by the time Harry finally came stumbling through the Floo, it took Draco a minute to blink back into the present.
“Great—I’ll come join you both when I’m done with the office then. Shouldn’t take long,” Draco replied. A bead of sweat was now dripping down his back at the idea of being anywhere near those stupid beasts and their stupid claws.
“I've never had this problem before, Professor. I’ve been flying since I was seven years old!” Alder crossed his arms, narrowing his dark brown eyes at Harry.
He lets his body relax as his cock is slowly and thoroughly worked once again. Harry's still soft. His body hasn’t recovered enough for him to get hard yet, but he’s also far enough past the previous orgasms that it’s no longer torture. If his cock wasn’t so sore and overworked already, it might even be nice, like a gentle massage.
“Oh yeah, sure. It’s back there, second door on the right.” Ellis pointed to the hallway. “You want something first, though? We got beer… or if you want something to smoke—” He gestured at the bong.
Ron flipped through the file. “She’s being held in the Ministry holding cells until the trial. I’ll set up an interview.”
“I’m the assistant manager,” Draco replied with a smile. Harry still couldn’t get used to the easy way the man smiled now. “I mean, I still do my fair share of bar work and pretty much everything else that needs to be done here, but I’ve been in management positions for the past few years. I started bartending shortly after I left home. Started learning while I was doing other odd jobs at clubs and bars.”
Another thrust and Harry cried out, spilling down Draco’s throat. Draco grabbed Harry’s hips, holding him tight and swallowed, milking Harry’s cock through his orgasm. He waited until Harry started whimpering before pulling off, wiping a hand across his face, and looking up to see Harry looking completely and totally wrecked. His eyes were dark, face blissed out.
Ron grimaced. “I don’t know. I’d love to say it’s fine, but I sent Hermione and the kids to the Burrow—and called in a few favours for warding the place. It’s nearly as secure as any of the Order of the Phoenix hideouts at this point. And the place is never empty, so all we can do is hope for the best. Plus, you know Hermione—she’s only become more dangerous over the years.”
Nine of clubs. “Well, aren’t you getting lucky this morning?” Draco chuckled as he gave Harry another nine tugs. He then added the cards to the growing pile on the right. Harry could only hope that his luck would hold up. A blow job was sounding awfully nice at the moment.
He stepped over some cracked plaster in the hallway, likely from the initial blast. The sitting room was a mess—furniture blasted back, part of the ceiling had caved in. Harry walked over to the mess by the fireplace and picked up several broken picture frames—his parents, the Weasleys, his friends. He flipped them over to knock the broken glass out of the frame, too exhausted to attempt a magical repair.
Ron took a deep breath, and clapped Harry on the shoulder, letting his Assistant Head Auror mask fall off for a moment. “Thanks, mate. This is—” Ron sighed and looked around. “Just, thanks.” Then, he squared his shoulders, his expression hardening. “Okay, time to go.”
“I think so,” Harry answered. “So what about you? I assume you had a meeting in Diagon Alley if you wanted to meet back here, given your strong opinions about this place.”
Where he’d expected to see crates for transit, illegal potions or artefacts, there were cages. Some were small, but many were as large as a room. Numerous cages filled with living, breathing beings—magical creatures and beings of all shapes and sizes.
She picked up a page and looked at it, eyes narrowing. “It’s like there’s a very subtle Notice-Me-Not. I didn’t notice these at all, not until you pointed it out.”
“I know,” Harry said, pulling Draco in for another kiss to reassure him. “It’s not always like this, though. This was a particularly bad case.” He wasn’t sure if he was trying to convince Draco or himself. Yesterday and last night were still so close, so raw. He remembered clearly what he’d told Draco about not being sure he could do this anymore. But in the morning light, after some sleep, the doubt started creeping in again—that he’d be letting people down, that this was his calling… that this was the only way he could be useful.
Draco let go of Harry’s hand and started folding the edge of his napkin back and forth. “They know it’s me, though?”
“Like I’ve been hit by the Knight Bus,” he answered with a small smile. While he had a generally contentious relationship with most Healers, primarily due to his inability to stick to their directions after he’d been released, he always liked Healer Roth. She didn’t take any of his bullshit, for one, so he always knew where he stood with her.
Harry reached in and pulled out a still-warm wax-paper-wrapped packet. “Thanks,” he replied with a small smile, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the gesture.
Ron nodded and handed Mel back the photo of the middle-aged man looking around suspiciously, as if he knew he was being watched.
Harry sat up quickly, heart pounding. “What? What’s wrong?” He fumbled for his wand in the dark room, quickly casting a Lumos.
“It was as good as could be expected under the circumstances,” Andromeda replied with a sigh. “Moira’s recovering, though. And it was nice to see her again.”
He really hoped it was more to do with it being the very first flying lesson for first-years and not a sign of things to come for the school year. While his second lesson of the day at least hadn’t ended with any trips to the infirmary, it hadn’t exactly gone smoothly either.
Harry grunted at the jarring motion of someone shaking his shoulder and blinked awake. Draco’s face came into view, leaning over him.
Draco smiled patronizingly at the man, and after a beat, Justin cleared his throat. “Okay, well, I’ll see you then.” He nodded to Harry with a tight smile and headed to the bar.
Harry refrains from rolling his eyes as if he’d forget their simple stoplight system after all this time, but he knows Draco is only being cautious. “Green is good, yellow, pause and check-in, red for stop.”
“Sir, we can’t find him anywhere. He didn’t show up for work today and his roommates haven’t seen him for two days.” The young Junior Auror looked nearly frantic.
“Because I’m not doing anything untrustworthy,” Neville said, his voice laced with frustration as he pulled out his wand.
Draco let Harry pull him closer and nuzzled into Harry’s neck, breathing deeply. He let himself be soothed by the woodsy smell of Harry’s soap and his aftershave as he drifted off to sleep with the singular feeling of just how loved he was.
“Are you sure, though? I know you haven’t dated much, and how hard it is with you being in the public eye,” Molly continued.
in fifteen years, I want to hear what’s going on in the wizarding world, Potter.” Draco smiled widely as he popped a crisp in his mouth, eyes full of mirth. “I can’t possibly let this opportunity to get all the good gossip pass me by.”
Harry finished up his casting and let Mel take the lead on the rest of the spell work while he went over to Narcissa.
No amount of fire-lit sconces ever seemed to really light up these dungeon rooms, and Harry was becoming increasingly convinced that there was a spell at work to ensure they stayed ominous. Draco had scoffed at that idea and then suggested that Harry was just too coddled in his room near the Gryffindor tower.
Harry traced the ropes all the way to his knees and then back up again. If Draco could have writhed from the sensation, he would have, but his limbs were locked in place, unable to react physically to the teasing touch. He was only able to stretch and twist his torso, and even then the movement was restricted. He panted as Harry dragged a finger along the side of his thigh, up around his hip. The panting breaths became moans as Harry dragged a finger along Draco’s abdomen, then moved upward to his ribcage.
Draco continues to work it in slowly, playing with Harry along the way, dragging his finger around the sensitive nerve endings of the furrowed ring, occasionally moving back to his cock to give it a few strokes even though it’s still soft from his last orgasm.
Harry didn’t know how to answer, all he knew was that he wanted to pull him close, inhale the cologne he’d only caught slight whiffs of throughout the night. Draco didn’t look away, and Harry wondered if he could be brave enough. Summoning up what drunken courage he could, Harry shifted closer.
He doesn’t move right away, and Harry has to use all of his self-restraint not to buck up into Draco’s mouth. That is definitely not allowed. So, he balls up his hands, fingernails digging into his palms and lets out a jagged breath. His entire body is taut in anticipation. But then Draco swirls his tongue, and Harry can’t stop his hips from thrusting.
Draco continued to tease him until Harry was babbling nonsense, whimpering between gasps of air. Then he lowered his head down, taking Harry as deep as he could go, relaxing his throat and pushing well past the point of comfort. He swallowed around Harry.
Harry lifts his head to see Draco accioing something from the table. A feather, he registers as it gets closer. Oh, fuck. His arms automatically tighten in the restraints, but it’s no use. He’s not going anywhere.
Draco snorted. “Not as such, no. Shall we just dig in? See if we can figure out how it’s organised?”
As he pondered what that transition might have looked like, Draco wandered back over and leaned up against the interior of the bar just to the side of Harry.
“I heard some students were injured?” Sybill Trelawney asked as she joined their table. She looked at Harry, blinking her magnified eyes behind her glasses a few times. “Of course, the fates have informed me there would be a grave accident on the very first day.” She nodded solemnly.
The next card was flipped. Nine. Harry felt a bead of sweat drip down the side of his neck as Draco wrapped his fingers back around Harry’s cock, which had flagged from the pain. Ten perfunctory strokes later, though, and he was filling out quickly.
A few minutes later, Draco came back up the stairs, skilfully balancing a tray on a single palm with two steaming mugs, cream, and sugar bowls.
He opened up the pantry door and to his relief, the yoghurt was there, just as it had been the previous two days at lunchtime. He grabbed it with his one hand, pulling out his wand with his other, and then cast a series of tracking charms on it. At least Auror training had been good for something, even if he’d dropped out after only six months. He flushed slightly at the thought that his life had come to this: using Auror-grade tracking spells on a jar of elf-made yoghurt. Even knowing how ridiculous it was, he couldn’t let it go. He could feel that all-too-familiar prickly sensation building under his skin whenever he got borderline obsessed. It didn’t happen often, but when it did, he couldn’t let things go. So, he knew he was in this to the end. He would catch Malfoy in the act this time.
The week might have started off rough, but this moment was perfect. It was all the sweeter for all the struggles they’d gone through for the past five days, with Harry and Draco learning how to be responsible caretakers and Teddy learning that they weren’t only there for his every whim. Harry knew he’d still spoil his godson in the future; he just couldn’t help it. But he also hoped that going forward, he’d be able to provide Teddy with some structure, to be an adult that he could learn to look up to. He also really hoped that Andromeda would trust them with Teddy again for longer stays. This week had been special.
. Not fixed—nowhere near healed—but they’d both started the journey that night. And over the next few years and many many trips to the pub, they worked through their shit—with each other, from the war, and after much trust was built on both sides, even from their respective childhoods.
“Looks like we’ll have to reschedule this for another day,” Harry said to Higgins and Perry, before turning back to Mel. “Okay, let’s get cleaned up and talk to some of his co-workers.”
“Okay,” Harry said. He still didn’t really understand the mechanics of the potion, but Malfoy insisted he’d thoroughly coated both items with a thin layer of the potion that would work on contact. “So… are we just supposed to look at every person’s hands in the castle?”
As they neared the door, Mel snorted a laugh, looking at the flag and the posters. “Glad you didn’t take that bet?” she asked.
Draco huffs a laugh and moves over to Harry, bracketing his hands on either side of Harry’s hips. He leans forward, his breath ghosting across Harry’s lips. “Is that so?”
“Any of the sandwiches. The soup’s good too, but the sandwiches are excellent. They rotate through different types of bread each week.”
Harry leaned up against the wall next to the doorjamb in the study. They’d been at it for hours. It was unreal the number of files that were in there. Slowing them down even further, Ron had insisted they bring a curse breaker and check everything before it was carted out to the Ministry. They’d got out the files and stacks of parchment first. Harry had used some of the time following around the magical forensics team and having them show him one of the simpler spells for dating the parchment, knowing they had a lot of evidence to go through and not wanting to wait on the lab before they could get started.
The night was still young, and the crowds continued to move, groups dissolving and reforming while the drinks flowed freely.
“You need someone to come home to, Harry. Someone to give you a reason not to work yourself to death. I know you’ve always wanted a family.”
“I’m fine,” Harry said. He just needed to get outside. The room was spinning, and he felt like he was going to be sick.
, just smiled at Draco, completely oblivious to any tension between the other two men. As the crowds shifted, a few of Harry’s colleagues from the Auror department joined them for a bit to Draco’s relief. He didn’t appreciate the narrowed eyes in his direction as the members of the Auror department were less than keen on Draco’s acceptance into society. But at least none of them had aspirations for getting into Harry’s pants.
“Nothing. Sorry to bother you, Neville, just a mistake,” Harry said, grabbing a hold of Malfoy’s arm and pulling him back out of the greenhouse.
After a few minutes of stillness, Harry lets his mind relax. His thoughts wander as he settles in, Draco's cock heavy on his tongue. There’s something about these types of acts of service that fill Harry with a sense of peace he rarely has in life. Some weeks it feels like these scenes, particularly the ones on Saturdays like this when Draco has to work from home, are the only thing keeping him from falling apart. And Harry has a sneaking suspicion that when he’s had a particularly rough week as Assistant Head Auror that Draco isn’t being entirely honest about his current workload. He’s pretty sure that Draco is finding work to do—stuff that could easily wait for the workweek—to give Harry this. And Harry’s grateful for it.
“For Merlin’s sake. I hope you appreciate this, Potter.” Draco grabbed a handful of the stuffing with one hand and held the turkey with the other. As he got to the opening and started to shove his hand in, he closed his eyes tight and made a high pitched sound of disgust.
Harry didn’t want to talk, didn’t want to tell Draco exactly how afraid he was of all the hundred different ways tomorrow could go wrong. He wanted to tell Draco that everything was going to be okay—that they could stay in Draco’s tiny little room and hide there from all the terrible things in the world. That Harry wasn’t going anywhere.
“So, you two wouldn’t happen to know how my plant wound up in the pantry, would you?” Neville asked, looking back and forth between Harry and Malfoy. The plant continued to spit smoke in Harry and Malfoy’s general direction, too far away to have any impact.
Draco chuckles. Harry knows he loves when he gets like this, when Draco so thoroughly takes him apart, reveals this part of himself that Harry keeps so well hidden—when the hardened Assistant Head Auror is nowhere to be found and it’s just Harry, in his barest form.
“All in good time,” Harry said with a quiet laugh. Draco looked down as Harry placed his thumb and just the pads of his first two fingers around the tip of Draco’s cock. Slowly moving them up and down, not nearly enough for Draco to come but plenty enough to keep him right on the edge.
Draco grabbed a pillow and covered his face, muffling his reply. “I was drunk, there was a bet, there was a shady tattoo parlour at three in the morning. We don’t talk about that tattoo.”
“Can you come for me, Harry?” He hears Draco through the fog. “Can you come one more time? Just for me?”
Draco stretched out on the bed before swinging his legs over the side. “Well, I’m not staying in your crime scene of a home while you’re gone, so why don’t you apparate me near my flat?”
Even though he knew Draco wasn’t interested, sometimes Harry still wondered what it would be like to have more with the man. What would it be like to come home to him? To have lazy mornings and breakfast together. He knew that none of it would happen, but it was hard not to think about. Harry wondered if maybe he was projecting his inexperience onto his growing attraction. After all, Draco was safe. He knew Harry was gay, he had been patient with him and non-judgmental. It was much scarier to imagine going out in the world and finding a stranger to date. He wasn’t even sure he was ready for that.
Draco switched off the light and crawled into bed. The bed dipped, and Harry scooted back, trying to give him enough space. Dim light filled the room through the curtains, and Harry could just make out the other man’s features. Harry forced himself to close his eyes, even though he suddenly felt wide awake, the tension in the air too thick to ignore. Draco was too quiet, too still.
. He only kept people around that were useful,” he said, his lip curling in distaste. “I suppose Severus was probably the only person that came close to being a friend. Otherwise, his allegiances were always to whoever had the most power, whoever he could get the most out of.”
They both collectively held their breath as the dome disappeared, barely visible behind Malfoy’s other food. The plant puffed out another plume of smoke, but it dissipated within a couple of feet of the pantry.
Draco looks over to see James pulling a face at his parents showing any sort of physical attention to each other.
“Yeah, I can understand that,” Harry replied. “I hate to leave like this but I actually have to go.”
Malfoy leaned forward to press his face against the crack, peering out. The movement only served to push his side against Harry, who barely held back a whimper. He could feel his body starting to react and tried desperately to think of anything except the hard press of Malfoy’s hip on his. That only led to him imagining what that hip might look like, sharp and unforgiving, curving just so towards—
Harry stopped and waited impatiently for the man to finish his thought, ready for the insult that was sure to come.
Draco feels a flush spread across his chest, wanting nothing more than to take Harry apart slowly. There’s no way they have time for that, though, so he drops another kiss on Harry’s lips and pulls back, before pushing back in, starting a comfortable pace.
Draco feels a flush creep over his skin and holds back a moan at the thought. Fortunately, they aren’t too far from the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.
“Unless you think there’s something embarrassing in there, in which case I absolutely insist you open them all immediately,” Draco said, eyes lighting up.
Draco shifts slightly and Harry inches forward, sitting back on his heels and letting himself relax into the plush rug under his shins. He makes sure to keep his arms behind his back, even though Draco likely wouldn’t know if he moved. That’s not the point. Harry wants to submit, wants to do his boyfriend’s bidding.
Once everyone was too full and the conversation had wound down, Harry and Draco insisted on cleaning up. Andromeda gave them both a kiss on the cheek and sat at the table as Teddy brought in his new gifts, showing them to her one at a time. As the kitchen began to resemble its usual sparkling self and the night came to its natural end, Harry felt a tug in his chest, wishing he could bottle up this moment. He doubted that even a pensive memory would replicate it.
“Fuck. Okay, fine, you stubborn bastard,” Ron replied, standing up and putting out a hand for Harry. “Get a new phone while you are at it. Text me as Maria about babysitting next week, and I’ll know it’s you and that you’re alright, okay?”
“Oh, I don’t know, Potter,” Draco said with a smirk that looked out of place to Harry on his own face as he leaned back in his chair. “It might not be all bad.”
“Well, well… that’s quite the luck to end on,” Draco said with a smile in his voice, as he slipped his hand back around Harry’s cock. Like last time, he went slow, taking his time to really work Harry over.
She disappears from the flames and a moment later, Scorpius comes through, clad in his dragon pyjamas and slippers, eyes puffy. Albus stumbles out a moment later, clutching a worn blanket. Both of them look exhausted.
“Oh yes,” Harry replied. “I’ll definitely get out there at some point. I’ve just been so busy with work.”
Two shops, several bags of clothes, and a much lighter wallet later, they apparated into the sitting room of Grimmauld Place. He immediately dropped the bags and fell on the sofa, feeling like he’d had all day Auror training. How she was still full of energy was beyond him, although she only tried on maybe a tenth of what he had throughout the day, even if she’d spent an exorbitant amount of time trying on leather boots.
“This should keep your hips down,” Draco says before wrapping his other hand back around Harry’s cock and leaning back in to take him in his mouth again.
“Erm—Ginny insisted that I buy some new clothes,” he explained, feeling uncomfortably aware of the tightness of the whole outfit. “And vanished most of my old wardrobe, actually.”
“I’m taking off,” Mel said as she came around the doorway into the study. “We going to get started on this immediately?”
Draco raises an eyebrow. “They agreed to take all three boys on top of their own two terrors for the night?”
Time drags by slowly with Harry in an uncomfortable state of arousal. The only sounds in the room are the soft breaths coming out of his nose that echo around the cramped space under the desk and the sound of Draco’s quill scratching the parchment above. The rough lace of his knickers pulls against his hardening cock as he tries to remain still.
The second-floor damage seemed limited to the stairwell and a minor amount in the hallway—some splintered wood and more cracked plaster. Harry pushed open his bedroom, sighing in relief at the sight of his unharmed bed. He carefully set the picture frames on his chest of drawers to be fixed later and pulled off his Auror uniform, tossing it on the floor where he stood.
“I think most of them haven’t updated their decor since the 17th century.” Harry nodded to the bartender across the room and signalled for a drink. He came there often enough with Mel after work, and with Ron and Hermione when they could get a sitter, that the bartender knew his usual.
Harry looks up at him with heated eyes as Draco rolls over on top of him, pulling one of Harry’s legs up as he settles between his legs. Harry places his hands on either side of Draco’s face, pulling him in for a kiss as Draco lines himself up, his cock pressing against Harry’s entrance.
“Then,” Draco said, running his mouth along the edge of Harry’s hip bone, “there are the hips—sensitive for many people, just a hair’s breadth from where you really want to be touched.”
Mel said it several times with Harry repeating it carefully, and then they went to work. Ledgers about wine cellars became accounting ledgers with names and payments; letters about restaurant food service became letters about shipments and blackmail. There were names, dates, locations—everything. Harry felt his skin prickle as he uncovered more names—more Ministry workers, more members of pure-blood society.
Draco must get the sense it’s not going down smoothly because a moment later, he’s got his wand out, conjuring a glass and filling it with water before pressing it into Harry’s hand. Harry takes a long drink to clear the syrupy potion from his throat before saying his thanks.
“Oh, well. I’m sure I can stop by for a bit.” Harry looked at Draco, concern in his face, and Draco sighed, knowing it was a lost cause.
Draco narrowed his eyes briefly in Justin’s direction. “Harry, I’d really feel better if you stayed with me.”
When Harry couldn’t take it anymore, his cock throbbing with the need to sink into his boyfriend, he leaned back on his haunches. Reminding Draco not to move, he finished unzipping his jeans, breathing a sigh of relief as he pulled out his aching cock, shoving his boxers just low enough to stay out of the way.
As they neared the door, Harry slowed down and allowed Mel to move to the other side of it, in position. He cast a strong Silencing Charm at the door; he’d only made that mistake once in the field, when a squeaky door gave away his position.
“But did they have the computer things back then? That’s the question!” Ron exclaimed, a smug smile on his face.
Harry had made sure to put on some of his less atrocious clothes under his robes for the day, knowing he still had a lunch to go to. A lunch he was both dreading and looking forward to.
Harry kept his gaze lowered as he watched Draco out of the corner of his eye as he circled around Harry kneeling on the plush carpet in their playroom. The torches gave off a warm, low light, only just illuminating the underground room enough for Harry to see. After pacing around Harry just long enough for the anticipation to build, Draco walked to their leather bench, set up several paces in front of Harry with a small table in front of it. Draco sat in front of the table and then scooted back slightly, widening his legs.
“You did good today, Hardy,” he said. Both of the younger Aurors had, really. Harry felt his chest warm with pride. As a small subset of Magical Law Enforcement, they didn’t have a constant new influx of recruits like the regular MLE officers did. And it took years for new Aurors to really get enough experience to be decent at the job, so that moment when a Junior Auror was really finally ready was always something special.
Unfortunately, the slight reprieve Harry got from chatting with Draco and his nap didn’t last. By the time his lunch had arrived, his stomach was twisted up, and he could barely eat. He forced a few things down just to appease the nurse and then threw on a dressing gown that one of his friends must have left on the chair—sadly his trips to St Mungo’s were frequent enough that they had this down to an art. The nurse had been kind enough to inform him that Mel’s room was right next door.
“Sure,” Neville said, slowly, as he peeled his well-worn dragonhide gloves off, setting them on a nearby shelf. He held both of his flesh-coloured hands up.
A moment later they both stumble out of their Floo in their sitting room, and Draco wastes no time before he’s pushing Harry back towards the sofa while divesting him of his clothes. Draco fleetingly thinks they could probably both use a tall glass of water, drunk as they are, but finds himself unable to care too much with the prospect of getting it on with his husband finally a possibility.
Harry laughed. “Well, I ordered some food this time, so you’ll be happy to know I’m making better choices. What
Harry grabbed his wand and carefully walked to the door, feeling a bit dizzy from the residual spell damage and the combination of potions he was on. He seemed to only have a good couple hours between doses where he was lucid enough to think straight, something he found incredibly disconcerting every time he wound up at St Mungo’s with spell damage. He would have thought someone could have found a way to make the potions have fewer side effects. Then again, they were always getting on his case to rest, so maybe drowsiness wasn’t a side effect that they particularly wanted to fix.
He took a long drink, finishing his pint, and looked back up at Harry as if he might have some answers.
“They said we should have the results by tomorrow.” Harry handed her one of the mugs and sat down. Without a clear starting place, they would have to cast a wide net. Normally, starting with the family led to some sort of a lead to track down, but both Narcissa and Malfoy had clean alibis. They would still need to talk to Malfoy again, but Harry didn’t expect him to be able to help given that he hadn’t been in his father’s life for 15 years.
Harry smiled and then spoke another incantation. One that made Draco’s eyes widen in surprise as he felt it wrap around his still hardening cock. One that would ensure that he couldn’t come.
Once the door was shut, Draco turned to him. “I’m sorry to barge in like this, but I just needed to know—there’s something I need to do before I lose my nerve.”
Then, Draco felt the rope wrap around his waist, just below his ribs, a tight circle locking his arms back. He looked down and watched as Harry wove the deep blue rope around his torso, slowly, methodically—creating diamond patterns across Draco’s pale torso. The loose ends continued to tease as Harry wrapped them around one another, creating twists and turns of the rope, looping it around itself to secure it in place.
He cast the secondary Auror tracking charm—the one that would link his wand to the tracked item—and waited for the blue string of light to lead him in the right direction. He finished the final movement, but nothing happened. With a frown, he tried again. He knew he was a bit rusty, but this wasn’t an overly complicated spell.
Harry rarely called, usually opting for texting. “Ron,” he said, voice shaky despite his best attempts to mask it. “I need you to come to Grimmauld Place, now. Apparate, don't floo.”
Harry groaned and ducked his head back down. Draco wasn’t wrong though. Harry wouldn’t have offered the bet if he hadn’t been willing to see it through. And he was sure Draco would figure out exactly how to make that happen.
Friday morning, Harry once again dragged himself into work. He’d spent the previous night at Draco’s flat, both of them agreeing that staying in a Dark-magic-exploded house with no front door for another night was likely not a good idea.
Malfoy snorted from the table over, and Harry narrowed his eyes at him. Malfoy was still making his way through the stack of parchments. How did the man already have papers to grade? Harry imagined him making the students write essays on the very first day of class and decided that seemed likely enough.
Higgins and Perry were both good Aurors, but they didn’t stand a chance against him and Mel. They both fought with brute force over any sort of finesse. Harry flicked his wand to send several training dummies to the far end of the room, opening up the space for a two-on-two duel, as Higgins gave Perry a hand up from the mats.
Harry shrugged. That was a loaded question, especially given the present circumstances. “I like putting the worst of wizard-kind, as you put it, away where they can’t hurt other people. Someone needs to do it.”
Harry deflated, unable to find the energy to fight any more. Besides, he really wasn’t in any sort of shape to get home on his own, no matter how much his stubborn side wanted to. And apparition was certainly out of the question. So, he walked over to a smooth stretch of the building exterior and leant up against it, too tired and drunk to keep himself upright for long.
Harry glanced up at Narcissa, sitting as still and gracefully as ever. The only indication of her emotional state was the tears escaping her eyes only to be quickly wiped away by an ornate handkerchief.
A small smile pulled at Draco’s lips before he smoothed it out, back to his unaffected self. “Fantastic. Pick me up at 7?”
A moment later, the door was pulled open, and Harry found himself in front of the tall roommate he’d questioned the first time he’d been there. So much had changed since that day that Harry found himself jarred by the memory.
“Clara, do you want to start us off?” he asked Clara, the witch from the Spell Specialists and Containment Squad.
After lunch in Diagon Alley, Ginny had dragged him to a large Muggle shopping centre, because apparently, access to multiple shops was necessary. He’d lost track of how many shops she’d dragged him to by then, and somehow, he only had one small bag of new clothes to show for it. And now that he’d finally allowed her to take him shopping, she was insistent that he get an entirely new wardrobe.
“Could this be similar, then?” Harry asked. “Could it be a key to decode the messages? How did it work?”
“It went great!” Harry said, sitting down and tossing his satchel on the empty chair next to him. “Both classes. When this morning went according to plan, I wasn’t sure I was going to be able to replicate it with my second class—especially since it’s first-year Gryffindors and Slytherin together.”
“Right.” Harry laughed. “But since no one could move on until the whole group passed the manoeuvre, that group got a bit competitive. Of course, that meant they pushed themselves a tad too hard at times, but they were focused; no one was messing around.”
“I’m telling you if the moon landing was faked that Muggles already had the technology at that time to make it look real enough,” Draco argued, barely noticing that Harry had joined them.
Sometimes Harry would sit under Draco’s desk, Draco’s cock heavy on his tongue, his mouth keeping him warm. Other times, Draco would put him on the wall, casting a spell that chained Harry in place, flogging him on his breaks from work. Once, Draco had Harry simply kneel on a pillow, naked and legs spread, for the duration—there only to be at Draco’s beck and call, even if he was never needed. Draco hadn’t touched him once, and Harry had remained rock hard for the entire afternoon.
“Okay, I’m going to go check on some other students and be back,” Harry said. “You okay to get started?”
“Completely. I was also so delusional that I was quite sure I was going to wipe the pitch with you, and then I’d not only be the hero of Slytherin Quidditch, but you’d have to admit my superiority,” Draco said with a grin.
Ron exhaled loudly and nodded. “Okay. I found an off-the-books safe house that wasn’t in use. It’s a small studio flat in a crap neighbourhood, but it’ll do the job. I’ve got Mel there now—she sent Jess to her cousin’s in Italy. And I’ve moved all the copies of the files there for now, so we can work from there. It’ll be a tight squeeze but we can get another camp bed in there for you.”
“Okay, good,” Ron said, shuffling through some papers before stopping to look at Harry. “Are you okay?”
Even amongst Harry’s close friends, everyone had changed quite a bit. They all still had their same underlying personalities and even flaws, but they were no longer their teenage selves. Ron still struggled with jumping to conclusions when he got angry or jealous, Hermione still ran to her books and research first instead of trying to talk about things, but they had grown up.
As he entered the pub, he was pleased to see it was once again fairly empty. Lila was behind the bar, and a few other patrons were scattered around the various tables. Harry pulled up a stool and smiled at her in greeting. Now that she knew he wasn’t there to cause any trouble for her friend and boss, she seemed to have warmed up to him.
Draco takes his time—tracing the rim, softly blowing on the spit-slicked skin, peppering soft kisses. Eventually, he dips his tongue in. Harry’s still calm and quiet, so Draco pushes in further. He’ll have Harry writhing beneath him soon enough, Draco thinks with a smirk.
“Well, of course you can come to us,” Molly said. “Did you think— Oh no, Harry—” Her eyes widened in understanding. She stood, her chair scraping on the floor, to come around the table and pulled Harry into a hug. “I’m so sorry if you thought we wouldn’t accept you, dear.”
“To your case? No. To my life? Apparently fucking so.” He put down that scroll and opened another one skimming it quickly, before going to the next, face contorting in anger the longer he read.
“Come here,” Harry pulled her into his office, closing the door behind them. “Hey, come here.” He pulled her into a hug, knowing there was no way she hadn’t been destroyed by the news.
As the morning progressed, his stacks of evidence shifted. Piles grew, sorted by the likelihood the items were connected to the case. After some time, Harry started putting some of the possibly connected files into piles based on subjects mentioned: departments, locations, people. Most of the letters and papers were vague—nothing explicitly called out. But every so often, something in particular was mentioned even if there was no clear explanation as to why.
So, in the end, Harry was just so damn proud of Ron. Really, he was even a little relieved. And when Ron first moved into the position, Harry had insisted on calling him by his full title at every occasion.
Harry and Mel, both disillusioned with strong Silencing Charms on their boots, carefully made it through the streets of Park Royal toward the warehouse from Lucius Malfoy’s records. It had taken nearly the whole morning to convince Robards to let them request a warrant, as he wanted them to find more corroborating evidence before they went in with a raid. Harry was pretty sure it had more to do with Robards wanting to cover his own arse if things went sideways than an actual belief that this wasn’t a good lead.
Harry felt a familiar lump in his throat growing—this time, though, not from dread or guilt, but from knowing that Ron meant it—that at the end of the day he cared more about Harry as a person. Harry cleared his throat and took a deep breath. “Thanks, Ron.”
“Okay, just take a breath,” Harry said, crouching down next to her. “It takes time to learn to fly.”
“It sounds like both of you actually managed to set some rules. Teddy didn’t seem particularly thrilled about it,” she continued, with a glint in her eye. Teddy huffed dramatically next to her. “But I’m glad to hear that my worries were unfounded.”
Draco continued to do this until Harry’s stomach was clean, only the remains of Harry’s spit from Draco’s finger glistening on his tan skin.
Harry let out a slow breath. “Draco, no. You’ve just seemed a bit… I don't know… weird about it. Particularly ever since you found out about your inheritance, and I didn’t want to push you.”
That wouldn’t have been such a problem if he wasn’t so terrified of anyone finding out. Every time he thought of the
This time, when Harry ran a finger along Draco’s torso, he simply accepted the light touch. He reacted, he shivered, but he didn’t try to do anything with it. He had no expectations, no thought about what he wanted to come next.
As worked up as he already is, it takes no time at all before Harry’s tensing up and spilling out, come shooting out in ropes across his stomach
A small aborted groan escaped Harry’s lips. While he loved everything that Draco did to him and with him, in the end, he had no doubt that his lover would make it miserable for him if he wanted. He tried to think of something that Draco would want, that Harry didn’t already give him regularly. Something he knew he really wanted… And then he thought of it. The thing Draco had asked for only once. It wasn’t a hard limit for Harry, but he’d been honest about his inner conflict with it. Harry knew that humiliation was a turn on for him, but something about this felt more vulnerable, made him feel more on display.
“Can you walk?” Harry asked. “I’ve got what’s likely a werewolf family who I need to be able to talk to.”
“Well, since you only teach a couple of hours a day, I’m assuming you can get here faster,” Malfoy said, closing the door and turning to Harry.
Every nerve ending on Harry’s body is buzzing so when Draco finally leans in, finally drags his teeth softly along Harry’s hip bone, Harry arches off the bed, crying out.
Draco hummed. “Close, it’s bindweed—they look a lot like morning glory, though—except they’re invasive weeds.”
Harry walked up the stairs in the rundown building, passing the peeling paint on the walls and flickering fluorescent lights overhead. When he reached the door, he felt magic wrap around his hand on the doorknob, tightening before releasing and admitting him.
He wondered if Malfoy might still be nearby and tugged open the flap at the top of his leather satchel to pull out his map. He’d already found himself taking it out during every break, just to see where the man was. Unfortunately, Harry hadn’t learned anything of interest, as he’d started off his day in his rooms and then spent the rest of the day in his classroom—even taking lunch there. Before Harry managed to locate it in his satchel for another look, Malfoy entered the staff room. Harry turned to look at him with narrowed eyes, wondering if he had been waiting nearby to gloat.
Harry feels his entire body break out in a flushed sweat as Draco lowers the wand, hovering so close to his skin.
Ron sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “From here out, I want to make sure you two have backup before going anywhere else. The warehouse was mostly a bust; we recorded everything we could from the magical signatures and spell residue, but if you get any more leads, we’re going in with a full team or not at all. That was far too close of a call.”
Both classes had started off well enough. It had been a nice change to have the younger students recognise his name from Quidditch, instead of his war hero status, as most of them had been too young to remember the war. While he was sure that most of the students still knew of the war, they had been so young that it didn’t quite have the same meaning, so a “former Quidditch star” seemed to hold more interest for those students. Unfortunately, whatever credibility he had as a former Seeker seemed to quickly dissipate once the lesson started.
The students’ eyes went wide, and they nodded quickly before mounting their brooms. He didn’t mind the students asking questions. As a somewhat public figure, he had expected that would happen before he took the post. Unfortunately, they seem to hone in on the exact things that he wanted to discuss the least.
Harry whimpered and kept going, the sensitivity building. As a final dribble of come leaked out of the tip of his spent cock, he finally stilled his hand. Leaving it frozen in place as he watched Draco’s orgasm build in front of him. His breathing was becoming uneven, his skin flushed, even through Harry’s darker complexion.
A cold sensation washed over Harry, his stomach plummeting. “Of course.” Dropping Draco’s wrist, he stepped back, putting some distance between them. “I shouldn’t have—I didn’t—”
After checking with a few people at the Ministry who had been seen with Astor, they’d first checked the office he kept for his “consultant business.” It was located on the edge of Knockturn Alley, several buildings down from the bustle of Diagon Alley and just around the corner onto Diurn Alley. The location was perfect because it could be seen as legitimate while still close enough to Knockturn Alley to be a comfortable place for the more disreputable folks to visit. If Harry were running an illegal business, that would be exactly where he’d put his office.
Harry glanced at Mel and saw her carefully looking at Ellis as he answered, likely using her Legilimency skills to gauge his honesty. Even if she couldn’t fully look into their minds legally, she could get a sense of general truthfulness.
Draco walked to the far wall, running his hand along the ornate panels on the wall before bending over to pull his wand out of the side of his boot, his Muggle clothes clearly not providing a better option for transport. He whispered an incantation and tapped his wand in the centre of the panel. Harry could hear that the spell took, a low creak reverberating as the wall shifted, folding away to reveal a room much larger than the study. Along with the magic hiding the room, there was clearly some magical extended space involved there.
Tonight it was just a short text about a hen party. Apparently, they were a common sight at gay bars and gay-friendly pubs alike. From what Harry gathered, they were Draco’s least favourite clientele.
“I don’t know how to make pastry dough.” Draco waved in Harry’s general direction where he was starting to put the ingredients together in a bowl.
Harry flipped him two fingers as he walked out of the room laughing, a warm feeling spreading through him.
“Well, you see, I’ve been convincing myself over the years how much better Muggle life is,” Draco said as he leaned against the bar, his body turned towards Harry. “And I’m going to be honest here, most of that was hinging on phones and the internet.”
“When I was six,” Draco continued, eyes focused on the pond. “Before I even understood any of it, I remember being invited to a party—some summer society party—one of the rare ones where children were invited. I don’t even remember whose house we were at, but I remember both of my parents talking about how they were ‘new money’ and had mixed blood on the mother’s side.
But before Harry can bask in it for long, Draco leans down and sucks him back down. Harry whimpers, screwing his eyes shut. While Draco’s mouth is much less intense than the friction of his hand, it’s still too much. He can’t—not after four orgasms, not after so many torturous post-orgasm sessions.
Harry smiled around his cock, heart leaping, and kept up the motion, occasionally trying something new and cataloguing the sounds each of them produced. Draco continued to get louder, his expression tighter, until he cried out and gently pulled on Harry’s hair—a clear sign that he was about to come, even with Harry’s inexperience.
Draco shook his head and headed down to the kitchen, hollering something about bringing him better tea and Harry having no taste, but what should Draco expect from someone who frequents the Dragon’s Lair? Harry laughed at the increasingly muffled rant until he was out of earshot.
He looked good. He was older, not a surprise given they were both now in their late 30s, but there was no question that he was ageing well. His hair was cropped short on the sides and stylishly long on top, artfully tousled. He was wearing a pair of
He didn’t know if it was the culmination of the past couple of weeks—too many near-death experiences, watching his partner get hurt, the adrenaline of the raid, and the sinking horror that came after. He knew there wasn’t time to fall apart yet, though. The Ministry was in chaos. From what Harry had heard, Ron had done an exceptional job at getting the team in quickly. They’d managed to catch Robards off-guard and everyone else came easily after that. But having so many Ministry officials arrested as a part of a big conspiracy was bound to send rippling waves through the magical community, no matter how well it was handled.
“There were several more people in the Department of Magical Creature Rights and Regulation, which…” She looked back at the cages and sighed. “…maybe shouldn’t be such a surprise with what we know now.”
Harry puts his finger to his lips as they pass by the twins' room, and Draco nods as he breaks out in a smile. When they get to their bedroom door, Harry pushes him in playfully and closes the door behind them, careful to not make any noise before throwing up a one-way silencing charm and extra strong locking charms. James likely will remain engrossed in his game for at least another hour, but Harry’d rather not take any chances.
They then turned to survey the damage just as another roar sounded out from the far side of the room. Harry and Ron met each other’s eyes before they turned to the far wall.
Harry swirled his tongue around the tip, and the edges of Draco’s vision went fuzzy. Then he pulled off, “Will you? Will you be on your best behaviour?”
“The owner of the pub owns that place too, but he can’t serve liquor alongside axe throwing, so he has to keep them as separate businesses.”
“Yes, sir.” Harry eyed the deck. They still had what looked like a quarter of the deck to go. The piles on the left and right looked about equal; Harry hadn’t been able to keep track of it at all, so he could only hope that he’d won more than he’d lost.
Harry stared, mesmerised, as he ran his hands up and down Draco’s chest, a contrast of pale skin and saturated ink.
Teddy made a snuffling sound in his sleep and pulled his teddy bear tighter. Harry felt his chest constrict. The guilt of how terribly irresponsible Draco and he had been was sitting heavy with him that morning. Watching this child that he loved with all his heart, that he was privileged enough to call his godson, basically become an absolute nightmare over the past two days was a wake-up call. It was all well and good to be the spoiling godfather, or cousin, in Draco’s case, when they only saw him once a week, at most.
“Harry,” Filius said brightly, as he took a seat at their table. Harry still struggled to use his first name as he’d been Professor Flitwick for most of Harry’s life.
Harry grabbed a sandwich, his appetite returning as the tension left his chest, and took a large bite, glad to move on from the conversation.
They’d both come to Hogwarts still broken. Harry had been offered the job after quitting the Aurors. He’d made it through two years of training, and then he made it through exactly one field mission and quit the moment it was done. Draco had just finished up his Potions apprenticeship with a recluse Potions Master in Northern Scotland who had been too focused on his work to notice the war. He’d spent all his breaks over those two years volunteering at Hogwarts, fixing anything that needed fixing. And from what Harry now knew, working himself to the bone.
Harry nodded to Scott and a few others as they walked in. And once greetings were exchanged and everyone was settled, he got everything started.
“Ultimately, you’ll have to figure out what works for you, but there are a few things you could try. Right now, do you have them paired off? Or are they just with whoever they walked in with?”
Harry followed him out, hitching his satchel higher on his shoulder and reminding himself to keep it together. The last thing he needed to do was make it weird. They walked through the castle in companionable silence, exiting the castle doors a few minutes later into the fresh air.
“Harry, stop—” Draco cut him off with a huff and a smile. “It’s fine. I just didn’t want you uncomfortable, especially since…”
“No,” Draco says firmly. He looks at Harry with unbridled lust, his grey eyes both possessive and tender.
Harry opened his eyes to see Draco turn around, head bent over the investment papers from his firm. He didn’t often work Saturdays, but when he did, he always worked from home with Harry at his service, as his entertainment, his stress relief.
Harry nodded, slowly working his way through his lunch. That wasn’t surprising at all, knowing what he had about the man and even Draco as a child.
Harry moved towards Draco to get a better look, wondering if the mirror took some sort of damage during the war. That was, after all, what they were checking all these objects for—magical damage that might prove dangerous.
,” Harry cries out as he tries desperately to tilt his hips away. It’s no use though, he’s not going anywhere—his body is strung tight, completely at Draco’s mercy.
“It was just little things at the pub, the way you’ve reacted to any flirtation or the way you would look at a gay couple being affectionate, even just holding hands.”
“So, does that mean that Herbology classes can’t grow them and use them for ingredients anymore?” Ginny asked.
Draco left biting kisses down Harry’s neck until he just above Harry’s collar, he latched his mouth to the skin and sucked, marking Harry as his and his alone. Harry moaned loudly, and threaded his fingers through Draco’s hair, holding him tight. After he was sure a bloom would form, Draco trailed another kiss upward, and latched on again, this time just below his ear, well above what would be covered by any clothing item other than a scarf and sucked hard. Harry stretched his neck, giving Draco better access.
Harry stalked through the front doors after finishing his morning maintenance work, heading straight to the staff room. This was going to end today. He might
Before he’s recovered from that, he feels the knickers being pulled down further and a slick pressure pushing against his entrance after he hears Draco murmur a lube and prep charm.
As they settle back on the seats of the taxi, Draco tries to not think too much about the unknown substance on the divider behind the driver and wraps his arm around Harry’s shoulders, pulling him close.
Harry propped his elbow on his knee and dropped his chin into his hand, the stone step behind him digging into his back. His classes that day had gone fine; not great, but fine. But his Friday classes were fifth and seventh years, so it was more akin to coaching than teaching. His lower-level classes had been only marginally less disastrous than the previous week. Aaron, the first year Ravenclaw, had managed to give himself a concussion on Monday, requiring a trip to the infirmary
Draco huffed out a few more laughs as he caught his breath, a large smile on his face. He had flour in his hair, nearly indistinguishable from his already light blond strands. Harry was sure his own looked far more ridiculous.
Draco gestured at him to stop, and Harry dropped his head back onto the cushion, his eyes drooping shut.
Mel stood and walked over to him, enveloping him in a hug. “I’m going to miss working with you so much.”
Harry carefully lowered that leg as he had the other, and Draco tried to let his muscles relax as the leg stretched downward. The pressure from the ropes, the intensity of the constriction was so much more than anything they’d ever done before.
Harry’s stomach clenched and this time he was unable to fight it back as the sick rose in his throat. He dropped to his knees, leant forward on his hands, and vomited all over the worn rug. His stomach continued to empty itself until tears formed in the corner of his eyes. Finally, after several wrenching dry heaves, Harry sat back on his heels, wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his robes. With his wand and a shaky hand, he vanished the mess and cast an air freshening charm followed by a mouth freshening one.
Draco felt a flush creep up his face. Harry wasn’t wrong though. Chastity had reduced him to submission quickly, and really, that was part of the appeal for Draco. He always struggled to let go, and while they both had a healthy sense of humour around Draco’s bratty behaviour, sometimes he wanted to just be able to submit, to not put up a fight around it. He knew he’d still be a brat, that was just too much a part of his nature, but he wanted this sometimes too.
“That was close.” Draco grabbed the other half of the cards, putting them together before knocking the side of the deck on the table to straighten them out.
“Do you want me to pound into you? Make you forget everything?” Draco runs his teeth over Harry’s shoulder as he slowly pulls out. “Forget everything except us, this.”
Harry did as instructed, his torso stretching at the movement. His body was now on full display as he sat between Draco’s legs, facing the table. His legs were pulled wide, hooked over Draco’s legs, which Draco had spread out even more once Harry was in position, causing him to strain slightly from the stretch. His cock and bollocks hung between his spread legs, vulnerable, ready for Draco to use or abuse as he wished. Harry leaned back against Draco’s chest ever so slightly, seeking contact, and Draco helped tuck him closer.
The following morning, Harry pulled his coat around himself a little tighter against the autumn breeze. The blue skies and bright sunlight were deceptive—giving the illusion of warmth while the cold wind remained cutting. At least it was a break from the grey gloom that was typical for this time of year. He decided to walk most of the way to work that morning with his Auror robes safely tucked in his brown leather satchel that he used to carry stuff to and from work.
That would have put his death just after Lucius Malfoy’s and around the time the other two wizards went missing.
Finally, Draco pulls out, casting another lubrication charm and lining himself up. Harry groans as a thick pressure pushes against his hole, stretching him open. The nerves around his hole sing and ache in protest simultaneously. The potion makes the sensation overwhelming. And while Draco has enough girth that Harry always feels the stretch, right now, his cock feels positively physically huge as Harry’s hole stretches and burns, trying to give him entry.
Harry presses the pads of fingers into Draco’s back as his breathing becomes ragged. He feels himself stretched, a burning pleasure-pain joining the thrumming arousal. The competing sensations are almost too much, and he starts pleading again. Draco continues his torturously slow slide in as Harry babbles beneath him, Draco’s own ragged breathing belying his otherwise collected composure.
Harry focuses all his energy on managing a wandless and wordless lubrication charm. It’s one of the only wandless charms he can manage, having spent embarrassingly long hours trying to perfect it while Draco and he were first dating just to impress the other man. It worked, though, as Draco nearly came in his pants at the display of raw power, and they still reap the benefit of it to this day.
Harry wished the rest of the class a good weekend and checked his watch again. There was just enough time for him to change in his office before heading to the pub. After making sure that everything was in its place in the training room, he headed to the lifts and up to his office on Level Two. During the first month of his new job, it had felt strange to keep going up to the DMLE floor every morning instead of heading towards the Auror department, turning left, and walking past the rest of the DMLE to the small hallway with equally small rooms where the trainers had their offices.
“It’s Muggle, completely private; I doubt there will be anyone there I haven’t known for years. And I’ll be there the whole time, I promise not to leave your side if that will help,” Draco said, his expression earnest. “Look—I’m not going to pressure you, just give it some thought, okay?”
Draco closes his eyes, getting lost in the feeling of Harry, tight around his cock. He pulls Harry’s hips closer, putting more weight on his knees so that he can slip a hand between them. “Lube me up?”
It seemed that the fates had predetermined that if something were to go wrong on a case, Aurors Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy must be at the scene.
“You said you still had to help Luna set up the office, right? Can you do that Saturday?” Harry asked, turning to Draco.
Harry breathed deeply, trying to fight back his need to orgasm. Every time he’d calm down, the plug would change sizes or shapes or the speed, and Harry would be right back on the edge. He quickly lost track of time, lost in the sensations, in the vibrations deep inside him, in the draft from the window that moved the air over Harry’s cock just enough to tease, in the scratching of Draco’s quill.
Her eyes widened. “Oh my god—I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to force you to talk about it. I just assumed—”
He knew he shouldn’t. But he decided to anyway. He unlocked the phone and, ignoring his unread messages, opened up his contacts. He tapped out Draco’s contact number on his new phone, saved it, and shoved the phone in his pocket.
“Draco, I—” Harry took a breath, reaching up and wrapping his hand around the back of Draco’s neck. Before he could second guess himself, he gently pulled the other man towards him and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.
Malfoy ignored the retort. “I suppose I could find a way to track them. Perhaps I’ll go down to the kitchens and do the whole lot.”
Draco nodded. “I can’t imagine any of the house-elves I grew up with accepting pay. Well, except for Dobby, but he was always an odd one.”
Harry swallows around him, milking him through his orgasm. He blinks away the tears that gather as Draco holds himself in Harrys’ throat through his orgasm.
“Yes,” Harry answered thinking of his seventh-year lessons an hour ago. Watching Milo perfect the Jones Misdirect had been amazing. The whole class had cheered Milo on. And Harry loved watching everyone else’s progress, as well.
“Well, it’s not quite full-on erotica, but it’s a bit much for a school full of hormonal teenagers.”
“Nope, I’m all caught up,” Draco replies. And before Harry can feel a little disappointed that they won’t be playing in Draco’s office for the day, Draco adds, “So I was thinking—” He pauses as he sucks gently under Harry’s ear. “—about making use of our playroom today.”
Jacob followed suit and cleanly managed the manoeuvre, bursting out in a grin when he dismounted. “How’s that?”
“Already did, as of”—Draco looked at his watch—“forty minutes ago. I purchased everything—the liquor, beer, furniture—all of it. He’s closing up before dinner today. Today’s profits are his, and then it’s all mine.”
As much as he wanted to solve this case, put all the bastards behind this in Azkaban where they couldn’t hurt anyone anymore, he was tired. He was tired of combing through endless amounts of evidence; he was tired of chasing criminals.
It was time to go. Harry appreciated the invite, he really did. But he didn’t belong there—not only was he so completely closeted that he couldn’t relax enough to talk to anyone, but he struggled to share anything else about himself as he couldn’t be honest about magic either. And after too many drinks, trying to keep his story straight just seemed unreasonably daunting.
Harry took a deep breath as he crossed the threshold to the study, making a note of the woman sitting poised on a wingback chair in the corner of the room near the lit fireplace. He nodded to her in a sombre greeting as he crouched on the floor next to the body. He didn’t feel this was a particularly sad situation, but he had enough decency to respect her grief.
Once his fingers are coated, Harry hitches one of Draco’s legs over his shoulders and traces his small tight rim—soft slow touches, just enough to light up all the nerve endings.
“No, he just thought they were too public. He said what was the point if we were just going to parade around and draw attention to ourselves?”
It didn’t take long. Only a few strokes, the vibrating plug pressing up against Harry’s prostate, before Harry yelled out. Come shot in long ropes across his stomach and chest. He let out a long sigh, his body singing with the relief of finally being allowed to come.
Harry starts to giggle, such an intense release after weeks of being strung tight making him a bit giddy. Draco soon joins in, shaking against Harry’s body.
And he does that now—slows his breathing, waits for Draco and relinquishes any expectation of control.
And internal investigations were tricky, at best. They usually had to move slowly so as not to tip off the person or department being investigated, and that was if they even knew where to start.
“Shit,” Harry said, imagining the scene. Even Seamus’s worst day in Potions hadn’t led to anything that catastrophic. “What did you do?”
Harry whimpers. He doesn’t know; he can’t bring himself to care. All he wants is to find his release.
After a moment, Harry sighed and leaned back in his chair. Apparently, Draco was not in the mood to give up today. “I wasn’t going to do anything—will not do anything. That would be inappropriate; it’s your body.”’
The warehouse was a small one on the outskirts of the area, but Harry, Mel and Ron all agreed that it looked like a perfect size for smuggling illegal potions and ingredients. There was a freight train station just past the warehouse that would make for a convenient way to transport materials throughout the country without detection. And since some potions didn’t apparate well, and the Floo Network could be monitored, whoever was behind this needed other means of transportation.
By the time he’d finished his third drink, his shoulders slowly loosened, his face warm from the alcohol. Draco had wandered off a few minutes prior after checking with Harry that he was good. Harry had been surprised to note that he was. He felt comfortable here, still pushed up next to Lila, who had quickly gone from an intimidating presence to a safe one. She seemed to instinctively know when the conversation was heading towards topics Harry might not want to discuss and deftly steered them away.
“Maybe before you got in the shower, you’d stop and look in the mirror, take a good look—you have all the time now, don’t you?”
Harry wondered if there was any chance word of this wouldn’t spread—that he’d managed to wind up with three injured students in his very first lesson. Aaron let out a particularly loud whimper from behind him, and Harry sighed. Not likely, he decided, as he carefully made his way up the steps to the castle.
“Already? I thought you’d want more time to recover,” Draco says with a chuckle. “I suppose your third orgasm will probably still feel good.”
That conversation proved to be significantly more interesting, although Harry found himself feeling his usual underlying panic that he might wind up on the receiving end of some of the new pranks. These days, George tended to keep several testers on staff, but every once in a while his youthful humour came back in full force and anyone around was potentially a target. Percy was still on the receiving end more often than Harry and the others, though.
Harry sighed. She wasn’t wrong. Even though they were both pretty certain they were onto something, no Wizengamot member would appreciate being bothered over the weekend for what amounted to only a little more than a hunch. They’d have better luck on Monday. So, he’d have plenty of time to make it to his house for shopping with Ginny.
Then Draco’s tongue went back to trace Harry’s rim again, but this time, he pressed it inside gently. Harry writhed, his whole body reacting to the sensation.
Harry focuses on relaxing again as Draco’s cock breaches his throat, hits the soft tissue in the back. It’s harder this time since his body had gone into full alert.
He sighed as he walked into the dark sitting room that always seemed to smell a bit mildewy, no matter how frequently he cleaned. The house felt too big and empty. He reminded himself that he’d be at the Burrow the whole next day. By the end of that, he knew he’d be grateful for the reprieve in his quiet space. But at the moment, his heart ached with a sense of loss. He knew it wasn’t real—he’d lost nothing. He’d still see Teddy and Andromeda often enough; he was welcome over whenever he wanted, really. And he trusted that he and Draco would continue to build whatever friendship they had started that week, but none of that knowledge replaced the ache in his heart.
Harry felt his face flush in embarrassment. He’d probably made his thoughts a little too obvious. He’d often been told he broadcast his feelings clearly on his face, unable to hide them particularly well. He pulled out his wand and cast a cleaning charm on himself as Draco was doing the same on the other side of the room. They cleaned up the kitchen in silence.
“Well, this is certainly a nice sight to come home to.” Harry chuckled and tossed his robes onto the chair before ducking down and kissing Draco on the top of the head. “We might need to make this a regular thing.”
Harry’s heart fluttered at the idea of Draco putting all of Harry’s presents under the tree, but then he saw Draco’s sole gift and realised that would be the only gift he’d be receiving that year, having no other family to speak of. Harry put Andromeda’s present on the nearest stuffed chair and gathered the rest, tucking them behind the chair to open later.
Harry walked back into the office with two mugs of tea, careful not to upset the parchment spread out over his desk. Mel was muttering quietly to herself as she jotted down notes in her notepad. They’d been at it all day.
Draco flipped another card. Harry got another one right and relaxed into the ropes as Draco gave him ten strokes. The next two he lost, but they were thankfully low numbers. He then won another.
Draco pauses there, tickling back and forth along the upper crack until Harry’s pleading for mercy. And then, just as Harry’s certain it’s as bad as it can get, Draco drags the feather lower, teasing the outer rim of Harry’s hole. Harry jolts up what little distance he can in his restraints, crying out as Draco drags the feather in small circles, teasing the sensitive skin.
“I don’t know why. He told me—” He cleared his throat. “He told me he would disown and disinherit me and that I wouldn’t be a Malfoy anymore, as far as he was concerned. I had always just assumed he had followed through.”
“Good, actually. Molly definitely questioned whether I was sure, but then quickly pivoted to trying to set me up, so I figure things will be fine.”
Ron joined him and then walked around his desk, pulling Harry into a tight hug. After a thump on his back, Ron released him. “As the Head Auror, I’m sad to see you go—you’re a really fucking good Auror, Harry.”
“The second,” Draco says, holding up his other hand with the blue vial, “will cancel the effects of the first. If it becomes too much, say the word, and I’ll cancel the effects, okay?”
She nodded and looked at him for a beat too long to be comfortable. “So, are you and Draco finally dating?”
“Goodness no,” she said, putting a hand on her chest. “I haven’t touched dairy in nearly two decades. It’s terrible for the Sight, and also I get gas something terrible.”
“Yeah?” Draco props himself on his free elbow, his face a few inches from Harry’s as he continues to tease him, never pressing in.
Harry grinned and hooked his thumbs through Draco’s belt loops, pulling his hips against Harry’s, “I’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours.”
“I’ve got this, Potter,” Naomi replied with a smile. And Harry realised that she really did have it under control.
Draco trailed kisses down his stomach. “Fuck, you’re hot,” Draco breathed, as he mouthed at Harry’s defined abs. Harry silently thanked his Auror workout regime as he watched Draco’s pink tongue trace the muscles, sliding down his brown skin towards his hip.
“No, it’s fine. I’ve been… well I’m working on coming out, so—” Harry took a deep breath and looked up, fighting back the instinctual panic at the whole conversation.
“People will think it’s me, Harry. I have my reputation to think of.” Draco winked as he stood and finished fastening his trousers.
“Thanks, Hermione,” he said, pulling her into a tight hug before pulling back. He kept an arm over her shoulder and gave her a smile.
Harry nodded and his respect for the man went up a notch. Most wix hated being levitated by someone else, particularly those who worked in law enforcement—it was an uncomfortably vulnerable position, somewhat like being carried.
chased off any remaining nervousness Harry’d had about his inexperience and the newness of their relationship. The future felt wildly uncertain in a way he hadn’t had to deal with in many years. But this was grounding—this was real, visceral, and unambiguous.
“Well, that’s done,” Mel said, pushing through the exterior door. “And they were both telling the truth. Not to say I’m surprised after seeing Malfoy’s reaction to the news.”
Once the raid was done, the Junior Aurors would hang back, keeping any suspects in custody while the rest of the ragtag team would be heading to the Ministry to make the arrests. And while a few key, trusted members of the Wizengamot were aware of the plan, even the Minister himself was still in the dark. Although they didn’t suspect him personally, Ron said he didn’t know him well enough to take that gamble. It all felt just a little too close to the chaos of the war for Harry’s comfort.
So, as he watched Draco pull the velvet cloth off the Mirror of Erised, Harry wondered for the first time in a long time if it might show him something completely different.
“Okay. I’ll be back then,” Harry hesitated, feeling like he should say something more, something to acknowledge the moment that’d had just a few minutes ago. In the end, he didn’t know what to say, and after waiting a bit too long to be casual, he turned and walked away.
She pulled back. “No matter what, I still expect you to come by for dinner with me and Jess once in a while.”
Harry knelt down next to the camp bed, arranging the books and papers so the rune was visible on each. Mel joined him on the floor, helping to sort the documents.
Teddy bit his lip. “Am I in trouble?” His eyes were wide and his bottom lip looked like it was going to start quivering.
Eventually, though, his body settled. What had been torturous became only uncomfortable, and his body stopped trembling. Draco released him and grabbed his wand, flicking it, and Harry felt the plug shrink down and stop. He let out a long sigh, his arsehole still throbbing around the metal base.
After shuffling a few brooms around, he placed the freshly repaired ones in their places and took one last look around. He adjusted a few of the gloves in their pile and then pushed one of the Quidditch ball cases slightly to the left, forming a neat stack of the equipment. There was really nothing more to do, and he found his nerves starting to build at the thought of teaching actual students tomorrow.
“Yes, Harry,” Draco exhaled, his skin already tingling with excitement. He was more than a little relieved that Harry wasn’t going to drag this out, make Draco wait while he cooked dinner or some rubbish.
“Understood.” Harry nodded. Quarrington was the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and Robards boss, so he’d make sure they had the resources, even if it meant borrowing some MLE officers.
Harry feels another push. He expects the plug to just push in a little bit further, but it keeps going until it’s pushing right up against his prostate. He knows at once which toy Draco has just worked into him — a wicked metal thing that will rub and push on that little bundle of nerves just right until he’s begging to come. The heavy bulbous base settles right on Harry’s taint, doubling the stimulation. The metal prostate massager is thick, heavy, and unforgiving—its weight a constant presence.
“Oh god,” Harry pants. “It’s like when you’re rimming me, but more; it’s so much, so intense and it’s all I can focus on—” It’s the best he can do before dropping his head back again.
Harry dropped his head back against the door with a thud as Draco leaned in and pressed a kiss to the top of Harry’s hard flushed cock.
It took him far too long to work out what she meant by the question. And then, when it clicked, he vehemently denied that was the problem. She didn’t continue to press but asked him to think about it.
Harry’s stomach turned cold as he ran through a list of everyone who would have known about their mission. A good portion of the Auror department knew about ongoing cases, although he wasn’t sure too many had overheard them talking about the warehouse. There was obviously the chain of command—anyone that needed to approve the warrant from Robards and Quarrington all the way up to the Wizengamot member who gave the final approval. And then, finally, the paperwork trail.
“Okay,” Ron moved towards the kitchenette and began to pace. “I’ll have to pull together a team quietly. I’m not sure how long this will take.”
Harry grunts and stretches his arms over his head as he turns over onto his back. His t-shirt rides up further, showing his tight abs, his sharp hip peaking over the joggers. When he looks back over, he catches Draco looking and his smile widens. “What are the boys up to?”
“Yes, sir.” Draco dropped a kiss on Harry’s lips and jumped up, his skin vibrating with excitement. It looked like it was going to be a good birthday, after all.
“Don’t look at me,” Mel said. “I already promised Jess I would rest this time. And, no offence, sir, but she’s scarier than you.”
Before he recovered, the cards were being slid to the left and another card flipped. Four of Hearts.
On several occasions, when they did have a treat, Harry slipped Draco the leftover biscuit or chocolate to keep it out of Teddy’s hands, as the man seemed to be able to hold his chocolate just fine. Harry had the distinct feeling with every treat given, Draco got nicer to Harry too. If only Harry had known he could bribe Draco with chocolate years ago. They might have got to the point of being comfortably cordial when Teddy was a baby, even.
“And I’m the only one that gets to see you, naked and begging.” Draco wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist pulling him toward him.
With his free hand, he put Harry’s hand in his hair and looked up at him. Harry would know what he wanted. For all that Harry missed social cues, he always seemed to know what Draco wanted in the bedroom. Or closet, in this case.
Harry had been too hopped up on potions the previous day to give it much thought, but he couldn’t help but get stuck on the absolute surreal quality of this moment. Of being injured and on home recovery, being taken care of by Draco Malfoy. Draco, who had dropped everything to spend every hour outside of work with Harry for two days. And, as strange as it would have sounded to his sixteen-year-old self, there wasn’t a single person that Harry would rather have volunteered for the job. As terrible as this case was turning out, he was secretly grateful it had been dumped on him at that moment.
Harry strode out with his game face to see two wizards talking just outside one of the offices. He vaguely recognised one of the men as Simon Crane, Sharon’s boss.
“I have one more.” Malfoy raised an eyebrow, his eyes mischievous. “What are you doing on Saturday?”
After a few more folders, he found his month. When he pulled it open, he found it empty. Frowning, he glanced back at the first letter. The date was there, clear as could be, but there was nothing. He looked in the months on either side of it just to be safe. There was one request from the previous month. A Floo connection to be added at a tea shop in Salisbury. Harry doubted there was any connection, but duplicated the parchment anyway and added it to his stack.
Crane narrowed his eyes, before smiling politely. “I didn’t know any warrants had come through for our department.”
Harry shrugged. There was nothing to be done about it now. And his life now was infinitely better; he had the Weasleys, his friends, Andromeda and Teddy and this little makeshift family here, also, which he realised even included Draco.
“No reason in particular—just wanted to catch up since you’re so busy.” She tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear. “I’ve just been missing you.”
“Hey, Bill.” Harry shrugged out of his coat and tossed it over the chair by the door on top of the pile of other coats.
Draco flushed at the thought that Harry’d been working on this for months, likely tying up someone as he learned, practising just for him. He couldn’t even feel jealousy with the excitement thrumming through his veins.
Harry nodded. He’d seen a couple of other friends, people from work, do it, but it was never easy—straddling both worlds. Though if anyone could pull it off, he was sure Draco could.
The waitress came and got their order. Without the menus as a distraction, they settled into an awkward silence. Draco simply raised an eyebrow at him, as if to say get on with it, and Harry remembered why he was there.
“There are what? Ten students in that class?” Malfoy waved his hand dismissively. “Besides, it’s not too far from my classroom.”
Before he could fully open the door, or even begin to step forward, an explosion sent him flying backwards, a thundering noise crashing through the air.
“Come in,” Ron’s voice called out. “Harry, good, you’re here. Close the door, please.” Ron gestured to the chair that wasn’t covered in stacks of case files and papers. “Sorry about the mess,” he said with a grimacing smile.
His eyes roamed over the rest of the room. There really wasn’t anything else to save—nothing of sentimental value at least. It was just furniture and some decorations. He left the mess and headed upstairs with the photo frames.
Draco continues running his hands up and down Harry’s overly sensitive skin. He makes his way around the ropes, dragging his fingers across the hollow of Harry’s armpit. Harry jerks to the side, but he’s too exhausted, too wrung out to put up much of a fight as Draco continues with his maddeningly light touches.
Harry feels Draco’s hand rest on his hip as Draco ducks around the ropes, working his way up to Harry’s head. Harry blinks at him, his head still hanging back, putting the world upside-down. He's too tired to lift it anymore.
He quickly scanned the area. There were large objects along the far east and north walls but it was too dark to make out any details.
Harry stopped himself from following, trying to respect Draco’s need for privacy. With a sigh, he put down the stack of letters and went back to his own stack, skin still prickling with the anger he felt at Lucius Malfoy. He knew both from Draco and the little he’d seen of their relationship at Hogwarts that Lucius Malfoy had both expected to be involved in his son’s life and to have a say in his decisions. But this was worse than Harry expected.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, trying to ignore the snogging scene in the mirror still happening in the corner of his eye. It was getting more heated by the moment. Apparently, not as heated as Draco’s version, though. “It, erm—it shows you your deepest desire.”
Harry slips his hands around Draco’s hips, along the curve of his arse. “Think you’re up for another attempt?”
They grabbed their cloaks and headed towards the lifts to the Atrium. As they walked to the exit, she looked over at him.
“What classes?” Harry asked, thinking about his own training—he wasn’t necessarily skilled enough in some of those subjects.
Draco’s brain was still fuzzy and his body limp when he felt Harry start to undo the rope, winding it around and around, slipping it through the knots and turns. The last bit was unravelled from one of his legs, and Draco sighed as Harry straightened Draco’s legs and massaged his muscles.
“I can—” Draco gestured at the door. “I can stay on the sofa, if it would make you more comfortable.”
As he turned another corner, he realised that he recognised the neighbourhood. He was only a few streets away from Malfoy’s pub. He slowed down his pace and contemplated whether he should stop in.
“I think I could use coffee this morning,” Harry said, the exhaustion from the past week still deep in his bones. Harry grabbed the coffee for himself and handed Draco the tea.
Harry moans, his whole body breaking out in a shiver as the toy vibrates deep inside him. His cock is still attempting to get hard, but Harry’s not sure he can manage it at this point.
Harry scooted up to eye-level and planted an apologetic kiss on Draco’s lips. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t even think—”
Ron flipped through the folder and looked back at them with a sigh. “So, basically we really don’t have anything.”
Draco came out and joined him in the study after a short conversation with Ms Johnson as he walked her to the door.
Draco continues to stroke him through his sobs, through his pleas. "You came dry. There was nothing left; it was perfect, pet.”
The Floo roared to life in the sitting room, and Harry heard Teddy shriek with joy at the arrival of his grandmother. He finished setting the last few glasses on the table, as Draco took the turkey out of the oven; he’d been correct that his spells cooked the turkey just in time. To Harry’s relief, they had settled into a comfortable routine as they finished the meal, any remaining awkwardness falling away. After the week they’d had, Harry would have been beyond disappointed if he lost the seeds of this new friendship.
“It’s Christmas Eve, and we’re going to have some hot chocolate and read Teddy Christmas stories by the fire,” Draco said, his voice slightly muffled by the pantry he’d leaned into, likely rooting around for the chocolate they’d hidden earlier from Teddy when he’d tried to sneak into the kitchen to get more.
Harry breaks out in a sweat, his cock softening in the process as Draco drags his wand over his body. He knows it’s not doing any damage, but that doesn’t stop the sting. It doesn’t change how the pain adds another dimension to the situation, confusing Harry’s senses, further sensitising his every nerve ending.
Draco finished re-dusting the sideboard and moved across the room, dragging the feathers along the wall, lightly dusting any surface as he passed it. Harry gave up on listening to the game and let his eyes follow the movement.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, he really does. And he’s really good at it.” He wasn’t sure if Ginny knew about Ron’s promotion, so he left it at that since Ron would want to be the one to tell everyone.
Draco stood up, stretching before coming back to sit on the chair at the end of the table. This time, he didn’t bother with tea. He reached out and ran a finger down Harry’s cock.
“It’s a fairly rare magical creature from the Philippines that’s known to live in some of the mountain ranges there. Its breath is deadly and untraceable. After inhaling the poison, the victim would die fairly quickly, within half an hour or so. And the poison would dissipate in under an hour, so there’s only a short time frame where it could be traced. In their home area, they’ve been known to kill wix without a trace.”
His memories slowly trickled back in as he remembered the last thing he’d seen, taking a sharp inhale and feeling the last remnants of grogginess disappear with a jolt. “Mel—where’s Mel?”
Draco crawled over on his knees, the expression on his face showing he knew he’d won the game. Harry was sure he’d regret giving in so easily later, but for the moment couldn’t remember why he cared about who cleaned the house.
“They’re near impossible to kill,” Draco replied. “And they not only grow in adverse conditions, they blossom.”
Harry grit his teeth, biting back a retort, and closed the pantry doors, taking his banana to an empty table near the fireplace, pointedly ignoring the other man.
Over the past day, Harry had started to recognise the embers of a growing crush, an obviously ill-advised crush as they’d only just begun to get along. Harry tried to remind himself that he was just feeling particularly sappy after watching the man take care of Teddy all week. And if his eyes sparkled when he laughed at Teddy’s excitement, it was likely just the fairy lights. And he was probably just feeling desperate, from the sad event his dating life had turned out to be. No need to jeopardise their newfound friendship with a passing fancy.
“Wait—I’m sorry. I’m not sure I heard that right. Are you admitting to being jealous of me?” Harry laughed, shocked that Draco could be so honest about it, even now.
Eventually, Teddy settled down, and Harry and Draco were able to gather their belongings, saying their goodbyes in front of the Floo.
Every time they got a hint of a lead on this case, it quickly turned into a dead end. Now they were compiling a second list of “acquaintances” for Astor, which was turning out to be just as frustratingly long as the list for Lucius Malfoy. This situation would have been frustrating in any case; but coupled with the conflicting feelings Harry had about even trying to catch whoever murdered Lucius Malfoy in the first place, it was practically unbearable.
Harry stirs again, but this time, sleepily blinks his eyes open. When his eyes focus, a slow smile curves over his lips.
He turned it on, glad to see it had a full charge. While there were a few spells that could charge the Muggle technology, Harry tended to overshoot and fry the devices. After he initially learned the charging spell, he’d gone through four phones in a month before deciding to just stick to chargers and magical power banks.
“It’s been very neglected lately with both of us so busy at work,” Draco continues, trailing kisses down Harry’s neck. “And in there, I can give you my full, undivided attention.”
“I don’t want them in my hair!” Harry laughed and slowly backed off, keeping a hand on the other man’s chest to keep him from escaping back to the counter.
Harry scooted over and pulled him into his arms. “No, Teddy. You aren’t in trouble at all. Draco and I really messed this up. We tried to give you everything you wanted, and we weren’t being responsible adults.”
“That’s what changed your mind?” She spun to look at him. “Oh my god, you always were obsessed with that man.”
“Then, I don’t think I will.” Draco continued to tug roughly, dragging his thumb across his slit before the downstroke, twisting on the upstroke.
“Why did you?” Harry asked. It was something that he’d been wondering about since their lunch. “Why not try to make a go of it in the wizarding community?”
“Oh.” Malfoy’s brow furrowed. “I suppose a little bit of both. Sometimes, I just feel the need to be above ground after a day in the dungeons.”
Eventually, Minerva finished and opened the floor to the faculty. Harry glanced around, saw that Malfoy was still grading essays right through the meeting, and just barely refrained from rolling his eyes.
“I can’t tell if this is your way of dumping this list of Lucius’s acquaintances on me, or if you just want to go stare at Malfoy for an uncomfortable amount of time,” she said with a raised eyebrow.
“Are you—” Draco started and then stopped, seemingly considering his next words. “Does it bother you that I’m not a part of the wizarding community? That I don’t use magic anymore?”
“Don’t you worry about your flatmates?” Harry asked, remembering the two stoners with whom Draco shared his flat.
He was also starving, and very much looking forward to the order he’d put in with the elves for his snacks, particularly the treacle tart-flavoured yoghurt. He’d been tempted to put actual treacle tart on the daily menu but figured he wasn’t nearly active enough for that to be a good idea. He was neither a teenager nor a professional Quidditch player anymore, after all.
Harry took a sip but continued to hold eye contact with Ewan, knowing it was absurd even as he did it. Draco wasn’t his. He was free to chat up anyone he wanted. But in Harry’s drunken state, he couldn’t quite tamp down the jealousy in the moment.
“Yeah. It’s, well… not going. We’ve got nothing.” Harry was sure to never get into too many details with his family, confidentiality and all, but Ron and he often discussed the broad strokes of their cases.
Harry felt his phone vibrate in his pocket and took it out to see that he had a text from Draco. He stamped down the flutter of excitement he felt and put it back in his pocket to reply to later.
Draco huffs a laugh and reaches out to Harry, letting him pull him up. “Should have known better. Maybe tomorrow.”
“For us,” Draco said, his expression soft before huffing a laugh. “Look at us, making all these life changing decisions on a Friday morning.”
“Good.” Harry pulled himself up, tucking himself back in and zipping up his jeans. He offered a hand to Draco, who smiled at him and kicked off his heels before standing up.
“If she’s stealing my chocolate, she can have it,” Malfoy said, shaking his head slightly. “Come on, Potter—to the greenhouses!”
“Oh, Harry.” She flew forward wrapping him in her arms again. “Hey. It’s okay. I promise it will be okay. And no matter what, you know I’ll be there, right?”
From the intel they had, Astor spent his weekdays at his office, but since that had been a bust, they were hoping to find him at home. They didn’t really know enough about the man’s schedule to know where else to check if they didn’t find him at home. He had no family and no friends, just a very long list of “business acquaintances.” Not unlike Lucius Malfoy, in fact.
“But then, I keep thinking that even if I only kept a bit of it—the kind of flat I could get, not having roommates…” Draco sighed. “I just don’t know…
“I was thinking it was Saturday and our best chance at checking out the records before someone had a chance to tamper with them after they’d been tipped off with a warrant.”
“Back there.” Adrastos pointed a large container to the back corner between several cages. “Different creatures need different things. I do not know all the food requirements.”
“Obviously, didn’t you… of course you didn’t.” Malfoy rolled his eyes dramatically. “I assume you lot just believed no one would take your things.”
Harry huffed a laugh and cast two spells in quick succession at the wizard. The second one hit, and the wizard crumpled to the ground. Harry thumped Ron on the back, and they both turned to the witch who was duelling Proudfoot. Seeing the three Aurors now turned towards her, she slowly lifted her hands and dropped her wand.
When Harry finally got back to Emily, he was slightly breathless from all the running back and forth. “Okay, ready to try this again?”
As Teddy ran off to the sitting room, yelling something incoherent about Santa, Harry rummaged through his duffle until he found his Weasley jumper from last year. He’d packed a few, just in case, but he usually wore the previous one on Christmas morning. It had become a bit of a tradition even when he just knocked around Grimmauld Place until it was time to go to the Weasleys’ for dinner. He was, of course, welcome anytime, but the noise and chaos got to be a bit much after ten hours, unused to it as he was.
“Eh, he’s well enough to still yell and complain at everyone at Mungo’s,” Ron said with a laugh. “So, he’ll recover—but he’s decided it's time to retire. Said he’s got enough money for the seaside cottage he’s been saving up for.”
“Hi. Er— yeah,” Harry glanced around to check for any Muggles. “George—er, Weasley, that is, invented a case that lets them work around magic. He even makes some signal boosters that help the signals get through places like St Mungo’s and the Ministry. Something about wrapping the signal in a protective spell as it goes through it. I didn’t really understand it when he was explaining it.”
Teddy shrieked in excitement and grabbed a present off the top, sending wrapping paper flying. Harry glanced back at Draco who was watching Teddy with a small smile playing at his lips. He stared for a beat too long. Draco’s eyes flicked over to Harry, and he rose an eyebrow. Harry flushed and focused back on Teddy.
Draco gave him a small smile as he headed over to a young man leaning over the bar. When Draco got over there, the man’s eyes lit up.
“You just came in and offered to buy the pub?” Harry asked incredulously. It never even dawned on him that that was a thing you could do, but he supposed it made sense. The worst the owner could have said was no.
Harry stretches and yawns; Draco is already stirring beside him as well. It’s been a busy couple of weeks, and he’s appreciating having a lie in for once.
Harry nodded and headed to the bathroom. He turned on the shower right away. It took an unreasonably long time to get warm, as he’d come to find out over the last few days. Then, he turned and looked in the mirror. He looked like shit—bags under his bloodshot eyes, hair tangled and wild, even more so than usual.
“Magic way to do what?” Harry asked as he spread out the potatoes on a baking sheet, sliding them into the oven.
So after searching far and wide, Draco found a small dilapidated pub just on the edge of an up-and-coming neighbourhood. And after some much needed renovations, he opened The Rusty Wand nearly a year to the day after he’d re-opened the Dragon’s Lair. And with the help of his new manager, Lila, that pub was doing well also. It was perfect for Draco. He split his time between the two pubs, each having a manager to run the place on the nights he wasn’t there, which even allowed him to take an occasional weekend off.
“Maybe they’re already there,” whispered Harry. “I’m going to crack the door.” He moved to grab the doorknob.
Harry nods and casts a quick wandless lubrication at Draco’s hand, before throwing his head back with a sigh as Draco starts stroking him.
Harry sped up, chasing the orgasm as it started to build in his gut, and then let out a small cry as he spilt out over his hand.
“Shit. Simon Crane—I knew it had something to do with the Floos,” Harry said, his jaw set. “What’s the spell again? Teach it to me.”
He blinked a few times, clearing the last remains of sleep from his eyes. A groan escaped his lips as the rest of his body woke up, clearly suffering from the after-effects of spell damage. He felt like he’d been hit by a freight train.
But he wanted to make damn sure he didn’t do anything else that might cause her to suspect his secret. And given that Ginny was the only person he’d ever told, barring a Muggle man who had never been given Harry’s real name, he definitely didn’t want to back himself into a corner where his options were either outing himself or having his partner think he was homophobic.
“Anders,” Justin said as he joined them. “Thurgood was looking for you. Something about wanting to talk about process improvements?”
Draco nodded. “You know, it’s Lila’s birthday on Saturday. We both even managed to get the night off at the same time, and she’s throwing a party. You should come.”
“What are the chances we’ve actually got one of these things running around England?” Mel asked, leaning over the table to get a better look at the photos.
He’d been frequently and adamantly opposed to any argument about his choices, but lately… lately he was starting to feel like she might be right. Somewhere between that pride flag in the pub window, and Draco putting his number in Harry’s phone, Harry was starting to question these choices that he’d been so adamant about.
Harry hesitated and then, deciding to throw caution to the wind, leant over and pressed a light kiss onto Draco’s lips. Face flushing, he then took off his coat and slid in the booth across from Draco.
“I’m so sorry—I’m so so sorry,” Draco murmured into his hair as he continued to rub his back. “It’s over now though, okay?”
The woman raised her finger at Mel. “You gotta watch out in these neighbourhoods. Just a few years ago, Mrs Morgan was having men over at all hours!”
He pulled off his joggers and t-shirt. Fortunately, he wasn’t nearly as sweaty and gross as the trainees, as he had primarily been walking around and correcting their stances and spellwork. He tossed the clothes in a pile in the corner and chucked a couple cleaning and freshening spells at himself, just to be safe, before putting on his nicest jeans and a deep teal shirt.
Harry felt his heart stutter and tried to tamp down a rising flush, mentally chastising himself. What was wrong with him? It wasn’t like he’d never seen an attractive man before. Hell, it wasn’t like he hadn’t seen Malfoy before. He tried to focus on some of their worst moments and settled on getting his nose broken on the train. Harry grimaced at the thought, still remembering the crunch too vividly, but it did the job, and he was focused again.
After the tube ride and another walk from the station, they were climbing the stairs to Lila’s flat, Harry trying to subtly wipe off his sweaty palms in his coat pocket and settle his nerves.
