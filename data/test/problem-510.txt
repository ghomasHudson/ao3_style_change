Harry groans.  He thought he got away with it.  Tried all night to stay loose in his stride, but Draco
Harry grins, wagging his brows.  Certain in the knowledge he’s already won.  “C’mon.”  He prods, pulling Draco in tighter.  “For me?”
“The manor is inhospitable.  No one can live there, Mother.  The ministry has it sealed and for good reason.”  He said.
“You can try.  I’ll send some pamphlets along with you though I’m certain you’ve done them before when you first came to us.”  Hargreeves says, removing the whirring contraption and standing up.  “Our research team has been experimenting with a salve that may be of some help too.  I believe you fit the criteria for that experimental trial.  We’ve made significant progress with dermal treatments to blood curses.”
Harry ties himself.  Draco will help if asked, but he prefers Harry to have his own set up.  That way, he is always able to get himself untied.  Tonight, Harry ties his wrists together behind his back.  They have moved to the bedroom for this.
Lily scoots back in her chair until she can turn and get down.  Looking confused and upset.  “I’m going to Daddy.  He’ll tell me true.  Draco didn’t hurt nobody.”
It is frenzied then as they grab at each other.  One of his arms going around Draco’s waist and the other the back of the man’s neck as his boyfriend pulls him in by his robes.  Ankles hooking behind him.
“He isn’t wrong.”  Harry jokes.  “I have been known to excite both witches and wizards alike.  It is a gift and a curse.”
“As my own godson would say, ‘I am shook’.”  Harry tells him.  Thinking fondly of Teddy, who was already a third year Hufflepuff at Hogwarts.
Draco is restless following the conversation with his mother.  Fidgety in a way that is not typical of him as he changes into his pajamas.  Harry figures it is the stress of the holiday.  Ginny used to get weird about family time together during the holidays too.  Harry is ready to settle in for the night when his boyfriend moves to straddle him after he lays down in bed.  Fingers moving questioningly along the waistband of Harry’s pants, arse grinding suggestively on Harry’s groin.
Harry sobers at that, glancing sideways at his companion.  He definitely is not the only one who has been thinking about their relationship.  Who are they to each other now the experiment is over?
He kisses Molly’s cheek.  Then, facing the table – particularly Ron – nods to them and goes to collect his children.  Hopefully, they would be done with their meal.
“That sounds . . . homey.”  Harry decides on saying.  Honestly, the thought of spending twelve straight days with Lucius and Narcissa seemed anything but festive.  More like a punishment really.
It feels like someone’s hit him with a jinx as his legs wobble.  Thankfully, Draco’s enough sense to hold him more securely as the man helps him to lay on the floor.  Kneeling beside him.  Hands going over him to investigate the parts where he was tied.
“Let’s go to dinner, Potter.”  Draco states in the assured tone Harry is most familiar with hearing nowadays, taking Harry’s hand to pull him along.
The boy digs in his pockets and pulls out a piece of folded up paper.  “I wanted to show you first before I showed Dad.”
Hermione gives him a sad smile and hands him a conciliatory slice of cake he takes two bites of before pushing away.
“Let me rephrase,” Harry starts, raising his pointer finger.  “I want to give you a ring because we are committed to each other and because I want people to stop hitting on you.”
“I love you Mini-Bolt.  I love how fast you go over the hill at Nan’s.  I love that you are better at turning than Jamie’s dumb Rapid.”
He reconvenes with Harry back at their hotel suite.  His boyfriend is starfished out on the bed obviously relishing his time off based on the snack wrappers littering the bedspread and the flatscreen televisor in their room turned on to some inane program.  A tray on the bed has a stack of waffles on it.  Harry is clearly relaxed, down to his pants and a tee as he gives Draco a jovial wave – waffle in hand.
Harry goes over to the stove and turns the meat over, returning with the cast-iron skillet to place on the island.  “Put them all in.”  He instructs, dropping his in to cover the side closest to him and the chicken.
If he takes a bit longer to provide an answer, then it is a suitable consequence for the boys plopping themselves rudely into adults’ conversations.
Harry orders for both of them when they get to the food cart and they make their way over to one of the tall tables scattered around.  Draco carrying their drinks and Harry with the two baskets of skewers stacked.
“Okay.”  Al says nodding beside Jamie.  Al liked Draco except when he agreed with Dad about him being naughty.
He got primary custody of the children.  It was practical although the press had a field day about it.  Ginny kept the cottage.  He gave her half of his money even when they had a row about it.  Ginny insisted on paying child support.  They had a row about that.  Ginny began to date one of the physio trainers on the team.  He was okay with that actually.  Harry started going to muggle clubs and gay bars.  Exploring more of who he was.
It is for the best.  Draco is uncertain he could collect himself enough to prevent James from realizing how hurt he is by the boy’s anger and resentment if Harry were to force the issue now.  No.  They will deal with this later.
They start going to Draco’s flat too.  It’s nice like the hotel he stayed at once with Mum when she took him to a quidditch tournament in South Africa.  It even smells nice like the hotel.  The floors are either shiny wood or plush carpet.  Both feel nice when you’re just in your socks.  All the walls are painted with dark trim.  There are a few framed landscapes of the countryside with clouds gently passing by and animals ambling through.  Lily likes the picture of a beautiful blonde woman gracefully curtseying in a long, fluffy dress then clasping her hands.  Like the wind-up ballerina toy at their house.  Draco tells them that’s his mum.
“You and Potter are quite the pair, aren’t you?”  She finally states with a shake of her head fending off the closest thing to an eyeroll he has ever witnessed on her face.  “I did wonder.”
chose!”  His boyfriend yells, hand suddenly fisting his own hair as if to contain himself.  Knuckles white as his entire body twists forward as if trying to suppress a great weight that’s fallen.  Face aggrieved and pale.  “Not you!”  He cries.
“Yes!”  His boyfriend agrees enthusiastically, eyes widening that much more, and grin growing wicked.  The heat of his gaze makes Draco shiver.
Harry runs a shower for Albus, and Draco goes to get medicine.  He has several stomach soothing potions and fever reducers.  Olta is off for the next week visiting family so he summons Kreacher to request a clean set of pajamas for Albus.  Lily and James are still fast asleep when he checks on them.  Hopefully, they do not become ill too.
He sprints down the embankment to the creek.  Heart pounding in fear.  Focused on the little body partly covered by the rocks, water rushing over him.  There is a flash of silver in his periphery as Harry’s stag Patronus tears ahead of him.  Hooves loud on the ground.
healers for a reference here – to me specifically – to be included in our trials. Granted, their charts were not nearly as convincing as yours -
“I am a transwoman.”  Simone states simply.  “I was transitioning to living authentically as myself when I met these two, but I had not had much thought about what sort of work I would do.  At Beauxbatons, I had been an average student and I had no family.  I was more or less a wandering spirit in those days.”
Merlin, he loves Draco messy.  “I love you.”  Harry croons, leaning in once more to kiss him and resting his forehead against Draco’s.  Stroking at the man's back with his other hand.  “You make me feel so amazing, sweetheart.  Let me make you feel good.”
Jamie follows keeping his eyes peeled as they walk around the holes scattered throughout this area.  They aren’t too deep, but they are pretty much all the same diameter.  Small claw marks clear at the bottom of some of them.  When they get to the garden’s stone wall sectioning off this side, he gives Al a boost before hauling himself over.
paranoia, Potter.  I am not so simple as to assume I am free to move about as I please – not in Britain.”  As if to demonstrate the hypocrisy of this statement, Malfoy jumps to his feet to pace the office floor.  “At least, be honest with me, Potter.  If there is anything about
“Oh, that.”  Jamie considers.  “No.  I guess not.”  He determines.  Draco didn’t cause any problems so far as Jamie could tell.  Draco didn’t boss him either like other adults.  Sure, Uncle Ron didn’t like him, but Dad wanted him around.
It's a heady experience.  He gasps as Draco takes him in.  His senses narrowing for a few minutes to the velvet heat of Draco’s mouth.  Watching Draco blow him and having people walk drunkenly by, laughing and boisterous, appearing little more than a few feet away.  So many of them had ogled Draco tonight.  He was never jealous of the women.  They never had a chance.  But the men.  Harry has always been a possessive person.  He accepted that long ago.
The elf walks past Potter, ignoring his master and looking at Draco almost reverently.  Tears flowing.  “Kreacher is remembering.  Kreacher knows your magic.  You is Miss Cissy’s baby.  Miss Cissy brings you here to be showing my mistress.”  He whispers intensely, eyes filling again with tears.
“I used to be a death eater, boys.”  Draco tells them gently, then looks over to Dad as if checking for permission.  Dad gives him a slight nod and Draco continues, frowning.  “I made many terrible decisions.  A good many people do not like me because of those choices, and they have that right.  You boys will probably hear more people say similar things.  For that, I am sorry.”
“Malfoy.”  Ron states, glancing suspiciously between Harry and Draco.  “Long time no see.  I thought you had skulked off for good.  Why didn’t you stay away?”
“You’ll be okay.”  He tries to soothe.  Whether for him or James or both, he does not know.  He finally pockets his wand.  Realizing he is soaked and pats the boy’s head.  “Albus is safe now.  You are safe.”  He comforts, voice raspy.
Ron grins.  He was probably the best at this game.  “Your five.”  Ron instructs him.  Harry looks around and sees an older lady walking past.
“I hoped you would.”  Draco whispers back.  Smile small evident on his face.  Clearly pleased.  “I wasn’t sure.”
He usually naps after a jog and today is no different.  Kicking his trainers off and flopping down on his bed.  He listens absently to Draco in the next room turn the shower on.  The sound of the water running.  Catching the sound of Draco humming the tune to a song Harry doesn't know.
The moment is electric.  A spark of magic between two separate forces filling him with energy.  Harry knows what it is to love someone.  What he didn't understand is how different it is to love someone both so new and known to him.  Draco met him in a way he never thought possible.
“I hate him!  Why can’t you just be with Mum?”  He yells at Harry.  “I don’t wanna be here anymore I’m going to the cottage!”
“High maintenance.”  Harry accuses, but it is teasing.  His boyfriend connects their lips again, slipping his tongue inside.  Draco's toes curl in his shoes, shutting his eyes at the same time.  Harry is a good kisser.  A fact his boyfriend never failed to use against him – many times.
They were allowed to say goodbye.  Mother kissing Father on his cheek.  Hallowed in and pallid.  Wildly different from the handsome face of his youth.  Draco knew he fared little better.  Father gave him a hard look.  Grey eyes so like his own flinty and relentless.
“Those mean it’s a no go.”  Harry explains in an aside.  “Whenever he wears those flannel pajamas it does.”
They scheduled meeting at the fish and chips cart today.  Malfoy is sitting on the bench just inside the park.  The cart is set in front of the park's entrance to reel in the passing foot traffic.  This is the fifth time they've met this way.  He'd hoped Malfoy would be less tense about it.  The man seemed more at ease around him the more they met.
The elf glares at his master but complies with a deep bow toward Draco and a pop away out of the room.  Draco hopes he did not offend the elf.  Potter clears his throat, getting Draco’s attention again.
Harry snorts, but allows the separation.  Draco reaches out to move a potato back that falls over to his side, but Harry grabs his boyfriend’s hand.  “That’s hot be careful.”
Draco.  Knows that it must be.  He understands this logically, but the emotion that accompanies it is beyond him.  An acute, heartrending thing.  It is grief and love and awe mixed together with such wrenching force.
It’s a losing battle.  Not that he’ll admit that to Draco.  He can feel himself start to sweat as his boyfriend starts to undo his shirt.  Draco glances shyly up as he goes.  Revealing more skin flushed pink from Harry’s attention.  Clever fingers flicking open the fronts of his trousers as the slacks lower over trim hips.  Harry’s breath hitches at the dark, delicate cloth left behind.  All sensation rushing south.  Beginning to feel floaty rush he was seeking.
“Very well.”  Potter agrees sounding put upon.  But when Draco looks over at him, his boyfriend is grinning.  Potter is so often smiling.  There are tiny laugh lines around the corners of his mouth and eyes.  Draco finds them utterly charming despite himself.
?”  Ron exclaims, over Hermione’s protests, hands gesticulating.  Harry sees some people in the room look over to them.  “
It was one of the best things that could have ever happened to him.  That first year humbled and expanded his worldview a thousand fold.  Away from his parents' control for the first time.  All his decisions his own.  Every failure and success.  He would not trade that experience for anything.
Fortunately, the children seemed completely unaware.  Albus was delighted and clearly enjoyed the day to its fullest.  Playing a new game with his young cousins and mates from school.  Beaming when his grandmother brought out his cake and everyone sang for him.
“Hyperion.”  His lab partner proclaims a few yards behind Draco.  Prompting him to pivot to face his peer once again.
“I don’t know.”  Harry replies, scratching at the back of his neck.  His PR person would probably thank him if he did, but public statements invited public interest in his personal life.  He and Draco were lucky to be flying under the radar as it was.  “What do you think I should do?”
It shocked him to his core when he was sentenced to probation and released into his mother’s custody.  He had expected years if not decades in Azkaban.  He deserved them.  The mark on his arm was proof enough of that.  He had taken it gladly after all.
“I’m there most of the time.”  Simone answers.  “I was born there.  My designing business is based in Paris too, but I also spend time in Seoul where a few of our other businesses are located.”
The younger members of his squad tell him that Astoria has quite the social media presence and that it is apparently
A tense Harry worried him and today had enough emotions running high.  He walks over to the other man, wrapping his arms around Harry’s torso, and resting his chin on his boyfriend’s shoulder.  There is an infinitesimal shift in his stance as Harry leans back into his embrace.  Uncrossing his arms, one hand taking Draco’s injured one and slotting their fingers together.
Hermione just laughs and waves him off.  “I’m fine, really.  Tell us more about who you are seeing.  What’s he like?  Where did you meet?”
They are in the lunchroom at school.  He's sitting with his mates: Yuri, Ian, and Hogarth.  It was normal for kids to trade their food for things they wanted during the meal time.  Jamie traded his veg for crackers often enough.  He hated all the green stuff Draco asked Olta to make them.
"It is true - as others have attested - that I fought for Hogwarts in the end.  If that is my one good act in this life, then so be it.  Let it stand on its own.  I apologize for the rest.  Every hateful, self-centered act that I am pleading guilty to today.  The only thing I beg this court for . . . is that my one moral act not be weighed against my many gross misdeeds.  I am not fit for even a fraction of mercy.  I engaged in every one of my crimes knowingly and with full intent to harm others to save myself.  I am a coward and . . . I deserve whatever punishment this council deems fit.”  He rasps out.
The two of them watched curiously from around the corner as Dad returned down the stairs tucked behind the plain, wooden door on the third floor.  The only door in the house that Dad always kept locked.  Shaking his head with a rolled up rug tucked under his arm that would eventually be used to cover the floor where the crunchy carpet was removed.  Kreacher trailed Dad wringing his gnarled hands piteously, muttering about his mistress and
It is not a thought he relishes having once they come down from the high.  Certainly, Draco would be horrified.  But none of that matters now.  Not with Draco lying half on top of him and in the space at his side.  Resting against each other as they cool off.  It is the most at ease he has felt in over a week like a giant knot in his back has been kneaded away.  His boyfriend’s hands slowly wandering, pausing here and there, caressing.
His boyfriend had been beside himself getting everything ready.  Dort, the house elf in charge of the manor, was often found overseeing the final touches to their plans.   The elf was incredibly helpful.  Always certain in how they should proceed.  Harry vastly preferred the elf and his good-natured advice over Narcissa’s.  Who, as far as he could tell, was bewildered at Draco’s plan to open the manor to
“That was a very different circumstance.”  He defends.  A situation he was right about too he might add, but now was not the time to point that out.
“It’s like what you’d do for the chickenpox.”  Harry explains at Draco’s questioning look, pouring in baking soda.  “It helps with the itching.”
“She let you be a child.”  Harry surmises.  Trying to imagine a young Draco and Narcissa hidden away in the opulent gardens on the manor sipping their tea.
It is nice of Potter to care – to even think of him.  They have been meeting up casually since Potter began participating in his experimental treatment at work.  Draco would never admit it aloud, but their meetings were often the highlight of his day.  He had few friends in Britain.  Pansy was married and busy with her children and Greg spent most of his time working at his wife’s bakery.
His boyfriend takes another ragged breath.  “My skillset had always been more academic, so Severus encouraged the dark lord to make me one of his pet potioneers.  I was required to produce all sorts of nasty things for horrific purposes, and if one of my potions should fail or if I made some imaginary infraction, I was tortured.  Or worse I would be tasked with interrogations – which were also tests of my loyalty.”
“What is a PTA?”  He asks suspiciously.  Whatever it was, it sounded daunting the way Pansy said it.
had been quite the ordeal for Draco.  He was certain it had been the result of James’ resentment of him.
Dinner is warm in their bellies and the second glass of ale he had serves to make him even sleepier.  Harry brushes his teeth and washes his face perfunctorily as he prepares for bed.  Tossing his clothes from today into the laundry hamper in the loo.  Harry’s only in his pants.  He rarely sleeps with more than underwear.  He has pajamas and a robe.  But he usually only wears those when he first gets out of bed or on a lazy day.
“Auror Potter.”  Narcissa acknowledged him.  Her face tired and wane in its intensity as she stared at him.  An echo of the sneering, beautiful woman he once knew.  Fragile seeming now propped as she was against the pillows behind her.  “I apologize for having to greet you here.”
Twysley looks over to Harry.  That's his cue.  Harry steps to the podium.  “We have reason to believe Spinner is only one branch in a criminal enterprise.  If we can get him today, he may be able to lead us to the person pulling the strings.”
The usual minutia of the house settles as Draco returns to Grimmauld.  A part of Harry wants to tease Draco for working on updating their house while he heals.  It is like the man can't help himself.  Always working on something.  Whether he's sketching a room plan for Grimmauld, the manor, or some formula for work; Draco liked to keep himself occupied.
Hi folks.  Thanks for reading!  I'm 2/3rds of the way done writing this behemoth.  Writing these have provided a much needed distraction during these trying COVID times.  My work is a lot right now and these are a bit of an escape.  I hope everyone is staying safe out there.
Ron frowns.  “I know I know her.”  His friend says slowly as Harry’s eyes land on who they are talking about.
It has been over a year since his last international trip and Draco is itching to go.  He has grown used to traveling often in the last several years.  Staying in one country for so long, albeit in his homeland, is unusual for him.  Of course, he has a reason to stay now.
“About fourteen months.”  Pansy answers with a smile, looking over at her son who is flailing his arms.  “It went very quickly.”
“Ah.  Sorry.”  Harry stops him again as Malfoy raises his eyebrow at him.  “I’m either still at work or with my kids then.”
There is a silence.  Draco is brutally aware of each second that drags on as the man in front of him stares down at him.  Assessing him.  He returns the look.  Certain that should he break it he will fail some character test.  They were similar in their positions here.  Draco’s past choices resulted in wizarding society shunning him, but this man’s very being was not a choice and he was not the lesser for it.
The last he sees of Malfoy is the man getting his manacles uncuffed, chains spooling away from him at the direction of the auror beside him.  Harry is on his feet getting in the queue to leave.  Looking as best he can over the heads of the people in the crowd.  Malfoy is off to the side of his parents as they say their goodbyes.  Seeming lost as one hand rubs absently at his now freed wrist.  Shoulders hunched and expression shocked.
“You are a respected potioneer with . . . a troubled past.”  Narcissa excuses away with a wave of her hand.
Jamie never knew that.  He knew his Potter grandparents died in the war when Dad was little, but he didn’t know they were killed by the main bad guy.  Al shrinks beside him, tensing.  Jamie suspects this is the first time his brother is hearing it too.
It is a beautifully wrought silver ring with a Celtic knot pattern engraved onto its outer surface.  The inside of it has an etching of a roaring lion and a serpent posed to strike.  He can detect some of the charm work inlaid on it, but he is not entirely certain the extent of it.  The whole thing is incredibly thoughtful, and he will cherish it forever.
.  But what we did last night is largely the extent of my – well except that last bit – where you,” Here Draco gestures with his finger.  Thinking of when Potter massaged at his hole.  How much he liked that feeling.  Merlin, he is an absolute idiot.  He should never have said anything.  Potter will not want anything to do with him now.  Let alone touch him again.
“None taken.”  Harry says, tilting his head toward her in acknowledgement.  He appreciates her directness.
“No.  I’ve done all I can there.”  He responds.  The case was being tried now.  It had been a headache from the start, but that was not the issue on Harry’s mind now.
Draco closes his eyes.  Allowing that to sink in, collecting his thoughts.  He tries to think of a way to comfort his friend.  “It will be different for this child.”  He finally says in a serious tone, catching Greg’s attention.  “Even if they are magical, they are not
installed them with the hammer and nails he bought just to show Draco how muggles do it.  They start a lot of projects that way.  Him completing a menial task and the other man watching raptly like he is doing something extraordinary – sometimes taking literal notes.
Jamie stares at him.  Draco always seemed so calm and together but now he seems sad.  Or maybe a better word was regretful?  He watches Draco take his little sister’s hand in his own.  Expression conflicted.
And speaking of Potter’s body.  Draco knows Potter is fit – Circe, he has eyes for goodness sake.  However, it is quite another thing to have it pressing into him.  The reassuring weight and strength of it.  Draco is suddenly very appreciative of the auror training regime.  He can feel his own body flushing in response.  It is a bit overwhelming.  His hands wander down to Potter’s shoulder and a bicep.  Enjoying the firmness he finds there.
Unfortunately, it does not work.  Lily’s expression is crestfallen.  Hurt even.  Wide, brown eyes disappointed and mouth in a pout.  He glances pointedly at his boyfriend for support.
that, Hermione.”  Harry replies tersely.  “However, the situation was easily a level three and I was well within my rights to call them.”
Christmas was a hectic time of year for him.  Since Teddy's birth, he'd done his utmost to make every Christmas special.  This year adds Draco into the mix.  Harry has no clue what to get his boyfriend, but he knows that he wants their first Christmas together as a couple to be special.  There is a slight issue though.  Draco doesn't really celebrate Christmas.  He celebrates Yule.
“Harry.”  Draco whines sounding desperate.  Mouth opening obediently to let Harry in like he wants, laving at him in return.  Sweat and oil making their efforts smoother.
The only bad part about Teddy visiting was that meant Jamie had to sleep in Al’s room.  Teddy got his bed when he stayed over.  Technically, it was Teddy’s bed first and Jamie just took it over after he started Hogwarts but whatever.
He drank heavily in those first few years whenever he was not due at work or had some other responsibility.  Trying to feel relaxed and keep bad memories at bay.
He suspects the last decent thing his father did was adjust the wards allowing the aurors in that day at the end of May.  Of course, Lucius was already in custody by that point so who can say how pure his motivations actually were.  He wonders what it was like for his father.  Watching the place he had been born, raised, and become master of nearly destroyed.  Burning before his eyes.  A selfish part of Draco hopes it hurts his father still.
“Ridiculous conjecture.”  Whitacre complains, “We don’t have time to waste on petty gossip, Robards.  I thought this was about a real problem – not Potter’s social life.  No offense, Harry.”  She adds, not unkindly.
His eyes squeeze shut when he finally comes.  A rush of adrenaline and stars blooming behind his eyelids.  Senses deliciously overwhelmed.  He still feels floaty when he rolls dizzily off Draco onto his back, head pillowed by Draco’s trapped arm.  He turns his head to the side leaving a kiss on Draco’s inner arm.
“I did not sleep with Draco and then ask him about his experience during the war.  He was in his comfy pants.”
“I am glad you’re enjoying them.”  Draco responds, smiling lightly at his boyfriend.  He reaches over and rests his hand on Harry’s cheek, enjoying the stubble there and leaning in to kiss him.  Harry tilts his face to meet him halfway.  Lips tasting like powdered sugar.  Perhaps eating in bed was not so terrible after all?
It’s much easier when they get the crup to the loo attached to their bedroom.  No one goes in there except him and Al when they’re here.  The walls are thick enough that he doubts anyone would be able to hear the crup if she started barking.  Plus, it was no problem to smuggle in food and a bowl for water.
Albus is tearful when Draco returns to the master bath.  Frown firmly in place and brow furrowed.  He is wrapped in one of their fluffy towels.  Smelling much better but still unhappy.
Nearly two months later, when Harry lands in the floo of Draco’s flat, he is met with a very solid body pulling him through the apartment and into the master bedroom.  Draco twists and captures Harry in a kiss against the wall.  Harry is certain this is their last stop and is pleasantly surprised when Draco leads him purposefully by the hand to the bed and presses him down by the shoulders to sit.  The man moves to straddle him, wrapping arms around Harry’s shoulders.  Harry considers himself lucky.
“I have.”  Draco answers, expression suddenly serious and causing Harry concern.  “And I don’t want to attempt the Sinnsear charm.  I have been studying the possible repercussions and I fear the manor's foundation would be completely decimated or I would be trapped inside.”
“If you refuse to take it, they may move to charge you and go to trial.  My instinct is that they would.  If we go to trial, there is no guarantee you would not have to take it anyways.  If you do take it, they are only allowed to question you about the facts pertaining to this case.  Taking the potion can only help your cause if you have nothing to hide, even though the potion itself is not a 100% guarantee of truthfulness.”  She delineates, frowning.  “Draco, it is your decision.  I will support you regardless.”
“Is it the Crofton case?”  Ron asks leaning back on the lounge chair, stretching out his long legs.  He didn't work at the ministry anymore, but his input was often invaluable to Harry.  Ron’s years as an auror gave him a unique perspective in addition to his strategic mind.
Draco sighs, twisting his hands in the bed linens.  It never mattered too much if people did not like him.  Not since he became an adult.  He had had to let that go after the war with so much else.  It was for the better really.  But this is different.  It is important to him that he develop a good relationship with all his boyfriend’s children.
“I suppose not.”  Draco concurs with a nod.  “My job is all that I hoped it would be.  I’ve been allowed to pursue my interests in developing more treatments for maligning curses.”
Draco finds himself torn.  On the one hand, he wants to give the children time with their mother.  On the other hand, Lily and Albus are adamant they want to stay by him and Harry.  Albus even grabs onto his hand when he and Harry suggest leaving Ginevra to have some time with them for a couple hours.  Expression teary.
“Did you come here to complain?”  Father drawls, unimpressed.  “Or did you come here to tell me that you succeeded in your quest?”
He has never gone to school with creatures as fellow students before.  The courses he is pursuing do not necessarily
Draco’s wand is out in a flash as automatic as breathing.  James and Albus bolt behind him.  Expressions frightened.  The woman narrows her gaze on him, face contorting further if possible.  “BLOOD TRAITOR!  YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE YOUR FATE!  WORSE THAN MY BLASTED GET.  NOT WORTHY OF YOUR NAME.  NO MORE.  NO MORE OF MY HOUSE.  WHOR-”
“No.”  Harry admits honestly.  He assumed Draco could tell anyways.  He had much more training in legilimency and occlumency than Harry did.  Draco also knew him well now.
“Until dad gets back, I guess.”  He replies.  It’s something he thought a lot about last night before he fell asleep.  She can’t dig holes
No.  He cannot be that.  He is not allowed.  They might be hurt.  The boys were already mocked at school because of him.
Harry stops their kiss and swiftly scans his face as they continue to crash into one another.  Grunting in pain like it hurts to be drawn away.  Green eyes concerned and dilated.
It is his hope the ward the manor erected will be interrupted when another dark, semi-sentient magic like its own is introduced.  If he can manage to briefly suspend it, he can enter without being repelled and get to the core.  Whatever magic that has altered the core, he is reasonably certain he can charm to accept him.  The core was located under the great hall.  The very heart of the manor and the oldest section of the structure.
“Not always.”  Harry reproaches.  “I have to work at it.  I think everyone does.  From what I’ve seen of you in the last few months, you do.  We couldn’t have gotten on like we have if you didn’t.  You wouldn’t have even been working at the clinic if you didn’t want to help others – chose to.”  Harry counters, taking the few steps over and, resting his hand on Draco’s upper arm.
Harry had become an expert over the years on all available apparation points in London and the surrounding areas.  In his early twenties he was assigned to patrols in the area and occasional missions that took him throughout the boroughs.  But rarely, did he have the time to stroll leisurely between them.
I appreciate all the comments and kudos.  The world is weird and this rambling fic gives me joy.  I own nothing but plots.
“Remember I have to leave with the team early tomorrow.”  Ginny reminds gently.  Harry doubts Jamie forgot.  His son knew Gin’s quidditch schedule better than Harry did.
The children’s primary school is its own special hell.  All the parents try not to stare and look amongst each other when he passes.  Draco ignores the snippets of whispers he overhears.  He can tell it bothers Harry from the way the man's eyes narrow slightly as if his boyfriend might glare them all into submission.  Draco imagines Harry attracted a fair amount of attention before just from being who he is, but now they stop people mid-conversation.
“Do you ever see her – Narcissa?”  Harry inquires curiously.  He knows she lives in France at an old Black family property she inherited.  Draco exchanged letters with his mother weekly but he did not visit her much.
The tape measure and other instruments float around his leg taking their final, extensive evaluation.  Draco goes through his own diagnostics, wand aloft, quill taking notes on the desk.  Harry would miss even this he thought wistfully.
This, in itself, was not unusual.  Although more often than one of his fellow deputy heads was also in attendance along with one or two members of the Wizengamot.  Instead, it is the four of them.  Kingsley Shacklebolt sat behind his immaculate walnut desk and the remainder of them in his orbit.  Hermione takes a seat, her briefcase neatly placed on her lap with the quill sticking out of it.
It is also becoming obvious that Draco is shutting down.  His movements are jerkier like he is looking for an escape.  Skin still a ghostly pale.  Harry grasps Draco’s elbow, attempting to calm his boyfriend but is shaken off.  Draco’s expression is flat.  Eyes distant.
“I’m sorry, Molly."  He starts, a bit abashed.  "I shouldn’t have come today.  Ron and I are still in a row and I hoped we could get past it.”  He takes a deep breath, pushing in his chair.  Gripping the back of it.  Making his decision to comment on Ron’s earlier insinuation.
It is not a shock to listen to Lucius spin a tale painting himself as a victim at worst and an unwitting accomplice at best, but it is a shock to hear Malfoy refuse to go along with his father’s version of events during the course of his statement.  Instead, admitting his guilt.  Eyes flitting up once or twice to glance at his judges before falling back to the floor.  Voice halting and clearly unused to speaking anymore.
There is no one in the archway and then something alerts him, and he notes Narcissa standing there.  Still and pale.  Eyes roving over the people gathered.  Landing on Andromeda.  The children don't know the significance of this moment.  Harry knows Teddy has some idea.  That his grandmother refused letter after letter for years from one of their last living relatives.
Harry watches Ron arrive, stomping his feet on the rug and rubbing his hands together to warm them.  Cheeks red from the cold.  It's a cold day.  Harry, himself, is sporting the cane Ron had made him today.  Leg aching in protest at the chill.  Ron spots him and comes over, shrugging out of his coat and sitting down across from him.
Harry nods, “Older than that even.”  He replies.  Al looks appropriately awed by that statement.  The idea of being that old totally alien to him.  For Al, his grandparents were the oldest people he knew though Arthur was scarcely seventy.
“I would love nothing more, Draco.”  Harry reassures running his fingers once again through the ends of Draco’s hair.  “I’m all yours.”
Hermione lifts the silencing spell.  Draco waits, facing the inquisitors expectantly.  Harry can see how upset Draco is right now by the way he holds himself, but he doubts very much the council can tell the degree to which Draco is affected.  They may guess at some embarrassment given the receding flush on the man’s face.  However, Draco continues to project polite indifference despite that hurdle.
He looks at his companion sharply then.  Trying to discern motive.  Malfoy looks back at him hesitantly, waiting.  His impression is that Malfoy truly wants to know like they’re friends or something
The whole thing cannot last longer than ten seconds, but when Potter breaks the kiss their faces remain close.
“What happens when you refuse an arranged marriage?"  He inquired, bemused by the whole idea.  "Do you lose your membership to the Sacred Twenty-eight or something?”
Harry can’t quite figure out what happens then.  It seems to him Draco goes from being firmly in his arms to a melding of something fluid and rapidly changing in size.  Maybe two seconds pass as he tears the blanket off them to get a better look at what’s happening.
His boyfriend gives him a disparaging look, but the barely there smile indicates exasperated amusement.  “You are a hoarder, Harry.  The first step is acceptance.  The second step is allowing me to remove the waste.  Most of the furniture in the attic is rubbish that you refuse to be rid of.”
It is precisely as it was when he was last there.  Air oppressive.  The gloom of the room is barely touched by the lit standing candelabras.  High, arched ceilings gloomy as if darkened by storm clouds like the weather charm in the Great Hall at Hogwarts.  The long table made of black marble with silver veins running through it placed grandly in the middle.  Highbacked, elegant chairs on each side.  The remainder of the large hall an empty, eerie space with bloodstains forever inked into the dark wooden planks where Professor Burbage was consumed by Nagini.  The sound of bones crunching reverberates through the room when he takes a step, bringing him to a halt.
“Circe, Harry, shut up!”  Draco retorts with a roll of his eyes, but the smile he has on thrills Harry to no end.
“It’s hard to believe your mother never made you anything.  She was always sending you sweets when we were boys.”  Harry remarks.  The eagle owl the Malfoys had always meant chocolates when it swooped into the Great Hall.
“That’s unfair.”  Potter replies unconcerned, pocketing his wand.  Draco wonders what he expected to find to have his wand out.  The man is still scanning the area like someone may jump out at them.  “I’ll have you know I’m here on official business.”
Draco does not dislike the silence, but it is somber.  He feels like he has disappointed her.  His friend.  “What,” He eventually ventures, swallowing once dryly.  Hesitant.  “What could we have instead?”
“I can understand that.”  Draco sympathizes.  “We have to be who we are.  My mother wanted me to marry my best friend and pretend to be straight and live in the manor with her.”
Harry is the incredible lover.  Draco will only ever admit it to him during the act.  Draco’s only saving grace is he does not make a lot of sense when the man has Draco's cock in his mouth and his fingers inside Draco.  Harry keeps his head propped against a small heap of their clothes, sucking Draco in further as his fingers explore.
“Harry.  Merlin, Draco, call me Harry now at least.”  He grumbles, knowing that will make Draco laugh.  Can feel it start from the way his boyfriend slightly shakes above him.  The sound of it lovely.  Harry squeezes Draco’s side in response.
Ron shifts in his seat again.  Glancing around the pub as if someone might be trying to overhear.  In fairness, that was always a distinct possibility, although Harry’s instincts were telling him that wasn't the case now.  The other patrons, scattered as they were, seemed occupied with their own tables.
When they were first seeing each other he often felt uncertain about Harry’s attention.  Then, he had doubted his place at Harry’s side and if he ought to accept his boyfriend’s affection.  If he deserved it.
Draco turns casually toward him, walking the few steps separating them until they are inches apart.  The light from the sconces giving Draco’s hair and skin a golden sheen.  Each step sending a jolt of anticipation through Harry, settling somewhere in his lower belly.  Hyperaware of the small distance between them.
should be brought to light now.  Instead he closes the space between them and kisses Draco as passionately as possible.
Draco and Harry exchange a glance at that.  Harry raising his eyebrows at Draco.  It was not the worst reaction that could happen.  James could have dramatically mimed stabbing himself in the heart or ignored Draco entirely.  He tended to vacillate between dramatic and detached.  Draco rather thought the boy was well prepared for his adolescent years.
“But what is he doing?"  Harry thinks aloud.  "He completely disappears off the Marauder’s Map.  How does he do that?”
Draco flushes.  Merlin, he hated when Harry did that.  He thought it so funny to make Draco blush.  “You know what I mean, Potter.”  He snaps, frustrated in his uncertainty.
Astoria stuck around for a bit.  Staying for a few days before relocating to her sister’s.  His sprogs like Astoria.  Her smaller stature, colorful dress, and upbeat attitude draws them to her.  It seems like she likes kids too.
The man gives him an incredulous look.  “I’ve been in Azkaban since I was seventeen, Potter.  The closest thing I had to a romantic relationship was a messy snog session with Pansy at the beginning of sixth year, and I have to say, it was not exactly memorable.”  Draco drawls.
“A complaint was lodged against the department this morning.  Claiming one of our top aurors has been compromised.”
“Lily.”  Dad reprimands lightly, tone trying to put her off.  Jamie guesses it's because Lily is asking about
“Did I get some food on my face?”  Potter questions expression growing concerned and reaching up to where Draco’s hand was.
His boyfriend turns sharply toward him.  Expression uneasy like he’s fighting with himself to remain unaffected and failing.  “It wasn’t during the war, but it was because of it.”  The man grits out frowning like there is a bad taste in his mouth.
where they stay.  But Dad wanted them in the two closest rooms right next to the ginormous one him and Draco have.
“Draco tried to smother his best instincts for a long time, but then - when it would benefit him most - he stopped.”  Luna explains in her far off daydreamy voice, expression thoughtful.  “I believe he must have discovered something irrevocably good within him.  I don’t know what.  He was punished for it – whatever it was – by the other death eaters.  Everyone knew he was on thin ice, and despite that, while I was a prisoner here, he used to smuggle us extra food and water.  Once he brought old Mr. Olivander medicine.  I was sad to hear they kept him in Azkaban before his trial finished.  I feared he might be killed there.  That’s why the memories I submitted to the ministry included those times Draco helped us – did you ever see them?”
His hands are scrapped and bloody, but he cannot feel them.  Bits of broken glass embedded in his hand from where he removed the boy’s broken glasses.  Wand tightly gripped despite the pain of it as he stands stiffly.
“I wanted to ask you . . .”  Greg starts, hesitant and fidgeting with the ear of his cup.  “You’re smarter than me.  Always have been.  You know all about potions and things.  Is there a way to make
“Mmmhmm,” Draco hums his agreement, “Love.”  He returns sleepily as Harry waves a hand to clean them and summoning their quilt from where it was bunched up at the end of the bed.  Covering them.  Leaving him warm all over and happy.
His friend glares at Draco.  Harry is impressed that Draco holds his ground and keeps his hand in Harry’s.  He knows it is not easy to face all of Ron’s ire.  Ron could be imposing when he wanted.  “What did you
They arrive outside the splintered entryway.  Draco plugs his ears as Harry uncovers the portrait and Walburga begins to howl in rage.  Yelling obscenities at Harry.  His boyfriend summons a whip-like stream of light from the tip of his wand that coils around the portrait.
They stow Maud back in the loo, hastily change, and go to breakfast before Draco comes to check on them.  The smell of bacon enticing them to the table.  Nothing seems out of the ordinary when they arrive.  Mrs. Malfoy, Draco, and Lily are already there.  Dressed and ready for the day like usual.  One of the house elves Mrs. Malfoy brought with her is serving them.  Pitcher of pumpkin juice floating around the table filling glasses and toast buttering itself.  He and Al slide into their seats as Draco dismisses the elf and helps Lily fix the cloth napkin tucked into his sister’s collar.
It is too quick.  They’ve been apart more often than not in the last several days.  When they are together work on the manor, their jobs, or his children have kept them occupied.  Always something.
“Mum took us to Uncle Fred’s grave.”  Al adds conversationally, swinging himself slightly around the post by his gloved hand.  “We gave him lots of wheezes Uncle George made.  There were no ghosts their either.”
“What made you stay?”  Draco questions interested.  He knew some of Potter’s experience living there.  It sounded little like the Black ancestral home his mother mentioned visiting throughout her childhood.  The Grimmauld Place in his mother’s stories was an opulent wizarding home, filled with all manner of dark objects and wizards.
Father hums sounding disinterested.  Tapping his fingers in a pattern on the table and glancing about the unadorned room.  “Why did you come here really, Draco?  After all these years?  I was under the impression that you wanted
The interloping boys crosses his arms looking smug.  “That Malfoy bloke your dad is with is a death eater, Potter.  My mum and dad say he’s a real piece of shite.  They say your dad is always trying to save people but now he’s gone too far.”
“Yes.”  Harry says, frustrated, kicking out his right leg.  He was volunteering for this after all.  He could leave any time and not deal with Malfoy’s accusations.  Although, what Malfoy said about the DMLE employees coming in for appointments did not ring quite right.  It would not be the first time someone at the DMLE had toed the line into auror territory.  He may have to look into that.  “Please, if it will put you off this.”
“We’re not having any luck.”  Jamie bemoans sitting down beside the small crater and toeing absently at the dirt at the bottom.
He isn’t very good at it.  Malfoy will definitely need a proper cut at some point, but he is able to take several inches off so that it rests, curling slightly at the man’s shoulders.  He feels odd doing this for him.  Vulnerable in a weird way.  Especially when Malfoy’s lips thin and the man closes his eyes when Harry takes his wand out to make the cuts.  He cannot deny though, the shorter hair looks much healthier.  Softer and clean from the shower as he takes the comb from Malfoy and tries to make the ends even-ish.
“I just haven’t gotten around to it.”  Harry argues, feeling his excuse is weaker than he would like.
“I’m very used to being alone.”  Draco adds after a period of quiet.  “I was alone most of the time in Azkaban – which was preferable, believe me – but it is nice to have a friend.  Even if it's you, Potter.  It’s been a while.”
“Damn.”  He grouses, setting himself to what order he can.  He shrugs off his uniform.  It’s a loss for now and he doesn’t really want to wear it anymore today.
“I – I thought once, I might get my potions mastery.”  He admits in a whisper.  Unnerved that the world did not fall apart for voicing his wish.  “That it would be allowed.”  He adds.
“You will tell them how you acted to save Hogwarts.  How you attempted to save Potter from the Fiendfyre.  How you turned from the dark lord in the end.”  Father intoned.  He had regained some strength during his few months in Azkaban by then.  It turned out the dark lord was worse than the dementors.
Harry looks at her mildly.  “Oh?”  He says, measuring her reaction.  Draco would have told him if he had shared about their dating with Pansy.  He wonders what her point is.
He knows Draco didn’t mean it to sound defeatist or sad.  Quite the opposite.  But Harry can’t help but feel a bit badly.  “What sort of person would you like though?”  He asks curiosity stirred now.
“That’s not fair, mate.  I could deal with a friendship.  Maybe.  That is the sort of person you are.  I’ve never known you to turn your back on someone.  Ever.  But this?!  This is mad!”
“My job is to learn all I can about different medicinal items and create new potions to help people if they’re sick or hurt.”  Draco explains.  “It can be challenging – like a puzzle.”  He ends with a look toward Al.
His sister is noticeably warmer to Draco for the rest of dinner even going so far as to offer him the purple crayon she starts doodling with on her placemat.  Draco haltingly accepts it before she pats his hand expectantly a minute later and asks for it back.  She and Al pepper Draco with questions throughout – not letting eating get in their way.
Draco gapes apparently still bewildered and upset.  “Not – well, not just that – but my form the . . .  phoenix.”
Harry could stupefy these three right now.  The unkind part of him irritated that his time with his boyfriend has been interrupted.  Draco’s expression is disappointed too for a half second, and then replaced with the mask of mildly interested politeness.  Harry calls this look ‘the Narcissa’.
The solicitor he was assigned was able to convince the council to hear his piece.  Draco does not remember all of it.  Once he started, he wanted it all out.  The courtroom was deathly silent after the initial din.  Draco’s voice was as raw as his wrists at the end of it.  Breaking and creaking from the disuse.  He never bothered to look at the crowd in the court that day.  The jeers when he entered the domed courtroom were not encouraging.  The few times he glanced up was to gaze defeatedly at the new Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt and the interim head of the DMLE.
“Ah.”  The house elf voices hesitantly, expression suddenly apologetic and shifting from foot to foot in obvious discomfort.
Eventually Harry moves forward, helping Draco lay back on the soft bed linens as his boyfriend settles between his thighs.  Watches as Harry’s dark hair falls forward and he tucks it behind the man’s ear.  Resting his hand at the nape of Harry’s neck and playing with the hair there.
It is actually quite nice.  Harry can even admit that after the first thirty minutes of the adults getting past the initial awkward mingling.  He is particularly proud of Hermione who is doing her best to engage Pansy politely.  He suspects Olta serving alcoholic beverages before dinner helps smooth things along.
Harry glances down at his hands, frowning to himself.  It is better that it all comes out.  Ginny knows now.  The family should be aware too.  He is with Draco.  That is not going to change any time soon – never if he has his way.
There is a poignant silence.  Draco silently counts his breathing to keep himself steady where he stands.  Watching his father’s white-knuckled fists shake on the surface of the table.  Chains still clattering and echoing around the room.
It seems like as a couple, they spend more time with Harry’s friends.  Draco assumes this is mostly to do with geography and the fact Weasley and Hermione have children the same age and are members of Harry’s family.
There is a screech from the girls which causes the adults to look over as one.  They seem to have caught the weebler whoosh and are moving for their turn to throw.  Lily is hopping up and down beside Rosie and Gabby.  Who appear to be in strategic discussion, glancing surreptitiously over to the boys.  Al is gesturing to his brother and cousin to huddle.  Evidently each team was planning their next move.  Their seriousness is amusing to him.  He looks over to Ron who seems to be thinking along the same lines.
“That’s what crups do.”  Luna informs them.  “They want to be with us.  They possess a great deal of loyalty toward wizarding people who take care of them.”
This is a test.  He knows it is a test.  Potter will not keep him around if the children do not accept him.  It is with great relief that James finally speaks to him if only to go on about quidditch and his mother.  The first subject Draco can speak to with some authority.  As for the boy’s mother, he is less certain.  Draco tentatively calls the first meeting a success at the end of dinner.  Lily even spontaneously takes his hand.  Her little one a bit greasy from dinner, big brown eyes staring up at him, curious as they waited for the Potter boys to catch up with them.
The third Sunday of the month was traditionally Weasley family brunch day.  Harry tried to bring his children to every single one.  If there was one thing he loved better than Molly Weasley’s homemade waffles it was her omelets.  The fluffy perfection of folded egg with every ingredient one could want tucked inside.  It was the food his childhood dreams were made of.  Molly showed her love through cooking and Harry felt very loved.
“You scared the life out of me, you know.”  Harry tells him sternly as if Draco is one of his misbehaving children.  “When they lifted you out of there, I thought you were dead.”
Harry sighs.  That is the question he's wrestled with more than any other for some time.  “It is.”  He agrees.  Regardless of what happens, he liked having Draco just to himself, even if it is unrealistic.  “Hermione?”
“You and the children would call them ‘dippins’.”  Draco drawls in reply, as he peruses the menu.  Eyebrow raised, but expression amused.
Harry nods to Draco to go on and turns to face his friend.  Hermione looks cross.  Hands on her hips as she frowns up at her husband.
“Oh?”  Draco voices.  His own voice going lower in pitch.  How was it this man could take all his words?
Harry puts an arm around Draco’s waist as they talk.  Keeping an ear in on the conversation and taking in the place.  The tall ceilings.  People milling about.  The golden lights and partitions separating groups off to the side getting bottle service.  He could even see a good bit of the stage above the dance floor from their position by the bar.
Moving to stand to his full height from his seat behind the desk, perhaps an inch or so taller than Harry, is Draco Malfoy.
She had loved him once – in her way.  Or perhaps, more accurately, his aunt had been proud he was born pureblooded and male.  Another link in the Malfoy and Black family lines.  There are pictures of her holding him.  His small, chubby hands pulling at her loose, black curls.  She still appeared human in those photographs.  Adoring even.
He turns his head to look at Draco, expression pleased.  “You did – you did a good job.”  Harry tells him, patting him clumsily on the shoulder with his freed arm.
Dad was the main problem.  He and Al had begged for a pet of their own for years.  Every Christmas.  Every birthday.  Nothing too big.  A cuddly puffskein would have done.  Mum would’ve gotten them one - he’s sure of it - but she didn’t have them most of the time.  It was so unfair.  Plus, dad wasn’t even here right now which further complicated things.  Jamie is certain if they show Draco the crup first the man would refuse them out of hand.  Or Bixby would find the crup and send her away.
In the ensuing years of improved treatments, he was able to largely discontinue use of the cane.  Unfortunately, it had become necessary to replace important things like his femur every other year or so once the bone and surrounding tissues became too weak.  That, along with a small vial of his prescribed potion every morning delaying the next inevitable bone transfiguration procedure, allowed him the use of his leg.  Mostly.  The blood curse that was imbedded in the explosion that killed two other aurors - including one of his own sergeants who’d been a trainee of his - kept trying to tear Harry’s limb apart where the protego he had cast had failed to protect him.
It is not like he has never been thrown up on before, but typically more alcohol was involved.  He removes the offending shirt, tossing it in the hamper and makes his way to the bathroom to clean the remaining mess off him.
His children were his priority first along with his responsibility to make a safer more just world for them.  The idea of adding someone else into that mix – exposing them to the intense scrutiny of his friends or the media was daunting.  And he had no idea how his children would react to him bringing round another person to take his attention away from them.
The great stag having shoved off the largest and standing to block the water flowing in.  Shouts from the others reach him as he pulls the boy out.  Cradling Albus’ upper half and desperately trying not to jostle him as he carries him to the creek’s edge.  Albus limp and cold in his arms.  Nothing like the energetic, inquisitive boy he knows Albus Potter to be.
“You have it.”  Draco offers with a sincerity that pierces.  Like it wasn't something hard earned and treasured.
“I want you to stay the night.”  Potter tells him earnestly, peering at him with deep green eyes.  Hopeful.  “That is, if you want – if you’re comfortable.”
Draco’s other arm slowly moves to the lip of the tub, turning himself so he can unfold his legs, facing Harry.  It's not the right time.  Harry understands this logically, but Draco looks attractive rumpled as he is in his underthings.  White blonde hair sticking out in all directions, short as it is.  He likes Draco messy; he thinks.  Looking Draco up and down from the soles of his long feet to the tips of his hair.
.  Where does he get these things?”  Draco ponders aloud, shaking his head.  Honestly, he did not understand half the things James said slangily.
Ginevra is hosting Lily’s party at the Burrow.  Lily practically vibrates with excitement as their household, including the children’s beloved crup, step through the main fireplace at Grimmauld to floo to their destination.  Mrs. Weasley is there to greet them as they step out.  Ready to embrace the birthday girl.
Astoria gives him a sad smile and pats his hand.  “He is absolutely gone on you, darling.  You should have seen the way he looked at you.  It was like a drowning man being given gillyweed the moment he laid eyes on you last night.”
It is the mess he remembers it to be.  Dented and torn at the front, tire deflated.  Bits of bolts and metal on the ground.  Side car only partially attached.  The back remains largely intact as it was back then, but it did appear a bit rusty now.  The shed did leak from time to time so that was not terribly unexpected.
He hated it.  All of it.  But mostly he had hated himself – that he was too much of a coward to run away.  Afraid of what would happen to his parents if he did – particularly his mother.  The same woman who begged him to leave her but would not leave her husband.  The manor encapsulated all of it for him.
They are two sappy men.  He likes when he can get Draco to verbalize his feelings.  There is a sense of victory for him that accompanies it.
“I do apologize.”  He starts, turning back to his companion, and pulling short at the headmistress chuckling.  A soft, friendly sound.  Professor Minerva McGonagall is honest to Merlin laughing at him as she attempts to conceal it with a hand.
“He’s young, Draco.  I bet he will come around to you.”  Pansy advises.  “After all, he may still be adjusting to his father dating.”
Harry’s definitely feeling relaxed.  Posture open and smile genuine.  On anyone else it would seem contrived, but on Harry it is the most natural thing.  If their eyes catch more than once during their soiree and Draco gets a bit distracted . . . well, he supposes he can blame that on the wine and congratulations that leave him buoyant and not at all because of their recent reconciliation.  Still, he must shake his head at himself.  He is a grown man for Circe’s sake.
“Oh, Molly.”  Harry voices, heart twisting and taking the few steps toward her.  “Molly – no.  No.”  He gently consoles.  He had no idea she was still holding on to that hope.  It'd been years.
“That’s what I want someday.”  Potter comments as they watch them meander away.  “Someone to grow old with and bicker about the tile in the kitchen.”
“I wish I had your optimism – or any optimism.”  He replies.  It is an intoxicating madness.  Whatever this is.  He never experienced anything like it.  Swinging from sureness to uncertainty in the span of minutes.  Back and forth.  It made him dizzy.
“Bah!”  He voices once, looking pleadingly over to his parents clearly hoping they can resolve the issue.
“He was flyin’ with us, but he left to go after Jamie after all that yelling.”  The boy responds.  “He was mad at Jamie for sayin’ that stuff.”
His boyfriend pulls back so they can look at each other.  Harry raising his eyebrow, indicating Draco should continue.
The man stops suddenly, wand dropping to his side, eyes serious along with a slight frown.  Malfoy again shares a look with Harry.  It seems more important this time more discerning.  “You still have shards from the cursed Mycenaean artefact in your leg from the explosion, correct?”
“Sweet Merlin, you are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen!”  Seamus shouts in his Irish brogue, speaking to Simone and kissing her proffered hand.  “How have I never met you?”
“We should name her.”  Jamie suggests.  They’ll have to let them keep her then.  “What d’you reckon?  How ‘bout Daisy?  Or Clover?”
“That I would go in alone - yes.”  Draco argues back, but it lacks much heat.  He is too weak, and it is painful to speak.  Pansy ducks out of sight and returns a moment later with a glass, bending the straw in it so Draco can take a drink.
Malfoy’s ears go pink at Harry’s outburst but he continues in the same vein.  “It’s a medical condition, Potter, and not an uncommon one when it comes to injuries like yours.  Nothing to be ashamed about.”
“Of what?”  He voices, confused, tilting his head toward her where they sit on the stone bench tucked into the corner of the Greengrass’ sprawling garden.  A perfect miniature of what used to be on the Malfoy estate.
“You’re such an arse.”  Draco complains, attempting to push Harry off of him in his faux outrage.  Harry sees right through him.  Smirking.
Draco honest to god snorts at that, making a pfft sound.  “Baby factory.”  He repeats, laughing to himself.  Harry rolls his eyes.  The two of them were slap-happy now.  Harry has his arm around Draco.  Nursing his glass of water.  It was important to hydrate after drinking.
Everyone knew.  At least, it felt like the entirety of the British wizarding world did.  The announcement that they filed jointly for divorce had been splashed all over the news for months.  Speculation abounded about the reason why.  He overheard every other day about the various affairs he and Ginny were supposedly having.  People approached him on the street about it.  Even when he went on walks with his kids.  Lily in the pram and the boys at his side.  Their expressions confused and upset.  Harry had had to file an injunction on the paparazzi then.
He had overheard Malfoy’s probation officer, Auror Bates, complain loudly that Malfoy had managed to avoid an Azkaban sentence and was being allowed to flee the country under the guise of further schooling.  Harry had thought at the time Malfoy hadn’t avoided all that much considering he was held in Azkaban for months along with his father awaiting trial.  The dementors had not even been removed by then.  Malfoy was given probation and his father sentenced to Azkaban.  Left with little money due to Lucius’ frozen assets and Malfoy and his mother paying reparations out of what they retained from her vault, the Malfoys were not living a comfortable existence any more.
“Harsh.”  Harry says, then lowers his voice.  “You look stunning tonight.  That would only help your cause I think.”  Draco’s ears go pink.  He is already a bit red in the face from drinking, but Harry can tell he is flustered by the compliment.  It will never stop astonishing him how Draco reacts to praise these days.
“No, you’re not.”  Al criticizes while trying to keep the excitable crup in his arms.  Maud squirms and energetically wags her forked tail, clearly trying to escape Al’s grip as she paws at the boy.
Thank Merlin he was knocked out then.  Albeit by a hasty charm from a very stressed looking healer.  He woke up two days later in a cold sweat with what felt like a hairball in his throat and the prickling sensation of pins and needles from the chest down.  He remembers looking tiredly to the side, head heavy, to see Ginny sitting beside his hospital bed.
“Yeah?”  He prompts, muscles tensing as he tries to hold himself still.  Senses split between watching his boyfriend stroke himself and the feeling of his own cock hard and aching.  The expression on Draco’s face is dazed.  He suspects his is the same.  Loopy on the sexual tension in the room.  Entranced.  “You want me, sweetheart?”
“We really appreciate you two looking after the kids while we’re gone.  If they’re any trouble - please call their mother.”  Harry advises with a chuckle, giving Weasley a one-armed hug in farewell.
They have been dating for some time now in that nebulous way where they both have admitted they are attracted to each other and wondering what will happen next.  When Potter’s day allows or the children are with their mother or maternal relatives, they have often found themselves together even if just for a short time.  During their time together, they talk about everything and nothing so long as it is not about the war.  Mocking Potter’s taste in quidditch teams and Potter teasing him about his ignorance about muggle life.  Which is ridiculous.  Draco has learned much more about muggle culture in the intervening years.  He has become a frequent visitor of the muggle portion of the Louvre.  But apparently that has ‘got little to nothing to do with muggle life here’.
He passes portrait after portrait of long-dead Malfoys as he walks to the east wing where his family’s bedrooms are.  Sconces lighting the way.  The paintings’ occupants turn their noses up at him or outright walking out of their frames to parts unknown as he goes by.  They hated him, but they knew better now than to shout out their criticisms.  None of them wanted to be confined to the dungeons.
“Water, please.”  He requests, pushing himself into a sitting position.  Draco’s quick to do so, handing him a glass that he downs.
“You know very well I am.  I made all the tea cozies in this house.”  Draco responds in a put-upon tone as he plates their breakfast.  “I’m making you a blanket right now you berk.”
It was a good night.  Great even.  Every part of it.  Despite the bits with Pansy.  Draco hums one of the songs that was on repeat tonight as they get to the apparition point.  Harry inhales the lovely smell of cinnamon that permeated the club and Draco’s own scent as his boyfriend side-alongs them back to Grimmauld.
Draco recounts his first foray back into the ministry since his return to Britain.  How a complaint was filed that he was tampering with Harry’s cases.  They end up sat in the nook of his kitchen where he keeps a table and chairs.  Olta in and out with coffee and pastries for them.  Aaron in his lap, shaking a rattle every few seconds that Pansy produced from her purse.
“Yes.”  He asserts.  Observing her and everyone else’s reactions to his statement.  “We’ve been dating for some time.”
“I am sorry if it's caused you any trouble.”  Draco apologizes.  He feels badly her name has been drawn in again.  She has only met Harry the once after all.
Harry does some auroring, tries to go on a date, and dislikes people writing articles about him and Draco.
“No.”  Harry reassures. “Just be yourself.  He likes you fine.  If he didn’t, we’d know.”  Draco imagines Harry would know best.  He does not press it further, and Harry waves his hand, turning off the bedroom lights.
“You do three fingers.”  Draco points out a tad affronted.  Harry only needed three fingers at most when they did this.  Often managing with two.  His boyfriend was not that massive, maybe a little wider than Draco but not by much and they were basically the same length.  “I can do it.”  He asserts.
“How is the move in going?”  Hermione asks, propping her socked feet on her footstool and sipping at her spiked cup of cider.
“You have to earn it.”  He counters instantly.  Are they really on a first name basis yet?  This is Potter after all.
His boyfriend makes an aggravated noise and exits the room.  He and Ginevra watch Harry go and share a look themselves.  She shrugs, packing her papers back into her carrier bag.  Draco sighs.  It could take Harry a while to shake a bad mood and Draco had not seen him this annoyed in some time.
“I know this is a lot.”  Harry cuts in, tone firm.  “I’m not unsympathetic to how much of a shock this is, but Draco and I
Draco was glad.  Gleeful even when he heard the news.  Laughed hysterically in his cell for what felt like hours.  He felt mad then.  Just as he would calm another wave of hysterics would hit him.  Again and again.  His cheeks had hurt from all the grinning he did.  The guards mocked him, spat on him, but what did he care?  His mother was out of there.  The dark lord would never hurt her again.
“No.”  Harry draws the word out teasingly, pulling Draco in closer from where his arm is wrapped around his boyfriend's shoulders.  They’re lying in bed at his boyfriend’s flat.  Naked and tangled together still which makes Harry ache from the intimacy of it.  “How could I ever tease you?”  He jokes pressing a light kiss to the bridge of his boyfriend’s nose.
“Indeed.”  Mrs. Malfoy comments dryly, turning then to the house elf serving them.  “Dot, please be a dear, and summon Draco.  His guests are arriving, and I believe this crup business would be of interest to him.”
“I suppose.”  Ron acknowledges with a shrug.  “But it’s still his boyfriend asking – not some ministry official.  Harry was trying to protect him.”
“No,” He demurs with a shake of his head.  “I wasn’t thinking.”  He really didn’t.  Stupidly enough.  Merlin, if anyone in the department knew he’d got caught off guard.
Lily reaches over and pats Harry’s cheek.  Patronizing him.  He blows a raspberry on it making her laugh.  Harry grins at Lily and Draco, both of whom are smiling.  Then accidentally catches Molly’s look: knowing and pleased.
“What do you want, Draco?”  Potter asks, reaching over to put his arm around Draco’s shoulders.  Momentarily surprising him.  “What kind of couple do you want to be?”
There will be an audit on all Harry’s recent cases.  He knows this.  It is precisely what he would do in Robards’ position.  Harry cannot count how many audits he has been through at this point.  This was a semi-regular part of the job especially the higher in the department an auror rose.  In fact, he was one of the aurors who wrote the policy calling for it in these situations.  Accountability was a primary goal for their department following the war.  Besides, he knew without a doubt there was no kernel of truth in the complaint.  He hopes this can be put to bed easily.
“I didn’t do anything.  Jamie’s a liar!”  Al flails.  Which is completely unfair.  Al doesn’t know anything.  Jamie would know if he knew.  Besides, out of the three of them, Al got in trouble the least even
is news to Harry.  “Fake boyfriend?”  He repeats.  He had been under the impression the two had seriously dated.  Albeit with Draco closeted as he was.  Then, of course, there was that rumor in sixth year that they had ended their relationship because Lucius thought Pansy wasn't good enough for his son.
“You know I cannot stand pity.”  Draco replies icily, lip curling.  “You had fewer choices than I did.  I’m sorry for what
“I'm . . . sorry, Malfoy.”  Ron apologizes, mouth strained as he says the words.  “I may not like you, but all this was uncalled for.  I did not claim that you obstructed any of Harry’s cases in any way.”
Draco turns away slightly, laying so that he is facing the bedroom ceiling though still tucked into Harry’s side.  His boyfriend isn’t ignoring him.  He can read Draco well enough now to know the man is thinking.  Harry shifts his head to rest against his boyfriend’s shoulder.
Jamie sighs.  Draco fixed it up so there’s no more stains on the walls and the furniture all matches with no scratches.  Draco is even making them eat dinner in there today too because
“Love you.”  He murmurs to his boyfriend feeling sated and content.  Wanting Draco to know how much he cares.  How much he adores him.  Body humming in pleasure from the top of his head to the tips of his toes.
“I’m serious.” He responds, sitting up straighter in bed, and turning toward his boyfriend.  Reaching out to rest his hand on Draco’s forearm.  “I’d like to know.”
The owl drops an official looking envelope to the floor the second he opens the window.  Draco goes to take it but freezes when he sees the seal.  It is from the Minister of Magic.  There is movement from the bed as Harry swings his legs over the side of it and reaches out a hand summoning the envelope to him.  Draco watches him open it and read, expression falling.  Harry folds it shut and the letter immediately disintegrates, falling to the floor in ashes as if in a scorching fire.
to get a VIP invite.  There is a line around the building to get in and he can hear the music before they even get to the entrance.
“No.”  Al answers after a moment of scanning around.  “The holes seem bigger than what gnomes would do, Jamie.  You reckon it’s a niffler?”
“Only if you’d be my only thorn in my side, honeybunch.”  Potter needles.  Smirking at him.  The metaphor is a bit taxing, but Draco believes he sees Potter’s point.
Potter grins in response, relaxing his hold on Draco to stretch, joints popping.  Then sighing contentedly.  Draco watches him scratch his stomach unselfconsciously.  “Glad you stayed anyways.”  The man tells him.
Lucius squints at him.  “You have a question.”  Father remarks with surety, reminding Draco uncomfortably of his own approach in a recent conversation with James when the boy misbehaved.  “Do you need advice?  I’m afraid my knowledge of current events is rather limited but perhaps something else?”
“I want to start bringing Draco around the kids.”  He tells her.  “That’s why I’m bringing this all up now.”
Astoria looks sadly up at him.  Eyes shining.  Draco likes her.  Not the way he should.  The way his parents would prefer, but he does care about her.  It is a start at the least.  She is very slight, pale with thin brown hair framing her delicate face.  He has the distinct sense a strong gust of wind would knock her over.  Her health had always been poorly.  A family curse or some such.  Astoria was a compromise for his parents.  There were few pureblood parents who wanted to arrange marriages between their daughters and him.  The war permanently stained his family’s reputation.  He was either a social pariah or a useless weakling depending on the pureblood circle his name was circulated in.
“It’s not stupid.”  Harry replies.  Thinking back to the terrified teenager he discovered crying in the boy’s bathroom all those years ago.  Pale and scared.
“Hi.” Jamie says shortly sitting down in his chair.  Al is chattering about school and drawing with crayons on the paper placemat, glasses askew.  The man – Draco – is nodding along, trying to follow, turning a bit to acknowledge them too with a nod and a slight smile.  Once Al gets going it’s hard to get him to stop talking.  Jamie knew that better than anyone since they shared a bedroom whenever Teddy stayed over and Al talks in his sleep.  Lily walks around to Dad and buries her face in his side, hiding it from the stranger.  She didn't like talking to new people.  Mum called her ‘slow to warm.’
“I see that.”  Harry says, bending down in front of the baby.  “Hello, Aaron.”  His boyfriend singsongs to the baby, wiggling his fingers at him and pulling a face.  Draco pulls his own.  Thank goodness, none of Harry’s children are infants.  He doubts he would have the patience for them.
“Well, count me out of it.”  Ron responds to his sister-in-law, giving Harry a hard look.  “I am too well aware of what Malfoy is like and what he is capable of doing.  Nothing he does can make up for those things.”
“You just told us.”  Jamie responds with exasperation, slapping a palm to his forehead, and beginning to sense their plans were doomed.
“No, but we can discuss that later.”  He allows.  “For now, it is time for you to sleep so you can heal fully.”
“A magazine, sir.”  Doge answers immediately, posture at attention where he sits at his desk next to the offending rag.
“I want them to see her.  They miss her so much.”  Harry voices quietly as he climbs in beside him, removing his glasses.
There’s a quiet after that.  Jamie thinks he feels the same about Draco.  He knows more now.  It was usually better to know more.
The children drag Draco in by the hands.  Jamie follows for a bit but veers off from where the small group went, headed to the boys’ bedroom.  Harry sighs.  He knows Jamie is allowed several contraband items here that he is not at Grimmauld.  But that was Ginny’s business.
He draws back.  Faltering at the sting from the words.  The anger in James’ eyes as he glares is cutting and hurts more than he thought possible.
“Potter,” Malfoy starts slowly, eyes lowering to Harry’s chart, “I know this may be pointless to ask, but are you
Pansy merely huffs.  Handing him her baby like a guest at a party absently offering their host a bottle of wine as they enter.  Walking primly past him into the flat.  Draco is impressed by how put together she seems.  Particularly since he has a better understanding of the maintenance of children now.  Having been around Harry’s children for the last few months.  Pansy’s make up is impeccable, her clothing chic and comfortable in appearance.  She is a fuller figured woman now than at the end of their Hogwarts years.  Draco rather thought she was more fetching this way.
Harry snorts.  “We weren’t obsessed.”  More like could not stand one another.  They were total opposites in every way and set on a track to clash.
He feels decidedly underdressed in comparison with his bare feet, plaid pajama pants and worn tee.  It is late, nearly midnight.  He half expected her to drop them at his door at the crack of dawn tomorrow.  It would not be the first time.  Ginny’s crooked grin is welcome though after she gently shuts Jamie’s bedroom door.
“Why do you do it, Harry?”  Draco asks after a moment, voice rough.  Grey eyes considering.  “Don’t get me wrong, I love being with you - I don’t have the strength to deny it - but what is in it for you?  I bring so much trouble to your life - even when I try not to.”
“Children,” Mrs. Malfoy crisply begins refocusing Jamie’s attention on her as she stands, gliding forward and clasping her hands.  “My eyes may be failing me, but have you brought some manner of dog into my sitting room?”
“Am I supposed to remember every little thing?”  Mrs. Malfoy replies airily, expression entirely unconcerned as she directs her teaspoon to stir the contents of her teacup.  “That dreadful addition is hardly at the top of my priority list.  Thank Circe, it’s at the back of the estate.  Perhaps your visitors will not have time to see it?”  She tacks on in a hopeful tone.
He presses the corner of Potter’s mouth lightly with his thumb.  Testing the waters.  Potter has his arm around him after all.  Surely, this is okay too?
“The seaweed?  Oh, yes.  They can’t get enough of it.  Perhaps we can try some later – how about for breakfast?”  He teases.
“I hate you.”  Draco mutters, voice labored as he looks ready to come himself.  Eyes half-lidded.  Cheeks ruddy and movement becoming uneven.  Stuttering.  “I hate you so much I love you, you bastard.”
“I’ll be back as soon as I can.”  Harry assures as he stands, zipping up his trousers, and leaning over to kiss Draco before striding out the door at a brisk pace.
“Oh, hello, James Potter.”  Luna greets blithely once she spots him.  Her lime green dress flounces as she draws closer.  A gentle smile blooms on her face as she ducks to speak to him through the ajar door.  “I was just remembering you and your siblings might be about.  Have you been enjoying the flutterflips here?  There appears to be a small colony outside.”  She asks him conversationally, expression inquisitive.
“Try to ignore them if you can.  If not, use your best judgement.”  Dad advises.  “Like I always say, do what you can to avoid a fight, but if it comes to you anyway be smart and stay safe.”
Ginevra is white as a sheet where she kneels next to her son.  Holding his hand as Albus sputters and coughs.  Harry is loud as he encourages the boy to keep coughing – to breathe.  Audrey’s wand is a blur as she siphons water out of Albus’ mouth and runs through diagnostics.  He is dimly aware of recognizing some he uses in his own work.
“In a way, yeah, the tours are part of why I’m curious.”  He allows, thankful for the segue.  “But we were talking today at a meeting about how the death eaters operated at the beginning of each war.  How they initially got their start.  What we – the ministry – learned about how they organized themselves and any other people who may have learned from them too.  The connections that knowledge has to current dark magic users.”
He maneuvers Harry so he is kneeling on the bed.  Bent in half so his knees take most of his own weight.
“Harry,” Draco reproaches, touching Dad’s arm.  Jamie frowns at Draco’s tone.  Usually Draco stayed out of any
have to get married.  Neither of us obviously wants that . . .”  She trails off, sitting back before giving him a stern look, still holding on to his hand.  “Your probation is almost over, right?”
It’s the weekends he does not have the kids that he struggles to find things to fill his time.  Used to be he would just go into work or do paperwork at home listening to quidditch games on the Wizarding Wireless Network.
Harry watches Kingsley rest his chin on a closed fist, brow furrowing as he stares at Malfoy's bowed head.
“In an official capacity?”  Harry questions, feeling his stomach sink.  The ministry made Draco uncomfortable.  More than that, really.  If he was summoned again Harry was afraid of the outcome.  The oversight hearing had already done a number on his boyfriend.
“Yes, thank you.”  Draco answers voice polite and assured.  Surprising Harry, considering how Draco had reacted earlier.
Simone smiles.  “It is important to make time to visit with friends.  Our lives are so busy anymore.”
It was the first time he ever interacted with a muggle.  Doctor - although he had no idea that was a title and not a name.  One who listened to his chest with a cold metal device and inserted a needle briefly into his arm.  Apparently, there was some medicine muggles had that Father had refused to allow administered to him.  Of course, Draco did not comprehend this until years later.  All the healers had recommended it Mother later admitted to him.  Father had refused again and again.
The speaker is a primary school tutor for muggle-born children.  She is very engaging.  She reminds him of a young Professor Flitwick with all her zest and she has them all in a lively debate before too long.  He can see how children would hang on her every word.  It is a shame how sparse her audience is.  In fact, it is just him and two other potion masters who appear to be the youngest people at this conference.  Taking notes as quickly as they can.
“I will.”  Harry retorts, leaning back.  He was a bit stiff today.  Work had involved one too many rough landings.  He had cushioned one jump with a charm, but his bad leg would be sore tomorrow.  Could feel it from the small twitches of muscle in his thigh.  “Do you still want to try cooking tonight?”
This time of day, his boyfriend is in one of two places at the manor, his office or the lab.  He finds him in the office.  Draco is writing at his desk while dictating to another quill taking notes before him.  It sounds like he is making a list for ingredients or plants he needs.
Harry rolls his eyes.  “If Ginny gets upset, she’ll say something.  She has zero problem giving her opinion.  Believe you me.  I doubt it though.  She’s usually pretty content to leave me all the big decisions and let the kids behave how they want.”
“I started dating Draco Malfoy.”  He tells her straight out.  Handing her the glass of wine he poured for her.
“But I don’t pity you.”  He tries to reassure.  It doesn’t seem to soften Draco though.  He takes a deep breathe, steeling himself.  In for sickle in for a knut.  “What does the name Ingmar Junge mean to you?”
The last lecture he attends is his ‘for fun’ choice.  He tries to allocate time for one at every conference.  Astoria and Harry would poke fun if they knew.  This one is particularly stimulating as it is the first talk he has attended that focuses on teaching potions.  Ever since he became more involved in the children’s education – particularly James’ – he has pondered how to begin introducing the building blocks of potion theory.  It seems to him that other magical subjects are given ample attention in their curriculum in comparison.  He can understand why – in a way.  The combination of mathematics and multitude ingredient interactions is perhaps more than most teachers want to tackle with their primary school pupils, but he will persist.  It is best practice to start early with potions.
“Al, you don’t even know what you’re talking about.”  Dad reproaches immediately.  Jamie knows Dad isn't too serious because he’s still got a relaxed expression on.  It’s not
He really does not know how to respond to her pronouncement.  Fun?  He was alive despite everything.  Despite all his sins.  Does he get to have fun?
Harry shakes his head.  Expression worried.  “I’ve caught him so many times struggling to read.  I just told him to keep practicing and let it go.”
“Papa!  Daddy!  I’m five!”  Lily whisper shouts racing into their bedroom and causing their bed to tremor as she throws herself onto it.  Harry groans mournfully from his place tucked beside him.  Turning so his arm tightens around him.  His boyfriend’s cold nose hitting his neck rousing Draco further.
Draco sighs.  The remorse he feels for what he put Harry and his friends through is the lasting ache in all this.  Long after he is out of the sling and has full use of his arm again.
“They’re good people.”  Harry says slowly.  He believes it too.  He wouldn't have them on his squad otherwise.  “All of them are pretty young though.  They haven’t been exposed to a lot of the red tape and bureaucracy within the ministry.  None of them have lost someone on the job yet either.  They still have ideals.”
nice, Harry.  We burnt the ceremonial Yule log – preferably one from the estate.  We lit it in the fireplace in the great hall.  We usually exchanged gifts then too.  Supposedly grandfather Abraxas always sacrificed one of the goats, but I don’t remember that happening.  Mother always said that I cried during that part.”
“Will she be upset?”  Draco questions.  He might be in her place.  It was disconcerting to him that he was with the children more than their own mother.  This was an anxiety he had never stated aloud.  Concerned that Harry would interpret it as a criticism of his ex-wife.  Besides, a good part of him thought this feeling sprang from old sexist beliefs.  But the feeling remained.  The discomfort that maybe he was infringing on someone else’s role.
She nods again as if expecting that response.  “He’ll come ‘round.  Give him time.  Ron always needs space to think things through.  Are you going to make a statement?”
Hermione rolls her eyes, but her expression is embarrassed.  Draco feels the same, briefly shielding his eyes with his hand.  Although, privately, he cannot deny that a part of him wants to spend the whole trip sequestered away with Harry in their hotel suite.
Draco’s biting his lower lip.  Watching him uncertainly as Harry ties himself up.  Wandlessly directing the rope to bind his wrists and feet, tying them together where he is on his knees, forcing himself to lean back fractionally on his haunches until he can feel the slight burn in his hip from the strain.  Leaving himself open and exposed to Draco.  Absolutely starkers.  The cold marble floor of their private bathroom at Grimmauld grounding him.
“I would really just like the bacon.”  Percy cuts in politely despite the frosty argument occurring in front of him, eyes glancing impatiently between the two men.  “Please.”
“There’s nothing to forgive.”  He asserts.  Hoping Draco can see how sincerely he means what he is saying.  How serious he is.  “But you have to hear me now, okay?”
“Hermione.”  Harry begins slowly, getting an idea.  “Do you know if you happened to be invited to the Mercury Medical Clinic’s annual gala?”
“Do I have to give it back at the end of the night then?”  Harry cracks, snorting to himself.  Ron would be so proud of his dad joke.  Draco gives him a smile that Harry interprets as ‘You’re cute, but not funny’.
“Healer Hargreeves has helped me a lot over the years.  I want to support his work.”  Harry replies diplomatically, forcing his expression polite but disinterested.  “Congratulations on marrying Anthony, I guess.”
Draco guffaws.  “They are all fairly self-sufficient . . . and potty trained - thank Circe.”  His boyfriend replies.
The whole household’s schedule changes due to this.  Draco becomes the primary pickup person at school when the bell rings.  Lily already in hand as they wait with Pansy.  The children still stay at their grandparents’ home at least once a week after school on Ron Weasley’s day off, but Draco usually gathers them from the Burrow earlier now too.  He maintains more consistent work hours than Harry after all.  It seems practical to collect the children himself.  One less trip for Harry to make before coming home.
“Daddy, Mrs. Goldstein brought her baby!”  Lily tells her father exuberantly like this is the most fantastic thing that has happened to her all day.  For all Draco knows, that is true.
“Hmm?”  He responds to his best friend distractedly.  Astoria sits on the arm of the chair he is currently occupying and hands him a steaming cup of tea which he takes gratefully.
It settles something for Harry when Malfoy resorts to name calling.  This is a part of Malfoy’s character he understands.  The prat who still allows Harry to get under his skin not so far hidden beneath the polished veneer of a professional.  He can work with this.  It is childish but the thought of pestering Malfoy is an exciting one.
“I’ll be sure to tell her you said that."  He responds.  It was nice to hear support for his friend.  "It’s been a recent cause for her.”
“You two need to shag.”  Ron says in a rush with a put-upon expression.  His face going bright red to match his hair.
“He's hovering.”  He complains to her on her last night with them.  She would be going to her sister’s next.  Astoria planned to stay in town until her club opened.
Draco sighs, “It has been sealed for over a decade.  The Purgo charm they placed would have cleansed anything actively pestiferous -
“After I finished school and was earning more.  She’s been with me for the last three years or so.  I am lucky she chose to come here with me.”
Father used to walk him down the long portrait hall, pointing out every Malfoy ancestor.  Extolling each of their purported virtues.  Starting with the great Armand Malfoy who founded the family line in Britain all the way down to the ornate frame of his late grandfather: Abraxas Malfoy.  Staid and stately in in his portrait.  Greeting them formally, aloof.  Lucius was the man who created the foundation of Draco’s beliefs – of himself.
He and Draco arrived at the hill overlooking the Burrow sometime after noon.  They only made it a little ways down the stone path before Lily caught sight of them.  Running away from Roxie and Hugo who are playing some game with a large orange ball.  Lily bounds over to the garden gate.  Beaming  at them.
“You, Potter.”  Robards replies blandly as he leans against his desk, cup of coffee in hand.  “I haven’t been informed who filed it yet or the evidence – the DMLE got the original complaint.  But they claim you’ve been compromised by Draco Malfoy.  I’m guessing the news in the Prophet the other day of your family’s association with Malfoy led to it.”
“Sounds like you don’t know either.”  Liam retorts snottily, waving them off with a two-finger salute.  Jamie returns with the same like Freddie taught him to do.
I trust, it is your noble pursuit for truth.  Do you even suffer from a blood curse?”  Malfoy demands, pivoting to face him.
“You cannot shield him from everything, Harry.”  He advises.  And really, he felt Harry sheltered the children more than necessary at times.  “This was a challenge he was going to face at some point no matter what.”
“I care about you.”  He assures quietly, chest suddenly aching.  Astoria squeezes his hand.  “But no, I don’t – I wish I could . . .”  He is so tired.  He cannot seem to feel better even without the looming threat of violence and death.
“He’s right.”  Jamie confesses.  He might as well now that Al’s started.  “She’s real nice and, if she stays with us, she’ll stop digging up holes – and potted plants.”
There is a high pitched crying suddenly from far off and he ducks his head back.  Lily and Hugo run into the room.  “Daddy!  Draco!” Lily wails.  “Al pushed me!”
He does not often frequent wizarding pubs.  For one, people he doesn't care to speak to talk to him.  For another, Draco is reticent to join him.  Today he is meeting Ron in Yorkshire at a pub called Farcical Fernley’s a located at the center of the magical community that resides there.  It is nice enough.  There is minimal fuss as he takes a seat with his back to the wall at an available table and orders a drink and some chips.  Subtlety observing the other patrons.
“Yes.  Work.”  Draco restates.  Forcing himself into a neutral expression and tone.  “I am employed as a researcher.  I develop potions.”
“And you’re letting me stay here?”  Malfoy asks, casting around as if someone might pop out and say the whole thing was a joke.  “Permanently?”
“Ah, Jamie, Lils.” Dad greets with a bright grin on that Jamie takes to mean he is okay with the stranger there.  “This is my friend Draco.  He’s joining us for dinner.”
It's intoxicating in other ways.  Having Draco close is usually is.  Hands wandering.  People dancing around them in waves, leaving them tucked into their own bubble.  Everyone lost in their own minds and bodies.  Cocooned by the loud music, lights, and movement.  He can't tell how much time has passed.  It could be hours or minutes for all he is able to track time in here.  Draco puts an arm around Harry’s shoulder and Harry brings their lips together.  His tongue immediately seeking entry into Draco’s mouth and gripping his boyfriend’s blond hair in his hand.
“Harry.”  Ron states, finally acknowledging him after being coldly silent all morning.  The other Weasleys present had looked questioningly between them for the last hour but said nothing.  Allowing the tension to brew.  Likely hoping it would fizzle out on its own as it had in the past.
Lily shrugs her shoulders.  “I don’t know.”  She answers.  It’s honest.  Jamie will give her that and more importantly Dad seems to accept that excuse.  Lily wasn’t a very good liar yet and not good at keeping secrets.  She usually told the truth at some point when she tried.
“Which is not a bad thing.”  Draco reminds quietly.  “I imagine you are a big part of the ideals they have.”
“Lavender Brown.”  Ron interrupts, finishing his drink in one large gulp, then slamming it down.  “Boom.  Someone else go.”
When Draco asks Harry about it one night, his boyfriend only shrugs, setting his glasses down on the bedside table as he prepares for sleep.
“You mean Draco.”  Harry surmises, frowning.  Noting in his periphery how Hermione and Kingsley shift slightly in their seats.  Robards remains firm though.  Gaze shrewd.  His boss hadn’t denounced his choice in partner, but a cool distance had grown between them since that fateful oversight hearing months ago.  A fact that Harry knew Hermione was aware of as well.
“Do you know how much I admire you?”  Draco murmurs, staring at him through the mirror.  Grey eyes steely.  Focus totally on him the way he craves.  “How vulnerable you allow yourself to look?  But that’s what you like.  You like to be held back.  You like someone to be rough with you.  Let them feel like they’re in control – be teased.”
The man nods curtly, lips thinning.  “You are not the only one who loves someone they would be best served not to.”
If Draco had had his wits about him – he may have told his father to go to hell.  Instead he accepted his father’s farewell, briefly clasping his cold hand and watching the man he had idolized be led away by guards.  Back to Azkaban.
“What?  The park?”  Harry wonders aloud, tone confused.  Strands of his dark hair falling out of his hair tie as he cocks his head back, considering.  “I know we usually go to the other one.”
Draco takes a bite of the cheesy sandwich and closes his eyes.  Savoring the taste and the remaining sensation of Harry’s midday scruff scratching him from the kiss.  Feeling contented.  Ginevra’s perspective on him would not change his place at Harry’s side.  He knows that now.  But he cannot deny that her approval is appreciated when it comes to the children.  It settles something within him.
There is more laughter and children running about than he suspects the manor has ever seen.  His own remembrances are more . . . restrained.
A stark contrast to how he was raised.  All his childhood and adolescence were spent rigidly removed from muggles.  When he visited France as a boy he was relegated to the family’s villa where his parents controlled who came and went.  It was not until he arrived in Paris with Astoria years ago, that he began to interact with muggles on a daily basis.
“Oh mais oublie, c’est pas grave,” Simone returns, tone lascivious.  “Je ne peux pas m’en empêcher. Il est canon. Je suis contente pour vous.”
It is a bit chilly out this time of year, but his jacket keeps him warm.  He pauses his walk atop one of the hills closer to the surrounding walls, purple heather growing wildly about him, looking out at the estate with the husk of the manor off in the distance.  It is a grand view.  He wonders idly what the place looked like before it became infested by Riddle and his death eaters.  Naturally, Lucius was still here before that time but, Harry suspects, the man at least cared about the manor.
“I would never dream of threatening you.”  She replies, suddenly coquettish.  “You are an auror after all.”
He enjoys the final speaker for the conference.  It is rare for him to appreciate both opening and closing remarks at these things.  Perhaps it is because this year included a wider range of topics.  Regardless, he is also excited for the excursion Harry dangled in front of him before leaving their suite this morning.
“Excuse you,” Hermione ruffles, directing her ire at her husband.  “Why can’t I ask about their sex life, but you can?”
Draco would laugh at that if Albus did not look so poorly.  The boy’s messy black hair is sweaty, and his skin is clammy when Draco feels his forehead.  Albus shivers miserably, frowning up at him.  Green eyes distraught.
Their weekly fire call usually focused more on Astoria’s goings on, but the recent news had changed that.  Draco was unsure whether he liked that or not, but Astoria appeared to be enjoying their conversation.
“I will do my best.”  Draco promises.  “But even you have to admit this had several nice moments - and it's for charity.  Astoria says we have to give them something to nibble on sometimes to control the narrative so to speak.”
Merlin, he loves being between Draco’s legs.  All long and pale and cradling him.  Harry rests his forearms by the sides of Draco’s head on the mattress.  Ducking his own head down, not quite touching there as his hair falls forward.  One of Draco’s arms bent at the elbow, hand gripping Harry’s bicep.  Grounding him.  Harry watches Draco’s flushed skin react to every move he makes.  Pale and tan skin melding.  Leaving reddening marks behind.  The muscles in Draco’s stomach jumping each time Harry shifts.  Grey eyes lidded.
“Yeah.  That’s when he lived far away.”  Albus says.  Never one to allow only his sister and brother to speak without his two knuts to add in.  “Mum lived with us then.”
hid the remains of the dark mark on his forearm.  Now Draco has on a plain, light blue cotton tee and dark jogger sweatpants.  A bare foot tapping absently on the hardwood floor.  Drops of ink on the side of his boyfriend’s hand from where he was making notes in the margins.
Harry gamely takes a shot with the rest of them.  It burns on the way down and tastes of peppermint.  He's glad he doesn't cough in response, but it is a near thing.
He shakes his head.  Refocusing on Draco who looks at him patiently.  Squeezing their joined hands.  Harry feels himself smile a bit ruefully.  “I think I need a vacation.”  He admits.
The curse breakers had done it.  It was even reported in the Prophet during his trial like that would somehow be a slap in the face.  They were helping them really.  The dark lord and his followers – not to mention his own father – had left numerous unpleasant artefacts and dark magics behind.  Elements for future weaponry.  Sealing it would significantly reduce the strength if not the purpose of those spells.
“Neither I’m afraid.”  Harry answers, trying for levity.  It does not work.  “It just happened.  I’m glad it happened – ridiculously so even.”
“I am.”  Harry answers with a tinge of sadness.  Harry watches while Draco finishes up his work.  He would miss watching this focused man.  Draco threw himself into anything to do with his research Harry had learned.  He enjoyed listening to him ramble about different obstacles that popped up.  It reminded him of Hermione in a way.  All that determination to learn everything they could about a subject.
Being with the rookies was not always Harry’s favorite part of the job, particularly when they talked about what
But another thought arises as he makes his way to work.  One he can't quite shake while lining up in the queue inside the atrium.  Taking the lifts down to his level and heading straight into his office to review the night shift’s reports.  Interoffice paper aeroplane memos flying through the air.
Harry shifts awkwardly in his seat.  Smile polite and forced.  Trying to think of another topic of conversation.  Anything.  “Draco tells me you’re thinking of selling your place in Edinburgh?”  He throws out.  Which seems to work as both Malfoys pause to consider him.
Jamie shifts on his spot on the floor.  “Yeah, the boy thought he would get hurt but he helped anyway.”
“I like you a lot, Draco.”  She tells him, interrupting his thoughts.  “You’re clever and funny and overall much more tolerable now.  We could leave Britain together – not as husband and wife – but as friends.  We can use my dowry money and have a fresh start.”  She suggests earnestly.
Harry rolls his eyes and crosses his arms.  Scoffing.  He's obviously not going to win this one.  He really didn't want to he supposed.  There were more important hills to bleed on.  “Fine.”
“You don’t celebrate Christmas at all?”  He questions as they work in their sitting room to wrap the children’s presents.  It's midnight.  All gifting operations happened in the dead of night to avoid sneaky sprogs.  Harry had learned that lesson the hard way.  His children had a sixth sense for locating hidden presents.
If he could remain suspended in this he would, but soon it becomes unbearable.  All he wants to do is come.  The pressure in his body increasing at an absurd rate until he crests and finishes.  It feels like his body is shaking apart and being reassembled by Harry.  If he is completely honest, it is the most intense orgasm of his life.
“I bought these with just you in mind, love.”  Draco remarks, kicking off his trousers that had fallen around his ankles along with his shoes.  “I’m not terribly adept at dirty talk, but I hoped you would appreciate this purchase.  It’s my gift to you after all.”
“Do you think you’ll move back to Britain permanently?”  He questions.  Draco was guessing she might.  He wonders what it will be like if Narcissa becomes a more frequent visitor.  His boyfriend clearly loved his mother but also seemed comfortable to have her at a distance.
