"That's right, baby," Harry kissed the other inner thigh, and then pressed the two fingers firmly back inside Draco, making him keen and want to arch his back off the bed. "Don't worry," he whispered. "I'll tell you when you can move...I'll be inside you soon, okay?" There were colours bursting behind Draco's eyelids and he could
Tears dripped down Draco's cheeks unbidden, but they were of relief, as his body sagged again, Harry straightening up and easily taking his weight.
Harry just smiled as he sat down right next to Draco, so that their thighs were pressed firmly together, reaching out with one hand to absently stroking his fingers through Draco's hair, and it made Draco close his eyes as Harry's other hand was reaching out for one of the water bottles.
!" Draco gasped out, body jolting forward, thighs beginning to shake and knees feeling as though they were going to skid out from underneath him and have his body collapse completely.
. "I just—I just—" his breathing was coming out hard and he curled his fingers into the covers beneath him, and he bit down hard on his lower lip before he managed to get the words out, under his breath. "

were—Draco's were filled with coconut water, avocado, pine nuts, protein powder, spinach, almond milk, and sometimes there were dried cranberries when he was feeling extra generous toward himself, whereas Harry had a bag of mixed berries, honey, ice cream, full cream milk, yoghurt and some M&M's on the bench next to the smoothie maker.
But he'd never trusted someone to completely let go with before, that he knew wouldn't push him too far but would still give him what he needed to reach that special place inside his head, and that would be there afterwards to look after him.
all the time, and I just—what happened between us the other week had been on my mind
"Yeah?" Harry breathed, his nose rubbing against his again, his hands rubbing up and down against Draco's sides. "You feeling good, baby? You ready?"
That had been when Draco had abruptly shoved back from the table and left without a word.
Everything else just faded out.
"Pansy messaged me," Harry began, his voice low and soothing, not panicking Draco as he explained how he had found Draco, and it didn't make Draco worry or even open his eyes as Harry dried him. "She told me that your father had showed up at your Aunt Bella's, and that you had left. Your aunt rung Pansy, because, well...She didn't have
Draco hung his blouse over the back of the chair that was tucked at Harry's desk, and he was about to leave when he noticed a picture that was pinned to the clipboard behind the desk, with ripped off concert ticket and movie stubs and some other pictures.
Draco
"I've got you, Dray," Harry said, and his tone had changed momentarily, lighter for a few beats as they pulled back and Draco was tempted to turn over and pull at his skin tight pants, but Harry took over. He pressed a hand into his lower back, quietly easing him back to facing forward, before his fingers were hooking under the tight denim and working them slowly down Draco's hips, taking his socks off with the jeans, leaving him in just his panties. There was a hitch as Harry's breath caught in this throat, because no matter how many times he had seen the wide variety of panties his lover owned, they would always catch him off guard. "Fuck, sweetheart," Harry's voice got rougher as Draco shifted his knees a little to help with his jeans, and while he would usually appreciated the lace panties some more, something else was calling to Harry this time. He began tugging his panties down, over Draco's round, pale ass, and...There it was.
He sounded
, although he felt as though he was always staring when he was around Harry.
His body jerked as soon as those thoughts settled, his hole tightening around Harry and as usual, Harry instantly could sense a shift.
"Hey, baby," Harry replied easily, although a little louder than usual, which told Draco that the other guy was still there.
!" He cried out, tears leaking from the corners of his eyes and dripping down his cheeks, joining the mess of spit smeared across his chin and jawline.
And he had called him
, baby," Harry sounded reverent as he peeled the jersey over Draco's head, careful as he went, one hand cupping the back of his head and lifting it off the pillow, taking his time with Draco's arms before he was laying on the bed in just the pink panties and the black, oversized shirt with the pink writing splashed across the front. "You have no idea how much 'Mione and Ron have heard me talk about you, how bad I just wanted to make you feel better when you looked sad after getting off a call with your boss or your asshole father, how bad I just wanted to kiss you when
"We're meeting tomorrow with Ginny and Luna, right?" Pansy mentioned to Hermione on one of her trips back to the table to pick up another drink and Hermione nodded and pushed back her brunette curls to talk to Pansy, and Draco watched them for a moment, even though he couldn't quite hear what they were talking about.
Something his teenage self had adopted to help himself cope without even realizing until therapy years later.
when Harry's hands were on him, but...He also really wanted Harry's hands
Absently, Draco realized that the music on the TV had stopped at some point.
He could still feel Harry over him, but he wasn't sure exactly what was happening, closing his eyes and just letting him choose what they were doing next, trusting him to take the lead because it was honestly a miracle that he had even been able to reply at all.
It was a bit strange, the way a tear spilled out of the corner of one eye, falling down his cheek and drawing Harry's sharp eye, tilting his head to the side as he slowly pulled his fingers from Draco's mouth despite the whine of protest.
"I am," Harry answered steadily, with complete certainty. "And you're my baby."
But there was one last thing.
to fixate on the hand in front of him, but Harry knew.
"You can hold it, baby," Harry whispered, and it was the way he still sounded so steady despite Draco's clearly needy state. It sent Draco bustling
"I can feel you clenching around me, baby," Harry was whispering, and it just made Draco clench harder, his cock blatantly leaking onto the covers below them. "You feeling worked up? Was it the plug inside you that's been making you all needy?" Draco let out a whimper, it passed through his lips without even really thinking, and he absently heard a huff of laughter behind him. "Or was it the man in the suit at the club who couldn't keep his eyes off you?"
Even now, he didn't shuffle Draco out from under the spray entirely, so he had to rotate to wash himself properly, but he made no sound of complaint, and he kept leaning in to kiss Draco's cheeks lightly in a way that had him blushing so hard he could feel the heat spreading down to his chest.
There was music playing in one of the apartments nearby, something by Khalid, and Draco felt warmer in Harry's knitted jersey than he had been in his blazer and sitting next to him on the fire escape in the autumn breeze than he had felt sitting in the back of a cab, shaking with how nervous he had been driven from uptown where the party was to Harry's apartment building.
"Open up for me, love," Harry said quietly as he touched the top of the water bottle to Draco's lower lip, and Draco opened his mouth automatically, his eyes still closed with his head pressed into Harry's hand as Harry tipped the water bottle up and poured some into Draco's mouth. "That a bit better?"
Even though they had had sex
—as Draco always used to point out with a smirk—and they'd never actually talked off the soccer field.
think you're not pretty," there was an earnestness in Harry's voice that made Draco squirm. "I promise..." he was pushing back, thick fingers dragging, blunt nails scratching, until he was resting between Draco's thighs again and was pulling at the waistband of his pants. "I promise I'll always do my best to make you feel pretty..." unlike before, when Draco couldn't
Every second that went by, felt like a full minute, and his skin was prickling in anticipation, before suddenly, Harry's hand reached out and smoothed over his ass again, touching the heated skin that made Draco let out a hiss before his eyelids drooped closed.
And it made it easy to let go.
Most nights that they went out with Harry and his friends, either just in a small group or at a party or out clubbing, he was going home with Harry, rather than with Pansy which was what had had happened at least half the time before, and so things were changing for them, and they were both changing with them.
When Harry woke up, he smacked his lips, winced at the fact that he had dry mouth and remembered what had happened last night.
"Alright, pretty baby," Harry's voice got a little rougher, and Draco felt a shiver go through him, because he really,
Plus it would mean he was wearing something of Harry's, so Draco was on board.
Pansy had had a crush on the girl who had been on the opposing girls soccer team all through their high school, years, but the other girl was practically the opposite of Pansy, quiet, gentle,
Draco Malfoy exhaled heavily and forced himself to rap his knuckles quickly against the apartment door before he lost his nerve.

, that made Draco smile.
That was something that his brain could always settle back on.
He held out a hand to Draco as he unfolded himself from under the sheet and duvet and as it was exposed that Draco was just in panties—Harry's eyes widened slightly and he gave Draco a slightly lewd once over that made Draco's skin heat, but that was as far as it went as he left the room to turn on the shower.
He lost track of time.
"It was good," Draco's words were a little slurred and heavy from sleep, and it made Harry smile and the concerned wrinkles smooth out.
His eyes widened in horror, hearing it bounce off the walls of the hallway with
," Draco stuttered out again, and he heard a hum from Harry and the rustle of clothing being removed, and Draco couldn't help but curl his toes in anticipation.
"I got scared, you know?" Draco said quickly, through puffs of smoke escaping the corners of his mouth, and he resolutely stared ahead, at the apartment building opposite Harry's that had a fading poster of the Marvel movie that came out last year, edges all frayed and peeling and dirt streaking it. "I wanted it so bad and I just—" he hissed through his teeth and dug his manicured nails into his knees. "And I was just scared that I was going to fuck things up, because I just—I'm
He maybe loved it more than Harry loved seeing
!" Draco cried out, high pitched and whiny and Harry made a huffing noise under his breath, his head dropped down between Draco's shoulder blades as he began jerking Draco off quickly, easily, the excessive precome making it so easy, and then—"
"Hey, sweet baby," Harry's voice gently broke through the haze in Draco's head as Harry whispered in his ear, nibbling softly on the shell of his ear. "How about you get on your knees for me now, yeah? Let me use your mouth properly?" And Draco wanted to nod his head enthusiastically a hundred times
—you've got
!" Draco nodded his head eagerly, trying to focus on Harry crouched between his legs, even though he couldn't quite shake the glaze from his eyes. "Daddy, I—
Harry didn't give him any warning before he was pulling out the plug, disposing of it somewhere, and Draco let out a squeak, pushing up on his hands weakly so that he could properly present to Harry, knees a little further apart this time, although he still hadn't felt a dip in the mattress to indicate that his lover had climbed up behind him and he couldn't help but wiggle his ass a little, trying to entice him closer.
," Draco breathed out as he felt the knuckles of Harry's fingers press against his ass, indicating that he had buried three fingers inside his ass, but suddenly, they weren't twisting anymore, and then Harry was leaning forward and biting down
, that he let his eyes fall shut again. "Such a pretty baby..." Harry was pressing the words into Draco's neck, tugging the jersey down so that the hollow of his throat and his collarbones were exposed and then he was sucking at the bared skin, sucking marks against the pale skin and Draco couldn't help the way he was wiggling and bucking underneath Harry. "
Harry's room was pretty...Normal.
. "I'm sorry," he actually felt tears beginning to form in the corners of his eyes, getting ready to spill over, and his head was
Maybe for only the second or third time ever.

They promptly flew back open when Harry tapped a finger against the plug and he jolted forward at the way the plug shifted inside him, letting out a low moan as Harry's hands slid up his back, over his skin, the contrast between Harry's roughened palms over his smooth skin always made him shake and his eyes roll back and he could feel his mind going fuzzy and clear in the best way.
, I was so pissed. I was going to camp out in your apartment all day until you came back," he broke off, to nose at Draco's cheek before his lips were skimming Draco's jaw and Draco shivered, one of his hands gripping at Harry's shoulder. "But I thought that maybe it was just a one off thing for you—" he sucked at the skin underneath Draco's ear and Draco's back arched, his breathing stuttering. "And I didn't want to crowd you, so I left." Draco really wished he hadn't left. He wished that by the time Pansy had convinced him to go back to his apartment, Harry was still naked and tangled in his sheets like he had been when Draco had snuck out like a coward. "But I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad, baby," Harry's head pulled back so he could look Draco in the eye and they were both breathing hard, their lips red and their iris' blown and Harry shook his head minutely. "My room. Bed."
"Yeah," Draco breathed out, seeing the twitch of Harry's lips in a smile.
It kept him floating and sweet and once they were finally done, Harry cleared everything away and made sure that Draco had more water to drink, before gathering him into his arms and making Draco feel so small and protected that everything that happened this morning just completely slipped away, as though it had happened in a whole other month.
"I...I want you..." Draco licked his lips quickly, eyelashes flickering under the mascara applied, and he wondered if Harry was looking at the glitter applied at the corners of his eyelids, given how close they were. It wasn't a lot, but he'd felt like looking pretty going out tonight, and he was
It wasn't much, but it was enough for his breathing to start coming under control, gulping down a few lungful's of air, the first proper mouthfuls that he had gotten since he had left his aunts apartment, her sympathetic gaze and his fathers critical eyes glued to his back as he had walked away from them.
"Yes, please, daddy," Draco whispered, and Harry smiled, giving him a nod before leading him out of the room.
"Okay, but I'll pay!" Draco quickly interjected, because he knew that there was no way of talking Harry out of it now, because if he
, but...Seeing the picture stuck to Harry's clipboard made something flutter in Draco's stomach.
There was steam starting to gather in the small room, because Harry didn't have great ventilation like Draco's place did, and the shower was
"You going to come?" Harry asked softly, eyes watching Draco carefully, affectionately. "Going to come for daddy?"
"Take a seat," Harry nodded at the barstools on the other side of the breakfast bar as he moved to take another smoothie glass out of the cupboard, Draco watching his fingers closely, the veins in his hands flexing, the gorgeous ink on the back of his hand shading and sculpting the image of a lily, a tattoo dedicated to his mother. "Is there anything here that you don't like?" He asked as he turned back around and Draco tried not to look as though he had been
"Are...Are these some of Luna's?" Draco asked haltingly as he ran his finger along the seam of one of the black pillows with neon green writing stating, '
Twice he'd shyly asked for Harry to take photos of the bruises that had been pressed into his skin, and there had been some other times when Harry had caught him looking at marks left behind in glimpses in the mirror.
Or him and Draco together .
He sighed, weary, perhaps a little resigned to the plan he had drawn up and to which he stuck. And although he was thinking of other alternatives - he even contemplated talking with Hermione and Ron more deeply about his feelings, because if they knew something, it was that this new obsession with Draco was not only to keep an eye on him - to, again, get closer to him, he decided that it was time to stop for a moment.
Although his red and yellow uniform could distinguish him and physically make a difference between his green and silver, he really wondered if the Harry of that world could not see that, little by little, the color of his heart was changing, or maybe it just went back to what it really always was. It was very obvious the change in attitudes that he had had throughout those weeks; He went from being a spectator, to someone who really cared about marking what he considered his ... in every possible way.
He needed to get out of there as soon as possible, and he left that room without looking back.
And that infuriated him.
An inch shorter than him.
So he decided to go back to his final year at Hogwarts; he wanted to graduate and eventually find some potions course he could take, start his business, and slowly begin to clean up the stained family name he carried. He knew it was easier said than done, but he was very stubborn; It would show the whole world how wrong they were about him.
Chapter XIV
And he knew what he had to do.
He felt how slowly he began to lose patience with the emotions that emerged from within him. He couldn't control the exaggerated looks — as Ron and Hermione said — that he directed at Draco, nor could he help getting closer and closer to him to smell the peppermint scent coming from the blond. They were impulses that he wished were not so evident, but he finally failed in the attempt, because only in that way could he enliven his soul, at least in those moments.
In addition, Draco was not only search , was he searching .
"No," he answered as curtly as he could. The stupid fall hit your head more than you already had it.
He clenched his hands and started running towards what was his room in the dungeons. There were not many who were left of his house, but he did not want the duties of a prefect either, so they gave him a room very close to the common room, but far from the other bedrooms.
(See the end of the chapter for notes .)
Upon entering, he cast a little privacy spell and walked directly to the sinks to turn on the faucet and drink water to pour it on his face; The cold sensation briefly distracted him from his feeling of anger, and he was grateful that he had the peace of mind for a moment just to know exactly what he was going to do.
They had no idea what day they were.
He was greedy. He loved Harry from the other world for all the unconditional affection he gave him from the first moment they met, he went out of his way for him night and day, looking at him with those soft green eyes, giving himself without any hint of shame or shame. Those weeks of living together had given her fun and sincere moments; he was happy and confused, because he knew they would soon finish fixing the diary and that Harry would go away.
"And what a blow, are you okay?" Now Ron, who was still wearing his Quidditch uniform, was the one who spoke and put his hand on her shoulder.
Did anyone else's heart break when they saw my Harry Sly lose his smile? Because I do.
Or many Draco's.
He was not the Harry to that Draco.
"Sometimes I can see that you have Hufflepuff behaviors," he said without looking at him, although he knew he got his attention.
He had to do something soon if he didn't want things to turn out wrong.
Draco opened and closed his mouth; he was overwhelmed by the words he had just heard, the ones he had wanted to hear for a long time. His hands sweated, and the heavy weight on his chest prevented him from breathing normally; although he was forced to diminish the emotion that was growing in his body, and tried to put any other face, except the idiot one that he surely had.
Three days. Three days and everything will start again.
Time passed and the night already haunted him; his gaze was fixed between the hermetically closed door of the infirmary and the bundle of nerves that were his hands. Now that he was alone, he thought about what he would do once he got inside to see how Harry was, because just a couple of days before, he had demanded that she get away from him.
Harry seldom used that tone of voice with someone other than an enemy. It was the same one he used when Harry from Gryffindor challenged him in the bathroom ... that voice was only to stand up proud as an honorary heir to Salazar, the one who distinguished him and for what everyone called him Emperor ...
Draco was so engrossed in feeling his heart fluttering in his chest, that he ignored the presence that was closely following his footsteps.
You protected him, didn't you? Of Quirrell, of Remus and Sirius when he believed they were a danger to him and Ron and Hermione and then took them to the infirmary, then continued his role as a spy to help with the War, he tried to help Sirius despite his hatred against man, damn it. Snape even heard it when things were serious. He helped him and his friends to get the horcruxes destroyed as much as he could while continuing his role of perfect loyalty to Voldemort.
A rebellious and defiant look that looked at Draco with incredible affection, covered by a cape with the embroidery of the Slytherin house. He saw him smile at Draco and then turn to look at him, completely changing the brightness of his eyes to a dull one that reflected obvious disdain.
"I guess Cedric Diggory didn't like the news."
Raspberry kisses.
-Thanks.
Closing his second book on magical history, Harry bit back tears.
"Thank you, and goodbye, ma'am." I recognize that you are a good director and teacher, much more than the silly version of you ...
If there was one thing Slytherin excelled at — besides cunning — it was in the loyalty they felt — at least to members of their own household. At an early age, he learned that Hogwarts could be very cruel to those who were selected for the green and silver house; So, thanks to the social harassment they felt, they had little or no regard for students from other houses than their own.
"I'm sorry?" Estrada blinked innocently while he asked this, rounding out the vowels and throwing Harry off like always. Harry never really
"Can't know for certain, yet, but I'd say at least half a year more."
“We’re two men, Harry,” Draco drawled. “You, the heir of the Black house, and me, a Pureblood relative of the Blacks. He’s likely glad that you’re shacking up with someone halfway respectable – in his eyes, at least – though upset that I’m not a woman and can’t continue the familial line in a traditional way.”
“I hope you know what you’re doing,” she finally said, her voice quiet.
“It does. All of the numbers have significantly been reduced,” Malfoy answered. He spoke to Betty as Hermione and Ron hugged. “Run it by Leonel, just to make sure.”
“The brain fog,” Potter mumbled. “You like it?”
“Sorry, this a bad time?” she asked.
Two months into the school year and Draco still wasn’t used to the dormitory’s rounded common room that was decorated with soft armchairs, tables, and a divan. The staircases which were opposite each other – one for the boys and the other for the girls.
Harry set his bag down and bit his lip.
He led them into the bedroom he'd been using - one that hadn’t been personalized. For a while he debated upon sleeping in Sirius' old room but he couldn't bear it. The thought of displacing any of Sirius' things (any more than they already had been) made Harry’s stomach turn.
“And I was about to use the Cruciatus curse on you.
, leaving the two men alone once more.
“What?”
"Apologies, Master Harry," Kreacher bowed, shooting a glare at Hermione. "I informed the Mu - Mistress Granger that you were preoccupied -"
“Er,” said Potter.
“Hic abundant leones,” said Harry.
,” Harry said uncomfortably. He worried his lip. “They knew they weren’t the best. Did you know Ron and his brothers helped me escape in our second year? They showed up in the middle of the night and broke the bars on my windows. We flew away in their Ford Anglia.”
Harry tried not to sigh.
“Well of course Draco, what should we talk about instead?” Pansy asked pointedly, eyeing Draco hard.
She was frowning down at him.
“Yes, but I’m fine.”
"Figures you'd be here," said Draco.
He got back to his bed and stared at Wolff’s smiling face.
"It's a wonder she’s able to take me seriously with all the rubbish you've been putting in her head about me."
The old elf took the hint and bowed deeply before retreating to the dining room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry looked back at Malfoy, who actually seemed nervous for once.
, he did so.
He hated playing the part of the blushing virgin, but how could he be something he wasn’t? He wished he was experienced so he could go along with Harry and not feel so out of his depth. But more importantly, he wished he didn’t hate how he looked underneath his clothing.
“Thank you, Sir, but I’m afraid it’s mostly Draco who does the actual potion-making,” said Harry, nodding at Draco. “I just help when I can.”
"Right, cos all normal people break down every few days just because they have to stay sober."
“Well yeah,” sputtered Potter, “But you’re
And Potter. How was Draco supposed to face him? He'd surely be expecting an explanation for why Draco had run away from him twice yesterday, meaning he'd have to see Draco like this...
"And you really thought I'd be out to get you. After everything."
“Malfoy,” Granger said after a brief silence.
“Oh, I didn’t realize you two were still in here. I apologize.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair nervously. “You could still, y’know…”
“I’ll be outside, all right?” Ginny said, and left.
“Sorry. I’m pissed. Forget what I said.” Potter resumed his place at the railing, worrying his lip.
“Pansy thinks it’s impossible too,” Draco sighed. He felt his irritation rise. “Like I’m just ignoring or forgetting everything that’s happened before. But I’m not.”
"Do you?" Hermione challenged.
“You gave it to me,” Harry said slowly, feeling as though he’d done something wrong.
“Not –“ Harry said, stuffing his notes (far too aggressively) into his bag.
“I’ve made you one that we can all enjoy after today’s meeting,” Kathy said happily.
“I’m almost –“
“Go ahead, I’ll meet you lot there,” Harry replied as he rubbed his eyes.
“No thank you,” she said, and got herself a glass from the cupboard. “Do we have juice?”
“There were bars on your windows?”
Draco sighed. The anxiety that had been wrapping his chest and stomach in knots loosened its hold, and Draco felt like he could breathe a bit easier.
Harry checked his watch; 7:01.
Draco could barely focus as he found his jumper, cloak, and shoes. He pulled them all on distractedly, his mind on his wand. Once fully clothed, he stood there, wrapped up in his whirling thoughts as Harry continued to get dressed.
Draco had been working for approximately fourteen hours when Potter was brought in.
He nodded.
“Oh yeah, er, I think we have it somewhere…” Harry was trailing off, looking at the sea of boxes before him. “Draco? D’you know where we put the Floo powder?”
“Whatever,” she rolled her eyes. She then called towards the bedroom, “Luna, tea?”
“I think I’ll keep that one to myself a little longer.”
A red smear glared back at him from the back of his hand.
stronger for asking for help?”
"Yes, well, I'm glad you're all right. Ron and I don't mind if you don't come today, if you have other things to do -" Hermione said, her eyes flickering towards Draco, who bristled.
“Where is Blaise?” Pansy fumed, bringing Draco back to his own table.
Draco hadn’t even realized just how messy his flat had become; he had no one to impress now, and he was at work more often than he was at home. It hadn’t been a priority for Draco in a long time.
"Healer Julia Wolff's office."
Weasley shifted in his seat, clearly uncomfortable.
But sometimes Potter went out of his way to talk to Draco.
Harry didn’t respond.
“Malfoy?
Leonel nodded, his brows furrowed and impossibly perfect teeth worrying his bottom lip. Then, as soon as it started, the yelling stopped. Potter’s body relaxed and slowly fell back onto the mattress.
He almost seemed to be out of breath.
“They’re still here because they love you, Harry,” said Wolff, looking down at him with a soft expression on her face.
, and Ginny sighed again.
“It’s Malfoy,” Harry said, and that should have been answer enough.
“You can’t force me,” Draco retorted, feeling triumphant.
“All right, Harry?”
Malfoy nodded.
He sat up, grumbling as he freed the note from Noc’s leg, who sat on his pillow importantly. He unrolled the parchment and saw three words scrawled in Ron’s messy handwriting:
“Yes, well, he is very capable, both as a leader and a Healer. Healer-in-Training Burke,” Mitchell said, extending a hand towards Betty, “can testify to this, I’m sure.”
“Mr. Potter, I’ve brought you your dinner,” she was saying happily until she caught the look on Harry’s face. The girl was really an open book, Harry noted distractedly, seeing her concern clear as day as she put the tray down on his nightstand and hurriedly walked over to him. “Are you alright? What’s happened?”
Draco was grateful for Leo's kind words but only scoffed in response. “I don’t need you to counsel me, Leo. I’ve already had enough of that.”
Ira cocked their head, and Draco continued.
accompanied by a photograph of Potter, Granger, and Weasley walking through Diagon Alley. He’d felt a pang of hurt as he looked at it, though he quickly dismissed it. It was Draco’s choice, after all, to distance himself from Potter and consequently their mutual friends.
Betty flushed furiously, glaring daggers at Ira and deftly ignoring Draco.
“Oh, look at the time! I promised Daddy that I’d help him plant new Snargaluff. I’m so sorry, Harry, but I’ve got to go.”
“Fuck,” Draco sighed, covering his face with a hand. “What are we doing?”
"There you are. You certainly took your time, didn't you?"
“Harry-“ Draco began to say, but Harry cut him off.
Harry opened his eyes and hurriedly undid the zipper of Malfoy’s trousers; he was delighted to see Malfoy’s cock spring forward, just as hard as Harry’s. It was long, though not as wide as his own, and surrounded by white blond curls.
“Er, yeah, I-“
“He was nice,” Harry said after a moment. “And he told me…that he probably fancies me back. But he says nothing can happen cos I can’t start any new relationships for a year, apparently.”
“Prat.”
Shivers ran down Draco’s entire body at the sound of Potter’s voice, and he hoped he didn’t look as shaken as he felt as he turned to look at the other man.
Harry did not seem to know. “You’ve never what?”
Harry shoved his hands in his pockets.
"I reckon you’ll have to find those out for yourself,” Harry replied, his throat dry, now moving his hand slowly up and down Draco's length
“Yes,” Harry confirmed.
see the three of them at the tail end of it.
Ginny cried out in frustration, bringing her hands up to her face, wand still clenched in one of them, and pulled back from Harry.
Draco wondered if their guilt-tripping would work. He secretly hoped not.
“To group.”
"Harry, I do have your files right here," she patted a packet labeled "CONFIDENTIAL" that sat threateningly on her desk, "But like I said, I'd rather hear your account of what's happened."
Their ten minutes was up, and Kathy ushered them back to their seats. Samuel nodded before going back to his seat; Harry sat down, feeling rather pleased with himself. It wasn’t easy making friends; in the Wizarding world, people were too awestruck to actually
“Great, thank you, Leo,” Draco replied.
"No," Draco answered. A smile played at his lips. "Quite a good thing, I think."
much. And I’ve found out a lot of things out from articles.” At Harry’s wary look, Estrada conceded, “Which I know aren’t always factual, but it’s still something. You-Know-Who was never that big of a deal in the U.S., but we still heard about major events. Y’know, like…”
“That’s the weird thing about war, isn’t it?” Ron joked, and Hermione glared at him (albeit lovingly).
Draco took out his pack as he walked down to the lake. He had just lit his cigarette when he stopped himself short, ten feet from the water’s edge.
Draco rolled his eyes but stepped back, allowing Harry to come inside. Draco shut the door behind him, and before he even knew what was happening, Harry had wrapped him in a big hug.
“There’s nothing to talk about,” Malfoy said, taking a step backward. “I appreciate your honesty, but I am still your Healer and you are still my patient.”
Ira left before Draco could come up with an excuse or retort.
Draco silently thanked Daphne for her insatiable need to gossip. Pansy's attentions were focused on Daphne now, her would-be interrogation of Draco forgotten.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Hi.”
“Do you?” snapped Draco. Harry looked hurt, and Draco felt a pang of guilt. He took a deep breath. “Sorry. I shouldn’t have – but, Harry – Merlin, what are you doing with me?”
,” he said sharply.
and turned so he was facing Harry, his face screwed up, apparently annoyed at being woken up. He frowned (pouted?) at Harry.
His heart was full, and he was at peace.
Draco scoffed. “It’s been repaid already. You saved me.”
Pansy raised an eyebrow at him, then scooted closer. She placed a manicured hand on his arm.
Oh no oh no oh no -
“Would you like me to escort you back to your room?”
“I think he’ll do just fine. Your loss, Daph.”
“You knew he was going to propose?”
"I never –”
wanted, his entire body trembling with desire.
“I think you meant to say
Draco frowned. Would he really let him touch it? The Cloak of Invisibility?
with Ron and Hermione?”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “I think you’re alright for now. You’ve reverted back to being mean.”
He ground his teeth.
He felt foolish, like an irresponsible baby who couldn’t handle himself in the real world. Harry sat up for a while longer, waiting for someone else to come in.
Spidery letters floated out of her wand and into the air, identifying what foreign chemicals were in his system. Betty gaped, and Draco didn’t blame her – the list was extensive and rather worrying. A good number of the potions induced sleep. Draco tried to ignore the sickening thought that rushed to the forefront of his mind – had Potter tried to commit suicide?
Potter grabbed him after Potions class one day.
“Use your brain, Potter. I generally don’t get undressed for no reason.”
“Who’s there?” he asked sharply, his voice cutting into the stiff silence.
It smelled delicious, and even though Harry had offered to help, Draco insisted that he just sit down and wait.
The scratchy kind of sore that made him wince with every swallow, the kind that came with shoving your fingers down your throat and retching up food that was meant to stay down. But if this was the price he had to pay to feel empty, he’d pay it over and over again. And he did.
"Merlin, Potter, you're so fucking gorgeous," Draco murmured as he began to unbutton his shirt, his grey eyes burning into Harry. He would have been self-conscious if not for the obvious desire in Draco's face.
Draco cleared his throat uncomfortably and asked, “Do they know? About what you told me last night.”
“I’m not saying it is!” he said wildly. Draco was surprised; he’d gotten used to seeing Potter relatively calm over the past few months. “I’m just saying that what he have goes deeper than a childhood rivalry! And it goes beyond my ‘saving people thing.’ We’ve been through too much together for that, Malfoy. You’re not just some classmate, or some person I saved once. You’re…”
Harry’s face heated but he rolled his eyes, knowing Draco was just joking.
“Fuck,” he mumbled.
“What makes you say that?”
His eyes sprung open as he felt one of Potter’s hands rest tentatively on his head. Draco’s whole body tensed as he wondered what could possibly be going through Potter’s brain, and then Potter’s hand started moving,
He didn’t know why he’d put it off for so long. Harry must’ve distracted him.
That seemed far from true.
“I don’t…is this some sort of strange exercise, Potter? Am I meant to look at this until I feel like eating again?”
“Should we sit?” Betty asked, peering up at them from her cranberry vodka.
The woman in the portrait raised her eyebrows but made no comment as she let Harry and Draco into the Gryffindor common room. Draco followed, staring straight ahead, not quite daring enough to look about the room to see who was there.
“As if we don’t see enough blood at work?” Draco asked. Leo made to change it, but Draco shook his head. “It’s fine, leave it.”
“Consider yourself lucky,” Draco sighed. “I’ll have to go back work soon, just in time for the holiday season.”
side. I…you don’t even know the worst of what I’ve done, Potter.”
“With what gold?” Draco hissed. “What with reparations and our Dark valuables confiscated, my family doesn’t have extra money to throw at overpriced Mind Healers. And I’ve
Draco smirked, his grey eyes flitting over to Harry and chest still rising and falling with effort. “I’m glad you liked it. I should’ve asked first, but I just couldn’t resist –“
"You think I'd play a practical joke on you now?"
“Yeah…alright.”
“But you haven’t had any seizures…we would have caught them if you did. Have you been having nightmares?”
He put the business card on his desk and set about Flooing home. He’d do it tomorrow. He sent a Patronus to Betty asking her to administer the nourishment potion to Potter and left.
Estrada grinned then; a grin that Harry had never seen on Estrada’s face before. It was...predatory, almost.
It all sounded a bit mental, Draco knew, but once again, being housemates with the Dark Lord tended to fuck up one's mind.
The next afternoon found Draco in the library with Pansy, doing Arithmancy homework. Books were laid across the five-person table they occupied; parchment, quills, and inkwells surrounded them as well. Pansy was resting her head on her propped-up hand, flipping lazily through a textbook with her free one. Draco was scanning through old notes, trying to find a solution to their problem. Pansy sighed.
The picture of Mind-Healer Wolff smiled gently at him.
“You know what a VCR is?” Harry asked, genuinely surprised.
Pansy gripped his hand.
“Potter,” Blaise Zabini greeted, tipping his head.
“Faster,” he said.
“Later on. When Harry started getting more desperate – when the potions weren’t working as well – he started drinking,” Granger said, looking pained. “Last year. Spring of 2004.”
Draco cast
He’d heard about Harry’s nightmares years before - many students had, but it was one thing to hear about them, and another entirely to be present while he was having one. Harry had mentioned before that he had trouble sleeping, but Draco had no idea it was this severe. He himself had his fair share of nightmares, but this seemed different.
Harry’s face heated, as did Draco’s.
It wasn’t until the next morning that Malfoy came back with openings for an appointment with Dr. Wolff.
“Why’d you stop?” Harry panted, annoyance coloring his voice. “God, why’d you stop? I was-“
Draco paced. Has he absolutely lost it? What was possessing him to tell Astoria that he was…gay? He was terrified that she’d call him disgusting, a freak of nature, wrong. But some part of him also knew that she wouldn’t mind one bit. She seemed more interested in what wasn’t normal, the things and people that weren’t the status quo. But he still couldn’t shake the shame that blanketed him for being wrong. Bad.
you,” Potter said harshly as if the word left a bad taste in his mouth.
"I've picked up on quite a bit, I think," Draco answered quietly, reading Harry's changed body language. "I've listened to you, Harry, and I understand - to an extent, at least. I'm not saying this to hurt you, or be a prat, but because…I don’t like seeing you like this."
“I can cast a Disillusionment charm on you so you don’t draw any unwanted attention. Do you consent to me doing so?”
Draco was too flabbergasted to say anything – Potter, calling him a
Draco crossed his arms, uncomfortable. Harry was regarding him in such a way that made Draco flush.
Tears formed and fell down his face now, and Harry couldn't hold it back anymore. He let out a shuddering breath and his entire body shook with the force of his crying. Ginny kept rubbing his back and staying things like "it's alright" and "let it out."
ready,” Draco muttered.
They kissed for a few more moments, wrapped up in themselves before Harry unwillingly parted and licked his lips.
“Great.”
“Cheers.”
“But tell me about yourself, Harry,” Samuel said, surprising him. When he grimaced, Samuel frowned apologetically. “Just a little? I feel like I hardly know you.”
Draco cleared his throat and began walking again.
"Merlin, you feel good," Draco murmured in a rough voice, and Harry ascended.
to do anything.”
"What?" said Hermione and Draco simultaneously, both caught off guard. They looked at each other uneasily.
“Right, my
“Is…er…he’s quite fit, isn’t he?”
he feel better after sleeping in his bed for the first time in two nights. It was a step up from his desk, and Draco woke up feeling relatively refreshed considering he’d only slept four hours. And it was only ten – excellent. He had enough time to shower and make a quick breakfast before heading back to work.
“Mmph,” Draco said, and he thrusted deeper into Harry.
“Course I do. I probably heard him insult my dead parents or Hermione or you lot at least once a week for six years straight, save holidays.”
But without Auror training, what did that leave him? His friends, of course. And Ginny.
Betty gave him a sympathetic smile and nodded as well. "Alright. Is there anything else I can do for you?"
Draco shook his head. He didn’t much feel like chess anymore.
“Maybe the head over heels part,” Harry answered, and Draco flushed despite himself. “I’ll figure it out, Draco. I’m not saying I’ll tell them today, just…soon.”
“Draco, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you upset. I was just surprised,” she said in a lower voice, uncharacteristically gentle. “You can still tell me anything, you know.”
Draco looked like he was going to fight, but he looked away, his jaw tight. “Fine. Let’s just go.”
Cloak, isn’t it?”
didn’t miss doing it alone. It was boring, and simply put, pathetic.
Astoria’s voice grew soft. “What if Pomfrey didn’t tell her? You’re a legal adult; she’s not required to.”
“I was a bit busy being a junkie, remember?” Harry joked darkly, and regretted the words as soon as they left his mouth.
“Only usually?” Potter’s lips twitched.
Merlin, Potter looked
“Stop it.” Potter’s grip on his arm tightened.
“Fine,” he said amicably enough. “I suppose if I really have to choose, I could eat something.”
"It's off-season."
He hadn’t expected Potter to be standing there, wrapped up in that scarf of his, hands in his pockets. Potter turned at the sound of Draco’s footsteps and smiled softly. Draco walked over to him, taking a deep drag as he did so. As he got closer, he noticed that Potter was wearing a dark knit cap, and that he looked (predictably) wonderful in it. Draco exhaled slowly, watching the smoke as it left his mouth.
“Right,” Potter said again. He looked down. “I reckon I understand. It’s just frustrating.”
“That’s what he told me,” shrugged Draco. And then he asked, “Is it strange for you? That he’s seeing your ex?”
Draco took a moment to take in the sight before him, his heart thudding wildly underneath his chest. He then undid his own trousers and pushed them down, finally allowing his cock to be exposed. His cock was close to throbbing now, yearning to be satisfied. Wand – he needed his wand. He didn’t think Harry would have lube lying around.
He still recalled how cold his mother’s hands were when she had stroked his tender face later that night. He cried in her lap, blubbering about how he was scared and he’d done something to upset Father. She hushed him and explained that the way he’d spoken about other boys was inappropriate and he had to stop if he didn’t want to upset Father again. This only furthered his confusion, but he kept silent.
“You haven’t seen any bottles, have you? I’m fine,” Harry said truthfully. “I’ve…been sleeping loads better…since you.”
His head spun.
to know what went on in his mind, least of all Malfoy. It was strange enough spilling his long-kept secrets to a virtual stranger.
Draco knelt onto his office floor and tossed some Floo powder into the small fireplace.
“What – what are you doing here?”
“You’re drunk, Malfoy.”
An hour later found Draco sorting through all of his notes on Potter, compiling them into one condensed document for Healer Wolff. He had a hospital owl fly it over to her in a neat package stamped “CONFIDENTIAL.”
Harry didn’t do much. He’d dropped out of Auror training about a half year into it. Ron finished training and was a fully-fledged Auror for about a year before dropping out as well and going to work with George instead. Hermione had gone back to school to make up for her absent year, and was now working for the Ministry, working to advance creature rights. Ron and Hermione loved what they did, and Harry was both proud and bitter.
Potter seemed to be listening to what Draco was saying, which was a good sign, but he still didn’t look happy.
The headache was coming back.
Slowly, he said, “We have to do this right. If anything happens – anything – I’ll never forgive myself.”
“You just did it again,” Harry half-laughed. When Draco made to say something, Harry hurriedly said, “It’s really just me being stupid about it. It’s not a big deal, Draco.”
The cigarette burned him.
Potter laughed, and he could feel Astoria rolling her eyes at the both of them. Draco smiled softly, feeling warmth spread through him that might not have wholly been from the alcohol.
“Thank you.”
He never brought it up to them, nor they to him. He never spoke about it to anyone, not Pansy, not Vincent, not Greg. Not Astoria. Definitely not Potter.
“Healer Malfoy?” Wolff asked, her eyebrows raised.
"So what are you going to do about it?"
“Brunch,” he answered. “Every Saturday morning, we meet up and have brunch.”
It was an ugly sight. He felt his torso and arms were too long, bones sticking out of the wrong places. He ribs jutted out, stretching out the pale, sallow skin that covered them. If he did eat, he’d have an unsightly pouch
They lapsed into silence. Draco stared out across the lake, thinking about what Potter had said.
I've been reading smut almost exclusively lately and I think it's accidentally come out here hope ya don't mind lol 😘
the liquor on your breath.”
“I’m staying as well,” Draco answered, thankful for Potter for picking up the conversation again, and then immediately felt uneasy again because he didn’t exactly feel like discussing
“Well, er, that was nice,” attempted Harry.
He threw open the doors of the closest bathroom he could find and rushed into the first stall. Locking it with trembling hands, he faced the toilet and bent forward. He brought his right hand to his mouth and stuck his index and middle fingers inside. It was only a few moments until he was
He scratched absently at his left forearm. “Is it enough?”
Harry’s heart ached.
Draco had to refrain from rolling his eyes once again – where’d Harry even learn these awful lines? – and instead took a disinterested sip of his decaf.
“Harry, could you help me with this?” Hermione called, shaking Harry out of his thoughts.
Harry looked at him strangely.
“Ginny?” Potter asked, surprised. “She’s still…somewhere.” He looked around behind him before stilling and leaning forward slightly. “Is that…her with
A knock at the door made Draco jump. He spared a glance in the mirror and quickly flattened his hair. And then he realized he was still wearing his pajamas. They were fine for himself and for his home, but for Harry? He agonized over it for a few moments before giving up and going to answer the door, already embarrassed.
Draco was about to choose ‘reply’ when his phone buzzed. He paused and opened the new message.
Potter took out Draco’s wand out of his pocket and held it out for him.
Harry considered this. She was right – with the Cloak, he’d be able to go outside without having to worry about being seen. His heartrate sped up at the thought of finally being able to see something other than the walls of his hospital room. Still, something was holding him back.
“Did Pansy send you?”
Draco kissed him once more before taking back his hand and dropping to the ground himself, right next to Harry.
“And you’re beautiful,” Potter said, and kissed him on the lips.
They were walking back to the castle after the game. Granger and Weasley were with a larger group further back, leaving the two to talk privately. Every time their elbows bumped, a small thrill went through Draco. If it wasn’t obvious before, Draco had it bad.
“Any nausea?”
Draco jumped violently when he felt a hand on his shoulder. His widened eyes stared at it for a long moment before moving to Potter, who was gazing at him seriously. Chills ran down his back as he struggled for words. Potter beat him to it.
. Feeling too weak to stand up just yet, he pushed himself to the closest wall, wanting to get out of the way. He gingerly placed a hand on his left side and winced. Draco could feel the welt already swelling slowly, painful to the touch.
“Pleasantly,” replied Pansy.
Draco was already groaning as he turned around to face Blaise, but he was shocked into silence by his companion. It seemed the same had happened to Astoria, who had also swiveled in her seat.
“It’s a nice color,” he told her.
His name always sounded slightly peculiar when Leonel said it. It wasn't bad - just different.
When Malfoy gave him a look, Harry continued. “What? I’ve got a right to know if I’m dying or not, don’t I?”
Harry gave a wry smile. “I’m trying to work on it, is all I’m saying.”
“I – er, have to take a piss,” Harry mumbled before making a swift getaway.
Harry tried to think of other symptoms he might be experiencing, but those were the only three he could come up with. Well, aside from having a conversation with a business card, but Estrada didn't need to know that.
“Good evening, all. Who would like to start us off today?” she asked, her eyes scanning the group.
The answer came easily, surprising Draco, and surprising Pansy by the looks of it too. He realized he hadn’t felt this happy - this alive - in ages. Pansy seemed to realize this too, and her face softened.
He swallowed thickly and took off his glasses to wipe away the moisture from his face, feeling like an overlarge toddler. He let go of Ginny and sat up straight, finding it difficult to look her in the eyes.
, there'd at least be a reason for all of this. Not being made for the living world."
“I’ve missed you,” Harry mumbled lowly.
"Er. Um, you know how I've been going to group, right?"
“Of course, Miss Granger.”
Weasley looked over to Granger for help.
“Still, I can’t just
"I never asked for this!" Draco exploded. "I never asked for you to - to save me or whatever it is you're doing."
He was definitely pissed. More so than Draco, which made him feel better.
“Hey Luna.”
Harry then realized why Draco was so shocked - he had just spoken about how he could hardly bear to go to the Manor, his old home. He got panic attacks from finding old letters, while Harry welcomed reminders of the people who once lived here. Sure, this place reminded Harry of bad times, but of good ones too. Besides, what other home did he have? (Well Hogwarts, but he couldn’t bloody well live there).
“All done. You seem to be perfectly healthy,” said Malfoy after a moment. “I’ll go owl Ginevra – she should be here shortly.”
Ginny raised an eyebrow. “You might want to tell Malfoy, then.”
"Potter," he nodded, still wondering what he was supposed to say, albeit feeling a bit more reassured. Finally, he decided to go with, "Is it true? I was the master of the Elder wand?"
“Well done, everyone,” Hermione said once they’d all parted. “It was getting a bit too heavy for my liking.”
“I know,” Draco sighed. “I just also know that she won’t like it.”
Potter was sat on the ground in front of the fireplace, lounging in a hoodie and sweatpants, his dark hair even wilder than usual. He was surprised, by the look of his face, and had expected to see Draco as much as Draco had expected to see him – that was, not at all. Potter sat up a little straighter, using the low table behind him as support for his back.
The only sound was the crunching of snow underneath their feet and birds calling out above them. They continued their trek around the lake in silence, anxiety starting to bubble up within Draco again.
“Yeah, think so.” That had to be Weasley. “It’s weird, he’s usually up by now.”
Draco stood outside the Muggle patisserie with trepidation. He peered inside through the windows, his hands stuffed in his coat pockets. It was fairly busy, people of all ages going in and out with coffee and pastries. He could catch a glimpse of bright red hair towards the back of the shop.
“Good morning, Harry.” Wolff was sitting behind her desk with impeccable posture and a small albeit kind smile.
“Hey, Hermione,” Harry grinned sheepishly. He picked up his shirt off the floor and pulled it on. “Sorry. It was, er, hot. Hi, Rose.”
“Still pointy, though,” said Ron.
“It’s alright,” Estrada replied. “I know it’s a part of healing, and I shouldn’t have argued with you-“
“And you too, Greengrass Junior.”
“You don’t really see any other kinds popping up, do you?” Malfoy sneered drunkenly. “What, you think I’d found a nice group in Hogsmeade, or Knockturn Alley, or, or – “
“I’ll see you tonight,” Harry said.
Draco pondered this for another moment before asking, "So are we...properly dating, then?"
“So what
He did feel ashamed, though. He couldn’t stop feeling shameful and guilty and dirty and unworthy and tired and a thousand other things he wished he didn’t feel. Draco took a deep breath, steeling himself.
Ginny seemed to understand, patting his thigh once more before standing and refilling his glass with a silent
They had assembled their bed first, for obvious reasons.
Potter was silent, his eyes searching.
Draco spent the rest of the day wondering what he could have done to upset Potter so much, which might have been fine if actual lives weren’t depending on him. Even as he looked at other patients and consulted with Leo and Betty, some part of him was going mad trying to think what he might’ve done to wrong Potter.
“G’night,” Potter said. He paused and cocked his head just a bit. “Draco.”
from the oversharing.”
Hermione glared half-heartedly at him. “Oh, shut up, Malfoy.”
Draco gave a weak laugh and bid Ira goodbye.
“Thanks, Draco,” Granger said softly. “We don’t doubt you.”
Draco made them both scrambled eggs, toast, and sausage.
Potter nodded reassuringly, and Draco hesitantly reached out fully and stroked the Cloak, surprised by how worn-out it felt.
Draco advanced on him, his anger winning out over his shame. “And you still haven’t learned to shut your mouth about things you know nothing about. You better watch that fat mouth, Weasley, or I’ll-“
He stared at him, trying to figure out if he was being serious. But he must’ve been. The way Harry was gazing at him was so intense it was clear it was anything but a joke.
Harry swallowed his bite of eggs before answering.
Draco and Astoria were just passed the Great Hall doors into the corridor when they heard hurried footsteps behind them. He turned, already knowing who it was, and couldn’t stop a smile from taking over his face.
The four of them found a table towards the back and sat down.
pathetic or weak or disgusting."
Draco seemed skeptical.
“What does it matter?”
Draco nodded and sat up slightly.
“Er, well, I’ll get the ingredients, then,” Potter said uncertainly.
“What about you?”
“Alright. Well done, Draco.” She gave him a grim smile. “Let’s hope we never see Mr. Potter again.”
His entire body shuddered as Draco pushed inside, slowly and carefully. Harry closed his eyes, relaxing and loosening around Draco.
He wrote a simple letter, professional and to the point, and gave it to one of the hospital’s owls.
“No, it’s nice,” Harry said truthfully. “There’s nothing to do here. At least in Muggle hospitals they have tellys.”
“You don’t need to-“
There was a sudden knock at the door, making Harry jump a little.
“But surely you communicate each and every thought to your bosom friends. Don’t break wizarding Britain’s heart, now, Potter.”
“Thanks, Gin.”
“Thanks,” was all Harry could muster.
“Alright then, what
He turned towards the other two and nodded curtly in their general direction, unwilling to make eye contact. Draco felt their eyes on him as he walked away, taking out the carton of cigarettes as he did so.
“Can’t or don’t want to?”
Potter, on the other hand, had hardly been seen in the past five years. His disappearance hadn’t stopped

“Whatever, Potter,” Malfoy mumbled.
“I know what I'm feeling.”
“It’s – “ Weasley scratched his head, apparently formulating his words. “Hermione and I know he’s been having trouble after – after everything, but he won’t really talk about it with us. So I’m just glad that he does have someone to talk to.”
Estrada looked away again, avoiding Harry’s eyes. The same as before – something tugged at Harry. What was it?
“You don’t need to say anything, Draco,” Harry said, releasing him. He sounded more like his usual self now – more collected, less distressed. He looked at Draco a moment, though Draco wasn’t sure how much Harry could actually see without his glasses on. “Really. I, er, talking is good. I’m not saying I’m magically cured or anything, but it helps.”
Harry's otherwise ordinary dream was interrupted by Draco's insistent hiss of his name, a frantic, female voice, and the mutterings of a little house elf.
Leonel's mouth slipped away, and for a second, there was nothing. And then Leo’s hand grasped his cock firmly and began working it up and down, fast and rough. Draco found Leo’s hair and pulled hard. Leonel looked up at him and flashed that horrible wolfish grin, his eyes fixed on Draco’s own. Draco took a sharp intake of breath and managed to say, “Fuck me.”
"I didn't mean offense, I simply meant –" Malfoy retaliated, giving an impatient sigh.
He’d have days when all he could do was snap impatiently at people because he was so irritated, and days where he couldn’t get out of bed, and days where he’d stumble through life in a haze, untouched by everything – completely numb.
“Oh,” Harry said. “That’s good.”
“Keep going,” Harry answered his unspoken question. “Just surprised.”
“Draco…”
“Yeah, well, I do,” Ron said uncomfortable. He turned to speak to Harry again. “Point is you should stay here so you can do it properly. Then you can leave.”
Draco nearly fell over. That hadn’t been the reaction he’d been expecting.
“Yes, I probably should had gone earlier than that,” Draco confessed, “But I wasn’t ready for it so soon after the War. And then my studies took over, and it was only until I’d gotten comfortable in my position as a Healer that I couldn’t ignore it all anymore.”
He crawled back under the covers and took off his glasses, wanting to sleep and forget everything.
“Did you find out who it is?” Ron asked. “The mystery bloke?”
George nodded. “Business has picked up again since Hogwarts has started.”
Harry was stifling his laughter badly.
“Right.”
“But if it would make you feel better, you
“No, everything’s fine, everyone was perfectly civil, don’t worry,” Draco said, taking her wand arm and pulling gently. “Come on, let’s go.”
Blaise nodded, his arm wrapping around her shoulders. He smoothed her long hair away from her face carefully. Draco could easily see the adoration in Blaise’s eyes, something he never thought he’d witness.
He sat up and realized it was Harry’s room. Did that mean...? He turned to his side but saw no one there. Draco let out a sigh of relief. He was alone in what had to be Harry’s bed. But then where was Harry?
Harry made a disbelieving
Draco finished right after, his fingernails clawing into Harry's lower back and seemingly staying quiet only with great effort. Slowly, he pulled out of Harry, leaving him sticky and dripping.
“It’s good to see you, too,” Harry said, grinning.
“Yes, of course,” he cut over her quickly, suddenly wanting to leave Wolff’s office. “Thank you, Healer Wolff.”
“Really?”
“So Mr. Potter has been released?”
Draco choked on nothing.
Draco froze, and the weight grew heavier. It sounded like a terrible idea, but he wasn’t about to say so. Potter wanted so badly for all of them to get along, but Draco didn’t know if it was possible. He couldn’t even stand himself; how could he expect the people he’d been horrible to for ages to like him?
“Draco,” said Harry, and when Draco turned to face him, he leaned in to kiss Draco gently. When they parted, Harry looked intently at Draco, their faces barely an inch apart and foreheads pressed together. Draco could feel Harry’s breath on his face. “I trust you too.”
"Relapse is common in addiction treatment, with relapse rates being between 40 and 60 percent" (NIDA)
Luna nodded sympathetically.
“You seemed to think I was repulsed by your, um…” Draco trailed off. He didn’t want to say ‘crush,’ he
“Well for one, I wouldn’t have to look at your stupid pointy face anymore.”
“They were probably heading off to breakfast,” Potter mused confidently.
“I thought you were going to say something more interesting,” Astoria frowned. “You alright, Draco?”
He watched Potter’s face carefully as he read through the letter. There was mostly confusion on his face, but when he finished, he looked back up at Draco with a gentle expression.
“Not like what?” he asked, caught off guard and his face now hot.
“Stop it,” Draco said, watching as Harry grew tenser. “It doesn’t matter.”
“I won’t,” Draco sighed. “I just hope
“Look!” Hermione squealed in a most un-Hermione-like way, brandishing her hand in Harry’s face.
Harry looked away, embarrassed. He could admit she had a point – he’d never been to St. Mungo’s for
It was bound to happen. Of course it was. Potter and Malfoy, potions partners once again. It was like they were third years all over again. Only now, Draco didn’t have the upper hand.
“Harry!” Ron greeted enthusiastically. He patted the empty seat that was next to him. “Siddown, mate.”
Draco wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but it wasn’t this. Harry Potter felt connected to him, Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater. The words echoed in his head over and over again in Potter’s voice.
. That’s not any of their business.”
“Your concern is touching, Potter, but perhaps you should focus your rescue efforts on someone else. Someone who actually wants it.”
He assessed the damage. Yes, the window was cracked. Wasn’t he supposed to lose the ability to do wandless magic now that Voldemort was dead?
“Do I know him?”
This was all a terrible mistake. The whole school would find out. The entire wizarding world!
Rose did so.
“Is it time to talk about it?”
“Harry, are you ready?”
Potter led him through the busy stands, ignoring the looks passersby gave them. Draco kept his eyes glued on Potter’s back. Potter was wearing a dark red jumper and his Gryffindor scarf today. Draco stared at the jumper, trying to ignore everything else around them.
“It seems like the rumor that you dislike your fame is in fact true.”
Potter looked two seconds away from pulling his hair out, and it was exactly how Draco had felt on the inside.
“I was puzzled, as I think anyone would be, and asked him why he was lurking about and following me. He said he needed a distraction.” Draco frowned at this. “So I took his to the lounge and made him tea.”
As soon as he had shut the door, he was ambushed by Granger and Weasley.
Hermione frowned at the mention of his visions, her eyes turning hard. She looked down at her mug, her hands wrapped tightly around it.
Potter was gritting his teeth and avoiding Draco’s gaze. Draco was taken aback – out of everything he had guessed, this was not one of them. Shock quickly turned to confusion.
“Thank you, Healer Mitchell. We appreciate your efforts,” Granger replied.
“Thanks,” Abigail said shyly.
Harry felt a flurry of emotions at once – joy at seeing them, embarrassment that it was like this, guilt that they looked so upset. He’d caused them so much trouble.
“Well, Ron and Hermione asked me what I was doing for winter break, and when I told them I didn’t know until I asked you, they were surprised to say the least.” Harry paused, a slight grimace on his face. “So they asked why it mattered so much if you were staying or not, and since I didn’t have a good enough answer, they kept asking. And then, y’know, short temper and all that…so I told them that, funnily enough, I cared where my boyfriend was going to be for two weeks, and if I could, I’d like to be with him during that time.” Harry paused again. “That got them quiet, but it also got half the common room quiet as well.”
“It’s been a while since I’ve been in here,” Harry said, glancing around the room. “You said Zabini was going to be gone the entire day?”
“Malfoy,” he said, clearing his throat.
When he opened his mouth, her brown eyes fixed him with a glare and she answered his unasked question. “Down the loo.”
Rage rose within him, and Draco actually snarled as he got even closer to Weasley, whose ears were turning a bright red.
After thanking Kathy for the cake, the three men waited at the exit for Cait and Malfoy.
This is when he slowly slid his mouth off Harry’s cock, letting his tongue slide all the way up as he did so.
“You need help,” Draco told him.
Draco nodded, speechless for once, and reached over to the bedside cabinet to retrieve the lube. He slathered it on his hands in record time and soon his slick fingers were pumping inside Harry.
He wondered if Ira was going to be in today. Draco hoped they would be because he really needed to talk to
Draco met Ira’s gaze again; the soft expression on their face implored Draco to go on.
Draco hadn’t been able to go back to sleep afterwards despite it being four o’clock in the morning. He tried in vain, rolling around in bed for a good half hour before giving up and heading to the bathroom. He pulled off the shirt that was stuck to his skin and the boxers that were caging his budding erection. Draco turned the tap so the water would be scalding hot, hoping to rub away the residual feeling of Potter's hand on his face.
“Oh,” Harry said, not knowing if this was a yes or a no.
“If you want to,” Draco said. He took a deep breath and looked away, his eyes hard. “I’m sorry. I don’t know how to talk about this. It’s your choice.”
Harry had even managed to organize a triple date of sorts on Friday evening – him and Draco, Ron and Hermione, and Ginny and Luna. Harry was bouncing with nerves when the day came around, Draco patting him in an effort to calm him down.
"Thank you," Harry said, and Kreacher bowed and excused himself. He turned to Draco, his face growing warm. "Hey."
He half-heard Hermione explain what it was, making Harry feel even worse. His face was burning up more and more as she spoke, and soon he felt like he was drowning in shame.
"What were you thinking?" Draco hissed at him, though not angrily.
He gritted his teeth and trained his eyes to the floor. Harry wondered what his parents would think of him if they knew what he’d become. If they knew where he was and why. Would they still be proud of him? Or would they be disappointed? Perhaps even disgusted at the way he turned out? At the way he spoke about them so coarsely?
“Wait,” he said quickly, scrambling to his feet. “You won’t tell anyone about this, will you?”
Blaise nodded knowingly. “I figured. Could you do me the pleasure of telling me who it is?”
Draco almost smiled to himself, belatedly realizing just how abnormal his mindset had become. He looked up with the intention of pretending to pay attention to McGonagall, but his gaze caught on Potter, who was sat two rows up and to the left of Draco and was staring at him intently.
Potter stood back from the railing and made to leave. Draco turned and forced himself to finally look Potter in the eye. Merlin, he was breathtaking.
“Mad to think about, isn’t it?” Potter said wryly. “If someone told me ten years ago that I’d be sitting and having a cuppa with Draco Malfoy at two-thirty A.M. without trying to kill each other, I would’ve laughed in their face.”
By then, Harry was desperate and pleading. "Please please just put it inside me, I need you now, Draco, god -"
“Fuck,” Draco hissed to himself under his breath.
did – during the act, but it was all temporary. After he was done, after the ‘high,’ all he was left with was the visceral disgust for himself and massive guilt.
“No need to apologize, Potter,” Draco said. “I’m not really sober myself.”
Potter snickered too, then, and soon the both of them were laughing.
Draco swallowed thickly. “You’re – you’re welcome, Potter.”
“No, it wasn’t filthy in the slightest!” he exclaimed as loudly as he could in the environment. He relaxed and said softly, “It was quite the opposite, actually.”
Harry looked extremely flustered. Draco almost felt bad, but then remembered all the times Harry had demanded information from him.
A few weeks ago, he stumbled across the email she had sent him that day. He visited all the websites she had supplied him with, figuring he had nothing better to do with his time.
“How’d you know having my life threatened turned me on,
“I’m kidding, Malfoy,” Weasley said. He turned serious; it was off-putting. “Harry’s right - we’re not kids anymore.”
Slowly, carefully, Harry traced the patterns with his free hand, Draco's soft skin underneath his fingers.  Looking closer now, he could see raised edges along the border of the Dark Mark, bleeding into the tattoo, sharp and deliberate, but none on the Mark itself. Harry's heart ached as he stared at them, trying to imagine Draco doing it to himself. And before he knew what he was doing, he raised Draco's arm and kissed the ink, both good and bad.
Harry nodded and drank down the glass of water Malfoy had handed to him. Once he gave it back to Malfoy, he said, “Sorry, did you say Healer?”
“Maybe.”
“Er, yeah.”
A week after that, he told Hermione about it over breakfast. Thrilled, she got up to embrace him and told him how glad she was. Ron nodded and congratulated him too, though Harry knew he was still rather confused about the whole concept of support groups.
“And about the, ah, forest situation?”
Draco nodded a greeting at both Granger and her daughter. He crossed his arms. “We didn’t know you’d be over so soon.”
“Well,” said Draco, “If we’re going to have brunch with Granger and Weasley, I’ve got to make a good impression, don’t I?”
As soon as Kathy called for break, Cait seemed to appear right in front of Harry and Draco, her arms crossed and a wide smile on her face.

“Good,” beamed Granger. “I’ll let Ginny know. We’re planning on eight at the Dotted Lamb.”
One day, Ron and Hermione were visiting when Hermione spotted it. She was overjoyed and proceeded to pull her own out of that beaded bag of hers. Ron examined the laptops, clearly confused. Harry and Hermione tried to explain them to Ron, but he simply shook his head and muttered about how his dad should have come instead.
“Dealing?” he asked.
“Now we only have our final papers left,” Draco said, gathering his notes and placing them neatly in his bag. “For this class, at least.”
Draco finally gave Harry his full attention, stunned by what he had just said.
“Well. It’s hardly surprising,” Draco said after a moment. “Change in professors can only do so much.”
, Harry thought for what was possibly the millionth time.
“No,” Draco said, taken aback. “You never are.”
"No, no, I want to go. Could Draco come too?”
“Yeah?”
And that, Draco thought, was his cue to go to bed. Slowly, shakily, he stood up, using the stall wall as support. Potter mimicked him, brushing off his Muggle trousers.
“I’m hoping you’ll consent to staying here a bit longer. It would highly increase your chances of recovery, as there’s nothing for you to relapse on here. And, if you begin to feel more severe symptoms, you can receive almost instant care.”
Draco gave a little laugh. “Yes, she would be.”
She pulled him over to a surprisingly impressive drinks station, one of the low study tables transfigured into a wide table that held all sorts of beverages. Butterbeer, firewhiskey, eggnog, some sort of punch (undeniably spiked), and even water were all laid out haphazardly, ready for the taking.
“Takes one to know one, apparently. Oh – but don’t worry, Potter, I can confirm that you’re essentially the same person you were at fifteen – angry, incoherent, pigheaded,” Malfoy listed, counting them off on his thin fingers. There was a mean sneer on his face. “Congratulations on not having grown at all these past few years.”
Draco looked back up at his reflection. He had rolled up his sleeves in the heat of the moment and grimaced, quickly rolling them down again. The Mark was faint now, but to Draco, it always seemed to draw the eye.
There was no Hermione. Pansy did not enroll in Hogwarts, and Blaise lived in England. Nor was Nott, who passed him his homework when he was too busy.
-Excellent. McGonagall walked over to Harry Slytherin and placed his hat on his untamed hair.
Harry, brave — or maybe stupid blinded by jealousy — leaned closer to Draco and kissed him hard. When he felt that Draco did not reject him, he continued his contact with more intensity, reaching into Draco's cloak to caress the other's firm body over the clothing. He didn't think that was happening, and to be honest, he could die very happy in that moment if his nemesis wanted to curse him after that.
Ginny, so sweet, so understanding, and so reckless, dared to shape it real for the first time.
And that made him furious.
Even if it's in a twisted way.
It was clear that the last one was not because he wanted it ...
"Uhm, no sir." Harry stood on tiptoe to reach the counter, reminding him that he actually needs some kind of nutritional care or anything that makes him even four inches taller than a seven-year-old, and she bit her lip. My ... my letter about school told me I had to come here and then ... go to an alley?
"Very Hufflepuff Draco?"
Notes:
And so, despite Malfoy claiming at first that he had to be somewhere else, he argued (politely) with Ron about why the Appleby Arrows were better in technique than the Chudley Cannons but had worse equipment until Hermione, half an hour earlier. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, he had approached his compartment.
What if his parents hadn't consented to him the way they did?
He wasn't that interested in the house cup - hey, it wasn't his world in the first place - but what he did care about, to the degree of giving himself with all his heart and soul, was helping Draco Malfoy smile for everyone. possible causes; like when he was informed that, for those remaining points, Slytherin now led the annual house competition.
With the letter well hidden between his waist and his pants that were held around him by a rope, Harry approached his aunt, taking advantage of the fact that Dudley and Vernon had left. He actually had no way (legal, anyway) to get close to the Leaky Cauldron, and he actually needed to start moving himself.
Was Draco really there?
Although he was a bit in conflict because he recognized that perhaps, in other circumstances, he would have wanted to meet the Hermione of his world, just to know if it was worth treating and getting involved with her; Because the Hermione of this world was a nice person, they talked a lot when they were together, and it was refreshing to meet someone else who was just as smart as Draco.

Although Harry did not say a word to him, he did not greet him in the great hall, much less choose him as a classmate in class; but he felt like his eyes were always following him. At times, he felt like prey in the eyes of the predatory Harry.
"Of course, of course." Ollivander looked a bit annoyed, but moved to look for his wand with gusto.
"I was afraid I wouldn't meet you today…" he whispered back, feeling relief in his body as he said what was troubling him. He saw Draco blush, and wondered if this wasn't the most beautiful thing in life.
He couldn't deny that he had his doubts; Harry Slytherin created a diary since the Draco of that reality, passed away, ergo, if that had not happened, he would never have dared to cross so much to get to his side. Sometimes he even felt that he was just a substitute, a copy.
Everyone but him.
"You were with the other ... you went out on a date and they kissed." Harry was just whispering, he didn't know how to feel, maybe a little jealousy and doubt, but he definitely won the surprise for having him there in front of him.
He flew towards them and only managed to see the victorious smile of the other Harry saying three words in a serious and possessive voice.
—The day we finished making the diary, I tore off a piece of paper and put it in my raincoat after writing something ... I remembered that you taught me how to use it, and I knew that what I wrote would be activated as soon as you wrote something, like a continuity spell.
"I foolishly followed you here," he said, showing an annoyed face this time. And you deliberately came back here without telling me something.
Anger consumed him completely. Anger, sadness, revenge for harming a loved one was the main engine for the fight against Voldemort to be final.
Ron and Hermione met each other's eyes for an instant, avoiding their gaze full of questions. That only happened when they wanted to hide something from him, and he couldn't help but think of something more serious that Gryffindor had lost.
"Honestly no," Harry replied, moving closer to Draco, but still not touching him. I just ... I don't want you to disappear ...
And all that was disappearing the instant he saw Draco entering the main street, dressed in elegant black suit pants and a gray Oxford shirt that gave him that aristocratic air even when he was not wearing a ball gown. Her hair was loosely combed, as if she had just taken the brush and was pulling it back to give it shape and class.
"Sure, it won't kill you to return the favor by buying me some sandwiches, right?" Draco said, showing him the scroll that he had already memorized. While he promised to be a better person, that did not include doing charity.
"Isn't it obvious, Potter?" When Harry didn't reply, Malfoy rolled his eyes, but his posture changed slightly as he began to explain. Any pureblood who marries a muggle, a mudblood, a half-breed, or simply does not respect blood supremacy, are considered blood traitors.
"No one knew you, I decided to do some research and apparently your parents enrolled you in Dumstrang there," Harry replied. That was the first world I came to, and there was no point in being there.
What had happened?
It might have been a simple question asked by an innocent Ronald Weasley out of curiosity at the time, but the whole room darkened, the office lights flickered and dimmed, and the air coming in through the window seemed colder.
If there was one thing that Draco hated, it was the resentful or pitying looks that more than one person gave him when he walked through the corridors of the newly built Hogwarts; although faced with that, he couldn't really do much, at least not with all his past in tow. He was determined to finish the entire Eighth Grade course at the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and no one could stop him. After the war, the Malfoy family was put on trial to debate full or partial involvement with the plans and affinity for Voldemort; the fact that his mother decided to lie to the Dark Lord - regarding Potter's supposed death - and that he failed to assassinate Dumbledore - in addition to Harry's endorsement as a witness to both events - was enough to exonerate them from all guilt. He would never admit it out loud, but he was eternally grateful to Potter for it.
"Just curious, again." Harry thought of something else he wanted to know, but his mind was blank right now. He wished he had Hermione with him. So I think ... that's it?
Was this how her other self felt after losing Draco?
He smiled when he saw that the other was completely silent. If he had learned anything from the pompous Gryffindors in his world — and in any other that has lasted more than a few days — it was how pretentious they were, donning a cape of heroes; each of them would want to take the title of whoever was the savior of the day, feeling that, without them, the team would not work.
"How was your herbology session today?" He asked with mock disinterest as he sat on his bed and brought a handful of treats to his mouth.
Perhaps he was the catalyst when he arrived in that world and, in some way, made him see the obvious competition he had and the immediate possibilities of not acting. But let Merlin judge him if that wasn't funny; his heart fluttered at the slight waves of magic that the other Harry released without being aware of it, because it only happened when he saw him or Draco.
Harry nodded, and only began to move again when Mrs. Weasley turned her attention to Ron. He went without thinking too much to the carriage he always used near the end of the train and, thanking the featherweight rune that Mr. Ganvel, who sold him a trunk, placed for him, carried it easily into the compartment and placed it in the corner, where I knew it wouldn't bother. He sat up, and feeling being watched, he looked up to see the twins staring at him from their compartment door.
"If you insist," Bustlesong shrugged, and a scroll with a quill appeared on the desk in front of him. She stared at him. Do you have a request, Mr. Potter?
Too far-fetched if you were asked, but everything was to return to the normality that he knew before that madness began.
Not to mention that he was quite jealous of the evident devotion the deceased Draco received.
"Harry told me how he feels about you," Hermione said, breaking into her train of thought. I was really surprised… and now I see that this Harry also has feelings for you.
"I'll wait for you to be late, that's how they scold us both together."
"Are you sure it's for the best?" Ron's voice was heard coming out of the room that Draco wanted to enter.
"The Gringotts Bank, and yes," Tom beckoned to him and they both headed towards the back of the bar, Tom pulling out his wand when they reached the brick wall, and Harry grinned. He actually missed the place. I don't remember much the pound prices on galleons, but hope it catches up with you. I'll save you a room. When you finish your shopping, just come back and I'll take you there, will you be okay? '' Tom seemed hesitant to let him go alone, but he hit the pattern on the bricks anyway and the wall swung open, exposing Diagon Alley. He smiled at Harry's astonished gasp.
Draco's face broke again, feeling the cadence of his pelvis desecrating him over and over again. She reached out to kiss him, wanting to seal their pact with the purest act he could offer; He remembered the first time he kissed him, on his bed, feeling just a little of the sweet honey from his lips ... and now, he even bite hard at those places that were kissed by other people, erasing any trace of them, leaving only marks of love for him.
Although, when the questions came about who made him feel good, who made his heart beat with glee or with which he felt confident enough to throw himself into the void and trust to be caught ...
"I'm not a bloody Slytherin to hold a grudge," she replied, looking at him with a frown.
"Believe me, as soon as I have it ready, I'll go." The other was unfazed one bit by all the residual magic, one filled with dark energy. But not without taking what is mine .
