"You're not going to tell me to be careful, threaten me if I hurt him, or tell me not to get involved with him?" Draco was amazed when Hermione only continued to laugh, this time sounding light and genuine.
"Well, what are you then?" Ginny demanded and chorus of "yeah" and "go on show us" could be heard until Harry finally gave in, raising his hand to silence everyone first and insure that he had all of their attention. Without any effort, Harry stepped forward, turning mid step into a beautiful black panther with green eyes and a scar just above his eyes.
"I think I should head to bed. It's been a long day." Draco said quickly as he made for the door.
"That was the hottest thing ever." Harry whispered in English this time to Draco could understand him, the blond only moaned in response, snuggling closer to the warm arms lulling him to sleep. "Thank you."
"What for?" Draco asked surprised and Harry continued to give him his dazzling smile.
"This was truly an amazing meal." Harry said after his last bite, smiling at Draco over the dimming candle light.
"Yes well, I have come to the conclusion that there will come a time when I and some of the others in our Order will no longer be able to stay here. Especially when he's gone, Voldemort will have far less to fear and will most likely strike." Snape had read those assumptions in the notes as well and assumed that there was more to it than what Harry had shared with his fellow Order members. "I need to arrange a meeting with Bill Weasley. Of course I would normally ask Ron for his help, but this is something I need to do without alerting them first."
Neville nodded and smiled, collecting the dirty dishes and rejoining his friends in the loud kitchen. A quick glance showed worried looks from both Severus and Draco and he smiled to them and nodded to show that all was well. The pair visibly sagged with relief at the slight gesture and Neville accepted the fresh mug of tea that Luna handed him in favor of handing over the dirty dishes.
"I was actually going to head out for a bit, when will we be having dinner so I can be back in time?" Draco asked Harry interrupting his thoughts.
“We can work on creating another room while Hermione and Blaise do the charms on the store room so it will be ready for them when they’re done.” Ginny said and Neville and Ron nodded, volunteering to help.
“What’s wrong, love?” Draco asked again, though he was getting up from their bed and throwing on clothes that were scattered around the room. They had fallen asleep after their enthusiastic lovemaking and it was just past dinner. They had managed to sleep through the whole day that they had used the time turner to get back. If he was lucky, both Hermione and Severus would be at dinner, getting them back up to the dorm without causing a scene would be another matter. “I’ll be right back, love, you might want to put something on, though.” Harry seemed to come to at the comment and a pretty little blush crossed his face.
"Thank you. Did you move in okay? I'll be sure to make a room for you and one Luna today so you don't have to worry about sharing personal space."
Severus shuttered at the thought and Narcissa whimpered in his grasp. Startled by her reaction, the spy reminded himself that he needed to school his emotions and pull himself together, at least until they were somewhere safe.
Harry didn’t stop to hear the response before moving into the cramped hall.
With no concern for the barkeep’s door, Snape barged through, pulling Narcissa along while doing the best to shield her from the cold.
"You know you can come to me with these things." Blaise sounded hurt and Draco smiled gently at his oldest and dearest friend.
“Oh stop being a prat. Invisibility cloaks are things of legend. Wizards have tried for centuries to create them, but they’ve never been successful, at least not that I’ve heard of.”
"No, don't go. I'm fine, just sore like I said, but Madame Pomfrey said there was nothing she could do for it, it was just the way that I fell I guess."
“Won’t you have a lemon cake, Harry? The elves make them especially for me and I must say they are the most delectable things I have ever had.” Dumbledore smiled at him like he used to. Harry wondered how the man could act as if nothing had happened between them since the start of the year.
The curtains were drawn in Harry's room and he slowly made his way to bed, throwing his robe over a chair, knowing that Dobby or one of the other house elves would get to it for him before he woke. With a slight chuckle at Hermione's possible reaction to Harry having his house elves do a task he could have very well done himself, Harry lay down, remembering that Hermione would be by early in the morning.
"You're worried about him." Phineas Nigellus Black said, looking down on his fellow Slytherin with what seemed to be a sneer on his face.
"I'm not going to bite you, you know." Pansy rolled her eyes at the way the red-head was inching around her carefully. Instead of responding, he simply glared at her as if to say that he didn't believe her.
"See the show?" Blaise questioned, Draco looking just as confused.
"We are, My Lord." Mr. Greengrass said in his silky smooth, diplomatic voice. "We are so very glad our family could be of service." He too bowed, though much lower than Nott Sr. had which more than pleased Voldemort, but angered the other Death Eater.
"You want me to call the others?" It wasn't really a question, but Harry nodded anyways. Sighing, Hermione took out her coin, using the newest spell she had created for it to call only the core members to their common room. "Who is it?"
“When in Merlin’s name did you get a snake?” Severus asked before he could think better of it.
"I like you too, I thought my patronus changing would have proven that." Draco rolled his eyes, leaning into plant a sold kiss on Harry's full lips. "You're not pressuring me into anything, I want this, whatever it is, just as much as you do."
“How much longer do you think it’s going to take the build the house anyway?” Blaise asked as he and Pansy went back toward the kitchen to dole out the cups of tea and sandwiches.
"No, I mean, I don't know." Harry shrugged, spelling the dishes clean.
"And how was that?" Harry knew that Draco stared at him, hell he was sure that Draco knew that he was staring right back, but he couldn't for the love of it all understand what it all meant.
“I think I’ll stay here for now, I’m sure he will want to see me and speak to me at some point, and I with him, but I’m tired.” Narcissa spoke slowly and while her voice wavered and the pain was obvious, she seemed much more clear minded than she had the night before.
"You are too right, Severus, we will have to keep an eye on them, on all of them." Albus nodded grimly. The conversation was over, there was nothing more to be said, not that the three wanted to say anything more. There was much to do now and too little time.
"At least it would be a happy death." Draco smirked.
"Actually we are. If you would like to help you can, but don't feel obligated." Harry threw a look at Hermione. "Don't make the poor bloke work, I think having him cook is payment enough to stay for a while. Not that I even require payment."
There was a fire still going strong in the common room and Harry was not surprised to find Blaise, Ginny, Draco, and Luna sitting by it. The rest of the core would no doubt be in their own dorms, but his friends had stayed up for him. It warmed his heart and made the bitter loneliness that had existed in him since his Aunt and Uncle had convinced him that he was good for nothing begin to fade.
“Just hurry.” The fear clinging to his lover’s voice was enough to scare Draco. The blond nodded and kissed him soundly on the lips before racing off to find the bookworm and the bat.
"Come on, we're going to be late for History of Magic." Draco pulled the two out of their thoughts and they made their way to their next class, the events of the past few days weighing heavy on all of their minds.
The streets of Hogsmeade were empty, but that wasn’t surprising. Between the time of night, the cold of winter, and the reign of terror brought on by Voldemort and his Death Eaters, it was a wonder that any of the lights were still on in the Hogshead as the two approached the door. Leave it to Aberforth to still be up. It was a risk coming here, of course. The death of Dumbledore had been written off as sickness and old age as the only people who bore witness to it had been Harry and Draco, who hadn’t been seen or heard from since that day over a month ago and Severus himself. The guilt ate at him every time his colleagues wept for the old man’s loss, not a single one of them knowing it was by his wand. He violently shoved the thoughts behind his occlumency walls, there would be time later for such thoughts.
"Poppy, may Mr. Potter and I borrow your office? The others will remain here until we are done regardless of the time." Snape's voice was tight and strained, it was clear he was also less than happy with Dumbledore.
"Look, I'm not sure what's going on between you and Draco, but I support you, both of you."
"If you just add this sticking charm," Fred started to say, waving his wand wildly, much to the amusement of the students who where paying attention.
"Draco," The soft way Harry spoke his name made the nervous blond stop and turn to face the brunet. "Goodnight, Draco." The smile was soft, if a bit sad.
"The trauma unlocked your reserved magic and you came of age early." Ginny gasped. She had notice the spike in magic around him recently, but because he had a handle over most of it, she couldn't quite tell if it was just a little more magic or if he had actually come into his adult magic early.
“Well then, I could see how cauldrons would be preferable.” Draco agreed.
"You shouldn't have seen it at all. Normally I have very good control on who can and can't see it, but I messed up because I was concentrating on keeping Draco safe. That and like I told you, he already knows so I didn't feel the need hide it from him. I'm sure that Hermione knows something too, but from that distance she shouldn't have seen anything."
"I know." Harry looked down, trying to rid his mind of the look that Draco was giving him.

”I just need to speak to anyone who was a member of the DA last year, you know you you are, and also Draco and Blaise. This hopefully will not take long, but if you have to duck out early I do understand. I figure with tomorrow being Saturday then at least we don't have to get up early tomorrow. I know I had quidditch practice set for eleven in the morning, I will understand if you come to practice tried, just try to be on time. To the rest of you, good night, get back safe, and I'll see most of you in the dorms, the rest next week."
"Well if that's all, it's getting late." Hermione got up and yawned, everyone else who didn't live in the dorm followed suit. It took nearly fifteen minutes for everyone to say goodbye, Severus slipped out first, but by the time it was just six that actually lived in the rooms it was rather late.
Junior Order or the core. Harry wouldn’t have brought up something private in such an open area.
“To a place that was once very important to young Tom Riddle. Do you remember what a pensive is Harry?”
"Well that's great and all, and it's not that we mind you being here, but what are you doing here exactly?" Blaise asked. It seemed that since his blooming relationship with Ginny, he had been very sure to keep on all of the redhead's good sides.
Draco was surprised that Harry had mentioned his Godfather’s vaults so casually, but the boy had been healing over the past few months and he had been able to mention Sirius in casual conversation more frequently with each passing day. “That’s a pretty good idea, we’ll need to go with a few of us, or else we’ll have to find a way to bring it all back on our own.”
"Thanks." The wavering in Draco's voice was obvious and he looked to Harry first before continuing. "Again I'm so sorry for all that I have done, but I want to move past that and prove that I am not that person." He stopped again and this time Blaise began to speak.
The end of November rolled around with little incident. Dumbledore's trial was set to take place on the the twenty-seventh, which was less than a week away. Until that point, Professor McGonnagal was taking her role as Deputy Headmistress very seriously and her students suffered from her added stress. Severus had also been much too busy to come around to meetings, though it was because of his work for Voldemort. The DA as a whole had to be much more careful in their operations. Because of the up and coming trial, the Board of Governors had decided to take a closer look into the recent happenings at the school and Ministry officials were seen coming and going as if they owned the place. This of course was cause for great concern as all but the first years could remember quite clearly what a Ministry run Hogwarts was like from just the year previous. Because of the heightened security, Harry was more on edge than when they had been under silent attack by the then unknown students and that caused the rest of the junior order to also be on high alert.
"Now children.” The conversation was brought back to the topic at hand. "I'm sure you will help to properly integrate Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Zabini into their new home." It was a statement and Harry nodded, he would have anyways, but he knew that it was best for Dumbledore to feel like he was in charge, the less he knew the better. "Good. You run off now, Harry, Severus an I have some things to discuss."
“What are we going to do?”
for those interested!
The girl nodded and walked off to start the last game. When Harry was sure she was out of earshot he turned to Draco, standing close enough to whisper, but not too close to call too much attention to them. Harry couldn't help but smirk when he heard Draco's breath hitch when he moved closer.
"I'm sure he will be fine," Harry spoke when they made it back on the ground level. He didn't really know if he believed himself, but for Draco's sake he stood his ground. "Parkinson came to talk to me again."
"What happened?" Snape demanded, his eyes jumping between the two in rapid succession.
"Oh okay, I hadn't really dressed for that though." Draco looked down at his attire, it was the weekend and he had chosen to dress in one of his simpler muggle suits.
“He's completely off his rocker." Severus said, through gritted teeth.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I would like to review what we both know. We can move from there." Harry nodded and took out another stack of papers from his bag. He waved his hand over the stack, whispering a complex counter charm. Suddenly elegant script wrote itself across the parchment in Draco's distinct handwriting.
"Well that can be ignored, can it not?" With a meaningful look, Harry waited for the creature before him to nod. "Good. Is there a more private place that we can wait?"
"I don't mean to make you worry." Harry buried his face even further into the nape of Draco's neck taking in the boy's minty sent. It seemed to instantly calm him and he took another breath before continuing. "I just realized with everything going on, I've completely forgotten about Sirius."
, but the icing on the cake for her was when Mipsy had joined Harry's growing staff of house elves. Harry hadn't intended on taking in another house elf, but Mipsy had been very close to Dobby at Hogwarts, once again Harry did not want to consider the implications of two house elves being
"Yeah I keep one extra, but it's a bit small, you might have to alter it." Harry stood and Draco made to follow, very aware of Blaise's eyes following them. Oh this was going to be interesting.
"Well, here goes nothing." Harry looked to the two out of place Slytherins in the corner, nodded once more to Hermione and then took his spot in front of all of his students. Silence fell across the room rapidly. Harry took a moment to take pride in both himself and his fellow leaders for instilling the respect of all of their students to the point were they all stopped talking, waiting for instruction without needing to be asked. Pride aside, Harry knew that there was no time for such sentimentality and he pushed on.
"How do we know that we can trust him?" Justin Finch-Fletchly asked and many in the room agreed. It seemed like the question that was on most everyone's mind and Harry was glad that it was the first question asked.
“Of course." Draco answered knowing that it hadn't been a question, but feeling the need to make Harry know that he had considered this. He had considered it all. He was quite surprised at how calmly Harry seemed to be acting, noticing the flecks of magic come and go in his bright green eyes. It all seemed much too easy.
"What now?" Harry's voice was horse from crying and the raw sound almost brought Draco to tears.
“Thank you, once again, old friend.” Severus nodded, understanding the suggestion. He walked quickly with Narcissa to the back room. There was a single armchair facing a fireplace with a small table to its right. A bookcase sat in the corner that looked to be stuffed full of titles and a chest sat under the window, its contents unknown. The rug was large, though it was mostly held down by the armchair. A single corner was completely free and Severus carefully moved Narcissa in his protective grasp to brandish his wand. With a silent flick, Severus revealed the trap door.
"Why'd you just let him go, 'Mione." Ron asked sulking from the couch.
“You lot will have to get them out of here through the back door. There is an apparition point not to far from here, but the village itself is being heavily monitored. I’m surprised no one has come since your arrival.” The unmistakable voice of Aberforth was gruff with sleep. Severus realized then that he had no notion of just how late he had dropped in on the old barkeep.
"It's late, love, go to sleep and we will have plenty more time to get to know each other in the morning." With a flick of his wrist, Harry dimmed the candles in the room and drew the curtains around the bed. Draco shivered at the feel of the raw magic that surrounded him. He drifted into sleep easier than he had in a long time, knowing without a doubt that he was safe in Harry's arms.
Severus glanced around the room, noticing that while the teenagers had glanced up at him when he’d entered the room, most were either going about their original tasks or were too tired to pay him any mind.
"Was he just smiling?" Ron asked confused, Hermione giggling in his lap.
Before Draco could protest that it had only been one time (or maybe five, but who really counted those things?) Harry had them both in their room with the door firmly shut. He made no move to explain before he threw open is truck with more force than necessary and began to pull out his things creating a mess on the floor.
"You give up, Weasley?" Draco taunted from above the girl, a smirk set firmly on his face. He started to walk slowly toward her, his eyes trained on her wand and his body ready to jump back at any moment.
"Understood," Harry turned his back on the lifeless body of the man who both saved and manipulated him, determined not to allow the sight of him to slow him down. "Draco, I know this wasn't the plan and I promise I will explain later, but right now we have to get to the dorm, tell me that the core is already there."
“Well we’ll have the time to do it, I don’t think anyone should be leaving the grounds for the time being. It won’t be safe.” Hermione spoke again, whatever annoyance she had just recently shown seemed to be gone, dissolved in the face of learning something new. “Let me take the locket down to the basement, your four should go get some rest.”
"Bloody hell that man is a menace." Ron muttered, shaking his head. "Poor bloke, I don't envy him. I'm going to hit the showers, I'll see you lot at dinner." Ron broke off from the group, Hermione and Blaise also took their leave for the castle, leaving Ginny and Harry behind.
"I suppose I should take that as a compliment, but yes I was actually offered the job as a figurehead of sorts for the Ministry right after the war. I turned it down though, I wasn't ready to be back in the public eye, I still don't think I am even now." Admitting was easy, the only ones he had told had been Hermione and Ron, knowing full well that the information would never leave their lips, but Draco had no reason to out him. The faith he had in the man before him should have been unsettling, but it wasn’t. That in it of itself was unsettling.
"I just think that it's a bunch of hogwash is all. Everyone has their rights, even those who fought on the other side of the war. Any law that discriminates against anyone will just bring about another war, maybe not now, but in the long run someone else will try to take control using the same fear and old ways of thinking that got us into this whole mess in the first place." Neville spoke passionately.
"There are rooms near the Gryffindor tower originally meant for the head of House, but are currently unoccupied since Professor McGonnagal decided to reside elsewhere in the castle. Since the rooms empty, Professor Dumbledore has offered them to Draco should he need them." Harry looked to the darker boy finally fully acknowledging him. "I know that moving out is not ideal, but it would be safe." Harry looked back to Draco who had a deep frown on his face.
“Typical,” Harry whispered, no longer able to keep his comments to himself.
With a deep, steadying breath, Severus cast his patronus and was awestruck to see the wispy form of a crow leaping from his wand tip. There would be time later to consider what it meant.
"So what did you think?" Draco asked his godfather expectantly.
"To apologize." It was clear on Draco's face that having to admit this brought him great pain, most likely to his ego, but he seemed determined.
"Professor Snape, but I think he will be a while, he has to deal with the students who did this to them." Draco said, his voice bitter at the mention of the attackers.
"I don't know, when I woke up this morning Draco was sour with me. He barely even spoke." Harry said glumly and this time Pansy rolled her eyes.
“The rest of you stay here, we don’t need to draw even more unwanted attention.” Ginny said before getting up and following her brother. “Draco you’re going to want to come with us.”
The two where so wrapped up in each other that when Harry stood, they didn't even notice. As much as the boy wanted to be there to help, he could tell that he would only get in the way. Slowly he walked away from the two, holding in his own tears. They needed space and Harry knew better than most what it felt like to lose everything and need the time and space to deal with it. Casting one last look at the two, he slipped out of the room and made his way toward the Tower. The draft of the castle made Harry pull his robes closer, to his body. He knew part of the reason that he was shaking was because of what he had just heard and the state that he had left Draco in and he instantly felt horrible. Why had he just done that? What kind of person was he for leaving the man he loved behind when he clearly was falling apart? Harry was so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he didn't even notice that there where two other people in the hallway, watching his every move carefully.
"How could I forget about him?"
"No more, need you now." Harry panted, opening his legs wider, pulling Draco to line him up with his entrance. Draco was surprised at how eager Harry was and felt himself get even harder. Not needing to be told twice, Draco started to push the head of his member into Harry. Hissing at the sudden stretching, Harry relaxed enough to allow Draco to push in further. It had been much too long since Harry had been filled and he had been dreaming of Draco being the one. The reality far exceeded the dream. He thought he might pass out from sheer pleasure when Draco was fully inside him. "Move," Harry demanded and Draco began to pump, slowly at first to gain a rhythm before picking up the pace, moving Harry's legs over his shoulders to penetrate deeper. The string of words and sounds falling from Harry's lips were the only things keeping Draco from releasing right away. He forced himself to focus on Harry, wanting him to find his completion first. It only took a few more thrusts for Harry to reach his orgasm, screaming Draco's names over and over, clamping down on Draco tight enough to send the blond over the edge only seconds after.
“Lucky for us, I have a house.” Harry teased, before laying a particularly needy kiss on his eager boyfriend. “Goodnight everyone!” he called over his shoulder as Draco laughed, allowing him to pull him along.
"See, he cannot be trusted!" Bellatrix spoke up for the first time since the meeting. Snape was rather surprised that it took her so long, since he was accustomed to her lack of self-restraint.
"What if they choose you?" Draco responds. He looked almost childlike and his eyes grew wide in obvious fear. It broke Severus' heart to see him that way and Harry reflexively pulled the blond in for a strong hug.
Harry took his time rimming Draco, loving every gasp and moan that fell from his lips When he was sure that he was extra sensitive, Harry pulled away and lined up his leaking cock with Draco’s hole. The Slytherin had little time to complain as Harry pushed into Draco’s welcoming heat. They had done this enough times and Draco was prepared enough that they didn’t have to start slow and Harry rocked his hips at a bruising rate. Draco clawed at his shoulders and cried out with every thrust.
"You didn't think to tell me that earlier." Luna joked and Harry just smiled ruefully.
"And yet you are dating Weasley." Blaise drawled and three pairs of angry eyes fell upon him. "Alright I take it back, he's not that bad." Blaise said with his hands up in mock surrender, Harry and Hermione just rolled their eyes and looked back on the field in time to see Ron touch down, a bit shaky in his landing.
"Godric let me in, also I set the password so I ought to be allowed in." Harry moved from the door and walked further into the room.
“We went to the cottage as you tasked us, My Lord.” The smaller of the two men was whimpering, his face hovering just above the Dark Lord’s feet to keep from having to look him in the eyes.
"I'm not sure. I don't quite understand how time works between the visions and real time. I don't know if he's there with him now and if we send him a message if that might blow his cover."
“I love you,” he whispered into the blond’s hair and he felt as Draco smiled into his side.
"He hasn't. This must be important. I've got to go, just finish the potions and get back to your dorm safe. Lock and ward the room after I leave and send for Harry to get you when you're done."
"Don't worry Dobby, he won't hurt you." Harry smiled and patted his friend on the head.
Harry sighed as he put the letter down after reading it over at least three times. He wished Ron would just grow up sometimes. It was very typical of Ron to think that everything Harry did was his way of either taking Ron's side or going against the red-head. Harry had been hoping that with time he would realize that not everything in Harry's life revolved around his best-mate. His wishes had yet to be granted seeing as Ron still threw temper tantrums over everything.
He still wasn’t sure what emotions to feel when he stood in his last class on Friday. Potions had gotten much easier for him, but with a distracted mind it wasn’t difficult to fall back on bad habits. Normally he would partner with Draco, but Ron and Hermione had gotten into a minor argument that morning which had carried on through the day and so Ron had partnered with him instead. Harry was listlessly adding in the ingredients while Ron complained about one thing or another and, as these things often did, the potion went to shit. It began to bubble and turn a putrid shade of green. Luckily Ron had learned a thing or two about potions this year too and he had the lid on the cauldron at the first sign of disaster. He drew his wand next to banish the concoction before it exploded and did unfathomable harm to them.
"You are such a man." Ginny laughed, rolling her eyes.
"I'm surprised that they are all willingly signing to allow Snape access to this place." Harry said genuinely shocked and Draco just laughed, shaking his head and tickling Harry's face with his hair brushing back and forth.
"What do you want?" Harry's voice was calm and steady. He had to allow her to think that she had the upper hand if he wanted to surprise her enough to get free without causing a scene or actually hurting the girl.
“I’m fine, love.” Harry laughed as he pulled Draco closer. He took a moment to bury his face in the boy’s hair. “Really I think we need to get out of here for a while if you’re getting this paranoid.”
They said their goodbyes to the group before heading out of the common room. Harry loved their friends and while he would always prefer to be with people he loved over being alone, he didn’t often get a chance to be alone with his own thoughts, especially with how close the core had gotten and he was grateful to take advantage of the opportunity. Draco always knew just what he needed and didn’t say a word as he began to lead them from the tower toward the main castle. They weren’t dressed to walk the grounds so Harry knew that wherever Draco was leading them it would be somewhere within Hogwarts.
"He doesn't know does he?" When Albus shook his head, Snape growled. "You have to tell the boy, this is incredibly important, it could be what saves him in the end." Something passed over the old man's face when Snape said the word save, but the spy didn't seem to notice. He was seeing red over the fact that the manipulative wizard was once again holding back information.
"Thank you, Sir." Colin nodded in amazement, a small smile forming on his face. Severus merely nodded and swept on to Blaise's table, and then continued on his circuit around the room a few more times, correcting and complimenting as he went.
"He is, but I'm not sure about his attitude." Katie shook her head as Cormac made an overly dramatic flip to add flare to the save, but missed the quaffle and Ginny did a victory lap around the goals looking rather smug while Cormac looked less than happy with himself.
"I am surprised that you kept your cool." Harry commented, taking his normal seat. Blaise and Draco sat on the arm rests on either side of him.
Once they both calmed enough to separate, Severus walked over and set the mug of tea in Narcissa’s open hands. The two men watched her sip the drink, gently reminding her not to drink too fast, lest she upset her delicate stomach. Words weren’t necessary as the three sat, Narcissa and Severus on the lounge, and Draco happily on the ground at their feet, and enjoyed the simplicity of the other’s company. Despite the war that raged on outside their walls, the small if someone misfit family found joy in each other’s company.
." Harry hissed back, bowing to the man in thanks. The portrait opened just as Salazar was stepping out of his frame, presumably into the one above the fireplace where his lover was.
"Oh alright, just this time." She stood and pulled Blaise up as well, easily transfiguring the couch into a large queen bed. "I'm just going to freshen up and then I think I'm off to bed." She kissed Blaise gently on the cheek before heading off to the bathroom.
“Well yesterday was a tiring day, but I can honestly say I had a pretty good night.” The leer on his face made Draco laugh and she joined him at the table with a fresh cuppa.
"Draco, the ring." Harry gasped when he could feel Draco getting closer and his walls tightened even further around him. Being too far gone, Draco undid the lock on the ring with magic. The sudden release made Harry see stars and he exploded into Draco with a loud cry. Draco was soon to follow, climaxing as soon as he felt his lover's seed spill into him.
"Are we going to be wanting tea or liquor for this meeting?"
"Honestly, Blaise." Draco sighed under his breath, annoyed that despite his best efforts, Blaise still didn't take it to heart when Draco told him to play nice.
“We know, Harry. Sorry, we’r just a bit anxious to know more so we can help.” Hermione said earnestly as she sat perched on the armrest of his chair.

“There is a bathroom connected to this room, it’s fully stocked with towels and toiletries, there should be spare toothbrushes in the top drawer. Breakfast is normally a subdued affair, we pretty much just cook for ourselves unless there are others who happen to be awake in the kitchen at the same time. I can come collect you in the morning if you’d like, or you are free to explore. Neville, Pansy, Luna, and Seamus and Dean all have rooms on this floor, Harry and Draco, Ginny and Blaise, and Ron and I are up a floor. Knock on any door if you need help.”
"I promise." Harry nodded, sealing it with another long, slow kiss, letting his tongue snake out and flick along Draco's lips teasingly, pulling back as fast as it appeared.
"Well for starters you could work a little lower." Harry lifted his hips unseating Draco who just chuckled and rolled his eyes. He helped the boy out of the rest of his clothes, making sure to strip down himself, before joining Harry on the bed again.
"That is why I trust you to it alone. Tell me, how are things at the castle really? I cannot count on Nott for trustworthy information and no matter how smart the Greengrass girl is, she is still a woman. I want to hear it from you."
"She just wanted to make sure we stayed safe, and she gave me a parting gift." Harry tugged on the chain that was concealed under his robes and Luna pouted at the sight of it.
"Why don't you help her get settled in, love. I'm going to go make a light supper." Harry smiled as he watched Draco held out his hand to Hermione and lead her in the direction of the spare room. At first he had been nervous about how they would interact, Hermione had never been mean to Draco, not after the war at any rate, and he had hoped that they would eventually get along. It seemed that Ron's actions were doing more good for the blond than harm. The sarcastic part of Harry really wanted to track down the redhead and thank him, but he knew better. Ron might have never grown up, but he sure had.

“Stop that this instant.” Pansy commanded and Kreacher stopped instantly.
The four made their way up to the large house and Severus could finally say he felt hope for a possible swift ending to the terror that had reigned over most of his life, and all on the coattails of children. Dumbledore was likely turning in his grave. The thought alone made the dark man smirk and he walked toward the house before him with no reservations.
After finishing his breakfast, waking up Draco, and dressing in plain black robes, Harry and Luna made their way to Snape's office. They used the open floo connection to get to the Leaky Cauldron and made their way from there.
“If we had joined forces we could have kept Tom at bay, we could have insured the world took the turn we wanted. We could have remained together.” Gellert had moved closer, so close that he was able to cup Dumbledore’s face. “My dear we could have had it all and instead you threw me in prison and condemned me for taking your ideas and bringing them to life.”
"Of course Sir. And Sir, thank you." Harry smiled. He knew that Snape was doing this solely for Draco's benefit, but Harry couldn't help but feel like the man was also trying to keep him and the rest of the students safe as well.
“She’s Nagini’s daughter and Harry rescued her from Voldemort’s death cave.” Ginny explained casually, her feelings on the matter emphasized with an eye-roll. “You know, normal stuff if you’re the boy who lived.”
True to Harry’s request they spent the rest of their night making out lazily until they nodded off to sleep.
be the same."
“I love you too.”
"I don't know mate, but I think you're going to have to figure this one out on your own." Draco stood, clapping his best mate on the back before pulling Harry up with him. "We're going to turn in too, behave Mate."
“Vipera won’t be happy about that,” Harry sighed, but jotted it down and Severus watched as the master list was updated. “Do you have any idea what the Hufflepuff item might be?”
“We can’t trust Kreacher.” Harry responded and Hermione nodded to show her agreement.
." Again the hooded man let out a cry as pain split through his body once more. Again the spell was cut short. "You failed to keep a leash on your son. Should I consider this your betrayal as well?"
"We went to the cave, there was a potion-" was all Harry managed to say before the potion's master produced a beazor from his pocket and knelt by Dumbledore's side.
"As soon as this is done, you know I must inform Riddle, there is no way for me to keep the rest of them out of the castle then. We are not ready yet Albus, it is not the time." Severus added, looking just as conflicted as Harry.
“That would be brilliant, when this is all over I want to focus more of my time on that, I could really use the help.” Neville blushed under the kind words, but he looked proud. It was a good look on him.
“We could have been great together. Imagine the life we could have had if you had just joined me.”
"Gee thanks for that Gin." Harry continued to cough and Ginny just smiled.
"We'll just have to wait for Sev to get back." Draco said when the room lapsed into silence. "I know how he acts, especially with Gryffindors, but he takes his job very seriously and I'm not surprised that he's upset. He would want to insure the safety of all of his students, especially one that I consider a good friend." Blaise nodded from the armrest on Draco's other side, agreeing with the blond.
"Today we will be brewing a simple blood replenishing potion. The instructions are on the board."
"Oh that would be my fault." Harry smiled sheepishly. "Though I didn't know that they would be here either. I just told Godric to let in all the Weasleys. I figured he would know that I meant the ones that still went to school here, but I guess not."
"And you want to shag his brains out." It was a statement that made all of the color rise to Harry's cheeks.
"Alright, I suppose that's fair. You know where the washroom is."
Harry settled back down next to Draco, pulling him into a hug again, this time placing his head on his shoulder, laying his own head on top of Draco's. Whatever they were, he wasn't sure, but he did know that in that moment it felt right. For once in Harry's life, he felt like he belonged and somehow he knew that he would only ever feel this way while in Draco's arms.
"Alright then, five points to Slytherin. Ah, Mr. Potter do you have more to add?" Harry's hand had gone up while his mates were laughing. He had seen Professor Williams go towards the front of the room again seemingly to move on with the lecture, but he knew that there was one more point that had been missed.
"Draco trusts you, that's going to have to be enough for me. Just be careful, don't get caught."

"They can't actually get away with this." Hermione protested and Severus took his seat gingerly, rubbing his long fingers of his temples. "I wish that were so, Miss Granger, but until we can bring this problem up with the Governors at the head of the school board there is nothing to be done."
"Well you should both know a little bit about it already, Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad was founded to disband our student run training sessions last year. We’re going to start meeting up again, it looks like there is still a need.”
"Or that I suppose. Though if I were a politician I think I would run out of patience too quickly and be out of a job." Harry rolled his eyes at the mere thought. He had been approached by the Ministry once. Of course he had turned them out point blank and they made sure that no news had ever made it to the public, they hadn’t needed the bad press at the time, they certainly didn’t need any of it now.
“Well there needs to be a plan in place. There is no way to tell the others. If we are going to solidify in Voldemort’s mind that you are his man and his man alone then everyone in your life will have to believe that you did this of your own volition.”
“You do realize how ridiculous you’re being right?” Harry glared at him and Draco rolled his eyes in a way so strange and yet familiar that it startled a laugh from the Gryffindor. “Really, you have so many plans that I can’t imagine an instance that we’re not going to be prepared for. We have the house and the others who are working with us to complete it. We have a secret organization inside a not as secret organization and while there might not be explicit directions on how to run it when the time comes that we’ll have to leave this place they will be able to run themselves even if we’re not here.
"So she's been attacking me because she thinks that I'm with him?" Ginny asked and Pansy nodded to confirm. "To what end? What's the point?"
There was a cold draft wafting through Malfoy Manor that had nothing to do with the cold November air. The occupants where all convened in the main drawing room, situated in a circle, cowering before a sickly looking man with red eyes and slits for nostrils. He paced around the circle a few times, simply watching his followers for any hesitation or deceit. Most of the masked witches and wizards stood back, their eyes trained down, though Bellatrix stood forward, her face exposed and her gaze falling on her master with pure admiration. This pleased the man and he stopped his pacing in front of her, addressing the room.
“What do you know that could help me?”
Draco fell asleep first which gave Harry enough time to watch him. He wasn't sure where their relationship would take them, but he knew that right then everything was alright, that he wouldn't change anything. Slowly he let go of Draco, moving the pillows and blankets to make sure that he would stay comfortable.
“No, that’s impossible.” Draco spoke, still in awe as the material came in and out of focus. “Is this how you managed everything these past five years?”
Harry woke up before the sun rose. Groaning, Harry rolled over, not sure what had woken him. The wards prodded him again, alerting him that someone was in his house. Carefully making sure to not wake Draco, Harry took up his wand and start down to the first floor. Through the wards he could feel that the person was in the sitting room. Making his way down he fell back into his ingrained instincts from the war. He knew that it wasn't a complete stranger, his wards wouldn't allow someone not authorized to enter directly into his home, but over the past five years many people had come and gone during parties and other meetings and Harry hadn’t had a chance to go through and clear the cache so to speak. He knew that the person was agitated. It was their raw, angry magic that had woken Harry in the first place. Slowly making his way down the stairs, Harry inched across the wall until he was leaning on the door with his hand on the knob. After taking one last calming breath Harry threw open the door flooding the room with light by silently spelling the drapes open to further surprise the person.
"I won't." The conviction in the girl's eyes was enough for Harry and with a quick nod, he was gone, leaving her alone to collect herself before making the journey up to dangerous territory for Slytherin.
"Of course you do, you're
“Cissa, I am so sorry. I promise when we get to safety I am going to do everything I can for you, but can you just hold on for me for a bit longer?”
“I told you, there are many mistakes in my past, but this was not one that I would ever make.”
“Of course, the tour can wait, why don’t we leave you to rest with your family? Draco knows how to call on any of us if needed.”
“Of corse I do.” Harry laughed quietly and held his arm out for the girl to take. They walked the rest of the way together while Draco’s patronus followed closely behind.
"Bloody hell." Was the only response Harry got and he chuckled, pulling Draco closer. The blond tried to keep his eyes open, he wanted to repay the boy in kind, but sleep was insistently tugging at his consciousness.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was actually thinking,” Draco started before picking up a book from the table that Harry had never seen before, “there might be something else that you can teach and that I could teach too. These are old tales that wizarding families read to their children when they’re young. I bet you’ve never heard them before and I’ve always wondered what muggle children grew up with.”
"I will tell him, but first you have to convince him to trust me again."
“No need to thank me at all. Why don’t you get a cup of coffee from Blaise, there is water in the kettle if you prefer tea, Sir, and I’ll talk to Harry about whipping up some food for Lady Malfoy.”
“You’re right.” Harry smiled despite himself. “I’m just worried.”
"I really don't think so." Draco protested again. "I've known her since we were children, I would know a trap set by her any day. I know it seems fishy, but I honestly don't think that Pansy is involved. Beside, I had mentioned to Sev that I trust her, he could have talked to her about keeping an eye on things since I can’t.”
The rest was completed very quickly. The documents did not take long to sign and Harry made very quick work of Bill's memory. By the time Harry and Luna apparated to the new home of the Order it was only mid afternoon.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop." Draco joined Harry and gingerly placed his hand on Hermione’s shoulder. Harry smiled gently telling Draco that he wasn't mad at him for listening to their conversation.
“Now, now, is that a way to greet old friends?” Fred smirked, brandishing his wand to close the door and forced the wizard to turn to face them. “Why don’t we take this to the back, Tom has been kind enough to give us a quiet place to talk.”
“It’s okay, Lady Malfoy, I’ve got you,” Neville spoke gently, his hands outstretched and his wand holstered. It occurred to Severus then that the boy knew better than most the effects of the cruciatus curse and he was glad that Hermione had chosen him to take with her.
"Alright then, I'm going to start sending them back in small groups, I think it would be best if you two waited around for a bit before you left, if that's okay."
"Honestly, Molly think of the example that you're setting for the children." Albus tried to reason, the kind tone not quite meeting his eyes. His eyes kept darting between her, the students and now McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout.
"It's not that I don't trust you. Because I do, I trust you more than anyone. More than Hermione, Ron, all of the Order both the children and the adults. I trust you more than I trust myself at times. I'm just afraid if I tell you anything you'll be in more danger."
The three made it back to the rooms fine and Severus helped set up a cot for Luna for the night. Blaise and Ginny where already asleep in their rooms and Draco and Harry didn't much feel like bothering them. With the promise to bring Pansy in and the firm command to not wait up, Severus left and Draco and Harry went to bed, both falling into a fitful sleep.
"You know it's quite annoying when you finish each other's sentences like that." Blaise rolled his eyes which only made the two laugh.
about something like this." Pansy countered and Draco nodded.
"That's what troubles me, what is he up to?" Severus sounded genuinely worried now, but whether is was because of Harry or for Harry Albus didn't know.
"That was some tryout, you and Bell know whose going to make the team?" Blaise started the conversation looking passively at Harry. The Slytherin knew something was up with Harry and Draco. The tension between them during the game had been nearly visible and it was Blaise's duty as his best mate to figure out what was going on.
"And what about you? You're not getting out of the warm ups."
"Oh, but your not a child, my boy." Harry knew then that it was pointless to hide his power from the old man. What he didn't know however was whether or not he really was just getting old or if something more sinister was going on.
"Well for starters he came to me for help and he's staying in my home until this gets sorted. I've spent a lot of time with him since he moved in and I don't know... he's different, or maybe I'm different. Either way I don't want to see him have to go through this and then go home to a destroyed flat when there was nothing for the aurors to find in the first place."
“I’d prefer to go with you, or at least have one of us join you.” Draco finally said out loud and Harry shook his head.
"I'm sure most of you are pretty tired and want to go back up to the castle, but please remember the time, everyone should spend at least a few hours in Hogsmeade before returning as to not arouse suspicions." Harry reminded everyone as they got their bearings.
"Thank you." Draco whispered not looking up.
"We're going to test the keepers now. I want Katie to go against Cormac because she's the best we have and I really want to test him. I want you to go against Ron."
"Please, Severus," the whispered words might as well have been a deafening roar and Snape closed his eyes for a brief moment before nodding and squaring his shoulders.
"Of course, tell Ginny and Neville that I send my best."
"Albus was just about to explain to us why he felt it was unnecessary to inform us that our daughter was hurt in an attack." Molly said in a deadly voice not taking her eyes off of the old man. She trusted that Snape and her husband would have her back.
"Honestly, Potter, not hiding anything else?" The last person to speak was Blaise and Harry couldn't help but smirk."
"Oh Ron is going to love that."
Ron lead the way back to Gryffindor territory. There were still a few students coming and going from dinner so the odd trio didn’t draw much attention. It wasn’t until they made it past the tower, into the secluded hallway that housed the head of house’s rooms that Ron stopped and turned to face the blond. “Harry’s mind is linked to Voldemort’s.”
"At this rate we're never going to make it back, love." Draco purred which only caused Harry to kiss him again.
Harry began to place hot, open mouthed kisses down Draco's neck, using one hand to pin Draco's arms above his head to keep the blond from pushing him to go faster. The strangled groans falling from the boy's mouth made Harry speed up his pace, making sure to nip and suck on each of his pert nipples, giving them as much attention as he dared before moving lower. His tongue traced the taunt muscles of his abdomen and he made sure to leave dark bite marks in his wake.
The rest of the fifteen minutes went about in a blur. Draco was able to score six goals in total, and while he wasn't proud of his performance, he was rather proud that Ron had done so well. The goals that he had been able to score happened in the first seven minutes, after that Ron had gotten his bearings and been able to block the rest of his attempts. While Draco was sure that Cormac had done better, Ron was a stronger player. Draco could tell that he had room for improvement and a willingness to work with the team, which would be very important, not just to the team, but also to Harry who viewed his team like a family. Cormac just wanted his fifteen minutes of fame.
"I don't see where you get off giving orders to our portrait." Blaise scoffed though his tone held no malice. The two were bantering over Draco's head since they still flanked him on either side and the blond in the middle simply rolled his eyes.
! Why are you suddenly defending him? What's your problem? Wasn't seven years of getting tortured by him enough or are you just a glutton for pain and anger?" Ron spat back. He was beyond being reasoned with and he didn't give a damn that Harry was a much more powerful wizard than he was even though he was the head of the auror department and Harry hadn't trained since the end of the war.
“I’d hate to sound stereotypical, but that would leave you three, then.” Neville motioned to the three Slytherins.
“I’m sorry?” They both knew that the old man had heard him, but Harry refused to rise to the bait.
"Okay, that sounds reasonable." So with an agreement settled, Bill retrieved the memories and Harry and Luna poured over them until they where able to decide on a five acre plot of land in Llangadwaladr in North Wales.
“Artikus, Artikus Burch.” He managed to splutter out and the twins shared a look. They had never heard the name before, but they knew Harry and rest would figure it out.
"What we can tell you is that we had reason to believe that something was happening that night in the Department of Mysteries. We formed a small group, the best trained of the DA, and did what we thought had to be done. Voldemort was there, that is not a rumor. A lot happened that night and I know that I for one don't want to relive it. If you have questions for anyone of us as an individual you will have to ask us privately and I cannot promise that anyone will be willing to retell those events. I think we can go into questions now if anyone has one that we haven't already covered."
"Be that as it may, this is of the utmost importance." Snape tried to reason with the lot of teens, though he knew it would be useless.
Harry nodded and took out the piece of parchment with the list of Order members. He handed the man the list, watching as his eyes scanned the page slowly, his expression changing occasionally from passive disinterest, confusion, and even annoyance at times.
“Sounds interesting enough. When are we going to the vaults?”
"Well you can send messages with your patronus, but you have to be pretty powerful and practice a lot to do that."
"How am I supposed to do that?" Harry asked and everyone remained silent, looking at each other as if one of them would suddenly have a brilliant idea.
"You're rooting for us tomorrow, right?" Seamus asked Draco and Blaise over dinner that night. The usual suspects sat near the middle of the long table. Over the past month, Draco and Blaise became a constant in the lives of Harry and all of his friends. Especially with the DA meetings every week, the two had ample opportunity to get to know their peers and they both felt more at home in the past month then they had in the past five years in Slytherin.
Draco sat in the middle of his large bed with his legs pulled up to his chest. If anyone saw him then, he would have denied feeling lost, confused, and alone (because war or no war, he was still a Malfoy and he still had some pride to his name) but that was exactly what he was feeling. It was now very clear to him how Harry felt, at least on a physical level, but how did he feel himself? Did he want to kiss Harry? He wasn't sure, though he knew that if Harry had managed to kiss him, he would have let him. Did he like Harry and on what level? They had been enemies for so long, this friendship of sorts had happened so suddenly it sent his head reeling.
Severus did his best to guide Narcissa to the mouth of the opening by the light of the fire, dying as it was. There was a ladder that descended no more than six feet before hitting the tightly packed dirt ground. He made his way down the ladder first, knowing that if Narcissa should fall, he would be there to catch her. They made their way into the tiny cellar with relative ease and Severus pulled the handle on the latch, closing them in. He heard above them as the rug slid back into place, muffling and noise from the bar.
." Pansy said, bring them back to the moment, reminding Harry just how dangerous the halls were.
"Your knife work has improved, just be sure to hold it steady and you should have uniform slices."
"Thank you, Gin. I'm sorry that I can't be there for you the way you need me." At this Ginny scoffed and brushed him off with a smile.
The sound of Harry speaking in the ancient language along with the taste of him in his mouth drove Draco wild and he ground his hips into the bed, not daring to stop sucking Harry to deal with his own erection. He didn't have to, however, and the string of parseltongue mixed with everything else proved to be too much for the blond and he came without even being touched, his moans vibrating around Harry's cock making the boy fall over the edge seconds after. Draco made sure to swallow all of the boy's seed, despite riding out his own orgasm. When he was done, he slowly made his way up to lie next to Harry. The Gryffindor, pulled him up into his arms, spelling the blond naked, effectively taking care of the mess that covered both of them.
"I love you too." Harry smiled back relaxing into Draco's arms. "I could stay here forever."

They walked silently through another short passageway that was just same as the last had been. As Harry had expected, as soon as they had walked fully into the next small room the door behind them closed, though this time there was nothing in the room at all. It looked just like the last two as far as it’s size. It was just as dimly lit and the walls were made of the small deadly looking rocks. Harry was starting to think that this trip would make him claustrophobic, but before he focus to much on it, he was distracted by the old wizard.
. Draco tried to convince himself, but he knew that it was much more than that.
"Okay you gather them up, I want to look at the sign up sheet and start crossing off names and staring the ones we're interested in."
“Now is not the time.” There was a stern quality to his voice which just begged for Harry to talk back.
He let himself into Dumbledore’s quarters with ease. The door was guarded by the portrait of an old wizard who spent more of is time sleeping than actually awake. As soon as Severus darkened the portrait with his shadow, the old man had opened his eyes long enough to see that it was him before swing the door open falling fast asleep again. Dumbledore was sitting by the hearth with a set of tea for two as if he had been expecting him. For all he knew, he had been. The old wizard had always seemed to know more than he should and yet he was obviously mostly unaware of Harry and his friends and their scheming. In the poor light of the dying fire, the former Headmaster looked older than ever, his tired eyes filled with something that looked like regret. If he hadn’t been witness to the man’s acts of insanity in the past few months Severus might honestly feel remorse for him.
"Nothing. I don't know." Harry worried his hand through his hair before continuing. "I just know that I find you extremely attractive, and not just physically. You make me laugh, you're smart, and easy to talk to. I feel safe around you and I don't know why completely, maybe because of the war. I know in a fight you could hold your own. I guess the most important thing is that with you I feel like myself. I feel like I don't need to be the savior or any of that shit. I can be me and I feel like that's good enough for you." Harry watched Draco for any signs that he had been wrong, that he couldn't be himself.
"It just might have." Harry retorted cheekily linking his arm with the younger girl as they walked out of the building and through the streets of Diagon Alley.
"If you want to talk we can, but I understand if you don't." Harry let the statement hang between them before getting his own plate and tea, sitting opposite Draco.
“Thank you, I rather think I did.” Neville smiled and drank his well deserved tea, feeling optimistic about the path ahead, despite the night they’d just had.
"Don't worry about you? You should have been a Gryffindor for all your foolishness!" Astoria laughed, her wand aimed and ready. "
“Always the gentleman.” Harry laughed, kissing the blond firmly on the lips. “I think we should call the meeting early, we have more important things to discuss anyways.”
"They're dark magic." Neville piped up, Blaise and Draco nodded, but Snape was not surprised to see that no one else did. They were very rare magic and he was a bit surprised that the three had even heard about them in the first place.
"Well is there anything we can do?" Blaise asked and Ginny smiled. Without answering she moved over in the cot, extending her hand to Blaise. The boy let her take his hand and she pulled him up onto the cot with her. When he was settled beside her, she pulled his arm around her shoulder and rested her head on his chest.
“Wow.” Draco mumbled when Harry pulled out and collapsed next to him on the bed.
“You’re family too.” Draco said before his mother could respond, his eyes narrowing as he looked to Harry as if to dare him to say otherwise.
"I never knew that everyone in the house was so close." Blaise observed from Harry's other side. "I know I would have looked down on it before, but I kind of like it."
"Harry where have you been?" Just as the boy expected Hermione and Ron sat waiting for him in the common room. The whole room was empty, most likely because the two had cleared it which meant that the rest of the students were waiting near the stairs listening.
The week passed slowly for Harry and he knew why. It was the last week that Dumbledore would remain in residence at Hogwarts before being brought before the Wizengoamot. He had a feeling that the wizard would call on him at least once more, their last meeting had not provided him with nearly enough information on the task at hand. He found that he dreaded the summons for more reasons that he originally suspected. In the time since he had learned that the old wizard would be removed from the school he had struggled with a range of emotions. He mourned the loss of the kind man who had shown him comfort and love, but he loathed the same manipulative man who had housed him with his abusive relatives without explanation. It was hard to marry the two vastly different personalities in Dumbledore and thus Harry was left feeling mostly numb toward the entire ordeal.
"I'm sure he is, love." Draco did the rest of the necessary wand work, though he hand-folded the parchment into a paper crane.
“Good luck mate, he can be even more stubborn than me when he puts his mind to it.” Ron moved to sit with Hermione, wrapping his arm around her while Ginny took Harry’s usual seat by the fire, resigned to sitting and waiting with the others.
"There was a reason why we went to see Bill today." Harry nodded to Luna, who took out multiple pieces of parchment and started to hand them out. "Memorize those coordinates, the paper will burn up when you're done."
"Good answer, love." While everyone in their house and in the DA knew about their relationship they had agreed to keep it low key. With the possibility of there being one or more spies for Voldemort in the school, it was too dangerous to come out. It had been Draco's worry for his mother, who they assumed to still be under house arrest and possibly in grave danger, that really made them hide their relationship. Draco couldn't bare to think that his actions might cause his Mum more harm.
"I wouldn't let your guard down again." Pansy replied, dancing around Hermione, her focus completely on their duel. "
"He cares for Draco and Draco is like my son." Emotion threatened to break through and Snape adverted his eyes for a moment, collecting himself. Draco was the only thing he had to live for, he would die protecting his son and if Harry meant something to him then of course he would care for the boy as well.
"I was going to have the crest changed to the Malfoy's, but then I thought that paying homage to your mother's family might just suit this new beginning we've all started on since-" Harry knew that he didn't need to continue, knew that Draco understood. Whether it was because he was still entranced by the beauty of the preserved room, or because he knew too well what Harry had meant and was too moved to find the words to properly thank the other man, Draco stood in silence, not able to respond. Either way, Harry just knew that Draco understood what he was trying to say and that made him almost as happy as the look on Draco's face.
“Severus, come back to the castle post haste. We need you.” Harry’s voice fell from the patronus’ lips. Of course the brat needed him now. He did truly respect the boy, but he’d had enough of being summoned for a life time. It seemed that Dumbledore and that drink would have to wait.
“How come Dumbledore didn’t suggest that?” The anger that was so ingrained in him when he thought of the old wizard returned and he wondered if the man purposely lead them astray, though he admittedly couldn’t puzzle out why he would do that. There would have been on benefit to him to jeopardize this mission. If he had truly wanted Harry dead there would have been many easier ways to accomplish it.
"What did Voldemort task you with?" Harry turned in time to see Draco flinch. Rolling his eyes he added, "Fear of the name will only cause fear of the thing itself."
"I don't know why your patronus changed, but I do know that even though I like you a lot, I'm not trying to pressure you into anything." Harry began to draw circles gently on his arm with his right hand.

The next fifteen minutes stretched on in a tense silence until Severus was sure that they had been hidden beneath the trap door for nothing short of a week. The rug that acted as an umbrella to shield them from possible capture also did wonders muffling the noise, so any dull scratch or creak could have been mundane or could have been the boots of their perusers pacing above. Narcissa seemed to be the most aware that she had been in some months and she stayed silent, her thin body pressed against his, though he took some solace in the fact that the tremors that ran through her small frame was fear and not residual effects of her long lasting torture. Some solace that was.
“Hey, good work today.” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear, before leaning in for a kiss. “I think you deserve a reward.”
"You sure it was a smart idea to give him full access." Ron asked Harry, looking a bit frightened by their professor's facial expression.
"Okay everyone I just need your attention for a few more minutes! I want to make sure that everyone gets back to their dorms okay without running into any issues. An older student should escort one or two younger ones at a time first and then everyone else can go in small groups after. We're going to meet again next week, the time and date will be sent via the same method as last year, younger years get the information from an older year and we will provide you with the coins next time. Also next week will be a practical lesson so please be prepared."
"And I'm telling you that you have to be more crafty about it than that. If you just ask him outright about obviously dark magic then he'll just deny it, or report you. It doesn't matter that you're the boy who lived, he's not just going to
"It's Voldemort's isn't it? It has his magical signature, I would recognize it anywhere." Again Dumbledore nodded, the wrinkles and worry lines on his face seemed to deepen.
" Salazar hissed in parseltongue as he slid into the frame.

"Draco take Hermione to the kitchen's, Neville and I will get someone to take this
“I think I know a way to get information on the locket. The house elf that belongs to the Blacks, he might know what happened to the locket.” Draco offered his thoughts.
"Merlin, I love you." Draco whispered in response and Harry's heart suddenly began to beat faster. Sure he had asked Draco to prove that he had loved him, but he had never actually said the words yet.
"So you are working together." Dumbledore nearly growled, but Harry merely shook his head.
"Why yes you are." Harry joked back, pulling back from Hermione and checking the time. "We ought to go to dinner and then come back here before the meeting, there are still a few things we need to go over, and something that I need you two to sign."
“You’re going to want to save your strength for tonight. I thought it best to have dinner brought up to us just in case you hadn’t eaten.” Dumbledore spoke in his normal serene tone which instantly put Harry’s hackles up.
"I know, little brother." Blaise smiled fondly at the boy would would forever be like a sibling to him. He had never seen Draco so vulnerable before, and the fact that he was willing to open up and allow Blaise access to his thoughts was amazing. He had a feeling that Harry had something to do with the sudden transformation. "Come here."
"Hey Gin, you okay?" Harry sat behind the girl, straddling the bench, pulling her into a hug from behind. He looked over his shoulder at Draco who smiled gently and nodded that he was okay.
Carefully guarding his mind once more he looked to Voldemort, trying to gauge wether or not the man saw the change in his demeanor. It seemed that he still had some trust in the evil wizard, however, because he seemed to not notice Snape's reactions and his attention was focused on the cowering witch before him.
“Alright Mundungus, we’re going to have a drink at the bar and laugh this off and then you’re not going to talk about this ever again.”
"Oh, hey." Draco looked up to Harry, his gaze uncertain. "You know it's not fair to them that you're always coming here to talk to me, but won't give them the time of day." Draco's gaze bore into Harry and the Gryffindor instantly felt ashamed. He was right.
“That is hardly true.” Severus could not conceive a world where Harry would ever truly be alone. There were too many that loved and cared for him. Draco alone would never leave the boy’s side. And loath as he was to admit it, the band of unruly teens that had come to Harry’s aid would never let the boy face anything alone again. It didn’t seem like a good idea to tell Dumbledore all of this, however. The man was paranoid enough as it were and he did not need to add to this.
"Will you always put me before yourself like that? You seem more worried about me than anything you might be feeling." It was an honest question and Draco stood by the door waiting for the answer.
"I'm sure that won't be necessary, Sir." Harry spoke evenly, but was clearly shaking.
Draco made slow work of disrobing Harry, taking his time to gently kiss and lick every inch of skin as he exposed it. He started at the boy's long neck, working gently on the flesh as his long fingers took care with each button of Harry's shirt. Silent tears still fell from green eyes and Draco alternated between kissing him and gently wiping them away. At any other time Draco might have been offended that Harry was crying, especially with all of the attention that the blond was bestowing upon him, but he understood the pain that the brunet was feeling and he resolved to continue to make sure that he knew that he was loved.
reported me for smuggling dark objects. I'm not sure how I could have done that however because I was out of the country visiting a colleague. I've been gone for three months and I just got back two nights ago." Draco said bitterly, preparing his midnight snack with a thin layer of butter, doing his best to keep the anger out of his tone.
Dumbledore was right behind him. He might not be able hear or see him, but he could feel the old man’s magic like a flame at his back. He was old and his mental wellbeing was rightfully being called into question, but there was no doubt that Dumbledore was one of the most powerful wizards still alive. The horcrux had sapped his strength and his health, but it had not stolen his magic. He was a constant presence behind, though that did little to comfort the boy. He was moving into unfamiliar territory with a man he was not sure he could trust literally at his back.
"I could care less about house unity, I'd put my money on the best and that is obviously you." This time Ginny really did blush and everyone around her laughed with an exception to Ron who seemed to be trying to keep his food down at his sister's obvious flirting.
” The spell shot through the air and shattered the shield. The force of the two spells rebounding knocked Ginny off her feet once again and she fell back, her wand gripped tight in her hand. Draco watched her from the other side, not willing to move. This was meant to be a friendly competition and while he wasn’t going to throw in the towel to check and see if she was okay, he didn’t want to hurt her.

"I know." Harry smiled, before dropping the look and taking his leave.

"That was a really good demonstration." Neville said as he took down the protective shield and handed each girl goblets of water. "It's getting a bit late though, we might want to wrap up." Hermione nodded, taking the goblet gratefully and downing it in one go. Handing it back to Neville, she moved to the head of the room to wrap up the night since Harry was still busy with the potions lesson.
Dumbledore hardly seemed bothered by his lack of enthusiasm which only lead to further infuriate the potions master. “Come now, what seems to be the matter?”
” The boy retaliated before Ginny gained her bearings.
"Turn around." Draco whispered in the brunet's ear, nipping at it gently. When he moved on his back, Draco instantly kissed him on the lips catching Harry by surprise.
“It never is.”
"Dumbledore can no longer be trusted." It was a statement, not a question, one that Harry was more than a bit relieved to here the older man say.
” Ginny extended her arm, pouring all of her magic into the spell.
"How could I not be? No more tonight, though, love unless you're trying to kill me." Draco sighed, moving until he was comfortable.
As always Dumbledore seemed to know that he was coming because the door that lead to his chambers was already open. He walked past the portrait of a Headmaster of old, though Harry couldn’t name who, and found a roaring fire already set. There was no one sitting on the plush couch, but there was tea set for two and a plate of desserts. Harry took a seat not bothering to help himself to the food or drink that was laid out to him. He knew that Dumbledore would never poison him, but he didn’t put it past him to try and slip veritaserum into his food, again. He hardly believed that the man had been fooled by his performance in the hospital wing, or the last time he had taken tea with the Headmaster, and the effort to play such mind games hardly felt worth it any longer.
"Do me a favor, next time don't bring him over when he's in one of his moods. There are reasons I didn't push for the both of you to stay when you found your flat." Harry rolled his eyes. He loved Ron, the boy had been his best mate for far too long, but he knew that there were times where it was best to just let him be.
The core was sitting around in their usual places around the breakfast table on Saturday morning. They had plans to set out and work on the house, since it was a Hogsmeade weekend and they could easily slip off in the sleepy town. McGonnagal would have been the only professor that they would have had to be weary of, but she was staying in the castle more and more now and it was almost a given that she would not be supervising the trips that normally were her duty. All of the spells had already been researched by Hermione, Pansy, Ginny, and Harry and Draco and Blaise had been busy the past few weeks with Neville, pouring over old tomes of architectural spells. Ron was going to be the chief spell worker on most of the building spells because he knew many from having to help fix up the Burrow over the years. Seamus and Dean were in charge of taking down the trees necessary to build the frame, this was a particularly difficult task because while the land they had was vast and there were a lot of trees on the property, they didn't want to completely destroy the life on the property. Equally they wouldn't be able to go off too far because trees suddenly disappearing would not go unnoticed. Because they were meant to be moving the most around the property, they were also acting as look outs should something go wrong.
"What do you mean he ordered the raid?" Hearing Harry's raised voice, Draco followed it to the library. Peeking his head in he realized that he was having a fire chat with Hermione. He almost made his presence known, but stopped when he heard Hermione's next words.
"No we're over because you can't let go of the past and move on!" Hermione shouted back and tears came back to her eyes. She fingered her engagement ring for a moment longer before slipping it off and letting it drop to the floor.
"Excuse me?"
"I would have never guessed." Draco's old drawl had returned, but the slight upturn of his lips was genuine and Hermione ignored it entirely, favoring to spread a thin layer of jam on her own helping of pancakes, glancing at the unhealthy amount on Harry’s plate with disgust.
"I don't have a lot of time to explain. Dumbledore is taking care of the two students who attacked them. I have to move these three back to Mr. Malfoy's dorms and retrieve Miss Parkinson from Slytherin. It is no longer safe for her there. Miss Lovegood you might want to move in as well. I'm sure you dorm is safe, but moving to and from them might not be. It is up to you."
"Only when they've just had a row, or the opposite." Harry's grin almost became a leer and Hermione's bright pink cheeks were enough to tell Draco just what Harry meant by
"I've missed you too my boy, but you haven't come it to catch up have you?" The twinkle in Kingsley's eyes made Harry think a bit of Dumbledore and the guilt hit him even harder.
The group ate in relative silence, though they kept up at least a normal level of banter as to not cause unwanted attention. Luna was sitting with them as well, which wasn't all too out of the ordinary, but Harry was noticing well trained glances from McGonnagal and was preparing himself for a long conversation with the Headmistress before leaving for Hogsmeade. As if she read his mind, McGonnagal started to make her way toward their table. Only Hermione seemed to notice, and she gently nudged Harry from his right.
"Tell me if you know what's good for you."
Their lips met and at first the kiss was tentative. Both men were trying to figure the other out, trying to ascertain who would take dominance. Harry was the first to back down, allowing Draco to take control of the kiss. It quickly turned passionate and soon Draco was nipping at Harry's bottom lip, loving the small sounds he was making. When Harry granted him entrance Draco plunged forth greedily, wanting to claim his mouth, to ensure that Harry would never think of anyone but him.
"Merlin, that would be fabulous." The duo entered the common room last, their conversation breaking off when they heard the loud cheers and cries of congratulations.
"Harry, we are your
“Thank you,” She smiled sincerely at the raven haired boy. “Well I really don't have much else to tell."
"What is your patronus?" Snape sounded bored at the point, but Harry knew it was an act, he could tell that Snape was watching him carefully, as if he was trying to work out if he had a plan or if his young, rash actions were about to get everyone in trouble.
." The chilling calmness in which the curse was cast was even more frightening than Bellatrix's obvious madness. As Lucius fell to the floor in agony, screams ripped from him causing his raw vocal cords to scream in pain, his only thought was that at least Narcissa wasn't alone, at least he could share in her torture.
"It wasn't my thing to tell you!" Harry defended himself. He knew that lying to them and avoiding his friends was wrong, but he didn’t feel like this was an issue. Draco's story was his own to tell.
Draco took the short walk to their bedroom door to compose his thoughts. Part of him was hurt that, despite everything Harry shared with him, the trio in their common room still seemed to know more about the raven haired boy. He knew that it wasn’t like his lover had purposely not mentioned something, Draco knew that with all of the drama and stress that Harry was already going through he had little time to dwell on little else. While something as important as Voldemort sharing a bit of his mind seemed like a rather large deal to the blond, he couldn’t help but feel like it fell a bit short on the brunet’s list of priorities. When he finally found himself at their closed bedroom door, Draco took another deep breath before knocking.
“I don’t either, but there is no other way.” Harry sighed as he looked around the room at somber faces. “We’ll leave shortly, it’s best we get this over with.”
“Why didn’t you wake me?” Harry brushed his hands through Draco’s hair before pulling him for a deep kiss. “I missed you when I woke up.”
"Not well."
"What on Earth are you wearing, Draco?" Severus asked the boy he viewed as his son with disdain.
"He actually asked me to start up a smaller group within the DA, he thinks it will be necessary to completely cut Dumbledore out. The old man is up to something and it's got Snape worried."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah." Draco smiled slightly, grateful that Harry had everything under control. "What did you do? We both felt something happen with our magic."
Smirking Draco slid back up Harry's body to quiet him with a kiss. Harry attacked Draco's lips with his own, biting and sucking on his bottom lip while his hands ran up and down his back, scratching him in an attempt to get him closer. Draco started to reach for the lube next to the bed, but Harry stopped him.
More people were coming down the hall from the other end, Harry vaguely made out the shape of Hermione's bushy hair and Severus' flowing cape before the two were close enough to actually be identifiable. Along with them were the three other heads of houses and Professor Dumbledore himself.
"I don't think he's hiding from Draco." Severus sounded put out by this, but he didn't say as much. The look on his face was calculating and Albus was sure that this time he was worried about Harry's actions and not for the boy himself.
"I detect an attitude, I might have to place you in detention." Snape's brow rose in question as Harry visibly blanched. He was sure that Snape knew something big was going to happen that night and this was his way of stopping it from happening.
With a curt nod, Harry left, knowing that the conversation was far from over, but he wasn't about to push Snape further. He simply had too much to do before the night was up to bother with the man.
"You don't seem to be complaining now." Draco grinned, pulling him closer.
"Okay, I would send Ms. Parkinson a letter, hopefully she can help us uncover what is going on."
“Wonderful.” Severus intoned, his voice dry.
"But there's nothing that can be done?" Harry asked annoyed, he knew that Kingsley couldn't just overturn the Auror Department but he was hoping something could be done.
"So I heard from my lovely older brother that Malfoy is living with you and he's less than happy about the matter." Ginny looked to Harry for confirmation as they walked from the sitting room to the kitchen.
"Good to see you boys finally come to your senses, now off you go Mr. Potter, I'm sure Draco can find his own way up to his room."
Harry was sitting with Ginny, Blaise, and Ron pouring over more books in the library when the patronus of a fox appeared before them. George’s voice came from the small creature as it spoke. “Harry, he admitted to stealing the locket and he said he sold it to a wizard named Artikus Bruch.”
"What's that boy's name?" Draco asked as the group touched down. Harry was standing so close to him and Draco had to fight off the blush that was trying to make its way up his neck. He wanted so badly to take the boys hand, or even lean into him to know that things between them were still okay.
"He does do that occasionally." Draco laughed, snuggling into Harry's arms. "What where you two talking about? You where locked up in there for a while."
"As am I, my dear boy. I'm afraid that I'm getting old and weary, I'm not sure how much longer I will be able to keep my post here at the school." Again Harry watched him carefully.
, but didn't know because no one would address it. He hadn't been in love with Harry when he'd first casted it, at least he was pretty sure that he hadn't. No he had to assess every situation and confront it head on. That was what he was meant to do because he was a Malfoy, he was
The last place that Severus ever wanted to find himself was in the Malfoy’s formal dining room, alone with Voldemort. He wasn’t entirely alone, though. Narcissa still lay in her cage in the corner, though her whimpering and long since been silenced. If he didn’t look, he could almost forget what a horrible state she was in. Voldemort was in a particularly vile mood and he had taken it out on her before turning his red eyes to Severus.
I just wanted to thank everyone of my readers! You guys are the best! If you’re looking to read more of my work, I’ve self-published a book! It’s about vampires set in a fantasy world in the equivalent of a medieval era. They are on the brink of a civil war as well as being dangerously close to being exposed to the ignorant humans who live right on their borders. The book is called Born in Shadows and can currently be purchased on Amazon both in paperback and Kindle. Here is the
"Demelza Robins scores the first goal of the season! That was a fantastic play by Gryffindor's chasers, but a bit basic. They're going to have to pull out all the stops if they want to outsmart Slytherin this game!" Justin yelled above the roaring cheers from the Gryffindor side.
Something passed between the two, it was as if their past had suddenly been pushed even farther back in their minds. Of course neither could deny what had happened, a war doesn't just disappear from memory, but something in Harry's actions opened a new door and closed the old, battered one that lead to their shared past. The tension in the air lessened and was replaced by anxiousness. Before, they had hated each other, spending their time feeling only anger toward the other, but now everything was new, different, uncertain. Ever since Draco consciously chose to seek help from his school enemy they were set on a new path that lead to them to where they were now and honestly Draco didn't see anything wrong with where he was in life right then and there.
Luna had theorized that Ravenclaw’s diadem could be one, it seemed fitting that Voldemort would use items from Hogwarts as that was the only true home he had ever known. The only issue was that the diadem was lost, according to Luna no one had seen it in centuries. From there it was speculation. They had no idea what the item from Hufflepuff could be, but it had been decided upon that there was no way that Riddle would have sought out one of Gryffindor’s treasures. The matter of the locket was a tough on. Draco had been the one to point out that R.A.B. was Regulus Black, Sirius’ younger bother, but they could not risk going back to the Order’s headquarters to search for the thing.
"I am so proud of you, son." Snape pulled the boy into a strong hug making Draco gasp in surprise. He had never once in his life heard his father say those words to him, he had long since abandoned hope of hearing them from the man at all when he started to realize just how twisted he was. With Snape, Draco understood that he too came from a dysfunctional family and while he might always be proud of Draco, he was terrible at expressing emotions, so hearing the words from him was a welcomed shock.
"Leave them alone, won't you? Always getting in everyone's business." The look they exchanged was fond though and left everyone laughing along with them.
"Well he's a moron, I wouldn't be caught dead with an idiot of his measure."
"Oh yeah? Why don't you enlighten me." Harry grinned wolfishly, his eyes opening wide, his pupils blown wide. Swiftly, he pulled out his invisibility cloak and threw it over both of them. Harry pulled Draco close so the two could make haste toward the castle. Harry walked behind Draco, one arm wrapped around Draco's waist, while the other was moving up the boy's heavy sweater, under his robes, ghosting lightly over his pale skin.
"If you're worried about what my idiot brother would think I'm sure in a few days he'll come around, but I'm not sure how long it will take him to get used to the idea of you fancying

." At Draco's snippy comment, Harry's head snapped up and their eyes met, watching the other for a reaction, after a minute passed Draco adverted his eyes. "Sorry, habit." He muttered before returning to his midnight snack.
"Are you saying all we have to do to end this is kill that

“I don’t know what I am supposed to do when I get back though, what if the barrier isn’t broken?”
"The diary that Harry stabbed in his second year."
“Professor,” Harry reached out and was waved away.
"Well there must be something that we can do." Pansy asked.
Ron said bitterly and Hermione nudged him gently to stop him from creating a scene.
"Will he be taking over as leader?" It was another good question, one that the six hadn't actually given any thought.
It didn't take much more convincing and soon Harry's arms and legs were secured to the bed. Draco was straddling his stomach, staying clear away form his aching cock on purpose much to Harry's displeasure. Curling his body down so he could reach his neck, Draco gently sucked on Harry's ear lobe, whispering dirty words in Harry's ear.
"You're not the only one, Severus was always horrible at cooking." Draco said, rolling his eyes at old, fond memories.
“Quite,” he nodded, though he knew exactly what Draco meant. He had no doubt that the raven-haired, green-eyed boy serving up breakfast the floor below had something to do with it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We mean you no harm, just come with us.” George took the man’s arm, smiling around the bar to anyone who dared stare at them. “Stop the sputtering now, Mundungus, these good people are going to think we’re being unpleasant to you.”
"It's about so much more than that." The girl rolled her eyes. She was sick and tired of dealing with complete idiots. "Just don't do anything stupid until I give you orders, are we clear?"
“I don’t suppose we can ask Bill for help,” Pansy said, her tone saying that she knew her suggestion would be impossible.
"Harry take Miss Lovegood to the Hospital Wing, I will take care of these two." Snape intoned from behind them as he levitated Nott first then Astoria. A quick glance at the man showed that he had likely put on a glamour as he didn’t even look like he’d just been crying. ”I will have to wipe their memories and alter them so they don't report me to the Dark Lord, but I will be sure to check on you three there so don't leave.”
"I'm not sure," Hermione faltered. She had read the chapter ahead of time as always, and since she had cast it before, so what was she missing?
