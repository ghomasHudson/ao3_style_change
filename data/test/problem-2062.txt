After a minute or two of watching students and teachers twirl on the dance floor, he felt a hand on his shoulder. "Draco!" Harry exclaimed, jumping up to see long, purple hair and chestnut brown eyes. "Who's this Draco? My name is Alex," Draco grinned. "Sorry I kept you waiting, girls like to gossip. They wanted to know all about me."
That didn't exactly work, as Harry's ruthless uncle slammed open the door and sent Harry flying across his room. "HOW DARE YOU DO THAT THING IN MY HOUSE! I HAVE THE RIGHT MIND TO THROW YOU OUT OF HERE!" Harry scrambled up and saw Dudley and Petunia standing at the door. "Don't have your Dumble-dick to protect you now do you? He's DEAD, isn't he!" Petunia laughed coming in and kicking Harry over. She walked back out, laughing to herself and Dudley followed her. Vernon however, shut Harry's window and curtains and stood over Harry. "Your going to be sorry you ever took that- that wand out in my house!" He chuckled, his words going through Harry like venom.
"Alright my little monkey, come down now!" Draco called, chuckling. Harry climbed down the tree but then almost immediately found another one and started running up to it. The top of the tree was in the makeshift blue sky of the room and when Harry looked down, all he could see was a tiny spec that was his boyfriend.
Harry quickly retaliated and grabbed her first, not even inches away from Draco's face and growled, thrusting his other arm out as if to protect Draco. "What was that for!" Draco shouted, annoyed as Hermione took her hand back. Harry hadn't even registered what he did until he saw Hermione inspecting him closely.
He smiled as he wandered out the eighth year tower and heading towards the seventh floor. The door was still there after whoever last went in, and Harry gripped his wand tightly and let out a shaky breath. He pushed the door open and was greeted by darkness. "H- hello?" Harry called.
"Alright, come and sit down now Harry!" Draco snorted as Harry fell over when he jumped off the tree. Draco couldn't help but smile when his boyfriend spotted another tree and his eyes widened like a kid in a play park.

"I know that you didn't fall off your broom, Harry." George said sternly. Harry's head snapped up in shock. "What? How would you know- did Ron tell you, Hermione, who else knows?" He gasped in utter horror. "I didn't know. I just thought that it was odd, that Harry Potter, youngest seeker in a century who I've been flying with for years, suddenly falls off his broom. Now what actually happened?" He smirked.
"-I'm sorry Gin!" Ron shouted. "I really am. I don't know what came over me, and we're working on it!" He sighed. "Working on it isn't enough. Come and find me when you've learned how to pull your head out of your arse and see the world for what it really is. Come and find me, when you're my brother again and not some imposter who thinks one witch or wizard isn't equal to another because of who they love." Ginny snarled, then walked out of the portrait hole.
"That's just ghastly. He's lucky that I love him so much. Maybe I can persuade him to look at things differently," Hermione nodded. At that point, Ron walked in and looked at Harry and Hermione.
Harry sobbed as Mrs Weasley pulled him into a hug. He could feel her sorrow as she hugged him and pushed away. "You don't need to be sorry Harry. I'm just glad your okay." She said, reading his thoughts, then turned back to her son. Harry got up and walked away, unable to watch as they mourned over Fred. He couldn't even bare to look at George, knowing how lost he must feel to have his other half ripped away.
Harry looked back and saw Hermione practically not even on her seat anymore. Harry got up and started walking over to her with a sad face. "Oh Harry, I'm sorry!" She frowned, reading his face. "I'm not," Harry smirked. "What? But, you... he-"
"Are we really going to allow him on the stands? Look at him, disgusting little gay boy, crying like the fairy he is!" A high pitched voice squealed from behind Fudge. Dolores Umbridge sat there, stupid little pink bow in her hair and ugly toad face scrunched up in disgust. "Gay?" Harry heard a gasp from the crowd and saw Molly Weasley looking as if she were trying to figure out a very difficult puzzle in her head. Sirius, Hermione and a few others let out cries of outrage and Harry felt more than saw Draco growling under his breath, ready to pounce if somebody said one more thing about his soulmate.
Harry started to sweat a bit from the body heat and moved away. He wiped the sweat off his forehead, and looked down to see blood on the back of his hand, which soon disappeared under his glamour. Harry was praying to Merlin that Malfoy didn't see, and it appeared that he didn't as all he did was merely mutter another 'thanks' and disapperated.
"It's beautiful," Harry said breathlessly. "This is all I ever wanted. To talk with you, to sing with you. I love you guys." Wait. Was Harry cheating? Draco burst through the door and saw Harry sitting on his bed with two ghosts either side of him.
"I'm sorry for calling on you earlier, with Aunt Petunia. I was thinking though, if you knew that I was with her at the time, why did you come?" Harry asked. "To be honest with you, my love, I did want to see my sister. When I died, all spells were lifted from me, including her memory charm, so I already knew. I wanted to murder her for treating you the way she did, the way she let her family treat you and the marks they all left upon you, physical and mental. But, she was my sister and I will always love her no matter how much I hate what she did, and trust me, I do. There was a part of me, even if it was just a slice- a slither, that wanted to speak with her one last time." Lily stopped and brushed her hair out of her face.
In the end, Sirius had to floo back to Grimmauld Place as it was getting late but he told Harry he would be back the next day. Reluctantly, Harry let go of his Godfather and headed back to eighth year tower.
"We walked in on him playing in third year. He stopped as soon as he saw us though, so we never really heard anything and didn't press the matter," Dean shrugged. Harry wobbled back out, almost tripping over multiple rugs and foot stalls and table legs, saying sorry to each of them.

"Anyway, we found and destroyed the real locket but then got kidnapped by snatchers. We were taken to Malfoy Manor and we escaped but Wormtail and Dobby were killed. We made our way back to Hogwarts, after getting the cup out of Bellatrix Lestranges valt and there was a war. That's why things may seem a bit out of place now."
"That is all we need to hear, Cornelius. Sirius Black is an innocent man! He will walk free from this day forward!" Madame Bones grinned and there was applause and cheering heard from all around the room. The heavy, gruesome chains binding Sirius to the chair unbuckled with a loud clank and slid back into the chair.
He missed running his fingers through Draco's soft, silky hair and his soft, thin lips that were just perfect for kissing. He missed that stupid, smug smirk that played on his lips that he pretended to hate but actually loved.
"I- I really thought that it was something real, that we had something, but it was all a foul trick! A fucking- I trusted him! It's mid November and I've already been through so much with him, I fell in love with him! And it was all just some stupid game," Harry growled. "But, what about the encanta bond?" Ginny asked. Harry made the heart appear on his wrist and saw with shock that it was completely black. "Black it goes when one falls out of love or life becomes barely endearing" Harry whispered, reciting what the book had said. "I guess both are true now."
"No thanks, I'm swamped with homework. I need to get it done before Monday," Harry replied, rolling his eyes. Ron and Hermione came down later and announced they were going on a date that day, which left Harry to himself.
"Not that." Said Sirius sharply as Harry took a small bite. "I can't believe your back, Sirius. We all thought that... Well, how?" Hermione smiled, interrupting the awkward silence. "I'll explain later. Harry, why don't you go and get Ginny. She is your girlfriend after all you should be eating with her. You have to get past the just kissing stage at some point!" Sirius winked, and Harry, and Draco who was listening in on their conversation, choked and almost spat out their drinks.
"Good luck Pads," Harry muttered to Sirius who had began to sweat from nervousness. "Thanks." he sighed and sent a small smile Harry's way.
"When you were born, one of my biggest wishes was that you would grow up to be like Lily. I was a reckless kid, absolutely reckless- I enjoyed it of course, don't get me wrong, but I was definitely stupid at times.
"Does this mean that you two are... together?" Ron said, clear unhappiness in his voice as he whispered so that nobody else could hear. "Yes, and if you are going to be a complete dick about it Weasel, then you can go and pack your bags and shove your homophobic thoughts right up your arse, because to be quite frank with you, I don't have time for that shit." Draco snarled and Ron held up his hands in surrender.
He couldn't hear anything going on in the classroom anymore, just enormous amounts of pain coursing through him. The spell stopped and started again multiple times, each hit being worse than the last.
"I've heard all the information I need to hear!" Fudge spat suddenly, his eyes now locked on Harry, squinting in disgust. "Take him to Azkaban."
Harry nodded and stood there in an awkward silence. "I should go," Petunia frowned and Harry nodded. Draco came into view, leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed and a sour look on his face. Petunia raised her hand and Harry instinctivly squeezed his eyes shut and flinched away. However, Petunia just gave his shoulder a pat and then walked out of the room and left with just the sound of the door closing behind her.
The images of the small family faded away and were now replaced by a wedding ceremony. A bride with a waterfall of red hair and dazzling dress stood opposite a handsome man who had somewhat managed to make his hair to all go in one direction. Sirius stood beside James whilst Remus and Peter sat in the front row. "She's so beautiful." Harry whispered as Lily Evans- soon to be Potter, recited her vows.
Harry felt Draco's tongue skim across his bottom lips, asking for entrance but Harry denied, wanting to play. Harry ran his fingers through Draco's new hair. Then, Draco lightly bit Harry's lip, making him gasp and Draco took this chance to slip his tongue in.
"Amazing plan Harry, but aren't you forgetting something? You haven't even asked Malfoy yet," she giggled. Harry's smile dropped as he remembered. The other boy probably wouldn't even want to go with him.
"HARRY!" Hermione yelled, running in. "What, what is it? Are you alright? Are you hurt?" Harry panicked, quickly jumping up and grabbing his wand. "Yes, yes! I've just had a brilliant idea!" She squealed.
"Look what you've done you stupid boy!" Vernon spat at Harry, who didn't even know he was being spoken to until Draco was pushed out the way and he had been smacked round the back of the head. "Don't, Vernon." Petunia said softly, surprising everyone once again. "Why, would you like to do him in yourself, sweetheart? Try to knock a bit more freakishness out of him?" Vernon said, grinning evilly, his purple face swelling even further with the joy of hurting his nephew. "I- I have something to confess. I... I was a witch at Hogwarts until my fourth year," Petunia squeaked.
"Wait, what?" Draco said. "I'm going to need you to come with me Potter! You are going to Azkaban, I believe there is a cell empty next to the one where your Godfather will be sent to after his trial!" Fudge snarled, chuckling maliciously. He moved to grab Harry, but Draco shot in-between them, growling and snarling. Fudge looked shocked and tried to push Draco out of the way, but Harry buried this feeling of wanting to attack and rip the face off of he minister and grabbed Draco lightly and pulled him behind. They couldn't risk being exposed.
Harry hadn't said a word since the battle ended. Since Tom was finally brought to his end. Blood, bodies and rubble lay scattered all over the castle grounds, and as Harry looked around, he felt all the pain. All the guilt, he had taken all of these peoples lives away, it was his fault. He felt a hand on his shoulder and turned around. It was Hermione, all beaten and bloodied up, tears streaming silently down her face.
Harry took off the cape and took out the fangs then turned himself into Jacob. He took his glasses off, put some contacts in and hid his things away before heading back to the great hall in his new face and tux.
Draco looked at Harry sympathetically, knowing how much his Godfather meant to him. "You won't be found guilty, Harry. I hope not anyway! Plus I was reading up on the encanta bond yesterday and it said if the longer the two participants are away from each other the more enraged and dangerous they get!
Draco jumped off of the bed and Harry followed.  "I thought I locked the door," Harry muttered, kicking himself. "We are fucking WIZARDS mate, a locked door isn't going to do anything!" Ron snapped. "Ron, please let me explain-" Harry pleaded, but Ron wouldn't hear it.
The evening rolled around and Harry met Ginny outside of the portrait of the Fat Lady. "Hi Harry," she smiled, taking his hand. Harry smiled back as Ginny muttered the password and they stepped in. "Come up to my dorm, Harry," she said, dragging his arm. "But I thought boys couldn't-" Harry started. "Things changed after the war. McGonagall doesn't know though," she said, mischievous smirk upon her face.
His eyes were clutched tight. Harry was living in his own nightmare even though he was wide awake. "HARRY!" a voice shouted. Harry's eyes flew open and he saw rubble laying everywhere. He was in the castle grounds, the reminiscence of the war right in front of him.
He pushed past the blanket door, which was- like the rest of it- held up by magic. "Lumos," he muttered. When Draco got in, Harry knocked him to the cushiony floor and littered his face in kisses. "Does this all mean you believe me?" Draco asked hopefully. "Yeah, I believe you. I don't know why but I trust you on this- I'm still mad at you though," He stated, still lying on Draco, hands either side of his head, propping himself up.
Harry watched out the corner of his eye as Malfoy sat down next to Blaise Zabini, another 8th year. Ron and Hermione Came running in and sat opposite harry. "We're so sorry Harry, we had to.." but Hermione was cut off as McGonagoll stood up and began the sorting. Once all of the new students had sat down, the headmistress continued to stand at the front.
It was finally Saturday and people were rushing around their dorm rooms, getting their costumes ready for later that day. Hermione, Ginny, Draco and Harry went over their plan a million times until they had it to the utmost perfection.

It was a very small gesture, but Harry noticed that it was there. "Ron and I are going down to Hogsmeade next weekend together, do you want to come Harry?" Hermione asked. "No thanks Hermione, I have things that I need to do." Harry said, forcing a smile. That was a complete lie. Harry didn't have anything to do over the weekend that he knew of yet, he just didn't want to become the third wheel and sit awkwardly as Hermione and Ron shared a butterbeer and talked about their relationship.
"Oh, look who it is Harry!" The woman smiled, turning around to show a beautiful face with a softness which reminded him of something, but otherwise completely unfamiliar. Until he saw her eyes. They were ghostly and pale, but he could still make out the  bright green in them.
"I would like to use veritaserum on the man in question!" Fudge spat and took a vial from Umbridge. Nobody objected- it was not a pleasant potion but it would result in the truth once and for all. Two simple drops of the clear liquid fell into Sirius's mouth and everybody in the room waited with their breath held.
Harry shook the voice out of his head and cautiously glanced at the open book on the bed. "No Harry." Sirius said, giving him a hard glare. "Fine, whatever." Harry murmured, rolling his eyes. "You're meant to be eighteen, stop acting like a fifteen year old!" Sirius snapped strictly. The man and the boy glared at each other, then burst out laughing.

"I want to get to know you better, Draco. I feel I don't know too much about you," He shrugged. "Okay, ask me anything!" Draco smiled. Harry thought for a moment then asked "What's your middle name? Favourite spell? When's your birthday? Favourite subject? Are you a virgin? What's your patronus? Are you-"
"And you've been back two weeks and haven't even had the audacity to come and say hi, I am your sister and-"
Harry stood in a small room he recognised as a nursery. In the corner of this room, a man with scruffy black hair and a woman my bright, gleaming emerald eyes were singing to a small baby in their arms. Their voices were both delicate and sweet and little baby Harry was watching his parents in awe, falling asleep. "Ever wonder where you got your musical talents from?" Sirius asked from beside him. "I heard you playing once. You sounded just like your Dad I was freaking out until I heard a sort of softness in it then thought of Lily. You are so talented, Harry Potter and yet you don't seem to realize that."
Draco grinned, obviously proud of his progress with the boy whilst Harry madly blushed. "But really, Harry. Are you feeling okay?" Hermione pondered anxiously. "To be honest with you, no. But I'm better than I was that night. It was something Ron said that triggered something in my head and pushed me over the edge. Literally, I suppose!" He laughed half heartedly but stopped, seeing everyone else's glares.

As he was heading up the stairs, Uncle Vernon was coming down and thought it would be funny to trip Harry up, causing him to smash his head on the banister. Vernon laughed and carried on his way, whilst Harry went upstairs and got his wand. He decided to cast a glamour on himself, he didn't want whoever sent the note to freak out and run away.
"You're joking, Perce!" Shouted Fred as the death eater he was fighting collapsed under the weight of three separate stunning spells.

"When we got back from finding the fake locket, death eaters had broken into Hogwarts and... Snape killed Dumbledore." Sirius almost collapsed again. "That- that SNIVELLOUS! I swear to God, when I put my hands on him-"
Suddenly, there was a searing pain in Harry's forehead and he went into a state of panic. The last time he had felt pain like this was when Voldemort had been stood right next to Harry. Memories from the war broke Harry's mind, even though the pain had faded away.
"Harry, what is it? I got your patronus and you sounded so upset!" She rushed, pulling him into a tight hug. "It was a fake relationship," said Harry hoarsely. "Draco never loved me. He was playing and humiliating me all along." Ginny quickly explained what happened to Luna and Hermione so that Harry wouldn't have to repeat it again.
“A drake, like the majority of the Black Family.” Sirius explained easily, “Vamps and drakes make up a majority of my family lines.”
Narcissa pinched the bridge of her nose, “Draco, my love, Harry has come into a veela inheritance.” At her son’s confused look, “We are, well were, the only family in Great Britain with a male veela. Clearly this is a poorly attempted way of asking for advice on the matter.”
Remus patted his shoulder gently, a soft smile on his face, “Your worry for him just proves that you’re a kind hearted person Harry, and if it all goes wrong you still have Ron, Hermione, and us to fall back on.”
“Oh, was that not explained to you? How odd…” She tittered, “Well every creature inheritance also comes  with a designation. Submissive, dominant or enigma. Submissives usually carry children for their mate or in the odd case mates, tend to be kinder and less likely to hold grudges.”
“Wait until you get a response to your letter, if it is mean spirited then I wouldn't suggest it.” Narcissa replied, “Now hop to it, the house elves need to be notified.” With a quick nod Draco left the room, already thinking back to all of Harry’s preferred foods he’d seen him eat in the Great Hall.
“I know what you mean cub,” Remus reappeared, “We practically had to beg for Kreacher to stay at Grimmauld Place otherwise he’d be here.” He shook his head, a sad look behind his eyes, “Anyhow, letter had been sent off and we should expect a reply-”
Remus shook his head, muttering a small apology while Sirius looked conflicted. “Sirius, do you have experience with veelas?” He hoped his godfather wouldn’t lie to him.
“Did she really?” Harry spoke up as he reached the bottom of the stairs, fiddling with the hem of his shirt, “Why am I asking of course she did.” He laughed softly to himself as he shook his head before addressing his godfathers, “You never said what we were doing to celebrate my birthday so…” He trailed off and gestured to the outfit he had chosen. A simple but sturdy shirt, a nicer pair of pants and boots and he had somehow managed to curl his hair in a presentable fashion.
“Malfoy’s dad is a veela?” He murmured to himself, thinking back to the interactions he had had with Lucius in the past. “What...what is Malfoy’s mum’s inheritance?”
“Umbridge was employed as the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.” Remus muttered bitterly, “And she refused to teach a lot of the traditional curriculum.”
“Well if Narcissa responds well to this letter perhaps you’ll get a chance to tell him that yourself cub.” Remus muttered to him, low enough that Sirius wouldn’t hear. “I always thought the feud between Malfoys and Potters was daft.” He patted Harry’s shoulder before leaving the room to go find Hedwig.
“No need to apologize Harry, you’ve just come into your inheritance, your emotions are bound to be all over the place.” Remus reassured him, “I think you should write a letter back acknowledging the Malfoy boy and tell him your thoughts aren’t all in the right place right now.”
A hand ruffling gently through his hair pulled him from his thoughts, “Whatcha thinking so hard about cub?” Harry looked up and smiled at Remus’s genuinely curious expression.
“Well…” He stopped and scratched at his neck, “Not exactly? I mean Lucius is a male veela so I could write to Narcissa for help.” Sirius shook his head, “There’s no guarantee she’ll agree since the Malfoys and the Potters don’t exactly get along.” His godfather grimaced slightly.
“He’s right pup, and if it does go right well then you’ll have bragging rights of being the first Potter to genuinely befriend a Malfoy. Won’t that be terrific huh?” Sirius laughed to himself and Harry watched as Remus physically resisted rolling his eyes. “And who knows, maybe you’ll get him to change his mind regarding things like Muggle-borns and supposed blood traitors.”
“It’s sickening really, but not much we can do besides side with the goblins and hope that earns us their favor.” Sirius shrugged and they stopped in front of the telephone booth, “Alrighty, in we get.”
“Been out for hours....No no don’t give him….I Am Perfectly Calm!” It was Sirius’s yelling that broke through the hazy din of his half-awake state. His entire body was sticky with dried sweat and just as sore as when he flew his broom through a storm.
Harry nodded and rose from the stool he was sitting on, moving around the bar and into the kitchen, “I’m guessing that is why you’re so against hired help hmm? It reminds you of how you were raised.”
Harry opened and closed his mouth several times before sighing and shaking his head. “No...I’m sorry.” He tried to sit up again, succeeding this time, and looked at his godfathers. “So, do either of you have experience with veela inheritance?”
“If nothing is wrong then why do you two keep giving each other that look?” He almost demanded, attempting to sit up despite the soreness in his body.
How? He wanted to ask but before he realized it he was throwing off his duvet and leaping out of bed. Pain continued to wrack his body and he clenched his teeth hard. Who was his mate? How could he stop this pain and why the bloody hell did he feel like ripping someone’s throat out?
“I…” He stopped, staring at the letter. “I don’t know...I mean I want to try and be his friend, he seems like he needs someone who’ll knock some sense into him occasionally ya know? But I have no bloody clue what to tell him.” He set the letter down on the bar and stared at Draco’s owl that was still sitting on the counter. “Have you been instructed to wait for my response?” Another shriek and Harry groaned.
Harry stared at her for a long moment before letting out a great big sigh, “Let me guess they’re also slow to anger and weaker than dominants?”
“I’m sweaty, achey, and wishing this would hurry up, but sure I’m fine.” He managed to huff out, trying to stay calm through his growing frustration. What creature inheritance could
“You are not an anomaly Harry.” Sirius spoke firmly. “I was the first Grim inheritance in the Black family in nearly fifty years, does that make me an anomaly as well?” He raised an eyebrow at him
“The feud between Potters and Malfoys has been going on since before your fathers generation. All their talk of blood purity and the like made the Potters gag.” Sirius shook his head as he explained, “I mean compare that Draco boy’s magic to yours and see how much stronger yours is with you technically being a half-blood.” He turned to look at Harry over his shoulder, “Don’t let this weigh on you today of all days. Today is a happy day! A day for celebrating! Cheer up pup.”
“The letter is right here, I’ll go give it to her. Has she been to Malfoy's before?” Remus asked, holding up the letter from Sirius’s desk.
For the last week and a half all three of them had been tracing the Potter lines in an attempt to prepare for his inheritance but it didn’t seem to have been worth the time at the moment. His father had been a satyr and his mother a harpy so it was most likely he would get one of those but without his parents here he would never know how long their inheritances had been.
“Of course pup.” Sirius said softly as he rose from his bedside and left the room, his footsteps padding down the hall. He could only assume he was laying in his bed from the feel of the pillows behind him and the duvet laying over him. One of his godfathers must’ve carried him to bed after he had passed out.
His revelation over whom his mate could be struck him just as suddenly as the pain had only moments ago. “Potter...Potter is my mate.” His vamp practically purred as he said it. A sigh of relief escaped him as he climbed back into bed. His greatest obsession was his mate which meant that soon Potter would be his and his alone.
“Sorry to interrupt but the spell has just completed,” Edith, that was her name finally he remembered, “Your inheritance has been added to the book and your official diagnosis as a submissive, male veela has been recorded.” She had a bright and cheery smile, and Harry realised she probably had some type of phoenix inheritance.
Harry was still reading but once he had finished he let out an incredulous laugh. “It’s from Draco...He’s accepting my offer from the one and only letter I’ve sent him. Apparently the reason he didn’t reply back then is because his father had hidden the letter from him and he never knew it existed.” He let out another laugh, “I can’t believe this.”
“He wasn’t always a prat. He was nice in the robes shop before he knew who I was.” He sighed, leaning his head into his hand, “Then we get to Hogwarts and he insults Ron and I felt so defensive over my first real friend that it became this whole feud.” He frowned to himself, “When I look back into all the energy I’ve put into this whole petty thing it almost makes me want to laugh. It really does seem stupid.” He huffed and shook his head slightly.
“So tell me again why we have to register with the Ministry first? Couldn’t that be handled at Gringotts too?” Harry asked as he walked alongside Remus and Sirius down the busy streets of London to the Ministry’s service entrance. “I mean wouldn’t the goblins be better at this sort of thing?”
“Would you rather they play host to us?” Sirius remarked, snorting. “I can’t even begin to imagine the shade Lucius’s face would turn if he had blood traitors and a Potter traipsing around his home?” He continued to snicker, feeling Remus’s body shake with silent laughter. “Do you think it would turn the same shade of purple as that one mushroom from 5th year?”
He made his way out of the parlor and turned the corner, shocked to find his father standing there, a pinched and frustrated expression on his face. “Father? Is something wrong?”
“How do you know that?” Draco asked, shaking his head “I’ve been nothing but horrible to him how can you know he’ll respond well.”
“I got Harry a present, early today before Father had shown me the letter he kept from me. Do you think I should send it to him?” He was nervous all of a sudden, things were moving so quickly.
She flicked her wand through a series of motions and Harry felt a small prick in his thumb. He flinched back just slightly, the pain reminding him of his last school year with Umbridge, before he sent an apologetic look towards the woman. “Oh no worries dear I expected that. No need to look like that.” She waved him off before sliding a band aid across her desk to him, “Here you are. The diagnosis spell usually takes a few minutes, hope you don’t mind the wait.” The Potter Inheritance book on her desk opened as she spoke and she muttered a new spell at it.
Sirius stopped pacing suddenly and turned towards Remus, “I am Cissa’s favorite cousin and if I asked her for help throwing Harry a presentation party then she will help me.” He sounded so sure of that fact. “My letter contains no mention of Harry’s veela inheritance. Instead it is all about how I am absolutely incompetent with planning things and I want to make sure I do this one thing right for my godson and will the absolute best planner in the whole Black family please help me.” He even batted his eyelashes at Remus for extra effect.
They must’ve seen the worry on his face since they quickly began to assure him that nothing had gone wrong. “You’ve only been asleep for nine or so hours. I’m sure it’s the best sleep you’ve gotten in ages, pup, it’s just…” Sirius gave Remus another unsure look.
A short moment later they were walking quickly through the Department of Inherited Creatures in the Ministry, trying their hardest to avoid anyone and everyone. They were all in agreement that Harry’s inheritance did not need to be made public until the last possible moment, if at all.
It took practically all his strength to lift his arm and turn his head to look at his watch, counting down every second until finally, finally, it let out a long series of beeps announcing midnight. With one last look towards the mirror Harry passed out.
“But now isn’t the time for that.” Remus waved his hand around, as if clearing the air of the previous discussion. “You should get cleaned up as soon as you feel well so that we can celebrate your birthday.” That same scarred hand came and ruffled his ever messy hair, “Happy 16th pup.”
“Ok but you’ll let us know if you need anything, right cub?” Remus this time, softer in tone than Sirius but no less worried.
Narcissa sighed and shook her head at her son, “You worry too much Draco. I’m sure if he’s at the Ministry and living with his godfathers then nothing will go wrong.” She waved away a house elf as she talked, a smattering of color palettes sat on the table in front of her. She had grilled him on everything he knew about Harry and he had answered as best as he could without giving away his...stalkerish behavior towards the golden boy. That would not be a good thing for his mother to find about. “Have you checked to see if he’s sent a letter back yet? Perhaps that’ll be a good way for you to alleviate your worries.” Narcissa sent him a look and he stood to do so without question. He knew she was getting into one of her headspaces and that he should just leave her to it. She would make Harry’s presentation party spectacular and if anything tried to get in her way they would face her wrath. Draco shuddered to think of any poor soul that might attempt to.
“Ah Draco,” Draco frowned at the look that came to his father’s eyes, “Just who I was looking for. I need you to send a letter to Severus for me, it is of the utmost importance.” His father rummaged around in his robes before holding out a letter to him. “I assume you were already heading to the owlery?”
Sirius gave him a soft look, “Oh pup, you know you never have to worry about us relying on you for that sort of stuff, you’re supposed to rely on us. If it would make you feel more comfortable you can watch the bacon and I’ll finish up the French Toast” He gestured to the bacon that was cooking in a pan on the stove, “I’ll admit I’m not very good at multitasking and normally Remus helps out.”
“I don’t know why you’re trying pup, he’s only reaching out because of your fame- Remus don’t give me that look you know that it’s true. Associating with The Boy Who Lived would be good for the Malfoy reputation.” Sirius huffed as he began plating up their breakfast, “Now come sit both of you and eat, you’re far too skinny.” He added in a dramatic accent causing a few laughs to escape the both of them.
He let out a long breath, trying to control the bloodlust that was rising in him. “I don’t know who my mate is but this is similar to inheritance pains.” He spoke aloud hoping his words would appease his vamp. “Mate is just going through their inheritance which is good. It means we can begin courting soon.” It didn’t seem to be working so he continued to pace in his room. There wasn’t much he could do at the moment as he didn’t know what type of inheritance his mate was going through or even who his mate was.
“It’s almost midnight cub, just a little while longer and this will be over.” Remus spoke up again but all the response Harry could muster was a pained whimper. He could hear Sirius begin to speak up but couldn’t understand a word of what he said as the pain began to spread like fire all over his body.
“Sorry Mother...I’m just antsy. I felt the prick in my thumb so I know Harry’s at the Ministry right now and I want nothing more than to be there for him.” Draco explained, his voice soft and riddle with worry, “He’s lived with muggles his whole life, what if something goes wrong? What if the goblins are mean to him?”
“Well, cub, the creature you’ve inherited is a veela which while not exactly uncommon in the magic world it is slightly rarer in Britain,” Remus explained, “and it is rarer for males, especially male Potters, to gain this inheritance.” Remus waved his hands around as he explained, something he always did when he was nervous or unsure of himself.
Edith frowned, “That’s awful, I’ll have to send a letter to Dumbledore to fix that this year immediately. That is just not acceptable.” She continued to shake her head, already waving her wand around to begin writing the letter. “Thank you for your time gentlemen, have a lovely day.”
Harry nodded to her as he stood, grabbing his bag and slinging it across his shoulders, his godfathers moving to do the same. “Thank you for your time, Edith.” Sirius and Remus both thanked her before they left, ready to get to Gringotts.
“What if he doesn’t respond?” Draco was pacing again, he seemed to be doing that a lot today, “Or what if he responds poorly? Mother, I don’t think my vamp will handle rejection well.” He gave her a worried look, frowning when she simply sighed, “Mother this is no small matter!”
After Sirius had wished him the same they both left the room to give him some privacy. He was quick to change out of his, frankly disgusting, sleepwear and head towards the shower to wash off all of the grossness he had acquired through the inheritance process. His entire body was sticky with the dried sweat, and his hair was so matted with it he wondered how Remus could stand to have touched it. He could feel a slight pain in the back of his head and assumed he fell after he had passed out .
“Did you send the letter off to the Malfoys yet?” Harry asked, moving to sit at the breakfast bar, “If not I can have Hedwig do it, she hasn’t had much of a chance to spread her wings this summer.”
There was something about his father’s grin that just...didn’t sit right with Draco so he shook his head, “No I was actually heading to my potions room. I need to prepare the ingredients for a draught that can only be prepared in the coming moon cycle.” The lie slipped off his tongue easily, far too used to skirting around his father’s orders. “Perhaps Mother can deliver it for you, she’s in the parlor.” He didn’t wait for the reply, walking swiftly towards the stairs that would lead up to the potions cupboard. He could barely hide his curiosity at what creative punishment his mother would come up with for his father for daring to interrupt her.
Harry nodded slowly, “Yeah especially the House Elves. I think they should at least have a choice who they work for if they even want to work for someone in the first place.” He looked back at the bacon and shifted it around in the pan, “I’m not like Hermione and think that every House Elf should immediately be freed, some of them do like work after all.”
“One, do not shout at me.” Narcissa’s head turned slightly to look at her son over her shoulder, “Two, he will respond and he will respond well.”
“You’re not seriously going to write to Narcissa Malfoy for help are you?” Remus regarded his mate as he paced in the living room. “I mean I know she’s your cousin but do you honestly think that she’ll agree to it?”
“Thinking about how I can avoid Ron and Hermione’s PDA later today. I swear if I ever find my mate I will be the biggest cuddle bug just so Ron and Mione have to suffer like I did.” That got a chuckle out of both of his godfathers, and a knowing look from the Ministry Officer. He tries hard to remember her name but it keeps slipping away from him. “I’m….I’m also worried about how Draco will respond, knowing I want to talk to him in person. What if he thinks I just want to fight him or something? I mean he challenged me to a duel in our first year…” He didn’t quite understand why he was so put out by the thought of Draco not wanting to actually be his friend. By all means he should hate Draco for a lot of the trouble the other boy has caused him but he just….doesn’t for some reason. “I know it’s stupid to be worried, especially with all the horrible things he’s said and done but...his letter seemed genuine? I don’t know, I just don’t want to mess this up.”
“Don’t know. I guess I’m just so used to having to have breakfast ready for everyone and most of my chores started on by this time that it’s making me fidget .” He shrugged, “It’s weird not having to do everything for everyone all the time that I’m still not used to it.”
“Harry will be spending a lot of time in the manor to learn about his veela inheritance and to plan his presentation party. Which means you will be in charge of playing host to him while I handle the party and his godfathers.” Narcissa further explained, her lips pulled tight. “You will be able to get close to him during this time.”
They walked past office after office before eventually coming to the Ministry officer that had been recording Potter Creature Inheritances for generations. A thin woman with startling yellow eyes and pure white hair. She had feathers braided into her hair and a pair of wings that were clearly mid-molt spread out behind her. "Ah Mr. Potter and Co. I honestly expected you to be a little late." There was a knowing look in her eyes as she gestured to the seats in front of her desk. "This process shouldn't take very long at all. All I need is a drop of blood which will allow me the diagnosis spell which will add you to the Potter inheritance registry." Harry nodded quickly, taking the seat closest to her desk, his godfathers choosing the other two seats available, and held out his hand towards the woman.
And there stood Ronald Weasley, the boy who had betrayed Harry's trust."Where's Harry?" The ginger snarled, his eyes drawing away from the odd wolf. "Why on earth do you think I'd tell you?" Draco snarled, annoyed glints in his eyes. "It's none of your business!" Ron said, but knew that he was wrong.
Draco let go and Harry lay back down, exhausted and felt a hand take his and squeeze it gently. "What happened?" The nurse asked. "Harry woke up and I think something triggered his PTSD. He was saying the names of all the... Deceased people and sorry over and over again. A flashback. I think it may have been his head hurting because he was clutching his forehead and screaming," Draco answered.
"I love you all so much. I wish you didn't have to leave again," Harry sniffled, Sirius holding him tighter as if saying that he wasn't going anywhere. "We'll always be here when you ask for us Harry, we'll try as hard as we can," Remus said. "When your desperate and in need of help," Lily added. "And when your walking down the aisle." James smiled broadly.  Harry blushed but he knew they were talking the truth. "Just ask for us." Lily smiled and then, they were gone.
"Do what?" Hermione blushed. "Bite your lip and run your hands through your hair like that- you truly are a beautiful girl, Hermione." Ron smiled, ticking a loose strand of her hair behind her ear. "Oh!" She giggled. "Thank you."
"Uh, Harry. Dean and Seamus have had a secret relationship going on for months now. Only Neville and I know, you cannot tell anyone! They could get arrested! It's horrific." She whispered. Harry nodded his head curtly. "Uh, Hermione, why are we at the library? We have defence in ten minutes," Harry said. "Well, now that it's been brought up, I want to check the laws. Surely, there can't be a proper valid reason for not letting people love who they want to love. You've let out the monster in me Harry." She laughed.
"How dare you show your face here boy! And that- that abnormal stick of yours just lying on the table, out in the open? And holding hands with a boy!" Harry whimpered and Draco leaped up, preparing to drag the man off of Harry. "Should've known you would become a faggot! You're already fucked up enough as it is!" A smaller but still rather large boy snarled, joining his father and taking his place holding Harry up. "Get off of him!" Draco said, letting out an animalistic growl and attempting to grab at the boy.
Draco passed Harry his glasses and as soon as Harry put them on, he grabbed Draco's face and pulled him into a kiss. Although he hurt all over, Harry felt light and free. Draco pulled away and sat on the edge of Harry's bed. "Easy tiger," Draco smirked. "You can't go all 'hard ass' now, I heard every single thing you said to me whilst I was out," Harry grinned devishly. Draco blushed hard, but didn't break eye contact with Harry.

Harry had expected people to curse him, to shoot spells at him or scream in his face, but instead they all thanked him and attempted to shake his hand until he had no space left to breathe. "Please, a little space!" He managed to squeak out as his anxiety rose, but nobody heard him. "Excuse me," he said a little louder, trying to push through the crowd. "Please, let me through." He said a little louder and looked up, to see warm, mercury eyes catch his panicked emerald green ones.
Draco took Harry up to the Room of Requirements where they were meant to meet later anyway and lay him on the bed that sat in the corner. He had arrived in the Room of Requirements earlier, and was about to start his fort when his wrist throbbed where the heart was and he had rushed to Harry.
Harry, stress overcoming him, shoved spoonfuls of eggs into his mouth, so much he almost looked like Ronald. "Oh Harry, I'm so proud of you!" Hermione squealed. Harry looked up at her then spat the eggs back onto his plate.
"Padfoot is alive!" Harry shouted excitedly into Hermione's face. Draco turned towards Harry, smirking at his excited face and then without warning, the doors burst open and no man other than Sirius Black entered the room.
Draco leapt off from his seat and punched Ron right around the jaw. "Get your filthy faggot hands off me!" He growled. "RONALD!" Ginny screeched as she jumped up. "Get out of the way Ginevra, why are you protecting him, he cheated on you!" Ron and Ginny argued, before Ron pushed Ginny to the floor and stalked up to Harry's bed.
Harry stayed sat on the bed, and touched his lips as they were still tingling. "Holy shit." Harry said to himself as he adjusted his glasses. For the time that he and Draco were together, Harry finally felt some shred of happiness somewhere inside him.
Ginny ran out of the common room and everyone stared at Draco. "What? Now she won't be the only sober one!" He said. "That," Harry slurred. "Is my boyfriend! He's the most kindest most amazingest person in the world!"
Hermione and Ron kept on pestering Harry to eat more, and Harry just got more annoyed. He wanted to snap at them, tell them to mind their own business, but he just didn't say a word. Finally, Harry had had enough and just stormed out of the great hall. He headed for the North East tower. There was a painting of a middle aged woman sat at a table, a page of parchment in her hand.
Before Draco could even turn around, a huge, beefy man had stormed over and grabbed the back of Harry's collar, yanking him up and making his head bang on the back of the table. He was promptly shoved against the wall as the man spat in his face.
"We gather here today to question Sirius Black in his role of the mass murder of thirteen humans, muggles and wizards alike! My first question to you, is how did you escape Azkaban?" Fudge snarled, his cruel eyes narrowing on Sirius. "I'm an animagus. As you all must know by now my dear friend Remus Lupin is- was- a werewolf, and so James, Peter Pettigrew and I became animagi to make the full moon a little more bareable by being there with him. When I was in my animagus form, a dog, the dementors couldn't sense I was there, so they opened my cell door and I snuck out and left that horrid place," Sirius nodded truthfully.
The photograph was of the kiss, but Draco's back was turned to the camera, only Harry's face was seen. "Well at least it doesn't show your face." Harry nodded. A letter fell in front of him and started to speak just like a couple of weeks ago.
"You are such a Hufflepuff." Harry chuckled. "How dare you! I am nothing of the sort, I am Slytherin and proud. Much rather be a Slytherin than a Gryffindork anyway," he smiled and Harry fake scoffed. "How dare you, I am completely and utterly offended!" He said, placing a hand of his heart dramatically.
"So it is you two!" George grinned. "Yep! And for the record, Harry, this boy likes you very much too," Draco smiled. "Just, promise me Harry. If you ever get thoughts like that again, owl me. I can't be losing you too." George smiled and the door opened and the other Weasley's along with Hermione and Ginny came in.
Harry completed his dare, leaving not just one but a long trail of hickeys down Malfoy's neck, leaving the pale blonde, grey eyed boy flabbergasted. The two of them sat down on Harry's bed, leaning against the pillows with Harry's head sitting on Draco's shoulder. "I want to feel like this all the time, Draco. Just happy and not having to worry every moment of every day. And I want to be with you, always." Harry whispered.
"I know that Ronald. I spoke to her too, she knew about it all along. She was completely fine with it, she never really liked Harry like that in the first place she just thought that it would make you happy!" Once again, Ron groaned at his stupidity.
Harry looked over at Draco who was sitting two seats down from Ron, and saw that Malfoy had been staring right back at him too. They both quickly looked away, blushing, only to take one final glance at each other again. Then, Harry got an idea.
"Who are you taking to the party Harry?" Hermione asked. "We have to take dates? Ugh, this is just a repeat of fourth year." Harry laughed. "Maybe you could take Draco!" Hermione giggled, winking at Harry. "Hermione!" Harry growled, joining in with the laughter.
"Draco what are you doing?" Harry gasped at the sudden force on the back of his neck. Repeat after me. You are filthy scum and I want nothing to do with you!  "You are filthy scum and I want nothing to do with you," Draco repeated, Pansy's own disgust at the relationship edging into his voice. "W-what?" Harry choked, eyes widening at the sudden confession. "I hate you, I always have. I just wanted to make a fool out of you, and it worked. I'm in love with Pansy, I always have been! You are just some disgusting piece of food on the side of my plate and I decided to play with you before finally chucking you to the dogs." Draco repeated carefully, unable to control himself despite the voice banging pleadingly in the back of his mind.
Harry gulped at the mention of the sectumsempra curse, but carried on listening to the argument none the less.
"Well if it isn't the happy couple," a voice sneered from the other side of the tree. Harry and Draco jumped apart and looked up. "You just love to hide behind trees and spy on your students, don't you Barton?" Harry snarled.
Harry opened his eyes to see Draco's wand on the floor and the boy himself looking... Relieved? "What just happened?" Harry asked.
"What do you want boy, why have you brought me to Sirius Black's house, of all people?" Mrs Dursley said, eyeing the dirty room in despise. Instead of answering the question left hanging in the dusty air, Harry just muttered something inaudible under his breath. "I need to see you, Mum."
"That isn't soon enough," Harry grumbled, but let himself be pulled into a hug by his soulmate nonetheless. "Just until tomorrow." Draco smiled. "Tomorrow." Harry nodded and watched as Draco walked away towards his mother and then apparated away. "Damn you have it bad! I don't think I ever even saw James look at Lily that way and they were in l.o.v.e, love!" Sirius laughed.
“You will be my prize, my pet.” Voldemort smiled as he looked Harry over, feeling the pure power radiating from the Dark creature before him. “And you will reign destruction upon our enemies, those who dare go against us.”
“Your friends are visiting today, remember?” Draco said after he realized there’d been a long silence when he’s been stuck in his head, and Harry was watching him expectantly, dark eyes touched with concern.
Voldemort smiled, drawing the vial of potion from his pocket and studying it for a few moments before he called a house elf. “Bring me Potter.” The house elf nodded, disappearing with a crack.
Harry groaned as he opened his eyes, being wrenched out of his magnificent dream by a mass of red hair and freckles landing on his bed. "Ugh, Ron! Ge'off me!" he grumbled, trying to push his friend off.
“Just lay back and enjoy it.” Harry smirked, shifting so that he was hovering over Liam. He nuzzled his neck, inhaling the other male’s scent with a small noise of discontent. The smell was all wrong, nothing like the scent of his mate, but the need was still there, driving him to follow his instincts. Gently Harry flicked his tongue over the pulse point that called to him before he sunk his teeth in. The burst of crimson against his tongue was dull, flavorless. It was all so very wrong. This blood would keep him alive, yes, but it wouldn’t give him pleasure. It wasn’t meant for him. But Harry continued drinking, well aware that he had to survive.
Harry hummed happily at the Gryffindor table, thoroughly enjoying his chocolate chip waffle. He looked up just in time to see an absolutely lovely Draco Malfoy stroll into the Great Hall. A few moments later he almost gasped as Natalie, a second year Hufflepuff, barreled right into him, spilling her glass of pumpkin juice all over his robes.
Chewing on his lower lip, Ron studied the pendant for a few moments. There were two snakes depicted on it in raised metal: one silver, the other gold. They were entwined; heads rearing back as they faced each other. The pendant itself seemed to be made entirely from emerald, the snakes set perfectly into the stone. Ron could easily guess whom Harry had received it from. His friend clearly couldn’t remember where he got it from or Ron was certain he wouldn’t be wearing it still.
Sniffling, Draco let out a wet chuckle. “I bet. Any new developments I should know about?” he asked, the realization of just how distanced he’d been since Harry was turned finally hitting him. For those few months it had been just the two of them: him and Harry. He hadn’t realized just how much he missed his friends, spending time with them, just getting to…talk.
"Oh fuck, not you!" A voice Harry recognized came from under him. He looked down to see he had landed on top of one Draco Malfoy...and they were now in a rather compromising position. Quickly Harry scrambled off the Slytherin, willing away the rather erotic fantasies that came to mind when his gaze caught the blonde boy looking rather disheveled.
Harry chuckled softly. “It won’t hurt, Draco. And even if it did, you would love the pain. You would yearn for it.” He sat up and the covers fell slightly, exposing his chest. It was only then that Draco realized that under the blankets Harry was completely naked.
"Um, no one! Myself!" Draco exclaimed quickly, really hoping Harry hadn't heard anything of any importance.
“No.” Harry shook his head. “I’ll hurt you. You need to rest, replenish your blood.” He explained softly. “I’ll drink more later.”
“Our bond is more than just blood.” Harry murmured quietly, making Draco flinch slightly as he reached out to gently brush away the droplets of tears. “You are my mate, Draco, my reason for life itself. I need you like I need air. You’re a part of me.” He said quietly, eyes downcast as he kept his gaze away from Draco’s. “And if…if you’d rather have Blaise, I…I will allow it.” He whispered, tone almost broken at the very thought of losing Draco. “I will not make you stay with me against your will.”
The Slytherin chewed nervously on his lip and also looked up. "Might as well try that first..." he murmured. Harry didn't need telling twice and in a second Draco found himself with an armful of Gryffindor who seemed quite intent in licking his tonsils.

Quickly Harry nodded, nuzzling Draco’s wrist gently and inhaling deeply before he finally sank his teeth into the soft heel of Draco’s hand. A soft moan slipped out from Harry as the taste of Draco’s blood splashed over his tongue. Normally it would have made Draco shudder, hearing that sound from between the plump red lips of his greatest enemy, if it weren’t for the utter bliss racing through his body at that moment in time. His heartbeat was racing, pumping hard and fast as though it meant to rip from his chest just so it could get to Harry’s lips faster. Draco almost forgot to drink his hot chocolate; so distracting was the feeling of Harry’s teeth sunk deep into his skin, sucking the liquid of Draco’s life. Then Harry stopped and Draco barely managed to keep a pitiful whimper form leaving him.
A smug look crossed Draco’s lips at Harry’s reaction and he tossed the Vampire a shirt. “Good boy. Now get dressed. You’ll feed and then we can go.”
Draco opened his eyes (when had they closed?) and looked up into the dark eyes studying him. “Done already?”
"Sevi-Kins." Snape muttered in disguised. "I'll get that pompous little bimbo for that one." he scowled to himself as he trudged to the dungeons. Everything was WAY to pink and frilly for his liking today. And Lucius had even gotten him to wash his hair, making the day even more perfectly horrible.
Harry nodded, promptly doing as Draco requested. Within minutes the house elf had reappeared, set a tray of food in front of Draco, and the blonde had dug in. There were several long minutes filled with the sound of Draco hungrily eating until finally Harry spoke, his voice hesitant. “You…I would like… you don’t have to keep the door locked.” He murmured haltingly. “I wouldn’t leave your chambers.”
"You know me too well." Draco said with a sigh. "So what'd you get for Pansy anyways?" he asked with a snort.
At that Blaise looked awkwardly down at the floor, avoiding Draco’s eyes as he rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. “Umm…I…” he trailed off, cheeks tinting pink.
Harry chuckled, the sound low and guttural in his throat. He gently coaxed Draco to turn around without a word, gripping both of their cocks in one hand to stroke them together. Shuddering a bit at the sensation, Harry let out a soft whimper, his hips rocking as his hand twisted and pumped. “Draco…” the vampire breathed, voice heavy and deep with arousal.
"I'm taking this one." Harry said firmly, unstopping the vial and drinking it in one gulp. He shuddered slightly and Ron watched him in horror.
The train ride back to King’s Cross Station had been largely uneventful for Draco. Blaise, along with the surprising Seamus Finnegan, had kept him pleasantly distracted for the trip with their antics and public displays of affection.
Gritting his teeth, Draco nodded reluctantly, biting back a snarky retort before opening the door and slipping inside.
Harry woke up on December the 25th feeling happier than ever. He was alive, it was his sixth year at Hogwarts, and he had the hottest blonde bloke in the school as his boyfriend. Oh wait...that was just dream.
Draco couldn’t even feel the place where Harry’s teeth pierced him, all he could feel was his blood racing hot and thick to that point, his heart beating faster and faster with every gulp of blood that Harry drank. The Vampire pulled away just as Draco started getting dizzy, gently lapping at the wound, red and bloody against Draco’s pale skin.
Harry arched an eyebrow and smirked, stopping just outside the mistletoe. "Is that so? You seem to be having some trouble there, Malfoy." he smirked.
"Looks like your potions weren't good after all." he laughed. "Looks like you're going to need a better mating call." Harry groaned as he realized he rhymed again. "SHIT!"
Despite knowing that eventually Harry would get better, the realization that it had actually happened still hit Draco like a hippogriff. He felt empty and cold inside, and it took all of his legendary Malfoy control to stop a sab from escaping his lips.
Harry nodded, knowing exactly what Draco was asking for, even if the other man himself wasn’t quite sure. He sat back, vanishing his clothes with a flick of his wand and summoning over a vial of lube. He prepared Draco slowly, gently, with more care then he usually used with his prey. Draco was different; Harry could feel it. The Vampire within him wanted Draco, but it was more than just a want. It was a need that filled and consumed him, but not the usual need to feed and destroy. It was the need to claim, to make Draco belong to him for all eternity.
“You know I’ll never hurt you, right?” Harry’s voice murmured in his ear. “I adore you, Draco. Even if you never come to like me, I’ll adore you until the day I die.”
Pansy arched a doubtful eyebrow and decided that an evil smile didn't count as a real smile since it was evil. "And how on earth did you manage that?" she asked.
“Bring him to me.” The voice slithered out of the darkness, wrapping around the Death Eaters and making all but the most battle hardened shudder in fear. “Bring me my monster.”
Underneath the vampire Draco shivered, looking up at him with wide eyes. “P-Potter?” he asked breathily, hardly able to believe that he was in this position with the object of his lust for so long.
A soft snort escaped Draco’s lips as he heard Harry say that. “I don’t really have a choice in that matter, Potter.” He said before he paused, his voice softening a bit. “And it wasn’t all terrible yesterday.”
After a while of blissful tongue entwining interspersed with low moans Draco finally pulled away. Both he and Harry were panting slightly and the Gryffindor's cheeks were flushed beautifully. "Good day, Potter." Draco smirked and turned to leave. He took a step and hit an invisible wall, swearing loudly. With a snarl he rounded back to Harry. "What now?"
Slowly Harry nodded, able to feel the creatures’ power flowing through his veins. “Thank you.” He murmured softly. “Your son is safe with me, I promise.”
"Hey Malfoy!" Draco jumped as a sickeningly familiar voice rang through the hall. He spun around to see none other than Harry Potter positively swaggering towards him. "Who you talking to?" The Golden Boy asked as he got closer.
work, however, Harry would still have to take a potion for the rest of his life. And, above all, Harry’s recovery would depend on Draco’s blood. Which is exactly why Draco found himself shifting nervously in front of the thick wooden door, wishing that he could be anywhere besides that spot.
“That necklace.” Ron nodded to the pendant that Harry’s fingers were still gently caressing, as if without conscious thought. “Where’d you get it?”
All too soon Harry was laving his tongue over the marks he’d made, once again sealing them instantly. By this time Draco was fully hard and aching, pressing back against Harry in a silent plea as the Vampire pulled back slightly.
Blaise rolled his eyes with a huff, sitting up. “Well there’s no use dwelling on it. And since I can’t make you feel better with a rousing round of shagging, we’ll just have to do the next best thing.” He grinned, summoning a bottle of Firewhisky he kept stashed in the boy’s dorm. He offered it to Draco, who took the bottle gladly.
“Since when have I been a vampire?” Harry finished for him, a gleam in his eyes as he looked down at Draco and licked his lips. “Mmm, almost a year now, I think. It’s strange, isn’t it? I’ve spent so long defending myself from Dark Wizards and yet I got attacked by a vampire while on vacation in Romania. Funny how life works out like that.” He hummed, flashing his fangs as he smiled down at the prone body beneath him. “It’s not that bad, really. I get to seduce young men and take them into my bed. I can hardly complain.” His head dipped again, nuzzling along Draco’s collarbone. “There are even potions that allow me out in the sun, can you imagine?”
Draco was picking tiredly at his plate of eggs when commotion erupted across the hall by the Gryffindor table. Harry Potter had fallen out of the bench and fallen onto the floor; tremors wracked his body as he writhed and screamed in pain. Draco noticed how Potter seemed to be trying to crawl away from the morning sunlight spilling through the Great Hall windows and smirked. That was the sign of the Vampire infection taking ahold of Harry’s cells and mutating them.
“When Harry turned in the Great Hall his eyes locked onto you, Mr. Malfoy. There is no doubt in any of the professors’ minds that had we not Stunned Mr. Potter when we did, he would have attacked you, Draco, and drank your blood.” Dumbledore explained simply.
"Maybe you just shouldn't take any of them." Ron said uncertainly before gasping. "There's more writing on the back!"
A small smile flickered into place on Draco’s lips and he nodded. “Thank you, Granger.” He nodded, shaking her hand. “Have a nice afternoon.” He bid them goodbye before he started walking away.
Harry smiled at Neville as he added some more ingredients to their bubbling concoction. "I don't know, it didn't say." he replied.
“Yes,” Harry hissed with a curling smirk, his fingernails lengthening so they could cut through Draco’s shirt with ease. “I’m afraid Harry’s gone now, Draco,” he cooed. “But he’ll come back after I’m finished. He’ll be so distraught once he sees what I’ve done. He really does adore you.”
Unfortunately, though, Draco was unable to fully enjoy the kiss for moments after he had started sucking lightly on Harry Potter's wonderful tongue he was roughly shoved away. Stunned, the Slytherin for a moment thought that Harry had not been enjoying the kiss as much as he had, but then he looked up to see a group of students coming around the corner and into their previously deserted corridor.
After taking in the above information it is probably pointless to say what wonderful day in the Wizarding World it was, since I'm sure that you are all very intelligent beings. However, I'm going to tell you anyways just because I want to. It was Valentine's Day. Now you know.
His things were moved into a larger living space, complete with his own bathroom and lounge. The only part of this whole arrangement that he hated, apart from the fact that he’d been blackmailed into it, was the door set in the wall across from Draco’s bedroom. The door Draco now glared at, as if he could make it disappear with sheer willpower and anger.
