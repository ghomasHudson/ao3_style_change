Automatically Harry’s hand reached for the glowing ink, slowly and carefully touching it with his fingerprints. He was surprised it was not hotness he felt but only tender skin and a heart beating so fast, he could almost see it through the skin.
They had never been somewhere where they stayed the night together. Of course, from time to time – let’s be honest: almost every day! – one of them was sleeping over at the other’s place but this somehow feels a little bit different. And he is looking forward to it.
“’Toria, what do you want from me? May I assume that there is any other reason you do not even let me spend a few single, wholesome hours a day without your constant babbling than to drive me crazy?”
After what felt like ages in which he mentally kicked himself for being so insanely stupid, the other man finally reacted once again. Dragging his chair closer to the table and sitting upright Malfoy changed his posture from arrogance into what seemed to be real interest.
“How did you get this table?” he managed to scream against the loud, leaning towards the other guy once again. Draco’s answer was a smug smile and he gestured Harry to come closer, so he could whisper or should I better say shout into his ear:
Daphne was the last one to join them and she only did so after they heard the doorbell ring. Grunting, Draco got up again and managed to somehow get the door. Finally, food. Having a ton of cheesy stuff in his stomach helped Harry to think clearly once again. Obviously, it had been Draco who brought him here, put the glass, the potion and his glasses on the table and had his phone plugged in. That was a lot of nice gestures. Was that a common thing Draco did for all of the guys he met in clubs?
He had to grin again. Of course, Draco would imply there had to be more presents to come in the future.
He never felt uncomfortable with her. But he also never felt uncomfortable without her. When she was gone, he sure was wondering what she was up to but it was never her he missed, it was solemnly the company.
”, Draco mumbled to himself, following Harry’s gaze with his eyes, “I will face my fears. A promise to never again let someone else determine what I want to do with my life and who I have to be.”
He luckily lost that thought a moment later when two witches crossed their path, greeting Draco by calling him his first name and politely addressing himself as “Mr. Potter” before moving on. Draco once again gave him his characteristic one-sided smile.
She had always been the voice of the relationship. Because she understood how to handle situations. How to handle Harry. She just knew him better than he did himself. Maybe that was the reason she knew just when to end things with him.
Harry could do nothing else but grin at him. It was adorable seeing Draco being embarrassed and for once not having everything under control. This, he decided, was a side of the other man he liked even more than the polished, perfect version.
After the movie had ended, they looked at each other in confusion and did not really know how to continue. Harry felt as if the distance between them had grown into a giant void which he was not capable of overcoming. The other man seemed so far away as in another version of this reality; one Harry could not enter.
This house had not been a place for laughter and bantering for a very long time. Only when Teddy swung by (because somehow the little boy loved spending time in this house – maybe it was the black blood which kept drawing him towards strange and gloomy places) it seemed to fill with life for a tiny bit.
That night Harry had a nightmare for the first time in a very long time. He woke up with an aching in his heart he could not explain as the left-over dream pictures started to fade away the minute he awoke. The only thing left was the feeling of missing somebody essential to his life. He vaguely remembered he was dreaming quite a normal dream but seemed to be searching for something, someone. But he could not figure out who it was and the longing for a person that did not exist in his dream reality hurt him so much, he consciously decided to break out of it.
“Well, as far as I know your experience with men only goes as far as kissing a random bloke and snogging me to get rid of another one. Therefore, I assume you are experimenting in a safe space right now. You were also kissing Astoria so who should know. In addition, you were a bit intoxicated in those situations. Alcohol makes us do things our sober mind would protect us from.”
“You will know it when you meet someone you are attracted to. It is as simple as that. Do not overthink it. I always thought you Gryffindorks were great at trusting their guts, Potter!”
Unfortunately, not even Hermione Granger was able to stop the mechanisms of press from working and therefore Harry the Boy Who Was Totally Ashamed Of his Gullibility was delivered the Daily Prophet with his own picture on the front page once again. Next to the snapshot of him looking somewhere thoughtlessly the awful headline screamed for attention. “Salvation for Those Who Do Not Deserve It”. His first instinct was to tear the newspaper into tiny shreds before even reading it but if his past with the press had taught him one thing it was: Know your enemy. So, with a deep breath praying for patience he started reading.
Returning back home to Grimaulde Place made him realize how much he grew to hating Sundays by himself. He so much had gotten used to hanging around with his new friends that now the idea of being on his own on a day he had nothing to do quite scared him. So, after a warm shower he decided to text Astoria and ask her to send him the pictures of the night before. He knew her well enough to know such a request would automatically lead to longer texting. Also, he needed to know if it was ok for her to show Teddy a picture of her outfit.
Nothing on that piece of carton pointed towards Draco being connected to healing or anything but indeed it explained a lot about why the other man might struggle finding clients. A lot of the old wizarding families had kept their heirlooms through and after the war, secretly storing them in mansions on the countryside. Not all of them used to be connected to Voldemort, not all were Death Eaters, some just had a fable for old magic things. He would know, his department had to investigate in those cases from time to time.
The piercing in the bottom lip was located rather on the outer half and currently the tattooed man was chewing on it, clearly expecting some sort of reaction. ‘His hair colour makes his grey eyes stand out more’, Harry thought to himself while still staring at the other guy. Somehow the lack of controlled style suited Draco more than the slick back hair our beloved Gryffindor was used to. The messy bun managed to soften the sharp and pointy features a bit, giving the former Slytherin more of an edgy but approachable vibe.
He let his elbows rest on the kitchen counter behind him, looking at her provocatively. He very well knew with mentioning family he hit a nerve. On one or two occasions Andromeda had already turned a bit sentimental and admitted missing her one remaining sister.
Harry vaguely remembered that the awful article had mentioned Draco’s profession, calling him something like a healing consultant. Why would anybody refuse to work with him? He mindlessly searched through his kitchen cupboards, a mannerism he had picked up somewhat two years ago.
After a few initial difficulties to get their conversation going (which Astoria was not the reason for, just to let you know) they were engaged in a vivid chat about how annoying ball season at the Minister was and how much they hated the gross food people there considered fancy. So, no wonder, they did not hear the key turning in the lock nor notice the noises made by someone getting rid of their shoes and coat. Only when a familiar voice from the hall shouted, they stopped talking.
Maybe, his erection already painfully pressing against his own jeans whispered into his mind, this was a game he could play as well.
“Well Potter,” he slowly and very quietly said, “if you really want to talk about this subject, we should meet at a less public place.” Out of the inner pocket of his jacket he pulled a business card and a pen that could only be described as decadent. Dark mahogany wood together with what looked like actual marble held a thin fountain-pen nib made out of platinum. The ink of course had a deep green colour. He took his very time to note down an address. Harry immediately noticed that the capital letters were written obnoxiously large and contained more than one unnecessary extra swirl.
"Yes, well, that was basically the only thing holding me back: doubt. Even after the battle, … even when I was accepted into the Auror Academy … I never considered myself good enough."
Taking a deep breath, Harry opened the door and took in the despondent form of George Weasley. Leaning against the frame, the redhead looked at the smaller wizard, seemingly oblivious to the rain that had him soaked to the bones. Judging from the anguished in George's eyes, Harry could even believe that to be true.
"Did you notice anything out of the ordinary, last night?" Harry inquired. "Any commotion or intrusion?"
"This is how I expect to see you every morning. Once your appearance is flawless, we can work on your behavior." Rising, she ruffled his hair on the way out, commenting, "Oh, and clean up your room. This … post-apocalyptic chic is very off-putting. Have a good day, my little gem."
Spooning up his tasteless porridge, trying very hard not to envy Hermione's steak and potato-meal, Lucius inquired, "Don't take this the wrong way, but I have never pegged you for someone who values creature comforts. Especially not in situations like this."
Sliding down into a lying position, Harry accioed another blanket from the wardrobe and settled in for the night. He doubted that this would remain the only incident to disturb his slumber in the upcoming weeks.
"Were you?" His own son challenged. "Do you even know how to be friends with someone without personal gain? After all, you only made him my godfather, because you wanted to bind him to our family. Greg and Goyle were my friends since childhood. But without a doubt, even they associated with my because their parents told them to and expected something in return."
Stepping up to the bed, Harry studied the comatose patient for a while, before sharing quietly, "I'll try to come back tomorrow, and you can help me plan the lab. We have to be careful, however, not to draw too much attention. If the press notices me equipping a potions lab at Grimmauld Place, while still working full-time, they will have Draco cooking up poisons, love potions and what-not in a day. The rumours of what he is doing in my house are preposterous enough as it is.
With a deep sigh, the older Auror massaged the bridge of his nose, mumbling, “I hate you so much right now, Potter.”
Having finished his inspection, the wizard in the painting had then studied the witch and the two wizards by her side who had stood huddled together. "Did we have even more children?" He had asked with a grin.
With a soft sigh, Harry looked up at her. "I wish you had been there. I mean … the only memory of you I actually have is you screaming when Voldemort tried to kill you; from the graveyard and finally the Forbidden Forrest. You were …" the young man was searching for words, as his parents clutched each other's hands, looking at him with so much love and heartbreak that it brought tears to his eyes once again. "At the graveyard, something called Prior Incantatem happened. Images of all the people Voldemort had killed appeared. You were distracting him, somehow trapping him in a cage of spectres, so I could escape. It was only for a few seconds, but it was enough. And in the Forrest, I used the Resurrection Stone. I was so scared, but Sirius assured me that I did not have to be. That dying was easier than falling asleep. You were there … your souls, I mean and … I don't think I could have gone on without you. Seeing you there. Knowing that death was not the end. That I would somehow, someway see you again, gave me enough courage to take the Killing Curse. And after Dumbledore … I mean Death, I wanted to give life a chance. Without an insane megalomaniac behind me. Without the Dursleys …"
Exchanging a look with his partner, Neville iterated, "Leewood, Pince, the Lady Malfoy … and Boleyn."
"Nobody expects you to like it, Harry," Neville eased his friend. "But at least he's moderately safe, right now. Let this be a comfort and let's go home. I don't see what we can do right now. Lucius and Hermione are safe, and we could all do with a full night's sleep."
The raven-haired, however, gave a quiet chuckle, lovingly caressing the Cornerstone, cutting himself on a sharp tooth of the snake-relief that had reared up around it. Uncaring, Harry smeared the blood over the wall, gazing at the other. "Of course, we are maliciousss, we are fighting foreign magic. Magic that doesss not belong."
Laughing, the muggle-born witch caressed her daughter's head and confirmed. "That they do. Now, do you want to help us prepare the feast?"
Severus was the first to nod off. Despite his state of recovery, the day had still been draining for him. Once Harry and Draco noticed, they finished their drinks, before levitating their former professor up to his room, changing him magically before tucking him in. It was a testament to the trust Severus Prince née Snape put into them, that he did not wake once.
Leaving the blanket alone reluctantly, Harry instructed Lucius, "Hermione made a first draft. Kingsley has looked over it already. We know what we want. We are just not sure of how to achieve it."
"That remains to be seen," the Head Auror pondered. "The sympathy of the public is a fickle thing. You know that better than most, Harry. You have been in favour for quite a long time now. People might start to look for flaws, be they real or imaginary."
Dutifully, and secretly grateful, the Malfoys rose and bade him good night, before retreating upstairs.
Patiently Severus waited until his godson had eaten and had had two cups of tea. As the boy started his third, he sighed. "Now, would you please explain to me what you were talking about, earlier?"
He seemed pleased that his client was finally learning to work their system. In the past, Harry Potter had always seemed too … Gryffindor for his own good. This Slytherin-mindset was doing his client good.
"Shower. Hair. Make-up," she ordered while claiming his chair, helping herself to a cup of tea. " I expect crisp lines today. You have thirty minutes."
His mother had merely smiled at him comfortingly and told him to take care of their patient. Not that Draco had had different intentions. All male Malfoys were bound to Potter by oath and his mother by proxy. But if the topic of blood purity ever came up, what stance was Draco supposed to take? Should he tell the truth or lie to remain in Potter's good graces? In the end, they could not afford to alienate the man. Too much was at stake.
Hugging his friend, Harry drew strength from the silent power the taller wizard extruded. After a few moments, he had composed himself. "After I've talked to Draco, we'll start an official file for this investigation. Do you want to join me?"
"And had he gone after Longbottom; I would not have cared. I think that says more about my character than my willingness to die for Lily's son. I am not a good person, Lucius. Nor am I the hero Potter tried to make me. Yet he makes me wanting to be better just by being around. I am selfish enough to accept that."
"Forgive the question, Mr Weasley," Narcissa stepped up to him. "But how can my son choosing an unmanageable pet be a good thing?"
Dinner that evening had Harry and Draco in high spirits. And though Snape insisted on eating alone … or more, alone, with but Emilia since he had not yet the fine motor control to care for his own meals, the raven-haired had insisted that Kreacher made his favourite. When inspecting the dinner preparations, he had not been able to keep in his amusement to himself. "Seriously? Snape's favourite is Sunday Roast with Yorkshire Pudding?"
Just in time, Manson had pulled out his own wand and spelled open all windows. A sickening black-green-grey cloud lifted from every available surface. With a mere gesture, the librarian of the Manchester University conjured a breeze that carried the poisonous residue out into the grounds, where the wind dispensed it.
When she didn't add anything, Harry forced himself to reveal the full extent of power he now held over the male members of her family. "As for Draco, he … he swore servitude to me, and I kind of accepted his offer. He'll stay with me from now on, help me with Grimmauld Place and S… and everything else I could use a hand with."
"Coq au vin, with Pomme de Terre. Honestly, it's not that hard to remember." Turning towards the wizard he had bound himself to, Draco offered a small and grateful smile as he insulted, "Plebeian."
"But that's a good thing!" Hermione spoke up excited. "Don't you want that for her? A life without servitude."
It was hard not to fidget, especially knowing how spectacularly he had failed this young man. But Lucius had been brought up to keep up appearances at all cost. So, he steeled himself and looked up. The emotionless emerald-green orbs that met his nearly made him shiver. Still, he could not help but flinch when Harry asked coldly, "Have you come to make sure that I do not have Draco locked up in my dungeons during the day?"
Closing his eyes, Severus thought back to the boys' time at Hogwarts. Of course, Harry had not known that Severus had been ready to protect him at any time. But Draco had! And every single time that stupid child had turned his back on him, it had felt like a slap to the face.
“They’re bound to be worse at first though,” Hermione said warningly. “But it’ll be worth it in the end.”
“Like you didn’t know this would happen,” Draco said with a snort. “This was probably your plan all along!”
“Don’t you take anything for them?” Draco asked softly. His animosity towards Harry had dissipated since last night. He felt like he and Harry may be kindred spirits when it came to nightmares.
“And you didn’t deserve what I said to you either,” Harry said softly. “‘M sorry. Maybe the others are right… maybe we should try and get along now that everything is over.”
They managed to make it through their respective hygiene routines with only one brief separation — after twenty minutes of watching Draco style his hair, Harry’d had enough and walked off. Draco had yelped, grabbed Harry’s wrist, and pouted the entire way to the common room.
“You… you woke me up screaming,” Draco replied with a sigh. “You didn’t mention that you had nightmares.”
Draco processed this silently for a few seconds. “You’re not the only one who has nightmares, you know.”
With that, they left the classroom and made their way back to the eighth-year common room. The school day was surely over by now and Pansy and Hermione would no doubt be wondering where they were.
“Sometimes potions are easier,” Draco said, moving his hand slightly on Harry’s chest, making the other boy shiver. “Sorry.”
“Boys. Obviously,” Draco said, looking thoughtful. “Dark hair… I used to find Wood quite attractive actually. I think that’s how I first realised I was gay.”
to just leave the mug in the sink without washing it?” Draco demanded, gesticulating wildly with his arms.
“Not clever enough in my father’s eyes. Granger saw to that. I know she didn’t mean to, but Father wouldn’t let it drop. And don’t get me started on the whole Malfoy heir debacle.”
Harry always apologised, but the damage was done. Pansy and Hermione spent the majority of their free time huddled together having whispered discussions about how they could teach the pair a lesson.
“Of course. Of freaking course. The saviour of the magical world is too good for a common dormitory like the rest of us, what was I thinking? Tell me, Potter, do you ever feel guilty that your friends almost died for you and yet it’s always you that gets all the glory?” Draco spit the words like so many hexes, chin raised, fingernails digging into Harry’s wrist.
Hermione stood and gestured at the chalk. “I won’t get too technical, but the circle has trapped you both—and your magic—and the runes are casting the spell. The original spell involved some intense magical bonding, but we modified it so that it will only require you to stay in close proximity at all times.”
Even sitting at opposite sides of the room they managed to argue. Occasionally, there would be balled up pieces of parchment launched across the room. More often than not, these pieces of parchment failed to reach their target and Pansy, in particular, had been hit in the head.
“Believe me, I know,” Harry said. “But Ron’s told me how bad mine are. I… I see a Mind Healer but it’s not a quick fix.”
“I’m sorry too,” Harry said softly. “I’m sorry you had to put up with him in the Manor. I always thought you must have everything. But when the Snatchers brought us to the Manor… it was nothing like I’d imagined,” he broke off with a sigh. “I suppose that was because of him?”
Pansy nodded. “Thank you. Now, I doubt either of you noticed, given your preoccupation with hitting each other, but you’ll find you’re standing in a casting circle.”
Harry, peeved that Draco had won their silent walking race, pushed past him in an attempt to squeeze in the door first. Draco had other ideas, though, and shoved Harry against the doorframe. They struggled for a moment, trying to keep each other from getting into the common room, then both burst through the doorway at once in a tangle of limbs.
“It was a war,” Draco answered, fingers rubbing circles on Harry’s back. “There’s nothing pretty about a war. And it’s easier for me, it is, because in a way I get to atone for the things I’ve done. I get to acknowledge my mistakes, move on and become a different person. No one expects you to change, because everyone sees you as a hero. I used to be so jealous of that.” A silence. “I’m sorry.”
When they finally broke apart, flushed and out of breath and weak with exhilaration, all they could do is laugh at first.
Draco looked sincere and earnest, all glistening grey eyes and marble-coloured skin in the soft light. Harry felt his heart fill with affection at the sight.
“Make it good,” Harry said, his eyes lighting up as Draco leant in and pressed their lips together. He smiled into the kiss, returning it enthusiastically.
“I know,” Draco whispered as tears fell round and wet on Harry’s robes. “When he moved in at the Manor, I thought I was proud that he had chosen our home as his residence. I thought I had chosen it, deserved it, I thought I had to be happy to take the mark. And then Mother started falling apart, I’d notice empty bottles in her room, and she’d go without eating for days. And there was nothing I could do about it. I loved her so much and there was nothing I could do.”
“Not a lot we did was really a choice, was it?” Harry finally said when their breathing had become regular again.
“I’m sorry, Harry, I really am. But honestly, we’re all at our wits end, here. You’re transforming our common room into a boxing ring more often than not, and none of us here can concentrate on our homework with your constant bickering,” Hermione said, softly, her dark eyes grave and solemn.
Harry paused before he answered, causing Draco to tilt his head up. “I was,” he said eventually. “Now I’m not.”
A fist, balled. A punch, thrown. Runes, glittering up and down skins. Fingers clasping upon fingers, and then, silence. Harry dragged Draco to a small door hidden behind a tapestry and into a small, bare room with nothing but a wooden bed. Neither of the boys said anything as they slid into bed fully clothed, bodies slack and empty as if the fit of anger had drained the life out of them.
“Very philosophical, Potter,” Draco said with a small smile. “I suppose you want the Weasley girl? You were going out with her, were you not?”
“Something about rough love. Doesn’t matter. I mean—I don’t want this to end. I know we’ve had our differences in the past, and I know sometimes the line between love and hate is thinner than we expect. I don’t want any of this to matter. I want to have this. With you. I want to kiss you, and hold you, and only fight about the small stuff.”
“We probably ought to go warn our captors of the dreadful consequences of their actions, at some point. Shall we?”
“I’m starting to tune them out,” Hermione admitted. “I really thought things would be different after everything that went on.”
“You are, and you know it,” Harry said, moving to stand right in front of Draco so that they were nose to nose.
Harry pulled Draco closer at that. Draco wound his arms tight against Harry’s shoulders and Harry let his head rest on Draco’s shoulder. They cried for a while, in silence, holding each other tightly, hands clutching at fabric.
“Yeah, I do. And Ron closes the curtains for me every night, but I don’t actually sleep in it.” Harry was picking at the sleeve of his jumper, his entire body tense and awkward. Draco didn’t notice any of it.
Harry shook his head. “No-one has offered me anything for them,” he replied. “The Mind Healer prefers to try and address them in a more holistic way instead of using potions.”
Arguing and begging their captors to set them free having proven entirely useless, Harry and Draco spent a good portion of the evening bickering over whose fault it was that they found themselves in this situation. They thus discovered that the spell
“We should go to sleep,” Harry finally said when they were the only people left (Draco was holding Harry’s wrist with two fingers and an expression of absolute disgust on his face, like his hand was a half-decomposed grindylow.) “I… uh… I should tell you I have my own room.”
“Something like that,” Harry replied, shrugging slightly. “I broke up with her at the beginning of the war. It wasn’t fair to keep her waiting for me when… when I might never make it back.”
“What? No! I’m not coming with you to the toilet!” Draco protested, shuffling away from Harry while leaving his hand resting on the Gryffindor’s midriff.
“Of course you would speak French, you posh git,” Harry laughed, “but you’ll need to speak English if you want me to understand anything.”
consider violence to be an adequate form of contact. It flared up in tiny, glittering, painful runes as soon as they tried to throw a punch. They couldn’t fight without feeling like their skin had been set on fire, so they settled for looking as miserable as damp kneazles, slumped in a corner of the room.
“Can… can I ask why?” Harry said softly. “I mean, you could have your pick of Pureblood girls. You’re… not exactly ugly, after all. And you’re a Malfoy.”
Harry had his fist halfway to Draco’s face when Pansy spoke up. “Hello, boys. If you could pause for a moment, please.”
Pansy cleared her throat. “We, the entire eighth year, have taken a vote. It was unanimously decided that something needed to be done about your childish bickering and ridiculous rivalry. We have determined that the only way you two will learn to get along is by getting to know each other—”
“Sorry to hear that,” Draco replied, not really sure what else to say. “When you say your heart wasn’t in it… why was that?”
“Are you telling me you never snuck a look at him in the showers?” Draco pressed, raising an eyebrow again.
Feeling his heart pounding in his chest, Harry leant forward and crushed his lips against Draco’s in an awkward kiss.
The rest of their year - the traitors - were happily ignoring them, and, as the evening dragged on, the room gradually emptied as everyone found their way into bed.
Once fed, only the matter where to spend their day remained. The dorms were too risky of course, it would be the first place anyone would look for them. The infirmary would have been the reasonable choice, but neither of them mentioned it, perhaps because the room still held memories that they weren’t ready to revisit quite yet. They ended up in an empty classroom on the fourth floor instead where they did homework for a while. Neither of them could concentrate on their reading and essays, not with the curse, and the nightmares, and everything that had transpired in the last few hours, so they soon took to playing games instead.
Hesitant, the other wizard shook his head. "Better not," but Harry merely shifted the boy's weight and gestured. "Come on. It will be all right, I promise."
So, she considered her fist impulse to answer Ron's shouts forgivable but immediately stopped after becoming conscious of the futility of the attempt. No chance that the wards would allow something as evident as loud noises to escape. As Ron walked from room to room, she grasped that he and most likely Harry and a team of Aurors had no way of finding them. Their concealment was too perfect. She had to help them. Sound would not travel. Neither would vibrations. Not that she had any chance of causing a big enough ruckus without a wand to be noticeable. Aquamenti was not an option for the same reason. It surpassed her wandless abilities. Also, cold water might send Lucius into a hypothermic shock, and Hermione did not fancy drowning, anyway. That left … air.
Harry learned about civilisations hidden so long that they had been forgotten by the modern world. About magic so woven into a place and the people living there, that it needed to be maintained, cast, savoured for the earth to stay alive. He was taught about ley-lines and focus points. How magic required an anchor on the planet and that the magic of the land always called to its wizards. Harry might be able to cast light-spells, even in these dark surroundings, but they were feeble and weak, despite his power. They taught him incantations in their mother-tongue, dark and powerful, to heal, to destroy, to grow. They would be weaker in his home, because the British Isle, Albion was the white island so the magic there was as well. But – he understood – light did not mean good and dark did not mean evil. Snakes were a powerful symbol in their society, and as soon as they learned that he could speak to them, they guided him into a tomb deep under the floor of the great temple. There he understood for the first time that parselmouth was more than a way to converse with snakes. It was a unique form of magic, dark but not evil if the caster had no according intentions. It was just a different way to channel what was there.
For Neville, the box contained a leather cuff. It was made of white leather and was adorned with dark engravings of the moon through its circle. Though it seemed a little worn on the edges, it was still beautiful.
The roused conversation had the four friends look at each other hopefully. Their suspended wait was interrupted when the delinquent spat out with a rasped voice, “You can’t mean that, Potter. What you plan is social suicide! We both know that I will never bow to you.”
"Wouldn't it …," the boy … young man started somewhat hesitant. "I mean, I know we're not ready for the world to know that you're alive. But wouldn't it be easier to first exhaust the Malfoy and Black libraries before we place any orders with Flourish and Blotts?" When the Potion Master frowned, Harry hastened to add, "It's not about the price! I know you can afford them. But shouldn't we start with what is already available before you start spending your money at random?"
Looking after him dashing out, Harry reflected, "I always forget how smart he really is. I mean he was almost always on top of our classes, right on par with Hermione. But since she's a muggle−born, we simply overlooked Draco's achievements."
Leaning against the desk, something Narcissa noticed with an exaggerated frown until her son summoned a chair and sat properly, Draco pondered. "I think Draca is right, though. We have perfected the potions as much as possible. At least in theory. We need life tests to find potential flaws."
Remembering his time as head of Slytherin House, the wizard pondered, "In my experience, the Lady Greengrass has raised two very perceptive and cunning daughters. What part of this arrangement sits ill with you?"
"We would be tremendously grateful, Miss Weasley," Lucius remarked, not daring to look away from his liege. He had faulted this girl in so many ways, still, she seemed easily ready to forget his past transgressions in favour of caring for her friend. A part of him wondered if this easy truce was not too good to be true.
The overjoyed applause made even the grumpiest professor smile as pupils had dashed to their dormitories to bundle up.
For a moment, Harry's eyes became impossibly large. Emilia was gone for the day, and he and Draco had come to the unspoken agreement, that Harry had an hour in the evening alone with Snape, before the blond would join them. Hence, Severus Snape had asked
Caressing the table with the tips of his fingers, Severus promised quietly, "We will come for you. You just need to hold on a little longer." Then he tipped back the last potion and departed for his room.
Gesturing towards the bowl, the horseman replied, "I came to return something to its rightful owner."
So, this was how it was going to be: carrot and stick from her and the enchanted mirror, dripping poison into his ear at every opportunity. Not knowing how far the spell went, if there may even be a monitoring charm woven into it, Draco had chosen not to reply. Instead, he had turned away and had closed the door firmly behind himself. Back in the bedroom, he had studied the floorboards, knocked on the walls, everything he could remember to find a potentially concealed door. He had not had a lot of hope to find any means of escape, but if this house was at least partially like Malfoy Manor, there might be hidden passages.
Having given the majority of the power for the expansion, as well as the adjustments of the wards, Harry was swaying on his feet once they were finished. Before his friends or even the Malfoys could reach out, Kreacher decided, "Master will go to bed now and get some rest." Bundling the baby up in a warm shawl, before putting her to bed, the elf turned around and despite Harry's protests, snapped his fingers and the young wizard was gone. Crawling into his own bed, the elf informed the rest, "Masters and Mistresses will now leave as well. Ba… Emerald needs her sleep."
Understanding that his friend needed time, the brunet nodded and changed the topic. "Now that he's officially back from the dead, he can't wait to go shopping?"
"I did, but the two of you will be just fine on your own," Draco assured them. "The Royal Botanical Gardens are marvellous, and you undoubtedly will enjoy them without me."
Sorry for the delay, but my husband and son attended a triathlon yesterday and we were out all day. It was an enjoyable day in the sun and both men did very good :).
"By Merlin and Morgana," Leewood breathed, visibly in awe at Harry's ritual space. "Who helped you set this up?"
bed, and replied, "Hogwarts gave me access to his rooms, the day after Halloween. Afterwards, when I asked Minerva about borrowing the bed, she made it clear that she considered me Snape's guardian, for now. Hence it would be my decision as to what happens to his things. So, I decided …," looking around, flickering his wand over the walls to change the light green to a warm beige, making the room more inviting, the Gryffindor shrugged. "I decided that I wanted him to be comfortable … familiar with his surroundings. The mattress is still one specially made for coma patients. But the bed and the chair, the rugs and the curtains … I thought he might prefer them this way. Those were his choices for his rooms at Hogwarts after all."
"Requirement of what?" Charles asked confused, but Harry and Neville merely brushed the question aside and took up positions, closing their eyes. For a few seconds, nothing happened, and their team-leader was about to snap at them again. But then they duo took a deep breath, stepped forward … and were gone.
"Great," Neville beamed. "I think you might want to change into something sturdy and warm. We will spend the majority of our day outside."
It was amusing to Luna that she – despite being chief editor of a magazine, about to be married to an Auror – was still a 'child' in Augusta Longbottom's eyes. Still, she had no intentions of contradicting her future grandmother-in-law, so she followed her to an abandoned bedroom. The elderly witch hesitated for a moment. Enough for Luna to put a hand on her arm, "You don't have to do this."
"Andromeda, I …" But she interrupted him with but a simple gesture. "I want to be alone with my sister. Maybe you should introduce Teddy to his uncle Draco."
Contrary to his usually self-assured behaviour, Kreacher cowered before his Master, wailing dejectedly, "Kreacher is sorry, Master. Kreacher knows this task is important. That Master Draco is important! But me couldn't … Kreacher couldn't …" He started to pull on his ears, violently.
"Auror Jenkins, so good to see you again." She said in an overly friendly tone. "and you brought Lady Malfoy, how very thoughtful of you. I'm sure Harry will appreciate your efforts when he wakes. Now, Narcissa−dear, why don't you help me feed that stubborn son of yours? In his concerns for Harry, he is neglecting himself entirely."
The Malfoys in the kitchen watched with rapt attention how a wizard, barely in his twenties, could evoke such a tremendously bad conscience in a child with but a few, calm words. Both Lucius, as well as his father, had used much harsher methods when bringing their sons to heel. They were even more surprised when they heard the young boy sniffing, asking in a thick voice, "Do you hate me now?"
"Then do it yourself, you stupid bastard!" Harry screamed, taking the older man aback. "What kind of asshole do you take me for, that I would decide your fate? I! Am! Not! Tom! Marvolo! Riddle!"
"Draco mouthed off, and I jumped down his throat. This case is killing me, Neville. Too many bad memories."
Embarrassed by the praise, Draco explained, "It's just hot apple−juice with a few spices thrown in for effect. Sev…" he cleared his throat against the sudden blockage, before he continued, "Severus made it for me when I was little."
When Harry tapered off, Hermione continued for him, "That way, even if the body's attacked or destroyed, the wizard cannot die, for a part of his soul remains earthbound. Herpo the Foul, in Ancient Greece, was the first known wizard who practised this atrocity."
After choosing pictures for all rooms - Kreacher had unearthed real treasures, brighter and friendlier than Harry could have ever hoped for in a Black house - the young man decided to finally call it a day. He was surprised to hear someone knocking on his bedroom, but nobody entered. Usually, Draco was bolder than that. To his surprise, he found Severus right outside the door.
The next evening, the Slytherin team-captain had risen during dinner and announced, "For saving our beaters, I award Antoine Thomson, Sandra Jenkins and Ian Glen one house-point each."
The Minister of Magic allowed himself a small smile. "Redirecting magic is as easy as telling where the sun will come up. The knowledge is already there. You simply have to trust your instincts and not overthink it."
"Excellent!" Emilia beamed, squeezing his hand encouraging. "Blink once for 'No' and twice for 'Yes'. Can you do that for me?"
Looking at the work he had spread out over the desktop, Draco pondered quietly, "Maybe I should continue. I did not mean to fall asleep."
Reluctant, Harry relaxed again, revealing more of the child in his arms to those surrounding him. "I am not the only wizard here. Are you sure you don't want to ask one of the others?"
Instead of answering right away, the raven-haired clutched his best friend's robes and rode out another wave of pain, before he was able to reply. "It didn't fit the design."
Cleaning his nose with his sleeve, Teddy nodded. However, after a moment of pondering, he injected, "But how will it work if it's not even a real spell."
Pulling his wand, Harry cradled his former professor's hand and hissed at the leather. The older wizard's quiet groan had him look up, alarmed, "Is it hurting you?"
Helping herself to some toast and honey, Luna shook her head. "Harry and I have not spoken since St. Mungos."
From Charlie, Arthur looked towards his third son, who stood hand in hand with his wife Audrey and little Molly and Lucy peeking out from behind their legs. "Percival. Like your brothers, we named you after one of the great knights of old. We hoped that a strong name would lead to a strong spirit and you have indeed proven us right. Though your mother and I might have not agreed with every decision you have made in your life, in the end, you have become everything we could have ever hoped for and more. Facing one's mistakes takes a lot of courage. But apologising for them and changing one's way takes more backbone than most people possess. "You have certainly changed a lot over the last years, and always for the better. Please, take your family and join your mother and Charlie in our circle."
Grinning, Draco shared, "Because insulting him always riled you up and in third year, I learned not to go after Granger. She's one scary witch."
"The reasons for that are still discussed in the healer's community. Generally, most people consider it a combination of lifestyle and magic."
"Or we could ask the last Black who is still around," Harry suggested, looking over Neville's shoulder. "You know exactly where the cornerstone is. Don't you, Milady?"
"More like very old ones," McGonagall explained. "I have had tea with an old acquaintance a few weeks back. He wanted to pick my brain on incorporating more traditional celebrations into our social calendar. I admit that I was puzzled at first, but after giving the matter some thought, I think I understand where you are coming from."
“Yea,” Harry nodded, trying not to do anything indecent when dragging his least favourite silk boxers over Lucius’ damp legs. They had been a gag-gift from Ginny, bottle-green with little snitches zipping over them. Personally, he preferred a little more support, but right now they were perfect. Neville cast a Levi Corpus and helped to wrestle the spare robe on the still unconscious man. “Where do you want him?”
Lucius did not know if he was supposed to laugh or cry or sink to his knees once more, to thank his master for his benevolence. Harry solved his dilemma, when he commanded, “Sit down for god’s sake. Kreacher, we need tea!”
Nodding, Harry revealed, "It is a shot of espresso, with skimmed milk and two shots of hazelnut−syrup; not too sweet and low fat. The coffee I took from you had five shots of a spicy, overly−sweet syrup, whole milk and a generous serving of whipped cream your son enjoyed so readily."
Tilting her head, she revealed. "Whenever a long-time professor leaves, the castle seals off his or her quarters. After about a decade they open again, changed, and ready for a new occupant. We think the personal belongings transfer to the room of hidden things but have not been able to confirm that until now."
Harry and Draco were the last ones, who stood on the outside now. While the blond shivered slightly, making Harry step closer to him in wordless support, the raven-haired looked at his chosen family. His heart was overflowing with love for these people. For more than ten years now, they have stood by him. Not because he had been born their child, but because they had chosen to treat him as such.
"Exactly," Percy grinned. "Oh, something my baby-girl can't shut up about: please tell your Malfoy to bring his fox, or Molly - The Child ™ will be heartbroken."
Biting her lip, Astoria nodded and tried to angle her body towards the flames, when Draco fed more logs to the meagre remains of the floo-fire. Her subsequent whimper made both wizards instantly reached towards her, but neither touched. Quietly, Harry told her, "I need a diagnostic to know how to help you. Draco is better with the charm. May he cast it?"
"You don't," his partner assured. "But you see, our deities are different from the Christian god. Many stand for different aspects. Some share traits. You can make sacrifices and pray to the one you can relate to the most."
The two Aurors were out of the door a heartbeat later, leaving the Malfoys to share concerned glances. “Do you think Harry is going to be alright, father?” Draco voiced his worries.
Shaking his head, Severus replied, "No, I don't. I just told you that he had them the night in the forest. He left the stone there and broke the wand the next day."
Putting an only miniscule shaking hand on the raven-haired's chest to calm him, Draco assured, "You were there when I needed you. He scared me, but he did not harm me. Thank you, Harry."
When his former professor incredulously turned his head, Draco gave a humourless chuckle. "Hard to believe, isn't it?"
team, and if you pull shit like this again, I will kick you, your partner and your precious purebloods out faster than you can say 'Protego'. Do we understand each other?"
Satisfied, Walburga swished her painted wand - Harry was not sure if he felt comforted seeing it here, as it had hurt Narcissa so much before yielding to the witch - and all of a sudden, the unmovable portrait could be removed. Together, Harry and Neville carefully set it aside, before the young pureblood started casting again. After a few minutes, he groaned in frustration. "Harry, could you tell your wards to stop widdling around for one, bloody minute?!"
Popping up on the table, the house-elf looked around. "Master Harry persuaded Hogwarts already. What does he need Kreacher for?"
"You can turn around now," the young witch informed them, wrapping Harry's satin nightgown around herself. She nodded her thanks when Draco offered a soft blanket in addition. Hesitating for a moment, as if unsure if she wanted to share this information, the young witch revealed, "When you treat your servants kindly, they become very loyal. Even if you are new to the house. Whereas, when you only offer insults and abuse, they do as you order, but don't necessarily follow your intentions."
Hermione was looking at her husband in surprise, but Harry was already turning his head, requesting quietly, "Draco?"
“No one could survive on these rations, let alone two people!” Harry glared, snapping at the colleague who oversaw the Malfoy’s house arrest and the according to provisions.
"Let them," Neville shrugged, picking celery out of Harry's hair. "The tighter they believe Draco to be bound to Harry, the less fuss they will make."
"Yes," Draco admitted, "Emilia said that you are really pushing yourself and that she is worried that you will do yourself more harm than good. So, I looked into a few of Regulus old books and tweaked the formulas a little. Taking it, won't impair your ability to talk. It will just relax your throat."
Harry, however, had already fallen asleep, so Draco mumbled, "I hate you; stupid, impulsive, Gryffindor!"
Both Aurors could hear the effort Robarts put into maintaining his calm. Harry could have done without the accusing look Pince was giving him, but in the end, he knew he deserved it. However, "With all due respect, Sir, the Lady Malfoy was never a Death Eater."
Studying his companion, then his mother, the blond nodded and rose from his seat. "Of course, Harry. Daphne, if you would like to follow me, please. The room is right next to mine."
"Well, I was going over the books and pondered about what Pot… I mean Harry said." He gestured towards the volume. "I thought maybe I could look at the index and figure out what was wrong. You know, sometimes the magic just needs a little nudge and sorts itself out."
When Draco staggered into the kitchen around six the next morning, he found a bleary-eyed Harry, staring into his tea, while an energetic Teddy told about the wonders of his latest dream, seamlessly changing the topic to this day's activities when he noticed him entering. Though Harry had barely mumbled more than, "Yea!", "Hm …" or "Really?", encouraging his godson to continue, he wordlessly conjured another cup and gestured for Draco to help himself to some tea. It was clear that he was in no mood to make conversation. Actually, that suited Draco just fine since, despite going to bed with an elated feeling, nightmares had woken him every two to three hours. The anxiety of seeing his mother fall from the Astronomy tower instead of Dumbledore; the Dark Lord whispering praises into his ear; his father lying in a dark cell in Azkaban, soulless and cold had kept him from finding restful sleep.
"No," Severus admitted, "But being with Draco will be enough. Our little dragon can be quite courageous, repercussion of living with a Gryffindor I imagine. However, that does not mean he's not terrified. Me being with him will ease some of his fears."
Taking a deep breath, pulling his mask back on, Draco folded his arms and demanded, "Alright, Potter, spill!"
Peeking in through the window - the eldest Weasleys had worked tirelessly, for the last hour, to set up a pavilion with sufficient warming charms to hold all guests - the dragon tamer asked baffled, "Is that a snow fox?"
Nodding gravely, she flapped her ears and promised in a high-pitched whisper, "Emerald is a mouse, Sir-Harry-Master. Makes white-flower tea. No noise. Promise!"
There was a meaning behind being called by a title he had no official claim on yet, but Draco could not decipher it. However, instead of questioning the merit of the addressing, he decided to inquire about her. "I see you have given up your name. Did the properties go along with it?"
"Shire horses," Narcissa whispered, watching the impressive animals thundering around the hill, approaching the Lovegood residency at full speed. Draco's hand entwined with his mother's, but even then, Harry could see his fingers trembling with excitement. He seemed to gravitate towards the giant beasts, but his father held him back. "Don't, Draco. These are wild animals, not suitable for riding."
Harry was not belittling him. Instead, the boy had intended to offer an honest compliment. Therefore, he merely tilted his head. "Thank you." After a moment, he added, "And we agreed … upon Severus."
"If you two are finished discussing my personal affairs with the entire Auror department, I would greatly appreciate it, if someone would try and explain why we try to track an entire library." Kingsley demanded sternly. "It's not as if the British Library will stand up and leave London."
All four actually, since all of a sudden, memories that were not his, rose to the surface of Draco's mind. "It weighted you down … like lead."
While the raven-haired was hitting the table with his head, Lucius returned to his papers with a quiet chuckle, while Draco offered more steaming apple−juice.
The former Lord would have loved to point out that that did not make him feel particularly safe and was reluctant to admit that he had no clue of how to end the spell.
Slowly, Teddy shortened his steps, then came to a halt. Worried, the two wizards traded a glance before they nudged the child to climb a wall, so they could all be eye-to-eye. The boy, however, fidgeted with the lapels of his shirt and avoided looking at them. Gently, Harry caressed his small face. "Teddy, cub, what happened?"
At Harry's slightly disgusted look, Ron sighed, clapping his shoulder, "Yep, the time has come again. Best not to look. At least it's not chocolate this time around."
Trading a conspiratorial look with Harry, the strawberry-blond shared, "It was her favourite dress, and she even smuggled cupcakes into the girls' room, when my sister sent them to bed without dessert for ruining it."
The wand flew out of Lostrife's hand and bounced off their shield. Auror Robarts was beside them in an instant, stupefying the convicted Death Eater before turning towards Malfoy with burning eyes. "When did you get a new wand?" He reached out to take the cane but was repelled by the shield.
“Get up, Malfoy, please. And don’t call me ‘my Lord’ … I mean ever! I’m not Tom.” While guiding the broken, young man to the couch once more, rubbing his arms in a helpless, soothing gesture, Harry’s brain raced through possible scenarios. Malfoy had offered himself, but since he had not accepted the submission, no magical oath was binding them for now, only the blond’s promise. Concerning Draco’s father … he needed Hermione, and fast!
Folding his arms before his chest, Severus sneered, "To what moment are you referring to? The minute my godson stumbled into my room in the afternoon, distraught because he was convinced that he had angered you by allowing Astoria to invite herself to Grimmauld Place? Or maybe the hour he came for dinner, sharing that you still had not returned from wherever you had gone. Of course, you could also refer to the moment when Kreacher was forced to wake me from a rather amicable dream, since Ron and Hermione were waiting in the floo, because you had been in the air for hours and they needed to go to bed, since it's a Sunday, but didn't feel comfortable to leave you on your own."
Now, he was faced with formulas that proved that his idea could actually work. It was a two-component solution, making it a lot harder to discover then a 'simple' poison. The question was, did he actually want this? No matter if someone else would have to administer it. The effect would be Draco's responsibility.
"Repaired the stove," Christopher shrugged, "Honestly, what good is a kitchen that only works for one witch? We need Lady Malfoy. There is no use in her heading for the kitchen, every time one of us fancies a spot of tea."
Relieved that he could finally leave those two to their work, Harry turned towards the door. However, before he could slip out, a quiet voice held him back, "Mister Potter."
With a beaming smile, Harry put an arm around his partner and laughed, "You, my friend, are brilliant!"
Closing his eyes, Harry turned away. It hurt to see Severus choosing Draco over him. It was the way it should be - he reminded himself - he
When Teddy interrupted their conversation, announcing he was going to jump over a boulder, Harry's mask was firmly back in place. After the successful jump and the proper congratulations, Draco turned towards his former nemesis again, tilting his head humbly. "Thank you, for starting with mine."
"Because the previous one was a jerk?" Harry half asked, half told, as if really not understanding why anybody would want to keep Auror Jenkins in charge of one's provisions, especially in his exhausted state. When he noticed the worry in the older wizard's eyes, he briefly touched his shoulder and nudged him towards the fireplace. "Don't worry, Lucius, everything is fine. Narcissa will explain. I'm just beat. But trust me, this is a good thing."
Looking at the patient, who lay unmoving, Harry gave in to the illusion that he was listening attentively. So, he slipped from the windowsill and claimed his armchair. "Albion … Great Britain … it is as if the light magic permeates every living thing; every tree, every plant, every beast that calls the white isle his or her home. In India, you can taste the magic in the air. A snake I befriended, told me she could even feel it in her belly when she slithered over the earth. Magic wasn't dark there, but it wasn't light either. I could not put my finger on it, but it felt … kind of … reddish brown. Like the power came from the life that populates the land. Brazil …"
On their way to Harry and Neville's office, Alexander Pince pulled the younger Auror aside and hissed, "I do not appreciate you going behind my back, Potter! You might be Robarts' favourite pet, but that does not make you in any way special! You are still a member of my team, and if you pull shit like this again, I will kick you, your partner and your precious purebloods out faster than you can say 'Protego'. Do we understand each other?"
"Ruby cannot tell the wizards of any of Mistress' guests. Mistress does not entertain guests in her home!"
Sighing, leaning against Lucius' chest, Hermione mumbled, "Nobody can change the past. All we can do is work for a better future."
As Ron and Harry hugged briefly, Astoria did the same to Draco. Kissing his cheek, she whispered something in his ear that made him smile ever so cautiously. Before the blond had a chance to reply, she apparated away.
"None taken," their fellow Gryffindor assured. "But that's the reason, Ron. You and Harry know Hermione. You love her more than anything. No chance are you objective enough to lead this investigation."
At least he seemed confused, but Andromeda could see faint hurt beneath his initial reaction. He believed himself without backup by someone he had trusted implicitly, and the former Black sister felt the absurd impulse to chuckle because nothing could be further from the truth. She would always have the young man's back, not because of how much he had sacrificed, but because of who he was: a good person at heart, despite all the hardships he had suffered. Sometimes that meant acting like a friend, sometimes like a mother. But at times like these, it meant merely pointing him in the right direction when he had tangled himself up in so many knots, that he could not see what was important. "Of course, I want that, Harry. I understand and support your plans unquestioningly. What I don't understand, is why you are so concerned with the laws when you should concentrate on the people."
Taking a steeling breath, the two Gryffindors headed for their former professor's room. "Sir, may we come in?"
Groaning, the raven brushed through his hair, making it stand up even more. Helplessly, he revealed, “Lots of things here don’t work the way they should. But mostly they are minor inconveniences. I did not realise that things could react differently, depending on who uses them.”
There was some shuffling, before the other wizard continued, in a much quieter tone. "I wish you could advise me in this. You were Lucius' friend once. God, I wish you were awake."
Pressing his lips together, Leewood first nodded and then shook his head. Pince touched his shoulder with evident concern, "Charles, what is it?"
Gesturing for Draco to come in, Harry revealed, "Our residing Potion Master caught Lucius sneaking into my office, on Hermione's orders."
"Yes, … okay, I have an idea. When I returned from Brazil, the Mayan Priests tied their leylines to those of Stonehenge, then they sent me on my way. But I don't want to risk Draco's life on a hunch. Alright?"
"Alright," the brunet groaned. "Then we'll take the long way around. We have to enter every room and corridor and cast charms that might reveal magical anchors. Sooner or later, I'm sure we'll find it."
Revising the information, Harry beamed after a moment. "That's the chicken in wine−sauce with the little potatoes. I love that!"
When Draco did not reply for an extended amount of time, Harry moved closer. He put a gentle hand on the blond's shoulder and urged, "Nobody can know about this, Draco. That is really important! Not even your parents! Do you understand?"
Making a gesture that was neither here nor there, the witch revealed, "Don't get me wrong, meals without preservatives and the chemical enhanced flavours muggles seem so fond off, the lack of electricity and the need to rely on mechanical instead of radiation … ahm … fuelled energy creation, and last but not least our potions, that can nip mental and physiological problems in the bud before they become chronical … we may not be as forward-looking as the muggles, but in my opinion, we are better off the way we are."
Spelling all the magazines back into the box, in reverse order this time, the young wizard retreated with a quiet, "I'll leave you to it. Have a good evening." While Severus was already leafing through the last copy, he could vaguely remember July 1997.
With a wicked gleam in his eyes, Harry inquired, "Is that so." Then he leaned down and whispered words directly into the Potion Master's skin.
Kreacher, who had supervised Emerald and the strange elf like a hawk, piped up, "Why does Master want the elf to tell Master Draco's location?"
While Ron put a stasis charm on the dish, Hermione neatly arranged everything on a tray, and Harry requested, "Kreacher, could you please let Ron and Hermione in. Maybe they can help Draco."
At Harry's surprised gaze, the Auror shrugged, "Robarts never lets anyone break formation. He must have an excellent reason for allowing you to."
"Severus loved this dish, do you remember, Draco?" Narcissa reminisced with a fond smile on her face, a few bites into the meal. "Whenever he could actually make it on a Sunday, he always encouraged me to put it on the menu."
"Nothing is wrong with Kreacher, Master!" The elf replied relieved. "Me found shelter in the stove in the kitchen. Kreacher was never harmed."
Draco knew that he would never gain much of Potter's trust as Granger or Weasley … or Weasleys in this case, but he could work on earning a little. A little bit would be enough.
"I think Mr Potter would benefit from a mild pain potion and a muscle relaxant," the tall man advised in a deep, calm tone. "Do you have those in stock?"
"Who wouldn't? Your pendants are beautiful. But now let's say goodnight to Nana and then start your bath. It's getting late already."
When Lucius entered the office twenty minutes later, he found Hermione in front of the fireplace, curled up in a comfortable armchair, with a sizable breakfast. "No, I have not been part of any interrogations, but a blood-sacrifice does make sense. I mean they were torturing him anyway. What reason did they have to lie? And after studying this cult … >And when men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give glory readily to whom she will.< … Hecate was, originally, a goddess of protection and her only sacrifices were dogs. But these cultists have twisted that belief. They are convinced our society is at a crossroad and that only those who can gain the favour of Hecate will prosper. Gods of old cherished blood sacrifices. I imagine, in their own, twisted minds, this absolutely makes sense."
before relapsing into another fit of screams. Draco’s chest slowly filled with ice. He’d awoken more than once with tears drenching his pillow and a throat raw from having screamed too much. Those nights, it took hours just to stop the tremors, and his mind had a way of turning every sound he heard into Voldemort’s voice or footsteps. Perhaps, Potter hadn’t entirely deserved his cutting words from earlier. Perhaps the boy had suffered and lost as much as everyone in this hell of a war. Perhaps neither fame nor glory made all the pain and death worthwhile. Slowly, he shifted in the bed, and brought his hand up to Potter’s face, the touch, awkward at first, growing into a caress. His mother used to soothe him back to sleep when he was a child: he found her words sitting on his tongue, and spoke them softly to Potter until the boy grew still and soft under his hands, until they both sunk into a deep, peaceful sleep, breaths and limbs mingling.
“Thank you, gentlemen. You may learn manners yet.” Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t interrupt. “Our first thought was to trap you in a room together, but that was logistically difficult. The lovely Miss Granger did some research and found the perfect solution: the aptly-named Get Along Spell. Hermione, would you like to explain it?”
Draco fought against the impulse to answer something terribly vulgar back at Pansy. It was something he would have done if they were alone, just the two of them, and he could let the mask fall and be himself. But they weren’t alone, because he was permanently glued to Harry until they found a way to break the stupid curse, and because Pansy appeared permanently glued to Hermione as well, judging by the way she rubbed the brown-skinned girl’s shoulders gently.
“Hermione, what are you saying? We have to—touch all the time?” Harry flushed as he spoke and pointedly moved as far away from Draco as the circle would allow.
“Access to the kitchen,” Harry whispered, his tone conspiratorial and almost playful. “Tickle the pear.”
“Dreamless Sleep. When I remember it,” Draco replied. “Listen, I, er, I owe you an apology. For what I said when you told me about this room. You… you didn’t deserve that.”
Hermione nodded and pulled out her wand. “Stay still,” she instructed. She stood up and passed her wand over the two boys, murmuring an incantation. A few seconds later, she smiled and put her wand away. “It’s gone. It determined that you’ve definitely made up.”
Draco had drifted off into a fitful, anxious sleep when he was awoken by blood curdling screams. Harry was writhing, as if in pain, tears staining his cheeks, breath rapid and shallow. Draco’s eyes sought his hand at first, worried that lack of contact was causing this reaction, but his hand was resting on Harry’s back, underneath his heavy woollen jumper and the soft cotton of his t-shirt. Nightmares, Draco realised when Harry blindly begged an invisible shadow to
“Are they at it again?” Pansy asked with a sigh as she crossed the room to sit next to Hermione. They’d struck up a most unlikely friendship since being back at Hogwarts, what with all the eighth-years now sharing one common room.
“Yep,” Hermione sighed, closing her book. “They’ve already argued about a bowl, the last bit of milk and now the mug.”
“You could have gone straight into Auror training, with you being the hero of the wizarding world and all that.” Draco continued all the same.
Draco nodded. “You can imagine the confusion that caused me,” he said. “He was in Gryffindor for a start. Though… I’ve recently come to realise that not all Gryffindors are bad.”
Draco’s eyes widened in horror. “Not until just now! Oh, Merlin, I’m going to kill Pansy! How are we meant to shower if we have to touch the whole time?!”
Draco heaved a sigh, shifting so that he was leaning against Harry but not looking at him. “Yes. He’s always - from the moment I started at Hogwarts - spoke of how I’ll eventually be married to a nice, Pureblood girl and we’ll produce an heir to the Malfoy name. He’s never asked me, not once, whether that’s something
“We aren’t sure about specific requirements for the spell, but it’s likely you’ll have to be skin-to-skin.” Hermione looked entirely too pleased with herself.
“Uh—” Blaise stuttered. “I may have mentioned it to her when I was visiting. Like a good son does. You should try it.”
And now Draco sat next to him at the dinner table, humming along to the Muggle Christmas song on the wireless, tapping the quill against his chin as he thought. His fringe was in his eyes again, and Harry ran his fingers through the fringe, pushing it out of the way, but it fell right back. Harry knew he was supposed to be listening, but he was foggy, imagining slowly removing Draco’s t-shirt, kissing the length of his collarbone, maybe only stopping to leave marks.
Harry carried on, explaining his Otoscope, his stethoscope, his tongue depressor and then using each. Scorpius said aaaah! Took deep breaths and breathed out slowly. Harry even checked for abnormal swelling in the lymph nodes and organs, squeezing and prodding until Scorpius was giggling and shouting “Red! Red!” It was the first bit of life he’d seen in the 7 year old.
Draco rolled his eyes. “It is possible for two men to be mates, Potter. Even if one is gay and the other straight. You could have just asked instead of assuming.”
Blaise circled his finger in the air. “C’mon. Film is expensive, and our benefactor wants to see a completed episode before they’ll pay for a full show.”
“We’ll see,” was as far as Draco would give, partly because he thought it was funny to see Potter so upset. Okay,
Harry shivered as he brought the box inside. The air was crisp and biting at midnight, but by mid-morning it would be too warm. Harry usually loved living in Florida, but Christmas hit different in warm weather. He missed snow and cold and hot cocoa, missed building snowmen and flying through flurries with the snowflakes rushing toward him. Not even the twinkling, colored fairy lights in the windows made him feel better.
Stepping closer, glaring at the young man, Charles Leewood growled, "We needed until midnight to change the bubbles back into the desk. A desk that still wobbles, I would like to add, since a few of them escaped into the hallway."
When the few drops of oil had burned down, Lucius went to pick up the watch to fasten it around Hermione's wrist again. He flinched when the watch gave him a nasty shock at first touch. She just shook her head at him. True, he could have guessed that her artefact was even better protected than his cane. Hermione Granger was one of the people closest to Harry Potter's heart. With a smile, she put it on herself. Compulsion or not, both breathed a little easier when she was protected once again. Once they had cleaned up after themselves, he prompted. "Come on, you have done everything you could. Let's get you to bed."
"Narcissa! NO!" Harry shouted, but before he could intervene, the witch had closed her hand around the wand that had hurt her before. The smell of burning flesh filled the vault, sickening in its sweetness. But Narcissa was not letting go. Calmly, she watched the faint smoke that curled up from her hand, as if the appendix was not even her own. Still, her voice shook when she demanded, "You might as well give in now because I have no intention of
Eyeing the files from work, the young man pushed them to the side and decided to find Narcissa, to discover the progress she had made.
Harry merely shrugged, "That was all any of us could really hope for. But my point is, you had no way of knowing."
How interesting, the young witch pondered upon sipping her freshly brewed tea. Obviously, structural changes to her cell were not permitted, and neither was taking her out. But anything that could be brought inside seemed to be fair game. Snuggling into the armchair she had requested, Hermione closed her eyes. If she was smart about this, she could surely find a way to contact Harry. Surely her brain would work better if she allowed herself a few minutes of rest.
"With all our strength and weaknesses, Hopes and fears we come to you now, Lady Magic. Fill us," he pleaded.
Chuckling weakly, a waking Harry injected, "With my luck, I would still have to fight Death-Eater-wannabes with but knitting needles as my only defence."
Another head shake. But Narcissa was not satisfied with non-verbal answers any longer. "What did he take?" She repeated the question, insisting on an answer.
"May the gods save me from noble Gryffindors!" Severus prayed under his breath, massaging the bridge of his nose. "How detailed was your education on pureblood customs? I know Mr Longbottom has attempted to lecture you on the topic."
Nodding tiredly, Harry recited. "Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death, appeared at once before him. Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally, the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as to truly join her."
After a few minutes, Draco replied, "A family. But my child could hardly be considered 'his' family. It is not as if we are …" He sighed dejectedly.
At least that made him smile weakly. Apparently, he was not the only one who had trouble adjusting to the new addressing of a former adversary.
Stepping up to the bed, yet holding back, since he as not sure if a tactile offer for comfort would be appreciated, Harry merely put his fingertips on the mattress, as close to his former professor's hand as he dared, without actually touching him. "Tom is responsible for Dumbledore's death, since he was the one who cursed the Gaunt ring. Dumbledore was responsible for his own death, because with his experience, he should have known better than to put on a ring of unknown origin. He was dying and you both knew it when you cast the spell. He could have jumped from the Astronomy tower that night. But it would have been agony to die that way. Having you cast the spell served his 'greater good' as well as assured a painless passing." Only when his tears wet their entwined fingers, did Harry realise that Snape had reached for him, not to take comfort, but to offer it. "In the end, you killed, and I died for his cause. But the war is over now, so I want it to end."
With a sigh, Severus had looked down at the two shining eyes, who had gazed up at him oh so eagerly. Harry seemed to be an excellent master, since the little house-elf always appeared healthy. Still, drained to the point of exhaustion, he had merely mumbled, "I wanted a glass of whiskey, but right now, all I need is to get back to bed."
Since this was not the first time something similar had happened to him, Harry was able to land on his feet. Thanks to his tight grip, the same was true for Draco. However, the moment the door fell shut, the blond violently pulled his arm away and zoned in on Harry. With force the Auror had not been prepared for, the blond hit him straight in the face. Since brawls were not that out of the ordinary, in his line of work, Harry did not falter. Regrettably, he could do nothing about the blood that started trickling down his nose; not even go and fetch a tissue, since Draco immediately started screaming at him. "What did you do? Everything was fine, and then he lost it … had a seizure or a panic attack or whatever. So, what the hell did you do to him, Potter?"
Both men were obviously doubtful as to follow that command, looking between an apprehensive Narcissa and Andromeda Tonks who had taken but one step into the room. Yet, at Harry's harsh, "Now!" they fled.
With a sigh, the raven-haired sank to the floor, pulling both Emerald and Kreacher into his arms. The later moved rather stiffly but gave up his resistance after a few moments. "It's okay. I know the two of you have tried your best. Kreacher, stop punishing yourself. We'll find another way." Looking up at his colleagues, he repeated hopefully, "We will, won't we?"
Tears rose in the young witches' eyes, as she whispered, "Have you ever considered that he simply does not want to live this way? Think about his situation. He was always self-reliant, navigating the demands of Dumbledore while pulling the wool over Tom's eyes. He was ready to die in the war, maybe even hoped for it, for the chance to see your mum again. But now he is lying in that bed, unable to walk, to talk, to use magic. He is dependent on others for the simplest things. For a man like Severus Snape, that must be torture."
“So, this is a test,” Robarts concluded. “You are using our current case to test Malfoy's trustworthiness.”
"I know they were," Draco shrugged. "I know him well enough by now to recognise that, but that does not make them any less true."
Studying his opposite testily, not sure if the other wizard was making fun of him, the blond nodded after a minute. "That would be welcome."
When he returned to Grimmauld Place, ten months after his departure, he had entered a home. Nothing perfect, but finally the place he knew he belonged. Rose Weasley had been born three days later, and Harry had, once more, become the godfather of the most beautiful baby.
At Neville's confused noise, the raven-haired shook his head, "Sorry, Neville, but that's private." Then he studied Severus, who was still staring at the portrait in shock. Smiling at his parents, he touched their frame, "Mum, Dad, welcome home."
Shaking her head, the former Lady Black looked at her husband, as if he was a particularly dense first year. "Magic is all about intent," she lectured. "But more than that, it is about belief. Not only what the witch or wizard believes, but those surrounding them. Our son is the perfect Slytherin. He thinks and watches and then decides on the course of action with the most benefits for himself and those he cares about. If everybody is convinced that he belongs to Harry Potter - the Saviour of the Wizarding World - mind, body and soul, he is safer by his side, than behind even the strongest wards of Malfoy Manor. They are bound together by a promise. Nothing more, nothing less. And you and I know perfectly well, how easily such a promise can be broken. Because otherwise, why would He have ever needed these?" she asked, gently brushing her fingers over the Dark Mark on Lucius' wrist.
"It's love, Lucius. The love of my mother saved me from the killing curse. My love for my friends made me come back when I had every right to go on. Narcissa's love for Draco saved me in the woods when she lied for me, so I had a chance to defeat Tom. And your love for your family made you turn your back on the dark
"Not like this, we won't," Neville directed the older wizard's attention towards Harry, who was still pacing, hissing furiously under his breath. "He's scared," the Gryffindor shared quietly.
"Because apart from his parents, Ron had five brothers and one sister," the raven-haired answered instead. "And
Shaking her head, ever so slightly, making Harry suspicious that the visible wound was not the only one, Astoria explained, "Of course not. I was tired and tripped on my way to bed. Our stairs are not covered by carpet and Alexio was too far behind to keep me from stumbling. I took care of the injury in the bathroom before studying the evening newspaper while Alexio went over his business reports, as is our habit."
The boy seemed to ponder that revelation, watching the ground, deep in thought. After a minute, he inquired, "And what do you think is Nana doing?"
"Pomme de Terre," the pureblood corrected him, rolling his eyes. "Honestly, sometimes you act like you were raised in a barn."
After breakfast, Draco prompted, "Would you join me in the lab, please? I have questions about your plans for my father."
"No, but I will," his best friend promised. "I rarely leave him out of my sight. You can trust me, Harry."
Instantly looking over towards his master's godson with concern, Kreacher gestured at the wizards. At Harry's and Draco's nod, Severus followed. The Potion Master appeared confused when the elf stopped outside of Harry's bedroom.
Ignoring the snickering of his colleagues, Harry relented, "Fine, Kreacher, are house-elves restricted by Fidelius Charms?"
When he had been snatched out of the garden of Grimmauld Place, he had fought his captors tooth and nail. When they had first thrown him in here, he had taken great pleasure in ripping the sheets, bashing the windows and scratching the furniture. Then the Lady of the house had entered.
"No," he whispered to himself. "Harry Potter is a good Master. Would not hurt baby." Looking up for the first time, he inquired hopefully. "Will Master claim her, so she can become useful and strong?"
Since he had been studying his opposite, he did not miss the small smile the young man hid before looking up.
And finally, the witch who zealously guarded one of the most significant collections of magic tomes in Scotland.
"He detests me!" Lucius despaired, walking a grove into the carpet of his wife's salon. "This will end badly for all of us. By Merlin."
"Thank you, Molly, I'll be delighted to be of assistance." The purebloods warm tone could not be more different from the one she had addressed the Auror with.
Used to follow his best friend’s advice, Harry left, sprinting towards his office, hoping, and praying that Neville was already in.”
Narrowing her eyes, the medi-witch hesitated for a heartbeat before she agreed, "I will take an egg as well, one strip of bacon and a slice of toast if you please."
It was … black, no surprise there. There were green fabrics, and silver edges decorating the furniture. One would expect such dark colours to make rooms gloomy and depressing, but nothing could be further from the truth. The black leather of the couch looked buttery soft and incredibly inviting. The black fixtures were - despite their lack of use - polished to a shine. Deep green armchairs offered a place to read in front of an open fire; and silver-grey curtains draped the glass-windows that seemed to look right into the lake, as well as a lovely picture of a summer meadow, with a gurgling stream running along the lower edge.
"Six years ago, I think. Maybe I should remedy that. I would not want one of my best friends to think me rude."
A few tapestries had been rolled up against the wall. The young witch, however, seemed more interested in what was behind them. Using their combined strength, the two wizards had stabilised the carpets, while Hermione had pulled out a covered painting. Putting it on a sideboard, after removing the jewellery case, she had folded back the protective fabric.
"You still don't get it, gorgeous." Cynthia Belfast chuckled when the young Auror's cheeks flared up. "Christopher did not abduct us. He explained what he wanted to achieve and then gave us the time-turner so we could convince ourselves to come along. No 'late night' conversations, no 'suspicious men' loitering around. I caught myself on the evening of my latest exhibition. Tomas picked himself up at the cafeteria at the University. Michael interrupted himself when going out for Sunday Roast and Irma found herself in the Restricted Section and then simply left Hogwarts via the Hogshead."
"Hey, …" Ron had soothed him, taking the book, carefully placing it back in the bag before zipping it closed. Then he had put his big, warm hand on Harry's shoulder, squeezing the muscles there soothingly. "It's okay. You can take it with you, look at it later. In a day, a week or a year. You have nothing to proove, Harry. It's just time for you to take this step. To use your parents' and Sirius' money in equal parts to build your future. That's why we're here. We've come a pretty long way already. It's alright to leave if you want."
Might." When he opened his mouth to contradict, she merely raised her hand." Please, let me explain." Sinking back reluctantly, Narcissa continued in a gentle tone. "Tell me, if you had known a simple shielding charm from a very young age, would your childhood have been as bad as it was? Or let us go one step further: What would have happened if you had grown up in an orphanage with magical children; witches and wizards taking care of you? What would have become of Tom Riddle? From what I understand, you were in contact with the echo of the charismatic student that later became Lord Voldemort. Is it really so hard to believe, that people - who wanted to preserve our ways - followed him?"
The Malfoys were already sitting at the table, sharing a pot of aromatic tea, while trading the newspaper. When the others entered, Narcissa got up instantly, but Harry soothed her. "It's the weekend, please allow me."
Stored and sealed in Alexander Pince's office were the scrolls that documented the spells Narcissa Malfoy would cast from now on. On top of the list ought to be 'Lumos', and Harry wondered what it was with Malfoys and light charms. Afterwards, Harry had escorted Narcissa to their armoury, where she had been equipped with an enchanted corset to wear under her clothes, also a black belt that contained a shielding charm. The young wizard could not suppress a proud smile when he noticed the logo of Weasleys Wizarding Wheezes on the inside of the buckle. Before they departed for the British Library, Harry offered two more items.
With a firm nod, the young witch confirmed. "Of course. I will take good care of it in the meantime."
Keeping the purpose of this task at the forefront of his mind, the former professor nodded, "I would be great… grateful."
Standing in front of the study of Malfoy Manor, Harry hesitated for a heartbeat. Looking at his friend, he pondered how to get her to leave. It was not that he had any secrets from Luna, he just …
Harry leaned against the handrail to the steps leading to the second story and listened. It was freezing inside this freaking house, and Potter had shucked his winter coat and was wearing some trashy white vest that had seen better days. And the short sleeves did nothing to cover his thick arms.
“Yes, but I have to make a phone call, and I’ll need to get some things from my flat.” Draco resisted the urge to stick his tongue out at Potter or to say
“Perfect,” Malfoy said as Ginny charmed the plastic cover closed over twenty-four cupcakes in a rectangle, iced as one, with
he thought. He leaned forward and rested his head in his hands; the pain of his elbows digging in to his thighs wasn’t as bad as watching Malfoy drape himself over his boyfriend.
Draco traced his fingers down Harry’s bare chest. It was grimy with dust and sweat from the day’s hard work, but Draco didn’t care. “You need a shower.”
“And what about the cup of coffee?” Potter pointed to the mug that was still hot under a stasis spell.
“Scorpius, I’m going to swipe the inside of your nose with this cotton swab and try to get some of your boogers.” Strictly speaking that wasn’t true, but it made Scorpius laugh and that had been Harry’s goal. “I have a special spell that will make your nose all numb. The only problem is, you won’t be able to pretend you’re a bunny for maybe the next hour.”
The ruling board was going to decide that his innovations were illegal. The time and money he and Draco had poured in so far—the BIQL wasn’t going to take that away from them.
“I get that. You’re Harry Potter. You have to uphold the Wizarding laws of our great nation,” John says, with his hand over his heart.
Harry stood abruptly and leaned forward, resting his weight on his fists. That way, he couldn’t punch Malfoy in his pompous, posh mouth. “No, because I’ve grown the fuck up. You should try it.”
Scorpius’ eyes were the same stormy grey as his father’s, but not quite the same shape. A little rounder, a little closer together.
“I spent some time a few years ago, travelling in the States. It was after Ginny and I broke up—” Harry stated it as information that needed to be out there. If Draco had any questions, they needed to address them now.
“That’s—brilliant,” Harry said in awe. “I love that park! And the room feels brilliant, too. It’s all—”
Obviously Lundberg and he were close enough that Malfoy knew the owl on sight. What the hell was Malfoy playing at, sitting on his lap and making Harry almost kiss him when he—he—he knew
Potter rescued the spaghetti sauce and tapped the water pot to boil. While they waited, Potter said, “Blaise left us a camera. It’s just for us. We’re supposed to use it—they said for us to pretend it’s another person we’re talking to.” He shrugged, and Draco was glad it made no sense to Potter, either.
Draco cocked his head like he wanted to ask, but Harry grabbed his arm and side-alonged to the Burrow, shoving one of the bags of food into Draco’s hand.
“Oh Harry. Please don’t say you haven’t left yet.” Dylan’s voice was full of disappointment and Harry squirmed at how much it sounded Aunt Petunia’s. “I guess I could meet you there, but I hate to have two cars—”
“Why do you think I have this room of my own?” Harry muttered, closing his eyes. “If I’m in here, I’m not going to keep everyone else awake.”
Draco slipped his hand down from Harry’s wrists until their palms were touching, and threaded their fingers together. Harry took the gesture as acquiescence to his previous proposition; he smiled and led Draco through winding stone corridors until they stood in front of a still-life painting of a bowl of fruit.
Pansy glanced at Hermione worriedly. Had their plan gone terribly wrong somehow? Had the curse done something unexpected?
The words were apparently Pansy’s idea of a greeting or an apology. Hermione had the decency to look at least somewhat guilty besides her as she twirled a strand of hair around the fingers of her left hand, but she offered no more apologies than her co-conspirator.
They did not stop kissing, not even when their skin glowed purple and bright with runes that felt like droplets of fresh water on their skins on a hot summer day. Every single emotion in their chest suddenly swelled and unfurled in waves, crashing against their ribs as they breathed in moans and whimpers, and all they knew was the excruciating desire for more—kisses and touches and bare skin.
Harry snorted and shook his head. “I can’t believe you fancied Wood,” he muttered. “You wouldn’t have if you’d been on the team with him.”
Now, Harry had a new friend. An old one to be sure, but also it was something new. He watched Draco carry Scorpius back to the bedroom and waited for him to get back.
Harry and Malfoy said at the same time, one louder than the other, but that still didn’t stop Scorpius who was bouncing on the mattress with more energy than he’d had the entire time Harry had been there.
Draco shivered and pushed the thought out of his mind.  As he backed out of the room, his hip knocked into a small end table; a crystal stag wobbled and almost fell from the table. “Thank Merlin no one lives here,” he said as he steadied the statue.
They walked out of the changing room, through the stadium to the outside. The public areas of the stadium were just as shabby. It desperately needed paint and repair. “Someone should just tear this shithole down and start over,” Harry said. “I think that would be easier than trying to fix it up.”
Draco cleared his throat, and Potter looked away, and suddenly it felt to Draco like the temperature in the room fell hard and fast.
Harry corrected quietly. “I had the daft ideas, but you made them happen. You publicized to get people here. You gave the team new equipment. New contracts. You’re the one who told them that no one was safe. Play or get traded.”
Draco brushed his fringe out of his eyes and stared at Harry is if he were speaking Parseltongue. “Potter, did we watch the same debacle? That man’s broom barely got off the ground. From the look of it, it was probably the same broom from 20 years ago. We’re just lucky
“Today’s our last day of filming,” Harry added. “We’re done here, but since the weather is nice, we’re going over to Malfoy Manor to take a few cuttings from the garden to transplant here.”
“Don’t worry. He’ll probably never be back,” Harry said, the scent of Malfoy’s cologne still light in the air.
With his eyes still closed, he patted the mattress next to him, looking for a knee or a hand, but the space is empty. The only thing that remains is an impression in the pillow and the tumbled blankets next to Draco. His heart broke, but he willed himself to hold the shards together.
I take a moment and pray I can walk the line between what he doesn’t know and what I don’t want him to know. For example, I am absolutely not revealing my feelings about him. I’ve nurtured this crush in secret, held it close to my chest so he’d never know.
When Harry went back down on him, Draco raked his fingers through Harry’s hair, pulled at the curls. That hair—he’d always wanted to touch it, twirl it around his fingers.  Draco felt the coil of orgasm, tightening, growing, until he knew he was too close. He pushed at Harry’s head, but Harry stayed, moved his hand in counterpoint to his mouth.
“Draco! Did you get it? I found the cure! Since we couldn’t leave, I spent the night in the hospital library reading Medieval spell books. Turns out, scabies was a big problem back then—”
“Alright.” Hermione piled her papers and shoved them in her bag. “But since we’re stuck here a few more days, maybe owl him. Sometimes it’s easier to write about our feelings than talk about them face to face.”
After dinner, which Draco was surprised was (a) not poisoned and (b) pretty good, he took his suitcase out of his trouser pocket and set it on the floor. Within seconds, it was regular size. “Time to find you a new room, Potter,” Draco said, wheeling his suitcase out of the kitchen, then levitating it up the stairs.
Draco shook his head. “Do you really not get it? He’s the famous Sixten Lundberg, saviour of Quidditch. You’re—you. The Great Harry Potter.  And I’m a Malfoy.”
He wasn’t flirting and apparating a bloke back to Grimmauld Place. Wanting everything and willing to beg for it.
Harry scanned the committee members, watched their response to Sixten’s eloquent words. Several nodded in agreement, which Harry thought was a good sign. He watched Sixten as he spoke; he seemed at ease in front of the committee in a way that Harry never would be. Harry would be shuffling, mumbling, avoiding eye contact, or he’d spend too much time with his back to someone. Sixten was a natural with a confident voice that invited people to agree with him.
Draco thought he heard a tinge of sadness in Harry’s voice. He grabbed Harry on the way to the bathroom and kissed him slowly. “We’ll cut filming short today. Promise.”
“Unless he just had sex with his best mate.” He felt bitterness and anger nipping at the edges of his sorrow. “Can you do the spell so I can get to work?”
Harry laughed as he watched Draco and wondered if he knew how Harry felt. That his heart slammed into his ribs and then dropped out of his chest completely, leaving Harry breathless and lightheaded. Or how his body betrayed him when they were together, leaving Harry wondering how blood could rush to his face and his dick at the same time. And why he, a generally intelligent adult, spoke like a teenager if he could speak at all when he first saw Draco.
Harry pushed him toward the Hogwarts team, and his heart didn’t skip a beat when Draco flipped him off.
“Doesn’t that hurt?” I force the words out, hoping focusing on Potter instead of dizziness will settle my head.
The Floo’s flames surged emerald green, and Sixten Lundberg emerged, impressive in his bespoke black robes that should have looked drab and instead made him look stately and elegant. And unfairly hot.
Because his mobile phone wouldn’t work inside most magical houses, there’d been no reason to bring his. But he hadn’t expected the initial meeting to last as long as it had.
He threw on clothes that were different from the day’s before but still were paint splattered and stained. “I’m going to make breakfast if you want some.”
He was alright, Harry thought. And if Malfoy were going to be his partner, at least him having an okay boyfriend was better than an arsehole boyfriend.
Harry thought Malfoy might be grinning, but he was sun-blind and couldn’t be sure. No way he was going to shield his eyes or show any weakness. He wouldn’t give Malfoy that satisfaction. If only he’d brought his sunglasses.
Hermione looked confused. “Harry said the same thing. With your weekly dates and all the time you spend together, I assumed he was lying.”
Potter’s breathing slowly evened out, and Draco knew he’d fallen asleep. He should get up and clean them off, or at least perform a cleansing spell. But his wand was on the floor and the loo was even further away. And maybe, in the morning, they could just clean up in the shower before getting dirty again.
The dark, dingy back meeting room had been transformed into a magical Winter Market, complete with (warm) snow and store fronts that offered different dinner fare or kitschy party keepsakes.
Sixten smiled again. “Really, no worries. If you want to talk about spills on contracts, Draco should tell you about the time we—”
Harry looked over, and to him, Draco seemed wistful. Sad. Not his face, which showed no emotion, but his shoulders had dropped, and he’d shoved his hands a little deeper into his coat pockets.
Harry struggled to remember. Draco silenced the heart rate monitor which alarmed as his heart beat faster.
“20 million you say? I’ll do it! Yes, of course. I’ll do it.” Mr. Dimplethwait marched over to Harry and grabbed his hand to shake on the deal. “Best wishes, dear boy. Hopefully, the Cannons will be as lucrative for you as it has been for me.”
But Harry was asleep. Draco turned down the lights and opened the door to leave. The hallway windows looked out onto the snowy street.
Draco folded his dirty clothes. Put them in a stack on one of the bedroom chairs. Moved them into his suitcase. Turned down the sheets on the bed. Thought that was suggestive, so pulled them back up on Potter’s side. Climbed into bed. Got out of bed. Moved his dirty clothes back to the chair so they wouldn’t smudge the clean ones. Got back into bed and rolled on his right side so he was on the edge of the mattress, leaving a bro-space between where they’d each sleep.
Draco spoke to the camera. “I can really feel the Dark Magic in this room. It feels—cold, wet, slimy. It sits in my stomach like dread and what I really want to do right now is run.” He struggles to smile and adds, “But that would make for bad telly, right?”
“Merlin help us. What have we gotten in to?” Draco sighed melodramatically and crawled toward another set of papers.
Harry pulled his coat tighter and cursed himself for forgetting his gloves. It was a short walk from the apparation point to the stadium, but the sharp, cold wind bit into him. In front of him, the stadium was silent and stately, with its new paint and renovations. The garish orange was replaced by a dignified white; the only orange on the exterior was in what Harry thought were tasteful accents, like the logo. The ticket booths had been reconstructed, including heating and cooling charms to go along with the rest of the stadium.
“Nice guess, but I doubt it’s much past noon.Wanna bet?” Harry checked the time on his phone and saw he had 10 text messages and one missed call. “Fuck! I have to call Dylan and let him know what’s up.” His stomach lurched at the thought of the fuss Dyl would make. Drama. Always so much drama with him.
She had noticed the conflict at the Yule Ball, had observed the Lady Blackwood when her henchman had tried to entice Lucius. So she was scared. The Aurors had to prioritise, spreading themselves too thin would accomplish nothing. But they were neglecting Draco entirely. What if that cost her baby his life?
Surprised by the unexpected insightfulness, the Harry Potter of Hogwarts had hardly been that empathetic, Severus wanted to know. "What makes you think that?"
Reluctantly, he followed her request. Severus knew that she would refuse to discuss this topic further if he proved himself too stubborn.
Whipping around, banging his bottle on Harry’s desk, spraying the surface in the process, Neville accused him, “Then why do you act like you’re alone out there? I know that I am not Ron or Hermione, but I thought you trusted me! You accepted me as your partner, so I thought … I thought you trusted me …” He repeated dejectedly, voice growing softer with every word.
"What?" Her husband defended himself. "I know you've explained it to me, but I still think it looks like a blob. How anybody can make out if it's a boy or a girl is beyond me."
Once they were more or less finished, the witch wanted to know, "By the way, will Lucius be back at the office tomorrow? I missed him today."
Grinning, Harry nodded, "So, I did," before rising to pull Draco into a hug. For a moment, he felt uncertain when the blond clung to him for dear life. But as he held on just as tight, both relaxed. Draco's face was buried in Harry's shoulder, muffling his words, as he mumbled, "I'm sorry that you had to witness the negations with Astoria. I promise we will find another way than her living here."
Draco gave Teddy a look that clearly said 'Told you so.' and received a small smile in return. "Who handled her case?"
"No! You are here - like all the other little up starters before you - to steal his treasures! Because if you were here with Severus' approval, you would know where to look for the entrance."
" … better safe than sorry." The young wizard finished. "Trouble usually finds me and - by proxy - those closest to me. Lucius has his cane. Draco does not go out alone and Narcissa … I would never forgive myself if she were not sufficiently protected."
Kissing the snitch, Harry watched it open and let the stone fall into his hand. He expected to feel dread, fear, maybe longing, but there was only gratitude. George meanwhile had barged on, " Dumbledore's wand was powerful because its owner was a powerful wizard. But the Resurrection Stone … that's madness! Please, Harry, you have to see that!"
"Of course," Lucius smiled ever so slightly. He remembered how short-tempered pregnant witches could be.
Dissatisfied, the wizard glared at his former student. "Surely, in five … years, you could … have tough … taught him … better."
His faint reply was drowned by the motherly redhead, berating Harry on his mealtime habits and within moments, the four sat at the kitchen table, to snack on cucumber-sandwiches and tea.
"Why is Ruby sobbing?" Stabilising them both, the brunet listened with rapt attention as Harry shared Kreacher's insight. "We are idiots. We have used him often enough on assignments, and now … doesn't matter. Let's get back to Grimmauld Place and talk this through."
"Great." Looking up at his friends, especially at Hermione who nodded encouragingly, Harry demanded, "Now I want you to tell me what the fuck is going on! Something happened the day of my accident, and I want to know what is wrong with you!"
Yet Severus merely raised his hand. "We have agreed on a rent of 50 gallons per week. Considering you have had me transfer to your home within the week after the battle, and March nearly being at an end, I owe you rent for 290 weeks in total."
Beside him, Hermione traded Teddy's training-wand with her own. "It's vine wood with a dragon heartstring. Very attuned to emotions. If you want this spell to work, my wand will make it come true."
Slowly, Harry turned towards Lady Blackwood, wand at the ready, "Where is the entrance to the basement?"
"As if I would," the potioneer mumbled, handing over a few shells, "Grind these to a fine powder, while I cut up the meat."
