"Yeah, you told me
Draco chuckles. "Well, I’m not sure Penne really goes that well with tea." He stays standing close, hedging Harry in against the counter and the open cupboard door. He smells lovely. This close up, Harry can breathe in a deep lungful―woodsy cologne and green apple shampoo―and can see the spots on Draco’s cheekbones and tip of his nose where he’s caught a bit of sun.
In a burst of inspiration, that may or may not actually be a burst of anxiety, Harry quickly fires off a,
Potter rucks up Draco's top slightly, then kisses him low on his stomach. His hair tickles at Draco's belly as he nods, belatedly agreeing with Draco's statement as if dropping to the floor wasn't a clear enough statement of intentions. "I want to do this," he states breathlessly, fingers at the fly of Draco's jeans. "Good?"
His dramatic exit earlier was worth it, but it does mean he’s had almost an entire evening to kill on his own since. Figuratively, of course; Draco’s murdered nothing, except the three sheets of paper he shredded while puzzling over what Potter could be looking for. Is he hooked on some mysterious drug, or searching for it? Has he lost a lover? Is he looking for one? Draco pushed that thought away rather quickly, but still. He's been restless and excited, almost agitated, and still is. The rain is refreshing, the cigarette calming his nerves, or acting as placebo for it at least. It's not as if it's going to kill him, anyway.
“Can you... feel me? What I feel, that is,” Harry replies, tucking his free arm around his middle. His other hand sits casually outstretched between, as if he’s holding an invisible teacup. Understanding blooms across Draco’s face, but the moment stretches on long past the time Harry would have expected him to reply.
"Isn’t that, like. Failing?" he asks, his voice thicker than he would like it to be.
"You want me to
Draco’s eyes flashed as he grinned, then pulled Harry towards him by the hem of his top. “Oh look at that, I’ve suddenly recovered.”
“Wow. That was amazingly soppy, Draco.”
"Mmm," he agrees, nodding his head lazily. He needs a nap, a long lie down. And then more of this. Days of this, and just for starters. He can feel himself smiling, tired and dopey. He thinks that of all the things he wants, he might actually get them.
This year, all Draco wants is a good night’s sleep, a reprieve from the low ache of self loathing that’s settled deep in the pit of his gut ― and for Harry not to turn around, see him, and start a fight. It would have been warranted, but Draco had no fight left in him. He didn't want Harry to find that out, for some reason.
"It is a bit of a shithole, I guess," Potter belatedly agrees with him, peering around. There’s a bar at the far left of the room, across a dance floor that’s seen better days but probably not seen better patrons. On the other side of the room there are a series of doorways covered by faded velvet curtains. Draco fights the urge to roll his eyes. It’s tacky, and it’s making his skin crawl.
? Draco struggles with that for another moment, as well as how arousing he finds it. It makes Potter no less saintly or heroic in his mind, rather renders him worryingly even more attractive.
"What?" Potter scoffs, leaning forward now too. His fringe falls into his eyes and he shakes it away in annoyance. "How am I supposed to do that?"
"I did," Draco affirms. "Every word of it."
“Sleep well?” Draco asks, gesturing at the display of food before them and signaling for Harry to help himself. Harry smiles his thanks, then runs his hand over his hair. It’s already almost completely dry; there's only about a centimeter of it at the moment, just enough to suggest the tangled curls that threaten to burst back if Harry will let them, and it dries quickly.
Draco takes a moment to consider. Potter's hand is warm against Draco's chest through his t-shirt. There's desire in his eyes and colour on his cheeks. He's exactly as alluring to Draco as he ever was, the boy who rejected his friendship, the teenager who constantly challenged him, the hero who saved his skin from ravenous Fiendfyre. And now, this man standing in front of Draco, shrouded in secrecy and hiding from the world but offering something of himself to Draco, and only to him―his company, his interest, a glimpse into his secluded world. If this is it for them, the only night they spend together before Potter disappears once more, then Draco wants this. He can be whatever Potter needs tonight; he's glad to be. It's more than Draco ever thought he would get, more than he’d dared dream of. He'll take it in both hands, and with the surests of grips.
Draco's handwriting is neat and loopy.
"Thank you, Draco." Potter’s voice is heavy and tired, the words sleep-slurred. It takes Draco aback, the same way Potter saying he trusted Draco did. He’s not sure what the thank you is for, or exactly how Potter means it. It could be for trying to help him, for finding Darya, for listening to Potter’s story. It could be for as little as letting him sleep in his bed tonight. It doesn’t matter to Draco, really. Having Potter’s gratitude hits him hard, burrowing a home between his ribs. It’s another of those things, like having Potter’s touch, his friendship, his confidence, that Draco never imagined he would ever have freely given to him. It feels valuable beyond compare.
"Nothing, Malfoy." Potter's voice is heavy, and resigned. "She knew nothing. This was as useless as…" He breaks off and swallows thickly. Draco stares at his throat, watches his Adam's apple bob. There's a hectic colour on Potter's face, a flush coming from his chest to his neck and higher. It's the kind that happens to Draco when he's trying not to cry. Draco's chest suddenly aches.
Harry breathes a sigh of relief.
“Making us go through the motions, you mean,” Harry gripes. He wrangles his thermos flask out from between his knees, and gulps down a warm mouthful. He looks at Draco, then taps the top of Draco’s flask with his index finger pointedly.
It takes Harry fully half a day to realise that he's done something stupid.
“Oh.” Harry licked his lips, tilting his head to better let Draco kiss over the line of his neck. “Guess we’ll….need a bigger house, then?” Harry muttered, closing his eyes as Draco kissed over his neck. He felt goosebumps shiver over his skin as Draco laughed, his soft breath puffing over his collarbone.
, plus Hermione does have a point; Harry’s not really good at stopping, it seems, at standing still or letting himself have breaks. He’s a time-filler, a silence-avoider. His first novel―published under a pseudonym―was a roaring success, his second was too, but also came with his identity being properly rumbled. His third novel seemed like it would be a breeze, but the pressure seems to be mounting and Harry suspects he just…doesn’t want to write it. At all. He doesn’t like to think he’s been throwing himself into writing in order to procrastinate from getting on with his life, but he doesn’t want to outright lie to himself either. So he ends up just stood there in front of the mirror in his weird cottage-escape hideout, toothpaste foam around his mouth, in need of a shave, and as stuck as he ever was.
“God.” Harry nodded, letting Draco ease his underwear down. The curve of his stomach pressed against the flat of Draco’s as Draco kissed him. “You have training tomorrow,” Harry said breathily against Draco’s lips. He rolled his hips again, felt Draco press the flat of his palm against the damp material at the head of Harry’s cock.
"Yeah," he replies, voice rough as he brings both hands to cup Harry's head and tilt it back before he leans down, pressing his lips to Harry's.
Harry frowns. "Yeah, I―"
“Harry, you’re not.” Draco lifted one leg until Harry was straddling him. “Ego? Enormous.” Draco slid down the bed as Harry braced one hand on the headboard. “Cock?” Draco licked along the base of Harry’s prick, and Harry suppressed a moan. “Largish, I’ll grant you that.” He grinned, hands on Harry’s thighs and urging him up to his knees. “Now, up.” He pushed Harry up towards his face and Harry went easily, both hands now gripping the headboard as Draco settled underneath him and between his legs.
The answer was no, which Draco had felt the need to deliver via equally panicked lecture to Harry regarding the safety of the gestating child, adding that maybe Harry should take the offered time off work and, well, gestate somewhere a little less exciting. This in turn had made Harry roaringly angry, because he couldn’t just not do his job and it wasn’t like he did it on purpose, or like he was going to be dangling the baby over a vat of the stuff,
, and b) that he possibly had a bit of baggage from the war. He’d begrudgingly sought counselling, which was Ron’s idea of — all bloody people —but it had helped Harry, even if talking about how he felt was a ball ache he could have lived without. Well, or not; Harry would happily prattle on to a series of counselors about his weird dreams and messy childhood if it meant he didn’t fuck things up with Draco. Draco was just as willing to do the same. Seven years on, and they were still great at pissing each other off but really,
“Very well. First, how long it will last,” the Healer states. “As I mentioned, these bonds do not happen often. They will fade on their own, usually within six to eight months ―”
Potter’s lips are soft, and his mouth tastes like mint. It’s the same spell Draco uses for his teeth in the evening, the familiar taste strange when it’s on the other end of a kiss. Potter is eager and subdued at the same time, kissing Draco back with a pace so much slower than the frenzied rush that hit them earlier in the club. It’s no less heady, though. They kiss lazily, for long, slow moments as things heat up between them. The build of pleasure in Draco’s gut as he presses up against Potter’s lean body is maddening, made all the more sharp for the slow way they move. It’s tantalising and comforting in a way, taking their time to bring each other to the edge. Draco feels his cock thickening with each grind against Potter, the corresponding hardness he feels between Potters legs spurring him on. Potter sucks on Draco's tongue, on his lower lip. He rolls their hips together, creating as dirty a rhythm as the one in the club, but which feels infinitely filthier in the quiet, dark intimacy of Draco's bed.
Potter doesn't say anything back. The rain plasters his hair to his forehead, a dark tangle above his glasses, before he pulls out the folder. He holds it out towards Draco.
Draco turns his head, running on instinct rather than sense. His nose brushes Potter's cheek, over the faintest of stubble there. Potter's breathing remains even, but deliberately so. The air feels tight around them, thrumming with the vibrations of the music and the tension strung taut between their bodies. Draco feels almost woozy from it, drunk on stimulation. Potter's eyes appear fixated on Draco's lips. Draco licks them, opening his mouth to finally speak.
Draco shrugs, even though he feels far from casual. "Of course. I said I would help, and I did. I found Darya. I can find more. If you want me to, that is." He clears his throat, leaning forward and resting his elbows on his knees. "I can also fuck off and leave it alone."
?” Draco asks in lieu of properly responding. Standing in front of Harry now, he’s almost close enough for Harry to touch him with his outstretched hand, to brush his fingers across his chest and the soft wool of his shirt.
“I know,” Draco responds. He looks down at Harry's stomach, then places his palm against Harry's belly, just above where the sheets cover his lap. Harry revels in the warmth of it. “I would have said it sooner, you know. Done this sooner,” Draco says quietly. “Before last night. Before the comet. I was never sure, though, if you wanted that.” His fingers trace a light pattern against Harry's bare skin.
―to find answers for him, a resolution as best they can. He deserves that, and Draco knows that he can help.
Anxiety seeps through Draco, a tangible force moving with sluggish purpose through his tight veins.
Draco nods, quick and self-assured, as he pushes Potter the rest of the way in and locks the door behind them. Potter's smile is vibrant and giddy before he's on Draco, kissing him with renewed verve. Draco feels giddy himself, letting his hands roam under Potter's top and over his skin now that they have a semblance of privacy. They don't, not really; they're still in public. It's quieter in here, though. Draco can hear the gasps Potter makes when Draco presses his thigh against his groin, can catch the hitch of his breaths when Draco sucks on his lower lip.
Despite all this precedent, though, the year that Draco turns nineteen there are three things which really stand out as vying for first prize in the ‘Shit on Draco Malfoy’ Olympics:
"Do you want to bite me?" Potter asks, and Draco's hips stutter. He recovers quickly, fucking down against Potter's stiff cock through the soft material of their night clothes. "You can, if you want."
"I don’t think I do that." Harry swallows, resisting the urge to get defensive. "Do I?" he asks faintly, after a moment’s pause. He wants to listen to Ginny, even though he also really doesn’t want to. He wishes another drink would magically appear in front of him.
“Yes, obviously.” Draco crossed one ankle over the other, folding his arms as he leaned back against the kitchen counter. “But I’m not really sure this,” he waved one hand at the two vials of potion Harry had procured from the Healers and left on the kitchen table, “is the best way to approach resolving the issue of parenthood.”
Draco doesn’t look entirely convinced, but he nods, a smile lingering on his lips. Harry wants to kiss him again, so he does, soft at first and then slipping into something deeper. His fingers press at the nape of Draco’s neck, keeping him close, as Draco slips one of his own hands up the back of Harry’s shirt. Harry stifles a moan, shuffling closer until his chest is pressed against Draco’s, the heat from his body slipping over onto Harry’s. Harry angles his groin away, his cock chubbing up in his pants, not quite enough to be obvious but getting there. He means to keep his kisses light, and sweet, but he’s waited so long and his self-control has never been amazing. He wants to eat Draco whole, right now. But still, he makes himself stop.
Long minutes passed as Draco tried to figure out whether Harry knew he was there, if he ought to say something, or if he should just turn around and leave. He didn’t want to do the latter; he couldn't sleep, and this was his spot. But now, it was Potter’s spot too, and Draco, overtired and surprised, didn’t know what to do with this new information.
"Do you feel that?" Harry gasps again, his hips shifting again against the bed. His cock is hard and full between his legs, tenting out his joggers.
He looks up at Harry, kissing him again deeply before he drops to his knees.
Perhaps it's nice knowing that an animal Draco adores, adores Harry in return.
“Think of it like two balls of entwined yarn, Mr Potter, if that helps.”
Draco rests his hands over the tops of Harry’s thighs, then lays his cheek against it, watching Harry back with the same tired, fond expression Harry’s sure is on his own face. The lamplight casts shadows in the dips of Draco’s cheeks, under his collarbone and ribs. It should be haunting, perhaps, but his face looks so deeply satisfied, so calm. Harry can’t look away.
The aftermath being, one of them would be pregnant. It would definitely be more proactive than spending another night staring at their pros and cons chart and being aggressively supportive of each other.
Harry really doesn’t, in any way shape or form.
Draco stops in front of him, right between Harry's parted legs. Harry's thighs strain slightly, tension thick through his muscles. He curls his fingers into loose fists, his face tilted up meet Draco's eyes. The air between them feels charged, electric. It isn't magic, Harry knows this. It's just
"This was as useless as everything else I've done. Everyone else I've spoken to," Potter says into the night air, as if Draco isn't there, or more accurately, as if Draco hearing it doesn't matter anyway. Draco isn't sure if he's flattered or bothered by this. It means he's either insignificant, or Potter's comfortable with him.
"So what about…" Ginny later asks, after about Bellini number three and with her eggs Benedict thoroughly demolished. She tilts her head thoughtfully, elbow on the table and feet on the chair opposite her. "Tina?"
There is a plus side to being the son of a Death Eater, and a newly turned Dark creature himself. He’s both seen and invisible at the same time. As a social pariah, he can get around quite well in the seedier parts of the wizarding world. The ones who do recognise him don't want anything to do with him, and the ones who don't know him just… don't give a shit. It suits Draco quite well.
He thought after last year that he couldn’t hate feel any lower about himself, but as always he was wrong.
some of these parties were boring, and exchanged ParchText addresses so that Draco could make sure Harry was at Miss Eventide’s book launch next month. On the surface Draco said it was because it was a good networking opportunity, but really it was so he had someone suitable to bitch about it with now that Astoria was out of the country and taking their son to meet her grandparents in France.
No, Potter is not here because he’s a vampire. So he must be something else, Draco reasons. Or he’s a hunter and he’s here to off them all. There are people like that around, who hate the so-called darker creatures of the world, want to see them all burn. If Potter is here for that, though, then he’s done an astounding job by even getting in the door. Even finding out where The Opal is, for that matter, let alone gaining enough trust to sit there calmly enjoying a pint.
Potter chooses the club, and Draco doesn't argue. There's a fever bubbling beneath Potter's skin, Draco can tell. He's been in Potter’s shoes before, when the sudden feeling of the rug being swept out from under previously sturdy and hopeful feet, leaves one reeling. At least he thinks this is how Potter is feeling. Potter hasn't divulged what happened, or what
nightmare." Potter laughs, wry and a little helpless. "And for once, I wasn’t having them. Not once." He rubs his hand over his mouth again.
"I’ve Hobnobs around here somewhere," Harry goes on, filling up the tense air with jabber and the sound of opening cupboards. "Or Digestives maybe, but the shit ones, with no chocolate."
After a light, tension-filled supper, Harry excuses himself to have a breather upstairs. Draco hasn't made any more pointed remarks about things he can feel from Harry, and Harry hasn't felt anything in return―beyond Draco’s jealousy which he's quite certain Draco would not find being made aware of very sexy at all. Quite the opposite, Harry feels sure.
"Okay." Potter nods. "I've heard you. So." Potter smiles wryly. "I guess we do this, and just try not to kill each other then, yeah?"
Potter comes out of the small ensuite bathroom in a burst of warmth and dissipating steam. There’s a towel slung low on his waist, water droplets on his shoulders from his dripping hair. He’s tried to dry it, but it’s thick and still holding water. Draco considers not staring at his bare chest for a brief moment, then casts the thought away. He won’t ogle, he’s better than that, and besides. Potter’s had his cock down his throat; they’re past pretending they aren’t attracted to each other.
“Wanna fuck me?”
Harry nearly chokes on his toothbrush as he reads it. His mouth feels like something’s fermented in it, and he wants a new tongue, and he’s laughing so hard he almost gags. It’s far too early for Draco to be hilarious.
Harry kicks his legs out petulantly, banging his ankle on the window before slouching off to his typewriter.
“Oh, fuck.” Draco relaxed against the sheets, one heel running over Harry’s back as Harry ran his lips and then his tongue around Draco’s hole. Harry did it again, felt a shiver of arousal run through him as he felt the muscles in Draco’s arse and legs tensing, felt Draco’s hands curling into his hair and pulling his face closer to his body. “Jesus, Harry,” he muttered.
Draco’s quiet for a long moment while he gathers his thoughts. There’s so much to take in, to unpack here, that he feels almost numbed by it. None of this makes sense in regards to what he previously understood as possible. He focuses on the words being exchanged at hand, and not on the broader questions building inside him.
“I’m due for a tidy up, actually,” he replies, watching Draco reach into the jar of liver treats he keeps for Nettle. In his periphery, Harry can see her ears perk up at the prospect of food. He pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose, before turning so he can properly watch Draco.
"Wellllll." He pokes the papers to his left. "No? I mean, I’ve written nothing on The Four Sisters, but I did, um. Write a bit about a cat. Which, y’know. Wasn’t actually that bad."
His dreams are strange.
Draco laughs in a gust of wry exhaustion. “Well, you know they exist, and you seem to understand the situation well enough, so surely you know when these things are going to go off?”
Draco pauses, having just slipped his fingers under the hem. His hair is tousled, a damp mess across his sweaty forehead. His cheeks are flushed, the pupils of his grey eyes blown large, almost eclipsing the irises. He's never looked more desirable to Harry, his chest heaving and his brow furrowed in confusion, and yet none of these feelings are new to Harry. He's old friends with this want, had it for company for a while now. He's suddenly desperate to know how it is for Draco, too. If this all he'll get, one night of experimentation for Draco, perhaps, of toying with the way the bond makes them feel, then Harry will take it. He'll take it with both hands, and treasure it. But he knows what he would prefer.
He’s not been recognised once here, anyway. The infamy of the Malfoys and their role in the War hasn’t really extended outside of the UK, and fair enough. Draco wouldn't expect wizarding communities in the Czech Republic to have really given much of a toss about him or his family. They’ve had their own political nightmares to navigate, corrupt officials and those who were in Voldemort’s pockets. Lucius Malfoy is hardly unique in being a seedy political climber. Draco would have happily followed in his father’s footsteps if he hadn’t had a wakeup call in the form of… well, developing a moral compass. Small mercies.
him to see and give due diligence. Draco’s already filled three pages of his own notebook with ideas about where to start, when he forces himself to stop and put it aside.
“Oh, good. That’s nice of you,” Draco says. Harry honestly can't tell if he's being sincere or snarky at this stage.
as he spurted over his fist, pulse after pulse of warm washing over his fingers, onto the pillow before him, and he swayed, dizzy and overstimulated. Draco licked at him again, mouth opening wide as he exhaled in a warm rush, hips lifting off the bed as he came himself. Harry leant his head against his outstretched arm, catching his breath and letting the warm post-orgasm lethargy overtake him, as Draco’s breathing slowly came back to something slightly more normal.
"Hi," Potter says, after another slow minute of staring each other down ticks by.
"Merlin," Draco mutters, not bothering to hide his disdain as he scans the room. The decor is old, and not in a vintage way. It's decrepit. There's a cloying smell of old alcohol spilled on infrequently cleaned floors and musky fabrics, of decay and too-sweet incense burnt to try and cover it up. It smells like a badly kept funeral parlour. Draco half expects to see bouquets of dying roses hanging on the walls. The music is too loud, rattling the aged speakers as they do their best to blast the cacophonic sounds over a crowd of listless dancers. At the edge of the crowd, Draco thinks he senses a fellow vampire, but the barrage of sensory information is dulling his ability to tell. There's too much to take in here, in this fetid and too-hot room. Draco can't tell who is human and who is creature, who might be deadly predator and who is just here to drink and be prey.
“Not with me, you don't.” Draco bends to kiss the corner of Harry's mouth, the faintest press of his lips. Harry sighs into it, curling his hand around the back of Draco's head to bring him closer.
It feels like he's coming forever, the way all truly good orgasms do―and not at all how a quick morning wank usually feels. Harry gasps, working himself through it and looking down at his hand as he wrings the last of his orgasm out of himself. He struggles to catch his breath for a moment, shower spray beating against his back and come swirling down the drain. He leans his forehead against the hand pressed against the wall to give himself a moment to recover, and to wonder how hard up for it he must have been for it to have felt like
It really doesn’t, but Harry isn’t inclined to push it right now; it’s late, and everyone is already in a rotten mood. The three of them lapse into silence, the Healer content in his explanations and Draco and Harry mulling over their differing levels of nonplussed confusion.
Potter blinks at him. "Together?"
Potter nods as if in agreement. "You’re probably right. I don’t think many people know what Voldemort had done. I doubt he trusted many with that secret." Potter pulls out his wand, having wisely decided not to bother with jumping the fence, and mutters an
But Harry was coping okay with being a twenty eight year old pregnant elephant. What he was finding distinctly unexpected and infuriating was that he was so fucking
There's only one person it can be. Aneta solely contacts him via correspondence, and their meetings have all been at her residence. She hasn’t come to his place, and has no reason to. Besides her, Draco doesn’t know anyone else in this city, or even this country, who would have cause or desire to visit him.
“Wonderful, Harry,” Draco says quietly, turning his cup in his saucer. His breakfast sits abandoned in front of him as he looks into the milky brown liquid, his eyes smiling and teeth pulling at his lower lip. Anticipation settles heavily around them.
When the door clicks shut, he shuts his eyes, then picks up the pyjama top Draco left him and pulls it back over his face. Muffled, he groans into it as loudly as he dares, letting the excited frustration tumble over his lips. He has no idea what just happened, but it was something significant, Harry decides as he sits up, quickly pulling the buttons of his shirt through their holes and peeling it off. He slips on the cream-coloured henley top Draco left him, followed by the soft pyjama trousers, and flings the corner of the duvet back with more force than is necessary. He all but falls into the bed face first, catching himself on his elbows at the last minute to save himself from landing on his glasses. He pops those off and folds them carefully, then sets them on the bedside table. With a click, he flicks the lamp off and plunges the room into welcome darkness.
The figures watches him all day, scoping him out, searching. Draco stays in that place that feels like it exists between waking and dreaming, lucid enough to know what’s going on but still unable to move. Neither he nor the figure move for hours and hours.
"So," Draco starts, voice low but loud enough to be heard. Potter leans closer anyway, almost swaying into Draco as if pulled into his orbit. Draco feels their inevitable crash together growing even more imminent. "Are you planning to tell me what upset you back there?"
"And you love me, even though we made a terrible couple."
“Fuck,” Harry shut his eyes, mouth falling open as he felt the warm, wet slide of Draco’s mouth, his tongue, against his hole. He sighed at the pleasure of it, the low build of warmth in his belly as Draco’s lips locked over him, mouth moving in a semblance of a kiss. Harry’s knees smoothed along the bedsheets as he spread his legs wider, pressing himself harder against Draco's face.
Harry scowls. Malfoy has a point, actually, not that Harry’s thrilled that Draco is currently ensconced in a big creepy death mansion full of lizards.
for fuck’s sake.
He felt stupid, he thought. Stupid, and huge, and turned on. He suddenly missed his old body, as he listened to Draco stir, or at least Harry missed what his body used to do. It had been far less unpredictable; other than the odd bout of food poisoning, some achy joints, a few weird reactions to cheese, Harry felt like his body had become pretty reliable since Hogwarts. At the moment he felt like he didn’t know what his body was going to throw at him next.
Potter's face creases in concern, and Draco wants to wave it off, to make a joke, but he forces himself not to. He wants this to land, what he's saying here. "My point is," Draco goes on, "that you might be dangerous. And I
having a breakdown. Or at least, whatever he took Ron to mean by that. The clash of who Harry had been all his life and what he’d lived with, and who he wanted to be now, was weighing on him in ways he didn’t know how to handle. He’d heard once that some soldiers, after their wars had been fought and won, found it harder to live during peacetime. Harry wondered if that was what he was going through.
. It sounds accusatory, like Draco fucked up, when he really didn't. Harry just doesn't want to make it happen again by Gryffindoring into a situation, if it can be avoided. Especially if all it takes is getting his lower half under control.
“Boring.”
He wasn’t sure if it was the bottle of champagne he’d drunk, the risk of getting caught, or if it was potentially even a mild concussion, but it was still up there as one of the best shags of Harry’s life. The sex had again been bloody fantastic the next time they hooked up, in the garden of a fundraising gala for Hogwarts students who couldn't afford their own instruments or something. Harry couldn't remember, he only went because Hermione had dragged him there, and to be honest because he heard the Malfoys were going and he was hoping to cop a snog with Draco behind the hydrangeas. Anyway, he could be forgiven for forgetting about whether little Timmy the second year was going to get a trumpet or not when Draco had three fingers in his arse and Harry’s cock down his throat. Harry was often likely to forget his own name or how his legs worked when Draco did that.
“Hi,” he mutters. His pulse feels like it’s thundering in his throat, but his voice steady.
"You might need to relax." Draco shuffles forward on his knees, kissing the base of Harry's cock again.
Harry bursts into a hysterical laugh. "God." He rubs at his eyes, pushing his glasses up into his hair. He leaves his hands over his face. "Yeah, I’ve been meaning to buy a new one," he mumbles through his fingers.
“Thanks,” Draco croaks. He’s not sure if he means the hand around his wrist, or the bottle of Murtlap Essence.
Potter nods, letting Draco lead the way. He takes the towels Draco gives him, shrugging off his outer layers. He hasn’t spoken much since they left the park. Draco feels almost reluctant to leave him after the conversation they’ve had and the experiences they’ve shared. He forces himself to exit the room and leave Potter to himself.
When Harry comes it’s with a mouthful of Draco’s hair in his gob, his hand fisted in the back of Draco’s shirt and his toes curling hard in his shoes. He gasps, spurting over Draco’s hip and the base of his shirt, making a mess between them. Draco follows soon after with a gut-punched grunt, his mouth open in an almost-bite against Harry's shoulder as he pumps his hips against Harry’s hot skin.
?” Harry blurts, shocked.
Contrary to their prior kiss in the heave of the club, when Potter presses his lips to Draco’s this time it
is right up there, too. His father’s never hit him before, and Draco’ll be damned if he hangs around to see if someday Lucius actually will. Draco’s a coward, but he’s also proud, and it seems his pride will trump a roof over his head. Maybe leaving
"Sorry," Draco places an apologetic kiss at Harry's perineum. "Cleaning charm's are always so invasive."
, Harry writes back once he’s minty and dressed and feeling marginally human again.
Harry’s breath catches in his throat. “Oh.” He licks his lips, teacup raised half way to his mouth. “I. Um.” His eyes flit over Draco’s face, lingering at the cupid’s bow of his lips and the tilt of his smile, the narrowed interest in his eyes. His mind is racing, his pulse a rabbit flutter. “Let me know if it...happens again,” he says, before he’s even really made sense of what’s going on here. He just knows he needs to say something, to poke at this and see what happens. He feels like he’s unravelling a tapestry, pulling at a thread he’s been trying to get at for months and finally watching it come loose in a glorious shower of colour.
"Can I say something?" Ginny takes her legs off the chair and places them on the floor so she can rest her arms on the table and give Harry her full attention.
Ginny squeezes his arm again. "You’ve been through hell. I think you’re just really used to…sort of sucking it up, and making the best out of being a mushroom. You know, growing in the dark, making the best of living in shit," Ginny elaborates when Harry stares at her with, frankly warranted, confusion.
He leaves his thumb hovering over the send button, then lets the screen go dark instead.
At least she’s miserable somewhere warm, Draco thinks, mildly resentful. He shakes his head to cast the thought away, watching the stupid swing of his flop of hair. He forces a smile. He’ll laugh at himself these days, if there’s no one else here to.
Harry burrows sleepily into the mattress, stubble scratching against the pillow and limbs warm and lazy. The neck of his borrowed top is loose and open, and the room is dimly lit by the sun; the thick curtain block most of it out, charmed no doubt to give Draco's guests the optimal amount of a lie in. Raised to be ever the gracious host, is little lord Malfoy. Harry rubs his forehead against the pillow, a rhythmic back and forth as he tries to decide if he'll get up now or try and catch a bit more sleep.
unlikeable.
"Oh god." Harry opens his mouth, trying to think of something else to say, but in the end he just abruptly stands up. "Biscuit?" he says, heading for the nearest cupboard. If they’re doing this, he needs something to shove in his face.
Draco huffs out a silent laugh, then rubs at his eye with two fingers of his left hand. Like that, the tension between them breaks, the trickle of feeling creeping up Harry’s spine down from his nape is gone. It’s all him now. He likes that he can tell that; it confirms even more so that there was something there that wasn’t coming from him before.
Draco twists his mouth, then stands away from the wall, straightening up to his full height. Now, they’re almost eye to eye, Draco’s inch or so of extra height giving him only a small advantage. Harry feels a shiver run through him all the same.
"When Voldemort tried to kill me the first time," Potter says, in that same hollow tone, "and my mother saved me, the Killing Curse backfired on him. You know that part. He didn’t die, as you also know. What no one realised, not even him for the longest time, was that in the process, when he was blasted apart, a shard of his shattered soul… found something in the room to make a Horcrux out of." Potter stares forward, his mouth twisting in deep distaste. "Like some kind of leech, looking for a host." Potter steers them towards a wooden park bench, just to the side of the gravel path. There’s a statue across from them in an open area of the park, set with a carefully designed garden bed. The plants look lush and healthy.
to people. The best bet that anyone has come up with is that the space where the, the"—Potter gestures vaguely at his own chest—"where the Horcrux was, that it carved away a piece of my
The club is down a back street, away from any main roads or bustling pedestrian areas. Outside, people are sparse; there's a man smoking next to the doorway, and a couple who appear to be having a fight a little further down. One of them might be crying, their gestures turning more and more animated as their partner scowls down at the pavement, arms crossed. Looking around, Draco sees Potter pacing near the alleyway Draco was waiting at when they first arrived.
It’s refreshing at least, to be certain about something and to have it resonate within him without any inkling of doubt. Maybe this is how it feels to believe in something rather than to simply saying he did because there was a snake hissing at hisheels. Draco doesn’t have much experience with the difference between choosing to do something, and being told to, but he thinks this might be the former. That’s one thing about this year that Draco thinks he feels okay about.
Draco weaves in and out of the scant crowds, watching his feet as he heads towards The Opal Cauldron. He knows it’s nearby, and for all that his date was a bust, he’s due a celebration. He’s wrapped up this case, or as good as wrapped it up. He’s just waiting to be paid, and to have confirmation that Aneta is satisfied Draco has proved her husband is not only cheating but also fabulously bankrupting them on a Doxy-smuggling scheme that is going to go absolutely tits-up any day now. Which Draco
One day, Draco thinks as he sits next to Harry with a short smile, he’ll get around to asking him what’s become of his old wand. It’s funny that Draco has ended up seeing Harry most nights and yet he’s never brought this up. Maybe he never will; it’s miraculous enough that they spend any time around each other, and they don’t talk much. Draco isn’t sure what Harry’s doing out here, why he keeps creeping out of the castle too. It’s not spitting
“Y’r up.” Draco rubbed one eye.
Draco’s father has never hit him before, never raised his voice. Lucius has been subdued since the war ended, since his side lost and crumbled. Draco had never entertained the idea that there would be a closeness between them after the war, but he never anticipated the seething resentment his father apparently festered towards Draco, either. Draco’s no saint, but his father has done much worse. This is simple fact, and one that must have been eating a hole in Draco’s father’s heart for some time considering the strength with which his fist hit the wall beside Draco’s head.
attention. He's settled for negative over the years, but to solve a problem for Potter? Draco’s alive with the desire to come through on this.
Draco wrinkles his nose. "Yeah. I may have…panicked a bit." He sucks his lip into his mouth, worrying it with his teeth before releasing it again, shiny with spit. "Stupid of me. Sorry." He flicks Harry a glance, then moves his hand to Harry’s hip. There’s two layers of clothing between Harry’s skin and Draco’s hand, but Harry feels it like a brand. "Do you ever feel like you finally get something you want. Something you’ve wanted
“The jo ― oh, nice Draco.” Harry laughed breathlessly. “Is that a fact, is it?”
"Grand. Back in a sec, then." With a last squeeze of his arm, Ginny heads to the bar, her sandals softly slapping on the slate tiles.
It's a gay club, but that's of course not why Draco has avoided it before tonight. Its size, its popularity, the fact that it is entirely Muggle―this is what has kept Draco at bay. It's hot in here, and overwhelming. So many people, alive and vibrant and pumping vivacious blood through glorious veins riddled with chemical substance. Draco has to shut his eyes, fingers holding onto the back of Potter's open plaid shirt so as not to lose him in the crowd. It's too much, the feeling of being a shark amongst tender shoals, a wolf in a field of lambs.
), at 1am. It’s twenty to, now, but Draco has been here since midnight. He’s restless and excited, and not a little bit nervous as well. The sun set hours ago, and Draco was already awake hours before that, eager to leave behind strange dreams of dark figures―eager to see Potter again.
"Calm down, Malfoy," Potter mutters, using two fingers to align his coaster with the grain of the wood on the table between them. "Don’t get your knickers in a twist."
And some people just need a good scare.
Draco bends forwards, his words sliding off into a gasp as Harry presses his lips to the thin skin of Draco's inner wrist.
In his quest to find something non-Potter to rest his gaze on, Draco makes eye-contact with the coiffed blonde across the bar. She smiles, mauve lips curling pleasantly and raises her drink in greeting. Draco is about to look away, until she pats the stool next to her, inclining her head in a clear invitation to come over. Draco smiles again, but tightly this time in polite rejection, and turns back to Potter.
Draco nods, although it pains him somewhat to do it. He knows Potter will be fine. He’s capable, and he’s done this on his own before, clearly, before Draco dropped him into this particular dive and managed to finagle this meeting. He’s still reluctant to see him leave.
"Evening," he greets. "Sleep well?"
"What now?" he asks, hoping desperately it's not the wrong thing to say.
“I’ll be sure to send a memo to the sun, as well as all other magical space detritus passing through our galaxy, on your behalf,” the Healer says with impressive sarcasm. It reminds Harry, powerfully and suddenly, of Snape. “Now, before I do that, shall we focus on the more pressing concerns of symptoms and duration?”
Draco realises, on the third day that he dozes and before the evening of their scheduled meeting with Darya, that he’s also keeping a secret of his own from Potter in turn.
"Oh, fu―" Harry breaks off into a moan, head tipping back against the bed. His hips circle between wanting to press up into Draco mouth and to bear down against his long fingers as Draco moves them inside him. He feels Draco's answering groan against his cock.
, he needs to respond to her or she’ll come kick his door down. He badly wants to put it off forever. He can’t imagine what could be so bad to Draco about being in Australia right now; Harry would much rather be in another country, he muses, than sat here pissing his day away for the umpteenth day in a row.
As far as explanations go, this is far from what Draco is hoping for. "That’s it?" he asks, nonplussed. "You’re looking for some
Draco can barely breathe. He sits perfectly still, mute in shock.
Except.
Harry took a deep breath, or as much of one as he could manage considering Draco was fucking him halfway up the bed. “I want you to come, I wanna feel it inside me, making me,
is not exactly what Draco had in mind when he suggested a drink, but Potter appears to have taken to the idea with both hands. Or at least, with a drink in both hands, as it were.
talk,” Draco interrupted happily.
He hasn’t broached the subject with Potter. It’s possible he’ll have no idea what Draco is talking about, or he’ll feign ignorance, or he’ll disappear in the night at the first word of it. Draco doesn’t know enough yet to be able to make an informed decision, to take suitable action, and that’s what he deals in these days.
"So you’ll just sit in the armchair and watch
The night is warm and still as Draco exits the establishment, his back straight and his hands in his pockets. The streetlights have flickered on, illuminating the few people around and glinting off the windows of parked cars. It catches on Draco's hair, and then on the silver signet ring on his smallest left finger as he drags it through the white-blond strands. His heels click on the stone pavement, a comforting sturdy rhythm that blends into the night-time sounds of the city.
Draco snorts, and then properly laughs, shaking his head as he looks at Harry. “Well, it’s not just that. Earlier, I saw what I am quietly confident was,” Draco pauses for effect, leaning closer to Harry; Harry feels his face flush gently from the proximity, “a badger.”
Draco finds himself genuinely shocked to uncover this. He knows where she is, now, and what she does. He has a vague idea what she looks like, which is all immensely valuable information to be able to pass on to his client. To pass on to
Draco sighs, tapping long fingers against the bar counter in front of him. His gin and soda water sits barely touched, ice cubes sweating. Every now and again he can hear them clink as they melt, shifting around in the glass. It's an annoyingly posh glass, even by Draco's standards, and he was raised on blown Venetian crystal. There's a sprig of rosemary in there too, nestled in with a sad sphere of sliced cucumber. Draco wants to petulantly lob it across the room at the couple sat in a booth nearby, so clearly having a lovely evening. So clearly
he asks in follow up, just to keep the conversation going.
“Heathen,” he mumbles, before shaking his hair out of his eyes and tucking his wand away. “Right.” Draco plants his hands on his hips, his jacket and shirt rolled up to expose his forearms; Harry resists looking at the somewhat mottled and faded scar on the left. He knows Draco hates that. “That’s the bed sorted. You can borrow some night clothes of mine, if you’d like? We’ll sort out fetching some proper things of yours for tomorrow when neither of us are dead on our feet. Toothbrush and so on.” Draco trails off as if talking to himself, already turning to head out the door and to his own room to gather some clothes for Harry.
"It’s something." Draco folds one arm across his stomach, mirroring Potter’s posture. He keeps the other outstretched, fingers curved around his glass. "It must be. You’re
"Yes, well." Draco forces a smile to cover his nervousness. "I could, of course, also send you there alone with her information, if you prefer. As your hired investigator, though, it would make sense I go with you. I have friends in some very low places. It may be useful." Draco bites his lip. He watches the play of emotions across Potter's face and tries not to overthink this.
His grades are better than they’ve ever been, at least, with all the free time Draco has. Turns out being a social pariah is excellent for one’s academic pursuits. Who would have though it? His father would be proud of him for studying so hard, if his father gave a toss about anything these days other than trying to restoring the family’s obliterated reputation. It’s never going to happen, and Draco doesn’t care much for it anymore. His name is dirt, far filthier than any impure blood Draco was raised to loathe. Draco’s world has been tilted on its axis and he doesn’t know if it will ever feel right again, but he is certain at least that being a Malfoy means nothing and blood purity means even less.
That's why Draco relies on real donors, not blood bags. He has contacts these days, and very good ones. He's smart, and he's safe, and he could still end up on the pointy end of a wooden stake despite it all. Knowing as much as he can is his best precaution; he makes it his business to do this for every place he goes to. As a private eye, it’s essential. As a queer vampire, it’s survival.
“Um.” Harry clears his throat, coughs into his fist. The sound is startlingly loud in the quiet night, even though Harry’s voice is a low murmur. “I noticed, like. I thought.” He twists something he’s holding in his hands, a glass bottle. The light from Harry’s wand catches on its carefully crafted angles, refracting slightly. “I noticed you sometimes, on your arm.” Harry gestures at Draco’s forearm, then makes a scrubbing motion with his hand.
be doing, but he’s not so sure that’s the case now. At least, he doesn't feel so bad about it anymore. He feels oddly like that weight on his shoulders has, if not quite alleviated, at least lifted a little. He still has a horrid meeting tomorrow, but Aggie is pleasant and reasonable and it won’t be the end of the world. Probably. Hangover aside, Harry feels incredibly positive.
Draco chuckles, breathless as he keeps his pace and ruts down against Potter as if he were fucking him for real. Draco wants to, but not right now. Right now he wants nothing more than this, getting off in his bed like desperate teenagers.
"How did you guess," Harry grumbles, chin resting on his cupped palm, face smooshed up. He picks at a piece of croissant left on his plate.
Incubus. Succubus. Night Mare. It doesn’t fit Draco’s understanding of any of these creatures. It’s drawn to him, but he doesn’t know why. It hasn't hurt him, but perhaps it just hasn’t found a way to yet. Draco can’t move in these dreams, but he isn’t sure if that’s the shadowy figure’s doing, or if it's the limits of his own mind. He’s lucid, aware of what’s happening, and perhaps this is where the being can exist, can find him―in that space between dreaming and awake, when things are strangest and reality feels paper thin.
“Shut it.” Harry laughs softly. “Anyway, being an Auror’s not for me,” Harry jokes, taking a mouthful of his own tea. It’s still perfectly warm. “I hear it’s all loads of sitting around in bogs in the Fens watching a fat lot of nothing happen.”
Potter stops in front of a blessedly free cubicle, turning to face Draco. "Is this okay?" he asks, inclining his head towards the open cubicle door. There's a bloke nearby who gives them a vaguely interested up and down. He'll assume they're planning to do lines, or do each other, neither of which seem to be a surprising occurrence here.
“Err.” Harry can feel himself flushing at the suggestion of physical intimacy. He wonders, suddenly, if this means Draco can feel that Harry is feeling embarrassed, or worse that he’s interested, and chances a glace in his direction. Draco looks similarly stricken, flushed a lobster blush, but for all Harry knows that’s all his own embarrassment, Merlin, he’s confused already.
He stretches out, blinking his eyes open slowly. The blankets are a warm cocoon around him, and the temptation to let himself go back to sleep is strong. Before he can slip off again, the bed dips beside him. A warm hand lands at his shoulder, surprising Harry enough to make him somewhat alert. He rolls over onto his back. Draco’s hand is dislodged by the motion.
Draco looks away, then quickly back again. "Yes, I was. I came back prematurely. I thought perhaps we should…talk." He clears his throat again. "In person."
"What can I get you, gents?" The man grunts, his accent startling in its familiarity. British, or perhaps South African.
"So. Berlin?"
"Oh, hardly." Draco makes a face as though he’s smelt something unpleasant. "How crass. No, keep your gold, Potter," he says dismissively.
"Are we doing this, then, Harry?" His hair falls across his forehead as he raises his hands back to Harry's face, stopping just shy of touching him. Harry breathes in deeply, drinking in the sight of Draco, warm and real and right in front of Harry. Ready for him.
responds Harry, feeling gooey and stupid and deeply touched that Draco saw a tree and thought of Harry. It’s really pathetic and Harry knows it. Never mind it might be a horrible tree, seeing as Draco doesn’t like his current location. He said the tree was
And deep down, Draco knows there is something that borders on romantic in it too, at least for Draco. It’s the lack of filter; he can’t lie to himself about it anymore. He likes coming here because it’s his spot, and he likes coming here at night because he wants to see Harry, and be near him. Draco arranges his cloak around his lap, and then half over Harry’s knee as well. It’s all part of the routine now, the sharing of space and warmth. They’ve talked so little and yet fallen completely in sync here. Draco thinks there’s definitely a romance to that, whether Harry feels it too or not, even if they never acknowledge it. Draco will have this.
He thinks Potter is leading them back to their previous secluded corner, but Potter takes them past it. Understanding blossoms in Draco's mind as they arrive at the men's bathrooms. Draco gapes for a moment at the implication of it. Not that he's surprised for himself—he's gotten off in a grubby loo before and felt no shame―but
The first time Draco came out here at night, he didn’t expect anyone to be around. It was his little hidey hole, his safe spot. He didn’t think anyone else bothered to come back behind the greenhouses, not where the vegetation was so overgrown and full of the threat of gnomes, and spiders, and brambles in cloaks.
Agatha’s eyes widen. "You just said it wasn’t!"
“Even when I was flirting with you?”
"Normally, I would do this the old-fashioned way." Draco sucks in a breath, kissing the knob of Harry's ankle. "Use real lube rather than conjured, but." He laughs self-deprecatingly. "I'm feeling rather pressed for time."
There's a short pause.
That thought rather blanks out Draco’s mind. He can tell Potter isn’t a vampire. Draco can sense his own kind, although he’d be fucked if asked to explain how. He just knows when other vampires are around, can pick up their presence in the air around him as though he had little supernatural antennae on his head. Draco thinks it’s a survival mechanism. Vampires are a bit like wild jungle cats, in a way. Solitary, territorial, silent and instinctively predatorial. They don’t like being around each other, not really, although they will tolerate it for the sake of bars like this one, for passing on information, or for company should eternal life get truly, unbearably lonely. It’s useful to know where the others of his ilk are, as well as making sure that they don’t feed on each other. If there’s one thing Draco knows it’s that undead blood is not good for him, or
They lapse into silence, but not an uncomfortable one, as they each serve themselves some breakfast. Draco elects for scrambled eggs with salmon and chives, the flecks of finely chopped green herb sitting starkly against the soft, fluffy yellow. Harry feels mildly overwhelmed by the amount of choice before him. They're only two people and yet there’s eggs, cold meats, a platter of sliced fruit and French pastries. He idly fingers his knife and fork and tries to make a decision. Across the table, Draco eyes him off.
“Hmm.” Draco raised his shoulders, arms tightening around his middle as he thought. “Could work, yeah.” He twisted his mouth to the side. “Could also work a bit too well, though.”
On the other, more Muggle-facing hand, Draco is an odd job man who just happens to turn up on the doorsteps of increasingly frazzled Muggle occupants who can't understand why the pipes are clanking and the ceiling is bulging and Great Aunt Hetty's heirloom mirror just called them a twat.
"Yeah," Draco groans his response, fucking Harry on his fingers and pulling Harry off with his other hand. "God, this feels so good." Draco shakes his fringe out of his eyes again, a losing battle giving his damp forehead. He laughs, breathlessly. "And so weird."
to cast the room into complete darkness. The silence that comes with it feels deafening. Draco listens to it, tries to make himself feel comfortable. He can hear from the tone of Potter’s breathing that he’s not asleep yet either. It’s not surprising, therefore, when Potter speaks.
“Poor Potter. It’s a quarter past seven, then, not that early. And you’re still a lazy sod.”
Harry threads one hands into Draco hair again, lets the longer stands at the top fall over his fingers. "Yeah?"
“Poor her,” Draco agrees. His expression doesn’t change, but Harry feels Draco’s jealousy ebbing away. He’s not sure if that’s from Harry’s attempt at glossing over it, reminding Draco they are exes, or if Draco simply got a handle on himself. Either way, Harry does feel oddly pleased to know that it got to Draco, even though he feels unkind for that.
Harry messily kissed Draco’s neck, up to his ear. He gently pulled the lobe between his teeth. “I want you to fill me up,” he mumbled, aiming for sexy and breathless. That’s definitely how he felt, at least, as well as just sweaty and insanely turned on. Harry bit down again, softly, as he heard Draco groan, low and guttural.
, Draco mused later on, chest numb and ears ringing as he packed his bags and left.
When there's a knock at the door he startles, grabbing the window frame with one hand and almost dropping his smoke with the other.
It hadn’t worked out between them, although the sex had been fun and friendship had happily survived the breakup, and now Harry was rather back at square one―with a crush on someone he wasn’t sure what to do with. No one was trying to kill him at the moment, at least not as far as he was aware, but apparently the cosmos were still playing funny buggers with him, which was just his luck.
“Ta dah, I brought you pyjamas. Be grateful, Potter,” Draco mutters happily. The bed dips as he plants his hands on it in loose fists then leans his weight on them. Upside down, he smiles at Harry. Harry smiles hopelessly back, surprised by Draco’s sudden proximity. The playfulness of his position. Harry doesn't dare point out that this is slightly out of the blue, though, for fear of spooking Draco, of having him lean away again.
“Wonderful.” Draco sits back, takes a tiny bite at one corner of the toast he’s so meticulously spread. “And how was the wank?” he asks crisply. “That was also satisfactory, I take it?”
." Harry rubs at the nape of Draco’s neck. He can’t seem to stop touching him, now he’s started. "After leaving it for two days."
Potter’s brow creases into the ghost of a frown. "You don’t need to give me the bed. I can sleep―"
of what Harry knows is magic. He can’t make the words, though, can feel them trembling on the tip of his tongue but not solidly enough to scoop them up. He can feel the heat of Draco’s leg against his arm, a solid anchor of another’s presence, but he desperately wants more. A sound, a word, a proper touch from Draco. That would be enough to calm Harry’s rattled bones, he thinks, even as the colours in front of his eyes start to blur, as his head swims.
a pilchard,” is the only thing he can think to add to Draco’s annoyed soliloquy. It’s all a bit much to take in; he can be forgiven for being somewhat off his game.
“― not a premonition.”
“Well.” Draco presses his hands to the arms of the chair palm down, then flexes his fingers. He lets them settle around the shape of the wood. “We’ll stay at mine. It’s closer, and I’ve got Nettle to look after.” He looks up at Harry, the expression in his grey eyes both hard and tired at once. “Alright, Potter?”
"Bullshit."
Draco’s dreamt of the dark figure in his room every night since speaking with Potter, since helping him with this case. He knows there must be a connection. One doesn’t accept a job to search for a necromancer—for someone who’s got both arms elbow-deep in the grave and beyond—and also dream of looming apparitions, and not see the link there. Or at least, Draco imagines that ignoring the likely connection could lead to some trouble down the line.
, etc. It faded as quickly as it came, like all knee-jerk reactions do. Harry didn’t seem pathetic, or like he wanted Draco to leave, or to combust on the spot, like Draco expected. Above all, Draco did want to stay. This was his spot, and he could share it. So he did.
She was right, on both counts. Astoria didn’t come back from France, and Draco was ill in the bathroom at Miss Eventide’s, and then again after Harry Apparated them both to Draco’s house, and then
what this is. What it’s trying to get from people, and that it eventually will hurt someone." Potter swallows, visibly upset. "If I haven’t already. No one has been a Horcrux and survived before," Potter repeats. It’s the same sentence he uttered before. Potter sounds almost broken repeating it now.
Draco is sitting on the end of his bed, one hand on each knee, the sheet pulled over his thighs. His feet are bare against the carpets. He can wiggle his toes, can extend his fingers and curve his wrists. It's more movement than he's had so far in these strange dreams. And he is certain this is a dream, once again.
Draco loves his job; it’s his life. It gives him reason to get out of bed every evening, bathing in fresh moonlight and preparing to find out what awful things the regular folks have been getting up to behind their loved ones’ backs. And getting paid to do it, no less. He’s a snoopy enough fucker as it is; he’d stick his nose in people’s business for free, really. He’s thrilled to find there is a market for surreptitiously gathering the secrets of those who think they are being ever so carefully devious, and reporting back to those who will line Draco’s pockets for this information. Everyone's got secrets, or things to hide, whether big or small, even more so given all the power vacuums left in the wake of the War. Work for a private investigator is thriving, even one with as undesirable a last name as the one Draco is blessed with. (
The sensation he feels when Draco touches the back of his neck is unlike anything he’s ever known, and yet familiar at the same time―it’s the prickle of electricity, the bitter tang of magic in the back of the throat, static shooting up his neck and down between his ribs and thighs.
"Excited?" Draco asks, as he motions towards the door. There’s a heavyset bouncer standing to the left, but there’s no queue. The man doesn’t look like he’s even bothering with IDs. His sole purpose appears to be to loom confrontationally and deter away any people who aren’t deliberately seeking this particular establishment out. Draco feels his mouth twist in distaste. This whole place is already giving him the heebie jeebies. It’s one thing to be a Dark creature. It’s something else entirely to be
“Fucking bleak out here, isn’t it?” Harry muses, rousing himself out of his thoughts.
Draco pulls away, shaking his head in what looks like disbelief. "I can't believe this." He breathes out in a laugh, before resting his forehead against Harry's thigh. Even that feels maddening right now.
Draco pulled back searching his face. He slowly shook his head, nose brushing against Harry’s and grey eyes soft. “Wouldn’t’ve been the end of the world,” he mumbled, kissing Harry slowly, and then harder. He ran his hand down Harry’s arm, down to where he held the paper, and slipped his palm around it. Harry sighed into the kiss, his head spinning and his heart thumping.
“Yes, well, can it not run through me so forcibly when I’m trying to work?” Draco gripes, unimpressed.
?” Draco interrupts.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry groaned, kissing him wet and deep. “I don't think I can, on my stomach,” he mumbled in between slick slides of his lips, pressing himself harder against Draco’s leg. “Or my back, to be honest,” he added, laughing softly at the idea of of trying to pull his legs up. He probably could ― he was fit, and still agile enough these days ― but he doubted it would be very comfortable, without, perhaps, a series of complicated levitation spells to keep his legs in the air. Or maybe a winch. He wasn’t sure how sexy that would end up being.
"Already?"
He shakes all thoughts aside of the mornings he won’t have as the door swings open, and Gerhalt ushers him inside with a close-lipped smile and a genial pat on the shoulder. Draco lets the warmth of the bar and the syrupy combination of thrumming bass and rowdy chatter swallow him whole.
Ginny snuggles closer, and Harry leans into her for a moment to make it clear that, terrible metaphors aside, he’s not offended or bothered or uncomfortable. He is, in a way, but he doesn’t want her to know it. "Don’t be a martyr mushroom, got it," he mumbles. "God, I sound a bit rubbish, don’t I?" He’s suddenly feeling tired and emotional, the way honesty always makes him feel. He wants to crawl away from this conversation, skin first, but he doesn’t.
“Yes, I guess so.” Harry folds his shirt sleeves up to his elbows, eyes off the spread of food before him. He decides he wants tea in lieu of coffee. “As well as can be expected, I’d say. Oh, I hope you don’t mind, I used your Floo before.” Harry adds a splash of milk to his tea. “To call Ginny, ask her to drop me off some clothes for the rest of the weekend. She’s got the codes for all my wards, knows her way around my closet,” he clarifies at Draco’s blank look.
"I thought so." He licks his lips, eyes flitting over Harry's face. Slowly, he raises his hands, long fingers reaching towards Harry. Harry holds his breath, then lets it out in an audible rush as Draco pulls his glasses off his face, gentle as anything. He folds them, the click of metal on metal so faint in the quiet, lamplit room. Harry watches his hands, the barely visible shake in them. Nervous, Harry thinks, his stomach somersaulting. He feels it inside himself too. Nervousness, excitement, anticipation. It buzzes through him in the echo chamber of this room, of the chemistry between them, with the bond exacerbating that what which was already there into cosmic proportions.
Dating, in light of those aforementioned factors, is really bloody
He’s Summoning the take away menu to him before she’s even had time to start laughing.
Draco nods. "That’s the one, yes. She, well. I spoke with her, and asked after your schedule today in case she knew it and she politely told me to wait here." Draco takes his hands out of his pockets and folds them in front of him, straightening up as he does so. It looks so formal, so stilted, that Harry feels like he’s going to burst out laughing.
Feet shoved in his shoes, and self pity shoved forcefully aside, Draco heads outside of his dorm room, fingers of his right hand curled into a fist and shoved into his pocket too, for good measure.
, then confused, that he takes a full moment to just stare open-mouthed at him. He feels like the shock of it has given him heartburn. His chest is aching as his heart thumps against his ribcage.
There’s an abandoned greenhouse, right at the back of the lot. There are unruly trees, and snagged brambles, and the grass is long and lush. It feels like the Forest, but tamer somehow, and Draco likes it. It feels like the spot where the castle meets the wild, or where the wild is trying to creep back in. There’s something mildly thrilling about it at night, the potential for danger, for something to look back at Draco as he stares into the dark, lush woods. Draco’s always loved that feeling.
god, keep doing that, just like that, yes ―
Draco’s quiet for a moment, and when Harry looks up he finds he's watching him, eyes narrowed and expression hawkish. “And let me repeat myself, Harry,” Draco starts, his voice low. “I can think of worse things to wake up to.” He leans forward to pick up his own tea cup. Harry stares at the shadows of his collarbone.
?" Harry yells, lurching backwards and almost tripping over his own feet. His wand is pointed straight at Draco’s chest before he even notices he’s raised it.
"Who are you planning to tell?" he snaps, suspicion deeply colouring his tone.
, which is lovely and embarrassingly makes Harry tear up. He’s had a hell of a few days; he lets himself off the hook for this one. Aggie politely doesn’t call him out on it when he wipes his wet cheeks on her suit jacket shoulder pads, or mention his red-rimmed eyes.
Harry spared a moment to feel ridiculous, sitting with his cock jutting out ahead of him, angry and red, from below the sweep of his stomach. It was hard to focus on that, though, when Draco lifted his face, sucking one of Harry’s balls into his mouth. Harry groaned, cock twitching as Draco did it again, his hands spread on Harry’s arse and moving him in time with his mouth.
"No." Harry laughs again, miserably. He pushes his fingers through his hair, then straightens up. He needs to get a grip, and just deal with the consequences of his actions. "It’s fine." He takes a deep breath, Draco watching him with wide eyes and a worried furrow between his brows. "Did you come straight here?" he asks. Draco looks clean-shaven, his clothes neat and pressed. He smells nice, Harry notes wretchedly. He doesn't seem like someone who’s just long distance Floo’d.
He’s not an idiot, is the thing. He’s a clever man, and was a clever boy before that. He can connect things quickly in his mind, make the necessary leaps of logic needed to be a good investigator. It’s why he excels at what he does. It’s how he found Darya when Potter couldn’t quite get there.
He has a sudden massive urge to go outside and check the house number. He looks around the kitchen instead. It feels like he’s in the right house. That’s his breadbin. Those are his grotty dishes still in the sink because he was too mopey to do them last night, and that’s his cat sitting on the bench and watching them with vague interest and possible distrust. And that’s Draco stood in front of him.
He does do stupid things though, this he can admit about himself. Quietly, in the most personal parts of his mind. Never out loud, and never to Pansy, thank you. But to himself he is quite true.
"Hmm?" Draco looks up briefly before looking at his own hands as he starts to undo the drawstring of Harry's joggers. His fingers bump against Harry's cock, large and insistent and in the way, and they both gasp.
"You staying for dinner?" Harry asks through a spray of crumbs, as a peace offering for being lousy afternoon company, and also for that whole thing about not writing the book he promised her.
Draco tilts his head, a smile still lingering around his lips. He folds his arms around his waist. The collar of his white vest hangs low around his collarbone and his grey silk dressing gown open. “Oh, it’s not as dire as all that, Potter.”
Potter nods, and then tucks his hands under his armpits. The rain is ruining his hair, making his clothes wet through. The drops glisten on the metal buttons of his jacket. His posture makes him look young, like the boy Draco used to know, and not at all like him at the same time. The boy Draco knew then never gave things willingly to Draco.
Draco’s eyes were glued to the dirt on his face, at the red of cheeks and around his eyes. There was a reflex in him to do just what Potter’s warned him not to; to ridicule, to tear him down for crying while sat in a pile of wilting weeds, alone at night.
It’s beautiful, a rush of light speeding across the black expanse. Harry’s got vague memories of seeing a shooting star when he was younger, when the Dursley’s deigned to take him on a camping trip with them. It was nothing like this; that shooting star was a brief flash, and then gone. This one seems to move slower, even though Harry reasons it must be moving at speeds he cannot comprehend. It has a huge, white tail, and it burns with the fiercest white light.
The lights come right back on again, of course, leaving Draco dizzy and confused, and with a coppery tang in his mouth, and suddenly things slot into place. The man kissing his neck, a sharp pain in his throat, a dizzying high that turned into just being dizzy, and alarm bells fading out as Draco faded out with them. The whopping great big
Harry laughs into it, before leaning in to kiss Draco once more.
, Hermione writes.
Secondly, he gets himself kicked out of home for blowing the gardener behind the sheds near the ornamental carp pond.
“Draco, I'm huge,” Harry insisted.
"A shitake." Ginny giggles, then playfully thumps Harry on the shoulder. "No, shut up, stop distracting me. You’re not a shitty mushroom, that’s my point! You don’t have to just make do with whatever is going on. You can stop doing things. You
"You love Quidditch," Harry says, somewhat redundantly. He knows that, she knows that.
He composes a text instead, more words filling up the little screen right under his own already sent messages. It just says,
“Oh my
It’s true. Since becoming sort of friendly-ish, to then becoming actually friendly text mates, there has been a lot of speculation about the history between Draco and Harry. It’s all bollocks, of course; Harry properly hated Malfoy in school, and the feeling was mutual. And very fucking warranted as far as Harry’s concerned. It’s just…not so warranted, now.
Harry blinks, the movement slow even as his heartbeat kicks up in his chest. He nods, arms straining behind him. Draco's mouth twists into a smile, his eyes dark and his expression hungry.
, when another message from Draco splats onto Harry’s phone screen.
"Nothing?" Draco repeats, confused. "But―"
Harry bit his lip. “Does that mean you’re not up for it?”
, he tries to say, but the words stick in his throat. He feels warm, his arm tingling where it’s pressed so gently against Draco’s leg. His face flushes, heat spreading from his cheeks outwards, warming his neck and tinging his ears pink. The ground is cold beneath his arse, under his legs, but the light warms his face as he gazes up at it as if he were staring at an open fire.
“We’re gonna have a baby.” Harry stared at the wall. “Merlin’s
Draco's so gobsmacked, then
Potter does flinch at those words. He recovers quickly, before Draco can probe further into it. "Fine. I want. Just." Potter sighs, runs his hands through his hair. He adjusts his glasses. "I saw you last night. You saw me." Potter spreads his hands as if the answer is obvious. Draco shrugs, deciding not to make it easy for him. If Potter wants something, he’s going to have to use his big boy words. "Don’t tell anyone you saw me. Please," Potter adds, after a moment, belatedly polite. Draco almost wants to laugh at the ridiculousness of it. He keeps his expression plain, instead.
"It’s true." Potter steps back, appraising the fence as if he intends to scale it. "He made several. Innocuous objects, or meaningful ones. Some significant only to him. The diary your father gave to Ginny Weasley was one." Potter turns to look at Draco. The glare of a nearby streetlamp reflects off his glasses, obscuring the expression in his eyes from Draco’s view. In contrast, Draco suspects his own face is plain to read. He feels blindsided by this information.
He doesn't think about it again as he finishes cleaning himself off.
Draco's thumb rubbed back and forth at the base of Harry's stomach, just under the swell of his belly. There would be a scar there soon enough, in about four months time. A scar and a house full of noise and sleep deprivation, mess and chaos and promise and hope. Harry couldn't wait. He knew the Healers could probably get rid of the scar too, or cover it up, but he found he didn't mind the prospect of it being there to stay. He had had worse, in his life, and he was okay with ending up with this one.
Draco kisses the inside of Harry’s thigh as he eases Harry’s leg down from the bed. Harry struggles up onto his elbow, his arms wobbly and his breathing still uneven. He’s sure his face and chest must be a hectic red. Sat between his legs, Draco looks no better, his usually neat hair wild and messy across his forehead and his chest mottled a blotchy pink from exertion. Harry stares down at him for long moments, drinking him in. He wants to save this memory, preserve it in his mind and keep it as pristine as if it were in a pensieve.
“I thought it might have been,” adds Harry, feeling quite triumphant at guessing correctly― and then feeling an odd, distant throb of annoyance somewhere in the back of his mind. He’s not in a particularly bad mood, and at the same time, it’s there simmering around him. Not for the first time he wonders if Draco is managing to actually project his pissiness out into the atmosphere, but he doesn’t mention it. The last time he did that Draco tried to hex his knees together.
“But hang on, if we’ve been bonded, shouldn’t we, y’know.” Harry flaps his free hand about, then lets it flop to his knee. “Feel a bit different? Feel a bit anything?” Harry shrugs one unimpressed shoulder. “I feel fine, just a bit cranky and tired.”
. Draco has often told Harry he himself finds Harry's house a total tip, so they're evenly matched in terms of disliking each other's choice of abode. It would be strange to Harry if they weren't, in a way.
“I assure you it is not shit, horse or otherwise,” The Healer counters, somewhat stiffly. “We are all made of stardust, Mr Malfoy. The iron in your blood was forged in dying stars. Don’t imagine the magic that runs through you doesn't respond to that which runs through the most distant galaxies.”
"In two days. Maybe less." Draco shrugs one shoulder. "I've no real commitments left here. Yourself?"
And then, lights out.
Or really, another slow and uninterrupted wank would do it. Harry feels his cheeks growing warm at the memory of this morning, and the conversation that ensued. He runs a hand over the back of his neck, as if he can scrub the heat away. He feels a little unsteady with it, overheated as warmth pools quickly in his belly, creeps down his thighs.
“Um,” Draco manages, seemingly no more eloquent than Harry. “So. No touching.”
“Oh?” Harry’s eyebrows raise in surprise. “Have we?”
specifically, getting off in your head, is not that dire?” He shakes his head, still appalled with himself, and what Draco must think of him. He picks his tea up just for something to do with his hands.
And then the next.
Annoyingly, that doesn’t seem to be how things actually work, so Harry's just resigned to wanking in the shower and probably dying alone. Oh well. He's been through worse.
Cat wrangling achieved, the second thing Harry does is: finally reply to Aggie and sets up a meeting with her on Thursday.
"Do you, though?" Ginny looks at him disbelievingly. "You don’t have to just let things happen to you when you aren’t enjoying them anymore."
Draco slumps in his chair, then rests his elbow on the bar and his chin in his cupped palm. His date is not going to show up. This whole evening was a waste of effort and hair product. It's hard enough to find someone who's willing to give Draco a go given his, well,
He feels a bit like something has got to give, like he's a moose teetering precariously on ice that's getting thinner; it seemed fun at first, and within his grasp, but now his antlers are weighed down with snow and shit metaphors.
“What does
Dimly, he feels he should be scared of this. His body feels struck still, his throat tight, his voice gone. There’s something sitting in his chest that feels like anticipation, though, not fear. Harry’s certain he can still recognise what true fear is. His wand is vibrating in his pocket, the emergency signal shooting back to The Ministry as it detects something wrong with its possessor, but even that isn't enough to worry Harry.
, interrupting him.
He and Draco seem to dance around each other, pottering around this enormous house and acting as though nothing has changed between them, and ostensibly, it hasn't. On the outside, they're acting as they always do. Internally though, Harry's insides are squirming, his belly swooping every time he catches a whiff of Draco's cologne or feels the trickle of Draco's emotions run down his spine. It's maddening. It's brilliant.
"No no, it’s fine." Harry plonks himself down into the chair. "Don’t apologise. Err." He gestures at the table. "Sit down and have some of the tea. That you prepared."
Draco dreams that day.
. Things come to his mind in that order.
at this. I’m not just saying that." He slides his hand up Harry’s chest, over the pearlescent buttons on his shirt and up to his bare collarbone. He strokes his thumb against it. "I’m not good at dating. I have one ex, and she left me with a kid and a fear of rejection the size of Ireland and I just…" Draco taps his thumb on Harry’s heated skin, then slips his fingers under the collar of his shirt. "You’re my friend now and I would rather not shit the bed here, as it were. It’s hard to think of someone wanting to get in line for me, when I come with…so much baggage.
Potter is waiting for him.
"What happened?"
“Quite.” Draco looks like he’s trying not to smile.
. Draco lifts his own head away from the wall to stare down at Potter, at the stretch of his mouth around Draco’s girth, at the gentle crease between his brows as he concentrates on taking Draco down. The suction of his mouth as he pulls back to suckle at the head is mindblowing, and Draco’s mouth drops open once more on a silent groan. His breath hitches as Harry swirls his tongue around the slit of Draco’s cock, then runs it along the underside of the head. Draco’s thighs are starting to tremble.
). Best of all, they seem fine with Harry walking in wearing flip flops and carrying a cat. He waves to Ginny when he sees her at a table outside.
something from me?”
Draco blinks, then frowns. He opens his mouth to argue, but stops when he feels Potter's hand on the crook of his elbow.
“Harry ―”  Draco started.
If he’d been a betting man, Draco would have put his Galleons on Longbottom being the one to be found seeking refuge amongst plants and leaves and shimmering blooms, but it’s not him. Draco would recognise the back of Potter’s head anywhere; he’s stared at it long enough, wishing ill will upon it when he was younger, and then futilely and shamefully wishing Harry would save him somehow last year. Draco would normally have a hard time admitting that to himself, but he doesn’t think he has a filter on his feelings anymore. He’s too tired (
Across the table, something flashes in Draco’s eyes. Harry feels a brief flash of emotion skitter along his spine in its wake. “I assure you, I will, thank you,” he says, his voice is soft and low, his eyes dark. “You’ll be sure to do the same for me, won’t you, Harry?” Draco runs his finger around the edge of his teacup. It comes away wet. “You’ll let me know, should you...
Draco's gums ache, his teeth itching to descend. He's fed two days ago, more than enough to keep him flush and well. He doesn't need a single drop of blood from any person here, and he knows it. His
Draco stares at the figure in the room, just a dark shape in the already dark night, and wonders what it is, what it wants. If it
Potter nods. "Trying to. The problem is no one understands what’s going on with me. People aren’t Horcruxes. People don’t host… fragments of Dark souls for most of their lives." Potter spreads his hands, another helpless gesture. "There’s scant, if any, information on what the fuck I’m
The parchment glitters again.
Draco had apologised right back, by saying it that it was only reasonable for Harry to be a little tetchy, considering there was a small person using Harry’s kidneys and bladder as alternating foot rests, and that he was currently at the mercy of magically simulated hormones Draco himself couldn't actually pronounce. And then he’d offered Harry a back massage. Harry could have cried with relief.
Harry struggles up onto his elbows so he can look down at Draco's face. The apples of Draco’s cheeks are pink as ever, framed by Harry's thighs. Harry reaches out and runs his hand through Draco's hair, down his cheek. It's soppy, and ridiculous, the way Harry feels right now. He grins down at Draco, his smile lopsided and sex-drunk, then shrugs as best he can while leaning back on one elbow and with one leg pretezelled up against the bed. He must look like a complete knob.
He’s still puzzling it out, in a languid way, when his eyelids begin to droop, sleep pulling his mind away. He lets it go; he decides he doesn't need to know. Whatever it is, it’s real, and it’s coming from him. That’s enough.
Harry laughs, struggling one leg and then the other into his joggers. He remembers that banana bread. He thinks it’s still with the Unspeakables, which is hilarious given that the banana bread kept, well,
Potter shakes his head. "Wrong, wrong, wrong. I’m nothing," he repeats. He folds his arms across his chest, defiant and casual. Draco knows he’s lying, he must be. He can’t tell what it is specifically he’s lying about, though. Draco hates not knowing.
Draco hums, muttering another spell sotto voce. "I can tell." He kisses at Harry's thigh again, lips moving to the base of Harry's cock. Harry jerks, surprised by the feel of it. He jerks again, his entire body on edge, as Draco sucks one of his balls into his mouth. He release it with an audible, wet sound and a low sigh, rubbing the knuckles of his cupped fingers over Harry's perineum.
There’s a quick pause in the writing, then a new line.
“Oh, don’t you start.” Draco shoots him a glare, and Harry feels the throb of irritation spike.
Draco’s right. It’s past noon, and Harry’s still in his PJs. Which means he’s in his pants and some ratty socks and a vest with a hole over one nipple that Harry’s had since he was fourteen and which was once white but is now a sort of off-putting grey-beige colour. Greige. He should really throw it out, but there’s a pineapple on the front riding a skateboard, and Harry’s fond of it. He should also try and write something today, Harry
He stares longingly out the window, instead.
Rather than throw a jab back to Harry, as he would normally do when Harry points out that Draco likes a lie in, Draco stays quiet instead. After a moment, he extends the parchment he’s holding out towards Harry. “We’ve had an owl.”
that, and Draco doesn't have to just come right out and say it.
“It’s okay, Draco,” Harry repeats, right as Draco feels himself drifting off, cheek pressed to Harry’s messy hair.
favours people will be calling in. Work done for free. Information he will have to divulge in return for the information he was given. He understands why, though, as soon as he fully realises who Potter is looking for, and how deeply illegal the rabbithole she lives down is.
Harry, elbow resting on the arm of his chair and chin in his hands, taps two fingers against his lips. “
“What, you’re suddenly turning selfish in bed?”
“Oh, no no.” The Healer chuckles. “No, that is in fact too far in the other direction, and brings us to symptom number two.”
Draco fights not to roll his eyes. "It’s just a pen, Potter, for pity’s sake, not a serpent." He grabs Potter's arm before either of them can think better of it. He’s got to write his bloody address on
“Um. Yeah, we definitely did.” Harry can feel his face growing hot as he shifts against the sheets.
The sounds of the club two doors away feel like a surreal backdrop to the building pleasure in Draco’s gut. His breathing grows faster still as Potter shuffles forward, taking Draco down so deep that his nose almost brushes Draco’s pubic hair. His fingers claw at the open waist of Draco’s jeans, pulling on the tight denim. Draco fights to keep his own fingers loose in Potter’s hair, not to pull him down on his cock, not to pull at all. It’s bad form, for one thing, to choke someone on one’s cock. Terribly impolite. More than that, though, Draco finds nothing in this world more gratifying than withstanding his most base of desires, controlling exactly how much and when he will submit to them. He knows it comes from the part of him that is still terrified of the fangs that sprout from his mouth, from those moments when he stares at a bare throat or the blue veins revealed by the tilt of an elegant wrist. Even now, his mouth is watering in a way that goes beyond sexual desire―his gums ache, his jaw feels loose. There’s the stirring of
Still, it’s not something he’s sure he wants Draco to know about. At best, it’s a bit creepy of Harry to watch him so much ― at worst, it’s far too revealing of how Harry feels about Draco himself.
Draco can’t explain why Potter saying that stings. It has no right to. Draco was never a friend, or close, or even bloody
"That’s all? Not mention I saw you?"
Harry groans. His good mood completely evaporated, he sets his phone down. His hands feel a bit shaky, and his stomach feels wrong. He takes a deep breath. He’s probably overreacting, he tells himself. Draco is busy, he has a whole house to de-ghoul, and so what if he would have usually responded by now, or initiated a conversation? Perhaps he’s not sure what to say, given that Harry has made everything spectacularly fucking awkward for him. Harry runs his fingers through his tangly hair, and then rests his elbows against the table, his chin and mouth smooshed into his palms. He blows a miserable raspberry, eyes wide and frantic. He needs a fucking Time-Turner.
Draco was anything but quiet after that.
Firstly, Draco isn’t asked back to Hogwarts.
"What point, that I’m a mushroom? Honestly, you had me there, saying some real deep stuff―"
's been having kittens about it, running tireless articles on where he's gone, why he's gone, who he's run off with. He's undercover in Spain, he's an Unspeakable of the highest ranking, he's gone Muggle and joined MI5. His body's lying in a forest in Devon, bones scattered by the smallest creatures and carrion birds. That last one caused a riot, condemnation falling on the paper for daring to even think it. The
He completely avoids talking about The Dreaded Drunk Text, or the fact Draco still hasn’t replied, and he isn’t sure if Aggie takes mercy on him and lets him get away with avoiding it because he looks so terrible, or if she’s too preoccupied with one of her biggest clients dropping a stonking change of plans on her lap right before deadline. Given the way their relationship works, it honestly could be both.
“Isn’t it,” the Healer agrees, either in the same position as Harry or simply choosing to ignore it. “Now, side effects. These are thankfully not extreme, which is why I will be discharging you as soon as we are done here. For the duration of the potion-brewing period you will need to be kept in proximity to each other. It’s rare, but we have had some adverse effects between bonded pairs who stray too far away from each other. As such, it would be ideal if you could stay together until Sunday. In the same house, in close quarters.”
“Oh hell.” Draco’s hips worked faster, head dropping so low his hair was tickling Harry’s collarbone now. It was a bit nice.
proclivities. Nevermind that he's never taken an un-asked for nip out of anyone,
"This is my house," Harry says, but it sounds like a question. He takes in the table setting, the cups placed neatly on his recently tidied table. He has no idea how long Draco has been here waiting for him. He feels infinitely worse at the sight of the tea things, the brewed pot and the terrible strainer and his chipped china. Bad news is always delivered with a cup of tea. Harry swallows, wiping his sweating palms on his jeans.
Late at night, when his left arm itches with a phantom ache just under the remnants of the dark ink stain, Draco wishes he could do the same thing to himself. Just purge the dark magic back out, get the Mark truly off of him and get rid of all the horrors imbued into it. Draco can barely look at it, even though it’s faded to just a scar, and he scratches at it constantly, mindlessly. He’s broken the skin more than once, the spike of pain bringing his attention to the fact he’s rubbed a patch raw by dragging his nails over and over the same spot. It’s become an embarrassing habit, one he can’t stop or anticipate. He keeps his nails clipped as short as he can and wears long sleeves, tightly buttoned at the wrists, but it doesn’t make much of a difference. His mind wants the Mark off him, and the scratching is seemingly a new basic motor function it has added to its roster. Draco has a mad fear that one morning he’ll wake up and find he’s cut his arm off in his sleep, or gnawed it right off, but for now, he just has to contend with waking up with the healing, raw areas painfully stuck to his sheets. It’s disgusting, and humiliating, and the Mark scar is still visible as ever undeath the new marks Draco’s put there.
Draco licks his lips, looking away. "Tit for tat," he explains, his voice rough. He clears his throat before he speaks again, feeling oddly uncomfortable. Exposed. "I think I rather owe you, as it were. For… services rendered. In the Room of Requirement." Draco swallows again, his throat feeling tight. He holds Potter’s gaze, but he can’t say the words, ‘
―” Draco stilled, breath whistling through his teeth as he ground his hips hard against Harry’s arse. He lifted Harry off the bed slightly, arms around around his middle as his orgasm rocked through him, and Harry bit his lip, a frantic mantra of
Harry oohs theatrically, shifting slightly in his squatting position. “Well now, a badger. I take it back, this mission isn’t a total waste of time. We’ve already got results.”
They weren’t invited back to Sarah’s (not really that surprising) but Harry didn’t feel too bad about it. Well, no, he did feel genuinely pretty rubbish about it for the next week or so, all stirred-up inside and cranky, but it was bound to happen the more he and Draco had to rub elbows at social events. They had history, and it was not good; even the remotely positive times they had interacted had happened in the midst of a war, in mansions full of mad men or in a swirl of flames. Harry had just hoped this most recent blow up didn't make things too hugely fucking awkward the next time said elbow rubbing had to occur between them.
“What, I did think it was a comet.”
But Potter has just given him facts, traces, what names and locations he could find himself. Important, of course, but not the whole picture. Not yet. It’s a spider web of intrigue for Draco to follow and get caught up in, and he knows he is. Like a fly tangled in silk, although far less helpless. He’s going in deeper voluntarily.
out like he’s poison, Draco is sure of that, but when he sees him between classes, Harry looks about as uncomfortable in there as Draco feels. Maybe it’s not the castle at all, but just their own skin they’re not so good at fitting into these days.
The door creaks gently, the faintest sound, as Draco pads into the room on bare feet. He’s shirtless; Harry can see him well enough by the light of his bedside lamp, casting them both into long shadows across the polished floors. Harry doesn’t move from his position at the end of his bed, leaning back on one hand and legs spread wide. Curiously, he doesn’t feel any embarrassment at Draco seeing him like this. If anything, he’d spread his legs wider if he could.
Convincing Cat to hop into the bike basket is, as predicted, not an outcome Cat is remotely interested in pursuing. Harry tries luring her with tuna. He tries luring her with a sardine. He tries using a sprat, gags, and then has to wash his hands for ten minutes because oh lord, he smells like the arse end of a fish market now, how lovely. Cat remains unmoved, and eventually Harry gives up and Transfigures the breadbin into a cat carrier, shoves a few tea towels in it, and unceremoniously but gently plonks the cat inside too. She doesn’t fight it or seem really that fussed, which is both nice and also deeply annoying for Harry’s now sprat-scented soul, but whatever. He trundles into town, narrowly pranging into only two privet hedges, and finds out from the vet that Cat is a) not microchipped or listed as missing, b) not pregnant (thank Merlin) and c) absolutely looking for a home. Harry tries not to feel smug when he pops Cat (name still pending, he’s working on it, really) back into her makeshift carrier and prepares to message Draco all about how he’s now a responsible and loving cat owner and Draco was wrong when he said this was just Harry procrastinating from working on his book. Turns out, it was both.
“Fuck, what are we doing.”
," Harry groans as Draco keeps his fingers at that spot, curling them up towards the ceiling in a beckoning motion. He pulls them out again after a moment, starting a steady rhythm and keeping Harry on the edge. "Fuck, that's―" Harry doesn't finish, gasping at the ceiling instead.
He knows it’s his fuck up. He shouldn't have gotten carried away and sent Draco such a word vomit of feelings and gibberish. For all that his life has felt like it’s covered way more than the average adult wizard’s has, he knows he’s got fuck all experience when it comes to relationships and being emotionally healthy in any way when it comes to his feelings. Knowing this doesn’t help the fact that he’s just tanked one of the most unexpectedly important friendships in his life, in spectacularly awkward fashion.
“H’rry?” Draco mumbled, pushing up onto his elbows and looking only about 23% awake. His hair was sleep-messy and ruined, sticking up one one side like a particularly blond feather duster
"Unlikely." Draco sits up a little straighter, an idea forming in his head. It’s wonderful, and terrible, and he can already feel he’s going to act on it. He hasn’t been this excited by something in months. Years. "Not for someone like me."
"Yeah, but not playing it professionally. Hated all the crowds, and the pressure." Ginny makes a gagging face, then pretends to shudder. "So I quit, and I got a lot of sad looks from people, and disappointed ones too. But it was worth it. I felt so much lighter afterwards." She pats Harry’s thigh. "I’m not telling you what to do, love. Just, making sure you know that, like. Saying no is an option, for your meeting on Thursday. A real actual one. Keep that in mind, yeah?"
“Merlin, like an old raisin that’s been marinating in a sock.” Draco’s mouth stretched open, his face twisting into a grimace as he shuddered.
Potter gives nothing away when Draco tells him he’s found his mystery person. For all that he confessed he trusts Draco, Potter remains guarded and elusive when it comes to divulging what his purpose is, what he's seeking from Darya and her ilk.
Of course, he doesn’t exactly want Potter to know that. For this purpose, Draco’s gone for deceptively casual: tight black jeans and laced-up leather boots, a white top with a muted flower design at the chest, and his favourite tan leather jacket. It’s not as nice as the leather jacket Potter was wearing the first night they saw each other. Draco would even go as far as to bet Potter’s is real dragon leather, which is not something easy to come by these days. Draco’s is worn and soft though, artfully made to appear decades older than it is. It suits the pale of his skin and the Nordic blond of his hair. It cost him a mint and he looks amazing. Potter need only to be aware of that final element.
Potter is not late; Draco is early. They’ve arranged to meet Darya here, in a private room (
Draco has two jobs, ostensibly. On the one hand he handles houses which contain magical artefacts or signatures, curse damage, old and malfunctioning wards and protections, malignant plumbing and, one time, a whole bunch of actual poltergeist activity.
He wasn’t even going to think about the time he’d spilled his tea on some paperwork and actually
The Healer leans back in his chair then taps the feathered end of the quill against the small ink jar nearby. His mouth twists pensively. “Because there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,” he quotes.
It’s a beautiful morning―or, it was. It is now a beautiful afternoon, and Harry has done fuck all, all day. Well, he’s texted Draco back and forth. Maybe his next novel could just be a series of texts, an examination of an enmity turned friendship turned let’s-annoy-each-other-constantly-over-wizarding-social-media. People might read that. Maybe? Harry would personally rather lick a Hippogriff, but you never know. There’s a market for everything.
"Give me five days," he says with feeling. "Five days and I'll find them."
For the briefest moment, their eyes meet. It's not for long, merely seconds even. Just a glance barely shared. It's too much for Draco. He knows Harry recognises him. Draco hasn't changed much. He's striking, if not pretty, and he always will be. He was striking well before vampiric blood ever touched his lips. He's sure he looks the same as the boy Harry loathed at school.
"Nothing!" Potter stands still, but his body is still radiating a restless and unhappy energy. He lifts his hands in a helpless gesture then lets them fall back to his sides.
"I trust you," Potter replies. It's equally as stunning as Draco's blurted thanks, and ten times as unexpected. Draco doesn't know how to react. He thinks maybe it's just lip service but Potter's face looks sincere, serious. The words hit Draco hard and potent. He wants to be worth that trust, however deeply Potter means it. Draco thinks it must be quite a bit; Potter doesn't strike Draco as someone who trusts on a whim.
in the morning. Draco likes to say it was the shock of seeing Harry sat on his sofa, but they both know it was the third bottle of bubbles. Besides, Harry had to stay over. He couldn't expect the babysitter to stay the night, and Harry was more than happy to entertain Scorpius in the morning. Truth be told, Draco probably threw up because he felt so guilty about getting sloshed when he had Scorpius to look after. Harry wasn’t going to judge him; he didn’t know the first thing when it came to parenting. Scorpius always looked happy when Harry saw him, so Draco must be doing it right.
Across from him, Draco looked puffy-eyed and sleepy, his cheek creased from the pillow and his mouth twisted in that soft little half-smile he always wore when he was just waking up and hadn’t remembered that he was raised to always look haughty and like he had half a lemon stuck up his nose. His hair was sticking up on the side he’d slept on, an enthusiastic testimony to how well Draco had been sleeping, and his skin was warm as he rested his bare shoulder against Harry’s. Harry’s cock twitched and he stifled a groan, lifting one leg to try and hide it. He felt the tickle of Draco’s hair as he turned, then kissed the bump of Harry’s shoulder.
Harry had meant to make a comment on the fact that Draco’s guestrooms have cold floorboards while he himself is rolling around on thick pile carpets, but the thought wisps away from his mind as he watches Draco. Harry realises, with a clench of his belly, that this is the first time he’s seen Draco naked. He lets his eyes trail down over Draco’s chest, past the faint scars he’s seen before and along the trail of dark blond hair low on his belly that leads to the thatch of hair between his legs. His cock looks heavy, large even while soft. He’s slim, still, his body lean and wiry like Harry expected. Harry feels a dull throb of arousal as he looks him over. When he returns his eyes to Draco’s face, he’s watching Harry back, faint amusement in his eyes and his wand in his hand. Before Harry can speak, Draco casts a soft cleaning charm over them both. Harry feels his skin prickle up into goosebumps in its wake, the pleasant tingle of the charm scouring him clean, like his body’s been dipped in gentle toothpaste. Draco sets his wand down on the chestnut bedside table, beneath a lamp that matches the one in Harry’s room.
And the next.
He's fucked.
Draco tilts his head at Potter when he mentions his
Harry lasted about two months of glaring sullenly at Draco whenever they both happened to be at the same event, before he realised it was getting in the way of actually enjoying the parties. And, it was making his face look really squinty and jawliney in the bad way in all the event photos. By the time Harry’s first book was published, he and Draco weren’t speaking, but they were nodding across the room, and by the time Harry’s second novel was out they’d had all of three conversations, and quite pleasant ones too. They had also had a really fabulous yelling match in the back garden of Sandra Kernig’s (budding fiction author) fancy London house. Harry had been slightly too drunk to remember the details of what set it off, but it started at the canapes when someone mentioned the war, and ended near the coy carp pond with both Harry and Draco
“ ― in six month's time, when you are heavy with my child.”
The first name feels foreign on his tongue, and equally as thrilling.
It felt like a friendship was inevitable after that night, Harry seeing Draco at his probable worst and Draco in turn not reacting badly to this. As fighting a troll forged a bond between Harry, Hermione and Ron, so did holding Draco's hair out of his face while he upchucked make Harry warm to him a surprising amount. Fatherhood suited him, and hanging out with Draco suited Harry. The fancying part came later, and was inconvenient but not the end of the world. There are times, even, when Harry wonders if it would be so bad to just tell Draco he likes him, that Draco wouldn’t mind or that he already even knows. Draco certainly gets a kick out of talking about made-up trysts they've had.
"Okay. Look." Ginny tucks her hair behind both ears, chin-length bob swinging slightly. She holds her hands out palms up. The sunlight glints off her silver rings and bangles. "You know I love you, right?"
Harry smiled. “You too.” He closed his eyes, warm in his cocoon of blankets and Draco. It would get too hot soon, the blankets would end up on the floor and Harry's hair would end up in Draco’s mouth, but for now it was perfect.
,” Draco repeated, batting his foot against Harry’s head. Harry ran his hand contemplatively over the back of Draco’s thighs, felt the firm muscle and the catch of the hair on them.
Draco’s frown is anything but. “Hang on, so this is common, then? People getting pinged by passing stars?”
"Maybe." Harry presses his forehead against Draco's. "I think I'd like to hear it?" he admits. His voice is low with arousal, but he can hear the tremor in it. He knows Draco will hear it, too.
Potter smiles, quickly, then adjusts his glasses. It could be a nervous habit. Draco wishes he knew him well enough to be able to read it properly.
"Oh, Harry." Ginny sighs, then kisses him on the temple. "You’re the bravest person I’ve ever met, and the kindest person, too. You’re such a good friend to me. Just. Be a bit kind to
“Mmm.” Draco kissed the back of Harry’s neck again, then down to his nape. “Might say that, yes.”
“For the most part, yes. Now, if you would like to make arrangements for where you will stay, we can get you there quickly and safely. It’s far too late and dangerous to have you Apparate, not after this kind of an evening. Duty of care, and all that, you know.” The Healer waves a hand if he’s swatting away midges.
The difference between then and now feels vast. It feels earned, as well; Draco is not the same person he was then. Potter, asleep in Draco's bed in a messy sprawl, is not the same boy either. Draco revels in these differences, in the opportunity he sees there. He feels galvanised this evening after Potter's revelations and Draco's most recent dream. Things make more sense, pieces for Draco to try and put together to make a solid picture. This is, after all, what he does. He investigates, he solves things.
you?" Potter’s voice lifts a little, incredulous. "Do you need the money? Are you that hard up for work?" His words are somewhat harsh, but the tone of his voice isn’t. Potter just looks wary and genuinely confused.
"Well, you walked in here with a cat and you’ve been avoiding everyone for a fortnight, so. Not too hard to piece together." Ginny pats his hand. "Do you want to talk about it?" she offers sympathetically. "By which I mean, which one would you like to talk about first, because we’re talking about this before you leave here today, whether I have to ply you with more fruity cocktails or not."
“Oh, whatever,” Draco waved a hand, adjusting the pillow underneath him and getting comfortable. “I was conceived quickly, and easily ―”
Harry’s children's book, about a garden-traipsing cat and the two enemies-turned-friends who solve crimes with her and with illustrations by one Dean Thomas, is a massive, massive hit.
"Yeah." Harry means to say more, something blithe or a joke, but he's already rocking his hips back against Draco's fingers, taking them in deeper. Draco's hand feels like a brand against the back of Harry's thigh as he leans against it, holding Harry open for him.
Draco does rest his hand on Potter's knee now, just lightly. Potter takes a long moment before he responds, which Draco takes as positive. He hates being so dire, so dramatic. All the same, he isn't exaggerating.
Draco lets Potter sleep. He seems like he needs it, has barely moved at all in the hour or so Draco has been awake and reading at his desk. He's tried not to watch Potter sleep, of course; Potter's right, it would be creepy, no matter how besotted Draco may feel right now.
"I want." Draco hums, closing his eyes as Potter kisses over the dip of his throat. His cock is aching, trapped in his jeans. "I want whatever you want to do," he answers honestly. He'd be embarrassed about how easy he's being, but he can find it in himself―especially not when Potter is being even easier, dropping to his knees in front of Draco.
Potter takes a moment before he speaks. "No one has ever been a living Horcrux before," he says, his face still tilted up now to look at the stars. "At least, no one who survived to talk about it. It’s done… it’s done something to me." Potter sucks on his lower lip. His eyes are bright. "It took us a while to notice, or to make the connection, really. The people around me, who I was close to, started having these dreams." Potter shakes his head as if bewildered. "Something in the room with them. Watching them. At first we thought it was the war, the aftermath. Ron and Hermione and Ginny lost people, everyone did. It made sense they would have nightmares." Potter shrugs. "But they kept happening. Scared the crap out of them when they realised they were all having the
"Do you like Berlin?" Draco watches the twirl of his quill and fights to keep his pulse steady.
Potter's laugh sounds shocked. "A bit, yeah." He bites his lip, then lets out a sigh. This time it sounds less heavy. There's almost a tone of excitement in it now.
Harry gives up on the giddy grinning and just kisses Draco instead.
He sat right next to Harry on the dirt, his back against the clear glass greenhouse walls, sat next to him as if they hadn’t spent years hating each other, bickering and yanking on metaphorical pigtails and spitting hexes. As if Harry hadn’t pulled Draco out of the Fiendfyre and as if Draco hadn’t known exactly who Harry was at the Manor. He sat next to him as if that was something he was allowed to do, and something Harry might want, even though he looked wretched and bleary-eyed and Draco hadn’t slept the night through in weeks. He sat next to Harry, shoulder to shoulder and pulled his cloak around himself, until Harry eventually shuffled closer to steal Draco’s warmth and Draco dropped the edge of his cloak over Potter, too.
He feels quite proud of that message, really, conveying annoyance on Draco's behalf and hopefully hiding that he was properly worried about him. Harry smiles, satisfied he’s covered his arse here.
"Mm." Draco splays his hands across Harry's hips. Unexpectedly, he pulls Harry closer to the edge of the bed, until his arse is almost hanging off it. "Alright then." He plants a kiss on Harry's arse cheek, then moves to the other and does the same. Harry squirms, trying not to disrupt him but wanting to get closer all the same.
“I asked first, Malfoy” he says, voice low, rather than mention any of this to Draco. It’s too new, too uncertain. How does he say,
“And second, your parents have been married now for thirty years, so I think someone needs to revisit that math.”
“Mmm. Read it.” Draco watches as Harry unfolds the parchment scroll, his expression curious more than apprehensive. That settles the spike of worry in Harry’s gut a little.
about it.
"Right, well." She flicks the kettle on with one long finger, then Summons a teacup towards herself. "Let’s have it, then."
"Ah." Harry lets his arms fall back to his sides. Right. So, that’s a no on the convincing beaming, then. Harry sags in his chair, relieved at not having to fake productivity at least. He blows a loud raspberry, at his book, at the universe, at his writer’s block. And all over the table in front of him.
They both turn to look at him.
Harry nods, rubbing the small bottle between both palms and then offering it to Draco. “This might help.” He presses it against Draco’s thigh when Draco doesn’t move to take it. “It’s Murtlap Essence,” Harry goes on. “It’ll make it feel a bit better, and help, like. If it’s sore. It’ll help you leave it alone.”
