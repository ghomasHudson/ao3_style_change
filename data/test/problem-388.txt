The snake takes a deep breath, Draco’s shaking next to him and is definitely going to kill him when he finds out that Harry basically just signed them up to heal a Deadly Dangerous Snake that they may or may not be able to heal. Maybe Draco and Hermione can team up and make a detailed book of all the things he does that pisses them off. It’d be a bestseller in
There’s a wet laugh, a sound that makes Harry’s heart break a little bit more. “He’ll be in a right state when he wakes up.” Molly says. “I’m just-if Harry hadn’t found him-”
“Well the Ministry is full of idiots. I suppose we can’t very well say that to their faces, though.”
“No harm done?!” She seethes, answering his question, “I nearly killed them and I-I would’ve killed you if you hadn’t stunned me! I had no control! I was a danger to everyone, including Gabbi!”
He doesn't please, actually, he kinda hates where he’d ended up, but at least his lesson might actually be learned this time. Godric knows
“Nonsense, Draco, that’s just a side effect of having a friend who’s always on some sort of suicide mission.”
“I is not doing magic with it sir!” Winky cries, “I just be picking it up….but I do not be knowing how to conjure the Dark Mark, sir! Winky wouldn’t dare!”
hi! i'm not dead yet! but lmao at the last chapter notes being like 'i'm on a posting schedule' and then me forgetting about this story entirely because of a new obsession :) I'm currently writing the next chapter, but i'll be honest and say idk when it's going to be posted. blame my mental illness. the plot is completed, but now i have to write it and that's...a lot lol. anyways, hope you enjoyed the chapter!
It all passes so quickly they nearly forget about Buckbeak until Draco, along with Crabbe and Goyle, round a corner and see Harry talking to Minster Fudge. Given how pale his scarred friend looks, Draco doesn’t think they’re discussing the weather. He feels sick.
The room supplies nearly everything except food and a clock, so when their stomachs do finally start rumbling they make a real, brain powered, decision to leave. According to the grand clock in the common room, they were right on time for lunch.
“I think not, Miss Parkinson.” The trio turns to see Snape looming over them, eyebrow raised and sneer in place, “You’ll have to conduct your activities without Mr. Malfoy, as he will be coming with
The old coot is waiting behind his desk and before Draco can rant and rave at him, a small ball of white tackles him into a chair.
secret to Hogwarts and exploit it like it was his right. And, because he really forgets to think things through, he had found himself almost dying in a secret room all over again, at least this time it was because of a giant snake and not a trusted professor. A giant snake, and a bloody diary of all things. Kept under lock and key- not a normal key of course, more like a password that was rather simple for a parselmouth like himself- and distributed by Lucius Malfoy no less. The same Malfoy that kicked and hit Dobby right in front of him and once again, because he rarely thinks his ideas over- he should probably work on that- he’d snuck the elf a sock and freed him, almost gotten cursed, and managed to anger the man who wanted to kill him most, well most after Voldemort himself.
Draco barely conceals a flinch, luckily his teammates bunch up for him, getting slightly closer which gives him the courage to feel something other than burning shame; anger.
And sure, the Firebolt that Harry gets from a ‘mysterious admirer’ during dinner annoys him just a bit because he knows how annoying Quidditch will be next year, but he can’t fight the smile tugging at his lips when he sees the look of pure joy on Harry’s face.
“Because he believes Hagrid has opened the chambers...just like last time they are forcing the blame on an innocent soul.”
“You know,” Blaise says, narrowing his eyes, “I’ve heard Hippogriff wounds are supposed to be jagged, funny that yours is a straight line. It almost looks like a knife wound.”
Draco turns to the group, grabbing whoever’s hand is nearest. “Link hands! We can’t be separated! We’re going to have to run but you
later and his stag appears. For some weird reason, the others look at him funny. Oh well, he can worry about that later.
“I’m sorry.” Dumbledore says, pulling away from him but keeping one hand on his shoulder. LuLu paces between Potter and Draco, rubbing them both and looking at them with worried eyes.
“Yes Sir,” Winky replies, “Misses Geia has the contraption Misses Hermione made for Mister Harry, and I already be bringing your things to your rooms, sir.”
Lucius laughs, honest to fucking laughs, with Harry sitting on his plush white carpet. “Yes, well, the younger elves are very different to the elder ones. That Winky is in a league of her own, did Draco tell you she’s been making Malfoy uniforms?”
Blaise rushes forward, grabbing his arm in a particularly painful way and twists it until he can see it. Harry has no idea why this is happening, it literally just looks like a bunch of curly drawings to him, but he does know that Blaise is
“A Goblin Friend?” Misty gives him an awed sort of look. It makes Draco uncomfortable. “Mister Draco, you really are amazing.”
“Tell me, Professor,” he lowers his voice, “Tell me that insufferable git isn’t really the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. He’s a show pony at best, one of the girls will probably jump him before break. Not to mention that a half-wit has more of a brain than he can hope for.”
In his humble, totally unbiased opinion, leaving the bed when someone else was inside it should be illegal. Leaving the bed when
“I decided to take him with me to the headmaster’s office, Dumbledore is bound to have books that might help, if all else it will bore him to sleep.”
They freaked out, according to Theo, and gathered up as many people as they could to storm the Manor ruins.
The point, the real one, is that this is weird behavior for Harry. Harry, who just realized the person he saw die was his mate’s mum. Less saw and more experienced, really, which just makes the whole thing worse.
He’s grateful, so very thankful that sometimes he gets choked up about it. Even in the little tasks, like having tea with Narcissa, baking with Mrs. Wealsey, getting caught in Mr. Wealsey’s and Lucius’s debates, even just hanging out with his friends is enough to get his heart all mushy.
Then he’s moving, suspended by nothing. Lucius takes him to a familiar room where the air is colder than the snow falling outside. His wand is removed and put right by the window, a taunt no doubt, because then Draco is stripped to a thin t-shirt and shorts, and thrown into the room with ten Dementors. He’s too busy screaming to hear it lock.
Draco glares at Blaise, but it doesn’t do much besides make his friends snicker and reduce him to a smiling mess. Pansy hooks her arm into his free one, “Think about it like this, it’s still Halloween….we still have time for a few last minute pranks.”
His parents’ room is furthest down on the West Wing because it’s the biggest and his mother loves the view.
Harry straightens, watching in his mind as wavy dark curls come bounding in, demanding Geia stop threatening her and be quiet, only to turn and get angry.
The only person that might come close to that is June. So, Draco swivels in his chair, fully prepared to go deal with some horrifying potion mishap, and then freezes on the spot.
Oh fuck, even Blaise and Pansy look a little upset. But, if they’ve taught him anything it's to leave wiggle room.
“Headmaster-” he begins as soon as he steps foot in the office, a mistake really, given that Dumbledore is holding a paper with a grave look that stops him in his tracks.
Without giving Draco time to respond Madam Pomfrey returns, bandages and ointment in tow. It doesn’t hurt nearly as much as he thought it would, as a matter of fact it’s over in the blink of an eye and she leaves the two males alone, as if sensing that a private conversation needed to be had.
He doesn’t like the twinkle he gets back, “It is wise to never say never, afterall, no one can truly see the future, can they?”
“You’ve been quizzing me on History facts so much it hurts. I’m going to bed now, are you coming or staying until I have to drag you?” Blaise sounds like he’s two seconds from falling over, so Draco nods.
The mess of making ‘Potter Stinks’ badges for all of Hogwarts in the Gang’s Room. They had to leave dinner early for this.
“What other creatures are you going to bring into my home, hm? Is there a book to control that little stunt of yours inside the Potter Vault?”
“Where is he?!” Hermione yells. He’s the first to come through, followed by Blaise, Theo, Pansy, and Lucius.
“Don’t worry,” Draco mumbles to them, watching himself get snarled at, “It only gets worse from here.”
Draco starts to make a comment about that not being particularly surprising, but then Dumbledore walks through the door and he has to bite his tongue. He learned a few months ago how much fun pissing off a powerful wizard is, and once is honestly more than enough.
Draco just shrugs, pulling Luna in with him and making a b-line for Fleur’s room. It’s on one of the highest levels because she’s a seventh-year and at the top of most of her classes, all the way to the right because Madam Maxiene knows she loves fresh light in the morning. Spoiled is what she is, and rightfully so, in his humble opinion.
And from that point on Draco completely ignores the rest of the world for the day. Gabbi leaves tomorrow, so they spend the entire time playing games and talking late into the night. Gabbi tells them about Cousin Apolline and Cousin Monnie. She tells them that Grandma Aimee is coming to visit the second she gets back and yes, she’s just as furious as the rest of them. Apparently she’s already thanked Harry for saving her life when they went to visit Hagrid yesterday, which is great because Draco’s kinda thrilled at the idea of his family getting along with his boyfriend.
Draco makes a noise somewhere between a choke and a laugh. “Draco, huh? You do realize Weasley is going to have a heart attack when he hears me calling you Hermione.”
It takes a second to realize what they’re saying….what was done to them. Snape can’t look their way, instead gazing at his desk.
Draco’s always liked Kingsley. Kingsley is fair, if Draco still had the right to vote he’d be singing Kingsely’s praises to every ear that listened. Kingsley didn’t
When the man asks for a private space, when hands start wandering over him, when he finds himself apparated into a small bedroom, when his knees hit the back of bed, when the man consumes him from above.
Harry rolls his eyes, “Right...well, you prat, that paper is actually this weird map of the school, lets me see names of people in real life and all that.”
Regardless of whether or not she sees him on Monday, Carla will send a Patronus to him on Tuesday so the two of them, and June, can meet for lunch. That usually leads to a potions lessons for June, or a stupid debate with Carla that Draco pretends to hate. Sometimes Howie or Mrs. Daisy will join them, there was even one time that Mrs. Alice sat with them through tea and finger cakes.
“You literally rebuilt the Prynne House, and I recall Misty mentioning that you built her a greenhouse?”
to sleep at night. Contrary to what you believe, you alone are not responsible for Harry’s safety. This is why we have a team, why I told people about your existence, so that one person would not carry the burden alone.”
“Merlin I’m so excited to see you out of these! When Draco said we were taking you shopping we just had to come, advice and all that.”
“Yep!” She plops down next him, lying back on the floor so their heads are side by side. “When Mister Draco got here he wouldn’t say a word, but ever since Mister Draco’s friend be coming, Mister Draco be saying
He sees them every day, sees each of his other friends once a week, and visits with the Pyrenees every full moon.
One last plan is in place for the night, just a small fun surprise for Snape. Maybe moving a few of his pictures, or putting a sign in his potion’s room. Something small and harmless that wouldn’t get them in too much trouble. He’s walking arm in arm with Blaise and Pansy, the rest trailing behind them as the plan starts to come together. So focused on the best way to get under Snape’s skin, Draco almost walks right into a bunch of Ravenclaws standing and staring at something.
will stop me from training you? Do you think it will stop the Dark Lord from taking whatever he wants from you?!
to be. Even in the old days, they were hunted and stolen from. But when they aren’t defending their own, they’re surprisingly funny. Loyal, kind, and willing to die for their friends. Harry’s looking forward to meeting
It’s enormous, big enough to get lost in for days. On the first floor is where they keep most books, Lucius’s study is towards the front, though the whole room is filled with natural lights from big windows. Bookshelves made from British Elms, soft off-white carpets, matching rose chairs, couches, and fainting spots enough for anyone, plus too many books to read in one lifetime. It’s been one of his favorite rooms since he was small.
“Plants are cool,” Harry agrees. They stand up and walk to where Blaise and Ron are waiting, Pansy and Hermione behind them. Draco hands Harry off to Ron, hugs Hermione goodnight, and then lets his own friends tug him down to the dungeons.
“Miss Alex?” The elf whispers, tears streaming down her face. Draco smells a storm coming. It descends upon them out of nowhere, the breeze, no,
So when Crouch, officially deemed Big Asshole in Draco’s mind, turns to his elf he can feel himself gearing up to do something stupid.
They manage to cut him off at the last second and for the first time since he started school, Draco’s head feels wonderful. He’s sitting in his cabin, Crabbe and Goyle too stupid to make conversation that makes any form of sense, and Blaise too involved in some book to bother talking. Staring out the window, watching the scenery pass by, it’s calming. Comforting. Something about the green hills and clear sky eases his mind and his anxiety. It’s nice enough for Pansy to look up and smile at him. “Enjoying yourself, Draco?”
Harry does put the cat down...on his lap that is. He absently pets her and wonders what Malfoy is up to right now. He’d been forced home, which sucked for him because break would’ve been the perfect time to corner the blonde and force him to fess up. Not actually hating Malfoy was weirder than...well everything.
Of course, because Draco stayed, Theo stayed, saying he didn’t want to be left at the Malfoy Manor by himself all break. That led to Blaise and Pansy staying over, and really, the Black Manor is big, but Harry has no idea how they’ve managed to fit so many people.
Theo, who was the quietest of all his Slytherins. Nose constantly in a book, smiles hidden behind pages. He was the most withdrawn, and Draco didn’t consider him a friend until fourth year, honestly. Granted, war tends to bring people closer and Theo
I have several ocs in it, like the gossipy shopkeepers (I would die for Mrs. Daisy) and a house elf (Misty, my love) who whoops draco into shape. Kingsely also has a big role in it, as do various gryffindors and slytherins. I won't spoil too much, but I'm gonna be posting the first two chapters of it on March 5th so I hope you're just as excited!!!
“And you’re eighteen.” Theo says, like Draco needs reminding. “No offense to you, Madam, but Draco! You’re barely a young adult! You shouldn’t be acting like-” He spares a glance to Mrs. Daisy, quickly choosing a new set of words. “Like a burned out Ministry employee!”
He waves them both away, “Please, you’re hungry from your travels. I won’t be long, do save me something from Crabbe and Goyle if you can.”
“Well, we’re no longer pretending to be evil, and Arthur Weasley seems to think he’s in our debt, so I was wondering if the house would collapse if we had a few Weasley’s and a muggle-born over.”
“Did you see?!” He says, turning excitedly to Fleur who hugs him and shouts something in French. Draco turns back to the steps where everyone else is frozen, and then he too freezes. Silver meets Green and for a second Harry almost believes Draco isn’t even that upset about the whole ‘missing’ thing.
me. I was amazed...and then we got inside and I met this arrogant little prick who had the audacity to talk about my first ever friend like the Dursley’s talked about me.”
They stand beside him, just far enough so they can make out the shapes down at Hagrid’s huts. Draco makes a mental note to spend more time with them, he’s sure it will fit into his schedule.
They’re walking back from the Astronomy tower where they had spent a few hours sharing stories about break. Pansy got new robes, all the chocolate she could dream of, some makeup her mother swore was the best wizarding kind had to offer, and a trip to the Bahamas. Blaise was similar, although he got a new broom and a collection of wizard fiction he fully intended on watching late at night. Draco had gotten his owl with presents the day after Christmas, filled with trinkets from Paris, a new ebony comb, and a diamond necklace his mother had the other part to. His father had sent him new robes and a silk scarf. He may have considered throwing them away before putting them both on and facing his friends.
Harry mumbles something. He’s looking at the entrance to the bathroom, they’re so close Draco can taste air that doesn’t make him want to throw up, he can hear Myrtle sighing like a love-struck first year, but they can’t leave this conversation unfinished.
Draco doesn’t care for most of them, doesn’t care for the telly at all, really, but he dutifully watches it with her every Thursday night, each of them working on their respective sides of their tapestry.
the lights hang in the sky despite it being night, see the way trees glow, feel the softness of the grass on his skin, the rush of flight, the security of hanging in a purple-flower nest.
“This,” he explains, “Is a potion to quell anxiety. I used it much in my early days of a spy, and I was a fool to think you wouldn’t need it. One sip of that will get you feeling back to normal, and I’ll teach you how to brew it in our study sessions beginning Monday. Do not protest, Draco, I have suddenly realized how much I have been lacking in guidance to you. You are too young to do this without my help, and I’m sure Albus warned you last year of how taxing it can be, I am sorry to have overlooked the possibility of it overwhelming you, and it will not happen again.”
perfecting his mask because if someone saw through it they would kill him. He spent so many afternoons training, then half way participating in raids, torture, even murder before he was allowed to go back to Hogwarts.
“No!” Thank everything he doesn’t sound like a dying toad now, “Dumbledore will have questions and I frankly don’t have answers at the moment.” Draco groans, “He’ll probably rummage through my memories, dammit...Wait a minute!” he turns a sharp gaze on the scruffy boy in front of him, “Why the hell did he leave
They take another sip of tea and honestly, if it’s going to be this easy, Draco’s quite sure he can do this all day long. Naturally Dumbledore’s follow up question fucks that idea over.
Draco continues like he didn’t hear them at all, “Slytherins work in trades, okay? Carla, you cleared something in me that I didn’t know was blocked. Be it magic, emotional, or physical. I don’t know and I don’t care, but what I
Narcissa rolls her eyes, taking another sip of tea before recrossing her legs. “We have more important things to discuss than me killing your father.”
attractive, so of course I said yes when he asked me. I told Daph, when the three of us were getting ready for bed, but apparently
“Because I have to. If I don’t go back, he’ll know something is wrong. I can’t have him knowing the type of information I give Dumbledore, do you understand why I didn’t want to tell you anything now? What you just saw is kind compared to what he would do if he knew.”
parents, and the next you’re standing by my hospital bed? You’re bloody mental! Make up your mind, do you want to ruin my life or save it?!”
Fred and George are laughing at him now, thank Godric Ginny finds Luna’s hair more interesting than this conversation.
“Then we do!” Draco snaps, a little too violently for the situation. Awkwardness hangs between them for a moment, and then Harry pats at the space beside LuLu. Draco sits down in it, wrapping himself up in the blanket and getting a little embarrassed about his outburst until Harry lightly touches his arm.
“And who’s to say they would do the same this time? Harry’s meant to kill the Dark Lord, that’s all we know for certain. The rest of it no one has a clue about. Other kids could already be casting their alliances, being trained in the Dark Arts, there’s no telling how many enemies are out there already.”
They all laugh when Blaise sends a pillows flying towards Ron’s head. Naturally that leads to a giant pillow fight, and Winky does drop in with a very needy LuLu that she deposits in the small space between Draco and Harry. Granted, that space doesn't last for very long before Draco and LuLu are both curled up on his stomach, his friend’s even breathing filling the room until he feels himself drifting off somewhere warm.
That Ron seems to understand, kinda. He doesn’t fully get it but the clock strikes four and he gets up to go. “Mum wanted me to de-gnome the garden before it gets dark.”
“Since you answered so intelligently before, I believe you can understand why they’re so useless now.”
“Scared?” Draco mouths, if Potter is, they can put this whole thing behind them and Draco can count this as a new way to release the tension in his head. Of course, the dumbass has to mutter back “You wish”, meaning they
Dumbledore physically pales, something he never thought the man capable of. Snape shakes his head, another very bad sign. “The Chamber? Surely not, I thought that was a myth Albus.”
“Life is a mystery, darling, if we question every weird thing we see we’d be at this table for the next ten years.”
“What is it?” Hermione asks. The twins have suddenly become interested in the conversation again, even Ginny is looking up from Luna’s sleeping little face.
Harry says automatically, then he turns to Draco who is standing way too close for comfort and nods.
Their group crammed into one table in Honeydukes, laughing around mugs of sodas and pretending like the outside world didn’t exist. He did go ahead and buy LuLu a few sweaters just because he didn’t know when their next trip would be and he couldn’t have his little light walking around cold. Pansy and Blaise had made fun of him the whole time until they returned and saw her in a cashmere one and proceeded to
The little cottage, the one that strikes such warmth into him bursts into flames. His body follows, he doesn’t even realize Riddle had a match until the flames lick up his legs and it hurts
Draco hangs his head, the light pinch already building up behind his brow, but he can’t worry about that now, not when his father is calling him down to the ground floor for tea with the family portraits. It’s almost like talking to demons, but it’s never enough to crack his perfected smile, and even better façade. He feels almost bad for sending the elf off without checking on him first. That morning, his father had been particularly cruel to anyone within three feet of him, it was unfortunate for both of them that neither had been allowed to leave his side until noon. Dobby was particularly hysterical, and gone off not much better. Which means there is a very big chance that Dobby will slip up, perhaps fail, maybe injure Potter by accident. The thought worries him until the elf’s return.
Draco takes it in stride, “Are they really going to kill him?” He lets an edge of worry creep into his voice, just so his act is a little more convincing.
It was raining outside, and Mrs. Zabini was ending another relationship so there was a lot of yelling during his and Blaise’s playdate. Blaise had been in a
“Yes?” He groans, barely keeping his irritation down. He’d learned the hard way that annoying a loyal house elf was never a smart decision.
can help. He steps back from the others, holding his wand high. There’s a moment where all of their eyes widen, but then he thinks of Geia’s story, falling asleep next to Draco, Sirius and Remus smiling through the fire, Ron and Hermione laughing with him in the common room.
Whoever it is will either force him out, sit with him like Misty, or (if he’s lucky) kill him on the spot.
“I was thinking Diagon Alley, school does start soon, don't give me that look, it’s not becoming of you. While we’re there, I’ve arranged a bit of a surprise, two actually. But they are surprises, Draco, your father doesn’t even know about them yet” Narcissa looks around, “Where
Narcissa is the only one not losing it. She silences the men with her and begins telling Harry things he never thought he’d hear from her.
Fleur’s room is neat as always, despite Gabbi being there for over an hour. If she’s anything like she was as a child she’ll have the place destroyed the second she wakes up. But he can worry about that later because right now he’s going to pull Fleur in for a long hug.
For a second Draco is a hundred percent sure his father is going to find a way to curse the twin with wandless magic, and then to his surprise Lucius softens. “You’re just children….”
The boy feigns hurt, leaving them both in fits of snickers, Crabbe and Goyle just mutter something about not getting it. Understanding reaches them a few days later when they all walk into the Great Hall and are bombarded with flowers of every kind in pink, hearts hanging from the sky, and one imbecile in the middle, smiling like it actually looks good.
He grabs one of his bottomless bags, throws everything he might need into it, his most comfortable clothes, his favorite blanket, the key to his private vaults, some odd bits and pieces he can’t function without, a few picture albums, his family ring, all the things that mean
A small abandoned home, about fifty feet from the sea. The fog clears around the area, like it’s welcoming Draco inside. Like it
stands right now, not exactly the time to be testing the waters, and it’s not exactly safe for them to be seen together even if Narcissa is secretly on their side.
“He’s always been off the deep end. No offense to you and yours but I always thought your mother could do better. At least before the Dark Lord he wasn’t all that bad, but after…”
It should feel weird to shower together, but they’ve been doing it since they were kids, and Blaise has already seen his scars so he doesn’t think anything of it until Blaise catches his wrist and holds it up.
Severus stops by before noon, sneering at them all while handing Arthur his potions and berating Harry for opening the door.
Narcissa stares at him with wide eyes for a second before she’s laughing. Bending at the waist and almost to the point of snorting, and then she moves forward, completely disregarding her wand and hugging him so hard he nearly suffocates.
Theo laughs a bit at Draco’s bitter tone. “A trade then. I help you with your stack, you go clubbing with me on Friday
There’s quite a lot, actually. He has his cot, the bag of clothes he’s allowed to wear with the Dursleys, Hedwig, and his trunk that may or may not be locked with his wand on the inside. Harry nods just once, and to his surprise Remus takes out his wand and shrinks Harry’s trunk, it looks like one of the dolls Dudley used to play with.
command, it could only be opened by brute force or by Harry. His mother had almost tried it, until the other
“Severus didn’t know Sirius like I did, he doesn’t know many things, including that the I was the person to inform Mr. Black of his two best friend’s deaths.”
“Mother doesn’t trust him to have it.” Draco whispers back right as some old man steps forward and Mr. Weasley tears into him. He suddenly has a whole new respect for the redhead clan.
Given his calculations, he’s a little surprised to hear Snape and Harry hissing at each other down the corridor.
and told him he was either helping her with paperwork or becoming an employee. Call him antisocial, but paperwork is
He only has a second to admire it before Misty is dragging him up, not even letting him appreciate how smooth the railing is on his hand.
He feels the familiar pull of Veritaserum right before the astonishment that his mother- his own pure and loving mother- used it on him. LuLu didn’t even warn him, the traitor.  Luckily he’s been learning how to deal with the potion for a while now.
Draco whirls on him, which is really a bad decision because he looks a little too cute this morning to be intimidating. Harry winces, now is so not the time. “Have you lost your mind?
Misty leads him through the rooms, on the left is an open sitting area, just big enough to overlap with the kitchen downstairs. The master bedroom and bathroom is in front of it, and Draco tries really, really,
The last bit isn’t lie, he does usually fall asleep the second his head hits the pillow, but his father had been keeping mail from him ever since Pansy invited him over for afternoon tea the next day. Couldn’t miss out on his torture sessions.
infuriated over the idiocy they displayed! They endangered more than just children today they….” She casts a glance at Harry and then stops talking all together.
She makes a fair point, so Harry stands, ignores the gasps coming from the crowd, and casually climbs on top of his sassy not-exactly-friend that can and will kill him if he makes a mistake. Except it’s not so casual and he does have to fucking climb her like one of those rock walls Dudley talked about after one of his birthday parties.
“Right, so. I don’t understand why Harry is still alive-okay I didn’t mean it like that but, think about it sir. Black has been around him so many times now, he was
He images Anvi, bowing in the same way, long curly hair in the dirt, and feels stronger. He can do this.
Draco puts his book to the side, picking up LuLu so he can carry her down to the main living room where his parents are.
“Clean this place up. Stop rotting away here, for Merlin’s sake you’re covered in dust and starving. Start making a life, I don’t care if you start brewing, or even if you get a new wand, but you’re going to stop killing yourself, do you understand me? You weren’t let go so you could die covered in dust.”
“Are you going to show me how it works, or just explain the theory?” Poppy asks with a little smile, and because he has the time before their morning Saturday rush, Draco grabs Frankie from his closet and the little pocket watch that used to be normal.
“How do you do it?” Granger asks after a while. “I mean, you and I are competing for top student, you’re doing extra Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, taking night watches to make sure Harry doesn’t get killed- and that’s impossible by itself- not to mention you’re having to keep all this hidden from your parents and you’ve still found time to help us try to save Buckbeak. I’m only taking twelve classes and-”
Draco and Theo both glance over to see Misty walk in, carrying Salem like he’s a log instead of a Kneazle.
also i had this idea that it's freaking halloween, it should be celebrating. and what better way to do that than dubious pranks among friends? (it's what i do to my friends on halloween, just without the magic bit.)
Speaking of Potions, that’s been a nightmare since he started his quest into Snape’s sex life. Honestly! He shouldn’t be punished for being curious, Severus literally brought this on himself. Sneaking around is bad enough, but the man hasn’t shown an interest in
to see what happened while he was gone. But, he knew everything else, why not include him on all of Draco’s dark little secrets. Maybe then he would shut the fuck up about what he
He could deny it, his chance is right here, he can make up some stupid excuse, it would be so easy to deny it. But Draco doesn’t say a word; he looks away. And that is an answer in itself.
October proved to put him in a happier mood the closer that Halloween got. His team did great, and Flit was exactly right about him being a great flyer. With only his team on the field, he could find and grab the Snitch in five minutes, and once he realized his father was probably just being a forgotten threat again, he found himself actually enjoying his studies. Pansy and Blaise kept him company in the library, and in the common room his teammates would sometimes stop by his table and join him in studying. Snape even complimented him for his good grades, albeit in a roundabout way, but a compliment all the same.
After not receiving a letter from his father for nearly a year, he had gotten one mere note demanding he come home for the holidays. Needless to say he didn’t trust it.

laughed at his expense from time to time. He loves Percy, despite his loyalty to the Ministry. He loves Chalire, even if all he knows about the man is his love for Dragons. He loves Bill, even if the man is kinda threatening. He loves Molly, even when she’s bad mouthing Sirius out of worry. He loves Arthur, despite his annoying questions about muggles.
Potter completely ignores him. “Is that where you were this morning? No, because Hagrid didn’t get back until lunch! Me, Ron, and ‘Mione were going to go visit him after dinner, but you went after lunch didn’t you?! That’s why you stormed off in a huff-”
Lucius gives him a bone-chilling smile before turning around and walking away, “Best get back to your chambers, son. Wouldn’t want people thinking
Ron stays close to Harry’s side that Draco isn’t occupying, leaving Hermione, Pansy, and his mother to talk about whatever girls talk about. If he’s honest he can’t really follow what Blaise and Ron are talking about when Harry’s nearly vibrating next to him.
Fleur looks at him with wide eyes, Luna just keeps smiling, like she’s watching something she’s already expected.
He forces a single necklace on Draco, the long one with a matching gem to Misty’s ocean necklace, a bracelet that apparently wards against things in his drink, and a ring to confuse anyone who gives him any unwanted attention. Smart, on Theo’s part, but it still makes Draco feel weird.
For obvious reasons like helping Harry figuring out what the fuck he’s going to face on Saturday, and ideas for his project. But also because Geia apparently thought adding a research topic to their list was fun. He’s somehow managed to rope Hermione in, and by that he told her about it in passing and she’s taken it as a personal challenge to find out everything she can.
Sirius has to agree with Dumbledore on that one. Never in his life could he have predicted this moment.
What was Potter’s worst fear? The Dark Lord? His friend’s dead? A Dementor? That would be a sight for the class, no matter which one of them came true. And what was Draco’s worst fear? Well that was obvious, but if he stayed at the back of the line long enough, he could avoid it. He's never been more thankful for Lupin when he steps in and saves the class from both Potter’s and his own worst fear.
“That won’t be necessary,” Draco quickly comes to his sense with his gawking exposed, “And I do believe it was
“You know you don’t have to be sneaky about it. Your mother and I don’t care if you eat in your room.”
Mrs. Daisy huffs, producing two bags stuffed full of goodies and treats for him and Misty. “For the road, then. Let me know if you like them, Dearie, and
“Good morning.” Draco chuckles. He pulls them both upright, dusts off his robes. “We do need to get going.”
That draws a snort out of Draco. Off hand he knows most the languages Blaise knows, all the pure bloods learn the basics. English, French, Italian, Spanish and German. Some of them went further, he and Pansy both know Latin and Portuguese. Some of his cousins know Japanese and Chinese, Hebrew and Korean. When your family has businesses and relatives all over the world you just pick up on things. Language and etiquette was just a part of life. Or it had been before he turned eleven.
After their respective melt downs, Granger gave them each a week to grieve. And then, on the third Sunday that Kingsley came to visit, Granger appeared at Pansy’s and Blaise’s apartment like some sort of wraith.
at Harry’s face and he’s angry all over again. No child should look this worn down. So sad, so tired, so defeated. There are bags under his eyes that rival Draco’s, his hands twitch constantly, hell he looks like Draco imaged himself looking when he was in Snape’s office only hours before. Anger is never a good emotion, it leads to people doing stupid things.
. From the beginning of how the Dark Lord is poisoning his father, thankfully he’s still in control enough to skip over most of the abuse, to how Potter is surely going to die before the end of the year and leave them all without protection from said evil maniac, ending with how much he truly does miss his mother and his father’s seemingly innocent warning.
All of them grimace at the thought, but Ellios continues. “A fleet of Aurors had just been taken down, I was a healer back then, out on the field with everyone who was not in a hospital. It was horrible, dead bodies on every corner, hospitals too filled for the sick…” They look out into the distance, William takes their hand and their eyes clear a little. “I was checking for live ones, people I could save, or at least hold over until I could get them to a medical base, and I found Severus. He was bleeding out behind a bar, stuck by a curse. The thing about being a healer, Draco, is that it does not matter who is hurt, you must heal them. Severus did not have his mask, but I saw the mark, and I healed him anyways because if I had not it would have been his blood on my hands.”
The group goes back to talking and the cat curls up in his lap, asleep at first. She nearly takes him out with her, the warmth always calming and fuck when did calm equal sleepy? Had he really been anxious the entire time he was awake? How long had this been going on? LuLu’s fur starts to toughen up and quickly pulls him out of his mind.. Draco looks around to see what’s wrong. His friends pick up on it, the whole lot looking for any sign of trouble.
“I is being Misty.” Misty says, bowing a little but not leaving Draco’s side. “Are you being a friend to Mister Draco?”
The anger is still there and making him want to do something stupid, like maybe punch the old geezer, or at least knock steaming tea on the freshly cleaned carpet, but he does have a point. Harry Potter had spent two years hating his guts, and it only took roughly thirty minutes and a violent exchange to change his mind. It would no doubt take roughly five minutes for him to become attached to his god-father, and he would raise hell at the thought of him being in prison. Clearly, Dumbledore had some plan to keep that from happening, but Draco still left the office annoyed and bothered. LuLu trotted along beside him, as if sensing that he wanted to be alone but also knew it wasn’t the wisest decision for him to be by himself. Who knows what trouble he would get into with his current mood.
“On the last try we left him dead for exactly one minute and then brought him back, positively ruined my new plans for the dungeons.”
Draco blinks at her. Tears welt up in his eyes, even though he hasn’t cried since he was sixteen and watching Albus Dumbledore fall off the Astronomy Tower. He doesn't know what possesses him to do it, but he falls to his knees and hugs her tight.
Blaise is one second away from cutting off his arm and putting it in a museum. “He….you’ve been...what?”
Lucius doesn’t suspect a thing. Draco feels an odd sense of pride at how easily and perfect his mother’s lie came. She truly is brilliant. His father takes the cup without suspecting a thing, one large swig later and he’s frowning.
All four of the champions were forced to the hospital wing after the match, shoved into the emergency wing and told to lie down. Since the hostages had been in cold waters for Godric knows how long, they were her first priority.
She fades out as the sea calms, and in her place is a faint blue light. Draco sees another out by the house, and when he turns around he finds one resting in Misty’s hands.
to do something to shut Draco up, and it works pretty well considering the boy gapes like a fish. Seizing his opportunity, Potter continues.
Instead he makes a face that sends a shiver of fear down Pettigrew’s spine. “If you try and touch me again I’ll make sure it’s your hands that go this time, not just a finger. You’re only moving to tell us the truth. Should you be stupid enough to lie or continue this pathetic sniffling I’ll shut you up and let the Dementors deal with you.”
Right... he thought that might be an issue. “I’m not sure. I was just told that I couldn’t access it.”
They stand in a secluded walkway between the field and the school, deserted enough that no one will hear their conversation, or him if he screams.
“Damn his father!” Snape cries, “Look at what that bastard has done to him! He’s barely alive, it will take him weeks to recover-”
Draco doesn’t gape at the response. He doesn’t, he just has to struggle to keep his mouth shut is all.
“I can’t be there, unfortunately, too many bad memories, which I’m sure is the reason for our meeting. Finally got out of that ol’ Manor, huh?”
Theo watches on with wide eyes as they bicker, like some sort of child watching their first tennis match.
Harry’s been thankful for Draco a lot at this point, but he’ll never be over the creepy smile the blonde gets right before destroying people, or in this case, ghosts.
Pans shakes her head, her hair feels nice on his arms. Like a faint tickle that he doesn’t feel an urge to scratch. “Not until you’ve eaten.”
Not what he’d like to die in, but beggars can’t be choosers, and Pansy is already marching back out of the tent so he’ll take it.
“Listen, Draco. Don’t let what they said get to you, alright? We all know you’re a good flyer, now we’ve just got to prove you’re more than money too.”
“Anyone?” Blaise and Draco ask at the same time. He looks at them like they’re insane, which only encourages them further.
“You can’t.” Draco tells him softly. A pale hand tucks a stray piece of hair behind Harry’s ear. “To cast an Unforgivable, you have to
“Afraid not,” Draco chuckles, “My skin is a little too perfect for that. Rotting flesh and maggots don’t do it for me.”
Ron’s just finished his own rant when the floo fire lights up again and a herd of Slytherins step out, lead by a ruffled Draco, of course.
“Look. You asked me what I want. I want us to stop fighting so much. Clearly there are worse things out there than our little rivalry. We could be friends, Draco.”
Draco lets her drag him along, mind still reeling as he pays for things he doesn’t look at, completely letting Misty take control of the situation.
It's been two years since the war, it ended when they were seventeen and using Draco (who's nineteen now) as a time frame, it means that over two years have passed (war ends before Draco's birthday). As for the war, I keep hinting this but I straight up write it in so it's less confusing, but Draco's whole thing during the war was to save as many people as he could. Yes, he had to get his hands dirty (because Voldemort literally has his mother hostage and could kill his cousin and friends on a mere whim if he wasn't careful), but there are several dozens of witnesses that can attest to him saving lives in the war. Like Carla, when they meet I talk about Draco seeing her and her town and getting as many people (children, mostly, because in a war kids are typically told to run before parents leave) away as possible. I talked about Draco helping people get out of Hogwarts in his 7th year. He helped Susan and Hannah get out, Cho was his partner (kinda) in getting people to safety (which is why she helps look for him in chapter 5), he helped save people from the Carrow Twins (like Seamus and Dean), not to mention that his entire Slytherin Group knew about him sneaking off to shop in muggle parts (chapter 1 or maybe 2). He's had the whole 'saving people' thing for a long time, if his relationship with Theo is anything to go by.
Draco snorts beside his friend, quickly taking a seat before Pansy can react. She takes his hand, glaring at Blaise as he sits beside her. They don’t bother fussing at LuLu for hopping onto her own chair.
Sirius chuckles at him, but nods all the same. He casts a glance at the three of them, “Do try to stay safe, I look forward to seeing you again someday.” And before Draco can ask what that means Buckbeak nods at him and flaps his wings up into the sky.
“Just found out. I was as scared as you at first, but Charlie told me they keep them tame. His favorite is the Hungarian Horntail. Her name is Helga.”
“Yes sir.” Winky says, all professional like she didn’t bring him a hot chocolate spiked with pepper-up at two am. “That is being it for now, I will return later with news from Mistress Narcissa.”
If he’s lucky, and this shit pays off, he might get to fulfill his dream of punching Tom Riddle right in his wannabe-snake face.
hello! i'm sorry that this was super late, the storms this week fucked with our power and my roomates and i had a little trouble getting out wifi back, but i'm here! i'll still be updating on wednesday! and i'll be replying to your comments on the last chapter as soon as this is posted! thank you so much for all the compliments, i genuinely didn't expect to receive such positive feedback and it's amazing! also, i know draco gets a bit of rough sex this chapter, and that it gets a little deep with the past between Kingsley and everyone, but slytherins don't trust people just to trust people, you know. anyways, i hope you enjoyed and i'll see you on wednesday!
“Percy.” Crabbe corrected. Draco cast him a glance, Crabbe never corrected him, usually it was the other way around.
On his previous muggle shopping trips, he and Blasie always had to transfigure their money when no one was looking before even leaving Hogwarts, and now, thanks to modern goblin technology, he can simply swipe his card and let the bank deal with it.
and keeping them hidden on the train was exhausting, but he found that if he didn’t focus on it, the concealment charms in place were easy. His mother had fretted and made him promise on several different accounts to owl him as frequently as he could, apparently she was going back out to Paris to stay safe of Black, Draco thought it was a bit dramatic of her. Or maybe his father just wanted to have the manor to himself, and so long as he, LuLu and his mother were safe, Draco couldn’t care less.
“Harry Potter! How lovely to meet you! I know the competition will be staring soon, but you’re the only one I haven’t interviewed! I need a few words for my paper, you see, and since-“
Malfoy? Is his father here? Oh fuck. Are Potter and his father in the same house? Surely that’s why Dumbledore is here. That’s got to be the reason.
The wrong thing to say if Draco’s expression was anything to go by. “They’re blaming Potter, like the fool would know about any of that. Most of them don’t even know the legend, but given that we have roughly a hundred copies of
Safety precautions were taken, new curfews, Flinch constantly on patrol. The fat lady was put back in her rightful spot, scared to the point that Draco actually had to pay trolls to protect her, another thing to hide from his father, no doubt.  Which was truly rather annoying because the git still wasn’t speaking to him, something that really was beginning to piss him off every damn time he saw blonde hair.
The glint in her eye is only a little crazed, “I haven’t been calm since I first laid my eyes on those two idiots. It’s a wonder my hair hasn’t gone grey yet.”
it’s hard to notice time passing when you’re busy discovering all the things your ancestors got up to. He wishes he could check in the family vault for old diaries, some of the stuff he read sounds too good to miss a joke about.
He turns on his heel, a dramatic show he learned from Draco, and marches the champions away. Hermione bumps into Seeker’s shoulder as she joins them, even Ron is smiling.
“He asked that I let him,” Dumbledore snaps back, wand never ceasing, “He was worried about his position, his father cannot know-”
“Eh?” came the ever fruitful response. Dear Merlin, his irritation was spiking and he couldn’t even hex anyone now.
hurt someone. Draco’s wounds on his back were proof of that, but he didn’t intend on leaving the man feeling bad. Something about that didn’t sit right with him, he might need Lupin’s help later, after all.
Pansy steps in to save the day, placing one perfectly manicured hand on Blaise’s chest, “Of course not, Professor, we just worry about Draco’s inability to stay out of trouble. You saw what happened at the beginning of the year, we’re just afraid he’ll get himself hurt again is all.”
Draco holds out a copy of the rolled up newspaper he’d grabbed on the way into the school where, for all of the wizarding world to see, was Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, driving their car right over a muggle home.
Sirius pouts, fingers gently prodding at Harry’s bruised eye. “Narcissa would never let her son get caught, right Harry? Why are you being so quiet, hm? It’s because I’m right, right?”
“Funny you should mention Draco’s father.” The rest of the team takes casual steps closer, “Let me show you the generous gift he’s made to the Slytherin team.”
Harry is dying to open his eyes and see if there are actual spider webs around him, because he highly doubts Narcissa would allow such a thing in her home, but then the strangest thing happens. Everyone he’s ever known flashes in front of him. Ron, Hermione, Draco, Pansy, Blaise, Sirius, Remus, McGonagall, Theo, Millie, Neville, the Dursleys, Narcissa, everyone from those closest to him to the fucking knightbus driver. And in the middle of them all is him, well, not him, because this version of him has red eyes and is running at him so fast that Harry feels like he’s floating. His familiar mess of hair sheds to revel a pale scalp, his nose closes and shrinks, he grows several inches taller and Harry finds that it was ever him with red eyes, but Riddle disguised as him and he’s getting
He’s not sure why he does it, but in one single flick of his fingers a cracking sound vibrates in the forest around them.
Misty glares at him, taking the bags he hands her and turning to smile at Theo. She even bows in her pretty dandelion dress, “It is lovely to be meeting you, sir, Misty will make tea right away!”
LuLu becomes an essential part of his life. He wakes up early and plays with her, studies with her by his side, watches his friends absently pet her during conversations. One day the two of them take a walk, and when they run into Lupin and LuLu rubs all over his tattered legs, Draco can’t help but smile. He does notice that as the weather grows cooler, no doubt a result of having so many Dementors nearby, she seeks out more warmth. Staying closer to people with body heat, or lounging in front of whatever fireplace Draco is by. Perhaps he would get her a little wardrobe of her own too, a collar for one, and at least five sweaters to match it.
fun fact: i wrote half of this chapter drunk off my ass. guess which half i dare you. also, how do we feel about the ancestry? thoughts and opinions???
He gets a forest green cabinet and counter set, with copper handles, white marble tops, and a hidden trashcan that pulls out and vanishes whatever’s thrown into it. He gets the island set to go with it, a beautiful copper sink with flower detailing. The shopkeeper, Howie, talks him into getting a copper-stained fridge that has preserving charms in it, will make a note on any paper put on the outside when something needs to be restocked, and has a freezer component that freezes things to a perfect temperature, no matter if it’s ice cream or meet. The stove that Howie talks him into is
“Well you never have been good with words, have you? Name her already! I’d very much like to stop calling her ‘Draco’s Kneazle’.”
Fleur shakes her head at the lot of them, much like Theo’s doing. Harry lets himself get caught up in it all until he remembers the reason he came here first instead of going to Ron and Hermione is because he needs to talk to Narcissa, not drag Draco to a dark corner and snog him senseless.
Harry gives him a look, but the two burst into giggles anyways. They laugh a little too hard, waking up LuLu in the process, who meows angrily at both of them before settling back down.
Sorry for the late update! I'm on vacation, and time is a nonexistent concept right now. Anyways, this is a bit of a short chapter because it's been a while since I had a cliff hanger and I've been wanting one, sorry!
in his wretched nothingness. As soon as the bag is zipped, Draco grabs his wand and aparates to the front gates.
a familiar sentence. Normal and welcome, so unlike the kind green eyes that begged with him last night, now they were furious, which serves the idiot right for thinking that they could be
before, so he puts a hand on Harry’s shoulder and whispers “Look, a word of advice since you tried to help me, take a general antidote and wear fireproof underwear.”
“Well we’re not gonna do it by fighting, are we?” Harry yells over her. “And like, look, a Dragon named Helga can’t be as scary as Geia. Aren’t Dragons just giant snakes with wings?”
Have you any idea what type of trouble this could get the two of you into?! You’re going to end up without work- or worse!
Blaise does close the door, and then takes a seat beside Pansy on the chairs across from his couch. No one touches the tea.
Harry regrets this decision entirely, fully ready to beat his own head into a sink just so he can avoid Myrtle’s giggles.
Flint raises his eyebrow, “Not to be frank, but your father’s presents will mean more to the team, plus we’ve all seen you fly, we know you have the talent. No one else wants to be Seeker, and that’s what we need. Are you in or not? Snape’s already cleared the field to get you some practice time, it would be a shame not to let the others sleep just because you haven’t made up your mind.”
Lucius, mentally: I will fucking end you! Piss on your corpse! You try one fucking thing to hurt these kids and I will-
Call him mentally fucked, but Draco’s had a very long week and he can’t stop the near manic laughter that spills out of his mouth. “Who the fuck is Scabbers?”
“Go get yourself cleaned up,” he registers his father saying after what feels like years.  “You have a train to catch in four hours, it would be a shame if a Dementor were to get you before you were within the walls of that wretched castle….”
The way his last name is pronounced, like the worst possible kind of insult is almost enough of a blow to make him snark just one comment and walk away. Of course, it doesn’t play out that way because the stupid first-year glares at him.
It shows in their skin, Pansy developing a nice tan and light freckles breaking out on Draco’s almost not ghostly cheeks. Blaise makes fun of them for getting burned, they go inside.
Draco’s nearing his frustration peak. The top of his left eyebrow is going to start twitching any second now, and he still doesn’t know if Nott’s being serious or trying to get him to admit that he
“No sir, Kreecher was not expecting anyone to be home until five, sir. I will make food right away.”
Lucius grabs him by his throat before he has time to react, hauling him back like something snapped. One look into Draco’s eyes after his head slams into the wall and he comes back. Almost like he too had been thrown into himself, albeit not quite as literally. Eyes wide and horror twisting his features, the man freezes.
“Mum.” Pansy slowly retracts herself, but the slight tremor in her shoulders makes Harry want to cry. “Mum, stop. You knew what risks searching for a connection from Riddle would pose.” She turns tear stained lashes to Harry and lets her shield fall so she can hug him. “I hate to be the one to tell you, but I have really bad news. The worst, actually.”
He shuts his mouth, but does sit up so he can face her better. Even Lucius knows that when Narcissa Malfoy speaks, one listens.
“It’s alright, Dobby.” he says for the millionth time, “I’d probably be blamed for Weasley’s red hair if he was angry enough, we just have to cut Potter off at the platform.”
“Alright!” Draco shouts, hoping to everything that Theo wasn’t planning on telling Misty about the time he got so sleep deprived he wore Pansy’s skirt for an entire hour. “That’s enough! Didn’t you come here for business?”
Pansy’s squeal sends them all into a tizzy of sorts, Ron sticking close to Draco’s side because Draco isn’t really buying much. Well, he’s still getting two pairs of boots, a new cloak for himself (and a surprise one for Ron), gloves, and a small green handkerchief. His other one was ruined after the last Malfoy Gala when he was ten.
Nothing except going to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast and finding out that Sirius Black, the murder out to get Potter, was in the fucking building and had ruined the Fat Lady’s painting.
“Gone. Yes, I’m aware. It seems you and I are the only ones left to care for Potter. Tell me you’re barging here with some fragment of good news, if not I may be reduced to kicking you out and taking house points.”
food is more than enough to please his favorite pain in the ass, but Misty insists, so Draco spends the afternoon spelling away dust, getting used to his new wand while she tinkers with the power box.
Harry walked around a field of flowers, a bigger LuLu walking at his side, nudging against him every so often, but still leading him to a cottage by the beach. He didn’t know how, but he had been here before. As a matter of fact, he had a bloody key to the front door. It opens without much of an issue, and to his shock, Draco is waiting for him in the little house. A blinding smile later and their outside, on the back porch, cuddled together on a large white sofa that overlooks the sea. It’s strange, the happiness he feels. He shouldn’t feel it. This is very, very fucking weird and he would very much like to wake the fuck up right the fuck now. Dream Draco leans towards him, and right as the harrowing realization that the blonde is going to kiss him hits, a loud scream saves him.
Even Draco can’t contain his snickers, which doesn’t help the murderous face Snape gives all three of them. Luckily Lupin isn’t done.
But Harry...well, he’s a little preoccupied hoping that Draco isn’t doing something stupid, like helping search the castle for a serial killer. Which he probably is, with Snape and LuLu by his side, so at least he’s not alone, but Merlin wasn’t he supposed to protect Harry? How was he meant to do that if he was dead? But also, Sirius
Draco wakes up with something warm beside him, he’s so comfortable, and he can hear running water so he should probably get up if Blaise is already in the shower. He opens one eye, expecting to find LuLu curled up next to him, but instead he finds himself face to face with a mop of black hair and a snoring Harry.
Harry was the first to leave, something Draco’s dying to check on. He tried calling on the ‘cell phone’ Hermione made them all, but the witch in question had shaken her head and told him to let Harry be so he had. As much as it makes him slightly jealous, Hermione and Ron do know his boyfriend best, so if they say to give him space Draco will….for now at least.
A dark look passes before he can stop it, leaving them both unwilling to speak and nervous. Eventually, Blaise sits up slowly, “Listen, mate, I can’t pretend to know what’s going on, but if that’s what you’ve been so pent up about….you’re not your father. You have more respect than fear, shouldn’t that matter more in loyalty? Hell, I’m loyal to you, and it’s been a while since I’ve been properly terrified by you.”
Speaking of Snape, it’s no surprise to find that he’s Longbottom’s worst fear, but the image of the man in god-awful clothing, complete with handbag and an outrageously big hat sends him and the rest of the class to tears. They line up to take turns and one by one he sees the funniest things he never dreamt of, spiders on roller skates, snakes turning into clowns, a banshee turning into a rat, and then it hits him right as Potter steps up for his turn.
“Dead? What? You mean to tell me the prick is in some secret cult? Wouldn’t surprise me with his daddy’s past-”
4) trust me when i saw this does Very Much impact the plot, now we can have cute things like Lucius trying to make things up to his family, or maybe something awful happening to him, maybe an alley when no one else is around. he's important, and i know we all hate him and what he did is fucking awful even though i'm writing the damn thing, i want to let him try to redeem himself....but no promises lmao
Any hope leaves him the second he makes his way down to the arena and a blonde woman nearly yanks his arm off.
“Would you care to explain to me,” Lupin leans against his desk, arms crossed and eyebrow raised expectantly, “If you’re okay?”
“What do you want, Potter?” Draco sighs. He’s tired, he doesn’t want to think about anything after what he just experienced, not to mention that he definitely does not have the emotional energy for this. Potter is lucky as hell that everyone else is asleep, he can only imagine the gossip if Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter were seen casually speaking in the middle of the fucking hallway. Would Scarface ever learn to use his brain? Draco was starting to run out of hope.
Harry knows he’s supposed to say sir, he knows he is but he’s not going to and it’s going to cost him one smack to the face but it’ll be worth it-
Harry knows it’s rude to interrupt when adults are talking. He also knows that Narcissa is both a wildly scary witch and one of the important adults in his life, and he knows that interrupting is a sign of disrespect, something he’d never do to her because he has all the respect in the world for her. However, knowing all these facts does not stop him from rushing to meet her half way and smiling brightly right in her face.
Misty watches him with wide eyes, not taking the cup at all, so Draco gently grabs her hand and forces the cup into her fingers.
He’s shouldering as much as he can, taking the blame for those closest to him, trying to protect who he can. His mind, once calmed by the ocean, is buzzing again. Filling up with excuses and lies and anything it can think of to face the truth that he can’t say out loud.
“Speaking of kindness, Dumbledore has told me he wants you to learn how to fight off Dementors, I was thinking of a ‘special project’ as a cover? Would that work for you?”
They make their way back to the living room. Salem comes out from wherever he was hiding, approaching them cautiously as Draco rummages through his bags.
“Care to divulge?” Draco asks, moving in the room to lean against the desk next to Harry. Lupin looks like he might strangle them both.
In the glass, Potter took the tooth of the basilisk, unmoving behind him, sent a glare to Tom Riddle, and then stabbed the diary before him. To Snape’s and Draco’s shock, Riddle burst into light with every stab Potter gave. Glowing and glowing and bursting with light into utter nothingness. To their relief, as soon as the bright light faded, Ginny Weasley sat up and immediately rushed to help Potter. Fawkes joined them right before the glass faded into their own reflections, leaving Draco to fall into the headmaster’s chair.
Sirius doesn’t push Remus out of the way, but that’s only because Remus moves before he can. Sirius pulls him in for a hug, pulls back and grabs him by the chin, and then frowns and speaks in what sounds like rapid fire Latin so quickly Harry needs a second to process it.
Draco pulls away and rolls his eyes, “Oh come off it, we both know you’re the brother Mum never had, and I’m almost positive you and Professor Lupin are married, so he’s family too.”
“You know, Draco,” Snape whispers, making sure no one is around before he growls out, “Whatever your father is trying to pull this year might not work because I’ve decided I’m going to kill Potter first.”
“I need to make a name for myself if I ever want to prove my worth to my parents, and I’m about sick of them undermining me. Even Daph is annoyed by it. So, will you help me or not?”
so they can go over all the finer points and he has to admit. He’s kinda happy Lucius didn’t die last year for this packet alone. Then he has to go through a long series of signatures. It’s awful and time consuming, and then Sirius says something even worse.
“Well said, Draco,” Lupin beams at him. Harry looks like he finally gets it, standing to face the boggart once more.
Ellios laughs, “The mind can grow in my ways, even with shields protecting it it is still a mind. Not a fortress, or even a safe garden. I would like to speak with your mother before beginning, but I need you to want this.”
“I’m thinking,” he begins, “that you should be somewhere safer than the middle of the hallway, and that I have to meet with some friends, so we should probably cut this meeting short, shouldn’t we? I’m also thinking,” he takes a step into Potter’s face, “that you should keep that whole ‘not being seen in public’ thing at the front of your mind. I am your protector, that does not mean we’ll be skipping down the halls singing children’s songs in the near future. Start using your fucking brain,
Draco Malfoy walks barefoot towards the castle, wearing a thin shirt and shorts. He’s limping and when Harry starts running to him, he can see blood and bruises everywhere. The boy’s wand hangs in his hand, but he doesn’t stop moving at the same steady pace, trudging forward through the snow.
Pansy has the decency to look slightly ashamed, “My father came across it in a case a few years ago when a man murdered his wife. The curse is said to deactivate during the caster’s death, though the whole point of it is to drive the victims to suicide at the horrors of their own actions. Memories from their past are enough to act as time blocks, even if the memories aren’t strong. When they are powerful, it’s said to make the curse work faster. Usually it takes years to activate….”
Misty has the foresight to grab some magical mold and mildew cleaner, and then drags Draco over the paint aisle where he stops her because he might have been coerced into doing the floors of the house today, but he can’t even get to all the rooms because of the damn stairs, and that somehow ends with him paying for a new staircase as well.
They didn’t think Harry was intune with the house enough for the Black Manor’s magic to work, but it certainly had.
Sirius chuckles, “At least he has you looking after him. Would you tell me that story as well? I know Narcissa would never allow her child to put himself in harm’s way. Did you make a deal with Lucius?”
It wouldn’t be their last good time, Draco’s sure. Bad things would come their way, particularly his way, but they’d managed worse when they were younger and less prepared.
The elf bows, “Master Regulus loved his brother, and I be loving Master Regulus. Master Sirius and Mistress Narcissa were the only ones to show kindness to him, he talked about you lots before he died. I be honoring my Master’s memory is all, sir.”
“Are you done yet? I’ve been taking all my potions, I rather think you and Madam Pomphrey did a splendid job.”
He had closed his eyes and imagined it, him and his mother laughing in the manor, before all this mess, just the two of them talking about some shopping trip. He thought about Potter being alive and almost grinning at him in the hospital wing. He thought about Pansy and Blaise, curled up on either side of him and talking about classes while a fire cackles in front of them.  Draco really wasn’t sure which memory caused the surge of happiness powerful enough for a bright light to shoot out of his wand. He was so happy he finally managed to produce something he completely forgot to figure out what it was, until three heads of the same snake stared at him.
follow the boy. If he was up to something, he would be stopped, and if he wasn’t, then Harry could sneak away and go to bed.
“Harry!” the boy looks back at him and he can’t decide which possibility he likes less. Harry is either going to whisk him away to the hospital wing in front of the entire school or run after his godfather and get himself killed.
Luna beams at her, Draco sighs. He knew this would happen. Pansy knew this would happen. Hell, when he asked Luna if she wanted to go Luna probably knew this would happen.
Theo, hiding from her in Pansy’s shoe closet, witnessed the whole thing. Every bit of yelling (from Granger) and protesting (from Pansy and Blaise). He waited until the three of them were gone to step out, and then had to wait four whole hours before Granger let Blaise and Pansy return, business models and a three week plan in their hands.
Well, he might not live up to Anvi, but he can definitely picture her holding on for dear life as an angry dragon tries to fly away.
Lucius gives him a look, but he does slowly put down his book and hold out his newer arm. Draco grabs his wand to run a diagnosis, but watching the magic growing his father’s arm is a little distracting. Unbelievable. Anyone who saw it would assume Lucius only got his hand cut off, not his entire arm, elbow and Dark Mark included. Poppy was right, his medical magic does have a long way to go, but her outrageously good healing doesn’t account for the disappearance of his father’s Dark Mark. At least, Draco thinks it’s gone. They won’t really know until the arm is fully healed, and even then, just because the mark is gone doesn’t mean Lucius’s ties are cut.
“But wait, maybe what Ra said will calm him down? He’s a big deal, right? Maybe he can make Dumbledore, I dunno, calm down a bit?”
He himself had only gotten pranked roughly three times. Pansy with an obnoxiously loud alarm that LuLu had vehemently protested against, Blaise’s hair revenge only his had been pink, Crabbe and Goyle had teamed up on him and given him a spicy chocolate that was so hot it made his tongue go numb for a few moments.
Which means the living room is swamped in red and Sirius has to hold Molly back because if he doesn’t get to hurt the Dursleys then she doesn't either.
abstracts. He spots a blue child’s dress with pretty yellow flowers that looks to be Misty’s size, so he grabs that too.
she’s not only taking anyone under seventeen, but she’s housing all sorts of magical creature children! You should’ve been there last month! Some Ministry idiot tried to take her werewolf kids away and she called
After all, if Harry Potter isn’t at school this year, that's one less thing for Draco to worry about while trying to keep all the dirty muggleborns from being killed. Would he normally care? No. But this time, if they were to die, if even one of them perished, it might be enough for another Dark Lord to rise. Call him sane, but Draco knows better than to let that happen. A marvelous plan, really, get someone to keep Potter away from Hogwarts, and the rest would be easier without him sticking his stupid scar-face where it doesn’t belong.
Hurt flashes across Potter’s face and he has to remind himself of why it’s better that way. His mouth is moving towards whatever remark is thrown at him, and he knows he’s throwing it back just as harsh. But Draco keeps his eyes trained on Potter’s face. He doesn’t look arrogant, or even happy. He looks tired. Worn down, like merely existing at that point in time is too much. Supposedly, abuse will do that to you. Draco wonders if he ever has that look on his face, surely Pansy would’ve told him to hide it. If not Weasley’s wand pointing at his nose surely said he was doing a good job of keeping it hidden.
“It’s already four?” Hermione sighs longingly at the book in her hand. “I have to be home for dinner…”
him back to his room. He shoves Harry down on the bed, crawls in next to him while Harry gets comfortable under the covers.
“Alright, as you know Remus and I are very new to this, but we do have some ground rules. Follow me, kid.”
“You throw yourself in the way of danger at any given chance! You’re had more close calls than anyone else in this room, and as far as I’m concerned it’s not your job to save someone just because their parents died! Do you not understand that people would miss you if you died? That seeing you hurt makes them upset? Do you care about anyone? Or is keeping your friends in a constant state of panic a Malfoy thing too?”
Two days before the term ends and Draco is ready to slit someone’s throat. Across the courtyard he can hear the Weasley twins pulling at Potter’s leg, so loudly anyone within a five mile radius could probably hear them.
Hermione’s eyes widen at Dumbledore’s retreating back so at least one of them understood his bullshit.
Four Weasleys, Ronald, the girl one, and the twins, plus Hermione, Harry and himself. A total of seven, he can do this.
Lucius , letting his shields down so he can scream at Dumbledore mentally: fucking try me you trick ass, stupid ass, fucking bitch.
The group around them starts to gather their things, wands are collected and Sirius is forced to swear something about not hurting anyone to Severus who also curses Lupin up and down and threatens to have him removed from the grounds. Hermione steps in to point out that Weasley is still hurt and it’s almost lost over Pettigrew’s screams for mercy.
he thrusts a piece of parchment into Lupin’s hands, “Peculiar, isn’t it? How Dark Magic seems to find its way into the same student’s hands year after year.”
“Of course I did,” Draco rolls his eyes and Harry decides that only nice people get warnings about possible skulls and shredded snake skin. “It’s called being
Blaise glares at them, “I swear if I’m still-oh thank Merlin! I’m rubbish at Latin, I could barely understand what I was saying!”
It’s honestly amusing to watch Potter fail so many times, landing at least three times on his ass before throwing up frustrated hands. Draco can’t hold back his laughter, and he does regret informing Harry that he can produce a Patronus, thank you very much.
“Draco Malfoy, at your service. We’re terribly sorry to disturb such a fine young lady as yourself so late in the evening, but Harry and I have some business in the Chamber, something that might interfere with your safety and we’d never allow that to happen. Perhaps, once that business is settled, we could bring more friends to visit with? After all, a gorgeous girl like you shouldn’t be left to her lonesome. It’s not right by a gentleman’s standards.”
He still doesn’t get a response so he starts forming an argument in his head but it’s very difficult when his thoughts won’t fucking
No why in Godric’s great name is he letting Cedric walk out in all yellow while he’s in all red. No, no,
“Settle down.” Snape draws out, and even though he’s terrified of looking into the man’s eyes he does. Nothing is in them, except relief buried so deep Draco almost misses it.
Draco feels like he should be offended, but he’s been called much worse and the man is definitely right in this case.
“I love them” he smiles, once again treading the line of happiness, only avoiding it encase his father got any ideas.
Howie emerges from behind the counter, a big smile on his jolley face. He’s clad in a red suit shirt and white overalls. Draco realizes that the man looks
It's a slowburn, I won't lie. Like I'm mid way through writing chapter seven and harry and draco still haven't come in contact, mainly because it's primarily about draco healing after the war, all the chapters are twenty pages long (bare minimum), so it's a long fic so far.
Buckbeak bows back and makes to come near him, but a chain keeps him from going far so Draco meets him halfway, hands reaching out to stroke surprisingly soft feathers.
They walk back to the desk, Misty on his heels to make sure he actually pays for it. In all honesty, he’s not sure he could resist if he wanted to. Part of him doesn’t think the wand will let him. He can already feel his magic merging with it, humming through the willow wood, like it’s singing through whatever the hell a Horned Serpent Horn is, Draco will look it up when he gets home.
“That’s never worked well in the past and you know it, that’s exactly how we ended up with Blaise in here.”
“I found him. LuLu led me to him, she’s been under my feet all week, so when she started running I followed.”
Yeah, he kinda expected that. After all, Sirius can’t see his godson, so his cousin’s kid will have to suffice. Draco would be irritated if he could care.
And then the air around his boyfriend’s feet starts to cackle and he’s marching forward. The Slytherins take one look behind them, one of them offers a ‘well, I suppose if you weren’t dead before you most certainly are now’ before jumping out of the line of fire.
thank you for all the well wishes! I got back to work this week so it's back to normal posting schedule!
Polly slumps to the floor, calm once again, very unlike the furious glare the Hufflepuff, Draco recognizes him as Justin Fletchley.
Draco nods, then realizes that Misty has been watching with wide eyes the entire time. “Oh, Griphook, this is Misty, a, um, friend. Misty, this is Griphook. He’s been my financial advisor since I was nine.”
now. Ron Weasley came, even if it was just because his girlfriend and his sister were there. And since two thirds of the Golden Trio were present, Harry
“Wait here.” he barks, looking around for anything that would normally make them laugh. He mumbles something else, not really paying attention as he spots the headlines from the
Draco turns to see Narcissa, leaning casually against the railing in what she calls ‘casual clothes’ that’s really her sparring uniform. “You’re here early, come grab breakfast before we start.”
There’s a moment that he looks between them. His mother, kind and calm, tears threatening to spill from her perfect eyes, her chestnut hair still in the bun his father once told her was his favorite. His professor, still clad in black but not the robes that make him seem untouchable, rather a sweater Draco just knows is softer than LuLu’s fur. Both of them are nothing like other people know them to be.
More like the most terrifying thing Draco has ever seen. Larger than a horse, beaks and talons like birds but with the body of a lion and
Kreecher gives him a look, but Harry assures him that he’s nowhere near as bad as Sirius is in a kitchen, and that’s how Harry finds himself cooking eggs while Kreecher makes waffles.
Remus looks sadder, which makes him look more like the real Remus. “Yes I’m real, come out of there, silly.”
Snape looks ready to murder him, but Dumbledore just smiles. “He’s right, Severus. Plus, he’s being helpful.”
Harry doesn’t know shit about other languages, but he does know ‘mon amour’ is French for ‘my love’ thanks to a kick Aunt Petunia got on a few years ago when Uncle Vernon made noises about wanting to go to Paris. He also knows that whatever’s happening here, he doesn’t like it. So when Cedric says ‘bye’ for them both and leads him away he doesn’t complain at all.
Harry glares at her, about to open his mouth with a snarky comeback, and then Lucius says something he never wanted to ever hear in his entire life.
done, Draco lies back on the floor of the living room, welcoming Salem out of hiding and into his arms. The kneazle kitten has just settled down for a nap on his chest when Misty comes into the room, a piece of parchment and a half broken quill in her hands.
They’re heading to Dumbledore’s office when McGonagall stops them, almost running straight into Snape.
Bloody hell, Draco almost screams at him.  This is not good. There’s nothing he can say. Nothing he can deny, because Potter knew the truth, or maybe he didn’t. Maybe this was some weird test of sorts. Draco snorts, “You must have hit your head while you were stalking me because I-“
“Severus!” She gasps, narrowing her eyes at Draco, who nods in return. Before he can think of an excuse, Snape is calmly explaining.
He refuses to look away from the searching green eyes. Fury fades out of them leaving them tired, Harry actually slouches into his touch, he must be exhausted. Neither of them pay attention to Pettigrew begging behind them.
You saved Mr. Weasley, yes, but you can’t keep getting yourself in danger! You’re going to get killed!”
Draco’s hand is squeezing his to point that it’s painful, so he squeezes back and really hopes it gets the message across.
“Draco, you’re still a kid. You’ve been through horrifying things, and I get it, you feel guilty, but the people you care about don’t want you to die for it.”
Now that he’s mentioning it, Harry has seen the same shirt on every elf he’s encountered in this ridiculous house.
Draco raises an eyebrow at the question, but doesn’t feel the need to lie or answer truthfully. He settles for somewhere in the middle, figuring the potion hasn’t taken effect yet.
“Ah, I guess it’s just Harry.” Draco interrupts her because he’s really too tired to explain House Elves when he
The third time had been with Pansy in a similar manner, only he and Pansy had gotten quite close as children, and what really happened was some asshole insulting her into tears and Draco couldn’t very well have that. In turn for ‘protecting’ her with his ‘pretty fire’ she showed him her webs and that had been that. However, given that the last event was a slightly public one, he’d kept his flames in check for a long time.
