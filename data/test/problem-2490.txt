“Don’t say sulking.” Ron cried.
Hermione’s grin was cheek splitting. She loved her friends “Which is obviously absolutely absurd”
Harry shrugged, “What’s the point in them knowing? They’d just be sad.”
“I’m sorry?” Neville offered, patting her hand lightly.
“How the hell do you know this stuff?” Ginny said, from the foot of Harry’s bed. They had all crowded into Harry’s room to ostensibly transfigure two extra beds. In actuality, they had all sprawled across the room to discuss the events of the kitchen.
And yet Ron suspected that he would never have an ordinary life again. In fact he suspected he had never actually had a normal life to begin with, even before a smiling Harry had burst into his train compartment.
“We were just going to the kitchens.” Harry said, rubbing the crown of his head. Neville wondered how he got away with half the things he did, terrible liar as he was.
Neville gaped. Harry had done it. He had kept the fire contained. It was going to be okay. Harry turned around, looking at Neville with bright eyes and the beginning of a smile curling at his mouth.
Neville had been surprised to find Hermione and Ron waiting agitatedly in the second-floor bathroom. Hermione seemed to be having a theological debate with Myrtle, but she stopped as soon as she saw them emerge, diving forward to fling her arms around Harry, then Neville in turn.
I need this to end.
It was half hidden by the trees, but what they could see of it made her certain that it was uninhabited and had likely been abandoned for a while. The walls- who’s original colour was indiscernible- were blanketed thickly in moss, and the moss itself was almost hidden by a towering wall of nettles, which reached almost to the roof. The roof itself hardly deserved the name. Most of the rafters were visible and clearly close to rotting away. A few sad shingles clung here and there, like a bald man combing a single hair over his head. The front door was broken, as if it had been kicked, and a rusty iron nail stuck out from it- something long ago rotted clinging in shrivelled tendrils to it.
I do not know anything but him.
he snapped at Ron, trying to get a better shot of the golden man
Amsterdam had filtered into the news only a few days earlier, with seven muggles being found dead.
A beat of silence. Hermione and Harry exchanged a panicked glance. Luna realised that she too had almost entirely forgotten the event.
It was Harry and Hermione. Hermione’s hair was even bigger than it usually was, it flew out form her head like a mad scientist. Harry’s hair was sticking straight up in the air, and his glasses where black with smoke.
It was filled with lists such as
“What- what the hell is wrong with them?” Neville had panted as they hurried up a set of stairs Harry had revealed behind a seemingly ordinary tapestry. He had turned the tapestry to stone behind them, which Neville had been impressed by because they weren’t scheduled to start soft to solid transfigurations until spring that year.
Neville watched with curiosity as Harry tapped the parchment with his wand and ink unfurled across the paper in shifting patterns. He unfolded it, revealing a much larger piece of parchment.
There was a comfortable moment where they all smiled at Harry, because none of them except Luna could imagine the pain of losing a parent, thankful that he was happy.
“It was nothing” Harry said awkwardly “How long have you been back? I’m sorry it took so long”
Ron’s greatest quality, as universally decided by everyone who met him, was his skill at chess.
“What?” Draco said. Smiling innocently, “You expect me to support a Hufflepuff?”
“An awful woman. She’s in Azkaban.” Harry said.
“I wasn’t aware you were a Werewolf Mister Potter.” Snape said in disbelief.
“Yeah, but I’d care way more if it was a Gryffindor.”
“Here” Harry said grinning and handing Draco a sparkly wrapped (thankfully wrapped by Hermione) present “It’s from all of us”
The point about Draco not being nice, and Luna knowing that, was that it didn’t matter. Because nice people weren’t the people you became true friends with. Nice was for people you smiled at when passing in corridors. Or for people who you borrowed class notes off of. Or for those awkward acquaintances whose friendliness never blossomed into anything more. True friends weren’t nice to each other. No small lies to cover the cracks every person had. They were true. Scathing remarks and all.
“Because we were fifteen once.” Sirius pointed out, looking slightly green around the gills. He tucked a comforting arm around his husband.
hope everyone's quarantine isn't too awful.
She needed to find out what he was hiding. Then she needed to make him one hundred percent better at whatever it was before it got him seriously injured. Or worse. Ex
Harry Potter?”
Draco was involved in both of these activities, though definitely more passionate when it came to revision- Hermione and he could be
“Well, yes. But you’re still
“What is he?” Hermione said, incapable of keeping quiet. Kreacher’s head whipped towards her, fury filling his face and he began to open his mouth but—
“Actually I was just going to ask you” She replied, voice flat.
Ginny giggled, then paused in thought. “What will you do with her?”
“Told her I’m just shit at apparating and missed the drawing room. Not exactly my proudest moment.”
Her mother kept referring to one of the men as ‘Remus, dear’ and the Remus,
“Harry.” He called, catching up to him in the courtyard. Long legs came in useful sometimes. They were paused under a large tree. Harry stared at it thoughtfully.

“Fudge has given another interview about what a terrible job he thinks Minister Bones is doing” Hermione said in disgust, tossing the offending Prophet onto the breakfast table. Hedwig jumps back and glares at her reproachfully “As if she isn’t the most effective Minister we’ve had in the last five terms”
“Well, have you seen the way he stares at Ced-“ Ron began, but Ginny cut him off.
Nothing made Ron happier than watching his best friend be unapologetically happy.
They walked for a little way with no change to the scenery. Ginny repeatedly bounced up on her toes to try and see over the hedges, while Harry and Hermione walked a meter or so ahead of her, holding a muttered conversation under their breaths. They rounded to the left and a valley opened up below them, a small but sprawling tucked between two hills. Ginny could see a graveyard and a manor house clearly even from where she stood.
“I know you will.” Ron said with a soft grin at her. She rolled her eyes but blushed a little.
It was true. It was widely known that Pansy had been groomed to take over from Iphigenia and Kassandra when they graduated, with Ginny Weasley as her second in charge.
“How can you—” George frowned. Ginny held up he hand.
Harry stared a moment longer at the spider slowly spinning its web, and Hermione watched too. Then he looked at her with a weak smile, “But it should be okay now. It should all work out. Now.”
“I can talk to snakes” Harry said, coughing lightly as if to clear his throat.
“Doesn’t it bother you?” Ron prompted, “What is it that they won’t tell us? I thought they were going to finally come clean at the world cup but, well—”
“Sirius,
“Oh my” Ginny squeaked “You are an eldritch being! You come down here to feast on raw flesh”
Ginny didn’t look satisfied, but let it go anyway. They all spread out across the floor, Ron and Hermione clustered close together as usual despite their constant bickering. Ginny took a spot to Luna’s left Neville sat on her right, knees pulled up awkwardly to his chest. It would take a few hours, as usual, for Neville’s base level of anxiety to chill and for him to relax.  Draco pushed Harry until he shifted over, and flopped next to him on the giant bean bag, draping his legs over Harry.
Hermione Granger had probably been born brilliant. She would like it noted for prosperity that ’probably’ is a qualifier used here only due to a lack of quantifiable proof. Her mother swears she’d had the little wooden cylinder block through the circle hole after only a moments consideration.
As any mother would be.
“It’s a map” Harry muttered, eyes scanning the page rapidly.
It had been decided at their first meeting that the paper would be a monthly publication. Current events, Hogwarts news and think pieces and educational articles would make up most of the paper. They were also accepting any submitted short stories or poems. Colin’s photos were prominently featured, taken around the castle throughout the month. Special student achievements were listed in the back by teachers. Dumbledore, surprisingly animated about the idea, submitted a crossword and promised to do it for each publication to come.
Neville watched in shock as it sank backwards, revealing a gaping tunnel in the floor.
But he was cut of by a crack of apparition. Suddenly Ron’s father and a purple faced Barty Crouch were in the clearing too. Both of their faces went through the seven stages of grief while taking in the scene before them. It was actually rather fascinating to witness.
“He’ll be fine.” Harry dismissed, though Ron could detect the worry still evident beneath Harry’s bluff.
The surprise of this all was how willing Fred and George were to allow Ron to hang around them. Of course, there was a caveat. Ron became guinea pig numero uno.
“Sorry.” Hermione said automatically. She’d said it enough since that particular story had come out. “But
But he let it go, still dazed from eucalyptus and lilacs.
Draco didn’t talk until the first side had finished. “This is beautiful” He said, and Luna smiled at him and turned the record over. California began to play. Luna lost her self in memories of her mother. Her mother had said that any time she felt lost she would simply choose a record and listen to it completely with her eyes closed and suddenly she would be exactly who she was he first time she heard it. She said that records were like cameras; they snapped you and you were caught forever exactly as you were the first time the notes flowed through your blood.
“You…believe you are a Seer.” He said, though Hermione didn’t think it was actually a question as he didn’t wait for Harry’s answer, “And that in that box is Peter Pettigrew, who’s the actual traitor and
Neville laughed darkly, “I meant I was a little bit worried you were going to off yourself accidentally,” He gave a wry smile, “On account of you being kind of an idiot.”
Falling out but not
Bill was perfect in every conceivable way: head boy and twelve newts to boot and already making his way up the career ladder. Charlie, the Quidditch prodigy, enigmatic and an enigma in his daring foreign job. Percy the burgeoning Minister for Magic since age three. Fred and George had made their first invention at seven. Granted it promptly exploded three hours later but
Harry rolled his eyes good naturedly while Draco and Ron just laughed.
With one last half-hearted finger-comb through his hair, he gave a final rally. “Come along lads. Let’s go collect our dates.”
Draco sat next to Harry and Neville watched emerald eyes trail across Draco’s blazing hair. Neville could guess that Harry wasn’t just thinking about the sun.
“Whoopsie. Need glasses, me. My mistake." Harry said cheerily when she turned back in confusion after spotting nothing. “Thought I saw a cool cloud."
Harry looked at him, eyes wide. Harry had a habit of accidentally looking like a mad philosopher- his constantly messy crown of dark curls means that any time he looks slightly surprised he also looks intensely mad.
“Neville’s Grandma.” Ginny said, voice horrified. “She was killed in an attack.”
“Sorry,” Harry said with a shrug, “We can chat later. I have stuff to do.”
Then the first fire-serpent flew into the air, diving at Harry. Neville screamed, and Harry’s face shifted, he ducked, rolling to the side. The serpent burst into green flame where he had stood. The small blaze was churning now, as if readying to birth more fire dragons. It was spreading, consuming the space. Neville could feel the heat growing. It was going to be unbearable.
Ginny ignored this odd response to stare at him in bafflement. He had a sleep mask resting on his forehead. It had tacky fake eyes printed on it.
Neville shrugged, “No. but I will tell Dumbledore.” He frowned, “Actually, scratch that. I’ll tell Ginny.”
in front of me” Harry said, nose scrunched.
“Oh,” Neville said slowly, “Okay.”
“What? Why? You’re a great flyer” She said, frowning. They’d played a lot of three-a-side quidditch in the back garden, roping in Percy or Luna to play. Usually Harry’s team won, though this was possibly because Luna was an awful seeker. She oftentimes got distracted by cool clouds.
It was May when everything finally came to a head. All through the whispered attacks and rising tensions, You-Know-Who had remained unseen and largely un-known.
This time I flip a green moleskin to a random page and find him sobbing on the floor. His sadness is symmetrical. I cannot see what he sees but for a moment I swear his eyes meet mine in the twisted looking glass.
“How do you think Durmstrang will get here?” Draco said with uncharacteristic excitement at breakfast the Monday before the other schools were set to arrive.
“Alright.” Ron said with vigour. “Tell me everything. I’m helping from now on, you idiots.”
“I believe you” Harry said, the green eyes that contrasted so heavily with his brown skin boring into her own chocolate eyes. He was looking for something “I’m just not sure which you I’m actually believing”
I feel the pain twist my guts up and burn out my arteries. I feel a million fucking paper cuts across my skin.
In one version, Harry Potter survives. But just in one.
Except the twins. The twins were apparating back and forth across the room with vigour. Neville could see Hermione’s jaw already beginning to twitch.
“Harry” The man boomed, striding forward and engulfing Harry in a hug.
But the deal had been that Neville wasn’t to know more than necessary.
She’d told him one of Ginny’s best jokes (though she thinks she may have gotten the punchline wrong) and made him a flower crown out of daisies to coax a smile from him.
“It wasn’t her fault,” Harry said, sighing and doing the same on her other side, “I’ll make sure they don’t do anything idiotic. She won’t get in trouble.”
“Harry,” Neville panted, “Harry, slow down. Come on.”
That was where they were now, at the top of a small hillock under a strangely sturdy tree. Harry pacing back and forth, tearing his hair out.
An anonymous contributor (though Luna was privately pretty convinced it was Draco) wrote a column about Music, both muggle and magical. The by-line referred to the writer simply as ‘The Music Mage’.
Colin looked at Ginny, unperturbed and still grinning “It’s good lighting here”
“I had become something called the master of death at that point” Harry said, snorting lightly “It’s like… Have you ever read Lord of the Rings? Well its that sort of ‘one ring to rule them all’ thing. I’d collected these objects” He shrugged awkwardly “Anyway I think that having that power or whatever it is meant that when I had this fleeting thought” his voice cracked “that I wished I could see my family again. It. Well it let that happen. Instead of waking up back where I died I—”
The Disappearing Boy had blown into Hermione’s compartment like a messy haired storm only a few minutes after he’d disappeared on the platform. He’d flung her compartment door open, stepped in, and proceeded to gape at her like a fish.
Which, of course, he was.
“Luna” Xenophilius Lovegood called from inside the kitchen “Will you go down to the village and collect my parcel from the post office? It’s my ink and I’ll be running out soon, my love”
in wonder for a moment before taking a happy sip, her cheeks red not just from the heat of the mug.
They both remained silent for a long moment. Hermione in understandable shock and Harry in clear exhaustion.
“Merlin, I can imagine.” Ron said, shuddering. He chewed his last bite of bread, ketchup and sausage thoughtfully. “You ‘fink you cou’d teach me?” He said through his mouthful.
When she glances up, she sees Draco staring at her warily. She smiles at him widely. Unfortunately, she’s been chewing liberally on her quill for the last ten minutes and so the smile is rather bluer than intended.
“Who in the morgana is Peter Pan?” Ron said, nose scrunched.
The thoughts swirled in his head, making him frown, and he had almost moved on to full existential dread mode when—
“Guys!” She gulps in a large breath. Stumbling to a stop in front of Harry and Hermione. “Wait”
Hermione took a moment to preen, before rightly panicking about the supposedly sentient mind-reading piece of headwear currently sat atop her head.
“You don’t have to tell me the reason behind it or any of your secrets. Believe me, I’ve walked in on you enough to know that you have about a million of those.” They looked at each other guiltily. “You don’t have to tell me the bigger picture.”
A long three minutes later, after a spirited debate and lot of disembodied laughter she wasn’t entirely sure wasn’t aimed at her, Hermione Granger became the newest member of Gryffindor house.
She smiled at them when they all awkwardly filed in “Oh, hello dears,” She said, standing up and bustling past the now silent room.
Harry, however. Tight spots were when he did some of his best work.
“What children?” Hermione said with an amused giggle.
Neville gaped, he felt glued to the floor. “Neville,” Harry screamed, but he was still metres away. Neville watched a purple parrot of flame fly screeching into the air. A green snake of fire, so much smaller than the basilisk but just as deadly slithered faster and faster across the floor. It was nipping at Harry’s heels.
After the Easter holidays Hermione wrote a featured article for the Oracle about the cruel practices of magical-animal slavery across what she called 'The corporate wizarding world'. In it she referenced Gringotts and its poor Dragon five times. It caused a humanitarian outcry in the school population and went on to be picked up by the prophet itself, with Hermione smiling smugly the whole time.
“So what?” Fred said, appearing next to Harry’s armoire. “They’re just running the ‘defeat Voldemort’ program from Sirius’ kitchen?”
“Ah, this malicious gambling addiction will foil you one day Granger.” Draco said loftily.
Not that he’d ever let Ginny hear him say something like that.
“Ah, yes. Of course, you remember me.” He said smugly. Then cast a disdainful look at Ron. “Though I wouldn’t think you’d want to associate with
Fred and George seemed to think Harry was brilliant, and Harry let them chat constantly about ideas they had for inventions and cool secret parts of the castle. Ginny had caught him staring oddly at Fred on numerus occasions, however, and she was beginning to consider if maybe she was barking up the wrong tree.
“Is there another option? A better one?” Luna said, watching Harry sideways.
“Father—“ Draco cut in, trying to diffuse the tension.
“It’s sort of like being an Animagus,” Neville said, frowning as he read, “Except not as permanent.”
“But you don’t like me?”
“Draco” She asked, pulling her quill out of her mouth. The ink splotch was making a valiant effort to conquer new land on her chin “Would you like to be cheered up?”
“It’s safer not to be flooing back and forth,” Molly said, stroking Ginny’s hair lovingly. “I have old Mr. Tremel looking in on the chickens for us.”
Harry looked uncomfortable, “I was given a choice. I thought I was choosing to go back to my own time, but instead I came here. Back to first year, and you lot.”
Ron looked up into the worried faces of Luna and Ginny. They had crowded around him. Pansy was clutching her hands together, tightly, her usually dark skin pale and clammy.
Which was how they found themselves following an agitated Harry to the other side of the Seventh-floor. Hermione asked increasingly bewildered questions the whole time.
He cut off and waved his hand emphatically as if to encompass both ‘dark attack’ and ‘ministry scandal’. Draco winced again, probably because it was widely believed that his dad had somehow been involved.
“Not a clue” Fred said. Then he grinned devilishly “Let’s go check it out and see if we can make it fun”
“Because I’m a time traveller” Harry stated bluntly, no indication in his tone that he was actually revealing an astounding thing “And therefore I’ve known you before”
“He can’t get Hagrid fired, can he?” Hermione worried, flipping fervently through a book on Wizarding Law.
Draco was like a kitten. He constantly sought Harry’s attention, good or bad. If he had to irritate Harry into giving him that attention, he would. Then when he had the attention he’d act aloof and preen, then sulk when this inevitably made Harry stop paying attention. It was a vicious cycle, but it was funny to watch. Draping himself on Harry and being as close to him as possible was one of the blondes favourite methods, it seemed.
“Father wanted me to go there.” Draco said, the same blue tone entering his voice whenever he talked about his father.
“Yeah Perce,
The first thing Luna ever placed on the walls was the patent certificate for the
As if defeating a dark wizard before your second birthday somehow meant you didn’t need to adhere to normal human behaviour or the laws of the universe. That was admittedly a bit of a stretch. Hermione hadn’t seen Harry bend any of the laws of the universe.
“Yeah. Why did Vance have to leave, anyway?” A fourth year Hufflepuff moaned.
Sirius frowned at him, “What? No. Everyone’s fine. Extended Weasley bunch, Arthur and Molly are at mine too.” He sighed and muttered under his breath, “And another dozen people on top of that.”
They’d had three rather marvellous days under Granger hospitality so far. Hermione’s mum and dad had been exceptionally pleased that Hermione had already made such strong friends, though of course a little baffled that they were all boys. The Granger’s professions certainly supplemented a big enough house so that Harry and Ron could sleep in the spare room, which calmed Patrick Granger’s nerves about the whole situation.
“Harry.” Tonks said with a tortured voice. “You should go back to the castle.”
Then they came back around to Harry.
Harry’s mouth tightened around the edges. “I never lived with Sirius. He died at the end of our fifth year.”
“Fleur’s a girl.” Harry pointed out and Ginny wrinkled up her nose. “Fleur seems cool.” Harry insisted at her face.
It had been this odd group which had comforted him at the end of last year. These that he sat with on train journeys. Who always invited him to DA meetings and birthday gatherings and odd games of truth or dare?
Sirius and Remus smiled at him kindly. “Don’t mention it. It was a pleasure. We’ll see you at Christmas.”
Of course, Sirius’ definition of ‘adventure’ often changed. One day they would be on a hop-on hop-off bus tour all across muggle London, the next a picnic by Stonehenge. One morning he had declared that that day’s adventure was an endeavour to stay in pyjamas all day and watch muggle films on Remus’ magically adapted projector.
The problem was, Hermione Granger didn’t like Probable. She liked certainty, clarity, surety. So even if she was almost, quite really,
“I’ll make sure he’s alright.” Ron said softly, and everyone nodded, watching Neville with sorrowful eyes.
That could abash the little Bird
That perches in the soul –
But these are all thoughts that loiter on the edge of his mind, pushed aside by the thrill of first journeys and new places.
Ginny laughed, to Ron’s surprise. “I’m sure you can think of a better compliment than that.” She teased.
The only proof that any of it had ever happened at all came when the Prophet arrived the next morning, and each of them held their breaths until it was unfurled to reveal a front page about the recent wizarding attacks. No mention of a Gringotts break in at all.
They were extensive lists.
Silence reigned blissfully for a few moments until it was deposed by the violent anarchist hitherto known as Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked conflicted for a few moments, but finally his expression relaxed. “Thank you, Professor. I wish I’d known her”
i stayed up far too late to finish these scenes and so the only edit I've done is a typo one. ill be back soon to edit properly but here it is for now.
Oak trees sprouted and were felled. Mammoths experienced a brief resurgence before once again going extinct. The human race finally figured out how to manipulate natural occurrences of biological immortality.
“You know what I mean” Ron huffed, while they all laughed at him.
But she would be back. There was nothing in any universe that could stop her.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Yeah. That would definitely help soothe the panic.” She drawled.
“We’re, uh, we’re going to have to break into Gringotts.”
the poem is ""hope" is the thing with feathers" by Emily Dickinson
Dumbledore- who looked oddly even more impressive in his candy pink, cat patterned night clothes- looked a little bit like he thought he might still be having a dream. In fact, he’d had that same look on his face ever since Harry had knocked on his chamber door and demanded an ‘audience’ with him. He just stared at the shoebox, which Harry had flung on to the wizard’s coffee table, with befuddlement.
Luna’s half-way through not doing her Potion’s essay (instead of following Snapes prompt she’s writing him a think-piece on animal cruelty in the potions industry. She’s sure he’ll appreciate it) when she feels the sofa cushions dip beside her.
“I’m okay.” Neville said hurriedly. “It’s your wedding day. Don’t worry about me.”
The door gave a click. He twisted the doorknob, pushing the wood door in. It swung open and behind it was—
“Yeah,” Hermione said drily, “Just think, if we were older, we might have had to watch Harry blunder his way through the competition.”
She caught a fleeting and incriminating glance of Harry Potter leaving the common room with a shoe box in his hands. A
“I was!” Harry said through strained teeth. “Things have apparently
“Harry, you aren’t Peter Pan. Pick up the cards and sit down.” Hermione said as she tried to fish a lost ace out from under her armchair.
Neville couldn’t help noticing the curl of Harry’s hair, even though his whole face was scrunched in discomfort.
“This is exactly what I said you were like last time” Ginny heard him mutter teasingly.
“If you
I soon find that the worst pain is every almost perfect universe. The lifespan and the hero and the boy- but no parents. The parents and the lifespan- but no boy, no happiness. The boy- no survival. A missing ingredient. A loss before the taking. A missed beat.
“Yes she’s an excellent teacher,” Hermione said, looking far off, “But I suppose this begs the question; what are they doing instead to track us?”
None of it enlightened her any further on Harry. Honestly, it just confused her more. Though she was pretty sure he just must have a crush on that third year Cedric Diggory.
Ginny only pause a split second to rub away the last vestiges of her tears, and then she’s sprinting full throttle towards them. It’s up a hill so she’s out of breath when she yells.
Ron groaned. Percy had been practically unbearable all summer. When Draco had joined them earlier, they’d spent a good half-an-hour reenacting some of his greatest moments of prattish superiority. Fred and George had delighted in helping out. Ron thought that if they weren’t so bloody good at inventing, the twins might have a promising career in the theatre.
Hermione laughed. “But we couldn’t celebrate it last week! We had to have a late party”
Harry stood up quickly grabbing Ginny’s hand and pulling her up with them. “Come on then, lets get the hell away from this ugly house”
Harry rubbed a hand over his face harshly. “That’s what I’ve been thinking the whole time.” He muttered.
Ron shrugged “It’s just ice cream. ‘sides, Draco and Hermione will probably spend the whole time talking about books so be warned”
Harry fumbled quickly for his pocket and pulled out a compact mirror which was blaring with a red light. His eyes went wide, and he flipped the mirror open. A voice came frantically out of it.
Ron was different. He’d always been sensitive. Most people saw him as a thought-less person, but this wasn’t true. Ron thought about everything, all the time, in excruciating detail. He thought things to their death.
“Yeah” Dean said, smiling at her brightly “Harry said it should be a good time. And help us with our grades and stuff”
Neville imagined old professor Dumbledore sneaking around corners and couldn’t hold back a giggle.
They both paused. Considering her words.
They stood like that for a while, Harry slowly dragging breathes into his body. Then suddenly Harry shifted and flung his arms around Harry in a tight, crushing hug.
The boy made his way down the stairs to join them
Ginny was naturally independent to a fault; she appreciated the air to breathe that was given in Molly’s absent-minded dismissal. If Molly labelled her ‘nothing to worry about’ then Ginny had far more space to go about doing things that Molly would definitely worry about if only she knew.
The train ride was sombre. Hogwarts had been sombre for days, but not for the same reasons Ron was. The castle was in mourning for the Wizards who had lost their lives, and while Ron mourned them too it was Pettigrew’s lifeless, mangled corpse that haunted him.
The message faded out. Tonks, Neville realised with surprise. Were she and Fleur close?
After they’d both sobered, and Hermione had given Harry a much needed hug, Harry looked at her wonderingly.
Where was she? Some lower level dungeon? A basement? Whatever it was, she concluded it was probably Slytherin in origin. There was snake paraphernalia all over the slimy tunnel.
not sure how pleased i am with this chapter and i'm forever sorry for any inconsistencies i miss. i wrote this over such a long time i worry it's too disjointed. hope you enjoy regardless.
Harry Potter was strange, Hermione couldn’t deny it. There were just certain things about the boy that didn’t seem to click. Unlike the rest of the first years, Harry never got lost and acted as if he knew every inch of the castle off by heart. When Hermione questioned this, asking if he’d ever been to Hogwarts, Harry had simply said that he’d grown up with second hand knowledge of the school from his Aunt, who had heard it from his mother.
Ginny frowned at that. The date meant that Harry couldn’t have known him. Why were they here?
It was nice, she decided, having friends. Even if the rather large part of her that was an insecure realist insisted it wouldn’t last for long. No one ever stayed to be friends with Hermione Granger. That was a fact.
It was nice. It was terribly, terribly nice. Neville hadn’t expected it at all.
A few days later, Hermione came across the notebook lying face down on the common room table. She picked it up, curious, but only caught a glimpse of the page before Harry returned from the bathroom and nervously snatched it back.
“Don’t I regret it.” She bemoaned loudly. Ron chucked a pillow at her head, then looked desperately sorry when it accidentally hit a bemused looking Luna.
Hermione threw her hands into the air. She sort of wished she believed in god just so she could renounce him right then and there. “You left dangerous magical objects in a girls lavatory?”
By Christmas morning Ron had seen the appeal of the castle at yule time. He didn’t know if it was extra festive for the visiting schools, but the excessive Christmas festivities reminded Ron of story books. He could hardly stop smiling all day, laughing at terrible Christmas cracker jokes and Fred and George’s good-natured pranks, reminiscing with his friends, listening to teachers’ stories and stuffing himself on so much food it almost put Molly Weasley’s Christmases to shame. Almost.
“It didn’t” Harry snapped, his voice harsh “I—we wouldn’t let anything happen to you Gin”
“Potter.” Snape drawled once, having appeared unheard behind them as they worked on a pepper-up potion. Harry had flung the powdered bicorn horn so high into the air that it had landed on Snape, dusting his greasy black bob in shimmering iridescent powder. Snape’s expression had been priceless and it had taken everything in Ron not to burst into laughter right there. He’d heard many of his classmates failing to do so behind him.
To top it all off, the boy was just weird.
Neville stares at Harry, speechless. The two were friends, of course, but never before had Harry been so honest or emotional with him. Neville imagined that when Harry got emotional like this, he went to Draco or Ron. Hermione maybe.
Draco came forward then, clearly fascinated “How do the charm it to do that?”
“Are you crazy?” Ron said, laughing in astonishment.
He would be lucky to get more than the one O he was guaranteed in Herbology.
“Don’t worry, don’t worry. I’m going to blind her. We found a spell before Christmas that would do it without too much pain. I was going to let her go at the end of the term. But I need her to leave now.”
Of course, they were already talking about the situation.
“Stop it, you two” Hermione scolded, and Ginny watched Ron make a silly face behind her back which set of Draco grinning. Hermione whipped around and glared at him and he blushed at being caught “Today” She said pointedly “I thought we’d go over Petrificus Totalus. Then we can go over any homework troubles anyone has”
Then Harry Potter comes blazing into Ron’s train compartment with a baffled Hermione Granger in tow, headed straight towards him like Ron Weasley is the most special thing in the world.
get all O’s even though he never bloody revises--”
Ginny looked at her deeply, eyes dancing with unspoken feeling “Happy Valentines day Lulu”
“Yes, yes,” Ron said, rolling his eyes, “You’re a powerful independent witch.”
“I need to finish something. Something I started a long, long bloody time ago.” Harry looked exhausted, suddenly. As if he hadn’t slept.
“How’s Draco?” Neville asked, sitting carefully on the bed beside Harry. Harry grinned at him, shifting over so Neville could lie down beside him and look at Draco in the mirror. He looked animatedly frustrated, as usual.
“I wasn’t sure if I should even come.” He said, looking round at the crowd. “What if it gets back to my parents?”
“So everything you’re doing is just guess work?”
He was certainly looking at her like she’d been a fool. “I’m Harry.” He said, voice coming out scratchy.
“Ah, the joy of parents.” Hermione sighed. Then she seemed to remember that their group contained Harry and Neville and she abruptly changed course.
“Ron-” Hermione exclaimed, looking at him with injured eyes. He cut her off.
ruined by it, because frankly mother’s had me in Paris half the summer and I’ve had rather more escargot and frogs legs then any Brit’s stomach can stand."
“For Merlin’s sake.” Said Ron, who didn’t like when there was credibility to Harry’s madness. It just encouraged him even more all the other times he was actually wrong.
“Cheer up, mate” Harry said, smearing jam on Ron’s nose. Ron batted uselessly at his hand “We’re seeing Hermione, today”
Then in quick succession she was joined at the red and gold table by a happy Ron and a thoughtful looking Harry, who would periodically glance over at a now blue-accented Draco in confusion.
Harry nodded. “I promise you, Kreacher.”
“Well don’t you think that that statement just says everything that needs to be said about The System” Hermione snapped. Each word was dripped, dipped and lavished in a helpful serving of disdain.
“People don’t notice me enough as a real person to think,” Neville said simply.
Harry began by outlining what the group was for “We change Defence teachers so much that we’re almost guaranteed an inconsistent education” He joked, and everyone chuckled.
Harry does an odd full body spasm and almost knocks over a jug of pumpkin juice. Hermione flushes darkly and tells him. “Ronald people have
Hermione was pretty sure this boy needed a friend. Or a psychologist. (She filed away a memo in her mind to ask for more information about magical healthcare and mental health attitudes)
Harry winced again, like he hadn’t meant to let that slip “I mean, yes, it’s just” He muttered a curse word under his breath, but Ginny spent so much time around Fred and George that it hardly phased her. What did phase her was when Harry started hissing. Not just normal hissing. Structured hissing with syntax and everything.
. Now, Malfoy, would you like to sit with us?”
“Maybe you should get Dean to do some stuff with you.” Hermone suggested. “You know he’s always scribbling.”
He pulled something else out from his pocket with his spare hand, the tossed it to her. It was another eye mask, this one with a line of ‘Z’s across it. “Here. I always bring a spare. But this on and don’t take it off no matter what happens”
He stopped, looking around. “Nevermind. I’ll explain in the car.”
Neville had shaved his own head and was deeply hoping that the spell they’d found to regrow hair would work. He didn’t think the skinhead look was right for him, however much he knew Sirius would be all over it.
“Frilly pink lingerie” Luna would agree, solemnly. Then they’d be falling about laughing again.
“Thank you for taking me in.” Neville said to them awkwardly.
“Just tell us what it is.” Hermione huffed.
But she felt, suddenly, that she could let it go.
Luna had brought them with her to see the thestrals. Ginny hadn’t entirely believed in their existence until a couple of visits in. Seeing the ground beef quickly disappear in bite-sized increments had been pretty compelling evidence.
“Are you an eldritch being, then?” Ginny demanded, elbows on hips. She knew she was once again channelling pure Molly Weasley.
Hermione stared at him. How could someone so frustratingly enigmatic come in the shape of a short eleven-year-old boy with messy hair and patched jeans? His glasses were even crooked for God’s sake.
“No.” Hermione said before Harry could get any words out. She calmly turned the page of her novel.
“Did someone tell you that it would be dangerous for someone else to know?”
“Who else’s fault was it?” Harry exploded, flinging his arms out “Pettigrews? Well guess who let Pettigrew escape? Jesus, Ron. I should have known. I should have stopped this. I’ve been lazy. Fucking complacent. Now Neville hasn’t got anyone to look out for him.”
“Are you okay?” He asked gently.
“Not this time.” Harry said grimly. "I’ve done everything I could, I’ll do more. He won’t die.”
The first meeting of the Defence Association, as Harry had called it with a wry smile, went entirely smoothly. So smoothly that it added absolutely nothing to her investigation except some insight into her brother’s strange friendship group.
“Take this.” He sneered, “And get out of my classroom.”
The worst, most terrible, no-good, awful, bad thing about Harry Potter was that Hermione couldn’t help but like him. However many times a day she found herself questioning the boys sanity, truthfulness or general real-ness as a person she just couldn’t seem to stop letting him hang around her. This was probably since Harry seemed to genuinely want to hang around her. Something that had never happened to her before. Harry happily asked her questions about the books she read, her family, and her theories on magical history and its relation to the muggle counterpart.
“What’s the point if you get yourself killed along the way?” Neville said, before he could stop himself. His own voice was fraught to his ears.
. Neville assumed Ron must have drawn it, then. He turned the paper over. On the back was a list of names, a long slash of black ink drawn through them all. At the bottom Hermione had written ‘
Instead, Harry softly closed the door, approaching Neville like a spooked deer.
Harry calmed the ginger boy down soon with tales of the muggle world- which Hermione interrupted every now and then to correct. Especially when Harry said things that were certainly not true. Harry would respond to her accusations of untruthfulness with unflinching cheeriness, and odd assurances such as, “That’s right, not
my godfather. And he’s in prison- there’s a wizarding prison called Azkaban- for the betrayal and subsequent murder of my parents. And for supposedly being a death eater. That’s a follower of Voldemort.”
He squeezed Hermione’s hand, thoughts hurtling as they sped closer and closer to London.
“The cheek of you, Potter. I’ll be telling your, er, Sirius.”
That made Ginny pause. She wondered what it would do to her to be left alone in the dark for hundreds of years. It would probably cause her to turn a bit murder-y, too.
But Hermione cut him off, saying ruefully, “Not like myself.”
Ron felt a surge of discomfort. There wasn’t anything special about him, he knew. Harry Potter of all people shouldn’t be singing his praise. But he couldn’t help basking in the praise slightly, even though he knew it wasn’t deserved.
“What would it have done to me?” Ginny whispered.
“She might as well be. Iphigenia is still out of action and with NEWTs coming up Kassandra is less and less involved,” Luna said, and Ginny sighed but didn’t contradict her.
On the train back the four of them happily squashed into a carriage at the back of the train. A lot had changed in a year. Ron was now rat-less and relaxed in himself. Draco’s hair had thankfully been released from its gel prison (a Ron suggestion) and he now had actual friends instead of just people who followed him around. Harry was visibly lighter this train ride then he had ever been before. He would be spending the summer with a real family, free to see his friends at any time, and with someone who finally knew his secret. All three boys grinned the whole way home.
Harry smiled incredibly wide “At least I get to live with them. It’s absolutely brilliant”
There was another laden silence, then Hermione sighed, pulling her bag towards her. From its depth she pulled a spiral bound notebook. Ron recognised it as one of her ‘Harry’ notebooks.
“Hogwarts is a weird bloody place,” Harrys aid, slapping Neville jovially on the back, “We have to go down there.”
But somebody did. Harry potter did. So did Ginny, Hermione, the rest.
“Harry’s right. Mate” Ron said, and Luna got the quiet thrill she always did at being one of the few Ron called ‘mate’ “No one should be on their own at Christmas”
Term began after Christmas without much fanfare. Draco regaled them happily with many re-enactments of is stuffy pureblood Christmas. They were promptly asked to leave the library for laughing too loudly. It was a sad day in Hermione’s life.
“Shurrup.” He grumbled, scanning the maze with bright eyes.
Neville and Harry stayed at the Burrow for a week after the wedding, so that the Lupin-Black’s could enjoy married life in peace for a short time. They sent the cats (Now numbering a worrying four. Sam and Frodo, the strays, joined by two spoilt kittens fittingly named Merry and Pippin.) to Tonks’ tiny London flat because Sirius thought it would be funny. Neville had been for tea and short play dates when he was younger but staying there was entirely different.
Then she had waltzed rather magnificently out of the room. Harry had murmured an abridged version of the events that transpired in Dumbledore’s office when he came to sit by them. Quirrell had apparently tried unsuccessfully to insist that there was nothing weird about spontaneously burning when a student touched your skin to an unconvinced McGonagall and Dumbledore. While Quirrell had been focused on them, Harry had finally succeeded at whipping Quirrell’s turban off his head to reveal You-know-who’s face merged with the back of the professor’s head. After an intense scuffle that had left half of Dumbledore’s office on fire, the three non-evil occupants of the room had been left with an unconscious Quirrell and absolutely no clue at all where You-know-who had gone. Harry told them that he could have sworn he saw some sort of magical cloud flow into and through the flames, but honestly Hermione thought that sounded fanciful. The whole thing sounded fanciful. And creepy.
“Close enough to be fucking scary, though.” Harry snarked.
The Weasley child who leisurely strolled to dinner instead of rushing down the stairs, fighting elbow to stomach, didn’t eat. Well. Molly Weasley wouldn’t be caught dead letting any of her children go to bed with empty stomachs.
He met Bill, a curse-breaker who worked for Gringotts, only once. They didn’t interact much beyond initial introductions, but Neville did notice that Harry, Ron and Hermione kept shooting him unreadable looks and would skirt away from him if he got to close. He wondered what that was about.
Harry sighed, and looked at a spiderweb on the ceiling instead of her face the whole time he answered. “He was-
“I’m fine not knowing.” A desperate edge to Harry’s voice.
Neville didn’t know where the cup went after they stole it. He still didn’t know why they had stolen it, at all. The trio remained as tight lipped as ever, and Neville was never again invited to one of their meetings.
“On your own?” Harry gaped, and everyone else in their group was looking at her aghast too.
“Are there actually any plants in the greenhouses that could get you high?” This had been a persistent rumour for a few months now, with Fred and George putting a lot of effort into trying to find out.
“Lots of people wanted her dead,” Neville croaked. Harry’s gaze jerked from his two best friends to look at Neville.
“No one’s ever wanted to be my friend except you” Luna said, voice not changing from its usual bland honesty. “No one likes me except you and daddy”
“Have you talked to him, Harry?” Hermione asked, her hands fretting.
Ron was just proofreading the last panel when there was a flurry of noise.
Perhaps, she thought, it was like the feeling she got every time she saw sparks fly from a wand or an incantation muttered, and she was reminded starkly of dirty blonde hair and purple smoke.
She had accepted rather early on what her future would look like. Birthday teas with just her parents. Sitting alone on the buses to school trips.
The domineering stone man glared down at Neville. He guessed it must be a depiction of Salazar Slytherin, if he had been the one to make the place. He probably wasn’t too happy to have two Gryffindors down here with him. Neville glared right back, because he was almost certain the stone couldn’t actually do anything to hurt him.
There was about 40 people from across the school, from all years and houses like the flyer said. A majority were Ravenclaws and Gryffindors, but there was a substantial quadrant of both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins. The Slytherins and other houses shot each other dirty looks at the beginning but seemed to strike a truce as the meeting went on.
. We can’t break into Gringotts. And before you say it, we are not breaking out on a dragon. Those poor creatures have been through enough.”
They went on a few rounds, everyone having a go. Only Harry and Ginny choosing dare which led Harry licking Hermione’s shoe and the funny and teetering sight of Ginny trying to balance on the tallest stack of pillows she could make. The truths were simple and often funny- just targeted questions to make fun of embarrassing things they’d done in front of each other.
He seemed to hold an odd vendetta against their Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell. To Hermione, he just seemed like your run-of-the-mill unsuited-to-the-profession teacher. Sure, it was slightly odd that he seemed terrified of his own students. And sure, the garlic smell was admittedly overwhelming. But Hermione thought Harry’s obsession with Quirrell’s turban was beginning to verge on culturally insensitive.
“No” he choked “Not again”
She definitely liked having Harry around, she decided happily.
“Alright” She said, swinging up one of the shovels “But you’re going to have to duplicate another shovel for me because you only have two”
Dad looked at him with furrowed brows, “Harry, you can’t know that.”
On Friday the post arrival was met with much anticipation. The headline read
The pages of this boys life run on in an endless marathon. I want to burn this place to the ground. Watch every page become mangled and unreadable. I want to never see these green eyes again. I want them shut to the world, finally blind to all the brutal pain and loss. Is this my punishment? To watch an inferno burn itself to embers, a life lived itself to pale imitation.
But there are things you teach intentionally, and things you teach by your own unconscious action. It went the other way too. There were things you knew you knew, and there were truths that stayed hidden just under your thoughts for the whole of your life. A layer beneath your own skin that even you don’t know is there. Truths you learned before you were even old enough to remember the occasion, but which you always carried with you.
, and then suddenly she was sliding under the kitchen table cloth and sitting under the table. The eating the jam thing with her fingers had just been a natural progression of events.
“Luna?” Harry repeated, looking perturbed.
“It all seems pretty… home-spun.” George said, appearing next to the wardrobe. Neville could only tell them apart because they’d slipped Weasley jumpers with their initials on. Then again, he had no idea if they were wearing the right one.
The silence in the common room had been defeating. They all waited for more, but no more came. That was it. The room burst into chatter, into panic, into tears.
“What?” Draco yelled, coming to Harry’s side. “What the hell?”
“Don’t act like you don’t want to.” Harry laughed. “She’s in the library.”
“Well he’s a death eater, of course. But in my time, he became our defence teacher in disguise. He entered my name in the Triwizard tournament and I had to compete, then at the end of the year he sent me to Voldemort so he could be brought back.”
Ron and Dean had found a surprising dream-team in producing a comic- with Ron writing and Dean illustrating. Seamus wrote a small column about Football for the muggleborns.
They step into a simple room, made plain in its banality. Softly carpeted, tastefully wallpapered, lightly furnished. There was two stuffed high-back armchairs facing a small spindly table with a record player atop it. Next to the table was a milk-bottle crate filled with records. Just as her mother’s had been.
“Now, now young man, that is not for you to decide” Fudge says imperiously.
Ron grinned ferally, dusting his robes off with haphazard sweeps and drabbing the shoes off of Nev. “Cheers mate.”
Finally, his wand alighted on something, something under a desk. He shot forward, falling to his knees. Two tiny clouds of dust appeared where his knees fell. He leant forward, reaching his hand out and grabbing what was under the desk.
ha ha ha! remember when i said i'd have this done by christmas? well merry christmas you filthy animals and have chapter 3 i guess lmao.
Not much stands out to Molly about Ron's birth except for how conveniently quick it had been compared to all that palaver with the twins.
At least, that’s what she’d observed from being around these particular boys. Ron and Draco had spent their first week of acquaintance on a path to mutually assured destruction. In fact Hermione had found herself considering the intelligence of becoming close to either of them, when it was clear that they would never be able to remain cordial around each other. It was only ever going to end in disaster. Then came the chess match. Ah, that first tense chess match. Half of Gryffindor tower had gathered to watch the youngest Weasley just marginally triumph over the first Malfoy in a century not to be sorted into Slytherin at a game of Wizard’s chess. Hermione had truly believed that Draco would up and leave the Gryffindor tower never to be seen again. Instead, the boy had grinned a rare real grin and held out his hand for Ron to shake.
“Is that
It took Neville only seconds to catch on. “Harry, you
Snape’s eyes crew closer together in suspicion. “What research would require an eleven-year-old boy to inquire in to the cost and distribution of a rare, advanced,
“Why Sharon?” Hermione had asked.
“Not the forest. The Acromantulas wouldn’t have her. She’s going up into the mountains.”
Sirius spits on the ground near Pettigrew’s feet “You were our friend because James let you hang around with us. And in return you killed him”
Luna knew she was lucky to have the friends she did- and she knew that she wouldn’t have them at all if just a few small things were different. If the Weasleys weren’t the closest Wizarding family to her house. If Harry wasn’t so persistent. If Draco wasn’t in her house.
“Will she get in trouble?” Neville asked quietly, bending down to slip on arm under her shoulder and heave her up to standing position.
In the pause that followed his words, Hermione was sure she counted one full orbital period of the planet Neptune.
a powerful independent witch.” Hermione said indignantly.
Their first lesson of the day is also their first defence class of the year.
He didn’t give them the silent treatment. He just turned the volume down. Also, because he was emotionally intelligent but certainly not emotionally mature, he made a pointed effort to be as normal and full volume as possible with everyone who wasn’t them.
“What?” Ron said, and he could tell he’d let too many emotions bleed into his voice because Harry and Hermione shared an alarmed look of panic.
They hadn’t been as couple-y when at Hogwarts. Meaning, Neville hadn’t walked in on them snogging. Yet. But they were holding hands a lot, now for instance. Neville and Harry grinned at each other when they both noticed.
“Hermione, look!” Harry shouted suddenly, pointing out of the window. Hermione whipped her head around, craning to see. There, through the impeccably clear window, was-
Neville placed that one on the floor, too. The next thing was a muggle photograph, still and unmoving. It was of the East End of Diagon alley, Gringotts in centre. Heart racing, Neville picked up the last smaller piece of parchment.
Hermione was incredibly grateful that the two had found something to bond over, as she didn’t want to give either of them up. Ronald was leaps and bounds ahead of the other two in terms of emotional maturity, and frankly hilarious. Hermione knew she tended to become too serious and lose herself in studying. Ron always found a way to give her grateful distractions or to bring levity to stressful situations she couldn’t seem to solve. He may not be the most academically focused person she’d ever met, and he definitely did not have enough respect for the sacred hall that was the Library, but he was the only other person who knew how to deal with Harry Potter and honestly that said a lot about him. Harry was stressful at the best of times.
“Maybe you should just go back then” Harry said, pointing towards the tunnel entrance which had led them out to the shrieking shack of all places.
“Sorry” Harry said “Erm. It’s just I’ve seen pictures” He shrugged awkwardly “I know who you are”
Lots of people had been asking how he was.
“Mate,” Harry said with a laugh from behind him, “You are so clueless.”
Neville sighed, leaving forward to pluck a box off of the coffee table, “Remember when we said a relaxing Friday night with no war talk?” He held the box up, “Cluedo, anyone?”
Harry grinned. Ron groaned.
“There’s a basilisk under the school” Ginny squeaked, then felt ashamed for sounding so
But he was cut of by Harry’s cry of joy as he flung himself down the stairs and wrapped his arms around the man tightly. He was so thin that Harrys short arms only just missed meeting around the back.
“it’s Harry. Something dumb”
“Why are you trying to destroy them?” Neville asked, watching the objects with more wariness. Anything that could only be destroyed by basilisk venom wasn’t something to be taken lightly. But it just looked like ordinary things to Harry- A cup, some kind of necklace. A plain black diary.
“Come on” Ginny said, tugging Luna’s hand. Luna had gotten distracted by something out on the grounds and Ginny hadn’t noticed she was walking alone until she reached the end of the corridor and looked back. It was pretty embarrassing. She’d continued talking to herself that whole time.
She’s not a part of the investigation”
dragon’ and—” Ron was saying loudly, hands flying in gesticulation. He paused when he noticed Harry had stopped. Harry had stopped abruptly when he saw Neville standing there.
That was another truth. Although the Parkinson’s were traditionally Slytherin, they were a young-money family. Their business was in parchment production.
“She won’t! We have an agreement. No eating anything me-shaped.” Harry said this calmly, as if he was certain a great bloody big snake would keep it’s word.
“I’m sorry!” Harry yelled back, stepping further into Neville’s space, “I
“It’s nice, in a way, that you two are friends” He said, though he sounded doubtful “Let’s hope he’s nothing like his father”
But when Neville and Harry had been brought in to shed light, she’d scowled at everyone in the room fiercely, “Why would I jeopardise the oracle? I spend half my time on that thing.”
Harry laughed shortly, “It’s not that many excuses. Thanks for coming down with me.”
He looked at Hermione, “You still at ours, this year?” Hermione nodded, “Well I’m afraid that also means you’ll be living at the headquarters for the—”
“Sorry, Harry. What are you planning now?” She said, resigned. Ron snorted from the other side of the room.
Not to mention, he was getting really sick of walking into rooms and having everyone go silent. One day he would figure out what the hell Hermione, Ron and Harry found it so pertinent to shut up about as quickly as they always did.
And never stops - at all -
Luna stared into his eyes for a moment longer, trying to figure out the mystery that was Harry Potter. She sighed.
“And I said yes, but only if it was three more millennia’s” Sirius answered, and opened the ring box with a deep click “Well Remus Lupin, its been a decade and a half but would you still want to spent the next three millennia’s with me?”
Neville had gotten hardly any way down the corridor when Harry turned the corner. Harry frowned at him for a moment. “Nev.” He said simply.
“That would be terrible,” Luna murmured. Worry always looked out of place on Luna’s face. She never seemed to worry about anything at all.
Hermione considered this for a moment. She sort of wanted to tell him no seen as it was indirectly his fault that she’d used up her first one so fast. Eventually she shrugged and passed him the green one and a biro. “Here, Harry. Consider it an early Christmas present.” She frowned. “Just don’t plan a murder in it.” She frowned harder. “Just don’t implicate me
“Here’s what we’re going to do—”
In and between their little adventures was stuffed two other things. First, a harried effort from the adults to fit Christmas cheer and tradition around their own busy schedules of meetings and scouting missions. Second, the plan.
The door was unlocked when Harry went to open it. She supposed you didn’t much have to worry about crime when your house was literally invisible to anyone who didn’t know it was there.
But the terrible, horrible, very wrong thought of Harry and Hermione in some grand secret romance made something painful and vitally important clench in Ron’s chest. It made something rage. Because-
Harry looks at her, brow furrowed. “I suppose” He looks back after the group of auroras “I suppose I have to be alright”
“No, it’s for…research.” Harry said lamely.
Molly Weasley was desperately nice, a far more maternal figure than his late Gran had been. She fussed over him desperately. So much that Harry quipped it was nice to have a break. Arthur was kind to a fault, listening intently as Neville awkwardly stuttered through an odd fact about plants. He then excitedly had Neville explain to him the differences in the muggle plant kingdom, which Neville did as best he could.
Harry slapped him jovially on the back, “It’s fine. Why don’t you ask Hermione?”
Which was when things got decidedly weirder.
He spent some time with Seamus and Dean, but they were so insular that it was hard to spend a prolonged amount of time with them before developing a complex or a migraine.
“He’s got you there, mate.” Harry said between snorts. “Poor, poor you.”
“I won’t pretend to know what that is,” Ron said.
“If we go do this for you, you’re going to owe us so much.” Ron said, sighing and shaking his head.
“He still doesn’t trust him.” Hermione said harshly, and Ron’s eyebrows shot up.
A dreary London had only just begun to dissolve into green fields and pig pens when Draco broached the elephant in the train carriage.
He didn’t notice Hermione stare at
A boy with blonde hair cries over a casket and thinks that he should have been smarter. Loved someone with the ambition to live, not the bravery to die a hero's death.
“Ah, ah,” Ron said, waggling his finger mockingly, “Poisonous plant. Gotta start my readers off small and build anticipation from there.”
“Bonjour!” A cheerful voice trilled. They all stopped as Fleur Delacour bound up to them, looking just as beautiful despite the mud on her face and her torn robes.
Ron was disproportionally happy when he watched them separate off to bed without anything close to a loving embrace. Maybe that shouldn’t be what Ron focused on, but it was what made his chest feel funny all the same.
Percy whipped around and glared at the twins, who looked shifty “Do
Ginny couldn’t contain her grin.
“If I wanted a master chess player, shouldn’t I just go and tell Ron?”
Back in September when she’d turned twelve, they hadn’t even known each other that well but Ron had still presented her with a candle lit cupcake at breakfast and that had been the first day Draco had sat at Gryffindor table with them. He’d spent the whole time looking over his shoulder waiting for someone to tell him off. Harry had presented her with a badly wrapped package which had turned out to be a very pretty blue parrot feather quill.
“Will Sirius let them do it here anymore?” Neville said doubtfully.
Ginny scowled at them both, stomping over to her cauldron and staring down at her cauldron assessing.
“Then who do you suppose is responsible, Potter?” He snarled, lips curling over his gums.
Harry nodded thoughtfully, obviously mulling over what she’d told him. She grabbed Harry’s hand lightly and started tracing patterns on the back of his hand. Harry didn’t seem to notice.
It was almost Halloween now, and they had decided to crowd together on this Friday night to take a break from schoolwork. And from the news which every day seemed to be filled more and more with horrible ‘unexplained’ attacks and deaths.
Ginny laughed “I guess I’m just not that direct”
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, looking sheepish. “I’ve lived this before. Sort of. Not this, specifically. I, uh, wasn’t time travelling last time.”
Then September came, as it unfailingly did, and with it her eleventh birthday. Set to be just another rerun of the previous years, this year had featured an impromptu guest. Magical Professor McGonagall with her ability to turn in to a cat, and her magic wand, and her
They walked down those steps now, and Harry, who looked terrible as a blonde, took the lead.
Hermione frowned, abandoning her pursuit of the escapee playing card. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
They drank, Neville only butterbeer, in companionable misery until the wedding ended. It was surprisingly pleasant.
But she cut herself off suddenly, almost as soon as Harry touched his proffered paper. In fact, everyone in the hall holding a newspaper suddenly froze, the lack of noise in the hall deafening. Neville, who hadn’t touched the paper placed in front of him yet, stared around in shock.
“I thought you said you were packed two days ago?” Sirius said, frantic as he sat on Harry’s trunk and Harry tried to belt t shut.
Ron began his work on 'The Adventures of Barry Blotter' on Christmas eve-eve, when the lazy merriment got too much even for his languid soul. Dean sat beside him on the sofa, laughing at what he wrote and creating fun sketches and cartoons to follow the storyline.
Ron should have predicted it, but he didn’t. So, when Harry went racing down the hill towards the group at the gate, Ron was a few steps behind. He reached them moments after Harry, but it didn’t matter. Harry was standing stock-still in stunned silence.
Draco smiled at Harry with a pleased expression. “I know. I’m the best.”
“They don’t have to know that” Harry pointed out.
“All I was going to say was that we should go into London.”
The next occurrence in the Great Saga of Harry Potter came after potions on the Friday before Halloween. Harry was usually the first one out of the doors of the potion’s dungeon when the bell for the end of the period went. They’d had it first today, so everyone else had taken their time packing up and talking to their friends before walking to wherever it was they would usually spend their breaktimes. Hermione had expected to pack up her equipment before walking out into the hallway with Ron and Draco to find an uncomfortable Harry waiting for them, as always. This day went differently.
“You know, Harry, I knew your mother rather well” Vance said in her thick Irish accent. She’d been making her rounds about the classroom assessing everybody’s progress on the task. She’d paused at their table to correct Neville’s wand movements before his
“You were pen pals if I remember correctly.” Harry said blithely, looking at Hermione sideways. Ron spluttered. Harry laughed, muttering to himself. “Yes. I remember you acting like that too.”
He blushed and shook himself out of it. Merlin he could be such a
Hermione just kept watching Harry’s face. A blooming joy began to dawn across his face. The sun coming out, finally, after months of rain.
Harry and Neville exchanged amused glances. All the adults had become more frantically protective as the summer wore on and more reports of unexplained muggle attacks had surfaced.
Ron snorted “Wait till you see what it is before you thank us mate”
She reached the Post-office and collected her dads’ package with ease. Then she took a moment to sit on a bench and sketch the village church, with its spire reaching up to pierce the drifting clouds, sure that her father wouldn’t mind.
“How did she die?” Ginny said with interest, grabbing the paper and unfolding it to read. “Oo. Says they think an assassin broke in. Wonder who wanted her dead?”
The entry dated March 10
“We should tell Ron soon.” Harry said quietly.
Then he sat down rather ungracefully next to Hermione and proceeded to begin a two-hour conversation about the book, magical theory as a whole, and Hogwarts. This surprisingly interesting conversation was interspersed by Harry’s strangely effective attempts to interrupt Ron and Malfoy’s, who it turned out was called Draco, barbs at each other’s families.
And then Harry was in front of him, screaming into his face. But Neville couldn’t hear it, his head was under water. Under flames. He was going to die down here. Swallowed by a blazing green fire dragon.
To do anything but stand there and chant.
To be fair Luna had been pretty shaken when Flitwick had entered their peaceful common room (peaceful by Ravenclaw standards; meaning at least three heated debates were taking place complete with encyclopaedias to both support points made and slam angrily closed in frustration) and announced that they were all being moved to the Great Hall for the night while the castle was searched. Peter Pettigrew had been spotted outside Gryffindor tower, screaming dementedly at the fat lady and brandishing a silver dagger. When he’d spotted his witnesses he’d apparently vanished into thin air, causing many screams and calls for help.
. If they want to tell me something, they will. Anyway. I don’t tell them everything, either”
he said, ‘that’s not
“From what you’ve said it didn’t.”
Harry pouted, then let out a long sigh, “It’s been hard. I’ve changed a lot. But- the big things. People I lost. People I might lose—I can’t have it happen again. I’m trying to save people.”
“Can’t imagine not having Fleur,” Ron said considering, Ginny nodded vigorously.
“Sound good?” Harry said. The twins whooped loudly and everyone else made murmurs of agreement “Cool. Today Oliver and Percy have agreed to show us the stunning charm”
“And where does a curious thing like you belong, eh? Don’t worry youngling, you’ve got the right of it. You
She shakes her head. She keeps her sunny smile blazing right on him. “Oh, Harry. I’m
Luna gripped Ginny’s hand tightly and from across the hall Percy Weasley let out an indomitable Weasley shush.
“I don’t know” Harry said, shrugging “I guess I want to focus on other things”
“You do not seem keen to be around me.” Dumbledore stated, echoing Neville’s thoughts.
The elf vanished with out a crack but Hermione hardly had the chance to open her mouth and ask a question before he was bag, holding what looked like a parcel of old, crushed black velvet.
“You never revise, you hardly do your homework. How do you get the same grades than
Luna was sitting with Hermione and Draco in the Ravenclaw common room. Luna had been playing chess (and losing) against Draco when the letter had arrived from his father. The Gryffindor’s had promptly been summoned. According to Hermione Ron was unavailable due to having a detention. Apparently he had managed to annoy Snape in lesson. Harry had come with Hermione but had vanished mid research to gather food and as he put it ‘resources’.
“Hippogriffs are very sensitive” Luna nodded sagely.
Draco isn’t a very nice person, Luna thinks. He’s just far enough from sarcastic so as to come up snide. He’ll make biting remarks regardless of whether you be friend or foe and he’ll only ever consider employing kindness when telling the blunt truth if he thinks it will get him somewhere. He isn’t nice. But nice isn’t everything. Nice isn’t always anything at all. Nice is a veneer; a well-practised mirage. The glaze over a misshapen pastry. Nice is all well and FINE, for certain. But Draco isn’t nice. He’s good. Luna thinks Sondheim had it right with that distinction.
“He’s in the box.” Harry clarified, entirely unhelpfully.
Neville peered into it and spotted the little yellow cup they’d liberated from Bellatrix Lestrange’s vault resting on a pile of other objects.
Draco groaned dramatically. Ron thought that most of his friends were pretty dramatic. It could be exhausting being the only one out of them that didn’t react to minor obstacles as if they were life-changing events. It was also slightly worrying that the only friend he found serenity with was Luna. That kind of fact could shake a boys sanity.
Harry continued to look at the notebooks. After a few minutes, in which he finally managed to notice the ketchup and wipe it off and Ron actually managed to spill what seemed like half a bottle of the stuff down his white shirt, he cautiously spoke. “Would it be okay if I had one of those? Obviously, I’d pay you back ‘Mione.” He hurriedly added. “It’s okay to say no.”
Hermione, who as usual had them seated at the front of the class, couldn’t refrain from exclaiming, “Oh how interesting! In a philosophical or functional capacity?”
Ron and Harry spent minimal time on their hair- only attempting to get it to lay flat and then giving up when it did whatever it wanted anyway. But they did spend a raucous half-hour cheering Neville on and watching in fascination as he fastidiously did his hair.
Luna plucked a Ravenclaw-blue record up with her fingers nimbly and shook it lightly at Draco. “This is a record, it has all the actual music on it. When you put the record on the player and then put the needle down, it spins and that makes it play music.”
Draco but his head on the desk with a groan. “Where’s Harry with cream cakes when you need them?” He said to the wood grain. Hermione patted him distractedly on the head, eyes scanning the page in front of her.
“Better to have loved—” Neville began, but Tonks cut him of with a groan.
, Ron thought.
“As if I could forget, Hermione.”
They ran together, shoulder to shoulder, the flames following them with a vengeance. They dived into the tunnel, a screaming green Horned Serpent dived in after them, splitting itself into three smaller versions which danced and grasped for them. The rush of oxygen hammered in Neville’s ear.
“You wilfully attacked a wizard?” Diggory boomed with indignation.
“Here, Gin, you have these” Harry said, suddenly, and she felt a tipping weight in her cauldron. Harry was next to her again, Lockhart finally back at his signing table. Harry had tipped Lockhart’s entire collected works into her cauldron. She frowned “Lockhart gave me these free, but I’ll just buy my own. I don’t want anything from him anyway”
Hermione wasn’t entirely sure what this was. She couldn’t learn everything about magical history in two months. But Ron let out a whistle.
Hermione had often hit the same wall during her twelve year and ongoing career as A Nosy Person. At one point or another, you would run into a situation that wouldn’t reveal the truth to you no matter how much you snooped or researched or made lists. In these situations, she found you had two options; 1. Let it go; 2. Trap the annoying truth with-holder in a room and bombard them with questions until they crack under pressure and tell you what she want to know.
“Oh, call me Molly” Her mum said, coming forward to envelope the scrawny boy in a hug. Ginny could tell that her mother was already making plans to adopt him as her eighth child.
Sirius was fixing his cuffs, which were shaped like tiny little howling wolf heads, the only part of his outfit missing were his coattails. Neville had wondered why the grooms had decided to marry in muggle dress, before it had been explained to him that Remus had been raised a muggle, despite his father’s wizarding blood, and wanted to honour his heritage. “I just want to piss off my dead family.” Sirius had said, laughing. “And I look great in a suit.”
“Fine. I’ll come with you,” Harry shook his head, as if he hadn’t expected Neville to accept his earlier offer. “I’m coming with you, Harry,” Neville’s voice brooked no argument, he squeezed Harry’s wrist lightly, “I’m a little bit worried you’re about to off yourself.”
“Nah” Harry said, slathering a scone with a sickening amount of jam and cream. His hair was cresting towards the ceiling like a wave. She giggled slightly because it made him look like a mad scientist or an 80’s muggle rocker.
Hermione was very passionate about the welfare state.
“Wotcher, Nev.” She said, voice monotone. Neville noticed a few empty glasses around her. She didn’t seem drunk, but maybe that was because Neville had only witnessed Sirius Black and his uncle truly drunk and they both became astoundingly exuberant on the stuff.
Luna slipped shoes on (the first time she’d worn any in days, she realised) and headed off down the hill towards Ottery St. Catchpole. She walked along the river. The Otter was slow today and shallow, shrinking away from its banks. It had been an unusually pleasant summer, especially where they were at the bottom of the country.
” He whimpers from the floor. His hands are bound with a silver chain (“Anti-Animagus charms” Auror Tonks had explained.) “I’m your friend”
He stepped up and plucked the box out of Harry’s hand, tossing it nervously in the air and catching it. Harry gave him a wondering look. Sirius grinned ruefully, and then he turned and knelt down in front of Professor Lupins armchair.
Luna was quiet, her head drifting up to watch some clouds slip by in lazy tendrils. “If I’m not in Gryffindor, too, will you still be friends with me?”
?” Hermione demanded.
This seemed to mollify Kreacher slightly, “Master promises?”
all my love
“You can’t know that Harry.” She said primly, “Maybe they’ll fly.”
Neville kissed him. He grabbed Harry’s soot stained collar and pulled him upwards, so that he matched the few inches Neville had on him. Then he crushed his mouth to the crazy hero’s, mouth desperate. Harry kissed back, hands wrapping around Neville’s neck.
” Harrys voice cracked. Rising in volume, “Neville there’s no other way. I have to burn this shit- it’s a fucking cancer on our lives and I’m the only one,” His entire face winced, as if in pain, “I’m all alone in trying to stop it from choking our whole world.”
“Counter-curses
“He’d be silly to.” Tonks mumbled. The two women smiled at each other for a long moment, as if the rest of them weren’t there. Huh, Ron thought, wonder what’s happening there.
And final, with a curdling scream, the door snapped into place, the shifting stone snakes curling their way back into place. Harry and Neville stood in place, panting, hands still pressed against the door as if the fire might burst through at any moment.
“Have you ever heard of a student newspaper being run at Hogwarts?” Harry asked, voice laced with obviously forced nonchalance.
Hermione and Ron exchanged another worried look before following quickly after him. Ron threw a harried “bye,” over his shoulder at Kreacher.
“Oh” Ginny said, feeling shut out. “Okay then”
The thing let out a frog like croak, like it hadn’t spoken in years, before addressing Harry, “Kreacher is serving you, Master. Though he is not knowing you at all.”
“I don’t see why we don’t just tell him.”
At the end of term feast, the group positioned themselves strategically with all three Gryffindors on the bench facing the Ravenclaw table and Draco right ahead of them. They spent the whole dinner (including Dumbledore’s slightly frazzled speech) in an elaborate game of charades, with a few confused Hufflepuffs caught in the crossfire before they eventually gave in and moved out of the way.
“You’re right ‘Mione” Harry said eventually “I am
“May our education never prosper” George finished.
Hermione shuddered “And instead I swear I’ve found him worshipping in front of them a few times”
Her mane of dark brown curls, more often than not messy from being shoved in practical buns and plaits, had been smoothed into neat ringlets. There were hundreds off them, falling all around her shoulders in a crown of hair. Her dress was periwinkle blue, dusting just above her knees. It was a starkly beautiful contrast to her dark skin, which seemed to glitter at her collar bones and shoulders with gold. Ron wondered if Lavender and Parvati had been allowed for just one night to attack her with make-up brushes. She’d extended her average height by a few inches with conservative, dainty heels. When she walked up to Ron she now stood at his shoulders, not his mid-chest.
things.” Ginny went on, ignoring Hermione completely. “And after it happens, we’ll all just go on acting as if it’s not weird even though it
“Harry’s got you onto that muggle rubbish too, eh? Knew he’d cause an epidemic one day” He jokes. Sounding much surer of himself.
was walking across the grounds from the direction of the Whomping willow towards the school.
His voice tilted up in pitch at the end, as if he wasn’t entirely sure of his own accuracy. This was the sort of thing he’d been doing all train journey, so Hermione wasn’t really surprised. The Malfoy kid looked vaguely confused for a moment, before his expression switched to that of someone who was used to everything always being right in the world when it came to him.
“Who indeed?” Hermione said snidely, shooting Harry an unreadable look.
To her surprise, nothing looked out of order.
“Shit. Nothing else.” The passageway they had come in through was already swarmed by students. “Fuck.” Harry yelled passionately. Neville almost scolded him because of the first-year present, but quickly squashed that impulse. “Come on.” Harry said, tugging Neville’s hand roughly.
Pandora Lovegood had died in a flash of purple smoke. A spell gone wrong. A spell gone so terribly wrong. Luna had been perfectly safe in her bubble across the room, screaming.
“You’re twelve” Ginny said, voice flat “I’m not letting you apparate me”
Bellatrix Lestrange was dead. Dead. She had tortured Neville’s parents and haunted his dreams his whole life and yet—and yet she had died in her cell, locked away. All alone.
Harry looked confused, “What d’you mean?”
“Those are proper galleons as well.” Harry said, proudly ignoring his two male best friends. “Not that fake Leprechaun shite.”
“Harry! Ronald!” A cloud of bushy black hair whipped by Ginny and engulfed Harry. It was the girl from the picture. Hermione, she thought. Ron was grinning so brightly at the girl that Ginny thought it might crack his face wide open.
hope you enjoy this chapter. any mistakes are my own
The announcer began to talk, and cheers went up in the crowd. Harry let out a whoop, grinning.
Ron frowned, “I don’t know why you’re so convinced somethings going to happen.”
“It will get her killed,” Fleur said, voice cracking.
“And doesn’t it bother you?” Ginny exclaimed, annoyed at her brothers’ blasé attitude “Him and Hermione have this…secret. Doesn’t it make you jealous”
But the boy didn’t look like he wanted to run away from the redheads. In fact, his face screamed with the exact same expression her old cat had adopted anytime the fridge was opened. Pure, desperate wanting. Hermione watched, fingers itching to grab her notebook out of her rucksack so she could write down her observations and come to a correct conclusion about the mystery, when the boy turned his head-
“We were in the Room of Requirement,” He said. Neville felt illogically jealous that all of his friends had been together without him, he let it fuel the flame burning in his chest.
Harry shrugged awkwardly “Read it in a book.”
“What are you saying?” Neville asked, trying to keep the whimper out of his voice.
” The stern man said with bafflement when he saw the small figure. Then his eyes fell to the man and his face went visibly chalk-white even in the dim light.
They fled.
Harry and Neville both happily left on the quest to collect Iphigenia. They found her sitting alone on the entrance hall stairs, looking dazed off into the distance.
“Is fifth year when you went to live with Sirius?” Ron asked innocently.
“Well,” Luna said serenely, “I don’t see why it can’t be both,”
“Give me a moment, Gin” Harry said, not cruelly but clearly focused. Ginny stopped talking and instead just watched over his shoulder.
“No.” Harry breathed out. His fingers were white knuckled on the paper, crumpling the pages under his grip. “No, this didn’t happen last time.”
“Yes, daddy” Luna called through the kitchen back door which was swung open to the world. The Lovegood house always maintained an open-door and open-window policy throughout the summer. Luna would wander in and out of the house and gardens barefoot, as if one was simply an extension of the other. In the summer it felt as if the whole of the Devon countryside was one big greenhouse, sun-baked with the same quiet still air. Luna would wander for hours, alone or with Ginny, and then pause in nooks and crannies of the world- tree roots, the shade of crumbled stone walls, with her feet dipped into rocky streams. She’d read or draw or Ginny would tell her her marvellous made up stories.
“You can’t control the whole world. Some people are just going to go about being neo-Nazis whatever you do.” Hermione said sympathetically. Ron didn’t know what neo-Nazis were, but of Hermione could but that much vehemence into the words he guessed they were bad.
“We can’t tell you anything else” Harry said, regretfully.
“That’s when we’re going to do it. Easter break.”
It was only later on while he tried to sleep that the rest of the conversation began to nag at him.
. I’ve never liked you more.”
Ginny was on her way back from the Great hall on Valentines day- where Ginny and Luna had munched happily on heart shaped French toast and made fun of Valentines day in its entirety- when she spotted Harry Potter entering the second-floor girls’ bathroom. This was weird twofold. 1. No one used the second-floor girls’ bathroom. 2. Harry potter was not a girl.
Ron was glaring at Harry, “Why the hell are you covered in soot, mate?”
“You don’t think that is important?” Dumbledore said, slightly incredulous. Neville had never seen the headmaster show so much emotion.
“For god’s sake.” She said, pulling a lid off one of her muggle quills, “Lets plan this bloody thing then.”
“Run!” Harry hollered, finding his way to his feet and sprinting towards Neville just as another comet of green fire burst forth to take him.
Luna had almost forgotten the pile of presents stacked precariously under the tree, spilling outwards. They had been lost in the thrill of three practically violent rounds of charades, an almost disastrous game of Pictionary and far too many off-key renditions of Christmas songs- both muggle and wizarding. Luna thought it was possibly against the Geneva conventions to play Celestina Warbeck back-to-back with “Wonderful Christmas Time”.
“So weird” Ron said, rolling his eyes “You and Hermione both- you read too much”
“You died?” Ron exclaimed, staring at his best friend in horror. The idea f not having Harry around, as odd and nonsensical as he could be, was incomprehensible. Harry was like Hogwarts itself. Unable to not exist. “You

Harry laughed softy at her shock and shifted awkwardly “Like… school? and some other stuff. Private stuff”
“This is dark magic. Indestructible,” He sighed. “Almost. Bev could have done it but she never would, no matter how much I asked. I didn’t want to hurt her. That was basilisk fangs out of the picture.”
For a second she could swear she saw the sink moving, before she blinked and everything was normal again. Huh.
“I don’t get it at all.” Harry said sharply, and Neville looked up at him with surprise.  “What your family went through- what you went through- Neville it was horrific. I say sorry,” Harry scoffed, “Like that means anything. My parents died senselessly, but at least—” He stops again, mouth pursed with unsaid words, “I’m so sorry. I can’t imagine the pain.”
Neville Longbottom couldn’t comment on having strangers in the house, although he too was a full time resident of the house and had been since the beginning of the summer holiday. That had been in June and even now, in August, he still wasn’t used to it.
“I’ve never gotten them cancelled.” Harry said with a frown.
Never trust Harry Potter’s Plan Face.

“What do you tell them?” Ron asked, taking a bite of a sausage sandwich as he read over Harry’s shoulder.
“I’m not a rag-doll.” She huffed, flushing.
“April is statistically Gringotts least busy month,” Hermione said, shrugging.
Ginny Weasley is sitting under the kitchen table, eating out of the jam jar with two fingers and definitely
“Yes, but we were enemies then.” Harry pointed out, voice making it clear that this was something Ron should already know.
“You don’t think it’s a ministry cover-up, do you?” Ginny asked giddily, completely unaware of Bellatrix’ significance.
When she’d tentatively offered him a hello, he’d made a strangled, dying cat sound in the back of his throat, and landed heavily on the opposite bench of seats, head in hands.
Over his shoulder he yelled “Stop stalking my best friend!”
Under the tree was a small ring box. Harry leaned over and picked it up. “No label” He said.
“Oh, god.” Harry had said, as if involuntarily. “Please, no.”
Ron didn’t say anything. A silence took over the classroom that seemed unbroachable. His brain decided not to process that information. Instead it just came to a complete standstill.
“Oh, brilliant” Hermione said, smiling widely “Draco managed to stay as well so it was even better”
“Right.” Ron said disbelievingly, rolling his eyes. “Whatever.”
“She never said anything. But yeah, I bet she wasn’t. We spent fifth year at Sirius’ and sixth year at the Burrow.” Harry smiled wistfully. “That year was brilliant.”
“Here,” Hermione said, handing Ron a lumpy and un-symmetrical knitted scarf, “Harry told me to take up knitting.”
Harry sighed, looking at the box forlornly. “Yeah, it is. Life’s absolutely ridiculous isn’t it?”
i'm so sorry.
“Nah. It comes out outside of Hogwarts grounds. Twisty Hogwarts magic, you know.”
“Well, no” Dean laughed “He and Hermione have asked some upper years to teach.” He frowned thoughtfully “Though to be honest Harry is freakily smart at Defence”
“They’re a strain of fruit bat specially bred by the Russian Wizarding Government who listen in on conversations and then report back to their leaders. They used them extensively during the Wizarding Cold war. Everyone knows that” Luna said absentmindedly, her focus on a fluffy white cat that was rolling about in front of the Owl Emporium.
Thank you to everyone who interacted with the first chap of the fic! Encouragement keeps me thriving. heads up i was both sick and hungover at different periods writing this chap so i apologise if it sucks. the sophomore curse ya know. if you're here for shippy stuff, i promise you that will be very much present in later chapters.
“This is surreal,” he whispered.
“Can’t. McGonagall won’t let me” Luna said “But thank you Harry, you’re sweet”
, not
“Dead,” Harry said simply, shrugging.
Harry turned around with obvious surprise, and she was treated to a clear view of what he was carrying. It was an ordinary black shoebox, taped all around the lid with copious amounts of spello-tape. From where they stood, she could spot that there were holes in the lid, as if someone had stabbed it repeatedly with a sharp pencil. As Hermione watched, the box rocked, as if something had slammed itself against one side of the box.
“Harry Potter does” Colin said, voice a little dreamy like it always was when he talked about Harry. Ginny had warned him of the boy multiple times to no avail.
The truth was Neville didn’t know. He didn’t think he’d ever known. He didn’t think he’d ever been anything, ever. Just a nebulous blob of family disappointment and failed spells.
“How did you know it was there?” Neville frowned; he had anticipated this part taking longer.
That’s what Harry had said of Sirius Black. She wondered if it was a good idea to enter a convicted murderers house without permission. Even if the conviction was more likely than not wrongful. She just sighed and followed Harry anyway. This was becoming a bad habit.
“Darker teaching.” Harry said with a wince.
“It’s like, a resistance group for the good side,” Harry explained, waving his hands in the air awkwardly, “They had it in the last war. All our parents were part of it,” He scrunched his nose up, “Well, apart from yours Draco.”
“We will be.” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
And then, after all that, Harry Potter finally sighed and said, “You see Professor. The truth is I’m obviously one of the greatest seers of all time."
and the Nicholas Flammel quote Draco Malfoy had just stuck up.
Ron gave her a sideways look of disbelief “What other reason would you be following him for? Are you, like, planning to steal his life force in a dark ritual?”
That kept so many warm –
Ron gingerly held the goblins long fingers up to the vault door. They each waited with baited breath, before sighing with relief when the vault door grew gold for a moment, and then disappeared. Just as it had for the Longbottom vault.
“Ginny’s been down here?” Neville asked with surprise, selecting a yellow blindfold and handing the bag back to Harry. Harry tossed it carelessly to the side of the room.
“Are you planning to rob Gringotts?” Neville asked, holding their plans. He hoped desperately that they would say no and explain the papers to him.
A snapshot from some story along the way; Two ginger boys, one green eyed and scarred and the other plain. They tell each other jokes. They say they could be twins. They bond over their mothers, both ginger matriarchs. Neither dies too early, neither sees too much pain. But this is the only true conversation they will have. They will not be best friends. They will live unadorned lives.
Harry stared at her, blinking exaggeratedly. “Ginny?” He said slowly “Are you….. alright?”
“She has to let you” Harry says furiously.
“Does it matter?” Neville asked with honest curiosity.
“It’s Pettigrew, isn’t it?” Hermione asked, but it didn’t sound like a question. She sounded resigned to the fact.
Only Sirius greets them all at the station. Even Draco, who had calmly pretended not to know them at all and walked over to kiss his terrifying mother on the cheek without so much as a goodbye (as he had done every year before), looked over at them in confusion.
Harry blinked “Ah."
To which Neville happily changed back to his own polite persona, thanking the goblin for his excellent service. Then he’d grabbed a random object from the piles of old things and hurried his way back up to the surface, meeting the trio in Fortescues.
“Harry, mate.” Ron pleaded, hugging his own chest. He was chill all over, though the day was pleasantly warm still.
If it had been any other occasion Ron would have been split between insisting that Hermione was not is other half or teasing Draco for referring to Harry as such. Currently however he was split between those two options and a third, far more pressing mode of operation: continuing his sulk.
etcetera”
“Sirius-” Lupin croaked.
“Oh shush, you misfit orphans.” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “I wanted to see Remus and Sirius tie the knot finally. They’ve only been talking about it for a millennium.”
Harry nodded in concession “Fine. But I cant tell you the truth”
The backyard of the grooms’ London townhouse had been magically enlarged and transformed by an ardent team of magical wedding planners. On the morning of the big day they could be found running around the place like headless chickens, casting rain repellent charms and creating makeshift golden awnings over everything they could.
Then she was landing hard on her knees in dew-wet grass and all thoughts of fallopian tubes were dashed from her mind. Ginny gagged once and could hear Hermione either doing the same or actually throwing up a few paces away.
“Especially Harry.” Harry said, groaning and putting his head in his hands.
“There needs to be a source of information for the student body that isn’t dragged down by decades of political baggage, that isn’t funded by politically invested parties lobbying for their own opinions and interests to be met” Harry’s voice grew gradually more passionate as his tirade went on “And as for you- you’ve got the connections. The Quibbler’s as politically neutral as it gets in Wizarding Britain. Well. As politically neutral on important topics as it gets. Honestly your dads getting more impassioned about Fudge being part Goblin by the edition”
A silence descended upon them. It wasn’t awkward- it was heavy.
Harry just shrugged, “Or I could be the greatest seer of all time.” Then he grinned, “Oh dear, if only we had someone who could tell us which one it was.”
“She is so cool.” Ginny breathed.
Harry stared at him, looking shocked. “I’m sorry,” He said again, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Harrumph” Ron said, through a spray of half chewed breakfast sausage.
Luna had heard Sirius and Professor Lupin use these names for each other. She wondered what Sirius was asking forgiveness for or even when he’d asked.
“Where is she going to go?” Neville cried.
“I knew I shouldn’t have told you my full name” Harry said rolling his eyes “You just use it to shame me”
“Two detentions for cheek!” Snape had seethed, turning on his heel and vanishing into his office.
“Keep looking,” Hermione said, and Neville nodded, turning back to his book of uncommon plants.
people she wanted to see her in her PJ’s. Especially not these PJ’s which she’d gotten at age 7 and only kept because they were worn out to perfection. She should have just made a dash for the stairs, but the door knob was already turning and she thought, oh no, not th
Draco blushed fiercely but stayed silent. Ginny watched Lucius’ eyes land on Hermione, and his lip curled. Then he snapped back to her father with predator like intensity.
“But we could use it just for when we’re in the vault,” Harry said, frowning.
“You’ve got it in one, Potter.” Draco said drily.
“Let’s take that as a failure,” George said, stifling a laugh. Fred came trudging up the stairs ten minutes later, looking appropriately beaten down.
Ron threw his head back and laughed. Hermione shrieked indignantly.
“I’m Hermione.” She said, “Um, perchance your name…. sire?” Oh, damn that for a game of soldiers, she thought. It only made her sound like a fool.
“Who cares” Harry snapped “The prophet is rubbish, anyway”
“Just not today,” Harry said, and Hermione nodded shakily.
“Or anything we do.” Sirius added.
On it had been drawn a diagram of a cart. Just like the goblin-driven carts you had to get into every time you went a Gringotts vault. In the corner Hermione had scribbled an appreciative
The moment dragged out.
“Why did you have to kick her out?” Neville asked softly, when Harry came back to him. The thought had also been bugging him.
“Yes, but she’s so classy.” Draco said happily, clapping primly.
Sirius. ”
“It’s
“Leave it to Remus Lupin to be sarcastic even when I’m proposing to you” Sirius joked and Lupin gasped out a choked laugh
Ron snorted again “Nah. Even Harry is mostly clueless.”
Sirius clapped him heartily on the shoulder. His hair was pulled back into a complicated plait, and he was wearing sparkly gold eyeliner. His waistcoat was crimson silk, his buttons gold. Neville found himself feeling flushed and squirmy when he took him in entirely, and he desperately ignored reasoning why.
Later that night Ron and Harry waited until the rest of the boys had headed to bed and no sound could be heard, before the snuck down to the common room.
“OWL year. Yay,” Hermione said, going for sullen but sounding a bit too genuinely excited to fool anyone.
“How old are you even?”  A dubious Ravenclaw demanded.
“You just did, didn’t you?” Snape mocked. “But fine. Ask your question, Potter. Please attempt not to sound as inane as you always do.”
Pandora Lovegood nee. Selwyn had been a different kind of mother than Molly Weasley. Born into a lesser branch of respectable pureblood family, albeit one that had a foothold in Ravenclaw instead of Slytherin. They weren’t dark-- they were smart and stuffy and proud. A family of inventors and high-class proprietors, researchers and experts. Pandora Lovegood fit into that perfectly- except that she didn’t.
“He probably has.” Draco said with disappointment. “There’s meant to be this big party over with the Romanians that all the bigwigs are going to. It’s probably more of a wake now, but dad’ll expect me there.”
She patted him on the shoulder “I’m pretty certain that both times I was just being dragged along out of obligation.”
“You can’t,” Neville whispered again, but his protest was weak and fell on deaf ears.
“Not with your knowledge you cheater.” Ron huffed. Then he frowned, “Wait a minute. The bet we made at the world cup—”
, Harry”
The bushy haired girl is back. Dark Skinned in this one and the boy is too. They are beautiful in this new defiance. A new kind of courage learned- one of defiance and difference. Learning to be outcasts, together.
i'm heading off to uni on friday so i'll keep up a steady pace of writing but it could be a slower update just a heads up.
“But can you prove he isn’t?” Luna pointed out.
Neither of them seemed to notice that she hadn’t actually agreed to the deal any more. Just because she wasn’t planning on bugging Harry about it didn’t mean she was going to let it go.
A muggle family murdered in their beds. Three high-up ministry officials stepping back from their jobs and pulling their kids out of school. A shop burnt down in the semi-wizarding town of Borth, Wales. The sparse image of an almost empty Diagon Alley splashed across the front page of the Prophet.
There were only five photos, two of them blurry from a shaky camera, but Neville cried over them anyway. His mums smiling face as she held a chubby baby. His dad’s proud grin and blazing eyes.
A short trip on the underground and a walk later (during which Hermione clutched her tote bag very tightly and kept close to an equally overwhelmed Ron) they found themselves standing in front of a crescent shaped cul-de-sac of posh three-story town houses. They were the types of houses that Russian oligarchs bought and never lived in but that no one else could ever actually afford.
“It wasn’t your—”
Ron was finishing off the last piece of shortbread (his fifth in the last hour) (“Hermione! Who knew muggles could cook so well
Harry sighed, tugging his hand through his hair. “Yeah I know but that’s not what I mean. He was… God. I attacked him in sixth year, you know. This horrible dark curse that Snape invented. I didn’t even know what it did. I didn’t care. I just cast it on him, and it was horrible. The blood…”
“Oh, woe is you.” Neville said drily, feeling embarrassed instantly. But Harry next to him burst into laughter.
He chuckled “Good thing for me your too nosy to ever do that”
“It’s life.” Harry said drily.
“Harry.” Ron said, shaking his best friend slightly. Harry pried himself away, eyes red and puffy, he turned to look.
