“Your hospital,” Dudley replies as he takes the whistling kettle off the hob. “Teddy might be with him. If you’d like to go up there to visit you’re welcome to.”
With a wicked grin, Potter husks, “I’ll die the happiest man on earth.”
“More than me?” Teddy narrows his eyes. Eyes that have taken on a greyer hue these days.
She snorts. “Either you’ve fucked him so you know his prick isn’t tiny, or you just don’t like me insulting your precious Potter. So which is it?”
“No, the shit hid his school bag," Harry replies with an annoyed huff, digging his wraps out of his gym bag.
Tonight is no different as he joins Pansy at the usual corner in the back. Men approach them and he waits until one sparks enough want in him that he accepts. Only, Draco’s finding it difficult to choose this evening. He’s even finding it difficult to focus on what Pansy is saying. His mind is too preoccupied with Potter and his adopted son, Teddy, to focus on the gossip about that horrid cow Millicent.
“No, sorry.” He rubs at the back of his thick neck with a large hand. “Guess I didn’t explain. I’m an...erm ...what’s the word? Meggle or however you say.”
you’re absolutely sure Malfoy isn’t being a wanker to Teddy.” He takes a breath, hardening his expression—looking like a fearsome ginger Viking due to the thick beard. “If he
No amount of cleansing will remove Potter from this space, but Draco is willing to let his mother try.
“I don’t trust you—I’ve got to train and I don’t need to come back up here to search all of Hogsmeade for you.”
“God, harder,” Draco demands in that voice that haunts Harry’s more pleasant dreams. “Don’t be gentle,” he pleads and it sounds like he’s craving punishment.
Dudley nods in satisfaction when Harry finishes his drills with the magicked mannequins—without destroying them beyond use. “Guess my suggestion worked, Potter.” Dudley chuckles when Harry jogs over to him to accept the bottle of water Dudley has for him. “Today you didn’t wreck my fucking gym.”
“Everything,” Draco confesses.
“Rape jokes are crass, darling,” she says as she blows a cloud of smoke in Draco’s face.
Long fingers trace over the evidence of what Potter has left within him. Draco watches—mesmerised—as the little blob moves in and out of focus. Already an energetic thing that captures his heart.
Surprisingly, Draco wears a gentle expression as he welcomes Teddy into the class. And Teddy has an embarrassed flush to his cheeks, but he doesn’t seem upset to be near Malfoy. Harry doesn’t have long to think about it because the door closes on him and from beyond the door he can hear Draco directing the class.
“What would you call it,” Draco replies—his voice just this side of waspish.
Out of his soul.
“How are you going to grow up to be buff like Potter if you don’t eat vegetables?” Draco’s words make Harry choke on the air but they both ignore his minor coughing fit.
His nails in the ground of Harry’s garden, with dirt packed beneath them, as he clawed and screamed while he told Harry to take what he needed.
He thinks about his mother withering away here and about how he’d had to send his father a letter about her when she reached the end of the line. He still wonders if his father wept, or if he’d done as Draco had—staring at a wall with overwhelming numbness.
“My mummy is very late,” she replies with a timid tone. Causing Draco to scan the area—noticing that indeed she is the last student with him. A frown of concern dips down the corners of his mouth, and he leads Audrey inside.
His eyes are desperate; searching for someone to fill the void Potter has left within him. A momentary escape from the reality of what this is.
“Yeah,” Teddy mumbles. “I think he’s too pretty to be your person, though. Shoulda been mine.”
“Let me know, I might be working. But if I’m not, I’m interested in going.” Harry’s still waiting on the final schedule for the preliminaries. Once those are done he will have a month, perhaps, before the tournament begins. Then it’s anyone’s guess when he’ll have time to play at proper parent.
“You are mine, Malfoy,” Potter is rough with him, biting at his wrist when Draco cups his cheek.
“Tell me what you want,” Potter commands as he moves closer. His strong hands gripping the back of Draco’s neck. Holding him with a firmness that makes Draco shudder with want.
Three years didn’t erase them, and he watches as three years walks out of his office door. Draco’s one salvation gone—the way Pansy always warned Potter would go.
Septimus bays in response, falling in step with Harry as he makes his way up to the top floor of the home. Bloody dog lies on the tile of the bathroom while Harry has a shower, and he’s too tired to try and force the dog out. So he leaves the door to the bathroom open and discards his clothes in a pile on the floor before he climbs beneath the hot spray coming from the showerhead.
“Of course Teddy hates him, he’s a fucking prat,” Ron says over lunch at the pub. “Do you remember how that shit was to Remus?” Ron takes a deep draw of his pint, leaving foam behind on his moustache—Harry grins at the image he creates.
“Depends,” Potter says, eyes gauging Draco for a reaction when he speaks. “I’m into either, so long as I’m with someone who is willing to have me fuck them thoroughly.” Draco’s hole throbs at the thought of Potter’s big cock ramming into him—reaching the deepest parts of him and before he can stop himself he whimpers out a desperate yes. “Yes?” Potter asks, a knowing grin as he asks another question for confirmation. “Yes, what, Malfoy?”
“Yeah,” Teddy agrees after a considering glance.
He bites his lower lip, afraid of speaking his desires, but Potter invades Draco.
Three years pretending he’s not coming apart at the seams. Unravelling like a frayed sock whose owner refuses to darn it—Harry’s collapsing in on himself. He wakes to Draco’s white back, and feels disgusted at his desires. The need to paint Draco’s skin crimson, as he had years ago in that lavatory.
He slouches in his seat, defeated by the truth he doesn’t want to acknowledge.
Out of his heart.
“Um, yeah, of course...” Harry replies awkwardly. He pats Teddy on the head—his hair a dark brown for once. “I’ll see you after school.”
It’s as humorous as it is heartbreaking.
Draco’s image filters through his mind, immediately after her question. Harry, Draco, a beach, and a baby.
In a flash of green flames they leave, and Draco is left wondering about who will yell at him when he’s old and not properly minding himself.
“Oh, shit, sorry,” the man says. “Forgot to introduce myself, I’m Dudley Dursley.”
“Teddy was absent from school, I was coming by to see if everything was all right,” Draco finally says, after gathering his bearings.
Malfoy was fractured like him, but still became a shining beacon of hope. A crutch—that’s how Hermione described the dependency.
“So, are you excited for Year Two,” Harry asks to try and shift their conversation into something that Teddy won’t mind Draco walking in on.
Teddy’s frown is so deep he creates wrinkles in his young forehead—reminding Harry strongly of Remus.
He thinks while his mother wraps him in her thin arms.
“It’s because he’s got a crush on you,” Potter confesses as he grips Draco’s hips. “Now, let's leave that conversation because I’ve got a bigger need for you than anyone else.” Something in Potter’s tone is possessive and Draco grins at his ridiculousness.
“I don’t want you to meet.” Teddy’s voice is shrill, and Harry sets Teddy down. To better see his small face.
Once Draco’s in his robe he goes downstairs—a small part of him hopes to find Potter in the kitchen. Making a fry-up or even a cup of tea.
Teddy’s young problem is that he’s overly attached to Harry. An only child with a single parent—it’s not a stretch to say he’s spoilt rotten and is the centre of Harry’s world.
He startles and shouts, “Malfoy!” Slipping against the tile in his shower and has to catch himself against the wall to avoid falling. “How the devil did you get here?”
Cold.
“Nothing too terrible,” Mrs Monroe assures when Draco asks after Audrey’s grandmother. “She’d let a cold get a little too bad—I think I’ve yelled at her enough for her to understand that she’s not as young as she once was.”
“Harry,” Teddy’s excited voice snaps him out of his remembered fantasy.
“What do you want?” Ms Linde, his headshrinker, asks when their session is spent in silence. Harry hasn’t said a word—his gaze lingering on the clock that ticks steadily on her office wall.
Dudley’s the one who suggests Harry go out for the evening. “Look, mate,” he said earlier in the afternoon. “I don’t usually suggest this sort of workout, but you need to get out there and get fucked.”
Potter lingers in this room. A ghost Draco can smell. The spectre who whispers against every over-sensitive nerve that Draco possesses. Potter is an inescapable phantom and this room houses all that remains of him.
There’s no wireless giving play-by-plays of any matches, and Harry hates the slow, boring jazzy sound that’s coming from the pianist. He removes his glasses, setting them against the bar before rubbing his fingers over his tired eyelids. When he picks up his glasses, intending to put them on and leave, a familiar voice sounds from a table nearby.
That causes Harry to frown. “Teddy. You can’t ask your teacher to take you to get ice cream.”
“So long as they don’t come up missing or dead, Potter, I don’t want to know what you mean by that.” Dudley—bastard that he is at times—is almost as loyal as Ron. Something that always manages to surprise Harry, even though Dudley’s been his trainer for years.
“How do you know Potter?” Draco asks—overstepping boundaries he normally wouldn’t.
Fetching Teddy from school is strange and thrilling. Draco stands, watching to make sure the smaller children go off with their guardians, and Harry doesn’t notice the fine suit he wears. He’s too busy recalling the way Draco had gone to his knees—looking up with those clear grey eyes as his pink lips stretched around the girth of Harry’s hard cock.
Potter’s hands move to Draco’s wand hand, touching one of the knuckles in his finger before running gently along the soft skin at the side. “I like elegant hands,” Potter murmurs. The same gaze tracking Draco’s face as Potter’s callous rough hands dance over Draco’s sensitive skin. Then his fingers move up the back of Draco’s hand, before Potter gently closes his hand around Draco’s wrist. “I love delicate features, and sharp features—something erotic lies in contrast.”
“I should’ve died in that forest. What will I give the world beyond Voldemort?”
“Okay,” Teddy concedes, releasing Harry with a put upon sigh. “I love Draco too, but I’ll love him like I love you.”
What does he want?
Potter holds his wrists with a bruising grip—keeping Draco from touching his own cock as Potter sets a sure, fast rhythm. In and out, his long, thick cock glides into Draco with a delightful stretch. One that might ruin him for other cocks if Potter keeps proving he’s the best at everything.
“Either way I’ll take Teddy,” Ron promises and with a last goodbye he finally Disapparates.
“Darling,” Pansy says with a gentleness she’s not normally known for. “You have to stop before you hurt yourself even more.”
“Always so clever,” he says—once Draco’s got control of his amusement.
“He’s already got a partner?” she finally says as she snuffs her cigarette out in a crystal ashtray.
Teddy doesn’t come to school for a few days so Draco makes a house visit—even though he’s been steadily trying to ignore Potter’s existence.
he wonders. The vain part of himself wanting to destroy everything of this Dudley, and he’s ashamed at his own ugliness.
Harry thinks as he watches Draco chew at his full bottom lip,
“You’re lucky they called me instead of hauling you in for assault.” Ron squats beside him, peering into his face with concern. “What happened, Harry?”
His mannerisms and way of speaking are nothing like the Year One teacher Harry had as a child. Ms Baxter had been all young, full of zeal and maternal warmth. She used one of those childish tones, gentle and sometimes too soft as if she was of the belief that children were glass. Draco is nothing of that. He talks to Teddy as if he’s intelligent enough to understand ideas most adults don’t believe children are capable of understanding.
readers up in a fuss by convincing them of Draco’s intentions to use Harry.
, Harry thinks, but says, “I mean...we went to school together. That doesn’t make us mates.”
No one ever told Draco that being left behind is a pain none can prepare for, final like death but where the other person still exists. A rejection, unlike any other, Draco is numb yet breaking in Potter's absence.
There’s no apology.  Nothing falls off of Potter’s tongue as he turns—walking out of Draco’s life the same way he walked in. Angry. Silent. Full of resentments Draco will never erase.
“Thank you,” Draco replies with a curious frown. “Where’s Potter?” He asks as he follows the man into Potter’s kitchen.
He grins. “She’s lucky to have a good daughter.”
Potter’s response is a low chuckle. One that’s just this side of dangerous, “Didn’t peg you for the sort who likes to fuck fat blokes.”
“I came to find someone to fuck,” Potter replies, after a sip of his scotch.
“Darling,” Pansy shrills at him. Calling Draco out of his rapid, anxious line of thoughts, into the present where Potter is sitting across from him in an outfit made for sinning. Dressy but casual. Potter is in all black—his button-up shirt open at the collar and his sleeves rolled up his strong forearms, exposing those delicious ropey veins lying beneath his golden skin. Veins Draco wants to map with the point of his tongue. “You’re drooling.” Pansy’s voice is a soft puff of a damp whisper, tickling his ear. He swallows with shame when he notices Potter watching him.
Drawing in a shaky breath of cold winter air, Harry realises he’s near crying and he grits his jaw—willing the emotions down, away where they cannot hurt him.
“Shut up." Potter laughs. “Ride me and I’ll be all right.”
“Not happening,” Harry replies, pulling out the cushions of the sofa to see if Teddy’s hidden his school bag under them.
“Look, I’ll talk to him. He’ll tell me eventually and when he does we can sort it then.” Potter is oddly pragmatic about the whole situation—something, Draco had not expected when he brought Teddy home.
“Go on, kiss Rosie on Hermione’s belly for me and give Hermione my love.”
Hell would have to freeze first.
Huffing, Harry drops one of the thick cushions onto the wooden floor of his flat before he whips out his wand. It’s a simple enough flick of his wrist that brings Teddy’s school bag sailing down from the upper floor.
Draco clears his throat. Trying to regain a sense of calm. “No. It’s where I ask you why Teddy’s not fond of coming to school? I assume you aren’t the reason he’s late every day.”
, he thinks as he bends down to allow Teddy to jump into his hug.
“Chill,” Astoria said as she sat beside him.
When Harry was certain his Soulmate was safe again, he would focus all his energy on sending her happy thoughts in a desperate attempt to make her feel better. He never knew for sure if it was working, but when he looked back at his tattoo, she seemed to have calmed down.
“Your question.”

“It would certainly appear that way,” Harry commented. “I should have known immediately that something was wrong with her, but unfortunately I’d been drinking.”

“I suggest you keep pushing your original cause,” Draco replied, his voice growing fainter. “Even if you can’t win, it’s good to bring attention to the issue.”
“Yes.”
“You’re blind.”

“Wait!” Harry shouted, starting to grab Draco’s wrist as he got out, but stopping last second. “Please, don’t do this.”
Harry stared as the blond man came into view. His hair was pulled back like it had been at the train station and on the news. Now Harry could see that the ponytail fell down to the middle of Draco’s back, longer than he’d seen Lucius wear his.
He managed to find a pen and stole printer paper from the printer that hadn’t worked in nearly two months. Slowly, he scribbled out a barely legible response and handed it to the owl who grabbed it as if it were an undesirable piece of garbage and flew back outside.

He was torn away from his thoughts at the sound of two familiar voices coming down the hallway. He would normally be happy to hear the one, but it was strange accompanied by the other.

For once, he didn’t listen to her. Instead, he turned his head to look at Harry who sat beside him, that same crease of worry still embedded in his brow.

“Thanks again,” Teddy said once they’d started back towards Harry’s apartment.
Thanks for reading! Bonus chapter because I forgot to upload yesterday. All comments are welcome.
As soon as Harry pulled up the driveway, Draco wordlessly got out of the car and walked into his home. A few minutes after the door shut behind him, it began to rain. A few raindrops hit Harry’s windshield followed by more and more until he was surrounded by a steady downpour.
“Do you have any idea how lucky you are?!” she hissed.
Harry smirked.
Determined to think about something else, Harry grabbed the stack of papers the quill had finished with and began filling out the details that the quill didn’t know the answers to.
“I don’t want to live in your mansion,” he said. “You could put up all the paintings in the world, I really don’t want to live there.”
“I’m sure they mind a little,” Harry admitted. “But like I said, they’re gaining important life skills.”
“Fuck,” Harry muttered, finishing off the contents of the second glass in one last swallow and pouring a third. “Fuck.”
“Oh,” he said absentmindedly. “Nothing, I just had a lot to drink.”
Harry smirked.
“Technically no,” Klerig admitted, standing back up and crossing her arms over her chest. “But they were content terrorizing muggle-born children. Now they’re coming after you.”
Draco’s hands slipped under Harry’s shirt to touch his bare waist. Harry moaned slightly at the touch and his hands clenched into fists at his sides.

Harry obeyed, closing his eyes and trying to stay motionless. He felt Draco move closer and resisted the urge to reach forward and pull him in. Draco’s hand dropped Harry’s and he moved both up to cup Harry’s face.

Harry sighed and gave up on the scan, putting his wand back in his pocket. Nothing had changed out here. The Malfoy’s protections were still very advanced.
Harry stared, barely listening to the reporter’s question or Draco’s response.
“I am too,” Harry said, squeezing his hand lightly. “I guess if we’re going to be together again, we should get to know each other.”
“Not really. I was very concerned for Albus when he was sorted into Slytherin, but Lily couldn’t have been anything but Ravenclaw and James was a Gryffindor from the moment he was born. We did honestly expect Albus to be Gryffindor too, he’s never seemed very ambitious. Part of me wonders if he asked to be sorted into Slytherin.”
“You’re not surprised?” Draco repeated, eyes wide.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
When Harry arrived, Teddy was waiting in the driveway with his bags. They hugged and loaded up his stuff silently before driving off.
“What do you suggest?” he asked.
Eventually, the workday ended and Harry packed up his stuff, giving a quick glance at his phone. Still nothing. Harry began to wonder if Draco didn’t actually want to talk to him after all.
He shrugged.
As Draco got older, he learned to take comfort in watching the words shifting on his arm. He saw that his Counterpart wished to escape her family as much as he did. Thoughts about her “terrible Uncle Vernon” or “god-awful Aunt Petunia” popped up on a daily basis by the time Draco turned seven. Of course, from the very beginning, his Counterpart was constantly complaining about some kid named Dudley that Draco originally assumed must be her brother, but later understood to be her cousin.
“You sure about this?” Teddy asked as he timidly took the glass of very expensive Dragon Barrel Brandy Dop was handing him. “Thanks.”

“Yes,” Harry replied.
“Ok,” Harry said, staring intently at the readings coming from his wand for a moment. “Why did you and Astoria only have one kid?”
The ministry had granted Harry a day off to recover from the events of the night before and was investigating the vampire. It seemed highly suspicious that she would intentionally attack someone she knew was a wizard and most likely knew was an auror. The ministry suspected it was a planned attack.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
Draco and Harry faced each other, hand in hand, staring deeply into each other’s eyes as Hagrid took his place under the arch facing the audience.
“Would you have been upset if Scorpius wasn’t sorted into Slytherin?” Harry asked.
Harry nodded and smiled slightly.
Suddenly, Draco glanced over at the glass that was separating them. It should appear to him as impossible to see through, but Harry could swear that for a moment they locked eyes. Seeing Draco’s silvery eyes staring back at him reawakened butterflies in Harry's stomach that he thought had died off years ago.
Harry almost confessed who his Soulmate was to Hermione and Ron on multiple occasions, but always stopped himself. They’d spoken about Soulmates on a few occasions, but for the most part, Hermione and Ron seemed just as content to avoid the topic as Harry was.
“You have to promise not to tell your cousins about this,” he said.
“Me moving into the mansion,” Harry clarified. “Is that really what you were expecting to happen?”
“She was a hufflepuff,” replied Astoria, her eyes growing hazy with memory.
Strictly speaking, aurors weren’t supposed to use enchanted quills to fill out paperwork as it increased the odds of something being filled out inaccurately. However, only brand new aurors were stupid enough to follow that rule and Harry had been working with the ministry for nearly 20 years.
He stared at the words he’d typed for a moment before adding.

“It’s so dreary.”
“Logically,” Draco replied, shrugging. “We care about each other deeply. She doesn’t want me to get hurt or to suffer from having you around.”
“Damn,” he muttered to himself or perhaps to the owl who still sat somewhat impatiently. “They should sell this shit.” Harry turned to the owl. “Wait here. Drace awaits my response.”
“Vaguely,” Harry replied. “Is that your question?”
“Think my name is funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair and a hand-me-down robe... you must be a Weasley.” Draco turned his attention back to Harry, pleased to find that he stood a few inches taller than the famous boy. “You’ll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort.” He stopped for a moment to shoot a glare at Ron and Hermione. “I can help you there.” He offered his hand, internally pleading with Harry to take it.
“When I lost Alea, I would have done anything to get her back,” she said quietly after a few minutes. “I fucking tried, too. I started studying necromancy. I joined a bullshit satanic cult that claimed to be able to raise the dead. The only reason I joined that damn plant studying group was because I heard there was an herb that let you
“I forgot about that,” Draco admitted, an old familiar anger sparking within him.
Thanks to Apalia for their suggestion of adding a depression and drug use/abuse tag to the fic. If anyone else has suggestions for tags I should add, please let me know. Also if anyone thinks I should add a warning and/or tag for non-con please leave a comment.
Draco pulled back to look at Harry’s face again. Harry opened his eyes and looked back at Draco, his cheeks rosy.
Draco and Teddy followed suit with Teddy glancing around to make sure he was doing it right.
“I promise you, Harry Malfoy-Potter, my whole heart.”
Harry put his phone aside and finished his dry cereal. It wasn’t too terribly unpleasant, but he did wish he had milk. The coffee pot beeped that it was done and he poured it into a transportable mug.
“Shall we make a toast?” Harry asked, raising his glass.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good afternoon,” she began. “Tonight brings the news of the death of one of Voldemort's reformed followers. Known for his family’s acts of betrayal against Voldemort during the final Battle of Hogwarts, Lucius Malfoy was announced dead at 64 years old last night. No news yet as to why he passed so young, but rumors of a curse have been spreading quickly. While some still frown upon the Malfoy family for their traditional hatred of half-bloods and muggle-borns, many attribute their actions during the war to victory. While Lucious was not a primary participant in any of his family’s brave lies, he publicly renounced Voldemort after the war and seemed to turn his life to good.”
Harry looked at her.
I honestly have no interest in having dinner with you. You’re a selfish bastard who never even bothered to write to me and explain why we couldn’t talk anymore. I had to hear that shit from your mother. Please never write to me again.
“Sorry I brought it up,” Draco said, sipping on his drink. “I forget that not everyone knew the Harry I did.”
“He’ll be 16 soon,” Teddy pointed out, placing one of the trunks on Albus’s bed. “Maybe he’ll grow out of it.”
“That’s ok, James is old enough to watch his siblings now,” Harry joked, though he knew it was in bad taste.
“I’m surprised Astoria was able to have a baby at all,” Hary commented. “She’s so thin.”
Draco shrugged and smiled.
“Were you with any other men after me?” Draco asked.
His head throbbed, but considerably less than the day before. Harry guessed that the doctor had cured some of the effects of his drinking while he healed his neck. One hand wandered absentmindedly to the place where the vampire had once torn him open. His skin felt perfectly smooth and natural. There was still a chance, however, that there would be a scar.

“Never underestimate my wife,” Draco told him with a smile.
“I want to,” Draco replied, letting their hands drop back to their sides. “I’m serious about trying again with you.”
As much as Harry valued his alone time, he was grateful that he would have someone to at least somewhat keep him sane with all that was happening. As soon as the apartment was clean and all bloodstains from last night’s mishap were removed, he got dressed and texted Teddy that he would be there in ten minutes.
“It ultimately boiled down to us not being compatible long term,” Harry explained. “We just had different ideas on what it takes to raise a family; what was worth sacrificing and what wasn’t. I mentioned earlier how we had different ideas on how much privacy our children should have. I also firmly believed that at least one of us should be a stay at home parent. It ended up being her because none of the things she was interested in doing for work would generate enough money for me to be able to quit. In hindsight, it wasn’t fair of me to make her give up her passions. I just couldn’t understand how she would want anything other than to stay home with the kids.”
Draco shrugged and sighed.

“At times,” Draco admitted. “But that’s to be expected.”
Of course, it seemed like the only things that were playing were romances or horrible news. Harry stopped as he landed on one of the wizard only news channels.
Draco figured it out quickly after that. The thoughts on his arm often complained about being the boy who lived and getting so much attention. What did I do to deserve this? Maybe they have the wrong person. I’m nothing. He tried hard to keep his thoughts kind, almost hoping Harry would never figure out it was him.
“Tell Draco I’m divorced,” Harry said to him, his words beginning to slur as he finished off the glass and got up to pour another. The ring that still sat on Harry’s right ring finger began to feel tight as his hands started to swell slightly from the alcohol.
“I can understand why they would want you to leave her,” Harry admitted. “I know you say there’s nothing romantic, but it’s clear you love each other. It would make me uncomfortable if we weren’t Soulmates.”
“What are you talking about, Astoria?” Harry asked, groaning and laying back down to stare at the ceiling of his car.

Suddenly, a familiar, prideful looking eagle owl landed in front of him with a letter in his claw. The owl was undoubtedly Dracos, though significantly older than when Harry last saw him.
“This is probably as good of an opportunity as ever to discuss strategy,” said Harry. “Astoria, is there any magical field, in particular, you excel at?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You sure about that?” Harry asked, crossing his arms over his chest. “You seemed to just imply that I am not properly providing for my children. I’m fairly certain that counts as judging my parenting skills.”
“Good riddance,” he announced, plopping down on his living room couch and using his wand to flip through the TV channels.
“It came as a shock,” she replied. “But we will mourn and life will go on.”
“I am not an alcoholic,” Harry replied rolling his eyes.

“Should we split up when we get there?” Ron asked. “It may be better to have multiple points of attack.”
“It’s not like you haven’t already set a precedent,” she reminded him.
“I promise to put us before everything else.”

“-is just not enough for a hippogryph,” Hermione was saying. “But of course everyone cares more about the status of the wizards than the quality of life of the magical creature.”
“Hogwarts gave you cocaine?!” Teddy asked, looking at Harry with wide eyes.

Draco eyed Harry suspiciously then sighed.
Harry felt his cheeks turn hot as he grasped Draco’s hand in his.

“It’s true then? What they’re saying on the train,” Draco said intentionally louder than necessary. Harry’s head snapped in his direction. “Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts,” Draco smirked and nodded to his friends as he introduced them. “This is Crabbe and Goyle, and I,” he stood up a bit taller and let his smirk turn into a proud grin like the one his father often wore, “am Draco Malfoy.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed.
“Yes,” Draco replied without hesitation, a light pink blush forming on his cheeks. “Do you still love me?”
“No such curse,” Draco replied. The face that Harry had just been admiring for seeming kind twisted back into the stony glare Harry had been more familiar with as a child.
Harry froze, blinking at Draco in shock.
I await your response,
. The warm tones of Draco chuckling filled Harry’s brain.
PS: I was happy to see you still wear that ring. I still have mine too.
“I suspect it will only get worse for a while,” he admitted.  “Unpack. Their closet should expand for your clothes to fit automatically. When you’re done, we can go get some lunch.”
“Any time,” Harry replied.
“Harry?” Astoria said in Harry’s ear, but he couldn’t respond.
“I assure you, Harry, I would be just as fucked up by my parents if I’d been raised in a hut rather than the manor. The home has very little to do with anything beyond comfort.”
The guests stood, looking back expectantly as Harry and Molly Weasley began walking down the aisle arm in arm. Harry stared straight ahead, focusing intently on the wedding arch and lake before him. Molly whispered comforting words in his ear as they walked, but they seemed to do little to calm him.
Draco doesn’t go home immediately after Potter’s. Pansy invited him out earlier in the week, and he needs a drink to soothe his bruised ego.
“What winter carnival?”
Grinning Harry says, “Why don’t you tell him that when he comes home, yeah?”
Draco thinks of all that he wants with Potter. Early morning kisses, breakfast with Teddy, evenings reading about Quidditch. There’s so much he wants. So much he doesn’t deserve.
Draco chuckles against the cool lip of his glass and takes a purposefully long sip. He’s going to make her fester while she waits for his answer.
Teddy skulks around the new flat, frowning at all of the furniture Draco carefully selected for their new home. Harry gave in to every request. Easy to do when Draco would plead so prettily. Now, he’s concerned he’s somehow cocked it all up.
“Just eat it, mate,” Potter tells him, biting into his own pizza with big pretty teeth. Draco fights rather hard to keep from imagining them pressing into his skin. He stares longer than socially acceptable and Potter shoots him a taunting grin. “Didn’t peg you as the domestic type, Malfoy. I was convinced you’d blow up my kitchen in an attempt to cook.”
“Why?” Harry frowns, concerned for the way Teddy is behaving.
“Yeah he’s a right cunt, that one,” Potter chuckles—sounding fond about this man. But Draco doesn’t have long to worry over that. Not when Potter snuffs out his cigarette and moves his strong body with the grace of a wild cat—covering Draco with his form while wearing the sort of grin that promises devious delights.
“I don’t love him,” Draco protests. Yet it’s weak.
“The fuck he is,” Harry shouts, throat raw still from disuse these past few days. “That beefy idiot is my cousin and my trainer.” Then, after calming himself, he adds, “Have you looked at the guy? Sure, I bet he’s attractive to some, but he’s not my type.”
“Mate,” he says, crouching to Teddy’s level. “Do you want to go back home?” The old flat isn’t sold yet, there is still time.
Needy and eager as Harry fingers him—teasing Malfoy, trying to make him beg, but he doesn’t. Draco accepts everything Harry does to him.
Theo gives Draco appreciative glances, and in a different life the thought of his hands on Draco’s body might not have filled him with revulsion. Hands other than Potter’s make his skin crawl. As if a demon already possesses Draco—one he will never exorcize from his being.
Draco watches—face impassive—as Potter sets the brass key on Draco’s desk. A key that was more symbol than useful, one that served as a promise.
As if he can waltz into Draco’s life whenever he feels the desire.
“Blonds?” Pansy positively purrs. Beneath the table, she jabs Draco’s calf with the sharp point of her heel. “I’m sure we know a blond or two don’t we, Draco? Anything else that catches your fancy, Potter?”
—a pleasure that borders on painful.
Once he’s gone from sight, Potter flicks his wrist—casting a silencing charm around them. The feel of his magic is electric as it caresses Draco’s exposed skin. “So, Malfoy, is this where you tell me I’m a shit dad?”
“My professor is the worst,” Teddy complains, drawing Harry’s attention to where he’s still slung over Harry’s shoulder.
“God, don’t get him on that. He’ll be convinced he can quit school.” A nightmare Harry would like to avoid, lest Andromeda rises from the grave to murder him.
One Harry could get addicted to, he discovers when Draco arches towards the deep, branding bites Harry puts into his easily bruised skin. “More,” Draco husks, as Harry sucks a dark lovebite into the skin at the bend between Draco’s leg and groin.
It was nothing like that...if anything, Harry used Draco. As he fell apart Draco would hold him—he’d open his arms and accept all the darkness Harry had to give.
“It’s all right, Pansy. I’ve never entertained the idea of that anyways.”
“Hiding in his nook again?” Dudley asks, his knuckles already wrapped for a spar.
Even still, Draco releases a dry sob. Apologising to a being he doesn’t yet know. For sins he’s not yet committed, and for the sins he cannot take back.
Grey eyes lift and their gazes lock, neither says anything but Harry knows this is the beginning. He’s already rooted in Draco, and the devil knows Draco is in him.
Potter’s smile turns teasing—a playfulness in the expression that Draco’s learning to appreciate. “No one is more annoying than you, Malfoy,” but he punctuates his words by capturing Draco’s mouth with a kiss. Making Draco wonder if he’s meant his words as a compliment.
The evening had been fine. Fun even. Until some snot thought they could impress him by talking about Draco. Whispering vile lies about Draco being a whore—putting himself arse up for freedom. Harry remembers the months of horrible speculation at the beginning of their relationship. When that bitch Rita had all the
Now, as the children come rushing out of the doors—with teachers calling out for them to be careful and not run—he spies Teddy. At that moment his heart is full. Teddy’s wide smile is one full of joy and one that knows no suffering. So, despite tragedy, he is well adjusted and that makes Harry feel so incredibly happy.
As he stands a tight grip wraps around his slim wrist.
“Yeah, can’t magic at all. So, guess someone who can will have to be responsible for Teddy.”
“I’m not into anything that kinky, mate, but I appreciate the unspoken offer of an alibi,” Harry says as he shakes his head fondly.
Draco wakes when sunlight shines over his closed eyelids. His body aches—remnants of a night spent at the mercy of Potter’s lust.
Draco falls to the floor with a sob escaping his mouth. His eyes too broken to cry tears—they ran dry in war. Despite his lack of tears, Draco knows he’s crying. Sobbing as he never has before, and if the tears were to run again he wonders if that would wash Potter out of his skin.
Draco blanches.
“Anything else?” Pansy prods with the kind of tone that drips with obnoxiousness.
Big eyes widen, and there’s something fearful on Teddy’s face when he says, “Without Draco?”
“That’s not at all healthy,” Draco replies. “Perhaps if you eat this without complaint I will make you a proper pizza.” He manages to say this without sounding condescending.
So, here he is, in someplace Seamus suggested when he’d rang him up after his workout.
and Harry’s cock twitches at the sound.
“Nonsense, darling.” Mother says with a whisper for him while wearing her brightest hostess’s smile. Draco is swollen with the child he never asked for. The one who fills him still with Potter—a curse he will love and hold close while still wishing to escape. His grey gaze flits about the garden, searching for the devil who has yet to discover his crime. The one who rules the hell Draco gladly would fall within—just for another kiss. Another touch. Another affectionate lie.
“Yes, I want you to fuck me.” Draco pants out the words—hard and so ready. “God, yes, I want you to fuck me so hard I feel you for weeks.”
She doesn’t flinch the way others still do, and that’s the only trait that has kept Harry from leaving her too. Her obvious strength and her unwillingness to be cowed by his uncooperative nature. “What can you give yourself, Harry? It’s not about the world anymore?” She leans forward, after setting her pad aside. “What do you want?”
“You’ll be mad, like Uncle Ron was,” Teddy shouts, and his voice bounces through the corridor due to the emptiness around them.
to his family despite her outstanding abilities. Beautiful Dora who Draco never had the pleasure to meet. The only time he’d laid eyes upon her face had been when she was a lifeless corpse in the Great Hall.
Only as he approaches the sitting room, Harry hears a low groan that causes him to frown. An expression that deepens when a sharp gasp follows.
“If you keep stalling we will now come on. I need in you.” Potter sounds desperate for him, and it’s flattering. Especially after all of the doubt he’s been stewing in these last few weeks.
Ron finds him collapsed in an alley behind some new pub on Diagon.
Leaving physically is easy. Mentally is another story.
He leans his head against the glass of the shower, thinking he wants someone to look at him with desire.
Three years. That’s all Harry can manage with his fake bravado.
“Why not,” she asks Draco after lighting a cigarette. Her red nails long and sharp—Harry’s half afraid she’s going to scratch Draco’s eyes out with those nails when she narrows her eyes at Malfoy. “You were saying you like them tall, broad, and dangerous. I found you someone who fits that description.”
Grinning, Harry whispers, “Come have it all, Draco. It was yours the moment you sucked me off with that perfect mouth. God, you could tempt Christ with those skills.”
“Potter,” he begins, but Pansy cuts him off with a loud huff.
“Potter,” Draco gasps. His hands moving to Harry’s unruly hair when Harry’s mouth swallows down Draco’s cock. “Fucking hell,” Draco keens, rocking his hips while Harry’s mouth creates filthy noises. Noises that every porn doesn’t quite manage to recreate—there’s something authentic in this messy filth.
“Because he’s not a friend, he’s a teacher. If he does it for you he has to do it for all the kids.” A reasonable enough explanation.
“Again,” Draco begs. Tightening his legs around Potter’s waist as he digs his short nails into Potter’s biceps—clinging in every way he can.
He’s delicious.
“Once upon a time I thought I wanted a family.” Something he hasn’t thought about in ten years.
They are outside of one of four Year One classrooms. And the door opens before Harry can demand more information. There, in the doorway, stands a tall, willowy man with pale hair and sharp grey eyes. A usually plush peachy mouth is pinched tight in annoyance. “Mr Lupin,” a gentle, yet deep posh voice. “Class started twenty minutes ago, please come sit down and ask your tablemate to explain to you what we were discussing. If you don’t understand, I will help you after class ends and escort you home.”
“Okay,” Teddy shrugs, but Harry can see the relief in him. The way his eyes and hair shift to their usual colours.
Intrigue begins to develop in Harry, growing as he watches Teddy and Draco stand at his kitchen counter to make pizza.
“I wanted a frozen pizza,” Teddy grumbles but still picks up his fork to spear a slice of banana.
“I’ll never love anyone the way I love you, you’re my son,” Harry tells him earnestly. When Teddy squeezes his arms around Harry’s neck Harry adds. “And I’ll never love anyone the way I love Draco. He’s my person.” As he pats Teddy’s back Harry asks, “Do you understand what I mean?”
Though no one sparks his interest. So he turns, dejected, back towards the bartender—deciding to not look while he waits for his drink.
His mouth waters at the memory.
Doesn’t work, he’s decided because the visions still boil within—as if they are embedded with roots his headshrinker cannot yank out.
“He deserves more than I can give.”
“Hospital. Had a nasty accident during a fight in Berlin.” The man starts the fire on the hob with some kind of wand that has a trigger on it. “Didn’t realise they couldn’t just magic him back quickly.” He turns to face Draco. “Ron and Hermione have been a great help, and I’ve imposed enough as is on them. But I s’pose I’ll have to impose more and ask them to get Teddy to school.”
Harry snorts while Teddy watches Draco with a confused look. One that drags long enough to be uncomfortable, so Draco says, “Right then, dinner? Then your Potter and I need to have a bit of a chat.”
“Audrey. Yes, what can I do for you?” His heart beats so fast beneath his chest. Draco’s certain he must be blushing, for his cheeks feel hot. As does the back of his neck and the tips of his small ears.
Making as casual a shrug as he can manage, Draco says, “Neither. I happened to walk in on him when he was having a shower.”
“Tell her that, will you?” Then Audrey waves, thanking Draco from where she’s lying against her mother’s jumper covered shoulder.
“Mother, please,” he murmurs. Low enough that only she will hear. “I want to hide indoors.”
Dinner ends without incident, then Potter directs Teddy to head upstairs for a bath. The child goes with a pout—no doubt upset that he’s not being included in their discussion.
“Traitor,” Teddy mutters, mutinously.
Draco is rarely surprised these days, but he’s surprised when Potter walks over to his and Pansy’s table some ten minutes after Pansy tells Draco she’s sorry she can’t get Potter to fuck him. If Pansy had that sort of power she’d be in business for life and wouldn’t have to rely on the old, perverted fucks who fund her sugar-baby lifestyle. Though, to be fair, Pansy enjoys her lifestyle as a kept mistress for many men. Draco’s offered to hire her with some useless title for his estate and she’s turned him down.
As night travels past dusk and moves into to dawn, Pansy finally snaps. “What’s with you tonight? That bloke you’ve been eyeing for weeks came over to grin at you with his stupid smile and you’re too spaced out to show any interest.”
Potter’s grin is feral.
Somehow, Draco manages a weak laugh.
Draco’s pale eyebrows furrow as he says, “Dudley. He’s your partner, Potter.”
Now, as he listens to Draco confess strange beliefs Harry realises they are both idiots and words could’ve saved them from this ridiculousness.
“Yes, Mr Potter, it is I.” There’s more sarcasm when he talks to Harry. But it lacks the complete hostility of their youth. “Now, if you don’t mind, you are interrupting my class.”
An illusion of magic that brings Potter back into this space—as if for a moment he never left.
is what Potter loves?
Teddy doesn’t give him the chance. He sighs as if he’s a disappointed adult and Harry’s the brat who was doing something he shouldn’t have. “I asked if you are taking me to the winter carnival?”
Still, Draco wants to try.
“Thought you were training,” Draco says as he approaches. Trying to be unaffected.
“I’m going to fuck you to orgasm, darling,” he tells Draco with a lusting growl.
Draco smiles, thinking of his own mother. Wishing she were still around for him to reprimand. Broken hearts are just as deadly as untreated colds—perhaps worse.
Narcissa’s party is a bore as usual, but Harry moves through the gathered guests with intention. He could give a shit about charity. He’s been charitable enough for one lifetime. Harry’s goal is to find Draco.
Teddy darts a glance between them, eyes shifting to a violent pink—a sure sign of worry—so Harry draws him into a gentle hold. “Nothing bad, Mr Malfoy is probably very worried over the fact you keep coming to school late.”
It’s not a long walk from The Three Broomsticks to Morgana’s, but Harry takes his time with it. Wanting to keep from standing uselessly around while waiting for the final bell. Too many times already women have tried chatting him up, and a few blokes or they’ll try to profess their undying gratitude. Which can be overwhelming and anxiety-inducing. A lot of the time, those interactions cause him to be wracked with survivor's guilt. Something he experiences daily when he sees Teddy’s face—Lupin’s kind eyes and Tonk’s smile. They torment him in quiet moments—moments he hides from Teddy as best as he can, but they are still there. Suffocating and heavy.
Hastily she cautions Harry when she sees him staring off into the distance—as if she can tell where his mind wanders. Where it lingers on the dips in Draco’s sharp hips. A place he loved to leave the brand of his teeth.
“It’s fair when we’re running late." Harry laughs. Easily lifting Teddy over his broad shoulder. The little bugger kicks his long legs against Harry’s solid chest and stomach, but it is harmless compared to the blows Harry takes at work. More like a kitten trying to provoke him when he’s used to wrestling tigers. “Stop fighting, you’re going to school.”
Teddy, despite his claims that his teacher the worst, seems to enjoy Draco a great deal. He’s all too eager to show Draco his set of colour quills and the weird scribble he claims is a dragon that he’s invented into existence.
“I don’t want to go to school,” Teddy complains for the hundredth time that morning. “School is boring, I want to go with you.”
Draco thinks even as he thanks Dudley for his time.
“You’re better off without him,” Hermione tells him during their most recent interaction.
“Fuck you, Potter,” Draco hisses. Then gasps when Potter thrusts harder—
“You’ll never be rid of him now, darling,” she murmurs. Setting her mimosa glass on the crisp white linen table cloth, Draco follows the movement but his mind is elsewhere. It’s with Potter, as always, remembering the way his mouth mapped Draco like a country he needed to learn. Possessing and claiming lands before others could—Potter’s tongue a siege that Draco surrendered to. So fully that now his infiltration remains within Draco’s body long after Potter leaves.
“Not there,” Teddy taunts. A terror if ever there was one, and Harry’s not the best at punishments so the child grows worse as the days go by. A mini-marauder, for certain. “You’ll never find it.”
Something in Draco’s heart stutters—painfully—but he pushes the feeling of unease away. Content to be in this moment as much as possible.
St Mungo’s is as dreary as it’s ever been when Draco walks through its silent halls, towards Potter’s private room.
“Will do, mate. And I’ll let you know when the next Cannons match is. We can take Teddy.”
“Teddy thought you were sleeping and sent me up,” Draco replies with a bit of the old venom Harry remembers from school. The embarrassed flush in his cheeks is new, however. “I didn’t realise you’d be naked.”
He doesn’t even try to keep Teddy home when Ron says there’s a dinner at The Burrow that evening. Harry waves them off glad of the excuse to race to Malfoy’s posh flat.
It’s strange to think Draco holds this ability to calm a child. Harry remembers when he was still a snivelling child himself.
Something he kicks himself for when one of his students pulls on the hem of his sleeve. “Mr Malfoy,” she says. Draco nearly startles out of his skin.
Pale lips tremble and Harry wants to kiss away the fears on that beautiful mouth when Draco whispers, “I can’t love you if you won’t give me everything, it hurts too much, Harry.”
“And you didn’t jump in with him?” She is delightfully scandalised.
With a judgemental expression, Pansy informs Draco that he’s the only one who has ever found Potter to be perfect. “You’re absolutely mad, darling. A complete fool. Hopelessly in love with a buffoon.”
“What makes school so awful?” Harry asks, after they’ve Apparated to the small village of Hogsmeade. Where one of the two primary schools are located—Harry had detested the idea of being in London more than necessary. He likes to live with as few interruptions as possible, and Diagon is still the one place he’s constantly badgered. So Hogsmeade was the safer of the two schools.
Potter who is suspiciously absent when he rolls over in his large bed. Finding it cold to the touch, and something in him mourns the loss of Potter’s heat.
It’s a posh bar with one of those black tie-wearing piano players, dark red velvet walls and ambient lighting. The drinks are all top shelf, and Harry bemoans the lack of his preferred Hobgoblin. At the bar he orders a neat scotch. As he waits, Harry glances around at the other patrons. They all look like a bunch of wankers, but he’s not here to find true love. Harry’s here to fuck someone and get on with his life.
“Promises, promises.” Draco tries to play coy. The effect is ruined by his breathy tone and the high flush in his skin. He’s too eager to pretend to be glib.
He’s got the sort of body that makes people in anonymous Muggle spaces shoot him appreciative glances, ones that show their interest and willingness. Yet, it’s been a long time since Harry’s had the time for a tumble in bed with a stranger. Longer still since he’s had a romantic partner to share his life with. Ginny was great, but they both felt there was something lacking in their sexual compatibility. She wanted one thing and Harry another, so they parted amicably for a second time. Then Teddy came along and Harry’s not willing to have people in and out of Teddy’s life while Harry’s trying to figure out what he wants. Hence his lacking in the romance department.
“Well?” she demands, voice going shrill again after he sets down his drink.
Dudley is saying more, but Draco blurts, “How long have you been partners?” He flushes at his own forwardness, but this man doesn’t seem to notice.
His mind goes blank at the appearance of this Muggle.
So far he’s never taken the top title, but he’s been in second place for the past three. He’s determined this will be his year.
“Draco,” Pansy says with a kinder voice, “if I could convince Potter to fuck you I would.” Which is not something Harry expected to hear in a posh bar while shoddy jazz plays softly in the background.
As if reading his mind Dudley says, “C’mon, Harry. Let’s go a few rounds and work off the worry.”
He thinks, terrified of his own mind. Of his own impulses. Of all the violence that lives in his fingers with the itch to be released.
Ron snorts. “Doubtful. Snakes might shed their skin, but they never change their colours.” When Harry doesn’t readily respond Ron sighs. “I don’t know what you want me to say, mate. I hate Malfoy, and there’s not much that will change that. But,” he adds with a thoughtful look, “I am willing to be civil and open to locating the real source of Teddy’s anxiety about school.
“I am so sorry, again, Mr Malfoy,” Mrs Monroe says again as Draco follows her to the school’s Floo’s.
“I haven’t,” Draco sighs while he reaches for his scotch and soda.
People can’t handle the things that break Harry, they don’t want him fragile and lacking. They want him as he was when he stood in that hall and vanquished their darkest tormentor. They want a god and what they have is a fractured human.
Ron snorts, “I’ve met the wanker, and I’m inclined to disagree.”
Days have gone by without a word from Draco, and something in Harry’s skin itches for the feel of him. A growing addiction he’s having a hard time satisfying alone. So he sits besides Ron—at a Cannons match, with Teddy bouncing between them—daydreaming of digging his fingers into the soft yielding flesh of Draco’s round arse.
Potter crosses his arms and leans against the bannister of the stairs—a thoughtful expression on his face. “He says you’re the worst.” Then after a moment of consideration—while that revelation barrels into Draco—Potter continues. “Though, I must admit that you don’t seem that terrible. Considering I remember when you
“Can’t fuck a partner the way I like to fuck my one-offs, mate.” Harry leans back against the cool brick of the wall.
The door is opened by a large man with blond hair and beady blue eyes. “Yeah?” he asks and Draco swallows—afraid to speak for fear of one of those giant fists crushing him.
angle.
“I think I’m up to the challenge.” Potter smiles. Then, at Pansy, he nods. “Parkinson, next night out he should have a good story for you.”
“What did you expect, Malfoy?” he says to himself, embittered by his own foolishness. “Heroes like Potter don’t make boyfriends out of scum like you.”
Draco’s answer is a delicious kiss.
Harry chuckles. “Well, one day I’m sure you’ll find your person too.”
The way Draco’s breath hitches when he’s close—it’s something none of them can fake well enough for Harry’s tastes. Makes his wanks unfulfilling when he tries to get into them, but Draco makes the sort of noises he wants to capture. The sort of sounds he wants to listen to forever while pulling on his cock beneath the hot spray of his shower.
He begs nothing and is rewarded with a lungful of Potter’s fresh, masculine scent when his mother pulls the cloth from Potter’s favourite chair.
Down into blackness, Harry tumbles while a chorus of shouts fades away.
“He’s just had a sleeping draught,” one of the Healer Aids tells him as she moves out of the room.
A voice that sounds like Ron’s whispers through his mind.
“Trainer, I suppose, but partner works—I guess. Anyways, since we were twenty. Harry recruited me from a rubbish gym,” he leans back against the counter having a good chuckle at the memory. Draco aches from how happy he seems.
Draco’s pulse is fast beneath Harry’s fingers and he tries to be soothing when he says, “I think you know what my type is by now, Malfoy.”
He must relay all of this to Ms Linde, for she watches him with pity. Her voice cracking when she tells Harry, “You’re still worthy, Mr Potter.”
Draco manages a grin at that and gives a hum of thanks. All the while he thinks about what he could’ve done to upset Teddy enough to not want to come to school. He can’t recall—beyond the mild tift he had with Weasel when he brought Teddy to parents evening. Which had been tame when one considers the fights they’d had during their own school years. “Perhaps I’ve frightened him in some way.” He frowns, upset because this is his first year teaching at Morgana’s and Draco’s feeling useless.
He shakes his head, wondering when his life has not been complicated…
What the hell is he doing? What the hell is
“Don’t worry about it, Harry.” Hermione says softly, stroking his hair with gentle fingers, allowing Harry to lean his head against her shoulder. “It happened a long time ago. They knew you were having problems for a while, and Ginny asked them not to say anything to you. I believe it wasn’t discussed afterwards, and certainly not after Ginny started dating Mark.”
He is followed by Parkinson; a young man who trained in the Academy with Peele, along with his partner; Walter.
He stands in the doorway, taking in the scene, his eyes swiftly moving over the compartment, making note of everything out of the ordinary. He performs several detecting spells to identify possible enchantments that could be associated with the incident. After finding none, he flicks a charm at his shoes to not leave any prints, and walks inside the compartment.
There’s a stunned silence. Scorpius? Intense argument, with the possibly murdered girl, only hours or moments before she died. Draco is starting to feel nauseous. “What time did this conversation take place?” Draco asks, forcing his voice to stay steady, forcing his expression into an indifferent one. He is quite aware how every pair of eyes are fixated on him, but he focuses on Quinn.
Albus gapes at her, thinking about what the bloody hell the girl just said. “You don’t even know me! How could you – how can you think that you’re in –”
The questioning finally ends, and James seems a bit bleary and confused, still evidently under the potion. They wait until they are sure he can leave the room, to retreat into his dormitory for a bit and skip his morning classes with his Head of House’s permission.
Potter mentioned, would be their boss, and what exactly the lovely Mrs Granger-Weasley had said to Potter. He takes in a calming breath before glancing at Potter, a blank look in his eyes. “Surely, as the Head Auror, you are more than capable to focus on the job, Potter, and not who you are paired with,” he says icily.
who was arguing with Travers, and conveniently left Albus out of their statement. He knows the Prefects were questioned the previous night, and he can only assume it had been one of them. Not Riley though – since the wanker most likely would have said that the whole incident was all Albus’s doing.
guest?!”
something about,” then he glances around them before he continues, “
Miss Westen and Mr Riley both had failed to mention during their first questioning that there had been a dispute on the train between Travers, Riley, Scorpius and Albus – which Westen saw taking place and Riley in fact participated in. Westen claimed that she hadn’t thought it had been important, while Riley told Harry that he didn’t want to say anything, since he was ashamed as he had thought that his girlfriend had still had some feelings for Albus – something they had been fighting over in their compartment afterwards, instead of making out.
Potter rolls his eyes. “Fine.” He huffs, and flicks his wand at the door, and then, puts his wand away, and starts to inspect the door with his hands.
Hermione smiles, kisses Harry on top of his head. “Okay.”
Apparently, the plan is that Berrycloth, Fungbury and Keir stay in Hogsmeade, while the rest – Potter, Quinn, Bones, Smith and Weasley – take their leave towards the school. The six Aurors currently standing by in the school will be given a break and much-needed time to sleep before they return back to the school for the following night.
Harry scratches the back of his head. “Erm. Rose said she was in the compartment around six pm…”
“As Professor Flitwick is needed elsewhere, I will act as your Head of House during this questioning, and will speak with him before tomorrow, so that he knows – as your actual Head of House – what we discussed today with the Aurors,” Moonstone tells Riley. “Would that be all right?”
He takes off his glasses and rubs them on the fabric of his Auror robes, before placing them back on. He then glances at the timepiece on his wrist. Almost ten-thirty. He decides to question Riley and then leave Quinn to it, as he needs to still check the kids – Molly would murder him if he didn’t – and then make it to the Three Broomsticks before midnight to meet Drac…
Thank you so much for reading and liking this story!
James gives Quinn a shrug. “I wouldn’t have, but then I heard her on the train, when we were on the journey back home for the holidays, and she was…talking about Albus to her friends,” James says, his voice cold.
Rage lifts its head inside Albus, as he watches how his friend looks up, and gives Albus a questioning look.
“What does that mean?” Mr Travers whispers, looking anxious.
They both know, that sometimes it takes time, and that not every case gets solved. However, murder cases tend to be so rare, that they do get solved. Always.
Downstairs, he orders the rest of the Weasley clan and his daughter to go to their dormitories for the night, promising to meet them the next day.
And Scorpius – he really should’ve been in Ravenclaw. Albus has a strong suspicion that Scorpius had begged the Sorting Hat to put him into Slytherin, to make his father happy. To not cause a scandal to their family. Like Albus had.
Albus grits his teeth together, knowing he should listen to Scorpius, knowing that he might’ve overreacted a bit. But still, he needs to think this through. He needs to talk to his arse of a brother. Or yell at him. Perhaps then, he can actually hear Scorpius out. Perhaps then, he can address the wretched feeling inside his chest, the one that makes it hard for him to breathe.
As if the murderer
James is lying on the floor, with his left arm twisting into a very weird and definitely painful direction, blinking through tears of pain. Albus, however, stands there, in the middle of the hallway, breathing heavily, his wand at the ready, his lip bleeding but otherwise intact.
Quinn scribbles something down. “Tell me about the train ride…”
He has come terms with it – his eventual divorce from Ginny. He knows they tried to fix things for a long time, and he also knows that there were no villains in their story – at least not the kind that tried to break up their marriage. They succeeded doing that by themselves; by throwing themselves into work, into their careers, into their children, and at the same time forgetting their relationship. They had many good years together and Harry knows he will cherish those memories. Along with the bad ones.
,” Potter whispers, and a wand movement for the last spell of the wand appears in the air between them, gleaming in silver.
“Oh. I was…um, going to check the compartment,” He says, and then gives Malfoy a sheepish look. “And also, to talk to you about the investigation if you happened to still be here.”
we’re talking about
His thoughts are interrupted by Quinn, who manages to silence Ginny with a serious expression before he asks James to continue explaining the events of the party.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
When the kids were in town, Harry was usually good about keeping the pantry and fridge stocked so he could cook. Unfortunately, the children had lived with Ginny for the last week before Hogwarts started so Harry had been surviving mostly on take-out. The pantry contained a quarter full box of cereal, but he doubted he had any milk.
There's a little bit of attempted non-consensual sex in this chapter
“It has a lot of grey, but it’s not that bad. You could probably throw up some paintings to brighten the place up, maybe update the lighting.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Really?” she said suspiciously. “I’ve never found any hangover pills that actually work. Except the ones made by...” she trailed off.
“You can hide the presence of all five of us by yourself?” Hermione asked, surprised.
“Merlin, Teddy, yes, basically. Wizard cocaine. Gogwart’s Brew. It’s like cocaine but it’s way more intense and lasts for days, but I don’t do it anymore. I haven’t touched it or any other wizard drugs since I quit over 20 years ago,” Harry explained exasperatedly.
“Hello?”
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
“I promise to remember everything you have taught me about love and kindness.”
Harry smiled slightly.
Harry’s face burned as he stared into Draco’s grey eyes.
“Well,” Harry muttered to himself. “Perhaps it’s for the best.”
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
“Why’s that?” he asked, placing the crook of his elbow over his eyes.
Harry grabbed Draco’s face in his hands, pulling him close for a passionate, but appropriate, kiss. Draco’s arms wrapped around Harry’s waist and kissed him back, oblivious to the cheering audience beside them.
“Dammit, Harry, you promised you wouldn’t be late this time!” Hermione criticized.
“Everything is good on our end,” Harry replied.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
“Good,” Harry muttered, pausing to make sure they were fully outside before he continued. “I think Astoria hates me.”
“No,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “Do you want to be a stay at home father?”
“Did you really get attacked by a vampire last night?” Teddy asked, unable to contain his curiosity.

“I need some space,” he said, pulling the handle on the car door to open it. “I’ll call you when you can come back.”
Contains tense moments of mortal peril and panic. No explicit violence.
Harry shrugged.
Draco looked at Harry and started to speak but his face froze, his smile shifting down to an open gape and his eyes glazing over with a distant stare. Harry quickly twisted to look in the direction of Draco’s gaze, but saw nothing, turning back just in time to see Draco slumping down out of his chair.
“Maybe he couldn’t be with you the way he wanted. Maybe he couldn’t even think of you without falling apart. You lost the ability to communicate through your tattoos. Both of you lived completely separate lives from each other. But, unlike me, unlike everyone else whose Soulmate died in the war or before their time, you have a second chance. You have the opportunity to be with him the way you always dreamed you would be.”
“Don’t worry,” he said. “Yours is still the best dick I ever had.”
Harry shrugged.
H: Got the day off. Whatever works for u.

Before he could second guess anymore, he pressed send. This time, he did throw his phone across the room and straight into the magically cushioned wall which had been designed for catching things that probably shouldn’t be thrown.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
Draco’s lips started to turn blue. He was breathing, slowly, but showed all the signs of suffocation. His eyes remained open, frozen, gazing at nothing in particular. Harry wasn’t certain that he was still conscious at all.
“Astoria,” Teddy said behind him. “Something’s wrong with Draco. I don’t know what happened. Everything was fine but then...” he broke off, listening. Quickly, he ran into the potion lab and began searching.
I’m sorry if I surprised you at Kings Cross. As you may have already deduced, my father is dead. He died in his sleep last night. I thought about writing to you, but I didn’t know what to say and I wanted to make sure the curse was really gone before I said anything.
The quill scribbled away, oblivious of any distractions, and happy to do its job. For a moment, Harry wondered what it would be like to be so clear-headed with only one simple objective to worry about.
Almost immediately, Harry felt the pain in his head begin to fade and the fog that had been surrounding him began to clear.
Draco stared at the train tracks in front of him, offering his mother half-hearted smiles when she glanced at him. At any moment, he would be boarding the train and potentially meeting his Counterpart. He caught the stern eye of his father for a moment and quickly rolled down his sleeve, resolving not to look at it until he arrived at Hogwarts.
“Is that your question?”

H: Everything is fine. Draco and I got into a fight, but we’ll be fine.
“All Astoria knows about you is my memories,” Draco reminded him, slowly reaching to take his hand.
H: Thanks, Gin.
Dear Draco,
Teddy blushed as Harry and Draco shared a smile then took a sip of their drinks. Slowly, Teddy brought the cup down to his lips and tasted it. He was shocked by how smooth the drink felt. It was nothing like the burning, cheap fire whiskey he and Victoire used to sneak from Harry’s liquor cabinet.
Hermione, Ron, Astoria, and Ginny chatted away by Harry vaguely discussing a plan. Harry let himself fall behind the group, listening to Draco intently.
Draco shrugged.
“It’s my specialty,” Astoria confirmed. “Not all of us had invisibility cloaks to sneak around under when we wanted to meet up with our Soulmate from another house.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Maybe a little,” Harry replied, smiling slightly. “Were you ever jealous of me and Ginny?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t know about all that...” Teddy tried to protest.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
I was sorry to read that you and Ginny divorced. I must have seemed like an ass yesterday inviting you both to dinner. I must apologize, I haven’t kept up with the news of our classmates very well.
Harry picked up his phone and reread the last message Draco had sent.
“We will walk quickly,” Harry agreed, beginning in the direction Hermione had pointed.
(See the end of the chapter for
H: No, u can still move in. Have u started packing?
“I’m not surprised,” Narcissa replied, a small smile playing on her lips. It was never there when Lucius was around. Draco wished his mother would smile more often.
“Wait, you really were a cokehead?!” he exclaimed.
“I’m sure it’s nice, but it’s really no place to raise three children. James and Albus should have their own rooms. They could have that in the manor,” Draco argued, motioning with the hand that was not still holding Harry’s to Malfoy Manor looming before them.
Draco’s owl stared at him, clearly waiting for a response.
“All I’m saying is that you could be providing them with more,” Draco explained. “I’m sure your apartment is the best you can do, but imagine how much more space they can have in my home.”
“What happened with you and Ginny?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco glanced at him, considering then glanced back at the manor. He sighed, sitting back in the car and closing the door.
“Voldemort’s cult is back,” she repeated.
“I love you,” Harry said, fighting the part of him that wanted nothing more than to grab onto Draco and never let him go.
“Why would you even ask a question like that?” Draco asked.”You know you’ll just get jealous if i tell you I did.”
“Fuck,” he muttered, realizing he felt as if he’d been living in a desert for weeks. Sleepily, he waved his wand in an attempt to summon some water, but all he accomplished was summoning an empty glass.

“Draco, I promise to live each and every day of the rest of my life with you.”
Anyway, I was writing to let you know that I want to be your friend. I believe that Soulmates should at least try to be together in one way or another. I understand that our Hogwarts days are far behind us and the war has done irreparable  damage to our relationship, but I don’t think that should mean we can’t be part of each other’s lives.
“I guess in general then,” Draco said.
D: Sorry if I’m being too pushy. If you really don’t want to talk to me, just tell me and I’ll leave you alone.
“It’s an hour's walk this way,” Hermione announced as soon as Astoria, Ginny, and Harry appeared. “We can’t fly, too risky. They might detect us coming. We will have to go on foot.”
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
“Right on fucking schedule,” Harry muttered, leaning down to pick up the letter and reading it.
Slowly, the panic inside of him began to fade. He stared at Harry’s face, recognizing the crease on his forehead as being one not of cruelty, but of concern.
“I don’t get why she thinks I’d hurt you,” Harry muttered, kicking a rock as they walked.
“You really don’t have to wear it if you don’t want to,” Harry reminded him.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
“Narcissa, we understand that you and Lucius divorced shortly after the war, but kept in touch. How are you affected by his death?”
“Draco,” Astoria’s voice was suddenly next to him, but he couldn’t turn his head to look.
Harry interlaced their fingers and suddenly became aware of something hard on Draco’s finger. He pulled their hands up to eye level and saw that Draco was now wearing the ring on his right ring finger. Harry’s blush deepended.
“I’m excited,” Teddy replied, allowing the shift in conversation. “I’m a little bummed it’s not paid, but not surprised. No positions like that are. It just means Victoire and I will have to wait longer until we find a place together.”
“Watch your tongue, Potter. I’m not trying to judge your parenting skills.”
The next morning, Harry woke up to find two owls sitting in his living room. One was Ulysses, the other Harry recognized as a ministry owl.
Draco smirked.
“Like firewhisky.”
“I’m happy to rent you two an apartment,” Draco offered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why not?” Harry asked. “Unless sharing a room with a couple half-bloods would hurt his little ego.”
“What would be wrong with that?” Harry asked, the crease on his forehead twisting into a full-out frown. “I like my apartment.”
“My children are perfectly comfortable already.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“About?” Draco asked in return, though he knew exactly what Harry was referring to.
“Harry,” Draco said, looking over to meet his eyes. “I think you should go back to your apartment for the night.”
“Skip,” Draco replied.
I want you to understand, I am not looking to become romantically involved with you again. I know the promises we made to each other and I fully intend to be true to my word.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
The owl continued to stare at Harry patiently.
“Her whole family is like that. It’s been notoriously difficult for the women in her family to conceive. It’s a miracle her mother was able to have Astoria after having Daphne. Do you remember Daphne? She was in our class.”
“What happened to her?” Ginny inquired.
As Harry got older, he noticed the thoughts on his arm becoming more delusioned and frightening. The person often thought about “wizards” and used crazy terms Harry had never heard before. Those thoughts confused Harry, but they weren’t nearly as bad as he’s going to hit me again, better me than mother, why does everything have to hurt so much, please stop. Please stop, I want to die. Harry would always stare at his arm while the terrible thoughts appeared and faded, waiting anxiously for everything to go back to its crazy normal.
(See the end of the chapter for
never tortured you, right?” Harry clarified.
Scorpius told me Albus was sorted into Slytherin. You don’t need to worry about your son being in any danger, Scorpius will take care of him. Not that Albus really needs it. Scorpius told me he was already pretty good at fighting for himself.
Harry relaxed, putting his wand back in his pocket and rubbing his eyes sleepily.
“I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks,” Harry replied, turning away and returning his focus to his new friends.
“Don’t move,” he reminded him, their lips brushing against each other as he spoke.
The reporter continued once Draco had answered her first question. “What can you tell us about rumors of a curse your father placed on you that could only be broken by his death?”
Suddenly, a bright light seemed to shine through the darkness that threatened to seep back over him. Nothing here was adding up. The familiar pain he expected never came and, in fact, Draco felt himself grow stronger every time Harry muttered the spell. This wasn’t the Harry that tortured him so many years ago. This Harry was keeping him alive.
The others followed walking at a pace that made their legs burn, but pushing past the discomfort.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry kissed back, struggling to keep still. He wanted to move his hands behind his back to help resist the urge to reach out and touch Draco, but he was concerned even that movement would break the moment.

This chapter contains depictions of violence and blood that some readers may find disturbing. Nothing too graphic, but if blood squicks you out this may not be the chapter for you.
“Seriously, I shouldn’t have said that,” Harry tried to say, looking over at Draco.
“Teddy, your parents would be very proud of you,” Harry assured him, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. “You’re taking the time to find out what you really want to do rather than throwing yourself into a life that will make you miserable. There’s nothing wrong with that.”
“I bet you’ll be able to afford this stuff someday,” Harry commented. “Wand making can be very lucrative.”

“Ready to act your age yet?” she inquired.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
“Shit,” Harry exclaimed, instinctually pulling out his wand and rushing over to Draco, kneeling beside him.
As soon as the liquid slipped down his throat, he felt himself returning to normal. The weight of gravity was no longer as pressing and the air his lungs brought in was filled with the oxygen he’d been so desperately missing.  A few seconds later, the spell that had been holding him down disappeared.
“Was that ok?” Harry asked, relaxing.
They arrived at the apartment in one piece which normally wouldn’t be surprising, but Harry had a sneaking suspicion that the vampire attack was not a random occurrence. Like the ministry, he assumed it was a planned assassination attempt.
With a flick of his wand, Harry summoned his phone to check his messages. As expected, there were a few worried messages from Ron and Hermione, but there was also a message from a number he didn’t recognize that said only “Hello, Harry.”
“Yeah, but you don’t have to bring out the expensive stuff for me,” Teddy tried to insist.
Harry ate in front of the tv, trying and failing to stop his mind from wandering to the phone which still sat silently.
“I swear, Harry, if you are late to this meeting I will never babysit for you again,” she threatened.
Harry figured it out within the hour. He secretly watched the thoughts on his arm scream SLYTHERIN I MUST BE IN SLYTHERIN as the sorting hat was lowered onto Draco’s head. It gave Harry the idea to ask for Gryffindor. Clearly, the hat took requests into account. He watched Draco’s smug face as he walked towards his new house, but saw the words on his arm scream only relief that his father would be proud. He won’t take me out of school thank god.
Suddenly, Harry’s phone began to buzz. It wasn’t the single buzz of a text message however, it was the persistent sound of an incoming call. Harry flipped the phone screen up and stared in shock as Draco’s number, which he still hadn’t saved in his contacts, stared back at him.

“Just go home,” Draco insisted as Harry began to drive. “I’ll call you when I’m ready for you to come back.”
“I promise to love you forever and always. Only you.”
“I was far from the only one who fought in that war,” he reminded him. “You have your parents to thank as well.”
“Last I checked you’d won 45 duels and I’d won... oh what was it? 49?” she teased.
Dear Mr. Malfoy,
With that, Klerig walked out of the room without waiting for a response. Harry’s eyes landed on the stack of papers that had been delivered to his office before he arrived that morning. Sighing, he pulled out his enchanted quill which immediately got to work filling out all the easy details like his name and personal details.
He jumped as he heard his phone ringing from the bedroom. One flick of the wand had the phone flying directly into his hands and he answered without looking at the caller id.
Harry kissed back immediately, his hands starting to rise to take hold of Draco’s waist. Draco’s hands quickly grabbed Harry’s wrists and pushed them back to his sides.

Harry woke up to a pesky scratching sound and groaned as he was hit with the full force of his headache.

Teddy nodded and looked away for a moment.
When Draco was ten he realized that his Counterpart was not a she, but a he. Thoughts about sex and the lackluster explanation his awful family had given him began appearing. His “talk” was not nearly as in-depth as the talk Draco had received. At times, Draco found himself laughing at his Counterpart’s innocence.
“So this anti-gossip charm,” Harry began as he followed Draco out of the dining room and away from the very awkward lunch. “It works everywhere?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mum, I think I’m gay,” Draco announced one day after scouring every inch of the house for the detection charms his father often left behind.
“You await my response,” Harry muttered, opening the pouch that was attached to the letter and taking one of the pills inside.
Harry reclined his seat, closing his eyes as he listened to the pitter-patter of rain hitting the roof of his car. The sound brought him a sense of peace that he wasn’t sure he’d be able to achieve otherwise. His phone buzzed.

Draco shook his head, glaring forward at nothing in particular.
“You must have been drinking a lot,” Teddy said, thoughtfully. “Or was she disguised?”
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
Harry stared at the group still chattering in front of him. He felt a tear escape from his eye and roll swiftly down his cheek. He quickly wiped his face on his arm to get rid of any evidence.
Harry didn’t respond, just stared forward as the manor grew closer and the pit in his stomach deepened. He wanted desperately to reach out for Draco’s hand and take the comfort his touch provided. It broke his heart to know that the pain he was feeling couldn’t be healed by Draco since it was in part because of him.
“I could do it by myself,” Astoria replied. “While you distract them.”
“Harry,” Teddy said, eyes still glued to his Soulmate tattoo. “Something’s wrong. Victoire isn’t thinking anything.”
“That would be amazing, Draco, thank you so much!” he exclaimed, his attention turning to his Soulmate tattoo on his wrist.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Has it been difficult so far?” Harry asked, quietly.
Draco nodded, looking away.
Draco pulled away, letting go of Harry’s waist and taking a step back.
“Your question.”
“She knows
“How optimistic,” Hermione muttered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m a better dueler than Harry,” Ginny added with a smirk.
“Pregnancy was difficult for her,” Draco explained. “Scorpius’s birth nearly killed her. We thought about adopting, but Astoria decided she would rather focus on helping the house-elves. I would have been happy to have another child, but I am perfectly content with my son.”
“I’m sorry,” Ginny replied, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder for a moment.
“Probably Albus’s,” Harry replied, his hand dropping back to his side. “James has been weird about people using his stuff ever since he turned 14.”

Harry sighed.
“It’s fine,” Harry replied, shrugging. “I understand why you were stressed, but it all worked out, right?”
H: sounds good
Just like yesterday, his head cleared up almost instantly.
Draco had grown his hair out. He hadn’t noticed at the train station. Draco must have had it pulled back in a low ponytail like he did now. Without seeing Draco from the back, Harry couldn’t tell how long his hair was, but he guessed it was around the same length as Lucius used to wear his.
“Sleep well?” she asked, watching him with a stony gaze.
Harry’s phone buzzed and he saw a message from Ginny.
The summoning charm Harry threw seemed to bounce off the owl completely. Harry watched helplessly as one of the terrible letters flew away towards Draco. Quickly, he unfolded the two letters remaining and groaned. Of course, the owl had taken the first one.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You would do that?” he asked.
“Fuck!” Harry exclaimed, crumpling and throwing this letter away as well. He looked up as the owl flew into the room and glanced at the crumpled pieces of paper on the floor. He cocked his head to the side for a minute, eyeing them. Harry quickly leaned down, trying to grab the paper as he realized what the owl was thinking, but he was too late. The owl reached out a claw and grabbed one of the letters, flying out the window as Harry screamed after him to stop.
“Potter, your stubbornness will be the death of you,” Klerig commented, shaking her head. “Just keep an eye out. The blood-sucker admitted to being part of the cult and she said there would be more coming. And please, for the love of all that is good, get your damn paperwork filled out on time for once.”

Harry rolled his eyes and flicked his wand to open the window. The owl landed on the windowsill and held out one claw containing another letter and a small pouch.
Harry nodded, pushing past the disappointed feeling that tried to well up inside him.

Harry had seen these thoughts pop up multiple times, but the first time Draco saw it, he was 11 and preparing to go to Hogwarts. His excitement at meeting his Counterpart had slowly waned as he watched him learn about the wizarding world for the first time. For years he’d tried to convince himself that his Counterpart was just a pureblood wizard who thought primarily of muggle things, but this past week had proven beyond a doubt that his Counterpart was most likely a mudblood.
“You mean we just take turns asking questions?” Harry clarified.
“Huh?” Harry replied, snapping out of his daydreams. “Oh, yes, sorry. What did you say?”
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
“It’s my turn to ask a question,” Harry reminded him. “Have you dated anyone in the past twenty years?”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut for a moment and took a deep breath before opening them and looking at Teddy.
“It was just one meeting and you managed to convince them to have aurors present when enforcing magical creature land requirements all by yourself,” Harry reminded her defensively.

“Anyway,” Hermione interrupted. “Astoria, do you think you would be able to help me mask us as we walk up?”
“I can see well enough without my glasses these days. That Lasik surgery did wonders.”
“What?” Harry said, pulling his phone away to look at the date and time. “Fuck!”

Draco nodded.
“I won’t come inside,” Harry promised.
T: ron told me what happened last night. If u want to spend time recovering and arent ready for me to move in yet ill understand
“God forbid James and Albus learn to share,” Harry replied, his frustration getting the better of him as he pulled his hand away from Draco’s. “I’m sure Scorpius is just as spoiled as you were when you started Hogwarts.”
It was a proven fact that the tattoos translated all thoughts except ones about the Soulmate in question until they met. This phenomenon prohibited the Soulmates from truly communicating until they met each other.
“Morning. Glad to see you again,” Harry greeted the owl sarcastically as he pulled the letter from his claw and began to read it.

Harry just stared at her, unsure what to say. She watched him for a moment, waiting for a response. When she didn’t receive one, she shook her head, turning to face forward. She stared at the house for a moment. Both of them found themselves bathed in a thoughtful, but wordless silence.

“I promise that no other man or woman on this earth will earn my love as long as I have you."
“It’s my home,” Draco argued, frowning. “I grew up there. I’ve raised my son there. I know there are plenty of bad memories, but there are plenty of good ones too. And like I’ve mentioned, it’s currently housing nearly 15 house-elves that would otherwise be homeless or living in the ministry.”
“Astoria will still be there to take care of the house-elves,” he said.
“Alright,” he muttered. “Drop your letters and go.”
H: Who is this?

Teddy looked at Draco with wide eyes.
Harry tossed the letter aside and opened the pouch Draco had sent him to find more of the same hangover cure pills. He summoned a glass of water and downed the first one, tucking the second in his pocket.
Eventually, Harry fell into a restless sleep.
apartment. I didn’t invite choo in.”
“Are you fucking serious?” Harry muttered, stumbling back in and pouring his fourth glass of firewhisky. Though, considering the fullness of the glasses, it was more like his ninth or tenth.
“What?” Teddy asked, watching the exchange and suddenly becoming very intrigued. “You were addicted to cocaine?”
On the journey home, Harry considered all the things that would stop Draco from replying.
She looked at Harry. The moonlight broke through the clouds, making the tears that had begun to fall down her cheeks seem to glow.
Harry quickly cast a charm so the glass was clear for him but frosted white for anyone on the outside. Perhaps Hermione and Draco hadn’t realized Harry would already be back to work. Or maybe Draco was trying to torture him or remind him to answer the damn text message. Harry knew in the back of his mind that the most likely reason Draco was currently walking past his office was that he no longer had to avoid Harry and this was the quickest route to his destination.
“They were never really gone,” Harry pointed out, raising one eyebrow.
“She was a year older than me,” Astoria explained. “She died in the Battle of Hogwarts.”
“Not outside,” Draco replied as they walked out into the backyard.
Harry walked out onto his balcony and sat down on the porch furniture that was in desperate need of cleaning. If he had been a little less tipsy and distracted, he may have worried about his clothes getting dirty or sitting on a bug. But as it turned out, the only thing Harry could think about at the moment was Draco.
Harry was obsessed with his tattoo the moment he was old enough to understand what it was. He spent all the time he was allowed staring at it and reminding himself it meant that he wasn’t alone. He often pondered what thoughts his Soulmate would see popping up on his tattoo.
Draco nodded, feeling the tears well up in his eyes as well. Harry took a deep breath and began.

“Fuck you.”
“Fuck!” Harry exclaimed again, muttering under his breath as he continued to cast spells on Draco. “Teddy,” he finally stopped for a moment, turning to his godson. “Get Astoria. Now.”
Harry wandered back into the kitchen and checked his phone which he’d left sitting on the counter. There was another message from the new number which he had neglected to save as a contact.
Harry disappeared from his vision and his weight disappeared from his body. He felt something touch his lips and pour into his mouth and he swallowed instinctively.
Harry finished buttoning his shirt and pulled on his auror robes. There would be no time to try to tame his hair, though even when he was on time he rarely tried. Still, if there were ever a day to try to look presentable, it was today.
The response was almost immediate.
“You can drive me home,” he relented. “But you can’t stay. I want to talk to Astoria about you and I don’t want you listening.”
“Teddy,” Harry said firmly but with a small smile as he took his drink from Dop and thanked the house-elf. “Don’t look a gift 300-year-old Dragon Barrel Brandy in the mouth.”

Dop nodded sheepishly and left the room, glancing back a couple of times as he left.
Harry shook his head.
Teddy looked back at Draco, excitement spreading across his face.

“I wouldn’t hate it,” he replied. “I’d have to find some hobbies to occupy myself while the kids are at school, but ultimately I think I would enjoy it. As it is now, I barely have any time with them. I’ve had to work longer hours at the ministry to pay for my apartment and help Ginny make mortgage on our old house. I don’t hold any animosity towards her or the fact I pay her a boatload of alimony. I know it would be less if I’d just let her work like she wanted to in the first place.”
“Draco,” Harry began, tears already starting to fill his eyes. “30 years ago, I made a series of promises to you. Now those promises are a bit outdated. I would like to revise them if that’s ok with you?”
“We could run,” Ron suggested.
“Probably not a great idea,” Draco agreed. “What about just truth?”
“Then maybe I should be fighting to have hippogryph ownership banned completely,” Hermione replied walking into view outside of Harry’s office.
Harry arrived at the ministry in precisely ten minutes and found Hermione within the next two. She glared at him but said nothing as they walked into the conference room. Luckily, despite being five minutes late, they had somehow managed to be the first to arrive. The rest of the group arrived a few minutes later.

“Just during my drug binge,” Harry reminded him. “Other than that, no one.”
Harry eyed the blond boy for a moment, feeling the build-up of a hatred he usually reserved for horrible family. Hogwarts was supposed to be better than the miserable life he was leaving behind. Harry suspected he would never escape those wretched feelings of inadequacy and stupidity if he engaged with Malfoy.
Once they reached the end of the aisle, she stood on her toes to give him a kiss on the cheek and moved to sit with Arthur in a nearby chair.
Clarity started returning, but with it the panic only grew. For a moment, Draco returned to that terrible, damp place where he’d been kept for weeks being torn open again and again by men with his lover’s face.

Harry had the sudden urge to step outside his office and call Draco’s name. In fact, he made it halfway to the door before he stopped, turned around, and sat back at his desk.
“He should only be able to hear the things he’s meant to hear,” Ron replied. “Part of why it embeds so deeply inside your head is so that it can deduce your intentions.”
