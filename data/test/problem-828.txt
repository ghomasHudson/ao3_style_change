A gasp made him pull himself from his thoughts. Astoria was sitting across the creek. She was wrapped in a pale blue cloak. The same cloak Daphne had been wearing when Draco had slit her throat. They must have washed away the blood. Draco's cold disconnection snapped away at the sight of the tear stricken girl.
Well shit, Draco thought. Potter must have been aware of Draco’s knowledge of the army for a least a couple of weeks now, but he did nothing to change the army’s tactics at all. Which means, Potter wanted to see how dedicated to his secret Draco was. Potter could easily know that Draco has been covering for Dumbledore's Army since they first started meeting, making the rest of Umbridge’s minions run around in circles. Potter just manipulated Draco into playing his entire hand, and by simply doing nothing but observing.
Mr. and Ms. Greengrass were shoved to the ground by harsh hands. Alecto Carrow snatched Astoria by her long dark hair, preventing her from reaching her parents, as she screamed for them, arms outstretched. Carrow pulled Astoria's hair to ensure she would have no choice but to witness her parent's death.
Severus glared at him, but didn't move to take the book from Draco. "If you're not assisting, why don't you leave then?" Severus barked. He was getting tired.
What struggles would Pansy go through? Was the Dark Lord going to punish her for her father's wrongdoings? Hasn't she suffered enough?
Pansy burst through the silence with her shrill laughter. Pansy was clinging to the arm of a flattered Montague. Daphne instantly scowled at the addition. Draco tensed, there was a reason he had been ignoring both Daphne and Pansy for the last couple of weeks. Pansy new how to hit where it hurts.
"You wouldn't stop looking over at Potter during dinner, I think you even smiled, but that could be a trick of the light."
“You know about what happens in the Room of Requirement,” the boy growled quietly, turning Draco to face him.
The ground steadied beneath their feet, the grass reaching their ankles. Students milled around, waiting for class to begin. Draco watched as his peers laughed, for once not being the only one detached from the rest of his peers joyousness, as Theo and Blaise were silent next to him. Students gathered around the hut, a short distance away from the entrance, some sitting down, enjoying the weather.
Daphne lifted her legs onto the bench they shared, the toes of her shoes resting snuggly against Draco's thigh. Draco rested his hand on her knee.
Shit. Draco just rubbed his eyes, pitching the bridge of his nose. Sighing. He needed to change the subject. Damper the mood, but Potter was… flirting with him and Draco loved it.
Draco struggled to peak over the sideways table. Granger laid unconscious. Weaslet and Longbottom standing above her. Spells coming out from their wands, but so many surrounded them.
"You won't have to deal with me anymore. I won't try to kiss you. We can just-" a sob wracked through Potter's body. Draco's chin quivered. "We can just do the lessons, I'll try harder. Practice more," Potter cried. Gasping for air. "I'm sorry," Potter begged.
Draco could feel his ears warm and his stomach turn at the casualness of Potter's accusation, anyone, student or professor, could overhear and ruin what advantage Draco has gained with ease. His temper snapped in fear with- “Actually, I have known the entire time, and if I wanted to, I could have all of your little army carving lines into their bodies until there’s not a single inch of them unscarred!” Draco snapped.
Draco didn't have the chance to turn around before Daphne was running to the couch, she shoved Montague off the couch with all of her might. "You keep your fucking hands off of h-"
Daphne only smiled at his distressed before turning to lead the way back onto the main street of town. The only sound between them was their footsteps on the cobbled path.
He watched them go, it was too late to wonder if he had made the correct decision. At least now he would have an excuse to sleep.
"I don't need to remind you that appearances are necessary," Lucius hissed, his hand dig into Draco's already sore shoulder.
Draco hurried to the Room of Hidden Things in the blanket of darkness that covered the late hour. What was he thinking? Potter would hate him if he missed their engagement, they had just made up. Potter probably wasn't even in the room anymore, Draco was hours late, but he had to be sure.
"You best remember yours," Daphne challenged the authority of the Malfoys, taking a drag of her smoke.
The lines were blurring. He could possibly perform all the parts asked of him, required of him. How was he supposed to comfort Potter, to help him? Reaching out to Potter would be like reaching for the sun while being sucked into hell.
How ironic that in order to arrive to platform nine and three-quarters, a wizard had to travel through the heart of muggle London.
How did Potter know that? What did Daphne tell him? Why would she even bother with telling Potter? Daphne had nothing to gain from showing her hand to Potter. Unless-
"What? Would you rather teach him? He hates you, and I'm not going to let whatever personal vendetta you have against his father risk his teaching or safety," Draco snapped. Severus gasped at his bluntness, at how quickly Draco was willing to fight dirty.
"Well, it is so hard to tell these days," Dumbledore shrugged, "I do know that you have been spending a lot of time with Harry. I wonder…"
"Know your place, werewolf," Lucius growled. He didn't want to draw attention to this embarrassing situation.
"I don't know why Dumbledore wants me to bother teaching Occlumency, you're nothing against the Dark Lord-"
"What the fuck?" Draco hurried backwards, taking out his wand. What was happening? How hard did Astoria hit his head?
"I think they want to tell me in person," he brushed off the accusation Daphne was implying. He would always defend his family with a knee jerk response. "Are you okay?" Draco asked stupidly.
Draco didn't pull away from the nails on his cheek, "I'm alright, but thank you for the suggestion."
Draco looked down as he was led down the hall. He wished there was blood on his hands so he could wash it away, maybe the twisting guilt in his chest could be washed away also.
Draco continued to watch Potter, keeping an eye out for any wandering eyes from his social circle, but everyone was in conversation, or minding only themselves. Potter finally looked up from his stew, making eye contact with Draco. Draco gave a slight nod of acknowledgement, before shifting his eyes to the exit of the Great Hall and returning his eyes to Potter’s. Potter nodded in understanding.
He found the creek. He crystal clear water he remembered was brown. The massive current was a slow tickle. The girl he used to play with here was dead at his hand. Her body then used to the worst type of magic. Her sacrifice was never ending.
Daphne pushed his feet off of her lap suddenly, storming off to the girl's dorm. Draco looked up at Pansy for guidance. She gently motioned for him to sit up, she followed Daphne up to their dorm. Draco wished he could follow, repair whatever damage he made, but he couldn't get into the girl's dorm.
She could be manipulated, she had been in the past. However, she would be more careful around Draco. If he was going to gain control over her, ensure his own safety, she would have to trust him. She would have to feel safe with him. He would be working against the authority he would be given as her betrothed. How? How could she feel safe with him when she was practically his property? She would have to be in control. She would need to rebel from the role she was forced into, one form of rebellion. A cigarette.
He pushed himself against the door, straightening his back against the wood. His cries reverberated back to him in the large empty lavatory.
Draco walked slowly to her, not wanting to scare her. She nodded easily, cooing at the cat Draco had previously named Bentley. Bentley, rubbed up against Draco's leg as he tried to pass. "Horrendous animal," Draco bent down to pet the cat. With this angle, he could see the bruise on her cheek.
She didn't say anything for a long time. Draco wiped his nose on his handkerchief. He was still crying.
Draco blinked. He was sure Crabbe would have been disappointed in the latter. Draco read it beforehand, of course he did, and the letter was simple.
"Redeem myself? Why would you assume I need redeeming?" Draco's voice was dangerously low. He made clear that Severus needed to pick his next few words carefully. "And do you mean redeem myself for violence against another student or redeem myself for happening to have a relationship with Potter? Because both are not subjects that I actually need redemption from, so why don't you just save your breath?"
"Draco it is, then." His Lord clasped his hands behind him, observing the freckled stars above them.
How much blood would he have on his hands by the end of this war that he was never meant to be a part of?
Draco didn’t want to, she had to see that, just the idea of serving the man who killed a child twisted his gut…but if this is what he did to Cedric, a boy who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, what would he do to a traitor? To his family?
His stomach lurched painfully. His knees buckled beneath him. He covered his mouth as bile jumped to his throat. Gasping as he felt the warm liquid drip down his chin.
Draco reached out to Potter, taking his hand. "I'll keep teaching you Occlumency, Potter. I already talked to Professor Dumbledore about it. We'll figure this out, okay?" he comforted. Potter nodded, meeting Draco's gaze, trust was in Potter's gaze.
"HOW?" his mother beaded her fist into his chest. "How could you?!" she shoved him into the wall. Her voice echoed with the pain that tore into her soul.
But why Daphne? Why someone so young? The Greengrass family was pure blooded, but they were never apart of the first war as far as Draco knew. Daphne's father didn't even have the Dark Mark. What could pressure them to auction off their daughter? Perhaps to gain mercy from the Dark Lord? Was the Dark Lord making an example of them? A warning to other families who didn't swear their lives to him?
But now, in this simple moment together, Draco allowed himself to just look. Potter hadn’t changed much, his hair was longer and he had gotten taller, but otherwise he appeared the same. Draco couldn’t stop the first genuine smile he had in months from forming on his face. He couldn’t stop his heart beating faster. He couldn’t stop the warmth in his chest that melted away the ice that Draco had surrounded himself in while at the Manor. He couldn’t stop these emotions if he wanted to, a dangerous risk, but a risk Draco wanted to take. He wouldn’t stop these feelings if he could, which was the most dangerous thought of them all.
"Potter," Draco covered Potter's hand on his, "I'm fine. You know I can handle myself, you don't need to worry."
Black shuffled through his pockets. He pulled out a packet of cigarettes. He gave Draco a smoke without a comment of his age. Draco lit both smokes with his zippo lighter. He was thankful for something to do with his hands. He thought about a safe conversation topic. The list he was coming up with was short.
"I'm sure you have questions," Draco began, praying for Potter to say something, anything productive. He only wanted to answer the questions which were asked, but this conversation made him want to peel his face off.
"Not all the time! Just when we're alone. I promise. He even made me swear not to tell anyone," Black explained.
"Here," Blaise took out his wand. "Aguamenti," he enchanted, providing Draco with a steady stream of clear, cool water. The instant Draco dipped his hands into the stream, the water darkened slightly with blood. The water was cool enough that the bruises on his knuckles sighed in relief. When Draco was finished washing, he cupped the water, bring the cool liquid to his mouth to clench his thirst.
He was debating if he should count the Floo Powder in a pink vase, but he was sure she only had the green powder because she had no choice. Should he count the powder? It wasn't because of lack of trying, if Umbridge wanted pink glass, she would, but there was no such thing as pink Floo Powder.
The group walked to the couch. Montague looked down at Blaise and Bulstrode on the couch with his hands in his pockets, an easy smile on his lips. "Shoo, shoo," Pansy waved them away with her fingers.
He had to protect Potter from what he was. Shield him from Draco's world, but how? How could he have Potter and still protect him?
Potter was staring at him, the faces behind him bled into a blur, but Potter's look of shock and horror would remain seared into his memory. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, his face hot in shame. He swallowed, making himself face Potter, not allowing himself to look down. "Someone take him to Madam Pomphrey," his voice traveled easily through the crowd. Potter opened his mouth, but Draco just shook his head slightly before walking past him.
"How could you think that? How could I be capable of hurting Pansy?" he defended himself, trying to plant enough doubt for his own behalf.
Draco stilled as Pansy weakly sat up, there was a scream not coming from Pansy's lips. Pansy had tears down her face, her head was bleeding, there was crimson bleeding through her white shirt from the shattered glass.
The air had stirred. Movements in the shadows. Glances over wine. Hushed whispers behind closed doors. Draco could see but he wasn't allowed to watch. The Dark Lord had begun to spin his web. How was the question, but everyone knew what the goal was. To catch and devour Potter. Draco would only be able useless to help.
The sound of hurried feet through the underbrush over the ringing in his ears. Astoria stood before him. She wanted to make him feel half the pain she felt. Astoria shook as she dropped the stone she held in her hand. Her eyes wide at the sight of blood dripping from blond hair.
The family stopped in front of their Lord. No one would look up at him. Rough hands shoved the family to stand in a line, shoulder to shoulder, but at two feet of distance. Everyone looked down. Daphne stood out in her colorful robes and her halo of blond hair that was curled down her shoulders.
Draco's knees gave out with the force Potter pushed him out of his mind. His breath in hungry gasps. Potter was in his hands and knees, shaking.
The door to the shack slammed shut behind Potter. Draco bumped into the door a little harder than what was needed. When was the last time he had this much fun? "Potter!" Draco shouted at the thin wooden door.
In the quiet of the night, after making sure he wasn't being followed, he would find his way to the Room of Hidden Things. The work on the cabinet was going slower than he was hoping for, but he would make enough progress to give his Lord something. An excuse for his failure.
Potter started to pull at his pajama sleeve, but kept his eyes steady on Draco. "I wasn't fair before," he started, "I'm so sorry. I was just… so mad at you, but also everyone. And I took it out on you, but you don't deserve that."
Pansy then impersonated the only person at the table who, was in fact, infatuated with Harry Potter. "Oh Potter! Sit next to me! Sit next to me with your stupid, wonderful hair and your stupid green eyes-"
"Now, if I may, I must be going," Draco excused himself. Keeping his shoulders proud as he walked to the door. Severus held his gaze before he stepped away from the door, letting Draco by.
"I was his snake," Potter shared, "His snake attacked Mr. Weasley, and I saw the attack happen through his snake."
He wasn't destined to look down on earth, he wasn't even destined to look up to the stars. He was only meant to keep his gaze here on the ground.
Draco tried to catch the blood from his nose, the copper taste on his tongue as he breathed through his mouth. Weasley stared at him as Potter pulled him away.
Potter didn't say anything. His silence was enough of an answer. Draco instantly regretted this complication in their relationship, some things were better not spoken about. There had to be a way out, Draco could bend this situation to his needs.
"Sorry, I'm sorry," he croaked, he felt a soreness in his throat that wasn't there when he went to bed. The arms around him loosened, Draco  sank to the cold floor, his back  against a bed. Goyle moved in front of him, though  he was careful to keep his distance, "You okay, mate?" he asked.
Draco was given distance after his betrothal. No one had tried to comfort him, or talk to him about the role he was being forced to take. He was being forced into this, just as Daphne. Why didn't she recognized this?
Myrtle kept talking. Maybe she doesn't get to talk to anyone often. Draco couldn't remember the last he had on honest conversation with anyone. "For other ghosts, they had to hang on to something. For me…I just wasn't ready to leave."
The ghost looked down at him, her toes an inch from the ground as she floated with ease. She was wearing a Hogwarts uniform. She was  about the same age as Alfie, or she looked like she was, anyway. Draco thought back to where he was, what floor he was on. In his need to wrap himself in his terror, he just found the most private room he could. "You're Moaning Myrtle," he concluded.
“I...how...” Potter struggled for words before he reached out for Draco. His hand hovering over his left arm. Potter hesitated, and Draco's heart sunk into his stomach.
They sat on Draco's large bed about a foot apart. Draco folded his hands in his lap, feeling out of touch within his own body.
"And what do you think now?" Potter stood close to him, closer than ever. Potter was seeing him for what he was, and he wasn't disgusted. His eyes stared into Draco's, Draco noticed for the first time that they were almost the same height.
Blaise turned to his bed and Draco drew back his bed curtains, ready for this night to be over. Just as he was about to put his charm up, Blaise pulled apart his curtains.
Potter smiles. Harry Potter smiles at me, Draco Lucius Malfoy. I'm shocked stupid as I stare at his teeth with their slightly crooked canines.
The feeling of rebirth rampant throughout the Alley feels stale and moldy to me, aware that I'm undeserving and unwelcome. I slip through the crowd, darting through tight spaces, grateful for my small, easily unnoticed body. Covered head to toe in a cloak spelled to be oversized, I am indistinguishable from any other witch or wizard.
"What I was getting at, is that Tasha is a valuable animal and you'd be losing money by just giving her away. Why don't we...come to an agreement, yeah?"
I end up buying both a tube and a bus pass despite my hesitancy towards the bus. You hear all sorts of stories about the Wizarding Night Bus; I was nervous about what I might encounter and the safety of a Muggle run bus. The great lumbering machines looked docile going down the road and the people waiting on benches and exiting the machines looked calm enough.
Last week I ordered a new stove and it arrived this morning, leaving me to the task of moving the two-ton solid-iron monster from Salazar knows what century out of the house or at least to the attic.
My wank a few days ago has plagued me, constantly showing up regardless of what I'm doing and trying to distract myself is pointless. Draco stripping is the last thing I need feeding this growing bonfire of obsession.
The warmth in my chest spreads until I can't help smiling at her, "Thank you, 'Mione. And I doubt Draco's gay so nothing will probably come of this. But I accidentally invited him out to eat and I'm not sure what to do besides panic."
She hisses excitedly, tongue flicking wildly as she scents the air. Her scales are warm from her heat rocks and still smooth- her shed’s still a long way away.
"Could you pick me up? My magic's usually tired after all day there. I really don't want to splinch myself, I've heard it's quite bad." Draco laughs softly.
Three months after surviving a war, I was two knuts shy of a galleon. I would have to be to come to the bloody Savior of the Wizarding World, the boy who lived twice. But seeing no other option, a Slytherin will do as they must.
She waves her hands, "Oh no, no, love. This isn't that kind of place. We're family owned and operated. Hands on is the only way to test the fit!"
He follows me into the living room and immediately spots the terrarium, "Did you have trouble setting it up? What about the daytime bulb?"
My apartment has been cleaned spotless and the nervous energy rushing through my veins has yet to cease.
"I just returned her back to her body." His eyes are still covered and my face is on fire. I fold my arms over my chest.
I fumble with my card and the people waiting to exit the death machine radiate annoyance. Once the fee is paid, I practically run from the bus and to a shop to buy a map.
We're sat at a booth, directly across from one another and Draco is biting his lips, wide eyes panning around the restaurant in curiosity. A lamp hangs over the table and the booths, the floor, the walls are all rich and vibrant in a way that makes me rethink my style choices for Grimmauld.
"OH MY LO- DRACO!" I look up to see Tammy running over, and it's like a time spell was cast as she slips over the coffee on the floor and crashes into me.
His tears make something inside me drop and I lean forward, reaching out a hand to catch one of his, "I just mean, does it really matter what the press thinks? They'll say what they want, but your actions
"Thank Harry, he brought them. Perhaps you want to see the snakes first? A wonderful Blue Grass Viper just came in, it has the most wonderful white glow. It's not very tame though despite Harry's efforts."
"I don't want to talk about it," Draco grumbles, trying to smooth his clothes down. Tasha is settled over his shoulders, her head hanging down his back, and she lifts her head to hiss at me.
The machine makes an angry, steam-filled noise. I find the correct lever and pull hard, hot liquid jetting out and- knocking the cup over. Hot liquid splashes all over my stomach and I yell, jumping away as the machine still shoots liquid out. The Muggle swears loudly behind me, "Need help, mate?"
"I don't want to hold any grudges. The war is over and Draco isn't in Azkaban. All the deserving Death Eaters have been punished. He's on his own and clearly doesn't want charity. He just seemed...different Hermione."
Thinking of the sometimes messy duties of house elves, I decided to not wear a button down but a somewhat shabby dress robe that used to be beautiful. The fabric had lost some of its sheen and the crystals that used to swirl down the dark sleeves have mostly fallen off.
I fish the address from a pocket inside the robe and begin the trial of deciphering the muggle address system.
The cats laid out on my bed asleep, shedding it's black hair all over my silk pillow and blissfully unaware of the churning doubt inside of me. It's been a constant presence in the apartment and besides for the mystery of the empty litter box the cat is halfway decent. Most of the time it's sleeping, completely ignoring me even as I bleached the apartment in a manic cleaning spree.
"Hermione," I say, crossing my arms over my worn out quidditch jersey that has gotten rather tight in the years since I was on the team. It's so comfortable though in cold weather because of the heating charms interwoven in the fabric.
Potter is standing underneath the tree, a small brown bird perched on his head, scattering food from a large bucket. Owls of all sorts swoop down and get their fill of the feed, predatory owls chasing mice that scramble to the tree roots.
She croaks out a distorted hoot and lifts her leg once more for Potter to hold with his own manly fingers.
I laugh out loud. "Draco, you can get a bus pass and you won't have to Apparate anywhere. And the tube is an underground train. Similar to the Hogwarts Express but underground."
With the feelings rising up in my chest like the dawn, sunshine and warmth seeping into my veins, I groaned silently to myself.
"Looks good," I say and Hermione agrees, leaning over to give Ron a peck on the cheek. Ron's cooking has gotten leaps and bounds better than it had been now that he has to cook it himself and seeing the mouthwatering dish I believe Ron inherited Mrs. Weasley’s talent.
That eagle owl swoops down and snatches up a white rat, bringing back memories of my own owl. I lost Hyperion a few weeks before the Yule Ball Fourth Year. Some Gryffindors cursed him after I sent him off with a letter, I could see them below on the castle grounds but couldn't tell who they were besides them being older. Father gifted me Tasha soon after, but I still missed the large owl.
My trousers a puddle on the floor, I shiver and stick my hand into the water to test the temperature. With a groan, I wait another minute before the water has had enough time to wake up, freezing my cock off in the drafty room.
Aside from the stacks of boards, tile, and gallons of paint, it seems alright. Maybe a bit too comfortable by Malfoy standards, but alright.
After leaving the Leaky I dropped by Luna's, then the Daily Profit to make sure Skeeter isn't up to her old tricks, which thankfully she wasn't. George's store was next and I helped Ron sort out a box of living love letters (They were god awful. Kept nattering on about handsome boys and squealing.)
I find myself alone, my stomach still growling, so I go back to the counter and reach into the pastry bag for another scone. A Stasis charm must have been cast over the bag as the pastry was still warm and soft.
Reparations from the selling of Pureblood estates and properties as well as vaults were more than enough to rebuild and pay the survivors. The Order and all that helped fight, including all creatures and students at the Battle of Hogwarts, were paid ungodly amounts. The sheer fortune of the fallen Pure Bloods accumulated from the centuries was mind boggling.
I eventually still and stare blankly up at the high ceiling for a moment, before I haul myself up. I look dazedly at my cum on the clean sheets then spell it away wandlessly and fall back to the pillows.
The giant rat like creature seems to be entirely Muggle, yet Luna claims it exudes calming magic as it gets along with practically any other animal. I have experienced nothing of the sort, my heart in my throat and hands shaking with nerves upon hearing Potter's voice.
I realize what he's not speaking about and cut in softly, "And no matter what you'll always be a Death Eater."
The front door appears perfectly fine and when I reach out with my magic I feel no-one trespassing. I feel nothing but an agitated buzz.
A large eagle owl swoops down to me, landing on the ground at my feet to hoot loudly, which stirs some of the others.
I don't want to let go of Draco's cool hand when we land in the alley of a vacant building. He makes the desicion for me, tucking his hands into his pocket for warmth as the freezing mist drizzles down.
I hurry up to the door, wanting to hold Tasha, to curl up and let her gentle hissing calm me like she had done so many times in the past. Always at my side, distracting me from the screams echoing through the Manor, cheering my spirits and making me continue on. Calming like a rumbly voice and warm hands.
I duck my head, glasses knocking sideways, and Tasha turns to stone. Her muscled body clenches around my shoulders and arm, her head hovering, unmoving.
off." He explains and shoves a bite into his mouth and hums a moment before speaking, his mouth still full, "'Mm not really sure how this is s'posed to taste, honestly, but it's pretty good."
I could just tell him I’ve completed my research. He'll believe me. He has no reason to believe anything else.
"Don't piss on my things," I huff as I close and then lock my door, trapping the creature inside to lay havoc to my possessions. I turn and give it a stern look before throwing my over-sized hood over my head and Apparating from the security of my apartment to Diagon Alley.
?" My face screws up and I realize I’ve yet to right my tilted glasses. Luna smiles serenely and holds Tasha close to her, "Her bodies here but her mind's not. Something must have come up and she with whoever she's bonded to."
him. Despite how totally wrong it is of me. I don't deserve him. Or his misplaced kindness. I'm a wreck, a ruined boy with no family or prospects.
I want to wrap up in my blankets with the comforting presence of my snake and sleep for a year. I'm so tired of everything. My cold apartment, my shoddy meals, the constant struggle of living. I just want a bloody job. I want to feel the ground underneath my feet, grounded instead of free falling.
Stepping into the hot water was what muggles call heaven. I had to concentrate to remain standing or else I might melt into a puddle and slip down the gurgling drain.
I pop out in the Leaky and it's dead, being midday on a Thursday. I order a butterbeer from the bartender to distract myself from thoughts of Draco.
It was only when I saw the new shop I reconnected with her, if she hadn't opened her shop I might not have seen her again. Reconnecting is just by chance with no one knowing each other’s new addresses, the Ministry still regrouping, and many moving to other countries to start over.
I run my hands over my face with a breathy sigh, imagining his warm breath and big hands. All over me. Touching me.
Another chapter! This took longer than I would have liked, but I had to decide where I wanted the plot to go :)
"Has she been eating?" I ask Potter, going to sit on the sofa and my eyes fly wide at the steaming dishes resting on the coffee table. It smells
Or while I lick the water droplets off of him, greedily tracing my fingers over his prominent V muscles until they met the soft white towel.
I shrug off the strange desire and sit back, "Don't apologize. You had reason both times and you did leave Tasha with me which more than makes up for it."
I take sigh deeply, shoving all my Draco related thoughts from my head before Flooing over to the station Ron and Hermione use, occasionally passing someone on the windy street, cold biting at my cheeks. At their apartment I push the button to call them and Hermione picks up,
"Alright," I repeat, my own lips twitching, "I'll have to look into pricing more, but I'll leave her with you and come back...sometime next week."
He shakes his head hard and his hair, longer than I had ever seen it, untucks from his ears and frames his face. "My new flat is a nightmare compared to this."
Hermione hops up and gives me a short hug, her loosened, wild bush of hair attacking my face. "How did things go at Luna's with Malfoy there?"
So that was chapter 12 and the 'date' still isn't over! How does Draco end up so drunk and what happens next hmmmm. You'll only have to wait 6 more months lollll
Harry to talking to Luna still and to my delight, he has Tasha with him, curiously slithering over the counter and scenting the air.
"That's good, Harry, that you helped him get a job." Ron mutters, looking to Hermione who gives him a pleased look.
I close the bathroom door behind me and face the gutted, plastic covered room. It was a huge bathroom with a high ceiling and beautiful grey stone bath that was inlaid in the floor. The whole side with the sink area has a golden hued, decades old beveled mirror with little cherubs along the edges. It had personality and would be a pain to move, so Hermione and I decided to design the room to match it.
Three minutes later the bus rumbles up and stops. People line up to file on and I get my bus card and address ready.
"I thought it meant cleaning!" He shouts, staring at his shoes in mortification. I dust myself off to distract myself from the warmth at my crotch and awkwardly nod along.
We joked around maybe an hour before the topic of Slytherin's, in particular Draco, were brought up.
Deciding honesty would be best, I say, "No, it's quite alright. I just overprepared as I tend to do. I just really want this job."
"Alright, I’ll get you food!" I exclaim to the owls with a laugh as the tree seems to wake up at the sound of my voice. I go back in and start preparing the owls breakfast, filled with more energy and excitement than I usually do while spending the morning at Luna's.
He seems embarrassed, flushing red the longer he sits. A Malfoy in a Muggle apartment? Ron will be shocked.
Hermione sets her empty cup of tea on the table and surveys the stacks of magazines, tape, and boards labeled things like, 'Upstairs bedroom to the left' and 'Half bath to linen closet'.
Hollowly, I nod and take a seat on a stool, carpet bag pressed tight to my hollowed-out chest. Potter rearranges Tasha and goes about making tea both wandlessly and wordlessly.
I find myself smiling, tuning out the witches and wizards in the shop and listening to Luna's overview of all the creatures.
"Did you not think I heard you the first time you utter dolt? I don't want you to have my bloody snake!"
With a sigh I kick my robes underneath the bed and toe off my shoes, limping sock-footed across the freezing floor to the bathroom. My ankle stings sharply with each step. I'll have to cast a warming charm on it or wrap it with something for stability.
"Erm- it's this way," I say, a touch awkwardly. Draco silently nods, following me out of the Apparation point and into Muggle London.
I sigh and plonk down onto the sofa, hands scrubbing down my face and my 5 o'clock shadow scratches my palms.
Blankets Mrs. Weasley knitted are piled up on the couch. I grab an armful of them and toss them into the hall closet before scanning the living room for any other easily solved mess.
Potter freezes in surprise before a goofy grin appears, "I'm not sure if I should be insulted or not. Draco...are you drunk?"
I nod and stand up, "Do you want something to eat for lunch? I can't promise I'm any better than you, but I know the basics."
I shrug my robe off onto the ground and root through the piled-up clothes and blankets on my bed for a warm jumper, which I slip over my head. The sleeves come down over my hands and the hem hits my mid-thighs, but I can't make myself resize it even if I look like a house elf.
I make it to Ollivander’s old building unscathed and I pause a moment to take in the beautifully reworked exterior. The twin bay windows are bright and the stone is polished, fantastic birds sit in the large windows on each side of the door and the sign simply declares
The image of a shirtless Harry, dripping water in a towel is just what I need burned into my memory. His rich tan skin and dark chest hair shined with drops of water like some sort of erotic painting, a study in contrasts against the pristine towel. Or potentially my hand splayed across his broad chest.
I shake the bag, "Yeah, plus some. I wasn't sure what Draco would want so I got one of just about everything."
"'ve you never rode a bus 'fore, lad? That's not how these things work." He snorts and jabs a meaty finger to the seat right behind him, "Sit there."
"I like having her here. The only other people that stop by are Ron and Hermione, so it's nice to have the company. I was actually thinking of getting a kneazle or maybe another owl."
He nearly jumped out of his skin whenever he felt something brush his leg. The hideous cat from before was staring up at him. He hissed at the creature, who licked their lips with a tilt of their head. He tried to shoo the cat away, but the thing just sat down, staring up at him with their beady, ugly eyes.
I hear that your studies are going well. You have always rose to the expectations we have set for you. This winter be prepared to rise above even our sights to be the man you're expected to be.
Being constantly surrounded by those who only wish to do Potter harm had forced Draco to face how dangerous this situation was. A constant twisting had settled into his chest. Draco wasn't privy to the inner workings of the web. His Lord hadn't even made an appearance at Draco's betrothal. Gaining information in that house was trying to theorize how dust would settle biased on air patterns.
Draco gave him a reassuring smile. He was met with a tired smile back, but Potter was standing so close.
"You'll figure it out eventually," Draco said playfully. He had put out his cigarette and was rinsing out the sink.
Draco entered the Room of Hidden Things. He had arrived early, as he couldn't sleep. He was surprised to find Potter already there. Potter rose from the couch that was placed in front of the fireplace. He was dressed in Muggle jeans and a simple green jumper that brought out his eyes. Draco was also in day robes, pajamas seemed too intimate for what they were about to do.
Idiot. Why would Tonks make a move to attack now? Of course she was only concerned for the  bleeding child and here Draco was acting like he expected to be attacked the second his back was turned. “I don’t need help from a blood traitor, keep your help to yourself,” Draco tried to cover his previous display.
The sight of Daphne's death, her body after, twisting and coiling unnaturally in death from his hand, was laced behind his eyelids.
Potter was sitting in his usual spot, across from his friends. What Draco wasn't expecting, was Potter to be looking right at him. Draco broke his gaze quickly with a blush. He glanced up again after a moment, Potter was still looking at him. Draco could feel his stomach turn. He returned Potter's gaze coolly.
This was how most of the conversations had gone with Zabini as of late. Draco did his best to allow him to talk as little as possible, assuming the dark skinned student was trying to handle the rise of the Dark Lord and how this affect him and his mother as best he can. Zabini was in a very unique position, his only friends were children of Death Eaters, however, his mother was only recently introduced to the Malfoy's social circle four years ago by her late husband. The shift in social atmosphere had changed since then, as well as the treatment of the Zabinis by their "friends."
Daphne's eyes showed the fire within her as she glared at Draco. Daring him to speak against her, daring him to lecture her on the dangers for the both of them. Not aware that this was exactly what Draco wanted.
Could Draco face his Lord? Open his mind to him while guarding his heart, his soul? Would his Lord smell his betrayal on him, kill him, his family? Would he be forced to shoulder his father's mistakes?
What would he do? What could he do? Every option he had, every corner he turned, was filled with danger that threatened his life.
Send my regards to Ms. Parkinson for her lost, my thoughts are with her during this struggle and the ones upcoming.
He would be returning to the manor soon. He would return to an angry lord in light of his father's failure. Would he be killed to pay for his father's mistakes? Would he be tortured? The Dark Lord did favor Draco, slightly, there was a slimmer of something similar to hope.
He open his eyes, trying to ground himself, to see Potter. He was with his friends, standing in the front of the crowd. Funny how Potter was always where Draco didn't want him. He had his arms crossed against his chest, clearly disapproved. He glanced at Draco, their eyes locked. Potter looked almost disappointed…in him? Draco was taken back to a simple room with simple company; laughter, concerned looks, a relationship in the new.
I hoped you liked it! This is a bit different than my usual style. I would love to hear from y'all! Just a heads up, the next chapter is the last one for this story, but not the last in the series.
"How?" Draco asked innocently. His eyes wide in pretend shock. He watched as Daphne's mind worked through her options, she would come to the same conclusion as Draco. He was sure.
Dumbledore continued, "Perhaps deep down you want someone to hurt you, as a way to make up for your sins."
If they were going to work together, if Draco was going to keep his promise to Daphne, he had to earn Astoria's trust. She watched as Draco pulled a lighter from his pocket. He help the zippo lighter in front of him. Astoria steadied her gaze on her sister's lighter. She stepped forward, snatching the lighter out of his hand. He let her, he blinked as blood leaked into his eyes. He focused on her instead of the swaying ground.
The two shared a new look between them. "We should probably go, it's getting late," he murmured. They rose from their chairs, stretching from sitting too long, their bones tired and warm from the fire.
Draco's mind was ripped to shreds by the pain, but he focused on the pain. He let the pain consume his mind, his walls were only strengthen by the focus point.
Daphne had seen firsthand what his family, what his father, was like. How cruel they could be in their tempers. Draco couldn't even warn her at this point, she knew. She knew what she was marrying into. The distance between them had only grown. Draco hadn't yet been able to comfort her.
Bones went to cast a spell but she wasn't as practiced as him. He had her wand out of her hand quickly.
His mother wouldn't even look at him after the betrothal ceremony. His father kept his gaze steadily cool as if daring Draco to challenge his authority further. Severus was there that day, standing next to Father. Severus wore dark navy robes instead of his usual black, Draco had never seen him wear color before. Severus offered no comfort, not even a nod in Draco's direction.
Astoria shook her head before walking away from the Great Hall. He followed at a distance. She didn't need to get involved in his school trouble, not any more than she was.
Draco sat up, his arm touching Potter's, who didn't move away. "Yeah, actually," he lied, "she, um, asked me, and I said yes."
"Like I told the others, I was going to the library to study. I was thrown into the air then attacked with fire. I heard shouting from down the hall and a wall of darkness appeared in front of me. I didn't see anyone's face as I had hit my head and was currently burning alive," he repeated his lie.
Draco opened the note. It was on the same piece of parchment they had used to pass messages to each other. Now, there was an unflattering drawing of Draco sleeping on his desk. Draco hoped Potter was going to choose a different career direction. In the picture, Draco was drooling and snoring in his sleep. A very inaccurate description. The only reason he suspected the drawing was of himself and not, say, Weasley, was the title of the artful rendition:
On the train. In the halls. The classroom. Eyes followed his movements. Careful smiles met him everywhere he went. Circling him, waiting for something he couldn't guess. Wolves stalking their prey, while remaining hidden in the trees.
"It's nice to see a wizard finally get his hands dirty, usually they leave that part of the job to me," Greyback admitted.
"You want me to believe that you didn't put the training you've received over the summer to good use?" Draco's stomach twisted with how casually Severus could mention his time at the manor.
Pansy met his eyes, standing stiffly next to her mother. Pansy's hair was styled in a bun at the base of her skull, and there was so much makeup on her face she could easily pass for twenty. Her waist was tightened in a dark purple dress, the color brought out her pale complexion. Her eyes were wide with fear, her neck red with force as she fought back her tears.
Montague opened his mouth, then closed it. His face was red, he was constantly shifting his feet. He had lost before the fight even started. Draco was slightly disappointed, this was almost too easy.
"Because she's Pansy," Draco supplied. Their laughter was cut off by a familiar voice from behind Draco.
There was no possible way Draco could ever confide in a fellow Slytherin student, even if they would be the ones to most understand. No, they had their own families to serve and protect. Draco knew, without a doubt, that their acquaintanceship could only go so far. It was an understanding throughout most of the house. Please, don’t give me any information I can use against you, because then I would have to.
Thank you for everyone who left comments and kudos to let me know how much they cared about this story, that is always super encouraging.
Lucius pinched his lips tightly. He was coiled in on himself with the constant pressure that comes with being a Death Eater. The pressure of attending the funeral of a child that your own child had killed. The pressure of reaching for an attainable goal. He was about to break.
He hadn’t know that he could feel like this. Potter's lips moved against his. Draco hesitantly followed. He wanted this, he wanted more. He never understood why everyone was so focused on this. Here, with Potter's mouth on his, everything made sense. He couldn't stop if he wanted to.
Theo and Draco quickly moved out of range whenever Pansy climbed over the table, pushing Daphne to the floor. Students stood up, gathering around the fight tightly.
Draco pinched his lips together, this would be the best answer he would get tonight, but he didn't like the unpredictability.
The two giggled at the memory. The reminder of what they were here for sobering them out of their smiles. "She aced the practical later though," Lupin confided.
Tears slipped down Draco's cheeks from laughing. When he moved to wipe them, Potter reached out, still giggling, and brushed them away. He paused, his eyes searching Draco's face, "What do we do now?" Potter asked, his fingertips still against Draco's face.
This doesn’t mean that Draco approved of Potter's actions. Such as throwing a spell back at Snape during the first class of the year.
"Yes, I am, but not without reason," Draco agreed easily, "but recently I've stopped fighting with you publicly-"
“Besides,” Draco continued awkwardly, “you did call Umbridge a frog faced-bitch. Anyone would be nice to you after that.”
They walked out of the Common Room and into the halls of the dungeons. "She needs a friend," Daphne explained.
"I know that, obviously I know that, Draco," Potter snapped. Draco stayed quiet. He didn’t know how to make this better. Maybe Potter would be better off he didn’t have to worry about Draco. "I'm sorry," Potter signed, "Draco, I just…after Sirius, I just don't want anyone else to die for me. And when I didn’t hear anything from you over the summer-"
Draco felt Potter's hand on his arm. He forced himself not to tremble under his touch. Thankfully, Potter let him go.
He was about to step into a war field. He was about to fight his parents. His father, at least. Why else would his father have studies over prophecies? There was so much Draco didn't know. Yet he was walking into a trap. He knew this was a trap. What if someone recognized him?
"There's a girl," Draco started, "I think you should take her in." Potter was silent, but he was listening. "She already knows about the DA, I'm not sure how she found out, but… she knows and she hasn't told anyone yet," Draco explained. "She's good, smart, she would fit into the DA easily," he finished.
Lovegood and Potter started on the barricade. Draco ordered the others to hide. They only had seconds.
A gentle hand on Draco's jaw caused him to flinch slightly. "You're bleeding," Potter whispered. Draco licked his bottom lip, he was bleeding from getting punched earlier. Potter's eyes followed the motion, Draco's neck warmed. He brought his hand to his lip, whipping the blood away slowly. Potter's tongue flicked across his lip as he watched the motion before returning Draco's gaze.
Daphne would want to distance herself from him soon. He couldn't really blame her, he wouldn't want to marry himself. How could he expect her to? He couldn't. She would be unpredictable until he had her in his grasp. She would need an act of rebellion, Draco was determined to not face the consequences of her actions.
Draco had put in some effort not to rush after Potter like some love sick girl, which he wasn't, no matter how much he rushed.
The hours continued as they finalized their essays. Astoria's friends filed to bed after saying good night. Only the three of  them remained until Theo sheepishly took an empty seat. They tackled the atrocity that was Theo's homework together. Draco ignored when Theo suddenly got quiet as Blaise walked in with Bulstrode. For the last couple of weeks, Draco has noticed a lack of sneaking around from those two, but didn't want to say anything. The pair sat at the empty couch by the fireplace, they talked quietly between themselves. The common room was wonderfully quiet for once. The only other students were a couple of second years including Alfie, and Crabbe and Goyle who were playing a game of chess.
She didn't get the chance. Draco's mother gently interrupted, "If you'll excuse us, we have yet to pay our condolences to the grieving couple."
His mother was there, told him to dress and meet her outside. He did as he was told. She had apparated them to one of their unused properties in the country.
Montague shouldn't be a problem, Draco had shown what would happen if Montague crossed him again. Draco wondered how many other Slytherin students share Montague's distaste for Draco. Was Draco public humiliation enough to keep his standing at Hogwarts? He might be making more enemies than allies. Allies were necessary, even in the superficial sense.
Draco's own hands were clammy as he swallowed his own guilt. Daphne was silent across from him, also looking down. "You must want to talk about it, no one is talking about it!" Cho was sobbing now, her voice raw.
He was gasping when he arrived at the lavatory; thankfully he was alone, his footsteps  the only sounds besides his gasps. Draco wrapped his cloaked tighter around himself over his sleepwear. His sweat had  dried and was now sticky against him, but he still couldn't get warm. Draco pressed his palms against the cool, smooth sink, using the shock of the cold porcelain  to ground himself.
He should tell Potter how much he missed him. Tell him how Draco counted the days until he could simply glance at him. Tell him how he has kept all of the notes passed between them. Tell him how he has kept a clipping for Potter from the Daily Profit from the tournament last year that makes him seem handsome. Tell him how scared Draco is for him. Tell him of all the dangers that wait for Potter, damn the consequences. Tell him that Draco hopes more than anything that teaching Potter Occlumency will be enough to help Potter win this war that is coming from all sides.
Draco  lit the smoke with practiced ease, inhaling the warmth into his lungs. The focus of the routine  allowed his hands to stop shaking.
"Yes, I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about either," Draco warned coldly, giving her his sharp grey eyes.
Draco sat in his usual spot in the soft grass. His side felt cold with Daphne's absence. He took his notes and books out of his bag as the other students filed into the classroom. He couldn't find his textbook.
They went over the almost rehearsed safe topics of conversation. Draco was only paying half attention has he twistedly enjoyed the cluster fuck that was Potter's date, with Daphne obviously eavesdropping as well. He winced at Cho attempt to make Potter jealous, which Daphne pointedly looked at Draco for.
Draco continued his relaxed, casual pose. He was doing his best to make Potter feel at ease. “Potter, I need to know, please don’t make this difficult,” Draco begged, keeping his hands on the sink behind him, gripping the edge in nervousness. He made himself seem more vulnerable that he was, he needed Potter to trust him to some small degree.
He entered the sea of mourners - all dressed uniformly in black out of respect for the dead. People hiding their sobs echoed around him. He entered a room of people with heavy hearts for the dead as an unknown murder. He was unable to cry because if he did, his own heart would shatter, the pieces piercing his lungs. He would drown in his own blood.
Daphne was sitting with Cho Chang, she didn't even look up from her book as he passed by her. Draco took a seat next to Theo.
He shouldn't laugh, he really shouldn't. The situation is not one to laugh at. He did anyway. Potter started to laugh gently too.
Draco held his wand. His mind was surprisingly clear as Potter looked down at the prophecy. He was about to give the order to attack.
"Harry, I- you didn't misread anything," Draco's cheeks flushed. "I just- I do have feelings for you, I think they're pretty apparent. Everything is just so…complicated."
The meal changed. The meal he ate at the Weasleys appeared. Boxes of the cheap chocolates that Potter bought for him for Valentine's Day stacked in the center. The too sweet tea from him and Daphne's singular date steamed in teapots.
The other three were frozen under a jinx on the floor. Forgotten. Two Death Eaters now circled Draco, who was only able to rise to his knees with the force of the blows thrown at him.
Weasley two months ago and Granger in third year. Draco didn't answer, but just shrugged as he leaned against the brick of the manor. Greyback paced as he smoked, the conversation flowing easily between them.
Draco smiled at his name, the man was complimenting him. He followed the smoke billow from the man's lips.
Watching Potter last night, so afraid for him, made him hurt down to his gut. He was so useless, he wish he could make all of this go away, but he wasn't even able to keep himself out of trouble. Why had Dumbledore stop training Potter? His abilities certainly weren't in question. Potter was more than capable, even more important, he was willing. Potter would follow Dumbledore anywhere without argument. It didn't make sense.
Draco's anger was in the form of an ice pick in his heart. "Father," he stated coolly. All three adults turned to the forgotten child. "We are at a funeral," he reminded his father, "remember your manners."
Sure, finding out that Snape was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor was probably a punch to the gut. And, Potter was probably a little jaded at Draco's rejection last night. Also, Potter was being hunted by the Dark Lord, was criminalized by the media and so on so on… Potter had a lot to make him angry, Draco knew this, Draco accepted this.
"What chapter summaries?" mumbled Daphne, her eyes  unseeing has she stared down at the same page of the same book as she had been for the last half hour.
"Past tense? Darling, you have been, will be, and currently are infatuated with Harry Potter," Pansy grinned teasingly.
His stomach growled in hunger after many hours working on the cabinet. He had made progress, that would have to be enough for today. He hid his notes before leaving the room.
Draco could feel the coil of hatred he had for that man tighten a little bit more. "I'll think about it. I promise."
“Mr. Malfoy…Malfoy?” Flitwick was standing in front of Draco's desk, having notice Draco's tardiness. Draco paused, unsure if he was about to be scowled.
He was already close enough that Granger, Weasley and Potter had all turned to him. He should say something, something clever, something that would tell Potter he needed to speak to him in private.
Draco's temper cooled in his stomach, danger in his words. "You're the only one who knows where my true loyalties lie," he whispered. Saying the words made them true. Telling someone else could get you killed. Daphne's shoulders drop at his words, feeling the weight of his trust. Her temper left her then, as quickly as it came. She didn't know what to do. Draco was trusting her with his life, betrayal is death.
She turned back to glare at Draco, her words doing lasting damage. "I can't even recognize you," she hissed.
Draco nodded, "Yes, thankfully my father managed to use his influence at the Ministry to intervein before a student was hurt."
A hand laid on his shoulder. He held the crimson eyes of the Dark Lord, "You will have your time. Your time to prove yourself."
They seemed to be whispering among themselves. This wasn't the best time to talk to Potter, he should just walk by and not draw any attention to himself.
Parents started to wave at the train as the wheels gently started to turn. His parents never had waved at him when he was leaving for school, but they always sent chocolates ahead of time. The box of chocolates were always wrapped in silver paper. Even though Draco knew what was wrapped in the box, he was always warmed by the touch.
"Class dismissed. Mr. Malfoy, would you mind staying after class? Mr. Potter wait outside if you don't mind," Professor Firenze called to him.
Draco walked around the couch to take his seat next to Potter, allowing himself to sit comfortably close to Potter. "Someone has taken notice about my nightly outings, I just have to be more careful, that's all," he explained.
Cedric, his cold body, being gripped by Potter. Potter…weeping, publicly begging for anyone to believe him. His body curling over his wails as he clenched Cedric's body.
Draco was surprised when he had entered the room to find the most hideous feline creature he had seen in his life. The creature was sitting in front of the fire, basking in the warmth. Whenever Draco had allowed himself to enter, assuming the room was empty, the creature simply blinked at him before going back to sleep. The feline appeared to be thoroughly domesticated.
Draco took his seat. Crabbe and Goyle pointedly looked down at their plates, not commenting on the blood that was still flowing from Draco's face onto his shirt. Daphne didn't look up from her copy of the Profit. Theo snorted. With a roll of his eyes Blaise snapped his wand to heal Draco's nose.
Draco tried to step away, only to be pushed back into the wall by Pansy. "Some of us have to gravel. Some of us have to leech and claw our way into his good graces, not all of us have a birthright. Not all of us have a breathing father who can protected us from his cruelty," she lectured.
Draco didn't know what to do, and with a shared look from Daphne, he saw that neither did she. The alliance with the Zabini's was unclear. Draco could suppose that Mrs. Zabini would be wise to stay away from connections with Death Eaters, but this had thrown her and her son out of their social circle. Everyone was giving Blaise the cold shoulder in response, waiting to see how this played out.
Draco gasped. He gripped Pansy's wrist, his knuckles white. His heart beating loudly in his chest. Everything seemed distant, he couldn't hear the professor, all he could hear was his own thundering heartbeat.
"Oh, you mean my assignment to kill you?" Draco confirmed nonchalantly. "Did Severus happen to mention that?"
She nodded briskly, her jaw tensing. "Good, you have a very strong defense. We just need to strengthen it."
"Parkinson, let us not have a repeat of last semester, shall we?" Severus interjected. "Malfoy, perhaps you are more sure footed than Parkinson on a couple of stairs."
This, however, was not research covered in dusty old books about magic reconstruction and appliance. Draco was working with the very heart of this magic. The fluidity was an aspect he hadn't considered. This was a difficult task.
"We have to be better than our parents. They let this happen. They put him into power, or they were too passive to fight back," he murmured into her hair. "Daphne, if we don't fight him we are letting him win," he pleaded. He was still holding her, her head hiding in his neck, but she didn't pull away. They stayed there, Draco was ready to give her the time she needed.
"The name's Greyback," Draco took the hand offered to him. Greyback didn't seem to mind the blood on Draco's hand.
What did anyone have to win in this war? What did he have to gain? He was risking everything. How far was too far? What was he thinking? Promising Daphne that he would win this war when he was… no one. He was no one but the name that his father gave to him. No one but a status that wasn't a personality. No one but a child who killed in a desperate chance to save himself. He was a coward. And worst, he was a coward who could pick a side in this useless war.
The classroom returned to silence, with only the occasional choked chuckle. Draco had to refrain from stabbing himself in the stomach so he could be excused from class. Severus probably wouldn't let him go.
"Did you know that terror has a certain taste?" Greyback pushed himself off of the wall. "You'll be happy to know that she was fucking petrified when you sliced her throat."
His mind remains blank before Draco realizes what Potter is asking. "No, someone healed it up quickly," he answered.
Potter was so kind, saying that Draco was only a Death Eater by technicality. He knew better. He knew that whatever made his father into a Death Eater, was also in him. He was twisted in a way that Potter would recoil, retch at the idea of even touching Draco.
Draco stood, he was done with this line of questioning. "You wouldn't be meeting Death, you would be meeting me."
A particularly interesting footnote caught his eye. He frowned over the word, he doubted this was ever mention in his Defense Against the Dark Art classes. He sighed, realizing the chapter didn't mention his only promising lead again. He wrote
"Now I know you're just lying," Draco was shoving his books in his bag. He wasn't going to bother to put up the books he had taken out.
Potter faced him with a smile, "Hey sleepy," his body turned to face Draco. "Do you get any sleep at night? You're always asleep in class," he teased.
Footsteps hurried around the corner, followed by a gasp. Daphne pulled away from Draco as if she was burnt. Draco caught the glance of two recognizable green eyes.
Draco didn't budge, he needed his father to make the first move. The pair of them hadn't had a conversation in so long, Draco couldn't remember the last time they had talked alone.
Dumbledore's Army was supposed to meet soon. Yet, here he was, right in front of the Room of Hidden Things. He walked right by the location of the entrance. When he turned the corner, out of sight, the quick footsteps behind him made him laugh. Merlin, they were so painfully obvious. He was going to have to have a talk with Potter about being more discrete.
Draco founded Potter's hand. He shoved Potter into the room, throwing up spells in any direction to hit something, anything.
Draco arrived to the Room of Requirement almost an hour early, he couldn't help it. Potter's present had been carefully tucked underneath Draco's arm while he hurried down the darken quiet halls. Despite the unsettling silence of the hallways, Draco smile wouldn't leave his face. He was going to see Potter again, and soon, at Potter's suggestion.
He grabbed his bag before leaving the Common Room, keeping his head high, shoulders square. He could study in the library then wait for Potter in the Room of Hidden Things, he just needed to be alone. Draco made his way out of the Common Room, silence all around him, no one daring to gossip about Pansy with him within earshot. He hurried away from the entrance, his stomach turning. Almost running now, he turned the corner-
His father screams were louder than anything else in the room. Lucius hit the grown, cradling his broken knee that Draco had kicked out from underneath him.
Before any of that could come into place, Draco had to get this fucking cabinet to actually work. Mother always lectured that you cannot learn magic from reading, you must practice. 'A good wizard is the one that can actually cast the spell, my dear boy,' she would say if she was in a talkative mood after a couple glasses of wine. Draco thought back to his childhood, his early summers from Hogwarts, before his life got so twisted. He would always ask his mother to show him spells from her days of competitive dueling. He would love to show his father only when he perfected a spell under his mother's careful instruction. They hadn't done that since he was thirteen.
"The Dark Lord won't let up just because you're tired, Potter. I know I don't have to explain that to you."
"Yes, hello Professor," he entered the room, feeling uneasy. McGonagall always made him nervous, he wasn't sure why either.
The weeks passed. Students went to classes despite the overhang of war. Professors taught despite the knowledge of an oncoming battle that they couldn't prepare children for. Draco continued his planning despite the knowledge that someone in the castle wanted to hurt him very badly.
Draco reached out to Potter as he heard someone speak. "Ron!" Potter turned the corner of a large tank. Draco's heart burst from his chest as Potter rushed out of his sight. "Careless moron," Draco mumbled under his breath, his hands too full of Granger to pull his wand out.
"Headmaster Dumbledore adjusted the room more to my liking," their new Professor explained. "Do come in."
Draco's stomach twisted, his hands started to sweat as Potter walked over to him. Draco could sense his parents tense on either side of him. One wrong move, Draco would get all of them killed. "Potter," he ensured that no familiarity, no warmth, was in his voice. His face contorted into a sneer of displeasure.
"Step back," he ordered easily. Bulstrode stood, looking down at him before stepping back, but her glare still bore into his face.
"Is everything okay?" Potter asked, walking into the classroom. "I, uh, I was waiting for you outside…"
Severus tried to bait him by telling him about Potter's dip in his Pensieve. Potter and Severus were no longer continuing Occlumency lessons.
Plus, having an ally would be...nice. Having someone to confide in, even if it was simply a share of a common secret, would lessen the burden on Draco's shoulders. Having someone to talk to, someone without an ulterior motive, someone that Draco didn't have to constantly track and be three steps ahead. The experience of having a possible friendly ally would make Draco's life seem less lonely. Draco needed that. Badly.
Few students passed them, but everyone kept their eyes downcast. Curious, what rumors surrounded him now? Would other students try to take a stab at the Death Eater? Would he have to defend himself? Reach down to that dark side of himself that enjoyed the control that came with causing pain and indulge for a bit? If he wasn't careful, violence would become to him what a bad smoking habit became to Daphne.
Sorry for the late update. With my new job/schedule, I'm going to have to change how much I update to once a month instead of every other week. Hopefully, this will lead to longer chapters.
For the first time in months, he didn't need to worry about screams being heard from his basement. He didn’t need to cover his ears to block the torture taking place in his home. What remained of his home.
He hurried into the storage closet, pushing by the other students trying to do the same. Severus hadn't reached out to Draco since the night of Potter's outburst, but Draco new his godfather well enough to know when he was getting ready to strike. He quickly collected the ingredients necessary, milling around the other students. The small storage closet seemed extra crowded as Severus was standing in the doorway, observing from over his nose his eyes never leaving Draco.
"No! You know what position this puts me in! How could you be this stupid? We've talked about this Draco. You. Can't. Trust. Anyone." she lectured, as if he didn't know this already, like he wasn't painfully aware of how dangerous this was. He knew better than she did.
The official story was that Daphne drowned in the pound of the estate. Draco didn't know how they managed to convince the Ministry of a death without a body to prove the source.
After Daphne pulled away from the embrace, she took his hand to lead him to the entrance way. Her blond hair flowed behind her, her hand was gloved in pale yellow.
Parkinson sat next to Nott, directly across from Draco. She wasn't touching the food on her plate, simply staring into nothing, as if trying to slip into nothingness herself. Draco tried to catch her eye, but Pansy stayed still, almost looking through Draco. Draco reached out, he touch her translucent hand to bring her attention forward. "Try the lamb, it's your favorite," Draco urged. Pansy followed Draco's request wordlessly, not even bothering to put up the effort to reply.
"You should take this matter very seriously," Draco wasn't successful in leaving the mockery out of his tone, "I should hope a full investigation would take place."
"Nothing can come of this," Draco pointed out instead of answering the question Potter knew the answer to. Potter didn't pulled his hand away, only squeezed his hand. Draco flinched, his knuckles were bruised. Potter loosened his grip, running his thumb over his knuckles gently.
The sentence fully clicked in his mind. "Shit. That's not what I meant," Draco corrected, his face warming. "I wasn't going to play this year."
He swallowed passed the lump in his throat. He should do something for them, he has taken away so much already. "We will make the appropriate appearances, then we will be on our way," Draco offered. He ignored the surprise that flashed on everyone's faces. He wasn't the one to decide such matters. If his parents wanted to challenge him, he would make them bleed. This was the one mercy he could provide. He would be damned if he didn’t offer what little comfort he could.
Bulstrode was trying to grab Pansy's fist in feeble attempts, but Pansy was relentless, hitting her with closed fists again and again and again. It wasn’t long before her hands were covered in blood.
," Draco casted at Longbottom. Longbottom blinked awake. He gently sat up, he was guided by Potter's gentle hand.
He was frozen. He was frozen as she came to the bank of the tiny creek. He was frozen as Astoria picked up a rock and threw the stone at his head.
The table disappeared the containments of dinner, suppling a large bowl of warm water and a clean rag. Draco brought his hand up to the table. Potter rummaged through his bag, pulling out bandages and healing salves. "Why haven't you healed your hand yet? It'll take longer now," Potter lectured. Draco swallowed as Potter gently cleaned his hand. Potter's touch was light, as if Draco was made of glass.
"What? You know I'm right. Zabini was always around Bulstrode and Greenglass, horrid blood-traitors."
Potter turned, confused. Pansy crossed her arms, leaned against the table, an innocent smile on her mouth.
He looked like shit. The moonlight that shone  through the large windows  reflected against the pale tiles of the lavatory, giving Draco’s pale skin a sickly pallor as he looked in the mirror. There were bags under his eyes already turning  purple, serving only to emphasize  how thin he had gotten. Draco tried to think back to the last night he had gotten more than five hours of sleep, if he was lucky. He couldn't. Panic had taken its grip on him since last summer.
At the edge of the garden, along the wall that surrounded the grounds of the manor, a greenhouse was tucked away behind the rose bushes. The greenhouse hadn't been use in some time, the last time the tiny greenhouse had been used was before Draco was born. His great-grandmother had assembled the tiny shed. Lucius had refused to take it down out of an uncharacteristic sense of nostalgia.
This time, his mother didn't hesitate to reach right into his mind for his most recent memory. She pulled the memory from his mind with frightening accuracy.
Severus was keeping him in the dark. Draco suspected that whatever information Severus was keeping from him, and Potter by proxy, wasn't due to his own judgment. Dumbledore was the one in charge.
He left the small room, his legs shaking as he walked back to the Common Room, taking his time. He wasn't truly ready for whatever mess Pansy left for him.
Dinner was a lamb stew with bread, delicious, but not a delicacy. Draco allowed the conversation to continue without him, allowed his eyes to drift across the dining hall, past the ornate windows that led to the outdoors, his eyes fell on a dark skinned boy with unruly hair and green eyes.
Severus's eyes widen in realization at the situation. The panic was clear in his voice now as he ordered someone to get Madam Pomphrey.
"Perhaps you can't understand because the situation is too complicated for the likes of you," Draco snapped, standing to face Potter, his stomach turning.
'Where did you get this?' Potter wrote on the parchment between them, putting the container in his bag.
Potter let out a small giggle, he shifted, rubbing the back of his head, but he didn't step away. Draco could see Potter's dark skin warm under the comment. Potter bit his lip. "How very Gryffindor of you," Potter grinned.
"But how are we supposed to defend ourselves if we don't know what we are defending ourselves from?" Daphne argued.
"One," Draco put up one finger, "you found an old textbook that has detailed enough notes that you're actually good at potions."
He was just about the hex the pest when he heard footsteps coming forth. He strained to see who it was. The muggle girl, Mafalda, was creeping alone the wall. Passing Draco's hiding spot and poking her head around the corner. From there, she could observe the entrance of the Room and not be seen. She was observing. Draco didn't hex her, instead, he watched to see what she would do. This was a good way to see if she could be trusted. Mafalda didn't pay any mind to the cat still staring at Draco, the cat that seemed determined to have Draco jinx him.
There was still blood on his sleeve, Draco noted as he examined his hands. Bruises lined his knuckles and the joints of his fingers from some badly aimed punches. The bruises were blue, almost purple in some places against his pale skin. With the amount of blood he had on his hands, Draco had expected for some of his skin to have split against Finnigan's jaw. He flexed his hand, enjoying the soreness, like from a long game of Quidditch.
The warmth on he room greeted him as the door opened with ease. The fire was burning bright in front of the couch that had taken on an orange color tonight. The room had left out the chairs, Draco supposed that he and Potter didn't really need them anymore.
"Keep an eye on her? As if she's some misbehaving child? Merlin, Draco, get your head out of your ass and help your friend," Daphne snapped.
His knees shook as he made himself follow the voices. He recognized Potter's voice, but he could make out the words. Draco crouched has he moved closer to the group. His back was flat against one of the towering shelves as he hid behind a corner.
Fred had actually punched Draco before Potter could 'fight' him. This caused Goyle, the loyal bastard, to tackle Fred with all of his might. Ronald had attempted to pull Goyle of off his brother, only to be met with Montague's shove. George shoved Montague for shoving Ronald. Crabbe took this to be his cue to punch someone, that someone being Potter, but Draco shooed him away to go punch someone else. He then punched Angela Jones, who kicked him in between the legs. Really, at this point, Draco wouldn't be surprised to see Professor McGonagall and Severus having a fist fight.
The girl almost lost her eyes while rolling them at Draco’s stupidity. Draco could feel his smile grow until the whites of his teeth showed. Giddiness bloomed in his chest, this was the first time in a long time that he had honestly enjoyed himself. He does his best to hide it.
He surprised Draco with questions unrelated to the potion they were discussing. He snapped at Draco for the most trivial actions; breathing too loudly, writing too messy, having his textbooks stacked on his desk.
He pulled away from his mother's concern when they heard the echo of hurried step on the marble.. He swallowed past the buzzing in his stomach as he recognized their guests. The Death Eaters and their families entered the ballroom  through a pair of  double doors facing the main hallway. Aunt Bellatrix lead the way, her black dress trailing behind her, a look of absolute glee on her face. She couldn’t wait to spill blood.
If Draco had a week he wouldn't be able to list all of the reasons why not. He lowered his wand. He didn't have a lot of options. "Nice to meet you," he shook Black's hand. His nails were filthy.
Daphne stopped her pacing, moving to stand in front of Draco to look him in the eye, her blue eyes bright, dangerous. "I would turn on you in a second. If he threatened my sister, I wouldn't think twice. I would kill you with my bare hands if it meant keeping her safe."
The words bled together on the page. Draco rubbed his eyes, he couldn't focus when he was this tired. Staying up all night with Potter to watch the sunrise was so very worth his lack of sleep, but his focus levels disagreed. He rested his heavy head on his fist prompt on the elbow.
"Obviously, Goyle, he will tell us when we have proven ourselves worthy of his trust," Pansy hissed.
He stood over Daphne, but she wouldn't back down. This was where the line was drawn. Who backed down first would have lost, both knew that wasn't acceptable. Lucius exhaled slowly when Daphne didn't move, his knuckles white on his cane. Daphne continued to smoke, a bored attitude around her.
Draco was stupid enough to further investigate, finding the Weasley Twins dramatically announcing their different products. Fred and George were, quite simply, the biggest pricks Draco had ever had the displeasure of meeting. Did Draco draw first blood by making it his personal duty to piss off every Weasley? Yes. Did the Weasley's hate Draco because of his name, what his father did do the youngest Weaslet? Probably. Did Draco blame them? No. Did this erase the fact that the Weasley twins were still in fact, pricks? Absolutely not.
Draco cracked the window with a wave of his wand. "That's it then. Full Death Eater now." He kept his eyes on Potter as he smoked, watching his reaction to Draco's harsh words.
Potter as of late had been less and less predictable. Usually he can make the more reasonable decision, if he is not being instigated. However, Potter might have been so intrigued with Draco's move that he did not mind drawing the attention of every student in Hogwarts. Paranoia at Potter's rash behavior clawed at Draco's back. What was stopping Potter from stopping Draco in the halls again, demanding answers that Draco didn't know? Drawing the attention of anyone, everyone, to the fact that Draco is a traitor. With that in mind, Draco turned down a hall and began to take the longest and least predictable path possible to Charms. At the very least, he would have a chance to think.
The sounds of his footsteps filled the otherwise silent halls. Not many students were out this close to bedtime, but he was able to walk as he pleased due to his prefect status. He made his way directly to the statue that marked the entranceway to the tunnel that would lead to the Shrieking Shack. He wondered if Potter wouldn't mind if they changed their meeting spot. The initial surprise of being in that space again had worn off, but Draco always found himself cold in the shack.
Potter turned back to Draco, "I'll see you later, yeah? Same time, same place?" he didn't bother to wait for an answer before he turned around, making his way back to the Great Hall.
He woke with a familiar hand gently stroking his hair. He didn't have to open his eyes to know who it was. If he pretended to be asleep for a few moments more, that was one secret he didn't mind keeping.
He was only able to enjoy Finnigan's confused expression for a second before Draco punched him in the throat. Wrapping his hand around Finnigan's wand, he yanked the weapon out of Finnigan's grasp, tossing the wand behind him. Finnigan had both hands at his neck, trying to catch his breath. Draco brought his fist back, and drove it forward into Finnigan's diaphragm, the air leaving Finnigan's lungs.
Potter rolled his eyes, "Oh please, the first time I tried to talk to the girl I liked, I was covered in Stinksap. I'm sure you're doing fine."
"Not getting my nose broken seems like something I should work towards," Draco agreed, "how long are you here for?"
Draco stretched his shoulders while he popped his sore neck. He had been sitting down too long. While Draco's essay for Charms had been finished early, his exam for Transfiguration had loomed over his head with an evil glee. The three had collectively decided to panic together. Draco didn’t usually wait until the last minute, or the night before, but he had spent the day in Severus’ Potions lab making a large batch of a basic healing salve. He also made a couple of basic healing droughts, just in case. Then, of course, Severus had required him to have tea for the use of his resources. Draco had spent to entire day in the Potions Room, only meeting up with Daphne and Theo after dinner.
His arm was on fire. It hurt down to his teeth. He couldn't remember his dream, only that the blistering pain was enough to shock him awake. Heart pounding. Gasping for breath. Tears in his eyes at the sudden jolt of his skin peeling away.
"I was hoping you would come sit with my sister and I, we would love to have your company," the twin smiled dangerously sweet.
Potter shook his head, "I didn't mean like that, I mean… shit, I'm bad at this," he faltered, his head in his hands. "I'm mad at everyone," he tried, "but I shouldn't be mad at you. I know why you don't want to be seen with me. I know that you have appearances to keep up or some shit like that, at lease I assume, I could be wrong… I'm not very good at this. All I know is that the Ministry is dragging my name through the mud and even some of my closest friends are distancing themselves from me and I can't turn to anyone because even Dumbledore's ignoring me. But here you are, you're nice and funny and smart and… you talk to me, not the Boy Who Lived or the Boy Who Lied. I should be thanking you for that, for seeing me, but instead I just get worked up and I say hurtful things that I don't mean. Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you, and I'm sorry I said all those things about your dad. My point is; you have your reasons for doing what you're doing, and I'm okay with that. Because I like you," he finished.
Daphne moved around Draco, taking Pansy's hands in hers, "You don’t have to let him treat you like that."
Draco placed an arm over his eyes, warm and comfortable in this company. Safe. He allowed himself to drift off, trusting Daphne or Pansy to wake him if he started to stir in a nightmare. He thought of nothing in a rare moment of sleep.
The look on his father's face was worth whatever punishment he would receive. Draco further ignored Lucius, speaking directly to Mr. Weasley as his father opened his mouth to reprimand him. "How's work, Mr. Weasley?" Draco had probably spoken four words to Mr. Weasley in the past.
"What? Are you going to banned me from teaching him? We'll just continue to meet in secret, you two didn't know we were meeting until Potter told you anyway," Draco shrugged, "might as well compromise so that you two can keep an eye on us."
Severus pulled a chair and sat next to his bed while he ate. He was silent, but Draco could see regret clearly on his godfather's face.
Draco was a Death Eater, he got used to causing pain. It took a lot of stupidity to attack a Death Eater as a student, even if you had company.
"I know," Draco pulled him into a half embrace. His injuries complaining but he ignored the pain. "I know."
Realization settled into Draco's stomach. "You think I pushed her," he said, his chest hollowed out.
"My apologies professor, I can see where you got confused," Potter back handed. "What I meant sir, is that this discussion isn't directly related to our lesson today, so are questions allowed? Or is discussing this and opening the discussion for question in conflict with degree twenty-six?" Draco could hear the smile that he knew Potter now wore.
She had hurt him. Hurt him in a way that thought Draco true and pure pain. Despite the trauma, he understood the reason behind her cruelty. There was a lesson he had to learn, and he had taken his lesson to heart.
The letter was from Mrs. Parkinson, Pansy's mother, the letter was about a dinner party taking place over the winter break. Draco read through the letter, the guest list, slowly putting the pieces together.
Draco knew she would find out, he couldn't keep anything from her. Plus, he needed her help. He looked around again; this was dangerous information. Draco pulled Daphne back into the History of Magic classroom. Professor Binns was off doing ghostly things out of the classroom. Draco put up an impenetrable charm for safety. Daphne looked worried.
With his chin high and his shoulders strong he moved in between the two girls. Pansy was malleable to the movement, allowing Draco the space. He stood in front of Bulstrode, looking up at her but not letting her size overpower his authority.
The toast tasted like ash in his mouth, but he ate anyway. Pushing for Pansy to also eat, who sat across from him. Daphne sat next to him, but she was quiet in what Draco assumed to be contemplation.
"I have them somewhere Theo." Draco began to rummage through the unorganized stacks of combined notes the three supplied. He found them, neatly stacked together, naturally under everything else on the farthest end of the table that could fit twelve people easily. Draco handed the summaries to Daphne who had her hand outstretched, her eyes staying glued to the parchment in front of her as she dropped the notes lazily on top of Theo’s head. Theo didn't respond.
"Daphne," Draco cooled. Daphne froze, ready to rise and knock Montague on his ass. Her breath in short gasps, trying to claim herself down. The tension in the room was thick, Draco was rising against Montague without even sitting up from his relaxed position. He didn't need to.
Pansy gave him a causal shrug, "Just thought you should know, sweetie," she winked. Her face was stone when she turned back to Draco, "Don't pull that shit with me again."
The globe was smooth in his hand, heavier than he expected. His legs unsteady as he shoved himself up onto his feet.
Potter looked happy in this moment, together with his friends. Draco sighed, wishing he could surround Potter in this moment always. He seemed so carefree, the pressure of blood and war disappearing from his shoulders. There were times few and far in between that Draco could do that for Potter. Draco's hands were already dipped red with the upcoming war, he would just bring Potter down.
"So that's how you do it," Draco whispered enough for Potter to hear. A grin formed on Potter's lips.
Draco entered his room, kicking his door shut. He leaned against the back of the wooden door frame. His back slid against the wood as he let his feet slide out from under him.
Potter entered the lavatory shortly after Draco, his footsteps being the only sound echoing against the titles. Silence cloaked the pair after Potter stopped to stand at a distance behind Draco. His spine tightened against the silence, against the awkwardness that was between them. Draco turned to face Potter, Potter's stance was sure, strong, ready for a fight. Draco wasn't going to argue with Potter, no matter how hard the fist that hit him.
Potter turned to the exit, but coming to the door, also came upon the Imperturbable Charm. The awkwardness lessen only slightly as Draco walked across the tiles of the room to remove the charm. Potter acknowledge his thanks with an inclination of his head, before leaving the lavatory.
Severus stood up slowly, resting his palms on the desk. "I'm just trying to help you, Draco. You are just a boy."
Draco groaned, he was too lazy to move from the comfortable position that took up the entire couch, but Daphne was always dangerously persistent. In compromise, Draco lifted his legs.
"I don't know what to do," Draco sobbed. His cries shook his body, his gasps harsh and deep in both despair and surprise at his own tears.
"Your father fucks his secretaries, fucks them until he gets bored of them, then he fires them for a new, wet fuck," Montague paled, Draco further twisted the knife. "How many little bastard siblings to you think you have? One of them probably got pregnant, your father had to start paying her off to keep her quiet, is that why you're wearing the same robes from last year?" he taunted.
He motioned for Pansy to walk in front of him, she held the bottle of venom in glass to her chest. She turned the handle on the door-
A gentle elbow caught his attention, he looked over at Pansy, who was now seeping the roots. "What did you do to piss off Snape? You're his golden boy, after all," she hissed.
There was no point in trying to deny Potter's accusation, Potter could force Draco's hand in this with ease. That was for sure. Potter was too determined to get answers, Potter needed to be controlled.
Draco mocked, "Why, Mr. Potter, I will have you know that I am very handsome. You would think you could see that with your glasses."
Draco broke into a sweat, his stomach turned as he looked to Daphne. She didn't have this information, Draco hadn't intended on sharing this. "Potter, let's go somewhere private to talk ab-"
"It's not a problem, I just have to be more careful about how I carry myself. I don't want to make myself an enemy of my own house," Draco explained.
Draco shivered in the chill as he walked alongside the greatest dark wizard of the century. He shoved his hands in his pockets to warm them. Draco could feel Potter's penknife in one pocket, and Daphne's pale blue zippo lighter in the other. They continued walking, moving past the flowerbeds and to the large fountains of the outer garden.
Potter's breath feathered against his lips. Draco's lips parted. Potter's hand cupped Draco's jaw, tilting his head closer. Their noses touched, their lips almost touching.
He let the routine warm him, he pulled away from the window to face Daphne. She smiled gently as she blew smoke from her lips.
Instead, her body was a guard of the Manor. Draco couldn't think of anything else to do with the Inferi that was made with Daphne's body.
Potter didn't say anything right away, Draco's stomach plummeted. "I'll see you tonight, Potter. Be ready to work," Draco distracted in a shaky voice. Potter nodded, but didn't move his hand from Draco's shoulder. They stood there, just in front of the stairs, where anyone could see them. Draco stared at Potter, who seemed as if he was debating something. "Potter," he tried, "we should leave-"
Draco took a step back, enjoying the view , everyone working together again. He felt warm in the hushed laughter and giggles.
He had used the excuse of needing to focus on his assignments to stop doing his Prefect rounds. Severus had not been pleased, but had eventually agreed when Draco purposely flunked a few assignments across all of his subjects. Draco had pulled every book on Occlumency and Legilimency from the library. When he had gone through those without much found, he had turn to texts that weren't allowed in Hogwarts.
Potter tried to meet Draco where he was as he brought his hands to Draco’s shoulders. Potter was slow in his motions, treating Draco like a growling dog, and who could blame him?
"Do you really expect us to?" Severus answered coolly. "You've proven yourself to be talented in the art of violence. Why wouldn't you want to find your own revenge?"
He made sure to look casually away whenever he heard quiet footsteps and hushed whispers. He just hoped no one would be tempted to hex him, but the Weasley twins were still out for him, so he kept his guard up. Anyone not in the DA he made sure to snap at, taking points from anyone outside his house. He ignored the many footsteps behind him, they stayed a good distance away, waiting behind each corner. He smiled, Potter would appreciate this. ***
He walked around the gardens, along the high walls of the grounds. Mother, at his request, arranged for the ceremony to be placed outside in the gardens. Daphne would make her grand appearance by walking down the stairs, through the crowd to be presented to Draco as a debutante if he had remembered .
He sat there until he could breathe again, the panic still in his chest, but his breath calmed him. Tears dry on his face.
Draco hummed in agreement, rearranging the potion bottles to his liking. He had to reach over in front of Potter to do so, but Potter didn't move out of his space. Draco didn't either.
"You know you shouldn't need a wand if you are blocking your mind correctly," she waved her wand harshly in Draco's direction. He blocked her attacks with the strength of his mind, no wand needed.
How could she be expected to handle herself? How was she handling the questions that weren't being asked? Their engagement was open, yet private. Everyone knew, but only but whispers in the corners, never out loud.
Potter pushed open a random door. Draco shut the door behind them. Their backs against the smooth wood. Their breaths loud.
Draco couldn't see the point of doing something you have to get used to, but the pair continued to smoke in silence. Draco focused on breathing in the smoke before releasing his breath, he allowed the routine to take hold, calming himself down.
He got out of bed, putting on his dark blue cloak that brings out his eyes over his grey sleepwear. Getting dress in proper robes was too risky. Leaving his dorm and the Common Room was easy, no one was out this late. The night was heavy, as he heard crying. He usually wouldn't have investigated, but it was the sort or crying that touched your soul. The followed the sound to the girls lavatory, half expecting who was crying. He peaked in, using a listening charm to advance his hearing so he wouldn't have to enter.
"What we are doing now is dangerous, don't play coy," she argued. Her voice was low but her expression sweet to the outside eye.
Draco rolled his eyes, Potter really was an asshole. Potter tilted his head in thought, giving Draco a warm look.
"That may be true Malfoy," Dumbledore spoke as he stepped pass the privacy curtains, "but we need to know if there are students in our halls that could be dangerous to others."
The students stayed close together as they entered the room in awe. Daphne pressed against Draco's side a warm smile on her lips as she took in her surroundings. In the middle of the room, a large fire flickered on the floor. Seeming ever ablaze as the ash around the fire piled, but there was no wood in the center.
Draco felt a twist in his stomach, the Ministry's hold on Hogwarts was tightening like a cobra squeezing the life out of prey. The feeling of claustrophobia at an unseen force settled in his lungs.
"I'm sure the headmaster will hold off dinner for the entire castle for the only Harry Potter," Severus sneered.
"I'll be happy to assist if you have any suggestions, otherwise I don't leave if he doesn't," Draco opened the book to the first page. He knew better than to suggest any adjustment to Severus, who had ignored him several times in the weeks they've been meeting. Reminding Draco with a sneer that he was the teacher and that Draco himself had already attempted at teaching Potter Occlumency. No one moved. Draco looked up from his book. Severus had yet to move from where he prompted himself up on the table. Potter didn't look in any shape to continue, his body slumped forward and his head down. They usually needed the push to stop, Draco would always supply the excuse. "Let's be done for the night," he gently suggested.
Draco threw himself into his school work with what could be mistaken as determination. The truth was, he wasn't letting himself stop long enough to make a decision. He kept himself busy with whatever Umbridge had the Inquisitorial Squad doing that week.
Draco turned to Potter, rolling his eyes at Potter to make sure he knew of the trouble he caused. Potter grinned in response to Draco's suffering at Ron's hand.
He turned to her. He towered over her small frame. "I have no idea what you are talking about," he growled in a shaking calmness that was forced.
A gift waited for Draco in the middle of his bed the next morning. The dorms were quiet, everyone else was off to class. He had gotten permission to take an additional day to rest without attending classes. An excuse not given often by Madam Pomphrey, but she had given him a pitying look and told him to just worry about getting better. The gift was wrapped in green paper with silver ribbon. It was a narrow long box and wasn't much thicker than two inches. He opened card that was neatly propped on top. The card was pale, but was written in a dark green ink. The smell of a woman's perfume assaulted his nose when he opened the card. The gift was from Pansy, of course, wishing him well in his recovery. A red lipstick kiss stain signed the bottom of the letter.
"Your mother's cunt is dry," Draco spoke clearly. Shook ran through the crowed, Montague gasped. Draco titled his head, "How many secretaries has your father fired? I've noticed that he put another add out in the Profit, who many is that now? This would be the fourth this year?" Montague swallowed, Draco wasn't going to let him off so easily, easier to make an example of him now than deal with the consequences.
Potter released a breath that told Draco he had heard him, before leaning slightly to him and whispering out of the corner of his mouth, "We haven't even ordered yet, this is a fucking disaster."
"Still, that's two more friends than you have," Draco teased. Daphne gasped in mocked shock. Draco grinned. More students were entering for breakfast as the morning continued. The three were approached by Crabbe and Goyle, who both joined them for breakfast. The Carrow twins also joined their group, but didn't participate in gossiping with Pansy and Daphne, instead they conversed with Crabbe and Goyle.
He knew there was another reasoning behind the gathering of Draco's betrothal. The men had quickly locked themselves in the West Hall. The West wing had become His wing. Their Lord was giving orders, giving orders to what Draco now known to be the Azkaban breakout.
How pathetic was he? Draco had three civil conversations with Potter, but already their relationship felt more genuine than any of Draco's current friends. Well, the term 'friend' may be a bit of a stretch to label any of his relationship with his peers. Daphne, the person who he was honestly closest to right now, had threatened to kill him with her bare hands just hours ago.
Draco sighed. He started to reread at the top of the page. His thoughts were too distracting for him to focus.
"I'm going out," he started as he tried to stand, but his legs felt too weak and soon began to shake. Goyle reached out for him, pulling  the weaker, shaken boy up without comment. Draco had found his wand and cloak after a pitiful stumble. He was hurrying towards the door when Blaise had called out, "Draco, you should get some-"
"I think you should go," Draco dismissed her. She gazed between him and his father, a question obvious in her eyes. She left quickly.
"Well…" she continued, leaning in closely, "I didn't particularly heard anything, so much as saw something concerning with your fiancé."
After he had toweled off and dressed, he opened the window in his room. The widow that overlooked rows of flowerbeds from the gardens. A giving breeze cooled Draco's too scrubbed skin as he sat on the cushioned window seat. Draco played with the cigarette in his fingers, a zippo lighter in his other hand. A tray with a tea set was laid on the desk in the corner of the room. Draco supposed one of the House Elves left the snack. The tea had long since grew cold with lack of attention.
Dobby grabbed the front of his robes, his large green eyes glossy. "Mr. Malfoy must help Harry Potter!"
Draco sat in his usual seat in history, ready for his nap. He and Potter had talked into the early morning. Draco smiled at the memory. They hadn't talked about anything in particular, just talked. Potter was comfortable around him, comfortable enough to even call him a friend. They were friends. Real friends.
"Would you like to sit down?" Draco asked, as if entertaining a guest at the Manor, something the Malfoy's haven't done in almost a year.
His meals were served in his room, so he would not be a bother to the Malfoy's guess. Draco supposed this was his mother's way of protecting him. Out of sight, out of mind he supposed.
Draco, for simple good measure, snaps at the younger students to hurry to class. Even the older students stay clear of him, knowing he has the ear of Umbridge and as Prefect, he could hold his own. Draco has been known to cause students to get detention, though, he does his best to avoid putting any student through the horrid abuse Umbridge calls discipline. Draco has never put anyone younger than himself in detention, they are already scared enough as is.  He really only puts Gryffindors into detention, who seem, as a whole, to not approve of Draco's authority. This made Draco more enemies than not. Stupid.
How did Potter know? He was careful, he was always careful, his status depended on it. He knew his entrance into the Frog-Lady’s graces were absolutely necessary when he first realized the Ministry had moved to take control over Hogwarts. This was a pathetic attempt to remain in  control of the people, with Potter turning up with a dead student in the middle of the Quidditch Field screaming Voldemort, and Dumbledore's recent mysterious disappearances, unrest was common.
He opened his mouth to take another bite when one of his teeth fell out. The tooth dropped onto his lap without any fuss when he had gone for a bite.
Draco opened his mouth to say something clever, but he couldn't stop smiling over the compliment. He looked down at his hands in his lap, a blush hot on his neck. He glanced at Potter, who was grinning back at him, aware of his affect. Draco couldn't bear to lose him, lose this relationship between them. He couldn't lose his only true friend untainted by war.
"I'm right here," Blaise had sat next to him, his hand moved to his shoulder in reassurance, "I'm fine, really, more surprised than anything." Nott stood behind Blaise, his eyes shifting nervously between the two.
He turned around, Narcissa stood before him. Her hair was pulled back into an intricate knot on her head, she was wearing simple grey robes with no jewelry. She smiled hesitantly at him, her eyes hollow and dull. A painful twist settled into his stomach, ice enclosed his lungs.
Merlin, she was going to hate him. She always had a temper, but she knew Draco. She knew of his loyalties, his hesitation, she would kill him. She would kill him with her bare hands if she thought he was being careless, how was he supposed to marry her? She agreed with him, the Dark Lord was a disease, but would she risk her family? Her sister, who she cared for deeply? No. Draco supposed she wouldn't.
"Weasley wouldn't stop taking about it," she grinned, "but don't worry about your reputation, everyone knows it was a joke."
His face felt swollen from crying. He wrapped his arms around his knees. He was trembling from the force of his panic that was dwindling.
Draco felt a chill go down his spine before settling in his chest. He was there when Potter returned with Cedric, he remembers the screams and tears Potter released so publicly over the Hufflepuff. Draco recalled his own cold, paralyzing fear at his first sight of death. The sorrow Potter had shown was so raw, so unconditional, that Draco did not stop shaking until deep into the night.
Draco tightened his jaw, he didn't give Severus the satisfaction of a result. Not a blink. Not a tighten of knuckles. Not a quirk of a jaw.
“Vulnera Sanentur,” Draco continued, ignoring the sound of the girl hissing between her teeth. The blood returned to the wound, while the skin loosely knitted itself together. Her skin was together enough to stop the bleeding, but that was all.
Spells flew above Draco on the cold stone floor. Yells violent as duels went on. Draco laid forgotten.
"I haven't discussed this with him, but…" he met Dumbledore's gaze, "but if you think this will help Potter, then I can talk him into it. Better to have someone with all the pieces," Draco glanced at Severus, "or at least those that you let him have." Draco tilted his head at Dumbledore.
He pushed by Weasley and Granger as he made his way to the middle of the room. His heart twisted at the amount of faces he recognized. The Greengrass's had allowed anyone who wished to pay their respects to Daphne into their home. This alone was a rebellion against the darkness that was closing in. Daphne had gotten her bravery from somewhere. Draco saw several professors and students not in the inner circle. All of Dumbledore's Army was gathered into a corner of the large, but cramped, room. No one would look at him. Everyone's gazes snapped away from him as he met their eyes. He had been there when the DA was discovered. He was there when punishments where given. He watched as students carved their sins into their hands, their blood staining the parchment.
The arm around his shoulders loosened, Draco thought Potter was about to separate himself, when he felt a hand caressed lightly over his spine. He let his shoulders dropped, his head still in his hands. He swallowed whenever he felt Potter nose at his neck, his hands removed from his face then replaced by Potter's touch on his cheek. His face was hot. Fire had settled at Potter's hand on his back, his touch on his cheek.
"It's just," Draco bit his lip, Potter's face was still close to his, "what Pansy said, in front of everyone-"
He also didn't like the way Potter paused when he saw one of the only two empty seats in the classroom was next to Draco.
What was worse? Never knowing your family but having one take you in with warm open arms, or having your given family hate you? Would you rather be looking from the outside in, or inside out?
The Thestral stood on their hind legs, wings extending fully before disappearing in a puff of smoke and a blistering scream of a unknowable voice.
Draco didn't say anything. Disappointing Potter carved him out. Potter kept looking at him, Draco couldn't meet his eyes, he felt so small.
Draco could feel his nerves grind against each other, he felt raw, exposed. His jaw tightened as he shifted positions. Potter sighed, rubbing the back of his head, "Malfoy, look, I'm not very good at this sort of stuff. Listen, if you ever want to talk about anything, I'm here for you. Without any judgements, okay?"
Potter couldn't never find out who killed Daphne, who sliced her throat. Who squeezed the life from her like a snake.
Not that he should have to tell Potter that, Potter was a very knowledgeable person. Perfectly aware of the consequences of the situation Draco was in if he was found out. In fact, Potter was one of the only people fully aware of how much danger Draco was in. How important secrecy was. How exact Draco had to be in his situation.
Draco left Potter's mind quickly, their goal for tonight had been accomplished. "That was perfect," Draco beamed, a grin plastered on his face. "The most progress you've made yet."
"That's all," Potter dropped the subject, but he tilted his head with a knowing look. Which made Draco's gaze settle on the strip of neck that was exposed. Potter's eyebrows shot up.
A dry laugh escaped Draco's lips before he let Potter go. He instantly missed Potter's touch as he pulled away as well. "Potter, you know why."
The sound of hurried footsteps coming down the steps above them caused Potter to place a sure hand over Draco's mouth, as they were both still laughing.
"Ah, yes well, let me just tidy a bit here-" Potter rushed around as he tried to clean a place for them to sit.
Potter blushed. "I'm sorry, this is stupid," he rubbed the back of his head, "Dobby told me that you were yelling for Snape, I just wanted to make sure you were okay," he explained.
Thankfully, the mail arrived. A brown owl landing in front of Draco's breakfast. A simple white envelope was in the owl's beak.
Sirius snorted, "Tell me about it. Remus is even worst. Any words spoken against him is worst that swearing."
"I'm sorry," the words slipped past his lips before he thought about them, about their meaning. He said them quietly, for only her ears despite the crowed room. She looked down,  taking a shaking breath, her warm hand moved to Draco's cheek.
"Merlin, if this is a joke, Malfoy, your father will hear about this," he threatened, walking into the stall.
Potter's eyes widened, his lips tightened. He was so scared to loose someone else. "You don't have to," Potter's voice quivered.
Draco entered the greenhouse, weaving around the other students who arrived before him. He takes his usual seat that was usually reserved for him by Zabini. Zabini, the perfect representation of tall, dark, and handsome, was the only other Slytherin in his Herbology class, which made their suffering mutual. Potter was also in this class, but, luckily, he paid Draco no mind, at least, not more than usual. A sly, snippy remark or five might pass Potter's lips, but Draco retorts back in his usual manner.
Draco stood, but his legs wouldn't move more than that. Old fears from angering his father stopped him.
The blood dried and darkened on his body. Crusting over his skin as a constant reminder of his deed.
When Umbridge left with Potter and his shadows, Draco excused himself before things got ugly in Umbridge's office.
"Detention, Draco," Severus commanded at Draco's outburst. Draco was more than happy to distract Severus and Potter.
Severus tilted his head in reaction to Draco's slip, "What is that supposed to mean?" he investigated.
Theo stood awkwardly, unsure if he should follow Draco's example or not. "No one's going to notice, not with Astoria kicking Crabbe in the balls," Draco explained over a mouth full of food. Everyone's attention was on the fight. Students standing on tables, gathering in a tight crowd around the entertainment. Professors failing to investigate. Theo sat next to Blaise, a blush on his cheeks. Draco rolled his eyes as Bulstrode tsked. They shared an unexpected moment of comradery.
