To him, Hogwarts was an indescribably wonder. No one beat him, no one asked him to clean, or make them breakfast. They just showed him how to do amazing things without calling him "freak" or "weirdo" for doing them.
"Really well done there," he’d said. "Seriously, Harry, brilliant."
"Tell me," Draco murmured, pitching his voice low and seductive. He put his hand on Harry's chest and shoved him into the wall. Harry collided with a loud 'oomph' that went straight to Draco’s cock. "Tell me, Harry, do you want people to know that I had your cock in my mouth? Do you want to walk around with my marks on your body and my hands on you?"
. It had probably been in 2nd or 3rd year.
he just didn't know how to stop it. "Because he was a Gryffindor or because he's a half-blood."
"Perhaps you'd like to take the cabinet now?" Borgin asked with just a little too much hope in his voice. Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes as he looked at Borgin with indignant eyes. Borgin had the decency to flush and look away as Draco turned to leave.
Blaise really didn’t know what it was about Neville that was so appealing to him. He was honest—not exactly a trait he would always have said was attractive. He was innocent—well, maybe that was the wrong word, but he looked at the world so different than Blaise did. He was brave—and one day he’d die because of it. And he had a light to him—something that shone in everything he did, whether he failed or succeed or loved as much as his herbology, he did it with everything he was. And Blaise liked those things about Neville more than he cared to admit.
“And that’s funny?” Harry answered, sounding skeptical.
"We were worried about you, Draco," Nymphadora said. "Couldn't agree where to look though until Snape told us what Harry said to him."
"Perhaps," Lucius' lips twitched, his eyes focusing back on Severus. "Though I can't help but notice you avoided the question."
"Yes, but you don't
," Luna tried again, but she was too slow. And Bellatrix was raising her wand again, some unforgiveable curse on her lips, and Blaise had just seen his wand, shining against the black stone, but he knew he wouldn't reach it in time.
“How is any of this relevant?” Woods asked, standing with her hands flat against the table. “This trial is about Severus Snape’s ability to be Headmaster at Hogwarts, not whether or not he mistreated Harry Potter.”
And Malfoy was looking back at him, his eyes wide and full of some emotion that Harry didn't have any idea how to even start sorting through.
They were in the library, sitting together while they did homework. Or they were
"I'm saying that our children are worth being flexible for," Lucius answered, purposely making his voice smooth. Adarins smiled at him, but Lucius could see the way he tightened his jaw, the way he refused to take the bait. Luckily, he didn't have to.
Draco steadily ignored his parent's reminders that if he didn't do well, he'd be in serious trouble. He knew he'd do well, and it wouldn't be because of them. Of course, that wasn't the only reason he avoided writing to them. But he just didn't know how to tell them he was in the Order or if he was even supposed to.
By some strange turn of luck, the Gryffindors had won the cup, turning Pansy into some kind of annoyed monster that snapped at anyone who came too near to her. At least, that gave Draco an excuse to avoid her. He wasn't complaining. He needed all the time he could get to study for his OWLS. They were right around the corner.
how Pansy fawned over him. Potter should be no different. He
the bite in his words. "This isn't a debate, Draco."
"My mental defenses?" Harry asked, his mind feeling unnaturally foggy.
"Yes, oh," Draco said, making no move to leave either.
, but he had been wrapped up in his own feelings of betrayal—rightly so, he reminded himself—that he hadn't paid attention to Severus' feelings. Pain flashed across Severus' face, gone so fast Lucius almost missed it entirely. "Severus?"
But he was wrong. Draco was normal. The desire he felt toward Harry, to always be around him, to touch, to have him open up to Draco. It wasn't driven by any strange werewolf inside him. And wanting to tear Lupin's throat out, or even Weasleys—well, it wasn't as if Draco had never
"Don't be ridiculous," Potter answered, which really wasn’t calming in any way. He leaned back against one of the sinks to stare unnervingly at him. "It was the only way to get her to leave."
The first thing Harry saw was light. Light and trees. It took him a long time to realize he was in his forest. The forest he had always gone to when he needed to escape.
"Not from someone like-."
"Potter," Lucius sighed, somewhere between frustrated and relieved. He was going to have a conversation with Severus about teaching his child how to take better care of himself when this was over. "Stay calm. We'll get you out of-."
And deep down he knew no one would treat him the same if his name wasn't Harry Potter.
"Which, I suppose, is why he thought the poison might work."
"But I…" Harry tried to look away, but Draco caught his chin—the same way he had in the room of requirement—and it should have felt threatening or at least wrong, but for some reason it just didn't. "I care about you," and if the heat in his cheeks was anything to go by, he was blushing bright red, and
And Voldemort stared at the four of them, his snake eyes red and wide, and Harry could tell by the way he shifted his feet he was about to try and run, and Harry couldn't- he
"I-I didn't-."
“I told you,” Draco said, his eyes gleaming with that annoyed air Harry knew too well. If Draco was going to be angry at him, he could at least yell instead of patronizing him. “I’m scared of being a werewolf.”
Snape had even tried sleeping with him, laying across the doorway so as to make sure no one could come in or out without him knowing. It had helped; though it hadn't chased the nightmares away. He refused dreamless sleep potions. He couldn't bear the thought of putting something foreign in his body. Not after- He could feel the bags under his eyes steadily growing, becoming more and more worrisome. He knew Snape was worried when he'd fallen asleep during their lessons and hadn't bothered to wake him. Not that they were getting anything done anyway. He wasn't a bad student, but he wasn't anywhere near the student he'd been last year.
"Oh, dear," Lucius said, his voice quiet, and if Severus didn't know him half as well as he did, he wouldn't have known he was faking. "That is a serious accusation."
“No!” Lucius snapped, turning so fast his hair was a silver smudge in the air behind him, flying and tangling over his left shoulder as he glared at Severus. “I don’t want it back! I want you to
"Stay away from us," Draco told her.
"Draco, would you cease that infernal pacing," Severus snapped, now harshly scribbling out several lines of a student's paper and scrawling a T across the top.
"Oh, you know," he answered, checking his nails and buffing a particularly immaculate spot. "I've been busy."
," the witch smiled as if they were sharing some private joke. "I don't get rid of people who can be useful later," she answered. "Though for you, I'd make an exception."
And Severus hadn’t had the heart to do anything but nod as he’d placed the ring on the desk. He’d been able tell Lucius was disappointed that he hadn’t put the ring on immediately, but he hadn’t said anything.
They landed with a bang, Harry's feet colliding painfully with the ground. Draco cried out beside him, his knees buckling as his broken ankle gave out under him. Harry grabbed hold of him, clutching at his robes and cradling Draco close to his body. He cursed himself for forgetting Draco’s injuries, for forgetting what had happened to him.
"I think I’ll skip the Weasels family reunion, Potter?" he asked. Harry grimaced but nodded, dropping his wrist.
Harry had hoped that since Sirius had been cleared of his charges, he'd be allowed to go live with him, but Dumbledore said he needed to go back to the Dursley's for at least part of the summer. Something about the blood wards working to protect him. Frankly, Harry didn't much care.
It was always better in his Animagus form. He felt freer, calmer. He still had to watch for just as many threats from the world but at least they weren't cloaked in illusions of friendship. He supposed he should have told Severus when he'd managed to transform the first time, but he had just wanted to keep the information to himself. He yawned, his short bob-like tail wobbling dangerously. This was a secret not even Severus knew. And he didn't trust anyone not to ruin the little peace he could find the world.
“I don’t want you to touch me there,” Harry answered. “I don’t think I ever will.”
"Vile," Granger cut him off. "He's vile, Harry. How can you not see that?"
It was beyond arousing. It was the hottest thing he'd ever seen. If he thought Cho was pretty, he had to redefine his whole conception of beauty because Malfoy was the embodiment of it.
"Draco," she answered, her eyes going wide and soft. Harry stared at her; he wasn't sure he'd seen Hermione plead with anyone like that. Usually, it was Ron and him pleading with her to help them with homework. For some reason, when Draco sighed again, his face softening, it sent a pang of jealousy through Harry. Draco almost never just gave into Harry like that. "Don't make me go to another one of Slughorn's parties with just McLaggen for company."
to him, for even a minute? His feet unconsciously carried him up the stairs and toward Gryffindor tower.
"Harry, you're not, you know, The Heir of Slytherin, are you?" Ron asked quietly. He paused, casting an enigmatic look back at Ron before continuing his slow track forward. He wanted to say yes, he wanted to turn around and leave Ron to his fate. He wanted to do so many things that he knew he wouldn't. He couldn't. Though he knew Ron would do to him if the positions were reversed.
“An oblivious idiot.”
"Look, we can talk about this later," Lupin said, looking annoyed and impatient now. "Right now, we need to get out of here." He walked past them, gesturing impatiently for them to follow, his wand clutched tightly in his hand as he did. Draco followed him easily, pausing for only a minute when Harry didn't move.
"If we're going to Gringotts, why are we going the wrong way?" Zabini asked, his voice barely reaching Harry what with the wind blowing across his face. He wondered what the chances were that he could just ignore him. "Hey!" Zabini shouted, his voice pitched louder now, and Harry sighed.
evil. He’d never sounded evil.
"But I want to destroy what-,"
"Not even Severus knows?"
he thought and then quickly shoved the thought back, telling himself it wasn't true; it didn't matter.
"Zabini?" Harry snapped, his voice curling around the name just as Draco's had. "You mean Blaise Zabini, who's in love with
“No one works with him,” Shacklebolt interrupted. “He does everything by himself.”
He stilled.
Harry stumbled back as the ground between him and young man erupted, flinging his arms up to cover his face from the flying debris.  He coughed as the dust swirled and squinted as his back came against a tree, blinking rapidly.
She finished taking the attendance and she rolled it up.  She walked back in front of the class as the roll vanished to wherever the attendance rolls went.  As she smiled kindly at the class, she noticed that almost all of them were more comfortable than they had been in the beginning.
"Harry is not me," Qye finished in a final tone of voice.  His eyes hardened and broke no argument.  “I am not Harry and Harry is not me and that's all there is to us."
He stopped.
The war might have been mostly over but he was struggling with his role as the Pater Nosferatu of Europe so long as he remained here and distracted by something he would not say.
There was a long silence and then he heard his footsteps recede, the rest of them following silently behind.
Lest’s blood ran cold as he felt a flicker of a new presence on his peripheral.
Marylin blinked, startled by the unfamiliar tone voice.  Lest frowned as Dumbledore took another step forward.
“I didn’t think it would be something you want to hear from a man you barely met and knew, Harry,” Remus replied, turning his gaze to him, a trace of apology finally entering his eyes.  “Keep in mind, I had no knowledge of your relationship with your relatives besides what I heard in rumors.”
Harry rolled onto his back and scrubbed his face, digging the palms of his hands into his eyes.
He embraced his Videte again and knew she was shielding the few stray students stuck in the corridor in the presence of the pack of
His eyes burned.
“Well, I better go now,” she said, glancing at her watch.  “I have a staff meeting to get to.”  She looked back at them and smiled again.  “I’ll see you all in class so take care of yourselves until then.”  She patted Harry on the head and waved to Ron and Hermione before turning and walking away.
Jonas stood frozen, mind stuttering while his mouth hung open with the words he was about to shout gone from his lips.  His eyes slowly trailed to the bed the chair was angled towards and saw that the other occupant of the room was still asleep, in the same position Jonas had left him in.
Qye waited but Harry didn’t continue.  He sighed, his anger and irritation fading away as he once again absently reached out to where Harry used to be, seeking some reassurance for tomorrow.
A rush of heat filled him, the Libidates roaring in him as the long lived with ache inside him suddenly disappeared.  The soft skin, softer than feathers, silkier than anything he had ever felt made him want to moan with pleasure.  He could feel the warm blood pulsate beneath his fingers, its delicious scent surrounding him and creating a new ache inside of him, replacing the other one quickly.  Feeling the blood move beneath his fingers, the scent encompassing him…he wanted to whimper with unfulfilled desire.
“Lest, stop that,” she scolded. “You’re frightening them.”
he thought mournfully as he cut up his dandelion stems.  He continued to add in the items, remembering to stir at the correct times.  The class passed in relative silence, the only sounds being the clinking of vials, the soft thuds of knives on desks, the crackle of the fire underneath the cauldron, and the quiet bubbling of the potions.
Worry and concern filled his thoughts. ‘
“There are some things that I want to tell you about…” he started slowly, raising his eyes again. “But, I don’t want you to be hurt when I say that there are some things that I can’t just talk about. Not right now. I’m still thinking and working on them - ”
He held out a hand and she dropped the letter in his hand, a touch of haughtiness coming back to cover up her uncertainty.  “Professor Snape said to open it as soon as you got it.  He said he’ll be in the teacher’s lounge if you need him.”
“What about the Wiggenweld potion?” blurted out Fudge, taking a step closer and then two back, casting a wary eye to the beds as if they were contagious.  “I know there was promise to it - ”
“Pater!” she yelled and he grimaced as he heard a faint scrambling sound echoing in the hallway, raised voices bouncing off the walls.
Gray eyes glanced into the office, noting the nurse as she mumbled and turned over in her blankets. Soft leather boots tapped their way across the smooth floor of the Infirmary, sliding past the other patients and stopping by a door. A pale hand gently eased the door open, aristocratic features wincing as a soft creak echoed through the sterile place. Quicksilver eyes sharply looked back to the office but the nurse continued to sleep soundly.
“Are you sure you’re not coming down with something, Ron?” Qye replied, raising an eyebrow and forcing a playful grin onto his face. “I mean, really, do you know how ridiculous that sounds?” He forced a slight laugh, making sure that his eyes weren’t narrowed or full of suspicion. They would suspect something if he showed signs of suspecting them. “Really…me not being me. Who else would I be?”
Harry inwardly sighed.
Its head cracked against the wall and it slid down, still and burning.
who shrieked at a smudge of dust.”
’ She continued to stare at the door.  That could perhaps explain the tingle, the only reaction she had to him.  She closed her eyes.  It wasn’t as if she would recognize him by sight anymore.  Not since Lest’s decision.
There was silence for a long while and Harry braced himself for the barrage of questions.
Qye exhaled.
Harry said, watching as Ron and Hermione exchanged looks.
!” Ron suddenly shouted and the vampire jerked back at the jet of water.
“Oi! Harry!” Ron called out over the heads of the first years.  “Do you want to get locked out of the Tower?  Come on!”  The redhead scowled at his brothers who had began make cracks about how much he was sounding like Percy.
“I can’t believe this is happening,” Sirius whispered and Remus gave into the urge to drop a hand on his friend’s shoulder, gripping it tight in support.  “Not like this, Moony.”
:: growled the voice.  The black-haired teenager just snuggled closer into his covers.  The voice sighed.  ::
:: Qye asked quietly, suddenly looking through Harry’s eyes and out at the stars as well.  ::
“Harry!” Hermione said, aghast, and he could feel Ron’s stunned look on him.
“You're cute when you blush,” Draco smirked.
“What is this?” Draco asked irritably, frowning at them both.  “I didn’t realize your lives were so utterly dull that you had to pry into ours.”
“So much trouble for such a dismal looking boy,” the vampire said curiously, eyeing him with obvious disdain.  “You hardly seem worth the effort to keep alive.”  He snorted and started walking towards him.  “Why - ”
Professor Opacre's bright blue eyes cheerfully looked at her class, all of whom looked thrown off-balance. Except for Draco, who was meeting Lest scowl for scowl.
"At least we know when it's coming," Draco shot back.
“I thought the Dazains were always proud of being a vampire,” Jordan said, blinking.  “Why would they join with wizards?”
“As for being young,” she continued, smiling slightly, “Well, after a certain age we begin to age much slower.  However,” she sighed, “that age is one hundred and by then, you’re already into wrinkles so what does it matter if it takes you longer to get another one?  In our first hundred years, we age just like any other mortal so…” She looked around the class.  “Does that clear up the answer on how vampires age?  Yes?  Good.  Next question.”
“You’re right,” he murmured and the Gryffindors gave off silent sighs of relief. “The boy seems too shy to do anything of the sort, possibly afraid of me. He would never - ”
:: he shouted again, shaking.  ::
“Sorry,” she said, smiling ruefully.  “It’s a habit of mine to touch people, especially young ones.  I suppose you can say I’m the kind of girl who coos over babies and young children and like to hug them.”
The dark-haired boy raised an eyebrow. “Haven’t you asked me this before? Didn’t I say I was fine?”
This time, Lest moved.
The vampire raised an eyebrow as the boy’s face closed off.
"Besides," his voice spoke without him, "that looked like it hurt."
:: Harry said, worried and alarmed when the other boy didn’t say anything, ::
The nurse had eyed them and when she had reached for Harry to guide him back to Smethwyck, Qye unceremoniously wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist and helped him up, giving the woman the flattest look he could.
-------
Marylin blinked as the two teenagers pulled her arms insistently, baffled by their sudden turn of mood. She glanced at her brother, who still hadn’t turned to them. ‘
Professor Opacre placed the papers on her desk and kindly looked at him.  “Of course, Harry, you know I’m always eager to help.  Although, you’ve been doing so well, I don’t think you need to worry about the upcoming exams.”
Then he realized he was left with the crowd of people who were still giving them curious looks.  Even the Weasley twins were grinning in a manner that was not at all comforting.
“Would you like to start together then?” Wainscott asked and Qye silently reviewed the courses of actions he hypothesized last night.  “Or would you prefer individual interviews first?”
:: he whispered painfully, a shudder sweeping through his body as he coughed.
Harry said nothing, still staring into the room.  The voice was Qye, the mysterious person he had been reading about all November.  How much of a coincidence was it that after a month of learning about him the boy had found his way into his head?  And after taking a potion on the subconscious…he wouldn’t be surprised if he had thoughts about Qye in there.
Harry froze.
He contemplated for a long moment about letting this go on.  But then he caught Malfoy’s gaze and saw it flicker towards the doorway.  He followed it and inwardly sighed.
.:: Qye shrugged.  ::
Voldemort reared back, a snarling grimace on his face from what must have been Lest trying to tear his mind as the remnants flickered past them, Marylin barely picking herself up.
“Is that what you call it here?” the vampire woman said innocently, and Harry blushed even more.  Taking in a deep breath, he dropped his hand from his red-tinged face.  He glowered at a grinning Malfoy for a moment before shaking his head and turning back to the vampire.
"Well, well," he said, his voice echoing loudly in the entry hall around them.
"Yes, tragic." Harry answered automatically, and McGonagall's lips tightened even further.
He stopped at the muffled scream behind him, half-turning at another more frantic tug at his sleeve, and Kenny was really whimpering something now. Severus' voice yelled something, but Lucius couldn't understand him through the bubblehead charm.
"Like you didn't complain when you heard who you were working with," Harry rolled his eyes.
I say?" When he raised his head, just a fraction, just enough for Harry to see his face. His eyes were rimmed red, gaze locked on Harry with a shocked, guilty, relieved expression that Harry

"I…" Slughorn blinked at him, his mouth gaping like a fish.
with his long blonde hair braided over his shoulder and an angry expression on his face.
"Why aren't we allowed to be happy, Draco?" Harry had asked, and right then, in that moment, Draco didn't know.
Draco sighed back at him, flicking his hair out of his face as he stepped closer to Harry, his hand closing around his wrist, squeezing gently.
the sign lit up with several magical lights.
"Why didn't you protest?" he blurted suddenly.
"You're right, I don't," he said, forcing his voice to be soft. Unfortunately, Potter seemed to see right through him, his eyes flashing with hurt and anger. The anger Draco understood, but the hurt, he didn't.
"Then why have you betrayed him?" Severus asked, blinking slowly up at him. "For pride? Doesn't working with muggleborns hurt your pride more than the Dark Lord could?"
Hogwarts? What do you know?" He blinked, trying to keep the incredulousness of his face. She really was crazy.
“And that’s my fault,” Harry snapped, and Draco bit his lip.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ugh!" Pavati snapped, flicking her wand impatiently when nothing happened. "I still can't do this."
“It seems impossible.”
“I…” Weasley flicked his eyes around, sinking even lower in his chair. “I think it should have been obvious.”
Except... he had
"No. No, you don't call me Harry. You don't get to," Harry snarled. "You're nothing but a pureblood brat, and I never cared about you. Not for a single bloody second."
"No!" he'd hesitated, because it
"You're thinking about Draco again, I can tell."
"There's nothing new left to learn," Draco answered.
"Merlin, I can't believe I ever touched you…" Pansy hissed, a look of revulsion passing across her face.
"But I'm
"All types of Dark Arts leave different signatures," Malfoy answered easily, sounding surprisingly patient, almost as if he didn't mind explaining the technical aspect of his job to Harry in the least. Which, couldn't be true, because… Well, because Malfoy was supposed to be petty and impatient and not want to explain things to people he
“Why wouldn’t I mean it?” Draco asked, and he tried not to sound annoyed, but he must not have succeeded if the way Harry glared up at him was anything to go by.
“It is….” McGonagall said, and she sounded warier now, her answer trailing off at the end, as if she wasn’t sure she should say anything.
"What was that?" he asked.
He'd let Cedric drain the anger away, leaving emotions that felt so good and so light that he never wanted to go back to the dark again. And yet, he should have known better than to believe the dark would stay away because he wished it to.
“Draco,” Harry said, his voice soft and thoughtful, and Draco’s gaze snapped to him so fast he thought he might suffer from whiplash. “I’m sorry I thought you were shagging Pansy,” he said, and Draco suddenly felt very cold, naked in the middle of the corridor where anyone could walk by. “I—” Harry swallowed. “I was jealous.”
"Just leave me alone, Potter," he snapped. He stepped to the side, trying to inch his way around. "I have better things to do." He was pretty sure he used to be a better liar too.
"No…" he whispered, shaking his head slightly. As if that would make the truth disappear.
"Like you, he asked for my mother's diadem, and then he stole it," she turned back to him, her voice warping with an angry fire that made Harry take a stumbling step back. "He corrupted it, and I will not make the same mistake again."
"What?" She hesitated, and he sighed, turning to Harry and holding out his hand. Harry immediately placed his wand into Draco's outstretched palm, and he faced the door, muttering a complicated locking spell that Severus had taught him. A spell that he
"Your Lord," Draco snapped. "He not my anything." Suddenly, Nott's wand was out, pointing across the small distance between them and directly into Draco's face. Draco just stared at him; Nott couldn't kill him, he'd been ordered not to. That didn't mean he couldn't hurt him.

someone to hear what he had to say. And for some reason what Harry needed was more important than what Draco needed, right now.
"Okay," Harry answered, ignoring Ginny completely. "Okay, as long as we do this quickly. Otherwise, I'm going to the Department of Mysteries right now."
Thank you for reading and commenting!
." And suddenly, his mind clicked back into place, shoving aside the pain as if it was nothing next the voice permeating through him. He knew exactly who and where he was.
“I still don’t understand,” Draco answered before Harry could, sure he wouldn’t exactly say anything helpful. “How did you know? You always said we couldn’t trust him.”
"Whatever."
“The past can still hurt you, even if you don’t want to acknowledge it,” he said. Harry just shook his head. He wanted to twist his hand around Draco’s, to wrap his fingers around Draco’s and tug him close, to hug Draco and run his hands along his back until that look of pain and apprehension was out of his silver-grey eyes.
“You made it out alive,” Harry answered.
“Well,” Potter answered.
Hermione Granger, thank Merlin someone could use their brains, immediately drew her wand, pointing is at the shelf above the Death Eaters and shouted
And then Severus was taking a step forward and his wand was out before even Voldemort could react. He flicked it once and Harry's and Lucius' were flying through the air and back into their hands. Harry wasted a heartbeat wondering just how he could have been stupid enough to think so little of Severus before he snapped to his feet and faced Voldemort.
"It's bad, isn't it?" Hermione said, snapped his gaze over to her.
"I never said you couldn't," Draco said.
"You know I don't trust anyone, Headmistress," Draco answered, immediately.
"No…" Draco whispered, letting Harry push him one last time before watching him turn and begin to walk away. Draco stared after him, feeling stunned and useless. Harry was so used to pushing people away. He was so used to people letting him. Even Severus, who was the closest person to Harry, let Harry keep him at a distance. Draco watched Harry cross the floor and wondered how lonely Harry must be.
He took his handful of Draco's arse and flipped them. Draco gasped, staring up at Harry with wide grey eyes, his long blonde hair a tangled halo on the pillow under him. And Harry was sinking into his heat easily, letting Draco groan and wrap his legs around his waist.
Severus had pursed his lips and nodded, though Draco could tell he didn't like it. But he had trusted him. Severus had trusted him, and Draco was terrified of disappointing him the way he’d always disappointed his father.
"It's not your responsibility to save everyone, Potter!" Draco snapped, releasing all of his pent-up frustration and hoping Harry would see just how foolish he was being. He blinked, stepping away from Draco as if just realizing how angry he truly was.
Not that any of his lessons helped. They all continued on as if nothing had happened. As if Umbridge wasn't biting at everyone's heels and she
"I know," Draco answered.
"Enough," Severus said, but he was on a role now, and he didn’t know how to stop. He didn’t want to stop. It was so unfair. It was all
"Shall I tell him how I just
He reached for the presents with trembling fingers, unwrapping several expensive potion textbooks. Draco sat back on his heels and just stared at them. One was full of high-level potions, some dangerous enough that not even Severus would let him make them unsupervised. He wondered if Harry knew that and believed in him enough not to hurt himself or had just bought a potions book. He knew which he preferred to believe.
“I doubt you appreciate my consistently asking for your help,” Severus said, his voice tight, eyes set, and Lucius couldn’t decide if he was angry or just trying to be.
"But Draco knows," Potter answered.
"I'll look after him," Harry interrupted, and Lucius stared for a long minute. Then his face softened, and he nodded. He hesitated for half a second before turning on his heel to walk away. Harry could feel himself relaxing, the effort of having to keep his emotions down draining him like nothing else.
wasn't
Finally, he couldn't take it anymore. He stood and left the common room, not even bothering to make an excuse to Granger and Weasley. They didn't ask him what he was doing anyway. They never did anymore. He walked out of the portrait, and trekked down the hall, making a few turns without really having a destination in mind. He supposed he should go to the library, read a few more books, see if he could find more information. But he had found nothing every time he looked, and it was becoming tedious when nothing was to come of it.
"What do you mean?" Draco narrowed his eyes. "It's the library, public space." And Lovegood's serene smile didn't even waver as she looked from Harry to Draco and then back again.
"And what could convince you to keep your concerns to yourself?"
"Draco…" he muttered, directing a glare at Potter's head. How dare he tell Draco before he was ready. Draco gasped, his silver-grey eyes widening with disbelief.
Moody.
"Well, maybe….," Hermione started, trailing off as she didn't have actually have an idea.
"Look what we have here?" Bellatrix purred, stepping up and stroking down Harry's face. He didn't even flinch away from her as he was wont to do with anyone else. Harry just stared up at her, his green eyes blank and dead, and Draco thought he might just throw up.
Severus tightening his grip in Lucius’ hair, opening his mouth and feeling the way the fingers of Lucius’ right hand lingered along their ring.
Malfoy Heir to Marry:
"It's true there's no rule against it, McGonagall," he answered, smiling widely at her. "But isn't it also true that some rules don't need to be said. I mean, common sense. If this was the ministry, we would never stand for such a thing."
Suddenly, something solid connected with Harry's back, sending him balanced precariously on a stand seat with something heavy pinning him down by his hips and hands on his wrists. His glasses had gone skew, but he would recognize that blob of white blond and those two grey blurs anywhere. He flinched as warm breath wafted across his face and then gasped as a wet tongue ran along his cheek.
"I think it's more if I want you there," Harry answered, rubbing the back of his neck as they walked along. "He does say, if I'm so inclined."
, Ron," she snapped, dragging him down the hall and away from Harry and Draco.
"How long should I be upset about a prophecy that basically tells you to sacrifice yourself for the greater good, Harry?"
"He didn't need to know," his father answered, turning his head to lock eyes with Draco. And he knew that was closest they would ever get to sharing their grief.
“Before he was arrested, you mean?” Lucius asked.
, Draco stubbornly insisted. He nodded encouragingly to himself. His father lied to him. No, if Draco was being honest with himself, that wasn't even what was bothering him. It was the fact that his father was so ashamed of what he'd become that he couldn't even bring himself to look at the scars along his neck, much less tell Draco what they meant.
"How did you do that?"
“Hey, guys,” Neville said, appearing suddenly at the edge of their table. Dean snapped his mouth shut even as Ginny continued to glare at him.
"No!" Harry's emerald eyes went wide. "No, that's not it at all."
"I never expected to see you here so soon," Dumbledore's voice echoed around the forest. Harry looked up; he supposed he should have been relieved. He wasn't in eternal turmoil or something equally horrible. He had almost expected to wake up on fire or something.
Auror James flicked her wrist forward, pointing to the door on the left as she did. Dracona nodded, feeling Auror Johnson shift behind her as she did. She nodded as James' hand touched the door, her wand at the ready. Then it was thrown open, and they rushed inside.
"You want
Voldemort hissed, his hand sliding up and grasping Harry's hair. It yanked his head back, exposing his throat while Voldemort's other hand descended onto his hips, shoving away his robes and worming its way under his shirt. Harry shivered. Ice cold fear shooting through him, stabbing in his chest and worming its way up into his throat. He was almost surprised at his own reaction. The last time Voldemort had touched him, he'd been so numb at Cedric's death, he'd felt nothing. Nothing but cold and pain.
"Hmm," he answered. The library was empty except for them and Madame Pince, who he could just image looking at him suspiciously over her glasses. Sometimes she had maintained that position for hours while he read. He didn't particularly understand why the woman distrusted him so much but then again it wasn't as if he'd done nothing to earn it.
Severus asks for help.
"Hmm," Harry said. Draco stared as if waiting for Harry to say anything else, but after another minute, he gave up with a loud sigh.
“What?” Ginny answered, and Luna didn’t miss the snap in her voice.
," Draco snapped, and felt a vicious sense of glee when Harry flinched in his grip. "This just seems like the sort of thing you'd tell your boyfriend."
him, hurt him the way Lucius hurt every time he had to look at Severus and think about how he chased after the girl with the red hair and the green eyes as if Lucius had never been in love with him.
"Upset!" Lucius let out a bitter laugh, keeping his eyes trained on the ground. "You understand that I'm upset," he laughed again though the idea really wasn't funny. Severus sighed, a long heaving sigh that told him a lot more than Severus would ever say out loud. It told him how hurt he still was, how much he cared, how tired he was. It told Lucius that if he didn't stop pushing, Severus would walk away, and he might never have a chance to pulling him back in again.
They would end up killing each other.
"This is Firenze," Dumbledore's voice rang into the entrance hall. "I think you'll find him acceptable."
They both jumped when the knock sounded on the door, one loud bang, followed by another loud bang. Lucius looked at Severus, who was frowning, looking somewhere between perplexed and annoyed.
It didn't take them long to find the main room on the chamber of secrets. The tunnels all seemed to be pointing that direction anyway. It took them even less time to figure out what was going on, what with Tom Marvolo Riddle explaining everything to them while Ginny lay dying on the floor. Ron yelled while he just stared; this was He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named before he became He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. He wondered what exactly it took to become so evil in your heart that you could condone killing a family, a baby.
"You haven't tried to talk to him?" Lucius asked, and he looked as if he were finally just putting himself together again.
When Slughorn finally noticed the time, he waved his hands and said he'd lost track as he always did when he invited people to have dinner with him. Draco wondered vaguely if he thought people didn't notice that he always did the same thing or if he just didn't care if he was considered predictable. Draco had stood as quickly as he could and almost ran from the room. Except that Malfoys didn't run away from things, even if they were annoying boys who stared at girls when they should be staring at him.
a new voice suddenly snapped, and there was a flash as Hermione Granger stepped out of the shadows, the Hardening Spell flying toward the witch.
"Lovegood?" Harry blinked at her; the confusion obvious in his eyes.
like I'm going with Harry," Draco said, and then sighed. "In case you hadn't noticed, Harry and I aren't exactly on speaking terms, besides, I think he'd much rather go with
"I would like it more if you wouldn't treat me like your toy," Harry answered, and he sounded so sincere, so hurt. Like he really had no idea what this meant to Draco. Like he really thought this was all some game.
"Well, evidently, or you would never have tried to question Slughorn like that," Draco answered, and he’d looked genuinely amused, laughing at Harry for the first time in too long, and it had been almost too much, the reminder that Draco hadn’t always been so… moody.
(See the end of the chapter for
"My Godson—" he started.
"Exactly what I believe," Dumbledore smiled softly. "Very good, Harry."
"I don't care about Potter; I care about Draco. More importantly, I care about his staining Slytherin's image by dating The Golden Boy. Really, it's bad for business," Zabini said, and Hermione looked over at Ron, exchanging a long look. She didn't trust him, but she didn't trust what he would do if they said no. And besides, it never hurt to have someone clever in the planning. Zabini must have sensed that he won, because he stepped forward with a large grin.
He let Lucius lead him through the door into his private room, both completely naked as they sprawled on the bed. And then Lucius just stared down at him. And like before Severus had the horrible desire to withdraw. He knew his body was nothing to be proud of. He had no delusions about that, but did Lucius have to draw such attention to it?
"What do you want?" Harry asked finally.
"I do not blush," Draco answered immediately.
"I wanted him," Harry interrupted. He wasn't looking at Severus, but he didn't need to be looking for Severus to see the tear that caught on his eyelashes. Severus couldn't stop himself from watching it in fascination. "I wanted him so badly." Harry blinked, and the tear disengaged from his eyelash, making its way down his face. "You'd think I would've learned my lesson." It dropped of his face, landing with a plop on his knee. Harry flinched and then moved his hand to wipe away the wetness.
“You’re lying. Why wouldn’t they tell you?” he said and immediately knew he'd struck a nerve. Potter's eyes flashed, and he opened his mouth.
He remembered when Dumbledore had insisted the training begin, saying there were things even Severus couldn't tell him. He'd argued. He'd been angry, but back then he'd always been angry. It hadn't done any good; Dumbledore had simply stared at him until he cooperated. He remembered hours spent over pensives and sitting across from Dumbledore while he droned on and on and on.
"Listen, I heard you're the new captain," the boy was saying. "When're you holding trials?"
"I never sleep," Harry answered, and Draco raised an eyebrow. If Harry thought that was supposed to somehow make things better…. Then Harry sighed, that deep mournful sigh again.
Lucius was a pureblood. He was not. Lucius was rich. He was not. Lucius was beautiful. He was… not. He didn't understand and no amount of contemplating could make him.
Not that Draco cared.
As soon as he stepped onto the train, she just happened to be in aisle, her glasses hanging from her hands as she stood staring as him. As if she'd been waiting for him. Which was ridiculous.
"He was giving us trouble," Parkinson said finally, fluttering her eyelids in a way that was supposed to be flirtatious. Though Harry just wanted to vomit up his dinner, preferably on her. "We were just getting him under control."
"Where else is there to be?"
And find it he did. It wasn't even that hard once he started listening. It radiated the same power Salazar Slytherin's ring had, and even without having a connection to Voldemort, Harry could feel the power calling out, seeking to kill, and destroy. It didn't call to him directly this time, but he could still
was- for the thing that had killed his wife in their own home—the place that was supposed to be protected above all else- for the thing that had corrupted his son—perhaps ending the Malfoy line forever. It was not to bourn and if that meant working with people he didn't like, well, he had done it before.
"I thought you knew why I was there."
a little voice whispered, tickling the back of his mind, and Harry shoved it away before it could say something else absurd.
And then the spell was ending, Harry gasping and trembling against the floor. He caught a single glance of Draco being held back by one of the Death Eater twins, and then Voldemort was slashing his wand to the side, a long gash of pain blossoming across Harry's chest, then another, and he was screaming again as another
Slughorn talked for a long time, telling stories of his former students and his illustrious 'slug club.' Blaise caught Harry by surprise several times when he rolled his eyes or had to hide a chuckled behind his hand. He even cracked a joke about slugs at one point that had Neville laughing so hard Harry had to kick him under the table when Slughorn looked their way. For Harry's part, Ginny was a balm. Every time he felt on the edge of dying of boredom or wanted to just get up and leave, she would turn to him and smile or roll her eyes good-naturedly. It relaxed him more than he liked to admit.
Draco groaned, resisting the temptation to find Potter and smack him upside the head with the paper. On one hand, what he had done was incredibly brave. It couldn't have been easy to talk about what had happened to him. On the other, why had he had to? It wasn't like he owed it to anyone. Besides, the fact that he was just in deeper shite now with Umbridge because of his stupid morals.
"Hmm," Draco answered.
"Let him go, Lupin," Harry said, his voice horribly close to pleading. "Please, just… Voldemort doesn't want him, please. You don't have to do this. Just let him go, and I'll-."
"The Department of Mysteries?" Luna asked, her voice lilting dreamily. “Why would you go there?”
Warning: sexual content ahead
"Draco isn't really saying anything," Blaise answered, his eyes flicking over first Granger and then Weasley. "I've heard the same rumors as you have, but he's been closed mouthed about all of it."
But he couldn’t exactly tell the truth and condemn Harry either.
"I…" he faltered. He
Severus led the way up the stairs, setting a brisk pace that made both boys almost jog to keep up. He led them along the corridor, pausing only for a second before pushing open the door to Umbridge's office. She was waiting for them, with Montague seated in front of her and a look of the utmost distaste on her face.
“Do you see me disagreeing with you?” the redheaded boy muttered, chewing on a piece of a toffee. “In case you’ve forgotten, I’ve gotten into a couple of fights these couple of days defending him - ”
“Why did you stop me?”
It was a young man, only a few years older with red-brown hair and black eyes that looked calmly at him.
The weight on his shoulder disappeared, voices loud above him.
“Would you prefer me to pretend we’re not all flying by the skin of our teeth, Qye?” Wainscott said and Qye drew back at her honesty.  “I’ve been involved in several unorthodox cases, which have become my specialty by sheer chance.  Each time, I’ve had to test and try out new methods because the traditional protocols don’t fit the individuals involved.  I don’t have a plan for how to run this evaluation but I can also say I’ve never let anything like that stop me before.”
“H..Harry,” she stammered, looking pained, “I…I didn’t mean it like that, really, I was just - ”
He froze when he saw the unconscious guard on the floor, the carefully protected door slightly ajar.
"Draco, I—" and suddenly Harry cried out, his hands coming up to clasp down onto his forehead.
"He was with me when I found the diadem," Harry said, and he was staring at Draco with those green eyes again, his expression dark and charged and Draco
"I don't have a girlfriend," he didn't know why he said it. He could have just shrugged and nodded; he'd done it before when someone he didn't like was coming onto him, and it was clear from the way Malfoy's grey eyes flicked down his form and then back up that Malfoy was coming onto him. But this seemed important. It seemed important to make it clear that Harry was not taken.
“So, I’ll be seeing you, Snape,” he said, and Severus didn’t bother to answer before he flicked the Floo powder into the fire and stepped through.
"Oooh, will you kill him, Harry? Shall he share a stall with me?"
"But that's— that's so…" Granger struggled for a moment before Draco decided to take pity on her.
"Relax," Draco muttered, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist and pulling him against his chest. Instead of relaxing, Harry squirmed against him, his legs wrapping against Draco's in the warm water.
"It is one of the Horcruxes, Harry?" Lovegood asked; she was standing beside him now, staring down at Umbridge as Harry pulled the locket away from her, holding it at arm's length as if he was afraid it would infect him.
"You lie."
"They've got my teacher at the place where it's hidden!" he called seconds before Snape's hand touched the door handle. Snape turned his face toward him, raising a single bewildered eyebrow.
in?" he said, and Draco flinched at the way his voice twisted on the you. As if it was so appalling that Draco was considered trustworthy to someone. "But they can't even tell me what's going on ever! And why didn't you tell me what was going on?" he snapped, flinging his hands in the air with such fury that Draco took a step away. "Why didn't you even tell me you were part of The Order? When did this even happen? All that bollocks about me deserving to know shite and you keep this from me?"
a new voice said, and Johnson collapsed against the ground, inches away from his ring. Harry turned toward the door, looking to face a very disgruntled looking Kingsley.
"Am I?" Lucius asked, raising an offended eyebrow that Harry ignored completely.
"No? Not even after you met a certain Malfoy?"
"Oh, right, good game," he answered distractedly, and Ginny patted his arm as she passed him by.
It worried him how far Harry had stepped back just because of Draco. He knew Harry loved Draco. He knew they were mated. But he also knew it just wasn't healthy to be so dependent on someone else. Harry needed to learn how to love himself instead of relying on someone else to do it for him.
"Snuffles?!" Hermione said. "Harry, why is si—" Her eyes flicked to Draco, whose eyes narrowed dangerously far. "Why is
He didn’t want Draco to touch him. He didn’t want Draco to help him or protect him or… McGonagall was dragging Marietta to her feet next to him. The Aurors, Fudge, and Umbridge were unconscious. He stumbled toward Dumbledore’s desk, Draco close at his back. Dumbledore was gone, and Harry felt confused, betrayed.
He saw Malfoy's muscle's tense but before he could do anything, Harry lunged forward and tackled him. Malfoy let out a weak yelp at his body collided with the ground, but then he kicked back at Harry. They rolled over each other, exchanging punches between them.
"Have you slept, Severus?" he asked, making Severus blinked slowly, turning back to Lucius with a twisted smile.
"Yes," he said slowly. "It does."
“So, you’ve experience panic attacks?” the healer—Harry didn’t bother to remember her name—asked him. It seemed like a stupid question to him. Of course, he experienced panic attacks. Why else was he here?
"Why wouldn’t you have a choice?” Draco answered, turning and stepping up closer to Harry. He was close enough that Harry had to tilt his head up to look Draco in the face.
“What?”
"No one could have stopped them!"
curses had done its work on him, but he didn’t feel like telling Draco anything except the most desperate.
He was not broken. He
“It’s sweet,” he said.
"I didn't lie, Draco. I-."
"Yes, well," Harry turned his head away, his flush darkening, and then he was turning and walking the rest of the way down the corridor. He stopped in front of the Defense classroom, looked back at Draco, and then slipped inside. Draco sighed and followed him.
"Harry," Weasley's face was red as he stared at Draco, his eyes flashing in a rather unattractive way. "What are you doing with him?" There was a long, tense moment where Weasley waited for an answer, and Harry just looked back at him. His lips were twisted in a sneer, his hands clenched down at his sides, but the light in his eyes was out.
were anything to go by. Draco had ignored them all; his father would give him hell for that when he got home, but Draco was of the firm belief that a summer beating was inevitable no matter
"He would have had access to it," Severus said, following Lucius' thought process easily. "We didn't exactly lock it up."

the battle of wills that passed between them, but he was determined not to lose.
"You didn't see him last night," Draco snapped. "We can't keep opening his mind like we are."
"You've already been through two full moons, I'm sure you have an idea of what to expect. Why come to me now?"
"Draco, what?" she asked, stopping her song mid-word.
"You never believed in him," Lucius answered, his eyes cast far away, not seeing Severus. "You only joined the Death Eaters because of Evans."
Thanks for all the comments!
"Yeah," Draco had answered, wondering vaguely if Lupin knew how unhelpful that was or if he really thought he was being comforting.
"I care," Harry answered, feeling as if it was the right answer.
"Indeed," Severus said. "Now, I expect you both every Monday at 6 o'clock in my office. If anyone asks Potter is taking Remedial Potions and Mr. Malfoy is assisting him with them." Severus didn’t wait before he swept from the room, his cloak snapping behind him.
"I've spoken to a couple of people," Lupin answered, ignoring Lucius' glare. "The Order is pulling as much of its weight as it can, but I'm not sure the Ministry will ignore everyone in Hogwarts knowing about him."
"Slughorn saw me perform a Bat-Bogey Hex on Zacharias Smith. He kept asking me what happened at the Ministry, and I finally couldn't take it any longer. Slughorn came in and instead of giving me detention, he told me what a good hex it was and invited me to this lunch." Her eyes widened dramatically. "I didn't realize there would be so many famous people here though."
"For Merlin’s sake, Potter," he said. "You couldn't just stay hidden. You
"What?"
And he hated that he was having to ask for help now.
"Deal with the Ministry," Lupin's eyes sharpened. "How do you mean?"
"I didn't want to leave you," Harry interrupted, and though his voice was soft, and his face blushed bright red when he said it, his eyes never left Draco's.
has ulterior motives."
“From now on, you ask
"Mr. Malfoy." Lupin answered, his voice surprisingly level. "You know very well why I look sickly. And you also know very well that the same thing will happen every month to your son. There is no need-."
"I requested to speak with Potter alone," Severus said, leveling his dark gaze at Sirius Black.
"I'm not sure what you're insinuating," Severus narrowed his eyes.
“I should go after her,” Dean sighed, taking the time to pack up before he followed.
“You said…” Harry said, still staring at him with those wide green eyes.
see that.
"You're shagging Pansy," she asked, covering her mouth as if the idea appalled her as much as it did him.
"I think we all understand the basics of Occlumency and Legilimecy, isn't that correct, Potter?" Draco asked, ignoring Severus completely. Harry nodded and then hesitated, obviously conflicted on whether he should ask his question of not. "Just ask Potter," Draco said, resisting the urge to sigh.
"The magic," he asked. "Is it still intact?"
It stopped as abruptly as it started, and Harry was looking back at Draco without even a smile on his face. The seriousness on his face left Draco with the horrible fascination of what he would look like if he did smile, because Draco had certainly never seen it before, and he was just beginning to realize how much he would like to.
"Oh, yes!" Dobby nodded his head vigorously. "Draco Malfoy was always kind to Dobby, unlike…" His eyes widened, and he looked around as if searched for something to punish himself with.
"How are you?" Lupin said, making Draco’s eyes snap back to him.
"You know who I'm talking about."
"I just-."
"That makes sense," Harry answered, paying no attention to Draco's distress or Severus' hard stare. "Werewolves aren't usually violent toward animals in general. He would have just wanted me out of the way."
"Suit yourself, then," he said, though he still went to Severus' dark potions bag and pulled out two potions, setting set them on Draco's bedside table before sitting back down beside him.
"I know," Severus answered. He sighed, finally looking over at Lucius. He could tell by the other man's expression that he'd been waiting for Severus to do just this since beginning of the conversation.
"That was a joke, right?"
So, Lupin had helped him. He'd tutored him and talked to him and listened to him in a way that no one else ever had. And all the while Lupin had known that Sirius Black—the man that could have been his salvation—was right outside the castle. He'd known, and he'd looking him straight in the eyes and Lupin had lied. He should have listened when Snape told him not to trust Lupin.
He was dreading going back to Hogwarts. And as it turned out, rightly so. Professor Snape had to leave three days before he did, which didn't relieve any of the anxiety he had worked up over his return.
"He can't," Harry said. Voldemort hesitated, his face half turning.
"I hadn't thought…" Potter muttered, as if this was new information for him. Blaise figured his tiny brain was probably still processing the new information.
a voice that sounded suspiciously like Draco's sounded in his mind and Harry only had time to raise his wand before pain rocketed through his body, sending him to the ground.
that. Could he?
“We need to deal with the ministry.”
It was the kind of smile he was so used to running from.
someone to step outside and curse him. Probably that's exactly what he wanted. As long as it was Harry. As long as Harry looked at him again.
"He might know what's going on with Nott," Severus answered, though even he didn't really know what he was looking for. He just knew there was something going on, something he was missing. He didn't know why he wanted to confront Lupin—it had just been the look in Lupin's eyes when he'd found out what they were doing.
The last thought Draco had before passing out was that he hoped his father would come soon, because Narcissa had never been good at healing charms.
There were exceptions to the rules, however. The Slytherins hated him, no matter how hard he tried, they would sneer and turn their backs on him. Severus Snape especially was no fan of the name Harry Potter. He picked on him in class, in the hall, took off points without reason, and always made a point of telling him just how useless he really was.
suspicious is going on?"
"You have people depending on you," Severus had answered. "You can't give up because if you give up, the rest of the world dies with you."
When they got off the train, the horn blowing for the final time over their heads, Draco was waiting for them. He looked the same as he had the last time Blaise had seen him. The same and different. Same silver-grey eyes, blonde hair, sharp features, except he looked older now. More mature.
"We'll talk later," Draco answered, still following behind Harry, who apparently wasn't about to wait for him.
"I'm sorry, Draco," he said, his smile falling. He sat heavily on the end of his bed. Draco waved his hand dismissively and sat opposite him.
"Now, Draco," Theodore scolded, stepping right up into his personal space. "Are you sure you want to do that." His eyes flicked back to the Slytherins standing behind him, smiling and looking brutish. "It's funny," Theodore's smile widened, raising his hands to grab hold of Draco's school robes. Draco tried to wiggle away but Vincent and Greg were suddenly there, taking hold of him, slamming him back and against the wall. "Pansy and I have been waiting ages to get you alone, so we could have our way with you." Draco felt himself swallow nervously, getting ready for the beating that was sure to occur.
"It's
Dumbledore dropped them off at Grimmauld Place, tapping on the door and smiling. He'd already told Harry he'd be having private lessons with him this year. Which didn't exactly make him feel any less apprehensive. Sirius opened the door almost immediately after he knocked, wrapping Harry in a hug and casting Draco a surprised look that quickly shifted to something closer to distrust.
"I wasn't hungry," he answered, and he should really stop grinding his teeth together because they were beginning to hurt.
In fact, Harry hadn't made any progress with Draco since the Hogsmeade trip and it had been nearly a week, but it was hard to talk to someone when they appeared to have no interest in even looking at you. And that was when they were around. Besides, the fact that every time he saw Draco it was like a pit opened up in the middle of his stomach, making him want to scream. What was he supposed to say? He wasn't sorry.
"Well, Harry, Draco," Dumbledore hummed, eyes sparkling. "We've trespassed on Horace's hospitality quite long enough, I think; perhaps it's time for us to leave."
strong.
As soon as they were gone, Harry relaxed. It was strange thing to watch. Draco supposed Harry never truly relaxed, but he did exist in degrees of tension, and his degree of tension went down about three clicks once Granger and Weasley were out of sight.
"Yeah."
“No, you’re not,” Severus said. He leaned back in his chair, gaze sharp on his face, and Harry suddenly knew he wasn’t about to like what Severus was going to say. “You avoid my questions, and even when you do say something, I never know what to do with it. I’m sure I hurt you twice as much as help you.”
"Draco,” Harry said, pulling away. Draco let his forehead fall onto Harry’s shoulder, the walls spinning dizzyingly around him. This was such a bad idea. “Please, Draco.” Harry’s hips pressed forward, still half-naked. Such a bad idea. “I want you, Draco.”
"Sir-," Zabini started, but Harry just rolled his eyes, whipping his wand out.
to love you, Harry Potter." He felt himself wrench, the pain in his mind diminishing almost completely. "But fuck you, I do, and I don't know how to keep going if you let yourself be taken over by
Harry turned away first with a quick jerk of his head, which left Draco staring at his face like the love struck fool he was. Hermione nudged him, Draco turned his face away, his cheeks hot.
"I've been sitting here for almost 5 minutes and you've not said anything to me." Blaise smirked, still staring. “Aren’t at least going to ask me what I want?”
"Oh, look," Harry interrupted. "The carriage has stopped." He flung open the door, leaving Granger and Weasley in the carriage to sort out their feeling. He figured he now had a good excuse for ignoring them if nothing else.
along, acting like his typical irritating superior self, arrogant and full of himself like always, easily destroying the peaceful feeling surrounding the tree. The only seemingly possible way to pop Lest’s infuriating ego was to throw something at him and Qye only regretted the acorn wasn’t larger.
dreams?” Ron managed to choke out through his hilarity, holding onto Harry’s shoulder for support.  The laughter doubled as Harry just stared confusedly at him.
“Lest, aren’t you coming?” Hermione interrupted the other Gryffindor, turning her bright smile to the silent vampire. “It’ll be getting dark soon and I’m sure dinner’s going to start, maybe Harry’s already there - ”
,’ Harry thought, watching as the blond vampire lifted her goblet to drink.  ‘
’ she thought to herself firmly.  ‘
’ he grimaced ‘–
“I was right about you being ill,” she repeated, her blue eyes looking at the small black-haired boy in concern. “You looked a little pale to me. Why haven’t you gone to the Infirmary?”
Verna said nothing, resuming her knitting and Jordan felt his cousin’s anger rising.
Harry resisted every urge to open a conversation, ask him for help about vampires, tell him that he missed their times at the library tables.  He sometimes found himself absently touching his lips as he studied his notes and hastily put it down while Ron and Hermione pretended not to notice.  Well, Hermione pretended.  Ron just got a very flat look on his face and wrote his notes harder.
“What do you mean he’s gone?” Ron yelped.
"But," the female vampire continued, spreading her hands, "it's not like I'm going to let you duel without giving you a bit more information on how exactly we duel." She turned slightly and gestured for her brother to come forward, which he silently did, to the front of her desk. "I"m going to give you a very brief introduction on the fighting styles of vampires. I'll elaborate more later but right now I just want you to pay close attention and grasp a basic understanding.
.” She spat out the last word as if it had a foul taste.
he would finish it.
“It did not complete,” sighed Dumbledore as he wearily looked at the unconscious figures.  “Mr. Malfoy’s spell interrupted the incantation but what did form…how does it look?”
"You have to know, however," Harry cleared his throat, torn between being annoyed and amused with Qye, "that they're not really my type." He picked up his fork and started in on his fully-served plate - courtesy of Hermione - while giving a quick meaningful look around.
-------
He didn’t see the blue eyes of the vampire turning to look at his back as he left the Great Hall.  He didn’t see the weighing, considering look in them.
Qye tried.
Lest raised an eyebrow.  “What do you mean?”
' he thought, slightly relieved.  He opened his mouth to tell Snape this. . .
"She didn't really say anything."
The fire started in his throat and then spread down into his chest and spiraled through his lungs and pumping its way through his veins and up into his head, engulfing his mind in burning molten lava that was making its way down into his fingertips and toes.
"We'll have to do a good job on her memories," Severus said, ignoring both Harry and Lovegood completely. "She said they were pretty sure they knew who'd broken into Azkaban and Gringotts. They must have proof."
"Clue me in…"
“Potter was never… He was never timid toward me.”
“Nothing is wrong with me,” Draco snapped. He started to step away, and anger shot through Harry. “I just want you to leave me alone.”
"We could pretend to be visiting," Luna said abruptly, pointing down. Sure enough, there was a little black stone walkway on the island that lead into the prison. It had a couple brooms hovering next to it and was suspiciously devoid of Dementors. Harry shrugged, already directing his Thestral down.
"Yes," Draco said, jerking his chin up. "No thanks to either of you."
"I didn't know you and Lucius were so close?" Severus managed to keep the jealousy out of his voice, but it was swept away the next second as Harry turned his head away, and Severus saw the red blush that tinted across his cheekbones.
"Potter has a tendency to break everything he touches. You fall for him and it might just be the last thing you end up doing,” Severus said, and Draco opened his mouth to protest but found he couldn’t. He didn’t know how to argue with something he’d already warned himself of.
"Tonight," Harry answered. "I'll stay with you." He turned and started to leave, snarling over his shoulder as he went. "That's what you wanted, wasn't it?"
say it.
"Draco!" Harry gasped, pulling away from Ron and standing. His head spun, and he almost hit the ground again, but he managed to stay standing, walking unsteadily toward the entrance to the warehouse.
“Alright,” Harry said.
"Watch your tone-."
Harry lunged, his claws digging into a nearby tree trunk as he climbed up and then over on the branch. And then he jumped over to the next tree, continuing on through the forest. He could still hear Draco growling under him, following him under the branches as he went.
"Occlumency helps everyone, even people who
"You're not even trying," Severus snapped, his limited patience finally breaking. Draco winced, wishing Severus had a different teaching technique than yelling. Not that he strictly blamed him; he was tired. What with pretending to be the Dark Lord's lapdog, appeasing Draco's parents, dealing with the Order, teaching potions, and trying to help Potter in his free time. Draco wondered just how long it would take Severus to snap.
understand. His cheeks were pale—gaunt, deep bags under his eyes, his hair a mess, and it took Harry much too long to realize that Draco was crying.
"On purpose," Harry answered, and he exchanged a look with Severus that Draco didn't understand. "It makes sense."
"Better than being alone? Gee, let me think."
"Why don't we just fly out?" Luna asked, and Blaise and Potter turned toward her. "The Thestrals, Harry," she clarified, and Potter blinked at her as if he'd just realized what she was talking about, though Blaise still had no idea.
"I was just heading to my first class, Professor," Harry answered.
"Draco is
"No," Severus answered. "I suppose, it doesn't."
So sorry for the long break. Hopefully we are back up and running!
," Draco said, his lip curling up even further, and Hermione elbowed him.
"Ah," Hermione's said, her smile widening, and Harry was beginning to wonder if he should be watching her wand. "So, you're not only leading her on but sending Draco mixed signals."
"So," she said, straightening up and folding her hands in front of her, she smiled cheerfully at them, "That is why today you will duel against my brother."
The students watched nervously as she raised a cool pale eyebrow.
"Merlin, if the
There was no knowing when the fallout of all this information being unloaded on Black would end.
’ Ron thought as he grimly raised his wand and started shifting his feet.
“Losing a day of your memory is still pretty worrisome,” Professor Opacre pointed out worriedly.
“Verna Zabar,” she said in her elderly voice, brushing her gray hair out of her brown face, her black eyes on the knitting.  “Representative of the Zabar family of vampires from South America, who are the next-in-line to be the Head family of the South American vampires.  Elder for the Zabar family of vampires, whose Heads are my son, Juan Zabar, and his wife, Maria Zabar.  Loyal to the Opacre family of vampires and on the side of the Opacres, as we will always be,” she finished, never looking up.
As he left the passage, numbly heading for the Great Hall, he didn’t see the figures following behind him.
“I’m not - ” he began to protest but to his surprise, the silent redhead cut him off.
“What was stupid,” Qye hissed back, “was me trusting you.”
Snape stayed in the waiting room, glowering after the vampires for a moment before turning his black eyes back at the room where the Potter boy lay. He narrowed his eyes slightly and pursued his lips. After a moment, without removing his eyes, he said, “He’ll be fine, Draco.”
.’ He glanced at the vampire, who still wasn’t looking at any of them, cool and and distant once more.
-----
Malfoy growled, grabbed the carefully shredded mint leaves lying right in front of Harry and jerkily shoved them towards the shorter boy. Harry meekly took them and sprinkled them into his potion, which immediately turned a blood red. Glancing up at Malfoy, he saw the Slytherin still scowling at him.
Harry retched again, the sound echoing throughout the bathroom.
Harry ignored the stab of guilt and took a deep breath as he put down his tart.  “After the O.W.L.s.”
He was on his fifth count of 10, his hands pushing hard against the stone, when Harry spoke again.  “What do you figure is going to happen tomorrow?”
“Damn it all, answer me, Lest!” she snarled.  She threw the exams to the floor as she stormed around her desk, her blue eyes flashing angrily.  “Ever since you’ve come here you’ve been nothing but cryptic and troublesome!  You tell me nothing for all your talk that you’ve made decisions!  You sit here and stare angrily at the walls and do nothing!”
“Are…are you feeling okay, Harry?” Granger asked hesitantly, eyes uncertain and confused.
“This is what I saw,” she said eagerly as Harry slowly pulled it closer to him, glancing down.  He immediately frowned when he saw that it was a potion but Hermione continued, unmindful of his sudden tension.  “It’s a potion that the mists in the pensieve were theoretically based on.  Unlike an actual pensieve, however, it works by extracting the full memory instead of a copy.”
“Snape favors Malfoy?” the vampire asked silkily.
“Should we?” said Leon Hastai quietly, his pale brown eyes looking at Jacob with his usual serious expression.  “So many have died in this war…so many families have been broken, so many old ways. Do you honestly think we should celebrate?”
:: he frowned.  ::
:: he frowned.  ::
“There are other reasons as well,” Lest said, turning his eyes away suddenly. “Once I tell them, they’ll understand.”
?:: Harry mumbled at the other and he could hear them laugh softly.  He shifted in his bed, squirming to get in a better position, when a new thought came to him.
“Did we?  I was at Norway, that was - ”
Qye said, voice preoccupied, trying to remember something.
“What?”
Lest clenched his jaw and broke his gaze to meet his sister’s.
"Selene gave light so that humans would not live in constant fear of the darkness, unable to discern what lay within it." A small, wry smile graced the vampire's lips. She shook her head slightly and continued. "Helene decided to give the precious stones to the humans, the stones that were the beauty of the Moon. The stones fell to the Earth and the humans ran to the falling rocks to embrace the gift of the Goddess. All were ignorant of the different ways of the Moon and Earth, particularity gravity's ways.
“It almost feels wrong to just heal it,” Potter answered, looking down at his scarred hand. “As if I’m forgetting what the ministry is capable of.”
"I really like you, Harry," she murmured, her lips maybe an inch away from his. And he thought, maybe-just maybe-he could fall in love with her if he really tried. She was pretty and smart and talented and good at Quidditch—
"Anyway," Hermione said. "Harry's only with Malfoy because he threw himself at Harry, and Harry was sure he couldn't have you, so he just went with it."
"A little," he said, sighing as he made his way over to them. She gave him a speculative glance, pushing her work to the side in favor of studying him.
"No," Umbridge answered. "I am handling this."
"What happened, Professor?" Draco asked, moving forward to get a better look at Montague. The former Quidditch Captain was looking around in a daze, gazing at the floor with furrowed eyebrows as if he didn't recognize what he was looking at.
"What exactly are you talking about?” Malfoy answered, his voice colored with anger. He shoved himself off the wall, straightening out his robes.
"Yes, well. Lupin isn't exactly the most trustworthy of people," Harry answered, and Draco looked back at him, his silver-grey eyes shining.
"Severus Snape."
"It appears that instead of killing you, the curse that the Dark Lord cast when you were a baby has forged a kind of bond between the two of you." Severus' lips curled as he began to pace. Draco wasn't sure how he moved, he could barely breathe past the very idea of the Dark Lord crawling around inside Harry's mind and—
"No."
"So?"
"Seriously, mate," Ron said, finally managing to swallow his bacon. "You need to decide who you want."
Harry stopped about a foot away from him, his head coming up in time to fix Draco with a venomous glare. He returned it, holding the snarl between his lips. They stood across from each other for a long minute, Draco dying to yell and scream and get in Harry's face but knowing it wouldn't do any good.
“Where are you going?”
only ever what he could give them.
"What happened in there?" Draco whispered, looking around to make sure they were alone.
"No need to become hysterical, Potter," Severus interrupted, standing from behind his desk. "I will go immediately. Draco, if you will watch over Potter while I'm away." Severus cast him a meaningful look, before sweeping out of the room.
"What?" he demanded.
"Do you remember the detention we went to the forest to help Hagrid and I almost died?" Harry asked.
"You know that's not true," Draco answered, shifting and narrowing his eyes, and Harry could sense the frustration standing just on the other side of Draco's control. "Harry, talk to me. If no one else, talk to me."
"Is he even gay?"
"Because I'm telling you to care," Severus answered, sending Harry a scowl. "Now cease your attitude immediately, Potter."
Blaise didn’t understand what Luna saw in Ginny anymore. Sure, she was pretty but it was about the twentieth time she’d complained about her boyfriend to them, and he was beginning to wonder if she was just pretending to be stupid or if she really was just this dense.
"Around," Lucius waved his hands vaguely. "Now, come over here, Severus." He hesitated, debating the chance of Lucius just leaving him alone if he refused. Then, he sighed, giving in to the older boy. He stood and cross the small space to sit about a foot away from him, looking determinately at the wall. Lucius sighed, closing the distance between them and placing an arm across his shoulder. He immediately tensed. He didn't understand. Lucius was always touching him like this, but he simply couldn't understand why. What did he want? "Why do you always act like I'm going to do something terrible when I touch you?" Lucius asked, his voice soft, almost sweet against his ear. He tensed further, his whole-body shivering as Lucius' lips brushed against his earlobe.
to let the school know what he was. It simply isn’t right to just let him wander around-.”
"No!" Harry tried to sit up, gasping out a startled hiss of pain as he did. "We can't leave."
"Are you alright?" Draco asked softly, his thumb skimming across Harry's knuckles.
it. He had gone without letting himself open to being hurt by others for so long, he felt open, exposed, venerable every time he thought someone was just a little too close.
"I want you to turn Harry Potter over to the Dark Lord."
He stopped abruptly in front of Ginny, smiling when she did. He was vaguely surprised she wasn't in a corner somewhere lip-locked with Dean. He'd caught them snogging more than once. It had been a rather strange sight, catching him more off guard than he truly wanted to admit.
"Because he
“But you don’t,” Draco said.
"Is this going somewhere?" Draco asked. He sighed heavily, closing his book with a snap.
"I could never do that," Harry answered, reaching out on impulse.
"Oh, for goodness' sake," Hermione grumbled before she turned to Ron. "How has
"Tell me, Harry," Malfoy said, his voice just as tender as his smile. "Tell me how you want it."
"It's just the Cruciatus," Potter said finally. "Voldemort must have been angry." Severus flinched away from the name, his eyes fluttering. Potter looked at Severus for a moment before standing and crossing the room to begin digging around in Severus' potions bag.
"When you thought you needed to hide your real feelings for Lucius? You lost contact for how long before he was married?"
"No offense or anything, Malfoy. I mean, I know you're sleeping with the man-."
tolerate it."
"Why would I ask if I didn't want to know?" Draco answered, feeling the frustration creeping over him, and Harry was just looking back at him, his green eyes narrowed and thoughtful. "Are you going to tell me now that you've established I have no ulterior motive?" he asked, and when Harry shook his head, he sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. He heard Harry shuffle beside him and reached out, clasping Harry's hand in his before he could run off.
"Eventually," Severus answered.
"Next time," he said. "Tell me." Malfoy just shrugged.
"Yes," Draco interrupted. "You can leave now."
"I guess it's worth a shot," Harry shrugged. "Not like we have anything else to do."
Like he could just turn to a stranger and moan about all his problems. As if Severus could just expect him to do something so absurd. Because even though Severus had said he could still talk to him, the message had been clear—from the look in his eyes to the way he’d said the words.
"How could you?!" Severus bit out, his voice loud and echoing in the small classroom. "How could you have taken Harry and just-."
He stopped as Smethwyck pulled out his wand and carefully kept it at his side, meeting the vampire’s eyes unflinchingly.
Qye trembled, horrified.
As she unrolled the attendance roll, Marylin Opacre subtly looked at one of the pair of eyes, eyes that belonged to a particular student she knew she would have problems with.  Draco Malfoy was scowling deeply at her, anger clear in his quicksilver eyes and she could feel the fury roll off him in great amounts.  As she picked up her quill, she absently thanked her mother for teaching her in early childhood how to read the feelings that emitted from the living and how to minimize their effects.  She doubted she would have gotten this far if she hadn’t learned that particular trick.
I began "Qye" at FFN.net about a decade ago. Uploading it here now and once its all caught up to where it left off at FFN.net, I will begin to post the new finished chapters as well.  This was written with ignoring OoTp canon onwards, although I might include a few things.  Hope readers, old and new, enjoy!
But Qye had never done that before. Harry furrowed his brows. Well, never when he was awake. Qye had always been alert in his mind whenever he was conscious, sometimes quiet and just watching from behind his eyes and other times relaxed and reading his memories. He never recalled Qye ever feeling like this before.
“Harry?”
“With you, I’m not surprised,” Hermione said sweetly, eyes flashing.  Ron glowered at her before taking off his prefect badge and polishing it slightly before buttoning it back on again.  They had been made prefects of Gryffindor House and even though he complained about it, Harry often saw the pride in his blue eyes when he looked at his badge.  He had been thrilled to see his best friends become prefects although he had also felt a pang of loneliness.  They both now had new responsibilities and he felt like he was slightly on a different level than theirs sometimes.  But they were still his best friends and he wouldn’t let something as stupid as positions get in the way of their friendship, or anything else for that matter.
“Remus.”
Five years of memories locked away, a whole other part of his personality that he had never known before.  Five years of experiences and thoughts, decisions that he never knew about.
“I’m just wondering,” she responded.  She nodded over at the pile of letters in his lap.  “People are starting to wonder why you are staying here so long.  After all, it’s my job to be here, not yours.”
One of the Death Eaters laughed, low and mean, as the leash was let loose.
Letting out a frustrated breath, Harry dropped his head back on his pillow and closed his eyes.
He had arrived a few minutes before four, thinking he would apologize again for his strange request, agree to whatever she provided first and make any necessary modifications later on his own.
Harry’s eyes widened.  Qye felt stunned.
Qye growled.
“I’m just making sure I’m not going to suddenly find myself on the other end of a Weasley product,” Zabini pointed out.
Qye said quietly in the lull of battle. Over the blood rushing in his ears Harry could faintly hear a buzz from the class and a murmur from Professor Opacre but his mind was too occupied, too filled with his worries about Qye and a vampire who
Voldemort stepped back, violence etched in every movement.
:: Qye replied defensively.  ::
His messy hair was still the same, the black locks falling into his face, shadowing his still-bright emerald eyes, gentle above a slender nose and a rosy, mouth curved into a natural pout.  His skin was no longer the pale cream it had once been but rather had a golden touch on it, as if he spent more time out in the open.  The boyish looks were gone, replaced with a youthful face that was growing up.  The young face, however, still retained that mature-beyond-his-years look that his boyish face had.
Jordan shook his head in exasperation.  “Jacob,” he began in his most calming tone of voice before his hotheaded twin got into a fight with the head of the Hastai family.  His twin’s red hair matched his fiery disposition and Jordan once again thanked all the gods and goddesses that he wasn’t next in line to be head of the Taine family.  That happy title landed on their older sister, Natalie Taine.
Unstable, the book had said.  Side effects.  And what was it Qye – he – had said earlier? Vampires and wizards had never mixed, who knew what the results would be.
They sat in silence, much as they had this past week as revelation after revelation was thrown at them.  The rooms the Headmaster had given them were close to the rooms that only Smethwyck and Madam Pomfrey visited daily, carefully bordered with magical wards courtesy of the Headmaster and the vampire guard now on the outside of the wing instead of that corridor Sirius and Remus had only walked once.
“I don’t make it a habit of ordering my mother to do anything, Black,” Lest snapped sharply, lips thinning.  “She - ”
In her stunned disbelief, she watched Harry’s green eyes glare, his lips pulled back in contempt.
“Yeah…well…” he mumbled, bringing out his wand. “I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
Harry glared at the Slytherin and folded his arms, scowling.  “Thanks for the heart attack.”
But right now it was seriously ticking him off.
– and blinked as red and brown-haired heads popped themselves through the entrance of his room.
And then he lowered his wand.
A minute passed where they stood, barely hidden in the alley next to Scrivenshift’s, the faint sounds of other Hogwarts students heading to the dance in the distance.
,’ he thought shakily, fumbling for his training.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow.  “Now why would I do something like that?” he drawled, dropping his hand and leaning back in his chair, his knee propped up against the table.  “I would have no one left to torment.”
“Voldemort…he…” Harry swallowed and swayed slightly as he sat on the hard, freezing floor. “He…there was this man…he was wearing Muggle clothing…they…these two things…” Harry shivered and brought his knees up, laying his head down on them, his hands gripping his hair. He felt Dumbledore lay a comforting hand on his shoulder as the memory came back to him.
“Do me a favor, Potter?”
Harry closed his eyes and sighed.
“Yell a little louder, why don’t you, Hermione?” Seamus grumbled, glancing around the corridor. “And I’m always a little behind in the class anyway so it’s not like it matters or anything.” He shuddered. “I’d hate to think what I’d be like without it.”
“Lest?” Marylin called out hesitantly, carefully closing the door to her rooms behind her.
He sighed and slumped onto the pillows. ‘
The room was silent.
“I was about to ask the same thing,” the Slytherin said lightly.  He looked back at Draco and tilted his head.  “Anything to say, Draco?”
There was silence.
After Dumbledore had left, Qye had dutifully attended to the breakfast he was provided, a bowl of oatmeal with various types of berries and a glass of orange juice along with a muffin with peach marmalade.
Qye’s glare darted briefly from the wall to his eyes before looking back at the wall.
“I told you to not disrupt my class, Professor,” he heard Snape sneer maliciously.  “You can be sure that I shall be making a point of this…incident…at the next staff meeting.”
“Did you just put down simeonwert as one of the ingredients?”
“Good,” she said, her eyes twinkling.  She looked around the class and her smile broadened when she noticed that more and more students were beginning to loosen up around her.  “Any more questions?” she asked, beaming at the class.  A boy on the left side of the room, Blaise Zabini, raised his hand.  “Yes?”
:: he shouted back at the other one, trying to shove away the voice.  His body shuddered and he squeezed his eyes even more.  He knew he was at the edge of hysteria – maybe he was already there - but god, there was a voice inside his head and he wanted it out and  –
- and jerked as he realized the Slytherin was gone.
“Same thing I’ve been doing all week, Qye,” the Healer said absently as he ran his wand down Harry’s side, carefully lifting his arm and bending it like he had the other side.  “Making sure neither one of you is on the verge of getting me knocked around by the army of people asking me about you every day.”
The blow came again and he cried out again, shuddering and shivering and whimpering and hurting and gods it bloody
Qye rolled his eyes and fell back on his back as the Healer repeated the same explanation he had the first time they had to take the array of potions.  At least they were weaning down to only every six-hour doses instead of the hour ones they had started with at the beginning.
Why else would you be messing up Harry’s trunk even more?” she sniffed and he looked ruefully at Harry’s scattered materials.
"What?" Seamus said loudly, finally coming out of his cowering and looking incredulously at her. "What does that mean? How are you - "
He looked up as Snape stalked over to his table, his black robe billowing behind him.
“I’m their Prince," Draco responded loftily. "They may grumble, rumor, hiss, disapprove, call for my beheading and all that rubbish but in the end, I'm still the Prince and they're still plebeians."
“That was a slip of tongue and a mistake,
:: the other boy laughed softly, his first words since the encounter.  The words were full of fond remembrance and deep relief.  Harry was momentarily puzzled by the emotions but the situation at hand distracted him from thinking about them further.
The tree yelped.
The Pater Nosferatu looked around the table before saying quietly, “Dumbledore, the
Harry nodded silently, stuffing his hands inside his jeans as he walked into the place where he had been raised.
Qye interrupted.
Jonas blew out a breath and rubbed at his face roughly, his collected mask breaking for a moment before it firmed up and he dropped his hands again, looking at them all.
He raised his hand and idly rubbed the wrist Malfoy had grabbed.  It still felt slightly warm from the touch.  ‘
Draco was silent for a moment.  “My father…with the Dark Lord’s rise came back the thought of entertaining relations with vampires.  Nothing my mother said would dissuade him.  She made me go to the Venators almost as soon as I got back home, tried to keep me away.  And I wasn’t even really thinking about it while I trained with them.  It was just my mother being overprotective as usual, I thought.  Yes, the vampires were annoying but they hardly mattered.  They were never going to be a part of our world.  Surely the Dark Lord, with his value on blood purity, would never enter into such a deal.”
------
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco frowned.
As even more memories flooded back to him, he mentally cursed the damned vampire he was lying on top of. Before he could stop himself, forgetting to do what he normally did and pause and think of the consequences, Qye found himself lifting up slowly, raising his head, full of annoyance.
“Severus, what is going on?” Remus said slowly, uncertainly, looking back and forth between the Potions Master and the vampire woman.
“Mr. Weasley?” she gasped, her eyes widening and hand falling to her side. “Ms. Granger?”
He silently poured himself some pumpkin juice, avoiding his friends’ eyes.  Already he was beginning to feel the guilt of snapping at Hermione.  ‘
------
Apparently his cousin thought so too.  “Watch yourself, Leon,” he said coldly, glaring icily at the older man.  “You may be older than me and friend of my father but remember that I outrank you in every way.  Don’t question me or make me remind you why I outrank you.”  Leon lowered his eyes and the Head of the Opacres looked at him hard for a few more moments before nodding.
“No more than you do, Finnegan,” Blaise Zabini replied coolly, standing behind Draco -
,’ he thought fretfully as they left the elevator, his escort stiffening as they passed one of them.
A hand dropped on one of his and tangled with his fingers.
Harry stared as his plate filled up with bacon, eggs and toast, swallowing something back that tasted as bad as the smell of the food was making him feel. Funny…he
“Don’t,” Draco said in a low voice, his eyes burning into Harry’s.  “I can easily slip back into my role of being an asshole, fighting and squabbling over the littlest of things.”  The hand that still grasped Harry’s arm tightened before letting go and falling to his side.  “I had rather thought you might have matured a little and would like the ceasefire, considering your situation.  But I’ll be the little nuisance if it’ll make you feel better.”  Draco tilted his head, his eyes cool.  “Is that what you want?”
“Lest said I should guide you out,” the young man said, his voice carrying a faint foreign accent as he took a step forward.  Harry stiffened as he caught the flash of fanged teeth.  “If you would - ”
" - on your sixth life with only three more to go!" The other twin finished, grinning as he took a drink.
“Yeah,” Sirius whispered, the wildness in his eyes settling, blinking rapidly.  “Yeah, I’m going to be here.”
There was heat everywhere. Flames licked at his skin, embers burned beneath his skin and he could feel each drop of sweat roll down feverishly with no offer of respite.
“What do you think of him, Lest?” Marylin asked quietly.
“I believe we should agree with Healer Smethwyck’s plan for now,” the older wizard said and Qye leaned away from him, warily eyeing him staring down at the group of adults.  He narrowed his eyes when ancient blue eyes turned to him and glared as he felt Harry stiffen next to him.  Those eyes shifted down to Harry and he saw how they grew more thoughtful.  “I will write a letter to the Minister, Jonas.  Naturally, due to the circumstances, he will have to come here for the update.”
Lest jerked and took another step forward, his breath rapid enough for her to hear.
The vampire surged backwards, crashing onto the ground and sliding several yards away.
:: Qye said abruptly and Harry blinked drowsily, coming back from the edge of sleep.
’ he thought, grudgingly aware of the tinge of respect that inspired.
:: Harry suddenly found himself assaulted with Qye’s own pain and he spared a moment’s thought to wonder where it came from before it added to his own torment and he heard that lone, piercing scream in part of the world grow louder.
“Harry?” Draco said hoarsely, making the other teenager shiver and ache at the sound.  Emerald eyes watched with not a small touch of dismay as the heat in the silver eyes slowly began to fade away, confusion growing.  “Harry, what - ”
“What do you think, Pater Nosferatu?” Verna Zabar suddenly asked quietly from the rocking chair by the small fire, not looking up from her knitting.  Jordan looked at the elderly woman in confusion from beneath his golden fringe, his blue eyes blinking in puzzlement.
Finally, he heard the other boy sigh quietly. ::
“And I’m not even saying that I don’t understand,” Draco continued, his fingers flexing on the fence, knuckles turning white each time he squeezed.  “I’ve heard stories of the Dazains.  They’re well known for having the most rogues and consequently, the Venators have a large record on them.  Brutal and cruel with talent to make them dangerous.  But the Opacres aren’t any more innocent.  My cousin had been an innocent.  The people, the families there, had been innocent in their stupid war.  And he didn’t care.  When the Venators sent a follow up message, he told them to stay out of it.”  The wood creaked as Draco clenched his hands on it.  “He didn’t even apologize.”
Maybe Hermione had the right idea.  Ron really didn’t want to force Harry to tell them anything he didn’t want to but he didn’t think Harry should keep everything to himself.  It would get the smaller boy into trouble.  But Harry seemed to think like it was best, ignoring their attempts at trying to help.  Ron’s hand curled into a small fist and he inaudibly thumped it against the bedpost.  They were his best friends, damn it!  They just wanted to help.
“Er…” Harry said hesitantly, relaxing his hold on his quill and already reaching resignedly for his wand, “Yes?”
“Fine, what?” Qye said testily, glaring at him, still shaking with his anger.
“Hello, Severus,” he said wearily as he turned around to see the Potions Master striding towards them.  The man’s lips tightened but he surprisingly didn’t say anything else, merely glancing towards Draco.
“You’re still recommending having sessions with them, though,” Lupin broke in, his voice even as he looked up, concerned.
He jerked his head up, blinking as he looked at an exasperated and slightly concerned Hermione and a curious Ron.
“You should know I would have updated you if anything changed,” Marylin said abruptly, taking a step towards the teenager and raising her hand.  “Draco, I know things are - ”
’ he thought numbly.  He heard Remus walking away, most likely to take a quick shower before him and get rid of all traces of their drinking the night before like a responsible adult.  ‘
,’ Marylin silently said to herself, inwardly cheering as she watched some of the students begin to relax.  She hadn’t been lying when she had told them she wished to be friends with all of them or that being so serious wasn’t her way.  Well, mostly.  Over the years, since the beginning of the war, she had become more serious than she had usually been.  Still…that did not mean she liked being so reserved and quiet.  And she
:: Qye said sweetly. There was a pause as Harry struggled with the task of putting his clothes on properly. ::
Harry had glared at the bemused looking blonde.  “Are you blackmailing him?” he had asked suspiciously.
That was going to be his favorite meal for the rest of his life, he was sure.
“You should be more careful,” the vampire suddenly said, leaning against the table.  Harry gave a small start, glancing up at the still indifferent man.  His brow furrowed slightly and he unconsciously slowed his stirring.
Sighing, he gave up.  Dropping his hand from his head, he glanced at the clock on his bedside drawer.  It was just about the usual time he got up, albeit a bit earlier.  For a moment, he just sat in his bed and wondered whether or not he should stay for a bit longer.  He could find no reason to so he dragged himself out of his warm bed and stood up, walking over to his trunk to get out his uniform.
,’ Qye thought to himself as he collapsed against a wall in a deserted corridor. ‘
Shaking his head, he focused back to his current problem.
"Ah, but you know it, mate," Seamus winked at him from down the table.
He snapped its neck effortlessly, ignoring the heightened screams, just in time to see another run past him.
“I’m just missing today’s breakfast, Hermione,” he broke in, giving her a look.  “Just…I’ll catch up with you and Ron later, alright?”
“Keep to your magic, wizard, and let me do my work,” she said stiffly and stalked out of the room before he could say anything else.
“I’m sure he does,” she grinned.  He smiled at her, his spirits slightly heightened by her cheery air.  His smile faded and he glanced at the doorway again.
“Are you trying to decide who we are?” Harry broke in softly and Lest’s eyes shifted to him.  “You want to play with our memories again?  Maybe if you change our minds one more time, you’ll finally get what you want.”
Qye laughed hysterically.
Malfoy arched an eyebrow back.
“Charming,” Dean said wearily as he slumped down next to his friend.  “Just…utterly charming.”
:: Harry said back and he heard Qye murmur again before resuming his reading.  Harry once again thanked any merciful force in the world that Qye left him alone during his study sessions with Malfoy.  Unfortunately, the other boy chose to read his memories during these times and he had to deal with the consequences of Qye learning more and more about his life every time.
“Didn’t I tell you to not disrupt the students, Opacre?” a cold voice said behind Harry.
Harry blinked in surprise.  ‘
The door from Snape's office flew open and Harry ended his train of thought as the Potions Master swept into the room.  Taking roll quickly, he turned to the blackboard and tapped his wand on it, instructions appearing quickly.  He turned back to the class, his dark, black eyes glittering.
Qye said slowly.
“There’s not much of a next step if you thought that,” Harry said quietly.
’ a traitorous thought intruded into the dull static of his mind.  He blinked slowly and a trembling hand reached up and tugged at his hair, pulled at it, tried to ground himself in the upheaval of his world.
“Twitchy, aren’t you, Potter?” Malfoy said lazily, smirking as he rested his chin on one of his hands, his elbow on the table.  Harry glared at him, trying to control his rapid breathing.
“But - ” Sirius said, hesitant and unwilling to leave.  Remus stood and grabbed his elbow.
“Leaving so soon?” A soft voice asked quietly.
"Maybe you should listen to your girlfriend, Weasley," a cool voice said behind them.  "Merlin knows you'll need all the studying you can get."
Harry turned around and left, unsure if he was thankful or not that the blond didn’t say anything.
Once Ron and Hermione were thoroughly engrossed in their own studying, Harry subtly used his wand to copy the potion onto a blank piece of parchment, tucking it between Defense Against the Dark Arts notes.
Saira snorted.  “Yeah,” she said sarcastically.  “So long as we do the dirty work, right?”  She glared at the Pater.  “Please tell me you told him ‘hell no,’” she growled.
“Good, yer all ‘ere,” Hagrid said, beaming around at their class.  “Got a special treat for yer all today.  Thought might do a project with it fer the firs’ quarter.  Come on, somethin’ real good.”  He turned and began walking towards the Forbidden Forest, the apprehensive class following reluctantly.
Dark blue eyes turned to the small, flickering fire in the hearth, the eyes half-closed and looking half-asleep.  The few people who had seen him with these eyes no longer graced the world with their presence and a cold smile came upon his face as he recalled this.  The smile faded when another part of the memory came to him.
“Harry, are you okay?” Neville asked worriedly, grasping Harry’s other arm.  “What’s wrong?”
His voice seemed to bring Hermione out of her daze because her face firmed up and she waved her wand again, hand deft and brown eyes further determined.
------
“What?” he said blankly, looking back and forth between the Mind-Healer and the teenagers.  “That’s it? We didn’t even really get to talk.”
Hermione’s blue flames sent it screaming back.
Harry snorted and kicked at the thin grass at their feet.  “Right.  And since when does the great Draco Malfoy want a date with me?”  He gave the blond a look of his own.  “And don’t dodge this, I’m actually asking.”
Softly, he said, “You’re me.”
,’ he thought a bit dryly, his green eyes traveling over the Great Hall.  That’s when he noticed the other students.
“I’ve got this,” Ron said.  He glanced back at his dorm mates, shifting uncomfortably.  “Give us a moment?”
Before Harry could give his assent, a small book suddenly flew from Professor Opacre's desk, aimed right for Ron's wand hand. Harry sucked in his breath because if Ron lost his grip on his wand -
He shivered and dropped his hands from his face, wrapping his arms tightly around his middle.  “Who?” he asked quietly, his eyes tightly closed.
“I’m quite aware of that, thank you, Severus,” Opacre replied coolly from the doorway.
His eyes flew open and he gasped as he broke away.
“You’ve been dreaming about me, Potter?” Malfoy laughed softly.  “I’m flattered.”
“It’s okay,” he interrupted, forcing a smile.  “I know you didn’t mean it like that.”  Hermione looked at him worriedly and he looked down at his plate.
.’  She placed the tip of her quill on top of the cream-colored parchment, and then paused.
“I will say it as many times as I need to,” said a voice that was in every moment of his thoughts, his clearest recollection from late night talks, snarling arguments and helpless laughter.
:: he asked worriedly as he straightened everything up.  ::
“Really,” he tried to smile at them, a wince from a painful stab breaking it. He rubbed his forehead again. “Really, I’m f - ”
:: Harry asked incredulously.  Shock had filled him once more with the person’s disbelief in magic.  How was it possible that they were entangled with magic if they didn’t believe it existed?
“It’s shit like that,” Qye said tightly, rubbing his hand, “that they’re going to try to take advantage of.”  He dropped his hands and stared hard at Harry.  “Or have you changed your mind?”
The entire summer he had been plagued with dreams of that night in June.  He dreamed of Cedric, staring up at him with his dead gray eyes, face forever locked in that expression of surprise.  He dreamed of that high cold voice whispering over and over again, saying ‘
She frowned.  ‘
“Leon!” she shouted as she dashed for her weapons, mind already racing and ready for a fight.  “Leon, your portkey!  Hastai, move your blasted arse!”
Her annoyance didn’t stop her from serving Harry some sausage and fruits, despite his futile attempts to stop her and she wouldn’t let them go to Potions until he finished everything.
From his safe spot in the small alleyway, Harry watched from the corner of his eye as other students hurried over to the Three Broomsticks, all dressed up.  He leaned against the cold wall of Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop, twisting the bracelet Professor Opacre had given him.
' did you
Jonas smiled faintly as he watched his old friend transfigure her robes back into the dark green reserved for Mind-Healers.  While they had idly chatted about her trip, he couldn’t help but feel a knot loosen in his chest as he watched her slowly settle herself into the mindset, her sharp eyes focusing and analyzing the layers behind the secrecy of the case he requested help for a week ago.  “Was it the excessive As in me writing ‘
,’ he thought as he playfully shoved Harry.  ‘
“Are you okay, Harry?” he asked worriedly and was unprepared for Qye’s eyes to snap up and angrily stare at him.
Qye was still so very young.
“Any chance I could convince you to go back and dance instead?” Draco asked carefully.
He heard the snarl behind him and pivoted on his heel, stepping backwards as he shouted, “
Harry shifted in the bed, feeling exhaustion beginning to arise once again in him.  He shoved it away, forcing himself to stay awake.  He had promised to tell the other boy.
Harry frowned.  He had no desire to get anywhere near the male vampire again but if it would help…
Ron didn’t need Hermione to figure it out, although he had owled her a copy.
’  Then he stopped thinking, nervously remembering that his cousin had a stronger Jewel and could read his thoughts.
“I’m sorry it happened to you, too” Harry said softly.  He gathered up his courage and let go of Draco’s hand.  He heard the blond slowly exhale and then still as Harry moved his hands to his chest.
’ she thought, staring at the extensive essays.  ‘
“What’s happening?” Qye asked as he stared at Smethwyck from where he lay on the bed, his head hanging upside down from the edge of it.
Qye burst out.
Draco met his eyes and any hint of the smirk from earlier disappeared.  “The kind that tells me I wasn’t mistaken in asking you.”
He wearily looked down at his patients.
Draco slowly rolled his family ring between his fingers as he stared at the fireplace in the common room.  It was brighter than usual, no doubt to account for all the students gathered at the tables and couches instead of carefully cloistered in their respective private rooms and rendezvous areas.  His own notes were on his lap where he had been reviewing them before casting them aside as soon as he came across a note on Threstrals.
Harry looked warily at it, still and silver in its cauldron.  He could feel Qye in the back of his eyes, looking through just as apprehensively.
, before turning her frown on their companions.
:: Qye said a slightly sharp voice.  Harry felt the other’s eyes narrow slightly – he shivered slightly at the feeling – and the boy continued.  ::
“Hold on,” he mumbled, turning to look at her pale face while he fought back his own nerves.  “They’re - ”
“He was a vampire.”
“Oi!” the Irish boy said in a mock-hurt voice.  “Now what did I do to deserve such brutal treatment?”
The youngest Weasley male walked over to Harry’s trunk, opened it, and immediately began to rummage for the parchment he knew the other boy always kept at the bottom.
Then she pitched Lest out of the chair.
“I’d rather not find out,” Dean snorted.
“Huh,” he said again thoughtfully, tilting his own head.  He reached out like he had before and felt it this time, felt Harry’s own mind reaching for his.
“Why not?” Malfoy said lazily back but Harry could hear a tinge of anger in his voice.  “He thinks about you, doesn’t he?”
“Ignore him,” he muttered to his struggling friend.  “We’ll just lose points and that’ll just make him ecstatic.”
,’ he thought, horrified, ‘
Qye said and Harry had never heard him so broken.
His hand trembled as he pushed it into his hair, flashes of Professor Opacre – Myn – and her brother – Lest – flickering in his mind and the thought about what all this meant.
“A moment, if you would,” Dazain suddenly said, sliding past the astonished wizard.  He stopped a few feet in front of Harry, who leaned away, expression wary.
"You would be," Ron muttered, slouching in his chair and taking a bite out of his pie.  "Only you would enjoy someone ruining your break."  Hermione shot him a dirty look and Harry watched them amusedly as he took a sip of his drink.
“It…it’s nothing to do with…with You-Know-Who…does it?” Ron asked, looking at him a bit nervously.   Harry shook his head without lifting it from his plate.  Whatever had just happened had nothing to do with Voldemort, of that much he was certain of.
The hand twitched when the Slytherin pressed down too hard as an unwelcome thought entered his mind.
Harry shot him a grateful look, which Ron returned with a grin before he started walking towards the castle.  Harry followed him and he heard Hermione mutter something that sounded suspiciously like ‘
“I’m sorry,” Harry said quietly, finally.
It was the last week of classes before break let out and a high feeling of anticipation filled the entire school.  All around, longing could be seen in the faces of the students and staff.  He could see the impatience and frustration in everyone's eyes as they sat through the long, slow lessons, waiting anxiously for the class to end and the vacation time to come closer.
The cracks were in his mind, he realized.  His mind was fragmenting, splintering, breaking into a thousand little pieces. . .
“What do I want?” Harry repeated softly.
“Fine,” Harry mumbled, looking up at the other boys while wincing as he felt his head.  There was going to be a bruise on it later, he was sure.
To be concluded in "Carus"
“Oh, that’s useful,” Harry mumbled.  “You finally come with an off switch.”
Qye muttered, tense and distracted.
“Lest,” Professor Opacre said exasperatedly. “Harry has just recovered from being sick so stop baiting him. And besides, he’s already apologized for that.”
’ she thought, smiling slightly.  ‘
“Somehow, I very much doubt there’s going to be much formal dancing back there,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes.
Harry added in seven forget-me-nots and slowly stirred clockwise, frowning as the golden color deepened to a dark violet.
“Talk to you soon,” Draco murmured against his skin before he pulled back and walked away, leaving Harry alone in the silent corridor.
Qye stiffened as he threw another furious stare at the vampire but Lest didn’t turn around.  He shook, gritting his teeth as he itched to throw himself back at the source of his pain, his hands trembling at his side.  Harry placed a hand on his shoulder and he blew out a disgusted breath, tearing his eyes away from the silent figure of his once best friend.
The Slytherin snarled softly and grabbed Harry’s shoulder, making Harry face him.  The green-eyed boy glared at him, shoving Malfoy’s hand off.
Qye said nothing but he knew the other boy was wondering the same thing.
:: he muttered to Qye, looking around the Infirmary tiredly and noticing that he was the only one in right now.  ::
Harry asked curiously as he flipped a few pages more to see if there were any more notes.
’  The feeling rose quickly.  ‘
“What’s going on here?” a new voice drawled behind them and Harry flushed slightly as he recognized it.  Swallowing slightly, he turned around to see Malfoy - ::
And he knew, he knew even as his forced his body up, up and staggering and pushed himself with his eyes fixed on the other boy who looked exactly like him, all broken and twisted up on the inside, what to do.
“That didn’t happen to me,” Qye bit out, pushing down the thought of memories of his mother that he never got to see, so caught up in learning about the wizarding world and then trying to find answers and ignoring everything else.  “And we aren’t arguing that we weren’t the same person for a while.  We just aren’t now.”
“All of a sudden?” Ron said skeptically, raising an eyebrow.  “Not that you haven’t been acting funny since the dance but…” He gestured down at the floor, where there were still a few scattered shreds of parchment and quills and books.  “This?  This isn’t you, mate.”
Lest didn’t move from his position.
Marylin bit her lip to keep from laughing. Ron and Hermione blinked in unison before looking uneasily at the startled vampire.
Qye stayed silent, a dark and painful maelstrom in his mind.
:: Harry murmured soothingly to the other boy, feeling Qye beginning to grow hysterical.  ::
Harry sighed and took a small bite of mashed potatoes. His stomach protested violently as he swallowed it painfully, immediately gulping down some juice, then regretting that too. One look at Hermione’s face and he knew he couldn’t escape from this one. He sighed and stared palely down at his almost full plate.
go playing around him here. Act as childish as you want outside but not here.”
“Good,” Marylin murmured.  The siblings were silent for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts.  After a few minutes, Marylin opened her eyes and looked at her brother.
And Qye was right.  What did anything else matter but what he wanted?
"When we were in the room of requirement, you called it a Horcrux, didn't you?"
"You sound like a real philosopher," Lucius snapped, because they were in his private rooms and if he wanted to be petty, he could be, and if Harry was going to tell anyone he'd have done so much earlier than now.
to teach him Occlumency?"
"Alright."
Draco brushed his thumb against Harry’s cheekbone as his robes fell, tilting Harry’s head back up. He looked nervous, his green eyes wide and his cheeks flushed, and it wasn’t until then that Draco realized how long it had been since they’d done this.
It was so utterly frustrating, the way Harry was refusing to look at him, refusing to pay attention to him. They'd been doing well; no, they'd been doing better than well. And so what if Draco was a little impatient for more physical things between them, it wasn't as if he had pushed Harry. There was no reason for Harry to be turning toward him, green eyes sparkling with mirth and-
"No," Harry sighed, watching Draco's retreating back. "No, sometimes he's really not." Cho cast him an odd look.
"Be nice," she said. She led the way downstairs, still talking and expecting Harry and Draco to be following behind her. "It was really Draco who was worried about you." Harry's eyes cut to Draco, who sniffed and turned his nose up like that was the most ridiculous thing he’d ever heard.
Gee, I wonder what Lucius and Severus will be doing in the next chapter?? o_o
interrogate him."
"Lucius," Narcissa Black nudged him in the ribs. He threw his long blonde hair over his shoulder in acknowledgment but made no other move to look at her. "You're staring again," she sighed, turning a page in her book. "It's beginning to be obvious."
The sound of approaching footsteps brought him out of his own mind. He quickly turned away from the window, making a show of immersing himself in his book. That was until Granger yanked it out of his hand and slammed it shut.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He did. He died saving Harry after Snape was kidnapped," Lupin answered. Draco blinked at the bitterness in Lupin's tone, at the way Lupin's lips twisted as he frowned and turned away. "Sirius was in Azkaban for so long. For a crime he didn't commit, and I'd just gotten him back, and then he died." Lupin sighed, letting out a breath, his shoulders relaxing as he lowered his head.
all night?" Black asked, and Draco only barely settled for glaring at him. He doubted Potter would appreciate him murdering Sirius Black.
"It doesn't matter now," Sirius Black interrupted. "Well take it from here, you four get to safety."
obvious. He'd felt the jealousy when Zabini had been talking to Draco, the way he'd looked at him, the kindness, the concern in his eyes. But Draco had seemed so oblivious, Zabini so intent on helping them, and Harry was hardly the authority when it came to people's feeling.
“I think you have something in your teeth,” Draco interrupted, and the girl flinched, her eyes flicking from Harry to Draco.
Thanks so much for your comments and love!
gotten horribly lost in this room. Thankfully, he hadn't lost himself forever, instead he had learned that getting lost wasn't actually what he wanted.
"You know what happened," Voldemort snapped, sticking his wand straight into Harry's face. Harry just smiled up at him.
"Blaise," Draco stepped forward, his hand automatically falling between Harry's shoulder blades. Harry tensed under his hand, but he didn't move away, his face half-turning to look at Draco. "Give us a minute."
beginning to realize that he
If Harry wanted him. He'd come find him.
They turned left, heading straight for the lift. And no one really bothered them as they headed out. It was too common to see Harry and Dracona marching through the Ministry, avoiding looking at each other, disheveled and looking a mess. Well, Harry looked a mess. Dracona would never let herself look a mess. She was a Malfoy after all.
you been?" Draco asked. "If it wasn't with Blaise, it must have been somewhere." Harry shifted, moving away from Draco and averting his gaze. "Tell me, Harry, it's time I knew." Harry tensed, his muscles taunt as if he was decided whether to run out of the room or not, and Draco wondered if he'd pushed too far. He wondered just how much poking and prodding Harry could take before he rebelled.
"Harry!" Dracona snapped, her voice cutting across his with a smooth determination that was always so easy for her. And she had The Look on her face again, that disapproving Look that made her grey eyes stand out hard and cold and beautiful, and Harry felt again like a child being scolded. And he hated it. "You're not going."
"That will only make things worse," Severus interrupted. "Lucius, you need to keep a level head."
it was fascinating the types of candy he liked, and the ones he blatantly spit out. They soon discovered he actually liked the syrupy flavors, leaving Draco wondering how he would feel about something like Treacle Tart or Cheesecake.
"He just seems frantic. As if he's trying to prove himself to
," he said savagely, directing his glare at Hermione.
He sighed, reaching for the door handle. It didn't matter. This was for Harry. For Harry, he couldn't have another werewolf meltdown. And if that meant being weak, then he supposed he would have to do it.
"Alright."
“We should probably go to bed,” Draco told him, pressing his lips together to keep himself from laughing. If he hadn’t known better, he would have said Harry was
"Exactly," Nott answered, one eyebrow raised, and Blaise knew with a sinking feeling that this was what he'd been planning all along. He exchanged a look with Granger as Weasley began ranting about werewolves and the law and 'the right thing to do.' The problem was that he had no idea how to stop it.
"Walking, and what are you doing?" he answered, ignoring the way Severus frowned at him. "Besides, bothering me, that is."
Draco had left for the bathroom thirty minutes ago and gotten caught by some woman with bright blonde hair who gestured louder than she spoke. He’d cast a look at Harry to save him, but Harry wasn’t going over there unless there was mortal danger.
