It wasn't until he had begun to pace in front of his desk that he noticed a foreign piece of parchment resting atop his other files. Crisp and stark white against his mahogany desk, the folded card mocked him with its mere presence. With shaking fingers, Draco grasped at the note, fully intending to show it to Harry as soon as he read whatever new threat his stalker had left this time.
"Thanks again for the tea," he said, ignoring the fact that Ginevra was clearly looking at the glasses of Firewhiskey. "Much appreciated. Perhaps we should set more time for further discussions." He nodded imperiously, first at Ginevra, then at Potter, before disappearing out of the Floo.
"Nonsense," Draco argued. "She and I were brought up with the same customs and expectations. We have already delayed begetting heirs. I'm quite sure that she has her reasons for acting out."
"That's why I'm comfortable talking like this with you," Harry said lightly. "If I had these conversations with anyone else, it'd be so different. At least I can talk with you properly."
The man - Gerard, apparently - scoffed. To Draco, he seemed like a child being admonished by the headmistress.
"Since all of your research has been completely from the magical side of things, I decided to take the Muggle route. I hoped you would all keep your minds open, because I think we might be able to solve the problem this way."
"I understand, Andy, don't worry," Harry said. "I'll take care of Teddy, too." He was still glancing furtively at Malfoy. He took his son from her arms and secured him against his hip as unobtrusively as possible. Andromeda was obviously perceptive.
"I'm sure she's alright, dear," Narcissa said, smoothing away Draco's hair from his pale face. "No need to worry now."
"Sirius died when-" Potter seemed to be trying to control his voice, which made Draco feel slightly guilty. He had only been curious about the house, not the family drama. He seemed to want to go on, though. "It was in fifth year, during the Ministry break in that I told you about before. We had broken into the Department of Mysteries, and- and Bellatrix killed him."
Once again, Harry thought amusedly to himself, Draco Malfoy somehow saved the day. It wasn't something he would readily admit to, but over the last few months, he had really gotten used to having the man as an outlet for the kind of conversations he could neither expect nor ever ask for from Ron and Hermione. Or anyone else, if her were being quite honest.
"It's our turn, Mother," Draco whispered softly to the wispy woman next to him. Narcissa Malfoy still looked as regal as her Black blood would allow, but no one could miss the uncharacteristic weakness that had seemed to plague her recently.   Truth be told, she looked quite forlorn, and some people even forgot for a second that she had been the wife and mother of Death Eaters. They always remembered this fact when their eyes fell back on Draco. He would always be judged by that.
After finishing the paper, he sighed and sat back onto the couch. With the engagement finalized, he and his betrothed had much to do in the way of planning, and he wasn't eager to get entangled in it. Thankfully, they both agreed that they needed to focus on their own plans before marriage, and decided that two years was sufficient time for that. After all, Draco still had to go back to France for another year to start training for his Potions Mastery. Meanwhile, Astoria was still a busy socialite, and wished to make rounds in Europe in order to build rapport with neighboring wizarding circles. Draco hadn't minded in the slightest; in fact, he applauded her for her understanding of personal ambition, something he had hoped to find in his future wife.
Harry snorted in amusement. "Yeah. Sneaking out and breaking into the broom shed just to learn Quidditch on her own. Even when she was going out with her old boyfriends at Hogwarts, she was always the opposite of the girly girl, and I don't think they could handle that," he laughed when he remembered her fiery attitude when it came to dating at such an early age.
Her hands grazed his chest and continued downwards, where she felt his growing bulge. Harry looked her in the eye and saw the fire in them. "I've missed you," she said, as if in answer to a silent question. The kisses continued then, alternating between soft and sweet to hard and deep, making Harry almost forget that they were in his chair, cramped behind his desk, with a sleeping baby just a few feet away.
"However..." she gave him a sparkling smile and squeezed his arm. "It does not mean that you should cease from your instinctual need to dote on your own son. Perhaps a compromise will work best in this circumstance. It might be a little unusual for the more conservative purebloods when they find out that you wish to be involved in your sons early childhood development, but you can always keep that more private. Meanwhile you can easily cater to Astoria's needs and deal with them in the spotlight. Look at Pansy and her husband."
Potter handed over another sheet of parchment over to Draco. "Here's a map of Pince's mind. After our particular brand of interrogation, which includes much more thorough analyses and cross-referencing, we concluded that his personality resembles that of someone who is at fault, and obviously guilty, but also showing more fear and intimidation than can be found from our working model of a typical mastermind."
"Because, you have a family name to uphold, and not appearing with your wife in events that she organizes is unbecoming of a Malfoy."
Harry realized that it was much harder than he thought to get it to come out smoothly and naturally, but he got it anyway.
The other half, of course, is rookie Ginny Weasley, whom everyone predicted to be this year's weakest link. Having been recruited to play on the starting seven after only two months in junior training, many fans were doubtful of her skill, claiming instead that her high profile relationship with Harry Potter was the only cause for her immediate acceptance into the team. Granted, that particular accusation was what brought about the sudden rush to bid against the Harpies in the first place. After the great financial losses all around, of course, hers is the name on everyone's lips.
"It's my fault, Harry!" Ginny cried out, face scrunched up. "I admit that, I know this is mostly my fault and I'm so sorry that I've fucked us up so badly without even knowing. I know that we've both sacrificed to make everything good for James, but you've been having to compromise more than I have, and only because you let me have the chance at my dreams. It's so stupid, I know," she was rambling now, "I keep chasing after what I want, but then I look back and realize that I've left everyone behind and I'm not part of the picture here anymore."
Ron picked up on Harry's misery, and suddenly understood that this night was just as much for Harry as it was for him. "Er, got problems, too, mate?"
It was said so sharply that Harry knew it had been difficult to swallow her pride and thank them, which made the gesture even more significant.
Potter just shrugged and gave him an odd smile. Neither confirmation nor denial. "You know, Ron and I were talking about how we could all go to Viridian again for a couple pints. After your 'personal matters' settle down, of course." Potter laughed at Draco's dumbfounded expression. "Don't think too much about it, we just thought it would help us through the tension of the case, as well as your upcoming months of hell-"
"It's only for Jamie, and only because you were away so often in his first year. Of course he'll be more familiar with me."
"I've already done it plenty of times," the Auror offered, shrugging. "If that's what makes you so nervous. It won't be the first time I do this."
The surprise call from Malfoy had certainly shaken him up, there was no doubt about it. It had been unnerving to see the blond's face through the emerald fire, staring straight at James. At first, Harry had feared that his privacy bindings had failed, and he spent a good five seconds internally checking all the wards he had put on his son. Thankfully, however, Malfoy showed no indication of having sensed James' presence, though he did repeatedly worry Harry by pointing out his arms.
Sure enough, the Floo roared to life, bathing the sitting room in emerald light. Out from the hearth jumped little Teddy, not so little anymore at 7. In fact, Harry felt a slight jolt when he realized that he had grown by an inch since he last stayed over.
Teddy, now fully awake and doubly excited, moved higher to hug Draco. "Draco, you're still here! You can celebrate with us! Hooray!" And with that he jumped off and ran back upstairs. Draco hoped to Merlin he didn't wake the babies just yet.
Harry thought about how it may have sounded too accusing, or too blunt, but this really was something they had to discuss before things became okay again. Also, his temper was a bit short today, what with all the complications in Draco's case as well as the fact that Teddy had begun his early phases of rebellion by refusing to do what the adults told him.
"It's true, though," Malfoy insisted. "It's not like we go into it with nary an idea of what it's about. I chose Astoria, and I offered to court her formally. In the end, she chose me, too. Our families both agreed, and our contract has been going strong. I see nothing wrong or odd about that."
Apollo laid a hand on his shoulder. "Relax, Harry," he tried soothingly. "Let's just trace back our investigation. Pedal back a bit, you know?"
The mere idea put a ray of light in Draco's mood. The thought of spending a relaxing day with Harry and the kids was welcome after all the hassle he and his family were going through with the threats.
Harry laughed at his question, no longer sure about which of them needed the drinks more. "I dunno, mate," he replied, taking another gulpful of his drink. "I just felt like we both needed this."
Hermione opened her mouth, no doubt to give him a piece of her mind now that Harry was done, but she was interrupted by Ron's voice calling out to them from his study. "Sorry, you guys, I've got to make a couple more calls for Stone, I'll join you in a bit."
"I'd love that," he finally answered, glad when Harry's expression brightened even more. "I do have an idea for later, actually."
He had expected Malfoy to be offended that he hadn't been named the Black heir, considering that he had the right of blood and Harry had none. But the blond didn't seem to care. Harry realized that maybe he wasn't the only one to have a particular dislike for this house.
Even during their somewhat reluctant cooperation for the Eilert case, Potter had been careful to avoid any mention of his personal relationship except in strictly factual or objective comments. For this reason, Draco had begun to mentally ignore the presence (or existence) of the youngest Weasel, which, now that he thought about it, was odd, considering that she was the mother of the child whose father he spent much time with for several months.
"I apologize, Minister, I was just taken by surprise," Draco muttered. He had asked for the information, and he would get it. He schooled his expression again and waited for the man to continue.
Narcissa motioned towards the direction of Draco and Astoria's wing and walked briskly at once, leaving her son to hurry in her wake.
George appeared to be thinking something through. "You know Harry, maybe we should petition to add 'Bad Arse Mother Fucker' to your growing list of accolades..."
Astoria's owl perched itself on the edge of Draco's desk, holding out the crisp envelope still attached to its leg. Draco stood unmoving, slightly apprehensive at the possible contents of the letter. Of course, he had been confident that his actions would capture Astoria's attention favorably, but he could not help but feel vulnerable due to the bit of insecurity he had developed from failing both his father and the Dark Lord. At the last moment, he finally steeled his resolve, took the letter and scanned it quickly, his smile growing wider as he read.
Ron nodded but continued to choke on his words. "I just thought, y'know? I thought I'd ask tonight, i-it felt right to me, y'know?"
"Hey, hey, just relax," Harry said, slightly going back into panic mode at the sight of Ron breaking down. He knew how much this meant to Ron, but also aware of how much more level-headed Hermione was, and that there was likely more to this than what he got so far. "What exactly did she say?" he asked.
"This big secret of yours is a big deal, isn't it?" Malfoy said, more of a statement than a question. "I apologize, I sounded like a spoilt brat. I know it isn't any of my business at all."
"Draco, Darling!" he heard an exasperated cry from inside the room, and before he knew it, he was engulfed in an uncharacteristic embrace from Narcissa.
Weasley laughed. "Good luck with that! Traumatic early childhood, missing guardians, not to mention inappropriate child-endangering school activities and post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by continual exposure to warfare..."
It was for this reason that Harry had been relieved that Ginny could be home the entire time that he had to go to the Ministry for seven weeks. It was a refreshing change (and quite an eye opener) for both of them, which only added to the improved dynamic between the two former lovers.
"It will be fine," she assured him, her words a blanket of comfort on his anxiety-ridden mind. "I'll stay with her now, you should go and get rest."
Harry sighed. It was going to be a long day if he was punctuating every thought with a memory of the blond prat while trying to keep his attention on his fiancée.
Draco nodded dazedly. He made no move, not knowing what exactly to do next, until a Mediwitch transferred the bundled infant into his arms. As the weight settled, so did Draco's heart, and he felt his soul flutter in utmost happiness at the first real feel of Scorpius, his son, so close to himself.
Ginny bore the brunt of her mother's force with ease, since she had grown up learning how to counter Molly's scolding. Harry, however, had taken to avoiding his future mother-in-law, and keeping their conversations short and straight to the point before finding a reason to excuse himself. After two months, Molly had finally relented, but nevertheless snuck in her advice whenever she got Ginny alone. Like at tonight's New Year's party.
Harry sighed into the wooden surface of the table. "I just hope Astoria doesn't mind giving her magical consent. Every second counts."
Hermione shrugged, then picked up Hugo, bouncing him gently in her arms in an effort to soothe him. "Don't even get me started," she sighed. "I hadn't even had any plans of having a child this early, much less two children."
As if on cue, a sudden pop and a flash of light blinded Harry for a moment, and when the haze of smoke disappeared he saw George fiddling with a camera. "Got it!" the prankster said. "This photo will definitely make me a millionaire! Oh but wait, I can't sell it! Damn! It's illegal now! Oh, woe is me!" He gave a dramatic sigh, then laughed along with everyone as he joined them at the table.
"No need to feel shy about it, Potter," he said gently. Then he remembered himself and went back to the usual Malfoy-speak in an effort to get to Potter better. "You merely require ample distraction," he started haughtily, "I'm sure if you asked any of the mediwitches here, they'd regale you with the wonderful story of my absolute calm and level-headedness during Scorpius' birth."
"Blimey," Ron said, "I'm impressed that you've gotten this far in the wizarding world without knowing about the old wedding traditions."
"Fine... Harry." Malfoy made a face as if he were sucking on a lemon, but Harry knew him well enough to know that he was just being the prat he was.
Resignedly, he walked out and headed to the west wing conservatory, where he knew Astoria was currently reading. He would have to confirm with her and deal with the situation his mother had singlehandedly dealt them. Two weeks in the south of France might sound like the perfect holiday for other busy wizards, but he knew better. Endless fancy parties and hands to shake and people to impress were just a small part of the itinerary.
"Undetectable Displacement Charm," he answered proudly. "Same family as   the Undetectable Extension Charm, except instead of extending a small space infinitely, I've simply Displaced the roof top upwards by.. a lot of floors." He grinned at her amusement. His eyes took in the late afternoon sky, tinged with pinks and oranges, the unsuspecting Muggles walking to and fro beneath them. "I wanted a space where I could go to, to clear my mind. I've always felt better in the air than on the ground, so I thought of this neat trick. What do you think?"
Malfoy's eye-roll was clear even amidst the glow of the fire, and so was his snarky tone. "Only you would immediately ask if I were alright. Really got that saving-people-thing that Hermione keeps mentioning, eh?"
Harry nodded. "I agree. But sending that short message seems like someone throwing a line, like bait."
In any case, starting the morning with an exchange of verbal abuse was fast becoming a comfort blanket for the two of them. Now halfway through their full English and after much biting banter, Harry felt much more at ease with Malfoy.
"I've invited Potter and Weasley for a few drinks at the Viridian," he said. "It will only be the third time we've been out in public so it won't be suspicious, and all of it under the protection of Potter's wards."
The tension in their conversation melted away completely. Harry grinned. "I've already stuck with him for nearly 8 years. What's another hundred years?"
"Malfoy," Weasley greeted, getting straight to the point. "Auror Philius Stone needs you to er, reconfirm, for the nth time, that you and Macmillan were willing witnesses. Just sign and put your magical signature on the three copies. Shouldn't take too long."
ward around his relationship with Ginevra, Astoria had joined the gossip bandwagon while Draco remained uninterested in such matters - he did not see any use or advantage - and so he did not care.
"Oh, don't you worry, Draco. You can owe me sometime later, when all this is taken care of." Her smile turned into more of a smirk this time. Draco had never felt prouder.
Astoria was absent, as Draco hadn't wanted her around for Hermione's big reveal. Instead, he had advised her to rest in their private suite before lying halfheartedly about where he would be. Her pallor as of late was a cause of concern for him, and he wanted to do anything to lessen the anxiety plaguing his poor wife.
"No, it was all real," Harry said, his tone slightly darker. "But yeah, we found a load of crazy stuff in the Department of Mysteries, so you must be in real deep to be working with them."
It was only when he was in bed that he had thought again about his call. The way Potter's arms were up and appeared to struggle, as if he were holding something.
"Listen to yourself, will you?" Harry cut in loudly. "Where the fuck is all of that even coming from? I didn't even say anything remotely in the same sense as everything you just spouted at me. Why the hell are you so defensive about your career?!"
"She's spent her life wanting to be able to take care of herself," Harry said. "I was fine with that. I needed to do that for myself, too. But yeah, I guess she was working hard to not be the next Molly Weasley."
Though Ron wouldn't say it out loud, Harry knew that his best mate had something going on with Hermione. Their disagreements had increased, even more than the usual amount of bickering one expected from their relationship. In fact, he expected that Hermione's pregnancy had affected them almost as much as Ginny's had with her and Harry. He knew that both of his best friends did their best to handle their domestic problems in private, and indeed Ron had never slacked off while he was on the job. Despite his carefree attitude and happy go lucky personality around friends and family, Auror Weasley still kept up a fierce reputation amongst the other Aurors, who did their best to avoid his temper. In fact, no suspect so far had escaped the inevitable breakdown and confession after only fifteen minutes of interrogation with both Harry and Ron. No one in the department ever questioned their authority, and they found that they liked it that way.
No matter how much Harry wanted to deny it, he really did miss Ginny. Despite the fact that she had only spent nights at their flat for the last few years, they really had built a steady and dependable routine that they both worked well with. Of course, the one thing that had changed their lives was James, since before his birth they had been quite comfortable to give each other the space they needed. It had been the same way since the war, Harry thought, looking back at how they had developed as a couple.
When his mother reacted once again, he knew that it was indeed baby James that had him unbelievable happy, and that his face was reflecting it accurately. And knowing so made him smile at the thought, which obviously startled Narcissa even more.
"Oh, Harry..." Hermione moved to hug him, but he remained stiff in her arms. "We'll deal with all of this together, and once Ginny calls..."          "She'd better," Ron mumbled.
"Sirius Black was my godfather," Potter said, finally explaining everything. "He left me everything he owned, which included this house." Potter gestured around them with his arms. "I used to hate this place, you know. Even when I finally fixed it up, I still got my own flat, which is where I usually live. I missed this house though, so I came back here with- I came back here for a while."
Harry laughed hollowly. "To be honest... I can't decide which ones were worse. After the war, I’d wake up screaming to drown out all the noise of people dying all round me..."
Astoria looked at him blankly. "You really think you're interpreting all of that correctly? It sounds as if you had just pulled all of that out of nowhere..."
Harry quirked up an eyebrow in curiosity. "How do Slytherins ever survive through the concept of friendship with the way you lot handle things? It's like all of you are straight laced and just... aloof. Like, no hugs and kisses, no friendly banter, just always watching out for yourself, even from your so-called friends..."
Draco's tone of voice was still a bit matter-of-fact, which made Harry wonder just how close the Malfoys had remained after the war. Of course, he had already known about Narcissa's willing separation from Lucius , as well as the subsequent rise to fame that everyone attributed to Draco and Astoria's efforts. It was only now that Harry realized he had no idea about Lucius Malfoy's fate beyond his admittance into Azkaban. To hear of his passing now was quite unexpected and shocking.
Harry only smirked, trapping her in his arms and moving closer so there was barely a hair's breadth between their lips. "Tell me that after I'm done with you."
Sure, Draco realized that he had gotten everything he had ever asked of his parents, but after his entry into Hogwarts, everything had come at a price. Gifts were rewards, and he had had to do something to please his father in order to get what he wanted. While he had taken a particular sort of pride in doing so as a child, he now realized that he didn't want his son to have to do something first in order to receive attention from his parents.
"Er..." For the first time in a while, Draco found himself speechless. He had only just realized what an awkward position this put him in. "Well....."
"That's a wonderful idea, mother," Draco said gratefully. "Please, prepare anything we might need and Astoria and I shall be back as soon as we can secure an international portkey to Wiltshire."
"Draco..." Astoria's voice was soft but firm, and to Draco it sounded like skates on ice. Her eyes found his, and he saw pleading. "I had gone to St. Mungo's yesterday with a friend of mine, and I had just gone to accompany her. But I ran into Healer Lows, and we decided to have lunch together."
"Is there anything I can help you with?" he offered sincerely. Hermione looked at him as if laying eyes on him for the first time. "What?" he said, "I'm going to be a father, Potter agrees that I may as well collect as much experience as I can."
"I do, and I'll do everything in my power to help you," Harry murmured, then flashed a smile at the blonde. "Now that we've sorted that out... get the fuck out of my floo. It's still just before sunrise, you bastard."
Sadly, Hugo had been a completely different case. Harry's eyes flicked across the room, looking at Molly, who was handling a tiny bundle in her arms. Hugo, fast asleep, was at least much better now, but had been in critical condition when he had been born. The Healers had to put him in a magical incubation charm for several weeks until he became stable enough to be brought home. Ron and Hermione had stayed in a private ward at St. Mungo's the entire time, and were glad when they were finally given clearance to take their baby home.
"But we've already gone through all the material that Narcissa brought out from both the Malfoy and Black collections, and still nothing new!" Astoria cried, looking forlorn. "It will take us forever and result in close to nothing…"
"What do you think?" Potter asked suddenly, settling in one of the armchairs. Draco took the one opposite him.
. I think making those kinds of decisions, you know, having kids, settling down, it needs more than just love or compatibility. It needs two people who already know what they want and are sure that they can and
"I'm tempted to file these away now just so I can pretend that we've moved forward on something." As he began sifting through the sheets of simplified mind maps that he had become so proficient at reading, Ron came up beside him, sharing his interest.
Silence had never been so deafening, thought Draco. So much white noise reverberated in his head from his attacker's words.
"I see. My apologies, then" Draco said, now understanding why Potter had appeared to be waiting for him by the fire. "Well, thanks for taking my call anyway, Potter. I'll send you anything else I discover tomorrow."
"It's-" Harry took another deep breath and let it out, before attempting to continue again. "It's not what you think."
Hermione let out a breathy sigh. "I need to be on top of my game, Harry. All the time. In the Council, I'm constantly surrounded by older, more experienced wizards who never seem to lose their doubts about my credentials. I need to prove that I'm more than my blood, that I'm more than just that."
"Yes, well, I've figured out that majority of the items are categorized under botanical ingredients, which have a short life span. You can't use botanical ingredients unless they're fresh, which means that if we figure out what the items are precisely, you'll be able to track down any recent transactions for them."
With a sigh, he went through the doors into Kingsley's office, hoping that this meeting would at least keep his mind away from his drab future, and maybe bring good news for once in his life.
"Er, thanks, Potter," Draco murmured behind his cup, relishing the feeling of having something familiar after a night full of shock and surprises.
"This is a unique situation, but not uncommon. There have been precedents, and this type of delivery has been practiced successfully in the last decade."
Harry rarely shared his presence with other people apart from Ron, Hermione, Ginny and the rest of the extended family. It was his choice. But sometimes when he was on the end of his string, he found that he couldn't escape to be on his own.
Teddy nodded sagely, which Harry beamed at. In a second though, he remembered his guests. "Shall we head into the playroom?" he asked. The blond nodded and they made their way to the extra room down the hallway which Harry had converted into a child-safe playroom.
Draco visibly took in a deep breath, which seemed to calm him. "Viable, yes. Mother did her research thoroughly, and she's been instructed in the Black family history since her childhood days. This particular one was the best option to provide complete protection against ill intent. It's not archaic or obsolete, just very limited to the Black line. The steps for the ritual are laid out very precisely to avoid any margin of error. The only reason it hasn't worked is if Scorpius' magic is blocked somehow. I can't - I have to protect him. The Fidelius isn't enough!"
When Harry and Ginny both nodded, she continued carefully. "I believe that a similar situation occurred. What I mean to say is, it appears that your magic, Ms. Weasley, has been reacting unfavorably perhaps due to extreme stress and extended states of emotional distress. Does this seem consistent so far with your current lifestyle?"
As it was, Hermione's estimation was off only by a few minutes. By that time, Harry had settled down a little, now supporting a babbling James (hidden completely via
"He's found three more," Harry replied, quietly Summoning the last letter that the blond had sent him. "Here you go. He says he's found the first non-botanical ingredient, but that it's too common and can't be easily tracked down like the first ingredients he gave us."
"Why would you compare her to a horse?!" Ron cried. Harry chuckled despite the seriousness of the situation.
"I've said it before, Gin. We can all stick with this house for as long as we need," Harry said tiredly. "The flat isn't enough space, so this is the obvious choice. And we have our own rooms and everything, so I don't see a problem."
Hermione bit her lip to stop from grinning. "Whatever would the Malfoy forebears say!" she said with a dramatic tone. Malfoy couldn't help but laugh.
Malfoy shrugged. "Well I just learned that both of you follow the errant ways of the Muggle," he said jokingly.
Harry gritted his teeth and prepared for a biting remark, but then he saw Malfoy's expression change for a second and he immediately decided not to let their schoolyard immaturity get the better of him tonight. "Why did you call?" he asked, trying to keep the impatience from his voice.
"Fine," Hermione said firmly, which made Draco release the breath he was holding. "I can come through. But let me call Harry and Ron first-they'll want to know where I'm going to be today, you see…"
When he stumbled back into his own fire, he couldn't help but wince at the odd ending to such a pleasant night. And Draco knew there wasn't any reason, but he felt as if he and Potter had been caught doing something illegal. Which they weren't. So his feeling of guilt was unfounded, and it confused him until he finally fell asleep.
Several moments passed by in silence, during which Draco did his best to hold his tongue, so that he would not be the first to break the peace. If she wanted him to admit to her face that she had been right about his failings in marriage, then -
She merely laughed lightly. "It's true, my love, people could never shut me up whenever I started to talk about you," she said. "Now, where would you like me to begin?"
Breaking expectations by his very popularity, Draco Malfoy has proven to be more than his family history and has in the last years reestablished himself as one of the most respected professionals in the country, (not to mention being elected several times as Most Desired Wizard in Witch Weekly.) Originally expected to languish amongst the former followers of You-Know-Who, he has instead made a name for himself and gone out of his way to break the prejudice that was bound to be against him. Now he is back in the limelight, sharing easy conversation with political dignitaries and in the good graces of his former school adversaries. It has not escaped the attention of this reporter that his relationship with Auror Potter has been pleasantly civil. This very observation can be taken as proof enough that Draco Malfoy has indeed changed for the better.
Potter had spent half of their impromptu meeting in pensive silence, and the other half sharing his thoughts about him and his - well, now that Draco realized, Potter had NEVER even mentioned the words 'girlfriend', 'fiancée' or 'betrothed' in any conversation that he could recall. Odd.
To his relief, Ron seemed to pick up on his line of thought. "Since we caught the Eilerts and confiscated all the new batches of Persephone's Poison? Nothing too major, I reckon. He's a bit nicer, of course," he added with a smirk. "Still smug, but nice. Have you noticed anything yourself?"
Hermione stopped what she was doing to look at him, giving him all her attention. "In a way, you remind me of Harry." At the look of incredulity on Draco's face, she laughed softly. "He's got quite a family history, though it's not really for me to share, but... well, he never had parents, and he never really had a father figure to guide him. He had the same fears as you, but look at him now. He loves being a dad, and it comes to him naturally, as I'm sure it will do for you," Hermione said with a note of conviction, busying herself with pouring him another cup.
As Potter led them into the hallway, Weasley remarked on how much better the place looked after Potter had "taken an axe to it."
Malfoy nodded, and his weariness and anxiety became even more obvious. "Astoria and I received a threat yesterday."
Harry let out a shaky breath and turned to face her. His expression was cool. "Ginny. Honestly. I am fucking sick of being Fate's plaything. I am absolutely tired of having to just accept whatever the fuck is thrown at me, I hate that my major life decisions are never true choices, but are just whatever is left over. This is NOT how I expected the rest of my life to be, and goddamnit I want it to just be fucking normal for once and not have some twist of fate turn everything upside down every time I think it's all fine!"
Ella's expression brightened. "Not everyone had the clearance to travel internationally in the window that you and Astoria were jumping from here to France and back. There was probably higher security for the event you went to, what with the international heads and all. I'm sure the French government would have controlled traffic. That could be another angle to check."
Astoria sat next to him and gazed into his silver eyes imploringly. It was then that he noticed her lovely dress, soft gold with subtle shimmers that caught both his and Scorpius' eyes.
Draco leaned back. "Well, now that you're feeling at home in my exquisitely opulent couch, why don't we move the real conversation along? And don't even bother filtering. Six years of stalking you and I can still read you like an open book."
Finally, after a good few minutes, Hermione tentatively broke the quiet. "So... that's it?" she asked apprehensively. "The two of you just... agreed to break the engagement. Just like that."
Draco was just putting down a sleeping Scorpius into his floating bassinet when Libby the elf popped in to announce a fire call. When he was informed of who was calling, he immediately rushed to the nearest fire (only one of the many to be found scattered about in the Manor for convenience, of course).
"Hey, er," Ron's eyes drifted away. "See you tomorrow then, and bring some of those cakes that Kreacher makes, yeah?" he added in an obvious attempt to lighten the mood.
Malfoy's hand clenched ever so slightly at his words, so Harry knew he was on the right track. He had guessed correctly. Malfoy didn't believe he could fulfill the requirements of the ritual.
"I can't believe I'll be grounded in four weeks," Ginny mumbled into Harry's shoulder. They had just Apparated from St. Mungo's, both collapsing onto the couch in exhaustion.
Harry pulled him closer so he could tickle him. Teddy let out squeal after squeal, and Harry was thankful that Teddy was still young enough to enjoy those.
"Well..." Rosewood cleared her throat. "I'm sure you're very familiar with what happened to Hermione Weasley's first pregnancy?"
Ron's face was completely crimson, and it clashed horribly with his sweat-soaked hair. Of course, Harry didn't look any better, his jet black mop plastered to his forehead and dripping with perspiration.
Harry tried to keep his breathing steady. "Thank you so much for letting me come here," he said sincerely, grabbing Ginny's hand with both of his. "What do you think, Gin?"
Molly Weasley had taken to prowling along the corridors in her highly frenzied state, which caused Harry's levels of concern to spike up even more.
"No, he needs the best of the best," Draco agreed, moving to embrace Astoria. She allowed it for a few seconds, melting into his arms, then she stood up and went towards their wing.
Harry chuckled. "You're going to have to help me put your cousin to bed first. Then we'll have that talk."
Draco raised an eyebrow, but there was a hint of a smug smile on his face. "Are you saying you were doubting my skills?"
One of the things about Ginny that Harry appreciated was that she was easy to talk with, even with potentially embarrassing emotional topics such as this. She made it seem so easy. Being with her would definitely be a joy, he was sure.
"I said stop it, Gerard," Astoria snarled. "I just want to get this over with. Explain what you had in mind when you brought him here. We don't have - "
"Only symbolically," Draco said exasperatedly. "The ritual called for blood, so Mother used hers. We followed the steps but the magic didn't attach to Scorpius. We tried again, this time with my blood, but… it still failed."
Draco was pink in the face, but Harry had a harder time guessing what he was thinking until he actually spoke.
Narcissa looked curiously at her son. "Of course, dear, but whatever would you wish to discuss with your old mother?"
"I - I didn't-" Hermione stammered. "The Healers just told me to stay home, bed rest and everything, but they never really explained why."
"Well, maybe she's just really not there yet, Ron," Harry said, relieved. "Remember, Muggles don't usually marry until they're well into their twenties. Sure in the Wizarding world, we come of age at 17 and build up our careers from then on. But in the Muggle world, it just means more schooling after. So marriage doesn't actually come into the picture for most people until they're about 25."
"Stop putting words in his mouth, Ronald!" Hermione admonished her husband. "Ginny's got every right to do what she wants, especially since she's been working so hard for it!"
?" he asked for the sixth time. He was sure that his face was now a fool's mask, but he couldn't care less, because Harry-bloody-Potter had just casually proposed a possible solution to his temporary safety, as if the repercussions were a mere toss of a coin.
Harry noticed that Malfoy seemed to have a lot on his mind, though he felt like he knew why. "Did your mother want to be more hand-on with your, what was your term, child rearing?"
Draco had tried to keep his mouth closed, like a proper Malfoy should. But his jaw had dropped, and it didn't even matter to him that he was in front of the fucking Minister. He was allowed to be in shock!
Draco raised his eyebrow, but settled in one of the chairs near his wife, prepared to focus on the most recent issue of
Settling further into the cushioned backrest, he closed his eyes and let out a deep sigh. The only times he remembered spending this much time in front of the hearth was when he had to either make or take a Floo call to Potter during the Eilert case.
Harry felt a pang of something as he had a moment of reminiscing. It had been a while since he, Ron and Malfoy had gone for their boy's night. If he were honest with himself, he missed it a bit.
Draco chose his words carefully. "If you hadn't been relieved of the stress you were exposing yourself to, your magic would have weakened... and stopped supporting Hugo... and yourself."
"Harry, please don't talk like that," Ginny said, tears in her eyes. She scooted as close to Harry as he would allow. "I'm sorry," she whispered, "I'm really sorry, Harry. Please. I love you so much, and I never want you to forget that. I've loved you through every little up and down that we've had, through all the shite we've been through, I love you and James so much... so, so much..."
"You really want this," she asked, but it was more of a statement. Draco nodded, a smile slowly growing on his lips.
The afternoon found Teddy taking a nap and the two wizards settled in front of the television, now watching
He couldn't get her out of his mind. Her eyes, her smile, her defiant expression that played upon her beauty in a mesmerizing way.
Hi, everyone! So this is the start of my first Drarry Fanfic ever, and I'm hoping some of you will like it as much as I have loved other awesome works here on Ao3  :) You should know that the entire plot is already laid out and complete, so I will be updating by chapter every week or every two weeks :) Enjoy!
"I'm sure Hermione will figure it out," Harry said soothingly, patting the blonde softly on the arm. Being in the same couch made it a lot easier for them to comfort each other more efficiently.
Harry's breath seemed to stop flowing. He was too shocked by what they had just uncovered by chance. It was something, a bigger picture, that only the most trained could process at a glance. Of course Harry and Ron were right at the top of that list - they had invented the process after all. That made it feel even worse.
As if the situation hadn't already been awkward, it escalated when Lady Greengrass bluntly announced, "I hope our negotiations do push through, Narcissa." She gave a squawky laugh. "I'm quite sure your son and my daughter would make such a lovely couple!"
"I was alone, and I was about to die, but you know what? I reminded myself that I was doing it for the people I loved. I was scared, but that made me realize that the love I felt for my friends and my family, and the love they felt for me, that was a kind of strength that shone from inside. You - you have to be strong to be able to carry someone else in your heart."
Ron and Hermione emerged from the kitchen at that very moment, laughing about something. Harry suddenly felt quite happy and whole, as if he was seeing the entire picture of the family he had always wanted. Here he was, spending a sunny Saturday with his two best friends, his son and his godson. Then there was Malfoy, who, for some reason, fit into the grand scheme of things according to Harry's intuition.
Ginny looked imploringly at the woman discreetly casting her diagnostic spells. "How do you think it happened?" she asked.
As he straightened out the collar of his dress robes for the fifty sixth time that hour, he glanced at Astoria, who had been looking at him with a patronizing look on her face. He rolled his eyes. "Yes, yes, I'm ready, darling. Shall we?"
His tone clearly told Draco that he was aware of the fact that during his monthly interviews with the Aurors, he was casually consulted regarding cases that revolved around potions and poisons. Draco could hardly call that service, since he welcomed the challenge the Aurors gave him every time they had a new puzzle they couldn't solve on their own.
"Well?" Harry prompted again. He was slightly nervous since her opinion mattered very much to him. Getting his own place had been a priority, since he didn't fancy living alone just yet in Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. When he and Ginny had kids, maybe then they would probably use that as the family home. For now, however, Harry was ecstatic to have a place to call his own.
"You're a glutton, Ronald," Hermione admonished, before serving everyone else a portion of the dessert.
"You just don't talk about it," Draco finished for him. He was already starting to see just how much Potter might be hiding. "I reacted badly as well."
: Well, my congratulations to you both. We hope to bear witness to your bonding ceremony. Surely the readers would love to read about the affair straight from the source.
Draco couldn't help but smirk. "Oh, I'll bet the entire staff couldn't resist waiting hand and foot on their bloody savior, could they?"
"That makes sense," the blond said, amusement in his grey eyes. "I swear, the conversations I have with you lot...and we've only just got here." It was then that he seemed to notice their empty glasses and gestured towards the barman. "Another round, then?"
"Damn it, Potter, do I have to spell it out for you?! It doesn't matter how far away or for how long your Weaselette is gone. The wards only fail in two conditions, and worse if it's both: if the emotional connections of your magical cores aren't in sync anymore, or... if one's magic is unstable and fluctuating, such as during a very stressful pregnancy..."
Just like the last time, Harry and Ron had arrived on time, but Malfoy, ever the gracious host, had arrived just before they did in order to welcome them inside. As it was after dinner, Viridian was packed with patrons. However, Malfoy had had the foresight to reserve their usual booth in the corner ahead of time. Of course, he also had ownership rights to throw around just in case, but thankfully, in Harry's opinion, it never got to that.
"Just you wait," Draco threatened. He could feel the resistance on his appendages give just a tiny bit, which meant there was a chance he could overpower it through sheer force of will. But that was a bit of a challenge, given everything he'd been told.
"Ginny's missing out on her own son's life," Ron gritted out. "I know, she's my baby sister, and I do love her, but I think she's started to take this for granted."
A suspicious look flitted onto Malfoy face, but it passed by so quickly that Harry was sure he'd only imagined it. Instead, the new father seemed to change his tactics. "Did Pansy put you up to this? Or perhaps Blaise?" Malfoy demanded.
"You will. You're Harry Potter. You're destined for great things, it's just who you are. I bet you, you'll find her in the most unlikely of places. Then you'll eat your words."
"She's preggers, my wise friend," Pansy drawled. "It's not the easiest thing in the world, you know? It turns angelic little girls into the Devil, I tell you. And I speak from experience."
"So," Weasley was saying, "the only actual suspect we've got in custody is Hal Pince, but unlike the ones we've apprehended in the past, he'd had a mental failsafe in the form of a custom-cast Memory Charm placed on him in advance. The Obliviators still haven't been able to conclude if it was a modified Obliviate, or something new and unheard of."
At her question, a head of messy black hair appeared in the doorway. There was no mistaking that head of messy black hair.
Once he started speaking into the podium charmed with Sonorus, Harry automatically launched into his Boy-Who-Lived motivational speech. He had cringed when Kingsley gave him the list of inspirational sayings that the Ministry expected him to adhere to. The entire DA obliged, of course, because there hadn't really been other choices. After a full hall's worth of applause, one of the wizards seated near them made to start a Sonorus announcement, clearly believing the boy to be done. To everyone's surprise, however, Harry stopped him with a wave of his hand. Here we go, he thought to himself, taking a deep breath.
Ella was still speaking. Apollo's spell had faded with no results. "That's it, no hits on a William Howe. If he's our guy… it's no wonder he's hard to pin down."
The last two months of living together was quite an experience. Despite Ginny moving in with him two years ago, she had had training every weekday, and was home only at nights and in the weekends. Now that she was on leave for a quarter (she had to reapply regularly), it was like she and Harry had had to get used to actually being each other again. Part of it, of course, was that Ginny had to relearn how to handle James. They had already gotten down the feeding, burping, changing nappies and his sleep schedule. Ginny had absorbed it all like a sponge, which Harry was grateful for. He was now getting enough sleep, and she wasn't as exhausted from training, so they were able to alternate.
"Your family has been threatened, Malfoy," the man deadpanned. "There's no higher security that we can provide. We don't even know who or what exactly might be 'taken' from you, we have no idea when or where the possible attack might happen. We cannot take this lightly because there are too many unidentified factors for us to be sure of your safety."
"Not my favorite year, either," Harry offered with a shrug. He still got shivers whenever he thought about that night in the graveyard…
"This is really good," Ginny mumbled around her roast beef sandwich. Harry thought it was funny that she could be so informal with table manners, quite like Ron, actually.
Potter snorted. "Officially, they say it's to ensure that the Auror Corps are mentally fit for duty and maximized to the fullest of our abilities. Unofficially, it's just another way for them to keep us in control."
Their conversation was interrupted by Ron's reemergence from the wards. As they all stood up and waited for him to speak, it seemed to Harry that the very air around them flowed with so much love, affection and support, and it warmed his heart. Ginny carefully balanced James on one hip so that she could lay her other arm around her brother's shoulders. Molly gave him a quick hug before inquiring silently with her eyes. Harry could see the Ron's face turning slightly red, and to their surprise, he gave a weak smile.
Perhaps the extended exposure to Draco Malfoy was just too drastic a change to their occasionally spotty Floo exchanges. But he wasn't complaining.
"Is something wrong with your tea?" Potter asked worriedly, lowering his own cup. He made to call Kreacher, perhaps to replace the offending drink, but the blonde waved off his concern.
"Why all this?" he finally said, frown on his face where his Malfoy Mask would usually hid his emotions. "Why even suggest the
Harry didn't expect Malfoy to come in until after lunch, so he spent the morning briefing the team he assembled from his MMI personnel. Ron, of course, had to be the Auror-in-Charge, since Harry was barred from active duty and could only act as supervising Auror. Ernie Macmillan had volunteered, having become one of Malfoy's better friends within the Auror Corps. With them were two other Aurors, Ella Perkins and Apollo Rogers, who were much younger but highly commended for their specializations in Tracking and Surveillance.
After making sure to divert all his calls and mail from his flat to Grimmauld Place, he settled James' bassinet in his room (he adamantly refused to keep him in a separate bedroom while he slept) and carried his son to the drawing room, where a cheery fire had been stoked by Kreacher. For the first time in a while, Harry felt relaxed and calm. He knew that Hermione would probably berate him for having Kreacher serve him again, but at that moment he couldn't care less. It was just him and his son, and he needed all the help he could get without bringing any more people into his business.
The Leaky Cauldron was always the go-to place for wizards in London, but Harry decided that he and Ron needed a much quieter environment. For this reason, it was at one of the more exclusive and hidden pubs that they found themselves in, settled in a booth and nursing their pints. Of course, no one bothered them, not having recognized who they were as Harry had wished.
"Yes, but that was about Ginny leaving," Hermione countered. "Not of the nature of their actual relationship."
"Ah," Draco nodded noncommittally, understanding that this made his ex nemesis unsure of what to say. "Yes, that sounds just about right, that man was never in the heat of things, the useless bastard, but he did have the occasional exposure to actual relevant information. How very fitting for a man who was, quite literally, a rat." He was trying to make it sound off handed and casual for the sake of Potter, and it seemed to have worked a little, as the Auror's lip twitched as if he were trying not to smirk.
"Oh, I recall now, it was at a bookshop some years ago. Yes, that's right," he said smugly, eyes narrowing as if challenging Draco to remember.
"Well," Draco finally said. "I don't usually talk about any of this, you know, but once again you've proven to be the exception."
"Malfoy," Harry said, his voice suddenly laced with trepidation, but also pride. "I'd like you to meet my son, James."
"That's... is that what you plebeians do?" he asked, though without venom. "Purebloods have much more to worry about, and child rearing is only one of the many responsibilities."
There was a long silence, and Harry felt no inclination to break it. Before long, Ginny finally turned her body so that her face was hidden from him.
Draco sat back in shock. Having nightmares of echoes was one thing. But having a nightmare and then finding out it was all real... he didn't think he could handle that. When Potter sent a full glass towards him, he gladly took it and had a generous gulp before staring at the Auror once again.
Potter's wistful smile was somewhat of a shock. "It's going to sound weird, to be honest, but... you've always been one of the constants in my life. Regardless of all the shit we've both been through, and all the hero worship on my end, and the stupid prejudice from your side, I find it comforting that we can always depend on our old rivalry to fall back on. It's like, we can't help but be at each other's throats all the time, but it feels almost right."
"Mama! Mamaaaaaa!" a delicate voice suddenly pierced their bubble of happiness, and Hermione stood up, brushing off crumbs from her lap.
The next morning found the two wizards passed out in front of the TV. Having had to cater to two crying babies halfway through
Draco sighed inwardly. He had no idea either, but he did his best to justify it, as much to himself as to his mother. "I've just been thinking about it... I know that it goes against our traditions, but... I felt this... need... I can't explain it, Mother, but I... I want to be a part of his naming as well."
." So now they were finishing up their pancakes, bacon, egg and toast, with Malfoy regaling Hermione with stories of Ron's antics on their event-filled night out.
Harry let out a breath that he had been holding. "I didn't expect you guys to actually argue about this. I was thinking of just letting out some of my frustrations and thought you'd deserve at least an explanation. Please don't argue for our sake. Ginny's back where she belongs-"
Sure she had been away during the day, but she always came home at night. Sure, they barely even met up because she was home late and gone early, but she always come home at night.
"He asked if he could place some diagnostic charms on me to find out if I had caught something. You know how those take at least one day before they can be interpreted by Healers?"
Draco slapped him on the arm this time. "I thought you were supposed to treat your house guest with the utmost respect and deference."
"In any case," Narcissa went on as if he hadn't interrupted, "I've noticed that you have become more withdrawn in the last few days."
Narcissa made a face. "You did. And yes, I saw that you were happy. And still are. But I see now that it is a different kind of happiness. For it is when you are with Scorpius, or with your new friends, that I see such a fierce joy and contentment reflected in your eyes that it overshadows what happiness you might share with Astoria."
"Those are the basics," Draco drawled impatiently. "But therein lies your slight oversight. You see, the infinite nature of
"Look," he said, trying to even out his tone. "I don't know how many more times I can say this, but please,
"What, with the temperature?" Draco scoffed. "Just a minor rise causes my son to feel discomfort, so I've dealt with it proactively since I found out. It's been difficult since Astoria prefers warmer climes, so we have Scorpius' rooms on a different setting from the rest of the Manor."
"Yeah, but why do we have to work harder at this than everyone else?" he said, finally voicing out one of his greater sources of doubt. "I can't help but think that this life isn't really the one you want. That I'm not the one you thought you wanted..."
Astoria squeezed his hand gently. "I refuse to let this stupid letter ruin our time here," she said, and Draco was glad to observe that she was almost back to her sweet but haughty manner. "So long as we are within the estate, nothing can happen to us."
He let out the breath that he didn't know he had been holding. He moved closer to Ginny, saw her happy tears, and he wasn't even ashamed when he realized that he, too, was crying. He kissed her, gently, but deeply. "I love you," he told her, over and over, "I love you."
Ron and Hermione had finally gone late into the afternoon, and Harry now found himself very much alone with Ginny, whose blazing eyes matched the sharpness of her tone.
Deep inside, he wondered how it would have been if he had made such a proud announcement when he and Ginny were expecting James. Sure, they had told it to their family and closest friends, but it had been hushed up for James' own safety, and Harry didn't regret it. but reading Malfoy's message brought to his head a picture of the blond and his wife, happily (and exuberantly) celebrating the coming of their long-awaited heir, to the flash of cameras and the scratching of quills. He was sure that this would be on the news, and that witches around the country would be swooning about their adorable little blonde family-
Draco watched in horrified silence as his wife, in all her pale glory, slowly circled him, expressionless eyes transfixed at the sight of her restrained husband.
When Draco nodded his agreement, the elf let out a visible sigh of relief. He wanted to touch the letter out of curiosity, but his paranoid self knew better. "It is from an unknown source, but made it through the wards. Has it been checked for malicious charms or Dark Magic?"
He led her to a door off to the right, which led to a stairway. The couple went up the steps to reach another door at the landing. Ginny frowned at Harry, but he just motioned for her to open the door. The sight that greeted her took her breath away.
"Funny you're acting this way, actually," he mused in a curious tone. "Considering you've had a child before already. Surely you know what to expect by now?"
"We need your help with research into the old magical ward, find the reasons why it might have failed for Scorpius. Three of us have already scoured the library, and we've come up with nothing new to add to what Mother has already found before attempting it. You are the only one I know who can help this time…"
"You're not even half as clever as you've led other wizards to believe, eh?" the man said with a smirk.
All in all, Harry thought that the day had gone pretty well, considering that he and his friends had an abysmal history when it came to their plans actually coming to fruition. While Hermione and Ron had talked for almost an hour to Astoria about their anecdotes and warnings on child rearing, Harry found himself being pulled towards a corner by an irritable blond.
The man in question had remained silent, perhaps waiting for Draco to finish what he was saying. "It's too much," was all he could come up with.
Mother and son quietly glided through a hallway, led by two Aurors. The door at the end would lead to the courtroom, where they would have to give their personal testimonies. The Aurors explained some protocol, but both Malfoys merely remained silent. Draco admitted that had he chosen to speak, all of his resolve would seep away and he wouldn't have the strength to face the full Wizengamot to save himself and his mother. He'd rather he saved his words for when it would really matter.
After giving the house elves their orders for the duration of their stay, the couple settled in for the day, exhausted from their international Portkey. Scorpius, seemingly unbothered by his first jump to another country, slept soundly.
Malfoy looked at him with a curious expression on his face, then nodded. "You could say that. Also, I actually put in a joke in there, and you seem to have missed it. I never knew Gryffindors were this slow on the uptake in the morning..."
"No, Draco," Hermione breathed, "it means we've narrowed down the root of it-the reason the magic won't latch onto your son! According to these results, Scorpius' blood doesn't match up with any Black blood at all. If there truly is a hex on him, it's targeting his blood connection to you, which is why his magic isn't working with the Black wards." At Draco's startled expression, she gently took his shaking hand. "We'll find a way to counter it."
"I'm not cheating on Astoria," he said blandly, guessing (correctly) that she was still thinking it. "Why are you so sure that I would do such a dishonor to our family, Mother?"
"Yes, well," she chuckled. "We had been trying for a while, so imagine our joy when we found out. You and Astoria have been pretty busy recently, so you probably just need to get used to the idea. When it sink in, then you both can have the proper celebration you've probably been fantasizing about."
Hermione's inquiry snapped him away from his thoughts, and his suspicious gaze fell automatically on the seemingly innocent piece of paper the brunette was offering to him.
Draco laughed at that. He hadn't expected Potter to be so direct and honest. It was refreshing, to say the least. "Well, is there any particular reason for calling, then?" he asked. "I'm sure I sent you that letter requesting for leave-"
This felt too surreal for Harry. "At this point in time, you're supposed to try the Cruciatus, and I'm supposed to accidentally almost-kill you." The fact had been repeated so much that Harry was used to the order of things, even in his sleep, apparently.
Harry couldn't help it. He snorted. "That guy will always have an agenda, Gin, but nowhere near as bad as you make it sound. He's just not good at being evil."
Potter also got his closure; the brothers explained, under Veritaserum and out of fear of the Aurors, that they had used the secret weapon of their forebears to provide a highly controversial service to families who like the Eilerts, wanted to take only specified individuals, even against their will, into marriage. The only common factor among all the deceased victims was that they were previously engaged to someone who was desired by one of the Eilerts' clients. This service had been going on for years, but the carelessness of Hal Pince had proven to be their downfall. The deaths were supposed to look like accidents or suicides, but Pince had apparently failed at that - he had used the potion on the victims but had simply messed up the dosage. Such a simple oversight had taken down a long-standing serial murder case, which once again had proven Harry's claims over the MMI's success rate. Later, he had taken great care in recording every corner of their minds and memories to add to the official reports. Before any of them knew it, the case was brought before the Wizengamot, and finally closed. With both Eilerts, as well as their conspirators (quickly hunted down) taken into Azkaban, and all records and ingredients of the potion confiscated, the MMI were given a commendation by the Minister for Magic himself, and Draco given a special recommendation within the Department of Mysteries.
"Or perhaps celebrating?" Harry offered. "Maybe they've realized their long-standing feud was stupid. I mean, here we are becoming proper mates and everything."
The child had the decency to look guilty, though still with a smile on his face. "I'm sorry, Draco," he mumbled, "Granma said you could be hurt if I did that without thinking. Did I hurt you?"
"After three years of marriage to you, I have yet to develop a tolerance for your unmatched ego." At Draco's smirk, Astoria kissed his cheek, squeezed his arm and they turned on the spot.
Draco bit his lip. He hadn't thought he'd ever see his wife, let alone his own mother, lose their head when they were always so good at controlling their reactions. Perhaps he had been experiencing the whole thing differently, being under Harry's personal safety net and not a mere Fidelius.
That hadn't been too bad of a conversation between them, so he felt rather good about it. He couldn't get over Potter's arms though! One thing he hated was not being able to make sense of something. He truly despised being ignorant. Especially where the speccy git was concerned.
The slightly sparring tone seemed to have encouraged the blond more, since he actually smiled. "Good to know," Malfoy said before turning on his heel and walking towards the door. Right before he stepped out, he turned back to Harry.
Astoria's answer made Draco's eyebrow go so high that it threatened to disappear behind his forelock. He turned his gaze back to the woman by the door. "Who are the visitors? Are they part of the list previously approved by my mother?"
"Don't you dare laugh at me, Draco Malfoy," she warned jokingly. "I've been told to eat for two, you know, and I don't intend to skimp on the quality."
Harry couldn't help barking out a laugh at that. "Ha! I wish! It's not like I can leave my own New Year's party though, can I?" Otherwise he would have already nicked his Firebolt and gone off the roof hours ago.
Harry narrowed his eyes at Ginny until she finally nodded. "I've had to be away several times. It caused a bit of a problem with our home life and my training schedule has also been more rigorous due to the approaching season."
"So are you planning on a large family, then?" he blurted out before being able to stop himself. The look was so tender on Malfoy's face that it was obvious to him.
"I told you already, there's no need to thank me," the blond said, somewhat impatiently. "And your coffee's obviously done. Any plans on heading back soon?"
"Nothing, really," Harry said, shrugging, taking the used cups and glasses and Banishing them into the kitchen. "He just Firecalled out of the blue and said he'd wanted to talk."
"You look much better, you know," he said quietly. All that bed rest had done her a big favor. "Tell me, and be honest with me, okay? What exactly is making it difficult? The actual pregnancy, or your absence from work?" He stared her down when it looked like she was trying to evade from his inquiry.
"A bit," Weasley replied. "Not as often as the requests now, but for some reason it's a requirement to have various redundant confirmations archived in the Ministry. The Eilert investigation was examined for a bit, and revisited in the last few months, so new verification was needed."
"Maybe we should stay by the fire," he suggested, hauling his own arse up and leading the way. His two friends eyed him with concern, but followed nonetheless. They'd always had their productive talks by the Gryffindor common room fire, so this was like going back to a time when they huddled by the hearth to concoct their secret plans.
Their hour at the cafe earlier had been filled with Harry's overflowing river of worry and frustration, which Malfoy had taken in stride. He made the proper disgruntled noises at the right times, and even included some choice insults that were like music to Harry's ears. For some reason, the aloof, apathetic, egotistic friend he had in Malfoy was actually enough to distract and de-stress him.
Draco had stayed true to his word; the moment he had gone home, he went straight to the Manor's library, which was home to the vast collection of rare and antique tomes collected and treasured by his ancestors over the centuries. His Mastery of Potions was not just because of his industrious academic and professional endeavors, but also highly dependent on the amazing store of knowledge his family had provided him with at his very home. It was one of the reasons that he was able to exceed the expectations of any potioneer. While many more practitioners now relied on the newest and most updated information for innovation, Draco had appreciated early in life that there was a lot of old theory to be found in older works, which to him opened up even more possibilities for Potions to be learned and relearned, understood and reworked, straight from the oldest masters and their personal notes. He never divulged this secret of his that Severus had taught him well - progress could always be gained by looking back and looking at the roots. That's how he elected to approach Potter's mystery recipe.
Harry laughed to himself. He thought it was amusing that Draco always insisted on calling her by her full name. Probably some pureblood thing. "We're… doing what we can," he answered shortly. "It's not perfect yet, but we’re dealing with it."
Potter acted as though it were a normal conversation though. "That's wonderful, mate!" he said. Draco noticed that the brunet kept his tone light. His smile was no less friendly. "Have you thought of any names?"
"Thank you so much, dear," the woman said, looking like she was on the brink of tears. "Have you had news? About Hermione?" When Harry shook his head, she pursed her lips before speakng again. "You know I'd always reminded Hermione how terribly demanding and highly involved having a child can be.
Narcissa was furious. She had immediately taken Draco's international Floo call from France despite the early hour, and was now trying to make sense of what she had just learned. "Who could have the gall to threaten such an old and esteemed family as ours?" she demanded, before turning to her son. "Have you really no idea?"
He went back to bed, the book he had been reading left forgotten. With a huge grin, he thought about Ron's messily excited scrawl.
"Is everything alright?" Harry inquired with slight concern. It was the first time the matriarch had ever deigned to reach him without going through Draco.
There were 27 items listed, in no particular order. As Potter had said, there seemed to be no logic to the list except for the quantities indicated to the left. It was very detailed, considering that it had been taken from a memory. Draco thought it meant that Pince had seen it more than once to have it retained with this much information.
The plan seemed to satisfy Hermione, except for one thing. "How are you going to keep this up though? You can't be seen getting too chummy with Malfoy since you aren't that close as friends. People who know you," and she looked pointedly at Harry, reminding him that they had friends who were within the wards, "those whom you allow to see you won't react well after seeing you together so often. It would be too weird, maybe even cause suspicion among those who know you."
meant to be a surprise," Harry said. "We would've gone here earlier, actually, but for the fact that we had to drop off the kids at the Burrow first. Ginny would have come with us but she - er - decided to stay with Arthur and Molly. To help supervise."
"This is why he told me expressly that it was a bad idea to tell you of his involvement at all, he said you would react negatively."
He found himself slowly stepping towards her as if drawn by her gravity. He had given up a lot. He had made compromised. But this decision. This was the huge leap that he had never wanted to ask for. This was the grand gesture that Ginny was making to show him that she was serious.
At the precise moment, two Healers came out and motioned for Ron to approach them. As the nervous redhead crossed the hallway to converse with them, Harry walked back towards where Ginny was sitting, holding a sleeping James in her arms.
, just…" Draco watched curiously as Harry tried to think of an explanation, then gave up and just rubbed at his face sleepily before trying again. "I don't really celebrate my birthdays, that's all. The others do, but if I'm by myself I usually forget."
Unfortunately, the happy ambience didn't last. "Er, Harry?" Ron asked hesitantly. "Have you heard from Malfoy yet?"
They were sort of a celebrated couple now due to his somewhat successful rehabilitation of the Malfoy name. Little by little, over the last year, he had made sure to put himself in a good light wherever he went. When his apprenticeship in France became known, the wizarding public seemed to respect him more until he was no longer the ex-Death Eater, but a soon-to-be Potions Master. With Astoria in tow, they graced many parties and balls, showing a united front as if to make a statement. Which, of course they were.
Harry stood up instantly, as did Ron, Hermione, and the entire Weasley clan, who had pretty much set up camp in St. Mungo's. The Healer held out his hand to the redheads, and they slumped back down on their chairs. He beckoned to Harry, and led him into the room.
"It's true. It's fact. It's got to be odd that we're absolutely fine just living our own lives apart. I'm starting to think that..."
"Fuck you, Malfoy," Harry said, not unkindly. "And no, I'm not a vampire, though you shouldn't have readily opened up your home to me, you know. Tsk tsk, you know it's basic personal security," he added, this time with a little smirk of his own.
Bright light filled the room. With a sharp gasp, the blond on the bed sat bolt upright and glanced around with apprehension. Then he realized that it was still pretty dark, that he was not under attack, and that an errant ray of moonlight had fallen on his face while he was sleeping and woken him up. With a shake of his head, he strode to the en suite bathroom and stared up at his own reflection in the mirror.
To be frank, it all interested him because of the magic. He had already known that Potter and Weasley had had some sort of a relationship after the war. However, the actual fact had never come to mind in recent years until now, so Draco knew that it was because of the
"No, no," Narcissa insisted. "I realized my mistake. You see, I knew Scorpius was one of your sources of pride and happiness, and he was with you when you went away. It is clearer to me now that I have had some time to reconsider...I did not want Astoria to hear any of this, because she might demand much more from you than she already has. You have already done everything to prove yourself to her, and there is no reason why you should feel the slightest bit of insecurity in that regard. No, I see now that it is your friendships that give you that aura of pure joy, which I so enjoy seeing."
"Sometimes…" Draco whispered, "sometimes it's just hard to admit to myself, that I feel so weak sometimes and have to depend on you. Remember the Fiendfyre? And… at the trials… now this. This binding you've willingly shared with me of all people…"
"What the f- Malfoy, it's a surprise to see you here," she said, sidling up to Harry's side. The Auror didn't move.
Ginny's eyes continued to inspect the living room. Harry gave her a short tour around all the rooms. "Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, kitchen with a breakfast nook and dining room, and an office."
"It would have been someone close enough in proximity to poison both of them. It's unbelievable though that they would go through all this trouble to get into the Malfoy family by marriage. Considering their status right after the war. Who would've wanted in on that?"
"He's still asleep," he said. "But he'll be joining us soon. Though Teddy usually wakes up first, around eight."
It was such a private and tender moment that Draco felt he was intruding. Watching Potter's attention flicker between his son and godson made him feel something in the pit of his stomach. Actually seeing Potter make googly eyes at his son while he arranged the little pillows around him in the bassinet made something in his heart ache.
"What-" Too many questions appeared in Draco's mind as he took another survey of the interior. Now that he thought about it, he could see a bit of the old house that he and his mother used to visit on occasion. Yes, it had been Great Aunt Walburga's, and he used to be scared of this place.
Harry felt a bit of anger at the implication. "If you're hinting that I'm allowing her to walk all over me-"
. Somehow, the fact that he was privy to the blonde prat's private life - the simple joys they accidentally shared - made him all the more determined to get to the bottom of this whole issue. Knowing that Draco's very mind had been tampered with was the last straw. He knew the man well enough to know that he would not react calmly if he found out. They would tell him eventually, but not yet.
"Of course," his mother said, true to Draco's fear. She turned to him. "Darling, we've already set a few dates in order for your two to better acquaint yourselves before we think of pursuing anything more serious."
"Odair just Firecalled," she said slowly, her voice like heavy syrup. Her eyes kept darting back and forth between Harry and the fire as if she couldn't stand to look long enough at either.
Draco was carrying an enthusiastic Scorpius around the grounds of their French manor, safe within its wards, when the popping sound of a house elf's appearance startled both of them.
"Well, let me put it this way. The only common things we had in our vision of the future was James. Not so much of each other," he clarified bitterly.
He drained the last of the Firewhiskey and sent the glass to the sink. He felt much better now after the Ogden's, and despite the odd experience with Malfoy, he could now be properly elated at the news that the potions master had brought him. The case would finally move forward, which meant getting closer to the culprit. Putting his faith on Malfoy's skills had proven to be a good call, and he was glad that it wasn't in vain.
His private study was as immaculately maintained as himself. Nary a book was out of its proper place, and god forbid if a house elf left a speck of dust anywhere within the room. Sinking into an armchair by the fire, Draco instinctively thought of Flooing Blaise, but then realized the ungodly hour and reminded himself to do so much later. The chair was cozy, and his mind drifted off to those days right after the war when his life had changed course. No doubt that another upheaval was coming his way... but Draco decided not to think about the upcoming trial until the very last moment.
"Hmmm…" Harry could feel his brows scrunching together beyond the limits of anatomy, he was just so frustrated. Hearing the news about Scorpius really made him more determined.
Taking out the list, he perused it and made marks next to each item - a systematic set of symbols he had developed to help himself keep track of magical properties and other characteristics. In Potions, it was very difficult to categorize ingredients, as there was much overlap among even the most varied items. Draco's personal symbols allowed him to note many things at once, allowing him to observe patterns that he may have missed the first time.
Ron laughed. "I remember Luna's dad telling us how rare they were, and that he had only managed to get seeds by going somewhere far..."
"I don't want this to be even bigger than it already is," Harry whined. "Bringing in the team, even for just research, will be putting too many people involved. I'd prefer to keep this between ourselves for now. If possible, just between Ginny and me," he added.
Eyebrow raised in surprise, Draco retraced his steps back into the house. The only individuals who could send in mail to this address were blood relations and any others keyed in specifically into the wards. If it was a 'special' delivery, it could be any form of emergency from back home, which made Draco anxious.
"Harry," she greeted, and they hugged briefly before she leaned away, still gripping Harry by the shoulders. "Thank you so much for doing this. I know you've been busy with James, and Molly is up all night tending to Hugo..."
"Anyway," she continued, "are you quite sure you'll be alright just staying here? There's always still the option of having the elves keep Scorpius for the night while we stay in-"
"Would you like to have lunch here?" Harry asked them all. Ron and Hermione nodded enthusiastically, wanting to spend as much time with Ginny again. Harry called to Kreacher, instructing him on what to prepare for their meal. He didn't want to waste time cooking everything himself when he could spend it catching up with Ginny and his best mates. In a wink, they all settled themselves around the fire, now talking more intimately now that Malfoy had gone.
(In case you were wondering about the characters, I am writing them based on book canon, since I am challenging myself to work within the existing universe to create a realistic but different storyline that is Drarry :D Apart from that, I added a few of my own assumptions based on canon, such as Harry's tendency to feel at fault for everything and his need to have a purpose and be 'useful' because of his childhood with the Dursleys. I also imagine that Draco would have such a strong sense of pride instilled that his main motivation will always to undo what his Father did and make a new name for himself. I hope you guys are enjoying it so far, and thank you for taking the time to read my work!)
"But…" Draco felt his brows furrow as he gathered his thoughts, "I thought that the message was only sent there because Astoria and I were scheduled to be there…this means…"
Harry shrugged. "Ginny has really bad mood swings. Though it's not like I would know, since I barely get to see her anyway..."
Malfoy seemed taken aback by the sudden change in the ambience. "How did y- never mind. I - I need your help. You and Weasley. I know it's early, but -"
"They care for you!" Harry said, his voice rising in volume to match hers. "We all do! I don't know about those barmy codgers you work with, but I'm sure as hell that Molly, Ginny, Ron and I are fucking worried about you, but we have no idea how to go about it because you always end up chewing someone's head off before we even get a word in!" He took a deep breath - he hadn't blow up this way in so long. "There's something wrong here, Hermione, and you need a reality check because whatever it, it's affecting everything and everyone around you. I came here to tell it to your face, because I'd rather be the difficult friend instead of the one that doesn't do anything to show he cares." He stopped speaking, having run out of breath. She of all people should know what he was trying to do for her - she had done it quite often during their schooldays. She was his voice of reason then, and now Harry could be hers, even if she didn't want to hear it.
as Harry had promised. James was happily playing with a magical set of blocks in front of them, while an enlarged play pen held the tottering pair of Albus and Scorpius.
"You think the wards failing are a sign?" she asked suddenly. When Harry shrugged, she looked back down at the carpet and stared at it. She was no longer crying, but her eyes were red. "It makes sense when you look at it from a larger perspective," she mused. "If our... emotional connection isn't even in sync anymore, our relationship must be under tremendous stress. Our magic must be trying to satisfy the engagement bonds and failing miserably because we haven't been satisfying the unspoken rules of old magic..."
Malfoy looked up when he heard his son's name. "Scorpius? I want the very best for him! I don't want to be... be like..."
There was a bit of an awkward moment then. Harry was aware that Malfoy and Ginny had always been right on the edge of polite for the most part, but their relationship was even less than an acquaintance and more of a reluctant tolerance for each other's presence. Thankfully, a shriek from the hallway told Harry that Hermione had just come out from Teddy's bedroom and seen her sister-in-law. Ginny immediate ran towards her, with Hermione trying her best to waddle into the sitting room.
That morning found the Malfoy heir pacing back and forth in his mother's private sitting room. Narcissa had long given up on distracting him from his thoughts. Draco knew that his restlessness was cause for her concern, but he also knew that she remained passive in order to allow him to address her first.
"Forgive me, my son," the woman said softly. "It's just that... seeing how you are with Scorpius... I had been afraid that he would live through the same rigid standards of your... father's family. But watching how you are with him, the way that your face just lights up at the sight of him, that is what brings tears of joy to my eyes."
"And how would that make you exponentially happier than you usually are?" Narcissa queried with curiosity. "You go out on such endeavors with Blaise and Pansy, though without the same results. Or perhaps there was something different about Misters Potter and Weasley?"           It was then that Draco realized that Potter's wards would not allow him to share what was the most probable reason for his inexplicable happiness. Not that he would have betrayed the trust, of course. He was a man of his word, and he felt like it was something he would have to prove to his new friends, if that was what they were now. Surely being invited into the
Ginny nodded. "You're too good to be true, Harry Potter," she said, wrinkling her nose. "I beg to differ. I think we both somehow contributed, but I agree, any kind of blaming will only make things worse. I myself admit that I've a lot to make up for, but I'm willing to see how we can make this work, together, since I think we are agreeing that we might be better... not together."
"Your mother is a strong woman," Potter said with a hint of awe. Draco acquiesced with a nod. "Hermione used her cleverness around my panic attacks, she didn't tell me till later that she'd gone through all the books she could about Muggle Psychology and helped me get through my PTSD without me really knowing it."
Harry didn't even bother himself as she hurried out the bedroom. He just closed his eyes and counted to a hundred. He never even knew what number he was on when she had gone. He was deep in his head, in his cupboard under the stairs. He just kept counting. And counting. And counting...
Harry shook his head to clear his thoughts. Draco was leaving already? He had gotten so used to having him around for much longer.
"Ron, all Harry means is it's not what every woman wants. Being a dedicated housewife and matriarch is a very honorable and difficult decision to make, and look how happy Molly's been with how you all turned out," she said, smiling. "Look at me, I'm perfectly happy balancing our family life with a career, and it suits us just fine. Everyone has their own way of handling things."
His well-touted patience, however, was wearing thin these days, and he often found himself collapsing into his favorite armchair by the fire nursing a glass of Ogden's Finest. He felt oddly at peace whenever he did so, though he couldn't for the life of him figure out why.
"I am. But it's nice to see you've been keeping up with my social calendar, Potter," the blonde answered. Harry was about to think of a comeback, when he immediately noted the tension in his friend's expression, the tight pull of his frown and the uncertainty of his tone. In a second, his brain switched modes.
: (fixes hair) Oh, well, thank you very much. I had no idea, but that's - wow, I hope I've done alright by them.
As Harry and Ginny dug into their food, one of the patrons looked in their direction and gasped with recognition. As expected, the rest of the room followed suit, with men, women and children laying eyes on the Chosen One and his companion. Harry and Ginny remained oblivious to the attention, focusing instead on the funny story that Ginny was sharing as Harry took another bite of his meal. One man stood up and left abruptly.
"Sorry, sorry, I completely forgot all about it. Don't even know how he remembered," Harry said grumpily from behind the pillow.
Draco was speechless, though amused. His drunken head conjured an image of Potter breaking down walls like a crazed Muggle, which made him giggle. That alone told him that he had had a lot to drink already.
Narcissa's expression told Draco that she was slightly shocked. She had always been more supportive of his latest decisions, but always made sure to be graciously neutral. She always did make a great Devil's Advocate.
"Yes, oh," Ginny said, nodding her head with amusement, as if talking to a toddler. "Let's be realistic here. I love you, Harry, I really do and I love our boys, but think about it. Somewhere along the way, it'll be inevitable. You and I both will eventually meet someone, fall
"Fuck that, you're just kipping on my couch until you get sick of it and Floo back to your own fluffy, pretentious bed."
"And oh, what a wonderful happenstance that you just bumped into the loveliest and most intriguing witch you'd ever laid your eyes on!" His tone was dripping with mockery once more. "It was just good luck that your future wife was there looking for the same exact book, eh?"
But Malfoy seemed to be different now, Harry reflected. He observed the potions master talking with Teddy, who seemed to have been excited to find out that he had a cousin. While they talked animatedly, Harry had an internal debate with himself. Andromeda took the chance to talk to him while Malfoy was preoccupied with her grandson.
"What? It's the truth," the mystery man interrupted, casually tapping his finger repeatedly on the back of his chair. "How you never discovered it is still beyond me. But like I said, I don't think you're every bit as clever as you believe. Let me spell it out for you. That. Brat. Is. Mine."
It was close to three in the morning, and he didn't want to interrupt Astoria's much-needed beauty sleep. With the round-the-clock attention from the nursing house-elves that Narcissa had arranged, he and his wife could enjoy more time for rest and relaxation, and he knew that they needed to be refreshed come morning.
Ron was scowling. "How could you let her leave her responsibilities like that? You're too lenient about it, mate," he said. "She's already done this to you once, I can't believe you'd let her walk all over you like this-"
"Have the two of you discussed the matter yet?" Narcissa asked sweetly, acting as if she hadn't been asking that repeatedly for the last weeks. Draco rolled his eyes, but Astoria surprised him by answering her mother-in-law bluntly, but as politely as she could.
"That's what I mean, dear. Hermione has always been quite the lively girl. She hadn't been exposed to rigorous and tiring activities, she only went between the home and the Ministry. But the difference was that she went ahead and put most of herself in her work- Oh, it's not a bad thing, Harry!" she said when he had been about to defend Hermione. "I fully support her career ambitions, of course! But the way she involves herself in her work affects her in such a negative way. Ron tells me that she tends to bring home whatever foul mood she picked up throughout the day. That kind of stress was bound to have affected Hugo, because she was exhausting herself in every way.
Harry rolled his eyes. Only with the Weasleys could he joke about his status as Savior and Chosen One without it being uncomfortable.
Weasley clapped him on the back. "Remember when this happened to me and Mione?" he asked. "Well, I'm returning the favor and telling you that Ginny is a strong horse and she'll make it out of this just fine."
Harry sighed. "And I want my life with you, Ginny. Not this fucking charade that we've ended up with over the last year. I can't share a life with you if you aren't even here to share it with. And we both know that ripping you away from your dreams, when you're so close to it, isn't exactly something you'd appreciate. But we've got to make a choice here. It's not just for our sakes anymore, Gin. All my decisions so far have been about you. About you and James. I think it's high time that you start thinking beyond yourself, think about what your choices mean for you, for us, for James."
"I told you," Harry insisted, "the names of the stuff were really obscure, so we think it's written either in code, which is unlikely for the bloke we got the memory from, or in a sort of potioneer's shorthand. We only know it's a recipe because of the quantities written before the names."
Sure, it had taken time, but Harry had finally realized that he, too, wanted the world to know how happy he was with Ginny. Like now, with the fantastic news about her being invited officially into the Harpies; it filled him with so much pride for her accomplishments, and he wanted to make sure everyone knew it. He wanted it known that he loved her and was proud of her.
"Our betrothal contracts were written so as to favor our respective needs for ambition, and we both still have those drives to take care of even now. I don't believe much has changed in our situation except for the new heir. My career and interests just happen to be more lenient than Astoria's demanding and Portkey-setting lifestyle. I see nothing wrong with taking my own son away from his nurse elves a few times a day, even if it means missing some unimportant or redundant parties."
, from interfering with his personal life... Of course it's a mess! Add to that the fact that Harry actually spoke for the Malfoys at their hearing, without prior warning except to the higher ups.. Well, everything's a bit overturned at the moment, because people are trying to adjust to the new policies regarding both harry and the Malfoys."
Harry woke up and groggily sat up in bed. Something had woken him suddenly, though he couldn't remember what. From downstairs, he heard the muffled sound of James crying, and he was immediately on his feet and pounding down the stairs.
This morning had been a perfect portrait of a happy family in Harry's eyes. And he knew that now, with Ginny coming back to him, it was even more complete. Overwhelmed with their emotions, both he and Ginny fell to the floor, kneeling awkwardly and still holding tight to each other, finally breaking down from the sudden release of tension, their tears flowing unashamedly. Neither made a move to stand, or to leave. It had been a long six weeks, after all.
"You did what you could, Draco," Harry whispered sincerely. "No matter what your Father may have wanted for you, to follow in his footsteps or become the perfect pureblood heir…You've done well in the last few years. Clearly, your mother is proud of everything you've accomplished for the family name. You're in no one's shadow."
"Drink. I've put a Hangover Cure in our tea." The amusement was clear in his voice, "Kreacher thought we'd all need it, especially the git over there."
It was Narcissa's turn to be under the spotlight, and Draco could see that she loathed his decision to turn the tables on her. "I was merely working from conjecture, dear," she said softly.
Harry let him have the silence needed to gather his thoughts. The fact that the man had actually agreed to step into his Floo in his sleepwear was kind of a hint of how serious his desperation was.
"Yeah, I know. But can't you at least come back here earlier than what you'd planned?" He hated that she wanted to be away with the team all the way until her seventh month, or Merlin forbid, the eighth if she could find a way around it. "I wan't you home, safe. I want our little boy or girl safe."
"Malfoy," Ron said, "we need your help to figure out what the ingredients are, and what they could possibly be made into."
Harry was confused. "No, and no," he answered smoothly. "Thought I was aware that both of them are currently abroad, I would have come by here regardless of their presence or not. We do want to be here for you, I don't know why you can't get your head around the fact."
Surely, he thought to himself as he wandered the expansive garden behind the east wing, his mother would be unbearably smug for the next few days. She always was when she was right. Perhaps it was time that Draco admitted that.
"I'm sorry," Potter suddenly blurted out. His bottle green eyes were on the floor, and his hands absentmindedly fidgeted. "For earlier, I mean. I didn't mean to get angry or anything."
When he was in bed that night, Harry found himself tossing and turning. Ginny, used to his nightmares, carefully moved him to a safer position and cast the usual set of Cushioning Charms before falling asleep again.
The trainees groaned but did as they were told, running around the field at full sprint, while the intimidating Auror Philius Stone took notes on their progress. After the lap, the trainees were close to collapsing, and it was obvious that most of them were fighting away the fatigue in order to prove their resilience in the face of such torture.
"Yeah, I discovered this place when I visited the flat for the first time." He had grabbed a bite to eat here that day, and found that their deli was to die for. He figured even someone as snobby as Malfoy would fall in love with the chefs here.
"Malfoy? Draco?" Potter inquired, slightly worried when the blond hadn't responded the first time. The use of his given name brought Draco back to reality, and, for reasons he could not fathom, it helped to steel his resolve.
Which, to Draco, meant that there was a lot more that was going on beneath the surface. What concerned him, however, was not the fact that there were problems to uncover, but the realization that he wanted to make Potter feel better about it somehow.
The man simply joined in his laughter. "For now," he agreed. "Not for long, I wager. We never seem to run out of problems to complain about, so it's only a matter of time."
She nodded. "It's something I felt you needed to know. I've already gone through all the ancestral documents we retain in the library and consulted every record of the Malfoy wards. The only logical explanation there is for the first letter to have come through is if it was invited by someone within."
"I'm sorry," she whispered. "I know how it must feel. It's just...I don't mean to be stubborn, I swear. I guess being on the pitch has always been so important to me, and even with this-" she gestured to her almost imperceptible baby bump, "it sounds stupid but I'm kind of scared that I'll never get back on and live my dream."
Harry laughed at his own thoughts. He had spent most of his teenage years believing he would die -- and he did! -- and the things that normal people planned for, like graduating and getting a job, were just an abstract concept of "the future" that he had in his head. Now that he was actually halfway to getting a career, it seemed even more surreal than the idea of hunting Horcruxes all around Britain.
Draco to him? Because now that he stopped to think about it, there was definitely something much deeper than friendship when he thought about the prat.
"Got a lot on your mind?" Ginny inquired, digging into her shepherd's pie (which Harry insisted was subpar compared to his own recipe. Ginny couldn't really tell the difference, both were alright). "You seem to be a bit... off."
Draco's face reflected horror for a second before he expertly schooled his features back into the Malfoy Mask. He still had no words, though.
"If you need something," Narcissa admonished, "I would appreciate you keeping my expensive clothing out of it."
"Can you kindly elaborate for us non-Muggles?" Draco prompted, both scandalized and intrigued. As a Potions Master, he was very well versed in the art and science of magical potions. He had heard and dabbled a bit in Muggle Chemistry in France, but it was mostly for inorganic or inert substances - he knew very little of what Hermione meant.
Another biscuit flew his way, but when he looked, there was definitely a hint of amusement in the blonde's eyes. Somehow, the absurdity of biscuit-throwing between two grown men was accepted.
"Since it is dependent on your magical core, the interaction of the wards are obviously dependent on the interaction of the individual's core with yours."
Ron laughed at the mental image of him and Harry turning over tables in the Ministry. "It was a long time in coming, if you ask me. Harry was the one who realized what was so lacking in the system, and it took a while to convince the Minister. But now everyone can see that the MMI is just what the Aurors needed all these years."
"She'll be fine, Harry," Hermione assured him. "I asked Helen about the magical theory behind the spells they're casting, and she said that it really takes this long to properly invoke the magic they need to safely sever the cores of Ginny and the baby."
"But you already are," he said softly, wrapping her in a hug. "You don't need to prove yourself to anyone. Do those blokes in the Council -"
Stretching his arms above his head, he was suddenly disoriented. Hadn't he fallen asleep in that stiff and stuffy chair? But he was currently laid out on luxurious silk sheets, on a regal four poster, in a room that was no less elegant. To his left, the full length windows had their drapes opened, which explained the sun in his eye and his reason for waking.
Astoria quickly shook her head. "No, no, darling, that won't be necessary," she said in a rush, causing Draco to raise an eyebrow in curiosity. "I don't want you worrying so much about me, Draco." she insisted.
"It seems you are about two months along." Harry nodded in silence. He remembered that that was the second or third to the last time they had been...intimate together before Ginny had gone to Montreal. "Still too early to tell the sex, of course. But I'm happy to report that he or she is perfectly healthy."
"Neither did I, Weasel," he said smoothly. Then he realized that a wizard from across the room was waving him over. "Speaking of work, if you'll excuse me, I really must go. The man over there is there is my six o' clock appointment."
Draco didn't miss the teasing tone, which he oddly appreciated. "At least it's not as dreadfully common and plebeian as yours," he said with an upturned lip. "But I'm sure my sophisticated tongue will eventually get used to pronouncing your first name. But for now, I'll stick with Potter."
"Oh, get that wand out of your arse for a second, mate," Weasley said. "We heard your news, we wanted to visit, and we're here. Now can we properly celebrate?" He gave another clap on Draco's back until there was a ghost of a smile on the man's lips.
Like last time, the walk into the birthing area seemed like a hazy dream, Harry's eyes trained only on fiery red hair. When he approached the bedside and saw her smiling radiantly, his heart felt like it had been released into the sky. He shifted James in his arms.
"Isn't any relationship the same way?" Malfoy asked. "The difference is that in Pureblood traditions, both parties go into the marriage with a clear idea of what to expect. Everything is also clarified in the contract to ensure the happiness of both persons."
that you're the only one who seems to find something about me to whine about, because obviously there's a reason for your months of hard work just to get me here. So what is it, eh? Money? That's something I could have given you freely. Did you just want to humiliate me to my face? That sounds somewhat juvenile, don't you think?"
When Draco nodded, Potter abruptly stood up and fell on his knees in front of the fire in an act of desperation. The blond had to admit that the sudden closing of distance, even through the Floo, was a bit of a shock. "Tell me," Harry said calmly, though Draco sensed the demand behind the even tone of his voice.
Draco perused the list. "You're correct," he said, "this does resemble a typical potion recipe, though the names...hold on." He took a moment to gather his thoughts, since the Slytherin in his had been taught to visit all angles and possibilities immediately. "Has it occurred to your team that this may have been left intact in his memory in the first place? On purpose?"
Harry couldn't stop pacing outside the door, that Ron threatened him with an Incarcerous before he agreed to sit down and relax. Merlin, he never thought it would be this nerve wracking to wait!
"Oh, er, yeah. Well, we pretty much woke up alarmed because Ginny was in terrible pain and... We both got scared because she's got a pretty high tolerance for pain. Possibly more than Ron, in fact-"
Draco felt a tug at his heartstrings at Potter's concern. "What happened anyway? Not like you explained it to me in detail via owl."
She was pale, and her voice shook. "I'm not sure," she whispered. "I just... I know this is already under your investigation, but..."
"Sounds brilliant," said Ron, scooting over and making space again for Hermione. "So Mum and Dad are alright with you spending summer on training then?"
"You're asking me to stay here?' Draco repeated, looking surprised. Harry hoped he hadn't ruined anything by blurting out overnight invitations without thinking about them.
It made sense, Draco realized, from Potter's perspective. But definitely not Draco's. He had recently come to accept the fact that he wanted to finally have a family with Astoria, to hold his son or daughter in his arms and to whisper sweet nothings in the baby's ear as he rocked it to sleep. If his conjectures were true, then Potter was a lucky bastard, and no one even knew it. It made Draco seethe a bit, knowing that it was highly likely that Potter had one thing he didn't. He couldn't hold it against him, of course, but the old rivalry was surfacing in the worst situation possible, and it took all of his willpower to counter such envious thoughts. He was better than that, and he would show Potter. He was also mature now, and would not stoop down to snooping around just to find out more about Potter's dirty little secret. If the Chosen One chose to keep things under wraps, well then let him.
He wheeled around in surprise. The note of stress from his mother's voice tugged at his heartstrings as if on instinct. "Mother," he said by way of greeting. It was very early in the morning, which was why he had chosen the eastern gardens - the sunrise provided such a peaceful vista that it helped to soothe his worries. It also served as an escape when he didn't want to be found, because Narcissa eventually caught on that he didn't want to be disturbed whenever he visited this particular haven. She never did.
"Are you serious?!" Hermione exclaimed, laughing at the expense of her husband. She, Ron and Malfoy had decided to have breakfast together, during which Malfoy and Harry had silently agreed to act as if that morning's conversation had never occurred. Harry could hand it to the blonde, though - he could be counted on to play his part rather well. Maybe all Slytherins were raised to have so many masks ready to be put into place as needed. Malfoy was certainly being the epitome of the ideal houseguest, and was warming up to Ron and even Hermione. Neither Harry nor Malfoy mentioned anything from the previous night, even though they hadn't discussed that prior. Anyway, it didn't seem an issue to either Ron or Hermione that Harry had been holding James in his arms right in front of Malfoy while welcoming Hermione through the Floo.
Ginny was surprised at the sudden shift in Harry's temper. "We have been working it out, Harry," she said softly. "Sure, we don't have the cookie cutter relationship, but... we've worked hard on this, maybe even harder than other people."
"Malfoy has changed," was all that Harry could say, since he felt something in his throat catch after hearing Ginny's words. He swallowed and cleared his throat, before finally having a go at all the flaws he saw in her sudden outburst. "Malfoy's changed, and he went against all our expectations. You, on the other hand, were as predictable as ever, and despite your surprise arrival, we all expected you to be home late, and we decided that there was nothing wrong with having a perfectly normal family day.
"Don't tell anyone, first," he said seriously. He knew his two best friends would respect his privacy anyway. "Not even the family," he told Ron. "It's something that has to come straight from me and Ginny."
"That's right," he nodded. "You know the funny thing? We were totally fine by it. To be honest, I'm not sure if I should be happy that it didn't blow up, or just pathetic because neither of us even wanted to fight for our relationship anymore."
"Malfoy told me that nurse elves take care of children while the parents go back to their careers. Is that normal? I thought it was a bit much."
"Yes and yes," Draco replied immediately. "I admit that it will be very difficult to begin, because as you know, we will be working from so much theory and assumption with regards to the ingredients and how they could be used. But yes, it is 'doable', as you so elegantly put it, Weasley. Not to brag, but only those who have studied the art and science of Potions Making beyond what is expected can understand the very nature of magical ingredients and the subtle way they interact, even in theory. And yes, Potter," he looked pointedly at the brunet across from him, "this could narrow down your investigation and hopefully lead to the capture of the real mastermind. Should we fail, then at the very least, you will still have a better idea of where to investigate next."
Ron slapped his best mate on the back. Harry's eyes snapped open and he looked sheepishly at the red head to his right. He had fallen asleep at a most inopportune time, right in the middle of a speech being made by some local ministry official that Harry had, from early on, decided he didn't care about.
It took him most of five hours, which consisted of much cross-referencing, crossing out notes, crossing over to different shelves, getting cross-eyed, and being irascibly cross, but he was finally able to at least narrow down how the item names were created. It most resembled an archaic shorthand from Scandinavia, and Draco was sure that none of the resident potion masters at the Auror Corps had access to the manuscripts his great-grandfather had kept in one obscure corner of the library. From there, he was able to transliterate the items and note which category they most probably belonged to. The excitement and pride he felt at making two conclusions in just one day made him so smug and ecstatic, and he rushed to the drawing room to contact Potter immediately.
She had hit the nerve. "I...I'm afraid of not being able to… It's not like I had a perfectly good role model growing up." There, he said it.
Harry could relate to that. He, of course, had grown up with Dudley as a sibling of sorts, but they had hardly been close, and they only kept in touch over the years because Harry wanted his own children to have actual blood family to visit once in a while, something that he had yearned for as a kid. When he learned that Dudley and his wife were expecting, he decided that he wanted their children to be able to grow up as proper cousins.
Astoria seemed to consider her answer first before finally speaking, eyes never leaving Draco. "Yes."
"You've lost me." Draco was feeling more perplexed. Was this behavior to be expected? And truly, the child was not part of the plan, but he had thought that they'd agreed he, their son, was a blessing. He had no idea where these sentiments were coming from, nor what they even meant. And who was never letting go?! He certainly wasn't aware of pressuring her in any way...
Their eyes met, and via silent communication borne from years of being in trouble together, they agreed never to mention this conversation, ever.
Harry groaned. The man had no heart, he was sure of it. "What've we got to do this time?" he asked, already admitting defeat. No one had warned him of all the parchment work he'd have to live with.
Draco took a deep breath. (Did it seem exaggerated? No, not for this. He needed enough wind for this). "Well... as you already know, the wards are powered by the magical core and magical intent of the focus..."
When her eyes began to sparkle with tears, she wiped them away with the back of her hand. Harry was surprised. Ginny never cried when she was sad. Only when she was joyous or angry. Perhaps there was always a time for firsts.
The question, so plain and simple, caused a disproportionately heavy feeling in Draco's stomach. Finally steeling himself, he nodded. "Yes, I'll be there shortly."
That night, Draco went through his usual routine. He wished Narcissa a good night. He bid all the house elves to rest. He cleared out his desk and prepared the documents he needed for the next morning. Then, he went to up to his and Astoria's bedroom, and Floo-called his wife (who was staying in Vienna for the weekend). Finally, after his somewhat complicated bathroom ritual, he settled himself into bed and waited for sleep to take him.
The morning dawned with the most beautiful sunrise Harry had ever seen. Or maybe his good mood just made everything so much better. He felt the cool breeze that wafted through the open window; he could taste the scent of breakfast in the air; he could swear that the birds in the tree out front were singing a symphony of victory just for him. He had always cherished this, waking up at the Burrow, amidst the people who were his family in all but blood, but today was different. Today was going down as one of his happiest days ever.
"I'm not quite sure what you mean, Draco." Pansy's voice was full of doubt, even through the flames. Draco had known her long enough to notice it.
"Of course," Draco answered. It was his turn at the till, and he excused himself to pay for his books. When he had been given his change, he turned back to the lady, only to find that she had gone. With a frown, he looked around, but realized that she must have left the shop.
Harry had just settled down into his most worn-down couch with book in hand when the Floo went off. Groaning with frustration, he waved his hand to allow the call, and quite appropriately sputtered when he saw the blond in his fire.
Those weird feelings he got whenever he saw Draco cuddling Scorpius. Or playing poke-the-baby with Jamie.
doing here?" Ginny asked, her voice dropping to a whisper so that neither Ron nor Malfoy could hear.
That was when the endless stream of questions just kept going, and Draco knew that he could do nothing to allay these intimate thoughts - the best he could do at this point was to keep them to himself.
"You're telling me Malfoy might be under the influence of the potion?" Ron asked in disbelief. "After all this time, he might be one of those victims we've been trying to help! What the fuck, mate! What are we supposed to do? Do you think he's already had enough to overdose?!"
"Apart from the odd fluctuations, she hasn't had any serious malfunction. However, it was enough to cause a disturbance in the contraceptive charms so it might be better to monitor this progressively. I would appreciate if you could come in regularly for checkups."
"Just go and talk with your mum," Harry said gently. "You're absolutely lucky that you've got her to talk about your own childhood," he said with a sad smile. "I'm sure she would just love to tell you all sorts of embarrassing stories of your spoiled little arse."
"So I guess they weren't all over exaggerating, pulling me from my work and trapping me here," she said with a slight grimace. "There was a time when I began to resent it, because staying here made me feel weak, useless, and powerless. It took me a quite a lot of pondering, but I finally did realize that I do like being a mother as much as I love my career. I'm good at my job, you see, but I know now that I was going about it the wrong way. Ron and I have talked at length about it, and I think I'm willing to make adjustments so I don't end up creating my own demons again."
Malfoy took the time to walk his guest to the nearest Floo, and patiently waited for Harry to step in and throw Floo powder into the flames.
Draco smiled, shaking his head. Of course his mother would be aware of everything going on in the Manor. "He's already gone, has to look after his... responsibilities," he said, the
"So, Mione," he began nervously. He didn't want to set her off in any way. "I've been meaning to talk to you alone for a while, you know, just to talk." He went for light and casual, but Hermione rolled her eyes at him and sighed dramatically.
A wispy girl interrupted them then to serve their drinks, before leaving (without any recognition, of course).
"Of course," Draco said, shaking his head and settling on the bed next to her. "Are you feeling tired?"
"Astoria has been waiting for you," Narcissa announced when Draco appeared in her side of the Manor. "Something to do with Scorpius, I believe."
and had made headlines by being the sole witness to defend him and his mother. He remembered the feeling of dread and cool acceptance that he and Narcissa had accustomed themselves to. They had not expected a fair trial at all. Suddenly, his domestic woes seemed inconsequential to the topic at hand.
"No, mother," he said immediately. "I had worried when she began speaking nonsense, but as you have said, it's no problem at all. Though the next three or four weeks..."
Now, however, Draco couldn't help but feel as if he were wrong-footed, as if nothing he did could ever appease his wife. He wasn't sure when the doubts had risen to the surface, but Narcissa was right. Astoria had been acting out of sorts a few weeks after Scorpius' birth, and he felt within himself that it was probably his fault.
