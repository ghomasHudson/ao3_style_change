Draco sighs, furrows his brow, and then returns the arrogant, snarky look as he walks towards Harry. His gate is impeccable, but Harry can see anxiety in his shoulders, in the way he swings his arms. He’s come to know this boy so well that he does it without thinking.
Harry notices that Draco doesn’t agree or disagree, just stays silent and leans into Harry’s side, but it’s good enough, for now. Harry wraps him up in his arms as the sun shines warm against their backs. The day is so young, but Harry feels incredibly old, like an elderly man aged by time and by pain, closer to his death than his birth.
He’s witness to it firsthand two days after another article is released. He’s walking with Draco, standing close enough that their arms touch as they move, not saying a word. They do this a lot now, this quiet company-thing, so no one looks surprised, but it still feels new. Maybe the newness comes from the new, light feeling in Harry’s chest as he bumps against Malfoy’s shoulder or the way his breath catches at every soft smile Draco’s willing to give him.
Asks Luna’s partner, Pansy, settling down across from her on the bench with a somewhat annoyed look and exasperated breath.
Their dinner is excellent and cooked to perfection. Some kind of Italian pasta, Harry thinks, with a cheesy green sauce and then tiramisu for dessert.
“I can’t sleep,” he pronounces as he falls into a chair near the bed, basically saying he missed Harry's presence. “I’ve spent three months listening to someone else breathe and talk and stuff and the silence is deafening.”
He can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t
When he arrives at his room, he finds Ron sitting on the foot of his bed, empty pack of cigarettes clutched in one fist.
Harry’s just vomited into the toilet when she’s rapping her knuckles on the door to call him and Draco down. He’s had a particularly volatile nightmare about a juvenile nundu who stalked him through the night, silent as a cat, until he was too weak to go on. Just as the creature stepped over his exhausted body, it breathed toxic cat breath into his face. The smell combined with the knowledge that his death was imminent—whether from the infectious disease in the air or the
Admittedly, he’s a bit nervous. What if Draco tells them not to come? What if he’s already done something irreversible?
She’s recently been integrating Muggle phrases into her vocabulary with unyielding determination and has been outright failing at it. The work she’s putting in to overcome a lifetime of bigotry is truly the more successful thing out of them all, though.
Draco’s eyebrows rise up far on his forehead and Harry almost grins. But then he remembers the look in Draco’s eyes on the night Dumbledore died and the grin passes. His brief amusement fades even quicker than it arrived.
“Good,” Harry grins, feeling better already. “Let’s go eat dinner before Ron thinks you’ve murdered me.”
“Harry?” Hermione holds his face in her hands, looking so worried that she might cry. “Talk to me, Harry, please!”
Harry stumbles to his feet, bumping hard into Draco and falling to his arse. From there, he scuttles back on hand and knee, terrified at what he knows is coming.
This is punishment for the fruit. Harry’s sure something has come to seek revenge for tearing apart that tree and its fruit. Perhaps using the pronoun “its” in reference to the tree is insulting to her, who has enough wherewithal to know when her children are gone, so Harry changes his stance.
Harry rolls his eyes, but sings it nonetheless, “Don’t eat a / Poinsettia / If you do / you better / be ready / to get a tummy ache.”
Loyalty is a trait that Harry most admires, so his fondness grows for the smushed-faced cat after he hears the tale.
There are tears in his eyes as he reaches for him, squeezing his shoulders so tightly it should hurt him enough to squeal, but he doesn’t say anything. Doesn’t move in any way.
Harry finds himself sharing sparks with a lemon-yellow apple. The sparks are small and bright purple and probably harmless. Are probably just a side effect of the magic used to keep the tree and fruit safe in the cold April air.
He doesn’t know what to say to Ron and Hermione anymore and, apparently, they don’t know what to say to him either. It’s not even their fault, not completely, but he’s just not okay as a person right now and he can’t be around people that are. And they are, at least outwardly.
“The Ministry have decided the dates for which you will spend your days in the Forest. Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy will open the exams on the first weekend of April. After that, will be Miss. Granger and Miss. Bones the following weekend and then..."
He calls out again and the forest, despite its usual howls and calls, is quiet. He takes a drink of the water to soothe his throat and then rises, exiting the tent.
He’s a little lightheaded from the potion and exhaustion, but he’s alright. He’s awake and he’s alive.
Harry’s done his best for the year, but frankly, he couldn’t give less of a shit. There weren’t any exams to study for anyway and he’s already survived the Dark Lord, so what can this forest show him that’s any worse than the creature who haunts his dreams? Than his foster parents who locked him in the closet and starved him for days?
“You will be assigned a partner from a different House, assuming we have enough students to do so, who will be your partner all year. You will share a dorm and you will study together. Your partner will be your only assistance in the forest with you, so make friends if you aren’t already.”
That tree may be a tree, but she is also a creature. A mother looking for her young who have been so callously snatched from their beds.
Harry slips a little further from sanity after that. He goes back to his room and lays in his bed. He doesn’t move for almost a whole day. Doesn’t sleep. Doesn’t think. Just stares at the ceiling and forgets he’s a being because he’s so overloaded. So dead inside.
-d from his room so he wouldn’t have to move. There's a plate of barely eaten, three day old cheese toasties and a cold cup of tea beside his new bed that a house-elf had mysteriously brought him.
Patches answers to Harry’s reluctant knock. He grins up at him, all blue eyed and crooked teeth, and hugs his legs tight.
He pulls away from the strength and warmth of her embrace and smiles, nods. He’s going to bring Draco back come hell or high water.
He sneaks out into Hogsmeade just after dinner to Apparate into Muggle London. He’s looking for something a little stronger than his cigarettes tonight and he finds it in an old friend.
which is tricky to use on people when sober, let alone when drunk, but it works for her. Fortunately, too, because it can backfire and cause the entire room to scream SILENCE! all at once.
Harry’s smile is as fragile and eerie as the piano music. He kneels down to hug Patches properly, the way he deserves.
“Awesome,” Harry says, suddenly realizing he’s standing in the middle of a flower bed at 3 am, stoned out of his mind. “Do wizards have the poinsettia song?”
Harry and Draco don’t talk about it, don’t even mention it when they wake in the mornings, just go to their Potions class and sit solemnly next to each other. It’s good. It keeps Harry sane, at least, considering Draco seems to be the only person interested in being around him.
Alright is a funny word to use for what Harry is and looks like. Anxiety flares up in his chest, but he’s not sure why. He doesn’t not want to see Mrs. Weasley, but he’s hesitant. Doesn’t want her to see him, more like.
she truly enjoyed. The house had been dead inside, much like Draco himself, because no one dared oppose Voldemort, their dark Lord.
on his wand tip. Draco says nothing, almost like Harry has stuck his tongue to the roof of his mouth with a
“Beautiful,” he says and Draco takes one of his hands, like he does when they’re both awake from nightmares.
Ron’s sort of bobbing to the beat in place of dancing, so Harry tries to engage him. Notices the glint of the silver band on Hermione’s finger from across the way and physically can't stop himself. Is just drunk enough to have no control over his mouth, no filter.
Draco takes a cautious look at his mother, feeling uncomfortably anxious himself, and nods. Turns on his heel and scampers off towards Patches’ room.
Old Harry, Pre-War Harry, might have done just that here. But this Harry? This broken, battered thing with as many wounds as a dart board Harry? He doesn’t give a fuck about Albus’ memory.
He puts on his shoes, throws on his invisibility cloak over his pajamas, and heads out, creeping quietly through the corridors with the map in his hands like he's in sixth year all over.
Draco kisses him for a long time, until Harry’s wishing he wasn’t so exhausted so they could keep going, but he physically can’t.
Draco’s up in the sky, not quite flying as much as he is floating in one spot mid-air. Looking down at the ground with a solemn look in his eyes and a cigarette in his hand. Harry can see the smoke when he takes a breath.
The small sparrow that makes up his patronus is something he’ll have to think about in private. Why such a small, defenseless little bird? Such a delicate being that relies on wings to move?
Draco is at his side, face unreadable, tucked up tightly in his winter robes. They share a look, one full of anxiety and unrest, and then they step up towards the magical fence.
It’s only when he settles down beside Harry that Harry realizes how exhausted he is. His eyelids droop helplessly as Malfoy turns to him, holds one thin brittle hand in his.
Harry had been similarly consumed, but only really dreamt of Malfoy during sixth year when he watched him on the map religiously. He knew Draco had been watching him, but not to the same extent Harry had been watching him. Both had been trying to foil the other’s plans, had been wondering what the other was doing, were obsessed with getting to know exactly what the other was planning.
It almost draws a groan from Harry’s chest, because it’s such a deep ache. Possibly, it’s already started to bruise, free blood trapped beneath his skin.
Harry sniffles, wipes the tears off of his face, and sighs. Mr. Weasley is the next to squeeze what little life he has left out of him. Then Headmistress McGonagall tears him a new arsehole for running off and worrying everyone.
Harry presses his cheek into the pillow, hand still clutched in Draco’s, and shuts his eyes. The relief of the action is immeasurable. A few moments later, when he’s almost asleep, he feels Draco’s lips on his forehead.
The taste is delicious. Sharp and fragrant, almost like a Granny Smith, but bright yellow in colour. He takes another bite.
The Ministry have finally done it. They’ve finally gotten Harry Potter the way they’ve wanted him all along:
Harry’s been so busy, so anxious, so worried, that he hadn’t thought about food. That happens to him a lot now, being too sick with life to eat, but today his stomach is cramping in hunger, so he knows something has changed.
Harry kisses down over his pajamas, down over the seams until he’s level with Draco’s dick. He takes a moment to look up at Draco, to make sure he’s okay, and he’s watching Harry back. He nods his head and Harry forges on.
. It sounds like Narcissa’s playing the piano, like a sad song with pain in its notes. It emanates from the house and lends a spooky, forlorn quality to the entire property. It makes the hair on the back of Harry’s neck stand up.
He feels better today. Not perfect by any means, still haunted by death and the past, but okay for the moment.
Harry grabs his forearms, starting to get scared himself, as the trees seem to open up. A creature steps through.
“I want everyone to know that I’m not a girl!” She cheers, looking perhaps a bit nervous. “Or, well, I guess I never was one. Call me Sterling, alright? My entire family already does!”
A huge, looming figure that crushes the ground beneath its hooves. Like a moose, but with antlers as gnarled and crisscrossed as tree branches.
Only when he’s standing on the precipice does he remember McGonagall’s words from the night prior. Forbidden from leaving the castle.
She steps toward Harry, a woman as beautiful as the passage of time itself, and hugs him to her, warm and inviting and somehow loving. Her embrace feels a lot like Mrs. Weasley’s, though she smells like sharp daisies and sparkling cider. She whispers into his ear as they hug for a long moment.
Harry could have a million years to prepare and he’d still never willingly step foot into the forest again.
When he’s finished, he heads back to his room where Draco still sleeps, curled up in the blankets like he’d be content to never leave. Harry presses a kiss into the crook of his neck, the jut of his shoulder blade, the arch of his nose, everywhere he can reach until Draco stirs.
Afterward, the air is lighter. The mail arrives and, with it, comes a small envelope held in the foot of a spotted black owl. It lands in front of him, sealed with purple wax and a stamp of a book. When he opens it, the letter is written in neat, concentric handwriting.
a warming charm, over Harry so he stays nice and toasty for what must be an outside adventure. He turns his wand presses it into Harry’s hand so Harry can do one for him.
It helps calm the fire raging in Harry’s chest and brings his body temp down to normal, at least. He feels better, for the most part, and is a little embarrassed about his behaviour.
Finally, Draco pulls the bag shut and they run in the opposite direction of the leucrotta, stumbling into the darkness regardless of any other dangers that are surely lurking behind the trees. They send birds scattering, scare weird salamander/snake hybrids up trees, cut off packs of small, golden yellow squirrels with five eyes on each side of their faces, but they don’t stop to look or admire or anything.
Harry thinks about it for only a second before he lifts his knee to settle down beside Draco, too exhausted to consider the implications. He draws the blanket up to his chin and looks up at the ceiling, feeling relief and pain like two crossed waves crashing up against one another.
“I’m gonna leave for Malfoy’s now, okay? Tell Mr. and Mrs. Weasley I miss them. Tell Ginny and...and George Happy Christmas, alright? I’ll see you in the new year.”
A day back from the Winter holiday and The Prophet publishes an article about the supposed reemergence of the death eaters and cites the new Malfoy mansion as their newest local hangout. Ridiculous.
“Good luck,” says the headmistress, “and please remember that we are all watching in case you need help. Red sparks for emergencies.”
Draco manages to hunt down some cigarettes in a shop in Muggle London and spends the early morning hours smoking them from the roof of his new home, of the one untainted by blood and tears and death. He listens to upbeat Britney Spears songs and watches the sky light up.
Harry brushes it off as nonsense, isn’t worried about it at all, because he’s just spent two bloody weeks at new Malfoy Manor and seen nothing worrying at all. He outwardly expresses this to anyone who will listen, because the Malfoys are changing, becoming better, and he doesn't like that their progress is being disregarded entirely based on tactless articles and nonsense writings.
Instead of fly larvae, though, mist flows out. Indistinct and almost nonexistent. He tries again. Nothing.
Harry turns towards Draco to ask and is shocked to see him rocking back and forth with his hands covering his ears. He’s mumbling to himself, eyes slammed shut, as he rocks almost in tune with the words of the song, tears streaming down his face.
“Also…” Harry turns around suddenly to dig rapidly through his trunk until he comes up with a thin, wooden stick. “Here.”
“So, you will be assigned your own special eighth year dormitory that will be mixed-House. Hate speech and bullying will not be tolerated and any evidence of bullying will lead to immediate suspension. There are wardings in place to inhibit violence against one another. I will not have a divided student body again.”
Harry looks over at his friends, at his fellow eighth years, and he grins, despite himself. He hasn’t been drunk off firewhiskey in a little while and wants to feel the rush and fire of it once again. Who fucking cares what tomorrow or this weekend will bring? Harry needs to forget everything and be free. Fuck it all.
Draco leads Harry through the winding hallways of his newest home to the kitchen where they gorge on decorated gingerbread men and hot tea. They laugh when the Malfoy’s newest house guest enters to check on the ruckus, thinking they’re being burgled, but it’s just them. Patches, who gets paid for tidying, just looks at them, amusement in his eyes and a smile on his face, as he Disapparates right there with a
“I love to sit up here in the Summer,” he says softly, panting a little. “When it’s warm and dark and it smells like rain.”
A destroyed 19-year old boy, worn down by the demons of his past, only skin and bones. Harry must look the same, because he is the same. At least inside.
“Potter?” Harry nods his head, practically weeping. “Now I’m just Potter? After we slept in the same bed for months? After I held you and you held me while nightmares tore at us every night? After all the
She holds him closely in her arms and weeps over him like he’s dead already. Like he died up on the tower and she only has his lifeless body to grasp at. He has tears in his eyes, too, and is so overcome with emotion that he clings back to her, full on sobbing with madness and anxiety.
Somehow, though, he ends up there anyway, pulling his trunk through Platform 9¾, with Ron at his side. He’s not sure how it’s going to affect either of them, seeing spots where their friends and family died, but he’s going to try and deal with it.
Draco shakes his head, determined as Harry was, and then he takes Harry’s entire dick into his mouth. Or as much as he can fit. The heat and the pressure is so much it’s enough, finally. Harry is literally going to die.
He says his name like a whip, aching and hard and painful. Like a gift he’s thrust back in Harry’s face, like saliva he’d spit onto Harry’s skin.
Hermione begins to share his worry as they read about lethifolds that hunt you in your sleep and runespoors with venomous fangs and incredible intelligence. They look for ways to fight off these creatures and come up almost completely empty handed.
The thought of signing his name for fame, of posing for photographs, after all those people fucking died makes him literally, physically ill, so he just pretends he can’t hear them as they shout after him and beg for his attention. Feels faint as he pushes past the disposable Muggle cameras and the quills in his face to find Hermione in her own car with Neville and Luna.
He has nothing to say for himself after her scolding, so he hangs his head a little low, shoulders hunched, bleeding shame from every pore.
Ron and Hermione are sitting across from him in the library, arguing about the ability of the Ministry to include XXXXX rated creatures into the forests. Ron thinks it’d be “sick” to see a wampus cat or a manticore and Hermione thinks that they would never put anything more dangerous than an XXXX in the forest. Harry is, at the moment, inclined to agree with Hermione on this, but it
Draco will be the saviour this time. He'll finally do some good to start evening out the evil he's done in his short existence. In just 19 years, he's done so much bad, but making up for it begins here. Begins with saving the saviour's life.
Harry stands guard, wand in hand, prepared to do anything to protect them, but nothing comes. Nothing but the eerie sounds of rain falling in the forest around them. He can hear creatures roaming the woods, too, but they’re far off.
And so Draco does. The leaves begin to change colour, drying up slightly until their colours are muted. Then he pulls out pieces of old parchment that he also casts a few spells on until its consistency changes, too.
keeps their body heat in, but Harry’s still anxiety-sweating. He really needs a fucking drink or something. God.
Harry goes willingly, pliant in the face of the truth, as his mind breaks like his body has. As he drowns in his own violent waves.
Then Pigwidgeon is flying in at full speed, a letter clutched in his tiny feet. He pirouettes and lands elegantly on Hermione’s wrist, dropping the letter in her lap.
So he just kisses him with all the feelings he doesn’t have words for. Kisses him and holds his hips with his hands, fingers just sort of lingering underneath his shirt. Draco’s mouth is unrelenting and hot and Harry’s just so in love with him that it physically hurts.
“I was getting hazed by the other kids, because we’re friends, you know. I could take it. It’s not a big deal that they think I’m a traitor or a twat or whatever, because their opinions don’t matter to me...but...but...”
“I don’t know what to do without him here. I feel like...like I’m suffering through life for no good reason and he was one of the few things that helped lessen the pain...and now he’s gone and I’m still here and he doesn’t want to be friends anymore and I’m falling apart.”
After what feels like forever, but is probably a kilometre or so, they slow. Harry pulls out his wand to cast the mapping spell and finds they’ve gone in a diagonal to the way they had planned, running deeper into the forest than they needed to.
Harry looks out over the Scottish countryside and sighs gently, not noticing the emptiness in his chest for the first time in a long, long time. Maybe it has something to do with the place or the weed or the boy sitting right beside him, but either way, he feels content. Less like he's still at war.
Draco looks so beautiful that Harry leans in just enough to show that if he’s okay with it, so is Harry. Harry’s the one who has been drinking, albeit not much, but the choice is up to Draco. He’s the one most affected by the stigma, the rumours of treachery and backstabbing.
He’s not sure how long it takes, how long he sits there, rocking and crying to himself, but the noise quiets. He feels arms on his shoulders, holding him in place. Hears something other than the screaming of hateful words.
Harry gets a little more drunk than he should’ve, circumstances being what they are. He’s not concerned, because he’s drunk at the moment, but surely he will be tomorrow. Instead, he’s flying high and dancing with anyone who will dance with him. Particularly Draco, but he does dance for a bit with Ron after Draco heads up to bed until Harry ruins everything.
Harry’s surprised, but happy about it. He hasn’t kissed Draco since the holidays and he’d missed the warmth it brought to his chest, mised the fire singing in his veins, the burn of Draco’s skin against his. Harry kisses him back, one hand pressed to the pillow to the right of his body to hold himself up, one knee balancing him by Draco’s thigh.
“You built your bed. Now you have to sleep in it,” she says with flourish and some level of smugness.
Once inside, with the tapestry pulled back into its place, he whispers, “Mischief managed,” and the map goes blank. A haunted piece of plain paper. He folds it back up and tucks it into his pocket as he walks through the tunnel and out toward the pitch.
Harry may be mistaken, but he thinks he sees her smirking slightly as she turns the corner to push through the portrait door. Maybe she’s happy Draco has returned or perhaps she knows Harry’s been up to his shenanigans again and is happy about it. Either way, he gets away with it.
He curls around himself, arms to his chest, and he shakes with waves of tears like a tsunami destroying anything in its path. Like a hurricane bashing a coast to pieces. A tornado tearing shit up and dropping it thousands of kilometres away.
Sobs wrack his chest and he crumples down, holding Harry’s body to his chest. The boy who lived has died.
The branches dangle a foot or so overhead and it’s easy to see where Draco made haste picking off the fruit, so Harry holds up one and places it back against the branch. With his other hand, he casts
He’s nervous this conversation isn’t going to go over well. Worries Draco will yell or scream or even leave Harry where he stands.
Harry sits beside Hermione, who he refuses to even look at, and Draco, who he can’t stop looking at, and sips on a cup of hot chocolate. He hasn’t had any in such a long time that it fills his chest and his stomach with warmth and memory and alleviates the slight headache he’s got. He sighs, feeling content and upset, as Neville massages his forehead across from him.
He can’t bear to see the fucking clock or the look on George’s face or the pain in Ginny’s eyes or the empty fucking chair at the dining room table! Harry is not okay and this will only make it worse!
Draco kisses his nipple and relents, drawing down the bed to suck the head of Harry’s cock into his mouth. The pleasure is immediate and all encompassing. Harry’s so in love that he can feel the beat of his heart and the beat of Draco’s—in sync. Draco hollows his cheeks, looking elegant and regal even with a dick in his mouth, and Harry gasps.
He’s probably done this for Harry, too. It’s just Harry makes it a habit to try and forget all of his dreams, whenever he has them, so he doesn’t remember the horrors of his nightmares. He wishes there was a spell for that.
Harry is so glad she’d gotten back to him quickly. He scribbles out a reply with a quill Hermione had tucked into the hair she’d gathered in a bun on the top of her head to send it back with Ullr, the spotted black owl, who waits patiently in the sky above the table.
“Let’s skip magizoology,” Harry whispers into Draco’s ear. “I can’t hear one more thing about a fucking pogrebin.”
Hogwarts used to be a home for the lost, a place of magic and wonder. For Draco and for Harry, it used to mean a family with no repercussions. No payments to be made at their expense. But after the war, it, like the two boys, is not the same.
on the room to silence the music or McGonagall would have surely been back already, so Harry lifts his arms and, already breathless, dances with Draco in the circle of his arms as they sing lyrics into the already loud room.
“Potter?” He whispers and it’s the most heart-breaking feeling not knowing if he’s hoping for something impossible or inevitable. “Is that you?”
Harry sighs and stops listening. A few short weeks and he’ll be all alone, choking on memories and death, surrounded by monsters and creatures, in the Forbidden Forest.
Draco nods and Narcissa changes songs again, to a more upbeat rhythm with words about a bright nosed deer and foggy nights.
Skinny as hell, shadowed in exhaustion. As frail as the skeletons of all their dead classmates buried 10 feet underground.
Draco’s been home for a week and still wakes up searching his bed for Potter with his fingertips in pure desperation for his company. It’s the first thing he does when the snake nightmares of lullabies and death tear through his chest and leave him gasping and choking on the memory of the taste of his own blood. The second thing he does is shut his eyes as hard as he can and ball his hands into fists, knowing there’s nothing to be done. That no matter how he feels he cannot ever be selfish enough to return to Potter’s side.
Hermione apologizes again, pleading her case, but Harry’s already forgiven her. He played as much a part in this as she did, plus she didn’t do the asking anyway. She embraces him and, this time, he has the energy to hug her back. It feels like coming home after a long, difficult day.
Harry lays down in his bed a changed man as Draco runs to brush his teeth. This night has invigorated him and reminded him of why he liked Hogwarts to begin with. It’s an escape from all the shit and the pain and the malignancy of the real world. It was until Voldemort ruined it with his pointless war, that is, but it's with this precise thought that he makes a rash decision.
Harry tries not to think about it, but he can’t help but wonder if Malfoy’s upset to share a common room with dirty blood. Upset at having to settle for a space that is less than pure.
It’s the first moment that Harry realizes he cares deeply about Draco’s well-being. The realization was inevitable, of course, but still hard to swallow. Another person in Harry’s life that he’s destined to fail at protecting. The thought makes him shake with anxiety.
Draco gives him an appraising look, one filled with admiration and endearment and relief, and then says:
He sobs and screams and writhes in the agony as the creature stands above him almost, within a metre, and its face is shadowed in darkness. Its nearness to the fire puts it out, blinding Harry to the creature’s true terrifying mask.
It’s a slight sound, a waver in his facade, and Harry grabs onto it like a lifeline. Draco is not as untouchable as he seems, not as inhuman as his face may seem. Harry can do this.
Either way, Draco grasps him and kisses him without fear of judgment and it’s the best one they’ve ever shared. Hermione pats him on the back and Ron is saying congratulations and the room is in an uproar for the both of them. Together. Two being bound for the future by three days spent in a terrible, godless place and tragedy.
They hike until the sun starts to slip from the sky and the cold really starts to set in. Luckily, the
I came back and everything was different and so was I, you know? So I shut down because I didn’t know how to even begin to deal with the implications of that. I still don’t. But you
He lets the map lead him through the corridors to a secret passageway that he knows leads right out to the pitch. Still, the password rises to the surface as he says it.
Looks like he’s taken his anguish and built himself a better body with it where Harry let his tear him apart.
“‘Right now’,” he whispers, shutting his eyes gently, jaw quivering like he's in a tremendous amount of pain. “Right now, we are both grieving and in pain. Right now, maybe we are similar. But what happens when you’re better? When you aren’t like
“Well, think about passing this test. About coming out of the forest unscathed and once again being the talk of the town.”
It looks down upon them, flying at half or even less than its original size, and Harry has to fight back the urge to run. This is his patronus now, for better or for worse, and he tells it what to do. It means neither him nor Draco no harm, even if the memory of the heat from the
Harry agrees with that. Dumbledore may have done some good things for the Wizarding World, but Harry wishes he hadn’t ignored the separation Houses sometimes lead to. The divide of competition sometimes goes too far.
“I don’t know why you came here,” Draco says softly, like he’s in pain. “I told you not to come for me.”
Draco’s hand touches Harry’s so so so gently and Harry lifts him to his feet. He’s still bleeding from a cut on his forehead and his nose, but Harry takes care of that with the most powerful
“Sorry, but you were being a twat.” And with that, he starts his hike towards the crying tree, towing Draco’s stunned body in the air behind him.
Draco, no matter his fear and pain, has to do the same. The Golden Boy deserves better than dying in the Forbidden Forest after escaping its clutches so many times before.
When they return, it’s clear something has gone awry. Their fire has been stomped out, their belongings strewn about, and their tent is tattered and torn into pieces. Harry himself cannot bear the sight and collapses to his knees on the outskirts as Draco continues on, kicking at the hot coals of their dying fire to put it out so it doesn’t burn the forest to the ground.
He presses the fruit, neon orange and slightly oval in shape, against the branch and thinks about something Professor Sprout said once. He remembers nothing about the tree itself, but of another where she cut off one branch and attached it magically back to a different one. As the days went by, the new tree grew two different types of fruit on its branches. But what was the spell she used?
but he leans against Draco’s arm anyway. Snow starts to fall gently from the sky and Draco wraps an arm around Harry to draw him closer to him.
“I never slept with Voldemort,” Harry says shortly, so tired he misses Draco’s meaning the first time around. “Oh...no, you’re not my enemy. You never really were.”
When the sun rises, Draco’s eyes always water and there’s nothing he can do to stop it, so he just. Cries. As sunlight warms his numb and lonely body, frozen by the still icy winds, feeling nothing and everything all at once. Like a fleck of sand on a beach, alone in his differences, tormented eternally by destructive waves, forever lost among other things.
Draco’s father’s books were probably all Dark, so whatever the apples do, it cannot possibly be good.
Harry nods, flashing a fake smile, and remembers the bravery in her voice when she lied to the face of the world's biggest threat. When she helped him take down Voldemort with a couple of words. And then he goes back to cutting shapes out of his gingerbread dough.
Malfoy lifts an elegant eyebrow and moves forward, up the brand new stairs and down a long corridor. Harry sees doors, but none say their names until the last one on the right.
Harry has a knapsack thrown over his left shoulder full of their allowed supplies from McGonagall. Their potions, some ingredients and herbs, food, two bezoars, spare clothes, and a tent. Measly items for such a long and exhausting weekend.
When Draco manages to open his eyes to see the source of the song and of his paralyzing fear, the fire’s almost gone out. Burnt down to smoulders and ash in the presence of the dark creature. A dementor.
Harry grabs Draco’s hand, winds his fingers with his, and runs up the stairs, tugging him behind. Draco fights the running at first by dragging his feet a little to uphold his dignity in front of the others, but once they’ve turned the corner so no one can see, he bursts into a run, nearly cutting Harry off in his zeal.
“I won’t let anyone near you. I was giving you space, you know, because that’s what I thought you needed. That’s what the books say to do, anyway. Space and time. But I missed you...and...and you need help and that’s what friends are for.”
Life is pure fucking chaos right now and Harry isn’t sure how to fix it. At least he fixed the Draco problem, for the most part.
And so they start their hike. Hand in hand, guiding each other into the webbed darkness, they begin their ascent.
“You slept through it. Poppy checked you over and said you just needed to rest...so we let you rest.”
Harry and his fellow eighth years rise, solemn and together, and take the long walk out to the edge of the grounds where McGonagall waits with her fellow staff members.
Draco lights the fuck up at the song choice and Harry drags him up towards the center of the room when people start to dance. The lights are dimmed and someone must cast a
Something slams into Draco’s quivering form and knocks the wind out of his chest. The song is so loud, even though Draco is sure Potter cast a
“Will we be permitted to retest if we’re removed?” Hermione asks and McGonagall raises her eyebrows.
The students clap loudly for them and the other 8th years cheer, because, despite the odds being against it, they actually survived in there.
He brought his toothbrush and will be fully prepared to kiss Draco once he does manage to brush his teeth. He’ll probably have to use
He packs a bowl at the top of the Old Astronomy Tower and then promptly smokes the entire thing, feeling like he weighs a tonne and nothing at the same time. Then he stands on the edge of the crumbling building and kicks some rocks down. Contemplates what would happen to him if he fell that far.
Harry has no idea what Draco could be doing at half 3 in the morning on a cold January night if he’s supposed to have left.
of innocent people! My friends, my family. I won’t get better, Draco, because this is my life. I’ve used all 3 Unforgivable curses, I cursed you almost to death, my uncle died because I couldn’t control the fucking link I had with Tom fucking Riddle! I have done so much shit that it’s eating me alive and you’re worried about me suddenly overcoming it and writing you off?”
Christmases were days Harry spent locked up in the closet until he was brought out to cook dinner. Afterwards, he’d be forced to return to his room as the Dursleys ate their dinner, left only with the smell of the Christmas ham to eat that night.
Draco finally turns to look at him, dashing and tragic in his beautiful suit, and he looks furious and sad. It’s the same look he’d given Harry before Harry almost murdered him in the bathroom in sixth year, right down to the tears in his eyes, and it breaks Harry’s heart.
“Any other questions?” A pause. “Good. One last thing: you will enter the forest through a one-way entrance. The exit will require you to traverse the woods and come to a predetermined location in the centre of the forest where a Portkey shaped as a unicorn statue will transport you to safety. You should be able to map your way to it with a simple directions spell, which you all should already know. Any further questions will be answered in the morning. Good night, students.”
Harry gives him a hug that he returns, his hands pressing tightly into the small of Harry’s thin back. He can feel the pressure of Draco’s grasp like pain and worries there’ll be a bruise over the bones in his spine.
It’s a smile for only Harry. The kind only he should ever get. Something open and delicate and entirely too intimate for just friends.
Harry eats a piece of toast with an egg in the center and has a whole delicious cup of coffee with a splash of milk. He revels in it, in the warmth and the taste and the satisfaction. He only needs a cigarette now to feel entirely himself once more.
Harry’s jaw drops, his tongue goes numb, his palms start to sweat, he shivers. Back to the forest. Back to green light and Avada Kedavra and Hagrid’s hard sobs. Back to Malfoy’s mother’s blessed lie and Harry's paralyzed back on the cold, wet ground.
you’re getting married without mentioning it at all to me either? Are we even friends at all, Ron? And if we aren't, what was that? All those years? A joke?
“Grieving sounds. But they’re just magic in the tree itself, Harry. It’s not actually missing its fruit.”
Harry’s so hard it hurts, but he has other things to worry about when Draco looks so especially beautiful like this, eyes half-shut, mouth open, chest rising and falling rapidly. God.
a lot, the both of us, together, so don’t get any ideas, alright? We’re sticking this out together.”
“Of course, idiot. Minnie said it was only a boggart, so it couldn’t kill me. It scared me almost to death, though.”
It feels different this time. The pressure of Draco’s mouth isn’t enough, is amazing, but still not enough, because Harry suddenly wants more. Harry kisses him harder, wraps a leg around Draco’s thigh to pull him in close, and feels better.
Draco laughs a little, chuffed, and continues to read the book in front of him. It’s a book on useful muggle plants that might come in handy in the forest. Good thing one of them gives a fuck, because Harry seemingly physically can’t care.
Harry can barely walk. He hasn’t stood in almost a week, has been left to sit and lay on a cold, stone floor, so he’s so dizzy and cramped that his legs barely work. Ron puts one arm over his shoulders and Hemione holds him at his waist.
Harry doesn’t know much about music, so he drops out of the conversation and tries to spot Draco from around the corner. When he does, he’s startled silent.
almost a year ago and then he thinks of the chimeras and fire creatures that rose from the flames to consume them. Harry could have left Draco there to burn, could have run off, but he didn’t. He stayed to help and risked his stupid life to save Draco's ungrateful and worthless arse.
“Voldemort, then.” She is noticeably tense and Neville’s cheeks are pink in leftover fear of a dead man; Luna is too busy reading a small, baby-pink book and doesn’t even look up.
Draco stares at the paper for longer than necessary, trying to make sense of the words. Since the war ended, he’s had trouble reading. He’s not quite sure why, but perhaps it’s his anxiety or maybe he’s going fucking insane, but he has to scan through it for quite some time before the meaning takes hold.
which Harry allows to hit him. He feels it on his skin like bugs and then Draco’s wand flies off towards him. He picks it up and stares at it in his thin, pale hand.
Harry’s relieved to be in a place with no bad memories, though, with nothing causing anxiety to flare up in his chest, and he can see relief on the faces of some of the others, as well.
on the woods, that he can’t think, can't see, can't breathe. All he can hear are the lyrics, twisted so darkly in the Dark Lord’s mouth as he sang, as Nagini curled languidly around his torso and shoulders and down his arm.
They give one another hugs again and then the Weasleys are off, too, leaving just the original trio behind.
Headmistress McGonagall is no different than Professor McGonagall. She’s still tall and smart and one of Harry’s few remaining friends. She leads the Sorting Ceremony with grace and efficiency that Harry’s come to realize she just naturally possesses.
When Harry sees the way the light reflects in Draco’s eyes, he finally identifies the creature, small now in stature, but once so big it filled the room.
“And then never brought it up to the one person who has always been your best friend and hers? Neither of you?” Harry shakes his head, night ruined, disgust colouring his voice. “Whatever. I’m going to bed.”
It adds to his infamy and Harry wants him to have none. Wants him to be forgotten and only remembered as the angry little boy who wanted too much. To be just Tom, an orphan, an angry little boy so terrified of death and his parentage that he did everything to spite them, dying earlier than if he had just lived a normal wizard life.
“Can you speak?” The tree gives no sign other than the constant, unintelligible sobbing. “That’s alright, love. I’m going to try and fix your branches, okay?”
Falling is easier and faster than waiting for death itself, but getting some cigarettes will feel better and quell the shaking of his hands and the cramping of his stomach. Oh, the choices!
“We’ve both done things that should have ended with our deaths, Draco, and the fact that we’re still here means that we’re meant to be, I think.”
When he rinses out his mouth and brushes his teeth, he joins the rest of the 8th years in the common room. He sits on the stairs like he had last time, but he isn’t alone this time. Hermione and Ron sit on the bottom step and Draco’s on the second to last with Pansy. Harry sits down between the two, squeezing in because the third step is too far away to hear, and snorts at Pansy’s protestations.
Draco’s Walkman has been getting used regularly, apparently. Harry hadn’t even given him a Nirvana tape, which means Draco sought it out on his own and liked it enough to look up the lead singer.
“There’s something in the woods,” Harry cries out, in shock of its nature and presence, “something that’s coming for us.”
He thought he’d be a nervous wreck the morning of his exam, shaking and sweating and vomiting, but he’s calm. Irreverent, even, to the importance of this day.
“According to Draco, we didn’t have much choice.” She laughs and it’s the perfect kind of laugh to go with the joke.
“Perhaps we should have a dinner party, then? Draft an invitation and send it back with an owl. Say 7?”
“I deserved that. It was just the first time anyone ever really said no to me, you know? Of course, after that, I wasn’t babied as much by my parents. They, or, well, my father, I mean...He really started to lay into me when I started Hogwarts. Wanted me to be perfect. Act perfect.
Technically, he isn’t leaving, though, right? He isn’t Disapparating or using an exit to make an escape or taking a car. He’s just going down a corridor that leads somewhere else magically. Hopefully, the technicality is enough to keep him out of detention and off of McGonagall's bad side.
Draco must have tucked him away while he went off to look for something...or maybe he was attacked while Harry was out and had to be magically evacuated! Or maybe he’s injured and lying in a ditch while the leucrotta circles him and waits to end his life.
He’s woken up alone and he knows there’s something wrong. How could Draco so easily leave Harry after what they’ve been through together? How could he be so selfish and cowardly to leave only weeks before their graduation test?
“What’s wrong? Everyone’s been going crazy looking for you! You’ve been gone for days and Draco’s gone, too!”
McGonagall had an entire new tower built for Trelawney and everyone else, but decided to keep this as a memorial to her good friend, Albus. It’s supposed to be off limits, because the structure is crumbling and the foundation is cracked and magic is the only thing still keeping it upright, but Harry’s yet to be yelled at for going inside. Probably because they think he’s there to honour Dumbledore’s memory or something.
It’s no wonder they’re still attached, still linked, with all the weird shit they did just to spy on one another. They were invested.
They haven’t eaten since lunch yesterday and neither of them were in good shape to begin with. They have some emergency supplies, but they both agree they should save those in case of emergency. So they start their exhausted walk.
“Can I see that when you’re done, Susan?” Asks Ron with patience, who sits two seats up with Hermione at his side.
When Harry goes to smoke on the Astronomy Tower balcony with his legs dangling over the edge into oblivion, Draco comes, too. They just sit there beside one another, two skeletons on the edge of death, remembering all the horrible things they did just to make it this far.
“Hello, students,” McGonagall says, looking regal and perhaps a bit proud. “I’m glad you’ve all stuck it out and made it this far. Tomorrow begins the first weekend of testing. Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, I assume you’re both fully prepared.”
Well, he supposes, friend is not the word he would use to describe him. His cousin, Dudley, knows this guy who sells alright weed for a good price, so he buys some and Disapparates as soon as the kid’s back is turned. Dudley watches him with wide, fearful eyes as he disappears and the sight brings some satisfaction to Harry’s life, if only for a second.
“This year,” the Headmistress starts to say, “will be a little bit different. I was...The rules were predetermined by some of the specialists at the Ministry of Magic. I had some input, but they considered all the facts and made their own conclusions on what might be best for you as a whole.”
When he does, he does so wandlessly. Harry doesn’t know if he didn’t bring one with him or if he got a new one, but he has yet to see it.
Harry does know, has seen it firsthand, but he doesn’t care. Draco is still just a boy, just barely 19. He had been even younger when he was forced to make a decision that would impact his life forever, so in Harry’s opinion, he's not at fault for making an impossible choice. How could he ever pick running away over his parents, over the only life he ever knew?
The day Draco sees a small, feathery owl fly into the manor, he slips off of the roof and almost drops his Walkman to its death. He hangs onto the edge and contemplates if it really matters if he falls or not. Perhaps to his mother it would, but she would recover. She’d get over the betrayal of his suicide or accident or whatever it would be labelled as as she has the betrayal from her husband.
Everyone he loves that is dead died because of him. Remus and Sirius and Tonks and Fred and Colin and Harry’s mum and dad. They all died because of him, because he was the saviour of the wizarding world.
When Harry escapes this hellish forest, he plans on writing a long letter to Newt Scammander advising him to look into the lives of plangentine trees and see if they are really trees or actual beings.
“Because I’m seeing the same healer and she’s helped me. Brewed me a potion I take once a week to combat the nightmares I was having.”
Draco’s hand is just sitting on the table beside Harry’s, empty and alone, and frankly it’s a little offensive. So Harry does what any logical person would do and reaches out his to thread his fingers with Draco’s.
Hermione tucks him into bed and leaves, making him promise to talk to her after he rests. He doesn’t sleep, though, because he’s afraid of the new nightmares that will haunt his dreams. Instead, he watches the stars sparkle and waits for Draco.
Harry laughs a little when Pig ruffles through his hair—now long beyond the point of shaggy—and hoots from the new perch. It’s the first time Harry's felt any lightness at all in his chest.
Harry can’t wait to sit in a hot bath and then lay in his bed with Draco’s body pressed up against his own. He can’t wait for something to drink that isn’t water, for something to smoke that isn’t hotsy.
Harry's heard those rumours, of course, but what use is listening to hogwash when he’ll find out the truth soon enough? So he pushes on and tries to find them a semi-empty car.
Harry’s brow furrows; he shrugs his shoulders. “The ones who were picking on you? They’ll say nothing and if they do, who cares? Fuck them. Their opinions don’t matter...and neither does their hatred.”
“Let’s get baking, then,” Draco says suddenly. “Mother’ll have a fit if we don’t get these done before bedtime.”
They keep walking until it’s beyond good sense, because the forest is pitch black. Harry can see nothing outside of the sphere of light from the
The guest room is the most beautiful room Harry has ever slept in. It’s decorated lavishly and expensively and is somehow also functional.
He’s gasping so hard he’s wondering how Draco hasn’t turned up to press a hand calmly against his back. Wondering where he’s disappeared to in the middle of the night, since Harry’s bed is empty and Draco’s is still made. When he gets up and puts on his glasses, he notices a note on the foot of his bed. Stuck there with magic so it wouldn’t get kicked off from Harry’s thrashing.
He overhears Hermione telling Luna about how she and Ron flew all the way to Australia to remind her parents of who she is and he wonders when she did this. Why hadn’t she told Harry?
“So much studying.” Ron sounds exhausted, in a healthy way. “We study all day and all night. Ugh. Can’t wait to get this shit over with. Anyways, come on.”
Draco’s of the same mind, so if anything strange does show up in the forest, they’re both fucked. To soothe any worry, though, Harry does at least read up on uncommon, but not too dangerous creatures (XXX) in case they’ve decided to surprise them. The others are mostly certain the Ministry wouldn’t truly endanger their lives by putting anything more dangerous than a griffin in the forest, but Harry isn’t of the same mind.
“Today we’re here to finish something you all started almost a decade ago. Something you put so much time and effort into that you didn’t even let a war stop you from completing it. It’s quite incredible to witness your final moments and I want to say how proud I am of all of you for making it this far. I know this is going to be very difficult, that you may struggle with it, but just know you’ve all done harder things. I have faith that you will all come through this with passing marks.”
“I don’t know. I was fine until we crossed that border...and then I started to feel really uneasy. Sickly, almost.”
Harry’s come to realize that most expensive things aren’t useful or don’t work properly, so he expects the bed to be hard and unforgiving, but it’s nice. Soft. He still doesn’t sleep, though.
Draco leads Harry through the corridors of new Malfoy Manor as Narcissa talks with Hermione and Ron. Draco doesn’t pause to make sure he’s following or to see if he’s wandered off, because he knows Harry knows this place. He spent two weeks here with them and knows a lot more about them than they do about Harry.
Harry senses the meeting is over, so when everyone’s looking away at McGonagall’s tense face, he slips on his invisibility cloak and disappears, unable to bear one more second of this hell.
Draco says he’ll pitch camp and then take a shower after and sends Harry off to look for food. Harry wonders if showering with an
Ron and Hermione somehow get along with Draco and Narcissa perfectly. They discuss music and S.P.E.W (Patches is himself a free elf, apparently, that Narcissa hired from his newspaper ad and earns money for his time and effort, like Dobby used to) and the possibilities in this new Dark Lord Free World.
Harry rolls his shoulder a little and puts on his brave face as Draco stares at him, a strange contemplative look on his face.
He’s never done this before, any of it, but he has the general idea. He sucks gently on the head of Draco’s cock, tongue working the underside. He can barely breathe, but Draco's needs come first.
razor sharp teeth and claws—woke him up violently, scrambling up from the bed, and immediately forced bile into his throat.
Either way, being back at Hogwarts after two weeks in the sweet refuge of New Malfoy Manor is torture. It’s hell on earth, but Harry’s sticking it out and so should Draco.
“Good job, Pig,” Hermione says affectionately, reaching out to stroke his feathers. “Now go before Crookshanks comes looking.”
There’s a new sound in the distance. It’s almost like a weeping woman, shrieking in loss or grief or pain. Obviously not Draco, but still, who or what could it be? It sounds so haunting it chills him to his bones.
“Welcome,” Narcissa says to Ron and Hermione, who are standing together, looking awkward. “I hope you’re hungry.”
Harry looks down to try and understand that. These plangentine trees cry for their young when they’re taken, weep in grief, are capable of understanding the implications of the fruit’s disappearance. Harry immediately knows he can’t eat those. He won’t.
“No, no. It’s okay.” Harry clenches his jaw and his fists, crumbling the letter up into a ball. “I guess old habits die hard, right?”
Then he bobs his head and Harry dies. He comes in Draco’s mouth, with a handful of Draco’s silver white hair, his mouth open and legs shaking.
It’s true. Harry’s fame and legacy means shit-all to him. He’s never cared much for what others thought of him or what they said about him, unless it was Draco doing the talking and thinking and it’s been that way since they were 11.
In the shadowy light from the moon, Harry watches him. Watches his translucent eyelashes and the shine of his grey eyes. Notices the soft smile on his lips. And can’t help himself, not when Draco’s looking at him like that and there’s nothing and no one to interrupt them.
There’re stars up on the ceiling, real constellations like the ones in the skies, that McGonagall must have charmed up there. He thinks of Sirius and how his namesake came from the stars and how he’s gone like the star is, too. How everything has an end, even things that may be otherwise thought of as infinite. Eternal. Immortal.
The weekend in the forest seems to have softened some of his distaste for Hogwarts while further scarring him emotionally at the same time. He’s grown from the experience, yes, but he makes a mental note to tell Headmistress McGonagall that he doesn’t feel it should be an alternative offered in the following years; It’s just too dangerous for kids who didn’t die once already in a war, you know?
“Yeah. Voldemort.” Draco sounds like he gets what Harry wants without him having to say it. “I think...I think I’m gonna leave.”
The less awesome part is getting naked. Harry’s never really been naked in front of anyone before, not even Ron, and his body’s so damaged now that he grows nervous, but Draco has no reservations. He strips casually and his back is so thin and boney that Harry nearly gasps. He could count every rib and vertebra beneath his skin if he had the mind to.
Harry pauses to wipe the snot off his nose and looks at her, aching and tired and so endlessly alone.
Harry pulls back to smile and kisses him. It’s a truly brilliant moment and Draco is so happy Harry’s alive.
“You were gonna leave me here? Leave me to go into that forest alone while you sleep in a warm bed at home with your mum?”
The wind blows harshly, but Harry doesn’t care. Just leans in a little further to Draco’s side to huddle for warmth. He wishes for a blanket, but doesn’t mind not having one.
“Any luck-enhancing potions are not allowed and are considered illicit for these—and most other—intents and purposes. That is why you don’t have access to all of the ingredients, Mr. Corner. For any potion deemed necessary by the Ministry, you’ve had the supplies and recipe necessary to brew it in the potions classroom.”
He feels so suddenly out of place, out of this world, that it exhausts him. The song carries on and he feels more forlorn, even homesick. But for which home?
He just hopes maggots don’t come out of the end of his wand to devour him like they did to Raczidian.
He starts to shriek as the being draws nearer and voices fill his ears as the lullaby swells. Voices of the dead and the dying and the suffering scream and beg and plead.
“Let me show you how much you mean to me,” Harry says softly and, at Draco’s nod, he slips back up the bed to kiss down Draco’s chest.
Then he sees a silver band on Hermione’s finger and knows Ron must have asked her to marry her in his post-war, Voldemort-is-dead bliss without even telling Harry about it.
And then he wretches, coating his shoes in sticky gold vomit. The dead leaves on the ground start to smoke, catch flame, and then burn.
“They’re so dark green they’re almost black, and when they open in the middle of summer on cool, dry nights, they release the exact smell of rain after a dry spell. Good for warding and protection spells.”
“Now you will head to your dormitories! Oh, and your Houses will still accrue points based on your actions, so be smart and act appropriately! Your younger housemates will hold you accountable, I’m sure.”
There are four banners of the same size hung up to commemorate where they came from and who they are and how they got here. The pillows on the couches are a mix of tones and shapes.
He meets the Headmistress’ forlorn eyes and knows she fought to avoid this, fought to have them take their NEWTS like they were supposed to. Fought to keep Harry’s body off the hard, damp ground.
Draco has some difficulty with the next part, so Harry helps him roll a few Hotsy joints in the freshly hexed parchment. Then they light one with their wands and smoke it.
He pushes past Harry and stalks through the door, posture perfect, shoulders straight, beautiful as ever. He seems more anxious somehow, though, so Harry frowns at him.
He raises his wand, breath shaking, heart hammering, and says, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
Inside are some spotted pinkish-green leaves that Harry recognizes from that night all that time ago on the Malfoys’ balcony. Alihotsy
After a while, Harry’s patronus returns. Its fiery white glow is easily spotted as it soars through the forest, even through the thick canvas of their tent. If it is returning, that means it didn’t find anything too dangerous.
with a harsh downward flick of his wand. The forest sounds continue, but the singing dulls enough so Harry can think again. The song continues on, though it’s much quieter, it is equally as eerie as before.
“Do you remember that day I asked to be your friend?” Draco says, in the meantime. “When you said no?”
Draco strips down to his underwear and puts on silk pajamas before he gracefully slides into Harry’s bed.
Draco’s an expert with the bathtub, so Harry lets him pick the settings. Something smelling sharp and woodsy that bubbles softly and turns the water a soft blue. Awesome.
Harry pretends to play along like a good boy, because Narcissa is being a great host, but he’s just not there. He can’t be. Not when McGonagall could notice he’s missing at any moment and Draco’s still worried he’ll ruin Harry’s reputation and he’s due to return to the Forbidden Forest where he almost died and he’s freaking the fuck out because his best friends are getting married and neither of them have mentioned it to him in the slightest.
Draco sits upright, gripping his sleeping bag to his chest like a damsel in distress. “Absolutely not!”
“I get kicked out of school and sent to Azkaban for attacking the twat who saved my life, that’s what.”
Harry and Draco decide it’s better to get no sleep and get the hell out of the forest than it is to spend one minute longer than they have to inside it, so they prepare for a long hike.
McGonagall sighs a little, deflates. Loses a bit of the pride that was shown so plainly on her face.
Draco lowers his eyes and stares at his plate for the rest of the meal, not even looking up when Harry places a hand on his knee. It’s then that Harry starts to worry.
“I just...I didn’t want to not see Fred there, you know?” He avoids the sad look she gives him by pressing a cutter into the dough forcefully. “Didn’t want to sit next to the empty chair that was always his.”
Draco grins up at him, cheekbones sharp and angled in the dim light, and leans down to kiss him hard enough that Harry gasps, grasping onto his robes to maintain closeness.
“That’s disgusting,” Draco says and there’s anger in his eyes. “How could they do that to a kid? An innocent baby who they chose to bring into their home?”
Thanks for reading and all that. Epilogue is being edited as we speak, so expect it within 24-48 hours!
Harry hadn’t planned on returning to repeat his seventh year at Hogwarts, on coming back to those hallways of horror, reliving the moments of his friends’ deaths, feeling the ache of fear, the bite of panic.
After dinner, when he’s doing his typical wandering, he’s suddenly surrounded by a crowd. They’re all students, all younger than he is, but they look giant. Intimidating. His breath catches in his throat when he realizes there’s no escape; he’s trapped by these nameless 6th years.
Draco settles down a little, but his eyebrows are still furrowed and his hands still clutch at his sheets with white knuckles. He’s panting and sweating and confused and afraid.
“I will be around to assist you, as will the other professors, in preparing you for your weekend, but your Head of House, so to speak, will be Professor Trelawney. More rules will be published as the ministry decides on them, so please await further instructions. Now, as for your partners, the list goes as follows…”
“I gave my life to that war,” Harry says strongly, “and I asked for nothing in return. I did it all without pausing, without a second thought, and I’d do it again, but Draco wasn’t given that choice, not until now, and he’s decided that he’s with us. Anything you do to him, you do to me. He’s under my protection now.”
Generally, mind healers are incompetent and overworked and underpaid by the Ministry. They’re so unimportant and forgotten that they don’t even have a proper name. A proper title or place in wizarding society or even at St. Mungos. They’re pointless.
Harry doesn’t know what haunts Draco, not exactly, but he imagines there’s at least one familiar character in both of their nightmares. And his name isn’t Severus Snape.
Apparently, though, he isn’t too tired to get hard, which is weird after so long. He’d begun to think his dick would never work, so to feel it like that again is bizarre to say the least.
Together, they climb down the rickety steps of the decrepit Astronomy tower and back into the castle.
McGonagall practically grabs him by his shirt collar to stop his escape. Perhaps she even uses magic, because Harry’s dragged back a bit. Turns to look at her, wondering if she’ll be mad and what punishments she’ll assign him.
Harry digs in the bag and removes the half dozen fruits. At the sight or perhaps the sense, the tree’s wailing increases tenfold. Harry has to remind himself why he’s there because the cry is so all consuming he can’t think.
Ron shows up eventually and Harry realizes Hermione had sent her Patronus to tell him where they were. The little glowing otter, still unchanged after all she has seen, after all she has been through.
He feels like a little boy again, like the first time Dudley threw his dead parents in his face. Like he’s lost everything all over again all for the gain of a stupid, spoilt little boy.
“Oh, dear,” Narcissa says softly, thoughtfully, like the earth isn't crumbling to pieces beneath Draco’s feet. “Who else?”
The kid’s face pales. Harry notices they’ve gathered quite the crowd, but he’s glad for it today. At least the news will get out that Draco’s off limits. That he’s finally chosen correctly.
Draco sits up, disoriented but so fucking relieved. He throws his arms around Potter recklessly, toppling them both over, and squeezes him as tightly as he can. He's out of breath immediately, but can't be concerned with that.
By the time Pigwidgeon returns, Harry’s gotten tired of sitting around doing nothing. He’s anxious and nervous and his heart is in his fucking throat.
He slowly slips off Draco’s pajamas, leaving him in just his dark blue underpants. He presses his lips against the outline, hard already, and mouths him through the fabric. Draco moans at once, hands squeezing the duvet, and Harry continues, licking his dick until Draco’s pleading for more.
He and Draco share a look before they run for it, hands just brushing the horse’s front leg when they’re finally removed from the forest.
“I’m causing too much trouble for you, Potter,” he says, the old nickname sounding fond and sad. So sad. “But unlike before, I know...I know it has to st-op this time.”
Tomorrow, they’ll start their hike. Well, in a couple hours at the break of dawn, at least. Harry removes his potion from the sack, taking a deep breath.
He’s alone in his bed, fingers clutching the sheets in panic, body covered in sweat, throat raw from shouting.
Harry nods his head once and Draco does the same, sharing a look that communicates how unready they truly are.
He tries his best to sound calm, to sound gentle, but it isn’t easy when he’s panicking like this. When he’s standing over someone who used to be his nemesis but is now the exact type of person Harry was born to protect.
Susan doesn’t seem to even realize that the headline is right in Draco’s face, but Hermione does the honours this time. She takes it gently from Susan’s hands and burns it to ash in the air behind their table so the ash doesn’t ruin anyone’s meal. She meets Harry’s eyes and he knows he has to stop avoiding them. Has to stop running away. But how?
Eventually, he begins to wish he’d never come, never left that shitty muggle hotel room in London, because more people than he can count start to jeer at him. Clap for him. Ask for autographs. Take photographs of him. Try to touch the “saviour of the wizarding world” without even asking his permission.
Studying. Harry pauses for only a second more to stare at the thin, silver band on Hermione’s ring finger before he books it out the door and into the hallway. The door, no longer the portrait of the fat lady in the pink dress, opens quietly and shuts soundlessly. The new portrait, a woman with eyes like a lion and a dress made from striped animal fur, looks around after the door shuts and scowls. Says something in a language Harry doesn’t speak that is probably an insult.
By the time dinner rolls around, Harry’s had enough of people jeering at him. It starts out quietly, has probably been brewing since the onslaught of the articles, and comes to head, so to speak. He notices it first when he returns to the halls after leaving Draco. The stares are more intense than usual, more focused. There’s mistrust in their eyes, hate and fear. It’s so out of place that, as the looks grow more intense throughout the day, he gets more and more uncomfortable. More uneasy on his feet.
The map is inaccurate now, what with the new additions to Hogwarts during its reconstruction. Someone will have to fix the map to honour the memory of those who put in so much work to create it. Maybe one day he will. Maybe his children will. Maybe it will rot into nothingness in a trunk like Harry had planned for it to.
He cries out at the sight of a black silhouette standing over Harry, skeleton hands outstretched towards him, as Harry screams for Draco to run with his final breath of air. The fire burns out and Draco thinks of Crabbe who perished in the
“I know someone who can help you. Wanting to die like that...it’s not normal. Feeling so sick with guilt for simply living is not healthy. You have to work to fix your brain, Harry, just like you would a collapsed lung or a ruptured appendix.”
Harry embraces him, squeezing him so tightly it hurts his weak and aching muscles. Draco doesn’t hold him back for a long moment, arms tight to his sides, but he doesn’t push Harry away either.
“Your hair’s getting long,” Draco says with soft eyes. “It’s never been this long before. You look like a brunette Kurt Cobain.”
Harry clutches her arms and shakes like a leaf. He feels raw, like the crowd tore off his skin and stripped him bare for all to see. Saw all the bad things he did to make it this far, all the people he hurt, all the people he killed. Left him bleeding and aching like an open wound.
Draco gasps, shooting backwards across the ground in shock, and stares wide-eyed at a creature made of white rippling light like the flames in a fire.
“Can I take off yours, too?” He asks and the innocence and the mischief in his eyes shouldn’t be so fucking hot, but it is.
his voice shakes, like he’s already crying. “You think you’re protecting me from something I don’t give a
That night when Harry’s pressed up against Draco’s side in his bed, he turns to look at him. His eyes are open and he’s staring up at the stars on the ceiling, tears trailing down the sides of his cheeks silently. His chest is rising and falling rapidly, but he makes no sound, gives no sign of his distress.
Ron ends up with Michael Corner, Hermione with Susan Bones, and Harry? He ends up with Draco Malfoy.
Harry turns to his friends who are looking around the room in various emotional states. No one looks quite as upset, though, as Malfoy, whose skin is pinched in between his eyebrows and around his mouth.
“Hi,” he whispers and his entire face is lit perfectly by the moonlight creeping in from the window beside their bed.
“I know now that we were wrong to do that, but you blocked everyone out, mate. You didn’t want to hang out with us. You didn’t want to talk to us. You just wanted to be alone or be with Draco. Wanted to smoke cigs and starve yourself and spend entire nights on the Astronomy Tower contemplating your existence. We watched you decay, watch you turn into this fuckin’ shell of a man, and we didn’t know how to save you from destroying yourself. We still don’t. I’m sorry we didn’t tell you, mate, but we just didn’t think you could handle it. It would’ve been just another thing for you to stress over.”
He groans and, without thinking, lifts his other leg over Draco’s thighs to straddle him. He’s never done this before, not with Ginny or anyone else, but it feels right and Draco doesn’t stop, continues kissing him as his hands hold Harry around his hips.
“Me neither,” George says softly, at his mum’s side, hand on Harry's shoulder. “I’m not sure anyone is.”
Draco’s as quiet as a church mouse most of the time now, so Harry doesn’t have to worry about fights or angry words or his stupid entitlement. He doesn’t really talk to anyone besides Pansy and he, too, is looking worse for wear.
