“If you want to.” Draco kisses his mouth—slow and gentle, deep and hungry. “If you’re sure and I’m sure—why wait? Unless you want your friends there.”
“When I saw that picture in the paper and remembered that you couldn’t even bring yourself to make love to me anymore, I knew I had lost the most important person in my life. I became a man with nothing to lose.” His voice cracked at the end.
This romantic getaway to Rome was a testament to how much Draco knew Blaise wholly and completely. The cradle of Catholicism, a harkening to his Italian roots. He was thrilled
“Whether I do or don’t is not your concern. As I’ve said before, it’s no longer your right to ask. Those are my terms. Take it or leave it.”
“You certainly will be. Ten lashes to get you nice and warm, pet,” his smooth commanding drawl causes Harry to squirt on the floor.
He held Blaise’s ass cheeks apart and thrust his cock deep inside Blaise’s tight hole. Blaise immediately stopped wriggling and groaned at the intrusion.
Draco wakes up in a fright after only an hour of sleep to a cold, empty bed. It's morning. He searches everywhere in the house for Harry, but he’s gone without so much as a note. It’s the weekend and the wives have the kids so the plan was for Harry to stay at Malfoy Manor. Worry overtakes him as he commences his morning shower.
“Auror Malfoy, as you know, it is technically against the DMLE’s policy to be involved with a superior without the ministry’s consent.”
Draco rose up, having finished his breakfast, and winked. "Why don't you try to find out?" he smirked and his hand brushing over Harry's shoulder was fleeting, almost not tangible at all.
"No, apparently they have a hard time forgetting I allowed Death Eaters into the school, imagine that," Malfoy drawled, stabbing his fork through his fish.
"Sounds like someone else I know," Harry said teasingly, relaxing when Draco clucked his tongue and gently smacked his hip.
Author's note: Many, many apologies for taking so damn long with this chapter *winces* It was never my intention to have you all wait so long, but for some reason my writing schedule is even more of a mess this summer break. I'm hoping to finally get a better updating schedule, however, and I hope you can forgive me for having you wait so long for this chapter! If you can't, I fully understand, because these delays have been ridiculous :/ I don't know if I even have readers for this left ...
Well, he thought so at least. He would need to do some research on that, maybe even Owl Fleur and see if she was willing to tell him about Veela and their ways of choosing mates. Would that be considered too private? Whatever, if it was, she would just refuse to answer and that would be it.
"Not much my father can do about the fact that you're my mate," Draco answered dryly. "He probably won't be happy about it for a while, but he's not going to try to curse you either, if that's what you're worried about. That wouldn't really end well if my mother got involved and he knows that."
Was he missing something still? He didn't really think so. The meanings sort of added up, one more than the other, and he wanted to get up and tell Draco he had solved the mystery, but something held him back.
"Not to mention that your photo version literally ducked in the bathroom the couple of times you had to have dinner at a restaurant," Draco continued and sat down as well. "Doesn't take a genius then to figure out that high class restaurants aren't your thing."
He reaches between his cheeks and taps the plug’s base. He presses on it and Harry grunts. His muscled legs fall open and Draco waves his wand to activate the plug with his free hand.
Harry was kissing him for all he was worth, alternating between soft bites, licks, and sucks. He moved away from his mouth and treated his neck in the same aggressive manor, sure to leave behind a litter of love bites, but Draco hardly seem to notice. He was lost.
Blaise had to adjust his trousers now, and Draco finally noticed his erection. He cock sprang to full hardness at Draco’s words, and he was trying to hide it. He crossed his legs. He focused on the grandfather clock to his right, as if trying to tell the time.
It took a few thrusts for Draco to enter him fully. When he did, he lay flat on Harry’s body, trying to get in deeper and paused. He scrambled for purchase on his shirt, on his shoulders, but it wasn’t close enough. He finally wrapped an around his neck and placed the other hand on Harry’s ass, to stabilize his position. Harry let out a moan, but shut his mouth, tightly at the first sound. Draco was glad he did because he was going to cum, any second, and Harry’s noises always set him off.
“I can feel it,” Blaise says wistfully. “As if you could get any sexier. Trying to torture us poor sods?” Grabbing his lower waist tightly, he starts kissing his neck from behind. His hand starts inching down, towards Draco’s cock.
“Oh, you like that?” Draco licks the little notch under his rim and tries to stuff his tongue in his hole, knowing full well he loves it. Harry makes a low, hoarse sound like a growl and groan mixed. Then he starts to rock his hips. He’s trying to thrust his swollen dick at his face.
The thought suffuses his face with heat. No longer an individual person with his own needs and desires. His only desire was to please him, and he wanted to spend the rest of his life doing it. He felt Draco’s invisible shackles fix firmly in place with a loud clank, permanent, stronger than any metal could ever be. He holds out his wrists willingly.
this man was going to be the death of him. His ass felt amazing in his hands. The muscle was firm but still moulded to his palms. He could not deny a gift so willingly offered.
He woke Harry up Saturday morning to a rim job that had him spurting in the sheets, then he fucked him lovingly in the shower. Their collective groans echoed against the walls as Draco kissed him throughout, filling him with his seed and a proclamation of love on his lips.
Draco’s heart gave a strong thud and he shook his head ruefully. “It’s so true that it’s the Top who’s the slave.”
Outside the DMLE floor, Draco was often ogled at by ministry employees in the atrium, no doubt wondering what nefarious methods he used to lure the savior away from his wife and into his cold deatheater arms. They barely registered on Draco’s radar, but he supposed he was just too used to a life of secrecy to change his ways.
Draco let out a barking laugh and Harry’s eyes lit up at the sound. It was rarely heard. Draco’s natural disposition was usually gloomy and brooding.
There were tears at the corners of his eyes and he wiped them away. Draco smiled and continued to finger him, putting three fingers inside, amply lubing his hole.
Blaise raised his eyebrows at that and Draco realized his mistake. Being ‘normal’ for them meant having a lot of sex.
Harry locked eyes with him and saw that Draco’s pupils were completely blown to black. Only a thin sliver of silver surrounded the rim. He looked down and noticed his hard cock was leaking pre-cum already. The sight was too much bare and only caused him pain. He looked away as Draco grabbed his wand from the nightstand, cast preparation charms on himself, and promptly sat down on Harry’s cock, engulfing him to the hilt.
A healer says, “We need his pressure up,” then another one takes his arm. “How do you feel, Auror Potter?”
Blaise chuckled openly at this, leaning comfortably against the front of his desk, looking perfect and delectable as always. Draco smiled at him with his eyes shining bright, a side effect of his recent orgasm.
There was something mesmerizing about the innocent creatures wandering around the field, playing with each other or cuddling closely together in order to catch some sleep. Very few were ever lucky enough to witness such a beautiful sight.
It was when he was diving sharply, his hand already outstretched, ready to close around the Snitch, Malfoy gaining on him rapidly, that he noticed it.
"No, he won't die – it will just hurt for a really, really long time," she answered honestly. "We are not some tragic being,
While he and Fleur often chattered when the Weasleys happened to organise a gathering for the whole family, she never talked about her Veela heritage. He didn't think it was really taboo to talk about it, but there had never been any reason to discuss it and so it never came up.
Harry smiled softly. "That's nice. I didn't know she's such a good cook." Honestly he had a bit of trouble merging the image of the stern, blank faced woman he'd met at the Quidditch World Cup with that of a mother teaching her son how to cook.
When he woke up the next morning, ready to tackle a fresh week of classes, a single pure red carnation greeted him on his nightstand.
It didn't matter. There was no longer a war pitting them against each other, no longer a Dark Lord that Malfoy could be trying to please. They were colleagues and Malfoy was at least doing his best to be civil enough during the times they saw each other.
"I know, but we've been kind of hoping that you would show us some tricks," Wright grinned crookedly. "You're still the youngest Seeker Hogwarts ever had and you led Gryffindor to victory in your last year! We want to win the trophy again this year, so could you show us some of your moves? Elisa is a great Seeker, but you're still better."
"I know. I was just wondering … He told me that only mates can see a Veela's wings. Is that true?" He still had a bit of a hard time believing that nobody could see those giant wings, but then again if they could, why had nobody else remarked on it during that time on the Quidditch Pitch?
"Wait, so you're going to continue with this?" Ron asked horrified, his eyes widening. "Mate, do you even hear yourself? It's Malfoy!"
"Just do your best and you'll be fine," Harry smiled, still feeling uncomfortable with the praise, even now that he was an adult.
The dark haired man spread out his hands. "Well, you said you would finally start explaining things, so I'm here and I'm ready to listen. What's up with your wings, your eyes and your odd behaviour in general?"
"My brother watched every match of yours when he attended here and he said not even professional Quidditch players are as good as you," Wright said excitedly. "So please, professor? You don't have to stay for long, just show us some moves that Elisa can use to win!"
Hermione looked like she was going to stroke her hair back before realising she was in the Floo together with her husband and that move would be awkward at best. "Well, I'm going to assume he went through the entire interview and she didn't find anything wrong with him."
"Right, should have seen that one coming." Harry cleared his throat and rubbed his left cheek, a tad annoyed at how hot his skin felt.
"I saw it and I want to hold it, so I got it," Teddy answered rather blasé, which must mean that he had accidentally used his magic again to get his hand on the stone.
She groaned and flicked her wand at the tea kettle to make the water start boiling. "Yes, yes, I know. Fine, why don't you start at the beginning?"
Draco sighed and rolled his shoulders, staring contemplatively at the empty tea cup Mrs. Malfoy had left behind on the table. His wings twitched faintly, catching the light of the flames in the hearth whenever they moved.
true, yes," she confirmed and her hand briefly appeared to stroke some strands of hair out of her face. "Only our mate
They were adults now, no longer teenagers trying to see how far they could push each other before the other one would break.
She tilted her head to the left. "I suppose," she replied contemplatively. "The sensing does not work with timestamps, '
"So are you a kiss on the first date type of bloke?" Draco asked teasingly; his bravado back now that Harry wasn't rejecting the idea of more dates.
Ron frowned, only showing the barest of flinches still at the name. "I hope you know what you're doing, Harry," he muttered darkly.
"I did some digging in old records," Draco replied lightly as if going through the trouble of looking up the birthdays of Sirius, Remus and Harry's parents had been nothing at all. "How did you know my parents' birthdays?"
"I don't think it can be anything dangerous," she said hesitatingly, worrying her lip between her teeth. "I would assume the headmistress would have noticed something wrong by now if he was some kind of dangerous creature."
"Look, I'm the one who sees him every day," Harry cut in before it could blow up to an actual argument. "And while he still can be a git at times, he has changed. If he does try something, I'm pretty sure I can handle him, though. I doubt he can be any worse than Voldemort."
Obviously Malfoy knew the patrolling schedule as well, so him wanting to meet here made sense if he wanted some privacy. Did Harry want privacy, though? He doubted the meeting would go that sideways, but that would all depend on what exactly Malfoy wanted to talk about.
Harry took a deep breath and released it slowly. "Yeah, we'll try dating," he agreed and then poked his finger into Malfoy's chest, making the other wizard blink. "But if you ever try that enchantment crap on me again, you'll regret it for the rest of your life, am I clear?"
When he was close, he grabbed his wavy locks and thrust up into his mouth to cum down his throat. Harry swallowed every drop like it was water from the everlasting fountain, guaranteed to grant him eternal youth. He moved up to lie next to Draco.
potion, but he was too ashamed to admit it. He did not want Harry to think he had a penis problem. It would be beyond humiliating. This potion was taken by people like Nicholas Flammel, not able bodied thirty-somethings like Draco.
But Harry did know he was there and did it purposely, in anticipation for this moment. Draco hasn’t put him in the collar in well over a week, as this past weekend was spent with the children at Grimmauld Place. Another crack of the whip, this time on his back.
“By the time I’m finished with you, Potter—“ Draco pumps his shaft a few times. “I want to see you’ve cleaned your plate.”
Maybe, he could go back to Astoria, after all. That was his home, where his family lived, and it always provided him with a sense of comfort and security.
Draco was in heaven. All nerve endings were firing in his pleasure center. Blaise rarely did this for Draco, as he was the top and usually prepared him like this, instead.
In a second, he swallowed Harry’s cock to the root, found Harry’s prostate with his finger and pushed it. Hard.
Draco’s penis shot out a clear stream of pre-cum on Harry’s belly. Harry used one hand to swipe his finger through it and licked it clean.
He knocked on Draco’s door and entered. It was plunged in total darkness and he immediately went into a panic, wandlessly lifting the shades.
Harry drops down besides him, his whole body tossed in some transcendental realm. His hands are shaking so much, he can barely get them to reach for him—his soul racked by the most primal terror.
“Harry, stop this. You can make love to me instead. I enjoy being fucked by you, more than you could possibly understand.”
After an hour, Albus still had not come down from Scorpius’ room. Harry did his muggle nanny cam incantation to check on him and realized they were both knocked out cold on Scorpius’ large king bed.
He thrust inside to the hilt, slamming as far into Draco as he possibly could, groaning with blissful relief, when he could go no further. He started moving, immediately, without pausing for him to adjust.
Harry proceeded to tell him about of a pack of werewolves that were hiding out in the mountains. They had learned to transform themselves at will, irregardless of the full moon. These were no Teddy Lupins, but rather, Fenrir Greybacks, on steroids.
Harry chose the restaurant. It had a Michelan star and happened to be in the hotel they were staying in. It was a very posh expensive white table cloth sort of place, right up Draco’s alley. Not at all a place Harry would choose for himself, but he insisted. He said he wanted an excuse to use the muggle credit card that he received from the Ministry when he became Head Auror.
The cafe was brimming with people, the morning crowd, mostly Ministry of Magic employees. All the tables were taken and there was a long line to be seated.
Draco is on the verge of exploding. He could hit him, actually throw a punch at him. He was trying to control him again, force his Dom out by inciting his jealousy. Harry could never be a true submissive, not without the collar anyway. The only thing he knew how to be was an enormous pain in his ass, and he considers telling him as much, but he doesn’t want to make things worse. He decides to come at him in a different way. He intentionally lowers his voice and softens it.
Draco could bring Harry to orgasm in under two minutes if he wanted to. He needed to at least make him think that he had a fighting chance. They’d had experience with cock rings in the past, but Harry was always so sensitive to Draco’s ministrations. It helped, but marginally.
“This extends beyond the bedroom. If we’re going to do this, you must be respectful at all times. You were late coming back for lunch. Do you think looking at that assistant’s ass is a good way to please me? Do you think shamelessly flirting with everyone in the office is a good way to earn my respect?”
Blaise knew not to answer. Draco had ordered him not to speak. This was a test, but he was a good boy, the best submissive. Draco groaned as he squeezed his ass, relishing his silence. His cock was already leaking pre-cum onto his back.
“Harry, we talked about this. That didn’t mean anything, and I’m not going to fuck him again. If I don’t show, Blaise will be upset. I don’t want to give him any more reasons to want to go to the press. I have to keep him happy.”
He heard the rumbling of Harry’s loud motorcycle, announcing his arrival. Draco’s heart started beating out of his chest at the sound, and he was flooded with adrenaline. He felt sixteen again. He willed himself under control, staying seated while Neech let him in and directed him to the parlor.
He pushed Blaise against the wall and attacked his mouth. He felt the left over adrenaline from being on the skateboard surge through his body, and every kiss heightened it.
Draco started running now, to catch up to him. When his hand reached Blaise’s shoulder to pull him back, Blaise shrugged it off harshly, not meeting his eye. He went straight into the floo and vanished.
“I’m glad you enjoyed it, pet,” Draco said, amused. “But now there’s a little matter of my satisfaction.”
The only question he hoped he wouldn’t ask. He always underestimated Harry’s intelligence, to his own detriment. He had forgotten completely about that bloody contract. How could he tell him the truth? He couldn’t. He could lie, but Harry would find out.
“There, there pet,” Harry’s face is soaked with sweat and maybe tears, Draco can’t tell, but he strokes his cheek lovingly. “Tell me what you need.”
The next day, Draco bid Astoria and Scorpius farewell and sat down by the fire to read a book. He had a glass of firewhiskey in his hand, even though it was only 10am, but he needed it. Besides, it’s not as if he was drinking during work hours. He was still in his silk pajama bottoms and robe. It hung open as Draco preferred, letting the heat from the fire caress his naked skin.
Draco smiled and hugged her tightly, for much longer than usual. Her long silky blonde hair tickled his hand. She stepped back after a minute and smiled warmly back at him. He saw Scorpius standing behind her, trying to make himself small as if to remain hidden and didn’t move to greet him. He stepped away instead, looking into the parlor.
Draco took this opportunity to ask how things were going with Pansy, on the sexual side. She was older than Astoria was, when she become a fiancé. There was no way she was still a virgin. Draco used Astoria’s virginity as an excuse not fuck her until the wedding. A lack of sex between Pansy and her future husband must be causing some turbulence.
Suddenly, Harry was right in front of him. He grasped his wrists, pulling them away from his ears and moved them closer to his face so that his hands rested on Harry’s cheeks.
Sitting across from him was a burly handsome bloke with blonde wavy hair, piercing blue eyes, and tanned skin. He was smiling at Blaise with perfectly straight, white teeth. He looked very young.
Draco groaned as he got up to open the door and was surprised to see Harry on the other side. He had a coffee in his hand and wore a wide smile that reached his eyes.
“Please…sir…please,” Harry whispered incoherently. He was so excited he was trembling. The minute he felt those warm hands on his neck in the atrium, this window of opportunity opened and he wasn’t going to let Blaise or anyone else, take it from him.
they were. His buttocks were well-marked with red lines crisscrossing over the muscular globes. Despite that, his eyes were peaceful, almost as if he were on some kind of high.
Harry stared at him with unmitigated anger, but it was the same look he gave him at the manor before he took his leave. There was hurt behind his eyes, but his tone was one of pure loathing.
Draco put his hands on his ears. He could not stand another moment of the gossip and screaming outside his door. If he went home now, however, it would look suspicious, so he stayed put and tried to throw himself in his work.
Then he magic proofs the room, so that even if Blaise were to summon his house elf, Pippy, she wouldn’t come. Blaise won’t be able to cast even the most minor spells, wandlessly.
Draco loved lavishing Astoria with extravagant gifts, and she was certainly not opposed. What he loved most is that Astoria was always genuinely thankful and excited by every gift, no matter how big or small.
He could watch this face contort in ecstasy, this mouth swollen from their kisses, calling out his name, those eyelashes fluttering, forever.
“Wouldn’t you like to know? How’s married life with Pansy? Did she dye her hair blonde enough for you yet?”
“I do want to spend my life with you, Draco. Nothing’s going to change that. Albus has no issues with it, but James and Lilly kick up a fuss. They’ll come 'round eventually. You’ll see.”
“And Blaise stays in my life. If this is going to be casual, you’re no longer allowed to ask about him. No more jealous fits. I can’t handle it. If it ever happens again, I walk.”
Harry grabbed his face and thrust his tongue in his mouth, kissing him soundly, then turned around. He braced himself against the wall and pushed his ass out. Draco’s cock was painfully hard as he looked down, taking in the sweet sight of Harry offering himself so freely. He groaned as he stroked his perfectly toned buttocks before speaking.
He started fucking him hard straight away, without mercy. He needed fuck these ridiculous notions out of his head. He recalled what Blaise said about not being able to get it up because he was pining for Harry.
His cock was tenting his trousers and a large dark spot had already formed. Suddenly, an attractive Moroccan man with large lips stood up from the far chair and approached him. He paid him no notice, even when he knelt in front of him. He just continued to observe the scene up front and sip his drink. The man looked up at him, waiting for permission, but he pretended he was not even there. He bent his head to mouth his large, hard cock through his trousers. Draco drew in a breath but did not stop him right away. The pressure was incredible. When the man went to unbuckle his trousers, he finally put his drink down.
Draco blushed as he pulled his hand away, thinking back to his own engagement to Astoria. He had fucked Blaise within an inch of his life, almost every night, during that time, as he planned to end it after he was married. He would have to heal his hole every day, only to destroy it again, later that same evening. He tried to burn it out of his system with excess, hoping it would be enough to keep him faithful after he became a married man. He knew Blaise had not forgotten about this time in his life. He was looking at Draco expectantly, with pleading eyes.
Draco wants to prove that he can take his mind off today. But he doesn’t want to fuck around. He wants to make him talk before this becomes another problem.
Draco pointed his wand at his ass so it filled with slippery lube. He pushed his own trousers down just enough to free his cock and spelled some lube onto it as well.
Faster and faster Harry drove into him, angling purposely at the place he knew his prostate to be. Draco felt pleasure paralyzing every cell in his body. He was lost in a sea of desire, no longer thinking of anything, only feeling. Little electric shocks made him shake and shiver every time Harry hit his sweet spot. Harry, feeling dangerously close to the edge, already, used one hand to stroke Draco’s cock to completion. It only took ten firm strokes and Draco was shooting his thick load all over his own stomach. Harry moaned at the feeling of those tight inner muscles clenching around him and buried his head in Draco’s armpit as he pounded into him, hard, for another full minute, holding the back of his neck for leverage. He shouted through his own orgasm as it tore out of him and filled Draco to the brim with his cum, pumping in shallow strokes, long after it was over. Finally, he went limp, leaning his whole weight on top Draco, trying to catch his breath. Draco didn’t mind. He could fall asleep with Harry’s cock inside him. That feeling of fullness that Harry gave him, his heavy weight resting on top of him, was the best feeling in the world.
Grabbing his wand quickly from the night stand, he cast a cleaning, lubrication, and stretching charm. It wasn’t as fun as using his fingers, but Draco couldn’t wait. There was a time and place for drawing out pleasure, but this wasn’t it.
“You need to learn respect, Potter. It’s the paddle for you now. As many strokes as pleases me. You won’t be able to sit down today. Is that what you want?”
They sat in silence for a while, just drinking. Harry polished off his glass of scotch like a shot and poured another.
“Good.” He gave him a quick peck and smacked his bum, playfully. Harry startled and smiled, as Draco moved passed him to get to the bathroom.
They woke up later, extremely late for work, and had to shower together. Draco could not resist fucking him one more time against the shower wall, fast and hard. It was a quickie and only took five minutes, as they were pressed for time. It was his seventh time cumming inside Blaise in under twelve hours. He was never taking this potion again.
“Did you have breakfast already? I’m starved and there’s a case I need to discuss with you. Let’s go to the cafe around the corner.”
He thought about it from the beginning. It started with the boxing. He could only imagine the glee Harry felt, finally having a legitimate excuse to punch Draco in the face.
Whatever the facts were, Draco still could not breathe or calm down. His whole face turned red with the effort of breathing.
When they arrive at Harry’s house, and put him up in bed, he falls asleep. Draco goes down to sit on the half-heart couch, as Hermione puts on the fire with her wand.
His rage had boiled over from Blaise’s blasé attitude all night. He didn’t care if he was being crass or offensive. How dare Blaise speak to him, in such a manor? Did he forget who his true master was?
“It hurt so much not to be there, Blaise. You can’t imagine. After seeing that, I decided to put in a request to transfer to the DMLE in Pairs.”
When he returned, Draco opened an expensive looking square box and turned it towards him. Nestled in the inner black velvet was a burgandy leather collar with a steel metal D ring attached. It was flatter in the front so that it would sit nicely under clothes. This was no dog collar. It was a thing of beauty. It glinted dangerously in the candlelight. Harry’s cock stirred, just looking at it. The promises it held.
By the time he had reached the eighth slap, Blaise’s cock was leaking pre-cum on the floor and looked an angry red, fully hard.
He thought of Harry’s pleas to take control of him and imagined all the ways he would do just that, the following night. He imagined splattering his face with cum and Harry licking it off his own chin to taste it, a look of elation on his face like he was savoring the sweetest dessert. He came quickly, after that particular vision, and got out of the shower to get dressed.
“One more word out of you and I’m going to step out of this car and beat your scrawny ass to the ground.”
Draco felt his face heating up, whether it was from the firewhiskey or from his heavy accusatory gaze, he did not know, but he did know he was in dangerous waters.
His stubbornness and refusal to give up his sub status lights a fire in Draco’s loins. He slinks like a cat towards Harry behind his desk and moves his chair out, kneeling before him.
Not bothering to prepare him with his fingers, he lined up his cock with Blaise’s hole and pushed forward half way.
“Hands behind your back, hold your wrists—yes like that. Good. When I ask you to 'display' I’ll want you like this. Feet spread and arms back.”
The past few months revealed a vulnerable side of Harry he’s never seen before. He carries so much pain inside of him. He supposes it’s natural, to worry for the sad hero. It seems unjust that he should carry such a weight inside, after all he’s been through. He thought he would be the one to ease that pain. All that time, Draco never really could…since he’s the one who causes it.
When he arrived, he saw Harry anxiously tapping his wand on the table, before catching sight of him. It kept emitting small sparks, and he almost started a fire on the napkin next to him, without realizing it. Draco rushed forward with a
“Lovely shade pet. So warm. You did so good tonight. You’ve pleased me, and now it’s time for your reward. Lie back on the bed.”
“Malfoy, good morning,” he said brightly without meeting his eyes. He was reading a case file in front of him.
Suddenly, Harry burst through the swarm, ever the conquering hero, and guided Draco by his elbow through the crowd. When questions started being shouted at him, instead, he paused and turned towards the reporters with a fake smile.
Draco didn’t answer. He didn’t have any answers because he didn’t have the faintest clue what was wrong. All he knew, for sure, was that Harry was destroying his life.
“Poor tortured pet.” Draco sympathized. Then he flipped Harry over onto his belly and smacked his ass.
The stories never failed to delight Draco. He laughed and gasped at the appropriate moments. Draco always loved juicy gossip.
Harry magicked the trunk so that it went straight upstairs, into Draco’s room. He turned to Draco to kiss him, and pulled him forward, gripping his bottom. Draco’s heartbeat sky-rocketed in his chest again, instantly, and his sympathetic response kicked in. Fight or flight. He chose flight and pulled away.
Draco’s sense of guilt only increased as he settled into work that day. He saw Harry being hounded with questions everywhere he walked, yet he still kept Draco a secret.
Draco stared into his pleading eyes like his was a loathsome insect. He pulled his arm away harshly, and sat back down.
into work. He knew that he must look like an idiot, but couldn’t be bothered by that. In any case, not many people were there yet. When he passed the auror secretary, he remarked on the beautiful color of her hair. The secretary was shocked and gave him a strange look, but thanked him anyway. Draco usually stomped to his office with tunnel vision.
“Or maybe you’ve used up all your cum on Blaise. Is that what this is really about? I saw you two sitting in the alcove for lunch together, the other day, happy as two peas in a pod. I saw you grab his hand. I know what it means, and for the record, I did not say a word to you about it. I just need to know. Do you wish Blaise was sleeping next to you instead?”
Draco sighed. Blaise would immediately jump to the wrong conclusions about this, having insisted, in the past, that Draco had a crush on the savior, dating back to their boyhood days, a fact that Draco vehemently denied.
Draco woke up the next morning with the worst headache of his life. He felt as if someone had taken an anvil to his head and his skull had cracked down the middle. He shut his eyes tightly and tried to lift his right hand to massage his head for for relief.
Draco panicked. He stopped and rushed towards Scorpius, praying to circe he was unharmed. As he got closer,
"I still love you,” he says angrily. “Yeah, I know that’s pathetic, but I’ve loved you for years, probably since Hogwarts. Believe me, I wish I didn’t. Are you so heartless that you won’t let me have this small thing?”
Draco wanted to leave his house, badly, but he didn’t have anywhere to go. He felt uncomfortable, being there. He felt like he was crawling out of his skin.
Draco let out a girly scream at the pain. He was all for biting, during sex, but Harry had drawn blood. Draco’s threshold for pain was far lower than Harry’s.
“I need you inside...Fuck me hard...Make me feel it.” It's a breathy pleading whisper that shoots straight to his cock. Draco turns to grip his dick firmly, out of Harry's line of vision. He almost just blew again.
Draco was smart enough to know Harry’s power over him is what made the sex so incredible. Visions of their sexual coupling came into his mind, unbidden. Draco had to readjust his cock because he was getting hard again.
he wished he could perish, on the spot. He wanted to sink into the floor. Not only was he revealed as being gay, but his affair with Harry was now public news.
Blaise, who was commanded to be silent, did not respond, but he moaned continuously in loud bursts of pleasure-pain. He was drenched in sweat and clutching the sheets beneath him in tight fists, holding on for dear life. His high pitched girly squeaks that escaped when Draco gave a particularly hard jab were painful to listen to. He lay his head on the mattress with his blind fold on, facing Harry, with a grimace on his face. His legs were spread wide in his cheerleader position and the ropes were beginning to cut into his legs because Draco had tied them too tight when he moved the bar down. Draco only noticed now, the angry red blemish around his thighs and ankles surrounding the ropes where they were tied. He was distracted, however, by the obscenities leaving dream Draco’s mouth. He didn’t remember saying these things.
He followed Harry towards the sea and they began to walk on the coastline towards the very end of the beach where there was large wall of rocks. They jutted out ten feet into the sea.
He left the door slightly ajar but still chained, so that it couldn’t be opened all the way, and turned around to look for the file.
He tried to remember why he had ever tried to stop this thing between them, in the first place. It felt inevitable. He was completely addicted to this new sensation already, planning to never let go.
“For merlin’s sake Draco, contacts. It’s a muggle thing. You’re going to make me late. I don’t question you endlessly when you leave the house, even when it’s to go see your ex-lover.”
Draco was almost hyperventilating at this point, and Harry strode towards him, gripping the front of his shirt in a fist to bring his face close to him, his eyes glittering with rage. He was formidable in his anger. The submissive was gone, and the man who defeated Lord Voldemort stood in his place.
“I just…I don’t know. I know I’m being a prick. I’m sorry. Every time Blaise comes up, I just…lose it. I lash out any way I can. And then that story of you two kissing underwater as boys… Draco, I wanted to die just hearing it, knowing Blaise still has a claim over you, all these years later. And I know I asked for it, so it’s not your fault…It’s just impossible to compete with that. Can’t you see? How am I suppose to compete with those kind of memories? I love you. I think I love you more than anyone’s ever loved a person. I worship you. I kneel for you. I wear the collar with pride. And I feel like you still care about him. Still want him, even. I could tell you miss him sometimes, and it’s torture. I feel like I’m not enough. I feel like that’s why you keep his contract.”
One had to be programmed differently, like Blaise, to enjoy that. He did not understand that a Dominant would gain absolutely no pleasure in punishing someone, simply for the sake of punishing them.
In the center of his desk sat a pensive. Next to it was a vial with a note attached, “For Harry Potter” and a date. Draco did not understand the significance of the date, but he would recognize that writing anywhere. It was Blaise’s handwriting.
Draco opted for weekend wear. He wore fitted grey trousers with a cornflower blue jumper and a grey cloak on top. He enjoyed the opportunity to be out of uniform.
He feels humiliated, caught. If Harry could see him now...Disgusted with himself, he wills his cock down with thoughts of Harry’s heartbreak, and it works.
Harry paused for a few seconds, wondering how he had even come to equate the flicking in and out of view of the wings with the fact that it must mean Draco was upset. He dismissed the thought for now, walking around Draco to sit in his chair again.
Master classes will start for me next week, but I will do my best to keep the delays to an absolute minimum! No matter what this story will get updated - if I didn't lose all my readers at least ^^;
While that thought was amusing on its own, he knew he would get tired pretty quickly if Malfoy just gave in and did whatever Harry wanted him to do. That wasn't how they worked. They pushed and pulled and needled just enough to get underneath each other's skin without ever crossing the line to the point of no return. They had come close several times to crossing that particular line, that was true, but they had always steered away from it just in time.
Draco had chosen to wear a dark blue cloak and his shirt was a deep shade of red, contrasting against his black trousers.
"Of course they will," she said confidently, pushing her bushy hair over her shoulders again. "I've been there before and really, why would they suspect that I'm planning to look up information about a certain family instead of looking up records for my cases?" Her voice was overflowing with innocence, but her brown eyes were positively gleaming and there was a faint smirk curling up her lips.
"Hold on to my shoulders or around my neck," Draco instructed him, beckoning him closer. "If you want to be really sure, you can always wrap your legs around my waist too." His eyes were definitely shining now; a hint of silver around the edges.
For just a brief moment, no longer than three seconds at most, Harry couldn't move as if he was stuck to the floor. Then his entire body started to rebel, every cell screaming in protest, and he lurched backwards, catching his footing just in time before he could trip.
"Well, you can't say he isn't creative," Harry muttered and spread toast on his butter, nodding at McGonagall when she passed by him on her way to her own chair.
Back then he and his friends had agreed on a sign he would give when he really couldn't handle all that political bullshit anymore and one of them would come rescue him then, using some kind of excuse to pull him away from the politician in question.
“Oh my god,” Harry gasps as Draco starts to move over him. He hasn’t done this in so long, he thinks he might die from the pleasure of feeling it again. Watching Draco’s chiseled chest and abs tense as he sits upwards and moves over him with ease, he thrusts up, earning a loud moan.
Harry looked worried, finally, and Draco’s inner Dom was pleased. Harry nodded against the wall. Draco quickly reached up and smacked his exposed face, hard, earning a surprised gasp.
He held Harry close, cuddling him through the aftershocks of his orgasm, smiling when his liquid eyes opened, glittering green, full of wonder.
Draco’s tone was angry. He was upset he hadn’t realized it sooner. Of course, Harry was planning on leaving him eventually, or he didn’t trust him. That’s why he was keeping the children away. He felt a sting to his ego and a matching sting to his eyeballs. He was just about to get up when Harry stood and knelt at his side at the head of the table.
Draco steps towards the bed and pulls off the sheet to slowly reveal Harry’s naked body, still too skinny and frail.
“You’re two timing my sister with a bloke? Have you lost your marbles? Since when are you a shirt-lifer!?”
After a few hours lying awake, Draco got up to give Harry some peaceful time alone. He could tell he was still awake, but he was not talking. He went to sleep in Regulus’ room to give him some privacy.
“I’m sorry. You said Harry wasn’t here this weekend, and I miss you. I can’t sleep at night. I haven’t been able to sleep in months. I thought it would help to have something of yours.”
The light was cascading on Harry’s face, highlighting his wavy black tendrils so that they gleamed blue-black in the sun, his eyes, unobstructed, burning green. He was smiling in that wretched teal polo that was obviously too tight around his massive arms,
Granted, he would still have occasional sex with Draco over those months, but sparingly, and back then, Draco was sure it was only a friendly poke. It had to be.
He ran to the waterfall like a teenager and allowed it to cascade over his head before disappearing behind it. It was like magic. Draco got close to inspect and Harry’s hand shot out to pull him through it to the other side.
Harry walked up behind him to embrace him, clutching his chest and breathing him in. His hand slid lower to his cock which was half hard already. Draco was always in a chronic state of arousal around Harry, especially, now, after staying away for a week.
Before he knew it, jets of white cum splattered the wall in front of him. Harry sighed in relief at the feeling of Draco clenching around him, signifying his end. He finally allowed his own orgasm to tear through him, and came with a loud shout. He must have been trying desperately to hold back. He pressed Draco's whole body directly against the wall, so that his cheek flat against it, as he pumped the last of his cum deep inside him, then went limp, leaning all his weight on Draco.
When he reached the floo in the atrium, he made a last minute decision to floo call Blaise. He decided not to bring up the Harry situation, but he desperately needed a stiff drink.
Harry grinned when he saw him. Draco didn’t smile back. He had to remain in character in front of his son.
Harry’s a stallion. Draco punishes him all night, and Harry works all day, somehow successfully managing eighty people in his command, ending each night with a rigorous workout at the gym. He’s ready every time he arrives at Malfoy Manor in the evening, often awake when Draco falls asleep.
He lifts his head, his glazed eyes reaching for Draco’s. He presses his lips together, bringing both of his dimples out. “I love you.”
After ten seconds, Harry starts profusely sweating. Weasley notices and Harry practically jumps out of his chair, excusing himself to the bathroom. Draco waits to be sure he’s there and then kicks up the vibration to full intensity for a full minute.
It’s possible he just wants privacy to fuck Ms. Assistant, but Harry never closes his floo. It’s ministry policy that all aurors have their floos open, in case of an emergency.
Draco could not deny his request, when he put it in such pretty words. He finally let his orgasm tear through him. He orgasmed very hard, filling him with ample cum. The potion increased his sperm count, intended to be used for fertility issues. When he pulled out, thick white semen immediately squirted out of his hole onto his balls and the bed beneath him. Draco smiled at the sight. He used his fingers to scoop it up and put it back in his hole, relishing the warm, wet, squeeze around his fingers.
He couldn’t breathe, no matter how many breaths he took. He felt like an elephant was sitting on his chest. Sweat drenched his whole body. The chest pain was severe. Maybe he was having a heart attack because his left arm went numb. He felt impending doom, absolutely certain he was going to die. He started getting dizzy.
Draco walks over to help him with the harness, but the first thing he did was slip a black collar around his neck. Harry flushed with heat and goosebumps broke out. It was strange that something so restrictive could make him feel so safe and wonderful. And he gets to wear it for two full days. His cock instantly hardens to full mast. He loved it when Draco slipped on the collar. It was his favorite part. It meant he was
Harry swallows as Draco’s gaze moves over his fresh boxer briefs then back up to his face. There’s a beat where they don’t speak. Where it feels…strained. Draco looks at him with a grave face, and Harry feels like he’s stepping into thin air as he moves to sit besides him on the couch.
“I…I wasn’t planning to…” then he continued in a rush, speaking very quickly before Harry killed him on the spot with his
“Why don’t we go upstairs, and I’ll show you more of my skills. I'm sure I can convince you to say yes, before the night is through.”
He opened his wardrobe and only then realized that he had no clean auror robes left. He didn’t have time to go home and change. He had to review the case. It was a thick file. Ten minutes would barely scratch the surface.
“Not yet…this collar has to be earned. It’s a privilege. It makes you mine, in a different way. The power shifts to me and you become my responsibility. It may be months before that happens. In the meantime I have a whole collection of collars to choose from when we play.”
He pressed his face into his back as he picked up the pace. Harry’s back was soaked with sweat, drenching his shirt. It clung to his face, but Draco thought it the most erotic thing, of all. He wanted to bathe in Harry’s sweat if it meant he could keep pounding into him. He was making a lot of noise, despite himself, grunting loudly as he worked the man beneath him.
Though he expected Harry to jump at the chance; he was always saying that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with him, Harry just remained silent, cutting his steak and taking a long time to chew before answering.
Harry groaned at Draco’s answer and Draco almost whimpered at the sound, bracing himself against the wall with his hands as he heard the tell-tale clank of Harry's belt buckle being undone. Harry shoved him closer, up against the wall, after casting all the preparation charms, so that Draco had to lean on his forearms. He rubbed his naked erect cock across his hole a few times. When he reached down to stretch him more, Draco smacked his fingers away.
Draco hesitated to speak, but not because he couldn’t say it. He would tell Voldemort, himself, he needed him every night, if it meant Harry would never stop. He didn’t trust his voice to come out the cold, emotionless way he needed it to. That feeling he experienced in the closet, the day before, started swelling up inside him, again, increasing with each of Harry’s strokes….which suddenly slowed to a stop. Draco’s heart stuttered.
Harry let out a howl of rage. He turned his back to the door for a split second to pull the wolf off Draco by the back of its neck and another wolf clawed straight down his back.
“Love, you say? And what of his finances? If I find out that you have taken a single galleon from the Malfoy accounts, to pay off his debts, there will be no place for him or you to hide.”
Harry had managed to make him cut all those strings, without a second thought, and now he was floating off, into the dark abyss.
Harry smiles, small and tentative at first, then hugely. He pulls out another ring, his lashes dark against his cheeks as he looks down at it in his palm.
Draco stepped out, angry now, filled with rage. He was angry Harry was threatening him. He was angry he was pretending to be indifferent. He welcomed a punch, if it meant he would drop the act. He was angry over the fact that he missed him, walking around his house.
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry who shrugged sheepishly. He was sure he was remembering the fact that it was Draco, himself, who put Harry in the position to be seeker. Without his antics, Harry may have never ended up on the quidditch team or would have started much later in his Hogwarts career.
After about fifteen minutes, a young handsome French wizard sat at Draco’s side. He began speaking to him in rapid French, complimenting his crocodile shoes. Draco was clearly too fashion forward to be straight, even in France. He then asked Draco what he did for a living. When he said that he was an auror, his eyes widened, but it was not enough for him to leave. They chatted back and forth. The man could tell he was English and complimented his perfect French accent with a handsome, suggestive grin.
WARNING: episodes with non-con/rape elements can be found in this chapter. Proceed with caution or skip this chapter.
It did horrify him. The man he loved looked like a complete stranger. A face he had never seen. Lost to pleasure in someone else’s body. Not his. Never Harry’s. Not like this.
He bent down to suck his cock as he was hard already, but Harry pulled him by his shirt to kiss him.
For not being strong enough, he wanted to say, but he couldn’t get the words out. So he leaned back on the bed. At the very least, alcohol promised sleep. He heard Harry shucking his clothes off like they’d offended him somehow, and he knew he was angry. He felt his frustrated magic lashing at his back as he crawled to his side of the bed and got under the covers.
Harry saw the spark in his eye and moved closer to kiss him, but Draco turned his head and started forcefully removing his robe, instead.
This was the final nail in the coffin. He would hand in a letter for transfer to the DMLE in Paris on Monday. He spoke fluent French, and had some distant Wizarding family there.
The world had righted itself again, once more, but Draco couldn’t help the nagging feeling inside his chest that something was off.
Draco just nodded, not trusting his voice. He remembered the sight of his cum splattering his eyelashes and chin, in the shower, when they were in Turkey. He felt his knees go weak at Harry’s confessions and smooth words. The man rendered him completely powerless and exrutiatingly hard.
Thinking that he must stop at the apothecary tomorrow for a sleeping potion, he felt a hand on his back and soft lips caressing his shoulder. He almost cried with relief. All this emotion left him feeling raw and randy. Going from multiple rounds of sex each day, to nothing at all for over a week was wreaking havoc on his emotional state. It was mostly the reason he couldn’t fall asleep.
“I bet. Do you want to have dinner this weekend to celebrate my recovery? We could double, if you like. You, me, Astoria, and Pansy.”
Harry laughs. It’s a bubbling saddening laugh, but it goes on a long time. Draco thinks there’s someone out there that can replace him? He doesn’t realize his affect. He doesn’t know about the invisible shackles. Harry, and probably Blaise too, would live the rest of their lives on their knees, if he requested it. He doesn’t know.
They used brooms to reach it, casting disillusionment charms on themselves. The landed on the roof first
Sunday morning came and Draco was eager to go home. He needed Harry, badly. He gave a few last minute instructions to Gabriel and disapparated to the international portkey station in the wizarding part of Paris. There was still so much more to be done at the chateau and he would have to return the following weekend, but he refused to visit France, without Harry in tow. He would not make it through next time, as a faithful man.
“And how the fuck does everyone know you in that BDSM club if you haven’t been there in almost a year. Did you go there without me?”
Tears starting flowing freely down Draco’s face, from all the gagging. Copious spit was dripping off his chin.
“Blaise, you need to move on. You know we can’t even be friends anymore. You need to find a responsible Dom who will take care of you. You can’t just show up here. I should whip you until you scream for this.”
Harry raised his eyebrows at that, no doubt thinking of ways to utilize this phrase in the bedroom, then slammed the door shut.
It didn’t take long; Draco stroked himself to a quick release, anxious to see his cream on Harry’s body. When he came in three long spurts, the white fluid covered Harry’s chest, glistening on his smooth skin. Harry gasped at the heat of Draco’s release, leaving a burning trail as it slid down his chest.
“Every time I wake up…when I see you…” Harry’s voice cracks. He drags in another breath and closes his eyes. “That’s the good part.”
He could no longer count how many times he had saved Harry’s life in the field, especially lately. The man was acting like he had a death wish.
As soon as he did, Harry snapped his fingers and the metal chain came undone. He walked inside and shut the door behind him.
The truth was that he had, a few rare times, back when he and Blaise first started. He enjoyed it, but Blaise liked Draco to top too much to sacrifice the position. Before their work trip, Draco always fantasized about fucking Harry hard, raw, and rough, to put in him in his place.
Blaise was definitely not opposed to this rough treatment, giving it as good as he was getting it. He groped Draco all over, not getting nearly close enough to his blonde angel.
Draco turned his head and kissed Harry, the sweetest most tender kiss he had yet bestowed on him in Paris.
Even as he said it, his eyes watered, but he couldn’t take it anymore. Harry felt like a stranger to him. Though he was still spending most nights at Malfoy Manor, they slept at opposite ends of the bed, never touching. They hardly spoke to each other, and when they did, Harry was always snapping at him for one reason or another. Reduced to a nervous wreck, Draco wasn’t catching a minute of sleep. The only reason he was standing upright is because of a pepper-up potion. He’d been forced to use one every day this week.
Before end of day, he received a memo from Harry to meet him at Grimmauld Place later that night. He considered avoiding the man for a few days, but decided he needed to speak to him about what happened, or there was no hope for them.
The next morning, they both woke up to an incessant tapping on his window. It was barely 6am. Who could be owling this early?
Dressing in riding gear, he went outside to the wooden Malfoy stables. He choose his favorite horse, Prince, an all-white Arabian horse that had cost him a fortune. The house elves had already saddled him and he was ready to be ridden.
He was particularly sour whenever he would spot him with Blaise, whether it was in his office or in the atrium, but it was always during lunch time or at end-of-day.
Then, there’s the kiss. Draco doubts he’s fucking her, but it’s still a possibility. Maybe that’s what he was doing the days he wasn’t having sex with Draco. Maybe he will be happier with a woman. God knows it’ll make his life easier. Simpler.
Albus chuckled and released his hand. Then, Scorpius stepped closer and embraced him in a tight hug, which was returned. Draco grinned at Harry, behind his son’s back.
Harry’s heart sank at his words. Blaise was hitting his most sensitive spot, his deepest insecurity about Draco since he saw him with Blaise in the pensive, six months ago. He swiftly collected himself, however.
charm. He had DMLE press portkeys handy on him and used one to transfer them directly into a holding cell at the Ministry of Magic in London.
He should have suspected something was wrong this morning, when Harry didn’t hex his balls off for nearly raping him the night before. No one immediately goes for seconds, after such an experience.
Draco’s hand sped up, and Harry’s hips started to pump, thrusting into the fist that surrounded him. It had been a long time since a mere hand job thrilled him, but this one did. Whether it was because of the man he loved or the spanking or a combination, Harry didn’t know.
Harry instantly imagines the bloody baron. He swears he can hear his chains scraping the marble floor. Though he expects Draco to leave him, he certainly didn’t expect it to happen so soon. His eyes prickle with tears that threaten to fall and he’s thankful his head is turned away so that Draco can’t see. He tries to speak, but no words come out. His lungs are paralyzed.
Blaise’s nose bumped against his soft blonde pubic hair, as Draco finally reached a crescendo of pleasure and came hard with a loud groan, deep down his throat. Blaise spluttered. He struggled to take it all down, but he was Draco’s good boy, and though he coughed, he managed to swallow every last drop.
Draco crushed Harry close to his heart. He was frighteningly happy; Harry did want more than his dominance, after all; he wanted his love too.
They quickly averted their eyes and busied themselves. Though Harry was usually kind and amiable towards his subordinates, technically, he was still their boss.
Draco let himself be groped in the dark for a little while. The sensation was incredible. He could easily let himself be taken over by Harry.
Ron gives a shake of his head, but he’s smiling. “One look at Harry crying. He did a little sweep of the room to see why, and then dropped these two fat tears, just for Harry.”
The both dressed and apparated to the manor. They had dinner together, mostly in silence. Draco went right up the stairs afterwards, feeling exhausted and Harry followed. They dressed in pajamas and got into bed. Harry had his ratty old T-shirt at Draco’s house.
Harry clawed at his body desperately. It was as if he was trying to get underneath his very skin. He rubbed his hands all over Draco’s chest, to his back behind his robe, alternating between caressing and grabbing. He removed the robe and pushed Draco back roughly on the bed before tearing off his own shirt and crawling on top on him.
e didn’t know what Harry was feeling, but he could guess he felt the same, as he was keeping his distance from him. It made Draco feel more unwanted.
It was Draco’s turn to flinch like he’d been hit by the kangaroo flogger. Harry couldn’t have realized how truly offensive that was. He had just insulted the very core of the Dom within him, in the worst way possible.
He pulled back after a few sucks, kissing the head tenderly, and licking the underside of his cock, over and over again, to wet it more. Then he went lower, licking his balls before plopping each one into his mouth.
door is slightly open. He can see its light from twenty yards away because of how the area is laid out; his door is punched into the center of a wall, the head auror door.
He began fucking into him at a steady pace but oh so deeply, sure to brush his prostrate at every other stroke or so.
“It’s because—“ Harry fumbles for the bottle. “Firewhiskey. When there’s firewhiskey…you gotta do it.”
“Master Malfoy, there are many reporters waiting at the gates requesting entry, but Neech isn’t letting them through.”
Draco was dragged back, and Blaise kissed him soundly, thrusting his tongue into his mouth, grasping underneath his chiseled jaw to pull him closer.
“It’s time to fuck me, now. We need to take care of this.” He grasped Draco’s hard erection in his palm.
“I am pathetic. The truth is, I…I don’t deserve you. You’re the savior of the wizarding world and I’m a failed ex-deatheater. If the papers find out, I’m going to be cast as some sick perverted monster who tricked you with dark magic.” He regurgitated Blaise’s cruel, true words to him.
He did not want to go back to Blaise’s mansion as he would be home by now, and didn’t want to have to explain himself.
He gripped his cock base and squeezed hard. When that didn’t do the trick, he twisted his balls, painfully. It seemed to relent.
Harry was alarmed by the pure hatred burning in his stormy eyes. He spoke in a soft voice, treading carefully.
“What do you want, Potter?” He peeked through the sliver of space, seeing only half of Harry’s face.
Draco encouraged him to pick up each tool and test it against his hand, needing him to know what to expect. He knew exactly how all these things felt like when struck on the skin. Draco may have trained Blaise, but Blaise also trained him, in turn. He didn’t just pop into existence as the perfect Dom. He made Blaise use all these tools on him as well, so he would know how they felt, how much strength to use.
He stood up, feeling dizzy on his feet, and began to redress himself. He repaired his robe, but it was still in a sorry state.
Draco had tossed himself off raw to visions of his night with Blaise all through the weekend. No matter how many times he made himself cum, he still felt no relief. He regretted going there for now he was haunted by the memory, but congratulated himself for holding back. He had never been so tempted in his entire life. When Monday came, Draco was relieved to have work to focus on, again. As he walked down for lunch, Harry was acting like a right prat, flirting with everyone in the office.
He knew he was fussing as he herded Harry into better light, and he he felt every inch of skin and probed muscles.
Harry jumps off the bed and walks straight to the shower. Draco pounds his head in the pillow, beyond frustrated. Harry’s pulling away from him, again. He screams into the pillow.
“Master,” Harry repeated the word, seemingly with no other purpose than for Draco to hear him say it. “My Master.”
I’m not free to do whatever I like, without anticipating consequences. You're my boss. I’ll lose my job over this.”
“I’m hungry,” Harry says as he pumps his cock and wraps his mouth around the head. Draco watches as he swallows him down inch by fucking inch.
Harry manages a nod. He knows he should speak, but he can’t. Thinking of Blaise after all the adrenaline from their emotional fuck causes a dam of tears to break forth and he’s shocked to find that he’s suddenly sobbing. Draco is dismayed and unbuckles the collar from his neck, throwing it aside.
The minute the door closed, Harry, practically, ran to reach Draco behind his desk, to give him a searing kiss.
“Oh, that’s right, you’re everybody’s favorite golden boy. How silly of me to forget. Well, fuck you Potter, you pompous prick! Not everyone is going to bend over backwards for you because you deign to look at them, least of all me.”
Blaise always required prep as It was not often that they fucked four days in a row, and therein lies the rub.
Worst of all, his BDSM fantasies that had previously dipped low into his subconscious had resurfaced, with a vengeance, in Harry’s absence. He was now thankful that he had visited
“Auror Potter, I understand the separation from your wife is causing you stress. The papers have been unkind to you, and you’ve been on edge. We have all noticed, but that doesn’t mean you can go around punching unspeakables, for no good reason. You better tell me the reason right now, and it better be a damn good one. There’s never an excuse for such behavior. For Merlin’s sake, you’re the Head Auror.”
Harry instantly fell on his knees, underneath his desk. He pulled out Draco’s erect penis and started sucking it down.
Taking a deep breath, he slips into his Dom role, hoping he has the strength to see this through. He thinks of Harry’s love, unshakable and undeniable. He could do this, for him. He needed to get rid of that cold, distant face that hurts so much to see. He just wanted his Harry back. This is the key. It must be done.
“Yes Draco!” Blaise mumbled particularly loudly from beneath Draco’s hand, and he tensed. Draco figured it was from the brute force. He was fucking Blaise far harder than he was accustomed to, with all his strength.
Draco has to struggle not to laugh at such a fallacy. This was the bravest, strongest man he’s ever known, the savior.
He held him still, down onto his cock for a few seconds then pushed him off roughly. Blaise fell sideways with the force, but quickly righted himself. Draco picked him up by his hair and threw him on the bed. Blaise quickly moved to the center of the bed, with his eyes closed, sure not to display any emotion on his face.
He made Blaise spread his legs wide apart and straight onto the bed, like a cheerleader doing the splits. Blaise was always so flexible. He could bend him any way he wanted. He sat up proud, facing the headboard,
“Pick up your badge from this table, and stick it back on your belt this instant, or I’ll do it myself.”
He grinned at his corny greeting. He heard rushed footsteps and Harry burst through the parlor. His face broke into a large, handsome grin as he embraced Draco, crushing his bones. Draco was instantly assaulted by his familiar oaky scent. He melted against his warmth and his strong arms. He instantly felt better and memories of the weekend quickly quieted, dipping lower to his subconscious where he would not have to think of them again.
Then Blaise is saying words in latin. Working his wand over the paper. It glows and floats off the table. It’s old magic. The bonding spell was looked up in an old Maloy tomb that dated back over a thousand years.
Morning came, and with it, new heartaches. Draco had not slept a wink, but next to him, Harry slept peacefully. He watched Harry breathing softly in his sleep, facing him. He looked so vulnerable and beautiful in his slumber. Draco’s instinct was to protect him, above all others, and his eyes prickled at the fact that the only person he needed protecting from, was himself.
With his calloused hands working his cock, all his blood rushes south, away from his brain. He stalks forward and pushes him backwards, turning him to slam his body hard against the wall. Harry’s forehead bangs against the wood and he groans in pain. The stables sways dangerously. Making quick work of his trousers, he pushes them down with his boxers just far enough to expose his ass. He doesn’t have his wand on him, so he holds his cheeks apart and spits between the cleft, using his fingers to wet his hole.
Dinner was strained. Harry was jittery in his chair. He wanted so badly to ask about his progress with the contract. He wanted to know if his training was to begin. Was he going to be punished today for looking up that woman’s skirt? He wanted to know when he’d be upgraded to
a dam of lust exploded inside Draco. Some days he wonders who the true slave is. It has to be him because he spends every minute of every day thinking of new and surprising ways to fuck Harry. His single responsibility is to please him and he wouldn’t want it any other way. He took each of Harry’s requests that first weekend he was in a collar as if they were the Ten Commandments, as if they were delivered by Merlin himself.
“I think we should arrive together, in case there’s a few reporters waiting. I’ll know how to handle them,” Harry insisted.
Draco stood up quickly and walked towards the door, so it looked like it was he, who had opened it from the inside.
As if he didn’t know he was probably one of the most powerful wizards living. Every day his power grew. He could do every spell nonverbally, just like Dumbledore.
Outside his door, their coworkers shook their heads. Harry and Draco’s rivalry had been legendary since their schoolboy days. It only seemed to get worse with age, they thought.
He was lost in thought when, suddenly, a hand shot out and pulled him into a utility closet underneath the stairwell that Draco hadn’t even noticed was there. He felt the blanketing of a silencing charm and heard the door lock.
Hermione giggles, and Harry moves from the fluffy rug to the half-heart couch besides him, lifting his legs in his lap. They decided to stay at Grimmauld because the media was parked outside Draco’s gates.
“Look at me, pet,” he said, raising Harry’s face with a finger under chin. Harry’s grass green eyes were already darkening.
He considered teaching Harry these things, but was afraid the world of BDSM would send him running for the hills, no matter how much he claimed he wanted it, and he would lose him, for good. He remembered the look of horror on his face in that pensive, and it always made him internally recoil.
He held his head down in the toilet for a moment, breathing heard, waiting for his vision to stabilize.
These were not memories of their regular sex, but rather their countless nights of play. Nights that Draco would tie him up or buckle him to the special table Blaise had in his play room. He remembered the feeling of Blaise’s warm ass, reddened to a tomato, after he had served him the flogger, the paddle, and the riding crop, sometimes all in a single night.
Draco pauses. It finally enters his lust hazed mind that this is not good. His cock is aching and leaking, but he knows he needs to stop.
Harry puts his glass down and hugs him tightly. “Don’t you ever say that.” He pulls Draco’s face down to kiss him.
Leather straps crisscrossed around his chiseled chest, crossing his lower back and connected to leather straps that held a satchel for his cock. His ass was completely exposed.
The one year mark looms closer, and Draco drifts further away. By his own hand. The harder he tries to hold on, the more he feels Draco slipping through his fingers. He tries shutting him out instead, adopting a colder nature, but that only backfires. And then, he’s just angry. Angry for getting his hopes up and ordering the rings, flying high off their Paris trip. Merlin forbid he wants one thing in his life and gets it. He’s angry all the time. Wanting to hurt Draco for hurting him, intentionally or not. Wanting him to feel an inkling of the pain that he feels, and he knows it’s wrong, but he doesn’t know what to do anymore. He knows he needs to stop thinking about the future, but he can’t help it, and he’s destroying everything in front of him trying to reach it. He senses Draco will leave him soon, and he’ll just have to endure. He expects it. Practices his blank hard face in the mirror to be prepared for when it happens.
He was fully hard now, cursing himself. There was nothing for it. He stroked his cock slowly. He closed his eyes, the image of Harry’s hateful defiant glare, right before he threw his gloves off was at the forefront of his mind, as he quickly and quietly brought himself to orgasm, Harry’s name on his lips.
The following week passed by in a hopeless haze of insomnia. Draco had one thing to look forward to, at least. Blaise agreed to meet a Dom named David that weekend after being begged by Draco at the Wizarding Country Club on Wednesday.
His brain exploded with desire. He gasped in the shock of pleasure that surged through his body. He had not felt the tight clench of Harry’s hole in months. Harry must have cast preparation charms on himself in the bathroom because his passage was slick.
Blaise just looked at his feet. It appeared he was thinking. After a minute of Draco fuming in front of him, he finally answered,
Draco thought he was being facetious at the time, overdramatic. Blaise did remember the contract and remembered it well. Literally, there could be no one else for him. A Dom may have more than one submissive, but a sub could only have one Dominant. He could play with others but could never have something real.
Blaise never threw these kind of fits. Until recently, his sexual relationship with Blaise was drama free, for almost fifteen years. Two weekends in, and Harry’s acting up. This wasn’t a good sign.
“There’s no need to be rude Draco. I left my case file in there last night. I can't do my work without it.”
He held his face in his trembling hand, cursing his weak resolve. Five minutes in a locked room with Harry was all it took to make him lose control and forget himself. He hated Harry more, in this moment, than he ever has before. No one should have this affect on him. He was falling apart. One minute he was swearing him off for all eternity, and then next, he was shoving his dick up his tight hole. His cock stirred, just remembering it.
Draco had keenly felt his erection through his clothes, and it was no small organ. It felt heavy against his thigh. He imagined it brushing against his lips.
He would just have to tell Harry the truth. What kind of man would he be, if he kept this from him, when he was so adamant with Harry about being honest with him.
Astoria looked horrified by this news. Draco knew he had her, on this one. He was not going to let anyone blackmail him into submission. He was a Malfoy, after all.
He didn’t know what to do. He clutched his head in his hands, until he felt a pair of strong arms surrounding him.
“I wouldn’t mind being introduced to a few Doms. People I could trust, that’s fine. I appreciate the gesture.”
The week that followed was a very good work week for Draco. His letter requesting a transfer to the DMLE in Paris lay forgotten on his desk at home. He did not even bother submitting it to Shacklebolt. What was the point? Harry would shoot it down, anyway. Besides, his life had significantly improved since he fucked Harry at the ministry ball the previous Saturday… twice that night, then again, on Sunday. He realized that technically broke the ‘one night a week’ rule, but the morning after didn’t count. That’s what he told himself, anyway.
Blaise was silent, his eyes still closed. Draco moved off slowly, his cock sliding out with a soft pop that made Blaise groan. He savored the sight of cum trickling slowly out of his hole, onto his balls and down to the sheets. He
Harry instantly curled up in the fetal position at the head of the bed. Draco felt the monster inside him, subside. He felt only sadness and regret.
“Don’t tell me what I’ll like! No, I don’t accept that. If I have to be trained, then so be it. If I could bring down bloody Voldemort, I’m pretty sure I can withstand a few months of your ‘training.’ I’m not afraid of you Draco.”
“Oh, you’re speaking to me, now? Congratulations. I would have congratulated you earlier, at the proposal party, but my owl invitation must have gotten lost. Maybe the owl was eaten by a giant eagle. I certainly hope so.”
He was jealous of Blaise for getting to experience what he called ‘his darkness.’ It was his most beautiful part. Meanwhile, Harry only got to experience his fluffy surface. Blaise had it all. He he had nothing.
I don't know how I missed that! I was too distracted by his clearly Italian name. Why did no one mention this to me in the hundreds of comments? This was a culturally insensitive mistake especially in 2020. Mea culpa.
Blaise looked up at Draco for a moment, pupils blown, their eyes locked in a heated gaze. He reached up to grab Draco’s arm with the hand that was not occupied on his cock. Draco lowered his hand at his bequest and Blaise placed it on the back of his head, silently begging, mouth full of cock,
The truth was he wasn’t bisexual or gay. His whole life, the only person he had ever really longed for was Draco. Everyone else was just superfluous, a way to waste time. They could be man, woman, goblin, or elf, it didn’t matter.
Draco was not used to people being so up front up their feelings. Until recently, Blaise always acted aloof. He always thought it would be a turn off, but it had the opposite effect, when it came from Harry’s mouth.
Draco fucked up. What the bloody hell was he thinking? He usually never mentioned him, but Blaise had been fresh in his dreams.
At the second “baby,” he roughly flattened Blaise on the bed so he lay flat on his stomach. He lay on top of him, his chest fitting to Blaise’s back perfectly. He circled his right arm around Blaise’s neck, putting Blaise in a more submissive position, lightly choking him. He drove into him harder, pounding Blaise’s ass mercilessly.
Harry did not have a set partner as he was the Head Auror. He was not required to go on field missions, but he would always go for high profile cases, and he would always choose Draco as his partner. As a result, Draco was left without an official partner, but everyone knew that Draco was Harry’s
Harry had made the switch to song writing and producing and Draco went back to school. Harry owned his own production company and had mostly taken a step back from the business. Draco was in law school. Harry sometimes missed life on the stage but he wasn’t resentful like Draco thought he was.
“Oh no, it’s okay. Just a really strong kick. Here, feel.” Draco took Harry’s large hand and placed it over his rounded belly. Harry’s hand felt warm and their baby responded by kicking right where Harry’s hand was. Harry looked shocked and looked at Draco.
Harry moved a startled glance to his father. He realized that James was sweating lightly and seemed to be straining. Harry looked out and saw all the Were in the nearby vicinity kneeling or bowing their head. Alpha’s of other creatures were giving him a wide berth or seemed too stunned to move. Harry tried to pull back on his pheromones but his body was unwilling to back down with his pregnant, bathing mate inside.
Draco stared down at his phone with a scowl on his face. Yet another stupid email from Harry blathering about how he lost his phone and got a new one but he doesn’t have service and doesn’t have time to talk. Blah blah blah.
“I know you might be nervous, but do remember this shall be the most exciting week of your life should you find and claim your mate.”
Now it was too late. Harry had let his insecurities and doubts get between them and Draco had moved on. Harry felt a lance of pain through his chest as he thought of Draco with someone else. But what did he expect? The blonde was amazing and Harry took that for granted. Even if Draco was having someone else’s baby Harry would be there.
“I’d love for you to say yes. I understand if you need time to think. I’m going to leave the ring with you and you let me know your answer.”
***********************************************************************************************************************
“Okay.” His son said in a cheery tone and then left with the door wide open. Harry shook his head ruefully. The country life had made his son very trusting.
Harry stared down at the small blonde in his arms. He was still in semi-shock that he had found his mate on the first night of the festival and was mated. His wolf instincts hadn’t let him knot Draco in the forest but he was unable to hold back in the tent. He didn’t think he hurt the blonde but he would check later after Draco napped. His father had told him about knotting but not how mind blowing it was.
It was so cold in the house but Draco was too lazy to get up and turn off the heat. He had been laying around “moping” as his mother said since he sent Potter the email. It had been 24 hours with no response. Did Harry not care? Maybe he didn’t get it? Draco’s mind couldn’t stop picturing scenarios. Maybe, Harry had met someone and was making passionate love to them.
“You are a beautiful person Draco Malfoy and any creature would be lucky to have you. Now you and I are going to show them!”
Harry just watched as the curly-haired doctor turned on the monitor and picked up the wand. “Draco if you can just lift your shirt for me, the gel is a little bit cold, but then we will see the baby.”
“Well you said you weren’t the father type either!” Draco said heatedly. “So I don’t know why you’re so shocked I wouldn’t tell you about the baby.”
“Stop it.” He said to himself out loud. Draco told Harry about the baby and that’s all he can do. The next move is Harry’s.
Draco sniffled and thought about what his mom said. In some way or another Draco and Harry had always been connected. His mother was right. A few months would mean nothing in the face of their bond.
Harry didn’t know how much time passed before he got off of the floor. He got up and went into his office and stared at his computer. He felt disconnected from reality.
“UGH!” Harry groaned as he watched his phone sink into the water. He had jumped into the fishing boat and it had fallen out of his pocket. He didn’t know when he would be able to get a new phone but didn’t have much time to dwell on it as Yu-En waved him forward.
Harry looked up at him with a guilty expression. Oh my god. It hit Draco that Harry thought the baby wasn’t his. He thought Draco had been telling him about a pregnancy caused by another man.
Harry had felt such rage he had blacked out. He fought several much older weres that had been left alive and destroyed them. His father had found Harry cradling his mother’s body both of them covered in blood. James had fallen to the ground before them with tears in his eyes. He had carried Harry and Lily’s body away.
“What is it you want to say Harry? Clearly nothing has changed. You resent me and the girls because of the life you didn’t get to have.”
Hi lovelies, sorry for the delay it has been a bit busy over here. I do want to say that I appreciate everyone who has given kudos and feedback.
Harry and Draco emerged from the forest and headed towards the mated tents. Draco looked down at his pale hand clasped in Harry’s large tan one. He couldn’t believe his mate was Harry all along. It felt right. Draco felt their bond humming in the back of his mind and it was a comforting presence. Draco blushed as he felt Harry’s desire flow through the bond.
Draco was quickly losing any coherent thought as he felt the pleasure build. He began to move up and down on Harry’s thick cock. Draco increased his pace until he was bouncing up and down and his climax was so close. Harry flipped them over and began to thrust into Draco.
“I’m sure the Omegas are lining up for you Gin.” Harry said as he gave her a playful shove. Neville rolled his eyes, used to their banter.
Harry just stared down at the blonde unable to say the words to make Draco leave and knowing he couldn’t beg the blonde to stay.
Draco almost wanted to say “fuck it” and stop trying to get his dense ex-husband to give him a damn call so he can tell him they have another child on the way. He went back to glaring at the email.
Harry continued his onslaught to Draco’s senses and then ripped his mouth from Draco’s hole. Harry stood and positioned his cock at Draco’s entrance.
Harry’s eyes flashed black as he emerged from the shadows. “No more running short stuff,” Harry said as he pounced.
Draco pondered her words. He looked at the creatures around him; everyone was vibrating with energy and some creatures were showing off their powers in order to draw attention to a potential mate. Draco watched as a shape shifter change into a goat while onlookers giggled and cheered him on. Draco could feel the pull of a nearby lake and the refreshing lure of water. It’s not that he didn’t want a mate, he did. It’s all he had been dreaming of since he was 14.
Harry smiled listening to the old Fae ballad. Draco was singing to their baby and didn’t even realize it.
Draco felt dread fill him as Pansy continued on into the house. Slowly he raised his gaze to Harry’s furious green eyes.
“I always do. But enough of that! Get up and get dressed we are getting you some new maternity outfits.”
Pansy looked at him expectantly. He read the question in her eyes. “It’s okay Pans. We need to talk; you can head inside.”
Draco moaned as he felt both his and Harry’s desire through the bond. Harry’s tongue swept inside his mouth and Draco brought his arms up around the Alpha’s neck. Harry’s hand’s moved from Draco’s bottom to lower and Draco felt himself being lifted. Draco gasped as their hard cocks brushed together and Harry’s big hands gripped his bottom pushing him closer.
“Because, what if nothing changed? What if this is all because Harry can’t stand the idea of someone else having what he classifies as his?”
“I don’t do love.” Harry said coldly. Draco stared up at the man he thought would be his forever. Harry’s black hair was messy as usual, slightly covering his lightening shaped birthmark which all the gossip magazines said made his bad body look hotter, his green eyes were distant and framed by the thickest dark lashes. Harry towered over Draco’s petite frame at 6 foot three and had a toned body that came from Harry’s love of rock climbing and fucking. His skin was sun kissed and smooth, Draco knew because he had spent many hours admiring Harry’s naked body. Harry reached out one of his big hands and cupped the back of Draco’s head. He brought his face close and put his lips to Draco’s ear.
“Well, feel free to do so. I’m not stopping you.” Harry almost flinched as he saw the way Draco blanched at his tone. God, why was this so hard? He thought as he closed his eyes.
“Well…you got knocked up by your rich boyfriend who acted like a total tool and is now back trying to be less of a tool. Meanwhile a very nice, not tool is also trying to get in your pants but is not your baby daddy and doesn’t set you loins on fire. Does that sum it up?”
“Dray?” Draco looked up and Pansy was standing in the doorway of the tent. She dramatically had a hand over her nose and was looking around the tent with classic Pansy flair. “My goodness you two went at it. It definitely smells like the naughty sex from your novels.”
A few months after they met Harry had left for tour again and received a letter from Draco while he was on the road. The blonde had gotten pregnant and was having twins. Harry had immediately left the tour and gone home to find Draco. The two married right before Draco gave birth to the twins.
“Exactly. You were gone so long. Why are you still talking to me Potter? Go make up for lost time with our children.”
A sharp tap on the carriage door brought Draco back to focus on the surroundings. He gasped as the brilliance of the Hogwarts Valley came into focus. Thousands of tents had been erected and Draco could feel the excitement and anticipation from his seat. He could smell the delicious scents of meats cooking and hear voices singing. The Aphro festival brought out every creature and their families to celebrate. Draco had attended once as a child before he presented when his distant cousin Fleur found her mate. Fleur was a Veela and her mate Bill was a dragon shifter. Long ago there had been war between the species, led by a man named Voldemort who believed there should be a separation of the species.
“Well, I mean..it’s been so long and you are so much bigger.” Draco said as he stared up at Harry. He wanted to cut his tongue out when he realized what he said.
Draco swallowed roughly and looked towards where Harry was sitting. The Alpha was staring directly at him with green eyes filled with heat. Draco felt trapped by his gaze and could only stare back.
“That was a mistake. I thought I was coming here to reconcile and all you wanted was to get your cock sucked.” Draco’s gray eyes flashed as he finally looked at Harry.
Harry woke up suddenly, he realized his cock was rock hard and looked down as Draco took it into his mouth.
“I’m going to continue staying with my mother. She helps with the girls while I have class or internship. You are welcome to see them whenever you want Harry.”
“No…I want to do things to you too Harry.” Draco said as he looked up at Harry with a blush staining his cheeks.
Draco pulled his arm free of Harry’s grip and walked to Oliver’s side. “I am so sorry Ollie. I should have told you who the baby’s father was I just wasn’t ready.”
Draco moaned as Harry gripped his ass harder and ground his hard cock against him. Harry licked up the blonde’s neck and bit his ear.
“I got it bud.” Draco heard Oliver’s deep voice call back. Draco smiled. He and Oliver had been married for four and a half years now and Oliver was the ideal husband and father. Draco’s smile faded as he thought of the conversation he and Oliver had last night.
He laid Draco down in the grass bed and began kissing his way down the blonde’s chest. Harry stopped at one pink nipple and put his mouth over it. Draco moaned as Harry sucked. He released the nipple with a wet pop and continued his journey downward.
Draco was brought back to the present as he narrowly dodged a low hanging branch. He had finally made it in the woods but he knew Harry wasn’t far behind. It seemed the Alpha was never that far from Draco, in mind or heart.
They sat and Draco leaned over to speak quietly to Harry. “Too many pregnant bellies for you huh?” Draco teased.
“I want to ride you Alpha.” Harry moaned and helped the blonde position himself over him. Draco straddled the larger man and slowly lowered himself onto his cock.
Draco looked everywhere but at Harry as he straightened his clothes and swept a hand through his hair.
“I’m aware.” Harry’s jaw clenched as Caleb ran back into the foyer. He was carrying a stuffed unicorn and his dark hair was in disarray.
“Is it so bad that I want to get inside my very beautiful mate again? That I want to lick every inch of you and listen to you moan my name?” Harry’s green eyes blazed with heat as he stared down at Draco.
Harry’s eyes flashed and he leaned closer to Draco. “That’s right baby. You’re a great fuck and we both know I could have you under me again in two seconds.”
Draco nodded. “That’s it then. Goodbye Potter. For good this time. As far as we’re concerned the father of this baby will be my future husband Oliver Wood.” Draco turned and stormed out of the apartment before Harry could respond. Harry watched in pained silence as the door closed and hid Draco’s distraught face from his view.
James smiled somewhat sadly and pointed past the family tents towards the bottom of the mountain. “He wanted to take a walk and clear his head.”
Harry paled and looked absolutely wrecked. Draco almost felt guilty. Harry had hurt him too much though he couldn’t back down.
Harry could apologize all he wanted but Draco was not doing this again. How dare that giant asshole insinuate Draco had slept with someone else?
Harry dipped his hand into the bowl filled with wet clay. He scooped enough out to appropriately make the markings. He moved closer to Draco and stared down at him.
“Gross huh! Well too bad my little Caleb bee cuz the kiss monster is here!” Caleb giggled and ran off. Draco chased him and grabbed his squirming body. He planted kisses all over his baby’s chubby cheeks.
“I am not even going to dignify that with a response.” Harry grabbed Draco by the neck and pulled him close.
Lucius’s eyes spit fire at Harry as he took two steps closer. “Listen to me Potter. I don’t know what your game is but you will leave my son out of it! Draco deserves better than some irresponsible jackass who only wants one thing!”
“You’re going to keep us in suspense?” Draco exclaimed and looked at his mom for support. “You’re a terrible tease Pansy Parkinson.” His best friend just gave him a teasing look and said nothing.
“Darling?” She asked again. Lucius looked back at Harry and said in a low voice. “If you even think about hurting my son I will kill you. Draco is beautiful and bright and kind. He deserves more than a degenerate like you. Do you understand me?”
“Is that so?” the man said with amusement. Draco felt like his entire body was blushing. He had never been so embarrassed and turned on at the same time. Finally, Draco, turned around and found himself staring into green eyes that were both beautiful and familiar.
Draco knew that things weren't perfect between himself and Harry but he wanted to try to have this be a positive experience for both of them. He still loved Harry, and even if they were never together again he always would. Draco laced his fingers through Harry's larger ones and smiled.
“Pans, you don’t have to do that. I’m sure your new mate, whom you’ve told me nothing about, wants you with them.”
“Looking for something?” The man said. His voice was smooth and deep. Draco wanted to roll over and purr like a cat hearing it.
Draco was feeling a little heated from Ron’s Alpha pheromones. Not that he was attracted to the man but they were strong and with his limited exposure to Alpha’s it felt like a lot.
Hi my lovelies! I am so sorry for the delay. My muse left me for a bit and life was hectic. Thank you so much for all the lovely comments and kudos!
“Draco!” Harry roared as he thrust one last time and Draco felt himself being filled. Suddenly, Harry’s cock was swelling and he felt the knot inside. The knot pressed against his prostate and he came with a cry.
Harry began to run the washcloth over the blonde’s arm and continued his journey. He paid extra attention to Draco’s hole when he got there and massaged his thighs. After he finished his washing of Draco’s body he poured shampoo into his hands. Draco moaned as Harry began to massage it into his scalp. Harry made sure to cover all the long strands and then nudged Draco to lean back so he could rinse it. Draco’s breathing was slow and even and his eyes were closed.
“UGH!” Draco groaned and threw his phone on the bed. He didn’t know why he was so reluctant to tell Harry he was pregnant. But every time he typed out the words something stopped him. He didn’t want to do that again. He didn’t want a baby to be the reason Harry comes back. Draco’s feelings for his ex-husband were so confusing it gave him a headache if he thought too long about the idiot.
“There’s so much more to being a submissive than receiving a few spankings in the shower and rough sex. It requires months of training, lessons in discipline and punishment. You’re not going to like it. The contract doesn’t come into play until the very end. Just forget about it, alright? We can still play together without making it official.”
it made such a sight. Harry was attached to a spanking horse, his ass in the air with leather straps crisscrossing his lower back, and Draco was surprised his cock hadn’t ripped through the leather yet.
It wasn’t that the sex wasn’t enough with Harry. To the contrary, the sex with Harry was incredible. He enjoyed being crushed by Harry’s larger body, fucked into the mattress until he screamed, being filled to the point of bursting with raw power.
Draco smiled with pride and moved to straddle him. He rocked his hips back and forth, leaning down to kiss him sensually. He continued to grind down against him, rubbing his ass against his clothed cock, until he felt Harry’s full hardness underneath his jeans.
“Do you think you deserve my cock, pet? After acting like the world’s whore?” Draco speaks with his back to him.
He hoped talking to him helped. Draco should have had more lengthy talks with him about it before pushing him to this stage. Too damn overexcited by Harry’s willingness to try this for a weekend. He forgot who he was dealing with. This was the same man who walked directly to his death to defeat the Dark Lord. And that was when he was only a teenager.
“The contract means nothing, Harry. It’s all in your head. And I don’t get it. We fuck like four times a day, without the collar. I don’t hear you complaining then.”
“Of course, Drake, whatever you need. The wards are open to you. The elves will tend to your every need.”
He didn’t mind in the least. He was wealthy enough for the both of them, and Astoria was a woman of impeccable breeding, a pure virgin, when he married her. She was meant for him, regardless. Her life was spent training to be his wife. She spoke seven languages and played the piano with a beauty and grace that was unparalleled.
He went to the bar, leaving Harry wondering just exactly how he was going to order with a gag in his mouth and bring everything back to the table with his hands pinned behind him.
Harry obeyed, allowing his shirt to slide off his arms to the floor, his hands resting at his side. His chiseled broad chest was revealed,
“I’m sorry Malfoy.” He rubbed the back of his neck guiltily. “You’re right. I’ll have them in by Monday. It’s Ginny’s birthday and we’re going out to
He decided he was going to confront the man at Grimmauld Place and hex him into oblivion. He did not care if he was carted off to Azkaban prison. He had nothing to lose. No job, no lover, no wife. It would be worth it to cast the
He lifted him to stand so he could dry him with the towel himself, but he swayed on his feet and almost fell sideways. Harry caught him, and his frustration was palpable. Draco didn’t know what he was getting so mad about. He must have forgotten he was a wizard and could use a drying charm on him, but Harry hated using magic for mundane tasks.
“Are you sick?” He noticed the insignia on the box. Draco hastily shoved the box under his desk, feeling incredibly guilty.
That’s weird. Harry being the auror he is, is always compulsive about locking the doors. He walks through it slowly, like he’s breaking the law.
Draco knew this performance was solely for his benefit. He knew it was all an act, and discovered that he did not like it. If he had to choose, he preferred the Harry who needed him desperately. He wanted to make him beg for his cock again. Harry’s role play was making him raunchy. When he was standing in his office, flatly informing him of a new case, all he imagined doing was slamming his head against his desk and shoving his cock up his tight ass, until he screamed.
Draco starts again, and the screams of agony are so severe that Draco thinks they’re being imprinted on his soul. But Blaise refuses to relent. Draco’s shirt keeps falling down to his neck and he realizes it’s because it’s soaked with tears. He ties it tighter and continues.
“Just fucking? What about all those things you said at Grimmauld, after you fucked Blaise, about wanting me?”
It wasn’t just last night, but the whole day’s events had put him in emotional turmoil. Visions flashed in his mind: Blaise’s soft touch on his hand, his body beaten and broken, unconscious in a hospital bed, Harry’s blood soaking his shirt, the soft thud of his badge being placed on Shacklebolt’s desk, Astoria’s big blue eyes sparkling with tears, and finally, Harry’s welted bloody back, with the werewolf marks, reminding him of his own first act of vulnerability when he had first let Harry make love to him.
Suddenly, there was a knock on the door and Harry’s door flew open. It was junior auror Smith. There was an urgent case that Shacklebolt needed to discuss with him in his office.
Blaise knew the rules. Keep it casual. Being openly homosexual was not an option for men like them. He would make sure to keep up appearances and be seen publicly with these pureblood women to squash the rumors, but had been falling short of his obligations, as of late.
“Ginny had something this morning so I had to run to Grimmauld to watch the kids,” he states flatly. Draco feigns deafness and doesn’t look at him. Slapping that emotionless expression off his face is all he can think of as he dismounts and pulls Prince to the stables, determined to ignore Harry.
They chatted easily and laughed often. Blaise’s sense of humor was exactly tailored to Draco’s, and he enjoyed it immensely. He was thankful that Blaise didn’t bring up the sensitive ‘Harry’ topic. He suspected Blaise’s high spirits were due, at least in part, to the hard fuck Draco gave him, early Tuesday morning.
“Who wants to be right? I, for one, would rather be a little fucking wrong. Better to be wrong with the right person than right with the wrong one.”
Draco growled with rage and threw a punch that landed on his lip. Harry touched his lip with his thumb and looked at it. It was bloody.
When he put on the tea, he turned back to help Draco up from the chair, by his arm. That familiar electric tingle passed through at his touch, and he resented him for it. He pulled his arm away roughly, and walked to the parlor on his own.
In a few hours, the DMLE floor was in an uproar. Draco could hear a lot of shouting outside his door, but didn’t know exactly where it was coming from, and didn’t want to check
“His top teeth were mostly broken. His jaw was fractured in two places. His cheekbone was also fractured and his nose was broken too. His eye is dislocated downward into an orbital fracture, so that has been difficult to heal. He may not see again from that eye. The other fractures were healed easily enough, but he hasn’t regained consciousness. They were analyzing him for a bleed in his brain, when I left.”
It’s Saturday. Harry should be home. He tries to floo to Grimmauld Place, but his floo is closed. That worries him.
What he saw in the mirror made his mouth drop open. A stranger with bloodshot eyes looked back at him. His hair was tangled in knots. His lips were red and cracked from Blaise forcefully shoving his cock in his mouth. Dried spittle and vomit covered his chin. There was a huge red hand print on his left cheek.
He walked right up to him and rubbed his cock over his lips. Blaise darted his tongue out to taste it.
As soon as he let his hand stray towards Harry’s open palm, the door burst open, and Ginny walked in.
Hermione visits often, but she can’t be by his side full time because the spattergroit invasion is starting to hit London. And it’s so urgent that she needs to be called away.
Harry instantly obeyed. A small trickle of pre-cum dripped from Harry’s cock at Draco’s commanding tone. Draco grinned and stroked his cock as a reward for his obedience. He used two hands to pry his cheeks apart and forced his tongue inside his entrance, thrusting it in and out like a lizard. He lubed one finger to put it inside, sure to push down on his prostate every few strokes. Harry shook, pausing, and eventually started pushing back to meet his thrusts. He licked around the rim while preparing him with his fingers.
Harry sighed deeply behind him, stroking his arm with his calloused fingers and kissing his back softly with his pillowy lips.
Blaise knew Draco’s biggest fear was someone, anyone, discovering the truth about his sexual preferences. Now, the entire Wizarding World knew. He could not have destroyed Draco in a more thorough manner. He would never get passed this. He had lost his best friend, forever.
Draco embraced him, in turn, burying his face in his shoulder. When he pulled back, Harry began a soft, sensual kiss on his mouth. Draco stroked his arms, lovingly.
They returned to England by International portkey Sunday afternoon. When they arrived, Draco gave him a mere nod and said “See you at work.”
That thought was like a trigger for his orgasm. He came with a soft grunt, and pulled out, before he was even completely finished.
Harry gasped in surprised pain. Draco relished the sound. Perhaps, he was expecting a spanking or lighter treatment, not having been able to see the conjured whip.
He was rushing to get passed him, but Draco could tell he was hiding something behind his back. He used his Dom voice to stop him.
Harry jumped on top of him and continued to pummel his face with his fists. Blaise was trying to protect himself with his hands, but eventually they fell limp to the ground. If he kept it up, he would end up killing Blaise with his bare hands.
He arrived at Harry’s door, too soon, knocking loudly and opening it without waiting for an answer, the same way Harry announced himself at Draco’s office.
Draco smirked in response though Blaise couldn’t see. Blaise was still trying to get his breathing under control. He eventually calmed down and and threw an arm over Draco, nuzzling his side.
It was proven time and time again that Harry had absolutely no idea what a true dominant/submissive relationship really entailed. The fact that he insisted that Draco tie him up and punish him was proof that he could never really be a submissive. A true sub would never insist on anything. That was the whole point. Only Draco was allowed to insist. Blaise had understood that from the very beginning.
***DISCLAIMER: I just realized I've made a grave error in telling this story. The Blaise Zabini in my story is a tanned Italian man with black lush wavy hair and blue eyes. I always thought the movie got it wrong when he was portrayed black, but  J.K. Rowling describes him as a "tall black boy with haughty features." *face palm*
Draco sat up now, his heart breaking at Harry’s confession. He never brought up his childhood or the war.
After a few weeks of Harry’s acting out, however, he was revisiting the idea of introducing him to BDSM, but there was one major thing that held him back.
Harry’s eyes widen. Draco’s chest heaves. He shuts his eyes and says the damn words. The ones that bruise his heart. “We both know this can’t go on.”
His Wednesday night had been spent, instead, worshipping every inch of Harry’s body in his bedroom, for hours. Draco blushed, remembering what they had done, as it had been a particularly steamy night. Astoria had Scorpius for the night, and they were free to do as they pleased until morning. Draco decided to make the most of it.
Harry paused at this, considering. Draco had him cornered now. They’d been fucking every single day, multiple times a day, and sometimes at work. Harry would never agree to this.
Stop comparing yourself to Blaise, for merlin’s sake. You aren’t even on the same stratosphere. The only reason I was able to fuck him all night was because I took a bloody sex potion, because of you! Are you happy now? I would start thinking of you while I was with him and I’d go soft. I couldn’t even get it up with anyone else because of you, and this started happening a long time ago. You made me an impotent limp dick bastard, at one point. Are you fucking happy now?”
They shook hands, smiling at each other, and chatted for a while as they were close in age. Scorpius rarely got the opportunity to interact with kids his own age.
“Listen Harry, I love you. Nothing is going to change that. Who cares about this stupid BDSM stuff? I never wanted to do this with you. I’m fine without it, and you just said you’re not into it anyway. I’m perfectly happy with that. Always have been. You’re the man in my life now, the only man. You’re the one I love.”
“Nah,” Draco grins. “Just thought you might like it up there where it’s…quiet.” Draco shoves back the blanket on his lap, revealing his cock straining his lounge pants. “I’m going to start having wet dreams soon. This thing is out of control.”
Harry laughs—tries to. “I’m not fucking lying, Draco. I don’t give a shit if we talk at work or not.”
Harry grabbed his hand and held it flat on the blanket. It wasn’t a rough hold, just a gentle clasp of fingers. It was low enough so that no one, around them, would see.
“Talk to me…you know it’s not your fault. People always hated me. I’ve been attacked while out with my family before.”
Ronald Weasley stood at the entrance. Harry was hidden underneath his desk, cock still buried in his mouth, but he stilled.
Draco feels something cool slip his finger. For the longest second, he can’t take a breath. His vision blurs and he blinks his teary eyes to look at him.
Draco was devastated by the small move. He knew what it meant. Harry thought him vile, disgusting, loathsome. He probably thought Draco’s presence in his house was nothing more than an unfortunate side effect of a poison he hadn’t known about. Maybe he was counting down the minutes, until Draco left.
Draco takes him to the cage by dragging him across the ground by his wrists. He throws him in and the metal door slams shut, locking instantly. It’s barely big enough for Blaise to fit in. He has to lie on his side with his knees bent. Draco stands there for a moment with his back to him as Blaise rattles the cage desperately.
Draco put the bracelet around his left wrist, and it closed immediately. The clasp vanished and it became a seamless infinity band once more. It automatically adjusted to fit his wrist perfectly.
Draco kept an army of house elves, and he treated them well. They wouldn’t accept pay, but Draco would often lavish them with small gifts, trinkets of his appreciation for their hard work. He never got them clothes, of course. He remembered how his father used to treat his house elves, and it always made him cringe. He was sometimes short and commanding with them, but that was just his nature. At least, he was never abusive.
Harry is struck with another horror of understanding that sends his heart shooting off into a sprint. This is the same version of Draco that Blaise called
The biggest shock from his time thinking through things in his stripped Paris chateau, is that he’s somehow still worried for him. He should be worried for himself, but all he can think about is Harry on his knees in front of him, crying his eyes out. Thinks of his heaving muscular body in the shower saying,
He threw Blaise, face forward, on the green velvet couch. He tore off his silk robe and pushed his silk pajama bottoms down to his knees in a frenzy, exposing his bare ass to the air.
Blaise’s face breaks out into a full, beautiful smile. He’s all perfect, white teeth and shining eyes.
Blaise moved forward, away from Draco, as if he were contaminated. They were no longer touching. His words pissed Draco off.
He kept tossing and turning, but Harry’s angry voice shouting at him, degrading him in front of everyone in the office, echoed in his mind.
Gearing up to defend Harry, the words get choked in his throat. He wants to explain how much they love each other. He wants to tell him that Harry loves him so much that he’s begging to submit to him every night. That his flirting is just a means to an end. He tries again, but he could scarcely draw breath. Blaise is touching his Achilles heel. Sensing his struggle, Blaise begins to feel guilty.
Harry lays his cheek on his clothed groin, thinking. He knows he crossed a line today and prays to all the gods that he isn’t pushing him away with his insane jealousy and inane behavior. But Draco has to understand that Harry simply has no choice. He has to push him to let go of Blaise completely. He knows deep down that he hasn’t yet, regardless of what he says. It’s not just a piece of paper. He can see it in his eyes when Blaise is mentioned; there’s always a tenderness there that Draco doesn’t realize he’s expressing.
A heavy sigh. No movement for a few minutes, then he felt Harry’s warmth behind him, and it was like swallowing the sun. Just to feel him. To be near him.
“It’s not like I haven’t seen it all, before,” but he did turn around at Draco’s impetuous look and began to speak as Draco dressed.
Harry saw the sadness cross his face, probably thinking it was related to him thinking of war times and pulled him by his shirt, over the chess board, knocking down a few pieces. They cursed and spit at him, righting themselves on the board once more.
“We have to head up to the mountains today. Are you up for it? I can get someone else on the case…But, I wanted the best.”
Finally, having had enough, he grabbed Draco and pinned him to the wall by his neck. Draco was much taller than his shorter 5’9 frame, but Harry was stronger. He used his other hand to pin his flailing arms.
Draco’s eyes felt tired. He was always assaulted by a barrage of emotion when he was around Harry. It drained all his energy.
Draco smirks, knowing he probably didn’t sleep a wink. That morning, they have a 9am auror meeting headed by Shacklebolt and his cock hardens as he watches Harry’s slow movement. His body strung taught with tension. He knows, instinctively that the plug is still inside and he’s trying to move in a way so as not to push it against his p-spot. His only regret is that his auror robes hide the evidence of his erection. Harry fixes his eye with a cold stare as he sits down
With only the ticking of the grandfather clock in the dining room, Draco and Harry had dinner. The silence was oppressive. It was pure agony for Draco, and he simply didn’t understand why Harry continued to see him. It was obvious he had pulled away already, and this was merely his ghost, sticking around to haunt him and taunt him with the thing he had lost. Draco couldn’t sit through dessert and retired to the parlor before it arrived. Harry followed.
Draco couldn’t help chuckling at that, even though it was an insensitive thing to do. Harry had indeed, once pummeled Blaise thoroughly enough for him to land in the hospital. If Blaise thought it wasn’t too soon to joke about it, then the least Draco could do was oblige.
Draco woke up Sunday morning, a man on a mission. Thoughts of heartbreak, over Harry, were far away. The first thing he did was head straight to Gringott’s, where his financial advisor worked, to order a complete audit and to look for suspicious withdrawals.
Draco didn’t know why he didn’t do this in the first place. He always did it for Blaise, in the past. The thought had occurred to him, but he wanted Harry to feel it for a little while, though he couldn’t say why. He also hadn’t healed his own love bites, opting to glamour them instead.
“Potter, you’re upsetting my house elves. Just let them do their job.” He dragged Harry out of the kitchen, by his wrist, to the dining room.
Draco kept the discovery that Blaise outed him, a secret. He did not want Harry to know it was him because it would force him to explain that he had kept the nature of he and Harry’s relationship, a secret. That would force him to answer a series of uncomfortable questions as to Blaise's motive. Now that he knew he was in love with him, he was desperate for Harry to never find out what occurred with Blaise, only two nights ago.
He walked slowly to the empty couch in the center of the front row and sat down gracefully. The front row was mostly unoccupied save for two men sitting in chairs at opposite ends. Sitting further back insured anonymity as it was cast in complete darkness. The front row was dimly lit by both the bright red light that shined over the sex scene and the light from the entrance. Draco did not mind being seen by these muggles. He relished in it. He took a sip of his drink and observed the scene before him. His cock hardened like a lightening rod.
He simply could not live like this anymore. He hoped memories of Harry would fade, in time, once he garnered some new experiences. Thoughts of taking a French lover crossed his mind, but he internally recoiled. He felt he was destined to be alone. He wasn’t good at relationships. He had managed to destroy every single one, in his life.
Draco furrows his eyebrows, confused. “Harry, the first six months of our relationship, you were shagging me. Did you think I was just suffering through it?”
Draco sat up and positioned himself low, down Harry’s body, so that he was directly facing his ass. He kissed and licked each cheek with a tenderness he didn’t think he possessed. Then he spread his cheeks apart, cast a cleaning charm, and feasted on his hole.
He should be afraid of him, afraid to displease him, anyway. But Draco didn’t want him to be afraid. He just wanted to let live and love with Harry. He was starting to get angry at Harry’s insistence. He seemed hell bent on this.
They departed by international portkey to London on Sunday afternoon, and spent the day horseback riding across the Malfoy grounds. Harry had never been more happy in his entire life. He finally had Draco where he wanted him, all to himself. It would be made official tonight. As the wind whipped his hair, he imagined their life together fifty years from now, on these very grounds.
It could be that Malfoy was simply lying about Fleur having wings too, but why bother lying about that when it would be so easy to find out the truth? He had nothing to gain with it, knowing how close Harry was to the Weasley family and in turn to Fleur.
Author's note: Many, many, many apologies for taking so damn long with this chapter *winces* All I can offer as an explanation is that the past months have been either exhausting or shitty or both, which makes working on a light-hearted story as this one fairly difficult to accomplish. I had a hard time getting into the right mindset for this one, but that's no excuse for leaving you hanging for so long. That definitely was not my intention.
Harry offered him a grin full of teeth. "A casual reminder that I fought worse people than them helps keeping them in line."
"I can't believe you're his mate," Ron said faintly, looking so pale Harry was becoming quite concerned that his friend was about to pass out soon. "You're sure he's not just messing with you? That'd be typical of him, trying to screw with your mind like that."
Harry raised an eyebrow. "It's literally a sweater and trousers; I'm sure you've seen nicer outfits," he snorted.
"Mother, what are you doing here?" Draco asked in the flattest tone of voice Harry had ever heard anyone speak in.
"Those poor students," Ron sighed and shook his head. "What was McGonagall thinking when she hired him?"
It was the same something nagging at him that he was missing something majorly, something that would actually tie all four flowers together and even explain why Draco had chosen two daffodils of all flowers to present twice. But what? What could he still be missing?
"Mother is here, right?" Draco demanded in a clipped voice and strode past him without even awaiting the invitation.
"All right, let me get this straight so that I have everything," Hermione said, straightening up and slipping into what Harry and Ron called her Research Mode. "You saw wings on Malfoy's back, he managed to get a stone through your wards and he can apparently change the colour of his eyes, correct?"
"I have no idea," Harry told her honestly and scratched his cheek, smiling sheepishly. "I haven't eaten in the Great Hall for the past week, because I was busy preparing my classes."
"I want to show you something. How much do you trust me?" Draco questioned out of the blue. His eyes were intense as he leant slightly forwards.
"What do they look like?" Malfoy deflected his questions with another one of his own; his grey eyes growing with a weird sort of intensity. He flew closer to Harry, making the other man lean back warily.
It was on the tip of his tongue to inform the blond that he hadn't had a partner since he'd broken up with Ginny, but Harry decided that that wasn't necessarily information that Mal-Draco needed to know.
"If she did, she would have been here before you would have found the first flower even," Draco scoffed.
"Not likely, bastard," Harry scoffed and pocketed his wand. "You send anything through my wards again and I can assure you, Malfoy, that's the last thing you'll ever do."
He glanced at the clock and hummed thoughtfully. It wasn't even ten o'clock yet, but if he Floo called them now, there was no way they would stop talking soon, especially not once they heard that Draco was about to court him. That news might actually sent them in a fit and he smiled wryly, folding the letter. Yes, probably best to wait until tomorrow before he would inform them of his news.
"What the fuck did you do, Malfoy?" Harry growled, seriously growing pissed now. What the hell was going on here? Why was Malfoy refusing to answer his questions and just what the fuck had he been doing with his eyes?
"You haven't, no. But ask her husband and you'll get a different answer," Malfoy replied. "He'll have seen them before. Often even."
She smiled. "I know where his quarters are as I used the Floo to arrive," she said amused. "Currently, however, my son is dealing with another Floo call, so I decided my time was better spent finding answers to my questions than remaining there."
"Big talk, Draco," Harry murmured and allowed their fingers to briefly clasp together before he pulled away from the desk and started walking to the door. "Now let's see whether your actions can back it up."
They had already proven that they could work together as colleagues – how much more difficult could it be to make dating work out?
"What kind of questions?" he asked blankly. Why would she even go to him when Draco was more likely to be able to answer whatever questions she had? He was missing something here, right?
"I don't know who you all dated before, but of course I'm going to be original with my gifts. I'm not going to be as plebian as to centre all my presents around the colour green or so, please," Draco scoffed and wrinkled his nose. "I have class."
Considering that Draco didn't have the best of experiences in the forest – not that Harry's were any better truthfully – it confused him as to why the blond would choose to make the woods their first date. He had expected to be brought to some kind of fancy restaurant or so, even if that sort of establishment had never been his kind of thing.
"Sure," Harry said innocently and right as grey eyes widened, turning silver, he darted forwards and pressed a kiss on Draco's cheek. "Good night, Draco."
He saw the note only when he picked up the daffodil. It was folded neatly in two, too short to be an actual letter and he opened it curiously.
"Yes, well, after Hermione helped me show off some of my skills, they tend to reconsider pulling stupid shit in my classroom," Harry snorted, leaning back on his hands. When he looked up, he could see splashes of the night sky through the gaps in the leaf roof. Small glowing balls of white light floated around them, illuminating the blanket and them both.
"I don't have anything against red." Draco rolled his eyes. "Just against that garnish colour that Gryffindor insisted on decorating the tower with."
"I have been patient for more than a month," she riposted finely. "I know why you kept quiet about this, Draco, and frankly the reason is idiotic to say the least."
Would he and Malfoy be able to make it work? They should be able to, right, because why else would his Veela side have chosen Harry? The Veela wouldn't choose someone completely incompatible, because there would be no point in that.
"Not a problem, Harry, students always have priority," McGonagall said briskly and waved at him to come closer.
"I thought she had stopped doing that?" Hermione said icily; her brown eyes turning frosty even through the flames.
"I … wouldn't be opposed to trying it out," Malfoy said slowly. "I'm still in control of the Veela; it can't let me choose anyone I don't want. It could have chosen someone way worse than you as my mate."
"You could have told her, I wouldn't have minded," Draco sighed. His wings were no longer flickering in and out of view; they hung clearly visibly behind him, spread out a bit. "I'm not ashamed of you nor are you a secret."
"You're really going to ask me that?" Malfoy asked sceptically. "Are you serious? We're going for small talk?"
"Well, hello, you're far from your territory, don't you think so?" Malfoy raised an eyebrow, leaning his shoulder against the doorjamb of his classroom.
A fourth flower greeted him as he entered his quarters, feeling a bit drained after having had to break up a fight between some Ravenclaws and Slytherins. He still didn't know what had caused the fight, but the end result had been ugly with eight out of the ten students involved having to be escorted to the Hospital Wing. Madam Pomfrey hadn't been happy at all and he had managed to duck out of the wing just in time to avoid hearing her berating the group.
They fell silent after that, but it wasn't an awkward or an uncomfortable silence as Harry had expected. It was quite amicable even, especially when taking into account the fact that he and Malfoy hadn't spoken in years to each other and before that, they had found themselves on opposite sides of the war.
"Don't think that means I'll be dancing every week with you," Harry warned him, but he couldn't help but grin, still feeling incredibly exhilarated from the dancing they had been doing. "This party is a lot more fun than I thought it would be."
"Wooing isn't restricted to genders, you git." Malfoy rolled his eyes again. "Fine, if that word offends your sensibilities, then we can call it dating. We're going to date and I'm going to show you that I'm the best choice you'll ever get."
It had been a while since he last had to solve a good mystery. Fortunately this time, it was a mystery he would enjoy solving as opposed to the previous ones, which usually had ended with him landing into trouble.
A short demonstration had thrown that assumption out of the window and had gained him the respect of the Slytherins.
"Now, now, Severus, they're no longer children," Dumbledore chided gently; his blue eyes gleaming amused. "I'm certain they'll get along better now."
"I don't know, regular ones?" He shrugged helplessly. "Like I said, they were gone in a flash, but I'm pretty sure I wasn't imagining them. For some reason he had wings for a moment."
"Nope," Harry replied cheerfully and lifted his broom slightly. "Came here to ask whether you're interested in another match."
"She enjoys it a lot actually," Draco said and turned to look at him again. "She said it was a better alternative to hexing her sisters when they annoyed her."
When Harry went to bed later that evening, a single larkspur was awaiting him on his pillow. He grinned and added it to the vase with the others.
He tensed up when Malfoy leant forwards and a strange metallic sheen seemed to slid right across his eyes, intensifying the grey colour of them. At once all sound became muted as if Harry was dunked into water. "And what if that's the case, hm?" Malfoy murmured; a strange lilt in his voice, almost like a croon.
Now he was even more confused. Leaning back, he stared at the page, studying the drawing of the chrysanthemum. So he had two flowers representing romance with colours similar to each other and one either presenting a new beginning or something like purity. Two had a link with each other, the third not so much. And why gift him two daffodils, but only one carnation and one chrysanthemum? Considering their meanings, he would have expected Draco to give him two carnations or two chrysanthemums instead.
"He served under You-Know-Who; I think some doubt about his intelligence isn't strange here," Ron remarked.
"You're going to call Malfoy or should I knock on the door?" he asked, tilting his head to the left.
The failure to spot them again made him start doubting himself, questioning whether he hadn't imagined them in the end anyways, just like Hermione had suggested. He'd been so certain of it, though, and he heavily disliked the notion that he might be losing his mind. He hadn't survived so many years of being hunted down by Voldemort only to end up losing his mind over some possible imaginary wings now!
Author's note: My apologies for the delay; I didn't mean to have a delay of nearly three weeks, but it was a bit difficult finding myself in the right frame of mind for this particular story. Still not entire there, but I didn't want to make you wait any longer, so I did my best to finish this part today!
Warily Harry accepted the letter and the house elf disappeared again, no longer remaining now that he had finished his task. When Harry opened the note – because calling it a letter was a bit too much – he could only stare at the content while Teddy softly whined to have a slice of the chocolate cake.
Treeling had definitely not been suitable to teach children, that was for sure. One accidentally melted down cauldron had caused her to throw a fit and resign three months before the ending of the school year. While she might have been a lot friendlier than Snape had been when he taught Potions, clearly she hadn't been cut out to teach people who might make mistakes.
She narrowed her eyes slightly and leant forwards a tad. "I'm not in the mood for any sort of games, so I'm going to be blunt about it: I suspect that you are Draco's mate."
"She is," Draco agreed and smiled faintly. "But she can also be rather … headstrong. And she's used to always getting what she wants."
"If I was a real git, I would just leave you floundering about, while you and your friends tried to figure out what was wrong," Malfoy pointed out with a snort. "Instead I'm here telling you the truth."
Concealing a sigh and ignoring some of the flirty smiles thrown his way, Harry made his way to the big table and promptly sat down next to Malfoy, who startled visibly.
From carnation to chrysanthemum to daffodil and back. From the dry information about their ideal growth places and origins to the meaning behind their colours and …
They both turned around to face her, watching intently how she procured the box with the golden ball in it. She fiddled with the lock and flicked the lid open, revealing the Snitch. Its golden colour gleamed in the setting sunlight and its wings fluttered weakly for a couple of seconds before it realised it was free and it shot out of the box, high into the air.
"They're probably going to have a collective fit about this," he mumbled, recalling how even now still, some of the professors weren't at ease around the Veela.
"I should have realised it sooner that he's a Veela," Hermione said chagrined and leant back in her chair with a huff, crossing her arms. "All the signs are so obvious in hindsight, I can't believe it took me this long!"
"I seem to recall he did invite Death Eaters into the school that one time," Ron reminded him finely, scowling at him.
"Professor McGonagall wouldn't have hired him if she wasn't sure about his intentions, Ron," Hermione said, frowning.
Having his feet trapped within the floor the first time he'd forgotten to warn her had been more than enough to never forget the warning again.
"Just for that for our next date I'll show up dressed in red and golden," Harry informed him and narrowed his eyes when Draco started to smirk. "What's that look for?"
"Plinky is following Master Draco Malfoy's orders, Master Harry Potter," Plinky answered, blinking his large blue eyes rather owlishly. "Master Draco Malfoy be sending a letter as well."
Malfoy's silence forced him to glance at him and he raised an eyebrow at the strange look the blond wizard favoured him with. "What?"
"Well, rest assured, when I take you out to a nice restaurant, it'll be one where our privacy will be guaranteed," Draco smirked and waved at the dishes. "Take whatever you want. I can have more brought if you want to."
At exactly nine o'clock, though, footsteps echoed in the corridor and Malfoy appeared in the doorway, resting his hand against the doorjamb. He smiled wryly upon seeing Harry at the desk and took a couple of steps forwards.
"If you think this is me being perverted already then you're really leading a sheltered life," Draco teased, his eyes dancing with mirth, letting Harry slap him once more.
Harry huffed a quiet laugh and straightened up from where he had been dragging the last desk back to its designated spot. "Careful now, Draco, or else I'll start thinking you prefer me away from Hogwarts and into the battlefield again."
He halted abruptly when he noticed the second presence in the office. Malfoy was sitting stiffly in one of the chairs in front of the desk, his hands folded on his lap. He turned his head to look at Harry, but surprisingly didn't sneer. His gaze did become hooded with apprehension, but the rest of his face was a blank mask, reminding Harry uncomfortably of Lucius.
He bit down on his lip, hesitating to ask his next question. "Is it true that I can reject being his mate without something really bad happening to him? Like say, he won't die or so?" He winced when he saw her face momentarily twitching with pain, a grimace distorting her face.
"Yeah, I didn't expect it either," he said ruefully. "I just want to confirm a couple of things he told me about yesterday, if you don't mind."
"Whichever it is, I'm still here, and McGonagall doesn't have to search for a new professor every year. She's pretty grateful for that," the dark haired man grinned.
"I mean, it's not like you and mother started off wrongly," Draco protested. "Pretty sure it was only father who considered you to be a pain in the butt."
As soon as he opened the window, she hopped off her wooden stand, spread her wings and flew into the night sky, rising higher and higher until she was nothing but a dark speck against the half full moon. He watched her until he no longer could see her and only then closed the window.
"I'd say that's a lot of assumptions you're making without any sort of proof," he retorted. "Him not mentioning me anymore doesn't mean anything else but that we're colleagues who don't start fight after fight anymore."
," Fleur greeted in her heavy French accent. She had forgone any makeup today, but it didn't make her any less beautiful, even when her face was slightly distorted by the flames.
"Don't know why you're bothered about that when you know full well you'll be able to break through it anyway," Malfoy sighed.
Back and forth he went between the indexes of the three flowers, rereading every passage again and again until the letters started dancing in front of his eyes. He opened the other books and read the information in those as well, though predictably they offered much of the information that the first book contained.
"It's not garnish, it's a warm colour. Just because Slytherin decided to deck out his dormitories in depressing dark colours," Harry scoffed and rolled his eyes.
"You want to fly against me," Harry repeated sceptically. "That eager to get your arse kicked again, Malfoy?"
She raised an eyebrow, but the rest of her face remained blank, making it unclear whether she was truly offended or perhaps bemused. "No, we're not," she agreed after a loaded pause. "But there are very few people of whom can be said that we share a bad history with them. That does narrow it down quite significantly, I'd say."
"You saw them last week as well?" There was definitely interest growing in those grey eyes, but for the life of him, Harry couldn't understand why.
"Oh, she does," Malfoy said confidently. "Every Veela does unless they somehow suffered an accident through which they lost them. It takes a lot to damage them, though, let alone break them to the point where they're no longer usable."
All the same, he knew he would have only two hours at most before she would kick him out, because professor or not, the library's closing hour was a closing hour for everyone and she adhered to that strictly.
"If you drop me I will hex you," Harry promised, but stood up; a spark of excitement growing in the pit of his belly even if he was still feeling a tad apprehensive.
"Hm? Well, I did sleep well last night," he said lightly. "That makes even the worst of Mondays slightly more bearable, don't you think?"
"Oho, well, what about I be your competition then?" Malfoy suggested out of the blue, a smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth as he crossed his arms. "For old time's sake and all that. What do you say?"
"Aw yes! Wait until the rest of the team hears this!" Wright exclaimed and rushed away before Harry could say anything.
"I had some house elves prepare it," Draco replied, putting some of the meat on his plate. "They were all too happy to help out once I told him who they would be preparing it for." He smirked; the smirk widening when Harry clucked his tongue and slapped his knee lightly.
"What the hell did you do with your eyes just now?" Harry snapped, whipping his wand out of his pocket and aiming it straight at Malfoy.
"And you agreed, because for some reason even at your age, you still can't resist accepting his challenges," she sighed and leant her chin in her hand. "You ever thought that life would be a lot simpler if you just ignored him?"
The blond stood right next to the armchair Harry had been occupying, his hands on his hips, and his wings flickering in and out of view, showing his agitation.
"I suppose not, though I don't know what he was aiming for with his eyes either," he replied, rubbing his left arm. "He looked like he was expecting me to break whatever he was doing, but if so, why try it in the first place, whatever he did?"
"You know how we've been looking to fill in the potion's position after Miss Treeling decided she was not suited to teach?" McGonagall began and Harry barely concealed a snort on time.
"Well, it all started when we were eleven years old and I had the brass balls to reject his offer of - " He chuckled when she threw a napkin at him.
"Interesting, very interesting," Malfoy murmured and this time he flew so close, their knees bumped against each other. The corners of his mouth unfurled slowly in a smirk and when he spoke next, his voice acquired a strange breathy tone. "Things just got a hell of a lot more interesting, Potter."
"That's because I wanted to have you to myself for as long as possible." Draco rolled his eyes and crossed the distance between them, wrapping his arms around Harry. "I knew that as soon as she knew that you're my mate that I could say goodbye to peace for a while. Case in point, she's already invited us to dinner at the manor."
So no, he wasn't a stranger to odd things. Basically came with the territory of being Harry Potter, really. He'd grown used to it by now.
"Which story do you want to hear, my prince?" she asked, settling down next to his legs on the bed. Her wand was put on the nightstand after she used it to tie her long blonde hair together in a braid.
"So far there doesn't seem to be any complaints, but he's also only been teaching for a week," Harry commented.
"Call me Draco and I tell you what my game is here," the git smirked, crossing his arms. "Shouldn't be too difficult, no?"
It wasn't that he didn't trust Malfoy – Draco – not to lie about this when it was something that could be easily researched, but he knew Hermione would scold him if he didn't verify it. Talking about Hermione, should he try Floo calling her and Ron still?
"Well then, in that case," she gave in as she always did. Settling herself better on the bed, she started to tell the story. "The story starts when your daddy was working at Hogwarts and got called to the Headmistress' office …"
Without preamble, Harry took the stone out of his pocket and showed it to the blond man, who didn't even twitch nor look surprised. "You got any idea how this got through my wards, Malfoy? You know, one of the
The second Harry arrived back in his quarters, he went straight to his desk to write a letter to Fleur. It wasn't a long one, merely a request to speak to him because he had some questions about the Veela heritage, but it would be enough. He wasn't that close to her, but he thought she would be willing to answer his questions to the best of her abilities.
The strange question had Harry frowning. "Yeah, not for long, but I saw them. Where did they come from? Why do they disappear after just a couple of seconds? Are you using some kind of spell?"
"Too fast for you already, Malfoy? That doesn't bode well for your chances, you know?" he taunted and laughed when Malfoy casually flipped him the finger before getting on his broom as well.
He pushed himself off the ground immediately after that, grinning when Malfoy shouted in protest. He halted several feet in the air and looked down at the blond, his grin widening.
Hermione tilted her head to the left. "Still with George. There were some problems with a couple of the deliveries apparently and they're trying to sort it out. Not that I mind having you over, but what are you doing here? Tomorrow is still a school day, no?" she questioned bemused.
As the team continued to gush and herald him for his amazing flying skills, Harry's eyes darted down to the pitch where Malfoy just touched down. He must have sensed him staring, because he turned his head for a couple of seconds, flashed a smirk and then left; his broom resting on his shoulder, looking just like he always did.
"I think so," Harry sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. "I mean, what is he going to do, curse me? Draco's not going to be happy with that and according to him, neither would his mum, so there isn't much Lucius can do."
Please leave your thoughts behind in a review; should you spot any mistakes, please point them out to me.
Harry shrugged lightly. "I'm tired of looking at assignments and while it pains me to admit, you're the only one who can give me a proper challenge. So what do you say? Fancy another round?"
"Don't word it like that," Malfoy said lightly. "Sometimes my eyes automatically change, depending on how I feel. That doesn't mean I'll be trying to enchant you again, just that my Veela is trying to impress you."
Harry wrinkled his nose, chugging down some of his own Butterbeer. "That sounds so juvenile when you say it," he muttered, scowling. "I knew I shouldn't have told you about the dinner."
"You sound sceptic that this will work, but mark my words, Harry," Draco leant closer and brushed his fingers against Harry's, "I will woo you so thoroughly you won't want anyone else ever again."
He opened the door, wondering just who the hell wanted to visit him this bloody early in the morning, and then froze when his brain registered who was in front of him.
"And that he managed to send me a gift through my heavy wards – that's normal too?" Not that he was particularly worried that Draco would try to tear down his wards or try to get something malicious through – if he did, that would be the last thing he would ever do – but it still seemed strange that even the strongest wards weren't capable of keeping out gifts from a Veela.
Of course some would say that dating Draco of all people might lead to trouble too, but well … Harry had never been good at staying out of trouble after all.
"The only reason I could think of why he is so reluctant to confess would be if he assumed we wouldn't be happy with this choice. Let's say because we have not such a good history with this person," she said meaningfully.
"You think he was trying to put you under a spell?" She rubbed her index finger across her lips, looking worriedly.
After placing it in a vase, he took a quick shower, wanting to be in the Great Hall before too many students would try to clamp onto him and ask questions about their classes. He liked teaching, but some of the students really didn't understand that professors liked to be left alone when eating unless it was literally a life or death situation. With Voldemort no longer amongst the living, there was no life or death situations anymore and so Harry preferred to eat his breakfast in peace instead of trying to explain once again to one of his fifth years students why trying to blow up a Boggart wouldn't work.
"The Ministry is really missing out on one hell of an Auror, I'd say," Draco's voice floated over to him from the entrance of the classroom.
Andromeda was meeting up with some old friends and had asked Harry whether he would mind looking after Teddy for the day. It being Saturday, Harry didn't mind and he had agreed immediately. It had been a while since he had been able to spend some time with his godson after all.
"Thanks, Ron," Harry smiled gratefully and dared to joke, "Don't worry, I won't tell you everything about what we get up to."
"So instead of catching it with your mouth, you decided to catch it with your chest this time?" Malfoy questioned, sounding a bit out of breath.
Draco braces himself and starts. He grips the leather whip tightly in his right hand and starts to work Blaise’s back with medium strength.
“I’m sorry. I was just upset. After that day at the beach, I thought this would become a real thing. Everywhere I looked, you were with Blaise, laughing and talking.
Harry sighs. “I needed time to think. It was my fault. I was all in my head...I let that bloody contract take over my life. I was being stupid, not myself. That’s all over with now. I promise to never behave that way again, even if the contract holds forever. I love you, and I’ll take anything you have to offer. Please….don’t go to Paris.”
Draco began to blotch red with anger, his hand itching to punch the man directly in his face. He clutched his left hand in a fist under his desk, hard enough to leave marks, to take the edge off.
It’s a fuckfest on the boat the second they arrive in France. Harry’s just taken him and Draco can’t help how hard he passes out. When he wakes up, Harry is curled beside him—careful even in sleep not to hurt him, although their legs are twined together. Harry’s eyes are tired and happy when he wakes a minute later.
“When are you going to start calling me Harry?” He stroked Draco’s bottom lip with his thumb as he spoke.
Draco immediately pulled out his badge and set it on the table. He was glad he was being fired. There was no way he would be able to endure this. He would immediately move to France and start a new life. He thought of his love for Harry and how difficult that would be to leave behind.
When he got to his office, Shacklebolt motioned for him to take a seat. He didn’t speak and seemed to be waiting for something.
Blaise’s tears stopped, almost immediately, and he flashed him a smile. He wiped his face and cast a glamour charm on himself. He looked fresh and happy again.
It was with a heavy heart that Draco finally called off the search, and disapparated with Harry back to the cabin.
After going home for dinner and tucking Scorpius in bed, he decided to take a quick shower to take the edge off. He needed to toss off before meeting Blaise.
Blaise answered and told him to just come through next time. There was no need to call. He needed to wash up and would be right down.
“I love you, Harry. I’ve got enough so I can give it out without needing to get it all back. You know what I mean?”
“I can’t believe you’re bringing that up. I didn’t cum because I became a monster last night and saw the damage. That’s not how I operate. I always want you. I’m just…afraid of myself. I need to get passed what happened.”
Bracing himself and putting on a mask of indifference, he fixed the short chain on the door on so that it would only open six inches. As long as this door was between them, he would be able to keep his wits about him. He opened it abruptly so that the chain clanked dramatically when it opened.
Harry felt warm and feverish behind him, no doubt from from the intense sex they had just had, not ten minutes ago.
Harry seemed to think he was in control again, not letting a single moan or gasp escape. He thought he was going to get through this without cumming, but he forgot who he was dealing with. Draco bends his knees and angles his cock directly against his prostate, over and over again, for several minutes. Finally Harry lets out a strangled “Umph,” and a jet of pre-cum spurts onto the sheets.
He isn’t aware of his facial expression but the soft touch gets him all teared up. Thinking it’s the sleep deprivation, he gets up and turns around to hide it, crossing his arms.
Draco feels ill with remorse. For how thoughtless he’s been, how unforgivably dense. He shouldn’t have ignored Harry all day. Blaise’s manipulative efforts vanished from his mind the minute he saw Harry in his sad state. The confident, strong savior that grabbed him in the ministry locker rooms to kiss him for the first time all those months back to “know what it’s like”—this guy whose hand he’s gripping right now
mentioned he had such a possession. He was only realizing now that he never mentioned his money, at all. He was shocked as the weight of Draco’s wealth truly hit him, but he tried to play it cool, chuckling when he saw the name splashed in bold letters across the side.
Draco looked up at Harry sitting in the chair across from him. The anger in his voice had lessened to one of incredulity and vulnerability. He wasn’t going to let that get the better of him, this time. He already felt his heart soften but ignored it, disgusted with himself. He did not answer, choosing instead to focus on the unfinished report on his desk.
It was late enough for him to dress in his silk, black pajama bottoms and a matching top robe. Harry was a guest but he wasn’t naive enough to be ignorant of what would happen tonight. He may as well dress for bed. He decided against underwear. They were going to be removed anyway. He liked the feeling of the cool silk on his cock.
“I specifically remember you making promises about fucking me, yesterday morning. What did you say? ‘Hard and fast or slow and sensual, you’ll fuck me however I want?’”
He wonders if will all be just a wasted dream, and he starts trembling, like always, when he thinks that it will be. He wishes he didn’t want it so badly, then maybe he could behave like a sensible human being, instead of lashing out at the one he loves.
Draco was sorely tempted, only partly by lust. He was more interested in whipping him until he screamed. He needed to punish him. He had come to Harry’s house intending to
“Don’t be ridiculous Draco. I’ll always want you. Don’t you see? It’s because I’ve wanted you so badly that the wolf’s poison affected me this way. The poison doesn’t lie. It only heightens emotions that are already present.”
“I was thinking we could get the kids together for a play date this weekend. What do you think?” Harry asked.
Draco’s muscles are all tensed, hunching towards him. It suddenly dawns on him. Harry’s potential discomfort is the cause of his grave face. Draco is worried that this would be too much for him. That it would push him away. Considering his new reality, he manages to stifle a grim laugh at how far away from that he truly is. How strange it is to think that Draco’s always felt like the helpless one, the one that was bending. The one without a choice. He remembers that Draco loves him, too. It wasn’t this sick slavery, but it was something.
He could hardly deny his boss. Draco was really starting to worry now as they descended the lift in silence and began walking out of the Ministry. He had never insisted Draco accompany him for breakfast before.
“Well, then, I guess I should be thanking the savior for all his kind favors. Thank you so much Auror Potter, but you’re mistaken about one thing. I’m no longer involved with anyone.”
Five minutes later, there was a loud knock on his door, and Harry opened his door with unnecessary force. Just the sight of him made his blood boil. He thought Harry would avoid him all day. How he dared show his face after behaving so despicably, Draco could not understand. Maybe he was coming to apologize.
Harry chuckled softly at his own joke. Draco pretended to be exasperated by his corny come on, shaking his head, but he honestly loved the way he said ‘daddy.’ His cock hardened more at the sound of it. Harry felt it twitch under his hand, pleased with his affect, and kissed his neck, stroking it through his trousers.
“Hey, don’t give me that look. You’ll never hear me complaining about being fucked over and over again. In fact, I was mostly delighted, until the very end.”
Draco looks at the reflection, but he’s not looking at himself, he’s looking at Harry. His jade colored eyes shine with love and adoration, and they look so perfect standing next to each other, a beautiful confluence of light and dark, that Draco feels a physical ache. He can hardly look because the pain is making it harder to breathe the longer he stands there. He marches Harry right up the stairs and promptly removes all his clothing. He takes his time with him that night. Making love to him face to face, he kisses him throughout, staring into his eyes. When he cums, it’s with a prayer of love on his lips.
Draco honestly could not handle more, after taking so long to tie him up. He wanted to fuck him again, right now. Blaise’s cock was hanging over the edge of the bed and was half hard already. He slapped his ass, hard.
“Whatever, we have to go out on a case. The file is on your desk. You have ten minutes to review. Suit up. I’m sick of seeing you out of uniform.”
There was the the sound of the curtain being opened and someone entering the shower behind him. He did not respond as he felt a warm hand rubbing his upper back, comforting him. Harry must have awakened to the wretching sounds of his sick.
Draco smiled at Harry calling himself that. It pleased him, to no end, that Harry caught onto exactly what Draco liked in a bottom. His only problem was that his cock was painfully hard now, tenting his trousers. He was surprised to see a wet spot already forming. He pushed it down.
“I’m sorry. This is all just a terrible misunderstanding. You have to believe that I would never cheat on you. I love you so much. I can’t live without you. Please,” his voice coming out in a tremor as he sobbed pathetically.
When he arrived at Blaise’s that night, around 9:30pm, Blaise had put on the works. The entire first floor was lit by soft candlelight and there was an empty bottle of his favorite red wine sitting next to a full decanter, which was holding the wine to let it breathe. Blaise had put out all his favorite snacks too. There were all manner of cubed cheeses, an entire charcuterie board with five different kinds of olives, and all different kinds of nuts.
Draco apparated to Blaise’s, when he left, quickly collecting his suitcase, then directly into his bedroom at the manor, to avoid Astoria, while he collected a few more clothes.
“Don’t do that. I hate to see that face,” Blaise says, frustrated now. He stands up and turns his back to him, crossing his arms.
“Don’t lie to me Draco. It was dated a few weeks ago. The night before you fucked me in the ministry showers. And I went to back to watch the rest of it. You fucked him that same morning.”
He felt awful about himself. It appeared that he just could not help being a selfish prick, and it rankled. He tried, after the war, to be a better person. He thought he had succeeded, but the Blaise situation was making him doubt himself.
Because it won’t be easy— you’re making a decent start right now. But you almost let me hurt you, and that’s not something I want. Harry, we don’t have to do this. You don’t have to, pet. You know how I feel about you.”
He threw back the last of his his fourth glass of scotch, feeling lighter, and stepped aside to let him in.
“Eyes down, pet.” Draco gave him a little reminder and Harry gratefully lowered his eyes, not wanting to see any more.
That was Harry’s ego talking. It seemed he didn’t learn his lesson yesterday, not truly. He never broke using his safe words, after all. He still thought he was the one in control. Draco knew just the way to break him and make him beg.
It was a lot of cum, five days’ worth. Some dripped out of his mouth onto the floor. Harry didn’t swallow every time, but when he did, it was huge turn on. He swallowed it all, looking up at Draco and licking his lips.
His fevered eyes roll towards her. His lips part, and his eyes narrow. Then he swings his gaze to Draco.
Draco considered storming into Harry’s office to demand a real case, but he could not bring himself to do it. The thought of facing him brought a torrent of emotions he would just rather avoid.
Around 3am, Draco was nudged awake by soft kisses on his back. Harry was curled up behind him, rubbing his erect cock against his ass, up, down, and all around. He stroked his back with his free hand causing him to shiver.
Was all that going to change? Would it be awkward and uncomfortable? Or maybe (hopefully), he would pretend like nothing happened.
The case that Harry took a special interest in involved a crime ring of professionals who were smuggling highly illegal potions across the border in large quantities.
“As you can see,” Mr Wolfe shrugged. “Charles is never more beautiful than when he is suffering. Kneel up. Isn’t that right, slave?” He tugged on the chains attached to Charles’ nipples, and the sub moaned and shut his eyes.
He decided to go to the gym that night in an effort to clear his head. When he walked by Harry’s open door, he called after him. Draco retreated back to his office, head bent low. He couldn’t look at him. He would know the truth, just by seeing his eyes.
Draco works the whip over him, sure to paint his entire back with red lines. He uses medium strength with the flogger, not wanting to hurt him, but still making each stroke count. He enjoys the view of the lines crisscrossing with his werewolf marks, long healed. He knows Harry’s limits now and knows exactly how to hurt him to make it feel so good, frequently checking around his front to make sure Harry’s still hard.
The image of Draco in white robes standing across from him as they exchange vows flashes in his mind. Razor sharp because he’s imagined it so many times, thinking of everything down to the white peonies. If he can’t let go of Blaise, it will never come to fruition. Tears spring to his eyes when he thinks of the rings he’s already had commissioned for both of them, solid titanium with both the Malfoy and Peverell coat of arms engraved on the inside. He placed the order on Sunday, right after they returned from Paris. He told Draco he was going to check on the kids, which he did, and went straight to Diagon Alley afterwards to have them made before joining him for horseback riding…before the contract.
“Stop the charade. Why don’t you want to fuck me, Draco? Tell me. It never seemed to be a problem to fuck Blaise for fifteen fucking years, but I’m not good enough? You didn’t cum last night. I felt you go soft, inside me.”
Ample cum trickled out of his ass, down to his leg, and he resented him for it. It felt disgusting. When he looked down, around his leg, the seamen was thick and plentiful. Draco was shocked that Harry had any left.
