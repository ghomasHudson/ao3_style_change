“Yes, that monster was apprehended. And Draco is fine; he went to get coffee.”
"Not now Potter, I've got to brush my teeth. Really, next time warn a fellow or at least use a refresher charm first."
“Henry, here,” Malfoy, Damien, settled a hand on his arm, “has a large family so we were thinking portkeys of course if we ever do come to a decision on where in France we’ll be setting it. I’d prefer the beach, he wants a church, I'm sure you know how it goes.” Malfoy laughed. They’d been making a show of affection towards each other during the interviews. To gauge the planner's reaction, of course. Harry absentmindedly found himself reaching over to entwine their hands; the cool metal of the engagement ring Malfoy wore wasn’t unpleasant against his own skin. Their current interview was with an elderly witch, Mrs. Kinsington, who had met with two of the couples that later became victims. While Harry hardly believed in coincidence he was pretty sure this woman wasn’t the vicious murderer they were looking for. For one, she probably weighed eighty pounds soaking wet. Another clue being a framed and dated looking picture of a younger woman that was probably the witch’s daughter embracing another witch at what looked to be their wedding. No, Harry doubted the warmth in her eyes as she spoke about alternative venues to “fit both of them” was faked. Harry smiled at her and gave Malfoy’s hand a gentle squeeze. To get his attention.
“Our nap, yes. But please come in.”
Harry felt, not for the first time in his life, as if the older man could somehow see into his thoughts. Perhaps he could, there was always more unknown to magic than Harry would ever learn.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco arched a brow smugly, “Well neither does decorating the tree in gryffindor colors. Or did you think I wouldn't notice?”
Ollivander's shop was quiet most mornings. Harry usually took the quiet early hours to go over the case or read. Sometimes he even actually helped Olivander around the shop and the shop was certainly cleaner since “Henry” started working there.
“How do you know what others feel? How can I know what he-” he cut himself off with a shake of his head, fist clenched at his sides. He couldn’t ask this of the other man. He couldn’t allow himself to be so exposed. He was toeing a dangerous line already. He should really go.
“What makes you guess that?”
Harry couldn’t help the shocked laugh at her phrasing, considering where they were, and that drew Beth’s attention back to him with a raised brow, “What? It’s true. I don’t know how I'm going to survive between my worry and regard for her.”
Harry laughed again, ignoring the pain radiating in his side and cupped Draco’s jaw in his hand,
“Harry!” His eyes sprung open and for a moment he mindlessly fought against the hands on his shoulders before his brain caught up to his blurry vision. Worried grey eyes scanned his face, strands of blonde hair messily framing Malfoy’s face as gentle but firm hands gripped Harry’s arms. Malfoy leaned half over him. For some reason this was soothing instead of panic inducing. Malfoy was frowning, now rubbing circles on his arms, “It’s okay. It was just a dream. I’ve got you; you’re okay.”
"Was that really necessary?"
The snort that followed her words was so loud what few customers were in and even the girl manning the counter looked over in surprise. Draco, to his credit, really made a valiant effort not to laugh. An effort that broke as soon as the woman herself fell into a fit of laughter at the sudden attention. They laughed together and perhaps a few people looked at them as if they’d lost their minds, and perhaps they had, but Draco was just happy to see the woman smiling.
Anne raised a curious brow, “I could make dinner for four if you’re a fan of traditional greek?”
Beth opened the container and smiled, setting it aside only to surprise him with a hug. After his initial surprise he returned the gesture. When they separated both exchanged greetings with the others before Draco settled into a conversation with Anne and Beth gestured at the seat next to her. Conversation about nothing came surprisingly easy between them. Harry personally had found it was soothing to remember there was an outside world in times of personal turmoil. Beth seemed to appreciate the distraction. They spoke of everything from politics to quidditch. Harry was delighted to find Beth was also an avid Holyhead Harpies supporter, and found it quite difficult to turn the conversation away before he let his familiarity with a certain chaser show.
Draco shuddered at the fresh memory of Anne, teasing gentle Anne, repeating that monster’s words. Her body had shaken but her hoarse voice was as strong as it was angry. Though she was far more satisfied when she told them of how she’d managed to get away with the help of a technique she’d learned from a muggle movie. A technique called SING: solar plexus, instep, nose, groin. After she’d thrown off her assailant with that she’d used a muggle device called Pepper Spray; which apparently didn’t actually spray peppers but instead produced a thick mist of chemicals that when aimed at an attacker’s face causes temporary pain and even blindness. Draco had to admit the Muggles were certainly clever to invent such a potion and it was perhaps due to Anne’s muggle childhood and relatives that she was still alive now. Draco had never been so happy someone was half-blood; a thought that he’d never have admitted to years ago. Muggle knowledge had saved her life when magic had failed against this man so far, and Draco wasn’t going to deny it. He wasn’t the messed up kid he used to be with all that hate and prejudice ingrained in him. He wasn’t going to become his father.
When Draco made to stand however Potter blocked the doorway, shaking his head, "Nope."
When he’d tossed his clothes and come to stand by the bed Malfoy finally deigned to acknowledge his presence, face somehow still pink. From the shower. Dryly intoning, “What?”
She then proceeded to leave the café laughing at Draco’s sputtering attempt to find a reply. Just as she’d reached the door a patronus in the shape of a stag burst through the wall, stopping just short of Draco’s table. He could feel his blood turn to ice in his veins as the patronus opened it’s mouth and Harry’s voice came out in a rushed whisper, “Alley connecting Heritage to Chestnut, call reinforcements, it was-”
"Yes."
"Harry James Potter-"
Potter nodded, “Yeah, I mean it’s a good opportunity to ask them about the people they see and work with, see if they’ve noticed anything off.”
Draco sputtered at that, “I- the way he-?”
He’d introduced himself as Henry Varma and ollivander had greeted him with a bemused look in his twinkling silver eyes. He looked good for a man of his age and Harry was glad to see he has recovered well from the war; Last Harry had seen him, ollivander had looked more skeletal than man. Harry got the feeling that despite the ministry having set up his cover in advance, contacting ollivander to get his agreement to place an undercover agent, that the man saw right through his glamour as Henry Varma to the man underneath. Yet Ollivander made no comment on it and greeted him as Mr.Varma. Harry had read the ministry dossier on wandmaking and his cover twice. It still hadn’t prepared him for working in the backroom of Ollivander’s shop; it was massive and the tools of wandmaking made him feel like he was in his first year at Hogwarts again. Ollivander was patient and the schedule he’d come up with was ideal for Harry’s cover: desk days and workshop days. On desk days he would work the front shop so that Ollivander would have some time to work on crafting wands. The two days he worked the desk he took inventory and showed people around the shop, introducing himself as Ollivander’s apprentice to anyone curious enough to inquire. The other three days he “worked” in the back room. And while Ollivander did show him the basics of the shop they both knew perfectly well that the three days he spent “in” the backroom would actually be spent investigating - something made much easier when one owns an invisibility cloak.
“It is his name Ronald. And he apologized. Surely you can be mature about this if he can?” Hermione smiled at Ron as if in challenge. Ron just huffed and rolled his eyes,
Draco cast Petrificus Totalus.
He didn't mention who, because well he doubted that knowing Draco Malfoy was going to be the one watching his back would do anything to help with Hermione's nerves. Her narrowed glare eased into an analyzing stare and she raised an eyebrow at him, clearly wanting to know more. But his hands were tied. Undercover ops were kept confidential for a reason. Hermione knew that and he knew that. But it didn't make it any easier to keep information from the woman used to knowing anything and Harry had no doubt that if she decided to look into it she'd eventually uncover what case he was assigned to and who with. But she wouldn't. She respected the logic behind the secrecy rules too much and wouldn't do anything that would endanger him.
Potter laughed at that, “I can see that.”
“It’s alright my boy,” his tone was full of suppressed laughter as he went on, “but what’s got you in such a tizzy, young man? It does not seem like you.”
“Like I got run over by the night bus,” He laughed and oh that smarted, “oof, maybe I should avoid laughing for awhile.”
Draco was hunched over his desk, a glow of green coming from whatever it was he was leaning over. Sparks of electric blue shot up from the glow suddenly and Draco stopped his humming in a sudden string of choice words. Harry couldn’t help the chuckle that left him at the sight, tension finally leaving his shoulders. Draco whipped around to face him face flushed in either embarrassment or excitement Harry couldn’t tell as he’d started speaking rapidly,
Potter didn’t even turn to look at him as he replied, “Making dinner, fettuccine alfredo alright?”
Draco’s sigh came out like a cloud of smoke in the cold air as they kept walking down the street, “I figured as much. It’s a good thing he’s a baker rather than a butcher because I don’t think that man could hurt a fly. Unless you count talking it to death.”
How had this happened? When did it start? Sure, he'd always found Draco attractive but…
A long hot shower was exactly what Harry’s stiff and sore muscles needed. It had been a long day and a familiar twinge had built up in his scarred left leg, an old auror injury. The healers had done what they could; he had just been happy to wake up and still have his leg. He wasn’t vain and it wasn’t like he hadn’t his share of spell scars already. At least these days his most notable one was dormant and the only headaches he got were work related. Or Malfoy the stubborn git. Even when he wasn’t around Harry found his thoughts drifting back to him. To an argument they’d shared or the look of concentration he got during their chess matches. The way he frowned at Harry’s attempts to pair the collared shirts, vests and pressed trousers he wore for his cover and would float over a more suitable shirt or vest with a roll of his eyes and a flick of his wand. The way he looked so much softer than the Malfoy Harry had known, in his large sweaters and soft colors that complimented his complexion and so well.
Malfoy turned back from him with a disgusted noise and returned his focus to his new wardrobe, “As if it’s not bad enough to live with a mannerless slob they expect me to wear these things?”
Harry left Robbards office with an even bigger headache than before. He and Malfoy would just have to find a way to get along. How hard could it be? It had been 4 years afterall. And to go undercover immediately together?
Potter seemed to process this, taking off his transfigured glasses and cleaning them, “A double date? You said they work at the café and hospital, right?”
At some point they moved their conversation to the kitchen slash living room. Draco made the tea of course because Potter couldn’t be trusted to make it correctly. Draco took his with the smallest teaspoon of sugar and a dash of cream. Potter of course poured in a disgusting amount of cream and sugar. Draco shook his head at it as they sat across from each other at their little round dining table. Taking a sip of his properly made tea he began, “We should make a list. Set some ground rules.”
He’d missed them. Harry let his gaze trail over the room next and came to a sudden realization; where was Draco? The last thing Harry remembered was Draco disappearing around the corner of that alley. Was he okay? Had they caught the guy? Where was Draco? Harry asked his best friends all these things in a rush and Hermione shushed him in what he supposed would normally be a soothing manner before replying,
"Just- hold me."
Malfoy nodded with a serious expression, “Yes, that’s probably best. Sticking as close as possible to the truth makes a lie more convincing. So, a sudden romance between old… friends?”
Silence.
Draco stayed silent at that, because really he couldn’t object to that fact. They were being unprofessional, not that he was going to admit it. But he stayed quiet as Potter went on,
Harry didn’t want to think about what would happen after the case ended. He didn’t want everything he’d felt had grown between them, the teasing conversations and easy familiarity, to end. It wasn’t for him alone to decide though; he knew he would take as much or as little as Draco wished to share with him and he would have to live with that. He would have to.
He was relieved that the aurors had people undercover at the hospital to watch Anne and to tail Beth at all times. This bastard wouldn’t be able to get to them again, not with aurors around. His colleagues might have a low opinion of him but he at least could admit they were capable and formidable folk when it came down to business. He felt better knowing Beth and Anne were protected by the aurors. Even if he'd never tell his fellow aurors that.
“Nothing of the sort!”
“All the more reason-”
Draco nodded dumbly before realizing Potter couldn’t see him and cursed himself internally over how uncertain his own reply sounded, “Sure?”
Harry awoke to near burnt bacon and runny eggs. Though he ate it gladly with his, thankfully alright, toast and a smile on his face. Malfoy had made them breakfast. Now that was a first. But when he asked all Malfoy had said was that it was a, “thank you” and to shut up before he changed his mind. Harry did not complain. Though watching Malfoy’s face twist into a frown at his own cooking was a sight. Harry did not laugh, though they both finished with their breakfast rather quick. It was the thought that Harry appreciated. After all, as evidenced by this breakfast, how often did Malfoy cook for someone else? It was...sweet. A word he would never have associated with Malfoy before.
“I’m not so good a baker as a cook but-” Bashfully he presented the still warm covered dish to the pastry chef, “I thought this would be a safe bet to get past the healers.”
“Scared, Potter?”
“Not what I intended.” Potter muttered looking back at the tree, scratching his stubbly chin in thought.
Draco shook his head, smiling, “I don’t think you have to worry about that anymore if this was any indication of your skill.”
Harry didn’t consider himself all that great a cook but if they were to have guests then he was going to put in the effort. After the war, ever since he’d officially moved into Grimmauld Place he’d had a few chances to entertain his friends. And it turned out, after throwing himself into renovations to make the place feel like a home, that he rather enjoyed cooking for people he cared about and who cared about him. It made it less of a chore. And this little apartment he shared with Draco had begun to feel similarly comfortable despite the impersonalness of the space. It still had touches of them here and there. Malfoy’s teas from his mother. Harry’s knitted blanket from Molly, thrown over the sofa. The few plants they’d actually bought from the florists they visited. And if that didn’t give Harry an idea. He checked the time and set the soup to simmer before shrugging on his coat.
Silence. Save for the thundering of Draco’s heart against his ribcage. He took off running to the bins Harry should be behind and almost let out a breath of relief to see the other wizard still there. But then he noticed his eyes weren’t open and his chest was rising and falling erratically. Someone keeps shouting, “No!”
Draco had plopped down on a bench at some point and leaned his elbows into his knees. He now dropped his head into his hands and scrubbed at it furiously. Like the motion would make things fall into place. Perhaps they already had. But what if he was wrong? If Beth was wrong? Draco wouldn’t survive this time, he thought. If it was all his one sided yearning after all these years and Harry found out… Draco didn’t want to think about what would happen then. He’d rather they go back to simply distant coworkers than that. At least then he could still look Harry in the eyes. But something traitorous in his chest told him he wouldn’t survive that either. That one was just a slow poison, a cowards way out.
Draco had recovered by then and spoke up, “And as your hosts it wouldn’t be proper for us to throw you out into this storm. Please.”
“Exactly why we should wait for reinforcements!” Draco hissed.
“I’m going to do some recon. See you tonight, yeah?”
“How do you know?”
“A set date night?” Malfoy looked at him quizzically.
Draco suddenly wrenched his hands free but didn’t take off. He was a Slytherin and he could be determined too. He straightened his posture and tilted his head at the other man, “Whatever you say, Harry. Let's just get back to the case.”
Draco flushed as two feminine voices cooed in unison , “Awww!”
Draco huffed, “Showing you the proper way to sort your attire obviously; since no one else is going to teach you how. You cannot just leave your suits in a pile or they’ll wrinkle and your shirts and ascots honestly it’s not difficult to sort them into a folded pile either.”
“Well excuse me potter if I have boundaries. We may have to convince people we’re dating but we should still have rules about how far we are each comfortable going to do so.”
Yet before he could make for the exit a gentle weight landed on his bicep and Harry looked up to find Ollivander smiling gently at him. Sadly, even. As if he understood without Harry finishing the question.
“Salazar, but you are thick!” Draco gripped Harry's collar tighter and brought his face so close they were nearly touching as he said it. Harry’s eyes roamed the other man’s face and Malfoy quirked a brow, “Do you have more questions?”
“I know you damn well, Draco Malfoy. I know what you were like in school and I know what you’re like now. You act so arrogant but really the type who never gets enough sleep because you’re always working. I know you have to make a mess of your files and papers to see the big picture. I know you shower late; probably because you are trying to wash the day away. I know you take your tea with little sugar and milk because you actually enjoy a bitter brew. I know sweet foods make your face twist in disgust. I know that you put on this act of being a haughty Malfoy, but I know how deeply things actually feel everything so deeply. I know you’re scared we won’t catch this guy and all these deaths will be left in vain. I know you. So don’t go taking your frustrations out on me.”
It was Malfoy’s turn to snort at the mature reply and despite his anger at Malfoy’s comment he was strangely happy to hear such an undignified sound coming from the man next to him. Impulsively, as gryffindors are known to be (and perhaps taking a bit of courage he wouldn’t admit to needing), Harry reached over and pulled Malfoy into the middle of the bed, oddly happy at the affronted squeak the leaner man let out. Something inside him wanted to linger there but Harry withdrew his arm all the same.
“Which is exactly why we need to-”
“How’s it?” Beth asked with a hint of nervousness from where she sat across the table. Draco might have made visiting her café into part of the weekly routine he’d settled into; but who could blame him really? Beth seemed to know a lot about what was going on around town from talking to customers and as an added bonus also happened to be an amazing baker who wanted opinions on her newest recipes before adding them to the menu. Draco had just enjoyed one of the best scones of his life and told her as much. Her relief was clear and her laugh loud and triumphant, “Honestly, that’s so good to hear. Scones have really never been my specialty.”
“She shouldn’t have gone alone. She knew the risks. She knew what this wizard is capable of but she went without me anyway. What was so important? Why couldn’t she just come get me? Foolish old woman! Why couldn’t she just trust me? I would have helped her; I trusted her!”
Draco’s face was well and truly burning. He thinks vaguely there may even be a ringing in his ears but all he can do is process and reprocess Beth’s words. Luckily the girl at the counter calls out to her before he has to form a reply and she bids him a bemused goodbye.
They stay like that for who knows how long as neither dared to break the moment’s silence. As if there was a spell holding them together and a single word could shatter it. Yet, Harry does let go eventually, just enough to look Draco in the eyes. For Draco to see the desperation and concern in his eyes. He needed Draco to understand even if he wasn’t willing to admit why it matters so much to him that he does.
The sofa wasn't as uncomfortable as it looked, and Harry had definitely slept in worse places. He only wished he'd gotten as lucky with his new attire; Draco had scoffed at Harry's first outfit attempt and refused to leave the building until Harry put on something that didn't look "as if it had been randomly selected by a blind house elf". While the slacks, collared shirt and vest were comfortable enough Harry really didn't understand the importance of an ascot and didn't really want to bother figuring it out just yet anyway. Looking over at Malfoy as he ordered for them both while Harry found a table in the cafe, he couldn't help but be envious. The sweater he wore while slightly oversized looked ridiculously soft. Cashmere probably. And he got to wear jeans! Really well-fitted jeans he noticed before turning away with a cough when the man in question glanced back at him. This cafe has really interesting tablecloths.
Then the front door opened to reveal a dirt covered Harry Potter.
After everyone was full and dressed for the day they waved goodbye to their guests and walked back up to their apartment, where they cleaned up in companionable silence. Neither man yet knowing how or if they should address what happened the night before. Draco had had his fair share of nightmares since the war. He wouldn’t push the topic unless Potter brought it up. But he didn’t. And things went about almost as normal; each returning to their usual routines. Potter left for a patrol around noon and Draco found himself staring out the apartment window long after Potter’s form had disappeared.
It’s a Saturday but for aurors undercover weekend breaks aren’t a thing. So they fall back into the routine of dancing around each other as they get ready for the day. Well, perhaps dancing “around each other” isn’t as fitting a term anymore for their practiced routine. It’s more a duet than avoidance. It’s comfortable in a way it wasn’t before, with everything between them out in the open. It should have been awkward, a relationship so freshly acknowledged yet it was anything but. Perhaps they owed that ease to being partners or perhaps after ten years of knowing one another this was just another step in their relationship. Whatever the case they worked smoothly together despite the change.
Draco’s sense of peace immediately fled him and the turmoil that had plagued him returned in force. Dropping his gaze from hers he worried his bottom lip with his teeth before answering unconvincingly even to his own ears, “It’s nothing really.”
As if that would clear his thoughts.
“Well if you’ll pardon us I heard tell of new scones and I’m sure a little snack before dinner wouldn’t hurt.” Anne winked and began tugging her fiancee toward the counter with her, “It was nice meeting you!”
“I swear to Merlin if you say you haven’t avoided me even during our briefings I’m going to jinx you.”
Hurt/comfort and some holiday fluff
The little bird then proceeded to catch fire and fall away as ash. An untraceable message, the kind Harry had received before during his time with the Aurors; but this message had clearly been for Malfoy. Malfoy whose face had gone as ashen as the bird, jaw tight and expression unreadable as his hand and gaze still hovered where the bird had been.
Harry stopped reading, turning his gaze back to Malfoy who looked ready to snap the quill he held so tightly.
“Want me to go?”
He swung back the way he came, pressing himself against a dingy brick wall and not a moment too soon as a curse whirred past the spot he’d just been standing. Not good. He sprinted for the nearest cover he could find, not even caring in the moment that the only cover was a filthy industrial garbage bin. A wizard came cautiously around the corner- from the dead end that he now knew had been a glamour. An advanced one. Hastily constructed as evidenced by the lack of detail he’d seen. He knew had been too pristine. But that really wasn’t his greatest concern at the moment as the man scanned the alley with slow hawk like focus, wand raised. The man looked quite like Anne had described. A thin white late-middle age man with dark eyes. Long pieces of brown hair had escaped from the man’s hooded grey cloak and his nose was distinctly broken looking as if from an old injury never properly healed.
Harry almost laughed unsure if Malfoy, Malfoy of all people, had actually just made a joke. At his lack of reaction Draco just rolled his eyes, grabbing Harry’s hand in his to drag him into their next stop.
“Just wait till we break the news to my friends.”
At the same time he sees a grey form turn down a corner a ways ahead of him his previously dormant sensor spell sends warning sparks along his arm. Only residual dark magic would have caused that. So, wand at the ready just in case, he pulled his hooded robes tighter around himself and sped up to see if the magic had originated from the same figure that had turned down this alley. It was a dead end. And there was no one in sight. Yet the increased prickling along his arm warned he was closer than ever to a source of dark magic. He took a step forward. The alleyway was empty, almost pristine from the light layering of snow that coated everything. Undisturbed snow. Where were the footprints of the person who’d turned down this way? Unease tickled at his spine as he looked up again at where the alley ended abruptly. There were no doors or windows in sight, just towering brick walls on all sides that hadn’t even been touched by graffiti.
Ollivander is wise and our boys? Not so much...
“Just showing you there's no hexes. Now relax already.”
“Yes, opened two years ago. I’ve always been a baker and well this was the area closest to St.Mungos where I could set up shop, and we’ve a nice little apartment above it. My financee is a healer so we needed somewhere convenient for us both. Though I must admit I definitely got the easier commute to work.”
“Dropping in the resupply?”
Draco spelled on the gramophone to christmas music and spent the next hour digging up old spells from his memories of childhood holidays, spinning braided silver and gold tinsel along the walls and ceiling. Adding pops of green in the form of lush garlands over the doors and windows.. He may have added an extra sparkle to them but then it was the holidays. Spun a wreath of holly on the outside of their apartment door. Added a few bells and stars. Was just finishing a bloom of holly over the window and humming along to a Weird Sisters cover of Jingle Bell Rock when he heard the door open and turned to greet Potter.
They had finally made it back to their place and put on the kettle when a knock sounded at their door. Malfoy stiffened immediately and Harry had his wand in hand ready to approach the door before he’d made a conscious decision to do so. Malfoy, however, stepped in his way and waved him aside pointing to the small kitchen. Harry took a defensive position just out of sight as Malfoy peeked through the keyhole. And snorted.
“I’ve not-” Malfoy began, but harry cut him off,
Harry could feel his nails digging into his palms from how tensely he fisted his hands. He could feel his blood still boiling and the heavy weight of guilt pressing upon his shoulders and chest. Malfoy was staring him down, glamour faded and sharp grey eyes a storm. A storm that just challenged him to break through it. He felt it’s hold on him. Malfoy’s eyes, his face, was suddenly the only thing he could focus on, and so he moved to be just as in the other man’s face,
Pale grey eyes simply blink at him for a moment, as if processing all he just said before Draco speaks and when he does his voice is even but only just, “You really are an idiot if you think I don’t feel the same.”
Harry’s not sure how long he holds onto Malfoy for, eyes squeezed shut and letting out a breath of relief. Eventually Draco raised his arms to circle around Harry as well and Harry doesn't want to let go. Doesn’t want to end the embrace. Malfoy was here and alright and a warm solid presence in his arms. Harry felt his breathing return to normal- his heart once again beating if a bit wildly.
Draco takes a gamble
Olivander blinked at him in silent consideration before replying, “You don’t.”
Malfoy stopped whatever he had been saying and jerked his shoulder free from Harry’s grasp. Glare now reaffixed to his face, “It was worth the risk of exposure- I’m this close to isolating his magical signature with the spell I’ve been working on!”
The voice was oh so familiar and panicked and Voldemort disappeared with a snap and then Draco opened his eyes to darkness and lashed out wildly with his arms. By the time he'd come to the realization of where he was and who was beside him he was sure Potter would be sporting a bruise from at least one of his crazed blows. Yet, as the other man stared back at him there was no anger or irritation. Just the same panicked concern he'd felt come through even in his dream.
“No,” Harry ground out, staring deeply into Malfoys turbulent grey eyes, “not until you stop ignoring me. We can’t work together and solve this if you refuse to work together at all!”
"Yes?"
Beth’s smile and words took on a slightly more somber note as she replied,
Harry hummed in encouragement, placing a hand on Malfoy's shoulder and rubbing in circles as he’d done the night before for him. Malfoy shuddered but didn’t pull away, rambling on,
Malfoy’s stormy eyes narrowed and he scoffed,
“Salazar but you are thick! What do you want from me? Do you want me to hex you? Do you want me to cry? To complain to you? To curse the world and everyone in it? What do you want from me?”
The apartment was a one bedroom flat with a mix of white walls and exposed brickwork. The door opened into a small kitchen with a living area beyond it that consisted of a little round table with two chairs, a large dark wood cabinet in against one wall, a single antique looking loveseat next to it, on the opposite wall a chess set and chairs. The further wall held a tiny balcony beyond old glass doors and next to that a fireplace. Not one big enough to floo in but possibly to send messages and at the very least keep the place warm. The bedroom was similarly made up of dark wood furnishings but the bed, dresser and wardrobe were all clearly modern. Harry's chest floated to the end of the bed with a thunk, since that was as good a place as any. Malfoy let his drop in front of the cabinet and placed his hands on his hips. What complaint could he possibly have so soon? Malfoy scanned the room before turning back to Harry, "Well I'm not taking the sofa."
Harry sighed, learning back in his chair and to rub his hands over his face. He needed a shave.
Several appartations for safety's sake later and they were on the steps of St.Mungo’s. The witch, as she’d informed them she would, went ahead first and disappeared into the waiting area so they could go into reception without her. A harried looking older wizard manned the desk in jarringly cheery blue scrubs with little yellow ducks dotting them. The ducks wore little white sailor hats. The wizard wore a frown and a nametag that read, “Garrett, Leo”.
“I am trying to maintain some facade of normalcy you know, not wallow in my worry and all that. If you need an ear, well I don’t mind. You’ve been here for us.”
Harry woke with a grunt, his eyes felt leaden and sandy so he reached a hand up to rub at them before attempting to sit up, only to be stopped by a tutting Hermione’s gentle hand,
“Sit down, Potter. You’ll wear a hole in the floor.”
Angst, fluff, and the plot thickens
“‘Mione and Ron had matches and the other was always coming to me to practice when they lost. You?”
Harry was about to reply but immediately forgot with what words as she cut him off with a crooked smile, “Don’t even try to bullshit me; I can see you’re feeling the same for him. I see the love and fear in your eyes too. I’m sure we’ll all be fine, the Aurors told us they've dedicated extra people to catching him."
And as he looked into those weary green eyes and took in the smudged and bloodied appearance of his partner he knew he was right. Tactically. Everything in Draco screamed at him not to leave Harry but it was a plan that made sense and the only plan they really had at the moment. He didn’t know how long he’d last on his own against their attacker. So he nodded. He nodded once in grim determination and Harry nodded back as if they didn’t even need words to communicate the understanding that passed between them. Draco waited until the end of the next flurry of attacks before he made his move.
Done with sorting his own more relaxed attire but still full of pent up frustration Draco turned his wand to Potter’s mess, sorting the vests and suits onto hangers and neatly folding the shirts and sweaters.
What mattered was the suspect list they could narrow down using the description he now hung next to the map of London. The map of incidents that he now marked with another pin. A pin to represent each victim. One to represent Eldreda. Another now for Anne.
"So, are you guys ready to become someone else? Any questions about the glamour or secret keeping charm?"
“Naughty thoughts?” Anne guessed with a smirk. Draco nearly choked on air but recovered by dabbing a napkin at his mouth. Anne still seemed thoroughly amused. Draco lowered his voice to match her previous tone,
“Nghn”, was Draco’s only response and Harry couldn’t help the chuckle that escaped his lips at that,
“In the mood to celebrate another glorious victory, St.Potter?” Draco joked, in an attempt to bring Harry out of his reverie. And was rewarded with Harry’s smile and a roll of green eyes.
“Well, it's almost time for my next meeting I’m afraid. It’s been wonderful meeting you both, I do hope to see you again soon. You make such a charming couple.”
The bedroom he and Malfoy had to share now.
He really was infuriating. They’d bet dinner on who would win but as time passed and they realized the possibility of a draw it was decided that in this case they’d just share takeout. Two discarded cartons of pad thai later Draco was lounging on the office sofa reading through the most recent case file while Potter had spread out several folders pertaining to the case on the floor where he lay propped on his elbows and occasionally muttering under his breath. Draco was more irritated that he wasn’t irritated with it. Only Potter could make such an annoying trait into something... well less annoying. And when had it stopped annoying Draco exactly? While Draco was staring at the case file and zoning out Potter had apparently gotten up. He flopped gracelessly onto the sofa and leaning over Draco’s shoulder to look at the paper he was stuck on, “Any miraculous connections?” Potter’s breath was warm and ghosted across Draco’s cheek from proximity. Draco shivered, blaming the office for being cold. That’s all. He turned his head slightly to look at Potter and reply, “No, nothing new.”
What transpired next felt like an eternity but was likely no more than a few moments as the man scanned the alley before letting out a quiet curse, spitting, and turning on his heel to disparate. Draco didn’t hesitate to cast a modified tracking spell but knew the instant it impacted that it wouldn’t be of much use as it rippled off the disappearing form. He could only hope he’d tweaked the spell correctly.
On that note she disapparited with a wink, leaving Harry alone with Malfoy. The warehouse suddenly felt a lot quieter and when he turned to look at Malfoy he found him already looking at him with a strange expression on his new face. Though some of his sharp features seemed to be returning and as Harry looked, dark blue eyes shifted to a lighter grey. He wondered if this would happen every time they looked at eachother. Malfoy was the one who broke the silence, taking one end of the portkey Harry still held, with a challenging look, "Scared, Potter?"
Because he did in more ways than she could ever know. He understood what it was like to be looked at with disgust. What it was like to have to hide his feelings from society and his family. A gay Malfoy. A gay deatheater. He wasn’t sure if the fallout would be worse from his family or the public. He could never have a normal life. A boyfriend or a husband. So he neve said a word. Hardly acted on his feelings unless he’d never see the other bloke again. He knew what it was like to have to hide everything he was. But the sympathetic smile Beth gave him didn’t bother him as sympathy from others did. Because it was a look of understanding too. And Drcao only felt guilty for that. If she knew who he really was she’d never have been so open with him. He didn’t deserve it. And she had far more to lose if he and Potter didn’t catch this guy than he did. A facsimile of a relationship. It had gotten comfortable; working and living with Potter. Things had even become easier in public. The hand holding and little gestures and reaching out that Potter did. But he knew it was for show. Knew better than to get comfortable in it. He knew he’d never have what Beth and Anne had. He knew that. And it shouldn’t hurt because he’d resigned to those facts long ago. Yet the look she gave him was so accepting as well and he’d never felt more seen.
"As if you could lift me. Gained a little weight pretending to be a civilian, haven't you?"
Malfoy stomped out of their hidden office at that, cabinet door slamming behind him. Harry stood then too, having the presence of mind to vanish what was left of their meals before following after him. Perhaps it wasn’t the best idea to confront Malfoy right now but when had that ever stopped them before? Harry found him in the bedroom, angrilly gathering together his pajamas, stopping to glare when Harry entered the room,
Potter was in his usual sleeping attire, joggers and a shirt that looked older than he was. Draco vaguely wondered who or what "Ramones" referred to. Potter had made it all the way up to him and Draco hadn't even realized. He rubbed at his eyes again, irritatedly inquiring, "Something you need, Potter?"
As if on que the kettle started screaming and Draco had no choice but to get it while Potter turned back and instead of putting away the few remaining groceries he surprised Draco again by proceeding to get out several pots.
Beth laughed at his joke and Harry smiled, continuing their conversation from where they’d left off. Back to safer topics. Because while he’d externally regained his composure his thoughts clamored and clashed and it was all he could do not to start pacing the room. Because even though it was a fact that had been glaringly obvious since before Harry had even been assigned this case there was a real and ever present danger to being undercover. This psycho killed gays, targeting couples, and he and Draco posed as one. He knew this. And yet suddenly all he could think of was Draco lying in Anne's place or worse, in the place of one of the previous victims, mangled and left in an alleyway. Cruel words written in his blood. And for the first time in years Harry Potter felt well and truly afraid. All because he couldn’t stand the thought of Malfoy ending up with such a fate. And the implications behind those feelings terrified him even more.
Draco finished sorting Potter’s clothes and marched past him into the living room, pointing his wand at the wardrobe cabinet there, recalling the spell the unspeakable witch had taught them. The wood doors shuddered before creaking open and Draco stepped in. This was much better.
“You’re hurt!”
They were partner’s afterall. At least until this case ended. Of course Harry would be feeling the need to protect his partner. Malfoy had turned out to be relatively easy to live in work with at least; they hadn’t given into childish arguments more than twice. And looking after each other well that’s what auror partner’s did. Watched each other's backs. That Malfoy had a rather nice backside was a bonus. Aesthetically of course. It wasn’t like he actually was attracted to Malfoy of all people! Harry let go of Malfoy’s hand once they were a safe distance from the business.
“Uh huh,” Beth gave him a highly skeptical look, one thick brow arching so high it nearly disappeared under her messy bangs.
Draco let out an irritated ‘hmph’ and went back to the photos he’d enlarged and arranged on his desk. The victims clothes. He’d found something odd, something similar but he couldn’t quite place it. It was annoying. He pulled out the body photos again, forcing himself to compare the bodies and clothes. Cross them with the others. The spell wounds were of course the glaring similarity. But something else was tugging at his mind. He leaned back in his chair, trying to take in the big picture. There was blood, torn clothing, and… and something else on victim 1’s wrist. And victim 3’s collar. He flipped through 1’s file. Quidditch minor leaguer. Victim 3’s; nurse. He checked their respective fiances files. 2 had it on their cheek, easily missed if not looking for it. Ink on 1’s wrist. Ink of 2’s swollen cheek, perhaps from a punch. Ink on 3’s collar, evidence of strangulation on her neck was noted in her file. How had they missed this? It was a little detail but glared at him,
The spell was temporary but  hopefully long enough for backup to arrive.
The young woman, ‘Beth’ her name tag read, was still smiling, “He proposed to you then?”
Ollivander raised a pale eyebrow in question, so Harry elaborated,
Harry had come to a realization after bidding Draco goodnight and choosing to sleep on the sofa. He was, completely and utterly bollixed.
Draco wanted to hex someone, to hit something and resolutely was fighting against the hot tears he could feel threatening to spill behind his eyes. He couldn’t break down. Not now, not people were still depending on him to figure this out. Potter’s growl of frustration as he paced the small room brought him out of his own thoughts, turning to glare at the other man. Potter looked as angry as he felt and the furious pacing was clearly doing him no good. Draco dropped in his desk chair like a sack of bricks and muttered though his hands covering his face,
Draco protested but Harry drew himself up straight and his green eyes were laced with pain and determination as they bored into his,
The young woman let out an uncharacteristic sigh, “To be honest? Petrified.”
The kiss was heated, as if a decade of longing had turned to heat that smelted and fused their bodies together. Harry’s cloak was the first thing to go, left a crumpled mess on the floor by the apartment door. Next they were stumbling, Harry grunted when they hit the edge of their table but was quick to reattach his demanding lips on Draco’s as they fumbled their way to the bedroom. Apparently, Harry didn’t want to waste time with all the buttons his vest and shirt entailed because one moment he was wearing them the next he’d pulled himself from Draco’s lips long enough to mutter a wandless vanishing charm. Draco had only a moment to appreciate the sight of Harry’s warm toned chest before their lips met again, and Draco felt himself being pushed against the bedroom door. One of his hands had moved to feel the broad chest, sandwiched between them, the only other barrier between their skin other than Draco’s own sweater. His other hand had found its way into Harry’s hair, tugging it free of the bun as Harry fumbled to get the bedroom door open.
Something in Harry’s chest broke at that and before he knew it he’d pulled Malfoy into his arms, just holding him. After the initial shock Malfoy relaxed into his embrace, shuddering and Harry ignored the dampness soaking through his shirt where Malfoy burrowed his face into the crook of his neck and shoulder. He held him in silence for a moment, just rubbing circles on his back with one hand and holding him tight against him with the other. When he did speak his own voice felt hoarse,
Harry grabbed Draco’s hips firmer and stared into his eyes replying firmly with a shake of his head, “Harry.”
“Malfoy,” Harry began, but was cut off.
Just... a lot of feelings to unpack in this one
It was late when Harry got back to the apartment building. Later than he’d meant to stay out and the only light provided as he ascended the stairs was from narrow windows overlooking the street lit by magic oil lamps that lined the street below. There was no moon in the clear sky tonight, only stars and the lamps warm glow over the stark winter night. As if their miniscule light could ever hope to penetrate the cold cast as eternal as the snow and stars. It was futile. Yet still they remained aglow, shedding stubborn golden light on white streets.
Draco raised a brow, “Yes, well, something happened then?”
There were worse ways to wake than curled up against the wizarding world’s savior. That didn’t stop Draco’s eternal stream of curses as he disentangled himself from the other man though. When Harry woke he at least had the decency not to mention anything as they readied themselves for the day and checked both the weather and on their guests. It had stopped snowing at some point in the night, thank Merlin. The view outside their apartment window was of a little slice of wizarding london dusted in sparkling white. Yet already he could see witches and wizards working to clear the snow with charms. He even spotted a few of the neighborhood children casting snowballs at each other or building snowmen.
Harry comes to a sudden realization
“The guy’s name. You were right about it being the stationary store clerk; though he’s the owner as well apparently.”
Malfoy’s eyes were slits of ice and steel. This close he could see just how long his light lashes actually were, could really recognise the difference in their height. This close he could practically feel the anger and frustration radiating from the other man’s body like heat.
Harry huffed out a labored breath Draco was half sue was meant to be a laugh, “We don’t have time to argue this-”
They’d been standing so close and Harry had barely managed to hear Draco over the pounding of his heart. He was already trying to keep thoughts of moving closer to Draco out of his mind when they had been interrupted and in the end he acted, as he was wont to do, on his first impulse. He’d kissed Draco because he wanted to. He didn’t want their cover ruined but there were probably a hundred different things he could have done in that moment to cause a distraction. He laughed humorlessly at the thought that Hermione could probably give him the list alphabetized and in order of projected success. It was moments like these, moments when Harry felt so desperately alone, that he wished he could reach out to his friends for advice. Ron would be hilariously horrified that he’d locked lips with his former nemesis and Hermione would have probably figured out his feelings before he even did.
It was a gentler kiss than his earlier one, though still demanding. Still a question. But this time Harry was ready to reply, moving his lips against the other man’s with just as much passion. This time when they parted, Harry wasn’t the only one left breathless. His heart felt like it was going to beat out of his chest and he could only look back at Draco in awe. Draco huffed another laugh against his lips,
Ollivander looked at him with something twinkling in his pale eyes, before drawing out, “I’m sorry my boy, you’ve just missed him. Done for the day.”
He has to.
The scene he entered was drastically different from the one he’d left just a few minutes before. Malfoy had seemingly upended his trunk of clothing and was floating soft looking sweater after sweater from the pile before him into the closet with muttered comments on the color or style as he arranged them neatly next to Harry’s pile of clothes. His back was to Harry, who leaned against the doorway half amused until Draco suddenly started muttering,
Harry choked out a laugh at the sudden suggestion and Merlin, this man really may be the death of him.
Henry Varma. Apprentice wandmaker, most recently lived in Paris with boyfriend Damien Leclair an author/ghost writer. Moved to London for his new job. Or so the short cover story Harry was just handed says. The trunk full of collared shirts, vests and pressed pants all in tweed and check would indicate his usual go to wardrobe of old band shirts and jeans isn't going to be allowed on this mission. Just great. At least Malfoy looked just as displeased by the contents of his own trunk if the slight sneer on his face was any indication. Apparently the trunk wasn't filled with Malfoys usual tailored suits. Harry scanned his new partner's current attire wondering how expensive it was to get a suit that well fitting, because Malfoy for all his faults certainly didn't look bad.
His feet had barely touched solid ground again and his world still felt as if it was spinning as he took off toward the alley Harry’s patronus had stated. If that idiot- no he wasn’t going to think about anything but the pounding of his feet on pavement and making it to the alley. He could already hear spellfire being exchanged. It was still early morning and everything seemed shadowed and greyer than usual as he ran. As soon as he reached the opening of the alleyway he was yanked aside and whipped around to point his wand at his attacker only to find it was Harry who’d pulled him behind some crates and bins. One of the bins explodes before Draco could fully take Harry in. Singed rubbish falling in every direction  Draco cast a late shielding charm and Harry explained in a rush, “Has me pinned down. It was the bloody stationary store clerk of all-”
Auror Reele, Eldreda on the 15th of-
Which is why the missive on his desk was almost the last straw. Harry. Fucking. Potter. Of course they would give the golden boy HIS case. Robards expected them to work together? What a joke. If anything he'd probably told Potter to find any evidence of him being a dark wizard or something. Just great. Draco's forehead hit his cluttered desk with a thunk. This case just got a lot more complicated.
Harry searches Draco's eyes, a grey storm of emotion he can't read swirling in their depths - if Draco's eyes are a storm, his shoulders are the tether Harry clings to. A solid form in the uncertainty that now squashes his heart. Harry is simultaneously grateful and loathes the tangible distance of their arms. He doesn't know if he's brave enough to venture closer to that storm, he fears maybe it's only him that's being swept away.
"I-" he gulped around the sudden lump in his throat, "was it worth it?"
Harry let out a happy but nervous laugh and rolled his eyes,
“The magic is already there in the wood and the other materials used in crafting. If you understand the basic principles behind each various wood type and magical core then you can make an educated guess as to which properties will be complimentary. Or too dissimilar to work well together. You look for the properties ingrained rather than just choosing at a whim because you say ‘like the look’ of rosewood. I suppose it is similar to spells in that way; contradicting spells cannot be combined and create anything of power. Vice versa, things that are evenly matched rarely produce great magic. A lot like relationships that way, eh?”
He pushed his glasses up his nose. It felt odd, having had his old circular wire frames transfigured into a broader squared wood frame.
“Well, if it’s Weasly approved of course we should. Friday’s then.” Malfoy sneered and that expression made him decidedly less attractive. To anyone. Harry rolled his eyes as he added “friday date nights” to the list. He leaned his chin on his other palm, ignoring Malfoys sneering.
“Oh.” Harry knew he should feel happier about this, about having caught the man who’d hurt so many, who’d targeted a whole community out of nothing but bias and hatred, but all Harry felt was as if a long day of work was finally coming to an end. He was exhausted.
Harry raised a brow but quickly schooled his expression into a smile, “If you say so darling, but we really should be going soon. You know how my cousin gets when kept waiting.”
“Five more mins,” Draco mumbled shifting to bury his face in the pillow. Harry shook his head but felt a warmth spread through him at Draco’s antics. It was a side of him he’d only just barely glimpsed before. The thought that this could become a regular thing only made what was probably already an incredibly sappy grin grow larger on his face. He pecked Draco’s smooth shoulder,
Twenty minutes later, Harry had spelled the trail of yesterday's clothes into the laundry, attempted Draco’s french pressed coffee and he’s humming happily while plating their french toast when he hears Draco finally leaves the bedroom. He turns and for a minute Draco just stares across the tiny apartment at him with an impossibly fond look. Harry is glad he already had one hand on the counter or he might have had to brace himself since his knees suddenly had gone weak.
“What I want is for you to trust me. What I want is for you to let go of whatever childish animosity you’re clinging to between us and just trust me.”
The two women exchanged a glance and Beth nodded both saying grateful words Harry shook his head at saying, “Not at all.” It wasn’t until they were once again inside the apartment that Draco realized a glaring problem. They only had one bed.
Startled, Draco coughed, “Oh! Congratulations as well, and no not very long it was.. a sudden thing. Our engagement.”
Friday arrived and things were still tense between them. Harry felt like he was walking on glass around Malfoy, unsure if he even had the right to break the silence that had grown between them like a wall. Perhaps things were better this way. He and Malfoy didn’t need to be friends to work together. Even if the thought sent an unfamiliar twist to his heart. Friends; is that what they’d become during this investigation? He thought of how easy things had become between them, even their insults had felt like they were said less with animosity behind the words but more a feeling of… inevitability? No… more like, an almost comfortable familiarity. Their new normal. And now things had grown cold between them again Harry realized for the first time that perhaps, just perhaps, that he didn’t want things to go back to the way they were before. Whatever it was that had grown between them, Harry wasn’t ready to give up just yet. The stubbornness of a Gryffindor. He took off early from Ollivander’s but the old man did not protest. He just gave Harry a raised brow and knowing smile. What it was he thought he knew Harry didn’t but felt his face heat up all the same. Lingering even as he stepped out into the chill snow dusted streets.
“Bugger off, just because you don’t think there's anything for it doesn’t mean I shouldn't have been more cautious. I mean, Anne was targeted so that means Beth is in danger too. I should have noticed someone was stalking them, but I didn’t! We haven’t checked their cafe for spells since the first sweep because they are so nice! They’re exactly the kind of people he targets yet I didn’t think to do anything to protect them. I should have set up wards, done sweeps, or something!”
Draco nodded and had to remind himself he’d been heading to the kitchen instead of replying with something stupid. Like, “I thought you were a morning shower person?”. But really what kind of question was that? It’s not like he cared enough to notice. Maybe he needed to sleep worse than he thought? He put on a pot of Chamomile instead of his usual blend in the decision to just start up again bright and early. Scanned the books that had been on the shelf when they’d moved in and ended up settling down with his tea and the quidditch magazine Potter had been reading, because why not? It’s not like he was going back into the bedroom until Potter had finished his shower and changed after all.
“Ink?” He asked, turning his head toward Draco and he was far too close. His chest was warm and solid where he leaned over Draco’s shoulder. Draco could feel him breathing. He blinked away the sensation it caused before purposefully rolling his eyes, forcing his voice out, “Yes, ink, Potter. Surely you’re familiar with it.”
Potter let out a long huff and rubbed his scarred hand over his face. Draco was glad for once he hadn’t had to do the majority of the interview. Funny, when with every other partner interviews felt like a battle for dominance. With Potter it hadn’t been that way. It hadn’t felt like he’d beaten him to something by leading the interview. It felt considerate; almost kind. He recalled the look they’d exchanged and wondered just when it was he came to trust Potter so much to let him take over like that. Had they always understood each other so well? No. Probably the opposite.
“Yes, well,” Draco began, watching Potter’s progress around the room, “seems we had similar ideas if your patrol ended with bringing that home.”
"This portkey will activate in exactly two minutes. I hope you find your new apartment suitable; I picked it out myself for obvious security reasons. Good luck, Aurors. I truly mean that. This cretin has taken enough lives and I have a lovely girlfriend I'd like to propose to someday soon."
“I think she’ll be fine with it - considering I’m my own boss.”
Today had been a desk day meaning he spent his time engaging customers in small talk, being sure to announce his upcoming nuptials to another man to gauge their reactions, and reviewing cursework books to try and piece together how exactly the victims were killed. It turns out wand shops weren’t particularly busy this time of the year. Which left him loads of time to deliberate on the case. How had the killer gotten his victims alone? The imperious curse was obviously likely. But the unidentified spell that actually killed the victims? That was a question that only created more; why a new spell? Why not a standard curse? And whatever the spell was it didn't just kill - it did much worse to the victims in the process.
“Really, we don’t want to impose. You’ve already given us such a lovely evening.”
"Okay."
Harry let out a disbelieving huff, “Exposure? You could have been killed! He could recognize your glamour now! What the hell were you thinking? How could you be so damn reckless?!”
“Can I kiss you again?”
“Tell you what, for a kiss I’ll even make us breakfast.”
“Nope. We can’t let you out in those conditions. Apparating out there would be dangerous and that snow doesn't seem to be going anywhere.”
And it was selfish, incredibly so, to ask that of Ollivander who had lost that other half of his soul. But the kindly old mans eyes held only warmth when he replied in a whisper thick with emotion,
Draco thanked him and managed a polite farewell. If Harry had already left then he was probably headed to the apartment. Draco could have apparated there but he needed the time and the cold wind to help him think. What was he going to say exactly? He couldn’t just rush in without a plan- that was so gryffindor! Damn Potter must be rubbing off on him. No, he needed a plan. What to say. How to test the waters before the conversation got to far for recovery if he was wrong. Draco had worked out a rough draft by the time he stood outside their door, and taking a steadying breath he entered.
“It doesn’t bloody well matter!” Malfoy shouted, some emotion coming back into his expression and voice. Rage, “I told her not to follow up on any lead alone and she still went, it was not my fault and I’ll not have anyone blaming me for more deaths. Now, if you’ll excuse me I have a patrol to get to.”
Potter could cook? He was going to make them dinner?
Harry nodded walking forward as the witch pulled out her wand. It felt like cold water washed over him as the spell faded away. Which was just as well as they needed to be alert as possible without the glamours. No one needed to see Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy exit this building. He pulled on the familiar robes and made sure the hood sat low on his face before turning back to the witch. Malfoy was doing up his own robes when she spoke again, “Right then. I’ll see if the coast is clear and then you follow and we’ll apparate, good?”
Potter almost dropped the kettle at that but began making the tea and ignoring his own little mishap, “Er- no not really. Just busy. Talked to Olivander.”
“I’m sorry as well.” Harry added, scratching his neck in nervous habit.
“You own this Café?”
“How is she?”
The other man let out a loud put upon huff and shook his head. Suddenly his face lit up with what could only be described as an evil smirk,
Harry pressed his head to the door Draco had closed firmly between them and let out a shuddering breath. All his senses screamed at him to move, to pace, to confront this, to find whatever was causing his chest to feel like a cave-in and fix it. But he couldn’t do anything to fix what he’d done tonight. He’d crossed a line in their tentative friendship and Draco had made his opinion on the kiss fairly clear. He was disguised. Harry felt disgusted by himself as well, he didn’t even know if Draco liked blokes and he’d forced a kiss on him. He hadn’t even asked. Didn’t check to see if such a thing would be alright with the other man.
“Now that is the dopiest expression I’ve seen on you yet,” Beth’s comment was followed by a throaty chuckle to show she’d meant no harm. Draco had been so lost in thought he hadn’t heard her approach. He cleared his throat, steadfastly ignoring the heat that he was sure flushed his cheeks,
He couldn't know that on the other side of the door a similar breakdown was occurring.
Olivander didn’t laugh at him but his eyes twinkled with mirth all the same, “Something on your mind?”
Once back at their apartment he got down to prepping for tonight's meal. He set the little table, pulling the other two chairs from their chess table and mentally going over the recipes he planned to use. Massor Dal to start, an easy enough lentil soup he often made for himself when the weather was gloomy. Tarte flambée, a sort of thin pizza he’d tried once with Hermione and then spent weeks attempting to recreate. And for desert of course his favorite food, one of the very first things he learned to make when he had a place of his own; treacle tart.
Something in Draco's expression falls before returning to his usual sardonic mask and he nods.
Furious knocking set both undercover Auror’s on edge and Harry was the first to the door; not at all relieved at who he saw through the peephole. The unspeakable witch wore some her cloak pulled tight over her head but enough of her face showed that Harry hastily opened the door and let her in. Before he could speak, before he could even really form a question in his mind, she announced, “There’s been another attack. Victim ran out on the corner of 15th and Crescent street, aurors have located and are processing the crime scene as we speak. I’m to de-glamour you and bring you into St.Mungo’s soon as the witch regains consciousness. Here, spare auror robes.” At that she hefted an innocuous cloth bag from her cloak and held it out.
Harry went to speak again but Malfoy held up a hand,“No, Potter. I don’t want your sympathies. Or accusations. Whichever it may be.”
Draco opened his mouth to argue but was cut off once again by Potter,
He was interrupted by a spell breaking Draco’s hastily cast shielding charm. Draco threw up another without hesitation after Harry had managed to fire back a spell of his own.
To nothing. After a quick inspection he realized Harry wasn’t yet back and so he puts on a pot of tea and prepares. He drinks his tea and waits.
He proceeded to sit primly on the edge of the bed and stare at Harry pointedly, who for his part was confused, "What?"
Harry glared from where he leaned against the bathroom door frame, arms crossed, “Well Malfoy, maybe be more careful next time because I’ve had a long day and I’m getting in the shower now.”
Potter stood just to resume his pacing. Draco went back to staring at the ceiling, not really seeing it. Instead he saw Anne; bruised and bandaged where the healing spells refused to take. Long dark hair a mess, voice hoarse, and so very pale. Her usual tan gone ashen. Every word out of her mouth laced with pain as she described her attacker: white male, late-middle age, wiry build, dark eyes, seemed to rely on his left side when they fought. She couldn’t make out the exact eye and hair color between the darkness, the man’s hooded cloak, and sidedness of the attack. He had a rough nasally voice though. That much she remembered as clear as the words he’d said when he grabbed her, “Filth you’re going to repent! You vile carpet muncher, I’ll show you what’s in store for sinners!”
“Henry” had a shift at Olivander’s that day and so Harry didn’t make it back to the little apartment until near dinner time. He did a quick sweep of the apartment block before entering just in case. After what happened to Anne he felt a bit of paranoia was not only justified but warranted. Even when he found nothing the tension remained in his shoulders all the way into their little apartment. Even the sound of Draco humming happily drifting from the open cabinet didn’t lessen the tension. Harry shook his head as he locked up, Draco really should be more careful to keep their office hidden. After hanging his robe and casting a quick cleansing spell over his muddied boots he headed for the office to see what had Draco in such a pleasant mood.
“And Henry.” Beth added. It wasn’t a question.
Draco winced and it was enough to stir Harry, “Whutzat?”
There was a hint of challenge in that and Draco snorted, an undignified noise only Potter seemed to draw from him, drawling,
Malfoy groaned and stood, getting far too close and speaking in a very pointed way, “You couldn’t have protected them. If we’d warded them in any way we might as well throw off our glamours and announce to the world aurors are here! I want to catch this bastard and keep people safe just as badly as you do. I’m just as responsible for what’s happened to Anne. Which is why we cannot rush in and be stupid about this. Look past your bloody hero-complex for a moment and think, Potter!”
Then he did turn to face him and Draco wished he hadn’t. Potter’s easy smile set things fluttering in his stomach and caused his heart and throat to clench. Draco was suddenly hit by just how much he missed this casual side of him.
Lying to his friends and the Weasleys that he was going on an assignment out of the county went about as well as he expected. Molly cried and made him give her the exact date so she could send him food and Hermione didn't buy his story one bit. How could he tell? Well, her flooing back with him to Grimmauld Place was a hint. Her placing her hands on her hips and staring him down with her best disappointed McGonagall impression was another,
He sighed again, this time gentler as his shoulders sagged forward and his brow scrunched in thought,
But it didn’t matter. What mattered was the case they were working and that the bastard had gotten away. Again.
“Yup,” The witch popped the p and continued, “dunno how, but glad she did all the same. Heard from an informant she was at St.Mungos and stabilized. Consulted Robards and then came straight for you two. Can’t have you interview her in your civie glamour.”
“Oh no you don’t. Lay back, you’re still healing.”
Malfoy huffed, stepping closer to hiss, “Really? Can’t you take a fucking hint? I want to be alone! So get out!”
Harry would take as much or as little as Draco wished to share with him, but he didn’t know if he could ever go back to ignoring each other.
"Oh- is that what's happening?"
“I suppose we also owe you a thank you.”
Coming out from behind his impromptu shelter he reached the spot the man had vanished from and examined the snow muddied ground. Draco bent to pick up a simple wooden button, wiping grime from it with a handkerchief he pulled from his own pocket. His tracking spell may have bounced off the man but not without making the impact Draco had hoping for. It was a risk and one he couldn’t even be sure would pan out as he’d not attempted the spell before - yet it had worked. Draco felt a swell of triumph in his chest. The impact of his spell had knocked this button loose, just as he’d hoped it would. Now they’d just have to hope the cloak had belonged to the man long enough to leave a trace of his person behind on it.
“Oh, good your back! Don’t just bloody stand there; come look at this!”
For months he'd been carrying the little box in his pocket, trying to plan the perfect date but he suddenly felt that some over the top date night wouldn't fit them at all. Not for the question he was burning to ask. No, this simple moment together would be much sweeter a memory. And so before his nerves could talk him out of it Draco Malfoy moved to kneel behind Harry Potter.
Draco blinked, looking up from his latte and realizing that his face had in fact twisted into an ugly expression. He forced it to relax before he replied, “No, nothing like that really.”
“I tried out a modified tracking spell; the intended effect being that if it couldn't stick to the person that it would have enough impact to dislodge something on their person,” he then picked up the button and held it up for Harry to better see, “and look! It worked!”
Draco’s eyes twinkled with laughter but his serious tone remained, “Scared, Harry?”
Harry wasn't dumb, though he knew he could be dense sometimes, and after tonight he really struggled not to come to this realization. That he's in love. With Draco. He's in love with Draco Malfoy. Even acknowledging it his own thoughts made Harry feel all jumbled up inside.
“I-” Draco started then huffed, rubbing his hands over his eyes as if to clear away the mess in his mind, admitting, “We just had a row.”
“That obvious?” Draco sighed, dropping his head into his hands briefly to rub some of the exhaustion and whatever else from his expression. When he looked back up Beth was still smiling gently at him,
Anne just rolled her eyes with a smile but Beth now smiled at them too and said,
“I don’t know. I can’t speak for her. But I do know this. I know you, Draco Malfoy, and I trust you.”
He hopes it does at least.
Robards informing him of the new parameters of the mission only added more complications but he was in no position to argue with a direct order. It would be the end of his career and he wasn't going to let anyone railroad him into being fired in disgrace. He wasn't going to let that happen. He'd solve this case no matter what. Even if it meant working with Potter.
“Are you insane?”
“Damien Leclair,” Draco carefully took the offered bag from her, stepping aside, “Thank you, Ms.Hobkins would you like to come in? My fiance Henry has just put the tea on.”
“You know, all great things come with risk Mr.Varma. It depends on the wizard whether that great thing becomes an opportunity lost or an experience gained.”
Harry frowned but looked at their hands still held on the table, Draco hadn’t pulled away despite his words,
“Your turn,” was all he said before tossing his day clothes in a hamper and picking up a book from the nightstand. Knowing it was worthless to talk before Malfoy was good and ready Harry headed to the bathroom with a sigh, quickly showering and changing into an old pair of joggers.
He was glad he and Ginny were able to be friends after their relationship ended, just months after the war. Neither had wanted to let the other go but it wasn't love. Not the romantic kind anyway. He'd always be fond of her but in the same way he was fond of Ron. Like family. The Weaslys would always be family to him, because they cared for him in a way his own blood relatives would not. Had taken a scrawny wreck of a kid and treated him like one of their own. Shown him kindness and love really existed in the world. For that he would forever be grateful.
“Darling at least is dignified. But what should I call you?” Malfoy hummed, as if actually giving it some thought, “Something french perhaps as Damien is French. Branleur? Trou de cul?”
“There's a difference between insults and pet names, Malfoy. But,” And he was reluctant to admit it, “we probably should. Honey.”
Harry moved to transfigure the loveseat into a double bed immediately as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Shrunk the soft leather backing into a headboard, the bottom half elongating, cushions fusing into a soft mattress, decorative pillows stretched into more suitable ones.
When Harry opened his eyes again he lifted his own hand to cup Draco’s cheek, eyes searching,
Draco was somewhat self satisfied with the way Potter’s face turned red and he sputtered into his tea. Draco elaborated, “Things like holding hands, Potter.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Not honey then, “Sweetie? Hun? Babe? Darling?” Harry threw out as Malfoy wrinkled his nose.
Harry didn't know what to say to that, could only gape at the older man for a moment before finding his voice in a whisper,
“I’ve removed the charms i place on you but the medi witches need to get him to St.Mungos. Now.”
Malfoy stomped toward the door and Harry followed, catching the other man’s hand, “Malfoy, look at me.” He tried to pull away but Harry held onto his hand tight, “No one is going to blame you for her actions. And you’re allowed to grieve her. I know you were partners for a long while.”
Something flashed in Malfoy's eyes at that that Harry didn't catch before Malfoy let out a huff and said in the most sarcastically Malfoy way,
Neither really commented on the shift in their routine. After another night bout of nightmares from each man they simply took to sharing the bed. The comfort of another body beside them. It was nothing more than that - or so Draco willed himself to believe as the week passed. They’d made a little progress narrowing down their search area and suspect list. Draco knew there was no way to speed up the process without another incident, and he did not want that, yet it was still difficult for him that things progressed so slow. Apparently Potter felt the same, if the nearly doubled amount of patrols he took was any indication. Outside of meals and working late into the evenings they barely saw one another. Their conversations which had begun to flow so easily were now non-existent. He felt a twinge of guilt for wishing things could go back to how they’d been before Anne was attacked, he knew that was selfish. They should have been more focused on the case even then. It was foolish to get caught up in anything else. There wasn’t even technically anything to get distracted by - they were just two aurors working a case. Nothing more.
The woman could easily be his grandmother. Or his grandmother’s grandmother by how frail she seemed. She smiled up at him and raised a plain brown bag he hadn’t noticed before with deceptive strength, “Hullo, neighbor. I saw the pair of you leaving this morning and realized I must have missed the move last night - I do turn in rather early these days. I just wanted to welcome you and introduce myself, Melinda Hobkins. I’m next door.”
“Ah, just a moment!” Potter placed a hand to his shoulder before running back to the kitchen to retrieve something from a cabinet, leaving a very bewildered Draco just standing there. Before he could even ask what it was about Potter had come back into sight, carrying a bouquet of Narcissa and Green Daylily flowers in a simple vase. He gave Draco a lopsided grin, obviously pleased by his stunned reaction,
“You-” Harry started but Malfoy cut him off.
“I said, ‘Sod off.’ Or are you deaf as well as dumb, Potter?”
When Draco arrived back he was met at the door with faint music playing from the Gramophone in the bedroom and something truly delicious smelling wafting through the air. He knew Harry had made some sort of pie the night before but he hadn’t bothered asking what he was going to make their guests for dinner. Potter must have heard him come in and yet he kept his back turned, humming along to the music and stirring a pot of something. His stance was relaxed, hips swaying ever so slightly to the tune and Draco may have pause a moment longer than necessary while taking off his coat. It wasn’t a bad sight. But after the tense atmosphere of the past few days it was certainly a sudden change. The tea pot whistled and Potter moved it from the burner without turning to look at him. Pouring it into already prepared mugs.
Harry blanched and Draco laughed, shaking his head and released his hand only to come to sit beside him on the hospital bed. Shoulder to shoulder before Draco wrapped an arm around Harry and helped him to sit up against his chest. They just stayed like that for a moment in silence, taking in the fat that after months of work it was finally over. They’d caught him. And Harry was happy they did! But with a pang of guilt he also was sad that it meant their little apartment and life there was at an end as well. No more Damien and Henry. He wondered if someone was already clearing the apartment or if they’d have to go pack up their things and take down the decorations themselves.
Finally, finally, he came close to the alleyway again and crouched to make his way painstakingly slowly and quietly to the entrance. They were in between bouts of spellfire again. Draco held his wand steady in front of him. He couldn’t fail. He wouldn’t.
Malfoy had taken a seat in one of the desk chairs and Harry followed suit, taking the other,
And a few minutes, and only one further argument later they’d moved the chess set and placed the tree. Potter was right, though Draco would never admit it, the tree did look much better once returned to its normal size; The scent of evergreen washing over them as the tree magically became lush and tall. Potter immediately started spinning red and gold garlands over it and Draco scoffed, immediately transfiguring the other man’s work to a more fitting green and gold. Potter mouth fell open and he sputtered, “Merlin, the tree is already green! Those colors make no sense.”
It was going to be a tense afternoon tea.
And there was a hint of something in that dark gaze Draco didn’t quite understand, couldn’t yet comprehend, something that compelled him to nod and take Potter’s offered hand. The handshake was firm and he almost felt like it lingered just a bit too long, yet not long enough, as Potter’s calloused and scarred hand slipped from his own.
“It’s really over, huh?” Draco voice his thoughts.
“I already don’t know,” Draco replied, a smile fighting to break through his frown. Harry chuckled and leaned forward to capture Draco’s lips in a soft kiss. Draco sighed against his mouth and deepened the kiss. They only broke apart because of the sudden, and extremely loud, “WHAT?!!” that Ron let out.
Draco thought fast, keeping close to the truth as they’d agreed to do, “No, it was more a mutual decision.”
Draco rushed forward having the presence of mind to grab the other man’s wand as he called out to Harry.
He couldn’t move. His limbs were bound. No! He fought against the spell’s grip, tensing from the pain he knew was coming. Hands clutched at him. Let go! Let go! Not now! Not yet! Someone was calling his name. He had to get to them. Had to help them, he couldn’t let it end like this!
(See the end of the chapter for
Beth smiled and shrugged, opening her mouth to say something in reply when the bell over the door signaled a new arrival to the café. When she looked up to greet them her customer service smile quickly turned to real joy and she practically ran to the other woman who’d entered. Lifted up in her bear hug the other woman laughed happily, rewarding Beth with a peck on the lips when she finally set her back down. They exchanged happy greetings and before he knew it Beth was excitedly dragging the smaller woman over to his table, “Damien! This is my fiancee Anne! Anne, this is Damien our new regular!”
“Yes.” Draco replied simply and waited for a reaction. Beth frowned in thought but Anne didn’t seem to have the same reservations as her fianceé, since she marched over to the bed coming to a stop at the opposite end and pushing aside Harry and Draco’s legs to jump up in the bed herself,  “Well now we know what to put on the reservations.”
Harry tensed as soon as the apartment door came into view. He felt as if all the air had been sucked from the hall, from his lungs and a vice had gripped his heart. He took a steadying breath and forced his feet to move, forced his hand to raise his key to the door, and stumbled in shock when the door swung open and he was pulled inside.
The sound of the door opening caught his attention and he steadfastly ignored Potter’s unmistakable footfalls.
Draco laughed, and it was bright and loud and clear. To Harry it was the sound of pure joy and he wished he could capture it. Instead he settled for snuggling closer to Draco who spelled off the light with a shake of his head, “Sweet dreams, Harry.”
Harry had taken a seat on the sofa and his eyes kept drifting between the bedroom door and the floor. Recalling the lines Draco had drawn of him he subconsciously reached up to touch his face, feeling the phantom trace of a certain other’s soft hand in place of his own.
Draco met his eyes then. Deep green and full of some emotions Draco didn’t have it in him to decode, not now, so he just looked away. Potter huffed and he could feel his breath this close, it tickled Draco’s neck, “We’re not children anymore. We’re partners so stop fighting me and use my bloody name, Draco.”
“What are you doing?”
Even as he fought to pull away his hands shook in Harry’s firm grip and the crack in Malfoy’s voice didn’t go unnoticed either. Harry just looked at him, expression free from judgement but frowning,
Harry scrunched his face in confusion. “What do you mean?”
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing?” Malfoy whispered angrily. Harry just tired to bite back a laugh as he whispered back,
Double date time!!
"You want to spell it out for you, Malfoy?"
Malfoy once again tried to bypass him, reaching for the door handle. Harry just shifted to block him and grabbed the other man's reaching arm. Malfoy just glared at him.
Draco found himself agreeing, the topic changing and everyone falling into the contented murmur before Harry announced desert. Treacle tart and Draco let out a snort before he could stop himself, coughing when he realized all eyes had turned to him, “Ah, it’s- well it’s always been his favorite so I should have predicted it.”
"Really? Move already, I've work to finish."
“Oh no dear, I couldn’t impose! I just wanted to say hello and if I’m not back soon who knows what’ll become of my roast.” She gave a shaky laugh, “You two make a lovely pair. Feel free to come by if you ever need anything.”
Beth laughed, “Oh it definitely was then. Oh, don’t worry I’ll stop teasing you so much.”
Malfoy let out an incredulous noise, “Go. Away. Potter!” Malfoy closed the distance and ground out the words, punctuating each with a shove at Harry’s chest. Harry’s hands quickly snapped up to grab Malfoys wrists, which only enraged him further as Harry leveled at him, “No.”
“I got the rest. Can you check the tea?”
The small room was the off white of every office ever and the worn wood floors hinted that the room had been well used before them. A wooden bookshelf with file cabinets spanned the right wall and a comfortable looking old brown leather sofa was directly adjacent to it against the back wall. Two long desks took up the left side of the room and a corner of the back wall. A chalkboard and corkboard hung over each respectively. Impersonal and efficient. He was grateful the unspeakable witch had thought to get them all the needed to work the case in peace and secrecy. Although, Draco supposed to an unspeakable the need for secrecy would be almost second nature. Potter trailed in behind him to look around with an unreadable expression, rubbing at the ring he now wore. Draco was suddenly very aware of the weight of his own. It came as more of a surprise than it should have then, when Potter asked, “What do you think we are like as a couple?”
“Yeah, that and I have to at least pretend I'm running a business.”
Potter looked anywhere but at him when he replied,
It was the first time Harry had really looked at his old school nemesis in years. The years it seemed had been kind to Malfoy; his once pointy features now sharp and refined. His eyes though, Harry decided, were still the same. They still held the same sharp glint disclosing an even sharp mind. And as the glamour faded from Harry’s view of him he took in the other changes Malfoy had made; his white blonde hair tousled in a way that seemed natural, longer too than it had been when they were in school together. It suited him. He looked more relaxed, less like a stuck up pureblood and more approachable. Draco absentmindedly took a sip of his latte, a bit of foam sticking above his lip. Harry opened his mouth to mention it but before the words left his mouth Malfoy ran his tongue over it. He felt a strange tightness in his throat at the sight. Perhaps he was catching a cold? Harry almost didn’t notice their waiter until his breakfast was set in front of him.
Draco scoffed, turned to fully face the other man and was fully intending to argue that he didn't need to be chastised like a child when a treacherous yawn escaped his lips instead. He felt his face heat in embarrassment and wanted to throw something at Potters half smug expression that easily read as both an "I told you so" and exasperation.
Harry huffed and ran a hand through his already messy hair (despite his hair tie’s valiant effort at maintaining it in a low bun), the other hand balled tightly at his side, “Would you just let me finish?”
Draco turned when he heard the door open. Potter looked like he’d seen a ghost and after just standing there for a solid minute Draco gave an irritated huff and went to close and lock the door that had been carelessly left open to the hall. Honestly, what was Potter thinking? Draco was going to ask as much when suddenly Potter turned, “Tea? I could use some. Long day.”
“Sure,” Draco’s voice dripped with sarcasm as he drew out the word, smile breaking through at last despite his best attempts to remain stoic. Harry didn’t even acknowledge he’d spoken, raising his wand to the tree once again transfiguring the garlands. Well, Draco could live with red and silver. He just set about adding green and silver baubles in response, ignoring Potter’s long suffering sigh. Though he didn’t complain when Potter added his own red and gold ones. Sometime later when they stepped back to get a proper look at their tree, Draco came to a realization; they probably could have planned this out better. The branches were almost groaning under the weight of their hodgepodge decorations in places. Other places were almost bare save the haphazardly wrapped tinsel. Well. Perhaps they could fix it?
“So, what had you looking so glum earlier?”
“We- Well he did something stupid I’m still not sure how to feel about what happened,” he paused to take in a breath, “...And i’m ashamed of how I’ve acted toward him since but I still don’t really know how to feel.”
“I was just going to ask if you’re doing okay.”
Harry sighed, unsure how he felt about the prospect of working with Malfoy. He only knew this was going to be awkward.
Beth nodded and stayed silent for a few moments in contemplation,
"You'll take the sofa then?"
When he opened the bedroom door Malfoy didn’t look up from where he sat at the little desk that was staged as his “writing desk”. He was absorbed in whatever it was and didn’t seem to hear Harry come out so he walked over to get his attention, tell him the shower was free, only to be brought to a stop with a soft, “Oh.”
"You alright?" Potter's voice was quiet, almost timid in the dark. Draco's eyes had started to adjust to the dim meaning he could just make out the shape of Potter sat next to him, hand still on Draco's arm from where he'd tried to calm him. He managed a weak nod then, remembering how dark it was, a weak, "Yes."
His chest ached, phantom pain from long numb scars. His back blistered from the flames licking his back. He knew he'd have a scar. He'd lived through this before. But in the twisted depths of his subconscious his grip on Potter slipped and the other boy, for they were both as they were then- practically children, looked back at him. And shoved.
“Honey?” Malfoy set his teacup down with a scowl.
“Something good happen?”
Ollivander let out a huff that might have been a laugh, “Ah, you young ones just charge in. That’s why relationships these days fall apart so quick; you choose based on what's similar rather than complementary. Your soulmate, just like your wand, will not be a reflection of who you are but rather someone who makes you stronger. Ah, but I've rambled long enough and you must have other work to attend to. I’ll be seeing you tomorrow?”
If he hadn’t immediately recognized Draco he might have swung out at the man who had pulled him inside before roughly shoving his back against the now closed door, “What the h-”
An actual mature discussion between these two lovable idiots? More likely than you think! Lol I like to think these two matured after the war.
The name hung heavy in the small space between them as Malfoy’s laughter had ended and he’d taken to staring to the side with something like furious disbelief at some point in the kitchen instead of at Harry. Harry took in his angry auror partner, his unusually disheveled attire and the dark rings staining pale skin under pale eyes. He looked exhausted. Harry had just started to apologize again when suddenly Malfoy was shoving him against the door once more, Harry’s collar bunched in his fists, closing the gap between them to mere inches as he hissed,
Spell fire exchanged.
Harry smiled at that, smiled not smirked because it was with the gentlest teasing expression he’d ever seen that Harry pushed a few strands of hair that had fallen across Draco’s forehead back and whispered, “I think I have some idea.”
Breakfast was a friendly affair, almost festive as Beth talked about how they needed to finish decorating the café for the season. It was closed today luckily, so the four of them enjoyed a breakfast prepared in the little kitchen with minimal squabbling by the two cooks amongst them; a menagerie of pancakes and eggs and bacon and toast and jams. Draco made his coffee french pressed and Harry made a pot of strong tea for himself and their guests.
She places a hand on Draco’s shoulder, gentle but firm as she pulls him back and a medi witch steps forward and begins muttering and casting spells over Harry. Draco thinks his breathing looks a little steadier when they apparate away with him.
Thinking about what Beth had said about decorating for the holiday’s Draco turned toward their rather bland apartment with a frown. It may be an assignment but they should at least put up the pretense of a couple living here, right? What if Beth and Anne wanted to come by again and saw they’d done nothing for the holidays? It would make something seem off about them. They couldn’t have that.
Harry didn’t know what he could say to that. Because he also knew what others in the Auror’s thought of Draco Malfoy. What he used to think of him.
Headmistress McGonagall was also pleased to make the exception of off school grounds residency when she learned of their purchase in Hogsmeade.
The unspeakable took their auror robes in an empty room at the hospital; replacing the glamour she’d broken. He and Potter had remained silent the entire way home. Several apparations that were over too quickly.
Harry didn’t understand what was wrong with the pair of brown corduroy pants Malfoy had floating in front of him but then Harry’s idea of an outfit consisted of Sirius’s old band shirts and Weasley sweaters and jeans that had a reasonable amount of wear and tear. He looked over at his pile of admittedly more haphazardly stacked clothes. The vests and suits were admittedly not his forte. He didn’t even know what he was meant to do with the pile of short vaguely tie shaped cloths. At least the short leather boots were oxfords were straightforward enough. He was going to look like some sort of professor. Well, wandmaker he reminded himself. Apprentice wandmaker, to Olivander no less. He wondered how the ministry had gotten him to go along with this, taking on an apprentice who would actually be spending his time canvassing the area. He let out an audible sigh, staring off into space.
“I should have done something!” Harry blurted out, half absorbed in his own thoughts and pacing. Anne was just with them after all. He should have found some discrete protective charm or something. She worked at St.Mungo’s for Merlin’s sake- He should have considered how dangerous her job and commute would be for her.
“Oh, it’s-” Harry was going to shake his head no but then a question did occur to him, “actually, yeah. Wandmaking is like spellwork right? How does one just create a new wand and make it work?”
“Kept busy while I patrolled, did you?” He’d turned that thousand watt smile on Draco and took back the shrunken tree, floating it around the room in different places to figure out where it’d fit.
“You’re- you're not angry I kissed you?”
Potter scowled at that, an improvement to his ashen expression from earlier, and said, “Game on.”
They had appointments scheduled today with a few of the more suspicious shop owners. All of them were none too pleased with their presence but willing enough to work with them at the thought of all the galleons a wedding would bring them. It was a shame really such a sour faced old woman ran such a lovely little flower shop, Harry thought after one said meeting when he noticed the basket of pale coral roses as he “browsed”. It would make sense to buy something he reasoned as he found himself picking one out. A single rose was well within their expenses as well so Malfoy could hardly argue he wasted his money. The smiling attendant who didn’t seem to share her employer’s phobia even gave him a discount with a conspiratorial finger to her lips and a congratulations on his engagement.
“No, you’re just convinced that every issue could be prevented by you. That you, Saint Potter, can always save the day.” Malfoy retorted dryly, “Newsflash, Potter, that's not how reality works. Sometimes there’s just nothing you can do!”
And that did it. Draco didn’t know what else to do so he swung. Potter dodged the first one and then they were fighting. Draco lashing out and Potter blocking and shoving him back until he was cornered- his back was to the wall. Potter grabbed his wrists and Draco just leaned into the wall, looking anywhere but at Potter. He was drained. He didn’t even want to fight anymore. He was so tired and knew that it was juvenile to cling to their past rivalry as he did but the alternative was terrifying.
If Robards had a sense of humor, Harry would have thought the assignment a joke. Not that a series of what seems to be homophobic murders of wizarding couples were anything to joke about - no Harry wanted to catch the bastard just as much as the rest of the office. It was who he was partnered with that was unbelievable.
Harry’s heart came to a sudden stop. Draco was rambling vehemently about how he wasn’t entirely sure but the man fit the description so well. Harry didn’t say a word as Draco continued relaying the event’s of his afternoon to him. He’d been attacked. He’d been attacked and didn't think that was important enough to inform him about? Draco was now going on about his theory and the spell he’d hit the man with as he disapperated. Harry’s hand tightened on the other man’s shoulder and he finally found his voice, cutting Malfoy off,
Harry laughed, and before Draco could reply captured his lips in a gentle kiss before deepening it to something that tried to convey everything he was feeling at that moment. When they broke apart Draco looked dazed but as they placed their foreheads together Harry felt, perhaps for the first time in his life, as if he had finally come home.
“I couldn’t let you do that! Won’t your boss mind?”
Endings are so bittersweet! Hope you enjoyed reading this fic!
"Right, how long then?"
“Accusations? Malfoy I know you’d never-”
“I- what?” Harry said intelligently, head spinning with this new information.
In a sharp laugh Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding, “Well, sorry for wanting to hear it said.”
“A bit of both? I don’t know. I’m not sure what I feel.”
The investigation begins!
“Nothing, Potter.” Draco picked up the flour and moved it into a cabinet, going to reach for another bag when he felt Potter grab his arm and he stiffened automatically, waiting for the insult or taunt.
Draco nodded before clearing his throat, and the cobwebs from his mind, “Yes, I- we just move in a bit over a month ago now. My fiance Henry and I.”
Then just as suddenly the woman half-ran half-stumbled into the street, melting white snow where a trail of crimson ran from her wounds. Silent words formed on lips painted an eerie red as she fell to her knees at the feet of the first stranger she saw. People gathered, apparated, patronuses sent, emergency medi witches and wizards arrived just before the Aurors and yet all they found was an empty alleyway and two words written hastily on the wall in blood,
“Scoot. Unless you want me to crawl over you?”
Draco found himself once again in the little café not far from their apartment. It had a modern yet homey feel to it and Draco appreciated the anonymity of his glamour at times like this. He could order a latte and sit with his case notes, book on cursework, or suspect’s background file transfigured into a writer’s journal and work in peace. No one stared at Damien LeClair as they did Draco Malfoy. And the stares he did get were ones of curiosity rather than hate, suspicion or disgust as he’d grown accustomed to after the war. ‘Once a deatheater; always a deatheater’ people were fond of reminding him. As if he ever for a second forgot. With the glamour in place he could even roll up his sleeves without attracting stares; but it didn’t hide the mark to him. He saw it. He knew he’d never be rid of it.
gonna try to re-upload this fic over the week!
Then woman nodded, red curls bobbing around her cheeks, "Yes, for your safety I'll be the only one to know your true identities until the case is over. I can assure I rarely leave the ministry and since we have had no prior interactions it is unlikely anyone besides myself and Head Auror Robbards will ever know of this."
"Ahem!"
"Straighter hair, scars removed, eyes a deep brown, straight roman nose, light freckling, and a little false scar on your jaw for some realism. What do you think?"
In case you forgot there's still a case to solve...
"Whatever Malfoy, still sharing the wardrobe and everything else though. You're just going to have to learn to live with me."
"Henry" and "Damien" visit the hospital
Yet he smiled into the kiss.
ANGST - don't say I didn't warn you...
Draco felt a bit taken aback and then had to push away the emotions her statement evoked. Had to remind himself of the necessity his cover remain intact. While he was having this internal meltdown Beth asked gently, “So?”
He would apologize. He would apologize and beg Draco for things to go back to being professional between them. That a kiss was just a kiss- it didn’t have to mean anything. It had only been for their cover, and Harry regretted not thinking of another solution and he’d never spring something like that on Draco again. He’d respect Draco’s boundaries and even keep his distance if the other man wanted. He’d beg they just put the kiss aside and forget about it because the case took precedence over any emotions they may have toward one another. Even if Draco now hated him again Harry felt he’d at least manage to keep things civil until the case ends.
They have a mission to complete. People's lives are at stake and here he is sleepless and mooning over his auror partner like some hormonal teenager. He needed to get a grip. He had to.
His engagement. He felt bad for the deception for some reason and that unsettled him. They were just doing their job. Yet the feeling lingered until he met Malfoy outside, presenting him with the rose. Malfoys blush and awed, “Thanks.” may have been for show but Harry found he was pleased nonetheless. Perhaps he should buy him flowers more often. For their cover of course. The fact Malfoy was smiling so gently at him, flecks of snow falling like a crown of stars onto his pale blonde hair, or that his gloved hand was still somehow warm in Harry’s had nothing to do with it at all.
Afternoon light streamed through the tall french doors that doubled for windows, casting shadows about the small apartment. It hadn’t taken Harry long to unpack his trunk, quickly putting his new wardrobe in the shared closet before floating his trunk to the living room to unpack what few personal effects he had brought. Some books on cursework and a few novels Hermione insisted he bring, a quidditch paper from Ron, and a lovingly wrapped treacle tart Molly had surprised him with when he said his goodbyes. He could have cried at the gesture, innocuous as it was - they were only allowed things that couldn’t give away their identities afterall. He walked the few feet to the kitchen area and set it on the stark white counter for later. It really was a small apartment and he was glad the small solitary desk against the brickwall wasn’t actually where they were going to have to work. He couldn’t imagine how he and Malfoy would ever share the tiny desk already half taken up by a typewriter. For Malfoy’s cover job he supposed. It wasn’t so difficult to picture Malfoy scowling over the typewriter for hours. Hearing muttering from the  open bedroom Harry sighed and decided to figure out what Malfoy could be complaining about now.
He knew. He knew all along keeping the thoughts deep down, buried with any other foolish notions that would never happen and so were poison to dwell on. And yet it remained. This feeling. And Draco found that tonight he couldn't quite find the strength to let go. So he didn't.
Beth laughed, “Oh, about Henry you do. But so do I about Anne I’m sure so we’re even on that.” She winked and Draco shook his head. Some customers entered then and Beth left to see to them, Draco sipping the last of his latte. He did not gush about Potter. Clearly, he was just good at this whole pretending to be engaged thing. That was all. Besides he was still irritated with Potter. The man just didn’t know when to stop pushing people.
“Harry,” He said firmly, “You know my name so bloody use it. Stop treating me like an enemy, when you know I’m not.”
Harry wanted to keep getting to know Draco - and for Draco to know him in turn.
"When your ready we'll perform the Fidelius Charm and all that will be left is to portkey to your new apartment!"
Then fell face forward paralyzed.
As they explained who they were and who they needed to see “Garrett, Leo” continued to frown and double checked their auror badges, even insisting on getting a closer look at Harry’s most notable scar. When he was satisfied they were who they said he called over a short witch around his age whose name tag on deep purple scrubs read, “Brown, Cherrie”. Her scrubs were duck free and felt infinitely more appropriate for the grim task ahead of them as they followed her to the victim's room.
Beth returned his smile and seemed to examine him for a moment commenting, after prompted by Draco’s arched brow, “You do seem rather… distracted today.”
“You’re sorry? You’re sorry about the bloody kiss and not for disappearing without a word for an entire day? You didn’t check in! I was out of my mind- I had thought-” Draco didn't elaborate on what he had thought, instead he searched Harry’s eyes with his own. Harry had once compared Draco’s eyes to a storm; he’d been wrong. The depths of emotion that swirled in his eyes at that moment were no mere storm. They were every bit a tempest. And Harry was lost in it.
Settling in to a routine… is that a good thing?
Harry still looked at the button in confusion but attempted a smile, “And who was the victim of your experiment? One of the vendors?”
There was a struggle.
Harry woke with a headache. It didn’t help ease his frustrations to realize Draco was nowhere to  be found in the apartment. He must have left early to avoid him, probably didn’t even want to look at Harry after he’d so terribly overstepped. Harry rubbed the sleep from his eyes and fixed his glasses; continuing the internal debate he’d fallen asleep to. After a quick change of clothes and an attempt at breakfast he left the apartment without any real destination. Ollivander’s was closed today. He didn’t know what else to do with all his pent up energy so he ran. He ran and only when his legs and lungs ached in protest and the cold air felt like shards of glass to breathe in did he rest. He’d wound up in a different part of the city and leaned against a wall to catch his breath, to order his thoughts.
Beth laughed, genuine loud and full, at the comment, “Oh, that’s a good point. I’ll be sure to use it next time she complains. That she should uphold haler professionalism and what not.”
~Six Months Later~
Draco hummed his agreement and carefully took the pie out, it was a lovely gesture. And one of the nicest things anyone had done for him in a long time. The last apartment he’d tried to rent did not welcome him so warmly. But then he is Damien Leclair right now not Draco Malfoy, the former Death Eater who’d only been acquitted because of the golden boy’s testimony. People probably still suspect he’d been blackmailing Potter at the time. He scowled over at the man in question, who had his back turned to sort things into the cabinets. His alias even got better clothing on this mission. The fitted pants and vest were well made and certainly weren’t hurting Potter’s looks. But then Potter looked good in anything these days and that only made Draco’s scowl deepen. He certainly wasn’t that skinny kid Draco had met in 1st year anymore. All lean muscle and-
But they weren’t here. This assignment had fallen to him and Draco; and Harry had royally screwed it up. Kissing Draco had been all he could think of in that panicked moment. He’d nearly exposed their cover because of his own inability to set his feelings aside and he lost Draco’s trust because of his selfish desire. Harry didn’t even know where to begin to get Draco to forgive his actions, and the thought stung worse than any hex.
“I’m not bloody obsessed with being a hero!”
Harry thought back to their school days. To the war. To the trials. To seeing Draco around the office. To the past couple months undercover. Draco was a constant in his life; something he never really connected until now.
Malfoy scoffed, “Look here, Gryffindor, don’t think you can accuse me of recklessness when you wrote the book on it! I only did my job!”
Who was holding what was either a shrunken christmas tree or a tree for mice. Draco raised a brown in surprise, holding the tree as the other man shrugged off his cloak and scarf. Potter’s hair was pulled back as per usual while damp curls stuck to his face from snow and he gave Draco the biggest smile as he took in the room. Draco clutched the shrunken tree, wondering vaguely if he should schedule an appointment with a healer. He kept having trouble regaining his breath lately.
Draco could feel the flush crossing his cheeks and rising up his neck, “He does not-”
Harry found his voice, though it came out fainter than he’d meant it to be, replying automatically, “I will.”
“Don’t. I don’t want to hear your thoughts on it, Potter.”
Draco choked at Anne’s unexpected and sudden crudeness,
Harry smiled into Draco’s chest, “Sweet dreams, darling.”
“It’s Ha- Henry.” His near slip up only caused his frown to deepen and his gaze to turn from her earnest one once again. This was a bad idea. This-
At that Malfoy let out what could only be an offended stutter and finally moved over to the other side of the bed. Practically squished himself against the wall. It would be adorable but this was Malfoy, of course Harry didn’t find it cute. Not at all. When Malfoy finally shut his book Harry set aside the quidditch magazine he’d mercifully thought to bring and held out a hand. Malfoy looked at it in confusion.
Draco Malfoy had been working as an Auror only a few months less than Harry; who had joined almost as soon as the war was over. Malfoy's joining was the bigger shock of the two. Harry had caught little more than a glimpse of him around the office over the past 4 years. Malfoy had managed to keep his head down at least. All Harry has heard about him was his desk was always overflowing with files and he never kept a partner for long - no one wanted to work with an acquitted death eater. Still, out of all the complaints about Malfoy he'd overheard none were about his success rate. Most were about his abrupt personality.
Draco was not shaking, his face was not red and his voice was not strained when he retorted, “Shut up, Potter.”
“Like what?” Malfoy scoffed from where he sat at his desk, “You’re not a bloody prophet.”
The paper bird perched immediately on Malfoy's outstretched hand. The bird chirped out in an eerily human voice,
“Changed over shifts today, so you’re going to be stuck with me for the evenings from now on. Also, I’ve been craving Fasolada and was thinking of making it tonight.”
“It’s going to be hideous.”
Right. Ron and Hermione were still there. Oops. Draco pulled away and made to stand to the side but Harry grabbed his hand in his own before Draco could get too far. Draco looked at their hands and then gave Harry a tentative smile.
“Sod off Potter, you don’t know anything about me-” Draco began, but was cut off by a dry laugh from the other man. Potter was up in his face. Fuming and looking for a fight. Well, Draco would give him one then. But Potter had the audacity to cut him off,
"Doing a more in depth charm - the residual tracer found something. Possibly dark magic."
Draco scoffed, cutting him off, “Did you really just start this conversation to insult me.”
“Only because she had no other choice in partners, kind of like how they assigned you so I couldn’t fuck up any more than I already have. I know very well what the people we work with think of me. No need to comfort the death eater with your lies, golden boy. Now,” He roughly tore his hand out of Harry’s, “I’ll be on my way because we actually do have work to do.”
“Oh, that would be wonderful!” Beth turned her attention back to Draco then, “Say, now you’ve met my Anne I’ve got to meet your henry sometime.”
Draco Malfoy would be lying if he said he’d never considered what it would be like to wake up to Harry Potter. Not that he would ever admit it either. And the situation he found himself in was not any of the scenarios he pictured; for one they were both clothed and neither had woken while stealing away in the middle of the night. No, this was a much different picture. One he liked much better but one that hurt no less; walking up with the other man’s strong arms still wrapped protectively around him even in sleep. The little frown he made while dreaming. Faces so close Draco could make out a faint scar traveling from his lip to chin. He wondered how it had happened. He wondered a great many things that morning he’d never let himself wonder before. He’d always cut off such thoughts before they could properly form, but here? In Harry’s arms, whose face was in the gentle morning light as if even the sun wished to tenderly cup those cheeks, to trace the lines of his nose and jaw. He found it difficult to push such tender albeit unrealistic thoughts away. Yesterday it had been so awkward but this… no one had made Potter stay with him last night. There was no reason to share the bed. To comfort and embrace him when he’d felt so terribly alone.
"You'll be our secret keeper?"
“Eldreda, was an idiot.”
Anne let out another gentle chuckle and shook her head, gazing briefly at her own pastry chef before turning back to reply to him, “It’s long hours but their happiness is worth it, right? Whatever the career.”
Malfoy huffed but turned on his side facing Harry, seemingly finally finding a comfortable position. In the low light his grey eyes were darker and the lines of his sharp face even softer. Harry realized he was staring. He didn’t look away,
Draco's very atoms felt aflame. Even the snow falling around them as they made the silent trek back to their apartment couldn't make a dent in the warmth he felt. And it was a unsettling a warmth as the feindfyre had been so many years ago. Draco didn't know if he would survive this. If he did, where would that leave them? Because Draco was just as in love with Harry Potter now as he had been back then. Yet this time instead of saving him Draco felt as if he'd been plunged into the flames to figure things out on his own. Which wasn't true, the rational part of him argued, Harry had just been acting to save their cover. Saint Potter had simply made another sacrifice for the greater good. Yet Draco couldn't help the burning behind his eyes or the clinch of his fists as they entered the apartment.
