“I wasn’t suggesting that we should.” Draco shrugged as he sat back and Harriet relaxed again, “I only wanted a sample~.”
She felt a surge of excitement ripple through her when his hard arousal pushed against the soft flesh of her thigh.
Immediately upon their arrival, Draco placed Harriet carefully onto his large, soft bed and sent for help.
From the moment Harriet had agreed to marry him, Lucius and Narcissa had taken over with their ideas, not the betrothed couples’ wants or needs.
Mr. Roberts looked at his guest apprehensively but Draco drew in a breath and tried to calm himself as he spoke, “She never even told me about the child…..I stumbled upon the news by chance. I have no mate or little ones of my own, you see, but that doesn’t mean I’ve resigned myself to a life of loneliness. I had a chance reunion with the…..mother, recently, and I have no intention of abandoning my son or daughter. Please pardon my interruption of your evening, but I implore you, sir, will you revoke your part in this adoption? If it’s a financial matter, rest assured, I can pay any price.”
Harriet’s sobs gradually lessened as she enjoyed being wrapped in Draco’s embrace, leaning against him. Harriet closed her eyes and allowed herself to inhale, taking her time to savor the soothing scent of the alpha that she continued to deny.
Rising numbly from his seat in the pub, he paid his bill, and left to wander aimlessly through the streets of Hogsmeade, apparating home late that night in time for dinner.
Harriet began to relive her entire life from the moment her memories had begun, except, it was all different that time around.
By early evening, Harriet was struck by such a white-hot surge of agony, that she ended up on the floor, perched on all fours and keening like an animal. She had shed her clothing long ago and as Draco kneaded at her back while she moaned and spread her hips, he wondered if it was time for him to go ahead and call the medical staff back in.
Britain’s wizarding community hungrily gobbled down every bit of the unbelievable revelation like voracious animals.
“I’m talking to Rose, of course.” Harriet replied, turning her attention back to the child in her arms when she felt the baby start to wriggle in her grasp.
The sight was more than tempting to the alpha and his grey eyes scanned over her predatorily for a moment as he allowed himself to indulge in selfish fantasies.

Draco had in his hands the literary form of the Malfoy family tree. The book contained data that was centuries old, but its original had been destroyed in a fire before the first wizarding world war.
For someone who had been through so much pain and stress in their life, Harriet Potter was a generally happy person, with a kind smile and bright eyes.
By the time she returned to bed, she crawled under the covers, and succumbed to an overwhelming wave of drowsiness.
“- I don’t care if she hates it or not! Your engagement to the Potter girl won’t stay silent forever, my son. I see no reason why we shouldn’t utilize your unfortunate mistake to reclaim some of our esteemed reputation.” Lucius sniffed.
Through his anxiety, Draco found himself unable to extinguish the happy smile that curled the ends of his thin lips.
“But…..but…...you have no business going to work! You’ve just been ill! You need to stay in the nest.” Draco scowled.
Harriet tried to pretend like she didn’t see her groom’s very obvious indication of how enchanted he was by her visage.
It was all done, everything was prepared, but it hadn’t been finished to suit her, and she was desperate to see that remedied.
Gasps erupted as Draco pounced and wrapped his arms around Harriet. He dipped her down for a deep kiss, much to Harriet’s sheepish embarrassment.
“Love, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.” Draco cooed to Harriet on his lap while they both sat on the floor of the nursery, “I let my excitement get the best of me, that’s all. I only wanted to help.”
“You two have done very well.” The midwife praised the happy couple after she looked over Harriet and ran a few tests, “Mother and baby are doing fine. I see the time off work has been most helpful after all, Mrs. Malfoy.”
As she lay in bed, Harriet’s heart clenched when she overheard Draco and realized who was at the door.
Dr. Krause opened a drawer under the exam counter that the computer sat on and handed Draco several brochures as she explained, “The hospital gives several free classes every week. You two should attend, most pregnant couples do.”
Harriet and Draco had never gotten to experience a heat or a rut together and certainly not both at the same time.
Harriet didn’t know what she thought would happen, perhaps she would speak with someone and then she’d come back at the next board meeting?
Draco sat behind her, soothingly rubbing her neck and shoulders with one hand and holding Scorpius in his other while Harriet ate her fill of the many dishes that Draco had tasked the house elves with bringing.
“I’m doing well and I hope you are! I’m afraid I have some distressing news. We’ve run into a problem with the adoption.” Langston replied.
Each evening as Draco snuggled close to Harriet, his heart leapt hopefully when the omega gladly snuggled back.
During the times that Draco did have to make his rare monthly appearances in the office at his father’s company, the employees tried their best to discover when he planned on arriving so they could avoid passing him in the hallways.
For the overwhelmed omega, it was impossible to focus on anything other than the sweeping sensations of bliss that Draco sent thrumming through her.
“No, of course not.” Draco said seriously. He cleared his throat as a slight blush covered his pale cheeks.
Harriet didn’t even bother to look up and Draco frowned, but he didn’t let her numbness halt his efforts.
Draco reached over and gave Harriet’s bare thigh a kiss as the frustrated omega whined, “Draco, you’re being ridiculous. The pamphlets said-“
She smiled to herself and took a deep breath, enjoying the fresh breeze from the sea that billowed into her and Draco’s room.
“Sorry about that, like I’ve said though, he’s been a nightmare since we started trying. It was really good of Ron to go and chat with him.” Harriet apologized to Hermione.
Draco was expecting tears or anger or anything, really, but Harriet just laid her head on his chest and let herself go limp against him.
Harriet writhed on top of the covers anxiously as the healer’s cutting stare dissected the curve of her belly, which was more than obvious, even through her loose nightclothes, which she was still wearing.
A sharp knock on the door announced the arrival of the attending doctor and Harriet nodded at Draco while the woman entered the room.
Being raised as a pampered heir, Draco decided to seek help that night in the best way that he knew how………….from his parents.
Ultrasound technique wasn’t terribly advanced in the late 1990s, but Draco still marveled at what he could see. He studied every line, every shading, every motion.
Harriet’s teammates all laughed, mistaking her determination for the contempt she held for Slytherin house.
A soft, happy smile crossed over Harriet’s lips as she nodded at Draco and gave her alpha the answer he so longed to hear, “Yes, Draco…...I’ll marry you!”
He didn’t really know what kind of scenario or setting that Harriet would approve most of for him to ask her one of the most important questions in her life.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Harriet quickly put her hand back up to her face to wipe away the fresh batch of tears that sprung to her eyes against her will.
In the silence, the tension between them rose as Draco took notice and worked his hands up from Harriet’s lower back until they gently kneaded her shoulders.
“......it’s…...it’s time….” Draco huffed, her grey eyes widening in horror as she felt another pain build across the base of her spine.
Draco had already left earlier, eager to get in some practice with his fellow Slytherins before the start of the match.
Draco didn’t know what was better, the all-consuming enrapturement that Harriet’s kisses brought him, the feeling of her full breasts pressed firmly against his chest, or the warmth of her heavy belly in his hands.
The exam room they were shown to didn’t look all that different from one at St. Mungo’s, though there were several pieces of bizarre-looking equipment that Draco had never seen before.
Draco chuckled in a low, velvety sound that issued from his throat as he glanced at the baby, then back at Harriet before he opened his lips and spoke in the commanding way that made his mate shiver, “I want one, Potter~.”
Heated arousal rushed through Harriet’s body as more of those delicious flicks landed there, in the best spot, while her alpha held his firm grasp on her supple thighs.
Draco had grown tired of sitting through Lucius’s many lectures about how important it was that the Malfoy-Potter wedding honor the ancestors of both house Malfoy and house Black.
Draco leaned in and whispered his request to the salesman, whose eyes widened in shock even though he stayed true to his word and remained silent.
Between them, the only noise came from the baby’s happy, snuffling little grunts as he greedily took his first meal.
She threw her alpha one last glance before she picked up the box, which was unwieldy but incredibly light in weight, and walked into the bathroom.
The next three days weren’t necessarily easy, but Harriet tried to view them as a learning experience.
As Harriet approached the middle of her second trimester, the healers had finally proclaimed her and the baby back on track and clinically healthy, but Draco’s aloof behavior made her feel……..uncertain.
Vulnerable and frightened, Harriet may have pushed him away if she wasn’t so upset, but instead, she didn’t protest at all as Draco pulled her into his lap and wrapped his arms lovingly around her.
It was plausibly arguable that Harriet Malfoy became the most spoiled omega in the wizarding world after her release from St. Mungo’s.
As she healed from giving birth, and Scorpius grew, she decided to take a small hiatus from her career as an auror.
“Why are you battling me so extensively?” Draco asked, “Are you that ashamed of mating with a Malfoy?”
“You’ve never mentioned it before.” Harriet huffed as she crossed her arms, “We’ve never taken care of a baby, either, until now. It’s a novelty, that’s why you think you want children.”
Harriet’s eyes softened as she looked at the picture and read over the letter’s words for the hundredth time, finding peace and comfort.
It didn’t matter to him that Narcissa was in the manor, along with the entire Malfoys’ staff of house elves, if Draco himself wasn’t there beside Harriet, then she was alone, and that was unacceptable.
Draco drew in a breath at how fair and lovely Harriet’s face looked, as she closed her eyes, under the glow of the moon that trickled in through the curtains.
Harriet wasn’t the only witch who was comfortably familiar with the muggle world and its various gelato shops.
Draco’s polished, black shoes clicked over the dark floor as he walked over and opened up his desk drawers to collect the parchments he sought.
When they passed by a nursery window and Draco caught a glimpse of all the newborn babies swaddled in their tiny cots, he knew they were getting close.
Everyone knew that most years, either Gryfindor or Slytherin won the Inter-House Quidditch Cup. Everyone also knew that those two houses shared the fiercest rivalry at Hogwarts and that was what everyone counted on to make the day’s game entertaining.
“It’s nothing too formal. Your father and I just thought we could share a family meal.” Narcissa said with a shrug.
“I don’t even know where we’re going.” Draco huffed as Harriet finished packing his trunk for him while he sat on the edge of the bed with a scowl.
Draco sighed and shook his head as he unbuttoned his suit jacket and slipped it off, “Nothing’s wrong…..Father isn’t happy that profits have fallen this past quarter. This morning was nothing but a circus of shareholders wanting to withdraw their money and executives begging them to reconsider.”
….And if anyone thought that Draco was going to be more than a meter away from Harriet when their baby arrived, they were mad.
Once Harriet was in possession of her photos, she hid them under the bed to allow herself some time to devise the best way to present them to her alpha.
The wedding officiant nodded in understanding and respectfully silenced himself so the bride could speak her vows to her groom.
Harriet wasn’t sure that Draco was even listening to her as he parted her knees and moved between them to lift her shirt and place a painfully delicate kiss on the soft flesh of her belly.
Harry was strongly against enslaving house elves, but with Draco’s reluctance, Harry had hired Dobby and a few of his friends to work at Malfoy manor as paid employees with full benefits.
“Nothing.” Draco said quickly as he stood up from his chair, “I’ll be back, give me a moment.” Harriet turned and watched Draco charge into the restroom, scowling after him.
Draco happily returned his mate’s affection and as he wrapped one arm around Harriet, he reached over to the small, white, metal table beside the bed and grabbed his wand.
As soon as Draco’s grey eyes fell onto Harriet and the way she was sitting hunched over on the side of the bed, his world shrank to include only her.
“No!” Draco exclaimed with a dry laugh, “Of course not! Father has enough money to maintain for fifty years without a knut of profit, although I doubt it’ll come down to that. It’s just one of those times…...all business is cyclical.”
"I've been wondering," Josh asked, voice right above Draco. "How'd you manage to stay out of Azkaban? More Dark Magic? Nah, that can't be right. If I remember anything from last year, it was how much of a piss poor wizard you are. Couldn't even properly carry out your own Dark spells." He barked out a single laugh. Draco forced himself to look up. "You may not remember me, but I remember you. The Carrows were having all the
Mr. Cook raises a hand. “Although of legal age, you are still only nineteen; quite young to be taking on a toddler. In addition, if I’m to believe the general gossip, you are not married or in any sort of long-term relationship-”
Without warning, Draco's mouth wrapped around Harry's cock entirely, dropping down nearly to the base with his tongue pressing along the length.
"Potter is a constant fixture in our media," she said "A hero, whereas our name is...not what it used to be. Being Potter's friend just might bring you a certain publicity that you might not find flattering, is all. So just...be aware."
She shot him a sharp look. "Didn't you take your own notes? It wasn't as if you had much to distract you."
“Teddy, you do not spit on the table!” Draco says, voice slightly raised. “Use your napkin and clean that up.”
"Harry," she said, shaking her head slightly. "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but no platonic friend would carry their friend, asleep, halfway across the castle and crawl into bed with them. That's not how friendship works, at least not with boys. I mean, what would you have done if you found Ron asleep somewhere in the castle?"
Draco removed a hand from Teddy to wipe the baby slobber off his face and Teddy wiggled until he dropped onto Draco's leg, cooing happily. Sitting there, letting the baby crawl all over his lap, exploring the stranger in his living room, Draco felt some of the calm he thought he had left on the train coming back to him.
"If you-" Malfoy cut off as his eyes met Harry's, barely a foot between them with their hips touching. Harry swallowed and saw Malfoy do the same before speaking again, his voice a half-octave lower. "If you can read through these, I'll test the poisons. When I find something that...that catalyzes, you can tell me what the poison's ingredient is."
Draco's hands fell onto Harry's shoulders as Harry pushed deeper into the kiss, his own hands pulling Draco's waist flush against him. Hands drifted into Harry's hair and on his neck, cradling his face. They were tentative at first, unsure, though when Harry snaked his arms around Draco's back to hold him more firmly, the hands became more certain, more insistent as they pulled Harry closer.
Draco had managed to avoid Potter in the previous morning's Herbology lesson, as the class had met in the greenhouses to inspect a rather grumpy but tiny whomping willow sapling. But in just a few hours, Draco would be locked in the dungeons with Potter at his desk, damned to partnership for the next few months.
Maybe his death would bring his mother some peace from whatever might be happening at home. Maybe his death would atone for the heinous things he had done with his life. Maybe his death would help clear away some of the Darkness that was left in the world.
I just...my aunt and uncle weren’t big on magic. Scared them, they hated it, the like. So whenever I accidentally did any, I was punished. I didn’t have a lot else going on, so the easiest was to withhold a meal or two and lock me in-” Draco’s eyes go round, and Harry switches gears defensively, face hotter than ever. “I mean, sure,
“He does well enough. We go out enough without any real issues. And it keeps him sane and more likely to listen.”
"Come on. Let's go have dinner, and then you can have your identity crisis in peace. It'll go better if you've got food in your stomach."
Draco didn't move. He hadn't been able to eat properly in nearly two years, and what little he did manage to choke down usually found its way back up again. The girl beside him wiped her eyes a few times but also didn't move to take any food.
Draco nodded again. Potter's hands moved to Draco's underarms, helping him to his feet. Draco swayed slightly when he stood, but an arm snaked around his waist to hold him steady. Potter grabbed Draco's arm that hung between them and swung it up over his head and around his shoulder. The hand on Draco's waist gently pulled them closer, pressing their sides together, as Potter began to lead them down the corridor.
“No, it won’t be.” Harry crosses his arms. “We’ve been to the park before. You’re just scared of a little parenting.”
The memory of Potter's hands against his chest as he demanded Draco seek help made his stomach twist. Those ridiculous green eyes imploring him to stop hating himself was what was so infuriating, not Draco's behavior. To everyone else, Draco was the one being rational, not Potter and his bleeding save-everyone mentality that had no place being directed at Draco Malfoy.
Karen pursed her lips trying to make sense of Draco's response, before she sighed dramatically and collapsing into the armchair again. "Well, when you find somebody you love, can I meet him? Maybe he'll be willing to talk to me."
But now, nearing eight in the morning, Draco was sitting, fully dressed, at the end of the hospital bed and growing impatient with Madam Pomfrey's fussing. She had waved her wand across his forehead multiple times and checked various reflexes at least three times each, and it seemed that the matron was now just looking for reasons to keep him there.
There is a very suspended several seconds once Potter shifts Teddy more comfortably onto his hip. Teddy curls into the contact deeper, and Potter’s eyes linger on Draco for far too long. It’s when Potter opens his mouth as if to say something that Draco decides it’s gone on long enough. He turns on his heel and strides into his kitchen with purpose, leaving Potter to Disapparate away with Teddy alone.
Ron shrugged as he walked away, leaving Harry considerably less angry and less exasperated when Hermione sat down with her textbook already open in her hands.
"You've been in here hardly an hour, knocking back drink after drink without saying a damn word. I get that the war was hard, but why'd you choose now to come drink yourself to death?"
He had never admitted it out loud. Draco hadn't anyone to tell that he suspected that, of all those that he surrounded himself with all those years, not one had ever truly been his friend. It was humiliating, but nothing more than he deserved. Draco's adolescent years at Hogwarts were just a seven-year cringe.
“Will you stop acting like a madman for two fucking seconds?” Malfoy hisses. He’s cradling a half-asleep Teddy, walking in the dark.
"You can be as mean and nasty as you want," she said, screwing up her face against the tears in her eyes. "And you can push everyone away as much as you'd like, but that doesn't change the fact that you're exactly what you apparently don't want to be - a good person that deserves not to be treated like absolute shit all the time!"
“Now,” Mr. Cook begins, “you both will be taking home copies of this agreement for your own records, so don’t feel like you have to memorize this. But I will focus on the points of importance.
"Of course you have a bloody invisibility cloak," Draco said, rolling his head back as he thought on all the times Potter had appeared somewhere seemingly impossible, how Potter always knew things he shouldn't.
But as Harry's heavy breathing slowed down and a yawn shook his body, he realized he had a dilemma he hadn't thought about when he made the decision to carry Malfoy's unconscious body across the castle and back to his bed.
“You’re not wrong.” Ms. Dribble is nodding, her eyes sympathetic. “It could, if anything, be quite beneficial. It could also be equally disastrous. For now, unless Mr. Potter personally seeks you out, my professional suggestion is to simply wait.”
"Here we are!" Granger said when she finally returned. Four Butterbeers slid onto the table as she climbed back into her seat.
"Sorry," Harry mumbled against Draco's lips, kissing him between words. "I just...there is no...possible...way...that someone...could fake this."
Having to grind through my entire damn childhood with a wizard whose job it is to go through those memories and point out why everything in them is
Draco hadn't a clue how long they sat there, he and Potter. Time didn't behave when Draco had these episodes. But as no other student passed by in the time it took him to finally calm down, Draco could only assume that less time had passed then he thought.
I love the Harry Potter world as much as the next guy in 2021, but the Ministry's bulldozing ineptitude that sort of flutters all over the place and the general 'that's not how anything works wtf is wrong with you' that all readers felt over the course of the series is what really gets this story going in the direction I wanted haha
"Shhh!" Madam Pince, popping out of the shelves themselves it seemed, shushed them furiously. "This is a library, not a gossip spot! Quiet!"
Potter’s eyes flicker over to Draco. The poor fool looks lost. “He...he wasn’t being mean, Teddy,” Potter says softly. “He was just...we were just arguing, that’s all. I shouldn’t have pushed him and we shouldn’t have been yelling. But...but we’re okay now. Everything is okay now. We’re done.”
"Well, the Ministry doesn't legally have any real authority over the papers, though I quite agree with you. But you ought to know that there is no actual investigation happening. No one with any reason could truly believe that Mr. Malfoy or his mother would risk imprisonment simply to befriend you."
“Currently, it’s a poor hodgepodge of those from regular law enforcement as well as the Aurors we can spare. It’s the Ministry’s hope that, once some foundations are set, there will be a separate training program for Aurors that wish to specialize in guarding the prison.”
Josh's foot slammed into the spot he just cut open, knocking Draco against the wall with a loud thud. Draco was definitely shaking now, though he fought desperately to keep his breathing under control as his legs gave out from under him and he fell to his knees.
In one fluid motion, Harry pulled his hand from Malfoy's chest, extracted his own wand, and pointed it directly at Josh. Though there were several feet separating them, Josh flinched considerably and stepped to the side. Harry kept his wand trained on him.
Harry shrugged. "Well, she's stopped actively avoiding and ignoring me. Think that might mean we're getting past things."
Abruptly, without warning, and extremely penetrating, a full-bodied wail bursts from Teddy as if erupting from the depths of an ignited explosion. His eyes screw shut and his cheeks flush and Harry watches as Teddy’s sandy brown hair dyes itself the deeper brown that once hung on Andromeda.
Luna was stepping out of the library as Harry drew nearer. Those orb-like eyes turned on him and a wide smile spread across her face.
"I suppose you were close with most of the Order, being the Chosen One and all." There wasn't even a bitter or sad note in Draco's voice as they talked about the past together. Hope surged in Harry's chest as the neared the first bend in the road.
Tiny hands grabbed at Draco's pants as Teddy pulled himself more fully into his lap, smacking his face into Draco's chest when his little arm wasn't quite long enough to reach the opposite knee. Draco carefully returned the coffee back to its perch on the tray and helped the baby to his feet inside his crossed legs, hands huge against Teddy's sides. He was so little, and he was so alone.
A burst of applause broke out at this announcement, bringing another rare smile to Professor McGonagall's lips.
That had been the last time Harry had spoken to Draco. Harry took another swig of his Fire Whiskey, not even grimacing anymore at the burning against his throat. Maybe he ought to go back to calling him Malfoy.
"Draco?" Harry's voice was right in his ear, Harry's hand over his under the desk. "Draco, breathe."
"Friends?" he asked, spinning around to face Potter. "Friends? Friends don't sick others to keep watch of them."
"No, but he's been trying to keep me from making any friends in Slytherin, trying to set me up with first years in his own House." She sighed. "They're alright, but I know what they think of me...besides, I don't think Slytherins are nearly as bad as Josh has always told me. I like the kids in our House."
Professor McGonagall's brows shot to her hairline. Harry wondered if he had said something offensive but found that he couldn't remember.
Though, if he were honest, Draco thought as the entrance opened to admit more students, he, Crabbe, and Goyle hadn't often talked a lot when it had just been the three of them. It had mostly been Draco spouting off some spoiled, entitled nonsense or outlining his plans for becoming a Death Eater. It hadn't been until midway through sixth year, when Crabbe and Goyle began spending time together without him, that Draco wondered if the three had ever even been proper friends.
"Mission accomplished," Harry said distractedly, trying to focus on talking, kissing, and unbuttoning all at once. It was far more complicated than he had anticipated. But before long, Harry had Draco's shirt undone and untucked, exposing the flesh underneath to his frantic fingers.
Harry glanced around them. The whispering seemed to grow more confused and angry, but he just dropped back into his seat, dragging Draco by the waist into the spot beside him.
Draco jerks around, knife from spreading preserves still in his hand. “If you say you’re not worrying, I’m actually going to forgo magic and just stab you.”
“Oh.” Teddy’s faces falls, but he does finally stand up, reach out to be held. It breaks Harry’s heart every time he has to remind Teddy that his old home, his family, everything he knew before last week, is now gone.
Exhaustion met Harry when he woke early Sunday morning. The sun had barely breached the horizon, and he knew that, though breakfast was likely ready to be served, the hospital wing wouldn't be prepared for visitors yet. He yawned and rubbed his face, then dressed sluggishly.
The terror in Draco's eyes squashed out the confusion in Harry's heart, and he closed the door behind him before dropping onto the living room floor with a grin.
Harry did his best to comfort the crying baby while Andromeda stepped into the kitchen once more, but for all the shushing and bouncing, Teddy only continued to scream. Tiny teeth sank into Harry's shoulder briefly. He groaned to keep from swearing right in Teddy's ear. Not that he'd have heard it anyway.
Harry watched as Malfoy gathered the unused pieces of hummingbird feathers, butterfly wings, beetle eyes, hornet bodies, and salamander skin. His hands shook, though he seemed otherwise steady.
"I wouldn't if I were you," said a tall boy with dirty blonde hair. He was a Hufflepuff, and if the acne was anything to go by, at least two years younger than Draco, who rolled his eyes.
More tears fell. Draco gripped the tower's ledge harder with his numbed fingers and white knuckles as gentle sobs shook his body alongside the shaking the cold had brought him.
The switch from Malfoy’s flat to Harry’s is always a bit jarring, much as Harry tries to ignore it. He sets Teddy down to look around. Having remembered the stress of trying to clean the entire place just before the Care-Seekers arrived last time, Harry took the time to do most of the cleaning last night after Teddy had gone to bed. All that remains to do now are a few dishes. Regardless, the place is nothing compared to Malfoy’s roomy home. Harry sighs as he sinks into the loveseat.
"I used to read a lot," Malfoy said after a second. "Now that I...uh...have more time, I thought I'd pick it back up."
He hadn't truly cried in ages, the last time likely being when he had been struggling with fixing the Vanishing Cabinet his sixth year. Somewhere between the horrors that had unraveled from Dumbledore's death and onward, Draco had seemed to dry up entirely.
No, it’s not Teddy’s fault that Draco has spent the hours following his mother’s and aunt’s deaths searching for and securing a respectable flat. It’s not Teddy’s fault that Draco forces down just enough food to carry him through the shopping required to fill that new flat. It’s not Teddy’s fault that Draco has spent every waking hour for two straight days assembling new furniture, unpacking hundreds of galleons’ worth of things that make a flat a home. It’s not Teddy’s fault that Draco doesn’t have time to mourn. It’s not Teddy’s fault that Draco now faces an uphill battle against impossible odds to reclaim the only thing in his world that makes life worth living.
Teddy frowns from his position on the floor of the play area, blocks stacked about three high and another poised in his hand. “No,” he whines.
Harry straightened up and admired his work. Malfoy, Mr. Only-Sleeps-An-Hour-A-Night, was comfortable and warm, and he had been asleep for at least twenty minutes that Harry knew of, so perhaps this would be the night Malfoy would break the record.
Draco looks up at the clock as he signs out of his shift, carefully writing the time: 9:28pm. Sundays are particularly slow for the apothecary, leaving Draco plenty of time for the more tedious work that Lloyd can find him. Instead of kicking back with a book as he’s seen Lloyd do on several occasions, Draco whittles away his twelve hours counting the eyes of gnats by hand, rotating the perishable ingredients, dusting the decades-old boxes of back-stocked scales, and other such mind-numbing tasks. When he first started working under Lloyd, Draco despised the menial work. Recently, it’s been nice not to think about anything in particular for hours on end. He’s found that it leaves him more refreshed for the week.
Harry snorts into his drink, causing a splatter across his cheeks. Laughter bubbles from them all, and the conversation drifts.
Hermione grabbed Harry's bag and dropped it onto the desk, then gave Ron his own bag. "You and I will partner, Harry. Ron's going to work with Draco."
Mr. Cook continues. “You are of legal age, and you are the next in line to take custody of Teddy instead of a family member such as Mr. Malfoy-”
But Hermione was far too busy to hear Harry. She was tucked perfectly into Ron's lap, her arms around his neck and his around her waist, each pulling the other closer as they kissed gently, lovingly. The world didn't exist for them in that moment, and the sight brought combating nausea and sadness to Harry as he turned back to his homework, tears burning in the corners of his eyes.
“Much better now,” he says after a moment’s thought. “We had our issues at the start, but we’re doing well now, I believe.”
"I see. How thoughtful of Molly to share you with me." Andromeda winked, then turned to offer a hand out to the woman behind her - Draco's mother. "I believe you've met my sister, Narcissa?"
"Good morning, good morning," Professor Sprout said as she came through the classroom door, allowing it to slam shut behind her. "And welcome to another year! Last year was a damned mess, and as I cannot be sure precisely who all was here and for how long, we will be diving in as though this is all your first time as seventh years. Peachy?"
"Let's cut the crap," Weasley interrupted, face already turning a fine shade of magenta. "What're you thinking, Harry?"
But as Harry hurries toward Teddy’s angry screams, he can’t stop the guilt from festering in his chest.
But as he entered the hall and Luna left him for the Ravenclaw table, Harry felt his chest constricting. All eyes had swiveled to him, adoring and awestruck, and several shouts of love and support washed over him like a bucket of frigid water. Harry struggled to breathe as he let Hermione grab his wrist and steer him over to the Gryffindor table, shoving him into a seat and dropping into the one next to him. Neville fell into the chair on his other side and offered an encouraging smile.
At that, the old witch openly laughs. “Oh, Mr. Malfoy.” She waves a dismissive hand. “You go on now. I can see you don’t like it, but stay away unless Mr. Potter asks for your assistance. You might be surprised later.”
“The last time we walked to the store, unfortunately,” Draco says, walking toward the kitchen. “Besides, I think Teddy ought to work through the basics of toilet training and fully master them before we try to attempt an outing.”
Emotion stirs unwelcome in Draco’s chest. Of all the times he’s spoken to Tom, all the Mondays he’s hurriedly demanded drinks to drown his thoughts, Draco has never really paid the old wizard much notice. Why should he? Tom is a service, not someone of value, someone one speaks to for life advice.
Teddy’s sweet voice punctures the silence, drawing Harry’s attention as two feet of energy slams into his knees. Harry stumbles a bit for it, finally collapsing into a seated position on the floor to accept the crazed embrace of a nearly-two-year-old Teddy Lupin.
“Daco to’d me!” Teddy shimmies, wanting down, then grabs Harry by the hand and starts pulling him toward the kitchen. “Make en’ca’cas!”
“That is Harry’s graduation date from the Auror’s training program. Once he has graduated, he will be given a brief vacation, then his schedule will adjust to the department’s needs. It won’t be quite as regular. And, depending on if Harry has been approved for permanent guardianship by that time or not, another agreement for the two of you may be drafted at that time.”
“Having help raise a child is important,” he says. “Many single parents struggle not just with supporting a child on one income but also managing the stress of parenting. It is not a requirement to have a spouse, obviously, but being on your own will add to what is already a stressful situation, which is why your marital status is of slight concern.
Though they had enjoyed countless memorable snogging sessions in varying states of undress, Harry and Draco still hadn't cross the line into active, skin-to-skin touching below the waist. Not that Harry hadn't wanted to with every fiber of his being. But as Draco hadn't stepped any closer to the line, Harry hadn't, either.
voice, finding the source of all his problems standing within cursing range, Draco’s fury pounds harder, heavier. Potter’s face is tinged pink, contorted in just as much disgust as Draco feels.
They fell into a contented silence as Harry also began to dress, and by the time they were both fully clothed and Draco had the invisibility cloak thrown over him, both were breathing normally again.
“Honestly, Potter, it’s a wonder Teddy hasn’t got a vitamin deficiency with you feeding him,” he says with a scoff. The blandness slips from his voice. “Although I suspect that my cooking has kept him from total malnutrition.”
He had stayed long enough. Draco made to leave again, but a warm hand grabbed his elbow, stopping him. The touch made him flinch, a recent corridor even playing all too vividly in his mind and making his shoulder throb.
Harry was five, no six? Fire Whiskeys into his evening, and he still felt relatively coherent. The world wasn't blurring and spinning as the stories told, at least. No, he was sitting just fine on his nasty barstool, downing his drink in his filthy glass, brooding over Draco bloody Malfoy.
"Mm," Harry hummed, forcing his eyes open completely and taking a sharp breath. "Mostly, the war, I suppose. But I think a lot of it was just...me growing up. Moving past childish rivalries and seeing you as a real person, not just someone to satisfy my need for drama."
"Things change, Malfoy," he said quietly, remembering Hermione's words from earlier. "And I'm sick of seeing so much pain. You didn't ask for everything that happened to you, and you shouldn't have to pay for it."
Harry laughed. "'Plenty of girls'? I dated two, and I wouldn't even count the first one. Bloody nightmare, she was. Always crying, and I could never say the right thing. Besides, weren't you with Pansy for like...four years or something equally outrageous?"
Draco planted another kiss, then two, then three, all the while moving towards the head. It was painfully slow, and Harry's cock twitched involuntarily with anticipation when Draco's tongue swiped across the slit.
"Oh, shut it." Annoyance flashed across Malfoy's face as he made to turn away. Harry reached out and grabbed his hand before he could think twice about it.
“Exactly.” But as Draco takes a sip of his tea, watching Harry do the same with more pursed lips, more worried eyes, that unfortunate stirring of pity starts up in his middle. “You know,” he starts, “the Care-Seekers aren’t going to expect Teddy to be perfect. In any case, you’re not
“-pink oval,” Draco finishes. He watches the commotion for a second, then quickly stuffs the stupid book into Teddy’s backpack and zips it closed while the boy is distracted.
Teddy just grunts and turns his face from Harry, snuggling closer. Once Teddy started sleeping better, which has
"Come on, you can't do this to yourself," she pressed as he looked at her. "Go back to being friends with those Gryffindors and be happy again."
“You really light up when you talk about Teddy,” Chase says. “You always have, but more so since the accident.”
“I believe so! I heard about a fairly high-class building that has lots of different floor plans and price options, and they advertise to offer lease discounts for law enforcement.”
Without much argument against that logic, Harry had agreed and was now more or less Hermione's auditor. As Slughorn began their lesson and started going around to inspect everyone's potions so far, Harry pulled out his notes and quill. But Hermione was just stirring, so Harry set them on the desk and moved around their table with the guise of seeing better into their cauldron, though his eyes were on Draco.
Potter’s wand is raised again. “‘Narrow-mindedness?’” he cries. “You want to talk about narrow-mindedness, what about all your swagger around Hogwarts, calling half the school 'mudbloods' and cheering when the Chamber of Secrets opened?”
"Andromeda's quite lovely, and Teddy's just delightful. Hardly cries, it seems. You...you ought to meet him, you know. He is your second cousin."
"Alright then," Slughorn said, collecting the vials and Vanishing the potions with a wave of his wand. "It should take a few minutes to set in, but before you all are too lost in your varying degrees of bliss - homework! You are to write a paper no less than two feet in length about to effects of your particular batch of the Bliss Potion, along with at least three examples of the differences between fantastical and factual bliss. I know it's rather early, but we'll go ahead and end class for today."
Potter chuckled and Madam Pomfrey shooed both boys out, latch clicking as the door swung shut behind them. The castle felt unusually quiet.
“This is quite the place you have here, Mr. Malfoy,” he says as Draco joins them. “A touch more room than Harry’s old flat.”
It was a rather nice home, Draco thought as they Apparated at the curb of a suburban two-story house. Somewhere between large and small, the home definitely had more of a cozy feel than the Malfoy Manor ever had. Long-dead gardens wrapped around the front porch and lined the walkway that extended to the street behind them. Christmas lights hung from the dormers protruding from the second story. Draco tried to smile at the sight. It really was a pleasant looking home despite his anxiety about the inhabitants.
What possessed Draco to accept Potter's offer of a drink at the Three Broomsticks was nearly beyond him. Nearly. Draco looked down at Potter's hand that led him out of the shop. Damned Potter.
The conversation was quickly drifting into the realm of what Draco found to be rather uncomfortable. "Look, I don't know if I'm the right person for this-"
“I suppose. I do wish he ate more,” he admits with an uncertain laugh. Teddy often only eats a few bites of whatever he’s given. It drives Harry madder than he likes, not just watching the food go to waste but also being so certain that Teddy is going to starve on Harry's watch.
They both break off. Teddy whimpers once more but doesn’t lift his head. Harry wouldn’t be surprised if he’s falling asleep. Malfoy sighs.
"Good." Harry sighed. "You know, everything aside...the war, seeing you through Voldemort, how things were this year...you got to admit, there's always been a spark between us."
The nearly-gone brows over Ms. Dribble’s sharp eyes knit together. “No? Surely it feels a bit cozy in here?”
It was the strangest sensation in Harry's middle, experiencing a civil conversation with Malfoy. Part of him almost wished for the usual sneer.
"Because we already know they're poisons, we don't need to identify if they're poisonous or not. What we need is to find out what ingredients catalyze together."
“When do you plan to find a larger home? I think a house with a yard, or at the absolute least a larger flat so this child may have his own space to grow, should be your next step.”
Gemma’s smile breeches far above the definition of ‘beaming.’ Unsettled, Draco turns to find a chair at the greatest distance from her to wait, yet that smile seeps through the empty waiting room like a bad odor, reaching him regardless.
Draco says, somewhere between exasperated and furious. “The Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, all those pretentious titles to go with that dragon-long list of achievements or whatever. Short of being a literal abuser, no one is going to take Teddy, who is thriving, by the way, away from you. So stop fretting like a granny and
“I-” Draco cuts himself off, turns to glance back into Teddy’s room. The screaming has stopped, replaced with quiet sounds of playing. “We haven’t been out this week yet, no. There’s not a good playground or park area for magical families only that I know of, and Teddy doesn’t always remember to keep his magic in check.”
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose. It’s been a rather long week, adjusting to Teddy and Teddy adjusting to him. Aside from figuring out just what all a toddler needs and how to care for one, Harry has also been struggling through the swinging grief and confusion that Teddy began to endure once he seemed to realize that he wasn’t going home to Andromeda. He’s hard to put to sleep, hard to wake, hard to convince to eat, and more than a dozen times already Harry has found himself just hugging a sobbing Teddy as they both try to figure things out together. All that on top of his training has Harry barely conscious at any given moment.
He spots Teddy at the base of a narrow set of stairs that lead to a twisting slide, one that seems to be popular among the smaller kids. Just in front of Teddy climbs a smaller child, a little girl less steady on her feet as she cautiously navigates the steps. Harry can tell from how Teddy is shifting back and forth on his feet that he’s growing impatient, and it’s when Harry takes his first step toward preventative intervention that the stairs all abruptly flatten into themselves.
Had he even killed Voldemort? Had the war even ended? Had Harry walked on shaking legs into the Forbidden Forest to literally die for the wizarding world for this? For those who were more victims than villains to be cleared only to be hunted and torn down by the ignorant, hateful masses? Things were supposed to change for the better, not stay exactly the same.
Teddy actively enjoying sprinting to the toilet in the mornings, Draco’s noticed how there aren’t any extra pants in the laundry, how the nappies haven’t dwindled any.
It’s too much. Potter has spelled the mark precisely despite his idiocy, and Draco’s aforementioned stress and anxieties are just fractionally beyond his control so soon after receiving that damned invitation. Not even bothering with his wand from his pocket, Draco whips around to take a swing at Harry fucking Potter’s face with his bare fist. It’s crude and barbaric and his father is likely rolling in his rotting grave, but Draco doesn’t care, can’t care. He aims a punch to Potter’s stupid scar.
Potter scowls. Although his wand lowers, his arm continues to hold Draco firm. “Your dueling skills are pathetic enough regardless. You couldn’t best anyone if your life depended on it.”
Seeing the anger burn in those green eyes gives Draco great pleasure. It’s ritualistic as much as it is active, sought, the goal for the past eight damn years. But the triumph of winding Potter up so quickly is fleeting in the present, dampened when Draco remembers his predicament, Ms. Dribble’s words. He needs Potter’s approval to see Teddy.
The bed was fairly small, definitely not big enough to give two grown men adequate room for sleeping. He could sleep on the floor or in the common room. But what if someone found Malfoy before Harry woke up, or Malfoy woke first and drew attention to himself in his confusion? Harry didn't think many other Gryffindors would be too pleased to find Draco Malfoy of all people in their House in the middle of the night.
Their quiz, merely ten open-ended questions about the most basic differences between potions, draughts, and elixirs, wasn't difficult at all. Draco finished only second to Granger, and when Slughorn took up their parchments, he felt confident that he'd be among the top half of the class. They were then instructed to collect their potions, some of them adding in a few drops of veritaserum. Draco and Harry hadn't been selected to add to their potion, leaving them a few minutes to talk while Slughorn marked their quizzes.
"Oh, Ginny, they wouldn't have left. Ron and Harry have been friends for nearly a decade! Besides, Harry hasn't gone back on a promise yet."
Draco’s mouth falls open. “Why in Merlin’s name would you think it’s okay to look in my bedroom while I’m sleeping?”
"Not very convincing," Harry breathed. He pushed the pad of his finger at Draco's entrance, firmer and more deliberate. Draco's fingers dug into Harry's skin, hip hips swaying between pushing into Harry's hips and against his finger. "See, now that feels like a definite 'yes'."
At one point, he had needed to use the lavatory, and one his way back, Draco had been found by a group of students that he barely recognized. They had spewed insults and threats, which he had silently let wash over him, but his passiveness only seemed to infuriate them. The next thing Draco knew, he had been on the floor and was being pummeled as though by muggles in an alley, then abandoned when his nose began to bleed.
Ron and Hermione had appeared only a few minutes after he had spoken with Ginny. They had apparently seen Ginny storming away, and Ron had cut over Hermione's tactful questions to demand Harry tell them if he had broken things off with Ginny for good. When Harry had said that he had, the explosion from Ron was almost worse than breaking his sister's heart. It had been a strained few days after that, but eventually the air had cleared and Ron decided (though Harry suspected the Hermione had helped things along) that Harry and Ginny were better off with other people and that his sister deserved someone "a bit more cheerful."
Ms. Dribble frowns, regarding Draco from behind her thick glasses with furrowed brows. “Is there something on your mind, Mr. Malfoy? You are not a dim man. You know that Mr. Potter is Teddy’s guardian now.”
“Oh, come,” Draco scoffs. “Not even a toddler will let himself actually starve. Teddy’s eating habits are just different than what you prefer. You should trust his body.”
A small smile took over Potter's somber expression, and the last of the tightness in Draco's chest fell away.
Harry’s eyes fly open. Teddy is passed out on his chest. The clock above the balcony doors reads 5:02.
Draco scowled at Potter's self-satisfied smirk. "I...it...sure, it was nice to sleep more than ten minutes at a time, Potter, but really, it's nothing more than what I deserve."
“We had an early day,” Potter says with a quick rise of his shoulder. “What’s got your knickers in a bunch today? You’re more shrill than usual.”
So he sat among Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs, all whispering together and shooting glances at him from time to time. Draco fiddled with his quill to avoid looking at them.
Potter's smirk faded and he sighed. "I know you think that. But eventually, one day, I will change your mind about that."
Ron shrugged, but Hermione smiled knowingly at Harry before slipping her hand into Ron's and allowing herself to be led away. Shoving his hands deeper into his pockets, Harry made his way over to the bookshop.
Frown going steep, Draco does after a short hesitation. He disappears into Teddy’s dark room, not making a sound as the seconds tick by. When he emerges, Draco’s eyes are narrowed.
The bell rang as he passed the Great Hall. Draco swore, spinning and taking a different route that would be less crowded with students making their way to lunch. Tears burned at his eyes as he stepped into the frigid wind, finally reaching the Owlery. He quickly found the only horned owl and sent it off with his letter. Only then did Draco finally succumb to the tears.
“‘Might be surprised later,’” he seethes under his breath as he exits the department and makes for the lifts. “As if the egomaniac would ever ask anyone for help...he’ll run Teddy into the ground before he asks the Weasley nest for help, let alone me...”
Several seconds of silence follow in which a Chase seems to struggle with himself behind a perfectly composed facade. But Draco is prepared to fight; he is not ready to sort through what losing his mother means to him.
Well, mostly without issue or worry. He still hadn't returned the 'I love you' that Harry had spoken to him in his bed the night before.
Harry's eyes strayed from McGonagall as she began reading from the list, calling up each child by name to be Sorted. He looked back to the Slytherin table, and this time they fell upon a sleek mop of white-blond hair.
Thankfully, Fleur is already on a maternity leave from her work at Gringotts and is far more kind than Hermione, Ginny, and Mrs. Weasley give her credit for and has saved Harry’s life. It’s mostly temporary, but Fleur agreed to watch Teddy for Harry during the work hours, a full-time job that Harry felt he had to plead until Bill cut him off and Fleur waved away his stammering with nothing but unconditional familial support.
Harry began to read, his voice confused and annoyed. "'Harry Potter, the Chosen One who defeated You-Know-Who nearing on eight months ago this New Year's, was spotted outside of this corner store near London accompanied by none other than Draco Malfoy, infamous teenage Death Eater and son of Narcissa and the late Lucius Malfoy, both of whom have long been known to be in You-Know-Who's Inner Circle. The photo clearly shows a companionship between the unlikely pair, but it is really as it appears?'"
Harry didn't know what to say. From what little he did know about Lucius Malfoy, Draco wasn't necessarily wrong, but it didn't feel right to say so. Instead, Harry crossed the Owlery and took Draco's hand.
He said it so quietly that Harry wasn't sure he heard right, but it struck him in the chest just the same. There was a savage sense of childish justice thinking that all the trouble Malfoy had ever caused him was being returned, but Harry knew that no black eye likely delivered multiple-on-one would have satisfied that. No, Malfoy's punishment had already been dealt when his father brought Voldemort into his home.
Malfoy's eyes were slightly narrowed as he stared down at their hands, and it seemed to take a great effort for him to force his eyes up to meet Harry's when he answered. "Uh...no. I can find anything I could ever want at Hogwarts. I just thought I'd check the place out is all. Didn't want to go anywhere too crowded."
The doors to the Great Hall were uncharacteristically closed for a regular weekend dinner. It gave Draco pause as he wondered for a moment if there was a feast, a holiday he had forgotten. Had there been some sort of notice about it?
Draco shrugs as he sits in the center of a couch placed beneath a small Bewitched window. With a disbelieving tut, Chase settles into the chair facing him.
"I'll bet you anything Slughorn assigns us some sort of essay once these potions are complete," she had said last lesson.
"Some, though I think he's rather avoiding me the same as he's avoiding everyone right now. But I needn't talk to him to know that of course he's missing you terribly. Otherwise, he wouldn't be pulling away so hard."
"How does that work?" Harry asked, feeling vaguely alarmed at the idea. "We're not...we're not going to make a baby by brewing this thing, are we?"
It’s not terribly likely that Teddy knows what Draco’s talking about, not really. Still, it’s nice to hear the agreement. As Draco is loading up three plates, Potter wanders into the kitchen. He looks just as groggy, just as wild, just as twisted as Teddy does.
“Your line of work is also something that’s come up while reviewing the preliminaries of this case.”
Weasley was shaking his head. "Yes, I am, Hermione. And speaking of which..." He turned to face Draco fully, trying to look somber through his foolish grin and glazed eyes. "At my lovely girlfriend's insistence, I'd like to apologize."
The curtains in Draco’s bedroom are thin by choice, purchased purposefully in the hopes of keeping him from using the space like a cave. A slight downside to it is that his room fills with light as the sun rises, waking him early each morning without prompting. Draco shifts under his comforter against the gentle sunlight of that Sunday morning, craving more sleep. But once awake, he’s awake, and Draco gives up after a few minutes of wriggling.
Something flickers in Hermione’s eyes, something that reminds Harry of someone older, someone wiser than surely a twenty-year-old should be. She fixes Harry with a look that blazes though it’s soft, and she shrugs.
“Plenty are,” Tom says as he replenishes the wine. “There are a lot more might even envy you for the security. Regular money, somethin’ to do durin’ the day.”
"Don't...don't listen to what anyone says." Harry's voice was soft and, though Draco tried not to hear it, sad. "Don't worry about them. These kinds of articles come up and they're complete rubbish. It blows over. Don't let it-"
And so, after a rather subdued day with Teddy and practically bolting from Potter once he was back at the flat, Draco stormed into Healer Chase’s office and gave the fool exactly what he’s been begging for these past couple months. Spiraling into a human version of a shit-storm, Draco screamed and sobbed irately about his father’s death, his mother’s death, Andromeda’s death,
Potter groans, head falling back. After a few moments, he looks up again with a fresh glare. “Okay, fine. You can watch him Monday. Fleur and Ms. Weasley are busy anyway.”
"Gossip comes and goes," Harry whispered. "You know that. Their opinions don't matter anyway." When Malfoy didn't respond, Harry continued. "I know you're not some criminal that deserves to be treated like a human punching bag."
A strangled chuckle came from Malfoy's throat, causing both he and Harry to look at each other in mild alarm. Harry grinned, realizing the Malfoy actually tried to laugh at him, but Malfoy just frowned and made his way up to the cauldrons to collect a sample of each poison. When he returned, Harry had his textbook propped open to the chapter that outlined poisons.
At last, those pale eyes snapped open. Harry's heart sank at the blankness there. He knew that look, that faraway gaze as someone separated themselves from pain.
Harry obeyed, and he let his head fall back as Draco kissed his shoulders, one hand gliding over Harry's chest as the other dropped to the space between them at their hips. Pressure made its way to Harry's entrance while Draco's lips moved up his neck and suckled at his earlobe. Subconsciously bending at the waist slightly, Harry turned his head to bring their lips together again, this time slow and tender.
Teddy grumbles, and when the seconds trickle into minutes, into lifetimes in the night, Draco assumes that the boy has accepted Harry’s plea. He returns to bed.
"She said you'd be sensitive to light...but don't worry about opening your eyes now. The sun's about to go down anyway, then you won't have to worry about it."
Harry didn't have anything to say to that, but it felt wrong to stay silent, somehow. Vaguely annoyed, he Vanished the contents of his cauldron and gathered his bag to follow his friends out of the dungeons.
Mr. Cook nods. “It’s quite well-known, the tension between you and the Malfoys. But as Mr. Malfoy has only proven himself to be a law-abiding wizard since the war and has been regularly in Teddy’s life until recently...well, Harry, I quite approve of Teddy having two familiar faces in his life. This is likely why he’s been making such great strides in his adjustment, wouldn’t you say?”
Cold dread slammed into Draco's stomach, sloshing the little bit of stew that sat there. He knew that voice.
Professor McGonagall patted his arm. "Things will either work out or they won't, but you ought to give Mr. Malfoy more time than a few days to think things through and find out how his mother is doing."
With a fond sigh, Draco bends over the boy, carefully scoops him up. Teddy mumbles feebly as he’s carried to his bed, though the moment his body touches the rumpled sheets, Teddy twists to snuggle deep into his pillow, falls still. Draco pulls a discarded blanket over Teddy and gives his hair a gentle run-through before walking away.
"Because I'm Harry fucking Potter." And because he couldn't believe he had actually said that, Harry giggled.
"Right...uh, I will be," Draco said. He pushed off the counter and gave his mother a soft peck on the cheek. "I'm a bit tired from the train and all. I think I'll take a hot bath and rest."
the self-obsessed brat that knows his name can carry him anywhere. Not even a war, parenthood, and all the shit that falls between can stamp it out completely.
“Your narrow-mindedness about me is what will get us in trouble and cost us both Teddy,” Draco growls.
Harry was looking in his textbook, trying to remember what they had done last to the potion so he could figure out what they were supposed to be doing just then.
A little over a week later on Monday, the first snow of the year began to fall as October truly became November. It was evening, and Harry sprawled out on the floor of the Gryffindor common room alongside Ron, their homework spread out around them. Hermione sat in a nearby armchair, nose in her Arithmancy textbook as she had already completed the Defense Against the Dark Arts essay that was keeping Harry and Ron busy. It had seemed relatively simple at first, just to identify and describe the six main types of dragons, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of each that would be most pertinent to someone encountering one in the wild.
Draco looked down the Slytherin table and spotted her among a group of first years. He nodded, and Luna smiled.
"Once you've completely come down from the spell, I suspect you'll be quite happy the Ministry's done their investigation." The girl scowled. "Honestly, I can't believe the Ministry even let one of their kind come back to Hogwarts! What were they thinking, letting two Death Eaters go free? They're just plain evil-"
At his waist, the hand squeezes, making Draco shimmy a little. Are he and Potter embracing? No, Potter’s leading them somewhere. Draco’s feet aren’t really working. He supposes it’s a good thing Potter is freakishly strong enough to slam him against a wall as well as hold a grown man’s deadweight. Draco opens his eyes (they really need to stop closing on their own) and sees that there are only two Potters now. They’re shaking their heads at him.
"Oh yes," Luna continued. "It's a text that outlines the finer mysteries of wand fairies. Wand fairies are remarkably similar to mollies, and as I cannot seem to find a single book on mollies, I am searching for this book instead."
"I do hope his awful comments don't keep you from being friends with Harry, though," Luna said. "It's wonderful that you two have been able to grow so close despite your past differences."
"To be honest, so had I." Draco sighed. "My mother decided to reach out while she was alone. Had she not, I doubt I'd have ever met him."
Draco strode from the common room, forcing himself not to sprint as he made his way up to the Great Hall for dinner. But food was the furthest thing from his mind.
of us, I’m someone he actually knows, someone he happens to like, regardless of what you might prefer.”
Draco's stomach twisted painfully as a small, elderly woman stood and nodded at the students applauding her. Bile filled his throat, but he fought it down as the memory of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Professor Burbage, being tortured above his dining table filled his mind.
Harry’s brows shoot up, vanishing into his mess of hair. Ears feeling warm, Draco’s about to retract the offer when Harry clears his throat and says, “Yeah, actually. Sounds great,” and stands to follow.
For a moment, it appears as if Teddy understands. He nods, looking thoughtful, and Hermione sits back. Harry is about to do the same, relieved sigh readily inhaled, when it happens.
Picking up speed with each thrust, Harry fucked Draco, losing all gentleness as his climax began to race up on him, the heat in his groin burning as he pressed furious kisses across Draco's chest, neck, cheeks, and lips. Draco's legs stayed around Harry's waist, pulling him deeper every time Harry's cock thrust into him. Moans and sighs and cries blended together, and Harry couldn't even marvel at how quickly he was about to climax when Draco was frantically gasping, "Harry, I'm-"
"And that's all they are, right?" Harry asked, remembering the girl from that morning. "Just rumors? There's nothing to them, you don't think?"
He didn't leave his room the rest of the day, instead brooding and trying to complete some of his homework. At first distracted, it only took a few scratch-outs on his Defense Against the Dark Arts essay to kick Draco into some real focus. Before things got out of hand, Draco had actually enjoyed his schoolwork, a secret he kept from all his friends and fans at the time to keep up a certain image, but he had relished in the knowledge school brought him and the marks he earned. Because of the difficulty and sheer volume of work that the seventh years were undertaking, Draco could actually forget that he was a complete waste of a human being in the time he spent working.
His mother could have seen Harry holding Draco's hand as they entered the house; instead, she had her head turned and missed it.
The Astronomy Tower was the spot where things were going to change no matter what for Draco, but he mostly dwelled on the fact that it was the spot where things could have changed for the better. He had been supposed to kill the famed Albus Dumbledore. A frightened sixteen-year-old boy with nothing more than a quivering wand had been expected to murder the greatest wizard of their time in cold blood. Draco had been mostly ready to do it, too. He had spent the better part of a full year resigning himself to his task, sick at the very thought despite his outward cavalier attitude for others to see.
The thumb on Draco's arm began to move, rubbing small circles in the fabric there. Draco felt his mouth go dry.
“Be that as it may,” he says, and he’s grateful his voice is steady, “I still would like to know why, of all the muggle books that must exist, you had to get Teddy the most mindless one available. I can’t even think straight anymore. All I can think about are orange stars and pink ovals.”
"You're stronger than Malfoy!" She was practically shouting, drawing the entire greenhouse's attention. "Don't let him manipulate you like that!"
“Once the manor and the...inhabitants were seen to, Mr. Malfoy and Teddy were located and brought into our department, where they have been waiting while my partner and I have sorted through the opening of this case.”
And without another word, yet another person left Draco. He stood there, bag halfway packed and Madam Pince wheezing on his neck, feeling renewed guilt and misery. Karen was just a child trying to do right by someone she thought of as a friend. He hadn't meant to hurt her feelings so deeply. Draco sighed, feeling incredibly old as he left the library. Maybe he could finish his homework in the dormitory.
An internal scream filled Draco's lungs. If McGonagall had made some kind of announcement to the whole school...well, if he didn't have a huge target on his forehead before, he certainly did now.
Only a twinge of shame flickers in his chest when he looks up at the multitude of tall buildings before him. After Potter left him in the atrium, Draco promptly scrapped his original plan of reclaiming Teddy without breaking a single rule. Years of experience made Draco’s hunt for Potter’s address take less than an hour in the all-but-deserted Wizarding Resources Department.
Healer Chase was rather tactful, Draco thinks as he downs yet another Firewhiskey. Eyes focused more on his notes than Draco, Chase gave a rather neutral, calm address of the skeletonized basics of severe loss, varying degrees of grief, a few simple reminders on handling suppressed emotions that have finally surfaced. Most of it was lost on Draco. The remaining of it has been long forgotten under yet another mouthful of alcohol.
Harry's ears rang slightly at the abrupt silence that met him after the roar of the winds. The shop was larger than it looked from the outside and was a bit dusty smelling. Other than the fact that all the shelves were hardly more than a meter tall, Harry was fiercely reminded of the Hogwarts library.
But after picking Teddy up from Malfoy’s flat after his first visit, Harry knew he was screwed. It was the happiest he had seen Teddy since gaining guardianship over him. It took only three days of Malfoy drowning him in owls carrying smug notes before Harry caved, let reason win. Malfoy officially watched Teddy the entire following week, Teddy was smiling more and sleeping better, and it was all over. Harry was livid that the slimeball got exactly what he wanted.
He leaned, eyelids drooping, seeking only to pour every ounce of affection he had into Harry's lips with his own, but a gentle hand pressed onto his chest, stopping him. Draco opened his eyes and grinned at Harry, who was smiling back regretfully.
"Yeah, just..." Harry trailed off, eyes drifting back over to where Malfoy had disappeared into the storeroom.
Careful not to make a sound for fear of disrupting, Harry pads across the carpet to Draco’s open bedroom door. Is that a guitar?
Hermione's blush deepened. "That's not what I was implying! Ron and I haven't even...look, I just assumed that maybe you two were...you know...together."
"I, er, found you asleep at the top of the Astronomy Tower," Potter said. "I couldn't just leave you there."
Time seemed to crawl by as the class brewed their antidotes. With ten minutes remaining, Slughorn swept the room, inspecting their work and giving out marks. When the bell rang, Malfoy cleared his throat, calling Harry's attention.
He should have leapt from the bed and ran. He should have shoved Potter away from him, shouted at him. But Draco didn't do anything when it became obvious that they were alone. Nearly a full minute ticked by and Draco couldn't bring himself to move.
When Draco remained silent, it seemed that the Gryffindor boy had reached his limit of verbal taunts. Wand ignored, his knee slammed into Draco's stomach, doubling him over. In a few swift movements, the others surrounding them had grabbed Draco's arms, forcing the sleeves of his robes up to expose the pale skin beneath. It was rather unnecessary, Draco thought dully as he was forced roughly to his knees. He hadn't the courage or the justification to fight anyone back. He deserved whatever these teenagers had planned for his chilled skin.
Harry's eyes snapped open. Right. He was in trouble. He couldn't remember seeing Professor McGonagall looking so cross. Harry nodded silently at her reddening face, standing clumsily from the barstool. The world gave a violent tilt, and Harry's hands slapped the countertop to keep from falling flat on his face.
It only took Madam Pince a few minutes to find them laughing outrageously in the far corner of the library. She threw them out, utterly disgusted with the bliss that hung over them.
Harry took out a fresh roll of parchment and his quill and began copying the notes, pleasantly surprised that he remembered most of it without needed to read it word for word. It took barely ten minutes, and when he sat back and offered Hermione's notes back, he wasn't surprised to find her head buried in a textbook.
But was it too late? The image of Harry's retreating back in the snow, not even glancing back, flashed in his head.
He chuckled bodily to himself as he walked back to the front of the room. Harry sneaked a glance at Malfoy, but it seemed that the praise had gone unheard. His eyes were trained on the same spot, back just as rigid, breathing just as strained.
It was Friday, the Friday ending the first week after the holiday, and Harry was drunk at the Hog's Head. The clock struck midnight. It was Saturday.
Dinner was approaching. The Slytherin common room was emptying as students began to make their way to the Great Hall, but Draco paid them little notice as he sat by the fire, staring into the flames with his mother's open letter in his hand. Karen had tried to talk to him earlier, though she had just quietly left him when he showed her the letter, dragging a comforting hand through his hair as she passed.
Teddy’s door opens a few seconds later. Harry sits up in mild surprise as Malfoy carefully pulls the door shut behind him.
Draco glanced over at the little girl that had appeared at his side. It was the tiny first year he had spoken to at the Welcoming Feast. Since his encounter with her brother, Draco had avoided her as best he could.
"Morning, morning," he said. "We've been doing a lot of notes lately, hmm? I think it's time we did something a bit more practical, what do you all think?"
After Harry failed to put Teddy down for bed in underwear two nights in a row, Draco was so obnoxiously insistent that Harry do so that he...well, he did so. But for all Draco’s pushing the toilet training this week, it appears as if Harry will be the one changing the sheets in the middle of the night. Probably because Draco’s horrendous and Teddy’s scared of him. Clearly he’s unhinged, Harry thinks groggily, sitting up. Not wanting Teddy to think Harry’s annoyed with
“The Ministry dispatched the appropriate response teams immediately, though upon arrival it was clear that the inhabitants, a Ms. Narcissa Malfoy and Ms. Andromeda Tonks, did not survive the blast.”
"He's not forcing himself on anyone!" Karen spoke up, her voice startlingly loud against Pansy's. "If anything, you're the one forcing all this drama on us all! It's Friday. We're supposed to be relaxing."
"If you two partner together, you're going to fail. Between Draco and me, you two stand a better chance. So go, Ron! Slughorn's bound to start the lesson soon."
Nodding, Mr. Cook’s lips dip almost apologetically. “And you will. However, my partner and I have our concerns.”
"Did I?" Harry asked. He hadn't remembered that. But with his haphazard sleeping habits, he supposed it wasn't entirely out of the realm of possibility. "Hey, Hermione, could I borrow your Herbology notes?"
But the girl left, rushing down the path toward Hagrid's hut for her lesson, leaving the greenhouse uncomfortably quiet. Draco looked back at Harry, who raised his brows.
Harry sighed and looked up, and he was surprised to find Malfoy's pale eyes looking directly at him, wide and confused. He swallowed and made to pull his hand back, but Harry held firm.
Laughter sneaks up on Draco, tumbles out of him without warning. Obnoxious as he can undoubtedly be, Healer Chase can also be cruelly honest at times, something that puts Draco at ease in bizarre ways that Chase probably studies outside of their sessions together.
Irritation flares hot in Draco. ‘Proper’ child care? Like he and Harry are simply floundering together until Harry can afford something better? Draco grinds his teeth behind a collected facade.
Malfoy avoided Harry for the better part of a week, which Harry had to admit was just downright impressive after the third day. When lessons ended on Friday, Harry dumped his things off in Gryffindor Tower and planned to hunt Malfoy down, but Hermione grabbed him by the arm when he made to break away from the group heading down to the Great Hall for dinner.
There’s a series of small thumps, then the unmistakable pattering of feet fast approaching on plush carpet. Teddy bursts through one of the bedroom doors carrying his favorite toy, a stuffed elephant with an unusually long trunk. He rushes over, barrels into Harry’s open arms.
“Well mostly my...er, my friend’s brother’s wife.” Harry grimaces at the absurdity of the phrasing. “But they’re more like family, really. Fleur’s more of a sister to me than a friend’s brother’s wife. She- well, she’s pregnant now, due in a couple months, and Teddy seems to be okay with her-”
But as Draco walked to Herbology some ten minutes later and there as a distinctive hiss of "bewitcher!" it became downright unnerving. The term was fairly outdated, and if his memory served him right, Draco was certain that it was meant to be a derogatory term for a witch or wizard used by muggles. He wasn't really sure what was meant by it, but it immediately put Draco on edge.
"As you'd expect, I'd say. She and I...we're...well, we're all..." Draco's mother sighed, setting down her fork. "We've been keeping in touch. I've gone to see her twice now. She's left-well, she's raising her grandson, little Teddy, now. He's about nine months, I believe. Adorable little boy."
The following morning, Harry sat up in bed, actually awake this time, rubbing his eyes as hard as he could. There was no way this little sleep was good for him. Between the nightmares and his violent tossing and turning, Harry was lucky to get a couple hours of sleep a night. Before returning to school, it had hadn't mattered. But now, he was expected to be up early and be productive throughout the day, not to mention staying up late to tackle the mountain of homework that was likely to accumulate by the end of the week. Already he had a four-feet-long essay over the different ways one could use transfiguration magic to conceal their identity, and with Potions, Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts coming up that day, he was likely to receive more.
Draco's legs dangled off the Astronomy Tower. He had remembered his cloak this time, something he had been apt to forget as sleep deprivation crushed his brain. The winds were still harsh. Draco was still cold.
"Tell that to Draco," Harry muttered. "Maybe he'll listen to you and stop being a total arse and let himself be happy for once. Let me be happy."
"Well, no one wrote a How To Do A Gay Proposal guide," Draco said with an eye roll. "So I'm making it up as I go."
"Here, this chicken is good if my memory serves me right," Draco said, forcing a smile that may have looked more like a grimace as he dumped some food onto the little girl's plate.
She fixed him with an uncertain look as she bit her lip. "I saw you bring Malfoy into your dormitory, Harry."
"You know," Draco rasped after a moment, "that was...this is excessively messier than I...than I thought it'd be."
A hiss came from Malfoy's lips, and Harry turned to find Malfoy squeezing his left hand. A few blood drops sat on the table next to his discarded knife.
"The old Draco. At least some of him. None of us can go back to who we used to be entirely. But it'll be nice to see your old spark come back."
Malfoy eyed him. His lips twitched. "Just that your record doesn't leave me wanting you to brew up an antidote for me anytime soon."
Nothing more in his way, Harry slipped his hand completely under the thin fabric that separated him from Draco and quickly wrapped his hand firmly around the stiff cock within.
Harry sighed and stood to help her. Hermione's textbook was open to the recipe, her cauldron was already near boiling, and she had all the ingredients they needed, so Harry began chopping up some of the stems as described in the text. Hermione stood beside him, skinning a dark orb.
Teddy’s screams, if possible, grow louder. Harry has to practically shout to be sure Teddy hears him.
"Are you mad?" Harry hissed as Draco shoved him quietly against the wall. Draco slapped a hand across Harry's mouth.
Harry hadn't been able to stop himself from helping Draco when he had found him near unconsciousness in the snow the other day. He had stopped and helped without thinking, falling easily into the role and relishing in the contact he was able to have with Draco. Harry didn't regret a second of it. Bringing Draco back from the brink of collapse was the least Harry could do for him. It had been most relieving when Draco hadn't pushed him away, but Harry had made sure not to overstay his welcome, leaving Draco there in the snow once his breathing had returned to normal.
Harry chuckled and turned to his start his antidote. He found the recipe and saw that Malfoy was right - it was almost comically simple. Just a powderized bezoar boiled in oak sap and moss oil. He turned to see the recipes for Prohibis Spiritum and Blood-duct. They were equally as simple, if requiring a few more ingredients and steps. With a glance at the clock, Harry had to admit that it made sense. Just over an hour remained. Slughorn wouldn't have actually assigned something impossible.
"But...then why is he acting like this?" Harry asked, turning to see Draco. Ron seemed to have taken on Harry's role, chopping and slicing and skinning while Draco tended to the potion. They weren't talking, but Draco looked far more comfortable with Ron than he had with Harry the day before. It made Harry's chest tighten painfully. "Why is he acting like pushing me away is going to make that article not exist?"
And while it isn’t the most genuine birthday wish Harry has ever received, as he sneaks glances at Teddy, contentedly slurping at his yogurt without a worry in the world, and Draco, who seems to be sitting a little less rigidly, Harry thinks that it’s not the most unpleasant one, at least.
"I...I don't know what you think it is I'm doing to you," he began. "But I don't want to cause any trouble. I just...I just want things to be right. I want to make them right again."
Malfoy ends the moment of suspension. “I wasn’t going to mention it. I thought you would use it against me to take Teddy away for good.”
Harry frowns as he meets Draco’s eyes, searching. He’s been struggling with Teddy and food since the start of all this, and there has been more than one argument over it amid the three of them. But for the first time, Draco seems to be making a genuine offer to be on Harry’s side. Part of him wonders what the catch is, but all Harry can bring himself to say is, “Er...thanks.”
"No, your eye was swollen at the Welcoming Feast," Harry pressed when Malfoy returned and checked on the potion. "I saw you, remember?"
“I just don’t think he’s doing much growing right now,” Draco says with a shrug. “He’ll eat more when he’s going through a growth spurt.”
The hand in Draco's pulled back, coming to his chin and turning his face to Harry's. Green eyes looked at him, filling his vision as Harry leaned in a pressed his lips to Draco's. This time, Draco melted into the kiss instantly, kissing back just as gently as Harry's hand was on his cheek.
"Look, I know...I know things have been a huge mess for both of us in the past, but let's stop living in it. Can you stop punishing yourself for what's happened and start moving forward?" Harry swallowed. "With...with me?"
"And what makes it wrong?" Potter growled. "Just because you can't get your head out of your arse long enough to move forward doesn't mean that we all can't."
The conversation to the store could have made Harry sad or uncomfortable; instead, Draco now knew a few new things about him.
"Sit down, Harry," Hermione said, yanking him down into Ron's abandoned chair. Harry's new seat, one that faced almost directly away from Draco, was likely to be both a blessing and a curse no matter how the next few days went.
"I don't think you need looking after," he said. He saw Malfoy stiffen slightly but otherwise continue as though Harry hadn't spoken. "In truth, it's because I
"I know if we turned them in, Professor McGonagall would see that you were never treated like that again. At least at Hogwarts."
He reached past Hermione and opened the door, leading the way into the classroom. He broke away from Ron and Hermione, who had already struck up a whispered argument, and made his way over to his desk. Malfoy was already sitting there, reading a book. Seeing the Potions textbook lying on the desk closed, Harry leaned closer upon sitting, curious. It looked like a novel.
"Look, I'm trying to do my homework. I'm behind enough already, so give it a rest. You're too young to understand anyway."
"Yes, thank you, thank you." Luna pulled an outrageously ornate feather from her bag and offered it to him.
Draco's gaze flickered over to the Gryffindor table, quickly finding Karen's brother and his friends. Thankfully, they hadn't seemed to notice that the little girl was at Draco's side.
"Ha ha," Harry said, pulling Draco up by the arm. "Now get your clothes off, I can't seem to figure them out."
It's real now, in the moment as Teddy gasps his sobs against Draco's chest. He pats Teddy’s back gently. “There, now...you’re safe here. I know things are hard now...I know...” His voice catches unexpectedly, his mother’s kind voice speaking almost identical words to him not so long ago echoing dramatically in his head. He clears his throat. “I know things seem bad now. But you have me, and you have-” He grimaces. “-you have Po- Harry. And if things go our way...it’ll stay that way.”
Harry nodded, not commenting on Draco's quick answer and deflection. It would undoubtedly be an unusual Christmas for the Malfoys, and Harry had no right to insist that it would be anything but that.
Harry and Ron exchange a quick glance. It’s common knowledge now that the dementors were banished. Outside of that, much else about the prison is unknown, save that it was remodeled at the cost of a huge sum of gold.
"Well, it wasn't as if I expected Malfoy to be parading around, calling us all mudbloods and blood traitors again. I mean, the Ministry obviously had their reasons for allowing him to return to Hogwarts-" Harry's chest tightened slightly and he looked away. "-but if what those sixth years said was all true, Malfoy's let himself be a punching bag all year. Doesn't lift a finger to defend himself, doesn't call out, doesn't tell the teachers, almost as if-"
"Well, they are weeds, and weeds have a natural survivability even in the colder months. And if you're comfortable, you're more than welcome to call me 'Luna'."
"Here." Potter offered Draco a few leafs of parchment, filled with the notes from the lesson. Draco just stared, and Potter finally set them on top of Draco's own poorly taken notes. "I can copy Hermione's notes. You...er, you can have mine. Since you weren't feeling well today."
As Draco listened to the class filing out of the room, chattering away, he heard Potter clear his throat beside him. Slowly, every shake involuntarily drawn out, Draco lifted his head to look up at where Potter stood.
that? Draco’s eyes are closed again, but he knows that voice, he’s sure of it. As he wonders, though, little lips press to his cheek wetly, little arms squeeze around his neck. Teddy is back in his arms, hugging him. Did he even leave?
Harry had been offered team captaincy again, but along with his position as Seeker, he had declined the offer in favor of being as normal a student as possible. So instead, Ginny had been given the title when she returned as a Chaser.
Hermione withdrew the ladle. Together, she and Harry watched the potion slow, returning to its gentle simmer within seconds.
Reaching up to plant both hands on Potter’s chest, Draco all but throws him back several feet. With two great strides, Draco closes the distance by about half, jerking his wand from his pocket along the way and pointing it forward. It hums, warm.
It sounded a lot angrier than he had meant for it to. Potter's hand dropped from Draco's head. Irritation flooded Draco when he realized that he was
Minutes later, after racing to the Disapparation point, Harry stands in Malfoy’s living room with his nose screwed up against the overwhelmingly
“Oh, I’m not really trying to sleep,” Harry chuckles. He pulls Teddy closer, resting a hand on his small back when Teddy slumps forward. “Not really. I was just resting my eyes. I’m tired.”
Nodding, Harry goes to her, leaving Teddy, whose cries are beginning to shift from angry to upset, on the bed. He grinds his knuckles into his eyes once, twice, three times. “Yeah, I think I’m just going to wait it out. I don’t know what’s wrong with him. I don’t think he’s ever hit someone like that before.”
Without waiting for an answer, Harry stood and walked toward the castle. He didn't once turn and look back, and it absolutely shattered what little was left of Draco's heart.
Draco let himself be turned around, Potter's hand still clutching his arm as though to keep him in place. Being so close, Draco noticed that Potter looked just as exhausted as he felt.
A minute or two ends up being four hours. It’s only by chance that Harry happens to hear his alarm beeping from the living room in time to shower and leave for work. His body aches from being twisted up with Teddy in the minuscule, stiff, plastic-wrapped toddler bed, which makes training a real living hell. For six straight hours Harry, Ron, and the other trainees sit in rigid metal chairs for paper exams, further stiffening his muscles, only given reprieve in stretching when the physical exams begin in the afternoon. Still, he doesn’t perform quite as well as he typically does. He doesn’t come in last, though, so Harry won’t write the day off as a total loss.
He reached into his pocket and produced his own ring box to Draco that held a very similar band of gold.
Harry stiffens, and Draco knows instantly that there is no appointment scheduled. Thinking fast, he says, “I have the specific date written down somewhere, but it’s toward the end of September.”
Draco sets out the plates, scooting Teddy close enough to prevent the most possible food from falling to the floor. Potter murmurs a ‘thanks,’ which Teddy echoes more enthusiastically, and they begin to eat.
Draco strides right up to Kara Dribble’s desk in the Department of Magical Familial Serves precisely at eight o’clock the following morning. While Potter saw a different Care-Seeker the previous Friday, Ms. Dribble was the witch that outlined the ghastly situation for Draco. Old and sharp as broken glass, Ms. Dribble didn’t spare Draco any niceties at the time, something he respected, respects. It gives him hope now that a direct approach with her might yet yield him something positive.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry growls as he flops back onto the crouch. “Your parents probably treated you the same way you’re trying to treat Teddy and you can’t see why it’s so completely fucked up.”
completely thick, especially when it comes to Malfoy. I'm not saying it's fair," she said, throwing up a hand to stop Harry's forming retort. "But it's the way it is, at least for right now, and you're the Chosen One, the wizard that killed Voldemort. You're going to be famous for the rest of your life, Harry, and people are going to be watching your every move."
The following morning, after a sleepless night tossing and turning in his bed, Harry was determined to make Draco talk to him in Potions. They were partners. He had to talk to Harry.
Draco sighed as he wistfully watched the little girl begin to eat the chicken. It didn't take more than two bites before she was eating properly and going back for seconds. Satisfied, Draco let his attention wander the Hall, safe in the knowledge that the other students were too busy eating to notice him in the moment. After a few seconds, a found a wild head of black hair and round glasses that could only mean one person.
"Harry's a thousand times the person you could ever hope to be, and he doesn't deserve to be drug through the dung by you!"
Finally, without so much as a blink, Chase switches gears. “Would you say that you see Teddy’s growth as more a direct result of your efforts these days?”
Potter tilted his head. "You would've just slept a few minutes if I'd left you there. But you slept all night, didn't you?"
Without thinking on it, Harry grabbed Malfoy's hands. They were shaking. Harry pulled the hands closer and gently pried Malfoy's right hand away. Blood lined the palm.
Shell Cottage isn’t quite what it once was. Before gaining guardianship of Teddy only one week ago, Harry hadn’t even been back to Bill and Fleur’s home since-
Harry had a crush on Malfoy. He, Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, Gryffindor through and through, had a crush on Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater, bully extraordinaire, Slytherin to the letter. There was absolutely no way this was happening. But as Harry rubbed his eyes, Malfoy's face filled the darkness behind his eyelids, sending waves of pleasure from his heart to his abdomen, settling deep in his stomach.
"I've been telling everyone that for years." Ron grinned. "But for real, Harry. You came out of it, and now that all this crap with Malfoy and the
Harry swallows. Is letting a known ex-Death Eater watch Teddy, regardless of circumstances, going to make him look like an unfit guardian?
Harry dropped his forehead onto the cool sink, panting. His hands were a mess, but at least their clothes hadn't been sacrificed in the name of love.
Malfoy was sitting next to a younger girl, a first year by the looks of her, who was turned toward him and talking rapidly. Her face was animated as she spoke with her hands, obviously telling Malfoy some kind of thrilling tale. Malfoy listened with a small smile on his face and gentleness in his eyes, a look that definitely suited him.
Healer Chase's voice calls after some time. He stands in the doorway that leads further into the building, grinning expectantly. Thirty-something with dark hair, dark eyes, dark skin, dark robes, everything about the man is dark but for his dazzlingly white teeth and heart of gold.
After seeing that Malfoy was going to be alright, McGonagall had spoken with Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Luna. Between their accounts and what the sixth years had told her themselves, McGonagall had initially given Conrad, Maddox, and Cooper a week's worth of detentions for being weak-willed bystanders. But the boys then had willingly confessed to a confrontation earlier in the year when they had held Malfoy down and apparently burned him repeatedly, so their detentions extended to a month and they had lost all their Hogsmeade privileges for the year.
"What, you four just took it upon yourselves to corner someone alone after dinner?" Hermione asked. "You're all a bunch of cowards! What has he done to you this year?"
By the time he’s able to escape the girl and make his rounds of farewells to everyone he manages to find, Harry and Teddy both are struggling to keep their eyes open. After moving just beyond the garden gate to the front of the house with Teddy on his hip, Harry twists to Disapparate.
“I...suppose not.” Relatively speaking, perhaps. “But Malfoy and I haven’t talked about this lasting that long. I doubt he-”
As Harry put his wand away, he hardly dared to breathe as Carraway drew closer, her wandlight casting shadows through the crack under the door as she checked the doors along the corridor. Harry's chest was pressed against Draco, who was leaning against the back of the tiny closet with his hands up as though in surrender, palms barely touching Harry's shoulders. When Harry turned his head forward and away from the door, his nose bumped Draco's.
With an understanding grin, Chase says, “My business if entirely with you, Draco. The only thing that would make me even think of interfering with Teddy’s situation is if you gave me reason to believe he were in danger. And I can assure you that having a tight budget in this economy is no cause for alarm.”
"I was here, too, Josh," Neville said. "You don't think I remember? But you know what I remember? That he sucked at what the Carrows had him do! He didn't want to do it anymore than any of us would've!"
Harry rolls over then, faces the back of the couch. His failure is sticking to him as he listens to Draco continue about unloading his things before the latch of his bedroom door sounds, removing the metaphorical audience. There’s a chance Draco is right and this is a common issue among magical families with small children, but the thought doesn’t really make Harry feel any better. Not only had he gone against Draco’s blatant warnings and it turned out exactly as predicted, but Harry also let Teddy down in the process.
They worked in silence for a few minutes, though Harry spent most of his time watching Draco and Ron work together. Neither were talking much, but it looked so...relaxed. Not something Harry ever thought he'd see between Draco and Ron, especially considering that the last time they had Potions partners, back in third year when Draco had been faking an arm injury. Harry smiled at the memory, fond now despite being infuriating at the time.
The moan that came out of Draco's mouth was absolutely filthy, and Harry willed himself not to climax at the sound. He surged forward and crashed his lips onto Draco's in a messy kiss. It only took Harry's hand a few twists before Draco was actively thrusting upward with his hips, nails digging into the skin of Harry's back.
“If I’m remembering correctly, it might even financially benefit you in certain aspects...” Mr. Cook adds slowly.
Draco did, and it was pure, lust-driven euphoria when the last of their clothing was gone and Harry could feel every inch of Draco's body against his. He groaned, pulling Draco into him as he kissed those lips once more, forcing himself to slow down and kiss with more love than lust. Their lips melded together as their bodies twisted more onto their sides, legs wrapping around the other's as Harry poured his heart into their embrace.
There was no answer, but Harry saw Malfoy's lips turn up in a tiny smile, which he took to be a good sign. Until Malfoy's head began to shake from side to side.
Wiping the coffee from his lip, Draco struggled to find his voice. "What do you mean, Potter asked you to keep an eye on me?"
"Of course you were," Draco said tiredly. It never failed that Potter was in the very place he ought not to be. Besides, Draco had suspected even at the time that Dumbledore hadn't been alone. He had been certain he heard the headmaster speaking to someone before Draco reached the landing. Had he not been petrified at the time, Draco might have concluded for himself that Potter was somewhere on that tower with them.
He was lying alone in the hospital wing, darkness filling the windows and lanterns. His head ached though the nausea had subsided. He breathed a deep sigh, wondering what time it was.
"Who was murdered?" Harry asked. His voice was quiet and slightly hoarse from lack of use, but Mr. Weasley heard him.
As Draco laid here, self-loathing overcoming his entire being, the cold on his skin dipped into his heart. There were endless reasons to hate Draco Malfoy, as he was all too aware. For things as simple as being a spoiled brat with outdated prejudices and childish pettiness, for things are harsh as outright attacking students in the corridors of Hogwarts, for things as criminal as practicing the Cruciatus Curse on mere children. The memories had stolen his sleep for nearing on two years now, but after the owl his mother had received the previous week, Draco couldn't find more than twenty minutes of unconsciousness at a time.
The thought struck him, terrifyingly accurate if his mother was indeed on her way to Azkaban. What had Draco if his mother was taken from him? He had already been stripped of whatever he had called friends before the war, his father was dead, any relatives he had always known were imprisoned or dead, and he was rapidly approaching the point of no return with pushing away the friends he had managed to make this year...
"With this year, you can rebuild yourself. Make yourself a strong, better man than your father ever was." His mother's voice wavered, and Draco forced himself to look back up at her. Tears swam in her eyes.
"Yeah, for like a jinx or something, not this," Conrad said. "This isn't right, mate. It's going to cause questions."
An irate sort of energy is bubbling in the acids of Harry’s stomach as he watches Draco disappear into his bedroom, turning into fumes that he pushes through his nose. His mind is racing, chasing thoughts and plans and ideas and schemes, every possible avenue he could take in order to shove Draco’s stupid toilet training obsession up his nose. Harry glances at Teddy when he hears a little giggle, watches as Teddy flips through a picture book on the floor for a few moments.
"Grab a knife, will you?" Draco heard Andromeda telling his mother as the door slowly swung closed. "I have some company coming soon..."
give you that black eye! What else are you letting others do to you when the teachers are out of sight?" When Malfoy only gulped in reply, Harry groaned, rubbing his face once with his hand. "Malfoy, you heard McGonagall at the Welcoming Feast; nobody wants that to happen."
Malfoy removed the ladle, allowing the potion to simmer, and looked at Harry. It struck Harry just how exhausted Malfoy looked, being this close. His pale eyes were rimmed in red and skin tinged in grey hung in deep bags beneath. His left eye that Harry had noticed was swollen at the feast had developed into a full blown black eye the day before, and it only looked worse for wear today now that the swelling was mostly gone, giving the discolored skin there a deflated appearance. Pale skin hung from his high cheekbones and his lips hardly held any color, giving Malfoy a very haunted appearance. Which, Harry realized, was probably not only the best description for Malfoy's appearance, but also the very cause.
“Of course I did! You’ve kept him from me ever since the Ministry just handed him to you, and I won’t allow it anymore!”
They turned the corner, and though Draco made to continue down the corridor, Harry knew this particular part of the castle well and grabbed Draco's hand, dragging him to a nondescript door on the right that he knew to be a broom closet. Harry ripped the door open, threw Draco inside before following suit, carefully pulling the door closed behind him so as not to make a sound. When the latch clicked quietly beneath the sound of Carraway's fast approaching footsteps, Harry pulled out his wand.
“Once upon a time,” Planters says, “there was little Aurors needed to know about the place. You capture the dark witch or wizard, take them there, and leave them in the spindly hands of the dementors. Now, the Ministry is in the final stages of creating an entire subdepartment to fill the prison with Aurors of a special caliber to maintain the facility properly.”
Hours and hours later, Draco sat on the ledge of the Astronomy Tower, leaning over the edge again. The grounds directly below the tower were a dark blur on their own, but Draco's tears were making it worse.
"You're going to stand there and tell me you didn't enjoy every one of those teeth sinking into you?"
Without thinking, Harry’s jaw locks. Much as he’s always loathed the idea of Malfoy being anywhere near Teddy since Andromeda moved them to the manor over a year ago, Harry allows the appreciation begrudgingly. It does nothing to quell the bubbling of anxiety in his stomach, though. If anything, it feels exacerbated, and Harry has to strain to hear Mr. Cook’s voice for a moment.
“Well, there is a lot wrong with you, son. At least as far as paperwork goes. And you know how much the Ministry loves their paperwork.”
The night is calm, though, betraying nothing out of place as Draco waits tensely for several heavy moments. When his nerves reach a peak, can’t take anymore, he finally turns and hurries into the Leaky Cauldron and to the Disapparation point. He imagines he can hear footsteps soft behind him the entire way, but Draco doesn’t have a particularly good imagination.
Harry shrugged as he offered a quill to their shrub. "Well, I can't say that girls are repulsive or anything. Maybe I like both. I hear there's a term for that now."
The Quick-Notes Quill scribbles faster, and Chase leans over to check something. Draco fights not to look as furious as he feels.
A cold hand gripped Draco's then, and he tried to open his eyes. Blinding light assaulted him, intensifying all the worst sensations he had been experiencing since finding consciousness. His whimpered involuntarily, eyes falling closed again.
Draco was pretty certain that his nose was broken after falling spectacularly down an entire flight of stairs. Well, it had less to do with falling as it had to do with the badly aimed Disarming Spell that hit him square in the back as he made his way down toward the dungeons. Studying that morning had gone surprisingly well for all his differing deprivations, but Draco's reputation found him within moments of the library door shutting quietly behind him.
Ron shook his head. "Same principle, mate. I reckon the only reason Malfoy didn't try to blow my brains out at the time was because we were twelve and didn't know how."
Harry launches himself out of the blankets, sends them flying as he leaps to his feet and raises his hands, turning toward the voice.
Despite Professor McGonagall's words, this year looked as though it was going to go exactly as Draco expected it would.
"Maybe," Draco said again. But as he stepped away and left Harry with his cloak, waving a goodbye over his shoulder, Harry felt confident that things were going to start looking up.
Harry let himself be dragged back into the swarm. The silver band on his finger felt like a beacon on him, the amplified proclamation of love that he had once told Draco he wished to shout from the rooftops. Finally, he felt that he had fulfilled that promise.
The corridor wasn't empty, students further down as they made their way to breakfast and waiting just outside for others. Draco turned at a fine squeak of metal behind him just in time to see that the hole Potter had led him through was covered by an enormous portrait of a gluttonous witch with a few too many chins.
It wasn't exactly as easy as Harry had thought it would be, carrying Malfoy bridal-style back to Gryffindor Tower. Light as he was, Malfoy's dead weight in his slumber only seemed to grow heavier as Harry walked carefully so as not to jostle him too much or whack his head on anything.
“Azkaban.” He reaches the head of the table and unrolls a thin scroll. “Not quite what it once was.”
But Potter’s horrid, childish stupidity does little to dampen the joy bursting like fireworks in Draco’s middle. “Then surely the remainder of the week ought to be made uniform.”
Harry's committee had been given only around twenty cases of students that claimed to have acted only out of fear for their own lives or the lives of their families, and it had been up to the committee to decide if they believed them or not.
"Better than you'll ever have?" Draco asked, his voice only barely concealing his moan. "I must say, I agree."
“I suppose...” Harry turns back to Teddy. “Okay, you can stand, but you have to stay right here. No running off, okay?”
"Please...please don't," Harry said into Draco's ear. "Ron's...he's a...nothing he said was true, Draco. No one wants...no one
“Right. See you, then.” Grabbing the small blue backpack, Harry pulls Teddy into his side a little tighter, turns on the spot to Apparate home.
"Look," Hermione said calmly, thankfully interrupting his thoughts. "I'm not trying to corner you or give you an identity crisis. I just want to tell you to be careful."
it was a cupboard, but it wasn’t small, especially when I was younger. And they let me take the spare bedroom just before I went to Hogwarts.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Quite a way with words, haven't you? Do us both a favor and fuck off already. As I said before, I have better things to be doing."
Nodding and smiling, Harry didn't answer, instead choosing to lean down and press his lips to Draco's. It was chaste and gentle. Harry's hand came back to Draco's cheek, just as soft and sweet as he rubbed the skin there. Unexpected tears sprung up in Draco's closed eyes. There was so much emotion in everything Harry was doing, so much that Draco could feel pouring into him at their points of contact. A whimper slipped out of his throat, causing Harry to break the kiss, eyes concerned.
Though their friendship was new, relationship even more so, Harry knew there was a deep understanding that flowed between him and Draco. They hadn't talked or exchanged stories or shared in experiences together, but all those years of dark dislike and rivalry had still afforded them each a certain knowledge of the other's life even outside of Hogwarts. It hadn't been hard to see the luxury that followed Draco like a shadow all those years, and on more than one occasion, Harry had stepped into Draco's world one way or another outside the castle walls. It may not have been friendship that gave him and insight before, but it was that friendship now that let Harry comfort Draco there in the frigid Owlery.
It doesn’t matter, though. Draco’s bed is stronger than his desire to listen to what is more likely just another slew of well-deserved insults. Sleep overtakes him.
"Hermione?" Harry asked, unable to hold back another moment. She turned and looked at him. "Is...is there anything you can do? I don't know how long Ron's going to be."
Beer is supposed to make one sleepy, Draco thinks as he stares at the clock in his kitchen. It’s nearing ten o’clock, there are three empty bottles of Kindle Hops on the tabletop, and Draco is still riding an anxiety-driven high that’s threatening to fully consume him. All he wants is to sleep and work, sleep and work, with no time to think in between.
But even after the war, Draco hadn't worried over it. He had far worse crimes he had committed than preferring men to women.
Having managed to undo Harry's shirt without trouble, Draco slid his hands across the bare chest between them, sending chills across Harry's skin and making him tilt his head back at the sensation. Draco's lips locked onto his neck, licking at the area just below his ear. Harry's hips bucked slightly, his excitement growing.
Harry leaned over and gathered Malfoy in his arms, one wrapping behind Malfoy's back and the other tucking under his knees. As he pulled Malfoy into his chest, Harry was struck with how frighteningly thin and light he was. Malfoy was no more than an inch taller than Harry and may have always been a bit lean, but Harry could easily count the ribs through Malfoy's shirt and robes.
It started with a few of his old friends from the DA finding him - Luna, Parvati and Padma Patil, Cho Change, Michael Corner. Then it became people he only knew by sight, followed by downright strangers pleading for his autograph. Before long, people lingered in their compartment, begging for details of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's year away from Hogwarts, how Harry had killed Voldemort, how Harry himself hadn't died when he went into the Forbidden Forest that night.
Close enough to do so, Draco smacks the top of Harry’s head with the newspaper. All it does is make him laugh, though, and Draco has to bite his cheek not to do the same. He turns for the kitchen, looks over his shoulder.
"Hey," Harry shushed, pulling Draco back into his arms. Draco dropped his head onto Harry's shoulder as Harry rubbed his back. Finally, hesitantly, Draco brought his arms up and held onto Harry's robes as though his life depended on it.
The baby giggled and tried to take a step toward Draco, but Teddy's feet didn't plant correctly and he slumped onto his bottom with a soft thump. Teddy just giggled again, grabbing at his toes.
"I don't know," he mumbled, looking down at his bowl. Suddenly, he didn't feel terribly hungry anymore. He pushed his bowl away and stood.
"Oh no, the magic hasn't entirely worn off yet, has it?" she asked sympathetically. "I can only imagine what it'd feel like to be coming out from such a spell for so long...I'm sure I'd be a bit grouchy, too."
Harry rubs Teddy’s back, recalling the times, literally every hour in those first couple weeks, when Teddy would wake from nightmares. The despairing wails that punctured the darkness won’t ever leave him, Harry’s sure, the sorrow so pure of Teddy waking to realize he’s no longer with Andromeda.
Hermione put her hand over his, though Harry suspected it was mostly to protect the stems. "You didn't read the article, did you?"
"I wasn't," Harry grumbled. He was leaning against a wall. When had that happened? "I just thought we were past all the fear, is all."
"She said to be careful, and she's right." Draco dropped his gaze. "Being friends with a Malfoy will only tarnish your reputation."
“I know I’m the last person you wanted to be watching Teddy,” Malfoy begins. His voice is the calmest Harry has ever heard it, at least when directed at him. Not a trace of malice or arrogance. “But the fact is that we’re both here and we’re legally tied for Teddy’s sake...at least for the time being. But a lot happens in a year with children, and I don’t want- I don’t think it’s ideal for Teddy to think that how we treat each other is...is...”
need to do is call each other by our first names. Teddy has no idea who we’re talking about half the time.”
"You and I both know Malfoy's not out to do anymore harm. That much is obvious if you spend five minutes with him and aren't completely thick. But most people
Draco shakes his head with a scoff. “No living creature accidentally starves to death. He’s going to be fine.”
Several moments passed. Draco wiped at his eyes, the cold wind turning them to ice on his cheeks and tearing at the skin there. It was enough to give his frightened sorrow pause, a rare relief for Draco in the past several days.
“He’s fine,” Mr. Cook says to Draco and Potter as they both twist. “There’s nothing he can permanently damage. While he’s content, however, let’s cover as much of this as we can, shall we?”
When his hands fell from his face, Hermione still stood there with a smile on her face. She linked her arm in his and began leading the way down the staircase.
“We’re sorry for yelling, Teddy,” Harry says as he scrubs through Teddy’s hair. “Just because we’re angry with each other doesn’t make it right to have yelled.”
"I have eyes, Harry. You two are practically friends now, but he's been ignoring you in lessons and leaves before you can walk with him after."
But Harry is nothing but an absolute nightmare. He made the flat unnaturally spotless in the hour that Draco was gone but seemed to have forgotten that Teddy still needs to eat dinner. So, with only half an hour to make something happen, Draco’s putting together sandwiches. Easy.
Murmurs broke out among the students as Slughorn dismissed them, but no one seemed to be experiencing anything just yet. Harry met Draco at their desk to collect their things.
“He doesn’t need you,” Potter snaps. “Mrs. Weasley and Fleur are enough. He doesn’t need some crazy rotation with a hundred people watching him.”
It felt good not to be afraid. He was done. Done with the overwhelming and overriding fear that had consumed him for years, done with letting his insecurities and his past define him and guide him. Draco was
“Not quite like Draco,” she whispers. “Draco’s still around; you see him everyday. We’re remembering those who have...have gone forever. Like...like your Mamie and Aunt Narcissa.”
"And for another, you were alone." Harry's smile fell. "You kept your head down, didn't talk, didn't show up for meals. It was just different. And especially finding out about people attacking you in the corridors and you were just taking it...I couldn't ignore that. That has stopped, right?"
"Oh, Merlin," she gasped softly. "I...I wouldn't even know where to begin, Harry...I...I just don't know how to help, especially since we don't know what caused it."
“Oh, I’ve noticed. But today’s different,” Malfoy says, crossing his arms. “You have somewhere to be, haven’t you?”
“One night isn’t going to ruin him,” Harry says as he starts the bath. Teddy lifts his head at the sound.
On the second floor landing, Fleur is crouched with Teddy and Victoire, small and vaguely lumpy and pink but still beautiful in a strange-alien sort of way. Bundled in a thin blanket, Victoire is tucked securely into Fleur’s chest, head cradled safely as Fleur’s opposite hand holds Teddy’s wrist tight. He’s red in the face, twisting like an animal, screaming.
“Come on, Teddy, no. Please, we’re not going to wake up Draco and demand he share his bed. It’s late.”
“Look, I get you’re worrying like some middle-aged witch but I for one am trying to get some dinner on the table so Teddy has a little bit of normalcy and still goes to bed at a decent time-”
"Friends?" Draco scoffed. "I was far too much of a spoiled brat to have been anyone's friend back then."
But just below Malfoy’s eyes is the back of Teddy’s head, a mop of hair that has returned to its original color. Resolve grows in Harry from the sight, and he nods. He doesn’t have to fall into the abyss. He can climb, levitate, ease into it.
Draco froze as he rounded the corner, knowing full well what that tone implied. He turned and found himself alone with four Gryffindor sixth years that were advancing on him, the lead boy looking absolutely murderous. Resigned, Draco stood still as the group surrounded him.
“Well, I think that will do for now,” Mr. Cook says. He starts to gather his things. “Yet I must say, gentlemen, I am quite proud of the progress that Teddy’s new family has made. Who’d have thought, eh?”
Groaning, Draco lifts his head to finally look at Tom directly. “You sound like a motivational banner.”
“That you don’t. My apologies.” Chase bows his head minutely as he fixes Draco with a searching look. “It’s been almost three months.”
“It’s alright, Teddy, everything is okay,” Potter shushes into Teddy’s ear. His hand rubs the little back gently as his eyes find Draco’s. There is a nauseating intimacy there now, a new level of...
A slimy smile befell Slughorn's face. "Oh, I think that maybe a little extra credit added to your Potions N.E.W.T. score will be enough encouragement for you all."
Huffing, Teddy swings a kick at the tub’s basin, falls to his bottom, and then officially dissolves into furious tears. He throws his entire body to the floor and rolls with all his limbs flailing, mouth open wide to continue screaming in the tiny bathroom.
“Well,” Potter begins, then cuts himself off to set Teddy back on the floor, squats to his level. “Could you go get your shoes, please?” Only once Teddy has disappeared into the kitchen does Potter continue. “Lupin and Tonks would’ve wanted him to know both worlds. Tonks’ dad was muggleborn, and they named Teddy after him. I think it would’ve been important to them.”
In a surprisingly swift movement, Potter’s hand meets Draco’s between them. His fingers wrap around the knuckles tight, then he shoves Draco bodily backward.
He couldn't remember. Had he planned on skipping the Feast? Unconsciousness was creeping upon him, and he struggled against it, wanting to pick up the pieces that were apparently scattered all around him. Someone familiar was by his side, speaking softly to him with their hand over his, and he was desperate to know anything.
“Er...” Harry brings Teddy to his side by one hand, fingers tight around his wrist. “I-I-I thought this was a slide, wasn’t it?”
The tray was unsteady, made to fold and slide behind the couch, and a rather full cup of coffee on it shook dangerously when Teddy pulled on it. The cup rattled, splashing some of the dark liquid onto the tray. Draco lunged forward as two of the tray's legs began to lift off the floor. With one hand, Draco snatched the cup to prevent it from spilling everywhere, and with the other hand, he smacked his palm on the tray, steadying it as Teddy finally found his feet.
Draco strides in the brisk March air toward the Ministry’s main entrance, his pleasure leaking into his step. It’s hard not to grin like a fool as he makes his way through the atrium, down the lifts, and into the Department of Magical Familial Services. The letter of triumph is carefully folded in his breast pocket. Draco can feel the parchment, practically feel a warmth coming from it.
Malfoy’s head snaps around then, face twisted horribly. He carefully releases Teddy, who melts into the floor, still screaming. “Of course they’re normal, Potter, how stupid do you think I am? But it’s our job to teach Teddy that tantrums are not appropriate and that there are better ways to handle emotions.”
Neither one of them moved right away, but it was Malfoy who broke their contact first, stepping away to head toward the storage room. Harry watched him leave. For some reason, he was breathing heavier than usual.
"I've been fine," his mother replied, not quite meeting his eye. "I...I owled Andromeda, however. My...other sister."
"Only my second," Hermione said, unfazed. "But I'm wanting to make sure I'm prepared for my first Arithmancy lesson tomorrow. There are a few concepts I'd like to ask Professor Vector about once we've begun."
Luna had rushed to the Gryffindor table at dinner, dragging Harry out of his seat as she told him that she was certain a group of sixth years had made to follow Malfoy. She was sure that they were the same boys that attacked Malfoy in the first week, though she hadn't any proof. Harry had immediately let her lead him out of the Great Hall.
