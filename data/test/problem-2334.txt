Dumbfounded, Draco asked, "What's so funny?"
Lupin’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion, no doubt wondering about specificity of Snape’s instructions. “Why…?”
Harry steps in close, as close as he dares, to clasp the robes together. He feels just a little bit guilty at his ulterior motives. “You have no idea, Malfoy.”
Ginny laughs, as she did before, before everything happened, as if she honestly finds him endearing. Her face is as bright as ever, her bright red hair flying as she throws her head back and laughs openly. Harry thinks he could fall in love with her again, if he tried. He thinks they could make it work.
Going off to Diagon Alley to shop exclusively for him?
Draco pried Harry's lips apart gently with his own, experimentally sliding his tongue across Harry's bottom lip.
The chandelier broke.
The grin that was about to worm up to his lips was cut short when the hat was taken away from his eyes and he saw the disturbed expressions of the crowd of unsorted first years. He didn’t even need to look around the room to know that others wore the same expressions because he could hear them, the words they said –
, he wrote.
He looked at her dryly and then pointed to his mouth.
He needed to talk to Hermione.
He laughs, a quiet laughter of disbelief. “Potter, why do you know the way to the Slytherin common room?”
He whistled under his breath. "Is this an Invisibility Cloak, Potter? You fiendish, little bugger. Isn't it illegal to own one of these? Where can I get one?"
. Weasley is fucking here with his experience in the field and management and goddamn, you and I both know that he is currently the best fucking Auror in the Ministry right now. And
Narcissa blinks slowly at him, surprised. “I… Are you sure, Harry?”
Potter was looking at him in incredulity. “Your what?”
Harry grinned.
Draco saw the exact moment that Potter realized his presence, because Potter had abruptly stopped in mid-air, almost falling off his broom, and looked like he'd just been caught doing something he wasn't supposed to.
"Where's Sirius?" Harry asked, hugging his quilt closer around him.
So he dialled the correct number and off they were zoomed to the Auror Department of the Ministry of Magic.
Harry immediately sat up, blinking incredulously at Draco, who flushed shortly afterwards.
Harry quickly set to work on gathering everything up.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "You know what I mean, Harry!"
He’s not supposed to be meeting Potter in the library after classes, doing homework, smirking at Potter’s dismay at having to witness Weasley and Granger’s snogging sessions all the time.
"Ah," Draco said in understanding, glancing at the books about Jinxes behind Harry. He paused again, before thinking better of it and returning back to his book, forcing himself to read.
Two hours later, they both stood in front of the cabinet, perusing their job well done. "It brings me such joy to see such an organized ingredients cabinet. I think I did pretty well, don't you think so too, Potter?"
And then he was hauled backwards and the door was slammed shut.
“So I’m forgiven?” Draco asked as he beamed at Harry’s back.
That's all.
He wanted to
He had walked back to his room, but was surprised to find that the rooms he had seen to be dusty just a few minutes before were now squeaky clean. Kreacher must have cleaned them.
He shifted his position on the bed to face the ceiling. He didn’t know if his insomnia was a blessing or a curse, but it gave him extra time to pore over books and ancient texts—anything he could find about horcruxes.
she had said.
There was only one way to describe the pain:
Before he stands up to leave, Narcissa looks straight at him and asks, “Are you alright, Harry?”
Draco was giving him a weird look.
Then, a shrill voice sounded from outside and made Harry jump from the shock.
He felt the same anger from a few days ago return.
me if I tell him you got a concussion!"
It was all a blur after that.
Something tore inside Snape when he forced himself to say, “Yes. They are. And they’ll take care of you better than I can.”
Not even his own parents. His own parents would have clucked their tongues at him and admonished him for not being careful enough.
By the time that Draco left for the evening after bidding him a sweet farewell (“Remember to bring that red wine! Don’t tell anyone! I don’t want their grabby hands on my wine.”), Harry felt like a fifteen-year-old lovesick teenager again.
“I’m sorry,” he lets out in a rush. “You shouldn’t have gone to Azkaban.”
Harry woke up, surprised that he had even fallen asleep to begin with. A quick
“We’ll call,” Harry said with a smile.
The boy, keeping his eyes on the carpet of the living room, shrugged weakly. “Sending me away?”
Harry recalls the image of Malfoy sobbing in his wheelchair and keeps his eyes firmly on the ceiling. “Yeah.”
Potter's hands lowered. So did his shoulders. He flashed a small, rueful smile in Draco's direction. "Yeah, it's… It's a bit hard coming to terms that I'm what everyone says."
Just as he moved to stand, the doors to the Hospital Wing opened. Severus walked in, a shadow in the dark of the Infirmary. Only the moon served as light that illuminated his pale skin and crooked nose.
and the tight grip that Draco had on his waist as they flew above and out of the inferno.
"Good," Draco commented, showing off the Potter Stinks badge on his robes proudly. "Maybe we can give the makers of these a run for their money by making Potter Bathes badges."
Hartsman could already practically hear the galleons jingling.
And Draco doesn’t look at him, keeps his eyes resolutely on the napkin on his lap even though it’s already unfolded properly. He clears his throat. “I like it. It’s delicious.”
Harry stared at her in incredulity.
do it. He could do it every month. (
Lucius nodded.
Harry stopped, looking at him in question. With him standing and Draco sitting down, the latter actually looked… small like that, eyebrows knitted in confusion and insecurity marring his features.
Harry thinks that Kingsley wouldn’t have done that, but the Wizengamot is another issue.
"Well, maybe he doesn't want to hurt the girl's feelings, Ron," Hermione said, albeit a bit distractedly as she scribbled furiously onto her parchment. Suddenly, she stopped and narrowed her eyes at Harry. "What I'm wondering about is why you haven't talked to Ginny yet," she said, sniffing haughtily.
He seemed to be inside an old, rickety house made of wood and misery. Every step he took made a creaking noise, as if the house was groaning under his weight.
A knock at the door interrupted them.
“Draco.” Narcissa’s voice was just as cold. “We are leaving. I shall arrange for Dobby to come back and get your belongings. Say goodbye to Uncle Severus and thank him for his hospitality.”
Harry didn't ask Draco what he thought of snogging.
His eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets. "
“Good. Because you have another week off.”
Sirius’ smile softened. He took away the finger under Harry’s chin and used that hand to ruffle the hair on top of Harry’s head. “You feeling better now?”
turned to look at him, with an incredulous look that quickly turned into a glare. "Are you serious, Malfoy?
told him that he’s welcome anytime he wants to.
From Malfoy’s grimace, it seemed like he didn’t like it, too.
Draco realized, as he looked at Potter's hunched shoulders and wounded expression. Now it all made sense. Potter was surprisingly sensitive about this. Draco didn't know what to do with this information.
Draco sees him, notices him staring, and turns an amused smirk in his direction.
What he didn't mean to, Harry didn't know. Didn't mean to refuse his hand in friendship? Didn't mean to bring back old memories?
he and Cedric made it through the Maze, he made it through the Tournament, they were
“The wizarding world wants me dead, Potter. And I’m trying to fight and claw my way up for the right to live until I can’t fucking walk anymore. And you—Harry fucking
"Leave everything to us. Never let it be known that the Marauders did everything with justice and fairness –
," Draco let out with a roll of his eyes. "Do you even
"I mean, you missed Christmas Eve with me. The least you could do is give me the rest of your life. I mean. If it's amenable to you."
With nails.
He is halfway asleep in the middle of chapter 4 when Malfoy stirs, as if waking up from a long nap, and Harry waits, nervously, as Malfoy raises his head and finally sees him.
He was having a hard time thinking. “How long was I out?”
“He’s –“ Petunia started but her voice cracked. Snape’s eyes snapped up to meet hers or, at least, the one that was peering through the now even narrower opening of the door. It hadn’t been bloodshot when he last saw it. Petunia swallowed audibly and tried again. “He’s all yours,” she whispered.
“You can walk,” Harry blurts out instead, by way of greeting.
And Harry already knew what Draco's answer would be, what he himself wanted Draco's answer to be. To say no to the Dark Lord meant immediate death, Harry knew. Cedric's open, lifeless eyes told him so.
“Malfoy! Wait!”
It was uncomfortable, at first. He isn’t used to talking about himself. But Draco’s a good listener, all eyes and ears, nodding at the right times, and asking questions, but never too much. He doesn’t pry, but Harry tells him anyway, because he likes the way Draco looks when he’s really curious and invested.
“SLYTHERIN!”
“Severus,” Lupin greeted politely.
Like now.
He really had no hopes that he would find something to get the Jinx off. If no one has been able to find or makethe counter-spell, then what were
Harry's shoulders slumped dejectedly. He voiced out what he had been so vehemently hoping against since last night. "So there's really no backing out from this Tournament?"
Theodore shrugged. "Not that I'm saying that you'll be defying death or having anything to do with death in general at all, Harry."
Harry was confused. He took out the Self-Erasing Parchment from his pocket and wrote on it.
Draco raises an eyebrow at him. “This
to do it.”
She was the only girl, but the rest of the team had long since accepted that she was the Man in the group.
He had a lot of questions for his father. His parents dropped by every day to check on him and his health, but often had to go to the Headmaster's Office for whatever
He swerved his broom, intent on going away as far as possible and possibly Incendio-ing the whole stupid Black house, ignoring Potter's frantic calls of "Malfoy! Malfoy, stop!
“…Do you want to talk about it?”
Now that Draco was looking at him again, Harry nodded enthusiastically, almost pleading with his expression.
so that was what the weird look was about.
It smells like Draco. Like hand cream and peppermint.
The little bugger.
Goodness. That was three days off his life that he couldn’t remember, that went by just like that.
"Kiss me, Harry!"
Potter rolled his eyes. "It hardly matters now, does it? He's still gone and resurrected himself no matter if I call him Voldemort or the Dark Lord or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I mean,
That had been another requirement for this mission.
. Draco and his love for plants never disappoints. Harry ignored the twinge in his chest as he remembered the days in the garden of Snape Manor whenever Draco would talk his ear off naming each of the flowers. He even named each of the ferns! And shrubs! Ferns and shrubs all looked the same to Harry; they were all green.
She led him to sit on the bed beside the one Harry was sitting on, very conveniently making them face each other. "Harry, just sit for a while, I'll get back to you, dear."
“You can
“Seriously. When I said I wanted to
He went for a corkscrew dive, spiralling down towards the Hogwarts Lake, unsurprised when the dragon easily followed his direction. At the very moment before he could have hit the surface, he gave his broom a tug and flew back up again in one sharp, swift motion towards the castle.
Draco fell to the floor before he even knew what was happening. He hit his shoulder on the way down, and felt the Invisibility Cloak fall down his body, revealing him under Severus' glare and Madame Pomfrey's wide eyes.
Ron took one look at Harry's grinning face before sharing with him an air high-five and a very manly fist pump.
Harry gave him a dry look. "
Lavender Brown, who was sitting on the love seat beside the food table with Terry Boot, glanced over curiously.
And drinking their blood.
Draco adjusted his head on her chest so that he could speak. "Yes, mother. She said she needs to check on me for the next three days, but I seem to be well enough."
anyway? They were fine just yesterday. Was it something Draco said? Did his umpteenth jibe about Potter's hair finally hit a sensitive mark?
Just like he had always been.
He was thrown against the floor, and he yelped in pain as he made contact with the wood, but could only stare in shock at Severus' panting figure standing over him.
Harry wasn't sure if Theodore was trying to comfort him. "That's because there hasn't been a Triwizard Tournament for the past 200 years after the champions kept on dying!"
He still felt uncomfortable saying yes though, but nod he did.
Harry smiled at the flower in full-bloom, the colour of its petals transforming from yellow at the root to a pure white and then to a soft blush of pink. “It is.”
Harry sighed heavily. Knowing Draco (and he knew him really, really well), he wasn't going to stop this anytime soon. "Do you really believe I would have put my name in that stupid cup?"
"Avada Kedavra!"
"What horrid handwriting," he muttered as he started walking towards the Dungeons. He hurried his pace, just in case someone saw him and decided to have some fun.
, and it's not like it was such an unwelcome event for him – but then Malfoy would turn the corner and they'd pass each other, Draco with his head turned down as usual and Harry with his heart caught in his throat.
Draco hurried in eating his food.
Draco Malfoy hated hospitals. And clinics. And infirmaries. They were stifling, everything was too white, and something always smelled like either sour laundry or sour medicine. That was why, as soon as the nurse cleared him for discharge, he had changed back into his work clothes and was up and about and Floo-ing his way to the Ministry.
With his face burning, he slowly shook his head.
He could already see the Quidditch Pitch and beyond that, the spires of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
was Draco so worked up about it anyway, shrugged and said a stupid, "Uh, okay."
"You are," Severus nodded.
He ducked just in time to avoid a book aimed for his head.
Draco couldn’t imagine it.
He was in the same room he had been in before, a small room with red curtains and carpets. His bedsheets, thankfully, were white. Above his head, he could hear the sounds of a fire crackling in the hearth. His double-sized bed was pushed against the wall, opposite the window that showed the evening, winter sky.
Just like this.
The hooded figure reverently lifted the bundle up. Just like that, it almost looked like a baby. Like a newborn child teeming with life and innocence. But it smelled dead.
Needless to say, Harry found that he needn’t have worried about Hogwarts and making new friends at all.
“Don’t need mistletoe to get me to kiss you,” Draco murmured, laying his head on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco’s kiss is gentle, so are his hands roaming down Harry’s body, and Harry feels himself relaxing into the embrace. He knows that Draco’s hands are seeking for something—wounds, sore spots, broken bones—but they’ll talk about that later.
Harry remembered first year and immediately felt bad. He returned to scribbling.
refuse a few easy galleons yourself,” he said light-heartedly.
Draco nods mutely, because he’s not about to do something stupid like ask Potter to stay. The throbbing in his head had lessened to a dull throb, and so he tries to sit back up again.
Suddenly, exhaustion swept through him and he found his knees buckling from underneath him.
"Yes," Draco answered immediately and flushed afterwards.
to go with you!"
He wasted no time scrabbling from the floor and turning around to hide behind his protector which was –
He does, across from Draco, who’s awake, breathing, but his gaze is distant yet again. His white blond hair sways with the wind, and his hands are placed on top of each other on his lap. He looks almost… gentle.
Potter persisted. “Kingsley said it himself. If you requested for it, he’ll allow it. No questions asked.”
The things that happened next he would remember afterwards as flashes.
The retching.
He noticed Potter’s lips quirk up in amusement at that.
It was embarrassing how Draco's voice broke off at the end of that sentence because he wanted nothing else.
Harry spent the rest of that Potions class with a hammering heart and a slimy pocket.
Theodore looked at him as if he was stupid.
This time, Harry manages to stop the
“Yeah.” His voice is shaking. “Thanks.”
Draco opened his eyes, but Severus was already marching inside the bathroom, a vial of blood in his hand. He must have already had the empty vial ready.
Draco Malfoy is Marked. Narcissa Malfoy is not.
“You’re in a good mood,” he replied instead, scanning the steps for any clues. Like a crack or something. But all the steps, old as they were, had cracks.
"Are you
Harry flew for his life.
Draco called out from the terrace, his grin big and wide. “Come here!”
“How is he?”
Of course he was going to push Harry in the right direction of the book he really wanted, but it was to his surprise (and touched delight) when Harry picked up a Potions book as well.
He may be a Gryffindor, but he had never forgotten that the Sorting Hat wanted to put him in Slytherin once upon a time, and at that moment, his Slytherin sense of self-preservation was easily winning against his Gryffindor courage, and so it was with shaking legs that Harry turned tail and ran away.
Draco huffs in reply. He shakes his head, still incredulous, but that movement reminds him that he still has a headache and so he lies back down on the mattress. It’s ludicrous, that’s what this whole thing is.
“Don’t encourage him, darling,” Draco replied smoothly before Potter could. “Next thing you know, he’ll be yelling at everyone.”
Potter is in the Slytherin dungeons.
in Potions?"
your blood. He is looking for your blood. I need you to make a very important decision, Draco. I apologize if this is sudden. I did not expect… We did not…" Then, Severus cut himself off, aware that he was wasting time with his rambling. He looked straight in Draco's eyes. "You can either leave this room and I will not take any blood from you. I will respect your choice. Or…" At this, he looked straight in Draco's eyes. "You can give Harry what he needs."
As soon as she left, Draco turned to his father. He glanced back at Severus and Dumbledore, not sure about the things that he was allowed to ask in their presence. He opted for the safest one: "What happened?"
He looked out of the window, looking for Sirius and Remus in the sea of parents waving their children goodbye. He stood up from his seat and laughed to himself when he saw a black dog instead, looking straight at him with its tail wagging happily, totally uncaring of Remus who had a finger up and was probably scolding him for transforming out in public.
It’s been twenty-four hours, but Draco still hadn’t woken up.
and pointing to various directions, but never the correct one. Harry resolutely ignores the vendors selling pins and balloons with his face plastered on them. It isn’t even a flattering picture of him.
Draco's shoulders shook, and Harry almost panicked at the thought that he did something wrong – Draco probably thought he was a creep – until Harry turned to look at him, and he realized with amazement that Draco was
Remus waved it off with a hand. "Nonsense, Harry. Don't worry about me. If you ask me, you have other, more pressing matters to worry about. How were the mermaids?"
His father wasn't in Azkaban, which meant that they weren't in trouble with the Ministry. Draco guessed that they were under Professor Dumbledore's protection right now, which he hoped was right. If there was anyone that can stop the Dark Lord, it would be Professor Dumbledore… right?
Harry covered his ears with his hand, face cringing in pain. Crabbe suddenly jumped out of his bed and dropped onto the floor with a panicked shout.
Harry smiled at him weakly. "Yeah," he said, but he didn't know what exactly he was agreeing to or both. "Sorry, sorry, I'll –" he stopped, finding that he couldn't find his voice again but not because of some jinx. He swallowed down the lump in his throat and tried for his voice not to break once more. "I'll stay away," he whispered instead.
‘You’re under arrest, oh, cousin of mine.’
‘We have no time to collect possessions.’ McGonagall’s voice echoed his own thoughts. ‘The important thing is to get you out of here safely.’
Potter snorted, as though he was torn between laughter or a sigh and just elegantly chose to fail at both.
He pulled back, ignoring Vincent’s confused gaze.
He bit into his lip, refusing to scream. He felt the floor connect with his knees and the iron tang of blood in his mouth before the spell let up. He took a deep breath, forcing himself to his feet to meet his eye. Okay, he could try again. Ignoring the tremors of the aftershock of the curse he faced the Death Eater.
‘Where's Ginny?’ he said sharply. ‘She was here. She was supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.’
‘Merlin that’s confusing …’ he mumbled, trying to keep up with their blathering, how could they work a conversation about time relativity into such a ridiculous discussion?
From what he could translate from the stuttered Potterisms he – the him from the future who was stuck in the past – was pregnant with Potter spawn. In the war. Quite possibly headed to Azkaban. Though, probably not, the men around him had lived through it, they’d know if there had been a problem, wouldn’t they? Was that the way time travel worked? The extent of his knowledge on it was a short excerpt in a book about the use of time turners.
‘And … How do you feel about me now?’ Draco’s tone was earnest, desperate, begging for more honesty than Harry was ready for.
Was that really even a question? Of course, he’d take his head of house, his god father. Why hadn’t that bee the first option?
There were flashes of spells from down the corridor, shouts of curses and pain echoing through the halls. They’d made it into Hogwarts. He knew it was up to that time of night but Merlin, he was so ready for this to be done.
His fingers scrambled against the stone wall, ignoring the streaks of blood he left as he managed to drag himself to his feet. None of the attention was on his embarrassing attempt at least, the fight having drawn everyone’s attention.
‘Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.’
Still, no one trying to help him, but at least his last effort for the war hadn’t been wasted. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Severus looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes slackened.
‘We know you’re faking this whole thing.’
‘They’re on the other side.’
Harry knew it was bound to feel different, but he hadn’t known quite how different. He couldn’t look around the castle without seeing the scars of the battle. Burnt or damaged walls. All safe by now of course but they hadn’t had time to erase them completely. It almost wouldn’t feel right to have done it yet anyway.
‘It'll be all right,’ Hermione’s voice was wild, Draco wasn’t sure even she believed those words. ‘Let's- let's get back to the castle, if he's gone to the forest we'll need to think of a new plan-’
‘Merlin Potter, you don’t date someone because you
‘But don't you realize?’ whispered Hermione. ‘This means, if we can just get the snake –’
His stomach was churning, deep breaths and not throwing up were his only aims at the moment. Hermione charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she got in range.
‘You’re calling her fat?’ That was ridiculous, sure, in comparison to Draco’s lean muscles maybe, but really, who could compare to that?
‘C-Crabbe,’ Draco managed, choked on ash and tears, he knew the answer, but he still had to ask; he was meant to have saved him. ‘C-Crabbe...’
‘What do you want for Christmas?’ He had wanted to work it in casually, somehow it still ended up blurted out, but it worked to change the topic at least.
Draco glanced back as the Ravenclaw table began to clear out, leaving a handful of older students seated, determined to join the battle. The Slytherin table was completely empty. That would be remembered, even if none of them had ‘Dumbledore’s Army’ training, even though the precious Order of the Phoenix wouldn’t have let them stay if they tried. The Slytherin’s wouldn’t be able to shake off the blame of this moment for a long time.
‘I don’t
‘Congratulations!’ They cheered as one, bursting poppers over the top of his and Potter’s head.
Harry shoved the books and paper back into his bag, heading to the door. He paused, hand on the handle, not quite ready to leave.
He twisted and lunged for the toilet just in time, hurling what little food he’d had today into the water.
Shit. No. This wasn’t meant to happen.
Dramatic, yes.
He couldn’t keep track of days here. It was a particular type of torture.
Malfoy shrugged, settling down beside him, watching as he began laying out his books, but he didn’t disagree with him.
Percy and Ron dropped to Fred’s side, clinging to him though he was the least injured of the lot of them. It really helped to have a human shield in these moments. He ignored Harry’s eyes on him, he didn’t have time. There was one life left. He couldn’t save Vince for himself but there was no way he was going to let Severus slip through his fingers. He had to get there before Voldemort, before Harry, before that fucking giant snake.
‘-consider us in.’
May 1998.
He quickly got changed, surprised at how natural it felt to still pull on his uniform, working his way around the boys’ bathroom to get ready for the day as quickly as he could. He paused about to slick gel through his hair. Harry preferred it without it, he’d grown it out a little so it wouldn’t really suit anyway.
Voldemort's tone was musing, calm, from the flicker of Severus’ face he could read the fury building behind it.
Draco woke bathed in murky, green light filtered through the water of the Great Lake, in the Slytherin dorms, the calendar pulled to the worst day of his life: 2
‘And, you don’t have them for her?’ There was something in his voice that suggested he should have an answer, but it was subtle enough to be ignored, gentle enough to question rather than push.
Draco could have confirmed but he really didn’t have the strength. The boy they were talking about was an idiot, sure, but he was dead. There was no reason to rub in insults now.
‘Merry Christmas.’
‘My Lord, there can be no question, surely –?’
But it was his turn again, as though holding the script for a play that no one else knew they were a part of.
Draco didn’t seem to have the same issue.
Shit, he had to do it.
That all went in his favour, they’d had enough punishment at this point. He got to be the poster child for rehabilitation.
‘I tried …’ He croaked, curling in on himself as he gasped for breath through his tears. ‘I did my fucking best …’
Those fuckers, one scared girl from a table who’s families were standing on the other side waiting for death. They didn’t have a good choice here. It wasn’t ‘us and them’ for most of them, it was a choice of who’d they die for. Black and white was a luxury they weren’t afforded.
Hearing the word “friends” from them like that was … off-putting. But they observed him with narrowed eyes, careful and calculating, watching for his reaction. It was a remarkably Slytherin look for two die-hard Gryffindors. He might be able to make this work.
‘My Lord!’ Snape protested, raising his wand.
‘It cannot be any other way, I must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.’
He’d asked McGonagall about it, as soon as the dust had settled enough. Apparently, the room hadn’t burnt the corridor. It hadn’t been seen since. They hadn’t recovered a body. He’d stopped asking about it pretty quickly. He couldn’t stomach hearing it again.
Lights sprung out of the plastic bottles, dancing around the air above them, flashing like miniature fireworks as they squealed their cheers. Draco winced, backing away from them, why was everything created by Weasley Wizard Wheezes so damn loud and annoying?
‘So, you’ll stay?’
Draco grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; he was so heavy, he couldn’t believe he’d done this the first time. The temptation to drop him and bolt was almost overwhelming, but he was not going to let anyone new die. With no wand, no time, nothing changed he might not be able to save Vince, but Greg wasn’t going to go down’ with him.
‘You liked her?’ Harry snorted, eyes shifting back to the ghost in front of him.
‘If you are of age, you may stay.’ She seemed proud to, agreeing to let children walk to their deaths, he liked McGonagall now, but he wasn’t sure he’d ever understand what was going through her mind in this moment.
Merlin, Potter was ripped.
Draco smiled, a sparkle in his eyes at the words. He took a step towards Harry again before letting the smile fall sad, still pulling his lips up at the ends but it felt tragic.
If what Harry said was true then Voldemort had lost, his side had lost!
GODRIC NO!
‘Harry?’ shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wad. ‘What's going on?’
The hesitation was enough. The rest of the students had already passed, sending Blaise out into the corridors on his own would be like signing his death warrant, he was a Slytherin so both sides wouldn’t hesitate to fire at him. He bit his lip, staring at his three accomplices.
‘I’m calling her female.’ He answered simply, waiting for Harry to catch on to the conversation they were actually having.
He looked around the room thoughtfully, it didn’t look like he was considering it for the first time.
‘Ghosts have to move on eventually Potter … Harry … and I don’t have much left holding me here.’
And in absence of that someone, he’d be willing to settle for the Weasleys. Even if their only commending feature was that they weren’t Potter. That was a pretty big plus right now.
‘Fiendfyre – cursed fire – it's one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it's so dangerous – how did Crabbe know how to –?’
Harry would come. He was late, later than he remembered, but he’d come. He cared. And he was so good at saving him. He wouldn’t miss this opportunity.
He turned away; pointing his wand at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance, with the great serpent floating after him in its huge protective sphere.
--- means slight time jump within that section.*
‘...my Lord, their resistance is crumbling –’
He could see the tattoo; he’d cast the glamour. All they saw was the snake and skull. Not a great impression to give.
Even with his steps his breathing wasn’t working right. How the fuck did he usually take five seconds with each breath in and out? He gasped it in in a second, desperate to fill his lungs. It left him with a wheeze, sucked from his body just as fast.
Any topic would do at this point.
He drew himself up, breaking open some blood replenishing potions and swallowing them smoothly, the colour and strength returning to him after two more unknown potions.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. The twins were known for doing that kind of shit, but something about that was too smooth, too planned.
He wanted to argue, wanted to correct them. What had happened the first time should have happened again. It was no use though. He knew what he’d changed. If Potter didn’t come for him then why would he have come for his mother.
Draco turned to stare at him and Harry shifted to glare back, daring him to argue. Obviously, Draco still managed. Arguing was one of the few things he could still do.
He closed his eyes and reached out to the handle that had appeared, swinging the door open to a luscious, large,
As the other two tables cleared out to follow behind Draco heard McGonagall’s voice once more.
‘We should work together on the potions essay tonight. I know you have your books, but you haven’t even opened them yet, have you?’ The answer must have been in his eyes because she clicked her tongue in disapproval and continued on, ‘Right, well, I’ve only just completed my first draft, so I’d be happy to spend a few hours tonight going over it with you.’
His progress was slow. The blood from his shoulder dripped against stone, but he didn’t get nearly far enough before he was stopped. He didn’t know how long he’d taken; he didn’t know if Severus would even still be alive at this point. With a wand pointed at his face his options were fairly limited.
‘What if they name their kid Draco, then he’ll be Draco Junior.’ Excellent point two-eared-twin, though seriously, who gives their son their name as a first name?
Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down at the man he hated. Severus’ eyes found Harry’s and he wheezed through a gurgle of blood as he tried to speak, his bloodied hand clutching the front of his student’s robes as he dragged him forward, pulling him close enough to try again.
Harry used the moment distraction to lunge for the tiara, but Vince wasn’t quite that slow.
It seemed empty.
‘He does want to be an Auror, don’t you Harry? We’ll have each other’s backs. Besides, once you’ve defeated the greatest known evil anything else will be a walk in the park. Right Harry?’ Ron nudged his other side and got the same supportive smile.
Harry’s face cracked into a grin, eyes flicking open and locking on the cocky ghost leaning against the wall.
‘There’s fucking life Severus! You know how hard that can be! He needs someone! He needs fucking family!’
His breathing began to shake, and he stared into the light for a moment, holding his breath before he felt he could begin again. One, two, three, four, five – in – one, two, three, four, five – out –
A stunning spell flew over his shoulder, he could feel Harry’s power and turned before he could think, a half-insane, giddy smile on his face, ignoring how his body wavered at the turn. Before he spotted Harry a fist connected with his face. He could feel the blood dripping down his chin as he allowed himself to fall backwards. Oh yes, this moment.
There was enough exasperation in Draco’s tone to make Harry turn to face him. Their gazes locked once more, Draco’s outline trembling as he continued.
‘Moving right along.’ Draco looked away awkwardly, gritting his teeth to continue the conversation. ‘What’s your problem with her?’
The room Draco woke up in wasn’t familiar. It had enough touches to feel like something he’d see at home, but it wasn’t. He knew it wasn’t. He was still there.
‘What else is there?’
‘Don’t be naïve Draco, the list of people who will grieve me begins and ends with the man standing in front of me now. I’m glad I got the chance to say goodbye to you, but with this my duty to Potter ends. So, yes, I intend to leave.’
‘What the fuck are you doing here.’ He hissed when they were close enough, glaring the twins down, glancing quickly around the room to try to find out who was here to pick him up.
A whispered ‘Nox’ and the light disappeared. Draco knew that to look for, what to listen for, so once again he dragged himself to his feet, bloodier again, weaker again, but still moving. He snatched the wand from the fallen Death Eater, at least now he had something, even if it felt as though it was rebelling in his hand.
As though called the guards came. Draco couldn’t help the sigh of relief. That meant it was time for the trial. He would get to see Harry; he would get out of here. The expression earnt him a particularly brutal shove from one of the Aurors leading him to the court room.
‘What’s wrong with that?’ If Harry hadn’t been stuck so far in defensive mode, he would have picked up on the meaning behind that comment earlier, at least that’s what he told himself afterwards.
‘Okay, fine. Bored or nervous?’ Harry caved, they were the only two reasons he’d heard Malfoy rambling in here, he liked to think he’d gotten good at reading him.
‘I think it would for you. It likes you Harry.’ He answered slowly, thoughtfully.
‘Sorry- I mean- you don’t have to answer.’ Harry picked up his own parchment awkwardly staring at the blank page as though it held all the answers to his OWLS.
Draco winced, there was so much he hadn’t remembered. He knew how much she regretted those words now. A panicked response in a moment of desperation, one life for possibly hundreds … but when that one life ended up being the one that saved the world … when it was the Chosen One … Merlin, she still hadn’t lived it down. He had to do better than that if he actually wanted to save some lives today.
Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been given a reprieve: but then Voldemort's intention became clear. The snake's cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.
He wanted to start working on a way out of here. A way to confirm his timeline and get the hell back to it. Instead of that, he got to stare at the cracked cement of his cell and hope the malnutrition wasn’t doing damage to the baby. Not quite how he’d expected the start of being pregnant. Harry would have been over the top, maybe painfully so. Running out the second he asked for anything. He probably could have gotten him to Apparate half-way around the world if there was something specific he was craving.
Draco frowned very slightly, the corners of his mouth twitching as he tried to keep his face as neutral as possible, he was surprisingly good at reading what Harry needed in the moments he wanted to try.
‘Fine, maybe. But not now. I have to get some credit for what I feel now.’ It was the only argument Harry could think of, and something in it lit a spark in Draco’s eyes.
His mind came up empty.
Hermione dove aside, no harm done, but he could see the fury growing in Harry’s eyes that his friend had been targeted, with that spell. Compared to what was going outside it was nothing, but it seemed like everything to him in this second. Harry shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Draco’s wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones. Great, wandless again. He knew that was it, he wouldn’t get a new one before the end of the battle and he still had lives to save.
‘You will explain to me afterwards?’
A strong hand landed on his shoulder, spinning him around to face Blaise. There was a moment of relief that he was okay, followed by annoyance that he’d interrupted what he knew was an important moment. This was the moment Harry decided to give him a chance. Adrenaline rushing through both of them, both of them alive. They needed this moment to open that path.
Draco scoffed. ‘Fantastic, I have the stamp of approval from the Weasleys, my life is complete.’
‘Azkaban.’ The verdict was passed, it wasn’t enough, the fear from the first trial flooded, ice-cold through his veins.
When the Weasley’s showed up it was with their typical, obnoxiously wide, grins – that was expected – their first words were less so.
‘Yes.’ His voice croaked, damaged from disuse.
‘So, your choice now is running away? Letting everyone who cares about you think you’re dead?’
That was terrifying from him.
Timeline B – who the fuck knew where he’d end up.
Did he even know there was a missing ear?
‘Right, lucky I could answer this in first year, the books you got are rubbish. Let’s focus the discussion on pewter cauldrons, they have the best volatile reactions with almost half the healing potion bases.’
‘He’s dead.’ Draco shot back, a perfect mimic of Ron’s earlier words and tone. Because fuck him!
‘I’ve been sleeping more and more when you’re not here. But- well- it’s not like sleep. Not really. It’s kind of waiting. Or … moving. Closer and closer to … not here.’ His voice was less steady than before, it had a more Luna Lovegood vibe to it.
‘What’s wrong, babe?’ He yawned, arm patting the empty side of the bed for the blanket.
As soon as they were out of sight Ginny waved her friend away down the corridor and turned to talk to him, Harry got there first though.
(See the end of the chapter for
He twisted the antivenom in his pocket that he’d stolen from the potion stores earlier that day. This would have to be enough. It would have to be soon enough once it was done. He’d never seen the body but Harry had told him what had happened. He’d said it wasn’t eaten so there should still be a decent chance.
‘Well, the day you went to the past was the day you got knocked up. At least, the you that came back was pregnant. So, we knew that it was coming when we started trying. So … that’s why they … I mean, we are-‘
The more he thought about it the more he spiralled away. The other thing that they’d slowly bonded over was being there for Teddy. He had his parents now-
‘I just … feel like it’s a good day.’
Harry looked away first this time, trying to convince himself not to say what was in his head, but Malfoy had let him in on his thought process, they were being honest with each other. He may as well give this a try. This was the exact kind of thing that he stopped himself from saying to his friends. The kind of thing that had started building the distance between them. Malfoy was simultaneously more and less important to him, and in just the right way to give him the strength to voice the thought.
‘Sorry?’ Harry murmured, still staring at the tiara.
‘I think you should be alive … not me.' He stormed into the room, what an opener; spending so much time with Draco had improved his flair for the dramatics.
He liked her, he had to remember he liked her. Draco stood, arm wrapping around Pansy in comfort as the rest of their peer pushed back from the benches and dragged themselves out of the hall.
Hermione continued with barely a glance at them. ‘Let's stick together. I say we go – Harry, what's that on your arm?’
He schooled his expression, feeling the Malfoy mask that he’d abandoned years ago fall into place as he led Vince and Greg through the labyrinth of junk to where he knew he was. Harry was leaning up the side of a pile, reaching towards a stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient, discoloured tiara. His hand was outstretched, almost touching it. This was the right moment.
‘Malfoy … you seriously … you saved me?’
Snape did not speak. He knew the danger he was in, at the moment he lacked the right words to reassure his master. Draco wanted to reach him, wanted so badly to help. He closed his eyes, this part he had to let play out.
He paced in front of the wall, he’d done this so many times before, he knew he could do it again.
‘But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourself–’
‘We knew he was. That’s why we like him after all.’ Big ear laughed.
Harry grinned, scribbling across the page as Malfoy spoke. This was a much better way of doing homework. Hermione would be thrilled and shocked to see what he’d actually managed to do, and it did actually seem like it was sticking in his mind. Malfoy had a theatrical way of speaking that was easy to listen to. A dramatic way of explaining what and why that let him understand what he was actually talking about.
The thought kept spiralling
‘Great, that’s just great. Exactly what I wanted to hear.’ He sighed, catching himself before mimicking Potter’s gesture of hand through his hair.
‘My Lord–’
‘The Cloak!’ Hermione hissed. ‘Put the Cloak on!’
‘What the actual fuck?!’
Potter’s face fell, he was disappointed, or maybe even upset at the response? He refused to take it back though. Staying with Severus would be a giant improvement. It would be safe, normal, give him a second to get his feet under him. If that was an option
‘DrayDray? He’s the second so he gets two?’ Nothing was going to stop them.
As he passed Draco he pressed a simple ring into his hand.
‘Potter came in here to get it,’ Malfoy scolded, with ill-disguised impatience, it was like talking to a child, no, actually, Teddy would have been much more understanding.  ‘so that must mean – ‘ he prompted sarcastically.
Draco fell asleep wrapped in the warm arms of Harry, naked, satisfied. The fertility potion vial was empty on the bedside table. He placed his hand over Harry’s, resting on his stomach; long pale fingers weaving through strong, tanned ones. Maybe this time.
Severus’ eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in it’s enchanted cage, part of him knew what was coming.
Harry reached out, his fingers brushing through the air just off Draco’s translucent cheek.
They waited impatiently until Draco finally decided it had been long enough. He nodded and Vince lunged forward, glaring when there was no door for him to charge through. Draco sighed and shoved him back, maybe he’d been a bit generous to the Vince in his memories, he really was an idiot.
The crowd gasped as the young Death Eater flashed the mark to the room, smiling gently down at it.
He doubled over. It didn’t help. He knew it didn’t help. It did the opposite of help. But his head was starting to spin. He couldn’t think clearly. He couldn’t make himself walk down.
‘You actually are joking, Perce.... I don't think I've heard you joke since you were –’
Fuck, no, this wasn’t how it happened.
‘You sure about this?’ Blaise’s usually steady, controlled voice tremored in his ear.
Tonks and Lupin
‘I’ve done what I can to protect him in this war…’ Severus replied cautiously, but he was giving him the chance to speak which meant there was a chance he could stop him.
‘I wouldn’t have flown back if I’d known.’ This time it was Harry’s turn to look away beneath the gaze of the other. ‘I only went back because it was you.’ He hoped there would be no further questions, he wasn’t sure how to answer anything that followed on from that.
He clamped a hand over his mouth, the problem was too much oxygen, not not enough. He forced himself to breath through his nose, limiting his intake. It wasn’t pleasant. It took a while for his body to believe it wasn’t just dying. But it worked.
‘Harry, let's get out, let's get out!’
He didn’t have an answer for that. It was another thing he had to leave, only one thing he could really offer:
He knew that.
‘If this is a bloody bathroom …’ He groaned to himself. His hand tightening around the doorknob.
‘They'll be all right,’ Harry managed, his words sounded empty, but Ginny needed to hear something. ‘Ginny, we'll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe – come on!’
They’d both been left on their own, but his mother didn’t have anything of Harry from the future to save her. He wasn’t even sure how long it would protect him for really. He wasn’t free, he was on parole. As soon as they had an excuse, as soon as they had another option, he’d be where they thought be belonged.
‘Everything.’ Harry glanced over at him the closed his eyes. ‘Tell me everything you’d be doing while I do nothing.’
It was weird having his own little Malfoy … ghost … secret. By Christmas he’d adjusted and almost wasn’t sure how he’d managed without it … without him.
That wasn’t right.
‘I’ll explain what I can.’ He agreed.
He tried to ignore the pouting ghost in the corner of his vision, but that was harder than it sounded. He might be translucent, as thin as air and dead, but he was still Draco-bloody-Malfoy, and Harry had never been able to ignore him.
‘We have to run. The Death Eaters are running!’ He urged frantically. Draco shrugged him off, turning to see that Harry had already turned away, already caught up in someone else’s conversation.
‘What about our things?’ called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. ‘Our trunks, our owls?’
‘Could be misconstrued. I’d hate to disappoint someone when they realised he didn’t have that on offer.’
‘-you couldn’t have our Harry otherwise.’
Harry laughed softly, covering the shake of his breath at their proximity. Their arms were almost touching. Where he should have felt the warmth of him, he could barely make out the chill, the only sign that anything of Draco was still there with him.
Harry wasn’t actually sure he was moving in the right direction there.
When one thing went wrong. Every fucking thing did.
He paced the corridor, waiting for the door to appear. Just like the first time, he didn’t really think of anything in particular. The Room knew what he needed, and he didn’t actually know if the Room had the magic left to form anything specific. It didn’t really matter anyway.
When he’d circled back in the room, it had been for Malfoy. He’d risked his life for Malfoy. Ron had followed him as though he was doing what was best. Ron got Goyle on his broom no problem. They were heading to the exit before Harry had even turned around.
‘Aguamenti!’ Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air, a stream of water against this was less than nothing.
With everything going on he hadn’t had a hell of a lot of time to admire that kind of thing. Now hardly seemed like the time to start but he was warm beneath the shirt. Hard. Nice.
The twins shared a look. He didn’t know them very well, but he knew what that look meant. The Weasley’s were all terrible at sharing bad news. Fred was the one stuck with the job this time, decided through whatever psychic negotiation passed between them.
He paced the corridor, shoes tapping a solid rhythm up and down the stone floors beneath the invisibility cloak. His mind was blank. He couldn’t think of the fire, he didn’t want that back. He just wanted to see that the room was still there. That there was something to mark Malfoy’s grave, even if no one else seemed to care.
No, there really was no other option, he’d just have to live it out and do his best to get everything back on track. He’d done it before, and he could damn well do it again. This time he was armed with information. For instance the fact that Harry, even Hogwarts Harry, had a few R rated dreams about him made him much more confident about this from the start.
It was the only response he could think to give. From the bright smile on Draco’s face, it was worth it.
‘It's that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!’
‘My Lord?’ Severus’ voice didn’t quiver, he’d forgotten how strong the man was.
Shit, shit, SHIT!!!
Fred taunted him on.
Potter wasn’t making this easy.
Draco’s eyes were glossy, he shook his head to cut off the thought, wincing as Harry’s fingertips slid through his cheek. Where they touched Harry could feel the cold, damp air, the only physical sense Harry could get of Draco’s existence. Draco jerked back violently.
Harry was left alone with his thoughts, which wasn’t where he wanted to be. Hermione and Ron had left with a barrage of questions. Ones, like all questions nowadays, that he couldn’t answer. Hermione’s were about assignments, taking the break to fix Grimmauld place deciding on his career path for life. Ron’s were about Ginny.
He lent down, purring in his ear ‘Baby, I need you now…’ And that did it. He basically flew straight out of the bed, staring at him, wide awake.
‘No Potter, too … shapely for me.’ Draco drawled back with an eye roll, he called him Potter, he was getting annoyed too.
‘-not the house, just a painted bitch.’
‘Someone needs to explain. Now.’
‘You okay over there?’
‘STOP!’ Draco screamed at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room. ‘The Dark Lord wants him alive –’ This was terrifying, he knew how it was meant to go but one wrong move, one thing different and Harry could die, the Dark Lord could win. It was worse now than the first time around knowing what he was risking with each move.
‘My – my lord?’ Snape controlled his tone, offering no emotion apart from the calculated curiosity to his question. ‘I do not understand. You – you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.’
‘Why doesn't it work for me, Severus?’
Stupid bloody experiments, he would have been much better at being a spoilt, rich socialite. Why exactly did he decide he had to work? And in the Department of Mysteries?! He swore under his breath, trying to calm himself down but he’d never really been good at that. He needed Harry.
Through the smoke he saw the two brooms soar into the air, heard Ron’s voice bellow over the roaring flames.
‘-Potter, please tell me you’re cottoning on to theme of today’s performance?’
A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat.
So no, not his past’s body, his current body in the past. Thank Merlin that his glamour work was strong. It should last a week if not interrupted. So, he was three years older and not as sickly thin as he’d been the first time going through this. That was interesting … and completely unprecedented.
He glared at them to accompany his growl.
‘The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.’
To his side a figure rose, by the time he glanced across it was too late to stop her. Pansy Parkinson raised a shaking arm and screamed,
‘Do you bare the Dark Mark?’
At least he was entertaining Draco. Complaining about his potential girlfriend troubles to the boy he had a crush on … smooth.
There was a reason he was his best friend after all, willing to take him at his word when he needed it, even if they both suspected it was a bit of a lie. He smiled at Hermione.
‘What job … or …’ He asked carefully, looking over the forms again.
He should have let them all die. But, as he watched the bodies that should have been lying in the great hall embrace Harry, as he watched the smile bloom across his husband-to-be’s face, he couldn’t fault his choice. Even as the Auror’s dragged him away. Draco Malfoy was smiling.
‘I’ll- I’m taking you to the Dark Lord. Get up!’
But maybe they didn’t have to.
‘Yeah.’
‘What the fuck Draco?!’
The room he was in was dimly lit, Nagini was swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in mid-air. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand.
‘Of course.’
Potter sat up, pulling the blanket over himself as he actually opened his eyes and looked at him properly.
‘We have to go.’
Severus
‘No one? My mum shouldn’t have been tried; she was released-’
‘Seriously? Just like that?’ He knew Gryffindor’s were foolish but he’d never expected it to work in his favour.
‘What? Oh yeah –’
Harry couldn’t stop laughing, that was a great scene to imagine, the Malfoy poise on a pogo stick.
‘How do you even know what a pogo stick is?’
‘You two, the Golden Trio went to the Room of Requirement with everyone else. Use a Disillusionment charm and wait there. Call us using these the second the three of them step out.’ He cast a quick charm on three galleons, handing one to Greg and one to Blaise, handy trick Hermione, thanks. ‘Remember the Dark Lord wants him alive so don’t do anything until I get there to help. Got it?’
‘Do you though?’ The dark gaze was intense.
No, no this couldn’t be happening. He could still bloody fix this-
‘This sounds like a scheme-’
That was a painful truth to come to terms with.
It was somewhat entertaining to watch Ron simultaneously try to set up his best friend and protect his sister’s innocence, but it wasn’t worth the awkwardness.
No, he didn’t want a bedroom, he wanted a nice room he could study in. Something comfortable for Draco to live in. The basics, table, couch, chair, maybe a fireplace? That could be nice. The flickering light across Draco’s pale face, romantic. No shit no. Basics, what are the basic things in a room. A bed. A large double bed for him and Draco.
The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist –
Three days later. He’d been counting this time.
‘But he's there! Potter's there. Someone grab him!’
‘What are you doing, what are you doing, the door's that way!’ His scream turned to a choking cough as he got through the panic. Harry ignored him, making a hairpin swerve and dived.
There was a chance Draco could be left behind, moved to wherever the things in the Room of Lost Things used to go. So, he knew what to focus on. A room, one he wanted, with Draco in it.
‘So how come you three aren't with Voldemort?’
The hat had placed very few people in the Slytherin House this year. From the whispers in the corridors, it seemed like they’d all begged it not to. He wanted to argue with them. Wanted to shout at them that there was nothing wrong with the damned house, if that’s where they belonged then that’s where they should go. He couldn’t say it though. Even if no one knew how much of a hypocrite it made him.
‘Sorry babe. As soon as I can, I promise.’
Severus blinked in shock, his eyes quickly locking on his godson.
A room with Draco in it.
‘They’re the only other ones who know about this … the only other people you’ve told.’
There was a pause, a change in tone to something more personal, more terrifying.
‘You can’t! I’m pregnant!’ He screamed, the desperation in his voice giving the guards pause before anyone in the room processed his words.
There was doubt in his eyes again, the desire to argue. He shook his head, glaring, but listening to Draco one last time. He didn’t have power over him anymore, they both knew it, but without a better plan on offer he’d at least work with him for now.
‘Ron and Hermione want me to join the Aurors …’ It was the only answer he had so far.
‘Bo-ored …’ he whined, looking over Harry’s shoulder at the half-filled parchment. ‘I even miss bloody homework. How sad is that?’
‘And after that?’
Draco clapped enthusiastically. ‘I didn’t think I’d live to see the day - Figuratively speaking of course - he can be taught.’
Draco couldn’t understand it, but from the following actions the command was clear.
A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment's warning. He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them.
‘Tonks,’ poor Ginny twisted to call out to her, ‘Tonks, I'm sure he's okay – ‘
No good deed goes unpunished.
His imagination just wasn’t that good.
‘That’s so creepy, you know that, right?’ Malfoy called out, his laughter breaking the sneer of his tone.
Draco tumbled from the broom, hands clawing at the cool stone of the corridor floor as he coughed and retched the ash and smoke out of his lungs, violently scrubbing the tears from his checks even as they kept falling. To his side Harry sat up, staring back at the closed door. Slightly further down lay Ron and Hermione, panting on the floor and then Greg, quiet for once, still unconscious.
‘I don’t know. I just kind of … feel it?’
His breath was coming in too fast. He couldn’t remember how to breath slower. How could people take air in in any way other than desperate gasps? It just flooded in and he needed more and-
It hurt to look at the Slytherin table.
‘Shut it Potter, just … give me something else next time? I’m sick of only having an empty, burnt room and your ugly face to look at.’
The twins lent forward.
Fuck!
Draco spotted his wand on his bedside table and lunged forward, clutching it in a shaky hand as he raised it to aim at the Chosen One.
The instructions had finally come, he even had someone out there waiting to take him home. At least that’s what the note said, crumpled in the Auror’s fat fist the second he’d finished reading it out loud to him.
He was within his own timeline so could potentially kill himself early but not erase. There was probably some comfort in that.
Greg and Vince would just get in the way for Part A, so they had to be distracted for now.
He couldn’t lie to her. The second he shook his head she’d shut down. She’d lied to Voldemort, he was the reason he was dead after all, but he felt like that was the second Malfoy he let die that day. He’d visited her afterwards, back at Malfoy Manor. She was barely a shell of the woman she’d been.
‘Potter!’
All that got him was a few extra glares. No idea whether that was from the swearing, the screaming, the name he’d thrown out or just that he had the nerve to keep asking, but he kept going anyway.
Malfoy’s head swung back to look at him, silver eyes steely and resolved in a way Harry had only seen once before.
Harry stared at the application forms in front of him. He wasn’t even sure which one he’d start filling in. He had offers for some quidditch teams, Bill had made curse breaking sound good, some offers at the Ministry (ew, no), Healer apprenticeships could be a nice change from fighting, and the Aurors, obviously.
Christmas day, Harry paced the corridor, trying to picture it. A room he required, one that he really wanted. He needed the emotion to convince the room to bother changing for him.
Draco fell asleep bathed in murky, green light filtered through the water of the Great Lake, in the Slytherin dorms. The chill of the dungeons settled in his bones, the fear of the day to come chilling him to his soul. He closed his eyes, half hoping he wouldn’t have to open them again.
Draco grinned back, just a relieved to be in safe territory.
He didn’t remember this part. Had it happened the first time or was this something he’d changed? He started with his go to sneer.
‘Not anymore,’ panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. ‘Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who's lent you theirs?’
How much of that fight had he seen, obviously not the end if he hadn’t mentioned the Dolohov drowned in soil part.
‘I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,’ his voice was just as brittle and pained as the first time he’d said it. ‘I know how to get in.’
‘Never mind. What about you. What will you do?’
The second they were outside the castle walls they were embraced into the chaos of screams and spells. They clung to each other with one arm, wands raised and heads down as they moved between fighting bodies.
‘Ahh right … why start off light, let’s jump straight to the most painful one.’ He settled back, taking a few bats to drag a book to in front of him so he could stare at the pages instead of looking at Harry.
After the war, after all that loss, he respected the meaning of second chances.
He woke up with a decent amount of sanity, of clarity. Then he saw Potter and … well … it went downhill from there. By the end of some days he almost thought that this might be an okay life. An okay future. Maybe even one to aim for?
He’d royally fucked up this time travel thing. If he could, by some miracle, work out a way to go into the future there’s no telling if that would mean he’d just take this body and suddenly be missing for years or if he’d suddenly remember a separate past. In either of them he didn’t think he’d end up with Harry and there was too much to risk there.
No eighth years from Slytherin had returned this year, but the absence in the one seat that Harry’s eyes had always been drawn to seemed more significant than the others. The rest were nothing, just blank, empty spaces, but when his eyes flickered to where he knew there should be cold grey eyes staring back at him, he could feel the gap.
‘He was duelling Dolohov,’ shouted Aberforth, ‘haven't seen him since!’
Issues with that were that he’s obviously stepped into his past’s body or swapped places with it since there wasn’t another Draco Malfoy lingering around the battle. He blinked through blurry eyes, checking the dark twisted mark on his arm and – yup – it had his newer tattoos twisted around it, covering the shape with a Luna original. His body, back in time. An exchange then.
Draco whimpered, anguished, frustrated, maybe just a little happy to hear it. Harry went to take another step forward, but what would it do? He couldn’t touch him, couldn’t hold him, couldn’t plan anything with him. There wasn’t enough time left before the end of term. Only days until he’d leave him.
“The one that Professor Dumbledore destroyed in his office was Marvolo Gaunt’s Ring,” Harry said while thoughtfully chewing on his beefsteak. He knew full well that these were
When they pulled apart, Ginny's eyes were bright.
“I can’t imagine you in Slytherin, either.”
And Draco found that he had started to enjoy Potter's company. It was much better than moping around alone with his thoughts.
"Slughorn probably wouldn't bat an eyelash."
as he scooped Draco up in his arms.
The Dursleys gave him food too but always leftovers and canned soup that never tasted nice.
Dumbledore’s eyes turned downcast towards the wood of his desk. He sighed then, and Snape realized with a bit of a start that Dumbledore actually looked…
Draco looked like he was struggling not to look uncomfortable. His cheeks were tinted pink, and he shifted in his seat, fingers nervously playing with the pages. Harry blinked in confusion.
Sometimes, he
"And what,
He was thrown back in time and he knew that it was before the summer that he was to meet Draco, knew it through the way the magic – remnants of his time travel – shimmered around him and told him the things he needed to know.
Six-year-old Harry Potter figured there was something weird about the man in black. He didn’t make Harry weed the garden or sleep in the cupboard or wash the dishes or clean the floor. He gave Harry
Harry was still reeling from the pain. Behind him, he could hear someone moving, footsteps on the ground, something stirring, and stone clanking against stone. Cedric's body was twenty feet away. He was dead. Harry couldn't believe it.
Where do they go home now? Where can they
Harry sunk lower on the couch, sulky.
Malfoy opens his hands, stares at his palms, clean and pristine, and takes another shaky inhale. “
Draco sighed. "Alright. Him."
It really shouldn't have surprised him that the whole Hogwarts population now knew that Harry Potter was under the infamous Lip-Lock Jinx, but the outburst that greeted him still made him freeze. There were a lot of whistles and catcalls, and a lot of "Kiss
Draco knows why. But he’s not going to tell Potter that.
Harry imagines then of mornings, of Draco alone in his room, staring at the garden. Coming and going, but still returning to the same scene where there are flowers in his garden but no one to talk to.
, but
He wakes up to a sudden breath-freshening charm and lips pressing down on his own and prying it open. Immediately, he succumbs and opens his mouth, opens himself up and lets himself be gathered in his lover’s arms.
Harry shrugged.
“While you have been snoring and drooling on your pillow,” Draco had snarled. “I have spent all day theorizing about your abduction by Scandinavian Goblins!”
What greeted him was the sight of Harry Potter in the living room with a blanket around his shoulders and his own mug of chocolate in hand.
"I…" Potter looked down at his lap. "Sorry."
Ron tore his gaze away from the cat and sighed heavily. He donned the demeanour that he always uses whenever he is about to impart on his wisdom and clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezing it firmly.
No one else, except…
Then, Severus sighed. "I had forgotten how restless teenagers could be," he muttered. (He realized that it was because Harry never complained about having to stay inside.
It was probably his crying – a big man crying and sobbing his heart out – that prevented Harry from flinching away from the sudden touch.
“I don’t really care about what Harry Potter those people are imagining,” Potter is murmuring. “This Harry Potter
Third, he was surprised to find that he was… disappointed. This was the most exciting thing that has happened in his life ever since the Time Turner, and the thrill of flying, being chased by a dragon, swimming under the Great Lake… Less conspiratorial whispers behind his back, other students in Hogwarts actually saying hi to him, slowly getting more friends…
a friend.
, but the other was a full-grown adult!) through the water with him, and
he wrote, repeating his statement from that morning.
sound like what Voldemort used to do.”
"Whatever you're going to say, I don't want to hear it," he said firmly.
Harry nodded, even though the action wouldn’t be seen. He was tired. He wanted to go home and think. Or sleep, so that he wouldn’t
“Would
But he knew he wasn't going to be able to get back to sleep for a while.
Draco berated himself
Harry’s eyes widened. He looked up at the man, unable to keep the excitement from his voice. “
Harry gave her a pointed look, almost hurt.
“Potter.”
Harry’s cheeks warmed. “Yes.”
His voice was steady and firm.
Ron stood up from his.
Draco scrambled to his feet, gathering the Invisibility Cloak in his arms. He spoke, nervous and eyes wide, "I just… I just wanted to see Potter…"
“I won’t let you do it.”
With a wince, he stretched his bent knees and stood up. Ignoring the slight pinch of pain, he jogged to catch up with Harry.
But walking out of the tent and into the arena was even
"I am fine," Lucius said firmly. "The Malfoys are fine, as we have always been."
Harry shoves pancakes in his mouth. He’s learned that Draco tries to be difficult on purpose, and the best way to deal with him when he’s being a slimy sod is to ignore that he’s being a slimy sod. He thinks he should be awarded for his discovery and canonized for his patience. “Did you have a good fucking sleep?”
He turns away, from Draco’s soft hair and the memories of fire.
Sirius cackled over a certain edition with a fictitious drawing of Harry Potter on the cover. “Look, Harry, they drew you with a pointy nose! It’s even pointier than Snivellus’!”
“I told you, I tripped.”
But no, he’s just getting worse, and Potter’s angry, and he misses the Manor, and the garden, and breakfast, and Potter.
Lupin took both suitcases and put them in the pocket of his trousers. “Thank you,” he whispered earnestly and glanced down at Harry, who still had Black all over him but was now looking at the two of them in confusion. Lupin wore his best smile and directed it at Harry, even as he spoke his words for Snape. “And for Harry.”
the whole of Beauxbatons already knew that Pansy had a crush on Draco Malfoy. The Durmstrang students seemed either rather thick in the head or rather too obsessed with their Viktor Krum to care about other things. Hell, Harry was sure that
When he woke up, it was to the white ceiling of the Hospital Wing. He and the white ceiling of the Hospital Wing had grown to have a very loving relationship with each other. Harry visited often (more often then he liked, if he was to be honest) and the white ceiling kept him company whenever he'd be confined and gave him comfort by… well… alright , so the white ceiling wasn't very comforting.
owe you anything. You still owe me for that gillyweed and that detention." Draco huffed, conveniently omitting the fact that it was his father that told him to give Potter the gillyweed in compliance with some Dark plan that Draco had yet to ask about.
He knew Remus wouldn’t get a wink of sleep either.
“Oh?” Potter asks curiously, taking off his robes and throwing it on his bed without preamble, as if he lives here. Draco likes it.
Nothing happened.
Theodore took notice of their conversation as well, and shouted over the crowd with a grin. "I'll bet you didn't think that when you got that ring of yours in a Dragon fight, Zabini!" He tugged at Harry's robe so that they could slip through the bodies of students closer to the trio.
Mister Ollivander was a really friendly man who knew who Harry was even as Harry flattened his hair over his forehead, but he was really nice about it and shook Harry’s hands about seven times before he was off between his shelves muttering about phoenix feathers.
Harry raised his sleeve up to his cheek again just in case there was smudged ink.
he spat in disgust when the subject matter was brought up one fine evening. “They may as well be fugitives!”
Harry wasn't about to let him go that easily.
It was him who hadn’t been ready after all.
Harry nodded. He was still going to have to talk to Kingsley about that and about pairing off his partner with someone else. “Yeah, you spent more than a week on that mission. Did it go well?”
On their way to the next class, Harry halted his friends. He put the Self-Erasing Parchment against the wall, wrote on it, before presenting it to Hermione.
Then, realizing what he just said and how loud he had said it, turned beet red.
And then…
the one who was bitten," Draco muttered, and looked away at Severus' pointed glare.
Well, no, not really. Not getting out of bed meant that he didn't get to see Draco, but – he supposed it would be fine, if it meant not having Awkward Conversations about his bits and sexuality with Draco Malfoy.
Passing him ingredients, asking about his homework, complaining about Slughorn.
Or, well, he isn’t really supposed to be taking care of Draco Malfoy. He’s just really here to keep him company, avoid the media while he’s at it, and eat the breakfast that Malfoy doesn’t eat.
Harry would realize later on that it was his.
Harry watched it go with amusement, debating on whether to follow so that he may put a halt on his immature musings.
On the 31
"I'm not sure, I haven't tried yet." He was whispering, so as to not wake Crabbe peacefully snoring in his bed. He walked towards the dresser, located his uniform, and took out the egg from its pocket. He gave it to Theodore before snuggling back in his bed.
At around that time, Malfoy would have been in the Manor, living day and night with a murderous madman just down the hall, fearing for his life, fearing for the lives of his parents. Harry wanted to ask.
So when he returned back to normal time After the Time Turner, it was Theodore Nott who was present.
Much less
you did,” Draco found himself replying dryly. He fixed Potter with a glare and didn’t even feel guilty when Potter looked away.
Draco politely ignored that. "But now that I'm doing this absolutely
And she was off, happily walking down the hall towards their Charms classroom, leaving Harry and Ron looking at her retreating back with dropped jaws and gobsmacked faces.
And tonight he's cooking Draco's favorites: slow cooked roast beef and gamberi e olio d'oliva, pasta tossed in a blend of sun-dried tomatoes and sauteed shrimps. It’s a bit heavy for breakfast, but Harry has a feeling they’ll get out of bed pretty late in the morning anyway.
So Petunia let the boy weed the garden under the heat of the sun. She turned a blind eye when the rashes turned into open wounds, angry and raw, ignored the child’s sniffles as he obediently shoved his wounded fingers in the dirt again and again for hours, and didn’t say a word when she turned the lock of the cupboard open the next morning and saw no signs that the wounds had been there at all.
He was going to be fine.
He removes Draco’s hand from the fork, and Draco’s fingers are long and soft to the touch, but they’re cold, and Harry rubs them with his own to bring the blood back into them. Never mind that it’s his first time touching Draco Malfoy’s hand since that handshake during first year. His hand had been small then. Smooth, like it had never done a day’s work in his life.
Harry blinked. "But you didn't tell me any –"
"Harry is fine," Severus informed him, after several moments of silence where Draco did not move from his position, sitting with his knees to his chest, on the bed.
He liked to think he was doing a very good job teaching Harry all about the Wizarding World. It also helped that Grimmauld Place held a very large library with a wide variety of books and that Harry was an ever curious student.
“I’m not going to stop pestering you, Malfoy. Stop trying to get rid of me.”
He tried to look pitiful and desperate. Begging Ginny was out of the question but begging Hermione, now that was another case. After all, it wasn't like he and Ron hadn't gone on their knees and begged her for things before. (This happened more than they'd like to admit.)
Then, Draco laughed lowly. It was a hollow laugh, one that made Harry cringe and vow to never hear again. "Right," Draco said, swallowing with difficulty. He closed his eyes, and then opened them again. "Right, you don't think I can. After all, what can I do against Harry Potter?" he muttered, but there was no bite, just… resignation.
He has a headache, but he forces himself out of bed anyway. He thinks he looks awful, his face feels sticky, but there’s no point hiding it. Not from Ron, anyway.
And then, another thought occurred to him, one that made him sick and empty and hollow –
Like being friends with Harry Potter.
He crosses the room, conscious of Draco’s piercing gaze on him the whole time. As he nears, he glances at the table. “Eggs?”
Harry immediately sobered at that, peering nervously at Draco. “Uhm, did your mother say…”
How was he to say that the ticket to getting the Jinx of him was actually sitting in front of him? And that it didn't
. Spitting out a name that wasn't even in there to begin with.
“Okay,” Harry said to mollify him.
Harry turned his disbelieving stare to Remus. “I
“No,” Ron said automatically in pretty much the same way that Harry did just a few days ago when Harry answered the same question.
"I meant," he said loudly, so that Potter would shut up. "Even I have a sense of gratitude."
He had had so many plans for this child.
The name was still foreign in Snape’s tongue.
“Chamber of Secrets.”
It was a picture of Draco, taken during one of the Ministry functions. Seamus, Charms Expert and Charmed Novelties Dealer, had recently figured out a way to charm a Muggle polaroid camera to produce wizard photographs then and made it a point to take candid portraits of everyone who attended.
With green and silver balloons and garlands and spiked punches! (Harry knew it was spiked because punches in the Slytherin Common Rooms were always spiked.) There was even a garish banner in the middle of the room that said
Only Harry Potter could disrespect the Minister of Magic like that.
Harry felt warmth spread across his cheeks. “Whaddya mean finally,” he muttered, shoving Draco’s shoulder slightly, playfully.
The darkness and echoing quiet of the hallways of Hogwarts calmed him, despite his thoughts of the war and Voldemort and Draco and Stinging Hexes.
– burst with pain and Harry shouted, loudly, crumpling to his knees, and he almost didn't hear the words that disrupted the quiet of the night:
to think.
But even after four years, he could still remember how it felt when he last held Draco Malfoy’s hand.
His picture.
Harry remembered, of course. He remembered that particular night—Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle chasing them until Crabbe let loose a spell that he couldn’t control. He remembered flames licking up the walls, engulfing all of the hidden things, and threatening to engulf them, too. He remembered Malfoy’s young face, panicked and afraid and begging for help.
, she had said.
Ron snorted. He looked away from the cat and shook his head. “Never imagined you to be a cat person.”
, he wrote.
"Am I a vampire?"
Draco snorts. “You should have just left, period.”
“It’s almost dinner time, actually. They’re expecting us in the Great Hall.”
Harry wrote on the parchment, pushing it towards Draco. He looked at the words sadly, wishing that the world thought the same.
Harry doesn’t even bother to hide his grin.
Angry is better. Anything is better than this.
Hermione and Ron knew better though.
“I can’t.” The unusual honesty had Draco snapping his eyes open again. He turned his head, took in the way that Potter was rubbing a hand down his face again.
And that’s how they spend their time together. Draco gets better in the mornings after that. It still takes him a while to really wake up and be present, but it doesn’t take him hours now.
Draco slowly glances out towards the garden. “Is this the Manor?”
Harry realized this belatedly, because it was sickeningly quiet and no one was helping him stand up and his ankle
Severus continued to eat his breakfast without looking up. "It's been resolved by your father. And the Ministry right now will not bother with such a small infraction. They're currently… busy with other things."
He wiped a hand down his face. "Did Severus talk to you about it?"
The Dark Mark burns, hot and heavy on his forearm, under his sleeve. He throws it over his eyes, and takes a deep, shuddery breath. He thanks his lucky stars and whatever higher being there is in the sky that nothing happened to either of them today, because he doesn’t think he can forgive himself if something had happened to Potter all because he was crazy enough to wander where he’s not supposed to wander and stupid enough to fall in love.
“Get to ground-level,” he instructed. “At least the earth is soft. I don’t want you hitting your head on stone. And cast from a good distance away, just in case the stone explodes like what happened in the Forest. Are you
Unsurprisingly, Potter avoided eye-contact with him all throughout dinner. Which was fine. Draco pointedly ignored him as well. He still wasn't sure what to feel after having to give his blood to a vampire.
Ginny raised an eyebrow. "You know my answer's still going to be no."
It was like madness had ensued. Harry, in retrospect, should have probably already run away from the Great Hall around that time and maybe hid himself in the Shrieking Shack. The girls had by now abandoned all civility and had started pushing and yelling and whistling and shrieking horrid pick-up lines.
"You can cast the Lip-Lock Jinx on me," Draco said when he pulled away, just a little bit. He licked his own lips, tasting Harry. "See if it works. I certainly wouldn't mind," he added, smirking.
Draco coughed loudly. “This talk about me is interesting and all, but can we please talk about something else?”
blood as well, as you have witnessed in his bathroom earlier."
His glasses were still on his face and he fixed them to settle comfortably on the bridge of his nose, before he turned his body to look at his unusual bedmate. Once his eyes adjusted to the dark, he could make out the angles of Malfoy’s face, sharp and beautiful. His face was thankfully still peaceful in sleep, which was such a stark contrast to the Malfoy that still sometimes penetrated Harry’s dreams.
"Does he still need the Blood-Replenishing Potion?" Lucius asked.
Remus laughed right alongside Sirius. “Well, if you don’t believe us… Go on then, Siri. Run right through that wall.”
A chuckle echoes in the dungeons. “What’s the password?”
They both knew Remus was going to end up doing all the boring stuff, like teaching the kid
“Welcome back,” Harry says instead. “I fixed your face.”
It was this that Draco pulled tighter around himself as he sat on the floor of the Hospital Wing. For the past few hours that he had sat there, no one had come and gone. No extra beds magically appeared. No hidden doors opened.
He rears back, looks at Draco’s face with wide eyes and his mouth agape. "His... his what?"
Didn't that merit him some sort of punishment? Detention?
The boy looked miserable at that but Snape was proud of his effort to put on a brave face afterwards. “Are they nice?” Harry whispered.
“Sorry!” Harry said quickly as the witch behind the cashier sent him a glare. He smiled nervously at her and at the one other customer who turned to look before picking up the book that had fallen.
Harry completely forgets about glaring at Ron and whips around in surprise.
Harry sent him a dry look.
Snape felt a momentary triumph when the boy didn’t flinch at that touch. There was progress.
It becomes frequent. Daily, even. Since coming to Hogwarts, he had already asked the Headmistress to ban the Howlers, but if people are sending him Owls under the guise of innocent, enveloped letters, then that would definitely be harder to stop.
was the Black's ancestral home? Then this was also…
“Only barbarians Accio felines,” Harry replied easily.
Narcissa shakes her head firmly. “No, but I take it you’ve seen a Dementor before?”
He blurts out, “You like Malfoy, don’t you?”
Draco looked at him funnily.
With a sigh, he sat down on the floor next to Harry and took one of the pencils lying around.
He didn't have much time to dwell on it, however, when Dumbledore's voice boomed from the stage.
"I smell guilt, my friends."
“Oh, nonsense, Harry!” Seamus exclaimed, grinning as he walked towards the couch and plopped himself ungracefully on it, making the cat bounce slightly off the pillow it was curled up on. The cat hissed at him but he merely ignored it and continued. “We’ve talked a great deal about you, especially after you came out of your little closet. Specifically if you’d be open to a ménage à trois.”
Ron’s jaw dropped. His eyes widened in alarm. “What – what – wait –“
Even when it is obviously only false bravado and ego enabling him to stand straight then.
It might have something to do with the fact that Draco
Harry looked stricken.
He's a…"
“That’s… Well, that’s good. I think.”
And Draco knew that he wasn’t
Its neatly brushed and short fur was a pure white with strawberry blond spots and its tail was rather long. Harry only noticed because when he opened the window to give the cat a scolding, the cat had jumped inside his living room and raised its nose and bum up in the air, as if haughtily reprimanding Harry for not letting it in sooner.
“I apologize,” he said, and even though his voice was stiff and awkward, the boy’s shy smile told him he was forgiven.
He heard Severus say quietly, "You are his First Donor, Draco."
Hermione smiles, her eyes twinkling. “I passed by a shop selling them in Diagon Alley. Show your love for Ron Weasley and all that shite.”
Harry paused, blinking. Then he turned to Draco again, eyebrows furrowed with worry and looking almost vulnerable. "Err – do you?" he asked awkwardly.
, Potter.”
Harry’s nose had scrunched up. “That’d be weird,” he had replied, to which Sirius – who had been sitting in on their ‘class’ that day – guffawed loudly at.
It’s not the same as his old one, of course, but he doesn’t know where that is (Potter? The Ministry?) and he’s too scared to ask.
The word still made him smile goofily.
Ron slowly turned green. He quickly decided to forget and purge from his memory that his girlfriend had ever mentioned him being (Merlin help all of us!) infatuated with Malfoy. In fact, he may just Obliviate himself later.
Draco stopped in front of him and had to clench his fist to refrain from grabbing Potter by the collar and shaking him.
Draco scoffs. “Are you going to tell me that Weasley’s worried about me, too?”
Harry’s gobsmacked expression just makes her laugh. “I’m sorry. Ron’s been telling me about it. I mean, he doesn’t mean bad, he’s just worried.”
Theodore made a face. "Well, it's a good thing you didn't. I'm not really interested in death defying games."
He could smell it in his nose, could feel it in his skin, in his blood, and in his scar.
dedicated to him!
Harry thought.
Harry didn’t look back.
“Hello,” he breathed out, reaching out to pet with a finger the soft top of her head.
Harry’s ears were red.
"A galleon for Cedric Diggory for Hogwarts," he whispered conspiratorially to Harry, getting a galleon from his pocket and holding it up with a grin.
It wasn't like Potter would welcome his company or something.
Malfoy’s raised eyebrow told him that he didn’t believe that something as simple as Finite Incantatem would do the trick, but Malfoy dutifully kept his mouth shut about it. Instead, he said, “So should I use my left hand…? You must know I’m right-handed, Potter, so using my left hand might not go as well as expected, but that’s where the Mark is.”
So now, they both stood in front of the Cup, each with one hand hovering over each handle. They looked at each other and nodded, ready to give glory to Hogwarts.
“Here!” Potter called.
“Do you reckon they’ll take NEWTs this year?” Ron asks.
Snape tried very hard to keep his lip from curling in disgust. “—to take care of you for me while I’m away.”
"POTTER!"
At twenty-three years old, he still felt so grossly young. He
Ron throws something at his head.
When he finally reached the library though, he found that he had no idea what to say.
planning this mission.
Believe me, we would not be here if it weren’t for you. The Ministry would have had us all in Azkaban and then conveniently forgotten about us.”
Harry opened his mouth to say hi then remembered right, shite, he couldn't. He settled for looking at the bottle suspiciously instead.
The cat gave a high-pitched meow and quickly leaped away to run for cover as the top drawer was pulled open and slid off its loose hinges, ultimately ending up clattering to the floor along with its contents.
“Merlin knows why, you’re such an irritating git,” Harry responds, mimicking his sigh. He points his fork at Draco. “But I’m staying, so stop trying to pick a fight with me. I don’t want to explain to Narcissa why I taped your mouth.”
"That's okay, I know you're horrid at arithmetic."
Draco starts to gather the letters into a neat pile. “A week, maybe more?”
the reason you’re like this, right?”
Harry grinned and waved at them at the same time that the door to his compartment opened and –
How much of their memories were returned?). They know she’s purposefully keeping it from them, because they’re all going through something, and the last thing she wants to do is to add to that.
He thought about Snape, too. He thought about Snape being the most cold-hearted professor that Hogwarts has ever seen and about Snape not being so cold-hearted after all. He thought about all the times he had been angry at the man, and all the times that he had been saved by him. They weren't the best of friends, that was for sure, but…
That was at least one less spell to backfire on Malfoy.
The full moon had just come and passed, and it was easy to tell with the dark circles under Remus' eyes that it had been a particularly difficult cycle.
Theodore continued. "I never did get why the Gryffindors piss themselves silly because of Professor Snape. He's practically overflowing with cavity-inducing sweetness," he said in the most serious voice and most serious face he could muster.
That place really held too many bad memories.
“I’ll be peachy, don’t worry about me, Potter,” Malfoy said with a huff. “Just can’t help but feel like the universe’s getting a kick out of this. Putting us back in places that had us in each other’s throats.”
“Oh, believe me, I’m terrified. Humor is how I cope,” Malfoy said dismissively, doing the same as him.
“That also explains why everything you wore hung off you when we were first years.”
Ron and Hermione themselves had already voiced out those very same concerns, but—they weren’t the ones to pick up Malfoy’s convulsing body or hear his tortured screams. Weren’t the ones who had to hold vigil next to his bed and see the healers’ pressed lips and hear Madame Pomfrey’s displeased mutters of “
He’s flirting, he knows, but Draco seems to realize what he had just said and his cheeks go red and Harry can’t resist.
It doesn’t have anything to do with him.
"Arguing," Severus replied shortly. He walked towards the Slytherin table. "They'll come to an agreement soon enough. Your mother will realize what the smart thing to do is, after she's done with all her… emotions." His lip curled in disgust.
What he was grateful for, however, was the fact that it seemed like his parents didn't have anything to worry about anymore under Dumbledore's protection. Maybe the Dark Lord would forget about them. After all, he had more important things to think about. And they could all go back to living their lives and letting the Aurors handle it.
He walks through the halls of the Manor, shrugging off his clothing layer by layer and letting them fall to the floor until only his trousers are left. Quiet pops fill the night, telltale signs of the House Elves dutifully doing their jobs and whisking away his mess. One pops to his right and Harry accepts and puts on the offered sweater with a grateful smile.
And then Harry's blood turned cold. Harry smelled him first before he saw him. All his vampire instincts was telling him to run away, to flee, to get away from that vile stench – smelling like a half-rotten corpse and spoiled blood.
That still doesn't justify
And Draco, in his delirium, replies, just as soft. “I know.”
“Yeah.”
"Sorry," Harry said, feeling sheepish now. "For getting you involved."
“I just want to try something,” he mumbled, feet already moving before he could stop himself, before he could think this through.
“Yeah.”
“We might not have made it through first year. You were an insufferable git back then.”
But it was all droned out as the other Slytherins pulled him further inside the room with the intent of involving him in the party.
