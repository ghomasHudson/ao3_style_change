'No.'  His voice could hardly be heard in the silent room, his hands clenching over and over in his lap.  He wanted to scream, cry, dash from the room.  Anything to get away from the hateful box and all it stood for.
'You can't, can you.  Fucking Hell, Malfoy.  We were friends once.  You stayed at my house.  My own father treated you like his own!'  Nott snapped.  'And look where that has got him!  He's done nothing wrong, but still he's held prisoner in some grubby little room with a House Elf for company.  You did that, you and that disgusting teacher turned against us, spied on us and destroyed all we had.'
'She wasn't hurt.  I...I was so happy.  She...she would rescue me.'  A smile twitched Draco's tear stained lips, his eyes staring.  'Mother.  Please.'  A heart-wrenching sob that had Harry clench his teeth, almost afraid that he would start yelling for Draco to stop his shocking story, to scream at McGonagall and Pomfrey to get the Hell out.  But all he could do was listen.
'I've got water, soap.'  He told him.  'Clean pyjamas.  Mine, I'm afraid.  I didn't know where to get spare ones.  I hope you don't mind.'  Draco shook his head, tried not to grin.  'Great!  And fresh bedding.'
Walking over to the window, he threw it open, the welcome burst of fresh morning air hitting his face, washing away the worst of the night.  The long, lonely night.  Hours spent watching Draco not sleeping, worried sick when he couldn't free him from the stupor the memories had caused.  The vacant eyes, the random babble that spilled from his mouth.  Harry was terrified of losing him.
Whatever had once been inside the cloudy glass had long since evaporated, leaving behind a whisper of dust that was quickly swallowed up the dirt already collected in the corners.
'You can't lie, I've said it to you before.  You are terrible at it.'  Harry spoke.  'I may not know much about you, Draco, but I do know that.'
'I...I've never...'  Draco whispered, slowly drawing back, his eyes dipping.  'Not...not properly.  U...unless...  There was a...a man.  He would...'  He hesitated, seeming to search for the words.  Harry knew what he could not say.
'That is certainly not true.'  Madam Pomfrey smiled, the first one for many anxious hours.  'When Draco woke, your name was the first word he uttered.'
He knew his grip must be hurting, but in her kindness she kept quiet, squeezing firmly back.  She realised, Theo thought with a jolt, she realised just how much he needed her steady presence, her uncompromising friendship in spite of what he had just done to one of their own.
'I promise you.'  And Draco was once again back where he only ever wanted to be.  Safe in Harry's arms.
Landing took an effort, the gusting wind wanting to keep him in the air, wanted Harry for it's prisoner.  Finally his feet touched firm ground.  Head down against the storm, Harry made his way morosely to the changing rooms.  He couldn't hope to notice that his slow progress across the waterlogged pitch was being watched by a single pair of eyes.  Eyes that had watched him for days now.  Knowing eyes.
'No, you don't.'  Harry stopped, his voice low, fighting against his tears.  'I...  I wanted to see you.  I wanted to see you so bloody much, Draco.  But not there, not in front of everyone.  I wouldn't have been able to stand it.'
'If...if you want m...me too.'  He couldn't help but cry.  If Harry wished it, Draco would drink.  Knowing full well what was waiting for him in the dark.
'I have to.'  With shaky breath, Draco relinquished all control to Harry, slumping weakly in his arms.
'Harry...'  Draco's soft voice stopped Harry from moving forward, from reaching towards the red-headed boy in anger.  'It's okay.'
'Can't...can't you make him sleep?  So he won't feel it.'  Harry whispered, unable to drag his eyes from the naked, emaciated form.
She approached him slowly, the glass held in front of her body, as if to tempt him, a tool to tease, to barter with.  Draco knew he would do anything for this gift.  He would give them anything they asked of him for just a sip, a taste of the sweet liquid.  He had begged before, why should the sunlight, the hut change anything?
'There is nothing more that can be done, Draco.  They...they may fade, but you will always have them.'
Ron's eyebrows rose in surprise, a hesitant smile quirking his mouth.  'Do...'  He stammered, coughing into his fist.  'Harry...  Do...  Do you want a game?'  He asked, hope flaring in his too bright eyes.
Madam Pomfrey had taken the hard decision not to try any further spells on Draco.  There was something at work on his body that she didn't understand.  The spells to heal him had helped somewhat.  But nowhere near to the extent that they should have.  He was still filled with pain, with shaking and trembling.
Hermione couldn't contain the gasp of air rushing from her lungs.  The hand that now covered her mouth was useless.  The sharp sound already out there in the quiet of the common room, along with the clatter of her books that fell from Ron's arm.  Scattering across the floor, the sudden noise louder than an explosion.
So it was with no small amount of shame that Draco raised his fist, poised to knock against the simple wooden door to Hagrid's home.
Draco.  Dying.  Where he couldn't help, couldn't touch him.  Where he didn't know about that dark Cell in which Draco lay, with the festering corpses of his treasured family tucked away into the corner.
'Listen to me.'  Harry sat in front of him, carefully taking Draco's bruised face in his hands.  'You can't stay here anymore.  You need to be looked after properly.'
'Mother tried to move, but she couldn't.'  Draco did as McGonagall wished, his eyes locked on the wall ahead.  'I...I think she was going to come to me.  He wouldn't let her.  I...I only wanted a touch.  She was my Mummy.  She begged Him to let me go.  She said to take her instead.  Not Mummy, better it was me.  He laughed, He always laughed.  He made Father look at me, made him see what they had done.  Then the spells again.  Mother screaming, begging him to stop.  He...He said he would.  But Father had to kill her.'
'Hmmm,'  Harry murmured, his eyes flicking around the increasingly rowdy room, looking for rescue.  'It wasn't so bad.'  Finding none, he decided to keep his reply as vague as possible.  'We...we didn't really see each other all that much.'
'I can't do anything else.'  Harry whispered into Draco's hair.  'I never thought I had a place, even coming to Hogwarts I was an outsider, an oddity.  Someone to be stared at, talked about.  Hermione and Ron took me in, but even they saw something different in me.  I didn't fit in anywhere, not really.  I guess I never felt like I had a home.  Not a real one.'
'Go, Harry.  I'll cover for you.'  Neville looked from his headmistress to his friend, frightened by what he saw pass between them.  Unspoken words that left Harry terrified, colour draining from his face in moments.  'You need to go.'  He had to give the stricken boy a little shove, break him out of his stupor.
Watching him leave the room had stretched every nerve in Draco's tired, broken body.  He wanted him back, desperate to cry out for him not to leave. He wanted the stories and the gentle hand holding.  Wanted Harry to touch him, protect him from the whispering in his head.  The voice that patiently waiting for the darkness, for the loneliness to descend.
His breath caught in his throat.  Panic squeezing his lungs.  Cold fingers of dread reaching into his chest, stealing what little air remained.
'Shit, Draco.  I'm so fucking sorry.'  Harry grasped him, pulled him close.  The cloak thrown to the floor where it lay in the dust, forgotten for the moment in the face of Draco's distress.  'I didn't think about what I was doing to you.'  Harry told him, his hand clamped on the back of Draco's neck, pressing him to his chest.  Draco's hands cluching his jumper, wanting to feel the warm skin beneath the thick wool.  He couldn't get close enough.
Draco undoes his seatbelt and Harry does the same. Draco wets his lips and Harry wonders how they feel. Is Draco a good kisser? Does the dick live up to his own bravado? Harry turns his body to face Draco.
“Drive safe. Seriously. And don’t forget your promise about Tinder!” Harry says, standing at the driver’s side window, leaning in.
“I wouldn’t be too proud. That’s not how we roll. Now listen, Pansy. Something big has just gone down. We know for a fact that Death Troopers were deployed for a town called Godric’s Hollow. We know that the Death Troopers left. Now, the trouble is that Godric’s Hollow? It’s gone. Poof. Have you been there?” Angelina asked, walking closer to Pansy.
Harry slides Draco’s lower lip between his lips, letting them glide together. Then Draco does something unexpected. Harry feels his full lower lip catch between Draco’s teeth which press down, biting him just a little. Harry gasps and pulls back.
More silence. Harry needs a shower and then to head to work. He rushes a little through the shower, getting out and grabbing his phone, still naked.
Draco sped up his strokes while Harry continued to push back against Draco’s groin, his legs and his feet pushing back against him too. Draco’s hand desperately rubbed over the head of Harry’s cock.
Reluctantly, Draco strode over to the window, glancing out the blinds. The sky was blue and the sun was out. If you ignored all the smoke in the air and the corpses in neighboring yards you could almost mistake it for a nice day. The chaos of the night before had ended, the Death Troopers having slaughtered anyone who might be dangerous or unwelcome in
Ginny awkwardly laughs and says, “God, no. That would be so fucking twisted. I mean I definitely have a thing for tall guys but you
Harry looks at the river and says, “I wish I could live in the woods. Have a cabin. Chop some firewood.”
Just then the front door opened. Pansy whirled around, seeing a tall, bearded man standing there in overalls.
Harry closes his eyes. There’s silence then Draco strikes. Harry jumps but bites his lip to stop himself from making a sound. It burns but feels good as the burn fades. Draco does it again and again. Harry refuses to give Draco any satisfaction. He doesn’t want him to hold back.
“It’s really sexy. If the fact that doing things with it won’t be easy isn’t a problem for you then it’s not a problem for me. I just want to please you,” Harry says, leaning over to lick the head, Draco shaking in response.
“We can go a little further than head back. I’ve been impressed with you. It’s not bad for a first hike.”
Draco grins and says, “Yes. Big men. Strong men. Smash!” then turns to the woman at the front desk and says, “We’ll take the single bed.”
The bus station really wasn’t far, though he still had to ask for directions once he was outside. This wall too confusing. But he had a bunch of Seattle addresses written down. He must know some people there.
“That’s terrible. I don’t think anyone thought you were scary, though. I think they thought you were an asshole.”
“Vampires run cold. Don’t worry, once you have some blood you’ll feel better. And then we head to your home town to raise some hell,” the man said, popping his knuckles.
“It’s beautiful regardless of its size,” Harry says, sliding his hand up and down the considerable length.
Harry suddenly feels hot, thinking it must be the wine at first before remembering they hadn’t ordered any. No, it was just Draco and his curious gaze.
“No. But you like to pretend you are. The truth is you might be the kindest man I’ve ever known. But you talk shit real good and I don’t know what it is about that but it gets me worked up. Makes me feel like letting go,” Harry says, Draco putting his other hand on Harry’s hand that’s resting on Harry’s thigh.
'It has to be said.  I was a bully, a coward.  I do not expect anyone to see beyond that.  What...what happened to me doesn't change what I did to them, to you.  I can't ever be forgiven.'
Almost losing his tenuous hold for the second time, Harry knew it was crazy to be out in the oncoming storm, lightning flashing menacingly in the distance.  All it would take was a slip in a turn, a particularly forceful gust of wind, and he would plummet to the ground in a tumble of broken bones and torn flesh.
But, someone would have to find him.  Madam Pomfrey bringing his breakfast.  She would have to drag him from the thick, bright water.  Crying, shouting for help.
His arm a constant ache, a tightening of the muscle, a fire within.  He wanted to take cold steal to it, wanted to blur the darkness with stripes of blood, parted flesh and ragged skin.  Wanted to cut it out, cut it all away.
'Minerva, oh my dear Minerva, tell me, tell me what can be done?'  The Fat Lady clutched her hands to her breast.  'Anything.  I would like to be of some use.'
'It wasn't luck.  I w...was his plaything.  He didn't want me dead, he wanted to consume me, own me.  I was his toy.'  A sob tore its way from his throat.  'I...I still am.'
'I...I only wanted to see the stars.'  A choked whisper, his knees giving way.  It was too late.  Harry couldn't save him, no one could save him.
'It's all right.'  Harry murmured again, pulling Draco's fragility against himself.  He pressed a kiss, two, three into his hair.  'You are almost there.'
So caught up in his thoughts,  Harry didn't hear the slight creak the door of the changing rooms made when it was opened.  Didn't hear the soft footsteps over the pounding water, didn't hear someone sitting at the bench running the length of the room, waiting patiently for Harry to be finished with his shower.
It wasn't the shadowed speech of his Lord and Master, waiting and wanting in the mouldering darkness.
'It's okay.'  Harry touching his face, his careful fingers stroking away the tears.  'It was a dream, only a dream.'
In a town called Garibaldi, a quarter of the way down the coast Draco finally stops for gas. Harry goes inside and comes back out with two bottled teas. He hands Draco his bottle with a kiss, only a quick one, like a thief. Draco likes that. He likes that
Probably. I don’t live with them anymore, though. I can’t say everything I own I got my own way but I don’t get money from them anymore.
Harry made a pleased sound as Draco whined with the intensity of his orgasm. It had been a while since he came so hard that his balls hurt after. Harry continued to suck as Draco’s cock grew soft. Draco felt peace fill his mind and body. Harry finally released his cock then got up out of bed. Draco was tired and struggled to remain awake while Harry went to clean himself up.
He’d been walking along the highway for half an hour. Maybe longer. Didn’t know where he was. Or who he was. Or where he was going. Woke up in a ditch with a backpack. There was stuff in there. Lots of papers. A book by someone named Lupin. He had a wallet with some money. His Driver’s License said his name was Harry James Potter. He was 6’1”. Green eyes. Born in 1997. Wasn’t sure what year it was now.
“Woo. That was good,” Pansy said, smiling down at Daphne whose face was still between her legs and fingers were still inside of her.
“It is. I don’t come here so much anymore but it’s always worth it when I do. So, Harry, you never told me what your hobbies are.”
Just as Draco was certain she would dig in deeper the closet door shut with a slam and the person stomped down the stairs. Neither of them moved until the sounds had passed. Draco was thinking that if he were them that he would just wait downstairs just in case anyone decide to out themselves as having been hiding. Under different circumstances Draco might’ve enjoyed being wedged this close to Harry but currently he felt terrified and suffocated.
The detective couldn’t find Harry either. But Draco had and dammit he was gorgeous, forcing Draco to wonder if Harry had just been some stupid crush. No… there were references. Things he didn’t understand. Things he’d noted he needed to talk to Harry about.
Harry bites his lip then gets down on the carpeted floor. Draco’s bulge would be visible from the moon, Harry is pretty sure. He can see it at an angle, stretching the black fabric of his slacks all around it. Draco spread his legs and Harry’s hands rub up Draco’s thighs. He’s nervous. This is the point of no return. Not that he minds.
pulled the plug on my existence,” Pansy said, her pale, pretty face winking at Draco in the moonlight.
Harry puts a hand on Draco’s hand, which is still on the stick shift. Harry slides his fingers between Draco’s as if they were holding it together. They hold like this for a long time. Maybe a minute. Draco finally turns and Harry moves to meet his sweet lips. Every time he kisses Draco is better than the last. There’s more meaning in it. He still strongly desires him but what’s more is that he emotionally desires him. He wants to be a part of him. Part of his life. Draco and Harry. Two peas in a pod.
Gunshots echoed in the distance as Draco ran through another yard and desperately climbed over another fence. He was almost certain he had cut himself climbing those hedges before. He hit the ground hard, nearly knocking his breath out. Everything was a nightmarish blur and he only wanted to find shelter and hide long enough to formulate some semblance of a plan. He pulled himself up and dashed for the back porch of the house in front of him.
“And you’ll have me. I’m like super fast and really strong. Like I think I could jump over a freakin’ house if I tried,” Pansy said, like she was bragging about her words per minute at an interview for a desk job.
Man hiking with his dog. Woman with a gun. Uncomfortably close selfie. Another uncomfortably close selfie. Guy who looks like a serial killer. Jesus.
He’s positive of it. His parents? Not so much but Draco has never had any problems there. No one drinks. Harry seems surprised.
Draco tips his glass at Harry and drinks. Almost done. Hermione raises her hand, looking annoyed but smiling.
The girl was lying in hay, looking pale and very frail. She had bite marks all over her body. Her dark eyes looked pleadingly at Pansy.
“I was wondering… I know this is a weird question, but do you know where this address is?” Harry asked, showing her the License.
“It’s written in my notes too. I can’t remember it but I know there’s a word that I think is the name of a place and whenever I look away… it’s gone. I’ve tried searching for it and there’s nothing. It doesn’t exist,” Draco said.
“It doesn’t. Puked my guts up. It was horrific. Gotta believe I spent the rest of the weekend scrubbing every surface in the house. And I never told anyone because I was so embarrassed.”
Harry pulled out his phone, bringing up the contact info for Draco. He could call him or text him. They could touch base. He missed Draco. Funny to think they had once hated each other. But now, with everyone gone or missing, Draco might be the best friend he had.
Harry chuckles as they nearly start making out before Harry pulls away. Draco had planned on being much more low-key but that doesn’t seem to be working out.
There’s a knock at the door. Harry goes to answer it. The second he opens it a tiny red-haired woman leaps onto Harry. Ginny Weasley. Ron’s sister and Harry’s other ex. The serious one.
Harry touched Draco’s shoulder. He wished he had Harry’s knack for knowing when to show physical affection. Astoria was always affectionate like that. Draco always felt awkward. He had learned to be that way with Astoria but it was still hard.
“Oh wow. That’s actually hard. You know as much as I love Tchaikovsky I think I have to go with Mozart.”
The man laughed and said, “Money ain’t the problem with the homeless. They could work. They don’t want to.”
“It’s been a year. A year to the day,” Draco said as he and Harry stood together in Pike Place Market, watching ferries crossing Elliot Bay.
Draco felt Harry’s body jerk and his cock spasmed in Draco’s hand, spilling warm fluid all over his hand and Harry’s belly.
last thing that Draco needs is Harry understanding just how Draco really came to discover his bisexuality.
The house was a nice looking Victorian style home, apparently at least a hundred years old. There was something odd about it. A hum that seemed to emanate from it that only got stronger as Harry let him inside.
Harry can’t send his phone number fast enough, trembling and nearly dropping his phone with excitement. He finds it a struggle to even focus on work for the rest of the day. It’s not until that evening when he finally gets texts from Draco, his phone rapidly buzzing on his nightstand.
“What I’ve been told is that the president is about to launch a new secret project. Death Troopers. Some sort of elite supernatural force. They are going to take out targets the president deems threats. Keep other supernatural forces in line. It’s been brewing for a while,” Draco admitted.
“Oh, Draco, I hope you’re ready. Ohhhh,” Harry moans, heat filling his body as his insides become impossibly tense then release, the first spasm almost painful as he shoots down Draco’s threat.
Harry whispers to himself as he stares at Tinder in the dark in the apartment he shares with his best friends, Ron and Neville. Impulsively he swipes right then immediately regrets it.
There’s no further reply so Harry goes to bed. There’s no message in the morning. In fact, Harry only briefly hears from Draco that night.
Draco looks dazed like he just woke up from a very long nap. He smiles at Harry and says, “Bring it here.”
“Thanks,” Harry mumbles taking another sip of tea. He usually doesn’t have anyone to care for him after he gets discharged from St. Mungos, of course, Hermione and Ron will stop by and make sure he’s okay. Mrs. Weasley usually watches Teddy for a bit and then fusses about until he can convince her that he’s fine.
“Greystone comes with Potter and me, McAdams takes everyone’s statement. Make sure they don’t leave a single detail out,” Ron instructs once all the women are in the relative safety of the library. While to nervous ears a may sound like McAdams is just there to take their statements, but he’s really their last line of defense. While he doesn’t do well in group fights, he’s an accomplished one-on-one duelist.
Harry completely forgot that George and Fred’s birthdays are on Tuesday. They haven’t celebrated it since the war, George always refused and it was too painful for everyone else anyways. Instead, George and Molly go to the cemetery while everyone else tries to go about their day and pretend everything is fine.
Draco mumbles thank you though it’s covered up by the sound of Teddy asking. “Grandma Molly, can I have another cinnamon bun?”
Mrs. Weasley spots them and immediately ushers Ron and Harry into the room. “Come on in boys and get yourself a plate before the food goes cold.”
“You’re always welcome Harry, you know I enjoy cooking for all of you,” Molly says with a warm smile before passing him a plate with a warming charm to keep the food at the perfect temperature. “It’s nice when the whole family can get together.”
Harry finds he can’t help but watch Draco, there’s something about him that makes it hard to look away. He laughs as something the Fleur whispers into his ear, tucking in on himself and wearing a wide grin. Harry has the intense urge to be the one to make Draco laugh, to be the one whispering in Draco’s ear and bringing a grin to his face.
The further down the hallway they get the louder the voices seem to grow louder until they push open a door at the end of the hall. The room isn’t much different than the sitting room they had walked into except for the decorations are all in different shades of red. Greystone is there hovering anxiously in the middle of the room and with her wand extended in front.
Harry can’t say he’s actually pleased that Mrs. Malfoy is giving away information about an ongoing investigation. Draco is her son and could be in danger too. As long as she doesn’t share anything about it with her husband Harry’s not going to have a problem with it.
Draco nods as he and Teddy follow Hermione into the dining room. Harry stays back as Ron comes over and stands beside him whispering furiously. “What is he doing here?”
“Did Greystone mention where in the manor they are? This place looks huge,” McAdams questions as they make their way into a large hallway. They all have their wands out and the quietness of the manor makes it seems creepy and sad.
Harry stops trying to get into a sitting position and instead rests his head back against the impressive stack of pillows. He hates being in the hospital and usually tries to leave before the nurses give him permission. Harry has got pretty good at convincing them that he’s not really in that much pain and that he plans to take it easy once he gets home.
“Kreacher’s making lasagna if everyone wants to stay for dinner,” Draco offers politely. Harry thinks this is probably evidence that Narcissa raised her child to be a good host, taught him all the rules provided in a book on pureblood etiquette. It reminds Harry of the prim way that Draco always eats his food, perfect posture, and without even a hint of messiness.
“Well, I certainly don’t want to see you do it,” Draco snaps, scowl becoming even more intense. He stomps out of the room, this time it's clearly meant for Harry to see. He shuts the door so hard behind him the entire wall seems to shake, a picture of Harry, Ron, and Hermione nearly falls down.
After they are all finished eating they hang out, chatting since surprisingly it seems like no one has anywhere else to be tonight. It’s unusual for everyone to be free, usually, someone either has work or another gathering to get to. In the living room, Draco and Fleur are sitting on the floor with Teddy in front of them and Victoire in Draco’s lap. They seem to be natural friends, a mix of French and English making up their conversation. Bill joined briefly when they were talking about setting up a play date for Victoire and Teddy later in the week.
“There have been a couple of fire calls here and there,” Ginny responds with a disappointed sigh. “I miss her though, a lot. I wish we were able to talk more.”
“You have a crush on Luna,” Harry blurts out a delighted grin working its way onto his face. “I can’t believe I didn’t realize earlier!”
For a minute Draco hovers over Harry without saying anything. His shoulders are tight with anxiety and he seems to fold into himself slightly as he talks. “I know that you were at Greengrass Manor and protecting my mother.”
He’s trying to hustle Teddy out the door, grabbing his jacket off the hook and a bag filled with Teddy toys. “Come on Teddy. You don’t want to be late, there won’t be any cinnamon buns left.”
Of course, Harry can’t say no, that he would never invite Draco to brunch because it would be a colossal disaster. He can already see the glares Ron and Draco are going to throw each other as Mrs. Weasley will flutter around the room trying and failing to make everyone get along. He can imagine that Arthur won’t even be able to look at the person who fought on the side that killed his son.
Hope everyone enjoyed, I thought everyone deserved a very fluffy chapter. Thank you to everyone who left comments and kudos, I try to respond to everyone who leaves a comment but if I missed yours thank you! I am almost done editing this fic so I am hoping to get the rest of the chapters out in the next couple of weeks.
It’s not easy to change, he’s in too much pain for standing up to be worth it. He’s able to slip the pants off his hips without much difficulty, having an elastic band-helps. Putting the joggers on is slightly more difficult and takes a lot of wiggling and a few attempts at awkwardly lifting his ass off the couch. The shirt much easier to get off and his Holyhead Harper shirt is loose and slips on easily.
“Shut up,” Harry mumbles wonders if he should leave the conversation before she can start digging deeper. He knows that he finds Draco attractive, he’s part veela after all and it seems impossible not to. Harry still has mixed feelings towards Draco, their friendship still feels so new after so many years of hating each other.
“Shut up Potter and listen to Dr. Dumont. It’s clear you’re in pain, you're acting like an idiot by denying it,” Draco says sharply. His tone is unusually harsh, Harry’s gotten used to the new Draco whose much kinder. His tone seems almost unnecessarily cruel, and Harry wants to say something equally harsh back.
“Malfoy’s here,” George states his expression doing something strange before ending with one of vague confusion. “He looks strange.”
“We shouldn’t spend too much time there, I doubt Lestrange is sloppy enough to leave his entire plan or a list of his safe houses laying around,” Harry jokes, thinking about the rants Ron goes on about how unrealistic muggle villains are in movies.
Harry leaves the two of them to talk and turns to listen to Hermione talk about her new case. Eventually, the conversation drifts over to Charlie’s job and a new handler that’s been hired at the reserve. Harry wishes he could talk about the Lestrange case, he wouldn’t be surprised if Ron has given a few hints to Hermione about it. Theoretically, they’re not supposed to talk about cases outside of work. Harry always tries to keep work out of Sunday brunch.
He reaches out and tries to grab Draco’s arm to keep him from leaving the room but Draco avoids his touch. If Harry wasn’t so exhausted he’d get up and try to stop Draco. “We should talk about this. Clearly, you know Lestrange, enough to hate him. Maybe you could help us find him.”
Charlie nudges Harry with his elbow mouth half-filled with food. “Did you know that Draco speaks French?”
Greystone’s Patronus is a recognizable shape in the Auror office, her swooping heron which finds its way in front of Harry’s desk. It speaks in Greystone’s soft voice. “Auror Potter, Weasley, and McAdams report to Greengrass Manor at once. They had been another attack.”
“You’re very welcome,” Molly says and Harry doesn’t fully understand how she can have such a big heart. “I expect to see all three of you here next Sunday.”
Harry wanders into the kitchen, searching for Draco who disappeared from the living room and to give his goodbyes to Molly. He finds her packing up the food, so each of them can take some home. He sees one filled with cinnamon buns and he suspects it will be coming home with him.
“Everything’s fine,” Ron reassures as they make their way deeper into the house. “Everyone’s getting along. Let’s go get some food, I know I’m starving.”
Harry slides into a seat beside Charlie and across from Draco and Teddy while Ron takes the seat next to him. Teddy’s gnawing on a cinnamon bun and Harry is slightly horrified about the sugar rush that is about to ensue. Draco, on the other hand, has his normal carefully balanced meal and is eating it with the kind of grace that should be reserved for a society dinner party.
He gets a trademark overdramatic eye-roll in reply. “You don’t have to lie to me, Harry. I know you rather boil yourself alive than read a book about potions.”
I hope everyone enjoyed it. If anyone is confused about how Bone was listening in on them he was able to listen into hermione and Ron's apartment and hear them talk about Harry and figure out where he would be from there.
Harry’s not sure how he feels about Draco buying sort of illegal ingredients for his potions. There’s a little spark of glee that they were just talking about business, that there were no flirty words or promises to meet up. He wants Charlie to find someone and be happy, he just doesn’t want that person to be Draco.
A few minutes later Draco comes back down the stairs and into the living room, practically stomping as he goes. He deposits wear of dark grey joggers and an old worn-out Holyhead Harpies t-shirt onto Harry’s lap. He got them out of Harry’s dresser and Harry’s not sure how he feels about that. Draco’s probably never even gone in his room before, let alone dug through his underwear drawer.
Harry is surprised when they land within Greengrass Manor. Harry does not have extensive knowledge of old wizarding homes, but he knows most are like Grimmauld Place. Cut off from the floo network so only pre-approved people can get in through it. There is no reason they should be to floo directly into Greengrass Manor, he expected to be rerouted to the closest wizarding floo area and then apparate to the edge of the property.
I can't believe its finally done! I want to thank everyone who read this fic and everyone who left comments or kudos. this is officially the longest fic I've very written! I had such a wonderful time sharing it with everyone.
Hermione gives a long look between Draco and Harry. “Would you like to come to get some food with me? Molly’s already put everything out.”
The smile that Teddy gives Harry is self-satisfied and it takes Harry a minute to realize that it is an entirely Draco’s expression. “Draco is coming with us.”
Teddy comes running up and stands next to Harry pulling on his pant leg. “Draco says it's time to go home.”
“The owl dropped off the pain potion, I added it to the tea,” Draco explains as Harry takes a careful sip. It tastes like regular tea except for the faint sour after taste which he knows comes from the potion.
He settles back onto the bed but leaves his legs dangling over the side. Draco returns to the chair by the side of the bed as soon as Harry’s no longer needs him for balance. His scowl is intense and his brow heavy with clear frustration.
“Alright,” Harry promises mostly out of fear even though he desperately wants to tease her. “You should tell Luna how you feel.”
Draco comes back downstairs after about twenty minutes. He’s changed into his pajamas, matching striped shirt, and pants which Harry thinks are absolutely hilarious. It makes him looks like an overgrown child and utterly adorable. Harry thinks he should be tucking Draco into bed, he strangely wants to be tucking Draco into bed.
“Not so fast. We need to make sure you can walk before I can dismiss you,” Dr. Dumont says. “Up you get now, no time like the present. Mr. Malfoy, perhaps you can help him?”
Harry blinks his eyes open which are dry, and slightly crusty revealing a blurry figure leaning over him. He reaches out on instinct to the side table to where his glasses are sitting and slips them onto his face. He has to blink his eyes a few more times to get used to the bright lights in the hospital room, reaching weak arm up to get rid of the crusty’s in his tear ducts.
Harry settles onto the couch next to Ginny. This is the first Sunday brunch she’s actually been able to stay after for, usually she either has a game, practice, or some sort of promotional event. He knows being the face of her team keeps her busy and it has been a while since they’ve been able to hang out. He could use a night out with her and her team though last time it sent him stumbling home at four in the morning.
“Draco would you like another cinnamon bun? You’re so skinny. Harry used to be that skinny but he’s gotten a lot better since joining the Aurors,” Mrs. Weasley says, giving Draco a surprisingly warm smile. He knows feeding people is Molly’s way of saying she cares about someone and he’s happy to see Draco getting that treatment.
They’ve been monitoring everyone who they thought could be Lestranges next victim. Mrs. Flint and Mrs. Malfoy have already had attempted break-ins, and the remaining three women are all on the list of people he could attack. They all fit the profile they’ve created of Lestrages victims, all friends of Mrs. Malfoy, and weren’t death eaters but didn’t oppose them.
Draco nods and Harry suspects Hermione going to make sure Draco’s treating Kreacher good. She’s never been happy that Kreacher has chosen to remain at Grimmauld place, especially about his renewed fervor in serving the remaining members of the Black family living in the house. Kreacher had chosen to stay at Grimmauld place, no matter how many times harry offered him freedom or even to go work somewhere else.
“Did you guys find anything useful at the cabin?” Harry asks. He can only imagine what kind of horrible things to be found in Rabastans Lestrange secret cabin.
As soon as they are up the stairs Harry asks. “What happened after I was injured? Were you able to make any progress?”
“It’s fine,” Harry says quickly brushing off Draco’s concern. “I’m okay, got patched up by Dr. Dumont. I get to spend a few days at home with you and Draco.”
Ron and Harry both nod in response following Greystone as she leads them through the house. The stairs on the servant staircase are old and creak under their feet. They cringe under the noise and all cast a silencing spell.
They check each room as they go, wands out in front of them ready to cast at the smallest provocation. They pass another portrait of an older man with a cane out in front of him who watches them go wide eyes. Harry wonders if it’s strange having all your ancestors lurking about as you walk between the bathroom and the bedroom. Harry wouldn’t like it very much.
Once home, Draco deposits Harry onto the couch and stalks out of the living room. Holding onto Draco’s arm made him realize just how tense Draco is, practically vibrating with how tight his muscles are. Harry simply feels tired, and he’s looking forward to his first dose of the pain potion.
“Take off those horrendous hospital clothes and put those on,” Draco demands, arms folded over his chest as he sets Harry with a scowl. His tone is dripping with bossiness which makes him want to resist his instructions more than anything.
“Let’s go, Molly’s going to come and drop off Teddy soon,” Draco says offering an arm for Harry to hold onto. They make their way out into the hallway, the Auror department had their own private floo system into St. Mungos. The hallways are relatively quiet, they pass a nurse who keeps her eyes carefully on the ground, but other than that they don’t see anyone.
Rons defeated expression tells him almost everything he needs to know. Of course, it was too much to assume that they’d be able to catch Lestrange, he’s a powerful wizard and has been hiding out long enough that he’s become well versed in how to get away from Aurors. A small part of him had hoped they could be done with this case, an easy victory.
“Nope but we’ve got another game Thursday evening,” Ginny says, pushing hair which is in a pixie cut out of her face. “I can get tickets if you want to bring Teddy and Malfoy?”
Harry looks into the dining room and finds almost everyone’s already sitting down. Arthurs as the head of the table, newspaper out in front of him and looking completely absorbed in it. At once Harry’s eyes are drawn to Draco, who has a plate in front of him and Teddy sitting beside him. Fleur is next to him with Victoire in a highchair next to her. Draco and her are deep in conversation, both looking so unbelievably attractive. Hermione is beside Teddy and Charlie across from them, adding to the conversation between forkfuls. Down at the end of the table, Ginny and Bill are having a quiet conversation.
“Okay,” Teddy says happily jumping off the couch and shoving another slice of apple into his mouth. He follows Molly up the stairs, babbling as he goes. Teddy has reached the age where he loves talking to anyone who will listen.
“Nothing,” Draco covers up quickly turning away from Harry. “Do you need an extra pillow? I’m going to bed.”
Harry’s just finishing up his sandwich when the floo flares alive and Hermione and Ron come into the room. At once Hermione rushes to his side, sitting down on the arm of the couch so she looms over him. She’s wearing jeans and a t-shirt, meaning she didn’t come to visit him directly from work. Hermione leans over and drapes an arm over Harry’s shoulder resting her head against his shoulder, puffing hair getting in his face.
Harry is flipping through television channels when Draco comes back into the room. He has a mug in each hand, both of them filled with tea. He shoves one in Harry’s general direction, who takes it carefully trying to avoid any spillage. Draco sits down on the couch beside him balancing his own cup of tea.
I am so excited to announce there will soon be a part 2 to this story! I had so many ideas for this fic that did not end up working in this story so I really felt like I needed a part two. It won't be as long as this fic and the next chapter should be out in a few weeks.
As they leave the room he hears Hermione asking if Draco’s been reading the books she gave him, though they’re too far away for Harry to hear Draco’s response. Harry already knows what the answer will be, he’s seen Draco on multiple occasions digging through the books Hermione gave him. He seems to devour them, flipping through the pages like its a picture book. He can’t even comprehend how Draco’s able to do that.
“Um no?” Harry says giving Charlie a confused look. Charlie doesn’t really know Draco, despite the stuff that he’s heard or the stuff that’s been published in the Daily Prophet or Witch Weekly. It’s clear immediately that he holds less animosity towards Draco than Ron and George.
Greystone and Ron both cast Stupefy but he darts out of the way before the spells can hit him. Harry casts a confundo but it is quickly blocked. He’s clearly a skilled wizard, able to block the casting of three skilled Aurors. Harry instantly knows is Rabastan Lestrange, he’s know to be a talented and powerful wizard and therefore would have no trouble blocking their spells.
Draco shoots him a surprised look curling his hands around the sleeves of his jumper. “Teddy said you wanted me to come to brunch?”
Harry wasn’t planning on inviting Draco, maybe one day when Draco has met enough of the Weasleys individuality so it won’t be so awkward. Two weeks of friendship after years of hate does not mean an automatic invite to Weasley family brunch.
There’s a creak and immediately Harry hurries back out into the hallway. He gets out just in time to see the wall directly above his head explode. Pieces of crown molding crumble onto the floor around them and into his hair. There’s a figure at the end of the hall, wearing baggy robes and a hood that covers his face. Their wand is still outstretched from the curse they just cast.
Harry agrees and leaves with food in hand to go to a friend Draco. It doesn’t take long, the Burrow isn’t all that big. He discovers Draco sitting at the dining room table talking to Charlie. Harry watches for a minute from the doorway as Draco lets out a small laugh at something that Charlie says and responds with something Harry can’t hear that makes Charlie grin. Harry knows Charlie’s attractive, Harry’s mature enough now to admit at fifteen he probably had a crush on him. Charlie also likes men and one time he and Harry had gone to a gay club which was fun while also leaving him with the feeling that he’s partying with his big brother.
They appear to have landed in a sitting room. It reminds him of all the pureblood manors he’s been in, looking like it belongs in an eighteenth-century novel. The room is filled with furniture that has to be at least a hundred years old, and a large portrait hangs on the wall which remains eerily quiet.
Harry can’t help but feels surprised at Ginny so casually bringing up Draco and inviting him to one of her quidditch games. “Do you like him?”
While he can tell she wants to say more about Draco Ginny refrains. “Have you spoken with Luna recently?”
“Is there anything else you need?” she questions running gentle fingers through his unruly hair. He’s sure that laying in a hospital bed has left it a mess, honestly, he’s surprised that Draco hasn’t said anything about it.
Ginny leaves after a bit, she wants to spend the rest of the afternoon resting before an early practice tomorrow. Percy heads out with her and its not much longer before Harry decides it's probably time for them to leave as well. Hermione and Ron are looking ready to leave, though it always takes a bit of extra effort from Hermione to usher them into the floo.
Harry shakes his head. “There’s no need, I’ll just force Ron to fill out all the paperwork about the mission.”
Harry turns to look at Mrs. Greengrass. “Are there any other rooms in the Manor with extra warding?”
Hope everyone enjoyed this chapter! as always thank you for all the comments and kudos. The next chapter will hopefully be posted shortly.
Harry gives him a confused look. “Why would I lie about him being a veela? That’s a pretty strange thing to lie about.”
Harry’s not sure when the two of them became close enough friends to start swapping books. He’s surprised that they’ve never connected before, they are both kind of nerdy and both of them are insanely smart. The potions Draco brews aren’t just standard things found in a first or second year’s textbooks. Instead, Harry knows that they’re most special orders from St. Mungos. There’s no way or time to explain all the ways in which Hermione is a genus.
“I shouldn’t have brought Malfoy, I should have just told Teddy no,” Harry says in a rush feeling like a colossal fool. Just because he is beginning to feel okay being around Draco doesn’t mean he should expect everyone else to.
“Draco and Fleur have been talking up a storm, if only they were talking in Romanian I’d actually be able to keep up,” Charlie says with a laugh.
Harry wants to snicker but he swallows it down. “She’s not going to be gone forever. Luna told me she’ll be back within a year. You could go and visit her during the off season, that’s only three months away.”
“I want to hit you,” Ginny grumbles, and Harry thinks about how far their relationship has come, and he adores that they now treat each other like siblings. She mocks him tirelessly and in turn, he has made it his mission to annoy her till she’s at her wit’s end.
Teddy goes stomping up the stairs to see Draco at Harry's words. Harry feels like Teddy is up there forever, he’s about to go up and see if Teddy's bothering Draco when he hears the sound of footsteps on the stairs. It's not just the light patter of Teddy's feet but the heavier steps of an adult, of Draco’s. He appears at the bottom of the stairs looking slightly disheveled but fully dressed and even wearing shoes.
McAdams jumps up at once, sandwich fully forgotten as the three of them rush to the floo. They push their way to the front, shouting out that they are in a very important Auror business. They each shout out the address of Greengrass Manor and feel a pull at the base of their stomach that comes with traveling through the floo.
McAdams has a half-eaten sandwich on his desk and what seems to be the other half in his mouth. As he sees them approaching he garbles out. “What’s going on?”
Mrs. Weasley’s face breaks into a wide smile at Draco’s response and places a giant cinnamon bun from the plate into her arms onto Draco’s plate. Draco’s careful breakfast of eggs, toast, and fruit salad has been destroyed and Mrs. Weasley looks delighted. “You can call me Molly.”
“We’ll go and ask him then,” Harry responds in a moment of what seems like brilliance but is actually complete stupidity. There is no way that Draco will agree to go; on the weekends Draco doesn’t even seem to get up before noon. Harry can’t conceive of a world where Draco agrees to come to breakfast with Harry and Teddy to the Burrow.
Ron gives Harry a pat on the back. “Don’t worry about George mate, its been a tough week. Fred and George’s birthday is coming up… it’s always a tough time.”
“Merlin’s bloody balls,” Ron hiss quickly blocking another diffindo spell that Lestrange cast their way. “Greystone get him to St. Mungos!”
“We haven’t caught him yet, but I promise we’re going to try to keep your mother safe,” Harry knows it's not something he really should be promising but he thinks if it was his own parents that what he’d want to hear it.
Hi everyone! I hope everyone enjoyed I can't believe this fic is almost done. I started writing this almost a year ago and it's crazy to have it be closed to finished. I know a lot of people are probably surprised by how this story went. for me I always wanted the tension to be in the suspense of the idea that Rabastan attacking. I also wanted to make Draco and Narcissa the hero's in the end. Thank you everyone who left comments and kudos!
Harry turns and slips his legs off the bed, swinging them back and forth experimentally. He’s wearing long hospital pants in a shade of pastel blue, but they bulge out slightly from the bandages on his legs. Malfoy leans over and offers a shoulder for Harry to lean on. They’re about the same height, so when Malfoy stands up Harry stands up with him. There’s an instant shock of pain that goes through him, and he grips onto the bed to keep himself standing.
'I don't want to put him through any more pain, Harry.  It is not necessary for him to feel a thing.'
'You know you have me, Harry.'  Draco squeezed his eyes shut, tears escaping through the tighly closed lids.  'I think in a way you always have.'  He couldn't understand why the words were coming from him now.  He had guarded them closely for so long.  'I...I thought I could be alone, I didn't want to bring someone into the life I had.  I vowed to never do that.  I thought that it would be simple, and it was.  For so long it was.  Until...until I...I was...was...  Until you.'  He stopped, setting aside his book and easing his aching body to the floor.  Harry helping him, touching him.
'He knew.  He told us, but we did it anyway.'  Harry began pacing in front of Hagrid's hut.  Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall deciding that Harry needed to work through his rage before going in to see Draco.  'He is never going to forgive me.'
She watched silently as Harry stepped forward, finally breaking out of the spell they both seemed to be under.
The lax body was carried into the Forest, there was nothing that could be done for him, nothing that would be done.  He was as good as dead.
It wasn't done, Harry always slept above the covers, always with his back against the headboard, awkward, but sleeping none the less.  But not now, not tonight.
'Honestly, I can't believe it!'  Harry was indignant, huffing out his exasperation.  'I'm going to find out who made this and write a strongly worded letter.'  Once again turning the card, his own surprised face blinking up at him.  'It's not funny!'
'Don't.  Please, Granger.  Please just...  Don't be kind.'  He had to look away, fixing his eyes on the desk before him, on the words swimming across his battered textbook.  'Please.  Go.'  He could hear himself babbling, moments away from breaking down entirely.  Why were the voices always so close?
'I don't think it was ever love.'  Harry replied softly, his voice quieter than normal.  'I wanted it to be, but...  She always deserved more then I could ever give her.  She loved me, she told me so, but I could never bring myself to say it back.  I wasn't kind.'  He drew idle patterns on Draco's thigh, distracting himself from the myriad of emotions that Ginny had raised.
'But you do.  And you always have.'  Draco smiled softly, his fists bunching in Harry's jumper.  'You belong with the Weasley's, Harry.  They are the family you need, and they are the family you love.'
'It's good to see you too!'  Harry laughed.  'I saw your light on and I thought...'  Harry was unable to finish his sentence before being forcibly pulled into the warm hut.
Harry pulls his mouth off and says, “You can blow it where you want to,” though Harry absolutely wants Draco to finish in his mouth.
“I do. But I also don’t want to leave you. They’ll come for you too,” Draco said, brushing his hands through her dark brown hair.
Draco shares a look of camaraderie with Hermione and she gives him a small smile. Next to Draco Harry is sitting back and smiling.
The joint passes around until it’s back with Draco. He inhales again, relaxing and trying not to cough. He passes it to Harry as he exhales.
He kisses Draco’s cheek and puts an arm around his back. Good, Harry can touch him again without sending his dick into overdrive. Progress. For the moment, anyhow.
“Right. Anyhow… I broke up with Pansy. Not because she was a vampire. But the guy who made her worked for… you know…
Draco couldn’t help but take in the shirtless figure that he had shared a bed with. Harry was every bit as gorgeous as he had been before Draco had moved away. He wasn’t as ripped as he was in high school anymore but he was still pretty fit. Harry rubbed dark fingers through his black hair, glaring at Draco with interest.
Darlene lied and told them some man had come in and attacked her then ran off with Charlie’s body into the woods. Pansy had been nice a full of energy after feeding, enough to be able to race off with Charlie’s body and be back in a flash. They’d find him eventually. At least if they figured out she did it she’d get to find out who she was.
He supposes Draco is feeling very grateful. It feels amazing and looks even better. He’s glad Draco can take much more of his dick into his mouth than Harry can of Draco’s.
Draco comes over, immediately catching the eyes of the other woman with Ginny, still standing outside. Hermione Granger. A chubby Black girl who has a lot more piercings than when he last saw her. He doesn’t recall her being goth either. He supposes people change.
“It’s fine. Just all part of the adventure, right?” Harry says and puts an arm around Draco, pulling him to his side.
“I told you. I told you a thousand times. Not another woman. And Christ, Darlene, this one looks half your age,” Charlie said, sounding disgusted.
Astoria smiled and said, “I’m stronger than you. I can handle myself. And I have a plan if everything goes badly. Besides, this is your family’s town. His people won’t touch the name Malfoy. Not if they know what’s good for them.”
Draco inhales and tries again: “Everything I did was all to protect myself. If I was the toughest, most scary kid other kids couldn’t fuck with me. And my father would be proud. Proud that I wasn’t a pussy or whatever else he said.”
. No, he doesn’t want to go out with Draco Malfoy. The idea is ridiculous. He gets out of bed and goes to the bathroom. When he gets back he has a message waiting from Draco.
Astoria was watching the news again, lying on her side to face the small bedroom TV. Draco sighed as he walked into the room.
“When I have I ever caused you guys trouble?” Pansy asked, wildly swinging her sword at Alicia who dodged and parried every time.
“Harry, a fire like that… you would need forensics to find any evidence,” Draco said honestly, not wishing to hurt Harry.
“Does it have a scan function? You could just keep telling it to scan until it finds something,” Draco said.
Draco closed his eyes begrudgingly and tried to sleep. He tried not to think about Harry. He tried not to think about Pansy Parkinson. And he tried not to think about his wife, Astoria. Twenty-four hours ago he had been with her, safe in her arms. Now he didn’t know where she was. And somewhere out east
There are trees as far as the eye can see. It starts to rain so the windows go back up. Harry dozes off for a while. Draco wonders if he’s getting enough sleep at night. He has to remember to ask him about that later.
Pansy was there, only her face visible by moonlight for the rest of her body was covered in black death trooper gear.
By the time Pansy had her jeans back on, Daphne was fully dressed and messing with hair in the mirror.
“We don’t. Their apartment isn’t really haunted. We’re just gonna act real tough. Make a scene. Then we get to eat,” Angelina said, gesturing at Pansy and Alicia with two fingers to follow.
The trail goes on. Harry hopes at some point he and Draco will be able to go camping. That could be fine. If it isn’t raining too much.
“How was your day?” Draco asks as he pulls out of the apartment parking lot, classical music of all things blasting on the stereo.
“Come on. We’ve got a lot more to go. We’re not heading back until you can hardly bear to walk anymore.”
Unsure what he’s trying to say, Harry just leans over to quickly kiss Draco again then gets out of the car, beyond flustered. After a shower he gets on his laptop, opening Google and searching for ‘biting’.
“Hmm. I don’t know what went wrong with Cho. I think we just drifted apart. And she was interested in someone else. I was interested in Ginny.”
“Do you want to come in my mouth?” Harry asked, then licked up Draco’s shaft before gliding his mouth up and down the head again.
Draco leans back, fingers on his cheek as he says, “Maybe they’d think we were burying the hatchet.”
“I didn’t kill nobody. I did feed off some of the corpses. But these guys use guns and I never really cared for guns. So loud,” Pansy said, touching her eyes and cringing.
Harry has a hand on Draco’s back. It slides down to his ass and squeezes, Draco’s dick jumping in response, already painfully hard in his pants. The comforter and sheets are bunched up between their bodies, creating an accidental barrier. Draco needs every part of him to touch every part of Harry. He needs-
“Yeah. You see, you-know-who wanted to swell his forces. He wanted Death Troopers who could come swarming in the night. He wanted people to fear leaving their homes. He wanted people to fear the dark. Fear us. So he did some real deep, dark magic and he brought us back,” Pansy said.
“I’m pretty sure no one lives here. That For Sale sign has been up for at least a year,” Harry said.
“That’s a nice dick, Harry. I’m almost jealous. Not too big. Not too small. Just the right amount of big,” Draco says, grabbing it as soon as Harry is in reach and pulling him close.
Draco winks and gets in the car. They’ve already decided to get food, stopping in a nearby town for burgers, which they both devour.
Pansy didn’t mind being a vampire but having a vampire master hadn’t worked out so well for her. He could tell her what to do… Pansy hurt people. Not any people she had liked and they had all been really tasty but it wasn’t good for her social life. Yeah. She could forgive Draco. He might be the only friend she had left. She knew he would never love her again but that was OK.
“You just sucked every ounce of come out of my body through my dick like it was a straw,” Draco says as if that was answer enough.
After several more near climaxes, Draco turns the toy off, dropping it on the bed then coming behind Harry and sliding his dick between Harry’s thighs, rubbing it against Harry’s own dick, the size difference incredibly apparent. There was no contest or comparison.
But Astoria wasn’t here to numb that pain. She was back east, hopefully safe. Instead, Draco was alone with the object of his desire and he was filled with confusion. He was angry at himself for wondering if Harry could ever return those feelings. He darkly wondered what sort of a God would fill his creation with unwanted love but he supposed that given the state of things that God was no longer on the premises. God was gone and they only had themselves now.
Draco checks himself over. White button-up, black slacks, both custom-tailored to fit him just right. He’s immaculate but simple. He puts on a Baume & Mercier silver wristwatch and a few rings as final touches. He’s been trying very hard to downplay his connection to money but he would allow himself a little extravagance.
Draco’s starting to think they should’ve gotten this out of their system before hanging out with Harry’s friends. Had this been a normal fourth date they both would’ve been sweaty and naked by now.
“I’m definitely gonna need a large,” Harry says, breathing hard as he fumbles about, presumably for his phone.
“I opened my mind. Opened the door in my mind that read Men on the front of it and stepped through. I just let myself think of it. And I watched some gay porn to see if I liked that. And I did.”
Draco thinks for a moment then says, “What’s one thing that happened to you that you’ve never told anyone?”
The following night they were attacking a nest of suspected Death Troopers. Pansy was pretty excited to get some action. They’d been chasing after a werewolf for weeks and that hadn’t been much fun.
Pansy wandered around, looking for a bathroom. She didn’t need to pee. Her arms seemed to be healing quickly. She thought maybe if she just splashed some water on her face she would feel better. It didn’t sound like anyone else was in the house. Just that nice farmer lady downstairs.
“Hello, nephew. I didn’t expect you to be here,” Bellatrix said, sauntering over in their direction.
“Me too. I’ve been thinking about taking off,” Daphne said, stretching her entire body, her back lifting in an arch.
“That’s odd. And also makes it even more likely that us both losing our memories at the same time is related,” Harry said.
“I’m saying… I would’ve liked to have had the chance to be interested. Who knows what could’ve happened?” Harry said.
“Me either. We’ve both lived in Western Washington all our lives. You’d think we’d know what the trees are.”
Draco has him out of the cuffs fast. Harry guides him onto the bed then gets between his legs. He grabs Draco’s dick with both hands and resumes sucking it. Somehow it seems like he can take more of it. Maybe he just doesn’t care how much it strains his jaw or makes it hard to breathe. He just sucks hard, hungrily drooling down the big shaft.
Draco turned the heat on the stovetop off, pouring the chili into a bowl. He then went and set the saucepan in the sink. Draco was much better about doing his dishes than Harry. But Harry thought, in his own defense, he spent a lot of time washing dishes at work. Surely he could be excused a little.
Bellatrix laughed, swiping her hand and a silver blast knocked Pansy back, rolling somewhere down the hill.
Draco desperately tried to turn but he spun out a little, screeching across the pavement. He realized he should’ve gotten a better rental as he drove fast in the opposite direction, heading towards Harry’s neighborhood. Gunshot blasted his back window, shattering it.
'He will be okay.'  A soft voice close to her ear made Hermione start.  She turned to the person now standing beside her.
Neville knew that he had no longer had a choice, he would have to confront Harry.  Had to know if Ginny was the reason he no longer slept in his own bed.  Was he still seeing her?  Was she cheating on Dean?
Only it was Harry.  His fingers gripping the door too tightly, his jaw set, his eyes red from crying.
Harry had seen.  Seen all he wanted so desperately to protect him from.  There was no Dementor, no murdered parents.  There was no Voldemort for Harry.
There was a thirst about the damaged form, an ache so strong that there would never be salvation.  All the water in the world would never be enough to quench the drought that was slowly claiming his life.
'I don't have the time, all right!'  He snapped at her.  'I'm not the important one in all of this.  He is.'
'You don't have to take it, you don't even have to touch it.  But it is yours.'  She told him gently, carefully chosing her words.  'It may not be compatible with you, that is something we shall learn, together.'
'I...I won't tell anyone, Draco.  I swear.'  Harry whispered, his back pressed against the door, watching as Draco parted his cracked lips, ready for the vitriol and bile of his hatred toward him to spill forth.  It didn't come.  Instead tears flooded down his pale face, his mouth choking out a name.
And he would know.  Harry would know what he had put to use.  He would imagine the sight.  Blame himself forever.  Carry the burden of knowing it was something that had once belonged to him, that he had given freely to provide a little warmth, a little comfort.  Not eternal sleep, not the coldness of death.
Harry traced the way the lash weaved over Draco's body, the tip of his fingers barely touching him, lest he bring on the plague of Draco's pain.
'Dark.'  Draco babbled, confused.  'Can't...can't go...  Back.'  His head shook against Harry's shoulder, heavy tears leaking, running over Harry's neck.  'They...They will come for me.'
'It's not like that, Neville.  Don't turn it into something sordid. You don't understand what's been happening with Draco.'
'Don't you lot have anything else to talk about?'  Neville's arrival was a welcome salvation from Harry's growing ire.  He slid up to Harry, putting a calming hand on his back, unnoticed from the gossiping others.  'We haven't seen each other for ages, and all you want to do is stand around and talk about Malfoy.  Ron, your little sister just got engaged!'  Neville grinned, watching Ginny as she proudly displayed her glittering ring to the small crowd that had begun to gather around her.
That sound of the door again.  Someone was leaving.  But he wasn't left alone, not this time.  He felt a dip where he lay, there was someone sitting beside him.  Draco felt no fear.  This person was kind, gentle.  Green eyes flashed inexplicably through his head.
'I'll never forget, not any of it.  For as long as I live.'  He admitted quietly, closing his eyes.  'I couldn't.'
'But he does.'  Draco told him gently, having to ignore Harry's tears and the way he held him.  'He knows exactly who I am, and what I have done.  He loves you, Harry.  He's scared and confused and hurt and full of grief.  Don't be angry with him, none of this is his fault.  He has already lost one brother, I won't allow him to lose you too.'
There had been one other.  A single kiss he dared not think of.  A kiss that was only ever friendship, a helping hand, a kiss to make him realise.  To help him understand, finally, who he was and what he really wanted.
'You lie.  You brought this upon yourself.  Your parents dance because of you, they died because of you.'  A sickening grin, a wet touch of a tongue against his cheek.  'I can make them do so much more.  What would you like to see them do?'
Draco reeled back, Nott taking full advantage and pushing his face into Draco's, his coffee filled breath turning Draco's blood to ice.
Down on his knees, his hand fisted in blond hair that hung in lank, sparse patches.  Draco's head wrenched upwards, forced to look at what awaited him.  This was his future, his past and present.
'Have they planned their mutiny yet?  Or am I to be thrown to the wolves?'  Draco said, only half joking.
'Too ashamed of me, is that it?  Caught snogging a Death Eater in the precious Gryffindor common room.  Whatever next.'  His voice was bitter, stinging with anger and resentment.  The Boy Who Lived has really lost his mind now.  I should have let Voldemort kill me once and for all, it would have been easier for everyone, for them, to grieve over their marvelous hero.'
'He will never agree to this.'  Madam Pomfrey said quietly after closing the door on the two boys.  'He is too headstrong.'
'It's okay, now Draco.  You are safe here.'  The face of the woman came into view, a soft, caring face.  One that had looked after him before. It was Madam Pomfrey holding out the water.  'You are back at Hogwarts.'
Did he know where Draco lay?  Did he know that Voldemort was making sure he saw it all in mindless flashes of red, of consuming fire.  The images disjointed, out of time.  Did he know where Draco curled up on the cold floor, waiting for the endless visits?  Would he have carried him away?  Risked his life for a tantrum throwing, spoilt child?  What use were questions that had never been voiced, it was done, dead and gone and over.  It didn't matter now, Snape was dead, they were all dead.
Like a lot of little boys, he had collected them.  Spent his generous pocket money on the frivolity.  Each one new from the packet, chocolate devoured in moments, the cards a little treasure to be looked over, read and ultimately forgotten, thrown into his bedside draw, waiting for the collection to grow.
He could do this, he could watch in silence as McGonagall told his fellow students that Draco would be joining them, that he would be spending his days, evenings and nights with them, in this tower, in the den of the lions.
'I fucking heard you!'  He shouted into the quiet room.  'You had to ruin it, didn't you.  You had to ruin my night.'
Draco's loose fingers danced slowly up Harry's arm.  Brushing over his dirt stained robes, his path a slow, sure one as he grazed his gentle touch higher.  Across his shoulder, over the pink blush of his swallowing throat.  A brief flicker of heartache caught in Harry's eyes as Draco's hand finally settles on his wet streaked cheek.
'No.'  His word was final.  'It's this way or nothing.  Harry's knows that, this is the agreement.  He and I are not friends out here,'  He waved his hand weakly.  'It wouldn't work, it wouldn't be understood.  Harry needs his friends.  They are the only family he has left.  I am not going to take that from him.'
'Harry...'  He gasped, his hands reaching out to touch the solid chest of the body in front of him, to ground him, to make him realise that he was real, that Harry was real.
'I can't go back to how we were.'  Harry pulled away, held Draco at arms length, needing to see those silver eyes once again.  'Tell me we won't.  Tell me that we can do this, that we get through this.  I...I can't lose you, Draco.  Not now, not ever.'
'No.'  Harry knew he had seen enough of the glass to last him a lifetime.  He curled his hand around it again, the press deep and painful, allowing it it's little moment of glory before tossing is across the room.  He didn't listen out for the sound of it landing.  The glass now little more than a bad memory.  'Don't ever, ever say sorry.  Not for this, not for anything.'
'Harry...'  McGonagall paused, uncharacteristically unable to find the right words.  'There...there has been a problem.'
'Yeah, difficult, you said.'  Ron snarled.  'But you never said why.  She used to cry over you, I would listen to her.  At night, when she thought she couldn't be heard.  You broke her heart, Harry.  And you didn't seem to care.'
'Promise me.  Just promise me that you'll let me stay.  That you won't say sorry, that you won't turn me away.'
Cho and her salty tears.  Sweet and kind and beautiful Cho.  It was never going to work out between them, and they had known that all along.  But it was still a memory that often made him smile, made his palms damp whenever it came to mind.
'No, please.'  Draco begged, his stomach turning to liquid.  'Please.'  He could hear the collective sound of wands being drawn.
Ron would clap him on the back and tell him it was forgotten.  A moment of madness.  It didn't mean anything.  They would all laugh about the foolishness of the situation, and go back to normal.
'I want to.'  Harry answered with his own cheeks colouring, almost apologetic of his admission of care.  This was all so new to him, new and strange.  And with Malfoy.  Just moments ago they had been sharing shy kisses in the dark, now this.  'I like having you here.'
'Draco would tell you otherwise.'  She told him kindly, well aware that Harry was not himself.  He was tired, angry and frightened.
The person who had always been a threat to the life he lived had become the only one who could make him feel safe.
There had been very little she and McGonagall could do about his back last night.  It would have killed the boy had they tried to tackle the infection when he was so very weak.  It was now safe to apply the potion that would enable his body to begin the healing process.
Draco forcing himself to stay awake, blinking back the grit and fear.  Wanting so desperately to give in, to close his exhausted eyes and forget, if only for a moment.
Harry couldn't stand it a moment longer.  He pulled Draco tight to him, knowing that he had to be causing considerable pain.  But Draco didn't cry out.  He needed to be close to him, pain be damned.  He leaned into Harry, burying his face into Harry's jumper.
And then Draco sent him away.  Told him that he had to go, go and concentrate on his lessons, go and eat, sleep.  Spend the night apart.  Told him that he didn't want Harry to return until the morning.
'I thought you had gone.'  Draco's eyes flickered as Harry stepped near.  Opening.  'I though after all of that, you wouldn't come back.'  He sounded so soft, so afraid, that Harry felt the weight of guilty tears welling once more.
He didn't remember someone dressing him, but someone surely had.  It wasn't permitted here.  Not here in the Cell.  Perhaps his begging had been answered?  Perhaps someone had finally taken pity?
Draco shook his head, squeezing his eyes tightly shut, refusing to allow his tears to escape.  'Don't do this, Harry.  Don't make me promises that you will have to break.  I...I cannot give you anything, I am not the person you need in your life.'  His voice tight, dry, lest he should break down and lean into Harry, beg him for just a moment of calm.
'Thinking about dinner, more than likely.'  She snorted, bending down to begin retrieving the little glass shards.  'You have to concentrate.  This is a very complicated potion, and I cannot afford to mess up my grade because you are always hungry.'
'There is a person, or several people, within this room who have deliberately set out to harm, humiliate and cause great distress, with no regard for the devastating consequences of their wicked actions.'  She allowed her crushing words to sink in, watching carefully for any spark of admission, any sign that the culprit held any remorse.  'Never, in all my years of being a teacher, and your headmistress, have I ever felt such shame towards any of my students.'  She saw more tears, she saw red faces and the tops of heads as her students lowered their gaze.
Hours passed, minutes.  Draco didn't know.  Harry was his world, his safety.  The only thing that Draco wanted.
Draco was broken beyond repair.  He was dirty, used.  His body was no longer his.  He couldn't allow someone as inherently good as Harry to be around someone like him, it just wasn't fair.  Harry was light, happiness, a life worth living.
Ginny breathing softly into his ear, whispering words of giggling encouragement that turned his face scarlet.  Her small hand wrapped around him, the swell of her breasts against his skin.  She touched, teased, her once gentle fingers tightening in her growing frustration.  Almost painful.
'Listen to me.'  Harry whispered against Draco's skin, his throat warming under his lips.  'If this is it, if tonight never happens again, then I will always treasure it.  There is no expectations, Draco, I won't ever think that way.  All I want is for you to feel safe with me, that is more important than anything.'
'H...H...Harry..?'  His ravaged throat scratched.  Who was Harry?  'Don't...don't wake...  Don't make me wake.'  A cough shook through his body, leaving him breathless.
She had taken the empty bowl from him, ignored his begging, and walked away from his reaching hands.
He hadn't asked him.  And if truth be told he had been afraid to.  Didn't really want the answer to what he suspected.  Ginny.
Her fur came out in clumps now whenever he took it on himself to groom her, her once sharp eyes cloudy with age.  She slept more, they both did.  Age was calling to them, and sometimes he felt like he was only too eager to rush towards it.
Now that everyone had turned from the breaking chaos of the corridor, all eyes were lighting on him.  Glaring and obvious, murmuring and stealthy, they all wanted to snatch a look at the person the Saviour had almost strangled in front of them.
Harry Potter rapidly blinking up at him from the golden frame, the ever present dark rimmed glasses valiantly trying so hard to hide those shocking green eyes of his.  He wondered what it would be like to see Harry without those glasses, to be on the receiving end of that naked green gaze.  A dream was all it ever would be.
Had it been days or weeks?  Draco never thought to count the nights, the days without end.  All he knew were these safe four walls.  Three people coming to visit.
Sweat soaked and sobbing, Draco had vomited down his front, the little soup he had managed to swallow over the last few days spilling down the pale yellow fabric of his top.  And, Harry realised with a hopeless lurch, he had lost control of his bladder.  The sheets beneath his body wet, his pyjamas sodden.
Still Draco couldn't answer.  And full of shame, he began to feel yet more tears leaking down his cheeks.
No.  Ron was more than his friend.  He was his family, his brother.  He had wanted to hurt him for his words.  He had only seen red, only heard the hatred exploding from that kind face, words of cold-hearted anger, directed at the person Harry had come to...
That familiar face blinking up at him owlishly from behind glasses he had never been without.  His scar prominent, his eyes verdant and full of surprise.
'Make it up with him, Harry.  And Hermione.  Don't throw them aside.'  Draco was pulling away, releasing his hold from Harry's jumper.  'Take back your friendships and never let them go.  Forget about all of this mess, it was brief, it didn't matter, not in the grand scheme of things.  I hope, one day, you can look back at this, at me, and smile.  And know that I was right.'
Harry stood quietly in the doorway of the bathing room.  Watching silently, scrubbing a towel through his shower wet hair.
His usually impeccable clothes were little more than tattered rags, hanging off a limp body.  This wasn't the Lucius Malfoy of old.  With his snaked topped cane and sleek hair, sly smile and air of superiority.
'Yes, my lord.'  A figure in a mask answering.  Why bother with a mask?  Draco knew that voice.  This man was a father to a friend, a man he had known, a man who had raped him moments ago.
'Spit it out, Malfoy.'  Ron sighed, all his anger vanishing in the face of Malfoy's obvious distress.  This was not the same childish boy from his youth.
Or Professor McGonagall.  Would it be her?  Arriving with books under her arm, a ready smile on her usually stern face.  Only to find him, alone and silent under the water.
Draco couldn't stop the rush of tears, burying his face into Harry's chest and gasping sobs against him.  'Y...you s...shouldn't say things l...like that.'
'Yes.'  She nodded, reaching for a smile that would not come.  'That is all you can do.  And it has to be enough.'
'Be brave, Draco.'  She had whispered, her mask already turned from him, her head seeming to dip lower.  Surely she could not be sad for him, the very notion unthinkable. 'You cannot hope to survive what the Dark Lord commands of you.'  Her pronouncement stained with unspoken regret.
'And you know that for sure, do you, Harry?'  Neville asked, wanting a reason behind Harry's stupid behaviour.
'Not like last night.'  McGonagall told him gently.  'But it might be good for the boy if there was someone with him.  You were very brave to stay, Harry.'
Milly's anger dulled.  How could she keep her hot anger in the face of Greg's brokenhearted distress.  Would she have done the very same thing if she had been in his position?
Punishment had been seriously lacking in his later years around Hogwarts, and should anyone ask him, the more traditional methods had been for the best.
They had tried.  Tried to save him, tried to not watch.  But it was all in vain.  The last memory Draco had of his parents had been terrible, too cruel to think about.  If only they had kept their silence, if only they had watched quietly as Draco had suffered.  They might have still been alive.
All that was required of him was to pick himself up off the stinking floor and walk towards that smile, a taint of something more.
And all Draco had offered in return was a weak, watery smile whenever their paths had happened to cross.
'It's not true.'  Harry whispering to him, his hand warm and gentle, his thumb rubbing along the back of Draco's hand.
'No.'  Draco whispered, tearing his eyes away.  'I had a wand, once.  This is n...not mine.'  His flooding eyes met hers.  Why couldn't she understand?  His own wand was gone, broken.  Snapped cleanly in half, tossed aside like it meant nothing.
'Don't ever be ashamed.  Don't ever think that you are not worth anything.'  He took a breath, knowing what was about to spill from his lips.  'You are beautiful.'  He found his skin again, pushing his hand up and under the soft cotton top.  His palm against Draco's back.  'You are warm, alive.  That's all I could ever wish for.'  His fingers sure, stroking across that evil he found, the raised scars that caused so much pain.  Serpents twisting across once smooth skin.  All the terrible things that were done to the boy who lay in his arms.
Slippers, dressing gown, wand and glasses.  It had almost never varied.  Almost.  He left one night with his Invisibility Cloak, and never returned with it, the same thing happened with The Marauders Map, shoved carelessly into a pocket.  Sometimes he emerged from behind the hanging drapes fully clothed, despite retiring in his sleepwear.
He shivered in his t-shirt.  Wrapping his arms around himself did little to help.  He had left the common room with nothing.  His wand abandoned on the floor, along with any shred of dignity left to him.  He was a monster, pulling his wand on his best friend like that.
'I have to go.'  He blurted, clutching his bag to his chest, as if to shield himself from the crushing weight of the simple spell that flowed around him.  It prickled, it burned.  'I'm sorry.'
But not now.  Now he was a friend with terrible injuries, horrific memories and an uncertain future.  Alone, scared.
She was so good, kind.  She never reprimanded or demanded.  But still he would catch the disappointment in her eyes, her sadness as she carried away the hardly touched meals.
It had always been important to him to be the first one out of bed, the first one to roam the halls.  It was his duty, his job, to be aware of all the comings and goings of Hogwarts, one he never took lightly.   And this particular morning was no different to the rest.
Madam Pince, ever aware of the time, looked around her Library, mindful of the students who had filed in and out of the room all evening.  It was hard to keep track of who had left.  But as she surveyed the room, she was grateful that it was now empty, save for one bright lamp that continued to burn long after the rest had been extinguished.  And the student who continued to reside at one of the tables.
'They are all dead now.'  Theo glanced around the corridor, the crowds had thinned out, just a few clueless stragglers now headed up to the Great Hall.  'Almost all.'
He knew she was coming, had been waiting for the knock, but the slight tap at the door still sent his heart racing, his palms clammy.  Why couldn't he just be left alone?  What harm would it do?
'I...I think...'  Harry stuttered, turning his head away.  'I don't know.'  He finally admitted, fiddling with a dog-eared corner of his Transfiguration text book, he wouldn't meet her eyes.  'It doesn't matter, I'm fine.'
This pale, pathetic creature, with tear tracks etched into his sunken cheeks.  Would they be shocked at the way his hands always shook as he jambed the bottle under the tap, filling it clumsily, the water wetting the sleeves of his pyjamas.
The shock at Harry's words had Neville take a step back.  The pure anger radiating from Harry was overwhelming, and Neville had to pause to wonder if he was about to lash out, unleash some curse at him.
Harry picked up Draco's hand, threading his fingers through Draco's.  Fragile bones shifting under translucent skin.
'He is not going to leave the boy in a hurry, Minerva.'  Poppy sighed.  'But I for one am glad that Draco has found someone.  It has been a long time since he has had anyone looking after him.  His injuries are a testament to that.'
With a racing heart Draco caught the flash of black hair, the glint of the growing sun catching on the edge of glasses.
'I never said that!'  Hermione almost squeaked, her hand turning to Ron and delivering the same weak slap that Harry had received.  'I was just thinking about you and him, stuck here together for the whole of Christmas.  It must have been horrible.'
He could slip a shining knife into his pocket during Potions.  No one would know.  Just tuck it carefully away, think about it later.
'You knew.'  Milly's whip crack voice was like a death knell crashing over him.  'You did, didn't you?'  She asked the question Greg had dreaded ever since Draco had returned to the school, a haunted shell of the boy they had all known so well.  Finally, he had been discovered in his torturous treachery.  'That's why you told Theo to leave him alone, why you were so adamant.'  She set her hands on her hips, her eyes dark and dangerous in the dim light they hid behind.  'Oh, it all makes sense now.'  She spat, her ire growing by the moment.  'All this time.  You knew, and you kept it quiet. Like the filthy secret it became.'
'Yeah.'  Harry answered, forcing his voice to work, hoping that it didn't sound like he had been crying for most of the night.
'What about that girl you were dating?  Ginny, is that her name?  Doesn't she wonder where you are all the time?'
Only, only he wasn't like that with anyone else.  He could hardly imagine sitting with Ron in this way, or Hermione, or anyone.  Only Draco.
In his unfocused wandering, Harry had lit upon an uncovered patch of skin that Draco had not known was there.  Always so very careful to hide himself from Harry's view, he had allowed his top to ride up, just a little, just an inch.  It must have happened in his sleep, he didn't know, had been too careless in his movements.
'Harry.'  Draco breathed, his bag falling from his fingers, silently praying that he wouldn't break down.  His heart was racing, pounding so loudly that it was a wonder Harry couldn't hear it from where he stood.  He knew he needed to get away from this place, this moment.  Needed to get as much distance between him and Harry as possible.  This was just too cruel.
Draco lay exhausted, his mind stretched to breaking point yet again, his hand carefully held by Harry.  It wasn't enough.  It would never be enough.
The beckoning darkness was his world, the hooked fingers curling towards him, dragging him back, urging him in.
'Come along, Draco.'  McGonagalls words finally broke through the relentless pounding in his skull.  The way she turned to Draco, the way she put her hand carefully on his scar covered back, it all made Harry want to scream.  It should have been him doing that.  It should have been him leading Draco to his new bed, the one placed near his own.
'And Harry has lost everyone he has ever been close to.  Every person he had the chance to look up to, anyone he could see as family.  They have gone.  All he has left are the Dursleys, and you know they will never be his family.'
She swirled towards him, body bloated and deformed.  Her eyelids peeled back to reveal milky white orbs that focused on nothing and everything.  She too tried to make her voice heard in the crushing silence of the darkened corridor.  A bubble burst from her slack jaw,  an inaudible gurgle that spoke of nothing more than the death of her lungs.
'Professor McGonagall.'  His tremulous voice called out into the silence, the sound echoing throughout the Great Hall.  And Greg resolutely had to ignore all the faces as they turned in his direction, as he grasped tight to Milly's hand.  He had to do this, he had to help end Draco's torment.  'I have your answers.'
'Not to worry.'  She told him kindly.  'I can help, it's what I'm here for.'  Sitting beside him, she carefully put the glass to his lips, tipping it slightly.  'You don't dream when Harry is with you, do you.'  It wasn't a question, she knew.
It was good, now.  The Castle had been through the worst of it and come out the other side.  Walls that had once bore the scars of battles were scrubbed clean, floors broken by heavy boots and sparking spells had been repaired.  All was well within Hogwarts.
Harry tugged him back to rest against his warming body, his legs sliding either side of him.  Pressed so tightly together.  Draco could feel his face heat up at the unexpected intimacy of the act.  He stuttered, grasping for words that wouldn't come, for a protest that felt hollow.  He wanted this, more than anything in the world.  How could Harry keep doing this to him?  Make him feel like nothing was more important than just sitting in the dark, his body so very close.
'Fang?'  Hagrid ventured deeper into the trees, following his Boarhound's low cry.  'What you up to, boy?'  His voice unsteady.  Fang was not one for making a fuss, something had rattled him.
Draco couldn't know what had come over him.  Whether it was her hand on him, or the soft look in her pretty eyes, but he found himself nodding.
Draco felt the panic rising.  He needed the green eyed boy from his dreams.  He didn't want to be left alone.  But he couldn't ask, he wouldn't ask.  Harry had already helped him, it was asking too much to beg him to stay.  What would he think?  They were not friends, never even close.  Draco knew that ship had sailed long ago, it wasn't possible to go back, to take away all the hurt they had caused each other, all the words and curses.  All the anger and frustration.
'We are not friends.'  Draco told her quietly.  'We never have been.'  He turned his head away from the water, from her searching gaze.
There were no pictures of his parents, no half remembered letters or gifts.  No graves to visit or house to grieve in.  No childhood toys or clothes that smelled like home.  Nothing that spoke of his past life, only the one he had now.
'I...'  He was already stuttering, searching for an answer that Harry would believe.  'I wasn't expecting to see anyone out.  They...  They took me by surprise, that's all.'
'I'm going to put you to sleep now, Draco.'  Madam Pomfrey spoke to him, holding out the tiny bottle, inky black against the light from the window.
'Touch him, Harry.'  McGonagall instructed, a tight band around her chest.  She steadfastly refused to cry.
The Headmistress allowed herself a secret smile as she kept to her distance.  Harry was talking.  Whispered words that had Draco nodding, his face turned to Harry as they took tiny steps closer to their goal.  Draco was also smiling, his eyes slipping closed through sheer exhaustion, his expression warm as Harry leaned just that little bit closer, dusting a kiss to his pale cheeks.
'Too hard to talk to me?  Best friends, Harry.  Bloody Hell.'  He turned his back.  'Why?  Why have you quit the team?  Why now?'
Removing the stopper, he took it to his sink and upended it into the bowl, watching as the cold water swirled away down the plug.
'I believe we may have.'  McGonagall told him, taking the place Harry had vacated.  'Draco, could I ask you a few questions?  You may find them difficult to answer.'
'Are you okay, Harry?'  Hermione dropped back so she could walk beside him, taking Ron along with her.  'You have been rather quiet recently.'
'You do realise that is impossible, don't you?'  Harry smiled.  'You could never be ignored, Draco.'  A hint of teasing in his voice.  'I gave up trying to do that years ago.'
'I want you to have this.'  Draco spoke, placing a small parcel in Harry's lap.  Wrapped in white tissue paper, pale blue string holding it all in place.  'It's old, I'm afraid.  I had no money to get you anything properly, but...but I wanted to give you something.'
Harry had stayed, that was the start of it.  His friends had packed up their belongings, hitched bags onto shoulders, dragged heavy cases.  Harry had only watched.  His story a believable one, and half true.
It was almost easy to let Harry guide him, pull him closer and wrap his strong arms around his weak body.  It was easy to lay his head against Harry's shoulder, his own hands pressing into Harry's back, impossibly closer.
'I tell you what, lad, you look like you could do with a hug.'  Hagrid spoke, something in his heart twisting painfully at the sight of this child who had nowhere to turn.  'Would that be all right, do you think?'
He shared a dark cell with two bodies for company, and visitors that would make him scream, bleed and beg.  They had hands that would never cease, wands that would not heal, words that filled him with desperation.
I am not leaving Hogwarts.  It is my home now, and perhaps it always will be.  I ask only this of you, please do not come looking for me.
Curling spells of red fire lapping at his skin, curses that didn't even have to be spoken twisting in his gut, cracking his bones, forcing his body to open under each of them, forcing him to ask for things that even in his worst nightmares he would never do.
'The dead will stay that way, Theo.'  Millicent's voice timid, but so sure.  'Revenge is the path to madness.  The past has surely taught you that.'
To see him standing there before them all, a lone Slytherin in a sea of angry Gryffindors tried all of Harry's resolve.
There may not have been any Muggle books in Draco's life, but there wasn't a shortage of magical romance novels.
'I...  Ron, I'm sorry.'  Harry could feel his own tears beginning to well.  'It's...It's been hard.'
'He took everything from me, he left nothing behind.  My parents, my home, my future.  He even took my...my virginity.'  He gulped away the word, feeling so much shame rush through him.  'I will not allow him to take my voice.'
'That sick fucker tortured him, killed his parents in front of him!'  He all but screamed, unconsciously holding Draco tighter.  'And you made him relive it!'
'I have his potion.'  McGonagall told him, gesturing to the slight bulge in the pocket of her robe.  'You still want to sit with him?'
'Please, listen to me, Harry.'  It was Ron, Harry realised with a jolt.  Ron was the owner of the panicked voice that fogged up his head, the hand that continued to press fingertip bruises into the soft skin of his shoulder.  'If you do this, if you kill him, you will lose everything.'
Harry had no place in mind, all he knew was that he couldn't bear to be around anyone at the moment.
'It helps him sleep.'   A small smile flittered across Harry's face, not quite reaching his eyes.  'We finished Oliver Twist the other night.  He liked it.  We are half way through The Three Musketeers now.  He...he wanted me to read Dracula to him, but I wouldn't.  Another monster in the dark.  It might make things worse.'  A soft sigh, a blink of wet eyes.  'If that's even possible.'
His wand lay forgotten by his side, a reminder of the noise and the destruction Draco had heard in his distant dream.
'Neville...'  Harry's voice little more than a warning.  He was not to be crossed when it came to Draco.  Not now, not ever.
He had to make do with the heat from the hot water tap.  It was not as if he was going to sleep the night away, so frequent trips to the bathroom to begin the process again would come as a welcome distraction, and they would help with keeping him away from the sickening tug of sleep.
'No.'  Harry shook his head, his fingers itching by his sides.  'I couldn't face it.'  He admitted, his cheeks heating up.
'Are you sure you don't want Harry in here for this?'  She turned to him, apprehension in her worn features.   She was showing her age, Draco realised.  Her grey hair twisted up into a messy bun, held off her lined face with a tight black band.  The years were passing for them all.
'You were very good with Draco tonight.  I believe you would make an exceptional healer.'  She decided not to think about the words Harry had just spoken.
'Would it truly be so bad?'  Hermione contemplated.  'Harry and Malfoy.  If...  If that was what they wanted?'  She expected a biting reply from him, but what she received surprised her.
He should have stepped in.  He should have walked into that Potions cupboard and took the glass from Draco's trembling hand.  He should have sat down beside him, put his arm around his shoulders and begged him to cry.
But Harry had been pleased, and that was reason enough to be seated at the table.  Only space lay between them.  A few inches of air between their itching fingers.  Reaching for potatoes, Harry had done the unthinkable in front of everyone and brushed Draco's hand.  It was a fraction of a second, no one even noticed, the grin slight on Harry's lips.  A burning touch that had found Draco hiding his smile.
'It is my fervent wish that he will not.'  Professor McGonagall grimaced, feeling sick to her stomach.  'But in order for that to happen, we must continue.  Do you understand, Harry?'  At his barely imperceptible nod, she once again turned her attention to the beaten body of Draco.
'Later, Draco.  You'll thank me later, I promise.'  She settled him back against the soft bedding, fussed with the covers.
'He killed them.'  They heard him murmur, voice empty.  'Made me see.  Left them.  I...I couldn't reach, the chain wouldn't let me.  I only wanted to be close.'  He sobbed.  'Just one more time.'
'I am afraid it was for the majority of the night, Harry.'  Pomfrey told him with a heavy heart.  'He was still for most of the time.  It wasn't until the early hours that Hagrid noticed something was wrong.' She stopped to stand beside him, her arm around his shaking shoulders.  'I am so sorry.  I never would have put him through that had I known.'
'Hey, it's all right.'  Harry soothed, easing them both down to the bottom step.  'We can stay here a minute.'
'He...he's here every night.'  Draco was powerless to stop his gasping sobs.  'He doesn't sleep.  He stays with me, all...all night.  Tell me...tell me he's all right.  Please.'
'Yes.'  Harry nodded.  He wanted to sit, wanted to take up Draco's hands and lend him some warmth, some safety that had been taken from him yet again.  But he couldn't, the sting of what he had said to Neville heavy in his chest.
There was a darkness that surrounded him, a dry, dusty pall that clouded his shaky vision and clogged his throat.  He was so thirsty.
He wasn't all right, not this time, and Draco knew that he wouldn't be able to hide it.  Harry would be able to see the drying tears that ached to reappear, the shaking that never left.  And later he would ask.  They would be alone.  Harry would hold his hand, whisper that it was okay, that he was listening.
'Don't say anything to him.  Please.'  Draco sipped slowly at the liquid, quelling the urge to gulp.  'He has already done so much for me, I...I don't want him to know.'
'I can't.'  Draco told him, not meeting his green eyes.  It hurt to look into those eyes and see the pain reflected back.  Harry was huting too.
'Oh, all right.'  She sighed.  She was tired, she hadn't been sleeping.  Maybe the fight just wasn't worth it.  'I suppose he would let me.  And I guess I could do with something to eat.'  She allowed him to slip his hand into hers.  'Come on then.'
There was no sympathy, no feeling, as the boy was dropped unceremoniously, naked, shivering, dying, onto the cold hardened floor of the Forest.  The figure in black stalked away without a backwards glance.
'It's too late, Hermione.  I don't need, or want, your apologies.'  Harry began ripping out blades of grass that surrounded him.  He wanted to feel angry, he wanted to lash out, hurt her with words.  The way she had hurt him.  But all he felt was hollow.  What was the point in anger?  In causing her pain?  It wouldn't change anything.  Draco would still be gone.
'I'm sorry.'  Harry tried to speak, his throat thick with tears once more.  'I'm sorry.'  He stopped, pulled Draco close as he struggled to catch his breath, waited for the fog to lift.
And something else, something more, something that brought a gasp from the empty air surrounding him, the suffocating press of figures in the darkness.  A mewling, pathetic creature on the ground.  Curled up and weeping.  The thing on the stones had once been human, Draco could see that.  Somehow oddly familiar.
'You are safe.'  The voice repeated, the hand stroked.  'There isn't anyone going to hurt you anymore.  I'm going to look after you.'
Harry waited, listening carefully until the group had passed safely by their hiding place.  'Are you okay?'  He asked him softly, watching him.
It moved.  He could feel it slithering under his skin, when the dreams came, when he was alone.  It spoke to him, in his head.  Whispering black words, promises of pain, humiliation, words of rape, of curses.  Draco understood that there was to be no escape from the ownership lodged deep within his body.
He could leave this lovely room, with it's bright lamps and stacks of books.  He could step outside the castle, no one would see him, no one would pay attention.  He could head towards the Forbidden Forest, back to where it all began.
'No!  Draco...No.'  Harry was aghast at the idea.  'Please, Draco.  Sit down, please.'  His hands shaking, he slowly got Draco to the bed, sitting him on the edge.  Leaving him, stepping away.  'Is that what you think?  That I am only here because I want to make myself feel better about what I did to you, about how you almost died at the end of my wand?'  He turned away, scrubbing a rough hand over his face.  'I'm not good for you, Draco.  I'm no good at looking after you.'
The slight tap at the door made Draco start, overwhelmed by dark thoughts.  Whoever it was didn't wait for him to reply.
From the darkest red, to the palest pink, there didn't appear to be anywhere that had been hidden from the inhuman punishment that madman who had believed himself a lord had inflicted.
Draco would have to pass him if he wanted to get out of the crush, if he wanted to wash away the blood from his hand and get himself a drink.
'Malfoy is crying.'  Hagrid spoke, instantly stopping the small group in their tracks.  'I think he's scared of the raised voices.'
Filch, looking somewhat sorry and unsure.  He knew, Draco realised, the look in his eyes told him all he needed.  His stomach in knots at the thought.  He would have heard, the teachers would have talked amongst themselves about him over their morning coffee, it was only to be expected.  His shame open to them all, even the caretaker.
'I said that's enough.'  Harry spoke, carefully helping a trembling Draco to his feet.  'He's here now.  And it's about time you all got used to it.'  He didn't leave Draco's side, gently keeping his hand around Draco's cold fingers.  He could feel him shaking.  'Haven't you all had enough of the fighting?  Sometimes I wonder if we won the War at all.'
And photographs.  Tied together with a red ribbon, Draco had always cherished these few pictures.  Photographs of the three of them together, in the Manor, in the extensive gardens.  Moving, smiling, as happy as their life allowed.
Theo nodded, his jaw set, his eyes as cold as steel.  'It did.'  The niggling idea at the back of his mind had forced itself forward, refusing to be shut away.  There was still one thing left that he could do for his old friend.  'But there is something I can do.'
'A stupid apology won't ever be enough.  Nothing will ever be enough.'  Milly frowned.  'We will never be a friend to him again, and we don't deserve to be.'
It would feel light in his hand, easy to wield.  His fingers itched, flexed, almost reached out.  They would fit so very perfectly around that thin thread, made for his hand alone.
