Draco still didn’t meet Potter’s bright green eyes, afraid of what he would see. If only Draco could post-pone this conversation to the near date of never.
“No, no, Merlin. I didn’t mean it like that.” Draco put his hand out to stop her from climbing to her feet. He felt awful. “Just wait, please.”
“Then you’d both be no different than any other normally-functioning mated couple. Congratulations.” She clapped slowly and let out a pathetic ‘woo’ out loud into the quiet of the common room.
Draco scowled up at him, offended, clearly Severus had pinched a nerve. “I cracked open a boy’s head without touching him.”
Lavender Brown poked her head down the table, who’d clearly been eavesdropping. “Did you hear that he had some freak out in one of Professor Snape’s classes too? He’s crazy.”
Draco could only helplessly watch his kidnapping unfold, like he was experiencing an out-of-body lucid episode, as the werewolf’s enormous hands encased his arms and upper body before hoisting him up in the air. His heart skipped a few beats before he landed gracelessly on top of Fenrir’s broad shoulder, the exposed skin around his dirty tank top was so uncomfortably warm against the exposed skin on his belly where Draco’s half-tucked shirt rode up.
Maybe the Slytherins could make their own student council? Served by Slytherins for Slytherins only? Draco smirked at the idea. They could have club themed uniforms, with a stylish robe lapel pin - perhaps snakes in silver over Hogwarts? With gems. Lots of gems. There would be a secret password and they’d hold all their meetings in the prefects bath house -
He sighed, annoyed by the uselessness of people, and went hunting for the best seat on the train. With no one else around he had first pickings of anywhere he wanted. He opted for the very front compartment just before the engine room, his usual choice. The open layout with wide tabled booths and large glass windows overlooking the landscape was envy fuel, this was why the Slytherins had taken territorial ownership of it long before Draco first enrolled at Hogwarts.
“I understand,” Draco said again, his throat seized and the corners of his eyes stung with unshed tears, but his face refused to crack and reveal any emotion. He could do this.
“What a relief that’s over. I’m never going to agree to go on that death-machine again.” Draco said after him breathlessly, quickly patting down his wild, static-charged hair.
Draco let out a small growl in frustration deep in his throat, who it was truly directed to he had no idea. He shut his eyes for a moment, and once they blinked open, Harry was turned fully over to look at him with a raised brow and dotting eyes. Draco realised the extent of his reaction and he shook his head to clear it. “What is it Niffler, what do you want?”
She giggled instead of compensating him with a response, giving her two favourite boys a quick kiss on the crowns of their heads before she retired for the night.
“Draco, hi. You look nice,” she said quickly once she deemed him close enough, her voice loud enough for him to hear her while not quite yet crossing the remaining distance.
They were both sitting on top of a pair of desks, Draco with his legs crossed, and Lucia with her legs stuck out straight, feet bobbing occasionally. Once in the classroom they had spent the last thirty minutes chatting. In that time Draco had found out a lot more than he was expecting - he found out what got her in student council in the first place, which was originally on a dare with her sister last year, but she stayed for the passion she had for the work.
“Sirius? You there? Sirius?” Early morning daylight was creeping into the hall from the stairway windows. “Sirius?”
“Ouch!” He yelped. He looked around for his shoes or his broom but they had all disintegrated in the blast.
“Look boys! It’s famous Malfoy. What an honour - Randal Logey. Do y’know who the Logey’s are, Malfoy? Bet my family’s too small and common for you. Don’t seem like you care much about family now though, aye, Malfoy? Not anymore. Fucked Claudwell no problem, isn’t that right? Wanna bounce on my cock too? There’s plenty of
“I’m Lucia. Lucia Madley. Maybe you might know Laura? Sisters. I’m also classmates with Dennis Creevey.”
He shuddered at the thought of spending the rest of his two years being homeschooled by the Alpha Sirius and his house elf Kreacher.
! Oh my god,” Draco was swatting him with his hands, but Harry remained on his knee, smiling behind his sword.
Draco wished he could wail, but it would have been impossible to hear through the barrier of his helmet and the howling of wind. All the slender boy could do was make a futile attempt to squeeze the man with his thighs and arms until the ordeal was over, whenever that would be. He could handle a ride on a broom, but something about being so close to the ground, with the alien sounds of the muggle vehicles driving just as fast around them, and the unusual and unpredictable nature of which the motorbike moved had Draco fearing for his life.
“That’s a little traditional for our oh-so-progressive Headmaster. But that’s not too bad, didn’t you say Potter was good in bed?” Pansy smirked.
Draco’s Omega body had submitted in seconds. Potter’s snarling mouth was moving, but Draco couldn’t hear and he wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of reading his lips. He felt powerless, but he wasn’t going to let Potter know that.
“There’s nothing to do,” Lucia said, as if answering the question in his mind. “Harry is really kind and helpful, he’d be really good for you.”
He wondered if Potter was one of those nosey bastards out of bed, he wouldn’t be surprised. He probably knew it was Draco’s humiliating march (more like stumble) with the teachers up the stone steps with the use of his stalker’s map.
His blond head poked out from the crowd and he began to make his way to the front. He could do this, he dealt with Boggarts before. No wait, his house elves dealt with them. But he’d seen some before, the Manor was too well-maintained to have Boggarts most of the time. He’d read about them, and was part of Lupin’s practical lesson.
Draco felt his chest squeeze in an unusual way. He gave her a nudge will this elbow amicably. “Anytime, doll.”
“An insult like no other,” Draco half-said, too busy swiping his hair back into place to give it any serious bite.
“You’re absolutely mad, Harry. I don’t know why you’re still doing this to yourself. Why bother caring at all?” Ron elbowed him in the ribs sharply, his staring couldn’t have been that obvious, could it? Ron thankfully kept his voice low enough for just his and Hermione’s ears. She nodded to signal she was paying attention, but her eyes didn’t skip a beat scanning the lines of text in her book.
When Draco finally returned to Scotland, it was still early enough in the morning that the sun had only just completed its sequential rise. Being a Saturday, Hogwarts grounds were already bustling - there were students in their pyjamas on brooms playing a quick game of Quidditch, some were swimming in the lake or taking walks along the stone paths up on the hillside.
“…No.” Draco said, looking down. He then blinked up quickly. “It’s not that I don’t want to - I - you see I can’t -“
He tolerated the silent treatment, Draco couldn’t ignore the spiking in his blood pressure and the furious blush to his cheeks - there was no competing thing in the universe that pissed Draco Malfoy off more than not having someone’s full attention.
That same stubborn strand of blond hair swung into view again. Before the boy could reach up and sweep it away, Severus did it for him.
“I think it’s cute. Besides, petal, you won’t be short on finding anyone for the Halloween ball coming up.” Pansy was curling her hair with a finger, examining the pour of students make their way to their classes before the next bell rang. “I mean…That is if darling Potter doesn’t do it.”
The sound of a few dozen feathered wings being shaken and small clawed feet scampering over straw was his response.
Draco squeezed the plush toy tightly to his chest, its small head bulged as all its stuffing strained inside, the fragile seams looked eager to burst. “No…”
Draco felt the hand of Sirius on the small of his back, pushing him onto the train. It was once again very early in the morning, and platform 9¾ was completely empty.
The sun wasn’t out yet but a pale blue ray of twilight lined the horizon, promising its appearance in an hour, the stars were still glittering in by the thousands up in the ink black sky directly above them.
Draco looked up at it, it glowed almost translucent in the moonlight, and this close Draco could see what were supposed to be veins curling up around its girth,
Draco stumbled blindly around the Sixth Year boys bedroom, even the underwater glow of the lake wasn’t enough for him to find his wand and slippers. It took him longer than he wanted when he finally palmed the correct spot of his bedside table, he lit a dimmed Lumos to illuminate where his slippers were.
“You heard me. I was told Friday’s only for this pointless punishment.” Draco crossed his arms and jut a hip out.
The moment Draco felt the eyes off his back as he turned the corner he broke into a run, he sprinted so fast down the steps to the second floor he nearly slid and fell at the landing. His heart was racing, he could hear it in his ears and the beats kept pace with his footfalls. It drummed so rapidly it almost hurt and by the time he’d made it inside his room he was gripping it against his chest. His fingers clawed into his black robes, trying to hold and cage his heart in place before it made any attempt to leap into his throat and escape out his wide, gasping mouth. No air was passing through his lips, he realised.
He stopped right in from of her and she looked up in time as she pushed the door open. She opened her mouth in shock but recovered quickly enough.
As soon as they approached the platform, Niffler gently pushed the floating suitcase towards the luggage compartment at the far end of the train, then offering Draco space to climb up the step that lead into one of the corridors.
, Draco. I’d ask you.” Harry said his words very carefully, tone as hard and unyielding as concrete.
The silver colour seemed to endlessly sparkle, placed underneath the candle lit ceiling of the classroom.
Being the organisers, the student council didn’t have the luxury to arrive fashionably late to the Halloween ball, instead they were expected to be hours early in costume, overseeing final plans and assuring things turned out as arranged.
Draco threw the toy at her, its furry abdomen met her face and landed unceremoniously in front of her.
“That’s exactly 100 copies,” informed Luna, instead of a hello. Beside her feet stood a similar stack, possibly another 100 Quibbler copies. Luna wasn’t asking for any money from these, despite all the hard work she put into them, she seemed excited enough just by getting the story out there.
“Here again by yourself?” Draco said curiously, but he must have sounded mean because she looked a little shocked and stared down at her lunch awkwardly. “Sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.” He reassured her.
Last year Draco had been a headless horseman, fiery neck-stump and all, this year he wasn’t so sure. He didn’t care anymore.
Then he did the one thing he could finally do: curl into a ball. He sobbed into his knees, hiding his face in his arms. It was the only thing he could do that wouldn’t make things worse.
Then he heard Pansy scream somewhere in the crowd, he could see her swaying back and forth on Blaise’s shoulders. What she was saying was completely unintelligible - but, whatever the hell she was saying, she was saying it with
Draco couldn’t wipe away the first tears fast enough, and soon several others escaped through his rapidly swiping finger long enough for Harry to notice.
It was now Friday. The days progressed by easily enough for Draco with any incidents. He knew he was martyred, but he wasn’t exactly bullied either. His house made sure he wasn’t, even though Draco was perfectly fine at holding up on his own. Their help was nice but it really wasn't necessary most of the time. Most people weren’t exactly witty enough to last long as the opposition in a game of insults against Draco, and lest everyone forget that he was one of the most magically gifted students in Hogwarts. He was fine. He shook off the doubt about himself and continued his trek up the stone stairs that led from the dungeons.
“They will be.” Harry said urgently, he pressed himself closer to Draco. The smell of arousal was new and already overwhelming, clinging to the back of Draco’s throat. He forced away the thought to check and see if Harry’s cock had grown hard in his corduroy trousers, he shouldn’t want to know. He forced himself to tuned in to the rest of what the boy was saying. “-And you’ll be too. You’ll get hurt if we don’t…”
“Pansy stop thinking with your genitals for a second. Merlin.” His hands came up to scrub at his face roughly. “This is actually serious.”
His glare, lack of costume, and overall demeanour said the man wished he was anywhere else but here, and it warned students to stay the hell away if they knew what was good for them.
He put a hand on his thigh, fingers tracing lines into the cotton, they were comfortable and a classic cut, but they weren’t very striking or note-worthy. After a quick re-visit into his visual memory, he waved his wand over them and the colour rippled from grey to blue, the fabric became more textured and turned into faded denim, the size shrunk a little bit and felt more fitted around the crotch and thighs.
Severus took, impossibly, another step. He was too close now, by this point he could taste the proximity: a mouth-watering honey.
He flicked his denim jacket open, and was pleased to notice the young man’s eyes look down to appraise the low neckline of his grey cotton shirt.
Professor Snape had once again ordered Draco to come see him after dinner, this time to work on improving the boy’s mindfulness. Snape had explained that fine-tuning his control over his emotional mind with meditating and self-reflective thinking was their next step. Apparently meditation was already an important aspect of Legemency, so, along with the extraordinary training Draco would receive to control his magic, they would also be sitting together in silence for hours. Draco seriously couldn’t think of anything worse.
It’s not like he hadn’t juggled with the possibility with peeking a head in, but he had orders to follow. He settled back down, wiping the crusting saliva from the corner of his lip, and listened carefully to the activity in the bedroom.
also also my favourite thing about harry potter is the magic so if i get to talk about magic u damn well are going to see me talk about it whenever i can lmao!!!
Potter grumbled something out unintelligible, still in a mood, but pulled out a small stack of folded notes. “Here.” He grunted. “Notes from Romilda. She wants help with interactive decorations for the band she’s sorted out. These are her notes. I’ve already added my own so just don’t forget them on Friday.”
He had to have faith in his abilities, not feed off the memories his mind constantly conjured up to torment him.
Kreacher was already sent away from the house, hiding out at Hogwarts. Sirius also had his wand nearby in case he needed to sedate the boy as a last resort. So long as Draco felt safe and, more importantly, alone, it would not be a problem…If Draco was placated, his magic was statistically less likely to be a threat to himself or to others. As believed, it was often when Omegas felt stressed or in a compromised situation did they resort to use of their magic, but it seemed Draco was unpredictable.
Draco wanted to say more, but was interrupted by the sudden horn of the train, going off deafeningly around them, He felt the push from Niffler urging him into the train. Sirius’ face was distorted by the glass door slamming shut. Draco rushed forward to the door and attempted to open it, wanting to say a proper goodbye, but it wouldn’t budge. He looked through the window at Sirius who now took a few steps back, still smiling. He had combined it with a little friendly wave.
“Can I ask what really happened?” Potter finally said, he was gazing down at Draco with his bright green eyes.
He didn’t get the chance to herd everyone into a different direction because Pike deviated and made his approach, yanking her glasses right off her face.
Draco sputtered and his face flushed red in the pale-green light. “Merlin have people always wanted to talk about my sex life like this or is this just a new thing I somehow missed?”
“Is this freedom? Right now?” Sirius said, hand now on the door, caressing the old chipping paint with his thumb. “Do you honestly feel free in the room, alone?”
She blended easily enough into the crowds, despite her striking pattern, as they were absorbed into the crowd of eager students who were still arriving in drones, all dressed or glimmered into their own costumes. The liberal access to magic made imaginations churn out very wayward results. Some students paused as they came in - taking the time to chat with the ghosts or to admire the decorations and dancing shadows swirling around the entrance - giving Draco a moment to see a number of small and giant monsters, creatures with elongated limbs or no appendages at all, or bright coloured skin and hair.
He slammed his book locker shut after collecting his cursed artefacts homework, beside him were Blaise and Pansy, leaning their shoulders against an adjacent locker, looking just as rough as he felt.
He ignored the high-pitched cries and pleads of the dead-girl as he pushed open the door into the abandoned hallway -
He toed a piece of hay aside with his shoe. “I don’t keep a diary for it or anything.” He huffed a laugh to himself.
Potter’s face was lighting up with realisation, finding this funny - like it was some kind of inside joke - and broke into a smile. “Where’d you learn that - “
He walked up and pulled out his wand in one fluid motion, tip pointed down in a polite manner as he stood in front of Severus.
The tray was thrusted into Draco’s hands and Sirius closed the door before taking his seat back on the stool.
“Oh, Harry Potter!” A Ravenclaw girl sitting on a desk gasped, she jumped off and brushed her grey pleated skirt down. “Head Master said you’d be joining us, we weren’t so sure what time - I was a little shy to ask. So nice to meet you.” She rushed up to him. She seemed younger than them, maybe by a year or two. Her hair was like spun gold and tied back in a loose ponytail. She had a light dusting of freckles around the centre of her face, it acted like a spider’s web, ensaring you to gaze fixedly on a pair of deep blue eyes. She seemed very naturally pretty.
“Could do,” Harry smirked, now looking up at the ceiling to admire the level of intricacy Draco put towards the design, Draco always seemed eager to put a considerable amount of attention to something. He recalled the magically elaborate
He was going to need to bond to Harry, done properly on the day of his heat. No half-measures, no half-bonds, no exceptions.
“That’s no fun… Maybe our costumes could match?” He was flirting. Draco couldn’t help but blink mutely for a second - Harry Potter, destroyer of the Dark Lord,
a port-key that looked like an iron just in arms reach. It was there in case the situation turned deadly.
Harry stepped in close enough until the air he was breathing out through his nose was rustling the bangs across Draco’s forehead.
She rolled he eyes. “Yes, and then what? Are you capable of talking to him? Could you see yourself doing that once a day?”
“No one’s giving me enough time!” Draco shouted. “I managed not to explode before, no one’s giving me the chance to prove that it can be fine again!”
His mouth went dry and each time he swallowed felt like he was aggravating dozens of little micro cuts lining the inside of his throat.
The bedroom door opened as soon as he approached it and Sirius had to hold his breath, afraid of how his own body could react to the fresh heat pheromones contained inside.
Oliver snatched at one of his forearms and forced it upwards, as Draco began to shout another hand had come and covered his mouth. Without his wand he couldn’t do a thing, with that thought settling in Draco’s whole body began to shake. New tears were welling up and running across Oliver’s hand. “I should be your mate,” Oliver said like it was law. “You need someone who can protect you. Let me do that. I want to be your Alpha. I can be a good Alpha. Your true Alpha - ” Draco bit him, a humble attempt at resistance. Oliver snarled and cast a quick binding charm that forced Draco to seal his own mouth closed with his two hands. He was then pushed to the ground, on his back with his hands remained glued to his face, as if he was trying to keep a secret. Oliver didn’t waste any time trying to yank Draco’s uniform trousers past his thighs. Draco was going to be sick.
Slowly, the shadows expanded until it morphed into a cloud black smoke in the air, and three witches jumped out of it.
“I’m afraid not this time, decisions will be made that involve Harry. Professor McGonagall is here in his interest as Professor Snape is in yours.”
“All of this, Harry. All of it. All the bullshit. You wanting to take Malfoy to the dance, you running off and disappearing on Sunday instead of coming with us for lunch at Hagrid’s, what else? You fucking the little cunt! We were this close to having him gone and out of our lives and you fuck him - ” Ron snapped and then skidded to a halt, he looked as if the memories were causing him to short circuit. His red hair matched his face and his hands, which he was digging the heels of into his eyes. It looked almost like he was on the verge of gouging his eyes out from the frustration. “You can’t possibly like him. Getting it out of your system was one thing, but he’s gotten into your head. I mean - for crying out loud - you were already obsessed since First Year, but ever since Malfoy presented you’ve been
“The first time I was desperate, lonely, and I wanted to leave that house by any means necessary. I wouldn’t use it as your argument’s saving grace.” Draco’s eyes narrowed to slits.
“Hope a teacher doesn’t catch you.” But it was more of an admission of defeat, rather than a rebuttal.
It nodded so hard it’s large radar ears flapped against its wrinkled head, clearly delighted by the acknowledgement from the great Wizard himself. It’s shiny black eyes then finally rotated between the two of them, addressing Draco as well. “Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy, sirs, Headmaster would like to see the two of you before you leave for your dorms.”
Maybe it was the proximity of being around an unbonded Alpha for so long, but a ache in Draco’s neck was now slowly making itself present and as he reached up to curl his fingers over the tender flesh, he couldn’t help the started flinch and a hiss in distress. This was happening too fast for Draco to respond properly, he staggered back, desperate for some space. If only he could escape the prison of his fiery hot skin.
A lone wolf cries out in the distance, the sound of it seems to be coming closer as each second passes. Draco attempts to run, but the trees give up no clearing, they were planted so close together that even his hand couldn’t slip through, he was trapped.
“Woah… What’s this about?” Potter’s face was flushed red and his eyes look brighter despite the low-lit classroom.
Sirius couldn’t help the laugh escaping him at the absurdity of the thought, and decided to ask the question for the hell of it.
hiiiii! sorry for the long wait and i know i promised hogwarts this chapter but i realised i needed to tie off a few loose ends first before i did so i had to write this first - trying my best to make the dynamics make sense but it leads to me over explaining a lot sometimes!!!
Sirius staggered to his feet at that, ear to the door. His eyes wildly darted around the dark hallway, his eyes - having adjusted to it long ago - instinctually looked out for trespassers and potential rivals.
to anyone that would listen. The Omega wondered where the Alpha of the house was, he gravely needed somebody - even his body tingled approvingly at the mere thought of the man, and he could feel his internal muscles flex with need at what someone like Sirius could offer. It wasn’t the first time he’d tempted these thoughts, and now here Draco was again.
“I lost control of my magic. Just exploded. Nothing really happened and Dumbledore’s working on teaching me how to control it.”
But then she suddenly slapped him hard across the ear and cheek - he didn’t realise he was actually supposed to answer.
anyway the ball is rolling!!! i reckon this story will complete in 5 more chapters :^) let me know which has been your absolute fav chapter so far, would love to know <3
“No, god, no.” Sirius was still settling down, occasionally chuckling. “C’mere.” He started to gesture him over. “C’mere a sec.”
“I thought I’d try something different. It’s what’s in with Muggles, right?” He stared at the man challengingly.
“I know why Dumbledore’s putting so much effort into this. I’m dangerous. He’s also made me realise enough times that it would serve me best to have him and yourself as an ally. I need my family back.” He missed his mother, his father. He stepped closer to the other boy, who stiffened when Draco lay his hands against Harry’s chest. The soft wool jumper he wore bore an ‘H’ stitched across his chest and stomach.
“Oh, is it your magic?” She blinked up, smiling knowingly. “That was a little freaky last Tuesday night. You’re very powerful.”
But the gloom in his expression cleared away fairly quickly, now displaying the second of Draco’s least favourite Potter expressions next to disappointment: suspicion.
Multiple Alphas have staked their claim on you and now you are a cocktail of ensnared magical energies.” His voice dropped lower. “Like you’re swollen from it, ready to burst at the seams.”
Things were still being handled by Draco relatively well, but he was not one to count his winnings too soon. He liked to gloat but he wasn’t stupid. His first class of the morning was none other than Defence against the Dark Arts. This time fortunately with the Ravenclaw Sixth Years.
“Well, yeah?” Harry said casually, like it wasn’t a big deal, which it wasn’t. He wanted to make sure the blond saw through that extra ordeal with Snape relatively well enough, it was hard to explain but seeing Draco’s suffering created a sense of solidarity and unity in Harry. Draco seemed more relatable, like he could actually be a friend. Like it wasn’t so crazy what Harry wanted to ask him…
“Not really, Luc.” Harry said, looking around the room, there was a tense strain in his jaw. Draco followed his line of sight to see he was looking at nothing in particular, and then they were then introduced to another Ravenclaw Beta girl called Eleanor, a Hufflepuff Beta boy called Augustus, and a Gryffindor Fourth Year Alpha Harry seemed to recognise.
“Maybe he has gotten into my head,” Harry said, sounding sarcastic, he was already exhausted with this conversation. “Maybe his smell has rot my brain to goo and I’ve stopped thinking like the
Sirius also had to admit to himself that in spite of his meek, unassuming appearance, the Omega was ferociously strong. Sirius was no stranger to the smell of fear and pain, the sounds of it, the night of Draco’s heat ensured there was never shortage of either. Besides the one slip up when Draco cried out for Sirius, sometime in middle of the night, he’d recovered from it quickly enough and handled the rest of the situation on his own. It must have been painful, a never-ending hell, his mind likely in a constant war waged against itself. The more Sirius realised just how much Draco was willing to put up with out of pride, the more his fondness grew.
“How come?” She leant in close, big brown eyes wide and curious. “Don’t you feel it inside you? That need for an Alpha?”
“I just wanna start by saying I’m not trying to start a fight.” He was laughing as he said it, but when he realised Draco wasn’t going to laugh along with him he stopped. “I’m going to be honest, I’ve spoken to Dumbledore, he’s said—“
Since she stuck her nose where it didn’t belong, since she interfered and condemned him from Hogwarts to spend the week of his impending heat with Sirius in Grimmauld Place. He had to blink away the memories of fucking himself half-conscious on a bludger-sized toy cock, and now, feeling embarrassed, he looked over her again with fresh criticism. She was dressed as some sort of obscure mythical animal he didn’t know the name of - a Chimera, maybe? - it looked like an ugly combination of animal appendages and heads, all lifelessly dangling off her small shoulders in a gruesome way that was customarily perfect for Halloween, and to her word she was coloured in an obnoxiously bright
He tugged at the royal mantle attached to his shoulders until he heard the popping of undone stitching. With the mantle tossed aside, he got to work loosening his costume’s cravat, but not quite pulling it off yet. He scrubbed at his eyes, attempting to rub away the tell-tale sting.
He shut his eyes and concentrated. He thought about the feeling of it oozing out of his skin, the weight of the magic in his hands. The memories he called to mind blinked one by one
“Draco’s only going to come to you when he’s ready. If you so much as disturb a perfect little blond hair on his head, then my friend you better watch your back.” Then those dark-toned lips stretched into a false pleasant smile. “It was nice meeting you…Boy-Who-Lived.” He held out a hand to Harry.
The two boys could only share a heated glance at each other, both their mouths twisted into an uneasy frown.
“Hey…” He cleared his throat of phlegm and rubbed the crusts of sleep out of his eyes. His back ached something fierce and he popped a particularly stubborn creak in his neck, “How’s it ‘goin?”
Draco nodded and kept his eyes now on the grey cabinet. It shook a little as if it felt all the eyes in the room.
“You speak to all your kings like that?” Draco parried, suddenly worried that his banter was said too harshly, too sarcastically, but Harry only barked out a laugh in response, then slowly dipped down low onto one knee. He drew out his silver sword and leant his unbalanced weight against it point-down, like a knight vowing a pledge. Draco looked around, embarrassment creeping up on him. People were watching them, some looked confused, some looked delighted, some looked
broad jawed mug was still as handsome, even his short-trimmed stubble was sheared in the same angles. His usual golden skin was cast in a red light as his image projected from the flames of the Floo. Draco and Dumbledore were leaning in slightly with bent knees, close enough to feel the heat of the fire tingle their skin. Lucia had been sent away back to Ravenclaw house only ten minutes ago.
The Hogwarts grounds were alive with night-time activity, insects chirped and rodents rustled amongst the dying autumn leaves. Summer was finally releasing its hold, taking with it its warm nights and sweet smells.
Unaffected by the venom in Snape’s tone, the stone gargoyle sprang aside, and they both climbed up to the Headmaster’s tower. Draco could smell the crowd of people before he could see them, Potter, the Headmaster, and Professor McGonagall.
“Mr. Malfoy!” Cried McGonagall, wand to her throat. The Sonorus charm boomed her call to him and he tentatively lifted a hand to say he was alive.
Draco picked out an exposed thread from the toy regathered in his arms, then observed it. He used the time spent looking at the curly bright pink strand to come up with the best explanation.
Her joints ached from a combination of exhaustion and stress over the worrisome rumours of betrayal amongst their ranks surrounding the Malfoy's. But she wouldn’t get the chance to sleep just yet, even after the confirming nod that their security wards were in place from a Death Eater named Rosier, her Master Voldemort wasn’t ready to call it a night. She saw Rodolphus enter the hallway she was in, and he made a gesture for her to follow him down the corridor into the luxuriously decorated, candle lit master study.
“Tense situation,” the Alpha girl joked uncomfortably, and fell into the chair with a flop. “On Friday you and Malfoy were talking about what charms to use for the Great Hall. I wanted to ask if you wanted to collab with Augustus and I? We finally got the Hex Girls to agree to the opening gig and I wanted to do something with bats transporting them in and out but we don’t know anything complicated enough.”
The bell for lunch announced. The worry swimming in his thoughts was upsetting his appetite, making it hard to think about anything related to food. All Draco was
As soon as Draco felt the sudden whoosh of the Elf Disapparating the two of them from the ground floor to the first, he instantly recognised being in his own room. He could tell it was his room just from the smell of it, nothing had changed, and it seemed like Sirius hadn’t washed a single thing
In the centre of the room, Draco lay in his bead, his breathing quiet. It wasn’t too late into the evening that everyone needed to sleep yet, the rest of the boys were still up playing Wizard’s chess in the common room. Blaise waited for a second to see if Draco would notice him, but with his pheromone suppressants, it seemed like the Alpha was an invisible man to the Omega’s mental eye. Slowly, he walked forward and reached the side of the bed, pressing the fronts of his thighs into the emerald mattress enough to rile the blond into cracking an eye open.
Sirius shrugged. “Where else would you go? Besides, I’m assuming you’re going to try to - y’know - not blow up?”
The night was cold, and, even after changing into his warmer set of night clothes at some point, nothing made a difference to Draco. His body shivered uncontrollably, and the visible skin across his body was lit up by the shine of sweat, only making him colder, it came following the never-ending waves of pain, starting at his inflamed neck. He couldn’t ignore it and time only seemed to make it worse. The symptoms came to him faster than they did the last time, the first time, and a sudden fearful thought crossed Draco’s weary mind: what if the build-up to each heat became briefer and briefer, until he eventually dropped to the floor, incapable of action, until his grotesque biological deed was done? His first heat had taken nearly a week to happen, now he felt like he was on the brink of it, and it hadn’t even been one day yet.
Draco Malfoy was alone, as requested. Sirius sneered to himself. The stubborn fool would have to resort to waiting this heat out, using a combination of toys and patience to satisfy
Sirius came back after some time, having to deal with preparing the food on his own while Kreacher was still gone. He also used the opportunity to detour back to his own room to slip into a fresh set of clothes, hiding any evidence of the pre-cum stained pyjama bottoms.
“The one scheduled for four-thirty this morning, sir. Niffler will ready your things. But please wake up.”
only been Potter, Romilda, Augustus, and Draco left working on spells together to fuse concepts from their perspective roles. Lucia was the first to go, which was unusual for her, and Eleanor left shortly after.
A slender, translucent hand lifted high enough to indicate that Bellatrix’s turn to speak was over, and she kicked herself internally for not successfully convincing the Dark Wizard of her idea.
I also have a few drawings in my files coz i find drawing the scenes helps me picture the right descriptions blah blah
Dumbledore rubbed his eyes underneath his glasses, the contented tone in his aged voice quickly withered into something now on the cusp of complete collapse. As he spoke he slowly made his way back to his own chair. “We are, Harry. Of course. But things have become…Compromised.”
“Harry...” Draco attempted again, the name dragged its way out of his clenched, aching throat. The corners of his eyes stung to the point he had to blink rapidly in some vain attempt to distract himself from the pain.
The man took every opportunity to blatantly mock and snap out a mean remark. If it looked like Draco was distracted and lost in thought, he’d magic his class-books to the floor, ordering the boy to pick it up. Snape would ask him the harder questions that took him longer than a second to answer -
Her hair was completely undone, falling in unkept curls over her face. The bright, sun kissed colour from her youth had long since faded, and what little colour left could only faintly reflect back at her in the morning window light. She hated herself, hated how far she’d fallen. She was nauseous with self-consciousness.
Her smile looked pinched, but she moved on anyway, and pointed towards the extended floating table and the vast amount of available food.
ALSO please don't be afraid to say that draco and the gang are straight up BULLIES!!! because they are. they're little shits in the books. that's why i loved them. i was hoping they would get the character development they so sorely deserved but nope... guess it's my job!
Draco still couldn’t say a thing, and was grateful that the man returned the hug for a few blissful seconds.
It bowed a little less dramatically that time, then, while still slumped forward, Disapparated out of existence. The crack sounded like an imagined whip on Draco’s back.
Harry looked like he was going to argue that, but instead he shook his head in no, either to Draco or to himself. The boy was growing redder by the second, and the once faint Alpha scent quickly swelled and intensified, being carried by the expanding stink of nervous sweat. Draco admitted he’d heard rumours that the great Golden Boy himself was painfully awkward when it came to girls he fancied, but this was something else. He seemed nervous, but also furious, those scarred hands were shaking into balled fists.
“Oh Merlin, how did you know what to do!” He barked, he gestured to the side of his blushing neck. Harry stared at it for a few seconds until he understood, but he might have stared a second longer than he should have because Draco was now covering it with a hand and glowering off to the side in embarrassment. “Ooh… Funny thing about that. I didn’t know it would work. It was in that thing that Luna wrote. The Gibbler?”
“My heats are dangerous, Pans. Dumbledore preferred that I spend them out of school and away from the students, it was my only other option aside from officially being handed off to Harry - er - Potter.”
Blaise was sitting on the sofa with her on her other side, already under the covers too. The solemn young man had never looked so relaxed in his life.
Three hours could easily be classified as torture, the seemingly peaceful trip seconding as solitary confinement. Draco spent his time playing around with spells and tricks using his wand. He transfigured a coaster on the table into a mouse, then a small tree, and then a glass bottle with a miniature ship inside. Once he was bored from that he turned to look out the window to count how many things he could see pass by, he categorised them by colour, then by the letter they started with, then with the letters they ended with, then with things that rhymed with other things - he stopped and noticed his reflection now watching himself back In the window, his face was resting on his hand and he still had his wand in the other. He raised his wand and pointed it towards his head - “Decoro,” he said - his hair swished the opposite way. “Decero,” he said again, it flipped back. He spelled at it again, the blond waves straightened out and slicked back. He spelled it a couple more times, selecting through the styles, before he decided on a soft wavy fringe swept to the left.
The motorbike growled with a ferocity unlike anything Draco had ever felt before, it vibrated through the fabric of his jeans and shook his thighs so quickly the lines of the stitching blurred. The magically powered vehicle was a glossy black, paired with matching black leather handles and seats, it moved faster than any broom ever could. Draco desperately clung to Sirius who was zipping down crowded muggle roads, which were wide, black, and made of concrete - the speed in which they moved made it difficult to tell what the painted symbols along them meant. In fact, Draco couldn’t make out any physical characteristics of anything that passed them by, everywhere around him was nothing more than streaks of colour.
- the pain in his neck ebbed away, then disappeared entirely. It was a simple pleasure, but he couldn’t help but revel in the familiarity. His Omega nature craved for a place that was ‘his’, a safe place; so Draco gave in, going limp and boneless, now relaxed and settled into the soft pillows of his bed.
Draco let his head fall against the cold floor, allowing himself to feel drained and limp as his transfiguration professor undid the bond keeping his hands glued to his face.
“Yes, sir.” He lied, he had no clue when exactly it would be. He’d only just suffered through his second heat, so enough information was hard to come by. Was his third going to be the most painful? Was it going to happen so quickly and suddenly that he would have no time or preparation to protect himself or others? So far his magic hadn’t made an appearance during both heats, but the chance of it doing so while Draco was in a state of zero personal control was a frightening thought - it would undoubtedly lead to deadly consequences. Dumbledore was willing to risk muggles in London and Sirius twice now, but it didn’t seem like he was willing to offer Draco the courtesy a third time. “I think sometime before Christmas.”
“Oh, hi. Yeah.” Harry shook her outstretched hand and paused a little for a second, surprised. His mouth hung open before he blinked back to reality and let go of her hand. He stood back and pushed Draco forward by the small of his back. “Have you met Mal - Draco?”
Seeing as there wasn’t going to be the usual dinner, student were expected to take part in the food available throughout the ball - Lucia and Eleanor had been the ones to direct the house elves’ food prep for it, scheduling the menu and even going so far as to volunteer work in the kitchens themselves sometimes. There were so many options that there was at least one dish starting with every letter of the alphabet. There was even eyeball punch, with eyes that blinked (which was bound to be spiked at some point - if not already).
They continued on down the hall in silence for a little bit longer, Draco walking with his hands clasped behind his back, Harry with his hands stuck inside the pockets of his robes.
“Fuuuck you,” Draco found himself gurgling, it didn’t sound like his voice. “You punch like you have…No hands. Cock-scar.”
The older man narrowed his eyes, his lip curling tightly with displeasure. He didn’t like being interrogated.
“I’m telling you to stop, so do it. Stop right now.” Harry ordered again, slipping easily into his authoritative role. The words came from him viciously, as though he commanded the room, like he believed he had all the control. Draco was no king, he was. His heart ached with shame.
Bellatrix Lestrange was captured, but severely injured. While Rodulphus Lestrange was killed by McGonagal, who reflected his killing curse back at him. Several other Death Eaters lay littered in black heaps, stunned or dead. Some had escaped, but the real numbers were still unknown.
He was hoping he would not have had to come back, but Draco was sadly realising life as an Omega meant your expectations were often ripped from you, and you were left to spiral in the decisions of others who they themselves have decided symbolic ownership of you.
He, along with Pansy and Blaise, made the journey up to the ground floor. He looked down at himself as soon as he reached the final step out of the dungeons, reaching a hand up to stroke the front of his doublet, decorated with detailed embroidery and jewels sewn along the seams. His hand traveled up until it reached his throat, the collar of his doublet high enough to cut close against the edge of his jaw, then to he corrected the fastener of his black royal mantle, which would have traditionally been made of dragon or unicorn hide, then he moved on to his ears, the lobes were weighed down slightly with heavy jewelled earrings, and finally to his hair, which curled up with a flick from the impression of the sharp, wicked-looking silver crown on top of his head. He was the very historically significant, and deadly, Wizard king of the 15th Century, Lord Dominus. Only Blaise got it (which was more than a little disappointing), who went as a vampire for the third year in a row. Pansy had gone in something more risqué, her costume was furry and skin-tight, tan, and covered in
what I know Dumbledore would have already figured out. Although, tell me, what was is it like? This ancient so-called Omegan power.” He made a swishy gesture with his fingers, giving his words a sarcastic flair.
If you had asked the question a week ago, the answer may have possibly still been the same. But now, looking up at the crestfallen boy before him, his real answer would be riddled with complicated and non-committed excuses.
Harry nodded. Draco was already considering enchanting shadow animals to run across the floor and to fly around the walls and ceiling -
Draco didn’t need to look at Potter to know he froze where he stood, possibly with a goofy look of abject betrayal etched all over his face.
Blaise’s black cropped curls met his pillow with a soft thump, Draco could make out his eyes shutting closed again. “Oh… Be sent away quietly.”
“I thought about how much I’ve been hurting…” It was now more like a truth serum. “I’ve just been so confused. And angry. And…” He couldn’t stop the watering in his eyes, and his hands couldn’t reach his tear line fast enough before the first couple of drops slipped over his cheeks. “I haven’t been happy in weeks. Everything keeps getting worse and now I find out I’m some bloody atomic bomb!”
Only when the sound of the door shut did Draco look back down at the table, he left one. The enormous purple monstrosity.
“I...I...” Draco attempted to speak, but shut his mouth after he fully understood the consequences. He couldn’t afford to speak in case he said something that would make him lose control, he couldn’t afford to lose control, because it would mean he would lose everything.
“Oh… Nothing special.” Draco said, eyes remaining up, using his wand to reshape a particular web hanging in the ceiling corner.
Snape slapped at his teacher’s desk with his hand, the sound was so loud every student had snapped their head up to attention.
“I can’t really explain how… But I lost control of my magic, without a wand or a spell in mind, it just came out of me.”
just wanted to get this out of the way so i could start writing for that good old heat we all know and wnat
At least it wasn’t as cold as he remembered, possibly because it was in the middle of the afternoon, even if it was only the end of summer. Draco had to fight the urge to raise a hand to cover his nose, as the warm air intensified the smell, and instead distracted himself by calling out for the other Omega.
Dumbledore glanced towards Professor Snape, who remained cast in shadow in the back of the room, who made neither a confirming or denying gesture. Seeming satisfied, the Headmaster returned his grave expression too Draco. “Then you understand what you must do?”
He looked her over with cool consideration once he stopped in front of her. “I haven’t forgiven you for what you did,” he prefaced, “but I don’t believe we can’t be civil.” Without smiling, he went on. “And thank you. So do you, interesting choice.”
Niffler left him at the mouth of the bridge after seeming assured that the Omega wasn’t going to hysterically run off somewhere or throw himself into the lake to drown in some depressed fit. Draco rolled his eyes until they landed on the spot where the small creature once stood - he couldn’t help but feel a little offended, Dumbledore didn’t have an ounce of respect enough to trust that Draco wouldn’t be so weak as to do something like
Draco would know better than anyone that there was always a price payed for Dumbledore’s protection and wisdom.
“Students,” the man droned, he was at the centre of their amphitheatre shaped classroom. His hands were clasped primly behind his back and he stood beside a large grey book cabinet. “We have acquired something rather interesting today. I’m sure all of you, as N.E.W.T level students, have at least heard of this creature before.”
Luna was in the year below him, so they didn’t share any classes together. They didn’t have any mutual friends, as far as Draco knew she didn’t have any friends at all. Even her own house couldn’t stand her. This would have been so much easier if she was just a little more normal, but life for Draco didn’t seem to work that way anymore, nothing could just be ‘easier’.
Blaise gave a frustrated sniff and stood away from the bed. He ran out of time, the rest of the boys would start to wonder where he’d gone.
Harry looked up and gave her a crooked smile, he then shot Ron a look that said he wanted him to leave. Ron did, albeit complaining and with an indignant puff of air from his chest. “Don’t mind him” Harry said loudly, as if trying to speak over Ron’s grumbling, while offering the now vacant chair in front of him. The fire nearby crackled in the moments of quiet and the heat that radiated on Harry’s shins would become more noticeable.
also YES before you ask draco does have a pusspuss. he has both. I tried to explain it throughout the story that it was there while not being so obvious about it lol >w>
Eventually the pain stopped, and the pants of blood-scented breaths heaving from her torn throat slowly ebbed away. She could taste blood in her mouth, coating her gums and teeth, unsure of where it came from - her lungs? Cracked teeth? She couldn’t tell if she still had an intact tongue.
“I only ask because it seems to have been helpful,” she looked back-and-forth between the two of them.
They briefly tested their instruments, giving the teenage audience plenty of time to admire their skin tight dresses,
Draco already had so much to worry about, the last thing he wanted to deal with was the Halloween ball. His heat was coming in three weeks, his Head of House hated his guts, his Alpha was an oaf, and he had to worry about the impending day his Dark Lord sent his evil hoard to Hogwarts to kill and enslave everyone.
Finally convincing himself that staring at Potter’s table for too long was looking weird, Draco shook his head and turned away.
“Yeah I don’t talk about it much,” she said, chewing on a lump of Drooble’s blowing gum - once in a while blowing up bright-pink, watermelon sized bubbles. She had wavy brown hair with mascara’d eyes that could possibly rival Pansy’s.
It had been three more days since Draco’s accident. The windows replaced and the area destroyed was perfectly resurrected with the help of Professor Sprout’s specialised biota magic. Dumbledore hadn’t spoken to him since then, only promising to get back to him with a plan, all that he asked of Draco was he keep out of trouble. Easier said than done, but he so far was doing alright. Snape had been treating him civilly, but it wasn’t perfect - he couldn’t seem to help the little jabs still or saving all the harder questions for Draco rather than usual students he didn’t like that day.
he could hold on to grudges like they’d buy him his retirement someday, and hostile to the point he could insult you to tears, but he was also the most clever living Wizard Draco knew. The Alpha had a magical talent and was absolutely ruthless with a wand, easily disarming Draco in seconds if he wasn’t careful. His skills in potions and the Dark Arts was also incredibly impressive, so it was no surprise he was chosen to be Dumbledore’s right hand, as well as the Dark Lord’s.
“I don’t know. I guess I’m just…” He picked at a piece of croissant. A dark blond eyebrow was quirked down and he had on a contemplative pout.
She nodded and pulled out a small pink spiral notebook with bedazzled butterflies on the cover, passing it to him.
“Wow indeed.” Draco couldn’t help saying. It was a little much - we get it, it’s a herbologist’s classroom.
“Then what’s the difference?” Sirius asked frustratedly, tone getting louder. He was scratching his head, that migraine clawing at the edges of his brain in warning.
After food, they played a few rounds of Wizard’s Chess - Draco won 10 to 0. The sad thing was that Sirius wasn’t even trying to let him win, the older man grew more frustrated with each loss and was agitatedly gnawing at a pawn in his hand, its pitiful tiny screams were a little unsettling but Sirius seemed too distracted to notice it.
Harry gave a mystified laugh at the bizarre interaction. The house elf bowed so low it practically collapsed over the floor, arms splayed out long and apart, the bat-like ears pointing down. Draco realised it was completely ignoring him, it’s bow directed towards Harry instead.
He was far straighter to the point than Draco was expecting, it made things very uncomfortable to talk about with Potter and McGonagall as his audience.
“What are you going as, then?” Draco prodded, lids lowered as he curiously observed the Alpha towering beside him.
“About what?” Harry said slowly, he was still withdrawing from his head and returning to reality. Silver eyes blinked of existence.
The wolf rises onto its hind legs, its mouth open and panting, thick strands of saliva and blood were webbing from tooth to tooth.
When he averted his gaze again to plot how to say things next, a commotion was unfolding nearby the punch bowl that attracted both their attentions, and Draco quickly lost track of his thoughts. A group of Alphas were ganging up on who he recognised to be the Omega First Year, whose face was twisted into an unhappy and frightened glower.
It refused to break through the first firm ring of muscle, it wouldn’t stretch, and the harder he tried the more stressed about it Draco felt, making the hole clench tighter.
even the paintings were somewhere else - everyone must have been enjoying the remainder of the Sunday afternoon outside.
they were nearly as thick as his own fingers. It’s head was a bulbous, bludger sized thing, and was followed by 12-inches and a fat knot shape at the base. The site of it made Draco’s mouth water, unable to resist a few gulps.
Harry slowly came to a stop and threw him a funny look, “I dunno? Probably was told all he needed to know from Sirius and just wanted to let you relax? Why?”
Thanks to Pansy, Draco’s mood had lifted considerably, to the point he felt himself enough to go back with her to the Common Room to play rounds of Wizard’s chess with his house mates, and
“You don’t need to know that much, Potter. It’s private.” Draco tried to stand a little taller, his chin could just barely rest on the other’s shoulder if he wanted to - which he didn’t.
She shrugged and kicked her feet casually. “My mum said it was because Omega’s needed to be strong enough to protect themselves so they could stay pure. For their one true Alpha. She’d also tried to tell me that bad Omegas - the one’s who would have as many Alphas as they wanted - would get worse until they died. She said they would be stretched out so thin they’d lose all their magic. Morgana le Fey was an Omega, y’know. It took me ages in the library to find that out, since there’s not much written about us. She was seriously one of the most powerful Witches ever.”
The aged Alpha and power warlock’s face could be seen through the fireplace, a bright red glow to his features exaggerated by the Floo fire. He was stuffing tobacco into the chamber of his pipe.
” Draco suddenly shouts and slammed his forehead into Potter’s nose. Deja Vu was unshakable as the other boy screamed a manic, pained howl. Harry gripped his nose with one hand while he held up another towards Weasley, who appeared out of nowhere and had his wand pointed directly at Draco, the tip glowing yellow.
, it was like a centuries-old modus vivendi was now invalidated, and something unnatural was taking place tonight.
Finally, after what felt like too long, Dumbledore cleared his throat and asked his final question. “As for your next heat, did you know when that would be?”
Draco’s eyes were so large and round, it was a little hypnotic at times if you let yourself fall for their charm.
Draco’s stomach clenched painfully and he was panting hard into his hands, still gripped tightly over his mouth.
“How can you believe anything he says?” The Dark Lord whispered angrily, his red eyes narrowed and his slit pupils quivered.
. His parents were willing to ship him away to avoid being murdered by their beloved Dark Lord, instead of just running away with him, the three of them together. Draco couldn’t even picture a reality where his family give up their lives and political power - as one of the most elite and prestigious pure-blooded Wizards in the United Kingdom - just to save him. They loved him, but they could never love him
Sirius looked up to observe him for an unusual amount of time before flashing another quick, self-assured smile. “‘Course.”
He found out her favourite colour was yellow and she was planning to incorporate it into her costume this year. She even told him that her favourite subject was mythical animal science and she had a rabbit familiar named Gummy (he was thirteen and had lost most of his teeth).
“I won’t.” The man said, he sounded so close, like his lips were pressed into the flat plane of the door. “I won’t come inside.”
Frustrated, he gripped a fist and slammed a punch into a nearby locker - the smooth cold metal shuddered at the impact. Fuck, did he feel stupid.
Severus leant in, close enough that Draco felt pressured enough to take a few steps back, until his lower back touched the corner of Severus’ teaching desk.
Sirius puffed out a laugh again at the petulance of the answer. Draco was still so much like a child sometimes. “You’re right, I don’t. Surely at some point your parents talked about arranged marriages with you? I assumed you’d be ready for that sort of thing. It’s pure-blooded tradition, or am I wrong? Is that not what the Malfoy’s are about? It was for the Black’s.
Draco coughed and waved his hand around his face, screwing his eyes shut to keep the glitter’s microscopic shards out of them - the last thing he needed was to be blinded too. “Nice…” He said with an air of exasperation.
It hooted at her and fluttered its wings a couple of times before pecking the unassuming crumb out of existence.
That perfectly symmetrical face materialised in his imagination - those fairy lips were wet from a lick by a sneaky pink tongue, they perked up into a pouty smile -
“We’re supposed to be meeting in the Great Hall now to set up.” Draco heard Harry say in stead of greeting.
A hand was curling around the side of Draco’s neck, where he burned his hottest, and just stayed still. Draco’s body seized up for the strangle or slap or punch that never came. Potter’s finger tips were just… gently pressing into his skin. It miraculously stopped the flood of power. Draco was somehow capable of breathing again, they were shallow shaky breaths and yet they filled his lungs anyway. Where had he learn to do
As for Lucius… Lucius was being kept in one of the guest rooms. She knew only because she was still given quite liberal freedoms, which included numerous access to areas of the Manor. She recalled seeing him slumped on the bed, gaze vacant, at least he seemed free of recalling the horrors.
. Draco looked down to see he was standing on the last remaining rock around, the rest of the area around him in a 100 metre radius had reduced into a smoking black desert.
as promised! a follow up chapter shortly after! i'll be adding drawings in for these last two chapters soon (just coming up with scenes id like to redraw so if you have suggestions i'll hear em out ;) )
“What is this about?” Draco said, reaching the top of the stairs, before Headmaster Dumbledore could even greet him.
Before Draco could even touch his wand to the common room’s stone wall, a house elf with a twisted nose and cleft lip Apparated in front of him. The creature was only tall enough to reach Draco’s hip so it had to bend back it’s head painfully far to meet Draco’s eyes.
) He couldn’t help the blush forming on his face... The article seemed a little shameless. Luna was a very, very -
to ever lay your hand on another student. You yourself would understand that no matter who you are… Omega, Alpha, or Beta, does not give anyone the freedom to inflict violence on another Wizard or Witch. You’ve embarrassed me and this whole school.”
“No,” Her master said, in a ghostly whisper. “We will wait. We still have some time. If it is ready now, as you said, Mr. Yaxley, then we have an upper hand.”
stories of the other Omegas recalling their beginning, but to actually see him… He looked like he barely graced eleven. Draco felt something gouge a piece of his heart. He recognised the novel scent of newly presented gender,
“Help yourself, by the way. Have you tried the cake? It’s that one over there, Nona’s graveyard cake.” Very
Draco was upstairs asleep, tuckered out, finally giving in to the weariness that weighed on him half an hour ago. Downstairs, the grandfather clock revealed it was only a quarter to nine, and Sirius was now settling into his chair for his final report of the day’s events to Dumbledore.
Draco seemed to squirm at the tremor of the engine, and shifted backwards until he was almost on Sirius’s lap, back flushed against his chest. Sirius dared to sneak a glance at his face, and just as he imagined in his head there was a faint blush taking over his cheeks and ears.
“You look after yourself, kiddo.” Sirius said with a grim look on his face, patting Draco’s shoulder. Draco was wearing a padded black pea coat, so it was impossible to enjoy the warmth of the older man’s calloused hand.
Draco whispered through a small yawn, while he warily dragged himself out of bed. He tried to pat down his wild, bed tossed hair but it seemed fruitless without a spell. “But I’m not... I haven’t...I mean, I knew we’d be doing this just not so soon.” Draco wasn’t showing any symptoms, his neck hadn’t even started to ache yet. He didn’t think his scent had changed much, no Alpha in school was reacting any worse around him than usual. In fact Draco felt perfectly fine, if not better than he had been for the last two and a half months.
“How did you do that?” Draco interrupted. He had his hands on his hips and was staring up at Harry expectantly.
“—He’s good, Draco. He cares about us, he knows what’s best for everyone. Even you Draco. Even if your family…” He wisely didn’t finish that sentence. Instead he distracted the conversation by pretending to scratch an itch on his face, the sound his nails made against the youthful stubble on his cheek was soothing, the Alpha seemed to be chewing on his next words a little more carefully this time. “Like I said, I don’t want to fight anymore, feels like I’m getting too old for it. Like we both are. And god why would I want to lose the chance to be with someone as fit as you. And I know you need help, I want to help you. To save your family - ”
Anxious energy was coursing through him from the anticipation of a fight now and it was causing the hairs on his neck and arms to bristle. The tallest of the Alpha boys looked up, and as if he noticed the unease, he smiled, leaning away from the First Year to stalk towards Draco instead.
“Ah, ah. For all intents and purposes, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it’s a duck.” He snatched the glasses off Pike’s face, who let out a displeased mewl at his lost prize, and threw them to the ground - Marcus stomped the pointy, bright orange plastic frames into the grass and soil, crushing them into little broken pieces.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, snarling at him. Others at the table were all watching them, straining to hear the conversation.
“You heard the man,” Fenrir said to Draco, still chuckling. “I have to bring you back alive. C’mere, pet.”
Draco allowed the gesture, and let his face be held, but he still averted his eyes - it might have translated as shy, but the truth was he felt more awkward than anything. “Yeah. Something like that. Look… Harry.” Draco said, the name sounding foreign to his ears out-loud. Was this the first time he’d ever said the boy’s first name without a hint of distain or sarcasm? He missed the days before their genders became such pivotal factors to their lives, it was all so simple. “It’s not going to be that long before my heat starts up again…And I…”
Sirius’ stomach lurched, and his throat was slowly closing in on the words he whispered out. “Do you think she’s dead?”
“Oh my god,” Ron quietly groaned, shaking his head in his hands. “You... take Malfoy to a ball. I’m too young to be rolling in my grave, mate.”
Draco forced with all his might to seal his hands together, to snuff out the ball. The will of power it took sent waves of agonising muscle spasms up his forearms and into his shoulders, but with a final shout he was able to kill it. The wind stopped. The light disappeared, and they were momentarily shrouded in darkness until Snape’s candles re-lit themselves magically.
A flash back of the Boggart came into mind, the booming laugh had frightened him to the core — but now, as the Werewolf before him opened his wet mouth, he realised it had the potential to be much
they flew into the same suitcase Draco used when he was first port keyed to the historic Black family home, it was mistakenly kept open from last night.
Through the window you could make out the Death Eater sentries standing guard outside, they lined the beache and front garden - Bellatrix knew more were inside the house, and some were sent away to dispose of any muggle or blood-traitor bodies that belonged to this newly acquired location. The sea that lined the boarder of the property whipped and frothed, its water black and shapeless.
He was supposed to be meeting Potter on the third floor, a median in the castle between Slytherin house and Gryffindor house. All their classes for the day were over, but he was still in his uniform - it was so Filch knew they would be going to a school organised activity, and not shirking off somewhere they shouldn’t be. It was a shame because he was hoping to get a glimpse of those muggle jeans again, they intrigued him - I mean, how can something so restricting and uncomfortable to the touch really be comfortable? Why did they make… arses look so good.
Draco looked down at her, her breath wreaked of whiskey and her lipstick was smeared across one cheek.
What was even the point? There was so much on his plate that the last thing he wanted to use his time doing was translating ancient runes or transfiguring complicated atoms into different but equally complicated atoms. He knew mother wouldn’t have approved, and he also wasn’t going to let this stroke of overwhelmingly bad luck tarnish his immaculate academic reputation, so he journeyed on, like a convict waiting for an inevitable sentence.
The Omega hadn’t even said goodbye. And he was going to be spending the week with an unbonded, unpredicatble Alpha like Sirius while his own self-restraint was already at its most compromised. It was a terrible idea, and Harry was absolutely furious…
Unfortunately for Blaise and Pansy, Draco could only be bothered to listen to their pointless conversation long enough for the first few students to finish up. He greedily watched them leave their tables and cruise for the door. All Draco wanted to do was sit by himself in the dark for the rest of the night.
“I know. Shut up. I know what is happening. I believe it is an effect of the combination of partial-bonds within you. Potter might have weakened Fenrir’s imprint, meaning the beast is less likely to find you without access to Hogwarts, but it's not
Draco didn’t have time to come up with a response before Niffler burst into existence between them. Draco could see Lucia duck her head in embarrassment in the corner of his eye, seeming to have recognised it. This was the first time Draco had acknowledged her presence in the room at all, and he was regretting doing so, because he was now too attuned to the number of times she was looking over at him.
And then that orb of twitching, colourful energy around him detonated, taking out with it 1/3 of the bank. The area around him became highly-pressurised, resulting in a wave from the blast shattering every window in the castle up the hill.
He noticed Professor Snape comfortably cloaked in shadow by the doors, leaning back with his arms crossed, acting in his role as chaperone and looking every bit as bored out of his mind as possible.
so ya main reason why Luna can be her own cool special omega is coz she might be a teensy wee bit on the spectrum
“What exactly happened yesterday? Minerva said she heard an explosion. You didn’t have your wand so what did he do to you?”
“Petal, if you wanted to keep a low profile then it’s not going to happen in those, your arse looks good.” He whistled approvingly and leant back and to the side, getting a sneaking glance at the curve just behind the teen.
Draco muttered out an apology and shook his head for clarity. Get it together. He cast a freshening charm on his inkpot and attempted to start the sketch.
“I used to, when I first presented. I think I was ten. It got worse each year. I think it didn’t help that my parents never let me do anything. They’re both from really traditional families and they thought Omega’s aught to be in the home until they had their own Alpha.”
“I’ll remind you that we only have four known Omegas in this school, possibly less than ten in the whole country. What I know about them, and how to cope with a situation involving them is somewhat rudimentary.”
Sirius waited for what was really on the other man’s mind. It took some time, after several slow exhales of smokey breath, but Dumbledore let out a haunted sigh and finally explained:
She imagined what he might have said, if things were normal. If he had presented as an Alpha like he was supposed to. Or even as a Betan child. ‘Mother classes are a bore.’ ‘Mother, you would never believe what Potter and his mindless goons said to me this time.’
“And… thank you,” he finally said, looking to the side to meet Blaise’s dark brown eyes, now molten bronze in the firelight. “But I’m going to try and solve this without an Alpha.”
This was it, he had to finally give in. He couldn’t save his family alone, not without help to control his magic, not without an ally. Like recklessly letting go of a broom while upside down in the air, welcoming danger, the Omega took a deep breath of the Alpha. The proximity made the scent so thick it was like plunging his face into a barrel of fire whiskey, his face burnt from the potency of it, yet Harry still carried the most calming scent of all, and one thing it told Draco was that their partial-bond was still in place, albeit weaker than ever. Despite sleeping together only once, despite the resistance and walls he put up around himself, there was still a small, faint connection, and it was serving its purpose of offering some resemblance of comfort.
“Yes, as this is your first year back and we happened to come across this infested cabinet last week, the Head Master thought who better to deal with this Dark creature than my talented students?” It seemed no matter how small Draco tried to make himself, he could make out Snape’s black eyes staring straight at him. There was a small, grim smile on his gaunt face. “Shall we proceed?”
Draco slapped both his hands over his ass, horrified by the man’s lack of filter. “Good god, I hate you.”
It was Sirius. Draco could smell him before his brain even needed time to register which name belonged to that voice.
“Why can’t you just be grateful for my help?” Potter snarled, in seconds his hands came up to grab Draco by the wrists, squeezing so tight the sensation of blood pumping was overwhelming in Draco’s reddening hands.
There was no way in Hell he could have predicted this heat happening as spontaneously as it did. His journey as a late presenting Omega was endlessly burdened with problems and challenges.
“Then I’m confused, why would you accept?” Draco stared into the illusion of his eyes, the metal grey he remembered now an amalgamation of golds, reds, and blinding yellow.
“Do you really not like me that much?” Said Potter once they reached the bottom and had slipped out from the entrance.
“Forget a minute, I’m going to bed. Spell out the stains from the sofa when you’re done, Mr. Manly-Men.”
Draco ran his fingers over the swell of Harry’s pectoral muscles, until they creeped up higher, around his large shoulders, until they clasped the sides of Harry’s neck.
“No,” she interrupted. “You haven’t been observing, you’ve been sulking, like a little miserable squib. What is with you? Talk to me, what the hell is the point in moping like this? You literally haven’t moved from that spot since this morning!”
Nothing but the time the train was meant to depart - 4:30AM - and from personal experience, how long the train typically took to get back to London - 3 hours.
He wasn’t even given the chance to say goodbye to his friends or collect any homework he may be assigned for the week.
That’ll do it. Darkness was swimming around the edges of his vision, all he could see now was Potter still staring down at him.
He didn’t wait for anyone to respond, only pushed out of his seat without a second to spare. Out of the corner of his eye Draco could see Potter had unmistakably done the same and split from his friends to weave his way to the grand doors.
“All you need to do is go through the steps as you two had done before, we’ll make sure things are comfortable for you.” Dumbledore said, smiling and looking pleased with the lack of pushback.
“I am.” He sounded pleased with Harry’s ability to put two and two together, which never failed to ignite a warm feeling of pride burning in his chest. “This is why I think it will be best once you two have unionised, Draco would be more persuadable to help the Light in its fight against Voldemort, and his magic would offer us a much needed advantage.”
edit: if you've come back to read this again i've changed the drawing of sirius! i didnt really like it and it wasnt my best so i redid it.
This time Dumbledore did not speak again, and only stared at the pale boy. If he was annoyed at the lack of stimulating responses, he didn’t show it.
Draco’s eyes opened at that and he reluctantly sat up. His bed curtains were pulled open by the damned elf, who was standing a little too close to be considered polite.
“Mr. Potter?” The mild-accented Professor McGonagall said, getting his attention. “Could you come with me?”
The momentum of force it took Draco to swing his entire body into that punch had him skipping a couple steps forward before he regained his balance. Potter had flown down the hall and divided the newly gathered crowd cleanly in two.
“When I go back, it starts all over again. I liked how being here felt almost like a pause on my life. I know once I go back I’m not going to get another chance like this again…To just, be me. I’ve liked this week. I’ve liked not having to think about the
Draco couldn’t help the gust of air that must have been a laugh escape him, sometimes it was too easy.
“He’s not completely bonded? What does that mean? How’s he been allowed to go on like that for this long?” There was a sudden shift in his tone, he seemed more alert and agitated, like a poked lion.
“No, no - “ Draco said, taking a step forward, puffing his chest out and pointing his nose up indignantly “ - don’t stop on my account. Go on, kitten, you’ve been hissing since I got here, you have something to say? Then say it. I don’t play these games.”
Not once had he shown any signs of losing control of his magic. The boy had been polite, pleasant, and attentive. He was witty and always had a cutting response to say, it made interactions with him interesting, to say the least.
“I don’t know,” Draco admitted, answering the question. “I don’t know if I really want to talk about it now.”
“Well…Come on then.” The fight in him had died. “Dumbledore said they’d be meeting on the ground floor. It’s a classroom near the Great Hall. I think it’s usually used for herbalogist theory…”
could be their best bet. “That’s really cool, sounds like you’ve got entertainment sorted. We might be able to help out, just pass me the notes of what you were thinking and we can add some ideas to it? Could work out the practical at this weeks club meeting?”
The sun was setting, but he wasn’t exactly sure what time it was. It didn’t take him as long to finish as he had originally feared - Draco was very persuasive once he got into the role of a salesman, scouring each floor for potential victims. He didn’t really have anywhere to go now. He could head straight back to the common room for gossip and games ( - that lemon tart might be singing his name), or he could soak up the rays from the fleeting sun with an hour of flying. As he was deciding, something caught his eye - it was the Omega blonde from student council. She was opening the door to the herbologist’s theory room. She must be sneaking a couple of hours to do extra work on the Halloween ball prep, obviously enthusiastic about her role as leader.
Severus only watched him go, their eyes met and it was the first real antagonising moment between them since the new term.
She silenced her bubbling thoughts when the unmistakable black mist formed at the head of the table, all nearby light was sucked into it, and it grew until the Dark Lord’s translucent face emerged. His hands creeped out from the darkness to lay flat on top of the grand table. The darkness receded into his animated black robes, the torn pieces seeming to flap even without the presence of wind.
There was still enough sunlight for the boy to cast his gaze around the room, curious to see what else Sirius left the same and what might have changed. It only took him a couple of seconds before his eyes caught the disarray of colour overwhelming the surface of his mirrored cabinet desk, he choked on his saliva and felt his heart skip several beats when he finally made out what exactly he was looking at — Lined up proudly on his desk was a collection of phallic objects. It was the first time he’d ever seen something like this in his life, and the awe made him at a loss of how to proceed. There was a horrifyingly elaborate range of variety from an average-sized penis no bigger than Draco’s own to an enormous purple monstrosity he wasn’t sure could fit anywhere inside him without crushing his organs. There were at least fifteen or twenty of them standing like some art show piece, some looked more normal and resembled a phallus, others took on more sinister and outlandish shapes with tapered heads, bumpy or ribbed shafts, or enormous bulges on the bottom that imitated an Alpha’s knot. Each one was a different colour, a different length, one seemed to be wiggling on its own.
It was Harry’s turn to give a slow, single nod in response, but rather in an omniscient sort of way it came off stiff and awkward.
a cloying, sweet smell that hung in the back of your throat like perfume. Draco remembered the exact smell coming off himself in waves the night he woke up and presented, he remembered the flickering looks of confusion, shame, then horror across his parents faces as soon as they rushed into his room, having smelt him in their own bedroom across the other side of the Manor.
“It’s Oliver.” The boy deadpanned, but it didn’t stop him from leaning in on his haunches to steal a wet, tear-stained kiss from the Omega.
thank you all for the amazing support! i really really really appreciate you all letting me know throughout this how much this fun ol' story has left an impact on you!!! ;_; gives me goose bumps! thanks again everyone <3
It was probably half past seven by the time Draco had retreated from the first floor to make his weary way back to the Slytherin common room in the dungeons. It had
“Five more minutes…” Draco mumbled out to his assailant, sleepily swatting in their general direction.
The day went by easily enough, in fact from morning until the mid afternoon things were unusually pleasant.
The Alpha was chuckling and in his peripheral Draco watched him come into the room to scoop the toys into his arms, the site of the bundle was lewder than anything Draco had ever seen in his life. “Alright, alright. Was just trying to help, kiddo.”
Draco wasn’t sure what floor he was on. He looked around to spot any landmark, maybe there was a ghost, or a sign, but it was just a simple lamplit corridor.
She lifted her hands and waved them reassuringly, but there was a sad expression in her eyes “ - My parents only wanted the best for me. He’s the senior head healer at a private hospital. He’s lovely, he’s very nice to me. Being bonded to him made all the problems just go away. I really do owe a lot to him. But… If I had the choice, I wouldn’t have done it. You understand, don’t you?”
It must have come undone at some point while she tore at her hair, writhing in pain on the floor. There was still clumps of blonde hair between her fingers as she looked down.
Three songs in, and Draco was feeling a little warm around the collar, already eager to escape the tight crowd. His friends payed him no mind as he slipped away.
“Ohhh… The crazy girl.” Myrtle cackled, she instantly stopped crying and pool dived down towards the ground and through the floor,
He poked around at the Brussels sprouts he randomly picked for himself, rolling them in golden gravy. To be honest he wasn’t really hungry. He couldn't taste a thing knowing everyone was gossiping about what had happened today. He was either a rape victim or he was asking for it. His gender made people's opinion of it complicated because it was technically what he was made for. He wished people just didn't have an opinion of it at all. He wished everyone would just shut up.
What happened next felt sped up ten times normal reality, and every time Harry tried to process and replay the events, to piece together the splintered chaos, it would all rush by too fast to make any sense of it. The attack had caught the school by complete, utter surprise.
Draco snorted and brushed off remnants of the cheap party display from his shirt, the silk-like fabric glided along the palms of his hands, texture as smooth as water. “Colour me impressed. Is there tea?”
“And…” Draco started, then slowly shut his mouth again, this time cautious of his word choice. What ever he chose he was going to be unhappy. He could accept his unfortunate circumstances and settle for Potter, or accept Blaise’s strategic bond. Could Draco ever truly be satisfied? He had two paths, and he could only choose one. Mate to an egotistical, abrasive Alpha who had spent all of Draco’s high school years being the thorn in his ass, or mate to a ruthless and calculating Alpha that openly confessed that he wasn’t even interested in Omegas to begin with? Was that eventually going to cause a whole heap of problems on its own?
, it’s not like he had faculty to instruct the mind what not to think. Of course as soon as he was given his ultimatum Wednesday night Snape put a stop to any more after school aid, likely to crush Draco’s spirits, without hope the Omega was unlikely to bother trying to solve things on his own without a mate. Instead of putting his emotional mind to rest, Draco’s brain was defiantly doing the exact opposite - He could feel nothing but a vial hatred for all his teachers. He was bitter at their rash decision, all for the sake of solving the issue quickly with minimal fallout.
Draco did, not without flicking his hand free and crossing his arms in one swift motion, though. He wanted it to be perfectly clear just how vilified he felt. Frown severe and eyes unpleasantly stony. Breakfast was only down the hall. “Alright.”
When Harry couldn’t come up with a response, too busy riding the turbulence of his shock, the old Alpha continued. “What Draco is capable of…It’s unusual. I expected problems to happen as is the consequence of an unbounded Omega, especially at his age. But I fear that his age and his particularly strong affinity to magic as a Malfoy makes him far more dangerous. Dangerous not only to himself, but to us all.”
The two of them had just finished eating lunch and were sitting in each other’s company in the dining room, soaking in the afternoon sunlight.
“Everything happened.” Draco said, but shook his head when he realised that didn’t really make sense. “I’ve been given three days to accept being mated by Potter on my heat or I’ll be expelled.”
The first one to recover was Yaxley, who stood forward and tilted his head upwards. “Severus has completed repairs of the Vanishing Cabinet already, as he assured us he would, but he has been reluctant to inform me when a suitable time to strike would be.”
“Unfortunately, Severus could not attend.” He said quietly. “But our access point is nearly complete. Dumbledore expects nothing, as does the
“Oh, merciful Saint Potter!” Harry was such an ignorant fool. He was too loyal for his own good to see reason. He couldn’t make an opinion of his own, and he was painfully reminded of the snubbed handshake on the train, all because Potter let a Weasley convince him so easily.
Draco also didn’t have an answer for her. He’d been coming to the girl’s abandoned second floor bathroom since Second Year - whenever he had to think, to cry, to vent. So it only made sense that he would come here, and yet, he hadn’t.
“Oh, Draco. Did you need me?” Her mind was clearly assuming he’d meant to ask something about the dance, but Draco had ulterior motives. He pushed the door further in for her and held up another hand, offering her the pleasure of walking in first.
He decided not to say anything else to avoid encouraging Sirius from coming back inside with the others.
The floating suitcase that had followed them vanished along with the house elf, so without anything to pressingly tend to, Draco made his way up the hillside towards the castle for breakfast. His mouth was already watering at the thought and his belly complained for food.
“It’s imperative that you do this right, Draco, Voldemort is increasing the numbers to his army every day, and the Light have been stretched thin across England to keep him from killing too many Muggles. The Wizarding World is at risk of being exposed any day now. Things have…become very crucial.” His last sentence was said on the breath of a sigh, and the old man withered in his chair. “I need to know that I don’t also have to worry about you any longer than is necessary.”
Harry winced, he’d known for a long time that things were gravely wrong, and that this war would not be easy to take on, after many nights alone to suffer in his nightmares, shared visions from Voldemort himself, of Nagini, and sometimes others.
now the chapter ends with sirius! bye bye sweet prince! back to hogwarts we go and onwards out of the eye of the storm that is draco's journey so far ;)
“But it’s not like it’s a big deal or anything, I mean I’m sure you can smell what I’ve been up to? Right? Surely.”
. The heat is necessary after all, which you yourself had eventually experienced with your ex-mate. So any severe health side-effects to Harry, similar to your own bond during your time with us at Hogwarts, is not exactly a concern, Sirius.”
****EDIT***** hey guys!!!!!! i promised i'd be publishing the next chapter when i got it up to 10k.... but i have to be honest... i'm at the word count goal and....it's still not finished!!!!! i feel like it still needs double the content to feel complete.... so please be patient while it's baking! in the meantime please feel free to read the story again ;) hopefully by the time you're back here again this damn chapter will be out!
Harry was gutted. He looked completely ashamed of himself, like a kicked dog. The reprimanding from his hero clearly world shattering to some degree.
The Alpha took another step forward and Draco attempted to inch away, preparing himself to unleash another whip of magic.. however he did it.
i wonder how much of the end game you guys can already predict? ;) i think i've just about figured out how i want things to end and this will probably be dragged out to a 20-25 page fic (was originally meant to be a 12 pager!!)
“You’re starting to sound like a Slytherin.” Ron growled, his eyes narrowing to slits. “Wonder why.”
Harry waved her goodbye and stared back into the flickering flames, it didn’t seem like Ron would be returning to pick up where he left off.
thanx for reading and feedback is appreciated :') <3 i do these for fun but it's always great to improve
Screams, gasps, coughs, and cries erupted all around - while those that could, like water to oil, recoiled back as far away as possible from the new threat. The edges of the remaining door and wall were singed ret hot, the charred wood on the ground oozed smoke, which concealed the depths of the corridor and foyer beyond.
He could only focus his blurring eyes enough to see Potter drag himself off the ground to stalk towards him, not wasting a single moment by throwing a solid punch across Draco’s cheekbone. Draco took the painful jab as an opportunity to grab at the bigger boy’s elbow, pulling him forward to land his fifth and final punch. Draco felt his face grow sorer and found it harder and harder to see what exactly he was hitting. His knuckles stung, assuming he burst the skin.
Before Harry could bite out a reply, Romilda walked into their conversation. She cleared her throat and waved a hand in front of Harry’s line of site. “Hey, Scar-boy. I wanted to ask you some things about the decorations.”
The walk was brisk and quiet, it didn’t feel like the right time for Draco to bring up what was on his mind involving the older man. Snape himself was pretending as if it never happened, he hadn’t mentioned it once, and that suited Draco more than it didn’t.
— he’d at least write a fucking note first. He took a long breath in through his nose and let it out through his mouth, and counted slowly to himself, a method of calming himself Snape taught Draco. Back when he was still receiving private lessons to control his Omegan magic, back when Draco still had hope of being free. The true lesson he learnt was that goodwill could only ever last so long, and eventually payment In exchange for kindness was always owed in
