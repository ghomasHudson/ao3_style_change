The New Sussex Inn was an inferno, completely engulfed in flames. Bellatrix grabbed Draco's face with both hands, forcing him to watch the black mountain of smoke rising high into the air.
"So... you're gay?" I ask, feeling hands grip my waist and gently guide me towards the wall, next to the fireplace. I feel the warmth of the fire on the backs of my legs before I hit the wall.
As it turned out, the New Sussex Inn wasn't entirely unlike the Leaky Cauldron. The pub downstairs was smaller and seedier, and there were far less people crowded inside; Harry had done a good job of finding an obscure place to meet. The town was small and everybody seemed to be wearing Muggle clothing, but inside the pub itself there were quite a few people wearing robes. Draco felt less out of place sitting down at the bar than he did walking through the streets of Pevensey. The afternoon sun shone had down on him like a spotlight, and he had pulled his hood around him more carefully to hide his hair.
"Then do it," I whisper, my words accentuated by each inward and outward motion of his fingers. Slowly he gets to his feet, kissing his way up my stomach and chest and neck and eventually his fingers are out of me and I feel so utterly empty. I moan at the release and finally take his cock into my hand, rubbing the precome with my thumb and fisting slowly his entire length. I feel him shudder against me and I wrap my other arm around him, pulling him closer. My cock gets caught in the fabric of his boxers and it is so sensitive that I gasp.
I'm permanent
He didn't see himself at first for all her youth and beauty, but eventually he noticed himself, walking next to but slightly behind his mother as they headed toward the robe shop.
~*~*~
"I don't want to stop. Do you?"
~*~*~
Little Draco nodded, standing up and looking back once more, full of determination. "Don't worry. I'll make him
"If you put the candle inside it, everybody else in your vicinity will be in total darkness, you'll be the only one who can see… Harry, please…" Draco cried, reaching out to the area where he thought Harry might be. Harry grabbed it from him roughly, and Draco fell back against the wall.
"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been - imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?"
"We've
have been possible because he had not sent word to his father yet.
As he brought the glass to his lips, he realized that he was in fact incredibly thirsty. He drained most of it before setting it on Harry's desk. Then he let his head fall back against the headboard again. Harry sat down beside him as easily as if he'd been sitting down next to him in the library for a study session, and Draco couldn't help himself.
But still you say
Harry nodded slowly, looking miserable. "Yeah, I… I get it now."
"Hello, son," Lucius looked up from behind his desk, looking disheveled. There were three open books before him, and he seemed to be taking notes. No doubt something the Dark Lord had asked of him. The only thing the Malfoys seemed to be good for anymore was busy work, which Draco frankly didn't mind. "Is everything all right?"
"All right. I will."
Draco didn't think he had ever been happier to see anybody in his life. And as usual around Harry, he found himself rendered speechless and immobile. He could only look at him and understand for the first time a desire to see Harry every day for the rest of his life.
Draco tried to kill himself after he got back to his room that night.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Draco noticed a wetness dripping alongside his jaw. He touched his cheek, and when he looked down at his fingers he was horrified to see blood. Feeling faint, he wiped the trickles of blood emanating from his ears with the inner sleeves of his robe, and leaned against the side of the building again to catch his breath and take it all in.
It had been quite a ceremony, though most of it now was only a blur of remembered pain and fear. All members of the Dark Lord's inner circle had been present, and there had been several incredibly long incantations, chanting, and blood-red wine that had stained the Dark Lord's tight pale lips an ugly pink. The only thought with any staying power in his mind was of a night at the end of his fourth year, when Harry had dragged him down to the lake to inform him that Lucius was a Death Eater and that he needed to be careful and get out if things got bad.
"He put the idea in my head.
But it does matter. How can it not? When has Potter ever
"Can I Apparate us to your room?" he asks, and I nod. His arms encircle me and I am still holding his cock when we go. I have no idea how he knows where my room is, but I just assume it's some Auror thing he can do and go with it.
"Nothing! I wasn't being serious, I just… listen," Harry sighed. "I'm upset, but not angry. I know this was never something you would choose for yourself." He leaned closer, until they were shoulder to shoulder again. "We've talked about this as a possibility before, and you always seemed determined to use it against Voldemort if it came down to it. Even though you
"First, I will use him to make a call." A cold, bony hand encircled Draco's sprained wrist and pulled him to his feet, and Draco cried out in pain.
"This is bullshit!" he yelled. He turned around and Draco feared for a moment that he might be about to punch the wall, but instead he hit it hard with the flats of both hands, and then rested his forehead against it, breathing heavily.
is Potter doing this? What reasons does he have to want to do something like this for
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Harry's lips moved slightly over his, unsure. Draco knew that Harry had snogged at least once before in his life, though if he'd done any snogging this year Draco wouldn't have a clue. If he'd had to wager a guess based on Harry's current performance, he would have said probably not.
was Ron Weasley's idea?"
I can feel him growing harder in my hand as he finally pulls my shirt open, and I rub him through his trousers, which are fast becoming a huge annoyance. I pull my hand away only momentarily in order to let the shirt fall to the floor, but he still moans as if I'm depriving him of oxygen or something. I smile, watching as he hurriedly removes his own red robes and the shirt underneath. I just trace the outline of his cock, quite aware of my own growing arousal. I'm harder than I can ever remember being, perhaps because I'd envisioned this moment in my mind so many times without ever thinking for a moment that it would become a reality. I'm kind of worried about having a heart attack, the damn thing is pounding that quickly in my chest. He feels so damn
"It bothers me that you can't tell me, even though I know why you can't. And I respect that." Harry sighed. "I just hate it. If something happened to you and I couldn't find you, I'd never forgive myself. I'm sorry."
After he watched the goblin place his envelope in a special, time-sealed safe, Draco returned to the little alleyway next to the robe shop. There was nothing in the alley but a couple of bins, so Draco knew he was relatively out of the way. He donned Harry's cloak again and stood by to wait.
All thoughts of ice cream seemingly forgotten, Little Draco stared up at himself in complete awe. "You look just like me still," he uttered.
He was half an hour early, and so he did not really expect to find Harry there yet. He ordered himself a pint and shrunk the bag of potions ingredients he had gone to Diagon Alley that morning to purchase so that it would fit easily inside the pocket of his robes.
Draco took his wand out and set up a couple of wards around the table. "My name is the same as yours," he admitted.
. Just that knowledge alone was enough to rid him of his regularly scheduled nightmares.
The barstool he had chosen had the best view of the room. It was nearest the wooden stairwell that Draco assumed would lead to private rooms, had a view of the rest of the bar, and faced the door. Nobody could enter without his knowledge, and there he waited, just watching, heart pounding a staccato rhythm in his chest. Several men and women came and left, but none that he recognized. Harry hadn't told him what to expect, and so Draco had no idea if Harry would be under his cloak or under a Glamor Charm or what. The knowledge that he could be any of the people who had walked in or even a gust of unseen wind unsettled him greatly.
Harry chuckled against his skin. "Ron is downstairs right now, you know."
It came to him all at once, as his vision was bombarded with the foreign Muggle landscape, that he had no idea where Harry's street actually was. He wandered aimlessly for awhile, and though it was hot, he appreciated the fact that it kept the townspeople from traversing the streets with him. He was in no mood to be gawked at, and in even less of a mood to talk to anybody who was not Harry.
"Thanks." Draco stood, wanting nothing more than to get out. He couldn't stand being in his aunt's presence more than was strictly necessary.
He entered in past Harry, looking around at the strange white kitchen and turning to face Harry after he shut the door again.
Draco pulled away, placing his hands on either side of Harry's face. "In that case… goodbye, Harry…" He leaned closer and kissed him, unafraid - the way he had been imagining in his mind for months. Deeply, but without brute force, each of their heads tilting naturally in opposite directions and the wall behind them a helpful steadying ground. Almost immediately Draco felt himself pressed against it. His head hit the wall, but for some reason this time he couldn't have imagined finding the experience unsatisfactory in the least.
He had spent weeks in the Manor's library, scouring for the instructions needed to change the settings on the Time-Turner so that one turn would equal a whole year instead of just an hour. He was sure he had set it correctly; after his year spent tinkering with the cabinet, he had rather a knack for understanding the inner-workings of magical objects.
The boy nodded, sticking his hands deep into the pockets of his weird blue trousers and worrying his lower lip.
The one thing Draco had to admit was that they had only asked the other to meet up before under dire circumstances and normally for a very distinct and unavoidable reason. The fact that they had parted on bad terms a month and a half ago convinced Draco that this was not just an underlying desire of Harry's to make up - that would not be an important enough reason all on its own in Harry's mind. Even if Harry had no intentions whatsoever of forgiving him, the reason he wanted to meet up was probably a very good one. In that case, it might be wise for Draco to go to him.
I drop the spoon into my tea, and it splashes on the white tablecloth.
This was the house Harry had lived in his entire life, where he had been mistreated and abused. This room, so bare and empty (save for a shelf of broken gadgets not his own) contained everything Harry had in the entire world. Everything. Most of it fit into a trunk. There were some clothes in the closet and some papers and books on top of his desk, but that hardly constituted much. When Draco had been little, he'd imagined the young Harry Potter might live in a castle, and most certainly would be treated like a prince, with reverie and awe. The Harry Potter of his youth had been merely a comic book figure, but the real Harry Potter was human beyond measure.
Then, just before the Mark was burned into the skin of his left forearm, he was told exactly what it was the Dark Lord wanted from him. Find a way to get the Death Eaters inside of Hogwarts and get Dumbledore out of the way. Somehow, redeem the name of Malfoy before it crumbled and fell to pieces like an ancient statue that was not even pleasant to look at anymore.
Even if the Harry he saw was only eleven years old.
, and I just... twice!"
"So, Potter. What's the news?" To tell the truth, I feel slightly nervous about hearing the news. I busy myself by adding another spoonful of sugar to my tea and stirring it while he deliberates. He stares at me all the while, following the movements of my hand. I offer him the sugar spoon, but he shakes his head.
stoop so low. He's come pretty far, and I'm pretty sure if given the choice to do it all over again, he would get the fuck out, but now? His whole life's caught up in it. I doubt he'd know who he was without it. He's a prideful man, Harry. I think in the years you've known him that much should be clear."
Harry stood up. "Draco, I do trust you! But I care about you, too, and I don't want to see anything happen to you! I didn't know where you were going!"
"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands. Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow. Have
"What else, then? Out with it!"
Draco took a deep breath, closing his eyes tight. "
That you'll never see me cry...
Will you think that you're all alone
He took a deep breath. "The effects of the necklace won't kill Katie. In a month and a half, the curse will lift and she'll be just fine. And Ron…" Draco opened his eyes then, feeling that he owed it to Harry to look him in the eye. "Even if you hadn't been there with your trusty bezoar, there was a time-released antidote inside that bottle. He would have been all right, given another couple of minutes." Draco didn't know what to do with his hands, so he crossed them. "And I know none of that makes it okay. But what you have to understand is that if I hadn't done
"I can't believe you're actually here," Harry said after they had entered his room, shutting the door behind them. In what seemed like a single, fluid motion Harry came forward and was hugged him tightly around the shoulders. Draco winced. Harry had just grazed his arm, hadn't even come anywhere near the Mark, but the pain was pulsating, the echo of it aching just behind his eyes. With his good arm, he hugged Harry back as well as he could.
Gornuk lifted the bag and placed it on a scale, and his eyes widened in surprise. "Of course." He glanced at Draco. "Is simple owl post acceptable to you?"
After the order had been placed, Draco squeezed his mother's hand once and let go, taking a deep breath. "I think I'll just go to the loo. Do you mind?"
"Shh, s'me," Harry whispered, leading him down the hall. He didn't let go as they paced back and forth three times. It was a welcome relief when the door finally appeared, and Harry let go of his arm.
"I'm sorry, Harry. No Harry Potter card-pulling for you today." Draco watched a ghost of a smile form on his face. "You're not the only one expected to make sacrifices."
Boy wants to meet Boy in the Leaky Cauldron for lunch.
"Shut up," Harry said simply in a low voice that was almost a growl - another first, Draco thought - before he closed the gap between them and attacked Draco's mouth with his own.
Then in the half-light, Draco saw first the tip of a wand appear, then the hand that was gripping the wand as it moved into view, and eventually Harry was visible in the sinking sun's light.
"Okay."
Harry again at all. They had met up only a couple of times during the year so far, both times after days Harry had had his lesson with Dumbledore. All four common rooms buzzed in contemplation of the so-called secret meetings of Harry and Dumbledore on those nights, and Draco had almost come to expect an owl from Harry the next day.
"Can't you talk to your parents? Dumbledore would help them, too, Draco!"
Harry shivered again. "I feel like… like we'll see each other again."
Draco covered Harry's hand with his own, creating a jolt of pleasure that surged through him. Draco let out a quick, disjointed breath and Harry grinned, moving closer to kiss him. Draco felt Harry's cock nudge his hand, and he released himself to take hold of Harry instead.
Quickly, Draco removed the cloak again and shoved it into his robe. He made sure his hood was up and stepped out of the alley and into the walkway, just as Little Draco had been about to pass the corner of the building.
~*~*~
"Well?"
"Wow," Draco breathed.
"Hi," Harry said quietly, in a gentle voice that Draco had never heard him use before. He was looking at Draco with wide eyes, and Draco tilted his head in contemplation of him because something was off. Draco studied him for a few more seconds before understanding what it was.
It could have been three days, or it could have been a month. For all Draco knew, time had stopped.
"Oh, me too," Draco said, and the boy looked at Draco again, seeming to have gained a measure of confidence. He crossed the length of the shop and climbed unsteadily onto the footstool next to him. Draco wasn't much taller, and he hadn't come across many kids his age who were thinner than he was.
He's fishing in his robes then, and he pulls out a wand. I'm on the defensive for about half a second until I realize he's holding the handle of it out toward me, and that it's mine. My old wand. My heart starts to race at the idea of touching it again. It's not like I expect it to work for me or anything, but even just the familiar feel of it would be comforting, I'm sure.
mattered?
Maybe it had never been his to claim in the first place.
kind, weren't they?"
Draco was rounding the corner at the bottom of the stairs when the cloaked figure grabbed him and spun ever so slightly to the right. Harry had been right behind him.
Draco crossed his legs. "I've finished for the day."
The boy smiled sheepishly. "I don't really know what slithering means," he admitted. Draco's eyebrows rose, but before he could reply the boy went on. "Oh! My name's Harry Potter."
Draco looked round at the boy again, but he hadn't moved. He was staring at Draco now, almost as if the boy were afraid of
Harry walked into the shop, and Draco rounded the edge of the building quickly, entering in his wake.
"I'm going to be friends with Harry Potter?" Little Draco asked, grin so wide it was splitting his face in two.
"You don't get it!" Draco said loudly, sitting up. "If any of them think for one minute that I've got access to you, and I haven't done anything to capture you, Harry - fucking hell, they'd kill me! And if they followed me, they could get to you, and it would be my fault…"
"Yes. Did you talk to Dumbledore?"
He almost jumped out of his skin when an invisible hand grabbed him by the elbow.
After a moment, Draco sat, unwilling to look Harry in the eye. It was true Draco had never confided in Harry about what he was doing, but he thought Harry had understood why he couldn't. He thought Harry knew that he had to protect his family above all else, that he wasn't going to let anything happen that might hurt Harry or his friends, and he didn't understand why Harry was jeopardizing everyone's safety by getting involved.
Draco almost laughed. "My father would
His lasts few thrusts are deep and fast, and then he's coming, burying his face in my neck. I can feel his cock pulsating, feel him empty himself inside me. I moan at the sensation, realizing I've never been coherent enough to really pay attention to what this feels like. He collapses on top of me, sweaty and warm and I don't want him to take his cock out yet. I love the connection between us, and I love just knowing that he's inside me. I wrap my arms around him and realize how glad I am that he asked me out first.
He grins back at first, but then he frowns. "I forgot the proposal on the table."
!" Draco leaped to his feet and pushed against the shield in desperation, completely oblivious to his own physical pain. He picked up his wand from the ground and hurled curse after curse at the wards, but they would not budge.
"Good," Draco nodded, feeling his eyes grow wet and watching himself run out the doors of the ice cream parlor.
Harry took a few steps toward him. There wasn't very much space to walk inside the room, so this brought Harry close enough that he was able to reach out and pull Draco's hood down. Draco closed his eyes briefly at the contact Harry's hand made against his cheek.
, of all people?
Afterwards, tables full of food and drink had materialized in front of him, and faceless people had come up to shake his good hand and congratulate him, as if he had just graduated from Hogwarts, or as if this were a benefit of some sort to honor him for having done a real service to society. Marcus Flint with his recognizable pigeon-toed gait had leaned in to whisper in his ear that he shouldn't feel bad. That everyone cried when they got the Dark Mark.
I'm permanent
Glamor it was, then. The dirty blond made his way through the crowd, his familiar green gaze never leaving Draco's face. When he reached the stairwell, he motioned toward it with a nod of his head, and Draco immediately stood. He dropped several coins onto the counter top and followed Harry up the creaky, wooden steps. Before the bar was out of view below him, he watched the tall man Harry had come with take the seat Draco had just vacated.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
, no less. He couldn't let himself think about what that might mean.
I make a mental note to ask what spell he's used, because there is no resistance at all but the friction is glorious and warm. He fucks me slowly at first, only allowing the head in and out of me. I attempt to impale myself further, but he only pulls himself back, and if the bastard weren't kissing me at the moment I would be vocalizing my unhappiness about this but I can only moan in frustration at the denial.
He waited in the corridor for Harry to get there. For some reason, it just didn't feel right to enter the Room of Requirement without him. He did not have to wait long, since the urgency in his letter had been pretty extreme. Because he was in such good practice (and also a long, silent hallway), he heard Harry coming long before he would have seen him and did not jump when Harry grabbed him, invisible, by the elbow. It had been three months since their last meeting.
"You're... are you asking me out?"
"It feels better already," he admitted.
"Where's your brother?" Little Draco asked, glancing around. "What's your name, anyway?"
Harry's face colors. "I've been thinking about asking you out since last week, too."
"I know. I was there." Draco grimaced, running his fingers through Harry's hair and tracing his scar. "We can stop making fun of me any time now."
Little Draco stared at the Time-Turner for several long moments - the same Time-Turner that had been sitting on his desk in the same place for most of his life. If Little Draco had been harboring any disbelief at all still about Draco's story, it was gone now. There were tell-tale scratches on the Time-Turner's surface that Draco had long since memorized.
"No."
The owl came in the middle of the night on Harry's eighteenth birthday. Draco had been in bed, not sleeping, but not quite awake, when he heard the light rhythmic tapping against the glass. He bolted straight out of bed and over to the window and practically ripped the letter from the poor owl's leg. It hooted at him before flying off again, not offering Draco the opportunity to send back a reply.
Is this the moment
"Hm?"
~*~*~
Draco's heart sank, even though this was exactly what he had been hoping for. "You're going to meet Harry Potter in the robe shop today."
Draco looked at Harry, unable to see very clearly in the darkening room, but knowing Harry's outline by the faintest of shadows and ridges. "My family is in danger, Harry. I can't desert them," Draco sighed. "And you, you're just too fucking good to be true. But… I don't know what I'd do if you weren't," he admitted, feeling out of breath. "Harry. I have to tell you, and I'm sure you know… it's not safe for us to be seen as friends. We've got to… I don't know, fake a falling out or something."
Little Draco's eyes widened. "What should I do?"
He tiptoed past Harry, making his way over to corner nearest to where the two boys stood together on their footstools.
again and again, now that he's found the angle. One of his hands pushes mine away from my cock and he grips it himself, timing the strokes perfectly so that there is never a beat without pleasure.
But if he was going to go at all, he needed permission to leave the house first.
"No, it's not." Draco's face fell. "I'm afraid I've got something to tell you that you aren't going to like very much."
~*~*~
~*~*~
"Good plan. That's great. And after you go, I'll-"
I don't know that we're friends, but I do know that we're both growing up and out of the past, and out of the notions that there are strict lines between the white and the black, the good and the bad. I feel like that line has been breached so many times in my life. I honestly can say I have been seeing in shades of grey since my first real meeting with Harry Potter. It was hard growing up with what I'd always been taught was good and realizing that I myself thought other things were better, and struggling to maintain both ideas inside the same head. No one ever warned me that I might change when I went away to school, or that there was a possibility of forming opinions of my own. No one told me that not all parents should be revered as if they hung the fucking moon. I realized soon enough that mine shouldn't have been, but for years I still wanted them to be. I still loved them. I still gave everything I had for them, and tried to get them out of the hole they'd dug for themselves.
Harry scowled and looked down, reaching toward Draco's left hand and being careful not to actually touch it. "Give me your arm," he said. "I've got something that will help."
Harry nodded. "All teachers, Prefects, and the Head Boy and Girl are in on it, too. The fireplaces in each common room are one spell away from being Floo-accessible, at least on this end."
They lay there breathing heavily and slick with sweat for several minutes until Harry let out what was unmistakably a giggle.
Everything is temporary, rest your head
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
He stops sucking, kissing the head of my cock before letting it go and looking up to meet my eyes. He is still fucking me with his fingers and with each inward thrust my cock moves, bobbing just inches away from his mouth. I am coming apart at the seams above him, but I do not let myself look away from his intense gaze.
"Oh, please, Lord… won't you tell them?" Draco wasn't looking up but he could see Bellatrix bouncing on her heels as she spoke.
"HARRY!" Draco screamed, falling against the invisible wall. It tingled and vibrated slightly where his skin touched it and he crumpled to the ground, still pushing feebly. He face was wet, but he didn't remember starting to cry.
The slow slide of his lips as he eases my cock out of his mouth makes me want to scream. His tongue is fluttering all around the head and one of his hands is feeling its way between my cheeks at the same time. Just one finger is making teasingly slow circles around my opening and I spread my legs a little wider, sliding slightly farther down the wall.
"Wear a cloak with a hood when you go," Lucius said without looking at him.
! Here to talk to Daddy?" She opened the door further to pull him into the room, hugging him tightly and ruffling his hair. Draco pulled away, resisting the urge to vomit. She reeked of something foul Draco didn't want to name, and he was pretty sure that the dirt under her fingernails was actually blood.
He made it through the majority of the party with his mother at his side, her cooling charms constant and surreptitious, but as soon as the Dark Lord and the other members of the inner circle retreated to have an executive meeting, Draco stumbled away from the thinning crowd. His mother watched him go with pain in her eyes, but she did not stop him.
Above all, Harry was alive somewhere in this world.
He wants to meet me at the Leaky Cauldron, but I put a stop to that plan right away. Is he insane? Does he realize how ridiculously unsafe that would be for him, and more importantly, me? Without my magic, I don't leave the Manor very often. The last time I ventured to Gringotts for a meeting with the goblin in charge of the Malfoy account, I was abducted. Seven wizards barely out of Hogwarts forced me into an alley off the main street and if Potter and Weasley - not his best friend, but the lone twin - hadn't been sitting outside that deathtrap of a shop to witness the whole thing, and if they hadn't decided to intervene, I'd probably be dead.
It was a long time before Draco moved, and even longer before he opened his eyes. But when he did, the first thing he saw was the ancient Time-Turner that old Grandfather Abraxas had left him before he died. It had been encased in glass, which was now currently in shards upon the floor. The Time-Turner itself was lying there, rusty and dented and filling Draco with the first seeds of hope since he had last seen Harry.
, and Draco changed, and that’s the whole fucking reason Harry fell so hard in the first place, because when someone who cuts like a knife learns to be kitten-soft it hits hard like a freight train.
Narcissa nods sagely. ‘Draco takes care of me,’ she responds. ‘He always takes care of me. He’s a good boy.’
‘I’m fine,’ Harry says. He gives Rosie a smacking kiss on the cheek and peels her sticky hands off his hair, wincing as she takes a few strands with her. ‘Honestly. This is just what it’s like, being an Auror.’
‘What is it with you and Neville and
Malfoy stares at him for a while, mouth open, eyes bloodshot, his left hand still clenched at the rim of the sink. Then, like a puppet with all its strings cut, he collapses in a heap on the cold floor. He’s so small, suddenly. So thin. His skin is so paper-translucent that Harry can count all the veins at his wrists and neck.
‘Therapist,’ Malfoy repeats, giving him a long-suffering look that is disturbingly reminiscent of Hermione. ‘That’s Muggle for Mind Healer. She’s really quite good.’
‘It gives you a lovely little tingle,’ Luna adds, and takes a sip out of Daphne’s glass.
Neville tilts his head. ‘You mean,’ he says slowly, levelling an indecipherable look at Harry, ‘commute to Hogwarts.’

‘But you
‘Are those for me?’ Malfoy asks, gesturing at the truffles. He never points - it’s weird and polite and charming and Harry could watch his strange little mannerisms for the rest of his life, probably.
Harry pushes up Draco’s sleeve and unflinchingly presses his thumb against the Mark, never once breaking eye-contact. His magic feels like a thunderstorm in the best way, piercing through the ugly, nausea-inducing pain of the Mark. His is like the sting of spices and the atmosphere crack of electrocuted air.
(See the end of the chapter for
Neville grins. ‘She fell into the tank three days ago.’
She’s crying now, properly crying in the street with her mascara running down her cheeks in sooty tracks, and even if there’s no one around to witness her weeping, she’s never done this before in her entire life - never let anyone see her break down.
‘Auror Proudfoot,’ Draco says, folding his arms over his chest. ‘I suggest you listen to me very carefully, because apparently you are the only Auror on the force that Minister Shacklebolt trusts enough to handle this. Please do try not to cock this up any further than you have.’
which sets Molly off. She slams the carving knife onto the table, hilt-first, and bellows, ‘NO WINTER WEDDINGS!’
Harry thinks about Sirius, that night in the Shrieking Shack. Sirius had been the perfect picture of a wild, Dark Wizard - covered in tattoos, barking out every word through gritted teeth, his eyes were just a little too dark, too wide, his laughter off-pitch and manic. And Harry - Harry had

Harry buries his head in his hands and lets out a frustrated moan.
Harry feels a rush of love for his wonderful, kind godson. He’s not usually this emotional, but he’s sleep-deprived and a little giddy on whatever the fuck is going on between him and Draco (he isn’t eager to look at it too closely, terrified of it dissolving in daylight), and he doesn’t know how he and Draco and Andromeda raised Teddy to be so

Another memory: a gathering of loved ones around a hospital bed, a silence that hangs over them like a living creature; determination a hot coal in Draco’s mouth as he stares each of them down;
Blaise pulls out a notebook and something that looks like an old-fashioned Muggle pen (with a screw cap and metal nib) but is charmed to never run out of ink. He crosses his legs, flips open his notebook, and leans forwards slightly, marking the beginning of the interview.
His stomach is a painful knot that clenches and unclenches. His head swims every time he gets up too fast, and if he drinks water that isn’t room temperature, he ends up throwing it all up again.
Harry wants to yell, but he’s still a bit too stunned to say much else.
Mr. Blake, the owner of the bookstore he works at, is a kind man. He gives Draco money for coffee. His wife makes Draco lunches for his long shifts. He buys Draco a coat when a particularly harsh winter strikes - and boots too, and then gives Draco these spectacular little pouches that can be warmed up in the mi-cro-wave and then tucked away in his pockets to keep him warm. He buys Draco Christmas presents and birthday presents and knows to keep a jar of sweets at the cashier, because Draco has a terrible sweet tooth.
‘Prentis, wait for backup!’ he yells, starting after her.
‘If I tell you something,’ Draco says softly, ‘will you promise not to laugh?’

. All I want is to do the same.’ His touch drifts over the interlocking spheres inked onto Harrys’ skin. ‘If this is what you want from me, it is yours. Anything you want from me is yours.’
It’s a little later on in the afternoon, so thankfully the shop is nearly empty. Harry’s a good sport about the whole Saviour nonsense - he shows up to benefits and kisses babies and signs autographs and gives speeches - but he does get a bit prickly after the tenth person tries to talk to him while he’s getting his groceries. Thankfully, nobody stops him as he makes his way through the colourful shelves towards the counter.
. In a different world, Harry follows that rising darkness and does something irredeemable, something unforgivable.
‘I’ve got fancy tea,’ Harry offers. ‘And I’m sure Kreacher will be overjoyed to see a new face.’
He smiles up at his old friend and pats him twice on the arm. ‘Good luck, Kingsley,’ Harry says. ‘You’ll need it.’
Blaise is a little cautious at first, responding politely to any questions aimed at him, but Pansy takes to it like a duck to water. She plonks herself down between Ron and George, and quickly discovers that George shares her terrible taste in liquor and is
It’s darling, it’s domestic, it makes Harry want to break down and cry and curl up in the safe embrace of Draco’s arms. He’s so in love it feels like a fucking Blasting Curse to his chest, but in a good way.
Dinner is lasagne, warm and luxurious, and pull-apart cheesy bread. Draco’s eyes are warm as he watches Harry lick the garlic oil off his fingers. They don’t talk about this gentle
He might not have recognized Blaise when he first appeared in the Great Hall, but Harry would recognize that particular inflection in his voice anywhere.
Blaise curses heavily. ‘He’s going to try and force Draco to fix the Time-Turner.’
, with you two finally - that it was finally…’
They take a walk together afterwards by the duck pond to walk off the effects of Molly’s overfeeding. Malfoy points out the constellations for Narcissa, Andromeda, Remus and Sirius. Harry points out the shimmering stars that form Malfoy’s namesake, which makes Malfoy stare at him long and hard like he’s trying to figure out a puzzle.
The only thing that Astoria’s wedding has in common with Ginny and Neville’s is the season it is held in.
missing.’
Paris is magnificent, as always. Every glittering part of the city demands attention - although this was what Draco didn’t like about it. It felt too reminiscent of his childhood, and to Draco, those memories are tainted by Lucius’s long shadow.
‘You can’t give up,’ Daphne says, her voice hard with anger, but her eyes are sad. ‘Or you’ll never get better.’
‘Thank you, Blaise,’ Harry says, shaking his head.
He shakes his head. ‘It’s - it’s just not time yet.’
Harry wants Draco’s hands to wander further. He wants those long fingers on every last inch of his skin, to explore each and every last of Harry’s many, many scars, to brush over the parts of him that have not felt such tenderness in years. He wants to be taken apart.
The room beyond it is small and unassuming. There is a waiting area consisting of a leather sofa and a coffee table covered in generic-looking magazines, and beyond that a large wooden desk, behind which sit two identical-looking young men. The man on the right has his hair twisted back into neat braids, while the other wears his curls cropped close to his skull, his face partially obscured by a well-maintained beard. They both look up at the same time as Harry closes the door behind him.

that Harry makes as Artemis’s considerable weight hits him in the chest. He sits up in bed, suddenly and hideously aware of his bedraggled appearance and the swollen shape of his eyes.
‘Maybe? I don’t know.’
Harry, in turn, tells Malfoy about taming Grimmauld Place, about his valiant efforts to compromise with Kreacher regarding housework, about how much he hates six-day work weeks, but it’s nice because it’s sort of pushed him and Ginny to move in together, which is great because Harry’s pretty certain he wants to be with her forever and a forever is nice after
- and a lie told by a mother, in a desperate ploy to save her son.
Sometimes Harry wonders if they should have just called him the Boy Who Watches Other People Die.
‘Someday, Harry,’ Draco says, ‘I will sit you down and tell you my side of the story, and you’ll see how much you’ve done for me.’
‘Why does your hair look like that?’ Daphne asks. She squints at the drawing, as though it might change shape if she stares at it long enough. ‘Do they think you’re part Veela?
‘I see what you’re trying to say. You think this-’ Draco says, gesturing loosely in the space between their bodies, ‘- is a crutch? That using my magical signature for your magical aid would make me upset?’
‘Honestly, his attention was absolutely focused on this Time-Turner,’ Draco sighs. ‘But maybe you’ll pick something up in the pensieve that I missed.’
A ringing has started in his ears, and the corners of his vision are going grey and grainy, like television static. He’s so tired. If he just closed his eyes for a minute, wouldn’t that be alright?
Granger’s husband with your blatant disregard for basic magical theory?’
As with everything else he does, Draco makes love with gentle, aching tenderness. He traces the arch of Harry’s back with careful fingertips as they pull close, close.
There is a study with large bay windows to let in plenty of natural light, and a living room stuffed full of books, and a bathroom with plenty of shelf space for fancy hair potions and a clawed bathtub that is charmed to produce lavender-scented bubbles, and a table in the conservatory where Harry and Draco can have breakfast on the weekends with the French windows open (if it’s warm enough), and so very many roses and violets and perennials in the garden, and a lemon tree with leaves that whisper in the wind - a space created in Harry’s world, just for Draco.
Something changes subtly in Stephen’s pleasant, handsome face. Harry feels a chill chase down his spine at that glimpse of steel.
Draco’s eyes search Harry’s face. ‘I recall you telling me that my magic was soothing to you,’ Draco says slowly. ‘I presume my magic is compatible with yours. Is that why it was the best choice?’
‘Ron tells me you’ve been getting hit with hexes and curses more often,’ Hermione frowns.
Harry leaves for Antwerp first thing in the morning. The wizarding quarter is hidden down an alley in the diamond district, a pocket universe tucked away in between the cobbled streets and dazzling buildings. He pulls his hair down over his scar and exchanges his gold-rimmed glasses for a pair of sunglasses, blending in easily with the crowd. He doesn’t have time for adoring fans today.
Harry hopes they end up in Scotland, though.

He lowers his snake carefully onto the desk, and the familiar rolls itself into a ball of maroon-and-white coils, tongue flicking out to scent the air as it regards Harry with tiny, beady eyes.
Kingsley responds with a grimace. ‘Merlin, I really do,’ he agrees.

Draco elbows Harry in the ribs. ‘It’s going to be fun,’ he says in Harry’s ear, low enough not to be overheard over the
When they were six, they used to play together in the Manor gardens, collecting flowers and peacock feathers to make bouquets for Astoria. Astoria was too small, too weak to be allowed outside, so Draco suggested they bring the outside to her. But that was before Lucius decided that flower-picking was unseemly for a Malfoy and forced Draco to take up potions and duelling instead. Any friendship that Draco might have formed with Daphne was extinguished quickly.
- Lucius is here, hiding in the walls of Narcissa’s lovely apartment, probably listening to their every word. Harry can’t keep coming back here without arousing suspicion, and probably putting Narcissa in danger. He might even be putting Draco in danger. He just needs a minute, just sixty seconds, and he’ll have the information he needs.
‘Oh, absolutely not,’ Ron says, pushing Harry back into the chair with a considerable amount of strength. ‘I’m going to Transfigure you a cot, and you are going to get at least two hours of sleep.’ He narrows his eyes. ‘Or.
The grate on the door slides open with a loud clatter of steel against fortified iron. Dark eyes appear through the narrow slit.
According to Molly’s infinite wisdom, the best way to ease the aftermath of the trial is by force-feeding everyone until they’re too full to think about bad things. She invites every last member of her family - spouses and children - and, in a fit of pure genius or blind insanity, Blaise and Pansy. (Narcissa and Andromeda have tickets to see a musical, otherwise Molly would have invited them too.)
Harry stares at her for a while, but as always, he cracks. ‘I don’t need to take a weekend bag,’ he sighs. ‘I’ve got stuff at his.’
Malfoy looks down at his arm. ‘It always hurts,’ he replies softly. ‘He cuts a piece of you open and sticks a curse there, makes it bind with your flesh and bone and soul. Some nights I can feel it worming its way into my blood, waiting for its master to yank on my leash.’
Malfoy tilts his head slightly as he studies Harry carefully. His eyes are so pale they might have no colour at all.  ‘You are?’
A Tempus tells him has just gone seven-thirty. He gets into the shower and cleans himself up, makes himself presentable, and then Floos to the Granger-Weasley residence.
Harry runs into him when he stops by Hermione’s office to invite her to lunch. He even sees Malfoy on the Tube when he finds the time in his hectic schedule to venture into Muggle London. He turns up for coffee with Luna to find Malfoy already sitting there, drinking his hot coffee with a straw and looking miserable about the whole affair, and Harry really hates seeing Malfoy this unhappy so he transfigures his coaster into a straw and drinks his latte with a straw too, which is admittedly disgusting but at least it makes Malfoy laugh so hard he snorts his coffee through his nose.
‘Ugh,’ says Harry with characteristic eloquence.
‘Is that a snake coiled around your thigh?’ Harry asks. He can feel a faint sizzling between his ears, like a steak pressed into a pan of butter.
Harry looks at Draco and hears the unspoken words -
-’ she points at Lucius ‘-somewhere where he can no longer hurt anyone.’
Harry grins broadly. ‘I’ll bring the wireless in here so you can listen to your programs while I cook, yeah?’
Michelle flashes Harry a winning smile. ‘Of course, Professor,’ she purrs. ‘Good luck in Paris.’
‘Oh, excellent,’ Draco says with a curt smile. ‘I’m so glad you’ve been paying attention.’
‘Pest control,’ replies Harry gleefully. ‘And Neville’s the same with his plants as Hagrid is with his animals.’
And suddenly it is done, and they are pressed together on the ballroom floor and there are people clapping, and the music is changing now, into something slow -
He’s probably breaking an inordinate number of rules, but he’s at his wits’ end, and honestly, it’s been a while since he could rely on the well-oiled machine of the Potter-Weasley partnership. Harry gets too close, a victim of tunnel vision and hyperfocus, while Ron’s always been good with looking at the bigger picture. He’s also learned a bunch of new tricks with his work at the shop.
‘I haven’t really had much practice,’ Harry shrugs. ‘There was always stuff going on that was more important.’
A girl made for a world he does not belong in.
‘Yeah,’ Harry says. ‘I can Apparate from Brussels to, er, maybe the opposite side of the Forbidden Forest, and that would be a pretty great way to stick it to the Ministry after the whole arrest shitshow, but it’s hardly ideal if I’ve got to be in the Great Hall before breakfast starts every morning, y’know?’
Kingsley climbs quickly to his feet, his expression is openly horrified as he takes in the restraints bracketing Harry’s arms. The man who was ranting angrily at the Minister of Magic turns on his heel, his features finally swimming into focus.
Harry opens the door to his suite and utters a low curse. Clearly, he’s going to have to have a conversation with hotel management about their security policy, because Daphne Greengrass is sitting on his hotel bed, looking very cross with him.
people’s awful, vindictive birds. He gives her three jellied mice as a reward, and then allows her to groom his mane of messy hair. He feels a strange twist in his gut as he watches her fly off into the night, and wonders if it’s in anticipation or dread.
Draco groans loudly and buries his face in Harry’s chest. ‘You are
‘I’ll eat your honey parsnips and carrots then,’ Draco says, leaning over to spoon the potatoes into Harry’s plate.
‘Why the hell does anyone read this?’ he says aloud, waving the book at Draco. ‘This is twisted stuff.’
, and Draco is more Draco than he ever was. He keeps his hair short these days -
He knows each secret corner of the city, each hidden alcove of the cathedral. He leads Harry down twisting alleyways into quiet little squares. He knows the local butcher by name and he has a favourite bakery -
‘Welcome to Lopez & Lopez,’ the man with the braids says in a velvety-smooth American accent, flashing Harry a pearly smile. ‘I’m Guy and this is my brother Angel.’
‘I don’t know,’ Draco says out loud. ‘You should run some tests to check.’
‘Pansy,’ says Draco, a tone of warning in his voice.
The apartment opens with a tap of Harry’s wand, and he waves the door shut behind him with his hand. The wards kick in and the apartment comes alive, spells activating as soon as Harry’s feet step over the threshold. The fireplace roars to life, and all the lights wink on. Harry sets his suitcase down by the door, hangs up his coat, and toes off his shoes, as he’s done in each of Draco’s homes countless times.
They reappear in an unfamiliar office with small, rounded windows overlooking a neat little garden. Kingsley sits in a comfortable-looking, high-backed chair behind a hardwood desk, listening quietly as the man in front of him unleashes a vicious tirade upon him. Another figure leans against the wall by the window, spinning his wand idly over his long fingers. The three of them freeze as soon as Harry and Proudfoot appear.
‘You know what I have to say about the matter,’ Draco hums. He tucks a loose strand of hair behind Harry’s ear, his fingertips brushing over the delicate spot there. ‘But you’re as stubborn as they come, and I’m not equipped to deal with that nasty saviour complex good old Albus instilled in you.’
Potter’s shirt is new, better fitted than his usual garb. It stretches over his broad shoulders, pulls against his torso. He has filled out over the years they spent apart - no longer skinny, knees no longer knobbly. His hair is wild as it falls over the silver-white cracks of the scar on his forehead. Outside, lightning forks across the purple-dark sky, mirroring the pattern perfectly. His eyes glow in the dim light of the energy-saving bulbs, and he grins wickedly at Draco as lightning flares again in the distance and thunder shakes foundations of the building.
‘Oh,’ says Neville, blinking. A frown flits briefly over his face, and then he rubs the back of his neck. ‘Right. Sorry. Let me know if you change your mind, though,’ he adds, managing another friendly smile before he leaves.
‘Time is a fickle sort of magic,’ Harry intercedes. ‘It would have been extremely difficult.’
Stephen nods distractedly, bringing his phone up to his ear as he ducks out of the study and into the hallway outside. As the door swings closed behind him, Draco can see the man’s shoulders draw into a tight line, as though bracing for impact. The yelling is audible even from the phone’s tiny speakers.
‘I’m sorry I took so long to find you,’ Harry whispers, and maybe what he really means is,
He moves out of the Manor as soon as his house arrest ends. The further he gets from that horrible, Dark-stained place, the lighter he feels - so he keeps on going, and going, until he finds himself a small, cheap apartment in Muggle London. He is not permitted to use magic until after parole, and yet the restriction is more a relief than a burden. He doesn’t fit very well in the Muggle world, but he adjusts rather quickly. The anonymity is freeing. He can rebuild. Reinvent. Become something different.
, Harry, the Dark Lord might have had my father send for me to come home from school, or he might have killed my mother to punish me and my father both, or something else equally horrible. That necklace wasn't meant for Katie, and that mead wasn't meant for Ron, but if I hadn't put even a half-hearted attempt out there, we might be dealing with something far worse here. Can you understand that? That I just didn't know what else to do?" His voice cracked and he looked away.

"After
He hadn't expected to find Diagon Alley so drastically changed, though he supposed he should have. Most of the familiar shops were boarded up or in the process of closing, and there was a distinct level of fear in each flashing set of eyes Draco passed on the street. There was a collective sadness, as if thoughts of Harry and all that his loss had entailed were ringing through the air unbidden, unspoken, but on everybody's mind on this day.
"You saved my life," Potter declares, shaking his head slowly from side to side as if he cannot possibly comprehend my ignorance in the matter. I feel faint. I feel as if the world has turned upside down since Potter entered my house. I
"Oh, sorry. But they were
Of course, he didn't see Harry at first. All he saw was Hagrid some several blocks away but getting closer with each passing second.
Harry actually
His feet took him to the seventh floor corridor automatically. He used only the least popular corridors, and he knew which creaky steps needed avoiding. He also had several stopping places along his route where he could hide and listen for the sound of footsteps. All seemed clear on this night, most likely because the majority of the school was in the Great Hall for dinner.
"Come on, dear… step up onto the footstool next to Mr. Malfoy, and I'll be right with you." Madam Malkin retreated through a door, presumably to fetch more robe cloth.
Draco took his wand from his pocket and turned to face her.
Lucius sighed, shutting his eyes for a moment. "Draco. Did you have something you wanted to talk to me about?"
"Nobody else has my name," Little Draco assured him, growing slightly impatient. "What did you just do? Who are you?"
Malfoy glances at him. ‘That is your given name, is it not?’
Harry made sure to give Draco the best guest room, the one with the best light for growing plants, the one that overlooks the garden at the back of Grimmauld Place, the one he designed specifically for Draco - but a beautiful room cannot keep away nightmares. Harry looks down at the blank piece of parchment before him, and then looks up at Draco, and makes a decision.
Apparently Malfoy wrote Arthur a letter too, containing a clipping of a Muggle newspaper advertising a motor show.
As they come to shackle his wrists and take him away, Lucius looks up into the stalls and meets Harry’s eye. A leisurely smile sprawls over his face.
‘You can get angry at her, you know,’ Draco says, breaking the comfortable silence. ‘That’s normal.’

Harry blinks. ‘I haven’t got time, Gin,’ he says confusedly, turning to face his girlfriend properly. ‘I’m crammed with cases until Christmas.’
Harry presses his hand into the damp stone as he looks down through the narrow rectangle of his prison cell window.  There is a storm approaching on the grey horizon - a behemoth of dark, rolling clouds and purple thunder. The ocean throbs with the force of its fury. Showers of briny spray cascade into the air as the dark water crashes against the sharp rocks of the island.
‘You had no choice,’ Harry says firmly.
Blaise’s voice sounds in Harry’s ears - a warning perhaps, if he knows what Harry is about to do, knows what this will mean for the laws of magic and the rules of their universe, but Harry never hears the rest of it.
‘You need a way to pick the lock,’ George says. He slaps the manual against his palm. ‘We already know all the spells that won’t work on the Panic Room. We just have to find the right combination of spells that
lives on Harry’s lips, but it isn’t fine, it’s so very far from being fucking fine.
Harry pulls away so he can study Draco’s face. ‘Yeah?’ he asks. ‘You’re sure?’
Ginny’s nose wrinkles as she looks up at him. ‘But I thought - well Ron’s quitting.’
Draco braces himself on the sink, his hands bracketing Harry’s thighs. ‘Really?’ he smirks. ‘I’ve had remarkable success so far.’
‘Oh. Merlin. No.’
Hermione lurches forward, her face a mask of steely fury and her fist clenched in a tight ball, but before she can take a swing, Ron grabs her by the arm quickly and hauls her back out of range.
‘Alright,’ he says, admitting defeat.
He manages to say a polite goodbye to Narcissa and thank her for hosting them, keeping his face a mask of calm until she finally shuts the door - and then Harry flees down the staircase and bursts out of the apartment building and into the heavy heat of the outdoors. He makes it three paces before he’s violently sick in the bushes.
But it is still difficult to return to a world with
‘Hello,’ Draco says, glancing over his shoulder.
Harry stands outside the shuttered house and stares at the chimney, the letterbox, the small stone path that curves up to the door, and he tries not to listen to the sound of his heart breaking for the

‘Actually, Nev,’ Harry says, scratching the back of his neck. ‘I need some advice. Relationship advice.’
‘I’m sorry to hear that,’ he says solemnly.
promises she’ll go home and sleep.
Harry shifts uncomfortably. ‘About that,’ he frowns. ‘Have you seen Draco recently?’
His voice has an unpleasant, reedy tone to it that sets Harry’s teeth on edge. ‘Did you not treat Mr. Malfoy’s victims?’
Harry Apparates to Cornwall in time to prevent the Aurors from heading to Draco’s house to tear that apart as well. They have no warrant, no paperwork, nothing to authorize them - nothing but a single anonymous letter with garbled, nonsensical accusations.
Boy and Boy live happily ever after.
"If you don't fuck me right now, I will not go out to dinner with you," I warn, lifting my hips to try to find him again. Harry grins, reaching a hand down to position himself. When he's properly lined up, he grabs my hands in his, pulling them up to either side of my head. He leans down to kiss me and a second later I feel the head of his cock enter me.
"Stop, stop... need you in me, Harry," I mutter, hoping he is able to stop on his own because there is no way I can bring myself to physically stop him, not when I'm this close and not with that glorious mouth around me. I'm so close I'm trembling, my hands gripping his hair are shaking.
"I love you," Harry said in the same calm, quiet voice he had used when first addressing Draco that day.
Once he was inside the small lavatory, he locked the door and splashed some cold water on his face before taking Harry's folded Invisibility Cloak out from inside of his robes.
The first time their erections met through the fabric of their trousers was a complete accident. Harry had been pulling Draco up to rest his head against the pillows, and he had lowered himself back down again at precisely the right angle. Draco let out a quick gasp, and Harry froze, suspended in the air above Draco. After a moment, he moved his hips slightly, experimentally, and both of them groaned into each other's necks.
Little Draco thought about it for about two more seconds before nodding his consent. As they crossed the street together, Draco wondered how he could have possibly missed out on the no-talking-to-strangers lecture. He was unsure how he had even made it to the ripe old age of nineteen if he had been going off with the first stranger who offered to buy him an ice cream as a kid, but he had never been gladder to have any character flaw in his life.
The kiss was unlike the first experimental ones they had shared, and also unlike the emotion-driven kisses on the day Draco had since termed 'The End of Everything.' This kiss felt like it had been building ever since the moment Harry had run away from him. Though Draco hadn't consciously let himself wish for it or imagine he might have it, this had been all he wanted for a month and a half. The tension they had left in the little room with the biscuits would have continued building inside of Draco until the day it finally broke him. Draco, with his arms full of Harry Potter, was intensely grateful he would never end up knowing what that day felt like.
The boy looked unsure for a moment, but then his eyes widened and he looked out the window briefly. "Do you mean Hagrid?"
Then Draco saw his mother, and his heart stopped. He abruptly stopped laughing.
"I miss you, you know," Harry said quietly. "No one else makes fun of me with quite the same amount of decorum."
He felt Harry shift, then straighten and turn to look at him. "So, are you saying… what, you're coming?"
And you never
A quiet happiness seeped into him - a feeling so deep he didn't know what to do with it beyond kissing Harry harder, trying to make him understand without words. He felt himself being turned and led backwards, and he smiled against Harry's lips when the back of his knees met the edge of the bed. It didn't take much persuasion from Harry for him to fall backwards, and he pulled Harry down right along with him. Then he was lying there, Harry a pleasant weight on top of him, and the happiness seeped into him more deeply, filling out all the little crevices that made him up.
Draco sighed, letting his head fall onto Harry's shoulder. "I know. I am too."
I'm not offended at all. I'm up on my feet suddenly, laughing quite obnoxiously and I'm sure Harry's confused. He stands too, facing me without the table in between us. "Potter, you're still insane. But if you want to try to swing it on technicalities, I guess I'm not complaining."
His whole life he had heard about Harry Potter. Father always brought him up when he was making jokes, normally ones that weren't meant for Draco's understanding. Even though the jibes usually went right over his head at the dinner table, it was impossible for Draco to misinterpret the fact that Father really didn't like Harry Potter at all.
Draco stared open-mouthed for a moment before he could respond. "You're not joking?" Harry shook his head slowly, and Draco took a step back. "Out of all the things you could have said to me, 'I'm sorry' was the absolute last thing I would have guessed," Draco admitted, shaking his head. "You're well within your rights to hate me. No matter what you think, my plan still fucked up! And Dumbledore's dead, and it's my fault, Harry…"
He had set the idea inside his younger self's mind, but only now was the plan coming together. The ball was rolling, and as the past began to change, the future he knew was changing, too. He was disappearing.
"Not for a couple weeks or so, maybe more… I'm not sure yet. But you have to make a plan. Tell everyone you can, tell Dumbledore, whatever. Nothing is going to happen until I give my say so, and I will give you advance warning first, and enough time to get everybody out."
"Are you really him?" Draco whispered, unable to keep the incredulity out of his voice.
Draco looked around to be sure nobody would notice him appearing out of nowhere, but there wasn't anyone in his immediate vicinity. With a flourish, he removed the Invisibility Cloak and folded it carefully, placing it back inside his robe. Before entering the main street, he pulled his hood up, wincing at the memories the action sparked of the last time he had disguised himself this way.
Draco scoffed, pulling away. "
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Harry slowly stroked Draco's back. "If you were to come live with me, it might be sooner than you'd expect."
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
~*~*~
The timing had to be absolutely perfect, because part of him selfishly needed to see Harry again.
"I won't let him kill Mother and Father," Little Draco sniffed.
"Hermione's had a theory about us since Fourth Year, apparently," Harry said flippantly as Draco rolled his eyes. "Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction, too."
"Your father will be by to fetch you after he's done in Flourish and Blott's. You'll be lucky if he doesn't decide to send you to bed without supper," Narcissa warned.
Draco's hands moved to slide Harry's robes from his shoulders, and Harry sat up, straddling him as he threw his robes to the floor. Draco reached out, feeling his way slowly up Harry's chest before he began unbuttoning Harry's shirt. Harry was smiling down at him, and Draco found himself blushing - though at the same time, he was so hard that it took a lot of concentration not to rip Harry's shirt off him instead.
"I want to go!" Draco sat up, crossing his arms over his chest. "How could you even say that? Of course I want to go."
"You're insane!" I'm shaking my head now, too. "Potter, I did the least possible I could have done in order to help you. I didn't even know if I wanted to help you. I was confused, I was a mess. How can you even say that I... because
Thank Merlin for the Golden Boy. How many times would I have died by now if not for him? I wish this question didn't go through my head as often as it does. All the implications of it and how much I owe Potter and how much I can't possibly pay back. There's precious little I could do that he might appreciate, now. Definitely nothing that he would benefit from. Can you imagine a Squib saving the life of an Auror?
"Happy birthday," Harry whispered. A moment later, almost in slow motion, Harry's arm moved to lay across his chest. Draco would have told himself Harry had done it in his sleep, only he had just spoken out loud. He found himself frozen solid, the idea of moving or speaking so foreign that all he could do was lay there, trying to comprehend the warmth encompassing him.
"Yes," Draco concluded, barely able to control his outrage. "Yes, I can clearly see how it is that you trust me! Really, very obvious. Wonderful demonstrations of trust!"
After stumbling out one of the side doors and managing to find the small break in the hedges around the Manor property that he had dug out as a child, he Apparated just south of Little Whinging.
Slytherin
A few moments later, Draco had the Invisibility Cloak wrapped around himself again, and he was crossing the street to wait once more at the mouth of the alley next to the robe shop. He knew that his younger self was already inside and right on time. He had talked to Little Draco for about as long as it would have taken him to look around in the Quality Quidditch Supplies shop.
"No, I'm not, actually," Harry began, his voice rising. "No one knows where Ron, Hermione, or I are staying, and if you just came back with me, you could be safe there, too! With me!"
He closed his eyes, sighing in both relief and frustration as he found the courage to face Harry. Finding himself facing Harry's chest and not Harry's eyes, Draco found it within himself to place a tentative hand on Harry's waist.
"Yeah," the boy admitted, staring down at his feet.
Draco shifted. "I'm almost out of Aconite and Hellebore, and I'll need them before next week. Do you think it would be all right if I went to Diagon Alley tomorrow?"
Will you think that you're all alone
Draco blinked and then shut his eyes, wishing a hole would open up in the floor to swallow him up. In truth, he had wondered constantly why Harry hadn't asked him about those incidents sooner. What could he say? What could he possibly say, without giving everything away, that would make what had happened to Katie and Ron seem even remotely acceptable?
"Down here," Draco called. Harry's vision locked onto his, and his eyes widened in surprise. He threw the window open the rest of the way and stuck his head out.
As soon as we arrive, I kick off my boxers and Harry removes his, too. He is staring at my bed hangings and duvet, which are both black. "Where are all the snakes?" he asks.
Draco opened his lips slightly, heart pounding, hoping it might help. All it did was give Harry the idea that more pressure was a good idea. Draco's head was being crushed into the V in the corner of the walls, and it sort of hurt. He put his till-then limp arms around Harry's waist and pulled his body closer, at the same time pushing Harry's head back with his face, pressing against Harry's lips with his own, until it became a sort of battle of lips.
"I would really have liked to stop at the Quidditch shop," the younger version of himself spoke, crossing his arms. Draco's eyes nearly popped out of his head as he listened to himself whine in such a squeaky, petulant little voice.
Draco Malfoy was bored, and his arms were going numb. Still, he held them out for as long as Madam Malkin fiddled with the sleeves of his new Hogwarts robes.
"I'm fine. It's just really difficult to understand... well, that is to say... Potter, just
"No."
"Neosporin," Harry answered, balancing Draco's arm on his knee so both hands were free to twist off the cap. "It's kind of like a healing potion, but it's an ointment. It's not perfect, but it should help some of the pain and keep it from getting infected." He squirted a generous amount onto his finger as he spoke, then tucked one hand under Draco's elbow and gently began to apply it in short strokes.
Draco could feel protective wards encompassing him as he stepped into the room, and he sighed at the feeling of Harry's magical signature surging through him. Apparently, he had been approved, because the gentle circulation of magic inside him dissipated, and he was standing just inside a room that reminded him strangely of Hagrid's Hut. There were hardwood floors and wood-paneled walls, a tall dresser in the corner, and a large bed with a blue and white quilt.
But if you never knew the life behind those marks, you would also see the way he lives in his skin - the way he inclines his head, the way he smiles, bright and fresh like a January sunrise, the way his jokes are always biting but never hurtful, the way his gaze grows focused whenever he listens to someone, the way he always opens the door for little old ladies, the way he gets all soft and teary-eyed when he sees a kitten.
Harry takes a deep breath. ‘Just a precaution,’ he mutters to himself, and casts a Stasis charm on the apartment.
you? Why is he with you? Where are your parents?"
Draco understood. He really did. He wanted nothing more than the freedom to go with Harry to a safe place where they could be together and where he could help Harry defeat the Dark Lord. For the first time, Draco felt envious of the fact that Harry had no family to worry about. He would never tell Harry either of those things, however. The first would give him false hope, and the second would just be tactless and cruel.
Bellatrix stood abruptly, looking over Draco's shoulder. Draco felt his Mark burn.
my friend," the boy said, allowing himself a small smile. "And I've been Harry Potter my whole life."
Pausing for a moment, Draco pulled down his hood, watching his own gray eyes widen in surprise. "I just made sure we won't be interrupted or overheard. And I already told you my name. It's the same as yours."
Draco laughed shortly. "Thanks."
"Thank you, Bella." The voice trickled into his ears and through his mind like poison, and Draco felt his stomach turn.
He kisses me on the cheek before letting his softening cock slide out of me, and I sigh. He rolls off of me, but he pulls me around to face him. I place on hand on his cheek.
As soon as Harry stepped out into the hallway, Draco felt entrenched in the darkening room, afraid of the unseen corners of it. The dark came at him from all sides. If he hadn't been lying on top of Harry's firm mattress and old, worn comforter, he feared that he would no longer be solidly anchored to reality. He sat up slowly so as not to aggravate the skin on his left forearm until he could lean his head against Harry's headboard.
"Draco?"
He unfolded the cloth, running his hands reverently across the smooth, silken surface. With a sick jolt, he recognized Harry's scent caught in the cloak's folds, and he buried his face in it for a long while before straightening and wrapping the cloak around himself. He had been under it with Harry several times over the years, but never alone.
He wished the Dark Lord could see him now. See Harry Potter himself touching the Mark, unafraid and unabashedly touching
"Thanks," Draco said, trying his hardest to sound appalled.
Harry shyly removed one hand from the depths of his pockets, and offered it to Draco to shake.
"Fine!" Draco heard himself exclaim, glaring up at Narcissa defiantly. He remembered the look of barely contained fury on his mother's face well.
It had been quite a shock to find the cloak caught up in the sleeves of his own robes after he had returned home the hellish day Harry had died. Draco imagined it had fallen out of Harry's robes when he'd thrown them to the floor, and then caught on the bag of potions ingredients Draco had had inside of his own robes. Upset, Draco had buried the cloak at the bottom of a drawer. This was the first time he had removed it since.
I look down, watching him suck me off. His eyes are shut and his face his flushed, and his jaw is stretched impossibly wide each time he takes me back into his mouth. I am shaking above him, struggling not to come right then and there, and I am not sure if it's the fact that I haven't had a proper blow job in several months or if it's that Harry Potter is giving me the best blow job of my life. Harry is kneeling and his own cock is sticking out of the hole in his boxers, hard and red and jolting forward every couple of seconds. I want to reach down at touch him again, skin to skin, but it's then that Harry's finger enters me for the first time.
‘What?’ Harry splutters. ‘I’m not- I dated other people, you know- how did you- how do you know?’
‘Pansy,’ he sighs, ‘I’m working.’
‘Not exactly,’ Harry says. He withdraws his hand from Draco’s grasp and leans forwards in his seat. ‘They could certainly make the time turner move back in time,’ he explains, ‘but it would be incredibly difficult to fit all the possibilities within that time into a normal Time-Turner. Like fitting an ocean in a thimble - you can dip the thimble in the ocean, but you’re only going to get the specific portion of the ocean that is sitting in that thimble.’
Maybe he’s a coward, but it’s not the right time - it’s not, not here in this hospital room, with its bleached blankets and the monitoring spells hovering over Draco. The words sit beneath his tongue like thorns, but behind his ribs, his love is a rose garden choking his lungs, blooming over his heart.
‘You captured Rowle after six days’ pursuit,’ the Unspeakable replies, as though that’s a suitable explanation. ‘Surely two weeks is ample time to conduct an investigation.’
He already knows he’s going to say yes. How could he not? It’s the perfect job. He’ll be going back home, to the one place that never asked him to be anything but himself. He will finally be doing something useful with his abilities, nurturing instead of tearing things down, helping instead of harming.
‘Three travel-sized bottles of Dittany please,’ Harry says. ‘Oh, and I won’t need a bag.’
Harry can see the headlines already:
Draco pulls Harry’s hand into his own, turning it over in his lap until Harry’s palm faces the ceiling. The ring catches the full warmth of the fire, turning brilliant amber. Draco’s fingertips trace the cool metal, then they dance up over the raised callouses within the cup of Harry’s palm, up further, until the pads of his fingers rest delicately over the overlapping spheres of Harry’s tattoos. Draco tilts his face up to meet Harry’s.
It isn’t all bad, of course.
No, that’s not enough.
,’ commands Blaise, his perfect teeth bared in a snarl.
Instead, he turns towards the Unspeakable. ‘You’re not giving me a choice, are you?’ he asks wearily.
- and various charms dangle along the windowpane, glinting and sparkling slightly. Harry recognizes them as the ones Luna sends Draco each time he moves into a new place.
allow on his person under ordinary circumstances). ‘I want to be here,’ he says.
Two Aurors step forward, reaching out to separate Harry from Draco’s grasp. Harry shakes his head at Draco silently as he tries to resist.
Bellatrix nodded, eyes wide. "Oh, yes. The Mudbloods would see your hair, boy, and it would be a fatal crime to expose yourself like that."
The scene was arranged perfectly, down to the lighting the afternoon sun provided. Madam Malkin disappeared quickly and then it was just the two of them. Oh, he remembered this…
Harry exhaled slowly through his nose. "During Slughorn's party, I sort of… I overheard you and Snape." Draco's mouth fell open. "I know he really wanted to help you with whatever you do in here, but you wouldn't let him."
Taking a deep breath, he turned the hourglass six times.
Draco didn't answer right away. Instead he lay there on his back with one arm around Harry and the other behind his head, trying not to squirm under the weight of the question. Harry's fingers on his skin became still after a few moments, and Draco sighed. "I think on some level, you've always been the most important person in my life."
"You're in the presence of the Dark Lord, boy. Stand up, you stupid blubbering baby!" Bellatrix kicked him hard in the stomach, and Draco grunted, rolling into a fetal position. "You sorry excuse for a Black descendant!" Bellatrix roared.
On the day his father had forcibly removed him from his bed and shoved him roughly into the shower, he knew that he could no longer get away with lying there and letting the world go by without him. His father told him that the Dark Lord had requested his presence at all meetings from that point on, and so Draco had gone.
Even before making the final turn, night and day had begun to spin around him so quickly that the sky was a blur. People weren't people but beams of colored light racing past him like horizontal lightning. Terrified, Draco fell back against the wall, wrapping his arms around himself. In less than a minute, six years had reversed in front of his eyes, and he was suddenly blinded by the sunlight of the same day, six years past.
There are more people around them now, drawn by the commotion. Astoria pushes her way to the front, dragging both Daphne and her newly-minted husband with her. She looks perfectly ready to commit multiple counts of homicide at her own wedding.
‘Ah, wonderful,’ she says, lifting the bottle out of Harry’s grasp. ‘Shall we have a glass?’
Draco hurries out after him and he grabs Harry by the forearm. ‘
Harry makes a small, pained sound at the back of his throat. ‘You can’t flirt your way out of everything, Draco,’ he grumbles.
They make it to the kitchen just as Hermione starts using her courtroom voice - ‘Blaise
He stands by the little iron gate and watches the loveliness of the light coming from the windows spilling out over the bushes of lavender that grow in the small garden. The stone path curves slightly as it leads from the gate to the front door, and Harry’s boots click over the wet tiles as he walks through the garden. Tomorrow morning, the bushes of honeysuckle and wood anemone will come alive with bees and butterflies. For now, the garden is silent. The perfume of wildflowers drifts gently over Harry as he climbs the three steps up to Draco’s front door. The doorknob is shaped like a starburst, the metal cold to the touch.
Even then,
‘Merlin, Prentis,’ Harry sighs. ‘Must you be such an obstinate wanker?’
Harry can’t seem to find Malfoy anywhere, after the trials. He’s nowhere and everywhere at once, and it’s infuriating, because all Harry wants to do is return Malfoy’s wand.
‘No, no, no,’ Harry moans. ‘Draco,
the way magic-wielders of the West do, and while do not they care much for the rules of aristocracy and lineage that Wizarding Britain is so obsessed with, they still own the entire import industry for potions ingredients. One word from Stephen, and the Lius could put the economy of Wizarding Britain in a chokehold.
But he still hasn’t caught anything yet. Not even a whisper of a spell.
with it.
A familiar weight presses against the small of Harry’s back. ‘Come on,’ murmurs Draco, just beside Harry’s right ear. ‘Blaise will take care of the rest. Let’s go home.’
Harry knows better than to argue. He plucks the token from Daphne’s fingers, promising her that he’ll get cleaned up and get some rest if
Draco’s hand pulls free of Harry’s, and he cups Harry’s face with a tenderness that threatens to destroy Harry.
‘We just need to know if you know where he’s gone,’ Proudfoot interrupts, drawing Harry’s attention back towards him. He looks apologetic, which Harry supposes counts for something.
Harry helps Draco outside, sitting him down on a bench. He can’t even begin to imagine what that must feel like - to have your suffering picked apart and displayed like an artefact in a museum. He pulls a thin chocolate bar out of the pocket of his robes and breaks off a small piece, offering it to Draco. It’s a meagre measure of comfort, but it is what he can do here, with all these eyes on them and all those reporters with their cameras and their quills.
Draco turns his cheek so that it rests against Harry’s arm. His eyes are aglow with their own light, slivers of captured moonlight to appease the sky for the waxing of the moon. ‘I’m just surprised by the fact that, out of the two of us,’ Draco says, gesturing between their bodies with his hand, ‘
Harry knows they have his address on file next to
‘Circe’s tits, Potter,’ she frowns. ‘Don’t you get hangovers?’
‘I worked as slowly as possible,’ Draco continues. His smile is a wry twist of the lips. ‘My father is talented when it comes to manipulation and petty politics, but he is rather lacking in magical knowledge. I was able to sabotage myself plenty of times.’
‘Harry,’ he says, barely above a whisper.
And he reads the letter again.
Harry nearly coughs up his latte.
Hermione glances at Ron, who shrugs. Since the battle of Hogwarts, they’ve more or less stopped considering Malfoy a threat. All three of them had witnessed the way Malfoy flung himself at Crabbe in an attempt to stop the fiendfyre. And they’d all seen the way he broke down at the sight of Harry’s limp body in Hagrid’s arms, the way he refused to stand with the other Death Eaters. And none of them would ever forget what he did for them in Malfoy Manor.
‘Evening, boys,’ Stephen greets, nodding at each of them. He brandishes a thick, plastic binder. ‘I dug up the documents you asked about.’
Neville nods thoughtfully. ‘That sounds like a treat,’ he says. He takes another drink from his bottle and sets it on the ground next to his chair. He leans back fully, folding his arms loosely over his chest. ‘So, have you set a date for the wedding yet? I’ve got to calendar it into our schedule and make sure that Gin has the week off.’
They both turn, then, just in time to see Draco walking down from the tent, the twinkling lights of the party turning his white-blond hair silver. He’s got a bottle of champagne tucked under his arm and his waistcoat is unbuttoned and there is pink in his cheeks.
Blaise holds Draco’s gaze for a beat, then nods once. He marks something down in his notebook. ‘Right,’ he says, a crease appearing between his eyebrows. ‘Do you know whether Lucius was the one who facilitated the theft of the Time-Turner from the Department of Mysteries?’
Smythe’s grin is sickeningly smug. ‘Oh, but we
you, do you truly
‘You’re good at
‘I almost miss the days where people were afraid to get me angry,’ Harry tells her.
Harry’s not even surprised when Neville finally asks Harry to be his best man.
Draco hums in agreement, patting Harry’s shoulder. ‘I suppose we were going to have to talk to him eventually about this,’ he reasons, sounding not even half as panicked as Harry is feeling right now. ‘No time like the present.’
He’s developed a bit of a taste for martinis, now that he’s allowed to drink again. It suits him ridiculously well, of course. He’s started wearing clothing with buttons again, and now it’s all crisp shirts with the top two buttons undone, and pressed trousers and sometimes he’ll throw on a shirt-cardigan combo that nearly knocks Harry right the fuck over because,
‘I couldn’t ask that of you,’ he tells her. ‘I wouldn’t ask that of anyone.’
It had been extremely embarrassing for the Ministry, considering their history of arresting famous professors. and Harry had let them go with a warning and a promise to take the tracking spells off of his wand.
‘Lovely,’ she repeats, nodding. She unclips the patient chart from Draco’s bed and squints at it, pushing her spectacles even closer to her eyes.
Draco looks like he’s about to burst into laughter. While he has not personally experienced state-school approved curriculum, his brief sojourn in the Muggle world means he’s worked with plenty of unfortunate souls who can recite ‘
, Potter explained, as casually as though he were reciting the colour of his bedroom walls.
‘It’s just,’ Harry sighs, rubbing the back of his neck tiredly, ‘things were just so shit for him in England. And I was so wrapped up in my own issues that I never really noticed - or rather, I didn’t do anything about it even if I
‘I know,’ Harry replies miserably. ‘But the place I like in Hogsmeade closed last year.’
Blaise rubs his hand over his face tiredly. It looks like he hasn’t slept either, but there’s a lack of bruises and lipstick-marks on his body that suggests it’s not a lover that’s been keeping him up.
Everything seems more saturated, somehow. Harry feels as though he has fallen into a pocket world of sweet moonlight. He can feel everything and yet, somehow, the only thing he can feel is
Malfoy smiles a strange, sad little smile. ‘You know I can’t,’ he replies quietly. ‘But for you, Potter, just for you, I’ll stay alive.’
Malfoy tells him about his cat, Artemis, that he picked up at a Muggle animal shelter. He’s got pictures in his wallet, and he shows each of the tiny polaroids to Harry with a look of paternal pride that makes Harry laugh so hard he nearly cries. (Artemis is a very beautiful cat, of course.)
‘You wanted to try the eggs benedict at that place - the brunch we were supposed to go to,’ Harry explains, nodding at the near-perfect eggs benedict on the plate. There is also smoked salmon, and kippers, and bagels spread with cream cheese, and strawberries with the stems cut off. ‘I looked up the recipe a while ago. Pretty hard to make eggs benedict, as it turns out,’ he adds, chuckling.
The theme park scene is a bit jumpy, ugh, I’m sorry. (Are Teddy and Victoire an item? Or is it just disaster bi solidarity? WHO KNOWS. Harry definitely doesn’t.)
,’ Blaise grits out, and he is properly, truly furious. ‘A real champion of integrity, that one.’
Harry shakes his head in response to Neville’s question. His now-empty bottle is still collecting moisture on the low table sat between their respective chairs, and he is already pleasantly buzzed from the sugar and low alcohol content. He lifts his feet up and crosses his legs, finding a more comfortable position on the padded seat.
Draco clears his throat. ‘You don’t have to-’
‘This is going to end badly’ Harry sighs.
all the patterns. Otherwise it’s kind of like sitting on a bus and only being allowed to get off on a predetermined station.’
‘Not this time,’ Harry says with a shrug.
‘We made a room that fits in a wizarding home of any size,’ Guy explains. ‘They’re impervious to hexes and curses, and we can set it up to provide as much food and water as our client needs. We usually make them undetectable too.’
He bites his lip and remembers Luna telling him a very long time ago,
Draco’s smile slips off his face, but he steps towards Harry, and in his face, Harry can see all his love, as vast and inconceivable as the number of stars that glitter in the sky. ‘I want forever,’ he whispers.
Harry nods in understanding.
not the Chosen One, saviour of the wizarding world, defeater of the Dark Lord himself.’ She reaches forward and takes his hand, squeezing it slightly. Her palms are soft, and her grip is strong. ‘And, unlike a certain buffoon I am inordinately fond of, I was never considered the best tracker in the DMLE.’
Harry tries to fight against the knee-jerk defensiveness. They’ve had this conversation before, about Lucius, about Narcissa. About Sirius, and Snape. About Dumbledore.
Draco hums. ‘Promises, promises.’
‘I think you could probably be a little kinder to yourself,’ Neville says. ‘You saved the world, Harry. Not just twice, by the way, because there’s first year, and then second year, and then fourth year, and then fifth year you taught us all how to protect ourselves against Death Eaters. Can you imagine any of our fifth-year students doing that? Training an army?’
Ice rushes through Harry’s veins.
Harry lets his lips curve upwards into a smile. He has received no trial, but they have all informed him that his sentence has already been decided. He is in here for life - unless he agrees to their terms.
‘I’m sorry,’ he tells her. ‘I’m sorry. I have to go.’ He steps away, already pulling his wand from its holster. ‘I have to go back and start working on getting him out of there.’
over it with a brush of his fingers and a whisper of his bottomless magic.
‘Aw, congrats,’ says Harry. He recalls the Ravenclaw Beater from last year’s House Cup. He’s never seen anyone get so damn inventive with a Bludger. If Ginny’s team have managed to sign on Hilda Spindle, he pities the poor souls unfortunate enough to play against the Harpies.
‘Teddy!’ Draco gasps, throwing his hands over his chest as though he isn’t clothed in perfectly acceptable pyjamas.
After Harry’s last day as an Auror, his friends throw a surprise party at Grimmauld Place. They hit him with a shower of confetti as he enters through the door and he nearly hexes their faces off for it. There’s cake and takeaway (much to Kreacher’s disapproval) and there are ugly paper streamers hanging off every surface. Luna makes something that she claims is salad, only, no salad should be
Draco spins Hermione around with a clever flick of the wrist, and she ducks under his arm, breathless from joyous laughter.
Harry doesn’t kiss Draco, not once. He’s afraid of that dam breaking and of the flood of his love and desire and the decade of
Harry looks down at where Draco is gripping his hands tightly, and thinks about chocolate, and the strange kindness of simple gifts, and the heavy fog of his mind clears. ‘Remus,’ he says. ‘Remus was good. Remus was the best of them.’
Draco laughs so hard throughout Harry’s awkward fumbling that he nearly spills his drink down his shirt.
‘I want this,’ he says. ‘Every Christmas. For the rest of my life.’ He sighs, and his breath curls in visible plumes of moisture against the icy air. ‘Promise me we’ll spend them all together, until I’m old and decrepit, and you have to carry me everywhere with your big, strong arms.’
Draco breathes a soft sigh, and he leans further back into the grass, tilting his face skyward. ‘Before that point,’ he says, ‘I was doing rather well at ignoring feelings, you see, but then I saw you standing by that field, and you were hurting, and because you were hurting, I was hurting too, and I forgot the things I had sworn I would never do. Do you understand what I’m saying?’ he asks, glancing at Harry.
Harry’s never seen Hermione work a room like this before - showing rather than telling, leaving no room to question the narrative. It’s a cold, detached thing, to lay your friend’s suffering out like this for everyone to see, but it
Harry nods silently in reply.
Harry shakes his head, grinning. ‘You know I’m rubbish at dancing.’
Harry wants a lot of things. But he’s not had a great track record at getting any of the things he wants, and standing here in Draco’s kitchen, he thinks he has more than he deserves. So, he holds his love in his chest and smiles wordlessly at Draco. He doesn’t need a forever, when they have a

‘Of course,’ Harry smiles. ‘Oh, don’t touch that. It’s got a bat bogey hex on it.’
Ron gives his sister a
This is not a Ginny-bashing fic - Ginny is a badass and generally a good-time gal and also is Worried about Harry because 50% of this fic is people worrying about Harry and then 50% is a 'Where's Draco mystery'.
‘Probably am,’ Harry says with a shrug. ‘Horcrux privileges, right?’
It makes him powerful - but it makes him vulnerable too.
In a way, Harry’s not different from the Room of Hidden Things. If there was ever anything great about Harry, it’s long since been lost in the fire.
Malfoy glances at the fence, at the glowing red handprints on the metal that are only just starting to cool. He looks up again at Harry, his expression unreadable, before he waves his wand at the fence, erasing the handprints entirely. He vaults gracefully over the fence and into the field on the other side - more gracefully than Harry’s ever seen him do anything - and takes a few steps into the field before sitting down in the tall grass. After a moment, Harry climbs over the fence and sits with him.
‘Why must you always assume I’m to blame?’ Harry groans.
‘Bloody hell, mate,’ Ron whistles, long and low. ‘You should’ve seen it. Snape’s got nothing on Blaise when he’s proper ticked off. Blaise starts listing off every single case of improper conduct Proudfoot has been involved with, every grey-ish spell he’s cast, every single dodgy associate, every time he’s looked the other way when someone powerful’s done something illegal. I might’ve felt a bit sorry for the poor bastard, if he wasn’t genuinely an incompetent sod.’
- and slashes an arc through the air. The curse hits Draco across his abdomen.
Harry clicks his tongue in sympathy. Ginny’s a good sport, but she’s taken her losses rather heavily since she was promoted to team captain.
‘We both know that’s a lie,’ Draco says with surprising calm. ‘You were a bully and you were cruel to those who deserved kindness, but you were never one of us. You do not bear the Mark. You never swore allegiance. Your wand will never hold traces of the spells that mine did.’
. Isn’t

Lopez & Lopez Secure Solutions is located in an old brick house that looks to have been someone’s home once, up a flight of narrow stairs winding up the side of the building. A menagerie of owls perch on the metal railing. Yellow, amber, and blue eyes watch Harry as he climbs the stairs and pushes open the door to the office.

notice. And he was always so perfect with me. And I wanted- I want to be perfect for him.’
Harry takes the booklet from Guy and flips quickly through its laminated pages.
‘I suppose there’s nothing quite like the thrill of being able to sexualise something taboo,’ Luna remarks thoughtfully, ‘morally illiterate as that might be.’
‘He writes me lovely letters though,’ Andromeda adds thoughtfully. ‘You know, he reminds of Regulus, sometimes. Poor, sweet boys.’ She coaxes Teddy off of Harry and holds him hostage in the crook of her arm, gently batting away his tiny, grabbing hands. ‘Would you like to see one?’
Draco arches an eyebrow at Harry. ‘Now, I could be losing my memory in my old age,’ he says, ‘but didn’t you run a club in fifth year where you taught a bunch of incompetent children to duel Death Eaters? With surprising success, I might add.’
it begins,
Draco is the first person Harry sees when he wakes up, after the Diagon Incident. He doesn’t say something funny, or make fun of Harry’s full-body cast, or even insult his hair. He just looks at Harry with swollen, reddened eyes, and lets out a little sob. That’s when Harry knows it’s enough.
‘Or at least, it should be near impossible,’ Guy shrugs. ‘We’re not perfect.’
‘I have to make a call,’ Draco says suddenly, standing from his seat. ‘I have a hunch - but I want my lawyer to confirm it.’
The boy behind the bar knows Draco, so he gives them all doubles for the price of singles - except for Draco, who’s still on potions, and gets a Diet Coke instead. The bartender is cute, in a button-nosed, doe-eyed kind of way. Harry’s sort of come to the realisation that maybe he finds boys cute too, after a few confused moments in the trainee locker rooms and maybe three bizarre dreams about Oliver Wood, but when Draco’s friend passes Harry his number on a coaster with a wink, Harry has to politely tell him that he’s very much not single, but is flattered anyways.
Must I remind you that you’re still recovering from very extensive curse damage?’
‘Nerd,’ Harry replies, and ducks quickly as Neville spells the bottle cap at his head.
all of this, and what it all means, but he can’t run anymore, so now all his monsters have finally caught up with him.
, it whispers to him.
They do the dishes together afterwards, like they always do, standing side by side at the sink. Artemis winds himself around Draco’s bare ankles, attempting to purr and meow at the same time. Draco’s laughter is as light as eider-down, and he leans into Harry’s space as he places a dish on the drying rack. He smells like mint, lemon and cedarwood. Like books and wool and fresh laundry.
‘You’re here,’ says Draco. ‘I thought you’d be in Paris.’
If the Aurors are right - if Lucius somehow got to Draco -

In classic Pansy fashion, she makes them both a coffee-liquor latte, sits down at the kitchen table, toes off her stilettos, and props her stockinged feet on Harry’s lap.
‘Your what?’
St. Mungo’s staff showers are actually quite fancy - they’d put the Hogwarts prefects’ bathroom to shame. There’s a House Elf on standby wearing lime-green socks (presumably paid a living wage thanks to Hermione’s relentless creature welfare work in the earlier years of her career) who takes Harry’s blood-stained clothes without flinching, though perhaps she’s rather used to it. Healing is bloody work.

‘Anyways - to answer your question,’ Harry says. ‘A Time-Turner that’s modified to turn back weeks is made with the capacity to hold all the probabilities of the time that has to pass through it. But it would be extremely difficult to modify that Time-Turner further to allow it to process all the probabilities of a decade. You would need to replace almost all of the components of the device - and alter almost all of the spells.’
‘Ah, yes,’ Narcissa says, setting down her glass. ‘Then you have not seen the redecorations. Please,’ she says, rising to her feet in one graceful, liquid motion. ‘I must show you how lovely they are. Draco chose them, you see. He has such excellent taste.’
Harry’s eyes follow his movements, and the smile turns sweet. Fond. ‘Would you like some mocha and breakfast in bed?’ he asks.
Malfoy smiles crookedly. ‘One would presume so,’ he replies. His voice is soft, his accent polishing each word. ‘Though I might find it a little hard to believe you’ve suddenly turned into a magical genius overnight simply because you’re less distracted by the constant threat to life and limb, seeing as being under constant threat is sort of your occupation these days. But, well.

‘Babe, your plant-based food is amazing,’ Ginny says, giving Neville’s arm a mollifying pat. ‘It’s Soho that I don’t trust. Harry, we’re doing Taco Tuesday, if you want to stay for dinner?’

Ron turns around to look at Harry bemusedly. ‘Didn’t you have a problem last time getting him on the team?’
, dressed in a sleek black dress and stockings, her bob so sharp it looks like it might actually cut someone, in a pair of heels that look painful to walk in, but somehow it works next to Luna’s buttercup-yellow pantsuit.
‘We had to fish her out.’
‘Busy doing what, exactly?’ Ron asks, frowning deeply and folding his arms over his chest.

my friends.’
. I’m lucky if Ginny sends me a letter once a month. Honestly, Ginny and I have a betting pool running in our friend groups about when you two will have a spring or winter wedding. My money’s on winter, by the way,’ he adds, ‘because you're an absolute doormat when it comes to Malfoy, and according to Gran the Malfoys love a winter wedding.’
‘Fuck,’ Harry says to the empty apartment. ‘He
‘Are there almonds in there, Filius?’ calls Professor Singh from further along the table. She’s been teaching Ancient Runes since the beginning of the year. Harry thinks he’d like her, if only she weren’t so damn American. She refers to everyone by their first name, except Harry, who she insists on calling
Harry buries his head in his hands. ‘Oh,
‘- but you’ve turned out just fine,’ Hagrid continues, dabbing at his eyes with a lace-edged handkerchief. ‘Just fine. You’ve done a good job caring for him and protecting him when he deserves protecting, and I can tell you love him just as much as I do. Ain’t a lot of people in Harry’s life I would trust, but I would trust you.’
Harry’s gaze drifts away from his guests, outwards to the edge of the table where the light is dimmest - and there he spots Blaise and Charlie sitting together beneath the branches of a young lemon tree. Blaise’s hand is curled within Charlie’s palm, his face soft and unguarded and his eyes wide and almost fearful, even as Charlie reaches up to cup his free hand around the back of Blaise’s neck.

In the kitchen, there is water in the kettle, and the tin of earl grey is half-empty. The cupboards are still full of food. A bouquet of dried lavender and feather grass leans in a tall, green bottle on the dining table, and a stack of letters are placed neatly at its side.
‘You could’ve owled,’ he tells Neville, as the taller man sweeps Harry into a bone-crushing hug.
Blaise sighs resignedly, seeming to give up on his Saturday lie-in, and drops into a cross-legged position in front of his fireplace. ‘Alright,’ he says. ‘What did you find?’
Harry thinks it’s all positively hilarious.
Draco sighs softly, his breath tickling Harry’s skin. ‘Because,’ he says, ‘if I call you by your name, I’ll be forced to have feelings, and I’m rather enjoying this vapid, unemotional level of drunkenness.’
She spends the first half of the night sitting on Malfoy’s lap, sipping from a bottle of vodka and whispering in his ear. Malfoy’s still on curse-damage potions, but he’s been given a potion that supposedly imitates the effects of being pleasantly tipsy, and it seems to be working, because every time he catches Harry’s eye across the room he bursts into a fit of giggles. Hermione’s off the booze and potions so she’s attacking the satsumas with great ferocity. Ron’s sprawled on the rug, trying to explain the rules of a drinking game to Luna as she taps her wand on his t-shirt in rapid succession, changing its colours in rhythm with his speech. Ginny is lovely and warm as she curls up next to Harry on the sofa. They share a bout of stifled laughter when Luna runs out of colours and graduates to patterns instead, and Ron somehow still doesn’t notice.
Harry’s fingers drift over Draco’s cheek. They are so warm they burn against his skin, and Draco shivers helplessly.
Harry turns in time to catch the sight of Ginny flying in over the treetops, backlit by the low sun. She tucks her body down flat against her broomstick and dives down, brushing her toes briefly over the surface of the stream, before banking up sharply. She does a barrel roll over the geraniums, laughing triumphantly, and then practically flings herself off her broom. She hits the ground running, and Neville lifts himself up out of his chair, arms open wide just as she charges straight at him.
With a low cry, my orgasm hits me. I'm arching my back as my come hits his stomach, and he speeds up his thrusts, both hands supporting himself and I know he's fucking me for his own pleasure, now. I ride out my orgasm, meeting him again for each thrust, wanting to make it as fucking amazing for him as it was for me. I look up at him then to find he's looking right back down at me, and I wonder if he's ever looked away.
And all you know seems so far away and
Harry came to lean against the wall next to him, close enough that their arms brushed. "I'm going to ask you something, and it's something I've asked you many times. If you're answer is still the same… I promise I'll never ask you again." Draco nodded. "I want you absolutely on my side, Draco, more than anything. I'm sorry I sound like a mother hen here, but… you're running around doing Merlin knows what on Voldemort's orders, and I just can't stand it. Can't stand to see you like his. We can protect you, Draco. There are places you could go, and more powerful wizards than me would be looking after you. Dumbledore will protect anybody who asks him. He
"I'm sorry," Draco added. "You don't know how sorry I am that it was Ron."
I cry out at the feel of him inside me, even just that little bit of him. He must have cast a lubrication charm at some point that I missed, because there is no resistance, only the sweet glide of him opening me, fucking me with his finger. He finds my prostate and touches it once, and I dig my fingers into his hair and bite down hard on my lip. He is still sucking my cock, using his tongue all along the underside and the head and then there are two of his fingers inside of me and I know that I cannot last much longer like this.
Draco tilted his head, trying to decide if they boy was lying. He studied the boy's face, finding eyes that were open and blaringly green behind the round frames. There wasn't even a hint of a smile on his face, and he looked so
Draco sighed shakily, eyes still closed. "Don't interrupt me."
Harry nodded regretfully. "Yeah, I do. I'm sorry."
His mind reeled from sensory overload, and he still really had no idea what he was doing. But it seemed he had found the instincts that had the ability to take over. He found his hands wandering down Harry's back and, pulling him closer, found his mouth opening against Harry's. He shuddered at the knowledge that his
"No," Draco uttered as he wrapped his arms around himself, trying to catch his breath and move out of her grasp.
"There's a first and last time for everything," Draco grumbled.
Harry had been right behind him.
He had led them straight to Harry. His Harry was dead because he had given him up, and if he'd only stopped to think about it beforehand, to imagine the consequences…
He only talked to Mother about Harry Potter after that. She told him that Harry Potter was almost exactly his age. He hadn't ever considered the fact that the
The end.
"Are you delusional?" Draco pulled away.
He didn't get very far before three House Elves had popped into his bathroom, restraining him with surprisingly powerful magic and ripping the knife away from him.
He didn't think he was any closer to completing either of his tasks for the Dark Lord, even though everything he had went into trying.
"Harry, listen." Draco turned, falling back into the corner and letting his head fall into the V. "I want to tell you. Believe me, if I could… I'd do it in a heartbeat." He looked up and into Harry's eyes, and felt his stomach pull again like it had in Harry's bed on his birthday. "I can't though, at least not yet. I will, when the time is right."
When he woke the next morning and saw the parchment sticking out from beneath his pillow, he was filled with a sense of dread. Wherever Harry was, whatever he was doing, he was doing it in secrecy and keeping an unimaginably low profile. And if he hated Draco or he didn't, at least Draco knew now that he was alive and safe somewhere.
"No, I don't care about that, you idiot!" Harry flopped down into one of the chairs, looking up at him with flashing eyes. "I care about the fact that you're running yourself into the ground, too tired from doing whatever you're doing to pay attention in class, coming
in his hair, and after he stomps his boots to get the snow off and comes fully into the entrance hall, I see he's got them stuck in his eyelashes, too. It is a rather long walk from the front gate.
"Please tell me, Draco."
"Good." Harry finished the task slowly, covering the area in a thick layer and placing a bit of gauze over it. When he was done, he wiped his hand on his pajama bottoms and avoided looking at Draco.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Harry had been Draco's hope and the hope of countless others. And after he had gone, the morale on the other side fell drastically. Reports came in daily of new victories for the Dark Lord. More and more important figures fell. The celebration on the day Kingsley Shaklebolt was killed had been almost as grandiose as the celebration for Harry. And the day the Burrow had been destroyed, Draco had been forced to go to the festivity for the sole purpose of identifying the remains of the Weasleys.
He bucks his hips against my hand in a quick spasm that he seems surprised by, as if his movements are somehow out of his control. "Hell, Draco," he gasps against my mouth, kissing me with bruising force and pulling my shirt from my trousers, unbuttoning it in earnest now.
tomorrow.
"Harry… if you're angry, please don't hide it from me."
In case you think you might be going insane, this truly is regarding Harry Potter and
He could barely stand; he fell back against the invisible ward to steady himself as the Dark Lord shoved the sleeve of Draco's robe up and pushed the tip of his wand against the Dark Mark.
I feel him pause for a moment in his ministrations, but he does not pull away. "I was for a couple of weeks, before I came out to Ginny. We just - didn't want a big thing about it in the papers. We figured we'd wait until one of us had found someone else to make it public."
I smirk, unbuttoning my trousers and slowly stepping out of them. My cock makes an obvious tent in my boxers, and Harry looks down. "Mother is shopping, which means she won't be home until dinnertime, at least."
