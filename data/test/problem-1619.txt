He set his forehead above his arm for leverage as his back bowed, lips opening on a strangled gasp. He increased his pace, ignoring the usual embarrassment he felt whenever he’d committed this much before. The sound of wet slapping was almost obscene in the newly calm quiet of the house. It was building faster now, the sweet pressure in his stomach more intense, more hot. God, it was like he was rising atop a geyser.
“Unsafe learning environment, my arse,” Harry spat, glaring down at the paper. “The castle was rebuilding itself before we even left. There’s no way it isn’t all fixed by now. And if McGonagall says it’s safe, it’s safe.” Real anger rippled through him for the first time in months. “I get letting kids stay home with their families if that’s what they want but to shut down the school?”
Harry did not comment that he knew that very well, having been nearly convicted of a crime while being underage, in this very building. Of course, back then he had been nearly thrown in jail just for conjuring a patronus in front of his cousin. The circumstances were a bit different.
For a long moment, Harry felt the weight of a large, ominous presence surround him. Like the house itself was weighing his words. It probably was, he allowed. This house more than anywhere else he’d ever been seemed to live and breathe and ooze feeling. The uncanny silence was jarring, because it went further than the absence of creaking and wind moaning somewhere far above in a drafty attic. It was like the house was holding its breath.
It was petty and cruel and selfish, and Harry wished more than anything that he didn’t care who Ron chose. He wished it didn’t feel like he’d chosen someone else, over Harry. He wished it didn’t hurt that Ron had only come and confronted him now, after he’d publicly exploded, rather than at any point in the last few weeks.
“He’s—” Harry stopped himself from calling Malfoy a cruel, stupid ferret. Somehow, he didn’t think it would be appreciated. “We never got on. I don’t have the best opinion of him. But I do think he was reluctant, maybe even forced to follow Voldemort against his will, by the end. I know—” He exhaled and adjusted his glasses. “When Voldemort had taken over his home and he didn’t go back to school, I know he was forced to do things, terrible things, against his will.”
Finally, soft footsteps answered him, scuffing amongst the broken stones. Harry listened intently as one by one they approached, light and broken as they walked through the center of the courtyard.
Harry listened to the sound of Kreacher’s mumblings move away, frowning. He didn’t know how old Kreacher was, or what happened to house-elves when they reached a certain age. The heads which used to be stuffed and mounted in the front hall told him what the Blacks used to do. But he’d never needed to know the natural lifespan of a house-elf.
Malfoy also seemed to have noted the strangeness of his reaction, because he pointedly looked over Harry’s shoulder instead of holding his gaze. “I’m surprised they didn’t call you in sooner to stab an Order of Merlin into your chest. They must want to get the Golden Boy’s stamp of approval on all the poor sods they couldn’t manage to pin something else on.” His mouth tightened. “But I suppose they already know who’s bound for Azkaban and who gets to work out their sins the old fashioned way through money and disgrace. The rest is a show to make it look like they’re doing something useful, isn’t it?”
does. It can’t be dispelled or countered, you see. You just have to get people away as fast as you can and minimize the damage.” She shot Robards a dark, haunted look. “By some miracle, though, the witch who cast the curse didn’t seem to understand what she was doing, because the moment I arrived, seconds after the complaint had come in, I saw her panic and try to stop.”
Seven hours later, Harry was seated on the edge of the fountain in the atrium, seriously considering just throwing himself and drowning.
Before he could so much as throw a Shield Charm up around her, though, a figure came barreling toward Hermione. Neville, shouting, roaring at her to run, and when she ignored him, pivoting with his wand to be ready. Hermione, face slicked with sweat and wrenched up in fear, withdrew her hand—and from the depths of the Sorting Hat came a glint of silver and red.
Harry watched the efficient movement of his fingers as they pulled on the glossy leather, remembering what Malfoy’s hand had looked like trembling around his wand in the Astronomy Tower, it’s solidity when facing off against his aunt. He wondered, suddenly, if Malfoy really had chucked the hawthorn wand, or if it was hidden up his sleeve right now. Or why he cared.
Harry finished off his ale, pleased to see Charlie’s waiting gaze. “Hermione, Ron, and me stole one of their dragons.”
All he knew was that he felt like someone had burned all the vital things that made him up and stuffed him full with dead air. Left him in the dark. Again.
He thought of Dumbledore’s obsession with the Deathly Hallows, the deaths of his parents, his little sister. How this must have been his ultimate goal, to bring someone back. To bring his sister back after he—or Grindelwald, had killed her. He would have wanted this desperately. The secret of resurrection. Of returning life.
His fingers brushed over Regulus’s notes, as if they might reveal this lie for what it was, as if he could prove it wrong, somehow. As if the ghost of Regulus Black could tell him he hadn’t died as a baby only to be reanimated by a scrap of Voldemort’s corrupted soul. His eyes burned and he screwed up his face so he wouldn’t cry. He
And at the bottom sat a cramped scrawl of words pressed so deep into the parchment there was more than one puncture mark. The ink was smeared in places, but Harry was able to read it.
Her eyes moved to a point just above his head and she chewed on her bottom lip. “Hmm. Well, you have a veritable flock of wrackspurts in your hair right now. You’ve always attracted them more than others, but this seems excessive.”
“I’ve loved having you here, Harry, so don’t take this as me warning you off,” she started gently, “but I wonder… Why are you spending so much time with an old woman and a toddler? You’re eighteen. Don’t you have something more exciting to do? You’ve got your own flat, don’t you? You should be spending time with friends, surely.”
“No, no, it wasn’t like that.” Harry set his drink down and leaned back in his chair, frowning. “It was fine, actually. Just a surprise, I guess.”
“How many of you kept your heads down and worked your jobs every day knowing witches and wizards were being marched down here to have their wands taken and snapped and their identity stripped away until they were just names on a fucking registry? How many of you watched your colleagues disappear one by one, comfortable because there was always someone else lower on the list than you? I saw what the Ministry looked like under Voldemort’s rule and it wasn’t a battleground. It wasn’t a war zone. How long did it take the Ministry to fall when Voldemort made his move? A few hours, if that? You
Harry didn’t know if he imagined it or not but noise in the room dropped perceptibly. His hand sweated, palm clammy over the hawthorn wand in his pocket. A lump formed in his throat as he stopped in front of them. Why had he walked over here? To fucking Malfoy and his death eater parents?
“I’ll wear a tracking cuff, if you want me to. If you’re going to put a curse in it, though, you might as well throw me in a cell.”
“What about the other kids?” he asked when it looked like Ron was going to interrupt him. “What about the eleven- and twelve-year-olds? Even the ones without parents who were death eaters have to come in.
The book opened with a simple cleansing ritual, variations on one theme branching off into two categories—that of the living, and that of the inert. Living here meant something which could act of its own will, and the inert as something acted upon. Harry guessed the line between the two was somewhat slippery, but he grasped the basic concept.
He wondered if this was what Sirius felt when he found Harry in his crib, his parents dead, his house destroyed. This horrible, heavy yearning to do
He retreated into himself, where there was nothing but anger and loss. A wide open cavern filled with hateful things just below the dark surface. All the sounds and noise and flashing swarmed around him, pressed in on him, but remained muted and distant. It felt, oddly, like the first few moments after he’d brought Cedric’s body back to Hogwarts. Lights and color, music flaring up as people cheered and laughed and clapped before they saw the truth. And him lying on the ground with his arm cut open and his hand clutching a dead boy’s wrist.
“It’s too quiet. I loathe the quiet.” The figure shifted, the space between them getting ever so slightly smaller. “Of all the places you could be, you choose this sad, lonely beach. I don’t understand it.”
There was the sound of a glass being set down gently on a table. A silence Harry could feel even outside the house.
Harry knew. Of course he knew. He’d seen plenty of people die before. He knew what it looked like when a body wasn’t going to move again.
“Do you have any opinion on the severity of the sentence handed out to your classmates, Ms. Granger?” the new Head of Magical Law Enforcement, Prunellia Yeats, asked in a ringing, glass-clear voice. “Understand this won’t have any effect on the sentencing, but I believe the court would value your opinion.”
Her mouth opened and closed, her own eyes going glassy. “Harry,” she whispered. “Harry, I—I’m sorry. You’re not making sense. You realize what you just… I—you’re acting like…”
“No.” Kingsley’s tone went hard, causing the hair on the back of Harry’s neck to rise. “Believe me, when I find out who was using lethal spell-work in that firefight, I will put them behind bars myself. There was no reason to use a Killing Curse, I don’t care what that girl was doing.”
He could sit here for the rest of his life, which was suddenly, horrifyingly wide open now, or he could start moving. Walking seemed better than not. Walking would lead him to food. He was starving. That was something he could deal with. Maybe he’d grab a coffee after and just ride the Underground until morning, because he knew without a doubt that he wasn’t getting any sleep tonight. He could pop into a cinema, maybe. He’d never been before. He’d never had the time or the opportunity. After, he’d find somewhere high enough that he could see the sunrise and sit for a while until his head was clear and the sun warmed him up. As if the new day would make any of this more bearable.
So it turned out Malfoy wasn’t a completely evil git. He’d done some things to begin to make up for everything wrong he’d done and thought in his life. So it made sense he’d be confused every time he saw Malfoy. That he’d feel a strange urge to prove himself every time Malfoy looked at him. That he could go months without feeling much of anything at all only to lose his Godric-damned mind after one conversation with him.
Teddy’s forehead was clear, though, unmarred. Teddy would grow up with someone who loved him, in a house where he didn’t have to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs. Teddy would know who he was, who his parents had been. Teddy wouldn’t be alone.
pile, thinking Charlie might be interested, when he spotted a hole in the back of the armoire. Peering through, he saw with surprise a small window and the corner of the attic. He’d reached the end.
Harry read the pages describing how to safeguard one’s horcrux against destruction, how to prepare oneself for the murder, but there wasn’t much on the theory behind it, and the book said very little about what happened to the vessel when a horcrux was put into it. There was no mention of what might happen to a living person.
from you?” Harry laughed. “Yeah. I bloody well hope so. You think I want to keep anything that belongs to you if I can help it?” He registered what Malfoy had said. “Wait, you know—”
Harry thought he should be congratulated on not swallowing his own tongue. Instead, he just gave a little choked sound of surprise.
“Lovely as you are,” he added out loud, shooting a nervous glance behind him as if the house were about to hit him with a frying pan. Which wasn’t exactly out of the realm of possibility, so his concern was warranted. Although, could it understand his thoughts, or was that something he needed to say out loud, or…
Harry wished he could shake her until she understood, because he couldn’t be the only one who saw how messed up this was. He couldn’t be the only person who didn’t think hurting children was morally reprehensible. The only person willing to stand up and actually
He’d never really seen the appeal of Hermione’s obsession with knowledge, but he started to understand—spend enough time in someone else’s head and you start to forget your own problems.
Hermione gasped, looking both excited and exasperated. “Oh my god. She’s—she’s an absolute legend! She was one of the leaders of the American Civil Rights Movement in the 60’s. She led the charge for desegregation in the MACUSA Department of Magical Law Enforcement. She’s the foremost authority about human rights when it comes to racial relations in Wizarding America, and she’s worked on so many high profile cases, mostly serial killers and cult leaders. She’s also apparently a total badass when it comes to dueling. She’s won awards and everything.” Her expression dropped. “I suppose she’d understand completely what went wrong here, with her experience.”
pushing Goyle off him enough to get back onto his knees, trying to put some space between them. He just needed a moment to breathe, then he could paralyze Goyle, and—
“The Internation Confederation of Wizards is concerned that Britain has a dark wizard problem. This is our second in a century, and it’s a wonder the muggles didn’t figure it all out this time. It’s not like—
He didn’t regret doing it. More than one death eater had known about this place, and even if most of them were dead or behind bars, he didn’t want to chance it. If people were going to come looking for him, he’d be stupid not to protect himself. Grimly, he thought Moody would approve. The last time he’d seen the man had been in the entrance of this house. Nearly a year ago.
It hadn’t quite hit home yet, though. Not until tonight. He felt an echo of the certainty he’d gained after Dumbledore’s funeral, the knowledge that there was no one else who could shield him. No one else he’d
He was so lost in his own thoughts that he nearly missed the book this note had been wedged in. Another French title, faint enough where it was etched into the black leather that he had to squint to see, and a simple name engraved into the bottom of the front cover.
Bill nodded, watching him closely. “I think Lucius and Narcissa went back with him at first, but by the time I showed up, it was just him.”
When he felt Ron and Hermione waiting for him to continue, his face flushed. “What was I supposed to do? Just walk away and ignore him?”
And if there was a small part of him that thrilled a bit at the idea of doing something reckless, something he knew without a doubt that both Ron and Hermione would soundly oppose, Harry didn’t much care right then.
because you can’t face the truth that the Ministry of Magic is filled with cowards who’d rather blame children than admit that they
Harry redirected the blast with a quick slash of his wand. Fire lit up the path as it caught on a few of the oak branches.
The place where Voldemort had buried his power, had remade him, was empty. And it was all he could do not to collapse in on himself at the loss.
“Thank you for coming here today, Mr. Potter,” Yeats said once the courtroom had quieted again. “The Wizengamot appreciates your cooperation with the transparency of these trials.”
He reached into the box and produced a stack of parchment and a few rather tarnished books, laying them out in a fan on the table.
of disapproval. The person beside him leaned up and whispered into his ear, “Between you and I, I admit I enjoy getting to finish them off myself.”
reason, the goblins didn’t want everyone to know that a few teenagers were able to infiltrate one of their most secure vaults, only to break out on what was their oldest dragon.”
Harry wouldn’t be surprised if his jaw cracked from how tight he was clenching it. Sounds built up in his throat but he pushed them back down, closing his eyes as his vision blurred. Horrible, cut off sobs rushed up to bash at the back of his teeth. He felt his body give out for a moment, like a string connected to his leg had been cut, but he clutched at Bill with his good hand.
His wand slid out of Goyle’s loose grip. Before he could stop himself, Harry looked down at Goyle’s face.
his mind supplied unhelpfully. With a jolt he realized that Malfoy was related to Andromeda, that he was her nephew. He had
Malfoy staring at him, his gaze heavy and probing, making him feel uneasy. What the fuck had come over him today? Maybe it was just being in the Ministry again. It’s not like this place conjured warm fuzzies for him. Or maybe he was just reacting normally to someone he hated looking at him like he wasn’t sure if he wanted to punch Harry or—
The last page of the book looked, at first glance, to be blank. Harry frowned, clenching and unclenching his hands as they spasmed. He took his glasses off to rub his eyes, gritty and aching from so long sat staring at the bloody book—
Maybe he couldn’t forget how Malfoy looked as he stared into Harry’s disfigured face in the shadows of his own home, fear and something like defiance flashing in his dark grey eyes. Maybe he couldn’t forget that same determination when Malfoy stood inches from Voldemort and decided to fight back.
in the way he was used to. It was a symbolic text, not a series of instructions, and it was so tied to the hand and finger movements that writing wouldn’t have been able to adequately convey it anyway, in the same way he had to work to speak Parseltongue when he wasn’t staring directly at a snake. It just wasn’t meant to be used outside its context.
“Tituba’s mercy,” Kamau murmured, her frown deepening as she studied him. Her hair was pulled back now, a dark red scarf tied around her head. “I’m surprised you’re even on your feet, sweetie.”
After a moment, Hermione scoffed. “Turned over? Please. I’m sure the entire property was seized as soon as they had the manpower to do it without anyone getting hurt.”
“Where the hell are you going to go, then?” Bill’s voice raised, sounding sharper than Harry had ever heard it.
“Don’t you d—” She spluttered, crushing the Quibbler in her fist. “This is— Do you understand what this looks like? Three months after Hogwarts, and you’re siding with death eaters?”
“Unless you can think of a reason besides revenge,” Kingsley said quietly, “I think we might need to accept that there
A knot of heat rose up Harry’s throat and he blinked a few times against the heat pricking in his eyes. He let Teddy grab his hand, his tiny fingers making a fist around Harry’s thumb before jerking it up and down. He hadn’t realized how quickly he’d gotten used to seeing them both. How much he’d missed them the past two weeks.
Harry didn’t meet her gaze, not wanting to lie to her but not wanting to have this conversation right now. The day of questioning had been bad enough, he didn’t need to deal with this too. “Maybe,” he allowed, summoning a tight smile. “But…listen can you not mention it to Ron for a while? At least until after the trials are over. I feel like everything’s a bit mad right now, and I’ll feel a hell of a lot better when I can breathe again, you know?”
“I’m all right,” he mumbled, shifting Teddy carefully to the side so he wasn’t as distracted by the kaleidoscope of colors battling for ground on the boy’s head. He usually favored teal or some variation thereof, but it was still a journey sometimes.
His body seized as he tried to get it back. Goyle was still choking him, but he lifted up and held Harry’s wand out of his reach, a manic, shocked smile tugging up his mouth into a rictus grin. Tears streaked down his dirty face and he was shaking. Harry reached up, fingers trying to get some hold on Goyle’s mouth or cheek, but he could only managed to slap him. He needed his wand. Goyle had his wand. More dark spots. Goyle’s grip tightened again on his throat. Harry’s eyes rolled back into his head, black crowding in the edges of his vision. Goyle was saying something, shouting and crying, but Harry couldn’t hear him. His mind was screaming. Screaming and shrieking and he couldn’t think. His chest was aching so bad he thought Goyle might have ripped it open.
The Malfoy sitting between his parents, face blank and eyes hollow? Harry knew that Malfoy better than he wanted to.
Harry jerked around just as he’d determined to leave, unable to ignore the boy who wouldn’t let him walk away.
Malfoy staring up at Harry from the base of a broken staircase like he was desperately searching for something, ash and blood caking his face.
For a long moment they all stood in silence. Even Teddy went quiet, only humming pensively as he mouthed at the collar of Sirius’s jacket. Or, Harry’s jacket now, he supposed.
He kept losing his train of thought, drifting, staring down into his drink and thinking of children with metal cuffs on their ankles and blank, dead eyes.
This wasn’t nearly so strong, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something had slid out of place. He cast
The language was still entirely illegible, but there were symbols on most of the pages, lines around them which looked almost like diagrams. They didn’t look like wand movements, but for a book this old, which it had to be, he could almost feel the age, there might not be wand movements anyway. Most Wizarding cultures had only adopted wands in the last few centuries, and there were still parts of the world where wizards didn’t use them at all.
He wouldn’t be able to deal with the throng of people, his anger shifting and mutating into a rabid animal in his chest the further away he walked from that courtroom. Instead, he took the lift up to the roof and cut in line for the apparition point. People started to protest, but when they saw him—Harry Potter the war hero, with burning eyes and clenched hands—they let him pass.
She gaped at him, crying silently, sagged against the door. She looked so small, smaller than she’d ever looked, and Harry hated that too because he’d caused it. How many times had she saved him and now he was shouting at her in a bathroom—and she was looking at him like he was a stranger.
He rubbed his eyes from under his glasses, scowling at the throbbing of his brain. He didn’t have a headache, exactly, but he felt wrung out and fuzzy and a bit nauseous even after the food.
Malfoy flinched, face going soft, showing a sliver of weakness, just as powerful as if Malfoy had shouted back at him. He didn’t drop Harry’s gaze. If anything, he seemed determined to hold it too.
When he heard small gurgling noises, he made himself get up and walk to Teddy’s crib. He was still sleeping, his fists curled up and his eyes shut, but he was squirming. It surprised Harry that he knew it meant he was about to wake up. Maybe it shouldn’t have, since he’d been spending so much time here. Still the knowledge made something inside him warm, just a fraction.
Goyle slammed into him. He was big, much bigger than Harry even if he was noticeably thinner, and Harry went down hard under Goyle’s bulk. They rolled back onto the path, Harry’s face scraping over the dirt and digging his glasses into his temple. His skin burned and the pain cleared his head.
The crystallized fog of his depression shattered and it was like icy air rushed in on a wave of panic.
“Master will be following Kreacher,” he said pleasantly, tugging on Harry’s hand before disappearing into the large stacks of books. “Kreacher is knowing something Master Harry can be helping with.”
he also owned. He signed the papers, took the keys, accepted control of the wards, and she was gone.
Malfoy came to a stop a few feet away from the stairs. His chest rose and fell fast, color standing out stark against his pale skin.
Malfoy hadn’t gotten on a lift with the other Slytherins. He must have hung around after Hermione dragged him into the bathroom. Wanted to see Famous Harry Potter fight with his friend, probably. Have a laugh after with his mates when he saw Harry had been crying.
Unbidden, the photograph of Dumbledore and Grindelwald as teenagers swam to the front of his mind. Dumbledore and the boy he had apparently loved so much he had stood aside as the world burned.
It was so similar to Narcissa’s, down to the way her lips were pursed on the left, how her eyes held him like she could see right through him, his palm slipped on the knife he was cleaning.
She stared at him, big blue eyes startling in their intensity. “Have you been spending a lot of time in Wiltshire this summer?”
Harry tried to get closer and see who it was, only the farther he walked the more distant the figure seemed to get. All at once it was vital to learn who was waiting for him, who had brought him here to this quiet, shining, desolate place. Who wouldn’t let him get close enough to see…
But Malfoy only stepped forward and lowered his voice, eyes gleaming like a cat who had been waiting for hours for a mouse to emerge from a hole so he could rip it to shreds. “That’s it, isn’t it? You thought you were special, thinking you and Granger and Weasley were the only ones who had any clue what Vol—what
He glared down at the box for another minute, trying to convince himself to leave well enough alone, but in the end his curiosity wore out. It was just a box. He’d be careful.
Their ghosts had been here too, but after the ritual, the air smelled new and clean, and the shadows were just shadows, not places where dark things and thoughts lurked.
Tom Riddle was still there, leaning against the tree across the path, his smirk private and taunting. The nails of Harry’s left hand dug into his knee.
She pulled him after her with a strength Harry was startled by, too surprised to do anything more than follow. She slammed open one of the private toilets, shoved Harry inside, and pulled it shut behind her.
“—doesn’t know anything?” Bill was saying, voice low and hard. “He’s been more than cooperative up until now. Maybe he could talk to them, get them to explain—”
A shadow passed over the courtyard followed closely by a swift breeze. Dust and smoke cleared where they’d obscured Malfoy’s face.
There was a smile in the voice now, a direction. A cruel smile. Coming from behind him. Above him. His fingers brushed something cold, something white and curved. He pulled, dragged it out from the leaves. It was bone. No…the curved tip of an antler.
With everything he’d been through, especially the past few months, it was nice to be reminded that it was a gift. Sometimes he forgot what it’d been like, before. He never forgot the loneliness and the anger, the caged, helpless feeling of knowing no one wanted him and no one cared. But this—he had the power to change the world he lived in. And even if everything else felt like it was unraveling, like everything he did was taking him further off the path and deeper into the forest, this was still good.
He pictured Teddy solemnly patting apple sauce in his bowl like he was sitting at a potter’s wheel. His hair a shade of vibrant, electric blue and his eyes—brown, just like his dad. Like Remus. And it was that image paired with the memory of Remus smiling sadly at him with those same brown eyes as he taught Harry how to push out the dark that finally did it.
There were only three people waiting for him today, including the intimidating white-haired man who had summoned him. They sat at a large table with a tray of glasses, a silver carafe, and a jug.
Harry registered how funny that warning was, but in the moment it took for Bill to apparate, his eyes were drawn to the path. Beyond the little copse of trees in the shadows, he saw a figure, far clearer than he should have been able to make out from this distance. Familiar.
The pearls multiplied until he felt them settle, hovering in the air and humming at a frequency he could only just hear as a distant ringing, like the sound produced from running a finger around the mouth of a glass. He stood in the middle of a furiously bright room, the beads of light refracting like tiny stars.
When a voice called across the atrium, the moment broke and Malfoy turned, only to scowl. “Lovely,” he muttered.
A tiny thread pulled at his chest as he remembered the terrified look on Malfoy’s face in the courtroom, as he watched Harry descend the elevator with a strange light in his eyes, the smile and the approval in the atrium which had made Harry feel like a fire’d been lit inside him—it was just—odd. Unsettling. It wasn’t that he…
Harry wondered if he shouldn’t try to stay out of it. He’d thought about this a bit already, and he’d decided not to interfere in anything when it came to Ron and Hermione’s relationship. He’d had enough of being a go-between during school. He sympathized with Ron, really, but it sounded like Hermione needed this. And he couldn’t exactly blame her for wanting to connect with her family, to take some time away.
The smoke and dust cleared, sucked into the vortex and expelled out over the bridge and toward the lake. It was carnage, clear now amidst the bodies lying on the ground and the slashes of scarred rock and dark liquids.
Malfoy was just on his mind. That was all. Had been all summer but that was understandable, considering what’d happened after the Battle at Hogwarts and then the trials and Goyle…
She was right. It was a big chance. An insane chance. One Harry hadn’t understood at the time, and if he were being honest, he still didn’t understand. But Dumbledore had loved giving people second chances. Snape. Malfoy. He hadn’t even fought Grindelwald until his hand was forced.
He cut Robards off with a look. “I broke into the Department of Mysteries when I was fifteen. That’s how secure your Ministry is.”
Harry looked down at his ale, frowning. Malfoy had made the same joke. He didn’t know why it bothered him so much. It was the plan, after all. Join the Aurors’ Office. Keep fighting dark wizards. He’d known people would be grateful to him, but it seemed like the world had decided to treat him like he knew everything when it came to this stuff. Like he wasn’t an eighteen-year-old kid who hadn’t even finished school. Shouldn’t he be more experienced? Why the hell did they think he was ready to just slide into that kind of a job, a kind of job that regularly dealt with peoples’ lives?
The silence held. He seemed to be weighing his words carefully, waiting. Harry wasn’t going to help him along, so he just stared.
His thigh nudged between Harry’s legs and Harry let out a strangled noise of pleasure, incoherent now as his breath came fast, as it grew harder and harder to breathe, every exhale ringing through the cavernous room. His back arched, his legs opened wider, his mind growing sluggish as pleasure pulsed slowly through his veins like poison, Tom’s words low and intoned like an incantation. They drifted over his face like a series of kisses, settled just behind Harry’s ear.
she brandished the magazine, now little more than shreds of paper, “was the way to do it? You personally know the Minister for Magic. Everyone in this building would have listened to you if you’d done this properly. They

be it. If Goyle had wanted him dead, he could have found a better and quicker way of doing it than stalking Harry for weeks. Harry clearly knew less than he’d thought he’d known about Goyle, but Harry would bet money he still wasn’t the type to do this so subtly, to spend so much time working on it, only to fuck it up on the dismount. Nothing about those final moments with Goyle was calculated, planned. He was raving.
He was almost—disappointed, if he had to pin it down. It was maybe the best orgasm he’d ever had, miles away from the pathetic excuse for sex he’d had with Ginny, and it’d come about because of a vague impression of…someone. Someone Harry knew, or… Maybe not. It was like an itch at the back of his head, under his skull, imprinted on his brain. Problem was, he didn’t know any girls who were taller than him except for Fleur, and he knew without a doubt it hadn’t been her. It’s not that Harry wasn’t immune to her charms—they’d met when he was fourteen, so it wasn’t like he hadn’t tugged one off to her at some point in his life, as scummy as it made him feel now—but she was more like an older sister at this point.
All at once Malfoy’s brow smoothed as he tilted his head, realization darkening his gaze. “You heard about Ravenna.”
He didn’t break it but he wanted to. Seemed like a petty thing to do. And even now, after everything, he couldn’t break it knowing what it meant to Dumbledore.
Grimmauld Place didn’t scare him, not like it used to, but he could feel its outline, the skeleton of this house, caging him in. Even a lovely house could be a prison.
“I…well I realize this is a bit odd, but I was wondering if there was anything I could do to help you…with the house.” He gestured with both hands, as if Kreacher might be in danger of not knowing which house he was talking about. “I’m not much use, I know, but I’m… I can help. If you like.”
But if these were Regulus’s notes in the weeks leading up to his death, Harry guessed what they must be about, and if anyone deserved to read them, it’d be him.
Bill was the one who finally broke. He took a purposeful step forward, giving Andromeda a reassuring smile. “You can stay if you’d like, but I don’t think this will take very long.”
He had a feeling this was more about intention than mechanics, though, and intention he could work with.
He took a deep breath, letting the image of himself standing amongst a sea of stars settle his nerves, and whispered,
Harry didn’t know if it was the sharp tone of her voice, or his heart still ricocheting around in his throat from his flashback, but he couldn’t let it go. He turned around and called, “Bill!”
“Right, so,” Harry exhaled, ran a hand through his hair, “what does this mean for me? I know you said—I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but this is… This is it? You’re not going to charge me with anything?”
Harry nodded. Before he could follow Andromeda, Bill pulled him into a hug. It was a bit too tight, and Harry winced at the lingering soreness, but he slumped forward into Bill’s chest. Bill was big and warm and Harry felt like he was ripping apart at the seams. It was nice. Even if it hurt, it was nice. He’d regret it later, when this was just a reminder of what he’d always lacked, but right now Harry would take whatever he was given.
his family, but after a while it became hard to find any kind of peace and quiet with everyone clustered around him all bloody day, people coming and going, the house always noisy with someone’s laughter or shouting—and crying, so much crying. he would catch himself staring out over the West Country fields, fighting the urge to just get on his broom and fly until he reached the ocean. He didn’t know what he was going to do when he got there but it seemed sometimes like anything would be better than sitting under the big oak in the backyard, counting down the moments until someone found him and called him back to the house. The wind stirring through the grass and coasting over the hills in waves, pulling him away toward something simpler, somewhere he could breathe. Where he didn’t have to constantly reassure people that he was all right.
Harry told him everything, trying to be as detailed as possible, though he choked and stumbled on the actual killing. Now that he was feeling closer to normal, the reality of what he’d done hit him.
He turned and gave Harry a look which once might have made his blood boil. Now it just made him uneasy. It was like looking into the face of what his father might have been at his age—cold, cruel, unreachable.
Before he could stop himself, he reached down and smoothed a few pieces of blue hair back from Teddy’s forehead.
“A long time ago. I decided to stay home once Nymphadora was born but I still know a thing or two. I’m sure I don’t have to tell you how useful it is when you’re constantly running after a child who seems determined to run headfirst into everything they see.”
His grey eyes hardened and he sat up. The indistinct dissociation vanished from his features as he adopted a cold, impassive stare—a mirror to his mother’s.
Harry waited to feel guilty but it never came. He just held Robards’s gaze. “Are you going to tell Yeats, then?”
It was so unexpected Harry thought for a horrible moment that he was going mad. Three months, and the voice still managed to make him jerk with attention. Three months, but he was thrown backwards in time to a life he couldn’t even remember living it felt like so long ago, when he was still bothered by school bullies and sneering gits who thought they were better than anyone else. The last time he’d heard that voice sound anything other than scared or shaking or shouting was before the day Harry had sliced open its own in the bathroom.
It didn’t help that Ron and Hermione had left after a few weeks. Ron was spending most of his time in London with George, helping get the shop back up, and Hermione had gone to retrieve her parents from Australia with the hope that she could restore the memories she had taken, and Harry was just…waiting. The war trials were due to start at the beginning of August. He had already been told to prepare himself for days of questioning and testimony but beyond that, he had no idea what to do. He had always wanted to be an auror but the idea of working at the Ministry right now felt about as stifling as the heat in Ron’s attic room. He didn’t know what he wanted, only that he wanted to move, and keep moving.
Hours had passed before the pain subsided enough for Harry to be able to make his way upstairs to take a shower. Once in the shower ,his first priority was to clean all his cuts but he was too worked up at the moment to do that. So he quickly grabbed his blade and made the deepest cuts he had ever made. He didn’t realize it in the moment but it was true. When he finally stepped out of the shower he bandaged all of his new injuries.
By the time 12pm rolled around Harry had several new cuts, bruises, and broken bones. But this was just the beginning. Harry was brought down to the basement and he knew things were about to get a whole lot worse.
The second Hermione saw him she jumped up from her place on the floor next to Ron and ran to him to engulf him in a bone crushing hug. He really did love and care for Hermione but in the moment he really wished she would get the fuck off him because she was reallly hurting him and all of his now hidden injuries. Because of the pain he winced but when she asked if he was ok he obviously couldn’t tell her that he was beaten half to death almost everyday so he told her that she just scared him. Once the greetings were over Harry made his way over to where Ron and Hermione were previously sitting and they proceeded to laugh and talk up until Mrs.Weasley came up to get them for dinner.
After Harry opened his gifts he opened his letters and was FUCKING BLESSED with the news that he would be leaving the Dursley’s in 3 days. When he was done looking over everything he fell into an uncomfortable sleep for the night. When he woke up from a nightmare he wasn’t surprised in the slightest. But he quickly realised he had fucked up he had fucked up BAD. Why you may ask?  He had woken up the Dursley’s that’s fuckin why. But there was nothing he could do about it now. So he waited for the inevitable shitshow that was about to happen.
The next morning was as chaotic as ever with everyone running about the house trying to locate their last few belongings before leaving. They tried to not be late they really did but with 6 peoples belongings and many other people there tasked with protecting them they were inevitably late. They made it to the platform with barely enough time to spare, so they quickly boarded the train with their belongings and went to search for an empty compartment.
Finally it was the day Harry would be rescued from this hell hole he called “home”. He was taken to the headquarters of the Order of the phoenix. When he arrived all the people he loved and cared about were there besides Severus Snape. Fuckin bastard. But anyway he was so happy to see everyone and to be away from his abusive relatives.
To cope with the abuse and all the pressure that was upon his shoulders from being The Boy Who Lived Harry self harmed. He desperately hoped no one would find out. He had been keeping it a secret for around 6 years now and he ABSOLUTELY. DID. NOT. plan on anyone finding out anytime soon. And he didn't want to actually die either so it was ok...right?
During dinner there was an argument because Harry couldn’t have one fucking night for things to be peaceful. They were arguing about whether Harry could be a part of the order or not, but it didn’t even phase him because shit like this always happened. Everyone deciding his life for him  just the usual. In the end he ended up being kind of in the order whatever that meant. Once everyone was done eating and dinner was cleaned up everyone started to retreat to their own rooms. Harry was sharing a room with Ron as usual and they talked for a while before he excused himself to take a shower.
While doing this task Harry realized that his 15th birthday was tomorrow. Harry was not excited at all like most people would be. He just faintly hoped that Uncle Vernon would leave him be for just this one year. Wondering what that means? Well no one knew but Harry had been being abused since he was about 4. And every year on his birthday Vernon took extra care to make as horrible and excruciatingly painful as possible. And what was it… about 5 years ago now Vernon had started to rape him. So add that to the list of horrible things that he prayed wouldn't happen tomorrow.
It was a normal morning at number 4 Privet Drive. Harry Potter had just woken up from another nightmare in the graveyard. Harry desperately hoped he hadn't woken the Dursley's again because he knew what would happen if he did. He looked over at the clock. It was 3:36am, once again he was awake before 5 o'clock. Harry knew he would not be able to go back to sleep, so he stood up, stretched, and grabbed his pen from his desk to cross  another day off on his calendar that was counting down the days until he returned to Hogwarts. His safe haven.
For the next few weeks things were surprisingly normal and Harry and his friends would be returning to school tomorrow.
He went over to his trunk and grabbed his shower bag which included all of the “normal” (because what was normal in his life) things you needed for a shower but also his razor blades and bandages. Then he headed to the bathroom and started to undress. He usually avoided looking in the mirror but when he caught his reflection he just stared at all of the old scars, newly healed cuts, open wounds, and bruises that littered his torso. Then he looked at his arms with all of the cuts and scars he created himself. Harry was there for at least five minutes just staring and thinking about the fact that he liked all the marks that he put on his body. He was sort of proud of them in a way because he controlled what they looked like, where they were, and how deep they were. He was disgusted by all the other marks though.
When Vernon burst through the door (after unlocking the 7 locks may I add) he made a beeline for him and  punched him in the abdomen. He gasped for air but he knew this was nowhere near over. He was punched and kicked many more times but he stopped counting after the third blow. But eventually it was over and Vernon left. And Harry was broken once again. Left to tend to his injuries.
Time dragged, it felt like it had been days instead of  hours when they finally arrived at Hogsmeade station. Once they arrived at the school they exited the carriages and made their way into the great hall for the welcoming feast which was pretty normal until Dumbledore  announced the new DADA teacher. Dolores Umbridge. And you wanna know what this bitch did…. she INTERRUPTED HIM. Yea that doesn’t happen but anyway she looked like a fuckin toad. She was wearing a nauseating shade of pink and had a little black bow in her hair that reminded him of a fly. He was trying SO HARD not to laugh at the ghastly woman.
It had been hours when Vernon finally left him. He lay on the floor in a fetal position sobbing, he had been raped again. It was worse than last time. All he wanted to do at the moment was slice his wrists open and bleed out. Wait No! He thought he did not want to die. But in the end he couldn’t move right now anyway so it didn’t matter.
this is even shorter than chapter 1 but thats it for the backround so now lets get into the actual story
The order was having a meeting so he was told to go upstairs for the time being. While going upstairs Harry was searching for a bathroom and when he finally found one he slipped in, hopefully unnoticed so he could cast his glamours. When he was done he went searching for Ron and Hermione.
Aunt Petunia was no longer surprised to find Harry awake at very early hours of the morning. When Petunia entered the room where Harry resided she told him he would be doing yard work for that particular day, after making breakfast for the family of course. Over the years he learned not to complain about his chores because he knew if he did he would be severely beaten. Every summer holiday the beatings got worse. This holiday he had almost died more than once because of Vernon.
He entered his room to find many letters and gifts from all the people who actually cared about him. And as Harry opendy them a faint smile pulled at the corners of his lips. The first one since he had returned to the Dursley's.
Usually while he did his chores he got lost in thought. Today his mind brought him back to the time before he found out he was a wizard. Those were really sad times because he had no one. No friend and people at school hated him along with his so-called "family". But he was snapped out of his thoughts when his aunt yelled for him to come in and make lunch. When the Dursley's had finished their meal he cleaned up and went back outside into the garden to finish his work. Time flew when he was doing work. And before he knew it the sun was low in the sky. Harry sprinted into the house to get supper ready before 7. As usual he hardly had enough food for a small 5 year old before he was screamed at and slapped hard in the face because he "ate too much". After he cleaned up dinner he went upstairs to shower. Then he was drifting into an uneasy sleep with a few more angry red lines on his wrist.
He ran through everything Goyle had said, and paused. “He seemed—er, I don’t know if it was just me caught off guard, but he was stronger than he should have been. He looked half-starved, but I couldn’t shake him off. He was able to do this,” he lifted his right hand, “just by hitting my hand on the ground.”
He didn’t let himself think about the stack of books he was making for Hermione, or the small collection of things he thought Ron would get a kick out of.
Malfoy’s mouth twisted again but all he could manage was a grimace. He blinked a few times, as if he was trying to find the thread of his point. “Well, congratulations. I suppose having the most powerful wand in the world is preferable to—”
Harry swallowed his unease and closed his eyes, breathing deep until he didn’t feel like his chest was on fire.
He still felt like a complete ass when he stepped out of the floo in a coughing fit. The huge black atrium was just as polished and clean as it had been the last time he was here, though there were less propaganda posters hanging on the wall. Just as imposing and official. It was still packed with witches and wizards going about their day, but there was something hushed about it all, like someone had cast
“If I remember correctly, it was Royse Avery who built the house in the Cotswolds, sometime around 1460. It was near the start of the War of the Roses, anyway. So you’re probably looking at a Binding of Hunger, a consecrated apple tree bound by the knucklebones of a Welsh Trallod Du. It’s pretty straight forward—the spellcraft, anyway—but you can’t remove the tree without destroying the bones or you’ll have a whole family of wights hunting you down for the rest of your life.”
He actually smiled at this. Like he wouldn’t know who Draco fucking Malfoy was. “I went to school with him. Reckon I know better than you who he is.”
Harry gritted his teeth as the pressure on his mind increased. A surge of magic rushed through him, the same kind of magic he’d felt when he’d killed Goyle. A searing white to cut through the black entity trembling and shifting, form splitting apart only to come together again, losing a bit more of itself every time.
He hated that he was feeling this now, in the aftermath of murdering someone. It was frightening as hell, knowing now how easily he could lose this. He didn’t want to associate this moment with doing something so unforgivable. Part of him wanted to go back to the bed and lie down so he couldn’t infect Teddy, like it was an illness and Harry was contagious.
“Your apartment in St. Andrews was mostly destroyed, as you know. But we were able to salvage a few things.” From a pocket of his robes, he pulled out a few more items. Harry’s heart leapt into his throat at the sight of them.
She paused, taking a breath, composure wavering. “You are also poisoned, Harry. I won’t be able to treat any of the other injuries until I purge the poison, but unfortunately you have to remain conscious because I need to maintain this map of your body to monitor the spread of the poison to make sure the antidote is working. I can’t put you under yet. Luckily, the poison seems to be rather generic, so a general antidote should do it, but it is necessarily thorough, and it isn’t gentle. You’re going to be in a lot of pain. Do you understand me, Harry?”
The fighting had grown weak around the edges of the courtyard, a large open circle surrounding Voldemort where he dueled McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn, and Bellatrix as she gained on Draco. Because it was clear where that fight was going. He had managed to surprise her but Bellatrix was the superior witch and Draco was swaying and stumbling on his feet the longer he battled her. He nearly went down from a jinx that caught his foot, acid burning through the cuff of his trousers. Bled through to bare pale skin.
Harry had never before wished he’d paid more attention in History of Magic. He sat there frozen for a while, wondering if there was something to the idea that the initial spell, this ancestor, had been far simpler than the one he’d heard about, the one Dumbledore had cast on his parents’ house and Grimmauld Place. He closed the book carefully and set it aside for later perusal. He’d thought about figuring out how to hide this place again after their disastrous escape from the Ministry last year. It was still unplottable and warded, presumably, but he didn’t know how thoroughly. Now that he seemed fated to live here, at least for now, it was something to look into.
Even bored out of his mind, he didn’t think he wanted be around anyone else. A weird, jittery tension had worked its way into his brain and he didn’t think he would be able to carry out a normal conversation, even with Ron and Hermione. So he bought a television, managed to hook up a line to the next door building so he could steal their cable, and watched television for the first time in nearly five years. He spent a few hours trying hard to pay attention to a program about an alien who flew around in a police box and dressed like his uncle on a golfing holiday—in fact he was pretty sure he had seen the very same beige jacket and paisley scarf in the Dursleys’ front hall closet when he was younger. He still didn’t understand Dudley’s obsession with the thing. After a while he started getting antsy and he had to force himself not to pace around his new, still mostly empty, flat.
Letting the attic lead him didn’t work all the time, though. He’d been collecting what he thought was a series of memoirs which reminded him of Lockhart’s books, only to realize to his immediate horror that they were
The crushing weight of his own fatigue came down on him. He swallowed as a tight, hot pain worked its way up his throat. His eyes burned with unshed tears, rousing now as if drawn from his anger. He couldn’t be here anymore in this castle, watched by all those horribly grateful people. In the same castle where he’d decided to die to save them. Where he had killed Voldemort.
you killed Vincent and then Draco, you got to him, you did something to him and how he… and now he—he won’t—”
He’d killed Goyle. A kid he’d gone to school with for six years. A bully and a thug, sure, a kid who’d tried to kill him and nearly succeeded, but he was still… He was still a person Harry knew. Had known.
How to resurrect a person and make sure their soul didn’t pass on. How to break them just right so they were trapped here.
But they were older now and they had all the time in the world. Ginny was nearly of age, and it wasn’t like Harry wasn’t interested in the concept of sex, far from it, but every time things turned in that direction—he felt nothing. Not wrong, just weird. He had the thought more than once that he would probably feel the same if he tried to shag Hermione, which put everything into a perspective that made it rather hard to get…hard. Seventeen and bored out of his mind and he couldn’t even get it up to have sex with his girlfriend, his brave, beautiful, wonderful, infinitely capable girlfriend. Every time it got close, every time he felt Ginny waiting for him to make the move they both knew was supposed to be coming, Harry just shut down.
“French bloke named Proulx. Acted like he had a broomstick up his ass the whole day. And a woman from America, Kamau. She was decent, actually.”
Harry would have nodded his head too, but Teddy was currently trying to twist his hair into some kind of eldritch knot, intense concentration on his tiny pink face. His left eye slowly shifted into Harry’s green while the right remained his normal brown.
Another barrier rose and hummed, layering its toneless harmony onto the first. Fresh green and yellow light spread out from his hands and curled up from the steam where his blood ran along the sigil.
Andromeda was holding Teddy in the door of the kitchen, the boy squirming and reaching toward Harry in a demanding, imperious way.
Tom’s smile went wide in triumph. “I know, Harry. It’s all right now. Just let go, and it will all be over.”
Felicity looked to Robards, who nodded. “Her name is Millicent Bulstrode,” she said grimly, “and I think, Mr. Potter, that you know where this is going.”
Harry didn’t respond, but just moved through the hall and into the sitting room. He hesitated when he saw who was waiting for him—Robards, Faye Kamau, for some reason, and a younger woman with a severe blonde bob and large yellow glasses Harry had never met before.
he understood the magic he was performing, but he wasn’t being entirely stupid. He knew it like he’d known the moment he touched his wand that it belonged to him.
he told himself. Molly and Arthur were the closest things to parents Harry had, and he’d basically ignored them all summer.
The stupid thing was that there was no reason to be nervous. He was just answering questions. He wasn’t accused of anything, he didn’t need to defend himself. He was going to the Ministry for the first time as an actual guest, not someone wanted for performing underage magic. There was no pressing matter of life and death which needed to be resolved. He was a witness. That was all. He might not even need to testify in front of the full council.
good. He’d always felt protective of his friends, he’d wanted to live up to Dumbledore’s expectations, but he’d never felt both at the same time. He had sacrificed himself to save all those people, but it hadn’t felt as desperate at this. This violent, overwhelming urge to shield something so much smaller and more fragile than himself. A need to be good enough, not to set an example, but just to be worthy of having the responsibility. All those lives had been precious and important, but Teddy felt like
“An extremely powerful magical artefact that projects an aura of decay for at least twenty feet on all sides, an archaic form of the Degradation Curse, but much more potent.” She frowned, but kept going, like she couldn’t help but tell him everything she knew about it. “There were only ever five made. Apparently, the wizard who created them was considered something of a madman, because no one ever tried to replicate it. Or if they did, they didn’t live to tell anyone else.”
Also, to make matters worse, apparently the twins, before Fred’s death, had secretly brought him on as the principle investor of the shop, opened a vault for him connected to his parents’ and he was now making a very small percentage of their earnings. Even so, the shop was so successful and his holdings at Gringotts had swelled so quickly over the year or so since the twins had roped him in, they had upgraded him to a different, more secure vault. One which was apparently deep enough down in the caverns that they informed him he would need to send word if he wanted to visit it himself, because they would need to prepare an escort—this only confirmed the fact that they knew exactly what he had done. But they didn’t care. Because he had too much money now. Which was insane.
“My Mistress is doting ever so much on this plant,” Kreacher added, rubbing his leaking nose on the end of his dish rag ensemble. “Kreacher cannot thank Master Harry enough for—”
The feeling in Harry’s stomach should have been annoyance, it should have been resignation, because of course Malfoy would be an ass about this. He was an ass about everything. But he wasn’t annoyed. He actually felt bad for not thinking about what it might cost Malfoy to cooperate.
And they would lose what little peace of mind they’d been able to regain since the day he’d killed Voldemort. He could take that away from them. He could make them afraid again. Again, he could pull them down into his world of death and dark magic and make them live through it just like he had to live through it. It was bad enough knowing Bill and Andromeda knew pieces of it, knowing they were worried about him. That they were in danger because of him.
He was stalling. He needed to just get in the floo and go. This wasn’t going to get any easier the longer he stood there feeling like a prat.
“Thank you both for telling me how terrible I look. It’s nice to know after all we’ve been through we still make an effort to be kind to each other.”
He was just about to disapparate on the spot—when the hair on the back of his neck stood up. Gooseflesh prickled up over his arms and it was like his mind roared to life. His senses seemed to shift and heighten, his eyesight growing sharp, his ears suddenly hearing a full wealth of noise which had been inaudible only a moment before. The bark under his fingers was rigged and digging into his skin.
“I’m upset, you see,” he said forcefully, “because I’ve witnessed this kind of thing before. Kids being used as collateral to make sure their parents behaved and fell in line. You know who else did that?
As Harry filled his third plate, feeling full for the first time since he’d left Shell Cottage, he wondered if Molly wasn’t hiding out in the kitchen waiting to spring out and shove a whole roast ham down his throat. The guilt of that thought slowed him up a bit.
Goyle’s body jerked upright and Harry nearly threw up. He closed his eyes, forced himself to concentrate on not dropping—the body. Goyle’s body.
Harry fought himself, wondering why they fuck he felt he owed Malfoy anything more than a kick up the arse.
Charlie wiped the back of his hand over his mouth, giving Harry a wide smile. “This is why I stick to dragons. No politics or drama. Just fire and claws. Much simpler. Primal, even.”
Bill scowled, scars pulling at his handsome face before he tossed Harry the paper. “You’re not gonna like it.”
“It does, actually,” Bill said mildly, meeting Harry’s look with a pointed one of his own. “Intent matters when deciding how to charge a witch or wizard for committing a crime. So does the state of mind of the individual at the time the crime was committed. You were nearly incapacitated. You reacted without intent to kill. You notified a Ministry official within minutes of the act. Your wand was tested and every spell you cast was one of defense, a fact witnessed and attested to by several members of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. All of this matters.” His expression hardened. “And even if none of that were true, even if you insisted on undergoing examination, taking Veritaserum, allowing a legilimens to examine your memories, it’d be moot, because you have two senior Ministry officials from two different departments speaking on your behalf.”
Harry—knew Harry had always chosen to disarm, not destroy, to incapacitate, not kill—he would wait and outlast him, out-duel him. He would make sure Harry
Robards inclined his head. “That’d be most helpful. I’ve decided to keep this investigation quiet. All the witnesses at your building have been questioned, and no one but the landlord seems to know you were the owner, and she’s sworn to keep quiet in accordance of the agreement you both signed. As such, it will take time to do this properly, without drawing more attention.”
Maybe Dumbledore had been wrong about all it. Maybe Harry had never been whole. Who could do something like that to a person, even by accident?
At best, Robards was being naive. No one in their right mind who’d been through what Harry’d been through the past three years would trust the Ministry of Magic for any kind of protection. Even if Harry did think the Ministry had his best intentions at heart, which he most certainly did not, Harry would be stupid to think they could do more than slow down whatever was coming for him next.
He began dropping in by floo nearly every day once he realized Andromeda spent most of her time in the house unable to leave because she had no one to look after Teddy. He offered to sit with him any time she needed to pop out. It led to a few close calls—Teddy nearly got stuck in the toilet their first afternoon alone. After that he shredded a few shirts and proceeded to wail like a banshee when Harry took the eviscerated remnants away. By the third day, Harry came to accept that he had no idea what to do with children and he probably never would, so he should just stop freaking out every time the kid hiccuped.
Then again, it was Luna, who was kind and probably not at all interested in Harry’s failure to please a woman sexually.
Slowly he recognized the sinking guilt, knowing that Ron and Hermione, the Weasleys, would all know eventually that he’d barred them from his home. At least until he could tell them again. Though…
He was not so happy when Ron unceremoniously kicked him out two days after his birthday—a quiet affair with Bill, Fleur, Ron, George, and Angelina. Harry had worried someone might think it odd that Ginny wasn’t with them but no one brought it up. Harry didn’t question it, he was just relieved he didn’t have to explain anything yet.
Fine. If they were satisfied, he wasn’t about to throw himself into Azkaban in protest. He hated himself for it, but he didn’t want to be punished that much. He couldn’t
She straightened up and shook her head. “The witch must have regretted it immediately, activating the reversal right away. It didn’t stop the spell from starting, though, and the swiftness of the spread was astounding. Half the building was destroyed in less than a second. It’s down to luck that no one was killed.”
The screaming in his head shifted. The ground dropped out from under him. And like a key turned in a lock, something inside him broke loose.
Eyes dry and chest tight, Harry shook his head. “No. Bill’s and Andromeda’s, you can keep, but the rest…”
Robards inclined his head, gave Harry another long, searching look. “We’ll be in touch, Mr. Potter.” He turned on his heel for the door.
Harry leaned back and rubbed his face. This was insane. All of this was done. Voldemort was dead. It didn’t matter anymore what he knew about horcruxes.
He heard the words but didn’t at first know how they were connected, it shouldn’t have mattered what Harry went through as a kid—except it did, and he was just starting to realize.
He hated that it was a lie. He hated that he understood with perfect clarity exactly what Kingsley meant when he stood there looking like the weight of the world rested on his shoulders. He didn’t want to sympathize.
Harry saw in his mind’s eye Draco leaning over a sink, face screwed up in fear as he cried in a bathroom.
“Be careful, is all,” Harry added lamely, growing more uncomfortable under Malfoy’s piercing scrutiny. “Or don’t. Whatever.”
He forced himself back to the present. It might be hard to see the resemblance to her sisters when she was laughing but sometimes he felt like he was staring into the same face reflected three times, all of them complicating until he was unsure what to feel.
Harry wasn’t sure why he was angry, or why this was making him feel like his skin was too tight for his bones, but he couldn’t get the image of Ravenna Lamar out of his head—
But as far as he knew, Malfoy had been the only death eater still under age during the war. And Malfoy had very openly defected before the end.
But the house elf had burst into tears once when Harry suggested he might make a pie on his own one night, threatening to chop his own fingers off in penance for what he assumed was a failing on his part, so Harry had assumed suggesting anything close to time off would be tantamount to torture.
Harry whipped his head around, trying to find the witch who spoke up, but it was just a sea of faces and his vision was warping as his heart hammered against his sternum. There was smoke in the air. He could smell fire—
He was saved the trouble of comparing them to the words carved into the back of his left hand by a crack, followed closely by a fussing Kreacher.
Harry stopped a few feet away from Voldemort, who had bent over and contorted his body to remain standing as he shook with the effort. Their eyes level, Harry stared into them and looked for the black eyes of the orphan everyone had feared. He looked for the boy who had grown up without parents, without love, who had fought to carve out a place for himself in a world which didn’t want him.
His eyes came to rest on the scattered notes, the worn and ill-kept books, the handwriting he could recognize even if it’d been years since he’d last seen it.
Harry did feel something at that, a little dart of pain to his heart. Right. Of course. She wasn’t stupid. She must have realized a relationship with him would never be normal or easy. Because
“Why would I joke about something like this?” Harry asked, angry. “This is serious, there’s—” He swallowed his reasoning, knowing he couldn’t tell Malfoy about the kids in Azkaban. The girl who was killed. If Malfoy was cooperating, he wouldn’t any more if he heard what the Ministry was willing to do.
He leaned against the doorframe, closing his eyes and tamping down on the mingled relief and fresh, taunting pain.
Where’s Dolores Umbridge now? In the cell next to Geraldine or Bradford? Does that seem fitting to you? How many people in this room sat in these very same seats and watched that woman silence anyone with even a shred of muggle blood? How many of you told yourselves it wasn’t your fight, that it was fine because it wasn’t happening to you, because it was easier for you to do
Harry paused with his new drink halfway to his lips, distracted by the lines of muscle that appeared in Charlie’s upper arm when he rested it on the table. “Er, that’d be odd, since I never tried for it and don’t even know who the coach is. Maybe you’re thinking of a different Harry Potter.”
Harry couldn’t help but feel a small twinge of pity. She looked so young, so thin, sitting there in her fine robes with her black hair dull and a bit mussed. He tried to imagine the same girl shouting for his capture only three months ago, and he couldn’t. All he could remember was her panicked voice, breaking, too high.
But if anything, Regulus’s notes just confirmed that no one seemed to have any bloody clue what was true or not when it came to the forces surrounding love and the soul.
everything he had left. That his ultimate utility was just to die. That his life was worth nothing unless it was being taken.
“I hadn’t realized magazine editorials counted as official court testimony.” He waited until everyone in the room was listening. “Makes me wonder why you insist on doing things like this, when it would save you plenty of time and hassle if you could just send an owl.”
he had seen Harry. He could have outed Harry and bought himself cover to do whatever he’d been trying to do with his Bombardment Charm. But he hadn’t said anything.
Harry stopped breathing. He waited. The tension solidified. The distant sound of stone crumbling echoed around the ruins of the castle. The whisper of dust slid over broken cobblestones.
It was a thin excuse, and he could tell Kingsley hadn’t missed the shift in Harry’s demeanor. But Robards seemed none the wiser. That or he didn’t care.
He looked down, clenching his hands slowly, screwing up his face. He couldn’t say anything, so he just shook his head.
The memory of fiendfyre ripped through him and it was all he could do to grit his teeth and try not to see Malfoy’s pale, terrified face as he reached down—
“Proulx wanted to bring in every member of Slytherin house, even the first years.” Malfoy smiled grimly when Harry looked up in alarm. “Apparently Robards and Shacklebolt talked him down, but the froggy bastard insisted on everyone over the age of thirteen at the time of the Battle of Hogwarts. Yeats, charming woman she is, sided with the Frenchman and in the end, who’s really going to put up a fight for a few scared Slytherins?”
empty than it should have been. The walls were higher, the floor a bit wider, and where there had been a tattered and faded runner of indeterminate color, there was just wood floor—rich and buttery and gleaming like it’d just been freshly polished.
There was something…bright about them. The small fluctuations in finger movements staccato and slight, like a bird flitting around the diagrams. By the time he got to the end of the book, his hands were cramping up and there was a throbbing between his shoulders from his hunched position. But he couldn’t stop. He felt like there was
A taut string inside him snapped, cut—and it was all he could do to keep standing. He exhaled a moan as Tom licked a stripe up his palm, strands of emerald magic swirling in the air and twisting down into the heart of him.
A weirdly hurt feeling pricked at his chest. Harry knew full well that Kreacher had only decided to start liking him recently. The business with Regulus’s locket, and then his notes, had given Harry the impression that Kreacher at least cared something for Harry.
“Sorry,” Ron said loudly, “we’re not taking Malfoy’s word seriously, right? And even if it was true,” he shrugged, “serves him right.”
Old magic like this, in his limited foreknowledge, was rooted in innate understanding and specificity of thought. To fix or clean or renew something, you needed to understand it. That’s what he thought he could make out, anyway, as the script he could now comprehend wasn’t exactly
The smell of coffee hit him first, followed closely by the sound of idle conversation, voices low and calm—the latter cut off the moment he stepped through the flames.
And you’re pissed we left you alone? Why didn’t you fucking say something instead of disappearing and shacking up with Bill and Fleur?”
He bowed forward over his legs, shoving his good hand into his hair as goosebumps erupted over every inch of his skin.
“Don’t you look snappy,” Bill said with a grin. “Dunno if I’ve ever seen you in a full piece before.”
A fog of confusion settled over him. Not unconsciousness, just disorientation. Time slipping around him, behaving in strange ways. One minute he thought he could hear Kreacher ranting, his voice sharper and angrier than Harry had ever heard it, and then there was crying, someone whispering into their hands around choked sobs. Laughter brushed through his mind, followed by the tinkle of china and the warm sounds of conversation. His own voice shouting through the cavernous house, panicked and asking for Sirius. The sound of a door slamming.
When Harry finally succumbed to sleep after a harrowing twenty-four hours of Skele-Gro, fending off Kreacher’s attempts to force feed him, the disorienting experience of passing out in thirty minute bursts only to wake with the bones of his hand attempting to wriggle out of his skin, reassuring Bill that he was, for the tenth time, perfectly fine and able to be in the house on his own, he dreamed of a white beach.
“There,” Voldemort said quietly, taking a step toward Malfoy and opening his arms, “you see, Draco, how forgiving I am? You have erred and betrayed my trust but I will allow you to repent, as your father repented for failing me.” His voice raised as he called out to the rest of the gathered crowd. “I will forgive any witch or wizard who fought here today in service to a craven boy who valued his own life over yours. Perhaps you came here in loyalty to an old, dead wizard. Albus Dumbledore is gone. Harry Potter abandoned you and now you will—”
“Give him a week and he’ll be fine,” Harry said. “I think he’s probably just disappointed he can’t keep you in his brand new flat forever.”
Calmly, a spectral line of magic shot out from his wand and formed a large stag, its antlers smoking before it shot off into the air. A body emerged from the tip of Harry’s wand, gliding up and over an invisible plane. That would be
He ran a hand through his hair, knowing there was nothing to be done for it—the messy black wave of it looked somewhat intentional. Most of it was going the same way, at least. He straightened his glasses. He didn’t look bad. He’d put back on some weight over the summer, Molly and Fleur both taking it upon themselves to shove as much food as they could at him. He was still too skinny, but at least his suit fit him now so it wasn’t so obvious. There were bags under his eyes and the shadow of stubble on his chin looked like it might be ready to grow in one of these days, but he had new, sharp shoes and his white collar was clean. He looked—older. Not quite like his dad in the pictures he had sitting on his bedside table, but closer than ever before, his skin a paler brown and his hair a deeper shade of black, his face growing longer to reflect his dad’s impressive jaw line.
“I was—her husband, Remus, was…” Harry swallowed as heat rose up his throat. He blinked furiously, trying not to start crying again. “He was good friends with my dad, and he taught me at school. We were—close.”
Late and trying to pull himself together, he went to the fireplace. He shook his hands out, grimacing at a small twinge in his left, braced himself, and stepped through the floo while saying clearly, “Gracemorrow Cottage.”
Harry didn’t know if he pitied the man for thinking a little courage would change things, or if he envied him to have that kind of faith in the people he worked with.
“They are threatening kids,” Harry said steadily. “They are using teenagers as collateral to make sure their parents behave. Most of whom didn’t even fight during the war. How can you justify that?”
They flashed before his eyes like a strobing marquee. Every single one of them wanted something from him and he couldn’t— He didn’t have anything—
she murmured. Her hands were remarkably steady and the magic that washed into him was soft and warm.
They were the records of someone trying very hard to learn how and where he spent his time. Someone who had watched him for weeks and weeks before they finally made their move. He knew Goyle had known enough to seek him out in the park. It only made sense he’d put in some work.
He tried to smile. “I think you have the wrong idea about my life. Believe me. It’s not that exciting.” He finished drying the plate, putting it down slowly so it didn’t clank with the slight tremble in his hand. “I want to be here for him,” he finally said, softly. “I know I won’t—I’m not trying to interfere, and if this is overstepping, shove me out on my arse and I’ll leave you alone but…” He swallowed, the growing warmth in Andromeda’s eyes almost unbearable. “I want you to know that I take this—being Teddy’s godfather—seriously. So however you want me in his life, that’s fine. I just…”
He walked toward the hill from where Robards was just now disapparating. He didn’t bother to look back to make sure that Kingsley was following. The chill was brisk, almost uncomfortable, but he welcomed it on his bare skin, his t-shirt riding up in a sudden gust of wind.
He looked around, suddenly registering the fact that he was lying in the middle of a park, hurt so bad he probably couldn’t walk—and there was a dead body in front of him. There was a dead body in front of him and he was—he’d almost—
Harry blinked. “Oh. That makes sense, actually.” At Andromeda’s raised brow, he added, “I found it in Sirius’s stuff. It was hanging round a dash ornament.”
It was all still there. The posters, the records, the clothes and the trunks and the broken quills and crinkled toffee wrappers. Cigarette butts sat in the stained glass dish on the bedside table—an heirloom, had to be, it was crystal, and Sirius would have gotten a kick out of using something that valuable as a glorified bin—and the blanket Harry had curled up in that first night back here only a month ago was still stretched across the foot of the four poster bed, gold and red and threadbare.
which was published in 1890 and, though it mentioned the Fidelius Charm, it was only in passing and to suggest that any wizard wishing to guard his home from prying eyes might do better with a suite of Discrete Decency Charms, as shielding one’s home made it rather more difficult to entertain guests. He read and re-read the old spell in the ancient book, gleaning a bit of comprehension from his work with the blood rituals to cleanse the house. Again, it seemed to come down to intention here, and strength of will. More than once he had the painful thought that Hermione would have hated this. It felt a lot like Snape’s notes in
Harry took a deep breath and turned, trying not to grimace at the squeak of his trainers over the slick tile floor.
Part of him wondered if Bill was right, but he knew Hermione and Ron would drop everything if he asked. Even after his fight with Hermione, he knew that. How many times had they done the same? How many times had they insisted on joining Harry even when he knew they’d be safer if they just kept away? Wasn’t that the reason he’d broken things off with Ginny in the first place, why he’d kept quiet about the horcruxes even when people he loved and respected tried to help? He’d sent Remus away for the same reason, refused to tell Bill or Molly or Arthur what he’d been planning.
It wasn’t the first time Andromeda had shown him this kind of physical affection, but Harry still didn’t know how to handle it. Teddy was one thing. He was a baby and babies were grabby little monsters. But Harry had never learned how to not feel like he was about to jump out of his skin whenever someone did something like that—absently touching him, hugging him. He still felt that way with Ron sometimes when he gave Harry a playful shove. Or, he
He massaged his shoulder, rolling out his arms as he rotated his neck, reaffirming that each body part still worked. There were faint scars on each forearm, but they weren’t angry. They looked long healed over, like he’d had them for years. Even so, the blood magic must have nearly drained him.
“Oh, stop it.” Harry frowned, reaching for the cup of coffee Kreacher set down for him. “You asked. That’s what I want. Treacle tart too. If you’re up for it.”
Harry’s chest tightened. There was fear in that voice. It was even more familiar now, hitting some tender part of him he hadn’t prodded in a long time.
“We’re all cracking, Harry,” Ron said after a long pause, voice choked. “We all went through the same war, mate. I know you’re hurting—”
Kamau just smiled and winked at him, flicking her gaze to Bill and then, presumably, Andromeda where she was standing in the kitchen doorway.
His eyes were raw. His throat burned. His guilt came back with a vengeance, like fiendfyre surging up in his chest.
The hawthorn wand sat in his pocket, Harry hyperaware of its presence as he watched Narcissa speaking to Lucius, her hands never leaving her son’s arm or knee or shoulders for longer than a few seconds. Like Malfoy would disappear if she didn’t keep her hands on him. She had the look of someone exercising full control over her emotions, face set and cold and frightening in its severity. She didn’t look like a woman who had just lost her sister. Whose
Harry’s hands clenched, pulse kicking up as he heard Yeats thank Hermione for her testimony and dismiss her. He wanted to think Hermione was only being honest, that there was nothing more to her statement, but he couldn’t help but hear a note of accusation directed toward him. As gentle a reminder as she could give him in the midst of so many other eyes.
“I…sorry,” Harry muttered, closing the door, “didn’t realize. I was upstairs.” The silence sealed shut and they were left in what felt like a small bubble. A pocket of tension. Harry wanted nothing more than to lie down and sleep for another three days, but he knew this had to happen sometime. Might as well do it now.
He looked down before Kingsley could read his face, frowning as he shifted some of the papers away with one hand while he held Teddy. He’d dropped the bracelet in favor of Harry’s jacket and seemed to be trying to shove his head inside the arm hole.
He closed his eyes, surrender in the sagging release of his body. Anything, anything for this… He opened his mouth—
Voldemort’s magic slammed down and cut off all noise. The courtyard hummed with it. But Harry could almost feel the places where Voldemort’s magic was weak. He could almost see the places where the threads frayed—the places he might tug, or rip.
Voldemort’s curse hit Harry’s shield and detonated. A massive wave of air and force sent those nearest toppling over into their fellows. Green shadows danced up toward the sky now turning a violent shade of orange and red. Draco looked up in panic, stumbling as he came back to the battle. He looked like he had no idea where he was or what was happening. He looked young and scared.
It still slipped through, though, even if he knew they never meant it. He’d catch a look of awe in their eyes, a slight nervousness in the way they said something to him, or about him. He was the one who made plans, not joined them. He was the one at the front. Even with Ron and Hermione, he was the odd one out. But it had been all right. He’d taken it, knowing that one day everyone would realize he was just as stupid and weak and flawed as everyone else. More so, probably.
Kingsley’s eyes closed, and it was like his whole body shrank. Fatigue settled on his shoulders. Harry could see the tension all over him, the pain in the crease of his brow. He looked like he was barely holding himself together.
Harry held Malfoy’s gaze until people stepped out of the Great Hall—Ron, Bill, Ginny, followed by Narcissa. He couldn’t look at any of them, only Malfoy. He glared down at Malfoy and fought to keep hold of his anger, to keep hold of himself.
He fought the urge to look over his shoulder to check if Ron was coming back with the drinks. “You, er, haven’t spoken to Ginny in a while, have you?”
is the only person you’re talking to now.” He shook his head, desperation and pain in his eyes. “Seriously, Harry, this isn’t like you. You don’t hurt people just because you’re upset.”
Harry reflexively clenched his left hand. His shock quickly transformed into something else, but he felt paralyzed. It took him a moment to find his voice, and when he did it was flat. “You have to come in every day?”
things. Ron was already there, seeming perfectly content to settle into working at the shop with George. Hermione had a year to travel and throw herself into projects while she waited to return to Hogwarts.
He looked up. He stared at his own reflection. Without his glasses he was just a blur of colors. A shivering mass of shapes. He knew what he would see, though, if he could. Red-rimmed eyes, shaking hands, face screwed up as he cried into a sink. He didn’t have the same pale skin and white-blonde hair, but he could have been Malfoy—leaning over a sink in the bathroom trying not to fall apart.
A man approached them, furiously gesturing at Malfoy. He wore, Harry saw with a frown, the uniform of an auror even if he looked no older than Harry or Malfoy. “The hell you doing just loitering down—” The man’s eyes widened as they fell on Harry. Malfoy made a small, disgusted noise beside him.
A few days before his birthday—after repeating for the umpteenth time to Molly through Shell Cottage’s floo that he didn’t want a party, that he appreciated the gesture, but he just wanted something quiet, a drink in a pub with a few friends and nothing more, she’d finally let it go, to Harry’s immense relief—he was surprised by the extra voice he heard in the kitchen when he came in from his dusk stroll. That in and of itself wouldn’t be a cause for alarm—Bill and Fleur had people over every now and again.
“Please,” Malfoy snapped, anger flaring, “shout it louder so everyone can hear, because there couldn’t possibly be anyone who might take issue with me cooperating with the people throwing them in
He paused, seeming to gather himself. “So you’re going to explain it to me, because I’m not going anywhere until you do.” His voice flipped into something frantic, eyes wide. “Is it a pride thing? Do you feel like you have to be the bigger person or something? Because you don’t. They don’t deserve that, and you know it.”
Harry stared at the rug between his bare feet, counting the rings of rough-spun wool where they looped over one another—orange to red to brown to mauve and then back to orange, all of it spiraling in a uniform, constricting oval. It was faded and worn through. Well-loved.
“I’m sure one of the Weasleys told you we would be bringing in outside help to make sure there’s no bias going into these trials,” Robards said as he sat down. “Today is just a preliminary questioning. If I or my two colleagues decide the Wizengamot needs to hear your official testimony, we’ll ask you to stand in front of the full council.”
“Not all of us wanted—,” she said too quickly, pausing. Her face went red but she held his gaze. “We weren’t all on—
Harry laughed, shifting in his chair, color warming his neck. “Right. ‘Good.’ The last two I met nearly killed me.”
After the initial statements and the long, tedious procedures, he listened to Hermione give her testimony first. He tried not to hear the telltale sign of tears in her voice, the slight shake most people would chalk up to nerves, but Harry knew better. Harry knew Hermione like she was his sister and he knew when she was putting it on to get through something she deemed important, urgent.
“Yes, yes,” the woman began digging in her bag, which was the exact same color as her lipstick, “of course!”
“Harry’s about to unload all his problems unto us. Serious topics require serious beverages.” He nodded at Harry. “You want another? Shot of firewhisky?”
Harry struggled for a moment, not sure, exactly, how to explain what he was feeling. Could he tell them about the kids in Azkaban, about Ravenna Lamar?
Ron set his drink down hard on the table. “Well, why didn’t you just say that first? That git would ruin anything.”
Kreacher shot him an offended look. “Master is meaning to insult poor Kreacher, asking him if he can’t make pumpkin pasties!”
He shouldn’t be both. Either he was a broken shell of a person or he was whole and hurting. He wasn’t natural, he was something horrifying, but he was still screaming inside just like a normal human, and he didn’t know
More tears built behind his eyelids. His fingers dug into lean muscle under fine cloth as he framed the shape of this person, this visitor, fit his hands over ribs which were heaving. He found an elegant neck and a chest that tapered smoothly into a firm waist. He smelled deep, warm spice and dark berries like wine and it was all he could do not to press forward and bury his face in it, in
Harry gripped the banister, listening to Ron pace for a while—and then the door opened, the sound of wind and cars and the city beyond rushing into this space of grim silence.
Harry had the distant thought that Hermione would have been thrilled to watch the process. The thought snagged as he remembered her tear-stained face, her shaking voice.
Across the atrium he saw Malfoy’s jaw feather, his lips purse. Harry waited, hoping Malfoy didn’t make a scene and cause Harry to regret listening to him.
Nothing happened. No footsteps. Not even the shallow breath of someone terrified for their life. Malfoy’s face in the Room of Requirement flooded his mind, pale with fear and shock and reflecting the flames surging up to grab him. He tried to picture Malfoy kneeling and groveling just like his father as he tried to explain his actions and beg forgiveness. But another image—Malfoy’s face tight and close before his in the shadows of his home as he bent down to get a closer look at Harry, eyes flooding with conflict and the beginnings of defiance.
But there were still hundreds of people out there waiting to grab any piece of him they could snatch up and slap a headline on. -
So he got up, showered, organized his things to see what he’d brought with him and what he’d left at the Burrow and Shell Cottage, and sat down to write to Andromeda and Bill. As the two pieces of parchment were swallowed up in the floo, he struggled for a moment about whether he should write Hermione and Ron.
She went bright red and spluttered. “I—I’m sure you’re thinking of someone else, young man. And I must say, this is no way to—”
It ended between the space of one breath and the next. The magic and the light died as the final shrieks and haunting notes of the bond between them faded out.
He needed to get down to the courtrooms, to recount, once again, how thoroughly he’d been broken by this war, how many people he’d lost. One after the other. Like candles winking out in a looming darkness.
Harry beat back the voice telling him to abandon this insane idea at once, facing off against the plant like it was a rival player and they were high above a Quidditch pitch. He shook out his hands, bounced a bit on the balls of his feet, and began.
“There’s a reason I’m drinking ale right now,” Harry said with a smile. He laughed as she screwed up her face and mock gagged. “You know you don’t have to drink if you don’t want to.”
Ron snorted darkly. “And you thought I’d leave before you had to drag yourself down here, didn’t you?”
He was just—nervous, maybe. He was just—inventing things. He’d had fits so often over his life, maybe this was just another…
Malfoy’s name made his stomach knot. He had thought about the git more than he would have liked over the summer, unable to forget that horrible expression on his face the last time Harry had seen him.
He had known Harry was alive in the courtyard, and if his plan was always to attack Voldemort, he had done it
Would he have done the same to her? He’d seen people under the Imperius Curse, under a love potion. He couldn’t believe what he’d done was anything close to that.
And all the while that thing had been lurking down here with him, scaring the spiders, watching him so intently Harry felt like it was breathing down his neck. Every once in a while he swore he heard a low, rough sound, like grinding stone or a growl.
“Right. Sorry.” She grimaced. “It was very lucky I showed up, but even then, I would have had no idea how to stop it from the outside. I’m not sure
She fell to the ground in a heap of torn black skirts and spindly limbs. Harry thought he should feel something—she was dead, the woman who had killed his godfather was dead, but—
“Don’t go,” Harry gasped, stepping forward. He reached out and caught lean arms, slender shoulders, the edge of a soft, unbuttoned collar. “Don’t go. Stay.”
He cast a quick look around the atrium, but it was mostly empty. People were sending him and Malfoy interested looks, but there was no one around who could hear their conversation and no one seemed eager to approach him right that second.
Her brow twitched, surprise taking over her features. “I… Fina’s been through a lot. I hope you’re not—”
“Yeah, they’re both in Azkaban,” Bill said. “Robards thought it would be a death sentence to throw them in with the other death eaters while waiting for their trial, but he was shouted down. Yeats wouldn’t hear it. Wouldn’t be surprised if they get moved, though, after the trials.”
His eyes were half-closed and blank, his jaw broken, and his neck twisted too far around. He was staring just over Harry’s shoulder. Blood dripped over his open lips from what must have been a nosebleed.
Wrapping his head around this was hard. He wasn’t naturally inclined to this kind of spellwork, trying to run variables and permutations in his head of all the components of a basic spell with near infinite number of outcomes and reconfiguring them to work in ways which were not explicit in their casting. He usually just pointed his wand, said the right words, and magic came out, which he was quickly realizing had made him lazy. When that didn’t work, he fell back on just—doing it. Instinctually. Without any kind of intention. He was good at magic. Very good at defensive magic. He hadn’t needed to pour into the theory often because he’d been able to do almost everything without understanding how it worked, and those things he’d had to work for, like his patronus, or apparition, he’d just kept trying until he could do it. Simple trial and error.
who Dumbledore asked to keep me alive, a man who couldn’t look at me without wanting to spit in my face! He took out his childhood grudge on
“I appreciate your candor, Mr. Potter,” Robards said at last, steadily. “You should know that the Ministry is firmly aware of how much it owes you. I don’t just speak for myself when I say that many of us regret how you were treated in the past, and are dedicated to correct those mistakes.”
Robards didn’t look at all disturbed, but nodded. “It seems whatever magic you performed, your wand didn’t register it. I’m inclined to believe Ms. Kamau, that it was simply an act of unconscious, uncontrolled magic.”
what she did. She was a kid. A child. And they killed her. If you think that’s fine, great, bully for you, but I will not accept that and I sure as hell won’t dance around and smile for the people who would justify doing that. I won’t stand there and let them use me as a fucking prop. I get enough of that from everyone else
The silence was unbearable. Grimmauld Place was almost too quiet now. There was no rattle of pipes or creaking of wood. No odd noises coming behind closed doors unopened for decades, brushes of fabric and tiny whispers that could have been mice or wind slipping through the cracked windows. Only two years ago this house had reluctantly held plenty of people, most coming and going, but
He hummed as he gripped himself, sliding down his shaft slowly and thumbing the head, hissing when he ran the side of a nail across his slit. He didn’t do this often, for some reason. Maybe he’d thought it was indulgent or something. Or maybe it was that lingering religious fear his aunt had tried to hammer into him every Sunday—that was, before he’d turned eight and they’d had to switch churches because the pastor had noticed Harry one day and asked Petunia why he looked so sickly and small when his cousin practically oozed excessive health.
The entire room flinched. Harry took a cruel, vindictive pleasure in the shock and outrage on the faces of the old witches and wizards in the Wizengamot. Kingsley, too, cracked his first expression of the day—a small frown, a furrowed brow. He saw Hermione shift out of the corner of his eye, as if she were about to stand up.
He moved fast, too fast for Harry to follow. A flick of his arm—and a wand slid from Malfoy’s sleeve. He gripped it in his long, pale fingers, knuckles standing out white. He wrenched back from Voldemort as if propelled by an invisible force. Before Malfoy opened his mouth, a look of pure and unadulterated hatred twisted his fine, pointed features into a snarl. He leveled his wand directly at Voldemort’s chest.
He was confused. He was tired. He’d just done some seriously dangerous blood magic and his mind was a bit wonky. Or, wonkier than usual. It wasn’t…
Harry’s left hand fell to his thigh. He held his wand so tight his fingers began to cramp. His right was lying useless on the ground. He stared at Goyle’s body. His breathing grew shallow as the silence seemed to layer itself over him.
“They are. A little rattled, and more than a bit upset with me, obviously, but fine. I meant my father’s family in Lagos. Apparently my great aunt is putting together some kind of reunion in October, and I’ve never spent much time with them. I mean, obviously, they’re all muggles, but… My dad’s been mentioning it constantly. I think he really wants me to go with him.” She shrugged, pushing back her sleek brown hair and playing with one of her earrings.
Harry had always been other, outside. ‘Special’ was the word Kingsley’d used, wasn’t it? He’d been able to convince himself sometimes that he wasn’t so distanced from everyone else. He’d had Ron and Hermione, Ginny and the rest of the Weasleys, his friends—all of them had gone out of their way to treat him like he was just another kid. Most of the time anyway.
At this, Harry had a long walk around the attic, wandering aimlessly through the stacks as he thought of Frank and Alice Longbottom, their distant stares and broken minds.
As Harry met his gaze, Kingsley’s eyes tightened long enough for Harry to see the guilt flash through them. To see the regret in those steady, unbeatable eyes.
As if it could hear him, the plant rustled, a few of the flowers turning toward him and doing something like a dance. That scent wafted over him again, and this time he found it pleasantly warm. He cleared his throat as it became too strong, growing smoky again and carrying a thread of spice and citrus, reminding him for some reason of tea and mist and leather.
It sounded like it came from just behind him. Harry turned but with an unsettling shift the world turned with him. He spun around again. The light fractured as a noise like a whine cut through the stillness.
Ron exhaled slowly, closing his eyes as if for patience. “Fucking hell, Harry, this is a lot. Even for you.”
He nearly missed it as he walked through the main hall, but an odd prickle at the back of his neck made him stop and turn. For a second he didn’t see anything amiss, but then his eyes stuck on the place where Walburga Black’s portrait hung.
“He’s not wrong, Harry,” Hermione murmured, looking just as incredulous as Ron. “He deserves to be watched. You of all people should know that.”
“Was the questioning that bad?” Hermione asked, leaning forward to prop her elbows on the table. “You really do look awful.”
“Oh, my dear,” she said, somewhat choked up, “you sweet boy. Of course you can. I just didn’t want you to feel obligated. You’re so young. I’m—I’m so happy to raise Teddy, but I wouldn’t want you to feel guilty for not taking care of a child when you’re barely more than that.”
“You heard about the firefight.” Malfoy exhaled softly, incredulity in his voice. “You did, didn’t you?”
“No,” Harry said forcefully, stepping toward Ron, “keep going. What were about to say? That I was playing the hero? That I’m just having a temper tantrum and
“It’s all right,” she continued, voice flat and casual. “I don’t blame you. I knew what I was getting into with you, so…”
“That’s rather extraordinary.” Kamau smiled up at Teddy in Bill’s arms, who was currently shifting through hair colors. “What a charmer.”
“All right,” Ron said slowly, “so this Proulx was an arse. Kamau was nice. And Robards practically offered you a job.”
The whole bloody world was waiting for him to lose it, and he was starting to wonder why the fuck he was trying to pretend otherwise.
Feeling the silence behind him more acutely now he no longer had Teddy as an excuse, he cleared his throat and turned.
He was sitting in her house, wearing what must have been her late husband’s clothes, clutching a blanket which had probably belonged to Tonks, with his godson in his crib only six feet away, and he’d killed someone only a few hours ago.
Harry heard truth in the old man’s words. It was refreshing, coming from the Ministry. Even if it was undercut by Harry’s growing desire to get out of this room and never come back into this cursed building.
He gasped for air as his cock softened, watching a few valiant spurts of cum wash over his hand and slip down the drain. When he was spent, he reached out blindly and turned the heat down, letting the cool water drill some sense into him. He breathed until the steam was gone from the air and he didn’t feel like he was going to fall over if he tried to move.
He crossed to the little table sitting by the wall and scratched out two notes, one for Andromeda and one for Bill, letting them know he was all right, and not to worry if they’d suddenly forgotten where he lived. He’d already set up an enchantment on his floo to hide the location of his fireplace but keep it connected to the larger network, and it didn’t stop him from sending things out. The enchantment was tedious though, and it required him checking regularly for any incoming letters. He should think about getting an owl. For some complicated reason no one had ever been able adequately explain to him, owls, the special ones which carried wizard post and parcels, didn’t need to know the exact location of a person to deliver mail. One could hide oneself from an owl through a variety of different kinds of spells, but the owl couldn’t convey the address to the person sending mail even if it wanted to.
“Of course not. She just came home and burst into tears and blamed herself and told me you wanted nothing to do with her and I, that you picked a fight with Kingsley over
“Do whatever the fuck you want with the wand,” he said in choked, broken words, blinking away tears. He had been empty and frustrated for hours and now, finally, he was unraveling. Losing it. In front of
Ron’s mouth was hanging open when Harry turned back around. “The bloody hell is wrong with you? You’re not actually upset about this, are you?”
Summoning his last bit of willpower to be polite, he put on his glasses and straightened up. An elderly woman’s face came into focus, her lips painted a garish neon pink and her hair shifting colors from orange to white then back to orange like a demented swirling ice cream.
The first reference to horcruxes by name didn’t come until the fifth page of notes, and even here it seemed as if Regulus were performing a thought experiment. Harry caught passages which reminded him of
The stable dropped away in a dizzying rush of darkness. He was nowhere, caught in that unreal space of unconsciousness and dreaming, standing in a vast black space as endless as the sky. He wasn’t alone.
“It’s not that cut and dry,” Kamau said, her big black eyes studying him closely. “But yes, essentially. We dealt with something similar back in the States in the 80’s. Potions meant to replicate lycanthropy, vampirism, even a few folks trying to grow themselves wings. Didn’t work out well for them, I’m afraid. I have a bit of experience in this field, so I was asked to consult by Mr. Robards. Hope that’s okay,” she added with a comforting smile.
He’d been running his thumb over his wand, the little groove in the wood where he’d mended it with the Elder Wand—when he felt something splinter ever so slightly.
He didn’t want this to be true. Most of the time he could convince himself his feelings had had nothing to do with expediency or necessity or obligation. It was too fucked up, too cruel, to imagine the only reason he had ever liked Ginny is because he thought he
Harry stared at Malfoy like he’d transformed into a different person. He was just—talking. Like someone normal. No sneer or smirk, no attempt at coming off smart or slick. His expression was mild, open, almost like this was a normal occurence.
Robards took the same chair he’d occupied before while Kingsley took the one next to him. It put them both on the opposite side of the room as Harry, who had no choice but to sit on the couch as Teddy squirmed and began to protest the sudden change of position.
Felicity Burbage leaned forward, an awkward twist to her mouth. “This is where I come in. Not just here for kicks, right?” She cleared her throat and continued, more solidly, “Four hours ago, at approximately one in the morning, our office received word that a small explosion had gone off in the center of London, near St. Andrew’s Gardens.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “I feel…like I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing.” He made himself look up and meet Bill’s knowing gaze. “I’m just hanging around waiting for someone to tell me what I’m allowed to do, I guess.”
“Harry,” Hermione said sharply, her eyes fixed on the table, “stop it. You know that’s not what Ron meant.”
Harry stared in alarm. He could not think of one other time Malfoy had ever laughed at something Harry’d said. He’d laughed
he told himself, dousing the fire, dispelling the floo shut, and putting the quill and parchment away. He would, one day. When there was no danger of them risking their lives to protect him. They might be angry with him, in fact he knew they’d be angry with him, but if it kept them safe, he’d take their ire.
Still, Dumbledore had been right about Malfoy, in the end. He had turned. He had helped Harry. He had nearly died himself more than once.
It was the only thing that made sense. Harry must have truly died in the Forbidden Forest as well. He’d come back due to a weird and inexplicable quirk of magic no one understood, but for a tiny, infinitesimal moment, his soul had no longer been connected to his body. It explained the lapse in time between Voldemort cursing him and waking on the forest floor. He’d been dead.
And it wasn’t as if Ginny asked him to stay. She had never asked him for anything, really. Maybe that was why he needed to leave. Because out of all the things he had abandoned in his search for the horcruxes, all the things which seemed to be lost for good, his feelings for her, his
The name smacked into him like a fist, what little composure he’d managed to regain gone in a sharp, painful exhale. He didn’t know who he’d been expecting, but not another one of his classmates… He
Through the overwhelming sensation of pain in every part of his body, Harry felt one of Goyle’s hands wrap around his throat and
why the Wizengamot asked me and Hermione Granger here today, because you need people who everyone admires to agree with you to make it look like you’ve got your act together. Get a few war heroes in here to support your policies and it’s a lot easier to pretend you’re making things better. Pity, then, that I happen to disagree. I’ve got a bit of a soft spot for kids, you see. I happen to think using them to scare their parents and families into cooperation feels a bit wrong.”
“None of that,” Andromeda chided him gently, her gaze knowing as she lifted Teddy and handed him over to Harry. “You’re here now. No need to punish yourself.”
Kreacher stared at him, milky eyes going wide and, to Harry’s horror, wet. “Oh-oh, is Master Harry finding fault with Kreacher’s tidying up?”
He caught Kingsley’s searching gaze and waited, but it seemed the Minister had nothing more to say to him. That, or he didn’t think Harry would want to hear it.
Before Harry could blink, Kreacher grabbed the hand still pressed awkwardly to his shoulder and disapparated. The sensation of being squeezed through a very small hole was oddly not as nauseating as normal. Maybe it was something to do with house-elf magic.
Ron stared, his eyes narrowed and his mouth slightly open. “Are you saying you ordered him to keep back all your mail?”
After a long pause, Kreacher snapped his fingers and a stack of books appeared on the desk, followed closely by a few reams of parchment.
“And he did all of this to you in only a few seconds?” Robards asked, eyes hard as they remained fixed on Harry’s face. His quill continued to scribble in sharp, compact cursive. Harry’d given up trying to read what it said after a few seconds. He’d just have to hope that Robards was more dedicated to the truth than Rita Skeeter.
A fog covered his senses as he swam up from what felt like a deep, horrendously dark pool. Watery sounds rushed around him, muted and echoed. There was something around his ankle—a hand, a manacle? A voice, low and lovely and unnerving whispered into his ear. A dull, aching sense of approaching consciousness swelled but he didn’t want to go back, he wanted to stay down in the water—and then he woke up.
The memory of Christmas night standing in front of his parents’s grave stood out sharply in his mind.
Narcissa’s voice rang out above the crowd, shattering the tense space between Draco and his aunt. Bellatrix spun around in shock and fury, eyes wide—
Feeling like an idiot, he contacted the woman who sold him the flat and made sure she wasn’t sharing his address with anyone. When she assured him that all of the other tenants were under the same magically binding contract which prohibited any of them from sharing any of their names or addresses, he felt slightly better.
It really wasn’t, but it wasn’t so abnormal either. Plenty of wizards lost control of their magic from time to time, in situations of extreme danger or fatigue—like mothers lifting cars off children. When pushed, magic could express itself in all sorts of volatile ways.
“You’d be under the protection of the entirety of the Aurors’ Office. There isn’t anywhere more secure—”
Harry held his gaze, torn between wanting to listen and let that be enough, but he couldn’t. Not because he didn’t know how he felt about Kingsley’s presence, but because that
“Obviously upset.” Ron responded with food still in his mouth, “she had just broken up with…” Ron stopped abruptly when he saw that both Harry and Hermione were staring at him, saying “please stop talking or you’ll make this worse”.
After walking past what seemed like all the bars south of the Thames, Harry was starting to regret his decision of trying to find a bar that interested him as he was starting to lose the battle with his emotions. Many of the bars he passed that he had passed were probably adequate. They all probably served decent alcohol that could get Harry off his nerves. Maybe this was a really bad decision, Harry thought. Maybe he should have just gone straight to Ron and Hermione’s, Ron probably had a bottle of Firewhiskey on hand, even if while drinking Hermione would give him the evil glare as well as the face of a comforting friend.
“Most likely. I know I don’t like Malfoy or anything,” Harry started before Ron huffed a sound of amused laughter, “but it is strange how he suddenly reappears into my life on the night that I broke up with Ginny and be at the first gay bar I’ve ever been too.”
Malfoy’s drink appeared, he paid, drank up quickly then took to the dance floor. It looked like a routine that he had done that thousands of times. The beat of the next song started to pick up and Malfoy joined the wave of dancers.
“The train station, just a few minutes up the road.” He had told Ron and Hermione that he would crash there again.
After being pulled upright, Ron felt Harry and most presumably returned to the kitchen. Although the hangover potion did its magic, it didn’t cure Harry’s tiredness even though he must have slept for at least 8 hours. He held his heavy head in his hands and rubbed his eyes continuously, trying to wake himself up. Harry felt the sofa dip next to him.
When he was rather nervous, Harry would usually play with his hair, a tick that had come up since Auror training. It was a little hard to ruffle his hair as his now sandy brown hair was much shorter. Harry had asked Hermione to get a bit of hair from one of her co-workers at St. Mungos. With a little persuasion, mainly from Ron telling her that he will only do this once to get over the whole Malfoy fiasco, she managed to get some hair from one of her fellow medi wizards.
“Even if you finish getting your things quickly Harry, we still have to wait for Hermione and Ginny to finish.” Harry continued diving into the cupboard.
“Whiskey please.” Harry imagined Ben to be polite when asking for something. He didn’t really know though, he’d never met the man.
“Like I said, you should probably stop drinking.” His voice dropped dangerously low. “I don’t want to see you, or your stupid scarred face in this place ever again.”
“Like I said, I don’t want to see you around here again” and with that, Malfoy removed himself from Harry’s presence, took the other man’s outstretched hand and walked towards the exit.
Malfoy pressed his chest against Harry’s back and his arms slid around Harry’s body. There was a sudden moment of tension in Harry’s body. No one had ever done this before, not even Ginny, his one and only past lover. It felt nice. It didn’t feel like a death grip. It didn’t feel like someone was trying to strangle him or kidnap him. It felt like someone was looking after him, making sure that he felt alright. Comfortable even. Harry relaxed into Malfoy’s arms, putting a bit more of his weight onto Malfoy’s shoulder. As soon as he felt him relax, Malfoy pressed his entire body behind Harry and started swaying from side to side. His hands had now moved to his waist with one hand stroking his side. Harry moved with him, his body starting to actually dance instead of move like a robot. The music kept a steady beat and Harry and Malfoy swayed in time. Then, Malfoy did something that Harry didn’t quite expect. His hips started moving upwards, against Harry’s. Oh my god, Harry thought. Harry didn’t want to tense up, especially at this point, he didn’t want to break character nor stop Malfoy because it felt really good.
“Everything was great in my life, until you showed your bloody face and then everything that followed fucked up. I don’t need you to ruin this up for me when I am actually enjoying myself and in a position where I’m finally happy”
“Need to freshen up.” He said quietly, making his way to the bathroom, pretending he didn’t hear what Ron had just said.
“Goodnight Harry.” Hermione said as she walked down the small corridor with Ron following her at the heel.
Harry woke up to the feeling of cool leather underneath him. It was the same leather sofa that he had slept on on numerous occasions, most common being that he was drunk and couldn’t make it home safely. His senses were starting to wake up as he could now smell bacon and eggs wafting through their flat. He could hear the distant traffic outside and Ron and Hermione mumbling to each other. Harry, very slowly, opened his eyes and immediately shut them as the bright light coming from the window was blinding and was starting to increase his headache tenfold which had also woken up. He could now sense someone was kneeling in front of the sofa, trying to get his attention.
“That’s the thing. Malfoy told me that I shouldn’t go back to that bar ever again and he will probably be on the lookout for me.” Harry said, a hint of sadness in his voice.
Harry sat at the bar on an empty bar stool, looking around at the dance floor, the scenery, feeling quite put out. His vibe must be very noticeable as the barman, after serving a couple, came up behind him.
“Hermione. Shhhhh” Ron groggily said, raising himself from the sofa. Both him and Hermione had pyjamas on, meaning they stayed up all night waiting for Harry. That thought touched Harry a little bit.
Coming home from his Auror work, with a heavy heart, Harry knew what he had to do (not necessarily on his to-do list that he attached to the front of his fridge, but important nonetheless). He had recently found out that he was gay though over the course of time, Harry has wondered if he always knew he was gay but was just to afraid to admit it. Admit it to friends, to Ginny. But he knew that the time in his relationship with Ginny was up and that it needed to end. Walking through the fireplace of their shared apartment after a very long day at work, he startled Ginny as she was sitting on the sofa in front of it. She opened her mouth to say her greetings but Harry quickly rushed to the bedroom to get changed out of his Auror uniform and to ready himself for the onslaught ahead. Changing into his most comfy jeans and a red t-shirt, he slowly walked back to the open plan living area (Harry preferred open spaces so he knew and felt like he wasn’t confined to such a small space, like his childhood cupboard). Ginny was already standing and staring at him, the look on her face will always remain engraved into his brain. It made him feel guilty.
