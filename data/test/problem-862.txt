Glancing up at the sky he saw the first light of dawn — they’ve already been back in time for eight hours.
He brought the slice of bread to his mouth, dragging the flat of his tongue along it slowly, eyes still fixed on Draco. Then he put it down on the table and picked a strawberry, dipped it in the melted chocolate and lifted it to his lips, smearing them with the chocolate before flicking his tongue out to lick his lips clean.
Their hands flew all over their bodies, exploring, touching, finally having each other, their lips releasing litanies of love, brushing on each other over and over again.
"It probably rebounded in some way. It could have also damaged Jacob's magical core for all we know, this bond requires a high level of accuracy to cast. Boo-boo, please check his movements."
Harry mounted also and as they flew into the sky looked to see Boo-boo happily floating behind them, with a gleeful smile.
Hermione and Geremia's hands quickly darted up, in an 'obviously' gesture, reminding Harry of Snape.
Harry got up, rushing to the bedroom, knowing when the moment was to stop pushing Malfoy. He sat on the bed and waited, not knowing what Malfoy would be up to this time.
Just when Harry’s ready to call it off and go back from where he came and demand Zabini to just explain himself, Goyle spots him and raises a hand. “Potter! Oi, Potter!”
But the sight that really stole Harry’s breath away was Draco crouched in front of the wider wall, a brush in his hand, completely splashed with paint, a concentrated frown on his face.
“Okay now you’re starting to piss me off!” Harry straightened up, painfully aware of his empty stomach. “Tell me what’s happening!”
-Distant? Me? No offence, but I’m sure that if I was suddenly to disappear, it would take you and Ron at least a couple of days to even notice that,-Harry’s mouth once again outran his brain. Hermione starred at him in shock. She wanted to say something, but before she could, a loud thud was heard down from the field. Harry immediately got to his feet and looked down.
-I mean...no one would hire me anyway,-he said, for now only opening up about the least of his concerns.
-No. Neither does…Malfoy,-Harry made a half second pause before “Malfoy” as his first name almost slipped out of his mouth.
Harry didn’t care. That attack he accidentally witnessed made him ten times more interested in Draco’s life and condition. What he knew was that his father’s sentence in Azkaban wouldn’t let him see his son anytime soon, and his mother had been MIA ever since the end of the war. Harry didn’t believe that a woman like Narcissa, the I-will-risk-my-life-and-lie-to-Voldemort-to-save-my-son one, could just abandon him. But still, Malfoy was obviously very lonely and needed someone to help him cope with everything he had been, and still is going through. At least that’s what Harry thought.
-Potter, do you expect me to have my whole future figured out after a 30 minutes talk?-Draco asked. Harry rolled his eyes.
-What are you even doing here?-Ron asked. Hermione approached him, trying to calm him down, but that rarely worked out,-Came to look after your new best friend?-heat touched his cheeks, but Harry ignored it.
-No. But you were supposed to get closer to that. And you did, I saw the brochure,-Draco’s heart skipped a beat, but he played it cool.
-Did you know that if you want to divorce a husband who’s in Azkaban, you don’t even need his awareness? They probably think he will die anyway,-a couple of tears fell down his eyes. Harry didn’t know how to react. If it was Ron or Hermione crying in front of him, he’d hug them, tell them he loved them and that they will go through it together. What was he supposed to say to Malfoy?
-But don't forget, because...,-he couldn't finish his sentence. Malfoy lowered his face and carefully touched Harry's lips with his. His fingers ran through Potter's brown hair. Oh if his father could only see him now. Harry replied to the kiss and took Draco's other hand into his.
-To the victory!-he exclaimed. The whole common room cheered and raised their glasses. Draco, who Harry was sure walked in with him, now was nowhere to be seen. Potter got up and started examining the room when he found Malfoy sitting near the window.
-What kind of question is that, Malfoy?-he smiled, now being just a couple steps away from him,-I mean, Draco. Friends don’t use last names.
-Write to me. Will you?-Harry still had his hands on Malfoy's shoulders. His eyes jumped from his eyes to his lips to his strong arms and back. Only an idiot could deny Malfoy's beauty.
-Well,-Hermione sighed,-Give him some time. Congratulations, Malfoy,-she said to Draco and walked towards the castle. Harry and Draco went back together, talking about their little “duel”. Malfoy wasn’t really the type to brag, it was mostly Harry who kept bringing up the game, amazed and impressed by his own loss. Draco just listened to him, nodded, and smiled as he saw sparkles of joy in Potter’s eyes.
-I have school,-he said, pulling away from her,-I hate it too,-Lucy smiled through her tears,-And you need to have friends of your age, okay?-Harry could tell Lucy had heard that phrase a thousand times before.
-Yes,-Draco answered, but his voice wasn’t nearly as relaxed as it was when he was making fun of Harry for bringing a hanger as a weapon. Harry wanted to say something. Something to convince him that it didn’t matter, the Mark didn’t matter anymore and it didn’t really mean anything now. And that after all this time Harry had spent getting to know Draco, becoming his friend even, he found out enough to be able to see behind the “front” Malfoy had. Maybe that was their problem this whole time. Draco build a wall, created a whole other person and his true self behind it, and Harry didn’t care enough to knock it down. But he just stood there, silent.
Draco noticed it and carefully hid his left arm behind his back. That move woke Harry up. With blushing face he lowered the wand and cleared his throat.
-I don’t know. It’s not me,-he shrugged. Draco looked at him for a couple seconds and then looked away. He didn’t care. And that what made it was so easy to tell him. He didn’t have any expectations on Harry whatsoever and Harry could be himself, could tell all the truth, not just a part of it, could not fear disappointing him. It was…refreshing.
-Luna also has a date. You can just tell me you don’t want to go with me,-under no circumstances would Harry say that. He would rather spend the rest of the night composing lies than hurt that girl with the truth. He looked at Draco with silent plea in his eyes to get him out of this social nightmare.
His own cock was dripping pre-come, throbbing in the air at Malfoy’s words. He lowered a hand to it and took it in his hand, giving a couple of harsh tugs.
Harry giggled too, some nervousness coming back to him. “Oh yes, we’ll do that. But… well, you know how fights go with us. We’ll fight and then we’ll fuck and it will be scorchingly hot, and then we’ll fight again, and we’ll have sex again, and again, and again."
"What do you mean, he can’t be found?" A shiver ran through Harry's body thinking about what that could mean, hoping he was wrong.
Harry giggled, scooped up his glass and gulped down his firewhiskey. “Wait,” he said. He wasn’t sure but throughout the show he must have drunk some more glasses with Malfoy because they were giggling uncontrollably. “Come here,” Harry sloshed, taking off his glasses and tossing them…
When he returned to London, he felt slightly better, though still uncertain what to do with his life. Ron, Smith, and what’s-his-name from Ravenclaw had joined the Aurors right after the War -- Harry decided to try and follow their lead. Kingsley had still insisted on getting him into the program, and eventually, Harry found himself enrolled.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up. “Potter, what…” He cleared his throat, a grin stretching his lips before he knew it. “How much do you think I eat?”
As for company, unless someone had been sleeping in the cupboard, he was alone. He quickly opened the wardrobe doors — one never knew — and went on reading.
Harry looked at him with his eyebrows drawn together, sharing a look with Malfoy and understanding immediately neither of them found the idea funny at all.
It was true. Harry had avoided choosing truth for the duration of the game; afraid he’d receive questions that were too personal, knowing that he had too many secrets about the War, about Voldemort, Dark Magic, about his past, that he absolutely couldn’t and wouldn’t share. His pathetic Occlumency skills were too poor to shield him from the three drops of Veritaserum each of them had swallowed at the beginning of the night.
“It had been, um, interesting,” a rosy-cheeked Hermione confessed to Harry. “And now Ron acts like a jealous git.”
“Shut up! Shut. Up! We have three children. Three, Harry. Do you care to tell me how is this even possible if you are… what, gay? And, oh yes, do you think I believe even for a second your story that you’ve been cheating on us for only a year? You absolute wanker!”
Harry ran to him, fearing the worst. He threw the door open to find Draco standing in front of the mirror, his hands in his hair.
“You never change,” Draco says fondly, a smile spreading on his face. “You didn’t listen to a word I said, did you?”
Malfoy had looked at Harry, chewing on the curly straw of his drink. “Waiting for you, apparently,” he had replied, eyes glinting dangerously.
Malfoy’s eyes bore into Harry’s, focused. “Let’s say I want to be magnanimous tonight,” Malfoy said, voice steady, calm—
It came off weirdly. Draco knew as much. And Potter too, apparently, as he stopped just a few chairs from his own, to regard Draco with a perplexed face. Then a smile, a wave of his hand. Oh, Salazar, was Potter mouthing a ‘thanks’? Reaching his seat, he moved a curl that fell over his eye up on his head, only to have it back over his eye in no time. He huffed and sat down.
“But I won’t,” you continue as you line your cock to his hole, tight, too tight; he’s not prepared at all. You tease him, rubbing your cock head over his rim. “I won’t stop until I’ve filled your whore hole with my come.”
“Maybe,” he replies. He looks drunk, too, judging by the way he’s clenching the front of your shirt. Or is he…
“Are you changing the topic?” Harry shoved his hands in his pockets and inhaled slowly. “Okay… well, yes, and actually… I’ll help her, if that’s what you want to know. We want to create a school for Muggle-borns and anyone else really, but the concept is that kids before eleven years old would get to know something about the Wizarding World before Hogwarts, so that it won’t be a total shock when they start their education there. We asked Neville to help us with the herbology parts, Dean and Luna with the artistic subjects, and we actually wanted to ask you, or well, someone else who you think could do it, to help with the traditional potions. Hermione and I are working on creating little wands to make them try out the first simplest spells — with the right arrangements and protective spells around the Manor, we think it could be possible.”
-Don’t touch it!-Harry was too late, the cloth went on the floor and the portrait of Walburga Black, Sirius’s mother, was revealed. Harry groaned as she opened her eyes and looked around with the same arrogance in her eyes as usual,-That’s Sirius’s mom, Walburga Black.
-He’s just too proud. I’ll be right back,-Harry got up and headed to Draco, not noticing how Ron and Hermione shared a glance, full of something Harry wouldn’t understand anyway.
-Pure curiosity. I told you mine!-Draco mumbled the password and both of them walked into the common room, though Harry wasn’t really noticing much around himself
Draco was slammed against the door. Not fighting back at all, he was still held by 3 pretty strong looking Ravenclaws. Their “leader”, Michael Harris was standing in front of Draco, looking at him with rage and excitement in his eyes. Draco looked back at him with a cold smirk and confident stare Harry was starting to miss.
-Don’t measure your skills by whether or not you can handle Malfoy,-they reached the castle and started moving up the stairs, that always changed direction, but Harry stopped noticing it long ago.
The dinner ended quickly and Harry volunteered to help Molly around the kitchen. He hoped to get a moment alone with her and she seemed to have understood his intention as she immediately sent away all other help and started washing dishes in a muggle way, handing clean plates to Harry to dry.
-I want…I want to help more people than I’ve harmed. Make up for what I did,-he quickly mumbled with his eyes still closed. It was easier this way. For a few moment Headmistress office was absolutely silent. Minerva wanted to go back to that conversation and reassure Draco that he didn’t actually have much to make up for, but at the same time…if it truly was what he wanted…
Ron and Hermione were sitting on the couch. Weasley was half asleep with his head on Hermione’s lap, while Granger was writing something.
-Thank you, Albus. Now could you give us some privacy?-McGonagall asked. Dumbledore gladly nodded and disappeared from his portrait,-Now, do you believe me, Draco? -he nodded, not too confident though,- Your past doesn’t define you. You are not your mistakes,-Draco nodded again, a little more firmly,-And are you finally ready to take a look at your grades?-she smiled. Draco couldn’t help but smile back.
-I…I don’t know,-they were standing opposite to each other. Draco already had angry tears on his eyes, and Harry wanted to cry too, but not for the Manor.
Once they returned to the Great Hall, Harry left them alone. He stopped following Draco and instead went straight towards alcohol-table. Drinks turned into water if a minor touched them and Harry was damn glad he wasn’t one. He poured himself a drink and dried the glass in one try that burned his throat. And then another. He looked up at Draco still talking to Pansy and not even noticing that he was gone and poured another. Harry felt so much, but all his feelings were so utterly negative that they just blended into one desire to distract himself, to stop thinking. And even among the wizards, getting drunk was a way to do it.
-Of course,-Draco was looking right at Harry, hoping to meet eyes. But Harry ignored him,-I hope it won’t be long since Malfoy’s situation is pretty obvious to me.
-Quit torturing yourself, child,-knight on the wall, right next to the door told Ron,-One ex-Gryffindor had already walked through this door, no other shall.
-In the beginning of the year I think,-Draco said,-I ran into her and decided to apologize and she...hugged me,-Draco said as if he was admitting a defeat. Harry decided not to comment on the “apologize” part.
-Harry, I’m sure you know what I wanted to talk about,-Ginny lowered her voice almost to whisper. But the room was so quiet, Harry was sure Draco still could hear her, if he wanted. Does he want to?
The date of the first Quidditch match came way quicker than anyone could expect. The players and the fans couldn’t talk about anything else; no one could hold back their excitement. Hufflepuff vs. the 8th year, Ron Weasley vs. Dora Williams, their captain. Ron was sitting at the breakfast, pale as the tablecloth. Hermione comforted him as much as she could, but at times like this, only victory could calm Ron down.
It was a mystery to Draco why on Earth Harry Potter decided to show up and ruin Ministry’s plans to lock another Malfoy away. He heard and memorized every word Harry had said. Heard them, but didn’t know if he should believe them. They seemed too good to be true. How could Potter forgive him, when Draco hadn’t even forgiven himself? How could Potter talk about his innocence and being pulled into the war, when Draco had never hated himself as much as he does now? Why was Potter even here? Who asked him? Why?
Harry ran. Making his way through the darkness of the night, not even realizing how cold he was, he ran. His breath was short and quick and the steam out of his mouth seemed to reach the stars. He ran towards the castle, but secretly hoped to never reach it because only while he ran, he was able not to think. Or it was another lie he told himself that night.
“Not happening, mate,” Jerome said. “I’m not telling you who the chef is. Besides, I don’t know either.”
With his heart racing, Harry finished washing away the soap and rushed to dry and redress himself before running to the bed to read Hermione's list.
"Erm, how do we get in, now?" Harry asked, studying the door. "Jacob would sense every spell we'd use to get around the door and enter…"
A bird is chirping somewhere in the trees, the water laps gently on the shore and Harry Potter has finally lost his virginity to the guy he loves.
. Draco widened his eyes, hoping the warmness he was feeling on his cheeks wasn’t showing up in a huge blush as he suspected.
“Tell me,” he whispered on Harry’s neck, massaging the spot he had hit on his arse  cheek, “Tell me what we did that night.”
He stood up on unstable legs, forgetting about their friends, about how that long time ago, Malfoy and he had sworn they’d never tell anyone what had happened. With a trembling voice, he shouted, “You
He lined the tip of Draco’s cock against his hole, slowly pushing down onto it, taking it all as his mouth dropped open, his eyes fluttering shut briefly.
“Merlin, Potter, relax,” he said with a languorous voice, his feet still massaging Harry’s groin. “No, it doesn’t. I knew you were oblivious, but not to this point! We’ve been working together for the past two years. I always,
Ginevra froze at that, Astoria stopped sobbing. They all looked at each other; Draco feared this time a dish would be aimed at him. Then Astoria snorted; followed closely by Ginevra. Soon enough, they were both openly laughing and shaking their heads. Draco looked at them with his eyebrows furrowed, Harry tensed next to him, his hand tightening painfully on Draco’s thigh.
He returned his eyes at Malfoy again, at his swollen lips and disheveled hair, his eyes shining with tears too. He looked hurt, perhaps because Harry pushed him away and that thought made a new rush of anger run through Harry’s body.
Harry opened his mouth to reply as Malfoy added a third finger and thrust in, brushing Harry’s prostate and making his entire body shake with the need to come.
The first snow of the year covered their heads the second they got outside. Draco was standing a little farther from the orphanage and steam coming out of his mouth let Harry see how quickly he was breathing.
-Potter? What the hell?-Harry looked around and not noticing anyone, looked back at Draco with an awkward smile.
The tone of the day changed over a second. They didn’t even notice how Draco received a letter too, and started reading it. Harry kept thinking of ways he could help Molly, the woman who was kind enough to always be there for him, to treat him like her own son, to be the mother he had lost.
It was the first Christmas without Fred. Christmas full of acting and pretending to be happy just so others can also keep their act up. Christmas full of awkward conversation and fear of touching topics that could upset anyone, or remind of the pain every single person at the table was feeling. Harry understood Molly’s urge to get everyone together, but he had no idea how she managed to stay strong and keep smiling while absolutely everything in the house reminded her of what – of whom – she lost.
-I’m not asking anything from you,-he also put the plate down and turned to Molly,-She’s very lonely there. The whole week she waits for Malfoy to come, she doesn’t get along with any kids, but she is the sweetest kid I’ve ever seen.
-Interesting question, Malfoy,-Harry responded, quickly devouring everything in the close proximity to him. He wanted to eat and run off as quickly as he could.
an embarrassing amount of times, to the point Malfoy started asking for a Royal with Cheese to every McDonald’s they’d go to (yes, he had started eating trash food also!). Harry spent days trying to tell him he could only order it in France.
Harry turned to face him, his voice heavy with sarcasm. "Oh, we shouldn't trust Boo-boo, he's weird!"
“No! No, no—” Draco tried to stand up, but Harry held him by the waist, locking his fingers at the height of Draco’s belly and pulling him back down—right onto his lap. “Harry, the Portkey! And—and Paris, and—” Harry had cleaned himself up, he realised. Probably with a spell, since his clothes still felt weird to the touch. “What the heck happened?”
It’s around dinner time when the only house-elf that’s stuck around you this long tells you a guest is waiting for you in the parlour. You start trembling— you never have guests over. Actually, you still expect Weasley to turn up and kill you. That, you’d deserve.
“Mh,” Malfoy hummed, laying down on the carpet right in front of the couch. The books landed neatly around Malfoy’s body and he picked one up, throwing a glare in Harry’s direction. “Do you mind moving your foot? It's right above my face.”
Blaise chuckled, shaking his head. “Well, for one thing, I think you should quit calling them by their surnames. And then, I don’t think you should be worried. Potter testified for you at your trial, didn’t he?”
Harry realised a tad too late he had just ordered Malfoy to answer him. Malfoy’s shoulders slacked, and he gave one long, breathy sigh. “Wait—” Harry tried, but it was too late.
A rush of heat ran through Harry’s cheeks, reminding him again of that night at the infirmary. At how Harry had tried to calm Malfoy down, taking his face in his hands and looking directly into his eyes. ‘You’re not a monster’, he had said. ‘But let me help you. I can help you, Draco.’
Harry's breath hitched and he narrowed his eyes at Ron while Malfoy snorted next to him, shaking his head.
Draco inhaled deeply, reaching a hand to Harry's hair, stopping barely in time. Harry stepped back, tears still hot on his cheeks.
Harry reached him, slouching towards him reluctantly, muttering that, “You actually have it…”, gaining an angry wave of Malfoy’s hand in his direction.
tortugatongue. And no, I’m not crying. Sand just got into my eyes.” He looked up into Draco’s eyes, a trembling smile on his face. “I’ve never been good with goodbyes. I don’t like them.”
"Well, we are fifty years old after all." He stood up, his black hair glinting in the sun — the blond roots were growing out again. "Speaking of which," he went on, stretching out, "I can't sit this long without getting a backache. Shall we go?"
“Fuck, Malfoy, you taste so bloody good,” Potter said, lips brushing Draco’s now-sensitive head, sending jolts of pleasure throughout Draco’s body. Draco opened his eyes, directing his gaze downward, only to find Potter looking up at him, his hand palming his still-clothed cock, desperation darkening his eyes like a storm reflecting on the ocean.
“Don’t go, I want you, honey, I want you again.” He wiggled his hips to make Draco feel exactly how much he wanted him again, his cock still hard at the thought of having Draco all for himself.
"I was doing sun salutations. Which reminds me… I've got a funny feeling. I really think we've been here for more than twelve hours."
“Or me,” Ron concluded, one eyebrow raised. “We could ask the others, though, just to be sure.” He snorted, taking out his mobile.
But then Malfoy slipped a hand under Harry’s body and tugged, and Harry sat up, following his touch. Malfoy untied Harry’s wrists, but before Harry could finally touch him, grasp him, he grabbed his hands and tied them again behind Harry’s back.
Harry looked flabbergasted at him. “If we go out now, in the middle of the song, alone, we’d make the front page quicker than a Snitch just released.”
It was a bitter laugh, and Draco knew that. But at least she had stopped crying. Scorpius’ lips seemed to try to stretch into a smile against his will. “Oh, damn. Did you already know? When we hosted that?”
Draco felt his cheeks growing hot; he hadn’t wanted a big reunion with the Granger-Weasleys too, but it seemed that everyone thought it was necessary to start to be comfortable with each other again.
And yet, after he’d seen Potter’s dedication to the task —how Potter moaned and licked Draco’s spunk until the last drop— Draco knew he could never do without it again. Snapping out of his memories, Draco extended his hand to Potter who promptly lifted his head and met Draco half-way, slipping out his tongue and licking Draco’s fingers in earnest. It should have surprised Draco how Potter’s tongue felt smooth against his fingers, so delicate compared to the rough sucking of his mouth, but it only made sense; Potter licked and sucked Draco’s fingers in the same manner as he did with his cock
Draco had sucked in a breath, asking himself if there was anything filthier or hotter than this. When Potter eventually bit into the slice, droplets of lime juice ran down his fingers. His tongue darted down to lick the droplets clean, before returning to voraciously attack the slice of lime.
Malfoy caught Harry’s eye and just stepped into the living room, silently approaching Teddy and sitting next to him. He made Teddy’s magical marbles dance around him, eliciting heartfelt laughter from him.
"Thank you, Harry," he distractedly answered, still looking at the parchments. "I'm glad the Saviour of us all likes my office."
“Who cares!” Seamus exclaims suddenly. He’s so eager he’s sitting on the edge of his bed, body angled towards Harry. “Tell us about the House!”
They’d stared at each other in the moonlight a few seconds before Harry had added, “I love you. I miss you. Please, Draco, don’t do this to me. Let me help y—”
“First of all, release her, Harry, or you’ll hurt her. And… I’m sorry, but she really needs to be freed. She’ll deliver her eggs in a matter of days and it’s best for her and her babies if they’re back in the ocean in time.”
“Draco! Harry! You’re here finally! What is this?!” Ginevra shoved the newspaper into Harry’s chest, pinning it there with her hand.
Malfoy’s cheeks were blotched red, and his lips were fixed on a bright beam. “Only I get to see you like this. Beautiful, my love, gorgeous.”
“I’ll start,” Malfoy said, turning his head to look up at Harry. “I’m fine with your feet kink, you can ask me to do stuff with them, just not to stick my toes in your arse.”
-I’m giving it to you. It doesn’t really matter though,-Draco whispered and sat down on his bed. He hid his face in his hands. Harry was scared to read what he was holding, what upset – or even shocked – Draco so much.
The court room was so huge that the light from open windows hardly was enough, even during mornings. It was almost deadly hot, but as the room started filling with people, and each and every single one of them starred at Draco, he started feeling goosebumps and uncomfortable cold on his skin. It seemed like half a Ministry was there, all abandoned their jobs just to decide whether or not Draco Malfoy deserves to have a future. Draco knew that his chances were basically equal to zero. Yet, he hoped. For a miracle, since it was the only thing that could help him.
-No, I don’t,-Draco replied, taking off his coat,-But isn’t it just easier to agree with her than have a whole discussion?-Harry was surprised to hear it. To be honest, he never even thought about that before. When it came to the lady on that portrait, he either avoided any interaction with her, or argued and fought until they both got so tired that they lost the track of time and the conversation. And now, Harry tried to listen closer. For the first time in 3 years, the portrait was uncovered, but remained silent. She wasn’t complaining, wasn’t mumbling insults and racial slurs, didn’t beg Merlin to “give her a salvation from these abominations who now occupied her home”.
-Yeah. Thought we’d have another year playing together,-Ron said in a disappointed tone,-The training’s on Tuesday after the Potions. Don’t be late,-Ron said to Draco and walked away. Hermione stayed.
-Nothing,-he put the plate on the spot next to his and sat down. For a second Draco just stood there in shock.
-Believe it or not, I have zero interest in your pathetic love life,-Draco mumbled without looking up from his homework.
-Except for me. It won’t be fair, if it’s just me,-Draco shrugged indifferently,-Come on, Malfoy. You have to try!
-Where’s that Gryffindor courage, Potter?-Draco asked as if he had read Harry’s mind. Neither of them rushed to get in, but neither of them wanted to make the other think as if they changed their mind.
-You don’t,-Hermione sighed and handed him paper she had been writing,-I had nothing to do,-Harry took the paper and read the title. His essay. With his name on it. Written better than he could ever dream to write.
-Thank you, Mr. Potter,-Kingsley said. He looked at his colleagues and after earning a slight nod from almost each one of them, looked at Draco. Malfoy absolutely froze and even If the miracle happens and he gets to walk away free, Draco wouldn’t be able to move.
-It’s attacking me! It’s attacking my nose!-his eyes were teary, he reached for a napkin, knocking over the bottle. With a quick spell (non-verbal and wandless) Harry got rid of the mess and handed napkins to Draco, who was assured in his soon death.
-But you said you also didn’t have any friends. And I want to be friends only with you!-Lucy was very close to breaking down. All Draco meant by his words was that she didn’t have to be lonely all week, waiting for him; but all she heard was that he wanted to get rid of her.
-She just wants to get rid of it. As if it doesn’t mean anything to anyone. This manor was in my father’s family for centuries! It has history! She can’t just give it to some rich idiot!
-You mean that piece of trash Weasley is making? Yes, that’s what happened,-Draco rolled his eyes, which hurt unexpectedly badly.
Analyzing every bit of Harry’s feelings to understand why did Quidditch went down on his list of things that mattered to him was hard, if not impossible. Also, pretty stupid. Maybe he was glad to lose even more pressure, put the responsibility of the “youngest, most promising” Seeker on Draco’s shoulders. Malfoy needed that win way more anyway. That he knew for sure.
-Sure,-Draco felt a little warmer, just going beside someone, just going beside Harry. He hadn’t seen his mother in a long time and she wasn’t exactly happy when Draco refused to move to France with her and only agreed to spend holidays there. But Potter’s presence distracted him from nerves and anxious thoughts.
-I don’t know, Ron,-Harry started, but got distracted by Draco passing them. Harry took his bag off the seat next to him, freeing it for Malfoy, but he didn’t even look at it. Draco nodded at the trio and walked past them, taking his usual seat in the end of the table. Harry forgot all about Ron’s question and just watched Draco, while Ron and Hermione watched him.
-No, it’s not. Even I can see how messed up everything is,-he sighed,- But…you shouldn’t feel bad. You are already doing your best to help that girl,-Draco shook his head.
-Screw you, Potter, fine,-Draco shook Harry’s hand, holding back a smile. Harry wasn’t. He smiled brightly and sincerely.
-Good morning, Madam,-Harry said, trying to force a smile. Such reactions never flattered him. And Draco smirking behind the back of the woman didn’t help too.
-I gotta go,-Harry jumped up,-Don’t you dare not show up tomorrow!-he said to Malfoy on his way out, preparing for one of the most uncomfortable conversations in his life.
-Who can it be from?-his mother, of course. Harry saw Draco’s tendency to get upset after talking to his mother.
-Okay. Thanks,-they looked at each other with smiles on their lips, and Harry thought about hugging Draco – it did seem appropriate, considering he had just offered him to move in with him – but it also felt awkward. Draco thought about the same thing. And while they were thinking – not doing – the door to the dorm opened, and Ron and Hermione walked in.
-My father would have done all of that,-Draco whispered after a pause. Harry’s hand froze. He had two options now; either back up, or go further and try to finally get Draco to open up.
-You hate him! And you have a reason to. And you still want me to be with Ginny,-Ron shook his head,-Yes, you do!
-Why? Who flies better and catches the snitch gets the position,-Draco almost laughed at Harry’s naivety,-What?
-What?-Draco looked shocked enough for Harry to start doubting his theory, but not enough for him to drop it.
-So there’s nothing for breakfast,-he said, opening it just to see the same picture like yesterday,-Except for yesterday’s pizza.
-Yes, you’ve never actually rejected me, but come on. You knew I liked you since the day we met. But you only started noticing me when I’ve moved on,-Ginny said. Harry had nothing to resist with. She was right.
-Mr. Potter,-a lady in a black shirt with very short hair chimed in,-I would like to remind you that the actions of Lucius Malfoy had let to the death of your Godfather in this very Ministry,-Harry closed his eyes and sighed.
-I am very happy that you have decided to continue and finish your education here, in Hogwarts,-she said,-The castle is always ready to welcome whoever truly wants to learn something. And now you are standing in front of your new common room.
-Not the shirt, I’m not going to the funeral, am I?-Harry rolled his eyes and went back into the store. He actually did have to find something for himself too, but he’d rather be alone while doing it. Especially if Ron was going to point out “his date” every 5 minutes. Potter had already made it clear that him going to the Ball with Draco was more of a joke, and they were going as friends.
-Were you waiting for me?-as unbelievable as that thought was, Draco couldn’t find another reason for Harry to spent at least half an hour extra in front of Headmistress office.
-Oh, Ron. I didn’t notice you,-Ron had that look he always had before starting a fight. Cheeks a little red, eyes slightly narrowed down, jaws clenched.
-Not really. I mean, I probably would be mad if you told me that before, but now that he’s basically your boyfriend,-Harry didn’t know if he should laugh or punch Ron,-And I probably should have seen that coming.
-Draco asked to keep it between us. But it was very lovely of you to walk me here, Harry,-she touched his arm and walked to the Ravenclaw table. Harry stood in shock, now more invested in what Hermione would call “not his business” than ever.
-Lucy, you will discuss it with Draco later. Right, Draco?-Madam Polkinghorne said. Lucy just kept starring at Draco with her huge teary eyes and asking her question. Harry physically felt his heart being torn to pieces.
-Oh my god,-Harry laughed. He couldn’t wait to tell that to Hermione. Pansy’s sudden “coming out” really served as an ice-breaker. Harry’s nerves calmed down and he finally – finally – started enjoying the ball. Through at least 4 more songs they talk about every stupid prank they pulled on each other, every time one of them went an extra mile just to screw another over, about the Potter Stinks pins (Draco still considered them high comedy), about “that time you climbed a damn tree to bully me!” (Draco denied that ever happened) and all other endless cases of their stupidity.
Draco knew himself enough to admit, it was nice. Really nice. But at the same time he was playing a role of a replacement here and was aware of it. Maybe Harry hoped Ron would notice them and get jealous. Maybe Potter just couldn’t stand being alone, even for one class. Either way, he didn’t sit next to Draco because he actually wanted to sit with him. And once Malfoy’s illusions bumped into that thought and fell apart, Draco felt a familiar wave of self-hatred coming up to him.
-Draco! Harry!-they heard a voice behind them. Both boys turned around and saw Luna Lovegood running towards them. She stopped to catch a breath and smiled,-Look at you! You both look great!
-Nothing,-Harry mumbled. Ron and Hermione were sitting right before them, the whole class was silent, but one question was boiling inside of Harry, threatening to come out any time.
-Yes, and Quidditch always used to cheer you up,-Harry said, as if he knew the first thing about what cheers up Draco Malfoy,-Come on, don’t let me win without a fight.
-Try this one first,-Ron had to physically push Harry into the changing room – Harry kept whining and bickering,-Even if you don’t want to impress anyone,-Ron started as Harry was changing,-Where’s your competitive spirit? Malfoy’s gonna be all dressed up, you gotta beat him.
-Aren’t Hufflepuffs supposed to be the weakest team?-Hermione asked Harry. She had never been this worried about a Quidditch game before. Maybe only when Harry was attacked during one.
-Oh, yes, Ron told me all about it,-she smiled,-That Malfoy kid turned out to be not so bad, didn’t he?-Molly looked at Harry and he was paralyzed by the fear of what exactly Ron could have told her.
When you literally die once and right after that kill your biggest enemy, it sort of changes the way you see things.  And after spending 7 years of your life, of your childhood, fighting, losing, fearing, seeing blood, seeing friends and family go before their time, seeing lives being destroyed, children turned into orphans, it can’t help but leave a mark on you.  One, that just won’t let you sign up for a lifetime of blood, pain and fights again. And of course the evil didn’t end with Voldemort and there was still a lot in this world to change, a lot to fight, but Harry had done his job, fulfilled his destiny, if you will. Why can’t someone else handle the rest?
-I’m not. You are much more needed here,-Kreacher looked around. Merlin, there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t do to go back home.
-Draco?-she asked, but couldn’t pronounce the letter “r” correctly and Harry had never heard Malfoy’s name said with so much tenderness.
-Yes. Draco Malfoy is not an actual Death Eater. He never was,-Harry said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. His statement caused a few gasps over the room. A small smirk appeared on Kingsley’s lips.
-It’s pretty obvious when you think about it,-she said, flipping her hair to her shoulder,-I noticed you started showing interest towards Malfoy and wondered why. And then I thought, who in the world has enough power to convince Ministry to let an ex-Death Eater go? Who Ministry owes so much to? The answer was obvious. You are the only one who had both motive and resources,-Harry stared at her in shock. Everyone knew Granger was smart, but when she pulled off something close to actual mind-reading, it was scary.
Harry, too, seemed to have better things to worry about than a ball partner. Now that he had officially broken up with Ginny and didn’t “have to” invite anyone, the Ball stopped feeling like an obligation. He just hoped Hermione turns out to be wrong and no one would actually force him to go. Which was...pretty unrealistic.
But apparently, that was too much to ask. It’s unlikely that Hogwarts’s walls had ever seen this much hatred directed at one person. Every joke and insult Malfoy had ever thrown at anyone now seemed pathetic, compared to what he was going through. It looked like nearly every student felt like it was their obligation to remind Malfoy about all his actions before and during the war, about the black serpent on his arm, about that name he hoped to never hear towards himself ever again.
-Draco…,-Harry’s voice turned out dry and weak, but Potter was just shocked by what he had read that could hardly speak. It was like a storm. Unexpected, strong, destroying.
-Let’s go,-Pansy said after a while and took Draco’s hand. He followed her, not even looking at Harry. Potter couldn’t believe that something he had done 6 years ago could have such ridiculous but serious consequences. Couldn’t believe it was so important to Draco.
They moved farther into the hall and through the party had already started, neither of them knew what they were supposed to do now. The music was too loud, the only table with alcohol (for 7
-Nervous?-he asked Harry after at least a minute of him starring at the door almost without blinking.
Malfoy neglected their usual spot. He sat a little closer to the teacher, next to an ex-Hufflepuff student, probably assuming she’d be too nice to kick him out or start asking questions. Harry spent the whole lesson sitting all alone and starring into Draco’s back, not honoring the new DADA Professor with even a small share of his attention. In his head, he scrolled through the list of potential suspects who could have wanted to hurt Malfoy and it was painfully long. Michael Harris and his friends weren’t the only ones wishing ill to Draco. Half of the school had lost either a friend or a family member during the war, and though all of them knew perfectly well that he was acquitted of all charges, it didn’t mean anything to them. Once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater.
It took them a lot of time and ambition to find a free compartment, but once Harry, Ron and Hermione had settled for one, the usual 1st of September talk started. Ron and Hermione were now officially together, which was great, but Harry couldn’t help but think that the time when the three of them did everything together and had their legendary adventures was behind them and a constant role of the third wheel was now expecting for Potter. Not that he wanted to do anything legendary this year. Not at all. Harry hoped for a calm year, for tons of homework that will distract him from memories and flashbacks. He hoped for a good opportunity to move on and start over. He hoped to discover himself all over again and find out what he truly wanted from life, now that his life had finally started. He really hoped for a very boring 8th year. Boring, according to Hogwarts’s standards.
-Morning,-friends greeted each other and continued breakfast. Mondays are rarely good, but this one – despite endless classes from Hogwarts’s most boring teachers – promised to be at least tolerable. It was also mail day, which explained a feather in Harry’s juice.
-You think anyone else will try out for that position? Dare to challenge the Great Harry Potter,-Hermione chuckled and Harry kicked Ron’s leg under the table, slightly blushing,- I don’t think anyone who used to be a Seeker is studying with us,-Ron added.
Harry ran through empty halls, looking out of every window he came across. Ron was still up in the air, but Harry had no idea how well he was doing. He knew that he was supposed to be there and his conscious was screaming inside of him. Harry was supposed to be cheering for Ron, yelling “Ron Weasley is our king”, being a proper damn friend. But no, he’s running across the entire Hogwarts, to check on a guy who couldn’t give less of a shit about him.
-Okay, Quidditch tryouts are tomorrow, who do you think will be the captain?-Ron jumped onto the seat between Harry and Hermione during the breakfast. Potter’s drink inevitably spilled right on his bacon, but Ron was too distracted by making out with his girlfriend to notice. By the time they finished, Harry already swapped their plates, waiting for Ron’s reaction as he tries pumpkin flavored bacon.
wasn’t an understatement. The platform was full of children, but not many of them were his course mates. Harry himself wasn’t sure if going back to Hogwarts was a right thing to do now. But once he approached Ron and Hermione, the doubts faded away a bit.
-You don’t need to pay me back, Harry,-she said, tears in her voice,-I love you like a son. You are my son,-she said, now cupping Harry’s face. She looked so serious, but so amazingly loving, Harry couldn’t understand how that much love could fit in one person. How can a person be so damn strong, go through so much pain and walk out of it gracefully, still capable of smiling, loving and being happy,-I need to talk to Arthur first. But…next time you visit her, let me know,-she said and the ray of hope Harry had turned into a whole sun.
-You think I didn’t? It’s like he’s allergic to straight-forward answers,-Harry said, frustrated. Hermione smiled,-What?
-I’m sorry, Professor, it was my fault,-Harry stepped up immediately, not giving Draco even a chance to open his mouth,-Can we still try out? Please?
What Potter did not expect, is that Draco wouldn’t fight back. At all. To anyone. He ignored every insult, every verbal and even non-verbal punch. He let people talk, let them spread any rumors they want, no matter how cruel or bizarre. His face remained indifferent, and if Harry hadn’t seen that sincere shock and fear on Draco’s face back in court, he’d assume Malfoy really doesn’t care.
She was wearing a dress that reminded of the 8th year’s team's new uniform, but was multiple times brighter. The tips of her hair were blue, her make-up was equally beautiful and crazy. It was obvious which team she was rooting for and Harry smiled every time he looked at her. She seemed like the only person whom war didn’t change that much.
year students were allowed to leave school on the weekends, but Harry had no idea where he would want to go. Grimmauld place, just to spend to days all alone in the complete silence? Or the Burrow, to see Molly Weasley desperately trying to look as if she wasn’t completely broken? Neither of the options attracted Harry much and he knew that Draco had even smaller choice and just couldn’t imagine where he was going because the thought of him spending nights in the half-destroyed Manor was too horrible to even consider.
-But he was wrong!-Harry said so loudly that even Sue Li, the team’s new Beater looked at him,-He was!-Harry repeated, lowering his voice.
-Lucy, I’m sorry!-Draco cried as Analise took her away. His eyes were red too, lips trembling. He held himself back from running after her, holding her close and just taking her away, no matter circumstances.
-I did tell you that I changed my mind. No one else knows that,-Harry said. Draco opened his mouth to say something and quickly closed it, looking at something behind Harry.
-I heard you two are friends now,-Harry desperately tried to read her face, but Molly remained peaceful and content. Harry wondered if that was what she actually felt or if she was just good at hiding her emotions.
-This honestly has nothing to do with Malfoy,-Harry said, a little more annoyed than he implied,-You should have heard Ron yesterday. Why does he even hate Draco so much?-Harry mumbled, mostly to himself.
-I’ll catch up with you later,-Harry said as they passed The Three Broomsticks without stopping in it. He thought he had seen a familiar figure in the window, and decided to use it as an excuse to distant himself. Ron shrugged, not very upset with Harry leaving them. Hermione asked if everything was okay and after getting a positive answer didn’t insist on anything and walked away.
-What?-Harry looked out and saw Ron and Hermione starring at them through the glass. Neither of them could tell for how long they were there, but judging by Ron’s red shocked face, it’s been long enough.
-It’s…It’s a muggle expression,-Harry rushed to explain himself,-Means “Good luck”,-Harry smiled weakly, but Draco just shook his head in shock.
-Either way…it doesn’t matter now! You’re free, you can just forget about it all,-Harry said, getting up.
On the lunch and dinner Harry had to be creative with Draco again. He didn’t turn into a show, like on the breakfast, but when Malfoy tried to sneak to his old seat, he grabbed his bag from his hand, almost making Draco fall. The next morning it was enough for Harry to smile at Draco for him to sit next to them.
-A couple times when I was younger,-Draco was rather excited to go in, see what had changed since the last time he had been there. It’s been more than 10 years, back then Blacks and Malfoys were one big, dysfunctional family.
-Just try it!-Harry exclaimed,-I’m not trying to poison you, I’ve had every chance to kill you today.
-Ministry couldn’t care less about me! Or any of us! They wanted me out of their hair, locking me up in this school was just another way!
-Even though his family is responsible for so much damage that has been done to you?-witch that both Harry and Draco already hated asked,-Even though Mr. Malfoy was the one who led Death Eaters into Hogwarts?
Ron was careful with Harry till the end of the day, but on the next morning, the Quidditch tryouts morning, he was too excited to even remember what happened the day before. He was very serious in his intention to get his previous position, a Keeper. It was all he could talk about and even poor Hermione couldn’t stand listening to him for the whole morning, and during the breakfast, she, a little shamefacedly, sat next to Ginny.
-I testified for Draco this summer. I don’t know how much credit I should take for the fact that he’s free…Draco keeps saying that he owes it to me, but it’s not true,-Harry expected Ron to get mad immediately. But he wasn’t mad. His face didn’t change at all,-It wasn’t just my secret, Ron. I didn’t know if I could tell anyone, I promised Kingsley to keep it a secret, I…
-No, I mean…isn’t fighting back your entire personality? A couple years ago you wouldn’t sleep until you found who did this to you. And then you’d get them expelled. And definitely threaten to get the school closed,-Harry smiled, hoping to make Draco laugh too, but he remained painfully serious. Harry knew they were crossing the line of their first serious conversation, and though Potter both realized it had to be done, and even wanted to do it, it was still scary. It reminded Harry of interacting with a wild animal. One not careful word, one sudden move and you lost him.
Of course, there still was Ginny. This amazing, almost perfect girl, who was there for him from the beginning, who was simple and even easy to love. Harry probably could love her, if he tried. But he didn’t want to try. He wanted to have what Ron and Hermione have, something so fantastic that makes actual magic seem boring. Ginny just wasn’t his person and Harry didn’t want to waste her time. She deserved better. The problem remained that he had to say all of this to her. And to be honest, defeating Voldemort was less scary.
All in all, it could be worse, Harry guessed. Malfoy had told him the potion would keep his aches at bay — aches due to the need for constant touch with the other person.
Draco arrived at Ron and Hermione’s just a moment after Harry. When they first saw the article, they had panicked, but then they had rationalised and, well, Hermione had called them saying she had a plan. So, they had calmed down and immediately Floo’d to her house.
Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, squeezing him in a tight hug. He grinned and nodded, solemnly.
Now, twenty-seven years later, Draco was pathetic, he knew it. But he still couldn't avoid thinking about Potter, about what they’d had.
Harry leaned down and bracketed his elbows next to Draco’s face, whispering, “Next time, we’ll use wine. Chianti.”
In a rush, James, Albus and Lily all entered the kitchen, looking hurried and astounded. Ginny glanced sideways at Harry, who had no idea what was happening. They had barely the time to share a look when the three children started talking at the same time.
Harry turned to look at Draco, seeing him lose several shades of colours from his face, now whiter than ever. And only now realising something else...
Harry stood up abruptly, running to their hotel, noticing distractedly the sun was already down and hoping to find both Boo-boo and Draco back there. He stepped through the atrium dripping water all around himself, a little puddle already forming at his feet. He cast an apologising gaze to the receptionist who shrugged and went back to her duties.
“You called me ‘Harry’.” Harry’s voice was equally low, his mouth so, so close, Draco was having difficulties thinking but he needed to know, right now.
By the time he changed into more comfortable clothes — a pair of khaki-coloured joggers and a white t-shirt— it was already half-past six, and Draco’s heart started beating furiously in his chest, his ears ringing.
Harry slowly sank down on Malfoy’s cock, opening his mouth in a deep growl of satisfaction at the feeling of fullness he was craving so desperately, his cock leaking a spurt of pre-come as Malfoy grasped his hips to guide him.
That caught Astoria’s attention as she raised her head and shared a worried look with them. “Should I call them to check if they are all still alive?”
The morning after, Draco entered his lab yawning loudly. He was feeling the tiredness of the night before but the nice thing about Mexico was the relaxed attitude towards life of its inhabitants.
Ron blushed, his cheeks matching his fiery hair and the scarlet of his Auror uniform. “Well, I… I wanted to ask you if you’d like to have lunch with me?”
"Okay, okay," Draco replied with a snort, "I do love him." His cheeks reddened deliciously, Harry's heart skipping a beat at the sight.
Draco crossed his arms, annoyed he had to ask. “Tell me what?” He drawled, hoping to sound spiteful and unimpressed.
Draco blinked several times in confusion, scratching the cuticles of his nails absent-mindedly. “Me? A school… woah.” He took a big breath and started again. “That’s… actually a brilliant idea. But… how can Hogwarts be a shock? I mean, if you’re a wizard certainly you know you’ll attend it?”
With a last thought about the way Potter’s face had looked at peace and relaxed on his sofa the night before, Draco stepped into his fireplace, a pinch of Floo powder between his fingers. He hoped it would be a busy day at work.
Draco didn’t have time to reply. Potter ducked his head and licked his way down Draco’s chest, digging his tongue into Draco’s navel, taking Draco’s cock in his mouth with a deep growl.
“Shut up!” Harry yelled, all the other customers’ eyes snapping to him. Draco froze, slowly raising his gaze to him.
“Christ, fuck—“ Harry canted his arse up, face smashed against the wall. “More, give me more, Draco!”
Harry’s gaze dropped to his cock, shining with drops of pre-come. Sucking in a breath, he looked up again to find Malfoy smirking, his bottom lip trapped between his teeth.
He picked up a pink flower from the soil and approached Harry, stopping mere inches from him, his breath ghosting over Harry’s lips. He brought the flower to Harry’s nostrils and Harry inhaled deeply, closing his eyes.
“Now, now, Mr Malfoy, I wouldn’t use such a term. If it’s true, though, that you won’t make an Unbreakable Vow, you will still need to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement.”
Sure enough, there she was, kneading some weird stuff on the kitchen table. As soon as she saw Harry, her concentrated face twisted into one of pure anger. Some dried tears were stuck on her cheeks, like arid rivers ploughing the side of the mountains.
-That’s not true, Ron,-Harry assured him, truly meaning it. Back in his time he didn’t like being captain at all and definitely knew how hard it was. He remembered how on his 6th year, Oliver’s and Angelina’s behavior stopped seeming so weird. They were actually pretty goof at holding it together.
-No, he didn’t. But he was one of the Eaters,-Hermione shrugged. And though Harry still thought that it was unfair to blame Draco for what he hadn’t done, he now felt more indulgent towards Ron.
on him, coursed from his arm through his entire body and all he could remember before darkness swallowed him, was Ron letting go of him as Hermione shouted something that Harry didn’t catch.
Malfoy sagged against him, sighing tiredly, resting his forehead on the back of Harry’s neck, mouthing clumsily at it. He pulled out his cock, tugged to make Harry face him again, cleaned them both with a silent spell. He was smiling, that unguarded curve of his lips that Harry had craved to see again for too long now.
Malfoy was standing right next to him, a hand splayed on his stomach, another clamped around his mouth.
“Nothing,” Harry said, quickly turning to retrieve the teapot and pour two cups of tea. “How was your day?” he asked as he levitated the cups to the table.
“With your horrible dancing skills? I remember the Yule Ball.” It was so easy to fall back into known territory, banter, mocking, reminiscing stupid things done during their younger years.
Exhilarating, that was. So he felt every inch the brave man everyone said he was and finally told Malfoy.
“I’ll start,” Harry interrupted cheerfully. He propped one elbow on the counter and leaned his chin on it. “When I was eleven, I was almost Sorted into Slytherin.”
Lunch went more or less the same. Harry had to give Malfoy an order to prepare it, much to Kreacher’s immense dismay. He didn’t stop yelling obscenities against half-bloods giving orders to pure bloods.
Malfoy was fucking between Harry’s thighs, clumsy, roughly, his mouth close to Harry’s ear. His breathing was quick and shallow and wet against Harry’s neck and then he moved slightly and the puffs of air coming out of Malfoy’s mouth directly blew on Harry’s ear and he’d snorted. So hard.
“Draco!” Pansy knelt next to him, took his hands, lowered them, laid her forehead on Draco’s. She tried again, whispering this time. “Draco.”
Harry turned with a big grin plastered on his face. “Draco!” He ran to him, covering the few metres that separated them and launched himself into Draco’s arms, kissing him on the cheek. “Is it too soon to tell you I missed you?”
“Dad, I just wanted to tell you… Um. James is angry right now, but you know him, he’ll come around soon. He’s just like you, ready to get mad, but easily calms down. Lily, she has always had a special relationship with mum, right? But she loves you and I am sure she’ll accept this thing with time.” He stopped, worrying his lips.
As if summoned by Harry’s thoughts, Hermione walked in that moment, steps hurried and hair a mess, talking on her mobile.
It didn’t take long. Draco accepted the pint and headed over to the dance floor with the bloke. He didn’t even remember the stranger’s name, or even the colour of his eyes, for that matter. Draco had kept his gaze fixed on Potter— on how Potter’s jaw clenched from anger, on the way his tongue had darted out to lick his probably rage-dried lips, on the almost-white knuckles of fingers curled around a glass of whiskey.
Malfoy pursed his lips as he eyed the armchair next to Harry’s couch. Harry swallowed around a mouthful of bread with a sip of orange juice and stuttered out, “Er, sit down on the armchair.”
"He means we tried to track him down but it looks like Jacob has disappeared from Earth, Harry." Hermione sat on the bed next to Harry, careful not to touch him.
Then one morning an idea implanted in Harry’s mind — he told himself he was doing it for Draco, to help him start the day
— with a package in his hands. You’re sitting on the sofa, not paying too much attention to the book on your lap.
“But that’s beside the point. When my stomach started reclaiming a normal bacterial flora, I went to see a Healer, Mrs Richmond. She told me cooking could help to focus my energies onto the activity so much I’d forget about licking things. And, well, it worked. The more I cooked, the more I was happy and I stopped being sick all the time. So—”
“Actually, don’t answer that.” He suddenly turned towards Malfoy, piercing him with what he hoped was a glacial glare.
Everything seemed to stop at once, Draco’s heart, everyone’s breathing, the ticking of the clocks. Hermione Granger had just offered a mind-boggling amount of money to obtain a property where she most certainly couldn’t have any good memories. What the fuck?
The Malfoy in front of him got closer unbuckling his belt, taking Harry’s chin between his thumb and index finger, pulling him in a heated kiss. Harry’s brain shut down, he was sure Malfoy was right behind him, still fucking into him, brushing his prostate over and over again, then who was now kissing him, making him tremble?
As soon as the guests spotted Draco and Astoria at the end of the veranda, silence fell over them. Narcissa had wanted to accompany him to the altar, but Astoria had insisted she wanted to do it. They were standing hand in hand, ready to walk towards Harry.
“Sure. You go, guys, I’ll stay here and… I don’t know. Check if people arrive early, or, the tables, the festoons… Do you think I should raise the temperature? Is it cold?”
It took a moment for Draco to take in their presence. Then he remembered, he remembered the first months after the War, his mother just condemned to ten years in Azkaban, his father Kissed by the Dementors.
As he left the dining hall, Draco let his gaze wander over the walls of the corridor, the portraits, statues and the sculptures his family collected over the years. He had them all checked for old spells and curses, after having previously hidden them for all those years, and now the ones remaining stood proudly in the Manor again.
They chewed in silence for a few minutes before Malfoy’s head turned heavily towards Harry, his eyelids half closed.
“Oh c’mon, let us see!” Hermione was always the most curious and excited when there was something to discover.
Just when Harry's mind started going through all the possible things he could do or say to make Malfoy laugh and those dimples appear again — a silly dance? Some other scathing and bordering-on-offensive jokes? — Hermione turned her head and waved her hand for them to come over, quickly introducing her colleague Geremia Sprut.
Each word rolled out of Malfoy’s mouth in a visibly controlled effort to be kind. “Granger knows. See you tomorrow, Po—
It was arousing even if not quite what Draco wanted. He took Harry’s wrist just as he was a knuckle in and pushed away his hand.
“What…?” Draco turned to find Potter a few metres behind him, an embarrassed smile on his face and a blush covering his cheeks.
"Don't ask it as if we haven't spent the last twenty years together." Draco was always quick to retort, his witty replies as prickly and pointy as his own body.
Harry pushed further, always checking Draco’s reactions, excited to see he was still sleeping, still murmuring like he always did while dreaming.
Harry sighed and re-opened his eyes. Ginny was staring at him, wide-eyed. She didn’t seem inclined to really talk.
“Only you,” Harry whispered, amused. A couple of tears slowly rolled down his temples. “Sir, my love,” he said as Malfoy’s eyes softened and his cockhead pushed inside of Harry.
His magic was reacting to his feelings, and the bottle for their stupid Truth or Dare game had just exploded.
“Meet the Greengrasses, dear,” your mother says. Her eyes are puffy and streaked with blood. You’re sincerely scared.
Harry looked around, worried the other guests in the restaurant could hear them and cast a wordless and wandless
Now that he had started, he felt as he could never stop anymore. Harry had bottled up his mixed feelings towards Malfoy for so long that now he felt like an erupting volcano, the anger boiling in his veins like lava, ready to reach out and swallow Malfoy and everything else.
Harry grabbed Malfoy’s shirt and pushed him back, strongly, until he hit the wall. He pressed him there with his chest, their noses bumping together.
Realisation hit him like a Bludger in the head. Draco gritted his teeth, hating that Hermione had fooled him once again.
“Do you like the surprise? We thought you’d need a distraction.” Neville levitated the trunk up to the bedroom and winked at Harry, walking towards the kitchen.
Before Draco could grasp that his magic had probably gone completely crazy, Potter burst through the door of the cubicle with a bewildered face and wand in hand. He was still facing backwards at the incriminated toilet when he turned and saw Draco. His face scrunched up more, his eyebrows drawing together, almost colliding, his wand pointing to Draco’s chest.
Draco pinched Harry on the arm. “Idiot! It’s not our tastes, oh Merlin! He’s just being stupid!” Draco took another worried look at the incriminating dildo.
Harry grabbed the handle of the door, praying he’d be able to refrain from blushing at the sight of Malfoy wrapped in his Potioneer scrubs and goggles. He didn’t have the time to think anything, though— as soon as Harry opened the door, Malfoy flicked his eyes up and cried, “Fuck!” before a loud bang echoed in the room.
But Harry just brushed it off with beer after beer while Hermione looked disapprovingly at him, and when he slept with Ginny to prove to himself that he loved
They had to disguise themselves to not be recognised amongst people, and then hope for the best. Harry had left with some money on him but neither of them could go to Gringotts and withdraw from their vaults, or their past-selves would notice it.
Draco felt hot in his entire body and turned his head to Harry. He seemed to be in the same condition. Draco inhaled through his nostrils to find his voice again. “You two are idiots, but, erm, thank you?” He was grinning to them and Harry snorted. “Yeah, I mean, I doubt we’ll ever use it, but…”
Malfoy glanced sideways at him and took another puff. “Want one?” He offered, tilting the cigarette to Harry. Harry took a drag, if only to put his mouth where Malfoy’s mouth had been.
The breeze was warm and wrapped around Draco, bringing the persistent perfume of lilies and jasmines with it. He inhaled deeply, closing his eyes, skimming a hand through his hair, worried the breeze would dishevel it. Blaise was right — it was a mildly warm day, one of those days you’d want to spend on the veranda of your house, with a glass of wine in one hand and the peace of a good book in the other.
Harry smiled, grabbing Draco’s arm, his fingers a warm reassurance against Draco’s skin. “As usual.”
It passed long enough that Harry was starting to panic. He worried Malfoy was choking somewhere in the house, dark and away from Harry without orders. When he came back to the living room, arms stuffed with three bottles of firewhiskey and two glasses, Harry sighed with relief.
As Malfoy proceeded to drag his cock out centimetre by centimetre stopping when only the tip was inside, he stilled, perfectly composed, to say, “So you know how torturous that felt to me.”
“‘m sorry.” With some difficulties, they rotate until they’re safely knotted together while cuddling close, knowing it won’t go away until the sun rises again.
And regular as clockwork, Potter would show up every day, Lady Luck in tow, in various degrees of dress.
