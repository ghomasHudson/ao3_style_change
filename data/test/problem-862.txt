“That boy makes my heart smile each and every day. I am glad that I am able to keep a piece of her with me always.” Andromeda says gently to Hari.
The boy and his mother shared similar fair looks with hair so pale that many wixen speculated about Vily ancestry, though the owners of such trademark hair, the Malfoy’s, would swear on their fortune this taint on their bloodline was absurd and their blood could be as pure as snow tracing back five generations or more.
Mildly ashamed of that gimmick in his aldulence, he huntched his shoulders. "Yeah...sorry!" Draco apologized for the first time to Hari and meant it.
Draco looked up startled, “I won’t hurt him…” Narcissa raised her hand, halting Draco’s protect.
Hari stayed awake, stroking his boyfriends long soft strands of pale platinum blonde hair.
Sheryl experimented with Draco's strands of blonde hair with Draco biting his tongue to stop the spew of profanity at the rough treatment of his scalp.
“Where is that Gryffindor stoutheart I’ve known for seven years, Potter? Make it happen. If it flies, you bet I want a go.” Draco said slapping the table, causing the cutlery to rattle.
The sobbing stopped long enough for her son the peer beneath her arms at the scrawny and quaking boy near the sparkling white lights of the Christmas tree with mischief. Unbeknownst to Petunia, Dudley smiled smugly at his slightly younger and much smaller cousin, before pointing to the scene of the crime.
She turned and saw Hari’s curious gaze. “This is a Floo Candle. It has a few different  purposes. I believe the primary purpose is for one to take private floo conversations away from the fireplace without having to inconvenience other guests by requiring them to step out. Instead, you excuse yourself to this private chamber.”
"Why do you call my cousin that, that name after a muggle plush toy?" Draco clarified.
"Family? Guardians?" Nik inquired gently.
“It’s not easy to forget…you know…but it’s a whole lot more freeing to forgive.”
Kreacher was by the bar now, ears barely reaching the top of the counter, let alone seeing properly what he was doing. “I think it’s time to lift your spirits, Master Harry, Sir.” And with that declaration, he waved his hand and the bar opened to reveal an array of alcoholic beverages.
Hari sighed. "have a seat." He said, sweeping a hand to the chairs opposite him.
“Oh?” He remarked as casually as his racing heart and shallow breaths allowed.
Draco’s eyes went wide when he realized is actions and how Hari interpreted it. “No, no! Hari, that’s not it.” Draco reached out his hand again for Hari but he pulled away. “Okay, look. Can we put up a silencing charm, or something?” Draco asked.
You are all so amazing and supportive. I am nearly to 1K subscribers.
"Not much, I never blacked out before from consuming too much firewhiskey, but I guess there is a first time for everything. You?" Draco inquired, trying to put his hands in his trouser pockets, only to realize he was still in his pajamas, and
He knew what that smell meant,
"I am afraid, I do not understand." Dumbledore sat back in his high backed chair. His finger twirling in thought through his long white beard.
Harry asked. Perhaps he could explain more about magic and how to control it.
Trout, for his part only laughed and said, that's life on the street. No showers.
"Dear Salazar, I think that was a joke. That's hilarious." Draco shouted out in laughter.
Narcissa took an unwavering step closer to the high burning flames. Clutching the scroll to her bosom in a white knuckled grip before with a strangled gasp she threw it into the fire. The parchment incinerates immediately, leaving not even an ash.
Second, it helps identify emotions. Scents and tastes are nearly indistinguishable from one another, as such; each scent/taste has a multitude of possible emotions associated with them, beginning with the six primary tastes and emotions. The six primary tastes are sweet, sour, salty, pungent/spicy, bitter, and astringent/dry. These can be combined with the six basic emotions; fear, anger, sadness, joy, disgust, and surprise. Sweet is associated with feelings of love, care, and compassion. When scenting the pheromones released are overly sweet, meaning possessiveness and attachment. Sour is associated with feelings of anger, envy, Jealousy, and criticism which may be result of unfulfilled desires. Salty is associated with curiosity, confidence, interest and a zeal for life, and brings greed and ambition. Pungent/spicy is associated with anger, violence and hatred, but also brings, boldness, vigor and vitality. Bitter is associated with dissatisfaction and anger, brings feelings of isolation, loneliness, grief and sorrow. Astringent/dry is associated with feelings of insecurity, anxiety, depression, absent mindedness and fear.
Hari was looking down at his empty hands, an unusual look on his face. He looked embarrassed; shy even.
"Would you like to look more like your mother, tonight?" Alice had the sudden insight to ask. "I will not force you if you truly don't wish to go drag tonight."
, and marveled at the state of his hand. Blood flowed freely from four deep furrows in his palm, gorged out by his own sharp talons. Before Hari had arrived he had been lost in a daydream; fantasizing while he let his inner dragon out to explore his senses while locked safely in his room. Something he hadn't had the opportunity to do when he first arrived. His mother would be his guide to master his new found powers, and control his instincts in constant battle inside his conscious. Today could have been very bad indeed. First with Weasley, the alpha Curse-Breaker, and then the crowds in Diagon Alley and later the streets of Muggle London.  Although, not caught within the throes of his rut, his dragon was in control when the person of his every fantasy stepping into his dragon's lair.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
Spent, Hari laid sprawled, boneless and sated. His chest rising and falling was the only indication he was even breathing. He felt like he was floating on cloud nine.  A slurping sound roused Hari from his mental space enough that he summoned the energy to raise his head.
"Ah come on, Draco." Blaise whined stomped his foot and flounced his arms.
"Actually, Andromeda may I help?" Harry implored eagerly.
. He then taught me another jinx that gave your opponent pink eye. We practiced on Crabbe and Goyal.
Hari frowned, catching the nuance. “I kiss you and you let me
Sirius inherited the ancestral home and the Black vaults in Gringotts Bank, which in turn were willed to Harry. After he escaped his twelve long years of unjust imprisonment in Azkaban, he then spent two years locked away in in this grim old place for what was left of his life.
Properly mortified at the realization that Draco gave him a hickey and he hadn’t noticed, he clamped a hand to his neck where he could still feel Draco’s lips.
“Where…where are we? We’re not in Grimmauld Place anymore, are we?” The room was magnificent, light cherry wood features accented every corner; framing the entranceway, the molding on the ceiling, the double glass patio doors bookended by west facing windows. Natural light flooded the room with the last embrace of the dying sunset.
The townhouse was heavily warded, to keep Muggles and unwanted Wizardkind out, hidden under a Fidelius charm. For some unspoken reason Harry Potter wanted them to come into the place through the Secret entrance. Narcissa had forgotten all about the secret entrance, it was rarely used. The Secret entrance was located in the back alley, along a brick wall that was taller than her son who stood a nearly a foot above herself. If you weren't paying attention, you'd miss the strange floral like border graffiti that outlined the entrance similar to Platform nine and three-quarters. Letting the house-elves walk in ahead of them, Narcissa took a quick hold of her too eager son, before he could do something rash.
Draco found that volunteered information was always more valuable and less costly than coerced answers, sat back to listen.  He was looking a Cho Chang, the witch in the relationship.
he recited silently in his head, raising his aspen wand to the air, he summoned white parchment and charcoals.
“Guilty” Narcissa said clearly and coolly.
“Wow, if I had known this was possible, it would have saved me a few dozen midnight trips in the Gryffindor comonroom at midnight for floo calls.” Hari exclaims.
"I've been renovating my godfather's townhouse to live in." Hari explains.
As prescribed in his Last Will and Testament, Lucius A. Malfoy’s remains will be prepared for embalming and transportation to the Lord and Lady Malfoy Mausoleum located on the Malfoy Estate, Wiltshire, England no more than five days after death, bringing the date to 24th June, 1998.
Draco caught Hari’s weight, supporting him with one arm wrapped around Hari’s waist in a secure grip and sharp talon tipped fingers nicked the skin of his hip. The small pain causes tingles of pleasure up Hari’s spine.
Hari was startled at Draco's outburst. Narcissa interjected before Hari could. "No one RSVP's, Hari." She said as gently as her pinched lips could allow. "Many ministry officials are under scrutiny by the Magical Law Enforcement and Internal Affairs Department. They cannot be seen associating with us at the moment."
is not under restraints of
Hari plastered his body to Draco's side and looked up with charcoal rimmed green eyes. "Can we go down there, Please?" Hari begged.
Edit 1/10. I was hoping to have chapter 16 up by today, well technically it's after midnight, so it's the eleventh. I'm not satisficed with a certain encounter in chapter 16 and I am working out the kinks right now. I'm over 8k words and it looks likely to be 9k minimum.
Dear Harry,
I have another secret, I HATE PAPA!
lives here and
Draco felt queasy.
Blaise straightened, his smile shifted radiance and he spun to meet his friend with a bone crushing hug and heavy beats on his back, clasped his forearm and shoulder. In commodity, Draco did the same with a genuine smile. He's been doing more of that lately.
Hari jolted at the over stimuli of his taxed penis and didn’t think he could get hard so soon. But the look in Draco’s eyes told Hari he had other ideas than to stroke Hari to hardness again.
Another funeral and a meeting of old flames.
Dudley tumbled into the once glass enclosure. Piers had tried to pull him back, but was dragged down along with his obese friend. Harry sat on the floor of the snake exhibition his mouth open in astonishment.
What like when Voldemort put a taboo on his name that called snatchers to their location if anyone spoke?” Hari couldn’t help but ask.
Harry said astounded.
“Oh, well he can’t really see colours yet.” Placing a hand on her cheek in a move that surprisingly reminded Hari of Molly Weasley. “Your two hair colours are just simiplier for him, I’d imagine. The first colour he’ll see is red, so expect variations of that colour next.” Andromeda says as she takes the stairs up to the ground floor.
"Harry!"
"The savior, the Boy Who Lived Twice, Defeater of the the Dark Lord, that Hari Potter is living with you?" Blaise said almost not believing.
Him? Scared of a Muggle death trap?  “Deathly.” Hari laughed at the unexpected confession.
The sound caught his ears and was the only warning he received before a high pitched voice shouted. "Get out of the way!" However, whatever he was supposed to get out of the way of was lost to him as a solid mass rammed into his side.
"By the time the poor tired overworked guppies arrive, I could have done any number of things to you in retaliation, obliviate you, and Disparate from this place easily." Draco says leaning into Justin with his wand tip at his pulse point. "In fact, I think I'll do that now."
Overcoming the awkwardness of sharing a broom with Draco, the weight and heat of Draco’s front on his back is a stark contrast to the weightlessness and coolness of the open air around them. The feeling was so familiar that it took him a moment to place.
------
“Sorry.”
"Wha-who? Uh...no, I mean, yeah you too." Hari stammered out as articulate as always. To which Draco laughed.
A sales associate near the front nudged her colleague and nodded towards the two studs walking in the door. One was tall, lean, and blonde, while the other was shorter with wild black hair, and green eyes they could make out even from behind the register.
The current bane of Hari's existence was a haphazard pile on his bed made up of the meager contents of his wardrobe. He gave the pile his best withering glare, trying to mimic the disdainful sneer that Draco would likely make if he ever saw such lousy excuses for clothes. Which…he would probably have to, since Harry wanted to look nice for Draco on their date, and these were all his clothes.  Why then, could he find nothing to wear?
Draco saw the logic to the rules that left no room for argument."
A banging of the hammer brought quiet to the courtroom. “Before we give a verdict it’s time to present the witnesses testimony for the accused.” Draco looked around his chained father, now laughing with no sound, to see the confusion on his mother’s face. She looked a little hopeful. ‘Oh please, don’t raise her hopes, only to crush them.’
"Excuse me." He began softly. "Excuse me, sir." Harry hated how his voice trembled. The cussing and movement inside the shelter ceased. Harry was about to call again, when the sound of breaking glass sounded loudly. The homeless man charging out of the dark flaps of the shelter and swung a broken beer bottle at Harry's head and yelled savagely.
"Look, how about I run ahead and get some snacks from the corner shop, then I'll wait for you and Zambini at those tables there?" Hari says gesturing with his chin the convenience store on the corner.
It was the middle of the night and the Dursleys were sleeping. Now would be the most opportune time to test out his theory. If Harry could perform magic, it was now or never.
It had only been a few short days since he’d even thought of dating another bloke. He hadn’t been attracted to Ron or any of his other dorm-mates.  He’d always been attracted to girls…and Draco. He admitted grudgingly to himself.
"Yes? Yes! ...okay, okay...wow." Hari said in excitement. "So...so...Breakfast will be done in twenty minutes." Hari said and rushed down the stairs.
Trying to wake up a portrait when they were asleep was a hard thing to do. That's all they did most of the day anyway. Sirius was a particular heavy sleeper. Tapping on his frame didn't help. In the end, Hari tipped the portrait upside down, nearly flipping Sirius out of the portrait to wake him up.
The gold misty lines rose up to encircle Andromeda’s and Hari’s forearms. Arms twist and the lines latched on like thorny vines. Hari saw Andromeda mirror his wince of pain. A long exhale and then they began.
But, Hari seemed really excited to be spending time with his Godson and Draco together like this.
"I thought today was going to be the absolute worse and had planned on it. Then I got your letter." Draco replied.
“Sheryl!” C’iemone called from somewhere behind him. “Hari is almost done. We are icing down his legs and chest now. His arms were graciously spared, but that was over the fact he didn’t have overly dark and thick hair on his arms in the first place. Arlys is getting the costumes. Draco’s is a bit rushed, but we only had like an hour to prepare his.”
Draco looked curiously at Hari. “Who’s the owl from? Are they expecting a reply?” The other two owls had left immediately after delivering the letters. This one stayed.
The only times Hari could remember being confessed to was on Valentines Day. Those had been awkward enough. There was that one time during second year, Ginny had sent him a Cupid Gram, with a man in a diaper chasing him down the corridor, singing and sprouting poems that professed her ever dying love for him. And...Hari hung his head, embarrassed. He ended up dating her four years later. Hari didn't even ask her out, or confess his feelings, he just kissed her after Gryffindor won the House Cup and that was it.
------
Hari knew most of his 'nicer' clothes had been picked out by either Ginny herself or by Hermione for his dates with Ginny. Even he, with his limited experience with dating, knew that he would be asking for trouble if he wore clothes picked by an ex on a date with someone else.
"Pauvre amour, d
"Really? And what might that be, Malfoy?" Hari said in challenge. How ever will they get along if they keep sniping at each other like this.
The twinkle behind Albus' half-moon spectacles has vanished, the finger let go his beard and the corkscrew curl bounced out of place.
Hari heard the softly muttered words, but chose to ignore them as he raised the kickstand. He then instructed Draco where to keep his feet and hands while in motion. Draco wobbled a little and clutched tight to Hari’s shirt when Hari suddenly jumped up to kick-start the engine with a mighty roar. Draco didn’t know he was praying to every god he could think of, when the engine started and they wobbly started around the side of shed. As they exited through the brick wall that shimmered like going through a smoke screen Hari flicked down the visor that just fit over his glasses. Draco held on tighter as they maneuvered slowly down the back alley, the width little more than a one car lane dipped in the center to allow drainage.
“You did something alright.” Hari gasped out. “You look ridiculous, Bill.”
on underage witches and wizards doing magic outside school and wizard homes,
them? If she preserved their memories in a pensive first, she might be able to simply put them back in their heads.”
"If you boys are done pissing over each other," Cho surprised everyone by saying, "Dudley and I have a date." So saying huffingly, she tugged Dudley up. She was only able to do so because Dudley was in a state of shock.
"THAT CRACK POT OLD FOO--AH!" Vernon yell was cut off by the end of pink umbrella being shoved in his face.
There goes that assumption that Saint Potter was raised in secret by the Weasley’s. Arthur Weasley as guardian would have been able to explain…
Sheryl managed to sound somewhat like the teenaged Hari.
Love always,
"Um...I don't get out much." Draco hedged.
Oh, he tried! To be good. To do as he was told and not asked questions. But his heart and soul was battered and bruised, like his body should have been, except it wasn't. The bruises disappeared, save the memories of the phantom pain.
The Voice Muting Jinx was removed and Lucius screamed out his insanity, “THE DARK LORD SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU ALL! MUDBLOOD LOVING TRAITORS TO WIZARDKIND, ALL OF YOU! I WILL BE OUT AGAIN! WATCH ME…” the Head of the Wizengamot banged his hammer three times, and the Jinx was placed back on him.
Draco scoffed, having obviously lost and reached over the watermelon to the glass clamp jars full of homemade lemonade. He poured Hari a glass first without even asking, then offered the jar with a questioning eyebrow to his mother. Chivalry extended to his boyfriend but not his mother or aunt.
If all went well, Harry would have his godson and his godson's grandmother living with him, and he'd no longer be alone in this world. 'Yes, a big day Kreacher, lots to do.'
“Hari, will you ride with me?” Draco asked as he held up the Nimbus 2001 in invitation. Hari only hesitated for a moment, he looked with longing on the black handled broomstick. He loved flying and missed his own firebolt terribly.
They were ever too pleased to find another Brit in Sydney on an extended holiday. It is rather all bitter-sweet getting to know Mrs. and Mr. Wendell Wilkens. I couldn’t give them my real name. So I gave them the name Emma.
A hand on his shoulder brought him out of his living nightmare, instead of looking up into inhuman red eyes and pallor skin, he looked down into brilliant green eyes in a face of tanned skin.
“Potter it's bloody 30 degrees (an exaggeration) out here, and you want me to wear a sweltering cloak, aye, I’d surely catch my death under that thing.” Hari furrowed his brow, before it smoothed out when he laughed.
Draco lost track of time, his senses focused solely on Hari before him. The lights danced over Hari's exposed arm in a rainbow of colorful circles that beamed its rays around the dance floor below. If Hari's hair was loose from its tight braids, Draco was sure it would bounce with the music like soft dark clouds. There was no room for talking, not that they couldn't hear each other without shouting in each others ears, but the movement and general breathlessness would have prevented Draco from talking anyway.
Kaa coiled back in on itself in thought.
Hari gurroffed at Draco’s struggle attempts at getting in, holding Teddy secure as the hammock swayed ominously. Once in, Draco pulled Hari closer to rest his head on his shoulder. Then he gathered Teddy and snuggled him in the other arm. The ropes held them snug together in quite a picture.
"Rubeus Hagrid, but never yeh mind tha." The half-giant calls out. "lookin for Harry Potter, ey am. Canna ya brin the young lad out?" He said cheerily, forgetting to sound stern like the Headmaster warned.
He had a great big shaggy beard, hands the size of dinner plates, and feet a large as a two medium sized dogs. His worn leather pants had patches, and his absolutely humongous fur coat had the half-giant standing out like a sore thumb in the neat and tiny street of Privet Drive.
Draco panicked and took Hari's arm in his and walked as briskly as he could away from the man. Draco's flight or fight instincts were battling within him. The man was strange. He spoke of things that were impossible. Draco didn't want to admit he was frightened, but he was.
The feeling wasn’t enough, Hari wanted to see. Using what felt like the rest of his depleting strength, Hari forced himself onto his elbows and heaved up onto his forearms.
I was worried sick. Surely he was killed, drained of blood, changed into a vampire or vampire slave. I was nearly hysterical. I can't believe I blubbered that bad. The only thoughts in my head were, "I wanted to be his friend."
They built a bonfire; large and surrounded by firebreaks. Hari looked on in surprise as Andromeda, Narcissa, and Draco pulled items from behind the altar. Narcissa held an official looking scroll with a red ribbon tied in a bow. Andromeda pulls out a bundle of letters on Muggle lined paper. Draco had a book in one hand and a large black bag of something in the other.
"Haha, sweet right?! Every week the club hosts a different theme; last week was Cowboys and Aliens, and the week before that, famous celebrities." Alice gushed.  "This week is Queen's nights. I am sure Sheryl will be wearing something fabulous and she'll know just what costume to dress you two in."
This funeral would be different than the other funerals Hari attended. For one it was Mr. Malfoy who was being buried, someone he loathed since second year. For another, Mr. Malfoy's body was going to be entombed underground in a crypt rather than placed in a pine box six feet under.
Anger momentarily forgotten, Hari asked, baffled, “Is this some sort of pureblood thing?”
"You, you've been seeing a shrink! I need a shrink for all the abuse and bullying you've put me through!"
Hari wasn’t afraid; he was excited, spectacularly aroused by the vision in his dream. He’s fought a dragon, rode a dragon, and now kissed a dragon.
"Hey Dray..."
Hari looked at Draco seriously. "Those are the first scars that I inflicted on anyone. Draco, I almost killed you."
"I'm not some young maiden you could spill sweet words to to make the damage you've done irreversible. I'll go..."
"Ah, mon amour, the sting of unrequited love can hurt so much." Sheryl crooned.
Over his mother’s head, Draco shared a look with Hari. He  was receiving the same treatment, but from his aunt, who absently wiped a smudge from Hari’s forehead. Seeing something on Hari’s neck, she went to wipe that too, but halted with a tittering, “Oh my.”
Narcissa tsked at her son’s obvious alpha display of possession. Hari didn’t seem to mind sitting criss-crossed with his own plate in his lap. But he didn’t know that her son was scenting him outrageously.
Hari had specs of mud on his glasses, while Draco had several splotches in his usually perfectly groomed platinum blonde hair. They sat on the muddy grass Hari perched on Draco’s lap with a white knuckled grip. Hari didn’t know if he was breathless from the fall or from laughing so hard. He looked up at Draco and lost his breath for another reason entirely.
If anything, Draco's smile became more predictor like. "Dudley, then. Hari had quite a crush on Cho, even asked her to the Yule Ball at school, they dated, kissed..."Draco let that sink in, "how does it make you feel?"
Indeed, what Hugo said was truth. "History has its truth, and so has legend."
Or for those Atheists out there; April Fools!
Mrs. Malfoy put her life on the line and betrayed her own pure-blood believes in order to save her son. Some might tack that on to being a self-preserving, cunning, and ambitious Slytherin, but not I. In the end, she did the right thing in the moment that mattered most; she saved my life. What she did was extremely brave and that makes her a hero in my eyes.
“You see this, Potter?” Draco spat out his name. “That shut you up, did it? Yeah, maybe my hard dick down your throat is exactly what you are begging for, isn’t et, Potter?” Draco growled low in his throat, voice glottal.
"Blaise." Draco said in relief.
“Hey not all redheads are Weasley’s. My mum was a redhead.” Hari said when he saw Draco’s look and accurately guessed what he was thinking.
Hari couldn’t fathom why he would, but he shrugged and bit his lip to listen intently. He pushed down negative feelings he was having at that moment.
Narcissa hugging her son around the middle, resting her head on his shoulder. “It is a horrible feeling to hate oneself. It took me years to learn to love and appreciate my dragon. He’s one of the reasons why I named you Draco, in honor of him. I knew you had to carry Lucius’s name, but I wanted you to have a part of me in there too. When going over astrological names, I knew that by keeping the Black tradition alive I was also honoring my dragon, which was so much a part of me.  He makes me feel so strong. I know at your age it can seem your dragon is fighting against you, but… but I hope you learn to love yours as I love mine.” And so saying, her eyes changed to reflect her dragon; pupil-less swirling pools of iridescent colors.
"Well..." Draco sucked on his teeth for a moment, "as long as all four grandparents are magical, id est, as long as none of your grandparents are Muggle, the grandchild would be pure-blood. Keep going back a few more generations thinking the same mindset, you have descendants who..." Draco trailed off a bit sheepishly. He entwined his clawed fingers with Hari's, making sure not to cut him. "think they're better than everyone else." Draco finished.
"Of course, Love. Why wont you go in person to their trial?"
The poor middleman handling her husbands mortgage didn't know what to do either. He was told the residence was empty but here a women in her forties stood with a crying infant in her arms. Ripping off the letter he had just nailed to her door and hasty putting it in her hands he said, "good day," and scampered out of there. The sound of the car door slamming shut woke her out of her stupor and she closed the door on the world.
“It’s time to go, Petit Dragon.” Narcissa said as she gently led her son to the two graves, picking up first one handful of dirt and then another, she loosened her fingers over each grave. Draco, following his mother’s lead, grabbed his own handfuls and watched as the last particles of dirt fluttered to the ground, soundlessly putting the boys he once knew to rest. And thought, ‘It was my job to make sure you two finished school, and now because you loyally followed me, neither one of you would ever finish. I’m sorry. Goodbye.’
"If you dare call me Uncle Hari, Malfoy; I'll punch you."
Hari searched Draco’s eyes. “You do that.” Shaking off the shift in mood, he instead asked, “So, is it a boyfriend’s shirt type of thing?” He tried again as he searched through more clothes.
Harry replied.  "
“You said you have nothing to wear, right?”
Kaa revealed.
Unaware of Draco behind him, Hari startled when his voice sounded right behind him. “This place certainly has seen better days,” Draco says, his voice echoing down the hall. Hari whirled around effortlessly shushing Draco by crossing his finger against his lips. They stared into each other's eyes for a heartbeat, then two. Hari’s face slowly blooms with color.
It was Narcissa that drew Draco out of his musing. She cleared her throat, “Dot, Kocoa!” Two female house-elves appeared in front of them, cowering, with long noses touching the floor, rumps in the air.
Cho reeled back, and frantically looked between he and Dudley. A hand rose to her lips in a silent 'Oh'.
"Is she going to sit the whole song?" C'iemone says with a touch of concern in her voice.
"Oui,
Harry Potter took Kreacher and cradled him in his arms as he ascended the grand staircase in the entrance hall, Asclepius (Ask-lep-ee-us) twisting and winding his way up the banister in his wake. Once on the
"Not in front of my mother, or aunt." Is all Draco said gruffly, secretly thrilled that Hari wanted to address him by his first name at all, let alone giving him a nickname. "Don't you dare call me anything demeaning like, Draky-pooh, or any such nonsense, or I'll push you down the stairs."
“It probably just cut through the alley. Come I promised you ice cream. We’ve lost our place in the queue.”
Harry did not think his plan through
"This is the library, I believe all the dark arts books have been removed, but in any case you all have access to this library. I want this place to be very much your home as it is mine. So lets try to get along." Draco had to stop suddenly so he wouldn't step on Hari's heels. He stopped and turned around to Draco offering his hand. "Malfoy."
“Did you see that!” Hari and Draco said as one.
Hari thought with a tinge of jealousy.
The sales person barked a laugh. “Oh boy, you two need help.”
"I am serious, Sirius! Draco confessed. Now what do I do." Hari blurted out, mortified.
Sighing heavily he squinted at the tiny blurred numbers on his wrist watch given to him on his seventeenth birthday. Eyesight, horrible as ever was no help. So he threw out his arm hazardously at the nightstand by his bed to scramble for his glasses and his willow wand.
April 2020 Update: Chapter 13 will be updated on April 20th. I hope to also have chapter 14 up at the same time. Subscribe to receive notifications about when that will be.
The first House Quidditch match is today. Harry will be playing Seeker. Because of Harry's fame there will be a lot of people in the visitors stands cheering for Harry.
Hari stood awkwardly behind him, with one hand raised to rub the back of his neck. Draco called over his shoulder. “You may look too, you big ninny.” Hari scurried over.
They gradually slowed to a stop before Hari proclaimed happily, “We’re here! Look.” And so saying, pointed to the right. Draco didn’t know where here was. Draco had a hard time distinguishing landmarks between rows of nearly identical tall townhouses with a small scattering of shops littered between residential homes.
“I…I really couldn’t… ma’am. Take handouts, that is. I…ah…could work for it…” The person he now took to be named Sheryl, threw up her hands, rolled her eyes, and shook her head, all at once, her gold bangles on her wrists clanging together. Whoever hurt this boy, at least didn’t stomp out his manners and work ethic. She thought.
p.s.  Harry is the youngest Seeker in over a century. I am envious.
"They've been called. By neighbors and by teachers. I've told my teachers. Somehow my relatives are always able to convince them, I'm the trouble child, the freak, the liar." He sounded angry, but more he sounded hurt. Nik's heart hurt for the boy, to have adults not believe him, or disappoint him over again. "The Service workers don't return and some of my teachers fired."
Hari just said sighed and said, “Enough Kreacher, you understand your punishment. What did you and Koako want?”
Draco snickered at Hari’s clumsiness, doctoring his own tea with a splash of cream and tablespoon of honey, he blew pointedly before taking his own sip.
Draco was embarrassed. Red faced he glanced at the person in question who was busily pretending like he wasn't curious by the exchange in French. Draco cleared his throat and nodded his head once in acknowledgement of his mother's advice. Taking heed, he took a deep breath, scenting the air and felt is amour die with the cold taste of snow on his palate.
“Ungrateful carrier pigeon.” Draco grumbled, breaking the seal and unfolding the letter. Something small and gold fell into his hand.
I watched through our connection as Voldemort gave him a task to complete upon his initiation into his ranks and with its completion a promise with veiled threats. He was to kill Albus Dumbledore and Voldemort would then free his father from Azkaban. Kill the Headmaster and his family will have their honor restored amongst the inner-circle. The veiled threat was, fail and his father will never get out of Azkaban alive; fail and he and his mother will die. Malfoy, once proud to final have joined the adults and become a Death Eater, was ambitious enough to believe that he could easily kill Professor Dumbledore and restore his family's honor to its former glory. In actuality, it was a fool's folly, because Voldemort had set him up for failure, he does not give second chances, and is not merciful.
Draco paled. There was just so much food. He looked over at Hari, who looked now at him with laughing eyes. “Come on Dray, dig in, you don’t want me to pay for all that food do you? Draco tried to dig in with as much gusto as Hari but soon fell behind Hari’s quick small bites.
"Oh, we'll be here. Is Connor on the floor?" Sheryl winked as she made her way to the middle of the sectional. Alice jumped with joy and took her place next to her lover. C'iemone and Aryls took the left side, that left Hari and Draco on the right. Draco took the outside edge so Hari could sit by Sheryl.
Narcissa and Draco held no disillusionment about their welcome; their grudging truce will expire the moment the final grain of dirt lands on the freshly turned graves. The Aurors would be the only ones standing between them and their certain death, as the Malfoy's had no wands to protect them. Draco's Hawthorn and Dragon Heartstring wand forfeited to Harry Potter, and Narcissa's wand, Holly with Dragon Heartstring, given to Draco, was destroyed in the very same fiendfyre that Crabbe met his demise in. Even if they did make it out of the trials unimpeded, they will no long be welcome in pureblood social circles.
An hour later, Draco held the door open and helped one-handed as Hari shuffled out the door with pram they bought stuffed full of baby items for Teddy.

“That was beautiful, Master Harry Potter, Sirs. Can Kreacher listen to another song?”
Hari stumbled out of the restroom and straight into Draco's back. 'Oops, sorry Dray. Hey, did you read the bulletin board next to the mirror. They have this safe word to use with the bartender if they don't feel safe with their dates. order an Angel shot or ask for Angela at the bar. Isn't that cool? Hey, Draco are you listening to me?" Hari said grabbing onto Draco's arm to look around his shoulder, "ooh."
I didn't go to the hospital wing, because I didn't want anyone to know about how much pain my own Father caused. I am not very good at managing pain on my own though. Zabini noticed I was having a difficult time walking and offered to get me a numbing agent his mother gave him when he was accepted into Hogwarts. I do not know why his mother felt the need to give him a translucent numbing potion, but it helped with the pain.
“Pardon?”
“The Jury has come to a verdict,” the Prosecutor shouted over the noise of the Wizengamot.
Taking Draco’s hand between his own, he placed the scissors between thumb and forefingers and guided the first snip. “You have to cut away the old to make room for the new. It doesn’t damage the plant in its entirety. The roots are still intact. Your still you, you’ve just grown, matured, not changed, just flourished. Even when the petals change color from cross pollination they are still the same tiny flowers, pretty and sweet smelling. They rely on nutrients from the sun, soil and even water. Nature provides all of this, but sometimes…
Harry wasn't in the mood for celebrations and parties. He wanted peace and quiet. Was that too much to ask?
And he did, until the summer before Sixth Year. Needing a place to hide while fleeing from his cousin and his gang of friends that liked to beat on their favorite punching bag, Hari went to the one area where he knew Dudley would be caught dead seen near, or else faces his father’s wrath. Hari was, of course, forbidden to go to this particular area as well. Naturally, this meant it was the perfect place to escape the Dursley’s and the war. The weeks before Dumbledore collected him from the Dursley’s he found solace roaming these streets.
“Welcome to The Angel, London’s non-stop shopping destination in Islington.”  Hari chirped out as if reading an ad in the Daily Prophet.
Tittering laughter met his ears. He took deep breaths, closing his eyes briefly. He tried talking himself into believing this a spa treatment as to feel more comfortable with the situation.
Draco’s lips formed silently over the word ‘cinema’ in confusion. Hari panicked even more.
Before he knew it, Draco was being pulled to the nearest shop, having completely overlooked the sign and door to the Leaky Cauldron. Instead, the man pulled the door open to a used book store, shouting, “Hey, this blonde kid belongs to any of you?” Panicked now, Draco began tugging desperately at his arm.
“What no, I wouldn’t. Not even in school would I have done that.” Draco said a little tersely. “Don’t joke about things like that.”
"Awe, right... haha. I'll ...er...get changed right now"
"Hmm" was all Hari said as he eyed Draco up and down, none sexual in the least. "Not so little anymore, are we, Dray?" Hari said teasingly. Draco knew that the comment was not meant as an innuendo but Draco found the heat rising, and he fought the urge to adjust his tightening trousers.
“I have nothing to say to defend myself,” Narcissa began, “I am the wife of a Death Eater, this very man before you now. I lived in his house, Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire. I did everything I could to please him, trying to be a perfect wife. I gave birth to his heir, my only child, also here before you. I hosted elaborate parties and joined my husband, as is my duty, in all his social gatherings and yes, those included Death Eater meetings. After my husband’s arrest when he broke into the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic, he left me and my son defenseless in our own home, because the Dark Lord made the Manor headquarters. We no longer felt safe in our own home and were being held hostage there.” Narcissa paused there, to add dramatics to her story or to clear the lump in her throat, Draco had no idea. But then she spoke again, and Draco was sure he couldn’t speak even if given the chance. His mother was using her testimony to defend him.
One thing Draco knew for sure, ‘learning to control his new found power and instincts would be a bitch to manage.’
A slow smirk formed on Draco’s lips. How would Hari react? Head resting against Hari’s shoulder, he glanced up from the work he left on Hari’s neck, eyes widening at the sight he was met with. Kiss swollen lips, ruby red cheeks, and a slight glistening of sweat.
The hallway looked bare without its gallery of portraits. Narcissa carefully took stock of the empty walls, remembering once before her pre-Hogwarts day running down this hallway and getting scolded by the many portraits of family members. Going up to the first floor landing, Hari showed the Malfoy's the parlor, how to get into the Library, the private study that Hari claimed as his own, and the garden in which they first entered. On the same floor as the parlor was a tiny guest bedroom and small bath, that would remain unoccupied for now. It was the same bedroom that Ginny and Hermione use to share on their visits, but Hari wasn't going to say that.
Then it was Draco’s turn. Hari watched with rapt attention as Draco raised his red candle with both hands. “Passion born of fire, I beseech you.” Draco said gravely. “Grant us our own metamorphosis, as embers stroke to life the rebirth of fire.” Four candle flames shot high in the sky and the fire under the cauldron burned to life. “As from the ashes we rise, reborn anew like the dawning morning, providing light, and warmth, and life to the earth each day, for the dawn of tomorrow.” He ended. Ignoring hot wax dripping down his arms, he placed the red candle on the altar in its proper place. Using his wand, Draco levitated a seed over the cauldron and with the help of his mother, he then cast
Dare he say, Hari looked aroused. Taking a subtle whiff of Hari’s neck, he smelt the ever present smell of snow, but beneath it, Draco could just make out the heady sweet smell of Hari’s arousal. It sparked something in Draco and his dragon yearned for a mate, for Hari, and his alpha’s instinct was urging him on;
"Zambini," Cho nodded in tense greeting, then after a pause she added another nod, "Malfoy."
” and opened both windows in the drawing room, not realizing that he also opened every window and door in the townhouse as well.
"This...this...my dragon. It would have been another stain on the Malfoy's good name. Part dragon part human. A failure on my mother's part. As if she can control which genes get passed down." Draco scoffed at the thought. "I love my dragon. He makes me feel powerful, invincible, free, like I wasn't before. More so, it made me closer to my mother. Ooooh, that reminds me." Draco tore off unexpectedly, all but diving beneath the mound of pillows in his bed.
“I have to give you a report on what happened at the Manor and Gringotts.”
That destination was a few more alleys down, not a dirty or smelly. It appears the garbage bins behind these shops didn't have as much rotten food product inside. "Welcome to my humble home, Alleycat. I'll show you the ropes..."
Harry frowned, certain he was missing something, but for now he nodded solemnly. "We have a deal."
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
There wasn't a linear timeline for how and when to process grief, they all grieved in their own way and in their own time.
“Yesss, Dark magic is bad for thisss houssse, corrupt and twisssted magic, corruptsss and twissstsss mindsss of all who dwell here. Thisss Kreacher of yoursss, good thing he’sss dead, now with Massstersss Light magic, you can help to heal him and thisss houssse. Sssnakesss like usss are good with rebirthsss, transssformationsss, and healingsss.”
Andromeda inquired in French.
"Well you already get a free tab, so its not going to be like at
"Draco?" The man inquired as if acquiring a confirmation before confronting him.
“You don’t want to return to Hogwarts?”
Everything was in its rightful place, except--Where was Draco?
Draco licked down the column of Potter’s throat and leaving nibbling kisses at his clavicle. Potter’s nipples stiffened and goose-pimples pebbled on glistening wet skin in the drafty castle bathroom. Draco arched his back some, bent his head and licked at Potter’s too tempting nipples, before giving a stinging bite, a soothing swirl of his tongue, and moved on to give open mouthed kisses down his abdomen. His tongue dipped and swirled in Potter’s navel, before following his happy trail down further. Draco looked up trough hooded eyes, and impossibly thick eyelashes, to peer at Potter with
"I was trying not to maul Potter!" He gritted out as Narcissa lowered to her knees and raised his bloody third degree burned hand to eye level.
How does he even know for one, and two why does everyone think I am obsessed?
Raising one long sleeve to his nose, he breathed deeply and then slowly exhaled, letting his scent waff out to settle over the fabric. He did this over and over again, rubbing hands, neck, cheek, and nose over clothes after clothes; effortlessly letting his scent mingle and settle.
“Oh, Hari.” Was all Narcissa could say as she looked into the now empty fireplace?
What's one more to add to the numerous ones Hari's attended. Fred's, Collin's, Lupin's, Tonks', and so many others of those who fought and died in the war. Hari thought he would always carry around the guilt for the rest of his life.
Kingsley Shacklebolt an imposing man of over six feet of African flesh in Wizards robes stepped through the fireplace, dusted off his hat looked down at Harry Potter and said, "What is this letter about wanting to free the Malfoy's from prison?"
Harry sat down with arms wrapped around his knees, he didn't bother turning on the light. His cheek felt hot, and swollen. He raised one trembling hand to his stinging cheek. Hissing, he pulled his damp hand away. He was in shock. That was the first time his aunt had ever hit him. Usually it was just Dudley that pummeled him.
Today is my twelfth birthday. It's a nice day outside. I wish I could be anywhere but studying for this bloody Charms exam I have this afternoon. I wish I was doing something fun, instead I am studying for exams. Exams are always the first week of June. My birthday falls during this time. The summer term, or last three weeks of school are supposed to be easier with all the Professor's grading tests, finishing final grades, and finalizing schedules for next school year. On the thirtieth of June the End of Term Feast is held, and then July first we take the Hogwarts Express home.
“If she is a foul mouthed, biggotted old witch who always called us all blood-traitors, mudblood lovers, and filth, then yes.” Hari responded.
“None of that, cub.” She set Hari back down on his feet again, glancing over his shoulder at Draco. With a sly grin, she continued, “I’ll forgive you if you introduce me to your man, here.” She crackled at Hari’s horrified expression.
Draco, however; never gave up on his attempt to join once more with the Wizarding World. Draco first stop was Ollivander’s to purchase a new wand for the two of them.  When he arrived, Mr. Ollivander was tolerable to his presence in his shop even after the cellar renovated cell incident during the war. He was in the process of having what must have been the hundredth wand reject him when Mr. Ollivander’s nieces came crashing through the door, miraculously or rather magically, the spiraling tower of wand boxes remained stacked.  It was them that refused him service and ran him out of the wand shop to the waiting crowd outside Ollivander’s. Due to the same arsehole Aurors useless presence assigned as security detail to him, stood aside as the mob threw bloody rocks at him. Rocks! Savages all of them. Draco came back to the Manor with a horizontal cut on his left cheekbone, and scrapes and bruises upon his body. Draco and Narcissa continue to remain wandless.
Is give it to me when you get home
"If you did, it's not like I could see underneath your trousers." Alleycat was definitely laughing at him now. "Besides, your pretty enough to pass as a girl if you wanted to wear a skirt, but hey, to each their own." Alleycat ruffled Draco's gelled back hair, sending strands and gel flacks askew.
"The Sacred Twenty-Eight was a list of twenty-eight true pure-blood families in the 1930's. These families allegedly didn't have any muggle relations for at least three generations back."
Alice laughed along side Sheryl who chortled.
Reply in the comments!
There had been a commission in the Professor's stands. Severus had fallen off his seat, along with several of the other professors.  He was flustered but otherwise fine.
His eyes quickly flickered between it and Hari, relieved that it was closed. Only his blood could open the journal. Hari couldn't have been able to read it, without Draco opening it with his blood first. But it begs the question, how did Hari have possession of his journal in the first place?
In his room, embarrassed at being sent away from the table like a misbehaving child, and grateful to finally being behind a door with a lock on it. This was just his first rut, it wasn't even considered a full rut, but a pre-rut, and his next one would last longer and be more intense for him. He was just lucky that he got to spend any time with Hari during this time than none at all. If it was a real rut, he would have been locked away from Hari for days. Thinking back on the morning they spent together, Draco scrambled for his journal that he kept for as long as he could remember. His mother, showed him how to lock it with his blood, so no one could read his private thoughts. A good thing because his thoughts, and this journal was full of Hari James Potter. On that note, he opened the journal and wrote with quill and ink, Hari's proper spelling for his name.
Before the man could report with an equally scathing remark, a more timid voice interjected. "awe-hum, actually...the co-signer on the house indeed is a Mrs. Andromeda Tonks."
"Ssh, hush my Dudders, what's wrong."
“I don’t remember Sirius ever mentioning a study. Where is it.” Harry inquired as he swiveled his head around to take in all the detail.
Narcissa glanced over at Andromeda, Hari didn't give off the same pheromones as they, being unpresented and all, but they could still smell some emotions. What they smelled was a faint scent of distress and aggravation. It didn't appear to the two sisters that Hari enjoyed these encounters anymore than Draco did.
Hari thought from beneath the sleeping wizard. Hari had managed to pull his wand from the table above their heads and so knew that it was now half passed three in the morning. He didn't know why he didn't just leave Draco's naked ass in the study and go to bed, but he was still laying beneath him an hour later.
With Hari's help, Draco flopped on his canopy bed with a ridiculous amount of pillows.
"NEVER, INSULT. ALBUS. DUMBLEDORE. IN. FRONT. OF ME." Hagrid bellowed. Then he turned the umbrella on the large boy and a flash of light had the little boy squealing, clutching his arse cheeks together.
, he continued walking.
Taking a deep breath, eagerly seeking out the scent he so desired, but only smelling the sweet nectar of honeysuckle, jasmine, lilac, wisteria, rose, and cosmos, with the unmistaken smell of snow. Frustrated that he couldn't make out his desires scent from the vibrant garden surrounding him, he stepped out into the open grassy yard.
Hari felt silly, but as they rotated, three white foggy rings circled them like floating hula hoops. So it must be working.
Closing his eyes once more, Harry decided to shift his thoughts. Perhaps his thoughts were not specific enough. Instead of thinking,
Harry didn't understand what he meant. So one day Trout took him down a different alley where this female cat was acting all weird and in pain like, arching her back, and screeching up a storm. Then a larger male cat streaked into the alley.
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
Just then the telephone rang and aunt Petunia rushed up to answer.
"Circe, Hari!" Draco exclaimed. "My housemates and I always wondered if you even owned a comb!" Draco said with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
Draco thought of la Dame Noire, his mother's villa in the south of France; a magnificent expanse of stone turret, tall arched windows, and high peaks. It rested on a cliffside with a vineyard that rolled downhill. A small sleepy village rested just on the edge with perhaps a hundred families-Muggle. And beyond the village between two green hills, a view of the ocean and its thin strip of white sand beach.
"Hari don't be such a prude." Draco called somewhere over his shoulder in the general direction of Hari's mortified posture. "Did you know Mama Bear, I kissed him the first time I saw him this summer, with tongue mind you, and he thought it was just some French greeting."
As if sensing Hari’s insecurities, Draco reached out to push the fringe away from his eyes, and cup his face. Smirking at the questioning look on his face, Draco lightly grazed his thumb over Hari’s cheekbone before tugging him in to capture one last kiss.
Draco’s head jerked in his hands, he coughed and sputtered as hot strings of cum ribboned out of Hari and covered Draco’s face in hot spunk. Like accepting a gift, Draco opened his mouth and aloud the last ribbons to hit his tongue, and he swallowed.
"Sorry." Harry let out a sigh himself.
In the center of the room, Narcissa; dusty and sweating with a rag protecting her hair as she revealed an antique coffee table with a flourish of dirty cotton, as dust swirled into the air. She was laughing as she said, “See Andra, I don’t mind getting a little dirty the muggle way. It’s nothing a little refreshing charm won’t fix once we are done.”
The queue for the club was roughly fifteen bodies long and every single one of them had to stand in the rain and wait. The gang as Draco deemed to call it, scrambled out of the 'vehicle' as dignified as possible. A hard feat, with a leather skirt so short he had to wear lacy nickers so his--he refused to call his manhood something so undignified as, junk--didn't show. So what if his nickers showed.
Hesitating, Harry looked apprehensive between Kreacher and the amber liquid he swirled stalling for time. Before with a shrug he did as Kreacher instructed, bracing himself for the burn. Harry was pleasantly surprised by the undertones; smoky, spicy, and sweat, but still burned like fire. Coughing once into his wrist and clearing his throat, he said, “another.”
Draco touched the golden handle, and a white light seemed to radiate from the core, and the wood hummed. Every hair on Draco’s body stood at attention. “Very good… very revealing, Mr. Malfoy. This wand is 13 inches made of aspen, a slight curve at the tip, surprising, no? NO! Oh well, this wand core is brother to your mother’s. Draco took a closer inspection of the design carved into the golden handle; it was of a dragon eating its tail, Ouroboros. It felt perfect.
(See the end of the chapter for
Narcissa didn’t know what to do without any gold, she never held a job before, and how would she be able to maintain her lifestyle. Merlin, how would Draco take loosing his inheritance. No, no, Draco didn’t deserve any of this. All she ever wanted was him safe. Desperate she grasped at straws, “My sister, Bellatrix, if she dies without a will, her vaults would liquidate back into the Black’s vaults…”
Flipping a few more pictures and articles over, he came across the formal picture of Hari at the Yule Ball, standing in a corner, brooding. Always brooding. Draco remembered that night, he was confused, scared of his thoughts and feelings, his lustful desires he saw as wrong. He lost his virginity that night. To Pansy Parkinson. His friend. It was wrong, they both knew it. She with girlish dreams, thought she loved him, and he a confused boy fighting his own lustful desires for another boy. And oh boy did he regret that that night for everyone thought he was in a relationship with his friend, and they played along for two years.
"Oh, ho-ho." Sheryl chortled.
So many people will show up in the visitors stands, because Harry Potter will be playing.
It was Hari’s turn and he prayed he wouldn’t forget his lines,he hastily tried to cram into his brain the night before.  Lifting his blue candle to the west, he shakily began his part, his voice growing in confidence when he looked to Draco and saw his gentle encouragement. “Water of love and life, I beseech you.” Hari blushed scarlet.
Hari nodded at her question, not realizing he was already agreeing to their party plans as it was. But then a thought struck him.
“I didn’t even know.” Hari sat back a little lightheaded.
Harry Potter believes that He-who-must-not-be-named is still alive and wants to use the Philosopher's stone to regain his body. What? That had to be why Father didn't want me to stay at Hogwarts over the Holiday, and why we strengthened our wards at the Manor for Yuletide.
12 September 1991
“Harry, Harry Potter. Nice to meet you, Asclepius.” Harry somehow managed to croak out politely.
Sheryl circled the two teens, an easy head taller than Draco. She hummed in contemplation. "Yes, it could work." She then laid eyes on Hari. "I've been imagining this look for you for ages, my cub. We have some work to do before you can begin your reign as true Queens."
Draco struggled with himself. Clause 74, of the Statutes of Secrecy was enforced by
“Riches and fame not enough for the birds to come flocking?” Draco mocked.
The voice belonged to a very old and wrinkly goblin with gold, jewels of multiple colors, and even beads that she- for it was perhaps the only female goblin Harry had ever met, wore from head to toe. She looked very regal and imposing sitting just over his head. Her eyes were also a milky white, with no pupils, the female goblin was blind.
'This boy...outrageous...what will he do next?' she thought to herself as swayed Teddy close to her chest.
He didn't know if his cheeks were red more from embarrassment or anger, but he swirled around ready to confront him for it, when he heard Narcissa scream and Andromeda shrieking.
They were forced to take the tube, because inexplicably his uncle’s car paint boiled off and was replaced with tie-dyed colors. Hari insists that he didn’t have anything to do with it; that when he was washing the car it just happened like magic. Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him and got even madder for using the ‘m’ word. Hari still could feel the stinging burn of his belt smacking against bare skin and the empty hollow sensation in his stomach of going without supper. Hari was only seven years old.
It was Dudley who responded, "At the supermarket, actually. Cho-Cho was having difficulty choosing parsley in the fresh produce section."
Draco sat with mouth gaping in assoundment. He then tossed his head back and laughed roarishly. “Touché, Potter. Touché.”
The only problem was Draco. He kept staring and it was getting quite annoying. Andromeda was chatting away with Narcissa like twenty-seven years and the war hadn't happened. Draco on the other hand was quietly staring at Hari. "What?" Hari hissed out of the side of his mouth as he took a sip of his morning tea one handed. Draco startled as if Hari had shouted at him.
Sheryl saw Wanda, the woman who called him to scare away the poor boy in the first place, snooping from her hiding place and subtly shook her head in warning. Wanda was kind if a bit misguided in many of her ways. She’s open her mouth to spread gossip in a minute, not understanding when a line had been crossed, then act confused and hurt when confronted for it. Wanda certainly would have opened her big trap and blurted out, that indeed Sheryl’s Place hadn’t any eaters challenge, and that Sheryl just couldn’t turn a poor starved and beaten boy away from her doorstep hungry. Sheryl was sympathetic to the boy’s plight, being far more insightful than she ought to be, as she was that boy at one point in her life, when she first moved to London and struggled to make by.
Narcissa had to close her eyes in embarrassment for her son. "See love, you make great decisions, lets go to bed, am I sleeping in your bed or are you sleeping in mine?" Hari hissed, and Draco yelped.
Hari mimicking the baby’s position, gently encouraged Teddy to go on. Slightly confused and in awe of the sigh, he watched from his position just inside the door.
Draco snorted out a startled laugh. There may have been a snot bubble, but Draco would never admit that.
minus the lyrics 11,543 words. And for those of you who didn't know, over 8,000 of these words were originally part of chapter 15.
The entrance of the bank is a small white marble steps that lead up to bronze doors, flanked by gold and red clad goblins. Inside the bank are two rows of goblins that flank the length of the lobby with hundreds of goblins standing guard, while others goblin clerks work the counters upfront. Upon the bronze doors is a rhyme that dissuaded thieves:
He thought as he hurriedly switched the heat off and jumped when frigid water touched his skin.
"My husband... is in jail. because of you. Social workers will surely be coming to check out your..," She sneered, "living conditions. I will be calling a lawyer. You." She spat out, "will stay in your cupboard until I say otherwise, and when the social worker comes you will say exactly as I say." Her words left no room for argument.
“Hell Sheryl! From the sound of the boy’s stomach he would be honored to sample your fine B.B.Q, which you have never tasted the likes before.” Hari blushed. He actually got accustomed to eating burnt food that it had become an acquired taste of his. He loved the smoky taste of barbeque brought out, and from the smell of it, the restaurant catered directly to his tastes; at least when it came to food.
"Try a million." Draco shot back.  "Golden boy." Draco scoffed. "Captain of his House team. Brown nosing up to the Headmaster. The Headmaster would never expel him. No matter how much trouble he and his friends got into. He was just beloved by all. "
He cursed internally as his body reacted on its own accord, desire making itself known with a twitching of his cock in sudden too tight trousers. It was too much as an icy chill settled over his bones. Urging his erection gone sooner, so that the icy torment could leave his body. putting an end to the twitching in his pants.  He didn’t want to know what would happen if he crossed that line he’s been toeing this entire time.
Hari was asked to make a wreath of flowers and instructed to gather jasmine, rose, lotus, and wisteria. So from the balcony he gathered a bundle of wisteria. From his rose garden he took a dozen roses, he then had to de-thorn. Jasmine was easy to find with its white starburst petals gleaming against pale green shrubbery. The lotus was more difficult to find. The garden did not have a pond in which they normally grew.
"I know and that is why all is forgiven." Sheryl said running fingers over his scalp. "You don't know much about the LGBQT+ community, do you?" Sheryl asked.
A scar in the shape of a lightning bolt!
yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
"You know my nephew then, I can imagine that impersonation you did of him comes from experience. Are you friends?"
How was Draco going to get by without a wand? How was he to return to school in the autumn only a few short months from now? How was he going to handle his peers, his course work, and his creatures’ Inheritance?
"Now to outfit the queen." Sheryl said gleefully. "Arlys, get the manakins. Sheryl leaned down to squish her face next to Draco's in the mirror and Alice did the same on his other side.
"Oh so you too are dating, then." Sheryl tugged hard on his hair. "C'iemone! Arlys! You owe me 20 pounds." The salon went quiet.
Harry didn’t know what time it was, the hallway had no natural light to go off of, and the pocket watch that Molly Weasley gave Harry on his seventeenth birthday broke during the Battle at Hogwarts. He was sweaty from the over exertion of using a great deal of wandless, wordless magic, and filthy from being on the floor and dispersing the dusty spectre of Albus Dumbledore at the entrance. Rebirth, transformation, and healing are what Asclepius told him his magic would do for Kreacher. An emerald and copper snakeskin now surrounded Kreacher like a shroud, once the skin flaked away Kreacher would be alive, more youthful than ever before. All Harry could do was sit at the bottom of the grand staircase and wait for him to wake up. For the first time in a long time Harry cried with relief and gratitude; Kreacher would live.  And he hoped beyond hope that Kreacher would forgive him.
“Yes, and my aunt and her family were biggotted, entitled blondes, but I don’t hold that against the Malfoy’s.” Hari counted.
Hari went rigid in his arms. “You’re not going to throw me off this broom are you?”
Hari stood on tiptoe to deliver a quick peck to Draco’s said and very pointy nose. “Yes it is. Let’s come inside before the statis charm breaks on the gelato.”
It would soon prove to be a more difficult task than previously thought. The Malfoy’s were now shunned by nearly all members of the Wizarding community in Great Britain. Pure-bloods associated with Death Eaters and the Dark Lord’s regime, were persecuted. Neutral Pure-bloods who refused to choose a side during the war ignored them, and pure-bloods on the Light side were outright hostile in their verbose denunciations. That was not to mention how the Press slandered their ‘good name’ on a daily basis.
that met at his temple, and no matter which way he turned his head, it looked like the light cast shadows over his face artistically. He arched one brow. His lips were painted in a glistening
Hari eventually instructed Draco to get up and find some other objects to play with Teddy. That was when he found the puppets.
“Hari, let me tell you about a family legend.” Draco began. “It is said that the House of Black comes from a long and prestigious noble line. There is a legend of one such family member, Melusine. Legend said she was a dragon disguised as a beautiful woman, able to enchant any mortal man. Such was the case that she seduced and married a king among men, and had two beautiful children with him. But the people of the town they lived in were wary of her foreign blood, and distrust her, not even knowing the enchanting truth. One day the townsfolk convinced thier king that their queen was a monster and needed to be locked away or killed. So they trapped Queen Melusine. She cried and she pleaded for her husband to trust in her and believe in her. But he turned his back on her, and in anger she transformed into her dragon form and in a rage burned down a portion of the townsquare and took one of her children with her. :leaving one more for the King’s heir. That heir could also turn into a dragon, he married and passed down his blood to the next generation, and the generation after that, until today. This is the story the members of the House of Black tell their children.”
Draco consumed him, not with fire, but with desire. He felt his whole body set aflame with it. When Draco’s hot, moist breath fanned gently over the straining red head peeking through the foreskin of his cock--teasing; Hari’s head fell back on another breathless moan and his arms trembled trying to support his weight from the sensation.
“Well, I was orphaned at my Muggle relatives. So I wouldn’t have that particular advantage would I? In fact, I’ve nearly been expelled a few times for using magic at my aunt’s house. I got off with a warning during the summer before second year, because a house-elf used a levitation charm and I was blamed for it. It belonged to the Malfoy’s. I still have no idea how it got the idea to get me expelled so I could be safe.”
"What are you doing with my son?" Narcissa asked.

Draco thought, not realizing that bike could also mean the motorized kind as well.
expression, Draco resided in his fate. Clearing his voice he began;
Hari sucked in a startled breath as the dragon raised itself from the chaise with a creak of wood and advanced on him. The sound of sharp talons clicking on the hardwood floor, muffled as it crossed over a carpeted area, and then louder as the beast moved ever closer.
The day at the zoo was surprisingly fun for Harry, despite the sweltering heat and great disappointment in not getting a day to himself. He manages to puppy-dog eye the ice cream van owner to get the Dursleys to buy him an ice-cream with lunch. It was only a lemon pop, but it was refreshing and Harry wasn't going to complain. He was even allowed to swipe Dudley's knickerbocker while he was throwing a tantrum over it not having enough ice cream on top.

The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
I could see his lips moving and he wasn't breaking eye contact. But then I saw the look of panic in his eyes. I was relieved that he was helping. It never crossed my mind that it was him performing a counter-curse. He wouldn't harm a student, even if he hated them.
“I suppose then, I will be arranging a meeting with the Greengrasses to dissolve your marriage contract. We will of course, need to come to some type of settlement for the breach of marriage contract”
The encounter had to have been less than a couple minutes, but in his panic all he could think was, he didn’t make it very far.
Was that a drunken flush to Hari's cheeks or embarrassment? "I'll show you mine, if you show me yours." Was the serious response he got instead. Draco found himself the one blushing.
"You said my father was pure-blood but he also has creatures' blood? How is that possible? And you, you boast about blood purity when you have creatures blood." Hari waved his hand to indicate all of Draco, his eyebrows scrunched together in bewilderment. "I thought, you're lot loathed half-breeds."
“Kiss me and I’ll let you see." Draco said with a twinkle in his eye.
“Witches and Wizards of the Wizengamot, and fellow peers on the jury today; let us make the trial brief for the accused. Over the last couple weeks, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has been collecting vital evidence, for this case. We have presented to you all the facts. Now is the time for the accused to be read their charges, the accused will plead their cases and bring forth witnesses on their behalf. Usually, a few select members of the Wizengamot would then question the accused, but seeing how we had full cooperation from two of the three Malfoy's, this step will be passed over. Finally, the Wizengamot will come to a vote, and each of the three accused will be given their verdict. Let’s begin.” Draco was relieved that the trial would be short. He only had one thing to say in his defense, he knew his guilt and accepted it.
"Do you want to change the subject? I want to change the subject." Draco voice was muffled against his skin.
Draco spoke up, “We are beholden to you, Minister. Thank you for mine and Mother’s freedom.”
"You ruin everything." Dudley said sulkingly, before turning back around in his seat.
"Naw, nothing bad, its good! Rossilina is well, Rossi's pregnant. Four months. We didn't want to say anything as she had so much trouble with the last baby and wasn't sure if, well we tried twice before and she lost the last two. But this one, the baby is doing well."
Learning to navigate between alpha-omega dynamics could be problematic for the Eighth year students interacting with the rest of the school. Twenty-five percent will have some form of a manifestation of their creatures’ inheritance and guided by their instincts. Twenty percent would be alphas; highly temperamental, aggressive, and possessive. The other five percent would be omegas; normally gracious, seductive, and protective. Two different dynamics, two different temperaments, yin and yang; yet add an alpha in rut or an omega in heat-chaos will ensure.
"Are you up yet?" She demanded.
He couldn’t help the hot embarrassment that burned his face and even a bit of shame that churned in his stomach. He couldn’t even remember the last time…
That’s it then? Sirius Black was named his godfather, magical law would have made it possible for them to discuss it, but he was in Azkaban for twelve years and then a fugitive for three before his early death at the hands of his aunt Bellatrix. His second cousin couldn’t possibly have explained it to him, and no one else could.
He was quickly but neatly shoveling small bites into his mouth, teeth barely flashing against the silver of the fork, before he glanced up at Draco. Covering his mouth with fork still in hand, he said, "Hurry up Dray, we have a busy day ahead of us." With a small nod of acknowledgment Draco dug into his own breakfast, with more gusto than he was brought up to consider etiquette. Not knowing if the meal was more enjoyable, because he hadn't had a proper meal in days, or if it was because it was made by Hari who ate with him.
Reply in the comments!
"I got you." Draco said pulling Hari into a closer embrace.
Before Draco could comment, they heard the distinct whoosh of the hearth in the basement erupting in tell-tell green flames, letting them know the Floo network was open. Hari from the parlor above spoke through the Floo, “Alright, Bill. The Floo will be barred behind you.”
Draco now has the last laugh, because as the last surviving male Malfoy, Draco is head of the household and master of the Manor. It was time to clean house. Draco opened the wards on the gate, letting his mother and himself onto the grounds. To their left and right, large expanding yew hedges lined the gravel walkway to the front of the Manor. Somewhere in the distance he heard the gentle sounds of a fountain. Off too his right a screeching honking and shrill call sounded.
"Didn't think he'd be much of a shy boy, but he's just standing there." C'iemone says.
Kreacher saw his master staring out the glass windows and asked, "Would Master Harry wish to eat outside on the terrace patio?"
The tingling sensation had been the loss of circulation in his hands from clenching a fist too tight.
"I suspected but didn't want to believe that anyone would abuse you. I thought it was the Weasley's at first."
The whisper of breath returned and something soft and wet nudged the slit of his penis.
"Blasted house-elf! Something to numb!" Draco could barely concentrate his thoughts through the pain. "Star Grass Salve...get the..." CRACK. Dot had left. Presumably to do what he ordered.
It was Hari that finally broke the silence. “Um…Dray?...you know, I…I’ve been answering your questions all night. Will you answer one of mine?...er…after this one that is?” Hari corrected. When Draco gave a nod of consent, Hari continued, “Why did you do it?” At Draco’s perplexed look, Hari elaborated. “Why didn’t you turn me into your father and Voldemort? You knew it was me, but you said you couldn’t be sure.”
"Singing,
"Bad news, Vernon. Mrs. Figg broke her leg tripping over one of her diseased cats. She's at the hospital and can't take HIM." She hissed out, greatly displeased with the situation.
Harry, it is my punishment for tampering with their memory. My charms, I fear they’ve worked too well. I haven’t been able to restore their memories. I thought to keep away, but they saw me at one too many tourist places and started engaging me in conversation.
Next Draco traced the jagged knife wound on Hari's arm. Its position mirrored the placement of the Dark Mark that marred Draco's own skin. Hari knew this mark. The origin of this scar haunted his dreams still. The final task, the towering hedges, the Cup that was a portkey, Cedric's death, being chained to a tombstone, helpless, hopeless. The cold of the metal and then the sering pain as the knife carved his blood out of his skin, so that Peter Pettigrew could use his blood to resurrect the body of Lord Voldemort.
“Surely you’re having me on, Potter. Having a right laugh at me, are you? Answer me this, Potter.” Draco demanded. “The Death Stick, the Resurrection, and the Invisibility Cloak; exist?”
"Now, Dudley. You see this year some of them are quite bigger than last year." Uncle Vernon sweated, trying to appease his irate 11 year old son.
He pulled up on his motorbike, apprehensive about what the reunion would bring. He cut the engine and unclamped Draco’s hands from across his abdomen. Draco needed to dismount first, and he did so on wobbly legs. Taking off the helmet, Draco quickly tried to set his hair back into a neat and sleek blonde tail. Hari just rolled his eyes, slowly swung his leg over the end, set the kickstand, and unbuckled his helmet absently, revealing disheveled black hair that he didn’t bother trying to fix.
Said tongue continued its journey back up and behind his ear,
"Draco!" Blaise said more than happily.
“The car!” Draco exclaimed. “Second year, you and Weasley flew it into the whomping willow. Weasley’s father worked for the Misuse of Muggle Artifact, he was tinkering with it to make it fly, or he confiscated it for himself.” Draco actually sounded impressed. “He can fix it up, then?”
“They are my favorite flower and they’ve been used to celebrate Litha in the House of Black for generations, long before my daughter was born. It is tradition. Besides, I have many more.” Andromeda says handing over the basin gently.
Apparently Hari had enough of the attention as his magic suddenly sent the crowd to the cobbled street. Draco managed to stay on his feet when Hari’s magic spontaneous lashed out, and saw fleetingly Hari’s head disappear around a building. Draco hurried after him, somehow getting to the alley before the crowd realized which direction he went, and hastily hissed out, “Disillusionment charm and Disapparate now Potter.”  Draco rushed away, not wanting to be trapped in the dead end. He heard the unmistakable crack of Hari Disapparating. He had no choice but to make his way to Ollivander’s by himself.
He lumbered up the walkway, not worrying about smashing trimmed grass beneath colossal feet on the edge of the paved walkway.
"You destroyed Helga Hufflepuff's Cup? How? Why?" She got out.
“Mistress Tonks-Black wants to eat breakfast in the garden, as well.” Kreacher piped up.
“We didn’t want any of the other students to know. But in private, I called him Uncle Severus.” Draco shrugged.
Sirius cleared his throat again, the sound Draco heard the first time.
The portrait of Sirius slapped his knee as he gave a snorting crackle of a laugh, "I'd say Pronglet, if you are considering dating my second cousin."
Still listening secretly from outside the Parlour door, Draco hissed in a hoarse whisper. “That’s servants work!”Draco said in a hissing whisper. His facial features expressing outrage on his ‘maybe’ boyfriend’s behalf.
And suddenly, Harry was angry.
After a moment, Hari perked up. “I’d be damned.” He breathed, looking over Draco’s shoulder. “The drawing room’s been here this entire time. No wonder no one from the Order knew about it. Mrs. Black’s portrait hung right across from the door. We’d never be able to open the door, without waking her up.” Hari exclaimed.
Draco kept his eyes on Hari standing on the side of the stage waiting his turn, or his doom. The last time Draco saw Hari look that frightened he was fourteen years old facing a Hungarian Horntail.

For two years she searched the streets, hoping to see a familiar mop of unruly hair, or a flash of bright emerald green eyes behind rounded glasses. After all this time, her wayward cub returned. She waited patiently for him to lift his head and meet her eyes. He had a lot to answer for, worrying her like that. But when he lifted his head, all that anger fled to be replaced with affectionate relief.
"Yes, but Father wasn't suppose to marry Mother, but Aunt Andra." Hari gasped. Draco paused at Hari's reaction and then leaned in with a mischievous smirk. "Aunt Andra ran off with a Muggle-born, and so my grandfather Abraxas Malfoy arranged the contract with my mother instead, who hadn't presented. When my mother presented as an alpha and not a beta, like everyone presumed, my father had no choice but to go through with the marriage, else pay a hefty fine for breach of contract and there was no other eligible women to marry in Britain at the time who fit the pure-blood rhetoric. So he married Mother, or else move away and loose the Manor. It was not a happy marriage." Draco concluded.
Hari mistook the shudder for revulsion, and his elation turned into a sulk. “I just wanted to get something for Teddy. Geez, you can wait outside.”
"It wasn't a shame for her to marry Mr. Weasley. He's a great man, and a great father." Hari almost growled.
"Yes, yes. The plan was carefully orchestrated to be done after your rut. not during. It was extremely rude of us to just show up without warning. Why I am surprised Hari even had the foresight to clean out our rooms yet."
-------
Harry just grinned wider, white teeth flashing against sun tanned skin and emerald eyes the rivaled the lush greenery of the magical garden, said "No problem, Mrs. Malfoy. Call me Hari, Please. And I have one more surprise for you inside." He said tilting his head slightly back and over his shoulder towards the patio doors.
Draco through off his unease with a chuckled. After all, he quite liked how Sheryl called him Hari's man. "Let’s begin." Draco said smirking.
He listened ten seconds to see if his aunt would return, before he hummed a happy nonsesnual tune as he looked for socks beneath his cott, shooing away annoying spiders.
“Hari, dear? Will you please look after Teddy for a while. He needs a nappy change and to be fed. I would ask Dot, but it’s Monday, and she’s a bit obsessive about having the sheets changed. I need to be with Cissy at the moment, she’s suppressing her emotions and instead keeping busy with the Litha preparation.
Smiling ruley, he swiped a strand of long hair off the parchment he was quickly etching Hari’s carelly menstrations with Teddy with charcoal, and tucked it behind his ear. Third year he stopped wearing his hair like his father, a very subtle disobedience showing he didn’t agree entirely with his father. Now he’d have to change his hair again, or else risk being mistaken for his father on the streets and cursed in the back.
“How did you...?” He sputtered. “Don’t you dare say anything.” Sirius warned.
“This is not about your inability to control your alpha.  Not completely. You must understand that Hari is not yet eighteen. You are at the mercy of
Draco let out a relieved breath before smiling with a hesitant smile that turned his lips sideways.
"Who are you talking about, Severus, the father or son? Because son shouldn't pay for the sins of the father. You don't know the boy, nor do I." Minerva moved closer to Severus. "and the son is missing. Harry is missing and you owe it to Lily, to James..."
Draco was tempted to nip at the retreating finger. He also desperately wanted to snog Hari senseless, even with that ridiculously cute smudge of soot on his brow. Instead he smirked. “If you wanted to lay hands on me so desperately, you could have found a more interesting place to do so.” Draco leered with a suggestive eyebrow wiggle.
Hari stood up and looked around the garden. Yes, it was magical. It was like a little oasis within a city of concrete. Here within the protection of charmed walls, the Muggle world didn’t exist and the wizarding war never touched it. It was his perfect sanctuary.
"I can see that!" Came the clipped response from his aunt. Green eyes met pinched blue in the rearview mirror. Harry gulped. He had never seen his aunt so angry before.
------
And he endured. And he suffered in silence.
All Draco could do was listen. He wanted to tell his mother to stop; she was testifying on her own behalf not his. It was fruitless, he was guilty. But she continued to talk and Draco didn’t dare interrupt or else risk the Wizengamot ending the words of her final tesimony. “With my sister, Bellatrix as Conductor, I made an Unbreakable Vow with Severus”. Draco did not know about this part of the story, and wondered if it was true, or if his mother was lying to protect him. “The Unbreakable Vow guaranteed Severus would do everything in his power to protect my son, and if my son could not finish the task set for him by the Dark Lord, then Severus would do it for him. And he did. Severus killed Albus Dumbledore.”  Narcissa leaned back slightly, uncrossing then crossing her ankles on the other side. “My son finished the first task, yes, but under duress. I was held hostage at the Manor, I couldn’t escape, and my son feared I would be killed. My son could be accused of a lot of things, but heartless is not one of them.” Narcissa head was held high, and she looked every member of the Wizengamot in the eye. She would not back down. The charges against here son was damning. For some reason Narcissa and her son were given some leniency before the trial, but surely the evidence stacked against her son…
