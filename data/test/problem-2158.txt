Ron’s eyes narrowed, but he roughly grabbed Draco’s hands and they shook twice before letting each other go. Ron turned on Harry with alarming speed as if he was trying to change the subject and said, “I didn’t get your name before that tosser interrupted you?” And with those words, Harry froze. He was comfortable and ready to tell Ron his name before Draco had been in the carriage, pleased to have made a new friend, but he suddenly felt afraid to continue. He knew he had to, so with what he felt was from the depths of his courage, he took a breath in.
He remembers the gasps and how loud the Weasley twins had been, even from how far away he was sitting. He could never forget the way, “We got Potter!” seared into his brain because Draco was the one who they took Potter from. Potter was his until he wasn’t.
If Harry was surprised, he couldn’t help but to react. He never could quite figure out what made the other boys laugh at him like they did. The only thing he was focused on was making his teachers like him.
“What’s a Malfoy?” He asked.
Draco, who for all intents and purposes had been incredibly well behaved even for an eleven year old, seemed exasperated all of a sudden. His eyes flashed and steeled in a way you don’t usually see such young children wearing before their life had begun. Harry considered that maybe life had left Draco behind a long time ago. “What’s it to you?”
Draco glanced quickly at Harry. Harry couldn’t figure out why, but the moment was over already and Draco had moved his attention back towards Ron. “Nothing,” he said, holding out a hand as he stood up again. “Pleasure to meet you.”
He spent five years resenting Potter for it. Five years of letting his fathers opinion take control of him. Weasley could never get past his name, and Draco couldn’t get past being in a different house, so Draco proved him right by constantly staring down the edge of his nose at him. He wanted to not be Slytherin so bad, but he was, and so he took it out on Weasley.
Harry only seemed to laugh at that, his young age setting it out more like a giggle. “Yours are silver.” He said, fascinated and pleased that he had finally seemed to catch this boy’s attention.
When Harry was a bit older he had felt something was wrong with him. Sometimes when he was mad the things around him exploded, when he was sad the wind would pick up a little faster, and when he was happy there was almost always a forceful spring in his step that seemed to help him skip down the street. Yet somehow, he was still shocked when Hagrid told him that he was a wizard. He was in a haze of over-excitement, too happy to be clouded with the fear that it might be taken away.
Harry gave a particularly nasty smile to the girl at Draco’s side on the train. He didn’t know why he felt so protective over Draco, but he had a bad feeling that if he let Draco walk away with her, he might not come back. So Harry grabbed his hand and forcefully pulled Draco into the carriage he was sharing with the ginger-haired boy. Draco stumbled over his own feet as Harry had pulled him rather forcefully. The girl scoffed and flicked her hair over her shoulders with a swish and stalked away as Draco collapsed into his seat, falling on top of an unsuspecting Ron Weasley.
“So’s my father. It’s because I’m a Malfoy,” he had said with such dignity and pride that Harry almost laughed again. He didn’t know why, he just felt infected by his own giddy mood.
it's hard to write from an eleven year old's perspective and limited understanding of social interactions going on around him. i promise the writing will clear up soon enough, but they're supposed to be a bit awkward right now.
Every so often, Dudley would do this for Harry. A new belt, a new jacket, a new pair of gloves. Some band-aids or an extra apple. It didn’t happen often, and they were never the right size, and sometimes too late to help, but it never mattered to Harry.
“Harry Potter.”
They were not, by any stretch of the word, friends. They were not brothers. Dudley continued to bully and antagonize Harry. But Dudley even at ten years old seemed to recognize what abuse was before Harry could. So Harry couldn’t throw out the oversized muggle clothes at first, even if he couldn’t explain why.
“What other Harry Potter is there supposed to be?”
“My father isn’t me.” Draco repeated himself. He made eye contact with Harry as he said this, as if he wasn’t sure of his words yet, but that he wanted to believe them. And for some reason, it was important to him that Harry believed them too.
Ron seemed to realize at the same moment that Harry did that Draco had known all along. He shook his head, and broke out into a grin. Ron and Harry made eye contact, and Harry could tell he was doing his best to avoid looking at his scar, which Harry still appreciated. “‘M not so great, just Harry,” he said uncomfortably as Ron opened his mouth to say something else.
“Pure? What’s that mean?”
He never told anyone this, but he also kept the clothes because he felt bad throwing away Dudley’s old clothes on him. Nobody ever knew it wasn’t just Petunia who tossed Dudley’s old belongings at Harry without looking him in the eye when he could no longer fit into his trousers.
The reaction was instantaneous. Ron dropped the licorice wands he had been holding. Draco slowly sat down again without lowering his eyes from the boy sitting across from him. For some reason, he didn’t seem as surprised as Harry thought he was going to be. Harry felt ashamed, like the name he had known all his life belonged to somebody else. He lowered his eyes to the ground before he heard Ron ask him with something sounding akin to horror, “the Harry Potter?” At this, Draco’s eye contact broke as he turned his attention from Harry onto Ron. He seemed nonplussed by the question, but for whatever reason Harry couldn’t figure out why.
“Snape showed up. He seemed pretty pissed about that spell Ron used.”
“Harry, I'm hungry. It's already dinner-time.” the blond whined.
"Blaise is exaggerating."
“That’s stupid. We’re friends. You should have told me.”
When he'd eaten his fill he yawned and tried to find a comfortable spot to lie down, whining quietly when he put too much pressure on his injured paw.
When Draco returned to his room, Harry was lying on his bed, staring up at the red canopy. Maybe it was the fact that Luna had reminded him of the date, but Draco thought he looked sad. He felt disgusted with himself when he remembered all those times in the past where he'd made fun of the Gryffindor being an orphan. Only when the dark lord had threatened his own parents had he realized how horrible it must've been for the younger boy.
“No. Not right now.” the blond objected.
"It got my dress dirty!"
“And I guess Blaise will be taking his little Ravenclaw.” Draco changed the subject.
“I guess he wouldn't show it to everyone. But if he thinks it might get him allies... And in Slytherin it just might.” Draco mused.
“Doesn't mean I like you.”
The dark-haired boy smiled at the assurance and bid them goodnight. It still took him some time to fall asleep again. When he finally did, he dreamed of two naked bodies, entwined on white sheets, blond hair and pale skin in the moonlight. This time he woke with a raging hard-on and a strange sense of longing. Making sure that the silencing spell was still in place, he quickly took care of the problem, before getting up to join the others for breakfast.
Yes, they had robbed Gringotts. Unfortunately they hadn't been subtle about it. How long would it take until Voldemort learned of their break-in? How long until he discovered just what had been stolen? And once he did, he would finally know that Harry was looking for Horcruxes. Which would make finding the rest of them all the more difficult.
Harry tried to hide his grin. He knew that it usually took his boyfriend a lot longer than that to make sure he looked absolutely perfect.
“Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s get rid of those bloody horcruxes.” Sirius demanded.
"What if you found some bloke who would increase your social standing? He'd have to accept that." she changed tactics.
It had stopped snowing during the night and now the sun had come out, so it was actually a really nice day. They put on warm coats, scarves and hats and started strolling away from the house. Harry led his friends down a narrow path into an open field. Nothing to destroy here. Perfect. He took a deep breath and turned to face them.
"Malfoy." Harry says.
"Well, you may recall the very public announcements of our break-up four years ago. We certainly haven't moved to the countryside to start a family since then." His palms have gotten sweaty, though he knew this would come up eventually. Had intended it, hadn't he, when he invited Draco to join them?
Something flickers in Malfoy's eyes at Harry's movement, but it's gone before Harry can figure out what exactly it was. Regret? Disappointment? Hurt? He’d seen enough that he knew to feel ashamed of himself, and his face flushed.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione are squeezed into their normal booth at a wizarding pub right on the edge of Muggle London, just like they have been every Friday night for the last four years, almost without fail. They had found this place entirely by accident, when Harry and Ron had worked a case for the Ministry that led to a raid just down the street. Afterwards they'd wanted a drink and noticed the pub, its front windows darkened, it's sign old and weathered. When they found out that the barkeep had a strict no media presence rule, and that any pestering of patrons would no be tolerated, it was basically a done deal. They'd been coming here ever since, the reprieve from prying eyes well worth the slightly overpriced and mediocre firewisky and the slightly charred food.
"Wait," Draco blinks, his face scrunching like he's trying to focus very hard on something through the fog of alcohol. "So, what you've really been saying through this whole story is that you're really not together with the sh- I mean, the Weasley girl, and the rumours from four years ago were, in fact, not rumours at all, but true?" Draco looks intently at Harry.
"So, would you like to join me at my booth or not?"
Draco’s fingers are suddenly stroking across the back of his hand, where Harry hadn’t even noticed they’d come to rest so close together on the tabletop, and his body is leaning forward slightly, his nostrils flared wide. If Harry didn’t know any better, he’d say that Draco was breathing in his scent. A low growl seems to be coming from the back of his throat, and Harry gulps.
Malfoy pauses for a moment, scanning Harry's face, likely to see if he was attempting to take the piss out of him. Apparently he doesn’t see anything troublesome, because he nods once with finality. "Alright. Then you can call me Draco. It seems mostly fitting -- Healers are often called by their first name when their patients are familiar with them outside of the hospital. Classmates from school ought to be okay being equally as informal."
"Sorry, I didn't mean - that was rude of me. I know it must be hard. Mine was hard enough, without having my private business splashed all over the newspapers."
“I don’t know, you tell me.”
"Not really, no." Harry says, absently. Once anger might have surged in him at her statement, but he knows she just doesn't understand. Can't understand.
"Thank you, Hermione!" Harry cuts in with a sullen glare. She’s impervious to his reaction and simply lifts her chin a little higher. Harry finally sighs and leans back with his eyes closed, attempting to lift his arm to rub his temples to stave off a headache but stopping with the searing pain spreading through his arm once more. "Well, since you've got me here and I'm in a shite mood, I could do with a little peace and quiet until the Healer arrives. Why don't you two go check on the game or Rose or something."
"No," Malfoy rolls his eyes, and for some reason the familiar hint of disdain makes Harry feel a little better. "I mean I'm sorry for what I said and thought when we were in school. I thought you were some spoiled git, arrogant for all your fame, living a charmed life and loving the spotlight. I said a lot of nasty things, to you and about you. And I'd like to officially say I'm sorry. I know now that you're not like that. I'm sorry for assuming you were. I-" He pauses and draws in a breath. "I know what it's like to be in the limelight, getting attention you don't want, and wishing more than anything that you could just have a little anonymity for a little while."
"So, you three've been mysteriously absent from the news the last few years. Especially you, Mr. Golden Boy," Draco stabs a finger clumsily against Harry's chest. "Why is that? Moved to the countryside with the she-weasel to start a little family?"
Ron looks at Harry with a hint of sympathetic amusement, though his own stern resolve in their decision to bring Harry here stops him from fully pitying the man. He follows his wife, leaving Harry to rest in his humiliation alone.
"No, that's not it. I -" Harry takes a breath. "Is there any chance you'd be willing to keep me here a little longer? Tell them it'll take some time to be observed or something. Or tell them I also hit my head, can't get back out there right away." Harry feels shame at asking but can't keep the pleading out of his eyes as he stares at Malfoy.
"It's not the same situation, Harry." Hermione presses. Harry brushes her off and starts to stand.
Draco is hot on his heels and they’re barely out the door before Draco is taking the lead, pulling Harry around the corner of the pub and pressing him up against the cold stone wall of an alleyway.
He rests his head back on his pillow again and closes his eyes, mortification sinking in. He'd been really off his game recently, but he still couldn't believe that he'd completely missed the bludger flying right at him. He was terrified to find out the results of the game, and to face his teammates. It may not have been the Quidditch World Cup but still, while playing in a league his team counted on him. He was glad he'd banned delivery of the Daily Prophet to his apartment; he could only imagine the way he'd be ripped apart for this latest mess up.
“Bloody idiot,” he mutters again, as he drunkenly tugs Harry further into the alley. Harry smiles, and the last thing he thinks before he apparates is how glad he is to be a wizard.
Ron looks at her confused, "Wha-"
“Why,” Draco growls, straining at his hold. Then he reels back. “Oh, shite, did I totally misread this?” He swears deeply and starts to pull back.
Harry slumps onto the bed with a grumble and glares at Ron as his arm falls off Harry's shoulders. Ron just lifts an eyebrow in response and leans back, crossing his arms across his broad chest, his Quidditch gear making his already stocky frame seem even bigger than usual. Harry glares balefully at him as he shifts back on the bed, trying to hold back a wince – and failing, based on the smug look on Ron’s face. Harry cradles his right arm closer to his chest and tries not to twist his torso more than necessary, to avoid another stab of pain from his aching ribs.
He moves to the door but before he crosses the threshold he turns back. “Oh, and I almost forgot. Due to the nature of your injury, I’d suggest staying off your feet for the next week or so. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to make practice for at least two weeks to give your body proper time to heal from all the damage from today’s accident, and I’m sorry to say that likely means you won’t be in proper competitive level for the next competition. Healer’s instructions.” Draco flashes him a blinding smile and a wink. “Harry.” He strides out the door.
"Harry," Harry suddenly blurts out. Malfoy looks startled.
Before Draco can fully absorb this surprising proposal, the barkeep sidles over and levels Harry with a weighty look. "You know the rules; no pestering. No special exceptions. This guy bothering you?" He directs his question towards Draco, though his eyes don't leave Harry. After a moment of consideration, Draco tilts his head slightly towards the man.
Harry smirks for a moment. "Tracking me in the news, huh Malfoy?" He jokes.
Malfoy looks down at his clipboard and fidgets with his quill, writing notes with aching slowness so, Harry knows, he doesn't have to look up and face the vulnerability he'd just showed. Harry swallows and looks down. While he'd known, after the war, that Malfoy regretted most of his actions during their Hogwarts years, and that much of the darker tasks he'd undertaken had been against his will, Harry had not expected to understand Malfoy on such a level. But now, thinking about it, there were few out there who understood his position quite so much as the man standing across from him.
Ron and Hermione's eyes flare wide, and their heads swivel around to look in the same direction Harry had.
"We have to go home," she says strongly, narrowing her eyes at him while maintaining her smile. She pinches his side lightly, making him yelp, and he quickly allows her to shuffle him out of the booth.
"What for? It's not like you made me sign up for the league."
Draco opens his mouth, clearly about to make a scathing comment about the Quibbler, and Harry raises a challenging eyebrow at him. He clamps his mouth shut again with an audible click, and Harry offers him another smirk, lifts his glass, clinks it against Draco's nearly empty martini, and downs the rest of it (water) in one go.
Harry blushes and looks down. "Well, I got sick of being an Auror pretty fast – after spending my entire adolescence fighting, I quickly realized I'd had enough of it. I stayed long enough to make sure things were relatively stable after the war, but after a few years I quit. I helped out at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes for a little while with Ron and George, but they got into a good rhythm and I wanted to move on. By that point Andromeda - your aunt - was getting older, so I took over care of my godson, Teddy, from her. I got a small house on the outskirts of Muggle London and... and I've been working at a daycare there where I have Teddy enrolled." He looks down at his fingers, his face flushing deeper. He doesn't know why he wants Draco to like this life choice, but he does. He was very proud of it, and he'd found more joy in teaching the young ones (and the fact that none of them new his past) than he had ever expected.
"Harry. That's my name, you should use it."
Draco squints for a moment, then - "Ah! Yes," his eyes light in recognition, then he frowns. "So, it was true? I assumed it was a load of rubbish - they had nothing to back up their claims, and you weren't making any statements, and you all but disappeared shortly after. Then she moved to Wales to join the Holyhead Harpies, so it was all hard to say one way or another."
“No!” Harry all but shouts, and pulls him back in. Then he chuckles, his hands planted firmly on Draco’s hips, and drops his head onto the taller man’s shoulder. “No, that’s not it, but I’m not kissing you for the first time when you’re pissed right out of your mind. I’m not that much of a git.” He hesitates and looks up into Draco’s eyes. “I don’t want you to regret anything once you’re sober.”
"It's fine, Potter," Malfoy says, his voice devoid of emotion. His eyes flick over Harry's chart in a perfunctory way, and Harry finds himself studying the sharp lines of his jaw, the strong bone structure that had once seemed pointy and now simply seemed regal and, damn him, sexy. Harry forced himself to look away, clenching his jaw.
The trio's laughter dims, and Ron’s flush deepens to a darker shade of red, but Draco seems to notice and waves an absent-minded hand. "No offense intended, mate. Old habits, old habits." He seems to have missed out on Harry and Hermione's silence, so Harry clears his throat.
"Why, is there something else wrong? Did you hit your head? I didn't catch anything, but my scans were focused on the clearly injured areas I was informed to look at."
Ron and Hermione, who had been debating the merits of letting Mrs. Weasly take over their wedding plans (Hermione arguing that she'll organize it to her wishes, not their own; Ron arguing that saying no to his mother was sure to guarantee a painful death - to which Hermione huffs that at nearly thirty years old, Ron should realize he's well past the age where it's alright to be afraid of your mother), finally seem to notice Harry's preoccupation, as their banter peters off with confused looks.
Harry recognizes the look, and the feeling in his stomach rises again. He starts to realize it's a mix of sympathy and recognition.
"Right, right, I forgot, we ah- we have to go, terribly sorry mate. We'll see you soon. Draco," he nods awkwardly, and with a final wave the two of them are quickly out the door and gone into the night.
"Alright...Draco." The two men stand staring at each other for a moment, unsure of what to do next. Then Harry shifts and winces, and Draco's eyes fly back to his arm.
Draco looks at him warily. "Potter," he says slowly. Harry smiles slightly in response. "What can I do for you?" His face is cautious, and he looks like the last thing he wants to do right now is something for Harry. Now that Harry's close to him, he can also tell that this isn't Draco's first drink. His pupils are slightly dilated. Not to mention how rough he looks - his usually meticulous hair looks like he's run his fingers through it multiple times, and there are dark circles under his eyes that Harry had at first assumed were shadows cast by the dim lighting. Underneath his cloak he's wearing a simple pull over and plain trousers. He's completely missing his usual flare.
"What is it, mate?" Ron asks.
Harry meant it as a tease, but Draco, who had been listening raptly, winces and shifts away.
Draco lifts a pale eyebrow and leans back on his stool to look behind Harry at Ron and Hermione, who are openly gaping at them. He offers them a small smirk and a finger wave. Harry bites back a chuckle. "It's fine, they'll behave. I promise."
"Harry," Hermione asks carefully. She's studying him, though different from when she was worried that he might start something with Malfoy. Rather than being worried for him, she's worried about him. She seems to understand sooner than Ron does. "It's different, Harry."
Draco doesn't buy it. "Why? What's in it for you? Why the act?"
"Well, well, well, look what we have here."
"Are you sure, Harry?" Hermione asks carefully.
"So" Draco lifts and eye, and now Harry's lips twist fully into a wry smile.
Draco rolls his eyes and groans, pulling away. “Of course you’re going to be a bloody Gryffindor on me. You listen to me, Potter,” Draco leans in, his scent nearly overwhelming Harry, making him want to melt into the other man. “The only think I’m going to regret tomorrow is if I don’t get to taste your delectable mouth, tonight.”
"Well, I haven't been entirely absent. I've been in the Quibbler a few times recently." Harry laughs at Draco, ignoring his gentle jibe.
Two hours later and significantly less sober, the four of them have all relaxed into each other. The trio was happily surprised to find that with age and a lack of dark lords and family looming over his head, Draco had quite the wry sense of humour. He had them in fits of laughter through the whole night, and now, with liquor loosening her up, Hermione is wiping away the tears streaming down her face.
Draco sputters. "No, of course n- I like to stay informed and I couldn't help but see your fat head, staring out from the front page like it was so often! Any observant person would notice the Golden Boy's sudden absence from the news."
"I'm sorry, I - I'm just really embarrassed." His face flushes and he looks away. "It's ridiculous that they brought me here at all. I suppose I'm still resisting the help I'm here to receive."
Harry sighs. "No act, I swear. It's just...I've seen the papers." Draco's face shutters, going dark and stand-offish. Harry hurries to continue. "No, no... it's just. I'm sure you saw the papers four years ago. I just...I thought you could use someone who understood what you’re going through." Harry shoves his hands into the pockets of his trousers and looks down at the ground, unable to look into his face.
"Well, no, I suppose that's all true. But perhaps it isn't a bad thing. I know it's horrible now, trust me, I know it is. But - but maybe it's a gift. The worst of it is over - the truth is out there. You don't have to hide that part of yourself any more. You don't have to live in a loveless marriage and pretend to be someone you're not. You can pursue what you really want."
A shout at the bar behind him draws him out of the spell Draco has him under and suddenly he jolts, eyes darting around and then back to Draco, who is staring at him hungrily. On the way, his eyes snag on the number of empty martini glasses on the table in front of them.
"Wow." Draco whispers, and Harry looks up startled, right into Draco's wide green eyes, which are much closer than he had expected. Draco's body is entirely turned to face him now, as if he'd been enthralled in what Harry was saying, and Harry isn't sure exactly when his arm had come to rest on the top of the booth behind him. Harry had the distinct feeling of being penned in – and, unfortunately, was not disliking the notion.
Harry takes a moment to digest this information, his sympathy shining on his face. He's probably lucky that Draco hadn't looked back at him - he's sure that the blond wouldn't appreciate that sentiment written all over his face.
Draco Malfoy, however, was a new presence, one that Harry had not expected. Though, with his recent popularity in the slander columns of the Daily Prophet, Harry supposes he shouldn't be surprised that the blond had found reprieve here too.
Hermione swishes into the hospital room, her robes swirling around her as she comes to a halt next to Ron. "The healer will be with us in just a moment."
Harry winces at this, his face drawn. Malfoy frowns and says "No worries Potter, it's not as bad as it sounds."
"Old friend, huh?"
Hermione clears her throat very loudly all of a sudden, and Draco and Harry's heads swing in her direction. Harry flushes a bit again, realizing he'd completely ignored the presence of his friends. She smiles brightly, shoving at Ron's side. "Terribly sorry, but it's getting late and Ron and I really have to go home."
Harry’s heart thuds, and he tries to slow the rushing of blood at the tone of Draco’s voice, the flirtation that he might not have even noticed in his words. Still, he can’t help but notice the way Draco’s eyes track the motion of his tongue as he wets his lips, and his voice is breathy when he answers.
Draco and Harry stare after them in shock for a moment, not quite sure what had just happened.
"I see your observational skills haven't improved with age, Potter." He says, before coming over to have a look at his arm. Harry instinctively pulls back for a moment, before reminding himself that it's been ten years, he'd long ago forgiven Malfoy and moved beyond childhood rivalries, and Malfoy had become a certified Healer. A rather skilled one, if the rumours were to be believed. (Harry would be the judge of that, having learned that most rumours were, in fact, not to be believed at all).
The bar lighting is so dim that at first Harry doesn't even notice him, sitting alone in the darkest corner of the bar. He sits by himself, hunched over his drink at the bar, his shoulder practically pressed into the wall. It isn't until someone jostles him on the way to the bathroom and Harry hears his voice, just for a second, and looks up in time to see striking blond hair disappearing back underneath his hood that recognition hits.
"Hush, Potter. It seemed easier than saying enemy or rival - that wasn't likely to assure him we were fine."
Draco is leaning on Harry, his arm slung around the shorter man's shoulders. Harry is laughing, his body warm and fluttery surrounded by laughter, dim lights, and Draco's breath, which smells sweet from the green apple martini he'd been drinking. He had decided to stop drinking a while back, when he started to feel his body reacting to the combination of alcohol and Draco's close proximity, but the others had yet to notice, and if he acted a little more drunk than he was to keep it that way, well, who was to know?
Before he knows it, he's standing right behind Malfoy's barstool, and it strikes him that he has no idea how to start this. He hasn't talked to the bloke in almost ten years. Malfoy had worked in the Ministry for much of the same time that Harry had, but they'd never worked in the same circles, never run into each other. They'd made eye contact across rooms, when they were both made to attend the same functions, but had never actually talked to each other. In the early days, it was likely to prevent the possibility of old resentments rising to the surface. Eventually, he figures, it just became habit to avoid each other.
Harry’s eyes fly open to see Draco roll his eyes, and he grins widely. “Malfoy, you’re bloody brilliant! I could kiss you – if that weren’t the whole point of this conversation. I’ve got some at my flat – if you want to come with me?” Harry bites his lip, hoping this isn’t too forward, and Draco rolls his eyes again.
"I don't want anything from you. I just saw you sitting here and came to say hello. And maybe... maybe ask if you'd like to come sit with us?"
Draco is silent for so long that Harry is about to turn and walk about, when he notices movement and looks up in surprise to see Draco standing and grabbing his drink. For a second Harry's afraid the drink is about to be thrown in his face, but Draco lifts and eyebrow and motions towards the booth. "Lead the way, O Savior."
"Well, for one, yes, those news articles were my way of coming out, my lack of statement a statement in and of itself. Secondly, we didn't break up because of that; we had actually already broken up because we'd realized we were better off as friends, then we both had our sexual awakening and pretended to date for a while longer. But then Ginny and Luna decided they wanted to make a go of things, so we broke up. I took the brunt of it so that they wouldn't have to start their relationship dealing with all of that. They both moved to Wales soon after to avoid any more fallout. Forgive me for the fact that my coming out wasn't as clear and flashy as having pictures of myself with my lover in the act splashed across the front page, while having a wife at home waiting for me."
They didn't get far however, before they ran right into Snape. Hatred boiled inside Harry, while McGonagall calmly faced the new headmaster. Draco squeezed Harry's arm in warning and mouthed: “Let her handle him.”
Draco saw Remus shaking his head in dismay, but had no chance to worry about that now. They needed to get out of here. The spectacle Sirius was making was sure to draw attention very quickly. And if they were caught... he didn't even want to imagine it. Harry, ever the stupid Gryffindor, quickly followed his godfather's lead. He conjured his own Patronus and yelled.
The Gryffindor sighed and sipped his hot chocolate. The feeling of anxiousness had passed, now that he was close to Malfoy. But he had no idea how much time he would have to spend around the git. After simply sitting there for what felt like hours, he finally asked Dobby to bring him his school bag, so he could at least do something productive and get started on his Charms essay.
He led them along the narrow lane, past several cottages and towards the centre of the village, but stopped suddenly to stare at something. Draco was worried for a second, until he realized what had caught his attention. What had looked like a war memorial from afar had suddenly transformed into a statue. A statue of a man with messy hair and glasses next to a woman with long hair, holding a baby. Harry stepped closer, staring transfixed at the image of his parents. Sirius kept his eyes trained on him. It seemed as if looking at the faces of the Potters was just too painful for him.
“Okay. Tell me what...”
“I'm only saying you should take the threat he poses a little more seriously. Be careful and watch your back. We all know he won't attack you openly, but he might try to stage a little accident or something.” Zabini reasoned.
And wait, stop, rewind... Had she just said blokes? Malfoy was into blokes? Harry found himself listening with rapt attention.
“Good. Take him along then.” Sirius agreed. “Show him how to find and destroy those bloody things. But remember that he's only sixteen. He's still a kid. You can't expect him to fight Voldemort on his own, just because of some stupid prophecy.”
“Yes, yes I did. Can you apparate us out of here? All of us?”
Ron grudgingly backed down and Draco hurried to follow Snape, who was marching towards the dungeons in quick strides. He ushered the blond into his office and shut the door behind them. Draco shuddered when his head of house shot a drying charm at him without warning. Great, now he'd have to dash into his room and fix his hair, before he could get to his next class. Which had most likely already started.
“But not by you!”
His yell made all of them jump. The answering crack even more so. Mipsy stared at her former master with large, questioning eyes.
A slight hesitation. And then...
Their next stop was Spintwitches Sporting Needs, where they looked at various Quidditch supplies, until Luna got bored. Harry finally bought the newest Chudley Cannons fan shirt for Weasley. The blond shuddered at the garish colour, but wisely kept his mouth shut.
A small smile played over Potter's lips. He buried deeper under the covers and closed his eyes. “I like that we're friends now.” he whispered.
Suddenly her voice was drowned out by the strange ringing in his ears. Her mouth snapped shut and she stared at him in shock. Only then did Harry realize that it was happening again. His magic was rising around him in waves, ready to lash out. He fought for control, tried to push it back down, but his powers wouldn't respond. His breath was coming in short, painful gasps. Panic was overwhelming him as he realized that he would hurt Ron and Hermione if he didn't get away from them right now.
Harry snorted. Too much pressure, yeah. If Draco was here, he'd surely remind him that Dumbledore was the one putting pressure on Harry. And the Gryffindor was starting to believe that his boyfriend had a point.
So, this is the last chapter. Once again a big thank you to everyone who left a comment. I hope you'll like the ending.
“I do trust you.” Draco mumbled, finally finding his voice again.
"Nothing, I swear!"
He finally rushed back to the castle and cursed Urquhart as he ran up the stairs. Harry had shown him quite a few short cuts and hidden passageways during the last couple of months, but he should have been at the room of requirement 20 minutes ago. Hopefully the younger boy wouldn't be too upset with him. He knew what Quidditch practices were like after all.
Once the other players were out of sight, he quickly slipped through the door. The room was humid and full of steam from the showers. Harry looked around until he spied his boyfriend. Draco was just lacing his shoes and hadn't put on his shirt yet. The dark-haired boy found himself staring at his pale back. Despite the fact that they had shared a bed every night during Christmas holidays and even fooled around a bit, he'd only seen his boyfriend shirtless a few times.
“You think Draco did that?”
Draco slowly lowered the letter, blinking a few times.
“Well, we met at my aunt’s and …”
“That's all I am to you, huh? Just a shag. Merlin, I've been such a fool!”
“What the fuck are you doing out in the garden? It’s barely two in the morning!”
“What are you already doing up?” he wondered. Daphne and her girlfriend were usually among the last to arrive.
Sorry to have kept you guys waiting again. But I was faster than last time. So that's progress I guess. I hope you like the new chapter. There's at least a bit more action and I tried not to copy too much from the book.
Ron answered the question with a rude hand gesture, that had Hermione tutting at him and the blond sniggering. Nott had never been overly creative. They talked some more and bought some food from the lunch trolley, when it finally showed up.
“How bad is it?” Malfoy wanted to know.
“How about... spending the night with you?” Malfoy finally asked.
“Thank you, master Harry.” Kreacher said politely, before disapparating.
Draco sighed. “Yes, I’m fine. I guess it was bad. I can’t really remember it. But I’m fine.”
“But…”
“What does Nott make you do?”
Draco nodded. “Sirius and Remus both offered to watch you, but I told them to get some sleep instead. I wanted to be there when you woke up.”
“Nah, not really. Don’t worry, prongslet.” Sirius assured.
Rounding a corner they saw an open door in front of them, but when they tried to get through, they suddenly found their way blocked by Wormtail.
“More than a bit, if you ask me.” Draco grumbled.
“That you're with Hagrid.” Ron took over. “So we shrugged it off. Only you weren't at dinner...”
“Don’t worry, Draco. I’m fine.”
“Alas, I also. Shall we go then?”
And when he'd gone to investigate he'd found Potter, in the middle of a panic attack and unable to control his wild magic. It hadn't been a conscious decision to approach the other boy. Draco hadn't paused to think about what he was doing. He'd seen the look of panic and utter fear on Potter's face and just reacted.
"Come on, Draco. Your hair looks fine." he urged. "The others are already waiting for us. They wanted to sneak into the old Charms classroom to celebrate. Ron said something about raiding the kitchens."
“It's somewhere here!” Harry yelled. The blond nodded and disappeared. Harry started looking around wildly.
"I obliviated him and left him on a country road somewhere in Devon. Don't worry, he won't find his way back here."
“There it is! Accio cup!”
He slept restlessly, plagued by nightmares about Dumbledore's death and the remaining Horcruxes. He knew what he had to do, but for the moment he tried to push those thoughts aside. The locket was hidden away at the bottom of his trunk. He couldn't bear to look at it. Couldn't bear to be reminded of that night. The others only knew that they'd been to late and that the Horcrux had already been gone, stolen by some unknown person. He had only told Draco of the locket and even the Slytherin hadn't seen it yet.
The elves were more than happy to provide him with sandwiches, assorted fruits, a flask of pumpkin juice, some chocolate cake and treacle tart (Harry's favourite). He put a thick blanket on top of the picnic basket and then went outside to wait for Harry, who was in Herbology right now.
Harry traced the graffiti with his finger. Suddenly he was grinning. “This is brilliant!” he gushed.
The Slytherin bristled at the fact that she was talking about him like he wasn't even there. But he didn't want to aggravate her, only minutes after she'd accepted his apology, so he forced himself to stay calm.
Draco dragged his heavy trunk through the train, scowling at the kids who stopped to stare at him. Some were whispering amongst themselves, others even pointed their fingers at him. The older ones made it very clear that he wasn't welcome to join them in their compartments, while the younger ones looked scared, as if they thought he would attack them any second.
“Why so down? You won, in case you didn't notice.”
Ah, the infamous biography the Daily Prophet kept speculating about. According to the rumours, Skeeter had unearthed some very shocking things. Draco sighed.
“Right. I almost forgot about that. I ducked and then Ron got him with the spell.”
Harry rolled his eyes. Stubborn bastard. Why couldn't he give in already? Harry just wanted to know his name. Just wanted to be sure he was really who Harry thought he was. With an impatient sigh he grabbed his quill.
“They're Death Eaters. They teach here, but they're also in charge of the discipline. At least they were before Christmas break. You know that I never returned after the holidays.”
"Hmm.. I wouldn't give it too much thought. It's probably just your subconscious, trying to come to terms with the bond." Remus reasoned.
It was a very tempting offer. Draco could almost see the headline. >Death Eater's son speaks up at last – the ugly truth about Lucius Malfoy.< But he knew that he would never do it. He wasn't as brave as Harry. “I don't think interviews are really my thing.” he declined. Who would believe him anyway? His father had connections at the Ministry. And he was nobody.
Instead of heeding the quiet command, Harry slowly moved closer. He couldn't tell why, but for some reason he was sure that the blond wouldn't attack him.
“Lavender was worried you might listen to your parents and leave her.” Harry let Daphne know. Hermione hadn’t even noticed that he’d rejoined Malfoy on the bed.
“Gives light only to the beholder.” he whispered, wondering what the hell the other boy was doing with that thing. And then everything happened really fast.
“We’ll manage. Let him take you to safety. Tell Ron’s brother what happened. He’s going to help you.”
“Petrificus totalis!”
He also noticed that while his popularity among his own house increased slightly, it seemed to be the opposite for Potter. In the first couple of days the Gryffindors had been crowded around him, while he sat in the centre. Now he had moved to the end of the table and sat a little apart from the others. People weren’t openly avoiding him, but they were certainly giving him space.
So the six of them dressed in warm clothes, cast a few charms for additional protection from the weather and made their way out into the cold. The walk down to Hogsmeade dragged on endlessly. Draco felt cold despite several warming charms and kept complaining loudly, but Daphne and Lavender were relentless.
“Hey guys. Why don't we go for a walk?” he suggested. He had no idea how this conversation would go and if it went bad he didn't want to accidentally destroy Andromeda's living room. Ron and Hermione exchanged a worried glance and agreed.
“I'm just... hungry.” the younger boy claimed not very convincingly.
“Let's hope we don't have to.” Millie muttered and started pacing. Neville fell into step beside her, so Draco walked in the opposite direction.
Hermione screamed again. So did Ron. And Draco had a sudden moment of clarity. “Kreacher!”
“I'm meeting Draco in the library. See you at dinner, okay?”
The werewolf shook his head with a rueful smile. Just like old times. He caught his boyfriend's eyes and they smiled at each other, brought back to their Marauder days, if only for a moment.
“We can do Diss-lusion Charms now.” Goyle said proudly just then, proving Draco right.
Remus hesitated only briefly. “Yes, I suppose we should. I mean, Dumbledore never questioned Snape’s loyalty. This would at least explain why.”
"An Erumpent Horn!"
“Yes, you're right. And it sounded like it's got something to do with you and … Voldemort.”
This time they all agreed that it would be better to split up. Two or three people were less likely to arouse suspicion than six. It also meant they could cover all three places in one day. The orphanage had been demolished many years before and replaced with a towerblock of offices. Remus and Sirius still decided to check it out, before moving on to Merope Gaunt’s grave, which was close by.
“But I'm not. Never were. Though I have to say you're displaying surprisingly Slytherin traits lately.”
Over the course of the week Draco watched his friend closely. Harry acted like always and gave no hint that he remembered the phone sex. But the blond thought he noticed Harry staring at him from time to time. He noticed how Harry’s eyes seemed to follow him and how he suddenly found excuses to touch him. Just casual touches, like a pat on the back, a hand on his shoulder or a friendly punch to the arm.
“Why not?”
After unwrapping their presents, Harry and Draco got dressed and then went downstairs to join Ron, Remus, Sirius and Mr. Weasley for a late breakfast. Then Ron and Draco spent some time playing wizards chess, while Harry watched. After some persuasion he managed to talk Draco into wearing his new Weasley jumper to lunch, assuring him that pretty much everyone would be wearing them and Mrs. Weasley would be happy.
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
“Why not? We need it to destroy the horcruxes. And it has already come to Harry once.”
“It must be. Your brother stole it and then he hid it at Grimmauld Place.”
That sounded a lot better.
"That is none of my concern. Any other questions or are we done now?"
“Daphne? Pretty much the same thing Brown wanted when she talked to you, I guess. She said she’s hoping we’d become friends.”
“And…?” Malfoy prodded.
“Because like I said, getting worked up won't change anything. And it's not like they don't have enough reason to hate me.”
“Yelling at you? Saying stupid things? Being an arse in general?”
"I'm not getting out of this one." Malfoy muttered sleepily. "Not unless Potter comes to save me again. And why should he?"
“I'm a wonderful room-mate.” he claimed in his best haughty voice.
“At first I wasn't sure what to do with the two of you.” McGonagall admitted. “But I saw the pictures in the Prophet and I want to believe that you've outgrown your childish rivalry. Don't prove me wrong.”
Harry stared at the cup in surprise. “Is that...?”
“The first time I saw Harry after my trial was at Andromeda’s house. He was having a panic attack and his magic … got out of control. It was … sort of pulsing around him in great dark waves.”
“I’m so glad to see you!” she cried, only letting go of him to hug Harry.
“Yes, you are.” Remus agreed. “But that doesn’t mean you have to die. There’s got to be another way.”
His words were followed by an uproar from the assembled kids, who insisted that they didn’t want to be evacuated. They wanted to stay and fight.
“So you've said.” Sirius answered, adjusting his glasses.
Which was probably an understatement, if the look on Remus’ face was anything to go by. But they had no time to discuss that now. They needed to get a move on. If Dumbledore’s brother really was part of the Order, his pub was probably their best bet. Maybe he would even be able to tell them the best way to get into Hogwarts undetected.
“From the tales of Beedle the Bard?” Draco cut in.
They waded to shore and flopped down onto slippery grass. Across from them the dragon had drank its fill and launched itself into the sky again. Harry watched it flying away with a small smile. After catching his breath for a moment, he got up and started placing the usual, protective spells around them.
Harry finally reached the entrance of Gryffindor tower.
“Did he say anything else?” Draco prodded, trying to ignore how cute the other boy looked when he was pouting.
“Okay. How about Tomes and Scrolls?” Draco suggested, ignoring her last comment. “I thought I could get some books with baking recipes for mother.”
"Oh... do you need to... Wait a second."
"I'm not hungry." Harry protested weakly.
“I see. Do I need to worry about you stealing my girlfriend, Harry?”
“Maybe.”
“Are you... okay with that?” the younger boy asked hesitantly.
“I was just having a chat with Harry.”
Okay. He was technically married to Malfoy now, just because he had touched a book. Sure. Why not.
The younger boy crawled into the bed. “I wasn't sure, but... we talked about spending the night together, so...”
“Harry?”
“Draco, you need to come! It’s Harry…”
Draco shivered when Potter suddenly reached out, trailing his fingers over the faded mark. No-one had ever dared to touch it before. People shied away from just looking at it. Even his own mother. But Potter seemed to have no such reservations. He was stroking the abused skin almost tenderly.
And it did. Maybe they could learn to like the blond as well, if they got to know him a little better. He could always hope, right?
“So am I.”
“Well Luna is a lot cleverer than most people give her credit for. She's weird, yes, but really good at seeing through people. Just like Hermione. I was more shocked that Ron noticed. He's so clueless usually.”
"It was him."
"What happened? Was it that book you were sent? McGonagall wouldn't allow anyone to touch it. We thought it might've been cursed." Hermione again and Harry was only surprised that she hadn't started berating him yet for touching the bloody thing.
“You’ve changed,” the hat whispered inside his ear. He knew nobody else could hear the hat, but his knuckles turned white at the edge of the stool he gripped. “Everything except what you always wanted. And you know it too.”
“Your whole family are Dark Wizards! Dad told me ‘bout you lot, and your father—”
Ron Weasley.
chapters will also get longer shortly!
He ended up paying for that on his own for five years. He watched Potter grow up. He watched from the sidelines, scared for the kid's life, intensely fascinated by the one who turned him down on the staircase. Potter would always look at him too. After the first year apart, he would raise his eyebrow at Draco, challenging him to join their table. Draco learned to stop looking at Potter after that. At least, looking at him when he would notice.
The only thing he remembers next is the shocked roar of the crowd when Harry Potter was resorted into Ravenclaw and slid onto the bench next to him.
Draco looked up and his eyes somehow seemed to immediately slide to Potter’s, just like it always did. Potter was the only one in the crowd who didn’t seem surprised that Draco was still sitting there.
A couple of them did, they would let Harry sit in their classrooms to eat his lunches to avoid the attack of the other students he usually endured. Harry liked those teachers. Mostly though, his teachers avoided him. His report cards were graded back with things like an inability to focus, distracting to other students, slow to learning, and despite how negatively it was received by the others, an over talkative trait of his.
Malfoy broke away and detached Harry's hand from his tie, albeit not ungently. He sat back in his chair and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, eyes locked with Harry's. For some reason, the gesture was curiously erotic.
. "Gingerbread!"
Harry knocked politely on the door, even though he could probably have simply walked in. They waited only a few moments before the portal was flung open to disclose Draco's handsome visage. He looked as cool and beautiful as a portrait and a smile curved his perfect lips when his eyes met Harry's. It wasn't until that moment that Harry realized just how difficult the past few days had been. He wanted to leap on Draco like a crazed animal and kiss him until neither of them could breathe.
He screamed into Draco's mouth as he arched violently and hot fluid spilled between them. The feel of Harry's spasms triggered Draco's release and his hands tightened on Harry's body as a thousand shards of euphoria exploded through him. He pounded into Harry until the last tremour ceased, and then he collapsed on Harry's chest, heaving with exertion.
Eddie's wand!" Harry yelled. It flew into his hand and he set about freeing him from his bonds. He forced himself to move methodically. The spells binding Eddie were tricky, and then he had to sever the ropes, all whilst not removing his hand from Eddie's thigh. It was difficult work manoeuvring Eddie's wand. Casting was sluggish and each spell seemed delayed, as though the wand was reluctant to function for him. When the last bond fell away, Harry Apparated them straight to St Mungo's. Covered in blood, as they both were, their arrival caused an immediate stir. The healers rushed Eddie away, down a long hallway and into a closed room.
Draco considered resisting, but given Weasley's tense stance, he was hoping for such an eventuality. He probably couldn't wait to pry Draco's jaws open by force. With a single roll of his eyes, Draco tipped his head back and opened his mouth. The Veritaserum tasted vile. He didn't even need to swallow it for it to be effective; within moments he could feel the potion numbing his tongue and stealing warm fingers into his brain.
"Not quite yet." Harry's hands slid over Draco's hipbones and then teased close to his throbbing cock, yet never touched it. His palms swirled over Draco's abdomen and then he bent down to dip his tongue into Draco's navel, causing him to gasp aloud—not because of the lick, but because a wisp of Harry's soft hair brushed the head of his cock in a tantalizing, diminutive contact that made it ache for more.
After wandering aimlessly about the building for close to a half hour, Harry finally spotted a glint of blond hair in the Atrium, heading towards the lift. Harry bolted and slid into the box just as the doors were closing.
Harry swept all of the photos and clippings together and stuffed them back into the false book. He replaced it on the shelf and then stared at it for long minutes. No answers came to him, so he killed the lights in the flat and went to bed.
"Upstairs, locking every room that doesn't need to be open. Perhaps it would be best if you helped him."
"This will enclose a three meter circle."
Harry stopped nibbling on Malfoy's lip and turned at the sound of Ron's voice. He smiled at Ron's shell-shocked expression.
"You can sleep on the plane," Harry said and managed to keep the taunt from his voice—barely. He knew there was slim chance of Draco sleeping even if he did manage to wrestle him onto an airplane. He would have to put Draco by a window and hope to hell no Muggles got too close to him. It would be hard to explain Draco recoiling in revulsion every time anyone got near, although there was probably a Muggle mental illness that would justify it.
For a foppish snob, Quartermain was handy with a wand. He deflected Zabini's hex with ease and even managed an odd flourish as he sent one in return, before leaping aside to avoid Parkinson's angry red bolt. He reminded Harry of Severus Snape, especially when a sneer twisted his patrician features.
"The arrogant ones always have shite wards. They think their own egos will protect them."
Harry checked his appearance for the fifteenth time and tried to tuck a wayward hair into place again. It slipped right back over his ear and he gnashed his teeth.
"Not really. Theo was in town and that's rare enough now that we tend to go out whenever he shows up. Astoria insisted on tagging along and she carries quite an annoying torch for me. I have to prove to her time and again that I am unrelentingly gay."
"Are we going to argue all day, or are you going to try and teach me?" The sneer was back, as if their moment of camaraderie earlier had never happened.
at it until Potter was a sobbing mess, but he also knew he might never have another chance to do what he
"Of course. Kneazles and krups."
Harry drew in a harsh breath and felt a huge rush of sympathy. He was familiar with horrible birthdays and was suddenly angry at the Minister of Magic for forcing this duty on Malfoy tonight of all nights.
, Harry thought sourly. The bloody bastard would be gorgeous even if he were covered in tar and feathers.
"Can I-- May I go outside, Uncle Harry?"
"Then how did you find out it was her?"
"That she did, and I'm not suggesting she isn't extraordinarily intelligent and competent. But no one ever wondered what happened to Steadham? The man was in the prime of his life."
"Curious," Draco said, although he had a sneaking suspicion where Carmichael might have got off to. "Thanks, Finnigan. And don't forget Ulyanovsk."
Oh God, he was alive, but only just. Harry immediately cast out for all the magic at his disposal. He had got even better at it over the past few months, using the technique to dispel the rampant pockets of dark magic left over from Voldemort's reign. He had thrown himself into the task, trying to carry on without Draco—something he refused to do again. Harry was weak, though, incredibly weak. He slowly drew the magic from everything around him—excluding Draco. Thank goodness he had learned that little trick, or the drain would have killed Draco for certain.
Hermione looked as surprised as Harry felt. "You can't! We need you."
"Well, yes, we haven't been able to get our hands on an actual dementor to test it, of course. But it works nicely on ghosts, spectres, and a rare Welsh Wraith we were lucky to track down."
Maeve returned with a bottle and two goblets. She poured a glass for Draco and one for herself and then sat back to watch him eat.
"I'm going to find her," Harry murmured and then he pressed against Draco's back for a moment and was gone.
Ginny and George came to see me today just as I was finishing up the last of my reps with Jacob. Malfoy popped in just as Gin was giving me a farewell hug and all of a sudden the room was full of weird tension. Gin kept glaring at Malfoy and George was twirling his wand as though itching to hex Malfoy. Jacob, thank Merlin, dragged Malfoy out of there until Ginny and George left. I need to have a talk with the Weasleys and let them know that Malfoy's okay now. Ron knows, but I supposed we never really mentioned it to the others. My mistake.
Forty minutes later, the door finally opened. They all got to their feet in a rush as a single green-robed healer walked towards them. Her face was severe, although she looked vaguely like Molly Weasley, except that her hair was steel-grey rather than ginger.
Draco frowned. "You're taking this Savior of the Wizarding World thing far too seriously, Potter. You've done your part. Let someone else have a turn."
He lifted a brow at the bird, which cocked his head in that endearing manner and cooed. Draco suppressed a grin and got to his feet.
The potion had been effective, and he'd filed it away for reference. If he lived, he hoped to petition the Ministry to add half the ingredients in the elixer to the Banned Substances list. In his opinion, it was worse than the Cruciatus Curse itself. The feel of his trouser fabric against his skin was extremely painful; the air itself held various levels of hurt, and the multitude of Cruciatus Curses that Crabbe had thrown at him had nearly broken him ten times over. He'd suppressed every scream of agony with difficulty and might have cracked and spilled anything and everything that Crabbe wanted, except for one thing. Harry Potter. As bizarre as it seemed, the thought of Harry alone kept Draco from breaking.
"Yes," Potter said simply and reached for his wand again. He reared back and mumbled a spell that squirted a handful of pale gel into his hand. It smelled lovely, with a scent Draco couldn't concentrate enough to put a name to. Potter lathered up his cock and Draco helped, using both hands and bumping them over Potter's before reaching up to smear a stripe over Potter's mouth, earning a wrinkled nose and a growled chuckle. Potter touched a dab to Draco's nose in retaliation and then they were wrestling in earnest, smearing lube everywhere and rolling on the bed, laughing, and smacking each other with slick handprints. The bedcovers were a wreck.
“Very well. I elect Potter as our new Team Captain,” Malfoy said loudly.
"Mission accomplished. Well done."
Harry sat down next to Malfoy. The block was small, forcing him to sit close to Malfoy to avoid falling off the edge. His hip and thigh rested against Malfoy's and he felt the wetness from Malfoy's clothing seep through his robes. Harry leaned back slightly so their shoulders were barely touching and braced his hand on the block behind Malfoy's back. As an afterthought, he pulled out his wand and enlarged his magical umbrella to cover them both.
Harry's mouth left his and he raised himself on one arm. Draco loved to watch his face when it screwed up in concentration—his green eyes were tightly shut and his brow was creased. Harry's lips were slightly parted and Draco tried not to move as Harry pushed into him, but he couldn't stop the guttural sound that rumbled in his throat, nor the gasp when Harry thrust forward. Harry's green eyes snapped open with a trace of concern.
She nodded. "I understand. Draco seldom talks about his work." She looked away and arranged the flowers in her basket, looking as if she regretted bringing up the subject. "Never mind. He is not a child any longer. Thank you, Mr Potter."
◊◊◊◊◊◊
Draco gave him a bemused look. "Pansy's house is nice."
Malfoy's eyes opened and fixed on Harry, who felt a ridiculous sense of happiness when Malfoy smiled. "I would like. And thank you."
At one point their hands caught and held; they stopped moving simultaneously and leaned into a gentle, shared kiss, broken with panted breaths that only made them pause before resuming. Something about it had Draco's heart aching. Never before had he experienced such strange tenderness during sex. Whatever doubts he had regarding Potter's feelings vanished. Be he Mark or
"You were such a prat the next day!" Harry said and mourned the loss when Draco's hand fell away.
"We'll bring him back," Harry promised. He took the makeshift map and then stepped closer to Cho.
Judging by the unpleasant and cold sensation against his back, he lay on some sort of weathered stone. Unclothed. He shifted slightly. Mostly unclothed. The vengeful bitch had at least left him his boxers. He snorted. Like that was comforting. He craned his head and found that he was sprawled on a flat boulder at the edge of a small clearing. He seemed to be alone.
"I'm not cold," Malfoy said, but he took the flask and tipped it to his lips, taking a large swig of the brandy. He handed it back and Harry took a drink. The rim was wet where Malfoy's lips had touched it. The alcohol burned its way down Harry's throat and settled into warm coals in his belly.
Rosier shrugged and, using his wand hand, he ripped the tape away in one swift movement. Eddie screamed again and then his loud gasps filled the room. A corner of his lip bled, probably torn by the tape. "Harry," he whispered.
Harry thought the alcohol had departed his system when he'd changed, but perhaps not, since he impulsively took wing and landed lightly upon Draco's forearm. Draco wore no protective leather, so Harry was careful not to dig his talons in, although he had to flap his wings a bit to keep his balance.
"Very good, Potter.  Now, then, only one more detail."  Malfoy reached into a trouser pocket and produced a Slytherin tie.  Harry looked at it blankly until Malfoy looped it around his wrist and then bound it to the back of the chair.
"We… might want to go…" Harry suggested when his astonishment lessened.
Terror drove him up onto his knees and he rolled Draco over with trembling hands. He pressed both to Draco's neck, begging for a sign of life. A weak tremour of a heartbeat met his searching fingers.
"Shit. So Crabbe's still got him, then?"
"Pay no mind to Copernicus, there. He hasn't left this room in four years. He's so obsessed with studying the variations of the Crab Nebula that he's completely forgotten the outside world. His wife left him a year ago; I believe she's filed for divorce in-absentia. He probably doesn't recall that he ever married."
Harry went home and half of his mind was occupied with his meeting with Malfoy. He hadn't lied. Although it still set up warning bells in his psyche, he was beginning to trust Malfoy. Something about him just seemed sincere.
"Do you really think my idea would work?" There was caution in Malfoy's tone, as though he expected Harry's support to be nothing more than an elaborate trap. Harry felt a pang when he realized he had contributed to Malfoy's lack of trust in his own department.
"Hardly
"What do you know of love and broken hearts, you spiteful, jealous, horrible beast of a donkey!"
Bill had gone to Latvia to dig for some sort of goblin treasure, and Ginny was off starting the new Quidditch season with her latest boyfriend, the coach of the Tutshill Tornadoes.
"Goodbye, Harry. Good luck," she said with a wry grin. She popped the chip into her mouth and opened her book, dismissing him before he even made it out of the café.
other things.
Draco nodded. "And more tea. I'll go and prepare some."
"She came to visit me under the guise of Polyjuice. She was careful—very careful—but I knew it was her."
“Good. She’s sleeping now, but I thought she’d like a cup of tea and something to eat when she wakes up.”
“I wouldn’t have managed that without your help.” Harry pointed out.
"It doesn't help Ron if you starve yourself." the Slytherin pointed out, flinching slightly when the words brought back memories of what Harry had told him about his childhood. But the younger boy didn't seem to care right now. He was staring mutely ahead.
“I believe they already arrived in Australia by now. Yes.”
"And you and Malfoy?"
"All right there, mate?" the red-head asked around a mouthful of food.
“Good. I'm glad we got that sorted.” Harry admitted, relieved to have gotten this talk over with. And happy that they were on the same page. “Shit, I totally forgot. Remus sent me to fetch you for tea.” he suddenly remembered. He'd completely forgotten about that.
“Don't stop.”
“Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry?” Draco chimed in. Because that made absolutely no sense.
When Harry arrived at the room of requirement a while later, there was already a door visible, standing slightly ajar. He cautiously pushed it open further and glanced inside to find the room from yesterday's lunch break. Draco was once again sitting in front of the fireplace. He looked up hopefully when Harry entered.
His warning delivered he turned on his heel and marched off. His good mood had evaporated and his heart sank even further when he entered his room to find Harry waiting for him with a wounded expression.
“Yes, I guess it is.”
“Okay?”
"What I want? You heard what McGonagall said. We're supposed to spend time together." Harry snapped back.
“What he did was really brave.” Harry said softly.
Draco took out his wand, grabbed Harry’s hand and apparated. Seconds later they were standing in the hallway of Grimmauld Place, looking around cautiously. At first glance nothing seemed out of place. But suddenly they heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice whispering out of the darkness.
Draco looked around nervously, realizing where they were. Before he could say anything, Harry started pacing in front of the wall. As soon as the door appeared, he pulled the blond into the room, both looking around. The room of requirement had turned into a perfect copy of the Slytherin common room, just like Harry remembered it. He thought that Draco might feel more comfortable in the familiar surroundings.
“I'm fine. Where...”
Aberforth scoffed and turned away.
It probably didn't matter either way, since Draco very obviously didn't want Harry to touch him. That hurt more than he'd liked to admit and the fact that he completely ruined his potion, since his thoughts were too occupied with the infuriating blond next to him, didn't exactly do much for his dark mood either.
"You're not the only one." Harry agreed with a heartfelt sigh.
“Yes. I can handle it.”
Luckily he didn't have to wait long. The blond stormed into the kitchen only a few minutes later, relaxing visibly when he spied Harry. "You felt it, too?" the younger boy asked.
“That’s a tough question, Harry. Truth be told I haven’t thought of him much in the last couple of years. We were close as children. I really liked being a big brother. But even back then Regulus was the good son and I was the black sheep. And once I went to Hogwarts and got sorted into Gryffindor, our relationship became strained. We mostly ignored each other in school. Then I ran away and after I had graduated I never saw him again. I only heard from others that he’d joined the Death Eaters.”
“Sounded to me like Dumbledore thinks differently.” the blond mused.
"My dad and his friends made that in their time at Hogwarts. It can be pretty useful." He smiled when the blond's eyes widened.
“How... how did you even get here, Luna?” Hermione wanted to know.
“I don’t know exactly. They said they were going to get something to destroy the horcrux with and took off.”
“Who were you yelling at?” he asked after a while.
“I'm going to the library.” Hermione announced suddenly.
“Madame had asked for Gemino and Flagrate curses to be placed on her vault.” the goblin let them know, giving her a suspicious look.
“Probably better that way. You'd have made a horrible Slytherin.”
“I feel really close to you.” Draco said softly. “I mean, I already did before. I think I’ve never trusted anyone as much as I trust you. My whole life I’ve always tried to keep people away. I built walls around myself, so I wouldn’t get hurt. But you broke down these walls. You saw me for who I am.”
“No, it's okay. But thanks.”
Draco was the first to speak: "It was never an act."
Another Horcrux gone. Harry felt elated.
“Did you see the Prophet?” the blond asked. “One would think they'd come up with something a little more creative than 'Harry Potter seen shopping with former Death Eater'.”
“Getting cold feet?” Sirius asked with a grin, clapping a hand on his shoulder.
“Your mother is an extremely intelligent woman. She will make sure that she isn’t caught helping us.” Remus said softly, as if reading his thoughts.
Andromeda, looking splendid in dark blue. Next to her sat Tonks, with her husband Eoghan and their three-months-old son Teddy. Remus, sitting in the front row and looking clearly uncomfortable in the new dress robes Narcissa had forced on him. Of course Neville and Millicent were there as well. And also Dean, Seamus, Terry Boot, Susan Bones, the Patil twins and pretty much everyone else from their year. Even Goyle had shown up. He was sitting next to Luna’s father with a look of utter bewilderment of his face, while a wildly gesturing Xenophilius explained something to him.
The next week brought a welcome surprise for once. The Aurors had encountered four death eaters at Malfoy Manor. And one of them had been Peter Pettigrew. After being questioned by Kingsley Shacklebolt and head Auror Rufus Scrimgeour for the better part of a day, he had finally admitted his part in the deaths of James and Lily Potter and proven Sirius innocence.
“What do you think you're doing, Draco?!” Bellatrix screeched.
The two of them left and Draco turned back to Harry. “So it is the diadem?”
“Hey, I think we're losing height.” Draco's voice shook him from his musings.
“Stop being so damn pessimistic. Harry will be perfectly safe with us. And it shouldn’t even take long.”
During sixth year Draco had gotten quite good at acting like everything was fine, even if it really wasn’t. He was confident that no-one would notice his inner turmoil today either and he was right. He found his usual bunch of first years at the Slytherin table when he came down for breakfast and soon Alice was chattering his ear off, telling him about her upcoming Potions test. Before he really knew it, he’d agreed to help her and Derek to study for the test.
And indeed, as soon as they rounded the corner they could see them, guarding the poor Muggle-borns that sat huddled together on stone benches. Some were alone, others accompanied by their families. A woman looked up and gasped when she saw Ron.
“I hope your offer still stands. Looks like I’m going to have to take you up on it.”
“We need to get there before him.”
“But...”
Andromeda apologised profusely and asked if he would be kind enough to share his room with Harry. They could put a camp bed in, which would undoubtedly make things a bit cramped, but was still the best possible option. She didn’t want the poor boy to sleep on the couch or, even worse, spend Christmas all alone in that dreadful old house he’d inherited from his godfather.
“But Snape killed Dumbledore!” Ron protested. “Or… at least he helped Nott kill Dumbledore.”
Hermione glared at him, which prompted Draco to step in.
They pondered this problem for a couple of days, until a solution presented itself. Draco had been re-packing his rucksack, when he discovered a long blond hair caught in the money bag he'd snatched from his father's desk before their escape. After some persuasion from Harry, he agreed to polyjuice as Lucius. It would still be a gamble, but it was their best bet.
“Not for sure. I had my suspicions for a while now. But Dumbledore wouldn’t confide in me.” he sounded bitter.
“Shit. So all the trouble was for nothing?”
He strode across the hallway and into the kitchen, heading straight for Kreacher’s cupboard and wrenching the door open. There was a nest of dirty old blankets, just like Draco remembered, but they were no longer glittering with trinkets. Sirius grabbed the blankets and shook them. But all that fell out were a dead mouse and an old book.
“Yeah. Even if we don't really get it... Ow, Mione don't hit me! I said I'll try, didn't I?”
“Don’t even try to deny it. Like I said, it’s obvious. And I don’t mind. You’re a cute couple.”
“Only for a moment. I knew he would annoy Ron the most.” she admitted sheepishly.
But she wouldn't be the girl he knew if she'd let something scare her for long. He could practically see how she pulled herself together and started analysing the situation.
“It was bound to come out sooner or later.” Draco answered after a moment. “And I don't care what people think. So yes, I guess I'm okay with it. What about you?”
“You are my son, Draco. I will always love you, no matter what. Your preferences aren't going to change that.” she declared.
“So the boy … the boy must die?” Snape asked after a bout of silence.
Sirius and Remus appeared unaffected. The animagus walked further along the hallway, causing a figure to rise up out of the carpet, tall and dust-coloured and so horribly altered that it was hard to recognize it as Albus Dumbledore. It glided towards them, raising a wasted arm and pointing it at Sirius.
But one look at the Slytherin table quickly proved him wrong. Despite looking pale and tired as ever, Malfoy grinned and even had the audacity to wink at him! Harry promptly inhaled his tea and had a coughing fit. Another look at the Slytherin table showed a snickering blond. Bastard!
Another chapter done. And I'm quite happy with this one. What do you think? Please let me know.
"I'm not taking the risk of losing it."
“It was okay.” he finally answered.
"But you're on their list of Muggle-borns who didn't show up for interrogation. It's too dangerous for you."
“Harry knows where the next one is.” Draco let them know.
“You’re supposed to be supportive, you know? Not make fun of me.”
“About Dumbledore. You said I shouldn’t trust him blindly. That there was something he wasn’t telling me. And you were right.”
“I don't hate you.”
"Harry! Harry! Wake up!"
“Alright. What did you want to talk about?”
The Slytherin was very intelligent. That much was no surprise, since he'd always been top of their classes, alongside Hermione. He had a sharp mind and quickly found all the flaws in the outrageous plans the dark-haired boy thought up. Which was a little annoying, but really for the best. At least he wasn't too vicious about pointing out those flaws and he also didn't insult Harry (too much).
Pansy got the hint and dropped the subject. She told him what he'd missed yesterday and offered to let him borrow her notes.
“Through the tunnel, of course. It leads directly to the Hog's Head. We just apparated into the inn and then walked through the tunnel.” Luna explained calmly. “Though I think Aberforth wasn't too happy to see us.”
“Maybe.”
“It’s a lot more complicated than you think.” Remus said.
“Yes, we did!”
He must have made some sound, because suddenly Nott whirled around, wand in hand and fired a hex at him without warning. Draco managed to duck at the last second.
Ron thought about that for a moment. “I guess you’re right. Although an unbeatable wand would give us an advantage.”
"Good, because I don't either." the blond admitted with a smile. "And now come on. We shouldn't keep Snape waiting."
“Your father choose to … retreat, once the Dark Lord had fallen.” she let him know. “Though I'm sure that the Aurors will catch him in no time. And I doubt that he will manage to escape a sentence in Azkaban this time. Everyone knows of our allegiance with the Dark Lord.”
“Oh please. I was raised with more class.”
He was so preoccupied with the riddle of Dumbledore's odd behaviour, that he nearly forgot about Nott. Therefore he was very surprised when he ducked into a bathroom between classes one day and found the other boy bowed over the sink, in the middle of what looked like a nervous breakdown. His mind flashed back to the Great Hall that morning, where Katie Bell had returned, back in full health but with no recollection of what had happened to her.
“You okay, mate?” the red-head inquired.
“And you can't talk and work at the same time? It's called multi-tasking.”
"Yeah, everyone knows we hate each other. Do you think this is some sort of sick joke or…?" Harry wondered.
"What's your plan then?"
So Draco tried again, with the same result. This was getting very frustrating. He already regretted asking Harry for help.
“Have you snogged him yet?”
“And the healer said your magic reacts to your anger and lashes out.”
Ron rolled his eyes. “No, they don't. Okay, Ginny might. But she's been warned to behave. She threw a total fit when she heard you were coming and mum got really mad. It was nice to have her yelling at Ginny for a change. Because believe it or not, my mum likes you. I have no idea why, but she does. She ordered everyone to be nice to you and no-one would dare and go against my mum's orders. So I'd say you're safe.”
Without another word they sped back to the room of requirement. It was empty now save for three women – Ginny, Tonks and Neville's grandmother, who promptly went to join the fighting. As did Tonks, after inquiring about Remus. Harry sent Ginny out, knowing full well that she wouldn't come back in to hide. She would fight, too. It was her decision, he reasoned with himself.
“It is.” the red-head agreed. “Of course it's a bit of a war zone at the moment, because mum's trying to get Bill to break up with Fleur. She tried to set him up with Tonks, but it didn't work. Small wonder. Who'd take Tonks if he can have Fleur?” he asked rhetorically.
Goyle nodded sadly. “Thanks, Draco.” he muttered. Then he turned around and left the room.
"Master Malfoy is a bad wizard." the elf said bravely. "A very bad wizard. But the young master Draco is not bad. He ordered Dobby to play with him. Hide and seek and other games. And he told Dobby secrets and sometimes he even gave Dobby some of his sweets. But Dobby never told anyone. Master Malfoy would have been very furious."
“Of course not. I'm too beautiful to get fat.” Draco claimed, trying to keep a straight face. He managed to coax another laugh from the other boy, who seemed rather happy not to have to go off on his own just yet.
“You don’t understand, Aberforth. We’ve got to get into the castle. There’s something we need to do.”
“Thank you very much, master.”
Everyone gathered in the kitchen for another discussion. Sirius and Draco told the others what they had learned and they all wondered about the missing sword. Harry had handed the locket over to Hermione by now, so he was acting pretty normal again. He immediately agreed that Dumbledore must have hidden the sword.
“Can we talk? We've got a lot to tell you.” Hermione asked softly.
“I am trying! Do you think I want you to prod around in my mind? Do you think I want you of all people to see my embarrassing childhood memories?” he yelled.
Both boys jumped at a cackling laugh behind them, spinning around to face a dark-haired witch. Alecto Carrow. She laughed at them and pressed her finger to the Dark Mark branded on her forearm. Harry's scar burned anew. He felt Voldemort's vicious triumph at his capture.
"Harry, stop... I'm gonna..."
“You know what? Maybe we should just skip tea.” Harry suggested.
“No-one gets it on the first try. It took me three or four, I think.” Harry said consolingly.
“Don’t mind Derek and Alice. They’re always fighting.” Draco told Harry.
When they finally left the shop, their pockets were bulging with sweets and Ron was in a bad mood because of something Hermione had said. The whole trip was proving to be no fun. They hurried into the Three Broomsticks for a round of butterbeers next. Ron kept staring at Madam Rosmerta, the curvy barmaid, which now put Hermione in a bad mood. As soon as they had drained their bottles, she suggested that they leave. The weather was only getting worse and the frosty atmosphere between her and Ron was further killing the mood, so the others agreed quickly.
“You were asleep. I didn’t think it was important, so I didn’t tell you.” Draco hurried to explain.
“You shouldn’t leave the house at night. Especially not alone.” Remus reprimanded.
She led them to the third floor, where a stone gargoyle was guarding the entrance. It leaped aside once she gave the password and they entered their new common room. It was small, but cosy, with a blazing fireplace, couches and squashy armchairs in earthy browns and rugs, cushions and curtains in a soft rose colour.
When Draco awoke the next morning he felt tired and drained, despite having slept through the night for once, thanks to the dreamless sleep potion Dumbledore had given him. For a moment he contemplated skipping breakfast, afraid of facing the other Slytherins and, more importantly Harry, after everything that had happened. But he knew that he couldn't hide forever. It was probably better to get things over with quickly.
The blond felt his face heating as well and cursed his pale complexion. He wondered what all those onlookers must be thinking and had to mentally remind himself to be careful. No-one could know what was really going on between him and Harry. It was too dangerous. For both of them.
The others nodded and they set off in different directions, going deeper and deeper into the labyrinth.
“Of course you are. You just haven't admitted it yet.”
"So this is the furry menace Blaise keeps complaining about?" she asked.
“That was completely irresponsible. What if Madam Pomfrey doesn't know how to cure her?”
The first one was the orphanage where he’d grown up. Harry thought this was the most unlikely of the three. Voldemort had hated the orphanage. He knew that much from the memories Dumbledore had shown him. He hadn’t even wanted to go back there during summer holidays. Why would he hide a piece of his soul in a place like that?
“But.. that's madness! He's the one running into danger. We're safe here at Hogwarts.”
“Malfoy...”
“I still can’t believe that Sirius gave Kreacher to me.”
“It was Pansy's idea. Mostly. Well.. the handcuffs were.”
The blond had heard enough. “Yeah, so glad we got that cleared up.” he sneered, pushing past her.
"I'm… unwell. May I be excused… sir?" he managed to ask.
Ron stared at the gigantic spider, pale and wide eyed. “I totally agree.”
"Yeah, I… I can wait outside, while you…" the younger boy offered nervously, silently berating himself for sneaking in here and ogling his boyfriend.
“Oh fuck! Hold onto him. I’m apparating us straight to the Cottage. We need Remus.” Sirius decided.
“Expell...” Ginny shouted, but he slapped a hand over mouth and hissed:
“The parties aren't so bad.” Hermione claimed, once Slughorn had left them alone. Since she was top of the class (right alongside Draco) she had also been welcomed into the Slug Club, as Slughorn kept calling his group of favourites. Harry's grades had gone down somewhat since getting rid of Snape's book, despite Draco's help. But since he was the Chosen One, Slughorn was still trying to add him to his collection.
“And Luna, of course.” Daphne chimed in. “She's the one who told us.”
And with that the evacuation started.
“Oi, could you stop that?”
“Okay. Sirius, Ron, Hermione… I know there’s no sense in asking you to leave, but I need to ask you to stay out of the way and be quiet throughout the ritual. Understood?” Remus looked at all of them in turn, waiting for their nods. Hermione and Ron sat down on the couch in the far corner of the room, while Sirius leaned against the wall. Remus turned back to Harry and Draco.
The boys return to Hogwarts and Draco realizes just how difficult this year is going to be.
“Yeah, but only because you guys won’t believe me that it’s at Hogwarts!”
"I said I would stay." Draco mumbled.
"He couldn't have known, Moony. With all the security measures… How the hell did that thing get through to Harry?"
“Hmm.. just tired.” came the muffled reply.
They still hadn't talked about it. And they hadn't told anyone. But they weren't doing much to keep it secret either. Of course his godfather would have noticed that he spent his nights in Draco's room.
"Don't worry. I'll deal with her." he promised.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, incredibly glad that Sirius understood. “It is.” he agreed. He was actually a bit surprised by the mature way his godfather was handling the whole thing. But of course Sirius wouldn’t be Sirius if he'd pass up on the chance to make his godson squirm.
“And what are you...” Sirius started to ask, but the werewolf shushed him, pointing at something ahead of them.
Since there was no immediate threat, Harry pulled the cloak off himself and Draco. Aberforth’s eyes zoomed in on them, before he turned to glare at Sirius again.
“Knowing Ron? I guess we’ll have to wait and see.”
Harry squinted at it. It did look familiar, although he couldn't tell where he'd seen it before.
“I’m not pouting.” Harry grumbled.
Harry grabbed his hand and the blond flinched slightly. Reluctantly he looked at the other boy, surprised at the sincerity on his face.
Harry gasped in surprise when he recognized them. "That's my mum. And… aunt Petunia."
Once they had scared Crabbe or Goyle off, they took turns walking up and down in front of the wall and tried every combination they could think of to get into the room.
“As you all know, this is the first time that Hogwarts offers an eighth year. Unfortunately this also brings a few minor problems. The rooming situation, most of all. Since we're a bit short of space and you're all adults here, we decided to put you in separate quarters. The third floor has been turned into a special eighth year dormitory. I hope that this arrangement will also help to promote inter house unity and I expect you to set a good example for the younger students. If you will follow me now, I shall lead you to your new quarters.”
“He was.”
(See the end of the chapter for
About 10 minutes later he was sitting in his favourite armchair with a cup of tea. Sirius and Remus were on the couch across from him.
The afternoon went by very fast and the later it got, the more anxious Harry started to feel. He spent lunch at Hagrid's hut and wasn't too surprised when Malfoy didn't show up for dinner. He didn't feel all that hungry himself. A strange, churning sensation in his stomach kept him from eating. Ginny, Neville and Hermione kept throwing him worried glances.
"Does it have something to do with the fact that we found a bunch of clothes and your glasses out in the garden?" Remus chimed in again.
Until suddenly strong hands grabbed his upper arms and he found himself staring into the determined grey eyes of Draco Malfoy. The blond was talking and somehow the words made it through the fog in Harry's head.
“You should. Long hair suits you.”
"Last time?" Harry echoed.
They stared at each other for a second longer. Then Draco moved lightning fast. Harry found himself pressed back against the door, while the blond's lips descended onto his. He returned the kiss with equal passion and decided that he didn't need to talk after all. He just needed this.
“You... Shit, okay. I think you're right.” Draco agreed reluctantly.
Draco blushed, but forced himself to keep looking at his boyfriend. “Not… exactly.” he amended. “I’m merely… stating my intentions.”
“You’re nothing like him! Don’t even think that for a second.” he whispered harshly. “Yes, there’s a piece of his soul inside you. And yes, that explains why you get these visions. But that’s all there is to it, Harry. He can’t possess you. He can’t make you do anything you don’t want. You are you. You’re amazing and kind and loving… You’re everything he’s not. Do you hear me?”
“I’ll be quick.” Harry promised.
A sly smile spread over Malfoy's lips. Harry took another, involuntary step back.
He didn't even know why that bothered him so much. But something about Voldemort's appearance had just been creepy. Like the evil maniac he'd gotten used to had tried to pose as a normal human and almost succeeded.
Draco was glad to hear that they obviously weren’t the only ones who couldn’t deny Luna anything.
"And what did she do then?" Harry asked, more than a little horrified.
“It really wasn’t that bad.” Draco claimed.
“No problem. I was just asking if you wanted to play exploding snap with Seamus, Dean and me?” the other boy repeated.
He looked good when he smiled, Harry decided. More human and approachable and … really kind of beautiful. He scooted closer to the blond without thinking. Only to have Draco pull away yet again.
Draco looked surprised that he’d given in so easily, but he agreed, so they made their way to the kitchen. They could already hear the two men arguing from afar. It was obvious that Remus wasn’t too fond of the idea of Harry coming along.
It had the size of a cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by teetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, thousands of books, no doubt banned or gratified or stolen, chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks, several rusty swords and a heavy, blood-stained axe.
Sirius caught on immediately. “No, it wasn't there. Waste of time.”
“I need to talk to Malfoy. Alone.”
“Thanks.” Draco muttered with a surprised grin, blushing a little.
Sirius was still trying to fight the giant snake, but it was a losing battle. It seemed as if it was immune to every curse and spell. No matter what he tried, the snake kept coming at him, forcing him to retreat further and further back towards the door. And with that further away from Harry and Draco.
Harry didn’t answer. He only buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck and clung to him even more. Draco stroked his back gently.
Her words were met with laughter and even a few cheers. Michael Corner was especially vocal about egging him on. Rolling his eyes the Gryffindor struggled to his feet and started to make his way out of the common room.
For a long moment there was nothing but his own heartbeat and the sound of his quiet breathing. And then… a prickling sensation, running along his nerve-endings. Harry gasped in surprise. His eyes flew open and his concentration broke.
Harry froze, staring at them in horror. They knew? But how could they know? Had Zabini let something slip after all? But Draco had been so sure he'd keep his mouth shut.
Harry shrugged. “It's okay. Thanks for trying.”
“Whenever Dumbledore leaves, a few members of the Order patrol the hallways at night. Just to be safe.” Remus answered.
“Let me show you then, love.” he murmured, grinning down at his lover…
"Then she yelled something about Ron never defending her honour. And Ron… well he yelled back that there was nothing to defend."
“Oh, yes. That would be lovely.” she agreed. “I used to go with Ginny, but I guess she’s going to be busy kissing Justin.”
“Those are objects of great value. People would pay a lot for them.” Blaise mused.
But of course moving into Andromeda's house meant that he was faced with another challenge. A challenge by the name of Harry Potter. Because his aunt had pointed out early on that Potter was her grandson's godfather and therefore also an important person in her life. She had warned him that the younger boy would be coming by regularly and that she expected Draco to be at least polite.
Harry grinned and after making sure that they were alone, leaned over to drop a quick kiss on his boyfriend's lips, glad that they had made up so quickly.
Harry scowled. “S’not funny.”
“But how do you know?” the girl asked.
Harry tried to catch Ron's eye to share a long suffering look, but the redhead was busy stuffing his face and ignoring Lavender's chatter. So he focused his concentration on Hermione again. "Did you find anything useful?"
Draco gave him a speculative glance.
Alice rolled her eyes. “Of course. Every pureblood should know the language of flowers.” she declared imperiously.
"Of course. I didn't mean to intrude." the Minister assured, pasting a fake smile onto his face and following the animagus back inside.
“But it was your home.” the younger boy pointed out.
“That tiny thing? You can't be serious.”
“Over there.”
“Leaving Harry an old Snitch – what the hell was that about?” Ron continued.
"Of course it is."
“Nott's never been very clever.” Draco muttered, earning himself an eye-roll from both girls.
“If you want him, you'll have to go through me.”
“Mine are bad.”
When Harry woke from his slumber Malfoy was nowhere to be seen. After debating with himself for a moment, curiosity won out. So he jumped down from the armchair and started looking around. He was obviously in Malfoy's bedroom. A large bed, made out of dark wood, dominated the room. The sheets were light blue and looked very inviting. There was also a wardrobe, a cupboard, a small table and the armchair he'd been sleeping in. The walls were painted blue to match the sheets. All in all the room looked nice and cosy. Not exactly what he would have expected Malfoy's bedroom to look like. If he'd ever wondered what it might look like. Not that he had. Lately.
“Yes?”
“No, we’re not.”
“But not impossible?”
Before Harry could react she had taken off her shoe and whacked him hard on the butt with it. He yelped in pain.
It all started at breakfast, a few days after the Christmas holidays, when a barn owl landed in front of him with a package. Since their mail was still undergoing a screening for cursed or dark objects, there was no need for caution. At least that's what he'd believed. So Harry opened the package without thinking. Peeling back the wrapping paper he discovered a small, leather bound book. Guessing that Remus must have sent it, he picked it up with a frown.
“Who was it meant for?”
“It's basically a story about trying to cheat death.” Remus explained. “Three brothers get to choose a gift from death. The first brother gets the elder wand, which is said to be unbeatable. But he brags about it and gets murdered in his sleep shortly after. The second brother asks for the power to raise the dead. He receives the resurrection stone, which he uses to bring back his dead girlfriend. But it doesn’t really bring her back to life. She is merely a shadow and he becomes so depressed that he commits suicide in the end. The third brother gets an invisibility cloak. He manages to hide from death all his life and finally dies peacefully of old age.”
His plan seemed to work, because Daphne got to her feet and declared she needed to get going now, because Lavender was waiting. He breathed a sigh of relief.
