Now it was like some cosmetic joke; Harry refused to cast the Killing Curse during the war, but now that the war was over, and he did cast it, how could he justify killing Kreacher. He murdered Kreacher, why?
your randy, possessive, alpha dragon wouldn’t possibly want to make a claim on his mate!” She said sarcastically. “I too was young and in love once, Draco.”   Narcissa look became far off and voice dreamy as if lost in a dream. “I loved your father, once. Passionately, deeply, and believed he felt the same way at one point. He was quite affectionate with me before my inheritance. Courted me properly, wooing me with high praises and gifts. Your father, when he put the effort into it, could be charming. And since we were not yet eighteen, we did not have
“Pure-blood upbringing has a more extensive education than yours. My earliest education before Hogwarts included Greek and Latin roots, to help with spellwork. Ellios is the God of the Sun, so Eliana would mean, daughter of the sun. My own Owl is named after the Greek Goddess of the hunt-Artemis. She is a Great Horned Owl.” Draco says puffing out his chest, clearly proud of his owl.
"I get the items you need and you teach me how to live out here? No..no funny business?" Harry asked.
That statement clicked with another revealed by Ollivander. 'I've wondered if it would be the same.'
“Yes. I, too would like not to be mobbed. Once was plenty enough, as is. Shall we go?” Draco headed towards the front door, faintly curious to see what the townhouse looked like from the sidewalk.
Before the man could report with an equally scathing remark, a more timid voice interjected. "awe-hum, actually...the co-signer on the house indeed is a Mrs. Andromeda Tonks."
It is a base need to provide food, shelter, and comfort among other primal urges to procreate with his chosen mate. He couldn’t tell Hari that, not until Sirius told him the secret or Hari turned eighteen.
Perhaps pulling too hard as Draco’s head jerked with the motion. His lips lost their purchase on Hari’s weeping head with an audible pop. Seeing Draco wince minutely, Hari slackened his hold while maintaining his grip. Hari was rewarded when Draco leaned into his gentler touch.
Draco made it down in about thirty-five minutes. It was the bare minimum he allowed himself to primp and preen in the mirror to look presentable. Hari was once more at the stove top, the house-elves fluttering around him. Aunt Andromeda was feeding Teddy a bottle, and his mother was primly drinking tea and reading the morning paper. He was nervous about what their reaction would be when he told them Hari and he were dating.
Hesitating only for a moment, Harry reached up to feel Draco's smooth but strong grasp take hold of him and haul him to his feet seamlessly. But he didn't let go right away. Harry tilted his head to the side in question, "Well, where's my welcome?" He said with a teasing white toothed smile.
Arthur Weasley’s mother Cedrella Black married Septimus Weasley and had their lines blasted off the family tree. Molly Weasley née Prewitt’s mother Lucretia Black married Ignatius Prewitt and had their family lines blasted off the family tree. Draco Malfoy’s aunt Andromeda Black married a muggle-born Ted Tonks and had their family lines blasted off the family tree. Harry’s own ancestor whom he’s never known, appeared on the tapestry; Dorea Black married Harry’s Great-Great Uncle Charlus Potter, his Great Grandfather Henry's (Harry) brother, and for some reason their lines were blasted off the family tree.
Muffled shouts were heard. The policeman, a laughingly punny man compared to his enormous uncle, was trying to restrain his uncle from stepping on him. A slightly bulkier guard charged into the room to help. The room went dark for Harry and he heard no more.
"Fine don't tell me how you injured yourself, probably a potion for skin care gone wrong, or something. What did you use as treatment?" Draco was simply gawking at Hari who turned his hand and raised it to closer to his nose to see. Alcohol surely wasn't helping his eyesight any better.
After a moment, Hari perked up. “I’d be damned.” He breathed, looking over Draco’s shoulder. “The drawing room’s been here this entire time. No wonder no one from the Order knew about it. Mrs. Black’s portrait hung right across from the door. We’d never be able to open the door, without waking her up.” Hari exclaimed.
"You're a Parselmouth?" Draco said quite dumbly. He could see for himself Alleycat was one. The giant snake and hissing obviously giving it away.
What could have possibly possessed Madam Pomfrey to keep Harry Potter in the hospital wing for eighteen days. I didn't dare visit while he was conscious. The feast is ten days away and I want know why he gets to be excused from pointless classes that won't really have anything to do with this years grades. Our grades for the exams were posted today.
Hari was brushing his teeth just a vigorously as he washed his body, spraying toothpaste over the faucet and mirror. Draco would have been irked, if he wasn't still memorized by the sight of Hari nearly naked next to him. Gulping once, he trailed his eyes over one scar that stood in stark contrast against tanned skin as it went from right hip past his taut buttocks, and over the right outside thigh. Draco noted on a quickly muffled giggle that Hari's ass and thighs, what he could see of them from the barely concealing towel, were lily white in comparison to the rest of his body.
They moved onto shirts; t-shirts, oxfords, polo, Hensley; long sleeve, and short sleeve. Hari was dizzy with the amount of work it took in overhauling his wardrobe. Draco was having a blast.
consent needed to be given.  He tried to pull away-to speak, but Hari only held tighter, leaned closer.  His breath came in desperate gasp for air. Draco needed Hari to stop.
"The only gaggle of geese I know who squawks too much, would be you Arlys after two glasses of Chardonnay." C'iemone replied to the eruption of laughter from the room.
The two nodded in return before checking out the sitting arrangement. Blaise slipped his own wand out of a hidden sheath, ignoring the group that tensed, and waved it at the only spare chair, executing a perfect
stifling the urge to tuck his drawing away, he slowly glanced up at Hari holding the contented teddy in one arm, legs curled up to chest. Hari looked down curiously at what Draco was doing.
Andromeda was speechless. Here she was in financial distress, home literally about to be taken away from her, and with no living family capable of taking her and Teddy in, and this man, really a boy, sneaks into her home and her life with an Invisibility Cloak, and offers her sanctuary like the hero and savior he is.
Narcissa didn’t know what to do without any gold, she never held a job before, and how would she be able to maintain her lifestyle. Merlin, how would Draco take loosing his inheritance. No, no, Draco didn’t deserve any of this. All she ever wanted was him safe. Desperate she grasped at straws, “My sister, Bellatrix, if she dies without a will, her vaults would liquidate back into the Black’s vaults…”
Having a scent blocker that doesn’t completely suppress his scent all together is important, because scents serve a multiple of purposes socially; identifying self, emotions, and property.
Once more the words were obstructed by Draco's lowered head. Hari went over to Draco to tilt his head up. Draco wouldn't meet his eyes at first, until Hari squeezed his jaw harder than strictly necessary, green eyes blazing.
The press has been hounding him for an interview, stalking his every move, taking pictures of him everywhere. It has only been two weeks and there is no end to the celebrations in the streets, and the constant owls asking him to attended. Harry had even more press and people fawning over him than he did before.
Why does that Weasel and Mud-blood always have to butt into other wizard’s business? I approached Potter, hoping to get him alone, to apologize for everything, and congratulate him on making Seeker. Harry is never just by himself.  So, I had an idea. I would openly challenge him to a duel, he’d accept and I would be able to apologize for my behavior in private. I Curse Father’s spies who make me keep up my pretense.
"Thirty-eight, Sweatum." aunt Petunia crooned over his head. Dudley tried batting her hand away, just herrumpted as he plopped down into his seat to rip open presents.
"The third page includes the Potters' vault, it collects interest and royalties from multiple investments over the past centuries that keep filling the coffers. You are seventeen and can now review and withdraw whatever moneys you wish to. Your own investment you made in '96 with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes is just a small portion of the investments, Potters' over the centuries have contributed to the coffers.

So I keep secrets in here, and some I will share with Mon Mère, like the secret of Harry Potter. Mon Mère got me books, lots of them, and when I am alone I read them to my house-elf. I think Harry Potter must be the strongest wizard in the world, to survive the Killing Curse and he doesn’t even have a wand yet. I don’t have a real wand, just Papa’s old one that he doesn’t use anymore. So, truly Harry Potter must be the greatest, Dobby agrees with me. Papa was really angry when I said this. He says, the Dark Lord is the greatest wizard of our time. I don’t know, there are lots and lots of books on Harry Potter, and none on this Dark Lord Papa brags about. I like
"Why, what's wrong? I told you if you ever where in a financial pinch to ask for help." Alice squeaked in a panicked voice.
Draco's magic was a blinding white with black specs scattered throughout. Hari's own magic—a soft green glow—tentatively reached out to caress Draco's before getting to work healing the flayed forearm.
"This is bore-ing!" Dudley proclaimed disappointedly when he didn't get his way. Something that Harry found he did often, if not frequently with his parents.
this...How? His thoughts were incoherent and fading away, as he scrambled trying to think of a solution to save their lives.
, what once had been a grand entranceway, high ceilings décor with carved wooden serpents, complete with an overhead chandelier, but came into disrepair after the death of Walburga Black, leaving a poor and dusty echo of what was once the proud ancestral home to the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black.
Draco was exhilarated at the motion the motorbike made as it zipped and swerved around much larger cars. It was much like flying a broomstick, the steering, except instead of being high in the sky and only having to worry about a couple bludgers knocking them off their brooms, they were on the ground with thousands of other vehicles, too close for comfort. But Draco wasn’t scared, he felt oddly safe with his arms wrapped around the taunt muscles of Hair’s abdomen, this moment paralleled the terrifying fiendfyre chase in the Room of Requirements. Draco used the pretense of being scared to hold on tighter to Hari on the busy streets of London.
"You may find yourself down the rabbit hole tonight, Draco. But you're neither the Red nor White Queen, as glamourous as you are. No, only the Black Queen will do." Sheryl practically vibrated out of her skin.
"Uh-huh" Was all Draco could get out on a strangled gasp. He was desperately glad that his rut was over, otherwise he would have surely tried to molest the unsuspecting boy taking a vigorous shower next to him, if the amount of splashes against the glass door was anything to go by. Gathering as much Slytherin nearly nonexistent courage, Draco pulled the plug on the water, standing up he turned on the spray overhead desperate to rinse off. He heard Hari's teeth chatter briefly, and Hari's quick exhaled "Burr" as the water reverted to cold when Draco turned on his taps.
So, he ran away. But he wasn't a coward. No, his matra was 'live to fight another day'. He would use his new found magic, and cunning, and resourcefulness to survive. Because Harry Potter had ambition, alright. He was going to be something other than
After Andromeda and Narcissa left, they stood in silence and still dripping cold mud. It would be an easy thing to vanish the mud from most of their attire but Draco figured a warm bath would warm his body and cleanse his body after a stressful day away from Grimmauld Place. Stepping out of muddy trainers, the teens looked at each other, neither really wanting to leave each other’s company, but too awkward with each other still to voice this.
The Prosecutor cleared his throat gruffly and peered down at first Narcissa and then Draco, completely bypassing Lucius altogether. “A week or so ago, a letter in triplicate arrived by owl to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. So many letters had been sent to this department, vying for a conviction of the accused, that this letter was almost overlooked; except this letter was addressed directly to the Minster of Magic, the Chief Warlock, and the Head of the Wizengamot.” The Prosecutor paused in his deliverance. “written by none other than Harry Potter" Draco sucked in a sharp breath and couldn't believe what was happening. The Procecuter had to shout over the excitement in the room, "REQUESTING THE RELEASE OF DRACO AND NARCISSA MALFOY!" The chatter stopped at that announcement and the Procecuter cleared his throat, "I will now read this letter to the chamber at large.”
"Vernon dear? Who is it?" A feminine voice said with hurried footsteps coming to the door. The woman was tall with blonde hair and an unusually long neck. One of her hands reached up to grab at her own neck.
Draco was startled at the blatant show of sexuality as the Queen on stage swept her hands down her body sensually, before planting her feet to belt out the next words to the song. To his astoundment, the whole club seemed to jump to their feet with one hand on their hips and the other out in front as if pushing someone away--even his table, even Hari.
his alpha said reared its head. Draco still loved his sassiness, especially when it was directed at him.
Dusk arrived before they knew it. When shadows of the trees fell across their picnic area, Andromeda called the boys over from playing an interesting Muggle game of tag, with the added bonus of laso charms and tickling charms.
At Draco’s confused frown, Narcissa sighed. “If you want to be more affectionate in your courtship with Hari, as I well know you will be, you’ll have to ask his permission. Test the water’s. Ask for a kiss, to hold his hand, to put your arms around him. He’ll need to ask as well. With consent, these things are not out of the realms of possibility while he is still under eighteen. Sex is still off the table, you know.”
“We went to the Manor. The Aurors took and categorized every dark artifact they could find; I helped break some curses on them. I found Father’s hidden ledgers. Mother… Father is involvement in the war even more extensively than we could have imagined. I found some discrepancies and went to Gringotts to try to resolve them. ”
Now that the information was dwindling, Narcissa could feel herself becoming more and more aggravated; the confined space pressing in on her enhanced senses. Narcissa was always proud of her inheritance; confident in her creatures’ blood, but now her instincts were working against her. She didn’t do well in confine spaces. A rustling sound of fabric drew her attention away from her mounting discomforts.
Draco always loved teasing him about his fanclub, ignoring the fact, he was a secret member of said fan club. “Don’t want owls swooping in on you when your trying to sleep, delivering fan mail, famous Hari Potter?” Draco mocked without any of his usual malice.
He didn't even know his whole name before he entered primary school. Before then, he only answered to "Boy" or "Freak". Harry James Potter.
Hari would like to blame it on the dream journals, a constant on-going crude joke between Dean and Seamus. Hari and even Neville, the one eager the most to fit in, stayed stubbornly quiet on the topic.
Suddenly, Draco’s hair was yanked out of its long tail and it fell like silk strands along his face. His eye’s widened in shock at the rough treatment.
“That will be seven Galleons. Let’s con-tin-ue! Your old wand Mr. Malfoy, I do believe Mr. Potter is in possession of it. Is that right?” Mr. Ollivander turned his eyes on Hari once more. “This wand, not your wand defeated the Dark Lord.” Hari gulped while the other three occupants sucked in their breaths audibly. Hari handed over the wand in question. “Unicorn hair…yes, yes, no not suitable for the both of you at all. Unicorn hair is too
“Do you want to be freed? I could free you, offer you a wage instead…hic… like Dobby.” His mumbling was becoming incoherent, and Kreacher was barely able to understand the drunken and slurred rambles of his often too serious and depressed young master. Mostly Kreacher was ignoring him, focusing on getting a pepper-up potion, and hang over cure ready for him. He tuned in just in time to hear any barkeeps worse nightmares.
For once Wanda kept her trap shut and didn’t give away Sheryl’s motives for feeding the boy in ragged clothes. She finally disappeared behind a curtained door. When Sheryl knew she was gone from sight, and there was no one suspicious along the street, she waved Hari inside. Her first instinct was a place by the door, seeing as he had stiffened when entering the cramped space, thinking he’d likely flee at any moment. But no, the boy took a few more hesitant steps inside before glancing up and over his shoulder at Sheryl in question. “Wherever you’d like, Sugar.” Sheryl said. “The sign says seat yourself.” Hari nodded and agilely scooted around patrons and cramped tables to a small table in the back, allowing for him to see the rest of the room and out the window to the street, yet a young potted fern hid him from view from most.
Narcissa and Draco attend the funeral of Crabbe and Goyle and then are apprehended by the aurors to stand trial for war crimes.
"Not all the Malfoy's. Just Narcissa and Draco. Lucius can suffer the Dementor's kiss, he has already escaped justice twice now."
Draco’s Hawthorn wand worked for him but the magic felt off. Not to mention he didn’t feel right using the wand when it use to belong to Draco. When Hari tried to return the wand, Draco held it for a mere minute then returned it saying, “it no longer fits my magic as it is now.”
Draco sat up, fluffing some pillows behind his head, and now sat plucking invisible loose fibers from the comforter. Upon seeing Hari return, he pulled back the comforter in clear invitation. Suddenly nervous, Hari climbed into bed with his boyfriend.
Draco heard his mother scream, and frightened he sped up, running the final two feet into the house and stopped in his tracks, "mo..." the word dying on his lips. Harry rushed in behind him to see the joyous reunion himself. Narcissa and Andromeda had each other by their forearms as the jumped and twirled in each others arms, shrieking their laughter, and tears running down their cheeks.
"You plan on taking him from me, don't you?" She said matter of factly. Opening his mouth, Harry was about to respond to that, but what he was about to say was interrupted with the sound of a doorbell. Andromeda sat motionless, not wanting to answer the door again. Harry very carefully placed Teddy in Andromeda's waiting arms and went to answer the door for her.
“Well yeah, Dumbledore had the Elder wand, and the Resurrection stone belonged to the Gaunt family, and the Invisibility Cloak has been passed down to the eldest Potter for generations. I’m not trying to hoodwink you; Dray…I just don’t want it known. I’d rather not be dueled every day over possession of the Elder Wand. Its owners have a tendency to be murdered in their sleep.”
Draco laughed dryly, a broken chuckle, before sighing as he shook back his hair from his face. "What brought that on anyway? Surely, you've seen more gruesome scars than this?"
"I'm so signed your name on the next round, Hari." Alice chimed in from snuggling on Sheryl's other side.
Mouth suddenly dry, Hari gulped. "It's a good thing you aren't going alone." Hari padded out on socked feet to his own room to change his clothes for something less resembling he just came back from a funeral.
Mon Mère shares many secrets with me. She calls them Black secrets, and Black secrets are different from Malfoy secrets. This journal is a secret from Papa. Mon Mère  got it for me and other presents too. A multi-compartment trunk that also only opens to my blood and some books that Papa didn’t want me reading. They’re not even Dark Arts, just kid books, about the most powerful little boy in the whole wide world, Harry Potter. All the children my age wanted to read the colorful pages. Even some of the adults. But Papa said no and he never says no to what I want. I got really mad and yelled at him in front of his friends. Papa beat me with his cane in front of his friends. He says son must show their father respect. My back is bleeding. My head really hurts too. Papa refused to allow Mon Mère to fix it. He says let them be a reminder of my rudeness. That’s not the word Papa used, but Mom Mère says that’s what it means.
“Now we eat breakfast.” Draco said excitedly. He tugged on Hari’s arm and pulled him along to the altar. Delicious fruit filled sweetbreads and scones sat next to round goblets of pumpkin juice, orange juice, and by the smell some kind of spiced alcohol beverage. “Honey mead.” Draco said at Hari’s curious glance.
Draco touched the golden handle, and a white light seemed to radiate from the core, and the wood hummed. Every hair on Draco’s body stood at attention. “Very good… very revealing, Mr. Malfoy. This wand is 13 inches made of aspen, a slight curve at the tip, surprising, no? NO! Oh well, this wand core is brother to your mother’s. Draco took a closer inspection of the design carved into the golden handle; it was of a dragon eating its tail, Ouroboros. It felt perfect.
“oh Merlin, Teddy!” Harry shouted, barely able to hear himself over the screaming of Mrs. Black’s portrait, admittedly who has been making a ruckus since he stepped in the door. But Harry could care less, he was too lost in his grief. How could he forget that he was named godfather? Teddy is little more than a month old and now he was orphaned, growing up to never now his birth parents. Teddy is just like Harry. “Just like me…”
With an anguished scream, Harry pulled out the Hawthorn and Unicorn Hair wand that once belonged to Draco Malfoy and blew up the umbrella stand. Several portraits were also destroyed in the process, which caused Mrs. Black to scream louder. Somehow in all that chaos Harry was able to make out a small movement out of his peripheral vision.
“NOOOOOOoooo!” Potter howled in pain, not hearing the satisfying pop of Draco’s cock clearing the tight ring of muscles of his asshole. Draco paused, not because he was waiting for Potter to adjust, but because Potter’s passage was almost too tight, squeezing too hard, making it painful for Draco to advance any further.
"I...I....well, I didn't say it was YOU. And, I am serious about her. She's my girl and I wanted her to know that I'm turning over a new leaf. I've had a chance to reflect on my actions.  I'm taking her to see my parents tonight at dinner and then split off to the theatre in case dinner doesn't go well."
Andromeda didn't know if she was suppose to follow as well, but she certainly wasn't going to miss out on the excitement. Nymphadora took after her mother more than Harry ever knew before. They rushed down winding corridors, left-right-left again, 'what? Did they pass that gargoyle before?'
Perfectly ordinary. Yes, that's what her and her family were. And she wouldn't have it any other way. So, after reading the letter she, scoffed and promptly threw it in the rubbish bin and went about tending to her own month old son, Dudley. In her opinion, her son was the perfect cherub, with chubby cheeks and golden curls.
Harry does look amazing on a broom. He takes to a broom like a bird to the sky. He’s a natural. But his movements are so bold; he takes on the challenge like a true Gryffindor; with bravery. He flipped his broom in midair, catching the Remembrall right before it could crash through a window high within the East Tower. Potter was celebrating this awesome feat of bravery when Professor McGonagall came out onto the castle grounds.
Sheryl didn’t bat a fake and heavily mascaraed eyelash at the unique seating arrangement and just accepted it, although there were about five empty tables between him and the nearest patron. She went on explaining the rules of the challenge that she just made it up on the spot. “The rules are simple; order two large entrees,“ Sheryl winked suggested at the now blushing boy, “three large side dishes, and a large beverage. Non-alcoholic for you. Finish the entire meal in one sitting, the meal is free and your name is placed on the Hall of Fame. Don’t finish the meal, you pay, or in this case you work off your meal in the kitchen, and get to take the leftovers home. Deal?” Sheryl asked, holding out her dark, golden bangle clad hand to Hari to shake. Hari took the offered hand.
The next song interrupted Draco's wondering thoughts and eyes from Hari back to the stage. The woman doing a bad interpretation of a Empress sauntered to the edge of the stage. This song was about infidelity and the husband responding to an ad in the Newspaper about meeting up with a strange woman not his wife.
Draco snickered at the sight of his usual poised and proper mother. Narcissa walked over to Draco’s side, tisked at the smudge of grime on her son’s shoulder, and pulled out a pristine white handkerchief. Ignoring her own appearance, she fussed over Draco, all the while chatting cheerily with her sister about past memories.
“So, the rumors say. But I’d really rather not test that theory, would you?” He asked with a raised brow. Hari nodded his head vigorously.
"I'm staying away from the newspapers right now." Draco scuffed his toe on the concrete, looking up at his trusted friend. "Have they accused me of using the Unspeakable, Imperius?"
Hari’s eyes reflected his own sadness, to have never known any of his family. Hari remembered the Mirror of Erised and numerous nameless Potter’s that milled behind him in his reflection. Perhaps Dorea and Charlus were among them.
Now it was Hari's turn to be flustered. "Well Malfoy, for better or worse, we are kind of like family now, and family is stuck with each other." Hari managed to get out.
Of all the things that Draco Malfoy loved about Hari bloody Potter, being an oblivious idiot was not one of them. But to honestly not know about the creature’s inheritance was almost blasphemy. After all it was a major part of the evolution of magical society. Draco took handfuls of his hair and pulled in frustration. His perfect hair now reflected the turmoil inside his head.
No, he was in Hari’s home, in Hari’s bedroom, and wasn’t that just convient how Hari’s bed was right there, inviting.
"It is not our goals tonight to humiliates any of you. None here will laugh at you." Sheryl says alongside her sue-chief, partner in crime, and on again-off again, but mainly on again, lover. “Do you think we do it for laughs? As a joke?” Sheryl says raising an eyebrow in challenge.
I am writing this letter on the behalf of the accused, Draco Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy née Black. I do not presume to know everything there is to know about the two, but I do know that they do not deserve a sentence in Azkaban. Let me present my case and hope the jury and Wizengamot can come to the same decision as I. No one knows the inner most thinking of Voldemort as I, because the famous scar on my forehead is a Cursed Scar that linked our minds. I could see into the mind of Voldemort and experience every feeling as he did.The Daily Prophet always posted articles about my alleged "fits" where in actuality, I unconsciously slipping into his mind when his emotions were at its height, when Voldemort was either torturing or killing people. The darkest wizard of our time is gone.  As the Dark Mark on the forearms of his followers fades with time, so too will my scar fade, and let his memory fade from our minds for good.
"Now cubs! This is C'iemone and this is Arlys." C'iemone and Arlys both wore blue, but their costumes could not be more opposite than night and day.
It was early, he strained his ears listening. He didn't hear any movement from the room next to his. Good, Hari was still asleep and he could take a much needed bath. Leaving the windows open, he gathering his bathing supplies; shampoo and conditioner, bath oils, and soaps. He stepped out of his room trying to be quiet as possible, as he didn't want to alert his floormate he was up. It wouldn't be good to confront his long time crush, crusty and smelling like stale cum and sweat.
Perhaps if he woke, he’d think more on the meaning of this dream. The irony of questioning the meaning of his dream was not lost to him. Perhaps, he should have taken Trelawny’s Oneiromancy unit on dreams more seriously. Then his Occlumency lessons with Snape would have gone better. But for right now he allowed himself the pleasure of Draco's hot breath on his skin, and sweet lips brushing his collarbone.
“Not that side.” Draco said when he saw Hari’s hand reach for the side of the wardrobe that held clothing he’d never worn before. They wouldn’t smell like Draco at all. His scent had to be on Hari. It would mark him and claim him so everyone else would know that Hari Potter belonged to him.
Hari was talking all the while, adjusting his voice, higher and lower at times, in what Draco could only mentally call,
“Is everything alright over here? Need help with a selection?” Candice was back from talking with her colleague. Hari noticed Draco grit his teeth. If he hadn’t been looking carefully he would have missed the slight crack in his Malfoy-mask.
“You may be the Boy Who Lived, and have people constantly fawning over you. I can get past that. What I will not let pass is the Boy on a Date With Me allowing some bint to flirt with him whilst I’m standing right beside him.”  Draco said bluntly.
Hari nuzzled against Draco’s shoulder. “You, Draco Malfoy, never cease to amaze me with your wealth of useless and at times useful information.” He whispered against his neck.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
elato. I’ll see that one of the house-elves has it in cold storage or stasis until you are ready.” And so saying, Hari left the once forgotten withdrawing room and went up the stairs.
"Teddy and Mrs. Tonks here, at Grimmauld Place?" Harry could barely recall anything about Andromeda Tonks, having only met her twice in person, he only remembered that she shared an unfavorable family resemblance to her older sister Bellatrix Lestrange. "But Kreacher, hang on. Mrs. Tonks has her own home, whose to say she even wants to live here with us?"
“Connor,” Oliver shouted back. “We’re over here! We’ll cross when it’s clear!” Oliver said as he picked up his eleven year old daughter and dashed to his husband’s side once a clear path was made in the road.
Rubbing the back of his neck shyly, Harry laughed nervously. "The Sorting Hat actually told me that twice, but the Sword of Gryffindor disagrees. Awe, I wasn't lying I came here to help, well actually I came here to ask you something"
Draco woke up later that morning, wincing at the bright light of the late morning sun streaming through the open window. His head was pounding and his tongue felt like cotton and tasted like rubbish. He didn't remember how he got to bed last night.
Draco was definitely a tomato at this point. "I did not wipe my mouth off after kissing you. My lips were turning blue from
“Hari, let me tell you about a family legend.” Draco began. “It is said that the House of Black comes from a long and prestigious noble line. There is a legend of one such family member, Melusine. Legend said she was a dragon disguised as a beautiful woman, able to enchant any mortal man. Such was the case that she seduced and married a king among men, and had two beautiful children with him. But the people of the town they lived in were wary of her foreign blood, and distrust her, not even knowing the enchanting truth. One day the townsfolk convinced thier king that their queen was a monster and needed to be locked away or killed. So they trapped Queen Melusine. She cried and she pleaded for her husband to trust in her and believe in her. But he turned his back on her, and in anger she transformed into her dragon form and in a rage burned down a portion of the townsquare and took one of her children with her. :leaving one more for the King’s heir. That heir could also turn into a dragon, he married and passed down his blood to the next generation, and the generation after that, until today. This is the story the members of the House of Black tell their children.”
Harry pulled the plate closer and bit into his third puff pastry this one with raspberry jam instead of egg, cheese and sausage. And munched in contemplation. Pulling another cup of tea this time with sweetener in it, he blew before taking a sip. He was just about to say yes, when a tapping on the window drew his eyes to the door with the closed blinds and closed sign on the door to the bakery.
Finally done with that disaster of a confrontation over rooms, the last place to explore was the attic with empty Owlery, storage space, and new house-elf quarters for Kokoa and Dot. Hari offered Kreacher that space or even the smaller bedroom on the first floor, but Kreacher declined preferring his lonely boiler room.
Especially, third and fourth year. He was a mess of teenage hormones and anxiety. His aversion of the topic didn’t help when he shared a dorm with four other curious boys. He wasn’t a prude in any definition of the word, but he felt like these topics should be private--something he simply never had.
He was just about to open the fridge when he rolled his eyes at his own stupidity. The light might attract unwanted attention. Turning to the pantry using the light from above the stove and squinty in the dark, he rooted around the pantry. There were so many options to choose from.
Bill Weasley shows up at Grimmauld Place to get rid of Mad-Eye’s booby trap at the front entrance. He is displeased to discover, Draco Malfoy, the boy who inadvertently was the cause of his disfigurement, sitting calmly down to breakfast with Hari. Who will win in the dominance game between alphas?
Hari hesitated as he didn't want to aggravate Draco when he was at this low point after his fathers funeral. But...
Draco just stuffed his hands in his slack’s pockets and shrugged in answer.  Technically; no, he wasn’t disinherited, but he didn’t have access to Muggle money either. Sheryl accepted the shrug as a yes and let the topic go.
Forget the fact Hari couldn't have babies, the act of creating one send Hari's head reeling. The fact that Draco would want to do anything of that nature with him was still uncomfortable for him. “Get your head out of the fucking gutter, Malfoy!”
"Did I forget to tell aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon he was innocent all this time?" Hari batted his lashes.
"You are staring, Malfoy. Haven't you any manners at all, it's rude to stare. So, say something or look in the other direction." Hari said. He was no longer hungry, his appetite long gone from nerves.
Koako spoke up first as Kreacher was still disorientated after banging his head so many times. “Mistress Malfoy-Black wants to have breakfast on the terrace patio.”
Harry managed to pilfer £120 from his petrified aunt's purse. Harry had no idea how far this would take him, but he had to get out of Little Whinging. That meant he needed to use the money sparingly, which meant a cab was out.
Hari was impressed by the cleanliness of Hari’s room, remembering the earlier state it had been in just this morning.
"Whose that bulking lad with them? Oh Hari doesn't look too happy. Oh, he's furious. Best go bail the savior out, shall we?" Blaise says clapping his shoulder once, before striding away seemingly without a care in the world. his stride was long and confident.
Rushing from the kitchen she hurried to her son. Her tall and very wide son ran into Petunia's arms, burying his pudgy face into Petunia's nearly nonexistent bosom, wailing "Mummy."
Harry Potter now sat at the base of the grand staircase clutching the lifeless form of his house-elf cruelly named Kreacher, and sobbed. He sobbed for the unfairness of his childhood, thinking of all the times he was beaten, or starved, or locked in his cupboard under the stairs. Worse of all he thought of all the times when he was ignored or neglected. There were times when Harry wanted to be alone, from the abuse of the Dursley’s, or away from his friends at Hogwarts. But it was worse when all he wanted was to be surrounded by people who loved him, cared for his wellbeing, and they were gone.
Then a miracle happened. Not in the sense that his magic kicked in and washed his hair for him, that would be too easy for him, instead he spotted a gym. A gym with showers. It was easy enough to sneak passed the tall counters in the front, snatch a towel, and secure a stall. When concerned people asked him where his parents were, he just said, "I'm ten not five. My mummy says I'm too old to take a shower with her." He faked pouted and left quickly after that if they asked too much questions.
"He's gone, Dray. Never coming back. I've made sure of that. I'd know if he still lived." And with that said, rubbing his old lightning bolt scar absently, Hari deciding to ignore the confrontation for now. It wasn't worth it anymore. Hari changed the subject. "So, the kitchen. The Laundry. Boiler room. Cold storage. The pantry. The wine cellar. Kreacher's den. And the second Floo entry point." Hari said, ending each sentence with a point of a finger.  Draco was not interested in this area he referred to as the servants domain. Other than checking out the content of the wine cellar, Hari had a feeling the Malfoy's would leave this area alone.
Draco's eyes were immediately drawn to the scars on Hari's torso and arms. He didn't know he stood up until his own fingertips traced over warm skin on Hari's chest. Beneath his fingers he could feel as well as see, the 's' shaped burn mark in the dip between his clavicle.
Across the street from Sheryl’s Place, a tiny bottle blonde middle-aged woman frantically got on the phone to ring her longtime friend of fifteen years. “Sheryl! He’s here. Mama, Hari came back!” She squealed into the phone. She was met with silence and then the sound of a dial tone as Sheryl hung up. Rushing to the window, she stood on tiptoes to see over the display, just in time to see the large dark silhouette emerge from the kitchen and stand at the entrance, with cleaver in hand, bulging muscled arms crossed over chest.
Hari tasted his own spunk on Draco’s fingers and it wasn’t at all what he expected. It was salty and bitter, and the texture was thick like heavy cream. Hari felt his expression contort into a grimace.
He clapped his hand and startled the four other occupants in the shop. He rushed around the counter, and eagerly turned the sign in the front from “vacant” to “occupied”. Mr. Ollivander only catered to one patron at a time, in this case three; Draco, Narcissa, and Hari. “Let’s start with your mother, I sense her magical signature on you, ooh a signet ring, quite fancy.” He said when Draco handed over the ring.
When the Dursleys returned that night, Dudley was passed out on his father's shoulder. The husband and wife stood in the foreir, stunned speechless.
And so only stuttering a few times in the beginning, not expecting he would have to speak with the Minister of Magic in person instead of by owl, Harry launched into an impromptu speech on how Narcissa Malfoy and her son Draco Malfoy should have all charges dropped against them. When he was done, apprehensive about his success, and out of breath and painting; Harry waited expectantly for Kingsley response.
Blood spurted from his head and torso, like being cut by a sword. With hardly a cry, Draco collapsed back to the wet, and bloody floor, his blood mixing with Potters, floating like crimson flowers. Draco’s hand scrambled at his blood-soaked chest, scarcely believing his eyes. ‘Harry Potter had cast Dark Magic!’
I am not satisficed with this chapter, but if I have it on a saved draft another day it might as well be another week.
“Ah, yes Master Orion made Sirius drink nearly a whole bottle of this when Orion’s prized Bourbon was discovered in his room. Sirius was not enjoying it so much then either. Master Orion was also a Bourbon drinker. Lesson number one, be awares of the proof. Don’t be asking for just any Bourbon. That there’s a 94 proof, 18 year charred oak. ” Snapping his fingers Kreacher banished the bottle back to the bar, and another took its place. This ones…I thinks more your style. Tries this. Slow sip and let sit on your tongue, before swallowing, no gulp like before.”
Narcissa raised her eyebrows at the compromising position her son was in. Draco was sitting on his bed shirtless with his legs parted to allow Hari to stand between them. Even though her son was blushing from embarrassment, she could see the initial effects of
“Yes, how can this unworthy of house-elves be assisting the Mistress and Master, this fine evening?” Squeaked the mousy doe eyed House-elf with a hemp sack for a dress pulled over her head.
"Oh, sorry Andromeda, here...give me a second..." Looking around for a scrap of parchment, ink and quill  before seeing an envelope and pen across the room. "Accio!" They zoomed into his hands and he hurriedly wrote down the address for the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black.
Draco’s pinkie and ring finger twitched as if to comply, but the movement was halted with a hiss of pain from Draco. Hari hissed in sympathy as he tried to crush his anger.
Hari’s bedroom door was left ajar. Taking that as an invitation, he first peered inside the room before stepping bodily inside. It was empty. He huffed in annoyance. He honestly expected Hari that dunderhead to still be sorting out his room, unless he suddenly became very apt in using cleaning charms since sixth year. He supposed it wasn’t entirely out of the question. From what his Aunt Andromeda said, this place had gone to disrepair since his great aunts death, more than a decade past.
He's never confessed like Draco had to him. He's asked Cho Chang to the Yule Ball that one time. And got rejected. Ouch that had hurt. But they ended up dating a few times fifth year after the death of Cedric, her boyfriend.
Before Draco could comment, they heard the distinct whoosh of the hearth in the basement erupting in tell-tell green flames, letting them know the Floo network was open. Hari from the parlor above spoke through the Floo, “Alright, Bill. The Floo will be barred behind you.”
Sheryl reigned over her kitchen and restaurant like the Queen she was. With gold eyeliner, gold bangles that hung off ears, neck, and wrist was her signature look, along with white apron, red heels, and gleaming meat cleaver. No one, intimidated Sheryl Mason, unlike her formally named Sean Mason self. Sean Mason grew up in a little backwater town in Louisiana, where the only exciting things happened in town was Friday night high school Lacrosse games, Saturday night bowling, and Sunday morning Church.  Unlike Sheryl who wasn’t afraid of nobody, Sean was afraid of his bible thumping, heavy handed, bigoted, homophobic and abusive father, John Masson.
Right then two house-elves came hustling into the room from the stairs. Why not Apparate into the room? Well, Koako had startled Hari one too many times while he was in the kitchen, causing Hari to burn himself on the stove or drop something. Poor Koako had to punish herself after inadvertently causing harm to her master. It was agreed that the house-elves would only Apparated into a room if summoned, and Disapparate out of a room if dismissed, otherwise they had to do so outside the room and walk through the door. This also solved the issue of waking and startling Teddy from a nap.
On the other side of the door, Hari let out a shaky breath. "What the hell was that?" Hari said as he raised his fingertips to a suddenly icy-cold cheek. Draco's hand had been freezing.
“I do. A small one, just for Hari;s friends and loved ones before you return to Hogwarts. It will be good for Hari. It would do Hari good to be with his friends and loved ones. It’s been a month. This way he can ease into it, before school starts. It wouldn’t do for him to have some type of mental breakdown from too much anxiety.”
That night Hari dreamt he was walking down a dark hallway with the only source of light guiding him, a sliver of silver light spilling from the door frame in the distance.  As he walked the walls convexed outward, the ceiling shrank, and that beacon of light at the end of the hall stayed just out of reach.
“Not anymore”, Draco growled, because 'hey he only just presented he cannot be expected to control his instincts'. “You are dismissed”. If he was a little testy, it’s because his rut isn’t going to be over for another twenty-four hours. Their plan was forced to move up a whole day, but his mother was always one who thought on her feet.
“I told you, Potter it’s not a diary…” He paused in his rant when he saw Hari’s teasing smile. Huffing, he resumed searching. Hari just let Draco search. He obviously had something in mind from the amount of times Hari tried pulling shirts out only to hear Draco’s irritated, ‘not that one, the materials all wrong’, or ‘that color doesn’t suit your coloring.’
Hari snorted at the absurd response. He thought about calling him out on his bullshit. Hari knows what scars from a dragon attack looks like, bearing some of those scars himself.
“Dot, along with clothes, items of necessity, hygiene and beauty products; I need for you to collect my school supplies, Quidditch gear, and family owls. Grab any documents portraying to the Malfoy estates, the ledgers, and the vaults. Kocoa, any valuables not in the Vaults I need you to transfer them too, as long as they are not dark artifacts. All dark artifacts unidentified by the Aurors leave at the manor.” Draco instructed.
A very good thing that loose tongues could easily be tied with a handy Tongue-Tying Curse. Problem solved-now anyone who is aware of the location couldn't speak of it, if they tried.
Harry was immediately on edge and ready to bolt, but the older man did not crowd him, didn't even try to touch him. Instead, he moved behind bar counters through a swinging half door at waist level. He set to work behind a display case of pastries, croissants, breads, bagels, and sweet and savory breads. He turned his back on Harry to fiddle with something.
"Tell me Draco, who do you more look like, your mother or father?" Sheryl asked as she began setting out equipment with wires and buttons. The like Draco has never seen before. It was like she could read Draco's expression perfectly.
He landed with a soft oomph on his back, cushioned by a soft duvet and a mountain of pillows. The impact had all the breath leave his body. Hari’s body dipped as Draco added his own weight to the bed.
Draco was still there. He was still ticked off at Hari, but for now that emotion was slowly being washed away by fascination. The invisibility cloak fit his frame perfect; he didn’t need to stoop or anything. It didn’t hinder any of his senses, either. He could see around him perfectly, he could hear every word Hari said, and annoyingly enough he could smell Muggle London. He clenched the cloak tight to his body, wishing that he could make out Hari’s scent. He imagined it would be just like Hari were scenting him, the invisibility cloak like a tight embrace, engulfing him in his scent. He took a deep wistful breath, smelling only laundered cloth and the faint smell of snow.
“Ahem.” The sound of a throat clearing caused Draco and Hari to pull apart startled. Draco peeked around Hari and flushed at the sight of his mother in the doorway.
The tingling sensation had been the loss of circulation in his hands from clenching a fist too tight.
“Now Draco, don’t act like a prepubescent boy. We took precaution; it would have been disastrous, if I fell pregnant while at Hogwarts, after all. I could have been expelled or my families name tarnished. The Malfoy’s could have called off the wedding; the legitimacy of any children at stake if they thought I didn’t come to the wedding beds a virgin. ”
"Awe, Sorry Andromeda. I was going to sit down at write that letter to Kingsley, but what the goblin Chieftess said, got me wondering...so I found my birth certificate."
"No." Draco said to Hari's surprise. "Left off, actually. Like the Potter's, pure-blood. As pure as most families go. Your family wasn't on the list. For some inconsequential reason, other than the author of the list, Cantankerous Nott, didn't agree with these families policies in the Wizengamot. The Daily Prophet claims he left the Potter's off because the sur name was too Muggle. What nonsense. Like there aren't Muggles with the sur name Black.  Anyway, names were left off for trivial reasons like that." Draco actually rolled his eyes.
First a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon, named Norbert, and now a Cerberus named Fluffy. Hagrid (I finally remembered his name) is absolutely mad. When Harry jumped first down the trap door, I immediately ran back out of the corridor to get help.
“That boy makes my heart smile each and every day. I am glad that I am able to keep a piece of her with me always.” Andromeda says gently to Hari.
Draco has also been noticing some changes with his body-though he would probably only admit some of them to himself. He wasn’t going to mention to his mother, for instance, that he is increasingly aggravated all the time because his sleep patterns have been interrupted by bizarre dreams, alternating between half-memories and erotic sex dreams with one certain emerald-eyed wizard in the foreground.
Draco raised his bloody hand to his mouth, unwittingly trying to return warmth to his hand by breathing fire into his fist.
Hari was pulled from his quite observation when he heard the sound of a near inaudible titter from the terrace patio.
p.s. Chapter 2 of Pulling Strings, Behind the Scenes is finally updated and hopefully glitch free. Check it out.
kill something that is already dead. It was just a portrait, a spelled memory of the person in it. She was long in the grave, way before you even thought to cast the killing curse.”
Draco noticed that they were on the last flight of steps, and realized Hari hadn't mentioned which rooms either of them were sleeping in.
"Draco!" Hari panted out as he looked up into Draco's blown out eyes. Hari was raising onto his tiptoes when, a flash of light blinded them. Their arms raised to shield their faces from the on slot. Draco heard the tell tell clicking of a camera shutter. He growled in irritation.
A sales associate near the front nudged her colleague and nodded towards the two studs walking in the door. One was tall, lean, and blonde, while the other was shorter with wild black hair, and green eyes they could make out even from behind the register.
Balancing tremulously on one arm, he lifts the other running shaking fingers through silk fine hair behind delicate frilled ears, before getting a grip and pulling.
“I’ve rode on this thing several times,” wisely not mentioning nearly dying last summer riding sidecar, “and Sirius taught me how to ride the summer before fifth-year. It’s perfectly safe, I won’t let us crash.”
Hari had helped prepare breakfast, but Kreacher got offended when Hari said he wanted to help serve too, so Hari left it to the house-elves to serve the meal. It was nothing special just eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, and biscuits, but it was something he had been doing for the Dursley's for years, serve them breakfast. The only difference here was, no one knew he did the cooking, and he actually got to sit down and enjoy the meal with the family.
I hope he goes to Hogwarts. If not I will try to be transferred to his school. Discretely, Father would be furious if he knew I wanted to transfer only to get close to Harry Potter, he’d beat me within an inch of my life, again.
He lumbered up the walkway, not worrying about smashing trimmed grass beneath colossal feet on the edge of the paved walkway.
Kreacher was by the bar now, ears barely reaching the top of the counter, let alone seeing properly what he was doing. “I think it’s time to lift your spirits, Master Harry, Sir.” And with that declaration, he waved his hand and the bar opened to reveal an array of alcoholic beverages.
The evening went on, with Draco and Hari trading drink after drink. Both sure that they could drink the other under the table. They retired to the couch rather than the bar stools after their third, maybe fourth shot saw Draco nearly falling on his arse. Draco would not admit that happened. Least if they fell, it wouldn't be too far before their bums hit the ground. Or was Hari's reasoning, anyways.
The mood in the room was completely changed. The hostility was gone between Draco and Bill. Bill was a bit wary of Draco’s intentions. He had a feeling that Hari could be too naïve about somethings, especially Draco’s apparent attraction to him.
“You don't even know?!” Draco set down the vault key, grabbing up Hari’s hands. “You said it yourself. If they didn’t release my vault key, the Ministry vaults would be sealed and content liquidated. Brilliant, Hari.”
Draco tried, He really did. But Hari was being too seductive and he was just sitting there eating. Hari had made one request and that was that they try to eat as a family. Breakfast the morning before was a failure. The second time was just as bad. Narcissa and Andromeda, Draco and Hari sat outside on the terrace patio having a simple lunch. Draco wasn't eating, he was simply drinking in the vision before him, tousled hair, quick toothed grin, and shining green eyes.
They both watched as the bike shrunk smaller and smaller under the tight control of Hari’s magic. Hari then pocketed the bike.  They exited the street together.
“Dorea married Charlus Potter, younger brother to your arrière-grand-père, Henry Potter.” Narcissa tapped her french manicured nails to the bottom of her lip. “Though, from what I’ve been told, unfortunately, they passed away without having any children...No that is inaccurate. I remember now; they had a son who passed away from a childhood illness and Dorea, was either not able to have any more children or too heartbroken to try for another after the death of her son.” Narcissa nodded sadly able to empathize with the loss of a child while in the womb.
Hari looked over at his exclamation with a concerned frown as he set a plate of buttered toast on the table before them. Draco shook his head with a bemused smirk and offered his lips for a kiss. Spatula still in one hand, he caressed Draco’s cheek with the other to grant a brief meeting of lips.
"Drrraay!" Hari's voice brought him out of his silent musing. He still hadn't answered Hari's question.
Draco was so focused on his inner monologue, that he missed the opening speech of the Head of the Wizengamot and the Prosecutor. “Dammit, now I don’t know the names of the people who have my and my mother’s life in their hands.” As far Draco could care, his father, Lucius could rot in hell.
“Relax, we’ll get a piglet. We don’t have to do anything like eat its living brains, or heart, or drink its blood. But we do make a giant fire pit and roast ‘em.” Draco said excitedly.
“I don’t love him because he is famous! Gods mother, even you think I am that shallow.” Draco said, seriously offended.
April 2020 Update: Chapter 13 will be updated on April 20th. I hope to also have chapter 14 up at the same time. Subscribe to receive notifications about when that will be.
That was the thing Harry was most afraid of; rejection. Wanting something so much and being denied it.
"No! Sirius. It's true." Hari cried out. His emotions suddenly at the surface boiling over. "I've always found Draco attractive. I've just never admitted it to myself before tonight. I thought I liked girls, but I have always paid just a little too much attention to Draco Malfoy. I mean, he's always there. I always ha...hated him. He's always given me reasons to hate him. But I don't hate him anymore, and now he is saying all these things...that he lo...loves me." Hari stuttered over the words, having never spoken them outloud before. "No one has said that to me before. Not Cho, not Ginny, just Draco...and I liked it. His confession. It made me feel wanted. I never had that before. And you say it's because, I'm depressed, lonely, it's just a phase. Sirius, if I feel this way all the time...is it wrong?"
Hari wanted to protest, to rebroke, to pull his arm away before his arm socket was dislocated, but the sight of Draco's mask finally cracking and deep tear tracks lined his cheeks, had the words halting before they left his lips.
I dread returning home this winter holiday. I didn't do as well on this terms finals as I would have liked. Father's going to be furious that I failed him again. I've always gotten top marks before now. I came in second. It might as well be last.
“The drawing room,” A voice behind Draco murmured. He startled and peeked over his shoulder to see his mother, hunched against the wall much as he was, also eavesdropping. When he opened his mouth, Narcissa silently shushed him with a touch of fingers to her lips. Her ears, elegantly elongated with the slight manifestation of her dragon inheritance, pricked forward, listening. Draco smirked at the sight, knowing that Hari was still unaware of their inheritance giving better advantages of sight, sound, and smell…on second thought, Draco decided after taking a whiff of the smell of sour milk from baby poop, maybe smell was a disadvantage. He grimaced. His mother moved to suppress a laugh, but couldn’t hide the merriment from her eyes at his expense. He scowled at her.
"Well in any case, it would have naturally gone to you when you won all his possessions in a Wizard's duel. As for the dragon, we have wanted to get rid of the dragon as part of the Fair and Humane Treatment of Natural Born Creatures Blood Act, but as it was hatched from an egg within the Lestrange vault, it would be impossible for him to survive in the wild; plus the Lestranges refused to get rid of the dragon. The ceiling, on the other hand, you will pay for out of one of your vaults."
"WAIT! WHAT? ALL THREE?" Harry shouted as his wand movement moved so violently that instead of packing the clothes, he flung them across the room. "Andromeda, what do I do? They can't go to Azkaban. Mrs. Malfoy saved my life, and Draco...Draco...well he just can't alright."
Draco thought as he continued his agonizing and delightful exploration of Hari's body with just his fingertips.
His aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon, were very sensible, non-nonsense type of people. And in the nearly ten years that Harry Potter lived with his relatives he learned some fundamental lessons.
Harry swallowed, hesitating on entering, before turning to Andromeda, kissing Teddy once on the forehead, his hair a brilliant turquoise. He squared his shoulders and walked into the room. Inside was a room made of stone, it was cold and torches lining the room was the only source of light. Maps and scrolls lay on ever flat surface bare, jewels of untold riches acting as paperweights.
"Harry Potter! Harry Potter, Albus!" Minerva's voice was so loud it cracked in the air. "That is who I am referring to. Three letters have been sent to his place of residence and the owls have not returned to their roost in the Owlery."
Hari continued the tour from where he left out, with just Draco, Narcissa and little Teddy tagging along for the ride. He explained to Narcissa about the spectre and not being able to use the front door until the Curse Breaker could come by later that week to get rid of it, and explained the houses defences, including Ashur, and introducing them to the rest of the snakes in residence. When Hari spoke parseltongue, Draco was prepared for it this time. He noted the differences in cadence Hari had from the Dark Lord. Instead of cold and spine chilling, Hari's hissing was warm and caused a different type of tingle to go up his spine.
I don't have time to be thinking about Harry Potter when I should be focussing on my studies. But just recently I've heard the trio making plans about the off limits wing on the third floor, and something about a fluffy creature.
Draco rattled Hari's shoulders, making his head bob back and forth. "Love, stop it. Blaise was never on the Dark Lord's side. The Dark Lord would have never allowed he or his mother in, because of their creatures' blood. His mother is a succubus. He may be an Incubus, the male equivalent. I'm not worried."
Brought back to the present, Narcissa glanced briefly to her right to see her equally apprehensive seventeen year old son, taking the position of walking street side, always the gentleman. Two scarlet robed Aurors stationed as their guard, walked in front of them and behind. They were there for the Malfoy’s protection, but Narcissa was still warry of them.
The few treasures he found he stacked neatly on the writing desk to keep on hand and from losing. His father's invisibility cloak, the Marauder's map, the photo album from Hagrid, his expandable mokeskin pouch, a sneakoscope, extendable-ears, and the omnioculars from the Quidditch World Cup. Smaller items he kept on his person, like the watch Mr. Weasley gave him on his seventeenth birthday, the pocket knife from Sirius, a shard of glass from the two-way mirror that saved his life, and the first ever snitch he caught.
Hari couldn't help but agree. He never truly, celebrated Christmas until he went to Hogwarts and he loved the presents, too.
As I am currently updating this chapter to be replaced with the real chapter 13 on April 20th, I've transfered the message here. This way I am not deleting the comments left by everyone.
"you...you'd send...send Hagrid?! Into the Muggle World? He's conspicuous. He's a Half-giant for Merlin's sake!" She said with a hand over her bosom. "He never finished his schooling, he has his wand snapped. It will not be safe for him to be performing unmastered magic with a snapped wand in that pink umbrella of his, Albus. And around underage children who cannot defend themselves if something were to happen" She exclaimed loudly.
"Why what, Draco?" Hari inquired already on the stairs ready to descend. Draco held his breath once more when he heard his name being spoken by Hari for the second time, perhaps ever. When Draco didn't respond only continued to stare, Hari waved his hand in front of his face, until Draco flinched back.
"I talked with Sirius’s portrait and he told me of a place near us. It has a lot of shops and restaurant’s. I thought we’d maybe go there first.” Hari said, swinging his leg over Sirius’s old Motorbike. He snapped closed the buckle of his helmet and raised the other for Draco to grab. “Come on, hop on.” He urged.
Until then, stay at home. Every time you go out, that timer starts again and you put yourself and loved ones at risk.
Hari frowned at the memory. To this day, he preferred his meat well-done and he couldn’t even look at rare or medium rare meat, the sight of even a twinge of pink blood turning his stomach. His favorite foods were barbecue for the burnt and smoky taste.
Sheryl was loud, very loud. Draco couldn’t help but overhear what she said, and a dozen other patrons turned to face them, no doubt overheard the conversation as well. Draco fought down a blush and tried to act nonchalant, leaning back on the bike with arms crossed over chest, when the two turned to face him fully. His Malfoy mask was firmly in place, his facial featured carefully blank.  Hari was unsuccessful in doing the same. Clearly mortified, he squawked out a protest.
Draco shivered at hearing the hissing noise come from Hari's mouth, a freakish reminder of the Dark Lord talking to the giant snake that was his familiar as he walked the halls of Malfoy Manor. Draco felt the walls close in on him, he couldn't breath, he felt trapped, no way out, the hissing was getting louder, louder, there was no air.
Sputtering now, Sirius growled like a vigorous Grim, his animagus form was, “Why you insolent little…”
Draco gave a genuine smile, not his poised and superior smirk. He leant his head to bump against Hari’s and let it rest there. “That makes two of us.” Hari smiled. He liked the quiet moments. The times spent in the garden with the rich earthy smells that clung to him all day. Or the times he spent rocking Teddy, breathing in his unique baby smell. He even enjoyed the feeling of quiet drowsiness after an evening of drinking.  Everything he’s experienced since Andromeda, Narcissa, Teddy, and Draco moved in. He never had anything like this before, and he enjoyed sharing these moments with Draco. Hari needed them, Draco needed them. They were more alike than they realized.
He heard the door of the balcony open and close with a soft click the sound of soft soles descending stone steps.
It was great to get away from everything he knew and see things unexpected. Even when Vernon was spitting venom at the strange and beautiful people across the street, Hari took no notice to it, having been subject to the verbal abuse for seven years now. “Don’t let me ever catch you over here, you hear me. Especially you Freak, this place just breeds freakiness and weirdo’s like you. Homo’s the lot of them. I’ll have you out by your ear before you could even say homosexual, boy.” Uncle Vernon had often gone on these rants that to a seven year old brain had no idea what he was talking about. “Unnatural if you ask me. The downfall of civilization, the Book of Genesis talks about them. You know what those cities are called, don’t you?”
Hari looked uncomfortable. "A night club in SoHo. They offer Yas! Night. Customers perform karaoke and er...dress up."
Hari pulled himself away and Draco's arms felt empty. "I guess...I mean, sure. I've only had it once though."
Draco wasn't sleeping. He sat in the windowsill, moonlight casting over him with ethereal beauty. Light and shadows played across his face sketching cheekbones in sharp contrast. For the second time that day, Hari was enthralled by the sight of Draco Malfoy. His limbs were so long and elegant draped across each other. In adolescence he would have said Draco features were pointy; pointy nose, pointy chin, pointy ears. But know his features seem sharper. High cheekbones, a strong jawline and with high brows, gives Draco Malfoy an aristocratic look. The smug bastard would say, it’s all in the breading. His skin was flawless, pale and smooth, it glowed like alabaster in the moonlight, his hair gleamed like spun silver. Even his blasted feet where pretty; narrow feet, high arch, and long toes.
"Well...I liked the story. Thank you for sharing it with me." Hari said gently. "You're doing it again, Dray." Hari says dryly as he jostles Draco's tail away from his groin by wiggling his leg. "And you aren't doing it on purpose are you?"
"Do you...I mean will you come with me?" Draco asked suddenly uncertain. "You don't have to like, speak to him, if you don't want. But I don't want to go alone..."
“No, I understand...er, its not that. It’s just that Voldemort used my blood to revive his full body.” He felt his forearm and the ragged scar that served a reminder of his part in the resurrection of the greatest dark wizard of its time.
“Sheryl, you cannot expect him to eat so much food. If he doesn’t want the special, I’ll pay for his meal…”
Narcissa stepped out of her room at the ruckus with wand raised. She lowered it, with a disbelieving part of her lips, whispered, "Dragon?"
Draco stuffed his hands in his pockets. “I threw out a book on the Dark Arts. Father gave it to me the night before I took the Dark Mark.I had forgotten about it as it was hidden in the lining of my trunk under a
“Fantastic!” He exclaimed, “We’ll go as soon as Bill is done with the Spectre at the entrance. Dray, be a dear, and show Bill the way.” And like a deer caught in the headlights, he froze. He really didn’t want to be alone with Bill Weasley. But if he said that, Hari would be annoyed. He would make Bill wait, and that meant Bill was in what he considered his territory with his unfamiliar alpha stink. Draco’s upper lip curled. Fine, he’s do it; only because he wanted Bill away from Hari and gone from the house sooner.
Before Hari could let out another complaint, they were escorted out through the kitchen and back alley, which it shared with a neighboring Salon.
The Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire, England was located among acres of forested land that had been in the Malfoy name for ten centuries. The original land-grant that the Manor now sat upon; was granted by the Muggle William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, and the first Norman King of England during the eleventh century C.E. The Malfoy’s always prided themselves on their connections to Muggle British aristocracy and royally, many of their antique treasures and wealth came from numerous magical deeds and misdeeds performed for them. In the years following the Norman Invasion, many of the acreage surrounding the Manor expanded due to the annexation of land belonging to neighboring Muggles.
Andromeda didn't say anything, she just briefly closed her eyes, then opened them on a snort and felt a wide wild smile grow on her face. She thought to herself, 'If I had to be indebted to someone, at least it's to someone unpredictable and definitely not boring, like Harry Potter.' Squeezing his shoulder once in silent support, leading him the rest of the way to the Head Clerks desk.
Many security measures are put in place to keep out would be thieves. For the lower security vaults a simple key is required. Medium security Vaults require a goblin to open the vault and if anyone other than a goblin tries to open the vault they would be sucked in. Higher security vaults require a goblin to open the door and may have a powerful creatures guarding the entrance, like Dragons or Sphinxes. They could also have a multitude of enchantments placed on the items inside the vaults, like the
Andromeda Tonks née Black was at her wits end. Edward Remus Lupin, or more affectionately nicknamed Teddy, after her own late husband wouldn't stop screaming. The Muggle neighbors would surely hear and start coming over to offer assistance. They were very caring people, but Andromeda could not handle another hassle at the moment. Teddy was only a month old, although having not contracted the Werewolf gene from his father, he clearly took after her own daughter, Nymphadora, a metamorphmagus. His tiny head of hair was currently changing from a sickly green to an angry red, and Andromeda didn't know what was wrong with him.
In that moment Hari was annoyed with himself for thinking Draco was stunning, he had always been annoyingly enough, haughty good looking. Hari was always able to pick him out of a crowd of over a hundred students just by his signature white-blonde hair. He didn’t understand his sudden reaction to the blonde now. He knew the wizard since adolescence. He could still see the slim boy from the robe shop with sleek, perfectly styled platinum blonde hair, pointy features, and haughty attitude that grated against his nerves from day one.
I do not know what I did, but father was not pleased with me for some reason. Did he somehow know, suspect? I thought at first that Crabbe or Goyle squealed on me for some reason, or I let my mask slip during the game, but no.
She spoke in a dead voice, void of emotion, “I was told constantly that I was a failure as a wife, because I couldn’t even perform my duties properly. It took me years to conceive, as female alphas tend to do. That wasn’t an excuse; I was forced to endure a loveless coupling each time. I might as well have been raped. I’d finally conceive but then I’d lose the baby each time. One time…one time I made it to the eighth month and suddenly I couldn’t feel my precious baby moving anymore-I couldn’t feel them moving. The mediwizard made me carry the dead baby around until I passed the baby naturally; they said if they removed the fetus magically, I might never conceive again. I had no say over my body. I was the property of my husband. Until you were born healthy and hail, if premature, I didn’t rejoin society. I couldn’t.”
"Oh pooh!" Sheryl exclaimed. "You could have pulled off that look ten times better." She said to Draco. " I would have seen to that."
"No, no no." Sheryl on Hari's other side heard the question and answered. "They were role playing. Spicing up the excitement in the bedroom, by pretending to be strangers."
"Shut up, you little freak!" She hissed in his face before slamming the door in his pale and gaunt face, and locked it from the outside.
"Shhh, Master sirs, you go get new Young Master in the morning, Kreacher will get rooms ready for Andromeda...," Either Kreacher was mumbling again or Harry was blacking out, but Harry could no longer focus on what Kreacher was saying as he hopped around the room, cleaning up dirty glasses, 'did he really drink that much?' and straightening the liquor cabinet behind the bar.
I am taking a little break from SCES, while the other part of this series is put together between Q and I. I did say that was going to happen in my announcement months ago. Both of us have been very busy with life in general.
“No, thank you. I won’t need any help. My boyfriend has the best taste in just about everything. Isn’t that right, Dray Bae?” Hari blurted out with more confidence than he felt. At that Draco looked up startled and Candice blanched.
As Draco continued on, Hari hurried between traffic. The bell above the door jingled when he entered. The tanned man over the counter said welcome and Hari nodded in greeting before perusing the aisles for something he thought Draco would like. Had Draco ever had Muggle snacks before?
"Wicked!" Was all he said as he stepped out of the floo soot fireplace, now flameless like it was heatless; straightened his color and glasses in a centered and upright position, and walked out of the doors.
Draco groaned, remembering what was to happen next. Hari looked uneasily before the three relatives. “Wh...what is it?”
A wailing sound echoed on the stone stairs, catching their attention. Eliana ruffled her feathers and abandoned Hari’s soft scratches to sit above the pans. Kokoa huffed in irritation at the unsanitariness of having an owl on the pots she used to cook with.
Did he not realize that if he kept walking he wouldn’t get trapped? Did he want to make an entrance, pausing in the entrance to add dramatics, and guarantee the people in the pub would notice him? Draco saw Hari tense in front of him, bracing for the tidal wave of admirers who eagerly awaited their heroes return. Draco sneered. The sneer covering up how he really felt. He was jealous of all these people clambering for his secret crushes attention. He watched as one tiny wizard in a horrible orange hat, jumped on the bar,
Arlys dragged two covered carts with either hands into salon from the narrow back door and pushed one cart towards her station in front of Hari that C'iemone easily caught, and then handed off another to Sheryl. "
Hari was a minor unpresented and thus he couldn’t detect pheromones and individuals unique scents, and his own scent was masked by the hereditary curse of
12 Grimmauld Place is a full house with Andromeda and Teddy, Narcissa and Draco, and Hari living together. This is one bizarre family. Also, Draco's still in his pre-rut stages as it is his first rut. All he wants to do is lock himself in his room... with Hari, until it his pre-rut is through. Poor Draco!
Draco didn’t rebuff the statement of fact. Instead he inquired about how he got around the Ministry’s red tape.
Dare he say, Hari looked aroused. Taking a subtle whiff of Hari’s neck, he smelt the ever present smell of snow, but beneath it, Draco could just make out the heady sweet smell of Hari’s arousal. It sparked something in Draco and his dragon yearned for a mate, for Hari, and his alpha’s instinct was urging him on;
Harry didn't know what to say. He walked in the wake of Trout, uncertain as he was being lead to an unknown destination.
The simple answer is that they only have one source of income and seven children. Molly Weasley is a fulltime housewife and Arthur Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic in the office for Misuse of Muggle Artifacts. (I am estimating he makes between 2000-3000 galleons minimum annually. Having seven children has to factor into it as well. All seven children will have to go through seven years of schooling. Although tuition is never mentioned for Hogwarts, I imagine it would be very expensive to attend. We know that every student must purchase their own textbooks. And okay, maybe they can share some books, but not all. The booklist appears to change with each new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, at least. Remember Gilderoy lockhart? He had seven "autobiographies". Percy, Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny were at Hogwarts during Chamber of Secrets.
Blaise straightened, his smile shifted radiance and he spun to meet his friend with a bone crushing hug and heavy beats on his back, clasped his forearm and shoulder. In commodity, Draco did the same with a genuine smile. He's been doing more of that lately.
The ancestral home for the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black is located inconspicuously in the muggle neighborhood in the Borough of Islington, London a few short blocks from Kings Cross Station.
Hari's whole body tensed. He was about to defend one of his best friends, when Draco tapped his tail against his thigh, an aggravated tap, tap, tap. "Sorry, its just nothing against, Granger, herself. Its just, she wanted to get rid of the house-elves at Hogwarts. Free them, as she says, from slavery. But Hari, they were not slaves. They were dependent on our magic to survive. The largest pool of magic in the U.K and she wanted to expel them from the castle. And that ridiculous name, S.P.E.W. And many people tried to explain this to her, but she wouldn't hear of it."
Draco felt an inner turmoil. Once he let Hari go, they would return to two separate beings, and all the uncertainty would still remain.
“I’ve taken art as an extracurricular since third year. Mother encouraged it…” He paused a beat. “Father had no idea.”
It was a spacious room, large archways and glass doors and windows giving the room an open feeling. Against the south facing wall was a large four cushion couch. Above the couch was a large gray scheme landscape, featuring a crystal clear lake that reflected the sky above and snowy mountains. Against the north facing wall an large desk sat in one corner and in the opposite corner, an even larger bar. In front of the couch was a coffee table made of the same wood as the rest of the room, with matching end tables. Beautifully decorated gas lamp with bases of rich bronze and shapes of tempered glass in an array of colors from ambers to brown and yellow topaz, and turquoises to aquamarines, sat atop each end table and upon the desk. The glass shades matched the colors in the crystal chandelier above the bar.
Hagrid took that as his cue to leave the disgusting cookie cutter neighborhood. He pulled out a ruffled feathered tiny owl from one of his many pockets and searched for ink and paper.
The occupants were so different from the wixen parlours his father, Lucious Malfoy, sometimes allowed him to accompany while on business. Three elder witches sat at the corner table drinking sherry glasses, one of them contributing to the haze in the room, smoking from a long pike that expelled green smoke. At a large table, wild looking warlocks talking with raucous dwarfs and wizards arguing over the latest scholarly article of
“You were riding as if death was chasing us. I couldn’t retrace our path, if I tried.” Draco replied, craning his neck to look around.
How was Draco going to get by without a wand? How was he to return to school in the autumn only a few short months from now? How was he going to handle his peers, his course work, and his creatures’ Inheritance?
Hari was definitely regretting wanting to confide in Sirius now. He squirmed beneath his godfather's gaze. "You know…for me…" He trailed off.
“Show me what to do.” Harry said, as he clenched the lifeless form of Kreacher closer. In answer the snake unwound from the banister seamlessly and wound itself around Harry’s arm to rest its head on Kreacher’s shoulder. Harry listened to the lilted hisses of Asclepius with rapt attention as he continued to give instructions in parseltongue.
Before Draco could say anything, Hari had a look of confusion on his face. "The wife was the person who wrote the ad in the paper that he responded to. So she had plans to cheat first, right?"
Harry Potter returns to Grimmauld Place a couple weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts. What surprises await him at this grim old place?
"Alright, yeah. If you have any questions, I'll just be...here." And so without prompting Draco settled his head back on Hari's shoulder as Hari read on and once more carding his hands through Draco's silken hair. Draco relaxed into each stroke and began to hum, a deep crooning noise in his throat. The sound having Hari pause. When he stilled his hand, the humming stopped, and when Hari continued the crooning continued. Hari grinned, settled back, and read on.
Draco moved immediately to his wardrobe, a handsome dark wood affair with stained glass in the doors. The enchanted dragon moved as he approached; the glass illuminated by unseen light to reveal a crescent moon in a starlit blue sky. Emerald green and pale rose wrapped in vines around the white and lavender dragon. It wasn’t an Opal-Eye, but it would do.
Draco must resemble a corpse, because when Alleycat hissed back in an unmistakable cadence of paseltongue, the language of serpents. Hissing passed back and forth between the reptile and wizard, before the wizard looked suddenly concerned at Draco.
, and marveled at the state of his hand. Blood flowed freely from four deep furrows in his palm, gorged out by his own sharp talons. Before Hari had arrived he had been lost in a daydream; fantasizing while he let his inner dragon out to explore his senses while locked safely in his room. Something he hadn't had the opportunity to do when he first arrived. His mother would be his guide to master his new found powers, and control his instincts in constant battle inside his conscious. Today could have been very bad indeed. First with Weasley, the alpha Curse-Breaker, and then the crowds in Diagon Alley and later the streets of Muggle London.  Although, not caught within the throes of his rut, his dragon was in control when the person of his every fantasy stepping into his dragon's lair.
Draco eyes popped open wide in incredulous before narrowing. His thick eyelashes shaded over grey. “You do with me.” Draco knew he sounded like a hypocrite for all the times he’s asked, begged, and demanded kisses of his own from Hari over the past several days.
Draco jammed his pointer and middle finger into Potter’s hole to the last knuckle, ruthlessly. Potter’s back arched off the wet tiles, breathing in on a breathless scream, “huh-ahg!” Draco pulled his fingers out again, before just as with his tongue, jabbed them in as hard and far as he could. Potter was groaning and whimpering in protest, “nnh, ugg, no, no!” Draco opened and closed his fingers, scissoring his fingers around, before curling them, searching, searching…
“I suppose then, I will be arranging a meeting with the Greengrasses to dissolve your marriage contract. We will of course, need to come to some type of settlement for the breach of marriage contract”
My mother has a heart and lung condition, she got a respiratory infection in November, and still has not recovered strength-wise from. I am her homecare provider. I cook, clean, do laundry. Grocery shop, the whole nine yard.
Now he is saying my godfather, Severus is trying to get "the stone" whatever that is, and get passed "Fluffy." is that some kind of guard dog. No. Severus would never steal from Dumbledore. They must be mistaken about the would-be-perpetrator.
When he woke up the next morning they were gone and had thought he was caught after all but no one said anything. That day he was a nervous wreck waiting to get ambushed or humiliated by the other students, but it never came. He went to bed uneasily that night and by morning his pants and pajama bottoms were returned freshly laundered and stainfree.  Crisis avoided.
With a bruising and sharp nailed grip, she marched Harry to his broom cupboard where Harry slept for a room. She ignored the small voice proclaiming his innocence.
Cho reeled back, and frantically looked between he and Dudley. A hand rose to her lips in a silent 'Oh'.
“Why? Mr. and Mrs. Weasley didn’t teach their children such things. Ron couldn’t perform spells before Hogwarts, and Mrs. Weasley was the one who insisted on no magic.”
Harry is staying over break. Doesn't he want to go home, sleep in his own room, and in his own bed, instead of these crappy springboard mattresses in the dorms? Or is that where the abuse happens?
"Make it move!" Dudley demanded snottily to his father. Uncle Vernon in turn huffed out a breath beneath his massive mustache, rapping his own knuckles against the glass and then said very loudly, "MOVE!"
"Hi Fleur, thank you for all you have done for me, this last year." Harry replied before turning his attention to the paperwork at hand.
"Hari, you have to understand. Families were dying out at an alarming rate with no male heirs to pass on the names anymore. Circe, with all the different fractions we have today, they still are and those that adapt so their family lines don't die out, are written off. In the case of the Black's; blasted off. Look, you've seen the
Shutting the vent on the door of the cupboard that his nephew was locked in with a sharp snap of the wrist, he said gruffly, "Let's go! Don't want to be too late."
Hari rubbed his eyes with open palmed frustration beneath his glasses. "Alright, so there are different factions of pure-blood. Those whom embrace creatures' blood and those who reject it."
Narcissa was waiting for him at the entrance of the Manor, several trunks protected by fire retardant shields floating by her side with the aid of house-elf magic. This was all planned out, well they were supposed to burn down the Manor as they left, not rushing out due to Draco not being able to control his body. Narcissa hugged her son none the less, sensing his distress levels and said “Don't worry about what cannot by undone. We are ready, non? Oh, mon petit dragon, you are handsome” Draco grew a few more inches in height, his features became sharper-if that was even possible with his already pointy features, and his hair grew in length to brush his shoulders. As planned, they walked out of the Manor together, three trunks in front, two behind, with two house-elves in toe.
It was everything else that bewildered him. Hari thought necessity had made him a minimalist. He’d lived in a cupboard for the first half of his life after all, and the second was spent living out of his trunk and travelling back and forth from Scotland to Surrey before going on the run just last year. But the amount of stuff scattered over every surface clearly argued to the contrary.
Hari heard the sound Draco made, and glanced up at him. He noticed that Draco was staring at him, still not finished applying some type of lotion to his arms. Annoyed that Draco was still not ready, and now had the nerve to laugh at him. He spat out his toothpaste from his mouth, rinsing it and the sink, giving the faucet and the mirror a quick scrub down. "Hurry up princess, I am making breakfast that will be done in twenty minutes, we have a guest arriving within the hour, and your mother said you have been without a wand since the battle of Hogwarts, so we are going to Ollivanders to get new wands today. Meet me in the kitchen. Unless you'd rather sulk in your room for another day, that is." Hari said a bit testidly as he swept away from the vanity, quickly getting clothes on with still damp skin, and left the bathroom, in less than fifteen minutes than he first came in.
"He attacked my son, Marge and put your brother in jail. He is a delinquent freak and needs to be locked up for good. Can you arrange that?" She was saying. Harry was frozen with shock.
“Until we drop, it is.” Hari said only minutely worried. His feet would wear out faster than the limit on his credit card.  “All clear?” he said to Draco.
“Now that the criminal charges have been read to all the accussed, let us move on. How do you plead, Lucius Malfoy?”
"Do you want to have a drink?" Hari suddenly blurted out louder than expected with his face flushed a burning red.
"He's only six years old...about the same age as my sister was when she started to show her Mmm..." Petunia cut off before she nearly said the 'm' word in front of her husband. "He can learn to control it..." At her husbands look, she changed her story. "We'll squash it out of him...eventually."
As each passed the altar, they took a long candle. Hari grabbed a blue candle with a faint glowing rune he couldn’t decipher. Draco chose red, Andromada green, and Narcissa yellow. When they stopped they each returned to their original trio of rings. Hari faced west, Draco faced north, Andromeda with Teddy faced south, and Narcissa, east.
He didn’t have wet dreams often and became awfully flustered as to what to do with his morning wood. The fear of being caught jacking off at the Dursley’s still sent a cold sweat down his spine.
Hauling the startled boy out the door and down the hall to the broom cupboard, she opened the door, pulled the string on the light above, and placed the boy on the carpeted floor next to the old broom and mop. She then closed the door. Only then did Harry begin to cry.
Learning to navigate between alpha-omega dynamics could be problematic for the Eighth year students interacting with the rest of the school. Twenty-five percent will have some form of a manifestation of their creatures’ inheritance and guided by their instincts. Twenty percent would be alphas; highly temperamental, aggressive, and possessive. The other five percent would be omegas; normally gracious, seductive, and protective. Two different dynamics, two different temperaments, yin and yang; yet add an alpha in rut or an omega in heat-chaos will ensure.
"pfft. Admire. Obsess. Love." Draco replied in a sleep muffled voice, his body heavy against Hari's.
Hari often waved off unwanted advances, taking none of them serious. In the wizarding world many people flocked to his side because he was famous, but had nothing to offer in the Muggle world.  So he took none of the advances seriously, figuring they were either teasing him or using him as practice to flirt. What Hari couldn’t see about himself was that he was an enigma to hopeful suitors; silent and withdrawn at times, but when drawn out of his shell was witty, and his laugh always came out a bit startled, as if surprised that he could laugh.
Only then did Draco let go of Hari’s hand and wrapped it around the shaft of Hari’s erect penis, mouth suctioned over the erect head,
Hari slotted his knee between Draco's and his hard cock rubbed against his blessed-and cursed limp own. Hari moaned as he began fronting against Draco. Draco groaned at the filling. Although his extremities were going numb, he enjoyed to intimacy.
"Tell me." And Harry did. He told Andromeda about going on the hunt. How the Newspapers were spreading false rumors about him actually running away while people died pointlessly, when in fact he was trying to save them all. He explained turning away Remus's help after Bill and Fluer's wedding, how he called Remus a coward for even thinking of abandoning his wife and unborn child. He told how he was camping in the woods with Hermione and Ron, protected under wards and enchantments and coming across Ted Tonks, Dean Thomas, Dirk Cresswell, and two Goblins by the names of Griphook and Gornuk in March of 1998. Ted Tonks defending his honor to his four companions. How Harry had accidentally spoken Voldemort's name and  broken the taboo, sending Snatchers after them all. How her husband, Cresswell, and Gornuk had been killed trying to resist, and how the rest of them were captured. He cried as he told her about after their escape, Remus showing up at Shell Cottage in April, forgiving his outburst, and told him about the birth of his son and that he named Harry Teddy's godfather. Then about the Battle of Hogwarts in May and not being there to know how they died, only seeing them after the fact. He expressed his regrets, and his sorrow, and grief in wave after wave of tears and 'I'm sorry's'.
"BOY!" Her husband scream from the upstairs bedroom that shook the floorboards. Before she heard the sound of his heavy tread on the ceiling.
And the attraction was undisputedly there. Draco just had this magnetism that drew Hari in. He hadn’t lied to Sirius when he told him so. Even at Hogwarts, whenever they collided there had been this explosive spark between them. Could he have misinterpreted hatred for attraction this entire time? If things had been different would this have been the natural progression in their relationship from friends to…boyfriends? Hari had to shake that thought out of his head; one date did not equate
"Yes, yes." Sheryl clapped her hands impatiently and twisted her wrist to took at the time on the little oval surface. "If we don't call a cab soon, we'll miss the first rounds Karaoke on the sign in sheet."
- on Dudley's face. He couldn't help but remember the times he teased Hari with food, the table scraps he was allowed, the forced diet already on top of food scarcity.
He usually wakes up early enough to sit back in his pillows with a cup of hot tea with raspberry jam, or if he is feeling particularly indulgent, hot chocolate. While he enjoys his hot beverage he usually writes in his journal. This mornings hangover, being no exception. Head pounding he reached for his journal that he usually keeps beneath the pillow next to his head, feeling nothing there, he opens his eyes in confusion. Peering beneath the pillow, nothing. He lifts the other twelve pillows, still nothing. Hanging his head over the side of the bed, nope not there. Feeling by the baseboard; nothing. In a panic, Draco scrambles out of bed to fling the duvet back.
"You told her about me? Why?" It was Hari's turn to reel back. Hardly anyone knew about his abusive upbringing.
Draco was grinning as his eyes devoured the content of the letter in hand. That grin bloomed into a full toothed smile and his teeth flashed white as he actually chortled. “It appears that the chieftess has seen it fit to return my vault key. Ministry investigation be damned.”
His dragon had decided that Hari was his and an outside alpha was not going to expel him from his own territory. The only person to do that would be Hari.

It had only been a few short days since he’d even thought of dating another bloke. He hadn’t been attracted to Ron or any of his other dorm-mates.  He’d always been attracted to girls…and Draco. He admitted grudgingly to himself.
Draco's mouth was pinched in pain, face ashen, and his startled eyes were red and swollen. Hari noticed Draco uselessly try to pull a long white sleeve down his arm. Hari's eyes widened at the sight of blood seeping through the sleeve ineffectually concealing a cut.
The blood slowly draining from his face as he realized that Justin-Fucking-Finch-Fletchley had just taken a picture of them, snogging in a Muggle gay club, dressed in drag. They were about to be outed.
However, there were those few times he had the misfortune of being seen with a morning erection he couldn’t get rid of in time. On those days he had to endure the disgusted glares and scathing remarks from his aunt and uncle.
Lily Potter née Evans was the only witch born to a non-magical family. Muggle as those...people...no those wizardkind called normal people, such as herself. And her husband. And no doubt her perfect son.

"Ssssssh. If I remove my hand, will you scream?" Draco glared harder over the hand. An elbow was jammed into his throat making him gag. "Will you?" Draco nodded, before shaking his head in a negative affirmative to his answer. The pressure stayed on his throat for a moment longer, as green eyes narrowed into his. Nodding to himself, the boy released Draco.
But when Draco looked over Hari’s head at Bill, he wanted to die. The older alpha could smell his reaction to Hari’s words, as his pheromones wafted into the confined space of the Kitchen, his scent blockers not enough to hide his pheromones. Draco blushed. The blush burning his cheeks so hot, he feared his blood would permanently stain his cheeks red.  He definitely did not want a
When he opened his eyes again, two hands moved in his peripheral vision as they smoothed his hair flat and moved his head from side from side, then pulled it all back tight enough that his brows lifted.
Draco couldn't help the scowl on his face. Right now, his father was looking back at him in the mirror and he hated it.
He glanced over at the trio of tables in a cluster, that Hari agreed to wait for him and saw that Hari was no longer alone.
ore commonly referred to as accidental magic, as it was usually only seen in small children before they were given a wand and taught to control it.
Draco glanced up at Hari, placing a hand over Hari’s own. “Don’t be. My father was long dead before he received the kiss.” Draco said with hard eyes that soften only for Hari. Draco ducked his head to kiss Hari’s knuckles.
I tried, on the train. I offered my hand. I told him the Weasley's were the wrong sort and that Harry shouldn’t be associated with them. He’d be an outcast from pure-blood circles in no time.
Draco bit back a retort. Inside he fumed that Hari seemed to encourage the Muggle instead of turning her away. Trying to draw Hari’s attention back to him as civilly as possible with his dragon growling non stop in his head, he asked tightly. “If the Muggles don’t have tailors on hand, how can you get an accurate fit?”
They all threw back the shots as one. Hari coughed immediately, "What is that?" The liquor was colorless like water.
The final weeks of June brought many changes to the occupants of 12 Grimmauld Place, beginning with a flurry of owls. The morning began like any other, with Narcissa, Andromeda, and Draco sitting around the head of the table in the kitchen and Hari at the stove. Narcissa and Andromeda were easily sipping at their tea, chatting while Draco’s own tea sat in his hand going cold and untouched whilst he watched as Hari danced around the kitchen--literally.
At first they made a selection of sizes, because something about Muggle made products couldn’t be adjusted magically for size, they made their way to the fitting room. Draco was looking forward to this part the most-Hari parading around in front of him half-naked.
"You hadn't shown me your dragon since Litha. Where you...where you...er...scenting me?" Hari hesitantly asked.
Andromeda decided to let her own instincts guide her. Taking a deep breath in and letting the scent linger in her lungs, before letting it out. He wasn't lying, didn't smell aggressive, just apprehensive. Trusting her instincts, she took a chance and took the nervous boy by the hand. "The worse thing I could do is say no Harry Potter. Just tell me.
He couldn’t talk to Ron about it, because Hari knew him to be homophobic. Besides, he hates Draco Malfoy more than I do. Hermione? No, even if he could get in touch with her all the way in Australia, and he knows she would have sound advice, his two best friends were a 'thing' now, and wasn’t it a 'thing' when you were in a 'thing; to tell each other everything?  On a long suffering sign, he sat up from the bed and he put his head in his hands.
"We were offered a more secure place to stay, more protection than the villa. At the old Black Estate you could say. Though, it hadn't been occupied in many years, the new owner offered us sanctuary." Draco said, fondness softening his eyes.
Hari seeing that Bill wasn’t looking at him but over his shoulder at Draco, who he believed with no doubt was silently taunting him. He’ll lay into Draco later. Bill was his friend, he wasn’t going break all ties with him over something that he very much wanted to keep in the past. It was time to drill his point home. Snapped his fingers in Bills face to get his attention once more. “Again what about Teddy, doesn’t he deserve a bit of normalcy, doesn’t he deserve to have a family? Remus made me Teddy’s godfather, which makes him my family. Narcissa and Draco Malfoy are Teddy’s only other living relatives beside his grandmother. They are his family. They have every right to be in his life as I.” Hari leaned heavily on this guilt card. He had to put an end to this; all Malfoy’s are evil, nonsense. Bills anger was slowly dispersing, Hari could see that, but he had let Bill know that he didn’t want to hear any more of this argument. So he’d address all points.
Right, suddenly Harry remembered that in second year, the class had learned how to get rid of Doxies and wondered why no one had thought to do this before. Gingerly, Harry placed Kreacher on the same sofa cushions Hermione had slept on when the three of them were on the run. He stood up straight, turned to face the two large East facing windows that overlooked the streets of Muggle London, drew the Hawthorn and Unicorn hair wand from the wrist holster, took a breath and began eradicating some pests.
“Yes, he’d won't be so absorbed into your web of lies and deceit,  when I tell him that you would defile his bedding with your juvenile, premature ejaculation. Stop your pursuit of my Godson, leave his house and never return, you murderous, evil, poor excuse for swine snot.”
Narcissa took an unwavering step closer to the high burning flames. Clutching the scroll to her bosom in a white knuckled grip before with a strangled gasp she threw it into the fire. The parchment incinerates immediately, leaving not even an ash.
“Oh yes. Nymphadora went to Hogwarts with them. They were so bright, Prefects and Head Boys, the two of them. Although, Charlie preferred Quidditch to studying, he passed with Exceeds Expectations on most of his OWLs and NEWTS, even received Outstanding on his Care of Magical Creatures examinations.” Andromeda was saying.
The twinkle behind Albus' half-moon spectacles has vanished, the finger let go his beard and the corkscrew curl bounced out of place.
Harry froze like a deer in the headlights before the owner, or perhaps just an employee opening the shop for the day. He stood in the open doorway with a scowl on his face, his tawny hair pulled back in a stubby tail, and whiskers graced his cheeks in a darker shade of stubble. Around his front an apron with the shops name on it.
Draco was starving, exhausted, and his hand hurt. Rut season could be fun if you had a partner, or so he's been told; however, by himself with the object of his desire just right next door and frustratingly unavailable, his rut was just torture.
Hari only flushed red and stammered out a weak, “thanks.”  Draco stared her down with narrowed eyes, until Hari nudged him and shuffled along to a rack of men’s jeans. He moved about a few hangers. He toyed with little white rectangles he assumed where price-tags, but with a lot more writing on them. “Help me look, would ya?”
Tilting his head to the side in thought, Kreacher pondered the question. Thinking out loud, before raising his voice in certainty, he said, “Awe, well Mistress Walburga liked…Sherry and Regulus’s liked… Port.  Hmmm, Sirius ran away so young, but I found alcohol in his rooms once or twice. That Sirius sir. Always the rebel, that one. Preferred Whiskey. American Bourbon to be exact.”
to doise his veins and put out the flames of his desire. Stroking himself between his clothes, Draco was just about to pull the throbbing length of his member, when a sound had him freezing.
Hari stood on tiptoe to deliver a quick peck to Draco’s said and very pointy nose. “Yes it is. Let’s come inside before the statis charm breaks on the gelato.”
“I don’t have any money on me ma’am, but thank you.” Hari tried to humbly decline the request. It was true he didn’t carry Muggle money on him or else the Dursley’s would demand where the money came from and try to steal it.
Mrs. Malfoy put her life on the line and betrayed her own pure-blood believes in order to save her son. Some might tack that on to being a self-preserving, cunning, and ambitious Slytherin, but not I. In the end, she did the right thing in the moment that mattered most; she saved my life. What she did was extremely brave and that makes her a hero in my eyes.
Hari looked anywhere but at those intense grey eyes. Deciding deceit was more than likely unacceptable, he decided on a half-truth. “Well, I...you...you were in it.”
p.s. I won't be able to see Harry play Quidditch until, his team plays off against Hufflepuff in March, and then Ravenclaw at the end of May.
He paused on the third floor landing, trying to recall if the door to the toilet on their floor had been closed. Deciding
Mildly ashamed of that gimmick in his aldulence, he huntched his shoulders. "Yeah...sorry!" Draco apologized for the first time to Hari and meant it.
“He’s a Malfoy, a Death Eater, and not to be trusted. Look what his kind did to me?”  Bill said angrily gesturing violently at the side of his face. Behind Hari’s back Draco flinched. His own talons didn’t cause the scars that marred William Weasley’s otherwise handsome face, but he felt responsible. He made it possible for the other Death Eaters to come into the Castle. Fenrir Greyback entered Hogwarts, attacked Bill and left him horribly scared.
Hari was in a good mood as he skipped down the stairs to see the progress Bill had made on getting rid of Mad-Eyes booby-trap.  Draco was sitting down at the bottom step, immaculately clean, while Bill was just covered in dust. Hari joined Draco at the bottom step. Bill turned around and Hari had to hold onto Draco’s shoulders tight as he burst into wild gales of laughter, tears streaming down his face from laughing so hard. Bill looked like a dust spectre himself, gray dust clung to him everywhere, red hair was barely visible and blue eyes stared shocked. Draco just sat there smirking, happy to have Hari clutching him close.
Draco mainly focussed his lips and tongue on Hari’s head and weeping slit, or the glands beneath the hood of his foreskin. While his hand pumped, and thumb played with the thick veins along the side of his shaft.
Draco managed to hear the rest of the semi-private conversation. “Third year I blew up one of my aunt’s like a balloon because she called my mother a bitch. The only reason I didn’t get expelled was because my godfather was believed to want me murdered. Then before fifth year, Dementors attacked and I was forced to use a Patronus Charm in front of my cousin who nearly had his soul sucked out. I actually had a trial for that. It made the front page and everything. Anything in the paper’s that year was used to slander my name.”
The lines tightened painfully around Hari’s arms. Letting out a long breath, “I so swear.” The lines flashed blue briefly and settled back to the white colour. The pressure loosened significantly.
“We will be right with you, Mr. Hari Potter, sir.” One of them responded, before quickly turning her gaze to Draco. “I am sorry, you’ll have to take your business elsewhere, and we have more urgent matters to attend to.” One of the cousins, Draco didn’t bother asking for an introduction, focused her eyes on Hari. Hari’s eyes widened incredulously as she winked suggestively at Hari.
Hari sighed, “Okay a kiss on the lips in exchange for you letting me read your journal. I'll return it at breakfast."
As they reentered the drawing room, Hari heard Draco say with conviction, “Hari will not like that idea t’all.”
Potter snarled between clenched teeth, “Malfoy, what the feck do you think you are doing?” Potter struggled with his bindings, twisting to and fro only succeeding in adding delicious friction to a dick already painfully hard. Red blossomed in Draco’s cheeks and his eyes glazed over in passion. Potter stilled in his struggles, eyes going wide. “You…” He trailed off glancing down at the hardness pressed against his own flaccid penis. Draco watched Potter’s Adam’s apple bob, his slim throat constrict then loosen as he gulped.
"Oh, Cub. We are going to change that, tonight!" Their gang cheered and made their way up the stairs.
He had a great big shaggy beard, hands the size of dinner plates, and feet a large as a two medium sized dogs. His worn leather pants had patches, and his absolutely humongous fur coat had the half-giant standing out like a sore thumb in the neat and tiny street of Privet Drive.
It was C'iemone who answered. "Shortly after eight the first round Queens take the stage. The sign in sheet is available at the DJ booth. Throughout the night, there'll be say four or five rounds or sets, 5 slots per set, and only one slot per person or group. No repeats allowed.  Each singer is ranked first in their set between 1 and 5. First place gets a free tab for two and some kind of discount."
Sheryl tilted her head a bit and tapped a finger to her scarlet lips in thought. Despite the haughty exterior, she knew what it was like to have disapproving parents.
She once more managed to embarrass her son in front of Hari by saying, "Well I will just have to settle for spoiling my grand-nephew until, my Dragon here settles down and gives me grandchildren."
Hari stood for only a moment, stunned silent, wet hair dripping into startled wide green eyes, and glasses barely perched on his nose. Draco waited a heartbeat, then another, thinking perhaps he took the jest too far and Hari might be angry, then…
Harry stood at the door now fully open, he had his hip cocked, and chin raised high, he didn't have much height on himself, but he managed to give the impression of looking down at the men intruding on them.
“I will be treating today; Draco’s wallet is currently empty.” This topic galled Draco to no end. He would love nothing more than to lavish Hari with expensive gifts, fine clothing, and affection. His alpha wanting to spoil his sought after mate.
Hari’s heart stuttered and his mouth gaped. “Flirting with me?” Hari squeaked out. “I hadn’t realized…You sure? I mean, look at me. I’m… just Hari.” Hari exclaimed gesturing at himself.
"There is nothing stopping you." Aryls said already standing with an embarrassed belch that caught her off guard. "Oops, sorry. I don't think my Ginny went well with the greasy food."
Draco bit his lip, torn between keeping his tearing eyes closed and attempting to peek at Hari. In the end, the pain kept him where he sat, while either Alice or Sheryl wiped his eyes.
“That’s all. You simply wrote to the Ministry’s Financial Affairs and Goblins Liaison Offices, and simply what?...arranged to have my gold returned, just like that?!” Draco said with a barely controlled laugh.
"Like or dislike is not an issue here, Andromeda. He is a teenager, same as I, his thoughts and actions influenced by the people around him. He grew up in a house raised on prejustice pure-blood beliefs. I bet he hasn't even visited the muggle world, let alone be allowed to form his own opinion with parents like that."
Winston, the bouncer simply unhooked the velvet ropes and allowed Sheryl and her entourage to follow in her wake. Once through the entrance, Draco and the rest of the gang discovered that the club had three levels. The entrance opened out onto a narrow railed metal staircase that they could follow down into the mash pit of bodies dancing near the stage, or go up a level to private booths. On their level was the bar and a scattering of smaller intimate two or three people tables.
Relaxing back in his chair, but never slouching-Malfoy-s don’t slouch, Draco looked at Hari with hooded eyes tapping his newly acquired vault key to his bottom lip.Hari’s birthday was coming right around the corner. In a little over a month's time. He had plenty of time to woo his beautiful innocent boyfriend. Something that Draco was looking forward to. A wicked smirk bloomed on Draco’s face as he watched Hari lick up sticky juices from the apple slices he currently munched on. Draco unconsciously mirrored the move.
Dudley and Piers ran straight for the largest snake in the room, knocking over the littler kids to make his way to the front so he could smash his nose, pig-like against the glass. Behind the glass, the massive Boa Constrictor looked like it could easily wrap around his uncles car twice no problem, but at the moment it appeared to be sleeping. A sentiment that clearly Dudley and Piers didn't approve of. In aggravation they rapped their knuckles very loudly on the glass, shouting "Move!" The Boa Constrictor didn't even budge.
I looked at the scoreboard. Slytherin's only managed forty points, and Gryffindor won with one hundred fifty. The game had to have only lasted FIVE minutes. I nearly missed the game because of Weasel and longbottom. FIVE Minutes. Incredible.
"You said my father was pure-blood but he also has creatures' blood? How is that possible? And you, you boast about blood purity when you have creatures blood." Hari waved his hand to indicate all of Draco, his eyebrows scrunched together in bewilderment. "I thought, you're lot loathed half-breeds."
Slipping into the water, Draco slowly let the hot water soothe aching muscles. He let his head rest on the bath pillow over the lip of the tub. He let out a long content sigh. He wanted to let the warm water wash away his tension from the last couple days.
To Hari, well it was just as dark and shabby as he first remembered it, but the people who visited were just as wonderfully strange and inviting in their happy chatter. Hari felt a welcomed warmth at seeing the pub so lively once more. It was so … so dismal during the war. People were afraid to leave their homes and poor Tom, the barkeep and owner, was left to tend an empty bar and vacant rooms. But now the pub was hopping with cheerful voices, sharing a pint and eating foods at tiny tables in shadowy corners.
He lifted his Nimbus 2001 that had been discarded on the steps earlier. Draco was about to make a big leap of faith. He needed courage when he usually had none, so the only times he felt truly confident was when he was flying.
Potter looked between their two bodies to see Draco’s large cock seated at the entrance to his anus. He paled, breath halting in his chest, body still as a statue, as if that would stop his progression. “Malfoy,” he spat, “don’t do this. I won’t tell if you cease what you are doing right now. No, stop.” Draco wasn’t listening to a word Potter was saying, the end destination to irresistible to cut the journey short just yet. He spat into his hands, rubbing them over his cock, pumping his cock a few times adding delicious friction, before his cock was maneuvered at the entrance once more.
“They are my favorite flower and they’ve been used to celebrate Litha in the House of Black for generations, long before my daughter was born. It is tradition. Besides, I have many more.” Andromeda says handing over the basin gently.
I do not know where you are in the world, but it's just a matter of time before manufacturers have enough kits to set up drive threw testing centers. You shouldn't have to be showing symptoms to get tested then.
"Thieves." Hari frowned, not understanding. "Hari, there was a reason why the Dark Lords Regime in the Ministry were targeting Muggle-born. Father says...father said, that Muggle-borns steal the magic from the wizarding world. They get introduced to our world, go to school to learn all that can be taught to them, and then they leave. Many never assimilate and just...leave. Many of them leave and any contribution is always changing our ways, our traditions, our culture. Like, like..." Draco paused, hesitated. "Granger."
Once out in the garden, Hari walked through the grass, while Draco took the gravel circle path around. Hari rolled his eyes, but said nothing. The shed door was on a slide instead of a hinge, and it was a little rusted, so he had to put a little muscle behind the push to the right to open the door. It was a tiny space, most of it taken up by the motorcycle Sirius had left him. After the disaster of an escape from the Dursley’s on his seventeenth birthday, Mr. Weasley had shrunk it back down and fixed it up after it was crashed into Andromeda and Ted Tonk’s yard. Mr. Weasley was fascinated with Muggle artifacts, flying vehicles in particular. Hari remembered the flying car from second year, they flew it all the way to Scotland, before crashing it into the Whopping Willow Tree, and it now runs wild in the Forbidden Forest. Hopefully, Mr. Weasley didn’t take out all the security measures, he could live without the giant brick wall, but he quite liked the dragon fire from the exhaust pipe.
When he began drunken cussing, and stumbling away, Harry followed him. Peering behind a garbage bin He found the bum had made a nice, if smelly makeshift tent out of coats, blankets, and boxes beneath a fire escape in the shadows.
“I know, I know. I had no business yelling at Andromeda like that. I wasn’t even mad at her. I was just mad. I don’t like when things are kept from me, or when people just assume things about me. I spent all my life with secrets and lies being held over my head. Don’t I deserve the truth?” Hari demanded. “I thought once the war was over these feelings would stop, but I… I am still so angry and confused all the time!”
She paused before heading back into the kitchen before walking away with a tight throat and pinched lips. She had her son to take care of and a meal to prepare for her husband before he got home from work.
"Set your eyes to the stage and bow before our first round of Queens for the night!" The DJ began reading form the list. "We have; Queen Beryl, Queen Boudicca, Empress Suiko, Queen Daenerys, and finally; Mary, Queen of Scotts!" The DJ shouted and gave a sweeping bow. The crowd in the pit appeared to bow as well before screaming their approval as the five drag queens paraded on stage and showed off their elaborate costumes.
Narcissa was still pacing, now biting at her thumbnail, “Okay, but can’t the Ministry just retrieve the stolen gold?”
At the far end of the hall, just visible in the gloom was the door to the extravagant formal dining room; filled with a long wooden table that sat twenty or more guests, a large china cabinet proudly portraying the Black family crest and china. Above the dining room table hung long hanging light fixtures.
"No! Well, er...yes, but I want you too. No that doesn't sound right." Harry was getting more and more flustered as he finally got down to trying to ask Andromeda to move in with him. Signing himself, and sitting back down in the cramped living room, peering in at Teddy before facing his quarry.
She didn't give herself time to mourn the loss of her only sister. She'd have time to mourn at the funeral. but for now she didn't have time for the distraction.
Hari sucked in a startled breath as the dragon raised itself from the chaise with a creak of wood and advanced on him. The sound of sharp talons clicking on the hardwood floor, muffled as it crossed over a carpeted area, and then louder as the beast moved ever closer.
I see him scheming with his friends, huddled together in a tight trio. on the grounds, in the halls, in the library. With books that have nothing to do with the subjects. When he checks out a book I follow him to see what book it is and check it out in turn. I had to know what Harry was up too. My sanity wouldn't handle it anymore.
And with a final brick shoved back into place, the chieftess goblin disappeared behind a wall of solid brick.
"My husband... is in jail. because of you. Social workers will surely be coming to check out your..," She sneered, "living conditions. I will be calling a lawyer. You." She spat out, "will stay in your cupboard until I say otherwise, and when the social worker comes you will say exactly as I say." Her words left no room for argument.
"I'd be damned." Blaise whistled. "The prophet and a handful of other newspapers like Cecelia have speculated. I mean, a copy of Hari's pardon letter has circulated the papers. Some saying you've bewitched him."
The first thing he'd do is unlock the cupboard so he could sneak into the kitchen for a small snack that would probably be missed by his pig of a cousin Dudley, but not by his aunt or uncle.
A looming shadow shifted in his peripheral vision behind Cho that he hadn't noticed before and Hari instantly tensed. Turning to face the bulk, he prepared to pull out his wand. Instead, he dropped his mouth in astoundment. More so than seeing Cho, here in Westminster, the Muggle world and outside the school setting, he saw--his cousin. His cousin he hadn't seen since last summer.
His mother just looked at her son for a moment. “Are you telling me that our money now belongs to Harry Potter?”
“Father combined your vaults with the Malfoy vaults after I was born. He took advantage of a loophole in your prenuptial…” Draco trailed off as Narcissa bolted up from the cot, growling in her displeasure. Her eyes swirled with pearlescent colour.
Narcissa cupped her son’s cheek, “Draco…mon petite, you became my life, my only love. I would do anything for you. I wanted so much to protect you from your father, from the war, from the Dar…Voldemort.” Narcissa voice came alive with passion as she raised her burning eyes to her son’s, gripping his face tight between trembling white fingers. She laughed wetly. “I put my hand on the chest of the boy you loved, I felt his heartbeat and I knew…I knew we would prevail.”
Disgusted with himself, nearly sick in the aftermath of such unprovoked violence, Draco turned away from Potter, whom he believed was passed out or at least unable to get dressed, and he began to sort out his soggy, and limp clothes somehow still on him. He needed to get dressed quickly and get help for Potter. Once his shirt was on him once more and finished buttoning up his trousers, he heard a splashing sound behind him. He wheeled around to find, Potter had managed to roll himself over towards the sink, clamber for his wand and shout, “Sectumsempra!”

“What can this unworthy one do for Mistress Dowager Malfoy, and Master Malfoy?” Dot, the slanted eyed house-elf with polka dotted handkerchief tied around her ears, and red pillowcase tied in a strapless Hawaii style around her small body.
Draco ran in the direction the boy went, having lost sight of him in the mass of people. He could still taste the skin of the Muggle he bit back--wherever. Oh, no, what if he became diseased? What if he got--the pox? He’ll get horribly ill, red pox would appear on every part of his body, and he’d die an itchy death. So his father told him one reason to stay away from Muggles. He desperately tried cleaning his tongue off as he ran.
“Draco? Shut up.” Hari kissed Draco swiftly before jumping up, wiping suddenly sweaty hands as he said, “It’s decided then. We’ll do what I do best.” Draco’s heartbeat calmed down instantly.
Hari was just opening his mouth to blurt out, “I don’t need service from bigoted wenches like you,” when a familiar hoarse voice spoke from the shadows of towering wand boxes.
“Well, Harry, welcome to my place. Enjoy the food. I hope you’ll like the sauce.” Sheryl responded, jerking her chin in the direction of the tiny dipping platter with a couple sauce options.
Draco sensed that something was wrong.  The small smile his mother graced him with was wrong, sad even. The scent she was letting off was overly sweet, like the smell of burning sugar.
Draco shook his head once and tried unsuccessfully to blow the hair out of his eyes. He raised his head and looked no one else in the eye, except the Prosecutor, straightening his shoulders, he declared clearly if not a little raspy from crying, “I’m guilty. I do not pretend to be otherwise. The chargers against me are all true; I have the Dark Mark, I am a Death Eater. Those two actions have single handedly become the things I regret the most in my life thus far. My actions as a Death Eater has caused harm to a great deal of people. In trying to complete the tasks set to me by the Dark Lord, I used the Imperius Curse on Katie Bell, trying to have her deliver a Cursed Necklace to Katie Bell and was gravely injured and could have died. Ronald Weasley consumed the poison Mead meant as a Christmas present for Dumbledore; if it wasn’t for the quick thinking of Harry Potter, his friend would be dead. On the night of Dumbledore’s death, I finally finished repairing the Vanishing Cabinet and let Death Eaters into the Castle. I did not know the werewolf Fenrir Greyback, was among the Death Eaters who infiltrated the Castle. He repulses me. Many people were hurt that night because of my actions. Dumbledore died, I did not kill him, but I am responsible for his death.” With a last deep breath, Draco looked at his mother on the other side of his father. “I am guilty, my mother is not. I request that the Jury and the Wizengamot be kind to her.”
Draco finished his nightly beauty regiment quicker than usual. He didn’t need to be as strict with the amount of beauty products applied to his skin now that he came into his dragon inheritance. He wouldn’t have to worry about adolescence acne, nor premature balding, nor wrinkles for that matter. Dry skin was the only skin related issue he would have to worry about. If he didn’t apply enough moisturizer he became a bit scaly. Dry, itchy, and cracked skin was no fun to deal with when he already had enough alpha related problems to deal with.
"Draco darling, I don't think you realize you were born to be a Queen. His skin is so clear and look at these cheekbones, my Marry-Alice?"
Draco trembled as the brief spike in adrenaline subsided. “Keep your venomous pet in check, Potter.” He rubbed his ear, unsettled by the closeness of those snapping jaws. “I’m not sure
“Love?” Hari rolled on his tongue. No one had used such an endearment on him and absolutely meant it with Draco’s conviction before. It was nice.
Spent, Hari laid sprawled, boneless and sated. His chest rising and falling was the only indication he was even breathing. He felt like he was floating on cloud nine.  A slurping sound roused Hari from his mental space enough that he summoned the energy to raise his head.
Harry sat down with arms wrapped around his knees, he didn't bother turning on the light. His cheek felt hot, and swollen. He raised one trembling hand to his stinging cheek. Hissing, he pulled his damp hand away. He was in shock. That was the first time his aunt had ever hit him. Usually it was just Dudley that pummeled him.
After two failed meals, Draco settled for just having the house-elves deliver meals to his room, he'd starve otherwise. But now that his rut was over, Draco wanted to be anywhere but his room. Opening both windows facing the back garden, he aired out his room from the smell of stale sweat and sex pheromones.
It was Hari that finally broke the silence. “Um…Dray?...you know, I…I’ve been answering your questions all night. Will you answer one of mine?...er…after this one that is?” Hari corrected. When Draco gave a nod of consent, Hari continued, “Why did you do it?” At Draco’s perplexed look, Hari elaborated. “Why didn’t you turn me into your father and Voldemort? You knew it was me, but you said you couldn’t be sure.”
