“Don’t worry, I have something special planned for you being such a good boy and putting up with all of this,” Harry promised and settled down onto the couch next to the blonde, passing him a glass of Firewhiskey.
,” The Italian replied with a scoff. “It would be troublesome if such a dominant person like that were to take advantage of poor Dray-Dray.”
“Ah, Ron and Hermione are here...You two stay here...” Harry hissed quietly, standing up and smoothing his shirt down nervously as he made his way back to the front door to greet his friends.
"Harry, mate......How could you.....?" Ron asked with a scowl, though it didn't stop the hurt from bleeding into his voice.
Draco’s pale cheeks dusted over with crimson at the remark, and he hastily withdrew his arm with an embarrassed frown. Harry likewise retreated his arm quickly as he glanced up at Kingsley with a mixed expression. “So...that’s it now? We’re really...stuck like this together now...?” His voice sounded equal parts dread and uncertainty.
round~" The blonde pulled his lover over to the couch and pushed him to sit down, sinking down to straddle his lap.
Harry watched the interaction with no small amount of utter mortification, but he couldn’t bring himself to say anything to try and remedy the situation.
Though Draco had originally been against integrating many Muggle objects into his and his lover’s flat, Harry had finally convinced him that there were quite a few different Muggle inventions that were quite beneficial for day to day use. The Telly for example. And another one of his recent favorites; the toaster. While one certainly could use magic to toast a piece of bread to the perfect stage of golden-brown-crispy-crunchiness, there was just something so fascinating about putting a piece of bread into that silver box and watching it pop out minutes later.
Harry grimaced and blinked a few times to get used to the sudden bright lighting. There was still a dull pain in his chest, but it was hardly an ache compared to mind-numbing pain that he had felt before. "Did I...pass out?" he asked hesitantly. That was all he needed—for everyone to think that he was some baby that passed out from a little bit of pain. The last thing he could recall before everything went black was the sound of someone screaming.
Harry and Draco sat on the couch across from the Minister, plastered as far away as the opposite sides of the couch would let them be. They were both tense and unsure of what would be happening next.
Kingsley immediately rushed to the bedside, staring at the pale-faced boy resting unconscious against the stark white sheets. "Harry..."
As Blackwell shot Davies a questioning look, Davies coughed lightly. "Blackwell, this is Minister Kingsley." He gestured to Kingsley politely while eyeing Blackwell pointedly. "Minister, this is Blackwell—one of our healers who specializes in the research and treatment of dark magic."
Draco gave the pair of stunned Gryffindors a wink as he leaned over and captured his lover's lips—moving his own against them only briefly before releasing them.
“Florence, you know this isn’t your fault. If any, it’s mine—for sending two rookies out in the field by themselves....Regardless, none of us could have predicted that something like this was going to happen. We just have to be thankful that you and the others were able to reach Draco and Harry in time and bring them here.”
comes in,” Kingsley explained with a nod, opening the folder and pulling out a sheet of parchment for Harry to look over. “Basically, the program is to help rehabilitate and find jobs for those who are being oppressed due to their blood status. Muggleborn, Pureblood, anything. Any person who is being discriminated against will be able to file a form and receive help from our departments.”
Kingsley nodded and pulled another sheet from the envelope, staring at it for a long moment before sighing heavily and finally passing it to Harry. “We received a grievance from one Draco Malfoy about not being able to obtain work, due to his family being a known supporter of Voldemort...”
Ron screwed his face in an expression that suggested he was in extreme pain—but to those who knew him realized this to be the expression that he took on when thinking deeply about something.
All Florence could do was thank Draco for being sensible enough to send a patronus message back to the Ministry to him. The silvery-white cloud had flown through the air and into Florence’s office—materializing in the air in front of his desk in the form of a
“Tsk, tsk, tsk.....Naughty children should mind their own business...” The snatcher purred silkily, pacing in front of Draco slowly. His eyes drifted down to Harry’s listless form and Draco instinctively side-stepped to cover his view.
,’ but avoided commenting on it. Instead he shook his head. “Thankfully, we did not get stuck in the woods for days.”
"I know that it's a lot to take in....but it's the truth." Harry uttered earnestly, not knowing what else he could say to plead his case.
After a few more moments of relative silence watching the show, Draco finally steeled himself and opened his mouth. “So....you wanted to meet my roommate, right?”
Pansy sent him another loathing glare while Draco’s eyes widened and his pale cheeks dusted over ever so slightly with pink. Apparently that bet was news to him.
the person that people entrust their children to...” Draco lamented with a disbelieving shake of his head.
Draco watched as Harry paced around the room, combing his fingers through his hair absentmindedly as he tended to do when in deep thought. There was a deep frown marring his face, and his dark brows were drawn down unhappily towards his emerald eyes- leaving the blonde with the slight feeling a guilt starting to creep its way into his chest.
Ronald! I told you, Harry said to meet him at 2:30, not 3:00!" The unmistakable voice of Hermione Granger quipped shortly as she suddenly landed in the fireplace—bending down to quickly dust the excess floo powder off of the bottom of her coat.
"You.........you really have changed, haven't you.." Ron mumbled quietly, looking between the blonde and Harry.
He reclined into a large armchair and motioned for the two to sit across from him in the large sofa there. Harry sank down silently into the far right cushion, huffing slightly and shooting Draco a suspicious look as he did so. Draco returned the look with a slight roll of his eyes, choosing to perch against the left arm of the couch instead.
“Draco, mate! Good to see ya!” The silky smooth voice of Draco’s best friend drawled as he stepped out of the fireplace—apparently having just flooed in to the flat—despite the lack of the couple’s knowledge.
“Well obviously Dray. I couldn’t have been more surprised than if you told me you were dating a Hippogriff.” He returned sarcastically—waving his hand for the blonde to keep dishing out information. “Wizard, or Muggle?”
“Oh well...” Harry fumbled over his words as he tried to think of the most tactful way to explain to his friends about the purpose of this luncheon. Against his better judgement he had invited the three of his friends with an invitation that only gave the vague notion of having lunch together.
The couch spun around in the air and sank gracefully back to it’s original position, albeit backwards now, with a quiet
been some close calls on a few of the cases that he had been on—but neither he nor Florence had ever sustained injury needing of hospitalization while out on the job. “I suppose I should consider myself extremely fortunate then...”
The entire space, like any other hospital or medical ward, was completely stark white—and the strange scent of sanitizing potions and foreign medicines filled the air.
Now at St. Mungo’s—with half of the entire medical staff up and in a tither, trying desperately to mend the two young injured wizards—Florence couldn’t tamp down the immense feelings of fear and guilt that tore at his heart.
This time a hush broke over the small group, and only Florence began clapping as the blonde strode out quickly—not making eye contact with anyone in the room. The shocked group slowly followed suit and began clapping until Draco stood in his destined spot beside Harry.
Another branch snapped and Harry and Draco both whirled toward the direction that they thought it came from. Harry held his hand up to warn Draco not to move again. His eyes darted around until they trained in on something—a pair of red eyes staring back.
Draco stood up for the couch and gestured to Harry behind him, scratching the back of his neck in anxiousness.
“Oh you don’t, Eh?” Blaise cut in with a drawl, smirking deviously at the girl. “Then you shouldn’t forget that you now owe
“To the Minister’s office!” He exclaimed brightly again, hopping into an unoccupied car and punching one of the buttons on the wall of the elevator, before reaching up to grab hold of one of the handle straps as the elevator took off with a lurch. Harry followed suit, a bit too late—reaching desperately for one of the straps as he stumbled forward with the momentum of the car.
Kingsley smiled slightly. “At ease, Florence—I’m here for the same reason you are.” He held his robes and sunk gracefully onto the bench next to Florence—the faint smile immediately disappearing. “I received an informal report from Eddlson about what happened—but as you were the one who received the Patronus message from young Malfoy, I’d like to hear it from you.”
"Excellent," Pansy hugged Draco again. "I also want you to start thinking about what you're going to take from here when you leave. We have a place in mind for you to live and it comes furnished, but you can bring a few things you'd like to keep. Also, between your mother's and my mother's house-elves, the manor will be tended to periodically." She paused for a moment. "We'll have to get you more Muggle clothes, but that'll be easy."
He then did a vacuuming spell, because the oriental carpet on the floor was at least two hundred years old and needed to be cared for in a better manner than they had been doing. Although it had managed to survive Weasley and Harry's shared pizza nights over the occasional Quidditch match.
"It's quite unnecessary for you to sit up and wait for me as if you're my father," Astoria commented.
Harry and Deon were about to head toward the cabin when Charlie turned to Harry. "I know you'd rather watch
Harry watched as pink crept up Draco's neck and dotted his cheeks. "I think it's great that you were as excited about today as I am. I've spent the morning reading Charlie's dragon handler monthly magazines. Not exactly scintillating reading."
"I still don't understand why you aren't pursuing any career other than Quidditch." She stood, hands on hips, and to Harry's thinking looked like Molly Weasley rounding on the twins.
At that moment, Narcissa picked a dummy up off the dresser and popped it into the baby's open mouth. Clare latched onto it and began to suck on it so fiercely, Harry wondered if there was some magical substance inside.
Rob's eyes began to twinkle. "I happen to know the team has no issue with that as long as what's there now goes into storage, and comes back when you move out."
Harry felt the exact moment he found his rhythm. He swooped up and down in the air, forgetting everything but the wind in his hair and the broom beneath him.
Draco nodded, knowing arguing would be pointless. "Fine, I'll leave the Floo open. Come over when you have real clothing on."
"Mother started my collection before I was born. It's the only piece I don't have. I've never even seen it. There are no quality photos, and it's never been displayed."
"No, I'll stay with you." Even as the words left his mouth, his entire body protested. Damn, he wanted Harry's big, steaming shower and then his lovely, soft bed.
Astoria rolled her eyes and gave a short laugh. "She's a Malfoy through and through. She looks like a miniature Narcissa, except…" her voice trailed off.
Draco led Scott into his home office, urging him to sit in a chair. He considered getting the man a shot of bourbon, but knew Harry would smell it and want to know what was going on.
She nodded. "Everything is fine. She did say, however, that she wasn't comfortable with me staying in a house with no Floo access. For the remainder of the time until I deliver, at least."
Harry returned his hand to Draco's jaw, then curled it around his nape and slid his fingers back into Draco's baby soft, white blond hair. "How about if I take you home the long way?"
Deon shook his head and chuckled softly. "And to think Charlie's always said such nice things about you." He lifted a hand and with a grin, walked down the hall and into his room.
. The American had passed away and his family was putting his entire collection of Cripnock pieces up for auction. There would be no pre-sale and each piece would be sold individually. Draco had nearly fainted when he read that the family was breaking up what could possibly be the only collection with every dragon. But it also meant he finally had a chance to obtain the one piece that had eluded him for all these years…
Ron nodded. "Doesn't mean I have to like it. You two were fine at Hogwarts and then all of a sudden you're—"
"I'm sure I looked about ready to lose the plot. I know I saw that bloody Bludger before you did, but with a stadium screaming around me there was no way to let you know." Darian rubbed his free hand over his forehead. "Merlin, Harry. I aged sixty years in those few seconds."
Draco had a hundred questions running through his head, but he simply fetched his coat and followed Emilio out the door.
"In the matter of attempting to kill Albus Dumbledore, we find you not guilty. In the matter of assisting the Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, we find you not guilty, due to the extreme duress you were placed under. In the matter of joining forces with Voldemort and causing pain and suffering to Muggles, we find you guilty. In the matter of assisting the Death Eaters to hold prisoners in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor, we find you guilty." The Chief Warlock lowered the parchment he was reading to look directly at Draco.
"I'll have them cleaned for you." Harry lifted his hand away from the seat and slid his palm along Draco's jaw, leaning forward.
Draco managed a nonchalant shrug. "That's never going to happen, Pans. Has he improved? Yes. Is he good looking? Extremely. But he's also completely off limits. Even I'm not self-loathing enough to entertain the thought of being with the strongest wizard in the world while being unable to do magic myself."
Harry had moved to sit on the arm of Draco's chair, and Draco could feel him trembling with suppressed rage. Again, the windows began to rattle in their frames. The harder he fought not to show it, the more his rage seemed to reorder the basic molecules in the room. Carefully, knowing Harry's magic could be wild when he was wound up, Draco reached out and curled his hand around his wrist.
"I was just going to suggest that perhaps this would be a good time for you to go on holiday. You've not been away since…well if I can't remember how long it's been – then it's been a ridiculously long time."
Letting out a sigh, Draco finally sat in his chair. "No, I understand. I'm glad everything is okay now, and I appreciate you getting in contact with me as soon as you could." Draco was positive the phone had not been
"I told you before," Draco answered, mentally raising his Occlumency shields, "I worked for a bit and then went to uni and studied. After I graduated, I saved every Knut I could, and finally I could afford a small storefront for my business." He didn't add that once he felt enough time had passed, he bought the brownstone he currently lived in and moved his office to the lower level.
"There's a very regal looking bird sitting on the ledge outside your window." She pointed at the window behind Harry with her fork.
Angelina called out with a laugh, "Just one of the many reasons you love us and fit so well in the bunch."
The article concluded with commentary from the man who had allegedly approached Harry. It turns out he was a photographer for the
"It's not important. Old news, really. What I really need to know is if you can do anything with this." He scrubbed his hand through his too long hair.
She tossed a hand towel that was miraculously still intact at his head. "My love life has never made you gag, you brat," she protested. "You always want details!"
He'd eaten a bagel standing up leaning against the kitchen counter, drinking a scalding hot cup of tea. By the time he dragged himself up the two flights of stairs to get to Harry's suite, he was so tired he was glad no one was trying to speak to him; he feared his only response would be nonsensical babble. He stripped off Harry's terry-cloth bathrobe, laying it over the foot of the bed, then slipped naked between the sheets. He was sound asleep moments after his head hit the pillow.
Tonight after dinner, as they did nearly every evening when Draco was home, they curled up on the couch to watch the telly.
Harry smiled a sweet, genuine smile that made Draco's heart turn over. "She's completely charming. And she looks like you."
Last season when the Arrows had faced the Harpies, Ginny had been unable to play following a nasty broken arm she sustained during practice some weeks earlier. Even aided by Skele-gro, the team trainer was not happy with her healing progress and had deemed it too dangerous for her to play. That match, Harry had made a meal out of the Harpies' reserve Seeker Imogene Bell, and Ginny had vowed to
"…horizontal Mambo?" He put his hands on his hips. "Again, why are we friends?" He waved the thought away with his hand. "In hindsight, that part of the story is really fairly anticlimactic. He came in from training one day, it was the day I'd received my acceptance from the uni I wanted to attend, and I was absolutely beside myself wanting to share my news. He came in the door and I blurted it out. He stared for a minute and then rushed over, pulling me into an embrace."
While Draco was upstairs searching for his long overcoat, he almost convinced himself he must've fallen and struck his head on the corner of his desk. Potter could not be in his house; his daughter could not have magicked him there. It was too much to hope for. But when he came back downstairs, Potter was sitting in one of the chairs next to his fireplace, holding his own much newer scarf in his hand. Draco felt his face heat. He'd shoved Potter's original scarf in his deep pocket, certain there was going to have to be a conversation about that, and he wasn't much looking forward to it.
Knowing it wasn't good to exhaust Astoria, Draco pulled his mobile from his pocket and called for a cab. When it arrived, they stood to leave, and Simone bustled over and immediately began to fuss over Astoria. Draco wanted to strangle her when she began to complain—not particularly quietly—that it would be so much simpler if she was able to Apparate Astoria home.
"No, not complaining. Gods, Draco," Harry rasped. He was fully hard now, and Draco caressed his length with slow thrusts, forward and back. Harry reached around him and sank his fingers into the hard muscles of his arse, pulling him down harder, and now it was Draco's turn to gasp.
Harry bumped him in the shoulder. "Come on, you prat, I'll walk with you to the Leaky and we can use the Floo to get home. Neither of us need to be Apparating after this much beer."
Pansy gave him a playful shove. "What do I look like? Chopped Flobberworm? You see, Draco, the Ministry didn't count on me. Because I have a plan." Her grin was wicked.
Harry stared at the now blank wall, surprised it had worked. He'd seen Hermione use the spell before but had never tried it himself.
Once the classroom emptied, Harry sat at his desk. He looked at the books, his notes and the stack of parchments waiting to be marked. He stood again, and walked out the door. Leaving it all behind. He stopped in the classroom next to his and stuck his head in. "Murphy? Something came up. My lessons are done for the day. I'm heading out. If anyone comes looking for me…" He hesitated not quite sure what to say. "Well, tell them I had to go." Without waiting for a reply, Harry left.
"Tulips?" Darian smirked into his cup. "Sorry, mate. We'd already worn out our welcome at your usual haunts. And they were the only ones open after two."
He stalled for so long, Harry was about to tell him he didn't need to answer when Draco spoke again.
Harry gave her a final squeeze and kissed the top of her head, as he'd done a thousand times before. Draco watched the exchange with a knot in his stomach. Every time he thought he was fine knowing their daughter loved him, but worshipped her
"Merlin's springy pubes," Pansy whispered harshly, "is the man really hung like that, or does he just have enormous bollocks?"
"Mmhmm," Charlie murmured with a grin. "Your mouth says we didn't, but your face tells a completely different story. But don't worry, little brother, I won't rat you out to the family. Yet."
"I think it's cute. Besides that's not for you to read." Draco protested. "Now give me back my phone."
"Did you go to Hogwarts?" Harry asked, finding the blue eyes in the mirror. Or, he thought he did. He couldn't see a hell of a lot with his glasses sitting on Darian's station. The regret he was able to see on Darian's face told him he'd fucked up before he'd even started: was Darian a squib? "You are – a – wizard, right?"
He shook his head and adjusted his dick. Okay, he told himself, no thinking about that kiss…the kiss that made him hard and just want more. He was organizing his thoughts. Fine. Second, he was on holiday. While Harry was no saint, he preferred a relationship to a one-off. He lived in London, for Merlin's sake. Draco lived in Romania. They both had demanding careers. Harry sighed. He had a career he disliked more and more each day. But still…
"How about we just go out for dinner and then you turn in early on a night when you can sleep in?" Darian suggested cheerfully as he sat on Harry's bed and watched him jumping to get into some tight black jeans.
"Harry," Draco asked, taking a step closer, "what's wrong? This can't just be about what you're wearing."
"Don't pretend you care," she snapped. "It's a bit late for that. You never wanted to marry me and you never loved me."
"If he can't do it, Paul probably can." Their stylists were a very cute, young gay couple who owned the salon just off the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.
"There's some things I'm not going to tell even you, so don't ask. Did Draco and I enjoy each other's company? Yes. What am I feeling for him? I have no fucking clue. I just know that we had a great time together and seem to have chemistry between us."
"Charming," Hermione said dryly. "I simply must get the name of your decorator. He does urban-trash so realistically."
"Ah, there you are," Emilio said brightly when Draco walked into the sitting room. "I was hoping to find you here."
"So would I," Draco said. "I'm counting on her running the apothecary at St Mungo's before I retire. But if she decides she'd rather be a full-time mum, I'm certainly not going to dissuade her. You were a full-time dad. Do you regret it?"
"Uhm, Draco, and Harry," he still had a hard time looking Harry in the eye, poor sod, "we're really glad you could join us tonight. We, uhm… well, we…" He looked over to Lily a bit desperately, and she rolled her eyes, fondly.
Harry closed his eyes as he slid the glasses into place. Perhaps, he reasoned, he'd been hallucinating from the potions they'd given him and the person in his room was not actually Malfoy.
Harry was still right where he'd left him, his eyes once again closed, and Draco set the monitor on the tea table. He fastidiously turned the small picture screen away, then toed off his boots and hiked his expensive robes up around his hips. Gracefully he lifted his long, pale leg and straddled his husband, settling lightly on Harry's groin, the bulge at the apex of his thighs coming to rest just beneath Draco's balls.
"Hello, darling," she said, removing her coat and laying it over Draco's on the chair. "You look very handsome this morning."
"She's beautiful, so tiny and perfect." He looked up at his wife through watery eyes. "Thank you." He bent and kissed the top of the baby's head, then turned to Philippe, turning the baby so he could see.
Răzvan said something in Romanian and Draco gave a hearty laugh. "Yes, you're right" Draco replied, "he doesn't look much like a
Draco laughed and Harry felt it like a punch in the gut. It was a warm, gentle sound, and Harry wanted to hear it again, hear it aimed at
"What the bloody hell," he muttered, setting the book he was reading, which had been lying open on his chest, onto the ottoman near his feet. He stood when the voices got only louder, rubbing his hands over his face and then his fingers up through his hair, quite sure he was making more of a mess of it than it had been before. He made it down the stairs to the landing, but the ruckus appeared to be coming from the main level.
Harry slipped into his coat and wrapped the newer scarf around his neck. The older one, he pushed toward Draco.
"It wouldn't be the same," Draco said, dashing at the tears with his free hand, impatient with himself. "I always knew I'd get it back. For her to never even know it…" He sighed. "It's been eating me up inside. Astoria told me plainly it was my fault; that because I'd misused my magic during the war, I'd somehow sentenced her to a life without it."
It was, he had to give her that. When he'd first been trying to convert Galleons to pounds, he'd been a nervous mess, perpetually afraid he didn't have enough money in his pockets.
Darian wrapped his arm around Harry's shoulders, and the low, swooshing sensation Harry hated rolled through his stomach as they left Grimmauld Place behind them.
Draco slipped his mobile back into his pocket and cleared the room with a simple, "This meeting has gone on long enough, ladies and gentlemen. We'll try again next week. Do see if you can't come up with more palatable arguments to increase your budgets for next quarter."
"Bloody buggering hell," he muttered as the wand skittered past his fingertips and clattered to the floor. He sat up and rubbed his eyes realizing not only was the pounding still going on, but someone was shouting his name.
Even after everything he'd done, Harry had flown into Fiendfyre to save him. What haunted him was why? What was it about Draco that made Harry think he was worth saving? He wished he could see it, particularly now when he felt so hopeless and worthless, married to a woman he didn't love and stuck with her for the rest of his life. Add to that a distinct and ever painful lack of magic in his life, on pointed pain of finding himself in a cell adjacent to the father who'd sold him out without even telling him, at least twice. First to Walden Greengrass because he'd wanted the cash and status, and then to Voldemort at the cost of Draco's soul.
Pansy drained her champagne flute and signalled for it to be refilled. "Never," she confirmed with a grin.
The answer to the dilemma of what to do with his life fell in his lap during dinner one night with Ron and Hermione.
alive, he might not be waiting for a verdict at all. The sound of a gavel against a wooden block cut through the chamber's chatter, and a booming voice called the session back to order. It quickly pulled him from his musings and, once again, he struggled to keep his leg still.
He knew from being held before his trial that what they called the shower room wasn't somewhere he'd willingly take off his clothes. Draco followed the guard down the hall, turning into the open room that housed four stainless steel toilets along one wall and four shower heads along another. The waist high walls between the toilets and the shower heads did little to allow any privacy. Draco went to the toilet and did what needed to be done. He turned away from the showers, instead choosing to move toward the sinks that were across from the showers. The water barely dripped out and the soap dispenser was empty. He splashed ice-cold water on his face and ran his wet fingers through his hair, now more than ever, happy he'd begun to wear it short several years before.
"Holy fucking Merlin's balls!" Draco shouted. "Pull up, Potter! Damn it, pull up you absolute bloody fool!" But his words were lost in the pounding of the falling rain.
Reaching out a hand, Harry grabbed Draco's arm. "Wait. I'm sorry. I was surprised to see you here and reacted badly. At least come in and tell me why you're here."
"Spoken like someone who's spent a fair amount of time in hospital." Draco said, then took another bite of the sandwich. "Including this one."
Darian sailed out of the bedroom and a few minutes later Harry smelled coffee brewing. Only then did he attempt to stand up, and he nearly wept when his head and stomach combined their efforts to make him feel wretched. It was almost ten minutes before the potion took effect and he could limp into the kitchen.
She gave him a soft smile. "I couldn't, even if I didn't already like you so very much. Which I do." He cheeks turned a fetching pink and Draco's heart sank. "My parents would never forgive me."
Malfoy hesitated; his mouth slightly open. "Why…yes, I suppose so." He stared down at the coffee cup, his eyes lost.
was the one who made Draco shudder, made him hard. His tongue flicked under the glans before he pulled Draco's cock into his mouth. Draco's resulting moan shot straight to Harry's dick. He wanted to look at Draco, to watch his face, but the cock in his mouth felt so perfect that he couldn’t stop long enough to glance up. He let Draco set the pace, forcing himself to breathe deeply through his nose, tiny exhales puffing against Draco's skin when he'd taken all of him in. Harry wrapped one hand around the base of Draco's shaft, using it for some of the up and down motion while he pressed his tongue against the vein and then pull back slowly, sucking hard until only the head was still in his mouth.
Pansy stretched up on her toes and kissed Draco on the cheek, then swept at the tears on her cheeks and managed a smile. "Like I'd ever let you forget, you old toe rag."
"Time for some hard realities, I suppose," She looked up at him, curiosity playing on her face. "I work for a living, Astoria. I don't hail taxis when I can just as easily walk. It's one of the things you'd have to become accustomed to if you and your parents are determined to go through with this. I don't have much disposable income." He lifted his chin and started off down the street, and he thought it was to her credit that she didn't ask any awkward questions.
"Draco, I'm so sorry. Can you tell me what they said? How he was…how it happened?" She shook her head. "I just can't believe it, not Harry." She sniffled and wiped a tear as it rolled down her cheek.
Narcissa merely walked out, calling over her shoulder. "It would be best if you dealt with that now before the formula settles into the carpet. And do remember you're a wizard, and use your wand. A nice strong
a Muggle. I'm not allowed to use magic. I can't go to any Magical locations; no Diagon Alley, no Quidditch, no magical restaurants or Hogwarts or Hogsmeade. No owl post, no fire-calls, I can't even cook or wash up or make a bloody cup of tea, using magic." Laying it all out reminded him how isolated he felt, and he swallowed heavily.
Charlie shook his head. "It's fine. Just let me grab something cold to drink and I'll fill you in." He glanced towards his bedroom door. "Deon been asleep since you got back?"
charm on his glasses. Once he could see again, he scanned the sky until his eyes caught the tell-tale glimmer once again. The ball was hovering about mid-field and pretty much an equal distance between both Seekers. At nearly the same moment, Christianson caught sight of it and the chase was on. As they neared it, the Snitch veered left, then right, and then shot straight up and out of view.
They came up to the entrance for Platform Nine and Three Quarters, and Harry stepped back with Darian and Emile as Draco put his arm around Camélia. They'd brought her to see older Sorrentino and Weasley cousins off to school in previous years so that her own first time wouldn't be as startling as Harry's had been. Draco glanced over at Harry, a question in his eyes, but Harry just smiled. He adored Camélia, had been an amazing father to her, and Draco knew he'd miss her. Harry was determined to make this day about Draco and his daughter, no matter how often Draco told him he didn't need to.
"The bloody bus is misbehaving again, then? I should have known you wouldn't actually be able to repair it."
He went and sat at his desk, going through the small ritual of retrieving the gold key and unlocking the lower drawer almost without thinking. He moved some things aside and picked up the fading scarlet and gold scarf, holding it in his hand, his thumb rubbing over the strands hanging from the end.
"You are," she countered. "Every girl in the whole of Slytherin house was in love with you at one point or another." She smirked. "I will grant that you hid your grand passion for Potter very well."
"Oh do fuck off, Draco," Pansy replied with a roll of her eyes. "That was bitchy even for you, didn't get laid last night?"
Draco slapped Scott on the back and Harry shook his hand. "Well done, dad. Now you get some rest too. Tommy's likely to wake up very soon demanding some food."
Draco watched Harry walk through the deserted café and out through the door into the night, broad shoulders squared and head high, and he felt as if his heart protested, aching in his chest, beating hard in his throat.
They lay together, breath harsh against each other. Harry felt Draco shift, his hand moving to Harry's belt. "I need to take care of you," he  rasped out. "Just as soon as my bones are no longer liquid."
She grinned up at him, then turned to Philippe when Harry came up and stood beside him, taking his hand.
Gunther stared at him, blinking slowly, as if trying to gather himself. Draco felt a shiver of alarm.
Draco's mouth dropped open. "You horrid cow. You take that back! My daughter and I do not smell like an unclean diaper!"
"I'm scared, Pans," he managed as he wept. "I'm so fucking scared that I've considered just giving up all together." He loved Pansy like a sister but he couldn't bring himself to tell her that the only things holding him together at those times were the photograph of his mother in the rose garden, and that stupid Gryffindor scarf that belonged to Potter. Mementos of two of the strongest people he knew: both held onto most nights, and stuffed between the sofa cushions during the day. The only things that kept him from doing something foolish.
Draco moved onto his knees and pulled Harry in close, covering Harry's mouth with his.  Harry responded immediately. This kiss held none of the previous gentleness. It was everything Harry loved about kissing a man. Draco nipped at Harry's lip and before he could even respond, Draco was pressing their mouths together again, all teeth and tongue and a promise of something more.
"Nothing for me, Harry," Molly said, taking her seat. "I'll just sit here and interrogate your handsome 'not date'."
"He's much improved since I last saw him," Draco said, managing to keep his voice level and disinterested. At least, he thought he had. He began to doubt his acting skills when Pansy reached out and squeezed his arm. "So," he straightened, "where is this marriage announcement?"
Draco closed his eyes, then turned and glared at him. "Not that it's any of your business, but I happen to be very fond of some children, Toby Burgess among them. He is a very bright, very dedicated young man."
Draco laughed. And as he did, he realised it was the first time in weeks he actually felt like laughing. He didn't know what had prompted Pansy to turn up, but as he poured her a glass of Bordeaux, he was eternally grateful she had.
Pansy furrowed her brow. "It's obvious something horrible has happened to him. What else could have happened that would bring about all these histrionics?"
He took a deep breath, trying to hold onto his excitement, not wanting to let her leach it away. He knew she was only concerned about him, but sometimes that concern felt strangling. She had an idea in her head where they should all be, and what they should all be doing, and he'd already denied her that by deciding not to be an Auror. Harry wanted, no
"I hadn't expected it to be so big," she said as they entered the kitchen. He had set almost everything up before she arrived, but he turned on the electric kettle and added teabags to the tea pot. While the water heated Draco took a selection of small sandwiches from the refrigerator, setting them out to come to room temperature, then a plate of cookies covered with plastic wrap from his pantry. Astoria watched everything he did with keen interest.
"Why didn't she call me?" Harry began to worry his lower lip. "She always calls me. Did she look okay, she's not sick is she?"
"Guilty as charged." Harry turned his hand and linked his fingers with Draco's. "So who called you?"
Harry pulled his hand away and crossed his arms, and Draco knew it was embarrassment at finding himself discussed as if he weren't standing there. He could almost feel the expressive roll of his green eyes; Harry tended to do that when he felt self-conscious. Draco couldn't help it; he had to poke at him.
She looked away quickly and muttered, "I figured it would be best just to show him and not make a big deal of it."
Darian leaned over, reaching up to shift Harry's fringe out of his eyes. "First thing, we're going to deal with
Draco heard a sound behind him, and he turned. He hadn't noticed the shower shutting off but it clearly had, because Harry was coming out of the bath, a towel around his narrow hips, briskly drying his hair with another. He was a sight, droplets of water dripping down his tanned chest, arms over his head, muscles flexing as he scrubbed the terrycloth over his hair. He dropped his arms and when he saw Draco, he gave him a brilliant smile.
. There was an odd sense of urgency in them; as though they were words that should have been spoken rather than texted.
Then fucking Draco Malfoy was the stranded wizard waiting for him. In the months since the final battle, he'd only seen Malfoy a handful of times, and even though he'd wondered about him idly from time to time, his curiosity hadn't been pressing enough for Harry to try to find out what had become of his old adversary.
When there was no reply to his joke, Harry stared at his mobile for several moments. What the hell had just happened? Whenever he chatted with
"This time, it isn't true at all. I did come here purposely. I knew if I took you straight to the Manor gates, you'd be able to do magic again and you'd probably hex my balls off."
"Mr Potter?" Darian offered his hand. His fingers were long and slender and Harry, still somewhat befuddled, hesitated a moment too long. Darian's eager smile began to fade. "Is everything alright?"
Beecham held up the vial. "And we'll get them outta you one way or another." He laughed as he elbowed Holden in the side. "Right?"
"I hear you," Harry said, irritation growing. "I just didn't expect to get chewed out for winning the fucking game."
"Auror Potter," Ludo pleaded. "Please, be reasonable. I truly thought Malfoy was at the very least prostituting himself, perhaps even running some sort of service. The amount of money he has been spending, when there was no source of income—."
The following month, after a statement with a nine hundred pound balance arrived in the post, he took the card away from her and cut it up into tiny pieces. Her maths had apparently not improved.
Gathering up the clothing from his hamper, he went to the room they'd converted into a laundry room when they put the nursery together. It was a decision Harry was quite pleased with at the moment. He threw the clothes in the drum, shut the door and began to select the cycle and temperature. Realizing he'd stalled as long as he could, he pushed the button and the machine began to work. He knew it was time to go listen to Narcissa tell him what a failure he was as a father. And given the mess she'd walked in on, he really couldn't blame her.
… how Harry's smile stopped just short of his usual brilliant one, the crease between his brows that didn't leave, and the one that told Draco it was time to leave; the muscle above Harry's left eye would twitch, ever so slightly, when he spoke.
"That's you told by a bird, Hermione," Ron laughed. "Who's it from?" He pointed to the letter beside Harry's plate.
Draco stopped speaking and let the ominous tone sit in the room for a bit as he took a languid sip of his coffee—all remaining eyes at the table trained fixedly on him.
with you...." Harry mumbled with a chuckle, but didn't stop his lover's advances as Draco bent down to capture his lips once again—this time with a more heated urgency, sweeping his tongue over the Gryffindor's bottom lip before taking it between his teeth to tug at teasingly.
“Alright, alright already! I wanna hear mooore! What happens next?” She asked enthusiastically, practically bouncing in her seat in excitement.
Harry remained silent, unsure of what to make with that statement. Kingsley finally let out a long breath before striding back over and sinking back down behind his desk. He then pulled out a drawer and rifled through it before finding a file and setting it carefully on top of the desk.
times. But today he finally decided that he just couldn't bear the guilt of lying to his friends over and over again—it was really starting to eat at him.
“I’m sure you would...” Draco replied with a mischievous look, turning to murmur something to Theo next to him.
Kingsley sighed deeply. He wasn’t expecting to be showered with good news, but he was still trying to remain optimistic. Harry still being in surgery after the three or more hours they had been in the ward was not looking positive.
“Tea?” Kingsley glanced up and pushed two freshly-filled mugs across the table towards them. “You both seem nervous, this will help.”
“...Tomorrow...?” Draco continued, his voice barely above a horrified whisper. He gave Kingsley a look that made it seem as if the older man had suggested he marry a hippogriff.
They side-along Apparated into a small back room of what Harry hoped was the Apothecary. There were jars filled with liquid and unrecognizable parts. Most of which Harry didn't ever want identified.
The receptionist laughed. "No offence, but I can tell." He offered his hand. "Hi. I'm Mickey. And you are?"
When he finally got to Lily's he found Scott in the living room. He looked to be hiding. "Oh thank Merlin you're here!" he cried out. "They're batshit crazy in there changing the colour of the walls! For the love of Morgana, go make them stop!"
"We could. Or –" Charlie pulled two miniaturized Nimbus brooms from his pocket. "– we could take to the air. You game or you too soft from sitting behind a desk all day, Auror Potter?"
She flipped open the phone and quickly read the barrage of messages he'd received. The name at the bottom immediately caught her attention:
! Honestly, Potter? No, I felt the need to rid the world of evil or there were still Death Eaters that needed to be stopped?"
"You're about as subtle as a bludger to the head." Harry grinned at Draco's outraged expression. "Let's see; first there was the newspaper over breakfast, then the address for the robe shop, which conveniently was next to the article about the auction at Christies…should I continue?"
"It's my turn for cuddle time, Mr Selfish." He softened the teasing words by stroking his hand down over Harry's bicep. "So, what is this with the partial nudity?"
"Oh, this is just perfect. Not only are the trains not running, but the Knight Bus finally shows up with the greatest arse of all time at the wheel."
—earlier. I haven't even seen the contract. Although I did keep hoping that after meeting with Astoria the entire
Harry stared at the elegant profile as Malfoy continued to stare out into the night. "What if," he began, feeling heat and desire collide uncomfortably in his chest, "I'd like to fix that."
"I tried to do that," she said, helplessly watching the baby cry. "Healer James said it's so much better for the baby, but I really couldn't manage and then the baby would cry." Draco stepped over and took the baby from her arms and began to rock with her.
Harry barely suppressed a snort. He'd only just laid eyes on the old man, but was fairly certain the
Draco sighed. "Not while you have a witness, at any rate. And as much as I hate to be indebted to you for anything, I hate being wet even more."
"So maybe you should ask him what you've done wrong, and see if you can agree to work things out once he tells you."
Another painting featured the Eden River where it flowed beneath the St Lawrence Bridge, and one of Glamis Castle. In the latter, heavy, dark clouds hung overhead, and snow was deep on either side of the long drive that led to the stately building. He bought it on sight because it reminded him of Hogwarts at Christmas, where some of his best childhood memories had been made.
They had just left the medical centre and were heading down a long corridor, when Harry heard voices calling out greetings.
He loved Ginny, he really did, but she was incredibly competitive. He wasn't surprised at all when she was signed by Holyhead 'five minutes after she finished at Hogwarts', or when she was promoted to starting Seeker before the middle of her second season. She had worked for it, earned it, and Harry knew she didn't expect him to roll over and play dead for her. At least no more than he expected her to for him.
Draco stepped closer until there was barely any space between their wet bodies. "Oh I passed mad about an hour ago. Then there was furious, livid and considering tearing your skin off – one strip at a time."
He opened his eyes to find her still studying him, almost as if she'd never seen him before. After a waiting moment, she grinned and went up onto her toes, kissing him on the cheek.
He happily took their daughter but did notice the odd expression that crossed Ava's face as she handed her off.
he thought, recalling how Harry's mood would swing like a pendulum when he was pregnant. He was drawn from his musings when Lily spoke again.
"The reason I don't take you out in public is because going anywhere in public, unless I go Muggle, is a nightmare and I didn't want to expose you to that. You just say the word, Draco; I'll take you anywhere you want to go. But I thought you understood how much you mean to me."
Draco sighed and walked to it, intending to call out to Potter to pick his rubbish off the floor. But when he picked it up, the softness of the worn wool seemed to caress his fingers and he caught the faint aroma of broom-handle wax and something a bit woodsy, that always seemed to follow Potter. A quick glance told him Potter had gone, and he was as good as alone in the room. His heart was pounding in his chest. Not sure what made him do it, he stuffed the scarf inside his robes and walked out of the courtroom to begin his life without magic.
." She made a shrugging motion. "I tried to tell her I'd never seen you with a red and gold scarf, but she was quite insistent. In fact, had she not been properly strapped in, she might have run over to him—she was that determined."
Draco wasn't sure he could pinpoint the exact day he knew his marriage was falling apart. He supposed it had been slowly happening for years. Astoria changed after having a child, and it wasn't necessarily for the better. She became more selfish, self-centred and wanted little to nothing to do with her daughter. Now, Camélia was nearly four and a half and was, like most nearly-four-and-a-half-year-olds, a handful. Between working all day and caring for his daughter in the evenings, he felt like he was stumbling through life in a perpetual fog. He'd long since given up trying to keep track of his wife.
their little girl from them. At least that's how Harry saw it. The night he'd asked for Lily's hand had been a trying one. After nearly an hour of the poor boy taking a grilling like only Potter could deliver, Lily finally stomped into the study and announced to Harry she was marrying the young man, whether he liked it or not. Once they left, Draco reminded Harry how terrifying it must be to face the vanquisher of a Dark Lord and ask for his daughter's hand.
"Well someone certainly pissed in your Chocolate Shreddies this morning." Pansy glowered. "It would serve you well to remember that I know
They'd spoken at the same time and stopped at the same moment. Immediately on the heels of their voices tapering off, the sound of rapid little footsteps coming down the stairs made them both turn.
"Thank you, that's all I ask," Draco replied. "And Simone, you're always welcome to come see your granddaughter. However, the nanny is not yours to dismiss—even for the day."
"So you want all of daddy's attention, do you?" Harry murmured. At that Clare's face scrunched and she began to cry. "Oh, um…so much for that plan." He got to his feet and began to walk and rock her as he'd seen Draco do when she was fussy.
It was a pleasure to watch Potter's high cheekbones go pink. "About how you might be here," Draco said, suddenly afraid he'd been the one to bring Harry there. Maybe his longing had finally overcome his lack of a wand…
"No, you don't get it, you pillock. I want to stay, but I'm not ready to share you with everyone. And if I stay, Charlie will no doubt tell the entire Weasley family what's happening and dammit…
Harry did. He remembered locking them in a stall and urging Braydon to his knees, where he'd opened Harry's jeans and proceeded to start an extremely skilled blow job. That was fine, but it wasn't what Harry wanted.
Harry turned the question over in his mind. "I feel free. Like I'm invincible and I can do anything. I love to feel the wind racing past as I climb higher and higher. Then the thrill of swooping back down, just to do it again." He shrugged, smiling. "I like to think while I fly. It's a good place to sort out your head."
Narcissa sighed. "Yes, well. Alright. It's not exactly the contract. It has to do with your grandmother Malfoy's will." She paused, and he could almost see her picking at the sleeve of her robes, the only nervous tell the stoic woman ever displayed. "Should you marry and produce an heir before you turn thirty, thereby continuing the Malfoy line, you will inherit your grandmother Malfoy's vaults."
Hermione moved to sit on the ottoman in front of Harry. "Be honest with me. Do you like being an Auror?"
"Of course I do," Harry shot back. He started to speak again and just let his head fall back onto the couch. "Honestly? Not so much. When I first started it was exciting. I felt like there was purpose to my job. Ever since I moved into training… I just feel old. There's a Bryant in nearly every class and I'm tired of having to prove myself to some twit who's still wet behind the ears."
"Might wanna have your arse at the door next time. If we decide you get to eat again." He gave Draco an evil glare. "Better try to eat something, they'll be coming for you soon."
"Ah ah ah," he said. "Picking a fight and stomping off doesn't work on me any longer." He stroked his thumb over the taught arm beneath Harry's mint green button down. "Talk to me."
no big deal." He gave Draco's bare arse a pat. "Time for me to go before I start acting on the ideas I have for that bare arse."
onto the top of Draco's textbook, then kept going to the counter, putting down the takeaway bag and reaching into an upper cupboard for plates.
Atkinson shrugged. "No clue. I hear Beecham got an order and him and Holden went right off and brought him in."
He opened then closed his mouth, struggling to find the right words. When Draco spoke it was so soft, he almost missed it.
Ginny caught the Snitch shortly after that. They played another game and Harry found he was doing fairly well against someone who practiced nearly every day and was hellbent on playing professionally. He caught the Snitch that game and as the light was fading, they decided to call it a draw.
"You want him to give it to you. Yes, I know." She laid her hand on his arm. "He isn't going to. Now, what's more important, letting Potter fail in this because you're too stubborn, or getting the piece you've only wanted for the last five years?"
Draco caught James' sleeve and pulled him into the sitting room, and Harry huffed but picked up the other two plates, following Ted reluctantly into the small kitchen. He found his godson leaning against the counter, his hands propped on either side of his narrow hips.
The windows at the front were larger, now floor to ceiling with translucent sheers that let the light in with grey velvet draperies pulled back on either side. The sheers enhanced the light, made it soft and warm. The walls were covered in soft grey paint with a pearly patina, and it was huge, much larger than Harry remembered. There was a marble fireplace with a dark wood mantel, and there was a pot of Floo powder on the hearth. Then he noticed that the furniture filling the space was all his. From Appleby. All of the furniture he'd purchased for his team flat: the large crimson sofa, the chairs, the art on the walls. And his giant telly was affixed to the far wall.
"Draco?" Astoria asked, with a bit too much forced breathiness in her voice. "Is everything alright?'
Harry turned and looked into Draco's eyes. Merlin, his pupils were still blown and even with a light sheen of sweat on his face, he looked so damn hot. "Err…no. You don't." Harry blushed, and not just from their recent adventures. Draco gave a quick sharp laugh, then pulled Harry into a kiss.
He picked up his wand and sent his Patronus to Hermione. "Nothing wrong, but need to see you. Come by as soon as possible." He sat back and smiled. Time to set his plan into motion.
"Har, Har," Harry rolled his eyes, and resisted the urge to stick out his tongue. "I'll take that as a yes." His tone softened. "Why did you become a Healer, Draco?"
They'd been living separate lives for so long now, Draco hadn't been surprised to find out through the nanny that Astoria was leaving shortly after he left in the mornings. Most days she had returned by the time he walked in the door, laying on a chaise reading
allowed. But that's not the point. The point is Harry is always trying to figure out what to get me for my birthday. So, I thought this year I'd make it easy and leave some ideas."
Harry had never told a soul, not even Ron and Hermione. They knew he was gay, but not that he had a thing for their long-time nemesis. As he stood staring up at a man who couldn't be Malfoy, longing made his throat feel tight. Where was he, Harry wondered. How was he managing without magic? The cruelty of it made him feel sick. How was a pure-blood, who had lived with magic every moment since his birth, supposed to survive? Or wasn't he?
"And then I was afraid I'd actually say something totally inappropriate or maybe I'd say something about one of the scenarios swirling through my head." He rubbed his hands on his thighs. "And I wasn't sure you'd think really going on a date with me would be as good of an idea as I thought it would be."
"Draco heard that," Draco called from the sitting room. "Don't make me sorry I stood up for you." Harry shook his head.
"Sounds good, but only if you stop at an off license and get a good bottle or two of wine. I'm not drinking any of the rubbish you have in your flat."
"There he is." Darian leaned to his side then was back, placing glasses on Harry's nose. The room beyond Darian swam into focus. Ron was standing just behind Darian's shoulder, leaning forward.
"Children," Windbarm began, "there are no losers in this event. Every one of you has made an important contribution to our world and nothing can diminish that contribution. However, there were three of you that truly excelled in your work. I want to add that choosing the top three out of you five extremely talented witches and wizards was not easy. There were less than ten points separating the top three places. So without further ado and beginning with third place, Maisie Collins, with her improvements to the
. Shortly, he saw Malfoy step back with Toby at his side. Malfoy put his arm around the small shadow and drew him close, bending to speak into the boy's ear. Then Malfoy turned and gracefully left the stage.
"I wasn't studying to be a Potion's Master at the time. I wanted to be a stay-at-home dad until she went off to Hogwarts. She isn't going to be able to interrupt her studies until the baby is eleven."
Draco slowly unfolded the parchment and stared down at his mother's beautiful script. It reminded him of his first few years at Hogwarts, when life was simple… when he was still a wizard. Melancholy washed over him as if he'd been caught in a quick burst of rain in the spring. It fell hard and heavy and was gone just as quickly. One thing he'd learned, and learned quickly after his sentencing, was that self-pity was a waste of emotion. Not that he didn't have more than his fair share of days spent in utter despair of his situation. In the beginning it was all day, every day. But Flimsey was a hard task master and refused to let Draco wallow in self-pity. He thought of her fondly and hoped she was enjoying life in Paris, back at his mother's side.
"Caffeine. You're an addict. And whatever I said," Darian reached out and curled his hand around Harry's bicep, "I'm glad it had that effect."
reports from people who couldn't keep their own stories straight. The perp was tall, short, had long hair, and had short hair. He was blond or a brunet, one even stated he was bald! Harry slammed the file shut and rubbed his hand over his face. With one final glance to his still dark screen, he stood, stretched and made his way to bed, still not understanding exactly what happened.
"Oh, sweetheart," Darian said a bit sadly, turning back to the stove and laying rashers of bacon in a cast iron frying pan, "here's hoping you remember that when you've seen today's paper."
Draco raised his head high and spoke as clearly as he could, "Yes, sir, I understand and accept the terms and conditions set forth." As the clerk who had led him into the room approached the table where his beloved hawthorn wand rested, Draco closed his eyes. He heard the spell being murmured and felt some of his own magic siphoned away as he if could
He waited. Up ahead, Miranda gave them an apologetic look and added a second tray for the front man's order. Hermione pulled in, then released a deep breath.
Soon Charlie was banking to the right and flying towards the ground. From the air, Harry got a quick glimpse of the reserve. He managed to see it was very large and contained a number of penned off areas. As they landed, Harry noticed the temperature was warmer than he'd expected.
He was about to flip to the last page, when a number caught his attention. He blinked several times, quite certain he was seeing things. Hermione's gasp told him he'd not read it wrong.
They had Scott and Lily over for Sunday dinner around the beginning of Lily's sixth month. Draco and Scott were relaxing at the table, watching as Lily and Harry put the finishing touches on dinner.
Draco tried to think of an answer that wouldn't sound ridiculous. He couldn't come up with even one.
"Put these on," Darian handed him a pair of grey joggers, and it was the first time Harry realized he was completely naked, "then come to the kitchen. We need to talk."
“I am sure that those of you in fifth year and above will remember the last attempt at a duelling club,” many minds flew back to Gilderoy Lockhart and his fiasco of a club. “However, I can assure you all that this competition will be nothing like that at all.”
“We must put our best duelists forward in order to beat all of the other houses and bring the cup, where it belongs, to Slytherin!” A number of the students cheered their support.
The night of the grand draw was supposed to be full of excitement and intrigue, but it instead turned out to be an utter disaster for Slytherin. Draco had been damn sure that his grand plan to bring glory to the house was going to work perfectly but that idea was firmly squashed thanks to lady luck.
As the flames burned brighter and brighter there was a loud knock on the front door. Just when Draco thought the flames were going to burn his skin, they vanished completely.
“Oh come on, Harry. Bright light before he killed the dragon. Probably a bright green light. Ring any bells?”
With another deep sigh and a check of his golden pocket watch, the man stood, whispered a few well chosen words, turned on the spot and vanished.
Under normal duelling circumstances Blaise would have won easily, however his epic duel against Baddock had drained most of his energy and he was clearly sluggish against the much fresher Pansy. Draco had studied Blaise for many years, his form, his poise, his grace and positioning. For instance, Draco knew that a spell aimed at below Blaise’s waist would normally see the boy twirl away like a matador to avoid it. Draco also knew that Blaise did this to deliberately toy with and mock his opponents. Only against Pansy he seemed to lack the energy to move much at all, opting to block and deflect incoming spells rather than dodge. After a minute or so of being on the defensive and getting nowhere, Blaise opted for offense, and just like Baddock, Pansy crumpled under the sheer power and volume of Blaise’s spell casting. It really was a sight to behold, the usually calm and composed Blaise going, what Draco called, Full-Italian on people.
“But then, Sir,” he said hesitatingly. “Would that not mean that...that I am the current Lord Black?”
Nott took his place at one end and 20 feet away stood Baddock, both boys with wands drawn at the ready.
Draco did not like spending too much time in the common room of late, he was very aware of just how many of his fellow students had parents in service to the Dark Lord. Negotiating his remaining time in the house would be a very careful game of politics but fortunately Draco was a master of that particular game. Instead of heading down towards the dungeons, he climbed the staircase to the fourth floor and pushed open the heavy doors of the library. Draco headed to the far corner and took a seat at his usual small table by the window and started to read his letters.
He felt the air ripple as he stepped through the wards which marked the outer boundary of the Burrow. Harry was safe and now he needed to make sure things stayed that way. Turning sharply on the spot, Dumbledore vanished into the darkness.
He caught up with the other Slytherins as they were getting into a carriage up to the school and wasted no time at all in regaling them with the story of how he had just broken Harry Potter’s nose. The stupid Gryffindor would be back in London before anyone found him, what an excellent way to start the new school year.
Harry’s look of confusion had quickly turned into suppressed giggles as Draco had recounted his encounter with the odd men, until he could barely contain them by the end.
Once the door was closed behind them all, Draco crept to the door and bent low to listen. McGonagall really was an idiot, Draco thought to himself. If Severus were holding a meeting of this magnitude in his office he would surely throw up any number of privacy spells. McGonagall had done nothing, no silencing charm, no Imperturbable charm on the door, not even a Muffliato. He could hear all the voices inside clearly enough to make out every word that they were saying. He listened to the story that the unknown girl was telling and only just managed to spring back to the niche as she was dismissed to the hospital wing. He had to wait for her to round the corner at the end of the corridor before he could make his way back to the keyhole where he heard Potter’s voice.
“Of course, that’s why you married me. So why do these people keep saying homosexuality is bad? I love you more than anything in the world.”
Idly he wondered if his presence would be missed anywhere, he had yet to feel the burn of the Dark Mark on his arm so perhaps not. His mother was staying close to her sister and didn’t spend a lot of time at the Manor these days. No, his brain reasoned, he would not be missed. He got up and started pacing again, trying to avoid the prickle of tears that this thought was bringing forward.

Before he’d even managed a hasty “Good evening,” Dumbledore had grabbed him by the shoulders and bellowed into his face. “What on earth were you thinking you idiot boy? Katie could have died!”
‘Ah.’ Said Dumbledore again. ‘Well Draco, we cannot simply hide you away, the Death Eaters will be too suspicious and someone else will be sent to accomplish your task. No, in order to maintain your safety we must continue as if you do plan to kill me. I can think of a few ideas as to how you can be seen to be trying, even if unsuccessfully so. In agreeing to do this, you must pledge yourself fully to the side of Light, renouncing all of the Dark as well as the Malfoy name and title if necessary. If you do not wish to continue, we shall Obliviate all knowledge you have of the last 4 days and send you back home. Do you consent to the plan?’
‘Thank you, Draco.’ A smile played across Snape’s face, something which very few students had ever seen him do before.
“Oh. Draco, you have just ruined this day for me. I can't believe you just said that.” Harry threw Draco on the floor and stormed out.
He only managed to read through the small note once before it turned to dust in his hands. He had recognised the handwriting as soon as he saw it and had no doubt that other Slytherins would have also noticed their Head of House’s writing.
‘I am sorry, Draco.’ Dumbledore stared down looking kind-faced at the boy struggling to regain his footing.
“I dare any person here,” Draco’s voice rose in volume again to quell the murmuring. “To challenge Baddock to a duel right now if they feel that he does not warrant his place on the list.” Draco had seen the younger boy fighting with a Ravenclaw, his power was extremely well developed for a mere 3rd year.
“I am loyal to the house, Nott. As you should be. But if you wish to challenge, I will not stop you. Clear a space!” He bellowed the order to the room at large and the sea of people before him parted to leave a rectangle of clear space in the middle of the floor.
From the inside of his robes he pulled a scroll of parchment and handed it to Draco. Breaking the seal and unrolling it, Draco was somewhat disappointed to see that there were only five words:
When Draco finally opened his eyes the whirling colours had stopped and he was in an unfamiliar room. Small, dark and dank, it reminded him a little of the dungeons at Hogwarts. With his head still spinning slightly he got up and started to pace around. Not that there was a lot of room to move; he could only take a handful of steps before having to turn and start again in a different direction. The room was pretty bare and had a small lumpy looking mattress along one wall, a tiny table and chair in one corner and a suspicious looking bucket in the other.
“No? Then lady and gentlemen, I will see you this evening at the competition. Good day,” and with that he abruptly stood, turned sharply swishing his cloak in a way that would make Snape proud, and stalked away towards the entrance hall. Draco didn’t even consider turning around, but if he had, he’d have seen Nott filling his empty chair and a whole lot of solicitous muttering going on in the silence that he had left behind.
The young man was stood on a barren hill-side. The view of the surrounding landscape was bleak; he allowed himself a hollow laugh. Bleak was certainly the most appropriate word for his situation at the moment.
“I challenge!” Draco had expected it to come from the floor but instead it was Theo rising out of a leather wingback chair on the far side of the room.
The old man dropped the tiny piece of parchment down on the desk and leaned back in his chair with a sigh. The writing was miniscule, as if the writer had been trying to use the smallest scrap of parchment that he could and wanted to limit any chance of it being spotted.
‘That’s for my father!’ He froze momentarily, a horrified look on his pale face. The Unbreakable Vow, he could not cause lasting damage to Harry Potter and live. Moments seemed to tick by, the bleeding boy frozen on the floor and Draco, frozen too, standing above him. As more seconds went by Draco relaxed; he was not dead. Breaking a nose must not count as lasting damage. He sighed, thinking that this little test of the limits of the Unbreakable Vow has certainly proved to be worthwhile. He could still hurt Potter, as long as there was nothing permanent. He grinned maliciously, drawing the cloak over his enemy and making sure to tread on his fingers as he left.
He grimaced slightly. It was Snape’s latest way of “politely” summoning him to a meeting with Dumbledore. He had thought this was coming, there was no way that Dumbledore wouldn’t want to question him after the incident. He ladled some beef stew onto his plate along with some mashed potato and green beans but within 10 minutes he realised that he had hardly eaten anything and had simply been mixing the food into a brown mush on the plate.
“Draco? Are you hungry? I can make you something if you like.” Harry curled up against his  boyfriend of 8 years. But instead of replying, Draco just took a slice of toast off Harry's plate.
‘I am to give you instructions and then return you home. Would you prefer to eat here or back at the Manor?’
“Harry, what’s this weird red thing in the bathroom?” Draco called through to his husband, who was tidying their clothes away after the previous night.
“It's not your birthday, it's not my birthday, it's not our anniversary, so what are we celebrating?” Draco drawled in his best Lord of the Manor voice.
‘Help you? Why on Earth would I help a Death Eater?’ the voice was not dripping with spite as it could have been but Draco heard it nonetheless.
“What’s a Mormon?” Draco cast his mind back to any mention in his vast schooling for even a mention of the word ‘Mormon’ and found none.
“Not quite, religions are mostly about bringing people together as a force for good rather than evil.”
Again another long wait, Covid and a new job getting in the way of me writing. Thanks to everyone who is still reading this, please do drop me a comment at the end to let me know if you like the way this is going.
And he stamped, hard on Harry’s face, feeling the nose break under his foot, blood spattered everywhere.
“The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black,” Draco reeled off. He had of course been taught all of the details of the Great Houses from a young age.
He let his mind drift away from his body, wander away from the study to dwell on the young man. Where he was, the old man could not be sure. Oh he could guess, of course, but never be actually certain. The minutes rolled by and still the old man pondered.
“I don’t think so Theo. We can’t have someone enter after pulling a stunt like that. If you’d beaten Baddock, or even managed to last longer than one spell, well I might have been persuaded to change my mind. But as it is, we are not going to have someone like you representing this house."
Even after a solid night’s sleep, Draco was still fuming the next morning when he dragged himself out of his warm bed and opened the green velvet hangings surrounding him. The icy air that rushed in from their dungeon dormitory stung his face and sent a morning shiver down his spine. Quickly collecting his wash bag, Draco made his way in silence to the bathroom door and slipped inside one of the empty shower cubicles. Draco always took the left most of the three cubicles for the water drained all the way down to the other end, there was no way in hell that he was going to stand in dirty water that had washed off of Crabbe’s body!
“Now, it is getting rather late and I am sure that the first and second years must be just about ready for bed, and the rest of you,” a slight pause and a chuckle. “Well the rest of you will enjoy the remainder of the evening in spirited discussion no doubt. Good night, and sleep well.”
‘I thought that it would be best if we had regular meetings this year. You can appreciate, I’m sure, that you are a valuable source of information for the Order of the Phoenix.’ Draco stood, his face impassive.
There followed a short statement of the known holdings of the Greengrass family. Draco did not even bother reading it, everything that was officially on the books with the Goblins never covered even half of what a family owned. It was merely for show, a formality, and the true figures would have been discussed by his father and Claude Greengrass. He could picture the scene now, his father in his study behind his enormous desk negotiating the marriage of his then infant child. Draco shuddered slightly at the thought of it.
“Oh, yes.” Within seconds, Harry's tongue dove into Draco's mouth trying to get rid of the taste of the Marmite.
Draco Malfoy may have been cool, sophisticated and debonair; he was not, however, a morning person. Before he dressed himself and sorted out his hair, Draco was just like any other person in the mornings. Hair jutted out at unruly angles, his eyelids hung slightly closed and he seemed to have lost the ability to speak.
Draco nodded weakly and motioned to the hard chair in the corner. He may be a prisoner here, but he still had his manners. Dumbledore shook his head slightly and with a wave of his wand vanished all of the furniture and with another flick conjured two handsome looking leather wing-back chairs and a small table between them.
“What? What did I do?” Draco was immediately on the defensive after seeing that wild look in Harry’s eyes again. The look that hadn’t been there for many years.
“Crabbe and Goyle, you next!” Snape thundered over the noise of the house. The two massively overweight boys lumbering up to stand in their positions on the platform. They bowed to one another but instead of rising up and casting spells, they charged, like a pair of bull elephants. The whole room winced with the noise of flesh on flesh as they collided and rather than using wands, four ham sized fists became the weapons of choice. Draco looked over at Snape who didn’t seem interested in putting a stop to proceedings so watched his two dorm-mates trying to pummel each other into submission. It went on for far too long in Draco’s opinion, by the end, Goyle had a cut above his eye and was bleeding heavily but Crabbe was the one who was finally knocked unconscious by a powerful right hook from his best friend. Goyle tried to get to his feet to celebrate but didn’t even have the energy for that. With the blood gushing down over his face he collapsed next to Crabbe, breathing hard.
Draco gasped as he slipped the ring on, he felt the resizing charm adjust it to fit his slender finger but also the wave of tingling power that swept through his body when it was settled in place.
It was perhaps lucky that Draco was breakfasting alone at the Slytherin table when no less than four post owls landed on the table in front of him. If any of his housemates had been there, the sheer volume of post that Draco was now receiving on a daily basis was sure to start to garner attention. As it was, there was a small group of older Ravenclaws who seemed to be studying as they ate, what looked like a family of Hufflepuffs celebrating a birthday and a few lone Gryffindors. He took the four scrolls and laid them carefully next to his plate of pastries and fruit, whatever was in them, he decided, could wait until after breakfast.
‘Well?’ his voice calm despite the thunderstorm raging around them. ‘What message does Lord Voldemort have for me, Draco?’
Draco, not needing to be told twice, gathered his things and left the office, but instead of leaving, decided to secrete himself in a niche a little way down from the now ajar door. He was rewarded for his patience a few minutes later as McGonagall returned, leading Potter, Granger and the Weasel along the corridor with an older girl that Draco did not recognise towing along behind them.
“No! Don't! It's... ” But it was too late. Draco had taken a big bite out of the toast, a look of sheer horror sweeping across his face before he began spitting out the offending food all over the floor.
Nott had toppled over and dropped his wand as the spell had hit him. Draco pointed at Crabbe and Goyle who were both sat on the floor nearby.
‘The Headmaster is waiting, Draco, you will return within an hour through the same passageway. No one will know where you have been. If anyone asks, you are having additional lessons with me, it will not be difficult to convince your classmates that we are doing work for the Dark Lord.’
“Just press the top harder.” Draco did, and jumped as he managed to completely cover his left arm in the white substance. “That’s a little too much, love.” Draco shot Harry a look that seemed to say ‘make another sarcastic comment like that and I will set you ablaze!’
Draco who had been waiting just outside the door for Harry’s reaction, sidled back into the room. “Just a little revenge. Don’t worry, it’ll grow back.” Draco took his towel off and got into the shower with his irate husband. “Besides, I think I like it this way.” Draco worked his hand down Harry’s now smooth chest and squeezed his rapidly hardening cock.
“Stupid boy! You were supposed to bring it in yourself, Mister Filch would catch you and bring you straight to me so that I could destroy the necklace myself. Voldemort would have found out you had been caught and were clearly trying hard to complete your mission. The girl could have died, Draco. You need to be more careful.”
The note requested a meeting, it was very likely to be a trap, or at the least some sort of trick, but if it was genuine he had to know. He had to find out.
‘They are gone’ Snape stated simply as he drew the door back for them to exit the cell. Draco was only now becoming aware of just how much he had been sweating with nerves.
At exactly 8am, Draco was finishing his final bite of a heavily buttered crumpet as Crabbe and Goyle took their seats opposite and started to pile food onto their plates. The seven other Slytherin duellists were grouped together, all eagerly awaiting Draco’s instructions.
I am aware that this has taken far too long to write. The prevalence of Coronavirus has seemingly dented my creative side.
‘Severus, I have told you this before. I am never late. Nor am I early. I arrive precisely when I mean to.’
“To that end. I have decided that we will only be placing eight names into the Headmaster’s nomination box, there will be no surprises when the draw is made. Once those eight names are in, I will be sealing the box permanently so that no one else can enter. We will be entering those four people I know to be exceptional duelists, myself, Zabini, Harper and Baddock.” Draco gestured towards each in turn with the 3rd year Baddock looking especially pleased to be grouped in with such illustrious company despite a slight murmur at his name.
A/N I've decided to add this note as a few people do not know what Marmite is. It is a spread made from yeast extract usually for toast and occasionally sandwiches. Its tagline is "You either love it, or you hate it". That is so true. I've not yet found a person who is indifferent to it. I personally love the stuff, however, my best friend hates it.
“I am very impressed that you came to this conclusion so quickly, Draco. I had rather expected to have to guide you to this epiphany step by step. As a male descendant of the House of Black, it is indeed possible that the title is now yours. There are two tests that we can perform to ascertain if you are right. Firstly, you should be able to correctly write down the address of the London residence of the House of Black. Secondly, you should be able to summon the remaining family house-elf, Kreacher. Shall we try that now?” Dumbledore reached under his desk and drew up parchment, quill and ink before sliding them over to Draco.
“OK, but if anything goes wrong like the time when you lost the keys to the handcuffs and left our wands downstairs, I’ll kill you.”
Once some of the hubbub had died down, Draco eased himself off the wooden bench to lead the Slytherin 6th and 7th years back down to the Snake pit, their common room deep in the dungeons. The handful of older students took all of the best leather armchairs which were scattered around the outer edge of the room and as they arrived, all the other students were directed to take seats on the floor; the well established procedure for a house meeting.
‘What do I care?’ he mused, ‘Just some new stooge of Dumbledore’s. If you really feel the need to suck up, Blaise, then you should go.’ Draco knew that his taunts wouldn’t stop Zabini from going, but he tried to get in a retaliatory jab back for his comment.
A few quick flicks from his wand and Snape at the two boys on stretchers and sent magically through the corridors to the hospital wing with a note for Madam Pomfrey.
‘Ah. I see.’ Dumbledore looked thoroughly unconcerned at the notion of his murderer sitting across from him. ‘And you do not wish to accomplish this task that Voldemort has set you?’
“Yeah, come on. I'll tell you about it.” Harry lead Draco into the lounge by the hand and sat down on the love seat and pulled Draco down on top of him.
‘Now young Mister Malfoy,’ Dumbledore switched into a much more business like voice, ‘how might we assist you?’
“You two,” Draco yelled over the noise of the now running showers. “Duelling competition meeting at breakfast. 8am sharp. Don’t be late.”
“KREACHER!” Draco yelled loud and clear, some of the portraits on the wall woke with a start. But that was the only thing that happened; no elf appeared. ready to do Draco’s bidding.
‘There is no message. Please?’ the voice of the young man was begging, he sounded terrified. ‘Please, you have to help me!’
Draco awoke the next morning still locked in the windowless cell. Dumbledore had told him, after his mother and aunt had left, that he would only have to stay for one more night before being sent back to the Manor. He shifted on the lumpy mattress, clinging to the blanket that had been his only source of warmth overnight. He was annoyed at Dumbledore but more so at Snape, surely he could have done something to make Draco’s stay more comfortable. He simply was not used to those sorts of living conditions.
‘How dare you!’ Draco spat at him, scrambling up from the undignified position sprawled on the floor. ‘What right do you have to invade my mind like that?’
‘You must forgive my rudeness Draco.’ Draco’s hand moved to grip the back of the nearest chair, expecting to be offered a seat. But before he could reach it, Dumbledore’s arm whirled through the air and Draco heard the old man cry,
After a particularly extravagant meal, Dumbledore took advantage of the post-dessert lull to get to his feet and wander around the back of the staff table to stand at the owl-fronted lectern in front of the whole school.
“Excellent!” Dumbledore beamed, his arms stretched wide in a welcoming gesture. “Now I believe I gave you your first instruction already. Would you kindly make this cushion fly?”
“Hell, no. What kind of child would have a dick this size, Harry?” he said as he started stroking his husband.
The women did not stay long after performing the ritual, Bellatrix seemed that she had the assurances she wanted from Snape and Narcissa had Snape’s vow to protect Draco. Both Dumbledore and the boy crouched at his feet had remained silent and undetected, both let out a low slow sigh when Snape opened the door to declare the house to be clear.
The old man looked down upon the younger man, noticing with a grim pleasure the similarities to the meeting all those years ago.
As if the very thought of his godfather had summoned him, it was at that very moment that Snape pulled the door open and beckoned Draco into the living room.
Thinking of just discarding the library books on his table he stood up, intending to leave for the owlery and find Uther. But as he did so, there was a tapping on the glass beside him; his owl was perched on the ledge outside. Opening the window Uther hopped inside and held out his leg with a message. Without even reading it, Draco took it from the bird, attached his letter to the Keeper of Names and fed Uther an owl treat from his pocket before holding his arm out of the window and allowing the owl to take flight again.

Draco took his place at the Slytherin table for the start of term feast feeling immensely pleased at getting one over on Potter. He wasn’t really paying too much attention to the sorting before he realised how hungry he really was. Mid-way through the feast he glanced up to watch curiously as Professor Snape exited the side door of the raised platform at the behest of Filch. Five minutes passed before the large oak doors of the Great Hall creaked open and Harry Potter slid into the room trying desperately to look inconspicuous, a feat almost impossible considering that the front of his Muggle clothes were drenched in blood. His happiness vanished instantly, would Potter tell Dumbledore, he had been foolish and now risked expulsion; he would not be sent home, he would refuse to go.
“As I am sure you are aware from your father, this signet is to be worn on the little finger of your left hand. What I am sure that you are not aware, is that this ring is imbued with very particular powers.”
Proof-reading help might be on its way soon. Bear with me and my awful punctuation and grammar until then!
A whirl of memories flooded through Draco’s brain, not expecting the attack on his mind, he was not able to put up his usual shields. The surprise nature of it meant that he couldn’t even marshal his thoughts.Wild images flashed through his mind seemingly unconnected, his father, his mother, his first broomstick, his Hogwarts letter, Harry Potter, Quidditch matches, his dormitory, Severus, Harry Potter, Voldemort, Harry Potter. Dumbledore pressed harder into Draco’s mind searching through his memories trying to get to his true feelings. The memory of stomping on Harry Potter’s face was dragged forward, the feeling of horror at what he had done was being amplified by Dumbledore’s magical power. Draco felt the shame creeping up his neck, concerned at how awful he was feeling for what he had done to the other boy. Not just for the fact that the Unbreakable Vow might have killed him for it, but for the fact that he felt genuine remorse. Was that Dumbledore’s doing? Or was that how he genuinely felt deep down.
“Begin!” Draco roared and the two boys swung their wands forward and cast their spells at the same time. Nott’s Stupefy was perfectly aimed, straight and true, right between Baddock’s eyes. Or at least it would have been if the younger boy hadn’t already been ducking when Draco commanded them to start. It is significantly easier to move your head out of the way than it is to move your entire body; especially if that body is full of smug determination to best a “lesser enemy”. As it was, Baddock’s full Body-Bind hit Nott squarely in the chest causing his arms to snap to his sides and his legs to spring together. The rogue Stupefy merely hit the stone wall and dissipated into nothingness. It was over much quicker than Draco had thought it would be, however, he was pleased that his choice was vindicated in front of the whole house.
‘I had every right!’ Dumbledore boomed, his voice filling the office entirely now. ‘The very fate of the Wizarding world might depend on you, Draco. The end of Lord Voldemort and the survival of Harry Potter might be in your hands. I had every right to check what your truest intentions are.’ Dumbledore’s power seemed to hit him in waves along with the words. Draco flushed slightly at the mention of Harry Potter and the number of memories that Dumbledore seemed to drag from him. All those furtive glances when Potter wasn’t looking, oblivious to Draco’s observation.
“Very well. We have decided as a house to alter the Headmaster’s conditions for this event. It will NOT be open to all.” A few younger students looked sulky but did not speak out. “This is to maximise our potential at winning and bringing glory to the house.” Draco’s voice was getting louder as he went on, a technique he learned from his father to engender support for his words.
With Crabbe and Goyle still in the hospital wing, Draco privately thought they’d be there for some time even under the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey, Draco was given a bye through to the House final. Despite having finished his duel less than two minutes ago Blaise was summoned to the platform, loudly protesting that he needed a rest. Draco thought he was right to need one, sweat was still pouring down his dark skin. Zabini’s protests were cut instantly short as Snape ordered him to bow to Pansy and get on with it.
Harper was very good, Draco thought as he flung jinx after jinx at his opponent, not just at duelling but putting on a show. Draco would have bet a fair few galleons on the fact that only he, Harper and possibly Snape knew that Harper was deliberately missing with every single spell that he sent at Malfoy, only ever by an inch or two, but enough so that even if Draco could not block or deflect the spells, that they would not find their mark. The cries of “ooh” and “ahh” coming from the assembled house made it very clear that no one knew the duel was rigged.
Draco’s detention with McGonagall was predictably dull. She lectured him for a full ten minutes on the importance of not falling behind so early on in his N.E.W.T. work, before forcing him to sit at a desk and complete the missing homeworks. She did not seem to grasp the idea of detentions, Draco thought. They were supposed to be awful, a punishment, a deterrent. Snape’s detentions were legendary, disgusting manual labour usually involving rotten potions ingredients. Even Dumbledore knew how they were supposed to work, having sent him with the Gryffindorks into the Forbidden Forest back in first year. But McGonagall was just a push over, she walked around with her nose in the air acting like everyone but her precious lion cubs was beneath her contempt. He sat there working on other homework, having completed his Transfiguration work quickly. He had vaguely hoped that if he handed her the completed work quickly that she might let him go sooner. But she had taken it from him and motioned back towards his solitary desk to continue working.
“Amongst the Muggles, there are a number of groups called religions. Each has its own followers with their own beliefs and ideals.”
“Congratulations, Mister Malfoy,” Snape said quietly as he checked over the unconscious Zabini, “And do take note, that is how you manipulate a duelling competition!” Snape waved his wand to rouse Zabini before standing up and striding out of the Great Hall without another word to any of them.
“Don’t worry about it, just try to be more sensitive next time.” Harry pulled Draco close to him and hugged him tight.
“I guess it didn’t work. I must of got the movements wrong. Oh, well.” Draco bounded out of their bathroom with a huge smirk on his face that Harry clearly didn’t see.
The look of unbridled joy on Draco's face showed Harry that he would soon forget about Saint George and his stupid dragon.
The words seemed to float right over Draco’s ears, even minutes after he heard them he was sure that he would not be able to repeat anything that the Headmaster said. He was dragged back to full attentiveness at the introduction of Professor Slughorn who was apparently there to teach Potions. That must mean Severus had finally gotten his wish, Draco thought. A fact confirmed moments later by Dumbledore announcing Snape as the new teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Just a little sulky that, despite all the time they had spent together over the summer, Snape had not thought to inform his godson of the happy news; Draco led the raucous applause from the Slytherin table. Grinning broadly as he saw Snape wave a lazy hand to acknowledge the applause. Draco knew that the man needed to retain his cool exterior but also deep down that he was utterly thrilled to finally get the post he had so longed for and Draco was happy for him. Of course bloody Potter had to go and ruin it, the uncouth oik had yelled out, obviously desperate to draw away even more attention. Stupid git!
Draco’s lessons with Dumbledore had gone from painfully dull interrogations to a fascinating study into wandless magic. Draco was enthralled by the whole thing and spent most of his spare time in the library researching the scarce amount of knowledge passed down on the subject. He was filled with a feverish thirst for knowledge, one that he had not experienced since Severus gave him his first potions book and kit. Of course he didn’t dare ask the vulture-like Librarian for help as he had been told explicitly by Dumbledore to keep the existence of the ring to himself. Dumbledore had placed a glamour over the crest so that anyone glancing at it would simply see the Malfoy coat of arms and assume it was Draco’s by birthright.
At the height of summer, the days were sweltering but with the heat and humidity, storm clouds were brewing.
Severus did not even speak to him as Draco passed through the Potions Master’s office and through the phoenix portrait towards Dumbledore’s office.
The majority of Slytherin house rose to its feet and trudged away to the dormitories, some first and second years looking even more grumpy than before. A small queue of people formed in front of Draco who surveyed each one in turn, sizing them up. Theo appeared in the middle of the line, seemingly released from his Bind by Pansy, he was holding out a piece of parchment with his name on and made to put it in the box. Draco’s hand leisurely moved away from his side, blocking access to the slot.
‘I will,’ said Draco for the final time. A third lick of red flame burst from Snape’s wand combining with the other two, twisting around the clasped hands like a fiery snake.
“In London, but no one is sure where. Unlike Malfoy Manor, the location is only known to members of the family.”
By the time that Halloween came around Draco was thoroughly miserable. He was getting weekly requests for updates from his contacts outside of the castle and he was really no further along with his mission to fix the Vanishing Cabinet. Montague had proved to be useless with regards to information on how it actually worked after his extended period stuck in the blasted contraption the year previously. Draco was spending an increasing amount of time in the Room of Requirement, books spread out at his feet just trying to understand how the magic of the cabinet worked.
The Zabini vs Baddock duel was immense, Draco was watching raptly for a full fifteen minutes as the two boys tried to best each other. A number of curses flying through the air that would usually see students suspended or even expelled, but Snape wouldn’t care, Draco was sure of that. Parts of the duel were a tactical cat-and-mouse game, parts were sheer force of spells with both boys clearly desperate to win. In the end it was Blaise’s ability to cast faster than Baddock that won it for him, pinning the much younger boy under a barrage of spells which forced him to lose footing, still trying to defend from a prone position on the floor Baddock tried desperately to get back onto his feet but Blaise finally hit him with a nasty jinx causing Baddock to lose his wand as he shrieked in pain. There was no handshake of mutual respect between the two, Draco could see that Blaise was furious that a mere third year was able to resist for so long and drain him of so much energy in the process.
The cheers from the crowd were deafening. It took the rest of the team just a moment to cotton on to what was happening, but when they did, there was no mistaking their triumphant smiles and fist pumps in the air. The Appleby fans were screaming, ecstatic. The team did a low flyover of the stands, Harry making sure he flew right over Ron's head. He couldn't help but wonder what his best friend would think of his decision once her husband told her what happened.
When they returned to the dining room, Harry and Lily had the food on the table. Lily walked over to Scott and wrapped her arms around him, leaning her head on his shoulder.
Draco sat up slowly, then shifted to his feet. "Why do I feel like I'm not going to like this story as much as I liked the last few minutes?"
Harry turned to the table, feeling everyone's eyes on him and Darian. "Look, I've got to get to the pre-game meetings—Wood likes to check in with us the night before a big match—but feel free to stay on here. Miranda will look after you and Darian—"
Lily looked weary and pale but elated. "Daddy, Papa," she began. "During these last months, I finally realize exactly how much you both sacrificed for me." She raised her free hand to stop any protests. "I know you did it willingly and with so much love." She looked directly at Harry. "Daddy, you are my rock and my hero. I love you so much for everything you've always done for me, all the times you were there. For the fun and the horrors of my teenage years."
Immediately her eyes filled with tears. "I knew you were going to be cross with me," she sniffed. "I didn't understand how the Muggle system worked. It's so different from ours."
Harry cut Ron off before he could finish. "And if you want to stay mates, you won't finish that sentence."
Crossing his large, muscular arms across his chest, Beecham leaned back in his chair. "Awfully nice place you've got for a Death Eater without a pot to piss in after the Ministry was done with you."
Deon stood, hands on hips and shook his head. "For a wonder-boy, you're a bit slow. What makes you think you're staying here?"
"He— Hello," he said shakily, his trembling hand stroking its head. "I'm very sorry, I have no owl treats but I promise if you come my way again, I'll make up for it. You have something for me?"
"Well, if they aren't, they should be." She shook her head. "It was such a strange time. Ordinarily and arguably rational people voted for sentences that made no sense at all."
"Alright, Harry. Here are the facts," Healer Stewart said, and his brogue reminded Harry of McGonagall. It was comforting, in counterpoint to his expression. "You suffered a devastating spinal injury. Because you have the good fortune to be a wizard, we were able to counteract the damage. Don't mistake me: if you were a Muggle, you'd have no feeling from the waist down. With help from your magical core, and with time and rehabilitation, you will be able to walk, run, and even fly a broom again. Most, if not all feeling will eventually return to your lower extremities, and the fact you have feeling in your thigh, is a terrific sign." He paused, then took a deep breath as if he needed to take a moment. Harry didn't find that remotely reassuring. "What you have to understand, and I am deadly serious about this, Harry, is that your days of playing professional Quidditch are done."
Totally unconcerned about their witnesses, including the one bound on the floor, Harry gave Draco a slow, lingering kiss, then stepped back.
"You're kidding yourself. Potter watched you like a man obsessed for half of sixth year. He probably knew what colour pants you were wearing on a given day. And he's an Auror now, so he would have to be better at remembering things."
Once Harry had returned his Portkey, he turned to take a good look at Charlie. Charlie's face was tanned and he was muscled. He had a few scars on his arms Harry figured were work related, but Charlie looked good.
Hermione made a high pitched sound of delight, and Ron leaned on the foot of the bed. "That's good, Mate!" he said. He looked at the Healer. "It is, innit?"
Two days later, he left a note, along with the torn out page of the newspaper, on their kitchen table.
"Thanks, Gin," Harry said, giving her shoulder another squeeze. "I'd a feeling you'd be all for it."
A few hours later Draco was savouring the last sip of his third—or was it his fourth?—Firewhisky, listening to the fire crackling in the hearth under the sound of coffee-table jazz playing quietly on the stereo.
Reading back a little further, he wondered if perhaps there was something there? In the very least, he did feel a little bit guilty for not replying and ignoring the poor guy. He'd considered deleting the messages and his contact altogether, but he couldn't bring himself to do it.
"All right, sweetheart. Papa is going as fast as he can." That apparently wasn't good enough, however, and she arched her back, going from slightly discontent to furious in seconds. She had amazing lungs, this one, and Harry winced away from the screaming next to his ear. One of her hands curled in the black chest hair on his right pec, and she pulled,
Draco looked up, his mouth hanging open and began to shake his head back and forth. "No," he muttered, "no…Harry." He looked over at his husband, at Harry's grin that stretched from ear to ear, then back down at Thomas.
The Leaky was doing a brisk lunch time business, and he returned Hannah Longbottom's wave as he exited out into Muggle London. He slipped his hands deep into his pockets as he stepped into the flow of sidewalk traffic.
"It's stunning," he said, truly moved and amazed, and he saw the entire group release a held breath. They sighed in relief and laughed, Darian dropping down onto the sofa and putting his feet up on the ottoman.
To think Malfoy, the same Draco Malfoy he'd known in school, had spent the last year helping this boy learn about plants and making things grow, affected Harry more than he understood. Who was this Malfoy? What Harry did know was that he was captivated by him, and he wanted to get to know him better.
Harry turned to argue, but the words wouldn't come. He looked at Draco as he bent to pull his socks from his long, thin feet. It simply amazed him that even after living together for nearly two years, the man continued to take his breath away.
Draco was vaguely aware of Pansy's grip on his arm, manoeuvring him into the empty bench at Harry's booth. She placed a gentle kiss on his cheek.
Their lips met, as gentle as a whisper. Harry'd never been a big believer when his friends had told him that so and so's kisses were electric. Merlin was he wrong. Seconds after that first brush of lips, Harry's hand moved to Draco's waist, tugging him closer. When Draco's tongue ran across Harry's bottom lip, he moaned and his lips parted. Zoya could have landed behind Harry and he'd never have noticed he was so intent on that kiss. Draco's tongue did wicked things to Harry's mouth, and after what was either a minute or a week, Harry stepped back. Panting. Draco smiled at him with lips that were plump from being thoroughly kissed.
Harry shook his head. "Merlin, no. I don't want that job. It's all paper work and sitting on your arse. No, John Dawlish can have it, with my blessing."
Harry sat back. "You could, however, stop grinning at me. It's not my fault. I looked up at you when you came and hell, you looked so damn hot. All it took was my own hand on pressing down on my cock and it tossed me over the edge."
Draco walked down the hall to the nursery. Even before he reached the room, he could see bursts of colour flashing. Standing in the doorway, Draco watched as Harry would cast the spell to make the walls the colour that Lily was calling out. Just when he was about to demand they stop, Lily collapsed in the only chair in the room in absolute fits of laughter.
Harry laughed because he knew Draco would insist on playing Seeker if he got there first. It was an old argument. Harry quickly finished the report he'd been dawdling over, jotted some notes and waved his wand over it, sending it off to Robards' in-box for review. Then he hurried toward the door before hesitating, turning around and scrawling a note to Draco and leaving it in the middle of his desk. Feeling only the tiniest bit of guilt, Harry rushed out the door and off to the pitch.
"I could live the rest of my life without the thoughts of you and Hermione having sex, thank you very much." Harry shuddered.
"Pansy needed to go into work, but she asked me to be certain you were pleased with how the furniture and things were arranged," Philippe explained. "It is good, yes?"
Philippe sighed. "Now that you have effectively made it a big deal, Pansy darling. Draco, can we perhaps sit?"
They spread the food out on the table and sat on the floor. Hermione inspected the label on the wine bottle, nodded, and handed it to Harry.
Draco had been very insistent and aggressive during their lovemaking, so much so that Harry had jokingly told him that it didn't matter how often or how enthusiastically he fucked him, he wasn't going to end up pregnant.
"Oh, I do," Darian said emphatically. "I have a very clear memory of what happened between you and the wizarding press last night, and I intend to make it clear to them you weren't entirely at fault. I can even provide a Pensieve memory if my word isn't enough."
There was an uncomfortable silence before she spoke again. "What time will you be here tomorrow," she asked softly. "It takes me a bit longer to get up these days."
Draco was right on her heels down the stairs until she reached the entryway, where she whirled on him. "Stay back, Draco," she hissed. "I mean it."
"What can I get you?" Potter said. Once again, that new, deeper voice moved along Draco's nervous system. How must it sound in bed, he wondered, then could have kicked himself when his cock sat up and took notice. He was grateful for the long coat.
"I've had a lot of beer," Ron muttered and to Harry's relief, his and Hermione's conversation ended.
, darling, but you need to find out what the hell they were all about because you need to hire a solicitor, now. And Daddy will pay for it if you can't."
"You'll remain in hospital for at least forty-eight hours. Longer if the Healer feels it's warranted due to your repeated head injuries. Now I suggest you eat and get some rest." Barnes set the tray on the table near Harry's bed, rolled it into place, and lifted the lid.
Harry noticed Draco's wand movements had stilled, then heard a very familiar voice call out. "Your remarkably talented Healer is working his arse off to save a life over here. Think you might find a moment to lend a hand transferring him inside, Weasley?"
"And lots of queer men marry straight women. As long as she knows what she's getting into, you aren't being dishonest with her. I also seem to remember you telling me once that you desperately wanted children." She gave him a sad smile. "You'll need a woman for that, darling. Magic can accomplish a lot of things, but having an heir with another man isn't one of them."
discussed it more than I have today, we're doing it in a bed. Yours or one we rent in town. But I'm not going to have my first,
After Windbarm's speech, each child stood and gave his presentation about his project. The first three were interesting; the little girl with the dark hair and serious expression told the audience how she had increased the effectiveness of the Tergeo charm so that several messes could be cleaned at once. The boy Harry decided really needed back off on the sticky toffee pudding spoke in a monotone about his work on the Waddiwasi spell to make it less prone to cause damage when the
He was surprised when Darian patted him on the hip. At some point Hermione had fallen silent and Harry startled and blinked, shocked to find he must have drifted off.
"You've been in a magically induced coma," Darian went on. "They've been trying to stabilise the injury to your spine."
"That child? That child is our daughter. She's a part of us. She's a small child who doesn't understand what she did that makes her mother dislike her so much."
Harry shook his head. "I agree. We need to take our time, do this right. Because if I'm lucky enough to ever have you?" His eyes were full. "I won't be willing to let you go."
Harry rolled his eyes at her. "Cute. But you know I'm right. We all know Hermione can be a bit…let's call her opinionated. So rather than things coming to blows in your parent's kitchen, I opted to diffuse the situation and bring you outside."
She blinked in the sudden light, startled, then her expression smoothed. She lifted her chin. "How do you know it's anything?"
Draco watched as the jubilant Auror team lead him to the ground, cheering and shouting, pulling him off of his broom to pat him on the back and shake his hand. They lined up to exchange handshakes with the good-natured team in black, then as everyone else headed for the side lines, the bloody fool stood at the centre of the pitch letting the rain drench him.  All the anger, all the frustration he had felt about Harry sneaking off to play Seeker washed away in the rain, now that Draco knew Harry was safe. Then what he was seeing, standing there in the monsoon like rain, caught up with him.
Draco scowled. "I'm not in the mood for telly tonight. And I don't care about dinner. I'm not hungry."
"What did you want, Ludo?" he asked. "I thought I made myself abundantly clear about the possibility of us seeing one another again the last time you were here."
He strode past Atkinson, then stopped and turned back. "Thanks for the heads-up, Atkinson. I'd better go and see what kind of shit-storm they've created."
The sound of glass crashing came from above and from below, and Draco could hear tables being pushed over. My potions, my lab! he thought. His mind was racing and for a brief, mad moment he wondered if he'd be able to Apparate… without speaking a word or using his wand.
He turned to look at her. "And then she was gone. Everything was gone and there was no one to turn to. I couldn't turn to my friends— it was all too humiliating. At least then it was. So yes, my pride was all I had left and I wasn't going to give that up for anyone."
"So I was told," he said, trying to sound unemotional. "I'm glad you've had some time with my girls this afternoon."
Harry's voice was hard. "What the bloody hell is going on here?" His eyes shifted from Beecham to Holden and back again. With a
Harry thought about it. He'd been recuperating at St Janet's for more than two months. Was there anyone else he needed to thank?
Pansy lifted the lid to uncover what appeared to be a hearty stew of some sort. She laughed at the slightly apprehensive look on Draco's face. "Oh, don't look like that. I fire-called daddy and had their elves put something together."
Harry grinned, throwing his leg over his broom where he stood. "I'll see what I can do." He grabbed the gleaming black teak handle in both hands, grateful for the warming charm in his team gloves, and kicked off the ground.
Astoria in ways to make Draco lash out at her. But Draco had already decided that he'd put up with what was necessary to keep his marriage intact. He was even considering telling Astoria he didn't mind if she took a lover, as long as she started being discreet about it. He knew Pansy would explode and say he was being stupid. However Draco saw it as being pragmatic. He was nearing the end of his sentence, and keeping a low profile was his number one priority—okay his number two priority. Nothing was before Camélia for him.
"It's my life's goal," Harry deadpanned. "Come on, handsome, let's go before the dragon man changes his mind, and feeds both of us to Zoya as a snack."
There was a long pause. "Does your grandmother's money make it… easier to abide by the terms of the contract?"
"It was about to buzz itself off the desk," her tone defensive, "I saved it from crashing to the floor."
Finally the Beater was able to yank his hand free. "Speaking of pricks," he hissed right into Harry's face, "who do you think you are?"
Harry watched Draco, looked beyond the self-assured exterior and realized Draco was nervous. And although neither of them was about to declare undying love – Harry realized if he ended things right now he'd spend the rest of his life wondering
Draco studied him pensively from where he sat in a large wing-backed chair next to the fireplace. "You know you'll always be her first hero, Potter."
Draco was nearly doubled over as he struggled to keep his laughter under control. They were in a Michelin star rated restaurant, after all. He sat up and dabbed at his eyes with his napkin. "Oh it really was. Quite funny in fact and it served you right."
Ron winked at his wife, then his expression changed. He looked at Harry, then back at Hermione again. Then he groaned.
"Oh, my love, I've known about that for years. Since your crush on that awful Bulgarian Seeker. What was his name?"
"You're all mad," he said, but Draco could see him fighting the smile that was trying very hard to slip across his face. Draco reached out with his foot, teasing the back of one of Harry's legs.
"Draco, my young friend, she loved you. That is reason enough. I have my home, my boys have theirs. My uncle, Sophia's husband, acquired a fair bit of property. We are asset rich, I believe the phrase is? At any rate, this is a wonderful way to keep the stately old place in the family. And it suits you, I believe." He glanced at Philippe, who nodded in agreement.
"Morgana's tits, Charlie! Don't you know better than to surprise an Auror?" Harry pulled back enough to smack Charlie's shoulder. "You're lucky I didn't hex first and ask questions later!"
"For Merlin's sake, Papa, stop fishing for something that isn't there. We just want to have dinner with you, although I certainly can't figure out why at the moment." She laughed and gave him a saucy little wave as the connection closed.
For the first time since they'd come running to help, Charlie really looked at Deon. Charlie shook his head. "Circe's tits, babe, you're not looking that good yourself. Should I be sending you to hospital along with Rhet?"
The Healer handed the chart to Oona. "I can tell from scans of your head and upper body that you're no stranger to a rough match. Right?"
"Granted I was a bit of a terror as a child, I've apologised more times than I care to remember for turning your hair blue. Let it go, for fucks sake." She grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him back to the parlour and onto the couch, holding on to his hand when Draco tried to pull it away.
"I assume you mean photos," Darian said as he stood and went to fetch the coffee pot. "You did break the man's camera."
"They're from him. We had coffee and a very long talk, and that's all I'm willing to say." Pansy opened her mouth, and Draco held up his hand. "
"That's brill! I can't wait to see them." Harry's voice dropped. "Do you think Draco will be unhappy I came back?"
Harry went inside Charlie and Deon's cabin and froze. "Oh sweet mother of Merlin, what the fuck am I doing?"
"We're going back to the hotel for a few hours, mate," Ron said. "Hermione's got to head back home, but we'll be back before dinner, yeah?"
Slowly, Harry turned and set his wine on the nightstand. Then he took Draco's from his unresisting hand and did the same with it. After that followed the plate of food, until once again there was nothing between them but the frightening, stultifying silence. By the time Harry reached for him, Draco feared he'd die from the tension.
He knew that. He also knew she'd wondered where the ardent lover of her wedding night had gone, even though she'd never asked. And he felt a bit guilty about how disillusioned she must be. It really wasn't fair. But then, in his experience life rarely was.
As Draco slid the cloak on, the fireplace flared green and the unmistakable sound of Pansy's voice rang through the room. "I swear on my Jimmy Choo's if your ass is not in my flat in the next five minutes…"
"What, the headline?" Darian asked, flipping the bacon. Now that Harry could see him, he was struck by how cute he looked, wearing boxers and a hoodie that was three sizes too big, baby fine blond hair tousled soft around his face. It took Harry a moment to realise Darian was, in fact, wearing one of
"All I've wanted," she said, sounding muffled, and congested, "was for us to be together. I'll handle Mummy. Tell Ava to come for morning tea on Friday. If I do like her, we'll hire her."
He got out of the shower and towelled off, standing nude in front of the mirror while he worked some of the expensive styling products Darian insisted he use through his hair. The mirror whistled at him, and Harry gave it a quelling look.
That was true, he supposed. It was perhaps one way this would work; she would have her life, he would have his. Not sexually, but in all other things. The idea of cheating went against the grain, but in their friends, and their interests, perhaps… then he had a thought. "I feel it's only fair to you that I be blunt. You do understand what my sentence means?" She studied him, her brows raised, waiting. When he spoke, his voice was low, but firm. "It means living as a Muggle. Not playing at being a Muggle, but actually
He did, but Draco didn't think it was the moment to try to convince him. He took the few steps that separated them, stopping less than a yard from his husband of nearly thirty years.
"I date," Hermione replied defensively. "Stop trying to change the subject. We're discussing you, not me." She sat back in the chair. "And we were discussing you taking a holiday."
She clapped Harry on the shoulder and exited through the dim shop's front door, and Rob made a sound of disgust.
"Whatever it is, Pans; I can deal with it." He turned to her, and realised he was actually wrong. This was the verge of too much.
As they drank a few beers, Harry told Ron all about the Arrows facility. Ron filled Harry in on the latest at the Ministry and what he was up to in Auror training.
He curled his hand around the newel post, heading toward the large, main sitting room just off of his formal dining room. He stopped in the wide doorway left by the open pocket doors, watching Pansy and Walden Greengrass squaring off in front of the fireplace, Simone sitting in Draco's armchair, Astoria perched on the ottoman near her feet. Philippe stood behind Pansy and what truly alarmed Draco was that he looked as angry as Draco had ever seen his mild-mannered friend, flags of red riding his high cheekbones. They were so involved in their argument none of them even noticed Draco.
"I figured." Darian kept walking, pausing when he touched a blank-eyed skull on one branch. "Does this mean they died?"
"Breathe, Harry," Charlie laughed. "We're all adults here. If you want a holiday fling, go for it." His tone became serious. "But if you're doing this as some sort of fucked up revenge for who he was at Hogwarts, I promise you'll be sorry."
"Honestly Harry, you're so handsome, but you don't do anything to accent it. Would it kill you to buy some new clothes, get a haircut, and get out there?" Hermione continued over Harry's protests. "And I know you." She grabbed his hand and rubbed her thumb over his knuckles. "You're sitting around, feeling guilty about Malfoy even though you
Harry and Lily were so caught up in their discussion about pregnancy cravings, they barely acknowledged when the two left the room.
"Draco, I don't talk about my personal life with anyone else. You know I end up in the rags if I blow my nose." Harry stared at him. "Is that why you'd think something so stupid? Because I haven't told anyone?"
. As in hooking up with someone just for sex. And Merlin fuck…I sound like some bint asking if you'll respect me in the morning."
Harry could agree with Hermione enough to acknowledge that driving the Knight Bus was a way for him to hide away from most of the wizarding world. Now that wizards were driving their own cars, most of his clientele consisted of the older witches and wizards who weren't interested in the expense of owning their own vehicles, and were afraid to learn to drive one. He drove for a stag or hen do on occasion, but always under a Ministry-approved glamour. There was still the occasional drunk or stranded witch or wizard, but most of them didn't much notice 'Harry Potter' was driving their bus.
He smoothed the crumpled envelope on the countertop. He ran his fingers over the 'A' embossed in the upper, right corner and wondered how he'd feel if they didn't at least want him back for another try-out. He remembered how fantastic it felt to be in the air where nothing below existed. Where he wasn't 'Harry Potter: Dark Lord Vanquisher' but 'Harry Potter: Quidditch player.' Where he was in control and his focus was a little gold orb with wings that flitted about, waiting to be caught. It was so simple, so straightforward.
"Charlie! Merlin! Oh fuck! Weasley get your bloody arse over here. A branch has fallen on Potter." As he hollered for Charlie, he removed his coat and threw it over Harry's leg.
"No, it's okay," Draco answered quickly, his hands curling into the back of Harry's heavy red wool robes.
They talked idly about his work and thankfully Draco had a few funny anecdotes to share with her. She laughed lightly, her hand moving gently over the curve of her belly. They stayed for a bit over an hour, but even he could see that she was growing tired. He wondered if it was the pregnancy or from not doing much the last few months. But he wisely kept his thoughts to himself.
Draco pushed up with his hips, rubbing his cock against Harry's chest. Harry hummed and shifted lower still. "Now," he said smoothly, "isn't this a lovely thing."
"Morgana's saggy tits, Draco. Open your mind to the possibility. He practically said to you 'Hey, I'm Harry Potter!' Look here," she scrolled back several messages. "Here!" she pointed to the screen.
He couldn't simply ignore the fact Ted had spoken to him, not if he wanted to be able to walk. Draco kicked him again, and Harry shot him a glare before looking up. He saw James watching him first, his expression dangerously close to what it had been just before he cried when he was a kid, and Harry felt like a complete and total arse. He averted his eyes to see Ted standing behind James, two plates in his hands and steady, watchful expression on his handsome face. Harry had often wondered if this is what Remus had looked like before life, and Greyback, had left their mark. Of course, Remus never had turquoise blue hair with white stripes.
Harry laughed out loud. "You may be many, many things, Healer Malfoy," he pushed the cabin door closed behind them and wrapped his arm around Draco's waist. "Easy will never be one of them."
He shook his head. This was getting him nowhere and he knew Ron wasn't going to be patient much longer. He slid a finger under the flap and opened the envelope. He was surprised to find it held several sheets of parchment, when he was expecting only one.
"Yes, I will." Draco gave Philippe a wan smile. "And now I must go call my wife and begin the wheels rolling to get her and our child back home."
. He'd almost recovered from his disappointment when he formulated his newest idea in his quest for Harry to give him the perfect gift.
The Portree fans screamed in fervent protest as Harry flew into the heart of their formation, sending them all diving in different directions. Harry clenched his teeth; what he once would have avoided, he now flew directly into. He knew it was probably reckless and spared a thought for the other team, belatedly hoping no one plowed into the field, but the only thing he cared about right then was grabbing the Snitch and ending this fucking game.
He was about to apologise when he saw the moving picture now face up on the table. He clenched his teeth and glared at her.
He found her lying in bed, watching the telly. She'd never had one before in her life and was rapidly becoming addicted to reality television, particularly dating and talent shows, something he couldn't understand at all. The furthest he had gone in that direction was the Great British Bake Off. She looked up at him wanly, and he forced himself to bite back some of his initial fury.
With his time so completely monopolised in Appleby he didn't get home to see Ron and Hermione and the family very often. As he showered after practice on this Friday afternoon, Harry whistled. Tonight he was going to be seeing his family, all of them, and he could hardly wait.
"So," Pansy asked, "how'd he convince you to take the money?" She laughed at Draco's glare. "Oh please, darling, even I'm not foolish enough to think Potter gave up after one try. Not to mention, you'd be dead if you'd not accepted his help."
"I'm sorry," he said, words muffled by his hands. And like she'd done so many times during their last year at Hogwarts, Pansy pulled Draco into her arms and held him while he broke down.
"Yeah, he's going to be paying for that for a long time." Draco enjoyed the satisfaction in Harry's eyes. "Deciding to use you to get back at Robards was probably the dumbest thing he's ever done in his life. He's lucky Hermione was with me as witness; it kept me from kicking him square in the balls, which is what I wanted to do. Oh, and Beecham and Holden are paying, too. Gawain has been suspended without pay until Kingsley and the legal team can figure out what to charge him with, but Beecham and Holden got the sack."
She broke away and stepped to the fireplace. "Let me know how it goes tomorrow."  With a flash of green light, she was gone.
Draco looked around as if he expected someone from the Ministry of Magic to pop into his kitchen and arrest him for using magic. "You have to go!"
Ron looked up. "Merlin's pants you two!" With a wave of his wand, the window opened and the tawny owl flew into the room. "You act like you've not had owls deliver the post to you for the last nine years or so."
Draco called toward the kitchen, "We'll be right back. I want to show Scott an article about the new Seeker for the Arrows."
"I'm really sorry you had to lose a friend like that." Harry laid his hand on Draco's arm, rubbing gently.
He picked up the picture and carried it with him to the downstairs parlour. He feared with everything that had occurred today, he'd not be able to sleep. He knew he'd never again sleep in his old room filled with memories and ghosts of the past. He recalled lying stiff in the dark, dreading the sound of footsteps outside his chamber's doors. He'd spent a year in abject terror, just waiting to be called and forced to do unspeakable things. He couldn't do it; there was nothing in that room that was worth the memories attached.
A couple of long, slow tugs brought his cock up half hard, and he poured some of the expensive conditioner into his palm. Sliding his foreskin back and revealing the plump pink head of his prick, he curled his palm around the base then slid his hand up and down slowly. The tip of his dick was extremely sensitive, and he rubbed it between his thumb and first two fingers before making another long, slow stroke along his palm. The vein along the lower side of his cock was swelling, and his heartbeat began to speed with the tempo of his strokes. So many times, he'd imagined Potter on his back beneath him, or him on his back beneath Potter. It didn't matter; somehow he knew either way it would be the best, most memorable sex of his life. Even if the sex wasn't earth stopping, getting skin to skin, heart to heart with Potter would be worth – anything, everything.
Maisie moved to the front and accepted her trophy, but Harry could see just the tiniest wibble in her chin, as if she were trying very hard not to be disappointed. He was surprised by how disappointed he was for her, even while he wanted very much for Toby to win.
had come from, he'd best not explore right now. "Slow down. Again, in the span of a few minutes, you've surprised me." He tempered his words with a smile. "And what you can't possibly know is that right as you knocked, I was contemplating hijacking a broom and flying into the town alone." He shrugged. "I'd appreciate having someone who's familiar with the area to go with me."
"I understand, you absolute shagging wanker of a piss-brain." She cuffed him on the side of his head. "You total bleeding bastard! You're a fucking menace!" She hit him again, this time on the shoulder. "I thought. Harry. Had been wounded. Or worse. Killed." She punctuated every few words with another punch to his body.
It was going to happen that day, Draco’s first attempt. He was suddenly clammy and nervous, if he failed then the Dark Lord would be informed and be very angry at him. If he succeeded somehow, then a dangerous dark object would be taken out of circulation and destroyed by Dumbledore but still the Dark Lord would be angry at his failure to kill the old man.
“As I was saying, myself, Zabini, Harper and Baddock will be the first four names entered. Anyone else wishing to enter will instead place their name into this box.” Draco pulled a similar looking box to Dumbledore’s from under his chair. “I will draw four random names to be our final entrants. No first or second years will be allowed to enter. If you are drawn to face any of the senior four then you are expected to lose. We do not have control over what order the names are chosen, so what we can control is this. If you volunteer to take part and you are drawn against myself, Zabini, Harper or Baddock you must lose. With that in mind, you have 10 minutes to enter your name into this box. Meeting over.”
“No, Draco”, Dumbledore explained. “True wandless magic is, as I say, very rare. With enough training and practice, you will be able to do your usual magic but using the ring as the focal point and not your wand. If anyone were ever to break open this ring, firstly they would likely die from the explosion of raw magic, but should someone else come looking through the wreckage they would find that this ring contains a unicorn tail hair, a dragon heartstring, and a Phoenix tail feather. Or at least that is the rumour regarding the source of the ring’s power.”
‘Is safely locked away in Azkaban.’ interjected Dumbledore, stopping the boy mid-rant. ‘Although I am sure that he would be intrigued to read the note that you sent me Draco.’ Those bright blue eyes pierced into Draco’s grey ones and again seemed to dampen down the building rage with the not too veiled threat. ‘May I sit?’ Dumbledore’s tone lightening slightly.
There was no window in his cell; no way of telling the time. He slept and he ate when food arrived, never making the mistake of leaving the plate unattended for a few minutes. The food disappeared and left him achingly hungry until the next meal. He even relaxed his standards to use the bucket although thankfully the contents vanished at once after use.
Sagging back into the comfy chair that he had occupied for the last few hours Draco popped the seal on the message and read:
The Slytherin sixth years had long since changed into their school robes when Zabini returned. Draco with annoyance as Blaise failed to get the compartment door closed, resulting in a lot of loud bangs each time the door jammed. It was as if the door did not enjoy its rough treatment and it sprang back, wide open, sending Zabini into Goyle’s lap. Draco saw, out of the corner of his eye, a flash of white but looking around when the chaos died down, there was nothing white that could have moved that fast. He pondered on it for a few seconds before he lay back down with his head in Pansy’s lap.
“As Dumbledore has seen fit to mess with our plan, we will have to follow a new path to glory. This one, is in fact, much more simple; there are only two rules.”
Snape looked down at the boy, mentally restraining his rising ire at Draco’s remark. ‘I spend the vast majority of the year, as you well know, at Hogwarts. I do not have time, especially these days, for cleaning.’
“Do you mean that I will be able to do wandless magic if I am wearing this ring?” Draco asked slightly in shock.
“Well, most religions believe that homosexuality is a sin and that after we die, our souls will go to hell, which, by all accounts, is not a nice place to be.”
‘How dare you keep me like this!’ he spat the words viciously at Snape. ‘I am a Malfoy. My father...’
“Well, on 11th September 2001 some terrorists hijacked a number of planes and flew them into some big buildings.”
Looking for someone to assist with proof-reading and correcting my woeful prose. Anyone interested in helping me out?
‘Good evening, Draco.’ The boy jumped almost imperceptibly and turned his head sharply to see the old man sat behind his desk looking pensive.
What he badly needed was a distraction. Some bit of fun to take his mind off the approaching horrors. Rather luckily for him, the distraction came that evening, after the Halloween feast.
Draco’s hands shook as he slowly reached into his robes and pulled out his wand. He stared at it for a few moments before holding the tip and placing the handle in Dumbledore’s outstretched hand. With a loud crack that seemed to rend the sky, the old man vanished taking Draco’s wand with him. Scared and alone, the young man watched as a golden feather fell slowly to the ground from where Dumbledore departed. Hesitating for a fraction of a second he reached out a hand and let the feather come to rest in his palm. The second it touched his skin Draco felt that familiar tug around his navel and was pulled into the howl of wind and whirl of colour that could only be a Portkey.
Draco milked Blaise for information about Slughorn’s gathering, being careful not to let his disappointment at not being invited show in his voice or on his face. As soon as he heard that Slughorn was trying to cosy up to well-connected types, he was not surprised to hear that McLaggan and Belby were invited. Of course, bloody perfect Potter had been there, but the Weaselette and Longbottom? What on earth was Slughorn playing at inviting those two?
It was so early when they arrived at King’s Cross that he actually witnessed the Hogwarts’ Express pulling onto the platform before opening its doors ready to receive students. It didn’t take long before Draco was sat in his compartment surrounded by the few people that he might have considered friends. Pansy was stroking his hair, which he always liked, Crabbe and Goyle were laughing their low chuckles whilst reading a comic book, and Zabini and Nott were talking quietly in the corner. Inside he was conflicted, knowing that he had betrayed his “friends” was not a pleasant thought but now that he came to think of it, were they really his friends. Crabbe and Goyle were just stooges, as their fathers had been to his father, Pansy supposed that one day she would marry Draco and become the Lady of the Manor. If he had his way there would not be a new Lady of the Manor after his mother, but then again, despite being a spoiled brat at times, Draco very rarely got his way with any matters of consequence. His father had always made those decisions “for the good of the family”.
‘And finally, will you, to the best of your ability, see to it that no lasting harm comes to Harry Potter?’ Draco’s eyes widened momentarily in fear at Dumbledore’s words
The first few “lessons” that Draco had had with Dumbledore had essentially seen the younger wizard being thoroughly pumped for information.

The semi finals and finals will be… a little different,” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled at this final remark.
