“One day, Draco.  One day you’ll say yes.”
, he thinks, and knocks on the door.
“Oh,” Hermione said.  “It recognized him.”
“Harry is quite good at masking his pain,” Miriam agreed.  “When a child is told he’s worthless, he comes to believe that his feelings don’t matter.  So he’s always-”
Harry’s eyes narrowed.  “What did you just say?”
“Stop.”  Miriam’s voice was firm.  “Harry, it would be detrimental to your healing if you were to experience another emotional upset in front of Cass, not to mention the fact that it would be quite distressing for her.  Cass is safe, I promise you.  Let her other Father care for her, and we’ll focus on caring for you, okay?”
“I’ve no idea, little duck.  Maybe one day he’ll tell you.  Have you decided about spending a couple of days with your Papa and your family?”
“Yeah, I know, mate,” he says, scrubbing his hand through his hair.  “And don’t think that we won’t talk about how your antsy feelings resulted in you grinding on fucking
“Do you often find that people are interested in spending time with you when you stun them and kidnap them?”
“No,” Miriam said.  “You’re doing fine.  Harry is working hard on validating his own progress, and not seeking it from others.
Draco sniffs, and disappears into the back to start some sketches for the amulet Potter wants.  It’s a point of professional pride to ensure that it’s his best work.  He finds himself in the shop, hours past closing, trying to cram as much of the fiddly magic into the tiny pendant.  He tells himself that it’s because Teddy is family, and because it wouldn’t
“Why do people keep saying that?  I guess?  Just take the money, and go take Violet to the zoo or something, okay?”  I want this problem to go away, and I really don't want to talk about it.  If I'm being honest, I kind of want Mill to go away, because she's got a bunch of pent up emotion going, and I don't really know how to deal.
“Yes, I know.  He was a bit confused, mad really.  He thought that you were an enemy, someone who could defeat him.”
“That’s what I thought,” Harry says smugly, and he kisses Draco so soundly that he’s left gasping.  “You know, this isn’t helping me get ready any sooner.”
“Harry, you-"
“So what about during her delivery?”
Harry opened his mouth, as though he was about to answer Draco, but instead, he simply passed out.
“Well, I was sometimes hexed and spat on when I went to Diagon Alley.  It was very difficult for me to find a job, and there wasn’t anyone on either side who wanted anything to do with us.  Those who had supported the Dark Lord thought we were traitors, and those who had supported Dumbledore and Harry thought we were taking advantage of our wealth and privilege.  In a way, they were both right.”
“What are you saying, Draco?”
I scrub a hand over my face, considering this.  It made sense.  I was essentially a walking powder keg.
“Of course I did.”
*************
Scorpius was eying Hermione curiously, and she gave him a warm smile.  “Hello, I’m Hermione.  Would you like to sit down?”  He nodded, and clambered up into one of the desk chairs.  Draco noticed with a little pang that he was still too small to comfortably sit in a chair.  His feet barely reached the edge of the seat.  Draco sat in the chair beside him and ruffled his hair.
“Oh wow,” Harry said.  “That’s amazing.  Are you a seeker?”
“But not Draco,” I confirm.
“And yet, you seem to be very close now,” she said with a cool smile.
“Yes, I’d noticed.  He was entertaining Potter by levitating Great Grandmother Malfoy’s china when I came upstairs.”
Healer Mancini continued.  “With Scorpius, we need to remove some of his existing bone marrow first, in order to make room for the new.  In Muggle procedures, this is done a little differently, but in your case, we’ll be able to simply remove it with a spell.  Next, we’ll remove the bone marrow from Cass’ hip, using a special device.  We’ll use a similar one to insert the bone marrow into Scorpius.  Then, each of you will receive some healing spells, to ensure that there is no infection, and, for Scorpius, to encourage his body to recognize the foreign bone marrow.  When you each wake up, we’ll monitor you for a little while, to make sure you’re healing well, and then your parents can come back in and spend the rest of the day with you.  Tomorrow morning, assuming all goes well, you’ll each be able to go home.  Any questions?”
“No dying allowed on your birthday,” he replied cheerfully.  Cass gave him a saucy little glare, and took off into the sky like a shot.  Draco watched as she soared high, and his breath caught in his throat as she dipped back down and executed a flawless Wronski Feint.  “She’s brilliant,” he breathed.
“Of course I am, Luna.  I know that I’ve been viewed as some sort of public property since I was a baby, but I didn’t think that she bought into that.  I think that old Harry was too trusting.”
“How are you feeling?”
“So, you feel very different things for the child and the adult, wouldn’t you say?”
Madame Lefebvre didn’t seem to notice Cass’ reluctance as Draco paid for the wand, and it was packed into the distinctive Ollivander’s box.  Madame placed it into a carrier bag, and handed it across the counter.  Cass gave it a mournful look, before taking the handles and following Draco from the store.
“I met him!” I exclaim.  “He’s incredibly boring!”
“A Crown Prosecutor?”
She calls Rose, gathers the floo powder and stands facing the flames for a moment.  Mill has remained silent through the exchange, and I glance at her.  Her face is tight, her expression completely closed off.  Just before Hermione throws the powder, she says, “I’ll make some inquiries.”
“Alright.  Here’s the hard part.  I don’t want you to tell me any of the reasons why you can’t have it.  If you feel really strongly about doing so, you can, later.  Right now, all I want you to do is just name it.  Name the thing you most want in the world.”
Rose is yawning, so the Weasleys make their excuses, and disappear through the floo.  I wave my hand and ward it shut, and then set about looking around.  Two hours later, I’ve come to the realization that I’m the most boring bloke that’s ever walked the earth.  The only books I own appear to be about my bloody
“And what have we found?”
“Draco, I never thought you were a coward, but how dare you?  At least be honest about this.  You just left.  Andromeda didn’t say a thing.  She didn’t know anything.”  Harry’s voice wasn’t angry, just desolate.
“No, Potter, stop.  I…apologize for insulting you.  It’s…there, there.”  Draco edged a tentative step closer to the baby and, mustering up every ounce of courage he’d ever possessed, reached out and patted Potter’s arm.  Potter, in turn, lifted his arms beseechingly, and sobbed.  “Merlin fuck,” Draco muttered.  The baby continued to cry, and Draco continued to panic.  It took him several minutes to muster up his resolve, but finally, with a shudder, he picked Potter up and held him at arm’s length.  Potter clung to Draco’s arms, and like an octopus, tried to pull himself closer.
“Ginny,” I repeat, and she looks up at me, her brown eyes shiny.  “I’m gay.  I don’t know if old me was so fucked up he couldn’t see it, or he could see it, but couldn’t bear to give up someone like you.  I can imagine it’s really hard to let go of something that
“As I said,” he replies, looking smug, and kisses me one more time.  “I really have to go.”
He hesitated before unrolling the (much smaller) parchment from Harry.  He know that it might be full of Harry’s vitriol, and he wasn’t looking forward to any of the much-deserved criticism that Harry might be levelling on him.  Eventually, though, the anxiety of not knowing grew too great, and with a sigh, he unrolled it.
“No, they’re fine.  Is that going to be a problem?”
“Yeah, but if he’d done something bad, you would have heard, right?  Like, say he was stirring up a bunch of shite, rallying all of Voldemort’s buddies?  He works for the Bank, Hermione, I’m sure they do a ton of background checks.  He doesn’t even talk to his schoolmates anymore.”
After the hangover potions, they’re beginning to feel almost human again.  Kreacher presses eggs and toast on them, and they manage to eat a little, companionably drinking tea and watching home decorating shows on the telly.
“I’m sorry, darling.  You know that they love you very much, right?  And each other?”
“I’m sorry too.  I wasn’t being fair to you.  And I put you in an awkward position when I asked you to help with Pansy.  It was wrong of me.”
“Malfoy, please.  I know that you and I aren’t friends, and I know that you hate Harry, but he doesn’t deserve this.  It’s going to ruin him if this hits the press.  He…he’s tried so hard, since Voldemort and everything, to be okay.  He deserves a shot.  If you can make him grow up again, I’ll make sure he gets clean, I promise.”  Weasley cast a worried look at the baby, who was still sitting on the floor, placidly examining his hands.  “You got a shot, afterwards, right?  Harry helped you get a chance to change things.”  Draco opened his mouth to say something, but Weasley continued, “Don’t get me wrong, Malfoy, you deserved a shot, and you’ve done really well for yourself.  You proved everybody wrong.  It’s just that, Harry deserves a shot too.  Please?”
“Ready.”
I shake my head.  “No, of course you wouldn’t,” Narcissa says.  “The story of the Enchanted Ring tells of a Wizard who has accomplished much, but is always searching for more.  He is restless, unable to settle, and travels the world in search of more learnings, more treasure.  Deep in a hidden cave, he finds a ring, guarded by a spectre.  The spectre warns him that the ring will bring true enlightenment, but that it will be fleeting, that wixenkind is not meant for such knowledge.  The Wizard thinks carefully, but the lure of the ring is too great.  The spectre weeps, begs the Wizard to consider what will be lost but the Wizard places the ring upon his finger.  For a moment, he is filled with all of the knowledge of the universe, but, the knowledge is too much for him, and his spirit breaks free from his body, which crumbles into dust.  His spirit moves to the nearest living thing, which is a yew tree, where he stays for eternity, knowing everything, but unable to do anything with it.”
Astoria laughed.  “Maybe soon.  For now, let’s let Cici check you out.”
Love,
“Improving it how?”  Harry’s suspicion rose when Kreacher looked quickly to his right.  “Kreacher…”
“We should have a plan.”
“Oh, of course you’re not,” Hermione says, and there’s that tone again.  It’s patient, but not a little condescending.  “But Harry, there’s so much you don’t know, and until you do, we want you to be safe.”
The stalemate continued for two days.  Cass remained barricaded in her room, Harry in his study.  Minerva flitted between the two, pressing food on both of them that was largely ignored.  Harry knew his daughter well.  Like him, when she was injured, she withdrew into herself, erected barriers to protect herself.  Also like him, she rarely reacted when she was bodily injured, but an assault to her tender feelings was a traumatic event.
“Harry,” she says back in the same tone.  He and Luna have been through the
“You’re right,” Violet’s mother said finally. “I despise it, but you’re right.  I can’t go back, can I?”
matter.  Clothes had always been an armour of sorts, and Draco had never felt more in need of protection.  He considered a new set of robes that he’d ordered a few weeks ago.  Would robes simply underline his insistence on his traditions?  A Muggle suit, which he knew looked good, was his next consideration.  But who wore a suit to something like this?  Finally, he gave up in frustration, and struggled into a pair of skinny denims and a cashmere sweater.  It wasn’t something he ever felt comfortable in, but it wouldn’t do to appear as though he’d put too much thought into it.
“Yes, Mother’s gardens are also very beautiful.” Draco replied awkwardly.  “I hadn’t realized that it was something that Grandmother had encouraged.”
“Without his dog,” George supplies.
“It wasn’t like that,” Hermione says, but her voice holds a note of defensiveness that suggests Draco’s not as far off as she wants him to be.  “It was just that we underestimated how interconnected everything was.  It was like trying to unravel a tangle of yarn.  Every memory I touched was tangled amongst another, and all of them so deeply embedded in your psyche that it pulled its neighbour free.  When I finally managed to get myself out of your mind, it was like a wildfire had ravaged a forest.  If I’d had more time, I would-”
“Bring him back?  Malfoy, what do you expect me to do with him?”
“No,” he said.  “She was.”
“And you condoned the plans to surreptitiously exile or eradicate these people?”
“The Department of Mysteries is outside of the Wizengamot and the Minister’s purview, officially.  However, we experiment with arcane branches of powerful magic.  In order to ensure that any one Unspeakable doesn’t breach our oaths of ethics, their peer is entitled to challenge their research.  There are a handful of people who can arbitrate the challenge, including a recipient of the Order of Merlin.  Like you.”  She looks, for a moment, as though she’s just uncovered one of the wonders of the world.  I decide to ask her later about the ‘Lord’ thing, as I’m certain I would have remembered if anyone had told me that.  I fiercely tell myself that this is
.”  It was a nifty little spell that an Auror had taught him once, intended to immediately freeze people in their tracks.  Unlike
It was several hours later that Greg had floo called.  He looked shaken and exhausted.  “What’s going on?” Draco had demanded.
“Not quite,” Draco answered, summoning his own broom.  Before long, he’d shown Harry the basics, and Harry mounted the broom with a look of trepidation, putting paid to Draco’s long-harboured suspicion that Harry had had extensive flying lessons before that day at Hogwarts.  It took no time at all before Harry had found his latent skills, and he was already straining the safety charms of the broom when Draco told him it was time to go.
As we’ve eaten, and had tea, and I’ve dozed off a bit of a lovely food coma, Hermione cheerfully suggests that Ginny and I take a walk, and she’s doing these encouraging head bobs towards the door.  I’m pretty sure she’s thinking that some time alone will rekindle whatever spark old me and Ginny have been tending to.  I can’t very well say, “I don’t want to be alone with her because if she kisses me it’s going to be awkward,” so I agree, and before I know it, we’re walking through an orchard.  The silence stretches, long and terrible, and I finally blurt out what I’ve been wondering.  “Why are we together?”
“Anything,” Draco repeats, his voice stronger.  “It takes magic?  All of my magic?  It doesn’t matter.”
He thought that maybe he saw a hint of Harry’s expression softening, but he continued.  “I won’t make any excuses, because it doesn’t matter why I didn’t tell you the truth.  I’ve lied to you before, and I promised I wouldn’t, and I broke that promise.  But something’s been bothering me, because I also promised that you’d be safe, that I would make sure of it, and I can’t do that when we aren’t speaking.  So…” His voice cracked and he swallowed hard, and continued, “so I brought you something, to keep you safe, and maybe to keep you company, and I’m not even sure if it’s something that you still want, so you don’t have to take it.  In fact, I think maybe this was a stupid idea, and maybe I’ll be going now.  I’m sorry to have disturbed you all.”
“Draco, you didn’t confide in me then, and I understand why, even if I wish it had been different.  Will you take the advice of an old woman who has more regrets than I can count?”
“Really?”
“I guess,” he says, still a bit huffily.
“Right.” The voice is clipped, furious.  Of fucking
“Where’s Draco?”
“Let’s go,” Ron said.
Hermione laughed.  “It’s a Muggle drug.  They call it the date rape drug.  It lowers inhibitions, and makes it easy to take advantage of unsuspecting victims.  That’s why you need to keep an eye on your drink in clubs.”
She arrived mid-morning, Rose perched on her hip.  Draco kissed her cheek, which made her eyebrows shoot skyward, and then reached out for Rose.  “Hello, little one,” he said.  “You’ve grown rather a lot since I last saw you.”
“No, no,” Harry said, waving his hands a little.  “It’s Cass who will deserve your gratitude.  She’s the one who’s going through the procedure.  If the situation were in reverse, I just know that I’d be frantic, and I wanted to make sure that I got that out of the way before…”
“How much of your self-esteem was based on your relatives treatment of you?  Based on your ability to produce magic?  Based on the responsibility of being the Chosen One?”
“Let me handle that.  We’re going to release a brief statement to the press tomorrow confirming that you and your daughter are in town on personal business.  We’ll schedule a press conference for a week from then, and you and I will practice your responses in advance.  We won’t mention Draco or his family at all, but we’ll say that you intend to spend the time showing your daughter the place of your birth, and catching up with family and school friends.”
Draco blinks at him.  “What’s happening?” he asks, a little nervously.
The voice in his head condemned him.
Draco’s owl had arrived while I was out, and the note I pried from its claws was terse:
“Rain cheque?” John asked, his face showing his disappointment.
“Harry!”
“They have.  But I was under the impression that he stood trial, and was absolved of his misdeeds.  I thought that I myself testified to his actions, ones that directly impacted the outcome of the War.  Is there a case being built against him now?”
They passed a pleasant hour, working through Mr. Powers’ tentative inquiries about the nature of his daughter’s gifts, and Violet’s increasingly excited demands to show him more magic.  She reminded Harry a little of Rose, her eyes bright as she eagerly consumed information.  Mr. Powers looked at the clock, a little sadly.  “Vi,” he said, “you’ve your piano lesson in a half hour.”
Mr. Powers looked uncomfortable.  “Ah…she might.”
I feel inexplicably tired, especially for someone who’s done fuck-all but listen to a story and ponder my sexuality over scones, but it appears that attendance isn’t optional, so I obligingly follow them to the floo.
“I’ll give you a minute,” Draco said, and fled upstairs to find Ron absentmindedly shooting brightly coloured fireworks from his wand.  Harry was bouncing excitedly on his feet, arms extended towards the sparks.  As Draco and Ron looked on, he took a shaky step in the direction of Ron’s wand.  “He’s never done that before,” Draco said, a grin splitting his face.
“You’re okay,” Draco confirmed.  “You’re safe.”  Harry sighed, and fell back to sleep, seeming no worse for wear the following day, but Draco had pondered it long after returning to his bed, and sleep was slow to come.  What could such a tiny child have to be sorry for?
“Scorpius.”
Some time later, I hear a voice in my ear.  “Potter?  Why am I here?”
A tiny smile appeared on Cass’ lips.  “Uncle Professor would call you a sodding Gryffindor right now.”
“If the hat had a lick of sense, it wouldn’t sort kids at all.  It’s a stupid system, and the last thing a little kid needs is to be fed a bunch of nonsense about preordained characteristics.  Minny is sick to death of me nagging her about it,”  Harry grumbled.
“Potter,” he says.  “Harry.”
“Did you steal my sandwich three weeks ago from the breakroom?”
“Cici,” Draco said, feeling fear creep back, replacing all the relief he’d just felt.  “She will wake up eventually, right?”
He sat with his Mother until the shadows lengthened, and night fell.  Her room was quiet, only the sound of her tortured breathing and occasional moan interrupting the stillness.  He occasionally wiped her brow, murmured comforting words when her sleep seemed pained, and bided.  Waiting for a parent to die is truly a terrible thing, he reflected, when there is nothing left to fight against, when hope is lost, and all that remains is borrowed time.  Draco waited, and brooded, and in the lonely hours after midnight, he dared to think of the life that could have been his.  He had no more tears, just the bare, exhausted acceptance of his fate.  Very soon, he would be utterly alone.   Draco concentrated on being very still, his hands loosely placed on his knees, luxuriating in the pain.
He makes a strange face then, as though something has bit him, hard, but he resumes his strange, disaffected expression, and says, “Yeah.  It is.”
“And I don’t suppose you remember what I like to drink?”
“Yes, I didn’t expect to be back in town, especially with so little notice, but circumstances required it.  Do you think you could call me Harry?  I feel like we’re a bit beyond the last name stuff.”
“Especially if the Saviour takes a trip to the Ministry in the morning.”
“But that Department falls under the control of the Head Auror,” I say, secretly crowing to myself that I was right about that stupid department and stupid fucking
“Oh?”
“Nothing makes people happier than ice cream,” Rose agrees sagely.  I think she’s on to something.
He spent the rest of the day, after a shower and a calming draught, by his mother’s bedside, reading poetry aloud.  As the late summer sun sank below the horizon, flooding his Mother’s room with crimson orange light, Draco dared to speak.  He was certain his Mother couldn’t hear him; her periods of lucidity seemed to be increasingly infrequent.  In his loneliness and desperation to have someone who understood him, Draco poured out the whole story, finishing with the awful night he’d just spent with Harry.
No, he had realized.  Harry was on his own, and he’d deal with this himself.  He couldn’t imagine having Draco look at him with pity, having moved on with his own life, and still tied to Harry by the burden of a child, a child born out of wedlock, to a man that Draco hadn't cared about.  It was unimaginable that this tiny little speck of a person be anything less than treasured.  If Harry had meant nothing to Draco, he might not even want to know Harry’s child.  Or worse, with his knowledge of Pureblood customs and Wizarding laws, could he take the baby away?
“Fuck. off. Malfoy,” Ron bites out, and it feels like he’s going to rip my arm off as he’s dragging me along.
“Draco, I don’t think that’s true.  He might initially react badly, but I’m sure that he’ll come around.  Although,” she said ruefully, “maybe not until after he’s sixteen.  He was pretty angsty that year.”
It was a lot.  Group therapy, individual therapy, occupational therapy.  For the first two weeks, he’d be monitored constantly, and be allowed no visitors, no contact with anyone.  Then, he’d be assessed, and they would discuss what would happen next.  He was under involuntary admission, which meant that he couldn’t leave, even if he wanted to.  He wouldn’t be allowed to use magic at first. At least that explained the strange band he'd noticed around his ankle when showering.
“Noted,” Harry said.
“Just a little one,” I say, “but I don’t really want to take it over so much as burn it down.  I’m not fussed about what replaces it, though, so long as I don’t have to get involved.”
“Yeah, I get it.  I don’t know whether to hug you or hex you, if I’m being honest.”
“You got me a dog, Draco.  You remembered that I wanted a dog, and you went and got me a dog.”
Mrs. Powers was silent for a long moment, her eyes focused on the middle distance.  “She’s just a little girl,” she said finally.
“Why are you doing this?” He asks a bit desperately, and the pleading tone in his voice startles him.  He notices that Ron and Hermione are watching him carefully, and as Luna and Hermione conduct a conversation through exchanged glances, he knows without question that this is part of some sort of unified effort.
“Harry,” he finally meets my eyes, and his expression is unreadable.  Is he angry?  Disappointed?  I can’t place the implacable features, the hint of a sneer on his lips.
“I will speak to you later.  Now, either cease your impolite behaviour or leave this table,” Harry said, in a tone that left no question.
“Yes, our blood purity status alone must be making you twitchy.”
She feigns offence.  “
Draco stood in his closet, wearing only pants, mired in indecision.
“I’m plenty strong, emotionally,” Harry protested.  “I’m fine.”
“Huh?”
“Yes, I know you could.”
“I’m terribly sorry to have disrupted your social life,” Draco sneers.
“That’s sad.”
Faced with another example of how I’m a joyless fucking tosser, I shrug, and join Rose at the ice cream cases.  “What are you thinking?” I ask her in a low voice.
His words prompted an outburst of further sobs from Scorpius.  Alarmed, Harry dropped to his knees in front of Scorpius.  He didn’t touch, but leaned closer in order to catch his gaze.  He summoned the box of tissues, and handed a few to Scorpius, who buried his face into them and wept.  It took a few minutes for the tears to die down, during which Harry made soothing noises, but otherwise didn’t interfere.  Soon, watery grey eyes lifted to meet Harry’s.  “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
Harry’s face turned panicky at the idea that he’d be further away from the room where his daughter slept.  “No, thanks.  I think I’ll just stay here.”
“You may.”
Harry sighed.  “He didn’t really show you his best side today, Cass, but in his defence, Draco got an awful shock today, and he’s never his best when he’s blindsided.  He has every right to be angry with me.”
“No, I want to meet him.  I don’t mind if he’s confused.”
When he returned home, late that night, Harry was tired, and bit discouraged.  Ron and Hermione had come home speaking in polite, clipped tones, and when Harry caught Ron’s eye, he simply shook his head sadly.    Hurting for his friends, he lay awake long into the night, wishing he could make things better for them.
“I’m sorry, little duck.  I hope you’ll give him another chance.  What did you think of Scorpius?”
“Thank you,” she replies, just as politely.  “No longer being pregnant does a lot for one’s figure.”
Laying a ghost of a kiss on Harry’s lips, Draco extricated himself from the covers, stood in the doorway watching the only person he’d ever loved, and then, finally, stole down the stairs and out the door.
?”  I’m smiling, but he won’t look at me.  “Oh, you do.”  The way he's acting makes me realize that he expects me to feel…something.  I mentally shrug as I realize that I don’t have much of any reaction.
“No, I suppose that’s true”  It was a mistake to come home, Draco realized.  Too much time had passed, and he didn’t think that he’d be able to bridge the enormous gap that had formed.  “I am sorry, Pans.  You know I couldn’t stay”
When she returned to her seat, she took one of Harry’s hands.  “Harry, I’ll never be able to thank you for this.  I can’t begin to tell you how grateful I am.”
“Dad!  Papa!”  As Draco heard the familiar voice, he looked through the crowd, and saw two distinctive heads of hair on their way towards them.  Cass was leading, the bright blue trim on her robes setting off her complexion beautifully.  She’d grown again, Draco noticed, and her face had taken on the countenance of a woman’s.
“You’re welcome.  I’m sorry this stuff is hard for me to talk about.  Are you sleepy yet?”
“Yeah.  We both joined up after the war.  I quit when Hermione got pregnant, though.  Went to work with George.”
“Stop!” Draco’s near-hysterical with grief, and shame.  “Stop getting involved in things!  I don’t know why you keep coming here, and taunting me with your stupid invitations to coffee and your cupcakes!  I want you to go!”
“Ironic, isn’t it?” Ron mused.  “Harry can overthrow the Imperius.  He didn’t need the vaccination anyhow.”
“If I don’t, who’s going to?”
“So that’s it?  We’ll just be together from now on?”
“Yes, very.  Is this your daughter?”
, Harry,” he’d sniffed.
“No it isn’t,” Harry said.  “If I had a Mother like yours, I’d do anything in the world to protect her.”  He gave Draco a cheerful little smile, and went back to his toast, watching Draco from under his long lashes.
did?  You might wear the cloak of respectability now, but everyone who sees you sees a bloody Death Eater!  And now you’re going to just stand there and lie and cheat me?”
It was another worry, on top of his already churning thoughts.  He adored his daughter, and was incredibly proud of her, but he feared that he allowed her too much latitude, treated her too much like an adult.  It caused him to question everything about the way he’d parented her so far.  He bit his lip, and cast a glance at the doorway through which his daughter had stormed.  “Harry,” Draco said softly.  “Go ahead.  Go talk to her.”
thinking about Potter’s new romance.  The bell on the door goes, and Harry enters with all of his usual confidence, but there’s something different about his eyes.  A guarded hesitance, as though a realization is dawning slowly on him, and he doesn’t like what he’s learning.
“When we arrive, the house elves will take you directly to your quarters.  I’ll join you there, and then we can discuss final details,” Minerva reminded them.  Cass nodded, but Harry didn’t say anything.  He was watching his daughter.  They were cresting a hill, and if memory served, she would be getting her first glimpse of the Castle any moment.  When it happened, Harry was glad he’d made a point of watching for it.  Cass’ eyes widened and her mouth dropped open as she gaped at the place she’d only ever seen pictures of.
Three days go by, and I don’t hear a thing from Draco.  I’m irritated by how much it bothers me.    I tell myself that it’s nothing; Draco did say that he was going to be busy when he cancelled our plans earlier in the week.  But the lack of contact niggles at me, and when I stop by the bank on my lunch break to say hello, the Welcome Goblin tells me that he’s off.  In desperation, I finally scrawl a message on a scrap of parchment, and send it with one of the Fortesque’s delivery owls.  The lack of response sends my spirits lower.  As the week winds down, I accept that I must have read the situation wrong.  He’s not interested.
Harry sighed.  “No.  I’d left it far too long to introduce you to each other.”  Draco heard the distinctive scratching noise as a hand rubbed at stubble.  He knew that Harry was now running his hand through his hair.  “Cass deserves family, proper family, and she wanted to do this for Scorpius.  I’d never regret her doing something so unselfishly giving.”  Draco didn’t respond, busy wondering how Harry could be so unselfishly giving himself.  Draco had enough self awareness to realize that, if the situation were reversed, he wouldn't be anywhere near as generous.
“Oh, you poor dear.  I have just the thing.  Sit, sit.”  She bustles us to a nearby kitchen table, which is covered with papers, and a teapot.  We sit down, and Mrs. Fortesque brings two dishes of ice cream.  “It’s called ‘Cheerful Cherry,’” she says.  “It has a mild cheering potion in it.”
“Why do you say that?”
“You pointed out that you’d never been given physical affection as a child, and noted that Harry hadn’t either.  You mentioned that your adolescence was stilted by your inability to confront your sexual orientation.  I wonder if you worry that your attraction to Harry in his adult form will somehow create a compulsion to take advantage of him.  I wonder if your opinion that you ‘can’t be trusted’ somehow extends to your fear that if you touch him, that someone will interpret it incorrectly, or that you will truly do something reprehensible.”
“I made my father bald,” Malfoy contributed, a little smile blooming.  “He was furious.”
Ron makes a distressed noise, and I wonder if there’s going to be any way I can get him to see reason.  “Look, Ron, you love your sister and you want the best for her, yeah?” Ron grunts in the affirmative, but his face is quite red, and if I’m not mistaken, I’m still just inches away from a punching.  “Let’s just imagine for a moment that I’m right.  That Ginny and I have been going through the motions while I ignore my big gay epiphany or whatever.  Do you really want her to settle for that?  A mediocre sex life,” he makes that distressed sound again, and that’s how I learn that older brothers like to pretend their baby sisters don’t have sex, “and a relationship that’s mostly based on an eleven-year-old girl’s romantic crush?”
“No, no.  Harry, please.  I just…uh, didn’t want to presume.”
I like the way he says my name.  I flip over to all fours, and feel his hot, wet mouth kiss down my spine.  His hands cup my arse cheeks, and gently pull them apart.  His sound of delight makes me thrill inside, but it’s nothing compared to how I feel when he buries his face between my cheeks and licks me.  In my eagerness to feel more of that, my shoulders sink to the bed, and my hips instinctively rock backwards and forwards, the counterpoint of friction against the sheets and tongue on my arse makes me fear for my sanity.  When his mouth sucks at my hole, my vision goes blurry, and I think I might expire, but I manage to just groan instead, and lose myself in the sensation.  His torso suddenly is against my back, and and he kisses my neck, slides his cock between my cheeks.
“That depends,” Draco said.  “There’s a part of me that still feels a bit unsettled, I still need to resolve…”
The details were fairly spotty.  Female, seven years, Violet Powers, underage magic, transfiguration.  Multiple non-magical signatures present.  As a precaution, Harry sent a note to the Obliviation Squad, putting them on standby.  He’d talked himself out of tricky situations before, but his gut told him that he’d likely need to have a few memories wiped.  He quickly stowed his wand, notebook and Galleon, and strolled down the street.
“I don’t want you representing me.”
The snake has found a rat in a corner, and is thrilled by the impromptu snack.  As it digests, it wraps its now-lumpy body around Harry and falls asleep.
“Either way,” Hermione said with a sigh, “let’s see what happens with our eleven-year-old Harry and then we can discuss what happens next.”
“Yeah, well.  It all culminated with a giant screaming match with Kingsley in the Atrium of the Ministry.  And I threw my badge at him, and apparated out of there, which, I guess, tore down a bunch of wards and stuff.”
“So soft,” she mocked, and his his grin was genuine, if a little wobbly.
It doesn’t take long before we’re back at the Manor, and Hermione is practically vibrating with tension.  They told me about Malfoy Manor, about how Bellatrix Lestrange tortured Hermione, while Ron and I paced frantically in the dungeon.  How the brave actions of a house elf whose name I don’t even remember...Bobby?...saved us all.  This is not a comfortable place for Hermione to visit.  This is a visible symbol of what side we each fought for, the pain that we’ve all caused one another.  Knowing that there’s no way to neutralize the situation, I pick up the well-loved baby blanket that Draco has been alternately clutching and weeping into.  “Hermione, this is Scorpius’ blanket.” I thrust it into her hands, somehow knowing that the tangible evidence of the innocent whose life is at stake will stimulate her maternal instincts.  “Can we use this to trace him somehow?”
“I don’t know about that.  I think everyone made mistakes.  It was, I’m told, a difficult time for everyone.”
“But it was so long ago.  And dad said that a whole bunch of people helped to get rid of Lord Snakeface.  Why would people single him out?”
“Cass, that’s amazing. I’m so happy for you.”  He was, Draco could see.  Because he was looking for it, Draco also saw that there was just a hint of longing, but mostly, Harry was thrilled that Cass was playing, that she was having fun.  His smile was wide.
I wrinkle my nose.  “That is inconvenient.”
“Draco?”
“That’s true,” Papa said, “but he likely didn’t tell you that they weren’t kind to him.  Not at all.  They hated magic, and they hated Harry’s parents, and so that meant that they hated him too.”
“Of course, darling.  Mister Potter has been a loyal customer since he was a lad.  I’ll just take over here, then, will I?”
Turns out that this is a tiny little chapter, so I'm posting two today, that way you won't feel cheated.  Happy Sunday and thanks for reading.
“He really is old.  I don’t think that there’s a problem having him look after Harry while you’re working, but I wouldn’t trust him on his own.  He’s…a little confused, since the war,” Hermione said, trying to be diplomatic.
They made their way to the kitchen, which showed signs of the party the night before.  Orange smears coated every surface, cups and bottles were everywhere, and there was an angry looking scorch mark over the hob where someone had tried to cook something.  Harry groaned.  “Merlin, I’ll have to redecorate again.  At least it’s better than last time.”
He wishes that he had someone to talk to, someone who has more experience, who might understand how he feels.  He considers talking to Dumbledore, but immediately rejects the idea.  His feelings for Dumbledore, even years later, are too complicated for him ever to trust his once-mentor again.  Dumbledore, he realizes, despite his pretty words after Sirius disappeared through the Veil, was perfectly willing to sacrifice Harry for the greater good.  He finds himself thinking more about Tom Riddle, who’s life paralleled his own until they turned opposite ways at a crossroads.  He longs for someone who might help him sort through his complicated feelings, and then chides himself for wanting the very thing that he’d told Luna he
“Get what?”
He should.  It’s store policy, and Draco’s margins aren’t good enough to make items on spec, not yet.  “No, that’s fine.”
“My Papa helps to save the world from bad guys!”  Scorpius looked at his Father proudly, and Harry felt his heart warm in spite of himself.
“Look, I’m sorry.  I know I’m making your job harder on you.”
Harry was kneeling next to Cass’ bed, holding her hand with both of his.  His face was buried in the mattress, but as Draco approached, he heard him mumbling, “Oh thank Merlin, clever, clever girl.”
I’m grateful for the support, but there’s a part of me that secretly hopes that there’s a simple explanation for this.  That somehow, I misheard Draco.  That he didn’t actually say ‘my son,’ in that resigned, defeated voice.  I shrug.  “So should I reply to this guy?”
“Well, Kreacher is your…very special friend,” Draco said, the latter part coming out a bit lamely.  He was reasonably sure that the original three-year-old Harry had never seen a House Elf, living with Muggles, and he didn’t fancy trying to explain the complicated relationship between a family and its Elves.  “He is here to help you with anything you need, and to keep you safe.  His magic is incredibly powerful, and he’ll do all sorts of fun things with you.”
“Okay,” Harry replied.  “That’s your decision, and I can respect that.  It’s your bone marrow, and you have the right to say whether you gift it to someone else.  Do you think you could tell me why you’re making that decision?”
Another shrug.  “It’s not really where I’m going that matters, yeah?  Just…can’t be here.”
“Yes, well, Abbott’s Patronus is rather persistent.  Come along then, Potter, let’s get you home.”
“Yeah, anytime.  Thank you too, for what you said.”
“Smitten?  I was hardly smitten.  Lust-addled, more like.”
Three days later, Draco was no closer to a solution.  His Father’s contacts had indeed contacted him back, but none of them had a regular customer for love potion.  It didn’t make sense.  Draco knew that the potions community was a small one, and all of the reputable masters refused to sell any form of the substance.  He’d been so sure that Ginevra would be using one of the dodgy ones.
He looked up into Greg’s earnest, scowling face.  “I’m not sure, Greg, but I have an awful feeling that it didn’t go well.”
“Of course, but go easy.  You’re a bit of a lightweight.”
A tear stained face looked up at him.  “I’m good, Draco.”
“How is it, spending time with your Papa?”
Harry sat at his appointed spot at the table, and watched as Pansy, clad today in a sharp pinstriped jacket and skirt, strode to the podium on impossibly high heels.  “Thank you for coming,” she said crisply.  “Further to his press release of last week, Mister Potter has returned to England on personal business, and, due to the requests for interview, has kindly agreed to answer some questions today.  Before we open up the floor, however, I will warn you.  Mister Potter reserves the right to refuse any question if he deems the tone to be inflammatory or the content too personal.  You will be orderly and respectful.  I don’t have to remind you that this nation owes Mister Potter a tremendous debt, and I trust that your coverage of his responses today will reflect the generosity he shows by entrusting you with details of his personal life.”  She sent him over a toothy smile, and he knew that this was his cue.
Blaise glares at him.  “Well, if this was part of some elaborate scheme to destroy Harry’s confidence, I wish you’d let Pans and I know beforehand.  We’re actually friends with him now, and you’ve made things awfully awkward.”
“No!  No, I don’t think that you’d try to hurt me," Harry hurried to explain.  "But how long would it have lasted, Draco?  You have your parents, and you got engaged right away, and you and Astoria would have known how to raise a child in a traditional wizarding home.  How long would we have managed to share her back and forth before it just made more sense for you to take her full time?  How long before you, or your Mother, or Astoria would kindly take me aside and tell me how much better it would be for Cass not to have the confusion of two homes?  How long before the poison of being famous Harry Potter's child would have made it a burden to be associated with me?”  Harry put his head in his hands and mumbled, “I just wanted a chance to experience what a family could be like.  I know that makes me selfish.”
Draco looked at him in shock.  “Well why-”
“You never mentioned the Weasleys.  Andromeda called me a ‘dalliance’.”
Despite his better, more mature judgement, this was no exception.  Anticipation and wild, stupid hope flaring in his belly, Draco raced to the study and grabbed a parchment and quill.  He paused for a moment, considering, then his quill raced across the parchment.
“We are,” she says.  “I would have liked to have gone to Uni, but that’s impossible.  There’s too much work here, and we’d never be able to afford to pay someone a living wage.”  Her smile is a little wistful.  “Unless you know someone who will work for ice cream.”
“Draco,”  Harry’s voice caused him to still again.
“I was hoping to speak with Harry.”
“And if I refuse?”
“It’s fine,” Harry said.  “I can’t help but feel like I upset you though.”
“Oh Harry, it didn’t occur to you to be a bit subtle?”  Draco turned to look at him.
It seems a strange question.  “No?  I don’t think so.  Isn’t it too soon?”
So...that's it for this one.  I want to thank everyone who kudo'ed and commented.  Your feedback is such a tremendous gift that truly, truly brings me incredible joy.  I especially want to thank those who commented on my interpretation of Draco's life with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  It's always a big risk to write about something so personal when you don't have the lived experience, and I couldn't be more grateful to those who helped.
“Fine.  A bit groggy.  Headache?”
“So someone cornered me in an old warehouse, while smuggling potions, and used benign, healing magic, to lock my memories away?”
Narcissa, it turned out, was not alone in the gardens.  Draco went over to his father and kissed both of his cheeks.  “Hello, Father.”
“It always did, I’m only allowing myself to admit it now.
“But at least I know.”
“Yeah, a bit.  It will be okay.”
“Oh,” I say.  “Alright then.  I’m going to go back inside.”
“I suppose that would draw some attention,” Draco admitted.  “Well, call Granger.  Surely she can take him.”
I move a little closer, and the most delicious whimper escapes Draco’s slightly parted lips.  His eyes are wide, and riveted on mine.  “May I?” I repeat, and he nods slightly.  I start gently, just the slightest press of lips, my hand working its way into his hair.  His eyes fall closed, and I trace the seam of his mouth with my tongue.  As it opens for me, and I press my tongue inside, his arms wrap around my waist, pulling us closer.  He tastes delicious, and the friction of our tongues against one another is intoxicating.  I don’t notice time passing, but as his hands slip down to my arse, and he pulls us closer, I feel his cock, hard against mine.  Lust practically consumes me, but I don’t want to fuck him in a public park.  Not the first time, anyway.  Reluctantly, I pull away.
“Please, oh Merlin, please, I think I’ll die if you don’t,” Harry whimpered.  Draco wasted no time getting his mouth onto Harry’s cock, and when he licked the precome that was already dripping from Harry’s slit, Draco himself nearly came.
“Harry’s a Wandmaker, did you not know?”
“Indeed.”  I quirk my lips at him again, and say, “In order to be absolutely certain I understand, let me restate what I understand.”  He nods.  “It would seem that we’re at a bit of an impasse.  If I wish to pursue the opportunity of Head Auror, I’ll need to be especially careful about who I consort with.  Namely, being seen in the company of Draco Malfoy would make me ineligible for consideration.  Have I gotten that correct?”
“Absolutely.  They control the pain medication, they can bring the best snacks, and if they hate you, they have a number of ways to make things difficult.  Like adhering to visiting hours, for example.”
“But…” Malcolm’s chin wobbled a little.  “What if I’m not here when my Mum gets back?”
He digs around in the fridge for a while, and comes out of the kitchen with two bottles held triumphantly aloft. As he passes me one, and flops onto the couch beside me, he says, “You look like you’ve had a bad day.”
“Didn’t you?  Do you really think that this is prioritizing your own mental health?”
“That was calm?  He cried!  He cried the whole time.”
“Potter,” Pansy paused, looked at him closely.  “Did you love him?  I assumed it was some kind of one night stand, but it wasn’t, was it?”
“Thanks.  I suppose a lawyer will help when Draco sues me for custody as well.  They can help me try to get visitation.”
“There was a bit of damage to the building,” Harry said, exchanging a glance with Draco that suggested that ‘a bit’ meant ‘quite a lot, really’.  “I’m sure that the response team has fixed that all up now.  The more important part is that Scorpius’ magic responded so violently that he is now suffering from magical exhaustion, and that, because of some flying glass, he was injured.  It’s not Scorpius’ fault, and fortunately, he’ll easily get better soon, but it’s a little dangerous that his magic is so…spirited.”
I'm an idiot and forgot that yesterday was Monday.  Apologies, here's the chapter!
“Really?” Her head cocked, she reminds me of a little, curious bird.  “You’ve always had good judgement.”
When I awaken the next morning, I’m immediately filled with a sense of foreboding, which is troubling.  I stretch in the bed, which is much more comfortable than the one at Ron and Hermione’s, and roll over, only to see a pair of beady eyes, enfolded in a ridiculous collection of wrinkly skin.  It’s like the folds of skin have folds of skin.  The…whatever it is…has gigantic ears that make it look like a greyish bat.  It’s different from the Goblins at the bank, but absolutely not human.  And it’s watching me intently.  I am frozen, unable to decide whether moving will make it attack me.
“Sometimes, people are too shy to speak up when they feel uncomfortable.  They don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings, or they’re frightened of making someone mad at them.   That’s rubbish!  There is one thing in this world that belongs to you and you alone, and that yourself.  You are in charge of your body and your mind.  You get to say whether someone touches you are not.  If someone else gets offended, that’s their problem, not yours.  I always want you to remember that.  And if someone is telling you any differently, then you go and tell someone you trust.  Okay?”
It’s a mess, really, hot, and wet, I’m covering him with my saliva, my hand instinctively surrounding the lower part of his cock, because I can’t seem to take the whole length of him without gagging.  I need to work on my technique.  I bob my head experimentally, and when I taste his precome on my tongue, I can’t help but groan.  This prompts one in return from him, and so I deduce that I’m doing something right.  I need his mouth again.  I come up on my knees, kiss him filthily, our tongues plunging into each others’ mouths.
“Ugh, Malfoy, can’t you possibly avoid being a prick for even just a minute?  And you,” Weasley rounded on the baby, “why do you
?  Draco, how?  He’s so little.  This doesn’t make any sense.”
“Ah, fair point.  Uncle Professor would be so disappointed to miss the gossip.”
A few minutes later, I’m back on Diagon, wandering around aimlessly.  Only…none of the shops peak my interest.  I have a broomstick that I’m afraid to use, and I don’t think I need a cauldron, since Hermione just laughed when I asked for a potions textbook.  I wander the aisles of the magical menagerie, but I can barely take care of myself, let alone a pet, and so, with no other destination standing out, I’m back in the lineup at Fortesque’s.
“I’m going to learn every single one of your ticklish spots, you know.”
“Finally, I got enough courage to go inside, and that was the day that I apologized to you for all of the animosity during school.  I didn’t want to die with that still on my conscience.  It was one of the only things I could do anything about.  Most of the people I wronged during the War are too...dead to apologize to.  I bought the poison that day, came home fully intending to use it.
“I’m free.  And yeah, I’d like to,” Harry said.  His face had flushed further, and Draco was so charmed by the sight that he stumbled a little as they headed to the floo.
“In the nursery.  Do you have a baby somewhere Draco?  I didn’t expect to see a full nursery in your posh flat.”
The house elf came into the room, a box in her hands.  “Master Draco, an owl has just been delivering this.”
The visit passed uneventfully, and Harry and Draco left.  Draco had agreed to take his Mother to a restaurant she thought looked charming that evening, and he and Harry agreed to meet later that evening.  “I’ll come to you at bedtime,” Draco promised, with a lingering kiss that promised more.  He apparated home, and prepared for dinner. He was nearly finished getting ready when a tapping at his window revealed an unfamiliar owl.  Opening the window to allow the owl in, Draco cast a few revealing spells to ensure that the owl wasn’t carrying any hexes or Dark Spells.  Although the wards at Malfoy manor were secure, Draco had learned the hard way to be suspicious of unfamiliar owls.  The scan revealed nothing, and Draco untied the letter from the owl’s outstretched leg.  It stood watching him solemnly, and Draco assumed that it was waiting for a reply.  He unfolded the letter and read:
He cuts me off, “I don’t have any right to ask for this, especially after I pushed you away, but, would you sleep in my room with me tonight?  I really don’t want to be alone.”
He frowns.  “That’s not ideal.”
Draco rushed in, and barely looked at Harry or John as he hastened to Scorpius’ side.  He was wearing a three-piece suit today, a crisp grey one that looked incredibly distinguished.  His hair was disheveled, though, as though he’d been running his hands through it.  The incongruity was appealing.
“True Black Heir?” I ask.
“Enough!”  Cass didn’t mean to shout, but she was frightened, and upset, and she wasn’t used to people who didn’t
“Draco!”  Hermione’s voice was distinctive, loud above the noise that filled the platform.  “Harry!”
“Yeah, but I’m the twat who holds the power, Potter.  Don’t make me dole out another lesson.”
She had, Draco realized, reached the inevitable part of a child’s life where they realized that their parents were human, fallible.  Harry had struggled under the burden of hero worship his whole life, but Draco suspected that nothing stung as much as failing to meet the expectations of the person he loved the most.  Harry never saw himself as a hero, but still struggled to live up to what he viewed as his responsibility.  Admitting to himself that it wasn’t possible to succeed had taken its toll.
Papa shushed her, and stroked her hair.  “Even if what, dear one?”
the way you used to.”
“That’s the problem.  Before you lost your memories, you didn’t want anything to do with me.  You were, ostensibly, straight, and with Ginevra Weasley, and would have likely hexed me if I even tried to talk to you.”
“Yeah?  Why do you keep doing the same stupid thing, then?”
“Um, alright, if you’re sure.”
Draco shrugs.  “Perhaps not.  Doesn’t matter.”
“Me too,” Draco said.  “I’m glad you’re safe too.”  Harry gave him a long look at that.
Cass nodded.  “Ravenclaw,” she said solemnly.
“Sure,” Harry said, feeling a bit awkward.  John was nice, really nice, but Harry just couldn’t muster up the interest.  John made his leave, with an invitation for Malfoy to contact him if Scorpius’ condition changed.
After Ron left, Draco sent a few messages with his owl to some of his father’s dodgy potions contacts.  He’d never really worked with them, wanting to keep his fledgling reputation clean, but, ironically, the Malfoy name still held some sway in certain circles.  He heard the knock of an owl at the window that evening, and expected it to be a response from one of them, but was surprised when it was the tiny, hyperactive owl again.
“Thanks, Draco.” His smile blooms across his face.  “And maybe I could take you for some lunch?  To say thanks?”
For a moment, they stood there, each examining the other.  Harry sighed softly in Draco’s arms and nestled closer.  Narcissa seemed to see something in Draco’s expression, and she stood.  “I’m sorry,” she said again.  “I’ll go.  Please forgive me.”  As she walked towards the floo, her always-elegant posture seemed to droop.
Later that night, when the kids were sleeping, Harry was surprised to hear a knock at his door.  He opened it to find a surprisingly ill-at-ease Draco, holding a bottle of fire whiskey.  “It’s been a hell of a couple of days,” he said. “I thought you might like a drink.”
Ron looked delightedly back.  “Fuck me,” he breathed, “I never thought I’d see Harry’s first steps.  Well done, mate!”
Kreacher manages to greet her politely enough, but he casts a filthy look behind her back, and I vow to ask him for the story of why he hates her later.  It only takes a little bit of begging for him to produce a cup of tea for Hermione.  She protests that she can make it herself, but I cut her off, and say, “Kreacher likes making tea.  And he’s better at it than anyone else I know.”  He beams at me, and Hermione huffs.
“I’m compatible with Scorpius,” Cass said firmly.
They continue chatting while I make my tea, but I suspect that there’s been a subject change since I arrived, as I doubt Luna’s new printing press made Draco so emotional.  “I think I’ll go see whether Scorpius is dressed,” Draco says, and gives Luna a short bow before leaving the room.
“We could leave,” Harry offers, and Ron looks briefly hopeful.  Hermione just sighs and digs another pair of heels out of the cupboard.
“He rejected you.”
at my job.
“What if you regret this?” Harry asks, his voice small.   “What if you resent me for robbing you of your family?”
“You’re going to do brilliantly, Harry. Go, enjoy your baby, and I’ll come over and knit booties before the birth.”
“Nope, just a pissed off wife,” Harry says to the snake, then, switching to English, says, “Guys, it’s fine.  I know that you guys have to go, and believe me, there’s nowhere I’d rather be than here with Rosie.”
“I dunno, mate,” Ron says.  “I think you thought it was your duty.”
She laughs.  “As long as you aren’t one today, it doesn’t matter.”  Her face softens.  “And for what it’s worth, I don’t think you’re an arsehole.  In this job, I see a lot of people, and I’ve gotten really good at reading them.  You’ve always struck me as the sort of person who doesn’t want to be noticed, and when you’re the centre of attention, it’s uncomfortable for you.  Maybe you’re the sort of person who feels like he doesn’t deserve nice things.”  She shrugs.  “But what do I know, eh?  Maybe you’re just a prat.”
“No,” he says.  “You aren’t.”
A roar of approval rang through the kitchen as Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Ginny Weasley entered.  They were blocking the exit, Draco realized.  He was trapped in the kitchen with two-thirds of the Golden Trio, and their little sister.  Draco sunk further into the corner, hoping that he would evade notice.  The three new arrivals were hugged and presented with cups of the orange disaster.  Then, Weasley’s eyes made their way into the corner and narrowed.
They climbed two flights of stairs, where, sure enough, a nursery had appeared next to Draco’s bedroom.  It was beautiful, with walls painted a soft blue, and a mural of an enormous Quidditch pitch, complete with bludgers and a quaffle, and a tiny snitch that danced into the corner.  The oak crib looked antique, and Draco was rather sure that Kreacher had liberated it from the Black house’s attic.  Inside the crib, wrapped in a fluffy blue blanket, Harry lay, sleeping soundly.  His hair was a riot of curls, and his arms were splayed above his head, tiny fists clenched.  His lips were slack and his long eyelashes fanned his cheeks.  Despite himself, Draco’s heart clenched a little.  “He looks so innocent,” Draco whispered.
“I’m not really hungry,” Scorpius said doubtfully.
“Do you like it?”
Draco’s eyes widened.  “No!” Hermione rushed to continue.  “No, nothing like what you’re thinking.  The opposite, in fact.  We had a lot of time to talk, and one night Harry confessed to me that had some questions about his sexual inclinations.”
By the time the waiter leaves us alone with the wine menu, I’m blushing.  Having managed to keep Draco guessing so far, I’m not off to a terrific start tonight.   I regard him from across the table.  His robes are more formal than the ones he wore at the bank, and the ice blue colouring flatters him, which, obviously, he’s well aware of.  His skin is as pale as cream, and the smug set of his lips distracts me for a moment, until I finally pull myself together and say, “Thanks, Draco, for making the reservation, and for meeting me.”
Harry had been lacing up the offending trainers, working hard to keep angry tears from springing to his eyes when Draco had been suddenly standing next to him.  “Harry,” he’d said.  “Don’t.  Don’t go.  I’m…I didn’t mean to imply-”
I’m unaccountably embarrassed.  This little fellow seems delighted, in his way, to see me, and I don’t know how he’ll take the fact that I don’t remember him.  “Kreacher, that’s your name?” I ask.
Harry laughed.  “Yeah, just a bit.  Anyways, there was a big fallout.  The Prophet was speculating that I was going to be the next Voldemort, and the DMLE were going to arrest me, at one point.  And then my personal life fell apart a bit, and I kind of had a breakdown, I guess.”
“You were,” Harry replied, and Draco could hear the smile in his voice.
“Draco,” he says evenly.  “I think you have somewhere you’re meant to be.”
Hermione moved things along.  “I must confess that I’ve never met anyone with Scorpius’ condition before.  Is it quite rare?”
“You were thinking too loud,” she replied.
The article’s full of speculative bullshit.  I’m relieved to know that Ginny refused to comment, and Hannah barred the reporter, Skeeter, from the Leaky, but despite anything other than a blurry picture, Skeeter manages to discuss, for several paragraphs, my sexuality, how susceptible I am to becoming a Dark Lord, and what my current mental state is.
Once I’m tucked into a sizeable bed in a suite, Draco sits beside me to take my hand.  “Ready?”
the time to daydream what a Lord can do.  “Now, Unspeakable.  Do you accept the challenge, or will you cease your research and leave the Department of Mysteries?”
“Kreacher!” Harry barked.  “We talked about this!”
There had been another, less confusing but equally tragic moment on the first night, when Harry had awoken screaming again.  Draco had torn into the room, heart pounding.  Harry wasn’t properly awake, but was sobbing, “Sorry, sorry,”  Draco sat on the edge of the bed, uncertain whether to wake the child or not, but, after arguing with his unresponsive arm for a few minutes, had managed to awkwardly rub Harry’s back.  Harry had stilled for a moment, gone silent, and blinked sleepy eyes up at Draco.
advocate.  I’m here to make sure that he’s being supported, and loved, just like I do with every other child I work with.  If he’s being treated appropriately, you have nothing to worry about.”
“Well, it’s good that you don’t even have to try to hurt me anymore.  Less taxing for you, I’m sure.”  Draco had never heard Harry’s voice sound so cold.
The little boy turned over, and Harry conjured a ball of light in his palm, nudging it a little until it hovered over them and bathed them in a warm glow.  Malcolm’s eyes widened at this.  Harry smiled.  “Neat, isn’t it?  Do you remember what I said I was called?”  Malcolm nodded.  “Good.  So I’m Harry, and you’re Malcolm, and I bet it’s been sort of an awful day, hasn’t it?”  Another nod.  Harry moved his hand nearer to Malcolm.  “The first thing that I need to tell you is that you’re absolutely, perfectly safe.  I am going to make sure that you stay that way, and that’s a promise.  Nobody’s going to hurt you anymore, Malcolm.”
Lara seemed to have backed off somewhat on criticizing Draco’s plan to keep Harry until he was big again.  “I wonder if you’ve thought any of what I said to you the last time we met.”
“No,” he wailed.  “I can’t.  But I know I have to.”
“Well, I’ll let you know if I ever decide to go slumming it, Potter.”  Draco tries to inject the same cutting disdain that he once wielded so successfully, but he’s out of practice, and so it just sounds like a challenge.
This prompted another one of those brilliant smiles of Harry’s, and he said, “Good.  We’ll take it slow, figure things out together.”
“I’m not sure.  They may not want to see me.”
“He might have wanted me.”
Draco cast a quick Tempus, and said, “It looks like it’s time.  Cass, you ready?”  She had her Mind Healer appointment.
“Yeah.  I think I might have been…or still am, I don’t know how it works…a bit fucked up.”
“I don’t think you’re thick, Harry, honestly.  I just…You just see the good in people, and I don’t want you to be hurt.”
“Bad news, Harry?”  Luna has a nice voice.  It’s restful, and unobtrusive.
“Can we go to Ollivander’s?”
“So, we stay here until your season is over, and spend off-season in England.”
“Merlin,” Harry gasped into his mouth, and before Draco knew what was happening, Harry’s hand was on his cock, and the pressure there, along with his tongue in Draco’s mouth made Draco whimper.
He laughs.  “Perhaps.  Tonks helped.  A metamorphmagus has no true form, did you know?  Because they can change their appearance at will, even in utero, they’re rather like a boggart.  It’s impossible to identify their original form.”
“It would be a shame for all of the hard work since the war ended, if someone let their old grudges and suspicions create problems for a family.”
“It was Amy,” Violet said.  She threw a filthy look at her mother.  “I
“During our sixth year at Hogwarts,” Draco says finally, “I, as you have heard, was set an impossible task.  The stress was unbearable, and the consequences of my failure was on my mind constantly.  I began to dissemble, and if it wasn’t for Severus, reminding of my training, I…well, who knows what would have happened?  At any rate, Severus did remind me, and I made use of my occlumency shields, to protect me from the worst of my emotional turmoil.  At first, I only occluded when necessary…in classes or during meals, times when I would be watched.  By the time the year began to wane, I was occluding constantly, which is dangerous.”
“It’s Scorpius.  They’ve taken Draco’s son, Potter, and I need you to get him back.”
Oh.  Alright, I could see myself doing that.  I'm relieved that I'm not taking a bribe or anything, but this is morally, a bit grey.
Draco wraps his arms around me.  “I’m sorry.”
“Then order quick, before she notices.”
“Alright, lad, but on one condition,” Mister Fortesque says.  “You’ll call us Florean and Ellen, yes?”
Draco was coaxing Scorpius to eat just one more bite when he heard the floo, followed by Cass’ excited voice say, “Maybe we can go and see the Weasley shop?”
“What the fuck is Malfoy doing here?” he demanded.
“Well, if we aren’t waiting for any additional family members, perhaps I will wake Scorpius now?” John asked.  Draco nodded, and John cast the spell.
“What?  Blaise didn’t put me up to anything.  He told me you were leaving, but-”
“That’s a very good question, and that’s why this is a tricky bit of medicine, Scorp.  The best kind of donor is usually a brother or a sister, but because you’re an only child, that makes our search a bit harder.”  Cici looked to Draco and Astoria.  “You know that a non-sibling donor reduces our success rate by a large margin.  For right now, we will begin to use hematopoietic growth factors, which we’ve been seeing some good results from.  And, the research being done on gene therapy is very promising, but the science is slower than I’d like.”
“I just need you to trust me.  Please.  Just let it go.  You don’t owe them any favours.”
“You did,” he confirms, and Grace affects a pout.
“Thank you,” Harry’s voice broke the silence.  “For saving me, I mean.”
“Fine.  Lemme try now.”
Draco did so.  It was at a party at Luna and Neville Longbottom’s house.  Draco and Luna had grown close after the war, when Draco had sent her a letter of apology for her imprisonment in their Dungeons.  It was her birthday, and despite his misgivings, Draco had agreed to stop by.  The moment he’d stepped through the floo, Draco had been hit by a wall of laughter, conversation, music.  It was jarring, and, as he spelled the soot from his robes, he took a few deep breaths to get his bearings.  It was then that he’d seen Potter, standing in the spacious kitchen, his eyes bright, laughing with Neville.  For a moment, Potter looked so young, and he was completely free of the normal tension he seemed to carry with him.  In all their years at Hogwarts, Harry had seemed like a coiled spring, wary and looking for danger around every corner.  Somehow, that defensive posture had fallen away, and Draco wondered for a moment what Potter would have been like, free of all of the expectations of being the Boy who Lived.
“He’s a superhero,” Scorpius said solemnly, and Draco exchanged an embarrassed look with Harry, who grinned.
Draco free them both quickly, but it took ten more agonizing minutes before Hermione regained consciousness.  Ron had raced through the house the moment he’d been set free, and Draco could hear his shout of relief when he found Rose, completely unharmed, in her crib.
, but tomorrow, yeah?  Let’s just go home and get some sleep.”
“Yes fine, we’ll eat their food.  Then what?”
“But, Harry!”
“This was amazing, Harry.  Thank you for letting me share her birthday.”
“Those jeans had half the store drooling after you.  Women and men.”
“No, nothing.  I got worried enough to search his flat the last time he was away on a mission, and there was absolutely nothing.  It’s the strangest thing, Malfoy.  When he came back, he was different, back to his old self, but he came for dinner at Mum and Dad’s that night, and somehow, by the next day, he was all confused again.”
“Okay, well, I’ll need you to bring him back later, so I can get samples.”
“Okay, fine, so Draco married Astoria.”
“You don’t live here?”  Cass seemed surprised.
“You don’t!  You never talk about him, and there’s something going on, and you won’t tell me.  You don’t even care that I’m worried and lonely!”
A week later, Draco enters the Leaky Cauldron, where a sizeable crowd has assembled to celebrate Ron’s birthday.  He’s gratified by the shout of welcome from the large corner table, and Hannah waves from behind the bar, sending a large Gin and Soda floating his way.  He sinks down next to Blaise, exchanging a grin with Ginny.  Harry arrives several minutes later, not that Draco’s been watching for him.  He flops down next to Ron, and Draco watches  Hermione lean over Ron until she can reach his cheek.  She kisses him, and whispers something that makes Harry blush.
“That’s why we should.”
“I miss you too.”  I don’t, not really, but there’s some reason why old me loved her like a sister, and my instincts tell me it’s worthwhile to find out.  She has very kind eyes, after all.  Besides, I do like Ron, and I won’t see him much if I’m fighting with his wife.  “But Hermione, I don’t want us to make up and find ourselves in the same situation in a week.  I appreciate your advice, but I do want to make my own decisions.”
“Harry!  You shagged Draco Malfoy?”
1 Week
Still, he was acutely aware that time was running out.  Draco feared what would happen when Cass’ birthday was over.  He knew that Harry had an entire life in Canada, but he wanted them to stay.  Draco had passed up on the chance ten years ago, but he was becoming despondent at the idea that he'd miss this chance.  If Harry went home now, Draco was pretty sure that he'd be allowed to maintain ties with his daughter, but it wasn't enough.  He needed Harry to stay, to give them a second chance.  He just didn’t know how to ask.
Harry was tired, and a bit off centre from his earlier fight with Hermione.  He didn’t fancy trying to convince this man to let him in.  He cast a mild confundus charm, and, a little dazedly, the man stepped back.  A woman came out of the kitchen at speed.  “Who is this?”
“And you’re going to be here with me?  Just you and me?”  Harry looked awestruck, and Draco smiled.  Sometimes, when he was Harry’s age, he looked at his parents with exactly the same sense of wonder.  As though they were the beginning and ending of it all, and Draco was the luckiest person alive to be theirs.
He leaned closer, and Harry froze.  Before Harry knew what was happening, Draco’s hand gently caressed the back of his neck, and drew him in closer.  When his lips covered Harry’s, Harry was surprised to hear a little whimper, and was even more surprised when he realized it had come from him.  Draco was still a magnificent kisser.  His lips against Harry’s were soft and firm, and he drew Harry’s lower lip between them and sucked, enough to draw Harry’s breath in a gasp.  Draco’s tongue crept inside Harry’s mouth, and he tasted of fire whiskey and it was lovely, and so familiar, and for a moment, Harry felt like he’d come home.
“Malfoy,” he growled, sitting up and reaching for his wand.  Draco’s heart sank.  Harry blinked a few times, and then said, “Draco?”  He seemed to be struggling to reconcile the Malfoy he knew when he was eleven with the Draco he’d spent the previous days with.
“It’s not!  I just don’t want to have to come in and pick up the pieces when you get screwed over by Draco bloody Malfoy!”
Harry smiled.  “Yes, I am.  Are you Scorpius Malfoy?”
He flushes, and looks away.  “No,” he admits miserably.  “The Goblins made it clear that if I wanted to keep my job, I’d need to avoid association with anyone inappropriate.”
Draco’s forehead wrinkled.  “But you wanted to punish me.”
“You’re a fool,” Wendell remarks.  “Do you really think that this isn’t sanctioned by the Wizengamot?  By the Minister?  I’m simply taking care of a lingering problem that the Ministry doesn’t want to face.”
“Oh yeah?  Um…me too.  I imagine you’re too busy to leave work, but if you ever want me to bring you in lunch or anything,” he says, his voice trailing off.
“And you’re disgusting, Granger.  You’re quick to assume the moral high ground, as though you know best, about house elves, and your precious Order of the Phoenix, and yet you stop short of doing anything that will have a lasting impact.  Your hands are too clean to sully with doing the hard work to ensure that we stay safe.
“What was easy?” Hermione asks.
“No.  No, he’s not.”
“I taped it to my kitchen cupboard door, and spent hours wondering what it meant,” Draco admitted, and Harry laughed again.
“It could be worse?”  It wasn't comforting that it sounded like a question.
As Draco massaged the potions onto his Mother’s temple, he heaved a sigh.  It was a thoughtful gesture, so like Harry.  Narcissa sighed, and Draco thought that the tight lines around her eyes eased some.  Granger really was a clever witch.
He stifles a sigh, and raises his eyes from the piece he’s working on.  “Potter.”
“Nervous,” Cass said.  “He might not want me.”
“Really, Luna?”
“Alright.”
Draco had a bad night.  The stress of the next day’s potion administration kept him from falling asleep, and each of his intrusive thoughts fed upon the previous one.  Draco was left shuddering from visions of terrible things happening to Harry at his hand.  Lara had been right, he realized.  He was in no shape to be taking care of Harry.  He’d been so foolish to lie to Harry about their relationship, and when Harry remembered, he’d be
“Well, if you don’t want me to find some reason to slap a probationary order on Malfoy, you’d better call off your dog.”
“Yes, I can understand that,” Harry soothed.  “Would it be possible for me to speak to her?  Maybe while Violet is at her lesson?  Sometimes it’s easier to get things out into the open without little ears listening in.”
“Well, not at first.  At first, it was the strangest feeling.  Like the wand knew me.  Like it was an old friend, saying hello.  Then I nearly knocked your house down, and I got scared.”
“May I see if I can restate your thought process?  I’d like to validate that I understand you.”
“I’ve made my decision.”
Cici entered the room, followed by a severe looking Healer wearing the purple robes of the paediatric wing.  “Good morning, Malfoys and Potters!” Cici cried.  “Today’s the big day.  I’d like you to meet Healer Mancini, who will be leading the procedure.  All ready, Scorpius?”
, he told himself.
So they do.
“Fuck, Harry, I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to,” Draco says, his voice dripping with agony.
be so right.  But you and I both deserve better.  I think you know that as much as I do.”
“You fought with Granger about me?”
Draco froze.  “What do you mean?”
“Can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs?”  Her voice drips with scorn.
Harry reaches out a hesitant hand, and gently strokes the side of Draco’s face.  “Goodbye, Draco.”  He spins on his heel, and he’s gone.
“Like what?” Draco’s voice is quiet.
She chuckles.  “You’re a sap, Potter.”  I shrug.  “I assume you’re here to meet Kingsley?”
“But why?  You live a quiet life, right?  You do your curse breaking, and you raise your son?”
“Interesting delivery method.”
“Yeah.  I should have warned you that you’re constantly getting papped, but I sort of thought that you’d stay out of trouble.”
“You’re kidding.  That’s huge.”
“Nothing matters, or everything matters, or, as I came to realize, our choices and actions in the moment matter most of all.”  He smiles, and rests a hand on my head.  “Your past is a gift, Harry, but it shouldn’t overshadow the present, and it shouldn’t fully define the future.”
“It’s embarrassing.”
After that, everything was simple, if not easy.  He sat through the reading of the will.  Unsurprisingly, he was wealthy.  He asked the lawyer to put the Manor up for sale.  He packed some photographs, arranged to have some artifacts stored in the vaults at Gringotts, and took a final walk through the manor.  The elves wailed when he tried to free them, so he sent them to Pansy.  Let her figure out what to do with them.  Granger could find them somewhere; Draco knew she had a thing about elves back at Hogwarts.
Harry sat very still, and was silent for so long that Pansy thought he wasn’t going to answer.  Finally, his voice so quiet that Pansy had to lean closer, he said, “Pansy, he was The One.”
He leans to hug Harry, who stiffens.  “Don’t,” Harry says.  His voice is strangled.  Looking devastated, Draco nods, turns on his heel, apparates away.
“Draco.”  Draco nodded encouragingly.  He wasn’t completely heartless, and this was clearly killing Harry.  It was then that Draco realized that this wasn’t some sort of last-ditch reconciliation.  His heart sank and sound roared in his ears.  If it wouldn’t have made him look like an utter fool, he would have fallen to the floor with his hands over his head, but, he owed it to Harry to at least hear him say the words.
At 5:55 am, exactly, Draco’s wand buzzed.  He silenced it, and lay, perfectly still, waiting the requisite one minute before he was allowed to get up.  Counting the sixty seconds off in his head, he heard Lara’s voice there too, gentle and encouraging, “And, Draco, I’m curious about what would happen if you
should know, damnit.  Especially since they apparently died trying to protect me.  If nothing else, they look happy.  The woman has a sparkle in her eyes that suggests that there’s more to her than her wholesome good looks suggest.  The man appears to be a cocky shit, but there’s a warmth in his smile that makes me wish to know him.  I leaf through the pages.  There’s a ripped photo of a baby that must be me, followed by the legs of a man, as I ride a broomstick through the frame.  There’s another picture of the hot godfather again, surrounded by a bunch of other people.  I pick my parents out, but can’t place anyone else.
“Draco, I’m going to come,” Harry gasped.  Draco hummed appreciatively, and with a cry, Harry unloaded his seed into Draco’s mouth.  Draco swallowed, and swallowed, and gave one last gentle lick to the head of Harry’s cock before pulling off.
“Master Harry, please can I be returning to Grimmauld Place to dust the treasures?”
“It’s the least I could do, Harry.”
“Thanks, mate.  Now, what about you?”
“And what of Mister Potter’s rights?”
“Maybe sometimes I wear them just to look nice.  I wish I could try them on.”
“Yeah,” Harry said finally, “but I reckon it’s easier to know it all at now.  I hate not knowing stuff.”
“Well, my favourite subjects are math and science.  Muggle subjects.  Would he be able to teach me those?”
“Yes, I gathered that,” I say.
“Kreacher,” Harry replied evenly.  “What’s up?”
Harry expression grew sheepish.  “I…er, didn’t really have time.  She was a bit early, and my mediwitch had to floo in from Scotland.  By the time I realized that I was in labour, and Poppy arrived, there wasn’t time to put me out. She just cast a pain blocker spell.”  Catching the look on Cici’s face, he blushed.  “It was fine.”
“Well, yeah.”
She storms from the store, muttering under her breath about speaking to the Prophet.  Potter immediately turns to Draco.  “Draco,” he says, his voice gentle.  “Are you alright?”
There’d been a tiny hiccup when on the first night, after spelling a set of pyjamas onto the boy, a miscommunication had occurred.  Draco had said that it was time for bed, and then a few minutes of incredible confusion occurred, when Harry seemed determined to sleep in a closet, and Draco had been equally convinced that his bed was a better spot.  Harry had ultimately been persuaded, and, as Draco pulled the duvet up over his shoulders, Harry had patted the covers in wonder.  “For Harry?  Harry bed?”
I remember a red-haired little girl who blushed and ran out of the room every time I spoke to her, and how my love for her as an adult felt alarmingly similar to what I felt for Ron and Hermione, and I remember Uncle Vernon’s harsh criticism of ‘poofs’, and sleepless nights wondering how I could be part of a family that wasn’t mine to claim.
“Of course I have.  Lots of times.  I had some theories about being the Master of Death, so I measure him every year or so.  It’s so painfully obvious, I can’t imagine why I didn’t think of it sooner.”
It was just past six am when Draco, Astoria and Scorpius arrived at St. Mungo’s.  The Welcome witch directed them to the fifth floor, where a mediwitch was waiting for them. The paediatric unit was bright and cheerful, and had animated murals of a woodland scene.  Fairies flitted from shrub to tree branch, and rabbits hopped across the forest floor.  Scorpius was quickly shown to a room, where Cass and Harry were waiting.
“I don’t really know yet.  That’s what I’m here to help sort out.”
“But he’s the one who made all the mistakes.  Why would you care so much about him?”
“Well, no,” Harry allowed.  He thought for a moment, examining his hands.  “I have magical friends,” he said suddenly.
I groan again, and allow myself one small moment with my eyes closed, the bridge of my nose pinched between thumb and forefingers, and deep, annoyed breaths whooshing in and out of my lungs.  Temper tantrum abated, I open my eyes and look at Ron.  “I don’t get it.”
“You have no right!” Harry shouted, and then, realizing that the kids might be home, carefully lowered his voice.  “No right, Hermione, to assume things, and draw your own conclusions.  You have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Harry rolled his eyes, his face clearly showing distress.  He bit his lip, and Draco wondered what he wasn’t saying.  He looked beautiful, despite his discomfort.  He was looking down at Hank, and his long lashes fanned across his cheekbones.  His skin had regained a lot of their normal colouration, and, for the first time since Draco had known him, he wasn’t skinny.  The treatment had been good for him, so far, and Draco wanted, so desperately, for him to be well.
Ron smiled at the structure fondly.  “Yeah, well, Charlie and Bill helped Fred and George quite a bit, and Dad helped with the magic.”  Again, Draco wondered what it would have been like to grow up here, surrounded by others, amidst noise and chaos, and people who hugged, and yelled and laughed, and teased, and just…loved you.
Draco was nervous, but also secretly delighted that Harry wanted to acknowledge their relationship.  Besides, if Andromeda loved Harry, she was obviously nice, right?  Draco didn’t really know anything about babies, but he would learn, for Harry.  A tiny bubble of excitement formed in Draco’s chest.
“I’m sure it’s taken some time for business to pick back up, since the Alley has reopened, but I have every faith in your continued success.  I’d like to invest in your company.”
Draco was in the dining room, trying to persuade Scorpius to eat.  “Harry,” he said, his eyes warming, and a little smile crossing his lips.  “You look like you’re on a mission.”
“Is that so?” Hermione said, and Harry could hear the frustration in her voice.  This was something she’d been carefully not saying for a while.  “I have no idea?  Honestly, Harry, anyone who’s got a set of eyes knows that you project yourself into every kid you meet, desperate to give them the childhood you didn’t get.”  She suddenly went silent, and Harry could tell that she’d not meant to go quite that far.
“He isn’t hurt, and he isn’t in trouble, but he’s terribly frightened,” Harry started.
“Of course!  Ginger is pleased to!”
Weasley looked frustrated.  “I don’t know!  He’s so good at covering his tracks!  I’ve suspected him for a while, but I think the last time he was in St Mungo’s with an injury, something they gave him reacted with whatever he’s been taking.  He’s gotten really weird.”
“I guess,” she said.  “I feel like all we’ve done is talk about the same things all day.”
“Yes, he does.  It isn’t true though.”
Finally, when his strength was nearly gone, he spun on his heel and ended up at the Apparation point down the street from Harry.  The little house, still under Fidelius, appeared in front of him.  Climbing the steps, Draco felt the wards accept him, a tingling, comforting wash of magic.  Entering the house, he found it dark and quiet.  Draco stole up the stairs, feeling the bannister solid and warm below his hands.  Entering Harry’s room, Draco inhaled Harry’s distinctive scent.  Draco pulled off his clothing, and climbed into bed.  Harry exhaled sleepily, turning over to wrap a leg firmly around Draco’s, and nuzzling his nose into Draco’s neck.
“Dad, you’re going to be fine.  I thought you said that people liked you.”
Harry’s condition was the other item that had cast a pall on his current happiness.  Draco carried an enormous amount of guilt over his inability to see that Harry was so wounded.  Inadvertently, he’d made things so much worse in the way he’d treated Harry during their relationship, and had solidified the damage by his actions when Harry had returned to England with Cass.  Whether he’d intended to hurt Harry or not, Draco acknowledged that he had.   Confronted by the impacts of his lack of caring, each week as he and Cass attended ‘Visitor’s Day’, it was impossible to ignore.
Cass made a face.  “You sound like you were a little monster.”
“What is it?” Weasley’s voice was, if possible, even more panic-stricken, and he was pointing a shaky finger at the floor of the shower room, where, sitting, bemused, on a fluffy towel was a baby.
“I haven’t ever touched anyone, other than incidentally.  I’ve never intentionally given or received any sort of…”
“I recall,” Draco said dryly.  “What about you?  Any movement on your big secret?”
“Why do you say that?”
“I’m awfully glad that you’re enjoying this.”
“He didn’t know.”  Harry’s voice had gone flat.  “He didn’t know about you.”
“It might take a while,” Draco admitted.  "But if you put on a helmet, you might feel braver."  Draco skated back to the dressing room, grabbed elbow and shin pads, a helmet and a jersey.  He strapped the pads onto Harry’s legs, keeping his face resolutely away from Harry’s crotch, and then got his elbow pads tightened.  He pulled the jersey over Harry’s riot of hair, and slammed the helmet on for good measure.
And then he kissed Draco.  This time the kiss wasn’t a tentative press of lips.  Harry’s tongue was audaciously thrusting into his mouth, and he sucked on Draco’s bottom lip and then he was crushed against Draco’s body, his erection hard against Draco’s thigh.  They kissed and kissed, and Draco’s lips were hurting and chapped, but he didn’t give a fuck, because it was as though someone had told him that he was allowed to have air again.  It was delicious.  Harry pulled away to catch his breath.
Harry was at the stove before she’d had a chance to remove her scarf and coat, but Cass was there waiting, and took them to hang up.  When she left the room, Minerva said, “She’s lovely, Harry.”
“Nothing.  Lay low for a week or so.  Stay out of trouble.  Don’t punch anyone.”
Draco stands and gathers Scorpius in his arms before depositing him into his cot.  “He wasn’t,” he says softly, as I follow him from the room.
He eyes my body appreciatively before saying, “You’re back.”
Draco felt his arms encircle Harry, one of his hands carding through his hair.  It was incredibly soft.  Harry’s tongue was in his mouth, and without thinking, Draco sucked it.  Harry’s groan went straight to Draco’s cock, and he was instantly hard, straining against his tight Quidditch pants.  He pulled Harry closer, and ground his erection into Harry’s thigh.
“Draco, it’s fine.  You don’t have to apologize.  I forgot.  Anyhow, we’ve made a breakthrough.  We should get some sleep, in the morning, we can calculate the exact ratio and timing.”
“I feel like I’m being sent to my death,” Draco says bleakly.  Harry knows that feeling.  He nods, crouches between Draco’s knees, looks up into his face.
“Oh, Narcissa,” Harry sighed.  “I’m so sorry that you found yourself in that position.  I doubt it makes you feel any better, but I have no doubt that your intentions were good.  Besides that, to regret not speaking up would be to regret Astoria and Scorpius, and I know how much you love them.  Who knows whether Draco wanted anything different at the time, but I have no doubt he is happy with his family.”  He pursed his lips ruefully.  “We’re quite a pair, aren’t we?  Both of us live with the shame of knowing that we’ve wronged Draco in some way.”
“Just try and stop me.  And we'll floo call every day.”
Cici’s face was kind.  “Honestly Draco, I’m very optimistic that she’ll wake up.  I just can’t promise you.  If she isn’t awake by tomorrow morning, we’ll discuss next steps.  It’s entirely possible that she’s just a bit more susceptible to sleeping draughts, and her body needs a bit of time to recover.  Do you think that Harry would take a calming draught?  Do you want one?”
to these people?  It had been bad enough the first time I showered, discovering a roadmap of scars across my body.  I know they’ve told me I’m in law enforcement, but I must be absolutely
“So will you seek election?”
George grinned.  “You tell her that.”
“They’d come and get us, you know, if something happened.”
Harry didn’t want to hope.  If he allowed himself to hope, and was disappointed again, he wasn’t sure if he would recover.
“We do,” she says.  “It’s been an unofficial policy that those who have performed a service to the school, those who are loyal to Hogwarts, are always welcome, but it’s just that…unofficial.  Officially, only students, board members, staff and those who are specifically invited are allowed to pass through the gates.  Ordinarily, I would never close the doors to people who fought for Hogwarts in the way that your friends have.”
“Yes.  Yes.  Why?”  Yes, this was better.
“I can’t believe that Scorpius was more invested in having his tantrum than in enjoying time with Cass,” Astoria said, giving him a pointed look.
“It’s new,” she says shortly.  “It’s called the Room of Inheritance.”
“Why are you here?”
“Can we go see the Chamber of Secrets first thing?  No, wait, I want to see Uncle Professor’s classroom.  And the Library.  And the Room of Requirement.”
Draco’s voice was stilted, in that formal tone he adopted when he felt that he was in the right.  Harry pictured the look on his face as they lay quietly in the dark.  Despite the fact that he’d mellowed since the war had ended, Draco was still awfully proper, and insisted on adherence to manners, and tradition, and order.  Harry thought of the angled lines of his face, and how he adopted a look that was eerily similar to his Mother’s, any time Harry took things a little too casually.
“You’re brave,” Scorpius told Cass when Dean had left.  “Sometimes I cry when they take blood.”
No.  “Yes.”
Harry sounded relieved as he said, “Okay.  Yeah.” He sighed again.  “This is so awful.”
“I did,” Draco replied, his face neutrally polite.
“I understand,” Harry said.  “What was Jemima doing before she got hurt?”
thing.  I want to prioritize the good of others above my own gain.”
“I was here.  I assure you I didn’t end up with Ginny fucking Weasley.  Not only is she a girl but she’s also like my sister.  Where are you getting this idea?”
“Oh,” Harry says, and he feels stupid and foolish, and wants to get up and leave.  This was a mistake.
“You don’t seem to want him to go to a magical primary, though.”
“Scorpius?” His tone changed immediately, low, urgent with fear.
“Back to not knowing?  No.  Only forward,” he said gently.
Harry’s laughter quickly subsided as he realized that he’d unintentionally insulted Draco.  “Baby, I’m sorry,” he said quickly, still a little breathless.  “Draco?”
“The very same.  He’s still a little surprised that his class numbers are so low, but no harm done.”
Harry laughed.  “A bit of one.  Do you have a second?”
Draco didn’t say anything, and his face looked totally different without his trademark sneer.  Harry continued, “So, Minerva McGonagall, of all people, intervened, and basically shamed the Wizengamot, and Kingsley, and, well, everyone, I suppose.  She took me back to Hogwarts, and let me follow Hagrid around for a few months, keeping up the Castle and tending to creatures and stuff.  And when I got a bit better, I sat down with Kingsley, and we talked, and I realized what I was passionate about, and the whole Department for Magical Accidents and Catastrophes got revamped, and here I am.”
“Really?  Funny, it seems like I’m wrong a lot.  Do you accept my apology?”
There are endless cups of tea, and someone puts on some music, quiet.  They sit around Blaise’s flat for hours, mostly lost in their own thoughts.  Dean looks like a broken thing.  He sits, utterly silent and still, Blaise wrapped around him, stroking his arm.  Sometimes, tears roll down Dean’s cheeks, but he doesn’t notice them, just sits unmoving, while Blaise mops them away helplessly.
“I’m always busy, Potter.  What do you want?”
“‘Dromeda,” Harry began, his voice a little sharp.
“You won’t get blamed if you fix him,” Weasley said lowly.
“How am I supposed to concoct a cover story for him when I’m carrying around a little munchkin with black hair and green eyes?”
“I’m glad,” he says, but that’s not strictly true either.  He’s incredibly protective of Harry, and he refuses to stand by while people manipulate him.  Harry too, has gotten much better at setting boundaries, but he seems to appreciate that he doesn’t have to do it all on his own, and his gratitude, on the few occasions when Draco has stepped in to help, has been expressed in creative ways that Draco will never complain about.
“I know, I know,” Draco soothed, once again struck by the discordance of comforting Ron Weasley about their mutual worry for Harry Potter.  Ron seemed to be thinking the same thing, because he gave Draco a slightly mad grin that made them both laugh.
Ron, who had been happily working his way through the jam tarts that Harry had brought, cleared his throat.  “Harry, mate, have you time to go for a pint?”
“Do you mind if I go in and have a look?  I don’t mean to intrude, but I’m more likely to know what to look for.”
“Have I?  Got you?”
“I don’t know what kind of bloke I used to be, but I’d never allow someone to cheat on their spouse with me.”
“Honestly, who has a fucking engagement party the
“Will you come back?”  Draco’s voice reveals a lot of the terror he’s feeling.
“Ah, he’s your mate!” The snake seems enthusiastic.
“Pottah!” Harry, the little traitor, said, through a mouthful of smashed peas.
We arrive at Malfoy Manor, and the wards accept us immediately, prompting me to wonder exactly what Pansy’s relationship with Draco consists of, and why he wasn’t helping her when she was arrested.  There are more important things to think about though, and she leads me to a sitting room, where a hunched, defeated figure slumps in an armchair by the fire.   All of my earlier irritation dissolves when, hearing our entry, Draco looks up.
“You might forget that you’re gay.”
When he turned, the look on his face made Hermione’s welcome small fall away.  “Oh no,” she said.  “Was Cass not a match for Scorpius?”
Harry placed his fork gently down in his plate, dabbed at the corner of his mouth with his napkin, and said, “Cass, get your things, please.”
“Ice cream!” Hermione interrupts Ron, and her face is determined.  “Let’s go get ice cream.”
“It’s noble that you want to help Harry.  I’m so proud that your first instinct is to help him.  But as your therapist, it’s my job to ensure that you’re choosing what’s best for you.”
Harry was surprised that Draco didn’t demand to know who had upset Scorpius, but he approved.  The last thing they needed was for Scorpius to relive the emotions that had caused the magical explosion in the first place.
“No, darling.  Gin.”
“I’m not sure if it helps,” she begins, and I have some momentary terror that she can read minds, “but Draco has been fascinated by you since he was a small boy in a robes shop.  I don’t expect that will change, regardless of your decision.”  She’s gone before I can respond.
“I don’t know, Hermione!  It’s not like when she was little, and she’d go off to the fort when she wanted to be secretive.”
“I don’t know, I haven’t exactly been following him around.”
“What did you say?”
“Goodnight, Harry.  Nox.”
I’ll be training all morning.  Come when you like.
He regards me for a very long time, searching my face for something.  Finally, he says, “Not weird bad.”  It isn’t much to go on, but it’s a start.
“Is that what I did?”  Harry knew he should be more upset about this.  He also knew, that when the adrenaline wore off, he would be, so he decided to enjoy this part while it lasted.
“Are you here to yell at me for that?” I ask.
Cass shifted from where she was snuggled on Harry’s other side.  “Dad?  Should we do something about your hand?”
“Fine, mostly,” I say.  “Draco’s a bit upset, obviously, but I’m just looking forward to when the dust settles some and I can go back to work.”  I’m still annoyed that I’d barely started my new job when things got so crazy and I wasn’t able to show up, but Florean’s been gracious, and I was able to sort things out by owl with the solicitor and the bank, so they can afford to hire help.
“And his planned appointment to the position of Head Auror?”
Harry isn’t expecting the question, but he understands what she’s asking.  It’s something that nobody has been brave enough to ask him, but he knows that everyone wonders.  Wonders if he’s jealous of Ron and Hermione, or if he feels threatened that the Gryffindor Three is now a two plus one.  “No,” he says honestly.  “I don’t really know how to love someone properly.  I’m happy that other people find it, but I don’t feel like I’m missing out.  I guess I’m just grateful for what I do have.  It’s a lot more than I expected.”
But that wasn’t everything.  Certainly Harry had been humbled by his recent setbacks, but there was also a fundamental shift, somewhere at his core.  He was a little less accommodating than he once was.  He considered more before he spoke, and sometimes, if he wasn't sure, he’d simply decline to comment at all.  At his base level, however, he was still the same funny, quirky man that Draco fell in love with, and it was hard to watch him as he eked out inconsistent progress, week by week.
He stood, a little stiffly, and took their dishes to the kitchen.  He put them in the sink, a little harder than necessary, and started to wash them.  One cup in particular seemed to have a hint of a tea stain on it, and so he concentrated hard on eradicating it.  As he rubbed the soapy sponge on the cup, over and over, he blinked hard to keep his stupid, foolish tears at bay.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, and was a little surprised to find that he meant it.  He was sorry for Hermione, who would now have to cause unimaginable strife amongst her family.  He was sorry for Ron, who would have to reconcile the space between his little sister’s duplicity and his longtime best friend.  He was even sorry for Ginevra, who, although her actions were reprehensible, was so desperate to make Harry love her that she did the unthinkable.  Draco knew only too well what it felt like to be faced with unsurmountable challenges from all angles.  Most surprisingly, though, he was heartrendingly sorry for Harry, who, when he was finally adult enough to understand it, would have to cope with the betrayal of someone who he trusted, a member of his chosen family.  “I’ll do everything I can to help you,” he said quietly, and Hermione’s deep brown eyes filled with tears.
Harry can’t stop the laugh that rings harshly from his throat.  “Ironic, isn’t it, that Snape has been the most reliable parental figure in my life, and he hated me from the first moment he laid eyes on me.”
Harry paused, considering how to answer this.  “I think that all of us have pain in our lives,” he said eventually.  “I have.  I’ve also had joy.”
He’d waited nearly a week, thinking it over, and deciding what he wanted to say.  When he finally approached the teacher, he was a mass of nerves, stumbling over his words, and unable to look her in the eye.  As he finished his stammering explanation, he chanced a look up through his fringe.  The teacher was looking carefully at him, and Harry allowed himself to feel a tiny thread of hope.  “Thank you for telling me this, Harry,” she said.  “I will look into it.”
This was veering into territory that Harry didn’t feel was productive for an introduction to magical Britain, but once they started learning more about magic, they’d inevitably learn about Harry Potter.  “I was,” he said carefully, “but unfortunately, my parents died when I was very young, and I was raised by a non-magical aunt and uncle.”
“I’m asking you to leave this alone.  It’s important.”
“What are you frightened of?”
“I’m kind of disgusting, do you mind if I quickly shower?  Are you cold?  Do you want a change of clothes?”
Draco heartily agreed, but said, “Yes, Mother, of course it is.”  He’d found, in his dealings with his parents, that the best defence was a confident offence.  “And to what do we owe the pleasure of your company?  Are you joining us for dinner?”
“How did Draco Malfoy escape this?  From what I hear, he was one of only a few students who took the Dark Mark.”
“I know.  But I need that job.”
A young witch stood.  “Mister Potter, welcome back to England.  Where have you been for the past ten years?”
“You aren’t.”
Her eyes were hard.  “Oh, yeah?  Are you really the poster child for healthy distance from guilt?”
“Is the butter in Butterbeer made from magical cows?” Harry suddenly asked, his voice unnaturally loud, and jolting Draco from his doze.
“I resent your tone, Mother.  I seem to recall both you and Father encouraging me to restore the Malfoy name.  And you certainly didn’t ask any questions when Astoria and I began our courtship.”  Draco continued to watch his Father and Cass.  They were chatting animatedly, and at one point, Cass laughed, her beautiful face looking warm and happy.
“It’s Harry, you dumb fuck!”
“And you know that I cannot guarantee his safety?  If I accept your offering, I can lead you to him, but he may not be whole.”
“It’s just as I imagined it,” Cass said.  “Could I see the workshop?”
When he arrived at the apparation coordinates, Harry realized he was near Scorpius’ school.  A number of emergency vehicles were parked in front, their coloured lights contributing to the chaos.  Harry noticed that some of the windows of the school had been blown out.  He used his Galleon to upgrade the emergency to a Code Red, summoning every available Obliviator and Task Force member.  Suitable explanations would need to be provided, as there was no way that this wouldn’t reach the press.
“What’s your number, right now?”
“Or, you might not.”  I don’t know if she means that I won’t get my memories, or if I won’t be furious, but it doesn’t matter.
“Well, I never!” The woman seems to double in size, filled with air, and affront.  Her cheeks grow pink.  “Of course I bought it here.”
“You’re joking.”  Draco felt suddenly cold.  He noted, with a detached sort of alarm, that Cass and Lucius had stood and were walking away.
“How’s your hand?”
“If it hasn’t happened yet, I doubt it will.”
He pulls away, and his eyes open, but he won’t meet mine.  “Go ahead,” he says.
Harry laughed.  “I promise you that you’ll see all of those things, but first we need to go to our quarters and get settled.  There are a lot of details we need to sort out.”
“Not nearly curious enough to invest this much energy.”
“I imagine you get all the ice cream you want, though.”
“He’s holed up in Hogwarts, thanks to his stunt at the Press Conference.”
“Desire’s a funny thing,” Draco mused.  “Of course I’d love to see him again, but it isn’t likely to happen, and I seem to have stopped pining for things I can’t have.”
“Wait, what?”
I grin.  “A gentleman never kisses and tells.”
“And you say that the devil spawn is stubborn.”
“Will Mama be coming to the Healer’s office?”
“You need to talk to him.”
“Remus?”
“I can’t trust anyone,” he says wildly.  “You’ll turn me in, they’ll kill Scorpius!”
Draco smiled as he put the wordy parchment aside.  Hermione wrote exactly as she spoke, and it was lovely to imagine her voice.  He couldn’t help but marvel that he’d grown to like her so much.  If his eleven-year-old self could see him, he’d be mortified, but twenty-two year old Draco was proud that such a smart, kind girl could see good in him.  He still worried about screwing things up, and having her realize how unworthy he was of her friendship, but he resolved to enjoy it as long as it lasted.
“Sure.”
“It is.”
Harry sighed with relief.  “Thanks Dean.  I’m not trying to hide anything, but you know how they like to run with a story, and it’s not just my privacy at stake anymore.”
“You’ve always challenged me, Draco.  You drive me mad, and fascinate me in equal measure.  It wasn’t a conscious decision, but looking back, I can see that it kept me alive.  It took me ages to realize that I was in love with you, but once I did, I committed to it with every bit of myself.  I was determined that, if I just tried hard enough, I could win your love, and have a reason to live.
“No, I can see that.  Listen, when we get inside, I need you to be quiet.  If you wake the house up, it will be a nightmare.”
His lips tighten, and I see we’ve come to the ‘cut the bullshit’ portion of his speech.  “Harry, what exactly is going on between Draco Malfoy and yourself?”
Thanks as always, for reading, and I hope that everyone's staying safe in these weird times.
But, it was watching her interact with Scorpius that gave Draco the most joy.  Scorp had accepted Cass’ inclusion in their family easily, and he followed Cass around like a duckling.  On the occasions where he was intractable, she could easily talk him around, and, since he’d recovered from his condition, he was finally able to learn to ride the broomstick that had become his most treasured possession.  Cass patiently flew with him, staying close to the ground, and correcting his form with loving encouragement.  She never grew tired of his incessant questions, and Scorpius had benefited from her dedication to schoolwork.  His own study habits had improved dramatically.
“Thanks, Dad.  It’s brilliant.”  Cass pulled the cloak on, saying, “Now, if only I had my wand,” and disappeared through the door with Ginger, leaving Harry to worry about what lay ahead of him.
The look on Draco’s face altered so suddenly, it was as though he’d been slapped.  “She has a star name,” he said quietly.
“I know.  But don’t be.  We knew that we were on borrowed time.  You’ve been betrothed to Astoria since you were seven years old.  Lucius isn’t a patient man.”
The parchment attached to the owl’s leg contained just a few lines, but Harry’s instinct pinged a little.  Having learned over the years, that instincts were fine and good, but worrying about them would solve nothing, he scribbled a few lines onto a fresh parchment, affixed it to the owl’s leg, and sent it on its way.
“Draco, don’t jump to that conclusion.”  Hermione’s forehead was wrinkled, as though she was thinking hard, there was a connection somewhere, and she was exerting herself to make it.  “I know that Harry didn’t get along with his Aunt and Uncle.  I always wondered whether they were…I don’t know…neglectful.  Some of the things he’d say when he was back at Hogwarts after the summer…He always asked us to send him food for his birthday.  Draco, I’m sure of it.  He’s little because he’s been abused.”
“Of course,” Arthur’s voice was quiet, but his tone was firm.  “Of course you were frightened, Harry.  We all understand that.  I just want you to know, so that there’s no question of it going forward.  You’re one of ours, Harry.  Molly and I love you as much as we do the rest of our children.  There is nothing in the world that you could do that would make us turn away on you.  Nothing.  And as for you, young lady,” Arthur turned mock-stern eyes on Cass.  “It’s not every day that you get a child back
Cass was watching him intently, her grey-green eyes wide, and her face pinched in a way that suggested that she was considering his words carefully.
“And now?” Draco asks.
Despite the fact that I’ve pretty much reached the end of my patience, I keep my voice even.  “Listen, I can understand that if I wasn’t out to you guys before, you’re a bit surprised, but I don’t think you’re going to be able to yell at me and turn me straight, even if you really, really want me to be.”  They look dubious, and I’ve had it.  “But, if you don’t believe me, let’s go find Jenny, and I’ll see what I can do.”  Of course, I have no intention at all of seeing what we can do, but it’s been a strange couple of days, and I’m starting to get awfully tired of people doubting one of the things I have actual empirical data to support.  Ron goes purple again, and seems incapable of speech, which…good.  (Also, I didn’t forget that her name was Ginny that time, but there’s a small part of me that’s really enjoying winding them up a little).
“Did your court case not go well?”
“Well,” Draco began, “No. I’m not sure it is at all.  But he owled me.”
“I…Yes, I suppose so.  We all do, a bit.”
Draco, on the other hand, had been far more cautious about any public attention.  At first, Harry had been easily contented by Draco’s protests of, “Don’t you see, I want something that nobody knows about, something that’s just for me.”
“Yeah, I’d be pretty annoyed with her if she wasn’t mad.”
He waved his wand in the direction of the shelf, and all of the stuffed toys tumbled to the floor.  One by one, he meticulously arranged them, before spelling them all back down and doing so again. And again.  He was about to do so for another round of three, when a noise behind him startled him, and he whirled around to face his adversary.  Only to find Harry, looking mortified.  “I’m so sorry,” he said lowly.  “I was going to sit down, stay out of your way, and I bumped into the wall. I didn’t mean to disturb what you were doing.”
“Maybe,” Harry allowed.  “But until you talk to her, you’re only guessing, and that’s not really fair to either of you.”  He took a long breath, focusing on suppressing his growing annoyance.  Ron and Hermione had no idea how bloody
“Actually,” Draco said, “I have an appointment that I can’t miss on Thursday.  You’re welcome to come tomorrow, but I need help on Thursday at one, specifically.”
“Fine, Papa, but I know I have to go.”  Scorpius’ tears were lessening, as he calculated the exact moment of Draco’s capitulation.
At the end of the following day, Harry returned to fetch Cass in time for dinner, and had responded to Astoria’s owled invitation to join them.  He crossed the floo and was immediately overwhelmed by the gangly arms and legs of his enthusiastic daughter.  He seemed equally excited to see her and Draco tried to ignore the pang that struck his heart like a gong.
Draco stood, shocked by the bout of accidental magic. His temper and panic had gotten the best of him on countless occasions before, but he hadn’t performed accidental magic in years.  He raised his wand, about to spell the glass back into its expected shape, but then, with a growl of fury, his thoughts again turned to Harry, and turned back to the floo. He checked his watch.  It was nearly midnight.  Despite the late hour, he made his decision.  There was another momentary delay as he fought his fears, but ultimately, his concern for Harry’s safety won out, and in a flash of green flames, he stepped into the floo and spun away.  It was when he emerged into Ron and Hermione’s sitting room that he saw an enormous flash, felt a pain in his chest, and then Draco knew only darkness.
“Oh my gods, Harry, is that really what you think?”  Draco’s eyes glistened.  He was sitting so close, and this was so much, and if he wasn’t careful, Harry would start believing that this meant something, and he was pretty sure he wouldn’t survive a Draco-related heartbreak a second time.  Harry shrugged, his eyes darting towards the door, trying to think of a way to end this conversation.
She frowns.  “You don’t really drink, Harry.  Butterbeer, mostly.”
“How could she afford it?” Ron said.  "She’s still making crap money as a reserve with the Harpies, and Harry hasn’t given her a key to his vault yet.  I walked in on them fighting about it one day.  Ginny was in a right strop, but Harry said that it was his parents’ money, and he didn’t feel right spending it.”
“But I’m a freak.”
And, a couple of drops later, followed by the terrifying bout of not breathing, and casting
“I thought Orion might,” Cass admitted, poking her father’s baby bump with affection.  “But he’s already proving to be a superior younger brother, since he waited for me to get home before being born.”
“Do you promise me,” Mrs. Powers said savagely, “that this will give my Violet a better life?”
“So you did love him?”
“You don’t need to earn your keep, Harry, Merlin.  You’re seven!”
“Hello, are you Mr. Sanders?”
“Yup,” I respond, and really, if my house elf knew that I was gay, why didn’t my two best friends?
“We might have been.”
“Will you explain someday?”
It’s my first day of work at Fortesque’s and it’s barely eleven o’clock when the shop gets so busy that I don’t notice the time passing.  At 2:30, Louise throws me a big smile.  “Go take a break, Harry.  You’ve been going steady since this morning.”
Harry smiled.  “Things were a bit different back then.  First-Gen Magicals were approached near their eleventh birthday, just in time for them to attend Hogwarts.  But yes, I was just as surprised as Violet was to learn that I had magic.”
“Who’s Uncle Professor?”
“Okay, we’re taking you back to Grimmauld, then.  It’s not Tuesday, but if there was ever a reason for Liquor Potluck, it’s this.”
“No, stay,” I say.  “We still have to figure out what to do about Wendell and the Ministry and everything, but I want to find out what happened first.”
“Draco, are you gay?”
“Yes, I carried her.”
Harry smiled.  Of course Andromeda would know who he was talking about.  “Did you know that he has a little boy?”
Mrs. Powers was still watching him carefully.  “I think,” she said softly, “that you do understand.  You’ve had a painful life, haven’t you, Mr. Potter?”
“It’s obviously whatever fell on him.  What are you up to, Malfoy?”
“It wasn’t worth it.  It would never have worked out.  I knew that you and Father would have been furious.”
But.  It didn’t mean that she didn’t feel lonely, and sad.  She wished that they’d never come to England.  And now, she was trapped here, because her Dad obviously couldn’t take her back, not if he needed to be alone to think.  She loved her family here, Scorp was a lot of fun, and Astoria was like a big sister, and her Papa was nice, even if he was completely different from Dad.  Dad was open and friendly, and threw himself into everything as hard as he could, while Papa was…not.  He was kind, and smart, but Cass sometimes felt like he had an invisible bubble around him that prevented anyone from getting too close.  He was a bit more unguarded around Scorpius, but was very careful around Cass.
Draco sighed.  Stupid bloody Potter.   He knew that Cass was loyal to the only father she knew, but why didn’t anyone care that Draco was the wronged party?  “I’m sorry,” he said finally.
Papa sighed.  “I don’t know,” he finally said.  “I wouldn’t have wanted him to take you away completely.  I can’t say how things would have been different, but I think I would have wanted to share you, at least.”
“No, you idiot.  I know where he is.  And everything isn’t okay, actually.  He’ll kill me when he finds out I’m here, but there’s nobody else who will help us.”
Her gaze goes a little faraway, and it’s clear she’s thinking hard.  As she bites her lip, I immediately know a few things.  She knows a way to find Scorpius.  She’s hesitant, so it’s either risky or immoral.  And she’s going to tell us no matter what.  “What is it?” My voice is quiet as I ask, but she still jumps a mile.
The woman’s shoulders stiffened.  “I could take her away,” she said, her voice low and harsh.  “I could take her away from you people and all of this.”
“If you’ve convinced yourself you don’t need to be happy, fine, but did you really need to take Harry down with you?”
loves Harry.  Even Draco has to admit that, now that he’s not sharing a soul with a madman, he's surprisingly easy to get along with.  Harry flirts indiscriminately with everyone he crosses paths with, and Draco supposes that they’re flattered by the attention of the ‘Man who Saved us All’.
“Some people died that night,” Harry says, “but it just took their bodies a bit longer to catch up.  It doesn’t mean that we grieve them any less.”  He gets up, goes inside and takes a turn sitting with Dean.
“Yes, of course.  She’s staying well, but thank you for your concern, and for welcoming us today.”
I laugh.  “It wasn’t deliberate!  You were kneeling at my feet.  What was I supposed to do?”
With a groan, Harry slumped onto the desk, scrubbed his hair out of his eyes.  And that was when he saw the document that sat on Draco’s desk blotter.
“Oh,” Draco said, surprised.  “That’s…thank you, Potter.”
Harry nodded.  “It does.  I think it’s a good way to give him an understanding of many cultures.  Do you like his school?”
“I know!  I just wanted him to have a few days where he had someone on his side.  I expect he’s going to hate me even more when he remembers.”
“Fair point.  All’s fair in the name of science.”
“Oh,” Draco said recovering his poise, “I didn’t realize.”
“You did?  Why didn’t you ask me what I wanted?”
Scorpius’ grey eyes filled again. “I’m sorry, Papa,” he whimpered.
“But I still feel like I have an itch I can’t reach,” I admit.  “I know that there’s something going on at the Ministry.  I don’t know who to trust.  And as much as I want to just walk away from it….”  Luna’s expression is incredibly kind, and it encourages me to continue.   I give her some very broad strokes about my suspicions about Smith, about Mill, about the fact that someone’s targeting the children of Death Eaters.  “I think my life was kind of awful, before, though.  And I want to be selfish, and do what I want.  I don’t want to be in danger for the sake of people that I don’t even remember.”
“What?” Draco’s voice sounded a bit more unhinged than he liked it to.  “What recognized him?”
“Fine, spoilsport.  Thank you for the cupcake, though.”
She sees something in his expression, and her face softens.  Draco suddenly sees the resemblance between this woman and his Mother.  “You’d better come inside.”
Kreacher, it turned out, had rather a lot to say.  He was positively aghast at how thin Harry was, and tried to slam his head in the oven door until Draco made him stop.  He muttered some, about how ‘the little Master would be eating his good food that his good elf made’.  Harry watched the whole scene unfold with horror.  “Do you remember Kreacher, Harry?”
I groan, even as I know he’s right.  “I don’t want to,” I sigh.
“You didn’t realize that I was saying that?” Harry persisted.  Draco shook his head again, words utterly failing him.  Harry smiled a bit uncertainly.  “It’s okay if you don’t feel the same way,” he said.  “but I just wanted you to know.”
“And if I don’t?  Is someone else intervening?”  He looks away again.  “Damnit, Draco, what’s going on?”  I’m frustrated, and I take a step closer to him.  The angry expression on his face falters for a moment, but returns in force as his grey eyes meet mine.
at him, had known that he was different, wrong.  It feels like Luna has slapped him.  It feels like he will never be okay again.
“Do that,” Harry says, his perfect teeth flashing white as he grins.
Draco’s smile felt bitter.  “Thank you Mother. I don’t think that there will be any way for us to come back from such a betrayal, but it does mean a lot that you’re willing to provide your blessing.”
Papa didn’t say much after that, but he looked like he was considering it.  Maybe he’d help.  Cass wasn’t sure though, and it didn’t do anything to stop her from feeling scared.
“I’m sorry, Harry, Cass has likely already gone home, but yes, you may leave if you want,” Miriam said.  “I’d like to speak with Draco for a little while anyway.”
“Oh yes,” Narcissa said, her voice suddenly icy.  “I expect it’s going to take quite some time for you to explain to me how you could be so stupid as to kidnap Harry Potter, and turn him into a child.  Honestly, Draco, I know that you’ve carried an unhealthy obsession with that boy for most of your life, but this is beyond the pale!  I know you’ve been struggling with your…issues for a while, but if I ever imagined you’d be capable of such a truly mad course of action, I would have stopped you in your tracks.”
“Good,” I say.  “It’s strange, but I’m healthy.  Just confused, but I remember how to get to the ice cream place, so all the important stuff is still there.”
“I am,” she agreed with a sunny smile.
Besides, to me, he's asking all the wrong questions.  Why are they so focused on whether someone is Dark or not?  People aren't entirely bad or good, and people do all sorts of different things, for all sort of reasons.  Do these lunatic wizards really put someone in one box or the other and decide that it makes them good or bad?  I don’t remember meeting the man, but surely Dumbledore, Light wizard that he was, has a fair bit to answer for.
“They’re hypothetical conceptualizations of important mental functions,” Hermione says.  She takes in our blank look and sighs.  “Okay, look.  Imagine that there are three different factors that keep your mind and your behaviour in balance.  The id is an unconscious, impulsive part of your psyche.  It wants what it wants.  It’s all about your basic needs and desires.  If you think about a baby, they’re purely id.”
“Don’t finish that sentence,” Ron orders.  I yank my arm free, and I’m about to protest being treated like an errant toddler, when he looks at Malfoy, and says, “Listen.  He’s not in his right mind, Malfoy.  He doesn’t know what’s going on.  He doesn’t know you.  He doesn’t know
“Later.  Sleep.”
“That’s not true!”
“You haven’t told Granger?”
Draco felt his face fall before he hastily erected the mask that he’d been taught before he’d emerged from toddlerhood.  He attempted to produce a decent sneer, only to find that he couldn’t.  He was exhausted, and he just wanted to leave.
I shrug.  “I don’t hate you now.”
Luna doesn’t look at him, not once, until the funeral is over, and they’re all back at the Manor, lounging around in trackies, and drinking beer.  Harry has known that this conversation has been inevitable, but he wishes futilely for more time.  He’d spent a lot of the evening locked to Draco’s side, hoping that it would protect him…surely no one would be so insensitive as to bring up bad blood while Draco was grieving?
“Oh, um…” Harry examined it.  The bruising had gotten worse, but the bleeding had stopped.  “Fine, thanks.”
“I am?”  Violet’s eyes were enormous.
“I bet that made you upset,” Harry said.
After Cass had reluctantly gone to bed, placated somewhat by the promise that Auntie Min would teach her to bake scones the following morning, Harry took the bottle of Scotch from the cupboard, and poured them each a sizeable glass without asking.  Minerva perched on the sofa, while Harry flopped into an armchair, where he could see both Minerva and Severus.
“She’ll be fine,” he says.  “She’s disappointed, hell, we’re all disappointed.  You’re the least objectionable brother-in-law we could have picked, but if it’s not going to work out, better you know now, right?”
I’m startled.  “Oh.  Um.  Thanks?”
“I don’t think my Aunt Andromeda would agree.”
“Harry-”
As he examined her carefully, Harry seemed entranced by the woman.  His hands came up to touch her face, but he hesitated at the last second, and ultimately allowed only a single finger to touch the side of her lips.  “Wow,” Harry breathed, allowing his finger to gently explore Narcissa’s cheek, but returned to her full red lips.  Narcissa laughed, and pretended to bite the chubby digit, prompting a chuckle from Harry.  He looked at Draco, his forehead crinkling, and then back at Narcissa.  “Mama?” His voice was uncertain, and his eyes swept back to Draco’s for confirmation.
Things were nearly perfect, were it not for two unresolved items.  Cass had suffered from nightmares since discovering her Dad, incoherent in a closet, and she spent an hour each week with a Mind Healer, working through her trauma.  Draco had also communicated his concerns about her tendency to try to take care of her Dad.  A child, especially one with the amount of self-awareness that Cass possessed, can sense when those around them aren’t fully honest, and Harry had been carrying trauma, and guilt, and cripplingly low self esteem for her whole life.  As a result, she’d sensed how they plagued him, and had overdeveloped her own independence, in an effort to reduce his burden.  It showed remarkable emotional intelligence, and flexibility, but Draco worried that it had also developed a tendency to sublimate Cass’ own needs for the sake of those she cared about.
The silence stretches too long, and Harry nods at him, and turns back into the room he’d exited.  He emerges with a trunk.  “You’re really leaving?” Draco asks.
“You wouldn’t be.  It would be a big change from what you’re doing now, but…” Kingsley sighs.  “Harry, I’m sure you can imagine how important it is to keep stability in the high-ranking Ministry offices, even this long after the War.  Our community's faith was shaken by what happened during Voldemort’s siege.  The Ministry has a lot to answer for, as a governing body, and if we don’t have their trust…”. He regards me with a mix of affection and sternness.  “You are the most trusted individual in our society, Harry.  You’re the one who saved us all.  To see you rising through the ranks in our law enforcement body gives people hope, it keeps their faith that the Ministry is learning from the mistakes of our past.  You can’t underestimate the importance of your role.”
“Well, Healer, I’m a Malfoy.  I’ve been trained since birth to behave with decorum.  I’m afraid if you could see how I was feeling inside you’d be disappointed.  I’m devastated I that have to face this, but I appreciate the kind words”
“We didn’t steal you,” Draco said, a little stung.  “This whole stupid mess was
“Who?” I ask.  “Who’s taken him?”
“Aww, Harry, I don’t know.  I think Luna and Hermione have awful bloody cheek to try to nag you into something you haven’t asked for.  But, aside from that,” and here Ron looks at him, his blue eyes as clear and honest as they always have been, “I think that you’re my best mate, and that there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to see you happy.  I think you’ve been through all sorts of shit, and it’s left you a bit scared of asking for anything for yourself.  And, I think that the people who love you would be thrilled to bring you a piece of the moon if you managed to ask for it.”
The owl that arrived the following morning was beginning to look irritated that he was back.  Draco was shocked to see him, but said, “Go find one of the elves and they’ll get you a snack,” as he untied the letter.  The owl cocked its head at Draco, as though he were unsure why Draco wasn’t fetching the snack himself.  Draco ignored the bird, and unwrapped the parchment.
“Anything is possible, brat.  You could blow yourself up in that infernal workshop of yours.  That menace of a daughter upstairs could become the next Dark Lord.”
“You were
He threw off his apron, set his tools aside, and hurried into the house, where Minerva McGonagall stood, beaming at Cass.  “Min,” he said thickly, emotion crowding into his voice.
“Do you think we’re the kind of people who will be friends after they break up?”  I sort of hate how vulnerable I sound.
“Well when you went to Canada, you left your heart here, didn’t you?”  Luna smiled gently at him.  “Excuse me, Draco, I need to go dance.”  The girl disappeared, her hips already swaying to music that likely only existed in her own head.
Ron and Hermione agree to take me to my flat.  Apparently, I’ve confirmed for them that I know enough wandless magic and remember enough of Diagon Alley not to be a danger to myself.  We clear the wards, and I look around.  It’s bland.  Clean enough, but from the brown sofa to the beige walls, I’m uninspired.  I look at the photos on the mantle.  “Who’s this guy?” I ask with interest.
“Merlin, Ron, of course we didn’t.  It’s a regulated substance, you twit.  Do you think we wanted Aurors swooping in to arrest us?”
, he thought to himself.
“Hello Mother,” Draco said, and crossed the room to greet her.  His lips stopped just shy of her upturned cheek, but, since that was normal for them, she gave him a breathtaking smile and then held her arms out to Harry.  His eyes widened, and quickly met Draco’s, as though he were asking permission.  Draco smiled encouragingly at him, and he slowly walked up to her, as though approaching a nesting dragon.
Draco nearly had a heart attack when Bellatrix Lestrange rounded the corner.  His breath quickened, and then his brain finally kicked in and he realized that this wasn’t Bellatrix at all.  She didn’t look mad, for one thing, and she was shorter, rounder than Bella had been.  She hugged Harry firmly before extending her hand to Draco.  “Well hello there,” she said calmly.
Harry frowned.  “Why would you think that?”
“Maybe,” he allowed.  “We never tested the magic levels in the rats before and after.  Is it possible that the potion just overwhelms them? Burns through the magic too quickly?”
He’s silent for so long I don’t think he’s going to answer, but he eventually says, “What if I want it to be something more than an amazing shag?”
“But why?  If I don’t earn my keep, and I make stuff break.  Why would you want to keep me?”
“Is there anything we can do?”
She winks at me, and I ease my way into the crowd.  It’s a sea of bodies, and I allow myself to be tossed along through the throng.  I get groped a few times, and I’m pleasantly half-hard by the time I find a little pocket of space.  The music is Muggle, complete with thumping beat, and it isn’t long before I’m gyrating along with everyone else, my drink gone and the glass banished to the bar.  The alcohol has made me feel sort of floaty, and I lose myself in the sensation of heat, and close contact with bodies that are a bit dewy with exertion.  Despite my carefully controlled attempts to avoid doing so, I cast a quick look around the club, seeking out the distinctive white-blond hair, and I can’t decide if I’m relieved or disappointed when I don’t see him.
“He’s alive, Draco, safe at St. Mungo’s.  He’s been injured, and the Healers are looking him over, but I think he’ll be fine.”
Draco nodded his understanding and the Healer left.  He reached out for Narcissa’s hand.  “Thank you, Mother.  I’ll be okay, you don’t have to hang on anymore,” he lied.
“Yes, of course I did,” he says, and directs a bemused little smile my way that has Draco clinging to my arm so I don’t leap up and strangle him.
say ‘no thanks to you’, which he attributes to the excellent mind-healer that Harry, and sometimes Draco, have seen since they started dating.   It hasn’t been easy for Harry, Draco acknowledges, but once he got a taste of what his life could be like, he’s been relentless in unlearning the thought patterns that life taught him.  Sometimes, he gets prickly, and distant, and Draco understands that he needs reassurance, but not guilt in those moments.  It wasn’t easy for Draco to learn that, but he has, and they’re stronger for it.  Adopting Scorpius has been another thing that has caused them the odd stumble, but Draco knows that Harry loves them both, and that he’ll do whatever it takes to make it work.
As he went downstairs, he found the sitting room empty, and no sign of Harry.  So that was it, Draco realized.  It was over.  Harry had obtained whatever sort of closure that he needed, and it was time for Draco to focus on the real reason he was here.
Harry, who had frozen at the word ‘punishment’, pushed past her and entered the room.  It was bare, save a mattress on the floor.  The woman screamed at him, “Get out! Malcolm is on restriction, I can’t have you-”
“Yeah, he’s fine.  Still slouching around the house like a bloody ghoul.  If he’s not snarling about something that’s made him mad, he’s sad about somebody he lost.  It wasn’t fun the first time, but at least all the drama was spread out, yeah?”
“But what if it wasn’t a criminal?”
“It is.  But it will be over soon, I’m sure of it.”
I concede defeat, and settle onto the couch with a thick photo album.  There’s a couple who could only be my parents.  I can’t remember their names, and it bothers me more than anything else has so far.  I can ask Hermione, of course.  I’m sure she’d know, but
Draco was hurt, Harry could tell.  He felt bad for having confessed his deepest fear this way, and he wished that he could express himself like Draco could. “Do you really think that, Harry?  Do you really believe that I’d hurt you like that?”  Draco sounded terribly sad.
to stop hugging Cass.  His normally tactile child was getting uncharacteristically irritated by how often Harry was holding her hand, or kissing her forehead. But every time he looked at her, he saw her, tiny and still, in her hospital bed, and he needed to remind himself that she was fine.
“’S’fine,” Draco said, still scrubbing, wearily resigned to having people befouling his house until he could fix this.
“I did, yeah.  They handled things a lot differently, then.”
Malfoy smiled at his son, who was looking hopefully between them.  “Well, you’re right that I don’t require any assistance in getting home, but I think Scorpius would be very pleased if you joined us for tea?”
“It’s okay, we’ll wait for it to make you feel a little better.”  Again, Draco wiped Harry’s face.  Harry looked so young while asleep.  Draco longed to take him in his arms.  He smoothed a hand down Harry’s back.
There was no razor, and he didn’t have his wand, so he left his facial hair as it was.  As he left the bathroom, he saw that Miriam was sitting at a table in the corner, and she smiled widely and gestured him to sit down.  She was a tiny woman, Harry guessed that she was in her fifties, and her eyes were very kind.  She made Harry feel protected right away, kind of the way that Minerva made him feel.
“I don’t think it would help anything.  I can’t change what’s happened.  I don’t expect that he would forgive me if he knew every detail.  Perhaps it is better for him to hate me than to realize that I had loved him, but not chosen him.”
“Harry.”  Draco rose and sat on the sofa beside him, his eyes grey, and lovely, and a bit sad.  “You still believe that our relationship had no effect on me at all?  That I didn’t care about you?”
Once they went inside, Teddy disappeared to his room to read, and Harry made his way to Andromeda’s kitchen, where he gratefully accepted a cup of coffee.  His kitchen had already waged war on the latest coffee maker, and he’d had to settle for a powdered instant abomination that morning.  “How’s work?” Andromeda asked, as she always did.  The older woman had been incredibly supportive of Harry’s career choice, and she loved hearing stories about young witches and wizards who were learning about their abilities.
The Secretary looked him over, and asked to see his ID.  He passed over the Ministry-supplied credentials and watched her closely.  Fortunately, they seemed to pass muster, and Harry was grateful he wouldn’t have to use a Confundus charm on her.  “There’s a little meeting room through here,” she said.  “Please have a seat and I’ll fetch Scorpius.”
“Of course you’re not,” Draco said, his voice dripping with irony.
“Oh.  Yes, of course, my dear.”  Lucius struggled to his feet and gestured to a chair beside him.
“Ron!  Hermione!  George!” Harry’s voice was joyous, as he took them all in.  Then he looked beyond them, to where Draco stood awkwardly, unsure of his reception.  “Draco,” he said, his voice softer, and his expression transfixed.  “Draco, you came!  You came to rescue me.”
Which is why I’m standing on Hermione and Ron’s porch after my shift, feeling awkward and unsure how to deal with all of this.  I wonder, briefly and futilely, if I would have been better at this with memories intact.  Hermione answers the door, and looks at me warily.  “Hi,” she finally says.  Her voice is small and unsure, and I’m terrified for a moment that she’s going to cry.
And then he had sent an owl to Draco that said:
“No, of course you didn’t.  Nobody did.  Anyways, I was heading to Knockturn, and I noticed that there was a new shop.  And through the window, I saw this flash of white-blond hair.  I didn’t go to Knockturn that day.  I went home, and spent the whole night wondering what sort of shop Draco Malfoy would have opened.  I came back every day for a week, trying to catch a glimpse of you through the window.
The little boy shook his head, refusing to look at Harry.  Harry sighed.  “Okay, I’ll be right back, okay?  I wanted to chat with you for a minute, but I just need to sort some things first.”  He left the room, and glared sternly at the woman.  “Come downstairs.”
“Well no, actually, you testified to keep him out.” Is it just me, or does Hermione’s voice sound grudging?  She hates being wrong, this one.
Harry appeared as though he was going to talk himself right out of a relationship at all, and Draco blurted out, “No!”  Harry jumped a little, startled.  Perhaps that had been a little louder than Draco intended.  “No,” he said, more quietly.  “I am.  Interested.  I’m very interested.  I…”.  He trailed off, gathering his courage to continue.  “I never got over you, Harry.  You’re like a part of my DNA by now.  I’m interested, and I want to make it work for us both.”
“Nobody will say anything.  When you’re ready.”
“Oh,” I say lamely.  “Well, shouldn’t we take advantage of the opportunity?”
“Harry!”  Draco’s whispered entreaty barely registers.
“Of course, Master Draco.  And Master Draco was getting an owl this morning.  Kattie has put the papers on your desk.”
“I’d feel a lot better if I had a wand, you know.”
He turns around, and Draco sees his face and immediately wishes he’d turn away again.  Pain this naked shouldn’t have to be witnessed.  “Draco, this has broken my fucking heart.  I have been
She looked at him, and said, “What.”  It was less a question than a demand for clarification.
“I am.  Everyone wants me to be alone.  I don’t like it.  I’ve been alone all week. ’S bollocks.  I’m going to go hang out with my friend Hannah.”
“Oh,” Draco said sadly, thinking about the time he’d invested in the inflammation reducer, and the amount of cleaning that would be required to set his lab to rights.  He spared a moment to consider berating Potter for his clumsiness, but, immediately rejecting the notion as not worth it, took a step towards the mess, and summoned his wand from its wrist holster.
Harry sighed, and ran his hands through his hair.  He removed his glasses, and cleaned them with the tail of his t-shirt before he replaced them on his nose.  “And then I said that all of those things were true, but that I’d had enough of being lied to and manipulated long before she and I got together, and I’d never be able to have a relationship with someone when I couldn’t trust them.”  His eyes met Draco’s for a moment, and they looked unbearably sad.  “She didn’t take that well.  She told me that nobody else would ever want anyone as damaged as me, that her whole family pitied me, and only allowed me to come around because of her.  She said that when they were faced with a choice between me and her, there’d be no question of who they picked.”
“Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?”  I don’t think I’m the sort to do any sort of effective seducing, so I hope he’ll just get the implication, and let me kiss him.
As always, thanks for reading and commenting/kudo-ing!
“Well, then it seems that he isn’t ready for dating.  Damnit, if it wasn’t for that stupid postcard, I’d have already given up.  Why is he so hard to understand?”
“Come, meet my Godson today,” Harry suggested.  “He’s your cousin, you know.”
“But why would you lie?”  Harry’s voice sounded so hurt, that Draco felt like crying.  “Why would you tell me something that wasn’t true?”
“You liked the training,” Ron says.  “Duelling and learning spells.  After we made Junior Aurors though, it was a lot of politics.  When it wasn’t about risking our lives.”
“Then it’s a pleasure to welcome you,” she replied, her face transforming into a sunny smile.  “I am Madame Lefebvre.”
“You think that someone at the Ministry of Magic deliberately fucked with the memory of the most famous Wizard alive?”
“No, it’s stupid.  I mean, you’ve had bad shit happen to you too, I’m just being stupid.  I just…I really wish I could be normal.”
“Of course,” she says.  Mill waves at me, and gives me another one of those amazing smiles as she departs.  “Have a seat, dear.”  I perch on the uncomfortable desk chair outside the office, and smile my thanks.  “How are you feeling?”
“Why do I even bother trying to study here?  It’s worse than the Burrow!” That was Granger’s voice.
“That’s not it, not really.  We just built our patterns when we were eleven.  I was a lazy little sod, who was used to getting my own way, and you were prone to throwing yourself in the path of danger without any consideration for your own hide.  She was the little know-it-all who did most of the research.  She’s good at it, and she kind of likes bossing us around, but it doesn’t hurt her to be reminded that we’re not kids anymore.”
“I can imagine.”
I don’t expect to hear from Draco, and even so, I’m deflated when I don’t.  I spend the day sulking moodily in bed, even as Kreacher arrives to provide me with an aggrieved harangue when I refuse food.  By late afternoon, I’m stiff and sore from laying around all day, and I drag myself into the shower, and put on a butter-soft pair of jogging pants and a henley.  They’re clearly leftovers from my school days, and it’s irritating that I’m short enough that they still fit, but their cosiness does a lot to redeem them.
“Well, no, that’s my point,” Harry said.  “I had a terrible temper when I was in school.  But I outgrew it.”
“Nah, I trust you, Draco,” Ron replied, giving them both an easy grin.  “Don’t stay out playing with potions too late, ‘Mione,”
“Luna, my Mum used to sing this to me,” Harry had replied, a bit frantically.  “I remember my mum singing this to me.”  She had pulled him tighter and together they listened to the lyrics:
“I suppose,” Draco said.  “No point in waiting, since you’ve validated my thought process.”  He conjured a rat, and took careful measurements of its length and weight, then dropped four drops of the tincture onto its back.  Nothing happened, and Hermione sighed deeply.  “It didn’t happen right away,” Draco said.  “Harry was in the decontamination shower when he changed.”  They waited a few more minutes, and Draco muttered, “I wonder,” before casting
“What?”
“Would you have?”
“Listen, Hermione, did you know that some of the Death Eater’s kids were still on probation?  And that they’re getting persecuted by their Probation officers?”
“Yeah, well, secretly dosing the Chosen One with illegal love potions crosses a fair few too.”  Ron’s cheeks were getting red, a telltale sign that he was getting frustrated.
“Um, sure?”
Ah.  The world
“None of that,” Draco reassured him.  “Mr. Harry and I just want to understand what happened.  It isn’t your fault.”
“Okay,” I say.  “Just for a minute.”
.  He had no business coaching children.  Anyone in my position would have reacted the same way.”
“What?”  Draco had looked completely gobsmacked.
“So, to summarize,” Harry began, “after having my life dictated to me by a bloody prophesy and a half-mad Headmaster, when I finally found happiness for myself, the person who was responsible for that happiness-" Draco’s voice made a strange choking noise then, the mention of him making Harry happy breaking his heart all over again.  “If you please,” Harry commanded, with a wave of his hand.  “As I was saying, the person who was the source of my newfound happiness decided that, when faced with someone who didn’t approve of my choices, he’d simply make the decision for me?  Does that accurately summarize your story?”
“Indeed.” Severus narrowed his eyes, and heaved an enormous sigh.  “Harry Potter, you listen to me now, because I will be unlikely to repeat myself.  The child that sleeps upstairs is a remarkably well-adjusted and happy little girl.  Her childhood has been as joyful as yours wasn’t.  She is safe, and healthy, and intelligent, and, most shockingly, likeable.  You’re an excellent father, Harry.  You are not failing her.”
Scorpius was silent for a long moment.  It looked as though he were trying to summon up the courage to say something.  Harry waited patiently, even though his stomach was roiling.  “Please, please don’t take me away from my Papa!”
“Three days,” Draco says, and his voice is a broken thing, as rough as shards of crystal.  “They left a note, telling me not to tell anyone, and said they’d be in touch, but there’s been nothing.”
“Of course,” Harry agreed hurriedly.  “You don’t owe me anything.”  For some reason that caused Draco to give him a look somewhere between pained and exasperated.
“You’re magical, Violet,” he said solemnly.  “A witch, actually.  I know that this sounds unbelievable, but magic is real, and there are others who are just like you.”
“Serve the Ministry in what capacity?”
“That’s my fault,” Papa said, in a broken, strange voice, after the silence stretched between them.  “Not your Dad’s.”
He awoke some time later laying on the hearth.  The thready light of dawn was beginning to break through the horizon, casting a dusky rose to the room.  He looked around to see that Hermione and Ron were bound to a set of dining room chairs, but Ron was awakening as well.  “Where’s Harry?” Ron whispered, the moment he opened his eyes.
“Why were your trousers so long?”
“I’d regret a life without you more.  Harry, will you have me?”
Ron looked momentarily surprised, and then said, “Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  I suppose it didn’t occur to me that you’d have an idea of what it’s like.”
For a split second, Draco thought that his mother would continue her path to the floo, to escape another confrontation.  Then, she turned, and Draco could see a hesitant, hopeful smile on her lips.  “He’s really quite a beautiful baby,” she remarked.  “Mister Potter is a handsome man, but I somehow never pictured just how lovely his features would be in miniature.”
“We didn’t make any promises to one another.”
“Astoria, please.  It’s nice to meet you as well.”
Draco kept the conversation light, and far away from all of the things he really wanted to know.
When everyone had regained their composure, Harry made sure they all had a seat, and some tea, and said, “I know you likely have a lot of questions for me, and I’ll answer them all, but there’s someone I want you to meet.”
“But Dad…”
“Distraction.  Can we talk about you?”
“I’m ready.  You?”  She nodded, but didn’t meet his eyes.  “You good, Cass?”
Still.  Draco knew that he was one of the few consultants that was allowed to work exclusively from his home, and he’d been working so hard, since the war to be the bigger person, to offset what he and his family had done, he swallowed any sarcasm, and simply said, “Thank you.”  His hands were on the arm of the chair.  Tap, tap, tap.
Harry cringed at the sound of his name, but he obediently swung his eyes in Hermione’s direction before immediately looking back at Draco.
“Well,” Cass said cheerfully, “this looks like it’s going to be fun.”
I know I need to decide what to do next.  Why would I want to stay in the Magical world, a place where I’m feared and watched with suspicion?  Where my best friend makes poorly researched decisions that affect my future without giving me any input on them?  There are things that I like about the magical world, and there’s nothing like the heady buzz I feel when the magic runs down my arm and through my wand.  But the people here seem to see me as nothing more than a tool, a symbol.  I wonder if the old me enjoyed the fame and attention of being the Boy who Lived.  The cabin in the woods is starting to look more and more like my only option.
“Yes.  I apologize.  I know that I’ve robbed you of knowing her, and I’m sorry for that.”
“I don’t know,” he says, his voice hollow.
“What time is it?”  Draco casts Tempus.  “Fuck.  I have to go.”
“It was a mistake.  I was just leaving.” Draco knew he sounded like a prat, but all he wanted was to get out of this place and drink so much that he forgot that this night had ever happened.  And hex Pansy until that bitch cried.
I know.”  And she did.  Tamsin was the only person who Harry had ever told about his childhood.  After Daniel, they’d gone to Tamsin’s flat and gotten sickeningly drunk, and Harry had told her everything.  He stood and went around the desk until he was standing next to her, and then wrapped his arms around her, squeezing her tightly.  “We can’t save everyone, but we save everyone we can, yeah?”
“Two rules then.  Get fucked up, and act like a fucking family.  Am I understood?”  Pansy’s voice got very quiet on the last sentence, and Draco nearly wet his pants.  He nodded.  Ron nodded as well.  Seamus grinned gleefully and topped up everyone’s drinks.
“I need you to.”
He’s wrong, of course.  Luna meets his eyes, her head high.  This isn’t going to be an apology, then.  “Luna,” he says evenly.  “You’re looking well.”
“Thank you,” Draco said, seeming surprised to be saying it.  “I’ve been worrying about this for a while, and I’m relieved to have some help.”
“Mill told me.  She said your mates from Slytherin who weren’t marked, but had Death Eater parents were all put on probation, but it’s indefinite, and the probation officers seem to have a grudge.”
“Oh Harry,” she says, “he’s died.”
“That’s the thing,” he says with a shrug.  “My Father, no doubt, would have vowed revenge on Bright's entire family, and, the Ministry, and achieved it, no doubt, through underhanded means.  That’s not how I want to live my life, and I don’t want to set that sort of example for Scorpius.  It’s just….Bright will be locked away for the rest of his life, and there’s no sort of punishment that would restore what Scorpius has lost.  I’m grateful that he’s alive, even if I feel guilty that he suffered, simply because of his last name.”
“But I wanted to introduce you to my family.  You must have realized that it would have gotten awkward if we showed up at the Weasleys while I was betrothed to Gin.”
“Not especially,” Draco said.  “I’m fine on my own.”
“Yes of course,” Draco said, and then immediately wanted to obliviate Harry, and himself.  Why had he been so stupid?  Of course when Harry got older he’d remember that they weren’t friends. He was such an idiot.
“And Polyjuice is the-”
“Master Malfoy, it is an honour to serve the true heir of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black,” Kreacher replied, bowing low.
Then, he remembered that Draco didn’t want him, and he drew away, his cheeks flushed and his fingers on his lips as if to hold the feeling of Draco’s there.  “I…I,” he stammered.  “I’m sorry.  I can’t-”
“No,” he said, marvelling that his voice remained even.  “No, I don’t think so, not right now.  I’ll see you.”
“Very well, Mother.  Arrange a meeting with the Greengrasses for next week.”
“I’m not sure.” Harry was staring at his mouth.  His eyes flitted up to meet Draco’s before returning to their original target.  Curious, Draco let his tongue flit out and wet his lower lip.  Harry’s eyes widened, his pupils dilating. He stifled a groan.  Emboldened, Draco captured his lower lip in his teeth and widened his own eyes.
Draco opens his mouth to speak, but Harry raises a hand, his expression determined.  He continues, “It made me realize that what I’ve been doing is all wrong.  I have to figure out whether I can build a life for myself or not.  I can’t keep trying to define myself in relation to other people.”
Harry looked confused.  “I’ve never taken a sleeping draught.  I had some dreamless sleep during school, but never anything like this.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t understand at first.  Thank you for telling me.”
Draco looked at Harry, who had dropped all pretence of normalcy and looked as though he were about to walk to his death.  Again.  His face was white and he was bouncing on his toes once more.  His hands were tightly clenched, and he didn’t appear to be breathing at all.
Everyone turns to look at me then, with varying expressions of gobsmackedness, which I wasn’t expecting, because for me, it’s perfectly reasonable to prioritize.  Even though Ron vindicates me slightly by muttering, “Fucking Wendell.”
I’m satisfied by the resolution, but I look to Draco.  “Is that enough?” I ask.
Draco kissed his Mother’s cheeks, and sat to pour a cup of tea.  “Do you think she’ll be alright, with Lucius?”
“Okay, thank you for telling me that.  I’m sorry to be so blunt, Draco, I know that this is none of my business, but I want to help.”
Harry blinked a few times and gave him a look that Draco vaguely remembered from his old life.  Harry reddened, straightened, and said “Sorry.  I’m fine.  Just got distracted for a second.”
Cass frowned.  “What do you mean?”
He flushed.  “I just didn’t want to presume.”
“Yeah, I don’t seem to learn, do I?  Headline’s funny though.”
“It’s complete shite is what it is,” she says angrily.
“Listen, if this is about your sister, I told you, I’m really sorry, but I just can’t be with her.  I’m sure that Jenny is a-”
, Draco.”
“So are they gone?  Forever?”
When Dean Thomas entered the room, Harry’s breath caught.  He hadn’t expected to see his old dorm mate, and he hoped that he could count on him not to share this with the media.  Dean’s warm brown eyes widened when he spotted Harry.  “Harry!  Long time no see, mate.  How have you been?”
“I did.  Asses were kicked.”
The house elf popped into existence at Draco’s bedside.  “Good morning, Master Malfoy.  Good morning, Small Master Harry Potter.  Would Master Malfoy be wanting tea?”
Harry replied, “I think I can sort of understand that.  There was this kid, an older kid, where Dudley and I went to school. Dudley’s a bit of a bully, and he kind of scares and bosses everyone, but then this kid decided that
“But here we are, four years later, and I’m still a mess, and you’re…well, you seem to be doing just fine, actually, which kind of hurts a bit, but I had to take my shot, Draco.  I know you have this life here, but I need my shot.”
Draco’s grey eyes were wide and he was staring at Harry in horror.  “Potter,” he said, his voice choked, “I never knew.”
“Hannah has to work.  Look, let’s just take you home, and you can sleep it off.  We’ll sort you out in the morning.”
“Take me however you’d like,” I purr, and his face becomes stony.
“I don’t hate you either.”  His face looks very young, suddenly.  “And what happens after I break the curse?  When you remember that you hate me, and remember all of the things I did?”
“Call me Harry,” Harry said, and followed her inside to do just that.
“Maybe we just need to pick a more sympathetic journalist?” Draco asks finally.  “If Lovegood wrote the article and sold it as a special feature to the Prophet, we’d have more control over the tone.”
“If I do, I’ll come back a real person.  If I don’t, it’s because there’s nothing left of me.  I have to know.  Do you understand that?”
“I’m not sure.  The woman who runs the Department is tough, but fair.  Maybe if you made an appointment to speak with her, she’d give you an exemption.  I’ll floo you tonight to let you know if Scorpius is eligible for inclusion in the trial.”
He considered this, and then nodded, and said, “Mama, I just don’t feel green today.  Today is a blue day.”
“Is it?  He explained how house elf magic works, and how their magic increases by being bonded to a home, and its wizards.  I offered to free him, and he cried.  Just seems like he deserves a bit of agency to decide for himself.”
