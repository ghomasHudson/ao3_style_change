Draco had to admit, as he wandered through the ground floor of the house, that the party had come together spectacularly. The festoons of fir boughs and holly, the twinkling lights, the warm glow of candles, and sounds of quiet holiday music wafting through the air between the laughter and chatter of dozens of cheerful guests—it looked, sounded, and smelled like the pinnacle of Christmas cheer.
He repeated himself, barely more than a whisper. “It doesn’t happen when you’re here.” He turned just enough to glance at Draco from under his eyelashes and immediately wished he hadn’t. Draco’s brow was furrowed with hurt and confusion.
“Not really.” She raised an eyebrow, and he sighed again. Was expressive eyebrows a Black family trait? He wondered. He and his mother had been known to have conversations entirely in eyebrow gesture; it had driven his father mad. “
“Since we’re talking behind the scenes,” Sadiyah said, changing the subject, “what about that whole Jack thing?”
They talked on and off, their conversation meandering as they watched the stars emerge. They talked about Sullivan’s huge, dopey dog, Scout, whom he obviously adored. Harry shared a few stories about helping Hagrid out with his menagerie of bizarre magical creatures. They’d been discussing Sullivan’s love of adventure and trying new extreme sports when they stumbled directly into the war.
“Hey.” Another smile. Fuck, but he looked good. “Sorry again. Anyway, I was just dropping this one off—I have to get to work—but I’m sure I’ll see you soon, yeah?”
The girl’s face began to crumple, and Harry rushed over, crouching down to her height. “Hey, Sara, hey. It’s a lovely painting.” It was a large sheet of newsprint covered in bright blotches of tempera paint that could only vaguely be read as an animal of any sort, but that was beside the point. Honestly, it wasn’t any worse than Leela’s attempted portrait of Harry. “Why don’t you tell me about it?”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, and Harry looked up at him, surprised. “It probably wasn’t the best of date ideas.”
“I said—” And then Draco’s eyes went as wide as Harry’s as his mind caught up with his mouth. He looked suddenly panicked. “Fuck. I didn’t mean—”
“Whatever. Today’s date is with Jack, and you’ll be doing a tour of the Ogden’s distillery. Have fun, don’t get too drunk, and try to learn something about them for fuck’s sake.”
Harry sighed again, not making eye contact. “It was— well. Remember in fifth year, when you started running your mouth about my parents and the Weasleys after the Slytherin/Gryffindor game? And I sort of lost it, and Umbridge kicked me off the team?”
Depositing his finds on the table, Harry allowed himself to observe for a few moments. People were working singularly or in pairs, but no one was being overtly competitive, which Harry appreciated. Owen had Rose balanced on his shoulders trying to reach something she’d apparently spotted on a high shelf, while Dermot was examining a stack of sheet music with interest, and Gabrielle was studying the seemingly empty drawer of a desk nearby. Voices and the sounds of things moving came from further into the room, but Harry couldn’t see everyone in the chaos.
“And how was everybody else keeping?” Narcissa queried, pointedly not asking directly what other gossip he might have to share but obviously angling for whatever juicy details he might be willing to divulge.
On Thursday, Narcissa manipulated Draco into going to Diagon Alley with her, sighing about how his visit was more than halfway over and she’d
“Your playing has gone downhill since school, Potter,” he taunted ineffectually. “It’s a good thing you can coast by on your name, or you’d have been unemployed ages ago.”
A lot of things about my life have sucked. Being an orphan. Living in a cupboard. Having the fate of the world dropped on my shoulders when I was eleven. Being ostracized for telling the truth. Living in a tent with no proper food for most of a year. Dying. Coming back.
“Can we do it again?!” Teddy’s enthusiastic request came from mere feet away, and Harry rolled off of Draco impressively quickly, pulling himself up and brushing the snow off of himself as though nothing had happened. Draco followed suit, studiously not looking at him. Fucking hell. He took a deep breath and tried to be grateful that they’d been interrupted.
Blaise took a small bite, swallowed, and then seemed to consider. “It does have a bit of an aftertaste, now that you mention it. Sort of like—”
Draco huffed out a sad laugh. “Right. Just two things. Unfortunately, those two things are proving to be rather impossible.”
When he woke the second time, the bed was empty, but the room was warmer. He sat up and stretched, yawning, before begrudgingly getting up, stealing an ugly but cozy bathrobe from Harry’s wardrobe, and padding out into the hall. The smells of coffee and something cinnamony wafted from the kitchen, and he followed them, smiling as he caught sight of Harry—still in his pajamas but now with an added hoodie—at the stovetop, dropping something into a skillet. “Look at you being all domestic,” he teased.
Turning, Draco rested his elbows against his chair’s arms and clasped his hands in front of himself, observing Potter for a few long moments, hoping to make him sweat a bit. “Alright, then. Drinks tomorrow? There’s a Muggle wine bar nearby that I’m rather fond of.”
“I think I’ll go back into the woods for a bit; if I can’t find a Wampus cat, I may at least be able to see some of the other local wildlife.”
“Yes, but I suspect it was more so that they couldn’t hear me telling them to hurry up than so that we didn’t have to hear whatever they’re up to.”
“I didn’t need to be; half the school was present to share the gossip later on. And of course I remember; I
I can, actually, a little bit. But, forced heroism aside, I don’t think I’d want to change anything.
Harry straightened, although he didn’t move back. “You sure?” he asked reflexively, before cursing himself inwardly.
“Don’t be stupid, of course I’m coming.” Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re not stealing all of my friends and leaving me in London for a whole week.”
Within a few blocks, Harry found himself cursing his own impulsivity. The Muggle streets were crowded, and his route was more an obstacle course than a straight shot. He should have just Apparated, but it was too late now; he couldn’t see anywhere discreet enough to leave from, and he didn’t want to take the time to stop and look. It wasn’t that far. He just needed to get there. Blocking everything else from his mind, he continued dodging pedestrians and vehicles as he dashed toward Draco.
to refuse him. Potter, who had snubbed him when they were eleven — a slight which he had thought himself long over, until now. Potter, with his stupid muscles and his stupid sex hair and his stupid, challenging, not-at-all-lust-inducing smirk. Stupid Potter, making him feel less than worthy. Draco glared up at nothing, angry at himself for caring. Oh, he’d risk the publicity for
Harry responded enthusiastically, bracing his hands against the counter, but broke the kiss much more quickly than Draco would have liked. “Dinner,” he reminded Draco.
“Erm, that I talk about Draco all the time and make him keep me company on off days and that the crew all talk about how I’ve basically been broadcasting the huge embarrassing crush I have on him to the whole world and everyone knew it but me? More or less.” Harry’s face felt hot. This was much more humiliating to admit out loud now that he knew that it was true.
And, yes, he still wanted to kiss him, rather a lot if he was honest, but it was fine. He could do this.
“Hey. Harry. Hey.” A warm hand rubbed circles on his back; Draco stood next to him, his Disillusionment charm seeping away, revealing him piece by piece as though he was being painted onto the air itself. “Shh, it’s okay. Breathe.”
Draco had kissed a lot of people in his life. He was quite good at it, if he did say so himself. He enjoyed it as much as the next person, certainly. But Draco had never been kissed like
While Ginny bickered with him, Hermione rolled her eyes and passed Ron one of the other bottles under her arm, which he swiftly opened and poured, taking glasses for himself and Hermione before handing one to Ginny and clinking his own against it. “Cheers.”
“I really need to read reviews before I choose movies,” Harry sighed as they exited the theater later.
Harry shrugged and bit one soft earlobe, just above the silver stud that adorned it, before kissing the corner of Draco’s sharp jaw. “Wasn’t listening.” The sound that Draco made in response wasn’t quite a word, but his hands had begun to slide purposefully up Harry’s back, taking his shirt with them, and Harry thought that was answer enough.
“Well, I’m very happy for you. And speaking of happy news—Hilde, a little owl told me that you’ve had a rather exciting romantic development recently.”
“Harry. Looking good, as always,” Blaise said, giving Harry a very blatant once over. “And how is Ginevra?”
“Did you not know that?” she asked, sounding surprised. “I thought it was common knowledge. They were photographed out together several times.”
“If it isn’t the prodigal son!” George exclaimed, turning his attention to Draco. “Harry said you were back in town. Still as friendly and charming as ever, I see.”
“Hmm.” Draco looked back and forth a few times before sighing. “We’re probably two-thirds of the way to the beach.”
Holding eye contact, Draco nodded slowly. Harry let out a gasping little laugh, and, grabbing Draco’s face with both hands, he pulled him down and kissed him fiercely.
Harry gave an embarrassed laugh. “I’m really not, I just wasn’t paying attention to where I was going. You okay?”
Draco wandered down the main thoroughfare, peering in the window of Gladrags to see the newest robe styles (many hardly distinguishable from Muggle attire these days) and Spintwitches to assess the newest racing brooms (which he didn’t think looked that much better than the old Firebolts, but what did he know?). He had just made the decision to dip into Tomes and Scrolls when a solid form knocked into his shoulder, almost pushing him to the ground. He only managed to stay upright by grabbing onto the window frame of the shop.
Harry must have picked up on his tone, but apparently mistook the reason, because he hastened to add, “I totally get that you aren’t interested in starting anything, like, romantic, but I’d still like to spend some time with you while you’re here, if you’re up for it. Just, grab drinks or something.”
“Quite. An improvement, in my opinion. I find I have less of a taste for the grotesquely opulent these days. Would you like some tea?”
“Well then, excellent job.” Harry grinned at her, and she broke, laughing and covering her face in her hands.
It was nearing six o’clock, and Draco was once again slogging through a pile of work correspondence. He was just realizing despondently that he was going to need to make a stop into the London offices to deal with a few things for a couple of particularly needy clients when the Floo chimed. He heard his mother murmuring in the living room before she raised her voice and called out, “It’s Harry for you, darling.”
“Be safe!” Hermione called over her shoulder, earning a laugh and a ‘go on’ gesture from Ron. “What should we do this evening, do you think?” Behind them, they could hear Greg insisting that Ron use a flotation charm before getting into the boat.
“Not yet. But it’s still early.” Draco’s expression turned serious. “Speaking of, good job on booting Romilda. I’ve already chewed Pansy out for allowing her on the show, so you needn’t repeat the effort if you don’t want to.”
There was a strange clicking noise, and suddenly, all of the overhead sprinklers came on at once, soaking the entire room and everyone in it.
gave him any creative control over the ads themselves. He checked the order form and grimaced. Second page. Lovely.
Harry smiled wryly up at Draco. “Side-along’s probably going to startle the hell out of him, but I don’t particularly fancy walking half a mile carrying four stone of dead weight.”
“You can bring it with you,” Teddy told him grudgingly, and Draco rolled his eyes before heading to the kitchen.
They sat there next to each other in a discomfited sort of impasse before Harry—realizing that the extreme awkwardness had finally convinced his erection that this was
Draco gave a weak laugh. His legs were still shaking, and he felt slightly lightheaded. “I hope you were planning on letting me spend the night, because the odds of my being able to move anytime soon are not at all promising.”
“I’d like it if he did,” Harry said, glancing at Draco before grinning down at Teddy, “but I don’t mind if he wants to call me ‘Potter.’ I’m more concerned with you calling us
“Well, you do have a bit of a history of… unorthodox use of travel and communication devices,” Hermione defended.
Eventually, everyone was full of maple syrup and caffeine and began to discuss what to do with the day. They all seemed content with keeping things low key for now. “It’s going to clear up later, so perhaps we can have a bonfire tonight,” Luna told them, and no one questioned it. She was probably right; she usually was.
“Half hour,” Greg answered without looking up. “I lit the fire in the oven before I started this, so we should be ready to start in like… 40 minutes?”
In the parlour, Draco encountered Mrs. Nott and Xenophilius Lovegood, arm in arm, along with Theo and Luna, who both seemed completely unfazed by the situation. Luna was gesturing enthusiastically while explaining something or other to Theo, who looked completely enraptured by whatever it was. Draco waved to them before wandering on. He steered clear of Augusta Longbottom, who was currently talking to his mother—the woman had, frankly, always made him incredibly nervous. Nearby, he saw an incredibly uncomfortable looking Neville Longbottom being aggressively flirted with by Cassandra Zabini. He was about to go try to redirect her attentions when he saw Blaise headed their way and sighed in relief. He had been on the other end of Cassie’s advances, and it could be quite overwhelming, especially when one was not inclined toward the female—or any, he supposed, in Neville’s case—gender.
They perused the menu in silence for a few minutes. Despite the exclusivity of the restaurant, the food wasn’t pretentious; Harry had mentioned that he had a wide palate but no patience for the tiny portions and often-bizarre dishes featured at many high-end establishments, so Draco had made sure to take his preferences into account when selecting their venue. His efforts proved worthwhile as he observed the pleased look on Harry’s face. Once they’d made their selections, Draco poured them each a glass of wine before settling back in his chair, contemplating the man seated across from him.
“Harry comes for dinner every Tuesday,” Narcissa confirmed. “We take it as an excuse to put in a bit more effort.”
“Alright then!” Pansy interrupted. “We’ve tried our best—” Draco raised a pointed eyebrow at Pansy, and she rolled her eyes. “
“As well as you’d expect, given the date. I’m glad to run into you, though; I’d hoped we could talk while you were in. Do you have a moment?”
“I don’t have a present for Harry.” It hadn’t even occurred to him until Teddy said it, and immediately, panic began to set in.
Everyone began talking at once, but before the sound could get too cacophonous, Sadiyah clapped her elegant hands together loudly three times. “Alright everyone! Let’s make a plan, shall we? We won’t pull this off if we all scatter in separate directions.”
“Yeah, pretty much. But maybe he just thought that serenading me would make him stand out; who knows? So I’m trying to reserve judgement.”
Pansy, of course, took that as an invitation to open the door herself. She gave him a quick appraisal and nodded. “It’s perfect. Let’s go.”
“Come on, pleeeeeease?” Teddy hung on Harry’s arm, eyes pleading, but this time Harry didn’t give in, although he was still smiling.
Draco squeezed Harry’s arm comfortingly. Harry leaned back into him, still feeling a twinge of guilt.
“Yeah.” Harry pulled back. “And I think I’d like to be friends, too. I’ve really enjoyed spending time with you.”
Harry shrugs, looking down at their entwined hands and playing with Draco’s long fingers, oddly free of soot. “Dunno. For Sirius, I guess. Not the ‘asking you to live here’, that was more… I wanted—
Hermione looked up from where she was curled up on one of the squashy sofas, a field guide of some sort open in front of her. “Still thinking of picking something up?”
Deciding that it was unlikely that she was going to make it up the stairs to him, Harry addressed her from where he stood. “I’m sorry, but I’m just not ready for the level of… erm…
Just then, the door to the flat slammed, making him curse under his breath in panic. He’d thought he’d have more time before Draco got back from his date; he usually didn’t come home until dawn. There was no way Harry was going to get himself healed before Draco made it this far, and Harry, like the idiot he was, hadn’t even closed the bathroom door. He contemplated spelling it shut now, but he was still tipsy enough that he wasn’t sure he could control the force of the spell. He didn’t think that accidentally knocking the door off its hinges would be particularly helpful to his current predicament.
, he thought, and catching his mother’s eye, he knew that she was thinking the same. There was a bittersweet ache in his heart that he was only finding this now, when his life was firmly settled thousands of miles away.
“God forbid.” Shaking his head, Harry headed up to finally answer the siren’s call of his wide, inviting bed.
“I just wanted to say, Harry,” she murmured, tone suddenly low and seductive rather than light and teasing, “that I’m so, so happy to have this second chance with you.”
Draco had decanted one of the bottles of red while Hermione worked, and was now waving Ginny away as she attempted to pour herself a glass. “It needs at least ten more minutes, you heathen,” he berated her. “Hasn’t Pansy taught you
“So,” Perry said as the last plates popped out of existence, leaving them with only their wine and each other’s company. “We might as well address the elephant in the room.” He looked upward as though gathering his courage, took a deep breath, let it out. “I know I’m the only one left,” he finally said, looking back down to meet Harry’s eyes, “so I feel like I need to say this.”
There were also a handful of well-known faces that Harry welcomed with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Romilda Vane seemed normal enough when she greeted him, other than perhaps looking a bit starry-eyed, but Harry couldn’t help but think back to her disturbing attempt to drug him with love potion back in his sixth year. Cormac McClaggan’s arrival was a less than pleasant surprise, but he didn’t initially seem as arrogant as he had been when he’d briefly played for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, so it was at least possible he’d grown out of the obnoxiousness of his school days. Harry was a bit ashamed to admit to himself that although he hoped that he had, it was primarily because Cormac had grown up to be extremely attractive. The biggest surprise, in truth, was Gabrielle Delacour.
When he walked into the room that served as the camp’s main space, Harry was immediately mobbed by small children. “Mister Harry, Mister Harry! You’re back!”
Draco swerved around a Bludger, nearly flying straight into Tybalt as he aimed to knock it back the other way. “Fuck’s sake, Malfoy!” he heard his teammate call as he whipped away, scanning the field for any sign of the Snitch.
Draco gave him a fond little smile that made Harry’s heart skip a beat or two. “Thank you. Now go away.” Placing a hand on Harry’s chest, he shoved him lightly, forcing him across the threshold before shutting the door in his face.
As Draco had been the one to suggest dinner, he’d taken it upon himself to make the arrangements. He’d ventured into the nearest Muggle town to use the computers in the library (and Merlin, how he missed the internet! He’d been happy to turn off his cell phone for a while, but the lack of easy access to information was beginning to get to him) and done a bit of research before settling on a well-reviewed Ethiopian restaurant in London.
Taking care to keep his expression light, Draco pondered for a moment before saying. “I think McCutcheon is a Puddlemere fan. Maybe try him?”
Hilde laughed. “Well, better late than never, right? I’m glad to get a chance to know you now, anyway.”
Writing Narcissa and Draco interacting with each other is such a joy. I cut out like 200 words of unnecessary description of the dining room from this when rereading because I realized that their conversation was much more interesting than talking about where the dishes in their china cabinet came from. Anyway, Happy Hanukkah to those of you who celebrate!
Harry groaned as he got to his feet before reaching down to help pull Draco up, pulling him back through the door. Once they were inside and facing each other, however, Harry found himself unsure how to proceed. Things had been heating up a bit while they were outside, yes, but that didn’t necessarily mean that Draco wanted things to go any further right now. This was all so new. He floundered a bit, awkward and uncertain. “Should we… I mean, I don’t want to rush anything if you—”
Draco’s hands hadn’t left Harry’s face, and they easily guided him back, holding him still until he met Draco’s gaze. “Of course I mean it,” he said, voice shaky but firm.
Teddy, who had been ignoring the proceedings—losing interest after he’d watched his own gifts be opened—looked up at his name and jumped up from the floor. “Let me see!” He pulled at Harry’s wrists to lower them. “I remember this! I didn’t see you buy it.” He gave Draco a mildly accusing look, and Draco grinned at him.
Harry thought, as they sat in the theater, that it was probably a good thing that he wasn’t much of a gambler. Before they were even fifteen minutes in, he was embarrassedly wiping away the tears streaming uncontrollably down his face, ducking his head in an effort to hide them from Draco. He was about to give it up for a lost cause when he heard a loud sniff from his left. Looking over, he saw that Draco’s face was blotchy in the flickering light of the screen and his cheeks were just as wet as Harry’s.
is to date me. That might be a new low.” Draco gave him a sympathetic grimace, but Harry waved him off. “Don’t worry, I’m only half serious. Although it doesn’t feel like the
“What?” Harry asked. He felt as though he’d come in at the middle of a conversation. “What are you even talking about?”
Harry laughed, and Draco realized with embarrassment that he must have said that out loud. He shrugged internally. “Well, it’s only fair,” he insisted.
“Nope. Out,” Harry directed as Ginny began to drag her luggage inside, apparently hoping he wouldn’t notice.
“It’s fine,” he said, shoving his hands into his pockets. “It was my fault. I shouldn’t have assumed that you would want—” He trailed off with a small shrug. “I’m not always… the best, at reading people.”
couldn’t remember what he and Harry had talked about at the end of the night, and he would rather not have a repeat performance at this point. They exited the bar and stood close together on the sidewalk, their breath visible in the cold winter air. The chill made Draco shudder, but he couldn’t bring himself to say goodnight or move away.
Teddy wanted to go to Diagon Alley for his Christmas shopping, and so Draco found himself back for the second time in four days. Shopping with Teddy was, however, an entirely different experience than shopping with his mother.
Draco exhaled. Damn her perceptiveness. “I’m enjoying getting to know him,” he conceded, fiddling with his fork, “but it’s nothing more than that.”
“I wasn’t! I was… oh.” He looked a bit embarrassed, and Narcissa’s eyes twinkled in a way that Draco thought could almost be called mischievous. “Right. Er, Malfoy, would you mind if I called you Draco?”
“Not much,” Harry managed to choke out before shoving Draco away, encouraging him to move further up the bed.
“Well that’s reassuring.” Draco huffed and then dithered in his chair for a moment before deciding that he would rather deal with annoyed tipsy Pansy at a pub than irate tipsy Pansy in his mother’s living room. Resignedly, he pulled on his coat and Apparated to Three Broomsticks.
When Draco found Harry later, he was lying on his back on the balcony of his room—knees bent, hands folded on his stomach, looking at the stars. He wasn’t sure how long he’d been out here, but he supposed it must have been awhile if Draco had come looking.
“I mean assumed we were at least on our way there; I literally invited you out, what, three separate times? Do you really think I would have asked after the first time if I didn’t want to?”
As summer slid into autumn, the days grew shorter and the Quidditch season began in earnest, making it harder and harder to steal time together. They attended each other’s matches when they could, but they had to be careful not to give away any motives beyond sussing out the competition. Outside of work, they both had to contend with the demands of their respective families.
“It’s hard to say. It would probably be easier to tell you what I’m actively looking for instead of what I’m not.”
“I’ve written up a template invitation and split the guest list in two; you may start with this half,” Narcissa replied with the air of someone bestowing a great favor.
“Thanks.” Harry reached up and squeezed the hand still resting against his arm. Perry opened his mouth to say something else, but their little bubble abruptly burst as the show concluded and the lights around them came back on. Shutting his mouth, Perry gave him a small smile and moved away, letting Harry reintegrate into the group.
Ginny was grinning in a way that let Harry know that they were not going to hear the end of this for a long, long time. “Oh, at least once a day.”
Harry’s next arrest came after a particularly brutal double homicide. It was all anyone was talking about when he arrived that morning, but, despite Draco’s expectations (and perhaps anticipation), Harry didn’t appear at his desk to brag about it. He was feeling a bit anxious by the time he finally saw him passing by his door in the late afternoon, and the feeling only grew when he did. Harry had bags under his eyes, and his usually confident posture was slumped. He didn’t look as though he had slept. He also didn’t look like he was going to stop.
Draco stood and watched it, and, as Teddy had directed, remembered. The freedom of flying down the slopes. Harry’s carefree laughter carrying on the wind. That almost-kiss. “It’s lovely,” he told Teddy.
When he’d finally calmed down, Draco sighed, but didn’t let go immediately. “I’m sorry,” he said. “This was a bad idea. I didn’t quite realize when I booked this place how much it would look like…” He trailed off, and Harry could have sworn he felt a slight shudder go through him. “But even so, I should have thought about how—”
“Alright there, Harry?” came a voice from his right, and Harry felt a rush of relief that the choice of whom to approach first had been taken from him. He turned to find Nathalie looking up at him and smiled.
“Come on, Harry, it will be great. A house full of attractive wix vying for your heart! What’s not to love?”
“For fuck’s sake, stop it,” Pansy chastized, but she was grinning. “Go harass someone else if you can’t behave.”
Harry’s hands clenched on his broom, and he could feel his temper—usually so in control these days—flaring to life like he was fifteen again.
“Okay...” Draco answered, feeling suddenly wrongfooted. Shit. Had Harry noticed Draco watching him and changed his mind? Did he not want to be friends after all?
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. Obviously they were fit as fuck—” Draco snorted and Harry pressed on “—but other than that, I didn’t really get to know enough about them to like them. I mean, I’m not even sure Jack was their real name! I was thinking back to when everyone arrived, and what they actually said was ‘you can
They ate and watched, making comments to each other as it went along. “Oh my god, what the hell, he looks
“Well, who else would it have been?” Pansy asked, raising an eyebrow at him. Ginny buried her head in her girlfriend’s neck, snorting.
It’s over before I can fully register that it’s happening; he flops back onto his back and says “sorry,” but it’s a sorry like when you bump into someone in the kitchen, not a sorry like ‘I’m mortified that I just did that.’ I tell him it’s fine, casually, like my brain isn’t trying to process seven thousand thoughts at once, and we go back to listening to ‘Tonight, Tonight.’ I can’t tell if the ache in my chest is from the strings or from the kiss.
“I will mock you for many, many things, Draco, but I promise that having feelings will never be one of them.” Harry smiled, leaning up and kissing him softly. “Besides,” he said matter-of-factly as he turned back to the screen, “that song is
“Oh, okay, I know this! This is one of those logic puzzles. So if blue can’t be next to green, and green has to be next to red—”
“Draco.” Softer, this time. And then, surprising him, “Are you happy in New York, on your own? Truly?”
“Don’t speak of yourself in the third person, dear; it makes you sound grandiloquent,” Narcissa interjected calmly, not bothering to look up from her plate.
“What?!” Harry’s mind managed a bizarre double-tracking, one half completely taken aback, the other flashing back to Draco’s earlier teasing.
“Aye aye, captain.” Harry gave a little salute, and Draco snorted. Pansy narrowed her eyes at him, then sighed.
Perry’s arms came up around Harry, and he let out a breath, holding him for just a few moments longer before releasing him and summoning the half-empty wine bottle. “You’re welcome.”
“Mother, the jam star biscuits use the sugar dough, yes?” Draco asked as he finished rolling the dough into a perfectly even sheet.
“I’ve heard you’re doing quite well for yourself, my boy, quite well indeed,” Slughorn enthused. “Kashburn and Costleigh, isn’t it?”
I’ve started bringing Malfoy along when I go out with my friends, unless it’s something one on one, or just me, Ron, and Hermione. He did try coming out with us a couple times, but the vibe was a little weird—the three of us have this sort of shared vocabulary from spending an epic fuck-ton of time together over the past eight years, often in life-or-death situations, and it’s hard to incorporate a new person into something like that.
Draco felt himself flush and spared half a moment to wonder if the color was anything like that of his aura before returning to the matter at hand. ‘In love’ was a little bit of an overstatement, surely—but it hit close enough to home to be unnerving. Despite the emotions roiling through him, Draco couldn’t help but ask: “Why not?”
like this was how mornings were supposed to be—cozy and companionable, with shared breakfasts and banter with someone he—
Returning downstairs, Harry found most of his friends wandering around, exploring the rest of the house. He poked his head into each of the twin bedrooms, which he was relieved to note were quite nice. Although Luna and Greg were easy to please, he was fairly sure that, had they not been up to snuff, he never would have heard the end of it from Draco or Blaise.
Once their food was gone, Harry curled into Draco’s side and Draco wrapped an arm around him, enjoying the closeness and warmth. They laughed at some of the plot lines and booed at others. “I hate this scene,” Harry complained as a man declared his love to his best friend’s wife. “Who even does that?”
It's past midnight in my time zone (EST), so it's technically Christmas! Consider the early posting my gift to you (and definitely not just my getting the chapter up early so that I don't feel bad about sleeping in).
but he couldn’t seem to get the words out. Every time he got close, a little voice in the back of his head told him, again,
“Yes, and yes,” Malfoy answered. He gave Harry a blatant once-over and bit his lip. Before he could say anything else, however, Ron had grabbed Harry by the elbow and begun dragging him away. Harry looked back over his shoulder at Malfoy and gave him a helpless little shrug and a wave before turning to his friend.
Hermione shook her head at him. “Honestly, Harry. Ronald told me about you two flirting at the gala. And then you had that string of letters all from the same owl, and then you suddenly started disappearing several evenings a week with no explanation and no hint of who you were with. Also, you went to all of the Wasps games. It was pretty obvious.”
“So. Housing swap not such a bad idea after all?” he teased, playing with the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck.
He tried to tell himself it wasn’t hiding, but even he wasn’t convinced by the lie. He’d heard the floo signaling Harry and Teddy’s imminent arrival and had promptly fled upstairs and locked himself in his room. Even through the closed door, however, he could faintly hear the conversation taking place between Harry and Andromeda downstairs. Not that he was listening.
“To all of us. And even if you didn’t, I told you that the crew gossips. They see how much time you spend with him. Hell,
“Me too,” Harry agreed. He hadn’t used his fancy shower yet, but he’d read the instructions in the house manual and was keen to try it out.
Harry gave him a thankful look and Hermione’s expression softened. Still, “We would have figured something else out,” she told him seriously.
Harry glanced down at himself and shrugged. The dark charcoal suit fitted him well enough, he supposed, but he felt confined and a bit itchy. Though, possibly, that was the nerves more than the suit. “It’s okay. Won’t be sad to get out of it later, though.”
He decided to have some lunch first to give himself time to brainstorm; it had been several days since his trip with Teddy, and he was no closer to thinking of anything. Harry had plenty of money, so there was no point in just buying him something expensive to make up for a lack of originality. And besides, he wanted to find a gift that
It had taken several Floo calls and the calling in of a few favors, but by the time Saturday evening came, Draco had an outfit, a reservation, and a plan to put in motion. As the time neared, he carefully styled himself, leaving his pristine white shirt unbuttoned at the top and tucking it into his favorite ankle-length black trousers before adding the grey linen blazer he’d spent a bit too much on that morning. Assessing his reflection, he decided that it had been worth it.
Finally straightening, Draco crossed his arms across his chest and glared at Harry. “Derrick’s a dick. He’s not a good match for you.”
“And how about today, are you looking to find out anything particular about Jack while you’re together?”
There was a click, and the overhead voice was back. “I’m sorry, but there seems to have been a malfunction with one of the mechanisms. Please return to the lobby while we investigate.”
Still, the idea of uprooting his life so suddenly was nerve-racking. Draco was not a risk taker; he was a man of routine, of certainty. He’d spent so many years building what he now had. He’d created a space for himself, and he’d done it on his own. He’d learned how to function in a world that wasn’t the one he’d grown up in; he’d worked hard, climbing up the ranks at his job, and he’d saved his money so that he could rent his nice flat and buy his nice suits and forge a life that didn’t rely on inherited wealth or family connections. He didn’t know if he was ready to give that up.
“Fair enough,” Harry grimaced before changing the subject. “So, why don’t you play much Quidditch these days?”
Resisting the urge to push a few of the nearly-white strands out of Draco’s face, Harry crept into the kitchen, trying not to make enough noise to disturb him. He began preparing his own tea, making sure to put a silencing charm on the kettle. After a moment, he decided to make one for Draco as well; he could just put it under a stasis charm for whenever he woke up.
“Just wandering around, honestly,” Harry said with a shrug. “When I first moved to Hogsmeade I spent a lot of time just walking, getting a feel for it as an adult and not a student.” He grinned. “Weirdly, Honeydukes isn’t the only attraction. Who knew?”
“What Slytherin logic,” Draco observed, looking amused. “Fine, meet me out back in half an hour; I need to go change. But I can only come up for an hour or so.”
” He gave a sideways nod at Harry, who was still glaring at Malfoy with his arms crossed, “but I didn’t fancy that hair. Besides, I look amazing in this suit.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair and let out a shaky breath. “Right. And… the episode?” The thought of his panic attack being broadcast almost set off another one, but Draco shook his head quickly.
Eventually, everybody returned from their various adventures, and they had a nice dinner together before deciding that they wanted to do one more bonfire before they had to return to reality. They sat around the fire sipping on their last eclectic selection of beers as the sun set, the air cooled, and the chorus of crickets and other nighttime creatures began.
Harry followed not long after, burying his face in Draco’s neck to muffle a loud groan. Sliding out, he fell to the side, collapsing next to Draco. “Fucking hell.”
it was possible that Harry’s eyes had a tendency to linger on Draco when no one else was paying attention. But it didn’t
Blaise, who had clearly already known, raised his eyebrows in an unconvincing performance of surprise. “What an unexpected development! And how did this come about?”
Their business apparently concluded for now, the pair spent a few minutes making inconsequential smalltalk before Draco made his way back to his borrowed office. He looked around the space with new eyes as he settled back in front of the computer. Would he want to work here full time? The space was just as nice as the New York office, and he liked the idea of working with Chris again. And London wasn’t all that different from New York, when it came down to it—it was older, and cleaner, but the energy of it was much the same. He’d probably be as comfortable living and working here as he was there.
Apparently deciding that there was nothing he could do about them right now, he focused on Luna. “All I heard was ‘Draco, bad, St. Mungo’s’!” he protested. “He could have been dying for all I knew!”
“Not helpful, Gin.” Harry helped Draco to his feet, where he wavered unsteadily for a moment. “You ready?”
With Harry, he didn’t need to. It was just… there. It was both lovely and terrifying, and it lingered at the back of his mind for the rest of the day, along with his mother’s voice, asking him:
They continued to chat for a while before Harry felt a surreptitious nudge to his shoulder from an unseen hand and took the cue to move along. “Alright, well, I have to go circulate a bit, but it’s been great talking to you. I really enjoyed it.”
Harry didn’t particularly feel like hiking or going back out on the Floaterboat, but there was one thing he’d meant to do and hadn’t gotten a chance to. “I actually think I want to try the kayaks.” He did a quick survey and realized that only one other person hadn’t made a decision yet. “Draco, you up for it?”
Draco held up his hands in surrender, very clearly trying to look sympathetic and not like he was about to laugh. “Best do as she says. She’s already mad that you kept her waiting.” Harry glared at him before snatching the outfit from Pansy and retreating to the loo to change.
Ginny grinned in victory and turned, looping her arms over her shoulders and kissing her lightly. “If that happens, you can use it as an excuse to buy a new wardrobe.”
Harry was now beginning to look a bit concerned. “Er, because he’s my godson? We spend a lot of time together; I assumed you knew that.”
They found a low sofa in a shaded area nearby and settled in. Jack slung one arm along the back casually, just near enough to Harry’s shoulders for him to be constantly aware of it, and their eyes never wavered from Harry’s as they spoke. It was a bit of a conversational minefield; they talked freely about the traveling they’d done on their motorcycle and the cities they’d visited but they clammed up when Harry asked for details on when and why they’d been in any of them. They had a lot of thoughts on esoteric magical theory that made Harry think of Hermione but wouldn’t talk about how or why they’d gotten into learning about it. Harry tried mentioning a paper that Hermione had published during her graduate work that seemed relevant to their interests, and Jack had smiled knowingly and said they were familiar with it and found her ideas fascinating but wouldn’t elaborate.
“Well!” Blaise announced once the front doors had swung shut. “Hilde, Jack, Leela, Perry, Sadiyah, Sullivan—welcome to the final six. From here, you will each get a chance to have a day-long solo date with Harry, after which he will narrow his choices down to his top three and then, ultimately, one. Congratulations! I’ll be in touch soon. For now, enjoy your day.”
The table that they were led to was on the outskirts of the network of paths, enough trees between it and the other diners to make it feel secluded and private. Harry continued to look around in awe even as they settled into their seats. “This is unbelievable,” he breathed, finally looking down from the flickering lanterns hovering over their table to meet Draco’s gaze. “How the hell did you find this place?”
He set his glass down. “Mother, please don’t.” His good mood was faltering. He didn’t want to discuss this with her. He didn’t want to overthink it. He just wanted to enjoy it while it lasted, not worry about how it was going to end or how it could potentially affect anyone else if he let it go too far. It was between him and Harry, and he wanted it to stay that way.
—in like this. Soon, though, the slow, rocking slide wasn’t enough, and Harry tried to urge Draco to pick up the pace with his heels against his back. When Draco didn’t respond, Harry growled in frustration. “Come on, I’m not fragile; you can speed up.”
Harry gave a surprised snort. “Oh god. He would have made us eat all of them, just to make a point.” Perry met his eyes, holding his gaze for a moment, and then they both burst out laughing.
Draco didn’t respond immediately, and Harry could feel the panic begin to take hold. Fuck. He’d know this was a bad idea, he’d
has tried his best to arrange dates that, one, are things that he thought you would enjoy and, two, allow for conversation. This is your last chance to really figure these people out, so don’t waste it on small talk. Got it?”
When it was finally time to meet Perry, Harry did his best to clear his mind and go into the evening focused solely on the two of them and any potential future together. Perry looked uncertain himself as he greeted Harry by the door. “You doing okay?” he asked, and Harry nodded, willing it to be true.
The season had passed with almost inconceivable speed, and the playoffs were fast approaching when the Arrows and the Wasps came up against each other in one of these more informal games. They had played a tournament match earlier in the season where they’d been neck and neck up until Harry just barely beat Draco to the Snitch, securing an Arrows victory, and the Wasps were gunning for vengeance.
Yes, Jack is really gone. No, they are not coming back. No, I will never explain what their deal was. I do have a vague idea of what was up with them that I was loosely basing their actions on, but it’s probably less interesting than what y’all could come up with on your own, so please feel free to share your theories with me! I’d love to hear them.
“He’s probably in his workshop,” he said, quietly. “He goes there when he needs to think, sometimes.” Draco closed his eyes in relief, letting out a breath, and nodded. No wild goose chase, then. When he opened his eyes again, Ron’s look was knowing. “You should go before mum gets back,” he advised, “or you’re never leaving.”
“Takeout?” Draco rolled his eyes, and Harry shoved off the counter, moving  around the kitchen island and sliding onto one of the tall stools. He leaned his elbows on the surface, watching Draco work.
Harry’s mind went blank. “Well, I really like her,” he eventually equivocated. “She’s really easy to talk to and seems like she’s up for anything. I like the idea of a partner who’s into a bit of thrill seeking from time to time.”
Harry was filled with unexpected warmth. “That’s… thank you, Perry. I think I really needed to hear that.” He wasn’t getting rejected again. But he also wasn’t being cornered. He wasn’t sure which was more of a relief. He just knew that he appreciated not having the decision made for him for once.
One by one, with various levels of trepidation, they deposited their wands in the container as instructed and filed through the door into a darkened room. Behind them, the door swung shut, and there was the audible
“Sure,” Harry agreed, unwilling to end their pleasant afternoon just yet. It had been great catching up with his old teammate. He’d known that Oliver had been appointed Captain for Puddlemere the year before, and listening to him talk about the changes he’d made and was planning reminded Harry just how much he, himself, loved the game. Oliver had been his introduction to competitive Quidditch; spending time with him was doing wonders for his mood, quickly washing away the pessimism and worry of the past day.
“Well, for the record, I’m horrified; your opinion is wrong and you should be ashamed. But I’ll leave olives off the grocery list.”
And suddenly— suddenly, everything seemed very simple. He took a deep breath, and he let it out, and he made a decision. For once in his life, Draco Malfoy was going to be brave.
Waking naked and curled around Draco, knowing that there was no need to pull away or be embarrassed, was one of the nicest things Harry thought he had ever experienced. He allowed himself to stay put, breathing in the comforting scent of Draco’s skin and hair, until he felt him stirring in his arms.
Harry wrinkled his nose. “I’m still not wild about it,” he admitted. “I don’t suppose you can talk Pansy and Draco into letting me keep my clothes on?”
“Better, I’d like to think.” She looked around her. “Well, this is a change from the Manor, isn’t it?”
The house was intentionally rugged-looking, made of thick logs of dark-stained wood. The roof’s high peak shielded a wall of plate glass windows.  A sprawling deck wrapped around three sides, jutting out over a rocky hill dotted with even more trees. To their left, at the back of the house, a wide stone patio held a large hot tub and fire pit.  Harry squinted, trying to look between the lounge chairs for the advertised wood-burning pizza oven.  Straight ahead of them, past the house, he could just make out the glint of sunlight on the lake that he knew they would find there.
“Fuck it,” he heard Harry say, and then there were hands on either side of his head and he was being—quite thoroughly—kissed, right there in the alley. He melted into it immediately, pulling Harry closer to himself almost instinctively. There was an iron tang of blood as their tongues met, and Draco wasn’t sure whose it was, but he didn’t particularly care. He didn’t care about much of anything, right now, besides Harry’s hands, and Harry’s lips, and the press of Harry’s chest and hips against his own, and whether Harry might want to reenact this moment later but somewhere with a bed and a lot less clothes.
Harry unlocked the front door of the cabin for the third time in as many days. To his surprise, the interior had been rearranged and redecorated—the walls were a dark teal, the sofa pale grey and arranged against a wall with a low table in front of it, and the brick fireplace had been replaced with a gas stove. The dining table was now a hightop with tall bar stools, although it was set just as nicely as before.
It was soft, and slow, and unbearable. Harry’s free hand came to Draco’s waist, and Draco’s both rose to cup his face. Their lips moved gently against one another, and Draco could taste the spices of the mulled wine lingering on Harry’s tongue as it flicked briefly at his own before retreating all too soon. He almost went to chase it, but then he felt something damp on his thumbs. He pulled back, startled and concerned, and Harry laughed wetly, freeing Draco to wipe at his eyes.
“I’m not saying I don’t like it,” he said, watching the scenery go by, “I’m just saying I feel like it should be… I don’t know, choppier, or something. If you close your eyes you can barely tell we’re moving.”
“Very sure,” Draco promised. Harry kissed him again, withdrawing his hand, and Draco could hear the clattering of a belt and the telltale
At her assent, Draco stepped aside to allow her to enter. Once she’d straightened, Pansy took Draco by the shoulders and kissed him on both cheeks before stepping back to look him up and down. ‘You’re looking better than the last time I saw you,” she observed.
Draco glared. He didn’t want to capitulate—giving his father an inch would inevitably lead to trouble. But his mother was right; if Astoria’s parents had told her that he would be escorting her, and he refused to do so and insisted on attending the gala alone, he would look like an absolute arse—which was the last thing he wanted at the moment. He had no wish to hurt Astoria’s feelings—he remembered her being a nice enough girl back at Hogwarts—but more important was the potential damage openly jilting her could do to his already-fragile reputation. He knew that his recruitment by a British team had been begrudging; if it weren’t for his massive popularity and success on the French Quidditch circuit, there was no way he would have been welcomed back.
“No. Well, I mean, yeah, it did, but not— everything’s fine. I just.” Now that he was standing here, he realized that he had absolutely no idea what to say.
“What?” Draco asked, voice innocent but smile devious. “Honestly I think you could make some money off of it. Most of our year at Hogwarts would want a copy.”
When dinner was done, Harry, Draco, and Teddy made their way to a pond on the outskirts of town that had been temporarily converted into an ice rink. Spintwitches had set up a booth to rent skates out of, and several benches had been arranged nearby. Sparkling lights (charmed Muggle ones rather than live fairies, Draco was smugly pleased to see) were strung overhead between tall wooden posts that had been spaced along the ice’s edge.
It was a relief when Pansy and Draco came to brief him on the next day’s date. They came by earlier than usual, interrupting him as he once again sat amongst a chaotic spread of puzzle pieces, unable to concentrate well enough to put any of them together.
“Good, I have some errands to run. I’ll see you both tomorrow.” He unfolded himself from his chair and left without another word. Pansy rolled her eyes and moved to follow.
Once Harry had climbed into his own boat—without incident, much to Draco’s apparent chagrin, based on his glare—they spent a few minutes experimenting, working out the best depth to row at and how to turn smoothly. It was actually pretty intuitive, and Draco picked it up in barely more time than it took Harry to reacclimate.
“It’s nothing that…” Ron looked frustrated, but sighed and shook his head. “Ugh, fine. Here’s the thing. He’s not going to say anything, because he’s Harry. He doesn’t really… ask for the things he wants. You know? Never really got used to being
At the end of the night, when they had all been well beyond drunk, Draco vaguely remembered leaning heavily on Harry Potter’s shoulder whilst they earnestly discussed something-or-other. There had, he thought, been some emphatic clasping of arms and clumsy grabbing of hands as points were expressed, overly tactile in the way that the extremely inebriated were wont to be. He could recall Ron Weasley looking on in wry amusement before finally telling Harry that it was about time he got home to bed. Weasley had apparently drawn the short straw and was the night’s designated Apparator for people who lived too far away or were too drunk to make it home safely on their own. Draco had insisted on walking, unwilling to accept assistance from anyone at all, let alone a Weasley (he was reasonably sure he had managed to keep this last bit to himself, which he thought was rather good of him), and was pleased that he had managed to get back all in one piece. Once inside, he went straight to his room, flopped face-first and fully clothed onto his bed, and was unconscious within seconds.
Stretching, he allowed himself to enjoy the satisfying cracks of his body adjusting itself while taking in the sun-drenched room. It was another gorgeous day. He pondered going for a fly or laying out by the pool with one of his books before coming to the startling realization that he didn’t actually know whether he was allowed to do either of those things. Pressing the small bell that would summon the house elf service, he climbed out of bed and went to set a bath running—regardless of what else the day would bring, he could use a good soak, and the lavender bubble bath sitting by the tub had been tempting him since he arrived.
“What a day, eh, Harry?” he opened, smile as dazzling as ever. “It seems like you’re starting to get a clearer picture of who your potential partners are. Did you have any big realizations today?”
“My parents brought me once for lunch, when I was a child. There are wizarding spaces all throughout the Gardens; have been for over a hundred years. Anyone magical can
“Actually, yes. I’ve been seeing the father of one of my beginners ballet students for a couple of months now.”
Draco cursed himself for getting so intoxicated the night before. Things had been going fairly well with Potter up until that point—the trip to London had been surprisingly nice, and their impromptu coffee had been perfectly pleasant. But then Blaise had had to go and put all sorts of
. When they reached the bottom of the hill, panting to catch their breath, Draco had almost flopped backward off the sled. “That,” he said breathlessly, “was awesome.” Harry cackled.
There was a long shopping list of things for the party: table linens, party favors, wine, more decorations that would fit Merlin-knew-where, and new robes, among other things. It was excessive, and they both knew it, but it made her happy and so he didn’t say anything. Draco was still mildly surprised by the warm welcomes they received in every shop they entered, but he supposed that time and money could heal almost anything.
“Wish I could’ve,” Harry sighed. “What made you decide to leave? Were you parents heavily involved in the resistance during the first war?”
I give you Captain Hugh Capulet and his team: Katie Bell! Zacharias Smith! Peter Davidson! Tyranus Tybalt! Gregory Goyle! And, returning to the field after last season’s cataclysmic final,
“Things with Harry,” Luna reiterated with a serene smile. “We’re done for now, you can sit back down.”
“A dangerous artifact that we stole from a bank,” Ron countered, but he dutifully added more food to his plate before plopping back down next to Hermione.
“What’s run its course?” Max asked. He looked truly perplexed. Draco almost felt sorry for him. Almost. Certainly not enough to continue having extremely lackluster sex with him.
We’re about a third of the way through! Thanks for sticking with me so far. Things are gonna start picking up a bit from here (I’d say tomorrow’s basically the end of Act One), so stay tuned!
He was met with whoops of excitement from the contestants, making him laugh and relax a bit. He let himself be pulled into the group, doing his best to move with the music, unsure if he was managing but supposing that it didn’t matter all that much. Sure, the whole wizarding world would be able to watch his awkward movements repeatedly if they wanted to, but it wasn’t like he was known for being anything approaching graceful. Soon enough, it mattered even less, because he was being passed from partner to partner and was able to move along with them, not needing to figure out the beat of the music himself.
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “I see you, Gabrielle, I do. I know you’re not a child. But I’m still so
“No, that’s alright, we won’t be long,” Owen said. “The thing is…” He trailed off, glancing helplessly at Rose.
When Harry and his friends had gotten hooked on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it hadn’t taken more than a few episodes for the teasing to begin. “Tall, dark, handsome, broody, and with a savior complex? Come on mate, even you have to admit that you’re fulfilling an archetype, here,” Ron had told him when Harry had tried to get him to come to his defense.
“Well, we haven’t decided anything officially,” Harry said, squeezing Draco’s hand, “but I’m pretty confident in saying that it’s time to pass that crown on for good.”
“Wonderful! So for the rest of you, figure drawing is where you use live models to study and draw the human form.”
He twirled his quill a bit, watching her face. “It’s just, it seems as though most of the people he’s close with are already invited, that’s all.”
“My apologies. You are still the poshest of the posh bastards. William Williams III has nothing on you.”
“I’m so sorry. That was Andromeda. She’s apparently got food poisoning and needs me to come get Teddy.”
“Get down here,” he ordered, tugging on Harry’s hand. And, despite the room full of people still surrounding them, Harry did.
Pansy pushed Harry toward Blaise, positioning him a few steps away so that she had time to duck out of the shot before Blaise and the cameras headed his way.
Draco closed the door behind him and walked over to Harry’s bed, standing over him with his hands in his pockets. “So. That was a thing that happened.”
“Sadiyah, what about you?” Blaise asked once the audience’s laughter died down. “You seemed to be a bit more conflicted about things than Leela when you left.”
I didn’t base this on any particular theme park, since I’ve never actually been to one in the UK. However, I went to Six Flags the weekend before I wrote this and went on several enjoyable stomach-dropping rides, and my spouse had to run from an overcurious bee after we got drinks (although luckily, no stinging occurred!). I did do some minimal research on the heights and speeds of the largest modern rollercoasters to give Harry a ballpark to work with, at least? Thanks, Wikipedia!
They actually were in a group class today, but it was Muggle, so the ten or so strangers settled at cook stations around them weren’t a problem. Harry was somewhat curious at how the camera crew were managing, but figured that they knew what they were doing, so it was probably fine.
“Wampus cat,” Hermione breathed. “Don’t meet its eyes; they’d rumored to have legilimency and hypnotic abilities.”
“Really? I would have thought you’d be into that sort of thing. The way you talk about New York, it sounds like a dinner party sort of place.”
“I think it’s time to go back,” he said quietly, knowing that Draco would hear him and take care of it. Then he turned and walked away.
When they returned, Ginny was already in the lake, paddling slowly to keep herself afloat. “Come on in, the water’s perfect!” she yelled up at them.
Perry closed his eyes again, covering his face with his hands. “I’m not going to say that this is the
There’s still a second bedroom set up for him, but he doesn’t use it. Honestly, we’ve stopped pretending that he ever intended to; it’s just where he stores his stuff. Which is super useful, because he’s stupid levels of particular about his clothes (despite stealing my favorite hoodie at least twice a week), and he’d probably strangle me if I organized them incorrectly. He’s got a system. It’s ridiculously complicated. It’s also kind of cute.
Malfoy gave a theatrically exasperated sigh, but there was a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth. “Well, go on then. We’ve got plenty of time for me to destroy you at Billiards another day.”
“Reginald is very pleased to meet you all,” Luna told them as they finished their procession of introductions, “and would like to accompany us to the summit, if you don’t mind.”
“Good lord, no,” Blaise interjected. “It’s obviously margarita weather. And I don’t trust either of you with my recipe, so I’ll make them myself. I assume you bought me the correct supplies?” At Greg’s affirmative, he unfolded himself from where he’d been lounging, drawing attention to his rather eccentric ensemble. He was wearing a filmy floral skirt that was obviously Luna’s—it was probably full-length on her, but on him, it hit at mid-calf. He’d paired it with gold sandals that must have been charmed larger to fit him and a matching three-strand gold necklace that hung almost to his navel. Harry found himself feeling both amused and resigned at the realization that he pulled it off perfectly.
“Why?” Harry shook his head, attempting, in vain, to clear it enough to form more than one-syllable sentences. Was he dreaming?
Harry quickly downed the rest of his drink and set it on a tall table before turning back to Perry. Perry was… well, Perry was awful, if Harry was honest. He had no rhythm whatsoever, and his moves were oddly robotic. It was actually quite comforting. Freed from the pressure to actually look good, Harry busted out some of his most ridiculous dance moves—the ones he and Ron employed at weddings when they’d gone a bit too heavy on the champagne. Perry caught on immediately, and soon they were in an absurd sort of dance off involving moves like the lawnmower and the shopping cart. Harry was laughing in delight when he felt someone move in close behind him.
Since the date had ended on the early side, Harry used the rest of the day to sleep, read, and swim a few laps to burn off the strange mood that his... whatever it was with Draco had left him in. His head kept wanting to call it a date, but even though it had been arranged as one, that obviously wasn’t the case in the end, since his actual date had pulled a disappearing act. But it had
Harry could feel himself turning bright red, and must have made some sort of sound, because Draco snapped out of it and smirked knowingly at Harry before moving to climb the rest of the way in. His eyes were still on Harry, however, and he almost managed to tumble right over the other side in his distraction. Harry had to drop his grip on the boat to grab him under the arms and help him slide the rest of the way into the seat. Draco’s face flushed in embarrassment, which made Harry feel quite a bit better.
Draco observed Potter for a moment, his strong back and muscular arms highlighted by his fitted button up, which strained slightly as he leant forward over his desk, going back to whatever he’d been working on. He wasn’t bad to look at these days, Draco had to admit. In fact, he’d gotten quite fit over the years, if he was being honest with himself. Rather hot, actually, if you were into powerful men with perpetually just-shagged looking hair. And they certainly had chemistry, albeit the kind that was rooted in years of bitter rivalry that had evolved into a sort of recreational antagonism when they’d become coworkers. Verbally sparring with Potter always got Draco’s adrenaline up. He wondered—
Harry’s amusement came to an abrupt halt as he rushed to cut her off. “RIGHT. Pizza. Downstairs. Draco, were you looking for something?” He knew that his voice had gone a bit high, but anything was better than letting Luna finish that sentence.
Harry gave him an apologetic grimace. “Not so much. I was just wondering whether there are limits to what spaces I can use on off days. We never really went over it, and I was thinking of going flying or something, but I didn’t know if I was allowed.”
“Hello, Potter,” Draco said belatedly, realizing that he was staring and hoping desperately that his distraction came off as ‘half asleep’ and not ‘openly ogling.’
He was beginning to give up hope of finding anything when his attention was caught by Harry’s miniature town in the window of the toy shop he’d visited with Teddy. He stopped to watch the tiny train traveling along its path, puffing out small clouds of steam as it went. Without really thinking about what he was doing, he found himself going inside and making his way back to the tree holding all of Harry’s little carved animals.
“No worries. It’s nice to talk about something other than my career sometimes. It eats up enough of my attention as it is. I’m a Healer.”
It would be worth it, they knew. It was just a matter of figuring out how to go about making it happen without burning everything else they’d built for themselves to the ground.
I find him lying on the ground without me, eyes closed, listening to The Fugees. There’s a bottle next to him, though it’s still mostly full, and his face is splotchy like he’s been crying.
“And I’m sure that’s very much by design,” Draco countered. “As I recall, Blaise rather takes after his mother when it comes to longevity of relationships. I think we would all be better off if I didn’t pursue that particular route.”
“Yeah. For about a year. But, well, I’m Halfblood, so when things… you know.” Owen grimaced. “My parents took me out of school. So Rose and I lost touch. But seeing each other again, we just sort of…”
Harry wanted to laugh, but he didn’t have the energy. With a groan, he let his paddle fall flat across his lap. “I need a break.”
“Then it wasn’t your fault, Draco. I made a choice to forgive you and your mother for being caught up on the wrong side of things, because you did nothing that I can say for certain that I wouldn’t have done myself if I had to, to protect them. If I had been told I could save them by defecting, I honestly do not know if I would have been strong enough to refuse.” She paused, taking a sip of tea. “We’ve worked hard to heal and move on, Draco. Our family, yes, but our whole society, as well.” She reached out and took his hand, squeezing it lightly, and Draco squeezed back.
“Oh, shit!” Harry grabbed the rail and looked over, alarmed, only to see Cormac burst back up, gasping and pushing his hair out of his face. “You okay?” he called down.
If he were to trace everything back to the beginning, Harry would have to admit that his current predicament was largely his own fault. He had, after all, been the one to introduce the Weasley clan to the concept of television.
“Yes, and if your grandmother finds out she won’t let you stay over anymore, so hush,” Potter told the boy with a wink. He turned an apologetic look toward the still-sleep-dazed Draco. “I tried to explain to him that you’re on New York time and that he should let you sleep, but he’s really excited that you’re here.”
“Of course,” Chris said, unperturbed, “I expected no less. If you decide you’re interested, I’d prefer to start you sooner rather than later, though, so I’d appreciate it if you could give me an answer before the end of the year.”
“Blaise managed to snag the downstairs shower as soon as Greg finished, and he’ll be ages. As for this one—” He gestured behind himself “—Ginevra and Pansy have taken it over.
“Right, okay. Well, don’t answer if you feel weird about it, but this thing happened when I was talking to Gabrielle a while back. She sort of... mentioned something about someone not being very nice to her, I guess? But she clammed up right after; wouldn’t say who. Is there anything going on that I should know about?”
he was, even like this. He fell back as Draco returned fully to the bed, pushing on his chest and climbing atop him. Bracing himself on one hand, Draco used the other to carefully slick them both, immediately turning Harry’s laugh into a moan. “Jesus.”
Ron, we found and destroyed a dangerous artifact.” Hermione sounded exasperatedly fond. “And get enough food for me, too, please.”
When they’d finished, Harry attempted to pay, but Draco brushed him off. “I’m still wooing you,” he chided. “You may pay when you ask
Pansy had initially wanted to end each episode of the show with a rose ceremony like the ones in the Muggle Bachelor series, but in this one battle, Harry had put his foot down. “I won’t do that. It takes forever, and it’s humiliating for everyone involved. I’d rather just rip the bandaid off than make people stand there wondering for ages for dramatic effect.” After a significant amount of back and forth, it had finally been agreed that, at the ceremony, Harry could simply call forward the contestants that he was eliminating, wish them the best, and send them on their way without dragging things on unnecessarily.
Hilde looked pained, but stepped out of her heels and put them into one of the cubbies next to Harry’s.
Everyone shuffled off the field in various states of exhaustion. When they’d all gathered around him, Harry gave them what he hoped was an encouraging smile. “Well! That was certainly interesting, if a bit unconventional.” There was only a smattering of tired laughter, but aside from William, nobody looked truly put out, which Harry counted as a win. And speaking of wins…
“Some dinosaurs can fly, too, silly! And dragons have fire, but dinosaurs have T-Rex on their team!”
“Oh, I know I went about it badly,” she told him with a laugh, stepping in closer, running a hand up his arm, “but I was young and stupid and thought there wasn’t any possible way you would return my feelings otherwise. But now… we’re so well suited, Harry, don’t you see? And I’ve been in love with you for so long—” She moved closer still, backing Harry almost into the hedge and lifting up on her toes, angling her mouth towards his.
“No,” Hilde told him, giving him a dimpled smile, “but we were at Hogwarts together. I was two years below you and in Slytherin, though, so we never had any friends in common.”
“Anyway,” Draco coughed. “I don’t care for this nonsense about your supposed lack of career and so-called ‘random volunteering’. How many hours a week do you spend working with all those charities you support? I doubt it’s less than forty. And that’s not to mention your financial contributions! Frankly, I think that all suits you much better than whatever random standard career you might have settled for. I can’t see you doing one thing forever, let alone something you weren’t passionate about. You’re far too much of a walking savior complex for that.”
“Yes, we would need to transfer your clients to someone else, but we’d build in some time to ensure a smooth transition before you took on your new duties here.”
to work with or this interview was probably going to go on for ages. “Well, I suppose I’m a tiny bit skeptical about Dermot at this point. I feel like it’s possible he’s here more for publicity than for me.”
As everyone else sat frozen, Luna stood and moved toward the boundary of their shield, peering at the cat before smiling brightly back at them all. “It’s okay, you can lower the shields.”
“Why not?” Jack stuck their hands in their pockets and stepped back a bit, taking Harry’s breath with them.
“Yeah, I noticed. But, babe.” Harry steps forward again, taking Draco’s hand when he doesn’t back away. “You said it yourself. You were only getting rid of the hostile parts. This house… Draco, this house fucking hated me. And I hated it right back.”
A thought occurred to Draco. “Not to be rude, Mother, but who would even come to a Malfoy party these days? We’re hardly the most popular family after everything.”
“Fucking hell,” he could just barely hear Draco mutter over the roaring of blood in his ears, and then a hot splash hit his chest, informing him that he wasn’t alone in his release. Draco slumped down on top of him, smearing the streaks of come between them.
“Perfect! Now, everyone, watch how I work. See how I’m just following the basic movements of Harry’s body? I’m not drawing the outline, just the general flow: the curve of his spine here, the angle of his calf to his thigh here, the tilt of his head? Once all of that’s in place, if there’s time left, you can add in some of the volume—Harry has quite nice shoulders, for instance, so I’ll try to capture a bit of the build of them like this… and then, his bottom is quite round, which balances out the form well, so—”
He was distracted from his musings by a pair of long arms wrapping around him from behind and a pointy chin resting itself on his shoulder. He relaxed and leaned back into Draco’s embrace. “You’ll stay for awhile?” he asked.
A warm fuzziness—a combination of alcohol and affection—spread through Draco as the night wore on, lowering his inhibitions. He could feel his gaze lingering on Harry’s face, his lips, his throat, longer than it probably should, but he didn’t try very hard to rein it in. When his leg brushed inadvertently against Harry’s under the table, he didn’t move it away. Once or twice, as Harry licked a drop of whisky off of his lips, Draco had to close his eyes for a moment to keep from leaning across the table and taking over the task with his own tongue. He kept trying to get up the courage to actually tell Harry ‘
“Because he’s even more of an insecure idiot than you are.” When Harry looked back up at her, she actually looked almost sympathetic, which was a bit of a disturbing expression to see on her usually-smirking face. “Look. Nothing’s ever 100% certain, but I would bet anything that he wants you just as much as you want him. I’d… hell. I’d stake my own relationship on it, and I know you know that I wouldn’t risk Ginny for anything. But you need to do something before he gives up and moves on. No one’s willing to wait forever, not even Draco.”
Draco traded places with him at the island, planning out how to cut as many biscuits from the dough as he could with minimal waste. Harry, meanwhile, drew his wand and began tracing intricate snowflake shapes in the sugar dough.
She shrugged. “Not much to tell, really. I work in the Muggle Liaison Office at the Ministry; it’s a bit boring, but it pays the bills.”
“Me too,” she told him. “But thank you for being honest with me. I hope that you find what you are looking for.” Their hug was much more sincere. Harry kissed the top of her head once more before releasing her.
He heard Draco laugh beside him. “Well, you are extremely stupid, I’ve always said so.” Harry snorted. “But,” Draco continued, “you’re also one of the
“French toast sounds amazing.” He poured himself a cup of coffee and sat at the table, watching Harry work.
From behind them, they could hear people muttering in annoyance as someone pushed past them with a sheepish, “Sorry, sorry! My friends are just… sorry—” Finally, Neville slid up beside them, hair spiked out in every direction, guitar slung over his back. “Sorry,” he gasped again, “got caught up at work. One of the Devil’s Snares was misbehaving.”
“I had no idea they had children,” Draco commented, slightly surprised. It hadn’t been mentioned at the bar the other night, as far as he could remember.
“Ron!” Harry cried as soon as his wand dropped, but Parvati was already by his side, countering the spell, and Ron’s body relaxed almost immediately.
“Riiiiiight. Anyway, I’ve got to go find Ron and Hermione; it was good seeing you, though!” He turned back to Draco, resting a hand on his upper arm. “I really am glad you came. I know it’s a little weird for you, being back.”
Dropping the cloak and his broom to the floor, Harry was relieved to be immediately swept into a tight hug. “You don’t seem surprised to see me,” he mumbled into Draco’s shoulder, allowing the warmth of the blond’s body to sink into his chilled skin.
Pansy shrugged, looking unconcerned. “The network added them. I didn’t ask. Now get ready—dress nicely, but not too nicely; something you’d wear on a normal first date. Be ready for Blaise at noon.”
By the time he was passing over the Manor’s formal gardens, Harry had almost convinced himself to turn around and fly right back home before he made an idiot of himself. Just at that moment, however, he glanced down and caught sight of a figure seated on a bench in the rose garden, white hair glimmering in the moonlight. Flying a bit lower, Harry let out a breath as he got close enough to make out the grey suit that Malfoy had been wearing earlier. Assured that he wouldn’t be accidentally disturbing either Lucius or Narcissa, Harry descended, making sure to do so within Malfoy’s sightline so as not to startle him into throwing a hex.
Harry gave him a half smile. “Thanks. Stupid of me to go off with her; I’m glad your crew decided to follow. Give my regards to whoever thought of the moths.”
Cormac and Romilda took on matching expressions of annoyance, but the others didn’t seem bothered by Harry’s approach, thankfully. Gabrielle gave him a shy smile. “I have been training as a perfumer,” she told him.
“Right.” Draco smirked, but kicked off his shoes and settled down, cross-legged, at the other side of the puzzle.
Narcissa gave him a pointed look. “Would you prefer to help me write up the timing for tomorrow’s food preparation?”
Harry Apparated them into what Draco assumed was his flat; he didn’t bother taking the time to look around and make sure, since Harry immediately reclaimed his lips once they’d landed. “You,” he said between kisses, “are an absolute. Fucking. Tease.”
Teddy did rouse briefly when they landed in front of the house, but it was just as well, since he still needed to get ready for bed. Draco observed fondly as Harry pushed him through his routine, getting him to brush his teeth and change into his pajamas before climbing into bed. “You good there?” Harry asked him as he pulled the covers up to his chin.
Harry couldn’t help it. He snorted, tried to hold it back, and then burst into uncontrollable laughter. At his response, hesitant smiles appeared on the faces of a few of the others; Sullivan wasn’t even bothering to hold back, grinning widely. Jack had their arms crossed as they leaned against a tall shelf, one eyebrow raised in perpetual amusement. Hilde and Leela, at least, had the grace to look somewhat concerned.
Blaise clapped his hands together once with evident enthusiasm. “Good morning, everyone! It’s good to see you all.” He looked around at the gathered group, all of whom were waiting patiently in an odd sort of parlor. “We have an exciting date planned for you today, so I hope you’re all well rested and ready to go. Now. Do any of you know what an escape room is?”
Harry was tired. He was so tired, and so sick of hurting, and just intoxicated enough, still, that he couldn’t think up a plausible way to get out of this—and so he gave up. Maybe Ginny and Luna would let him crash with them for a while, if Draco kicked him out. Or even if he didn’t. Harry was recognizing, as he felt his carefully built walls crumbling around him, that he’d let it go on too long. He should have left before it got this bad. He should have left as soon as he’d realized what he was feeling, what it meant. He closed his eyes, wrapped his arms around himself.
“One more for me!” Harry crowed, scratching a new tally mark next to his name on the chalkboard behind Draco’s head. “Better luck next time, Malfoy.” The board had a partner behind Harry’s desk, and the tallies recorded on one would reflect on the other, but Harry took great joy in invading Draco’s space and rubbing his victories in his face at every opportunity. Not that Draco was any better. It was part of the fun.
He paused looking to Draco for some sort of affirmation, and Draco nodded, no idea where this was going.
“I was exploring the woods,” she told him. “I’ve been researching the magical creatures of this region, and I was hoping to find signs of Wampus cats. They’re mostly further west, but I’ve heard that some have been spotted out this way.”
Draco let out a shuddering breath and leant down, kissing Harry again. Despite his earlier bravado, it was clear that he was nervous. Harry was, too; everything they’d done so far had been amazing, but there was something about the intimacy of this, of Draco being inside of him, that felt overwhelmingly
Harry gave a half-hearted shrug, not quite meeting Draco’s eyes. “Yeah, I just wasn’t feeling particularly festive, I guess. Didn’t want to bring everyone down.”
“I’ve arranged with the Greengrasses for you to escort Astoria to the gala tomorrow night,” he said, cutting himself another small bite of lamb.
Dermot was looking increasingly annoyed, so Harry cleared his throat, trying to break the train of the conversation. “Right! More champagne, anyone?” The conversation had left him with an odd taste in his mouth; there was something about Dermot’s reactions to the questions about his career that seemed off. He tried to shake it off as they all topped up their glasses. Soon, the group had disbursed, leaving Harry to figure out how to go about speaking to everyone.
“It’s still a bit early to say, I think,” Harry answered, straightening his back at a covert gesture from Pansy where she had joined the crew. “I did really enjoy talking to everyone, though. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was.”
“Wonderful! You may move anything in the room that is moveable, unlock anything that you have a key to, open anything that will open, and use any tools that you find. The only rule is that you can’t break anything. Oh, and also—” His sudden smile made Harry nervous— “you have to turn in your wands.”
They spent a pleasant hour discussing the broad strokes of the sisters’ plans before Teddy came tearing in from wherever he’d been entertaining himself and insisted that Draco come participate in the war that was apparently being waged between his dinosaurs and his dragons.
Draco tried not to seethe at the fact that apparently the whole world was aware of Harry Potter’s private life, but no one had thought to fill him in. Not that it was any of his business, he supposed. Still, he couldn’t help but feel as though he should have been informed. Sighing and trying not to look too hard at that particular feeling, he went back to his stack of invitations.
“Yeah, that’s me, a true gentleman,” Harry said with a snort before standing up. “Let’s go poke around a bit more out in the main room. There’s got to be an elf service button around somewhere; they wouldn’t leave us with no way to contact anyone. What if there was an emergency?”
He should be able to do this, he thought in frustration. Any one of them would probably fit in at pub nights or Weasley family holidays or any number of other things that were important to him. But his imagination wasn't cooperating. The someone by his side stayed a sort of nebulous idea of a person, flashes of intently focused eyes or knowing smirks the most he could make out.
“Why don’t we let Harry find his feet and you and I can do a loop and come back to him?” Draco suggested.
“I don’t know,” he told her honestly. “Maybe in different circumstances, I might have. But right now… no. I don’t think that I can. And it’s not fair for me to keep you here on the chance that the next two weeks might change things.”
It was a question that Harry was still asking himself. “It was unexpected,” he settled on for now, “but not unwelcome. I’m not really interested in getting physically involved with anyone before I have more of an idea of where things are going, in general, but it was a nice moment.”
“Brunch,” Draco told her. “It’s a New York staple. Makes us feel better about not getting up until noon and drinking champagne with our eggs.”
“Did you not learn how to fly a broom before you came back?” Harry asked, surprised. “You were so good at ground Quidditch, though! I just assumed you played.”
With this in mind, he headed back to his rooms just long enough to change into suitable clothes and grab the tiny mp3 player he’d shoved into the bottom of his bag. His chest clenched uncomfortably as he took in the nearly-complete puzzle still sitting on his floor, and he quickly looked away, not wanting to think about it. Once outside again, he stretched thoroughly and set off toward the perimeter of the grounds, blasting his music to drown out his thoughts. The property that the mansion sat on was huge, and completing a full lap took him into the early afternoon, leaving him sore, exhausted, and unable to form a single coherent thought—exactly as he’d hoped. Returning to his rooms, he rang for lunch, took a long, hot shower, and climbed into bed for a nap.
Once he’d finished breakfast, he settled himself at the dining room table with his mother, a stack of embossed parchment, and a quill.
“Ronald, you’re riding in my car anyway,” Hermione said exasperatedly, cutting him off. “And yes, you do,” she added matter-of-factly to Harry.
“Probably shouldn’t have gone in for professional Quidditch and then shacked up with your very famous teammate if you were aiming to be lower profile,” Ron smirked, raising his hands in surrender when Harry lifted his head just enough to glower at him. “I’m just saying.”
“Well, if it isn’t Draco Malfoy!” The declaration, spoken fondly in a strong American accent, had Draco grinning even before he turned to face the person it had come from.
Everyone walked off, and Perry turned to Harry. “I think that might actually be the worst thing I’ve ever tasted,” he remarked.
Draco nodded and sat on the exam table in the middle of the room, trying his best to keep still as Luna wordlessly cast a series of spells over him. After a few minutes, she began directing him to move in various ways—he assumed to test flexibility or something. He was holding what he vaguely recognized as a yogic tree pose when she spoke again. “And how are things going with Harry?”
Nancy had removed her muffins from the oven at some point while they were all working, and once everyone’s trays were in the oven, she called them back up to the front. “Did everyone set their timers?” She asked.
Trays of biscuits went in and out of the oven, icing was mixed, lemon curd was whisked, and cooling charms were cast. Harry’s snowflakes were carefully floated to a tray where he could begin piping delicate white patterns onto them, while Draco moved to the table with Teddy to decorate the gingerbread, Narcissa began sandwiching raspberry jam into the stars, and Andromeda moved on to preparing peppermint meringues.
Draco blushed furiously. “I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.” Determinedly, he snatched a clean sheet of parchment and began concentrating very hard on his work, ignoring the quiet laughter coming from across the table.
“Well I think it sounds like fun,” said Ginny, chiming in from the kitchen table where she was sipping a beer and watching them in amusement. “How many people did you say this place could sleep?”
Harry smiled and, as though reading Draco’s mind, told him “They have a rule that they aren’t allowed to talk about her at pub night. That’s their ‘grown up time.’ But yeah, she’s about six months old. She’s great.”
They stopped by Fortesque’s and had ice cream, after which Draco allowed Teddy to drag him through several more shops before finally saying that it was time for him to make some decisions.
glad that it’s all being recorded,” he muttered, his words muffled but still clear enough for Harry to hear. “Okay,” he said, dropping his hands and standing up. “I’m going to walk you through this, and then I’m going to get extremely drunk and pretend that I pulled a Sadiyah and gave up on my own. Alright?”
With a sigh, Draco admitted to himself that he was going to need a cup of coffee or three if he wanted to get anything more done today. He knew that there was a kitchen somewhere in the office, but decided that a bit of a stretch would do him some good, so he went down to the Costa on the corner. The cold air helped snap him out of his screen-induced stupor, and by the time he’d boarded the elevator with his cappuccino (which he was trying not to acknowledge he had chosen because he was thinking of Harry), he was feeling significantly more himself.
“God, yes,” Ginny and Ron spoke in unison, before turning to glare at one another, causing Harry to snort and Hermione to try to bite back a laugh.
) and roasting it carefully over the fire, keeping it just at the edge of flames and rotating it slowly so that it turned an even golden brown around the outside. Once it was done to her satisfaction, she sandwiched it with a square of chocolate between two halves of one of the biscuits before taking a huge, un-Hermione-like bite, grinning as she licked melted chocolate off her lower lip. “S’mores!”
Harry covered his mouth with a hand to hide his grin. “Pretty buggy out here. We should probably get back.” He turned and began to jog back toward the lights of the party in the distance, ignoring Romilda’s desperate mix of declarations of love and shrieks of disgust as moths continued to flock around her.
When the three of them were settled at the table with breakfast, Harry steeled himself and said: “I need to tell you both something.”
from kayaking that I know of.” Draco still looked unconvinced, so Harry threw in a sweetener that he knew Draco wouldn’t be able to resist. “We could race. Winner picks the prize.” He smirked. “Unless you think you can’t beat me.”
She took a prim bite of her lunch, chewed, and swallowed. “You looked rather happy when you got in, last night, as well.”
“Right.” Draco sighed. Four o’clock Eastern time. No wonder it felt early. As he attempted to wake up at least a little bit, he absently assessed the man standing awkwardly in his doorway. He hadn’t seen Harry Potter since he’d left for New York, and he was rather perturbed to see that the man had grown up to be incredibly fit.
The restaurant was small and intimate, decorated in muted reds and golds and bathed in a warm glow from the woven pendant lights scattered across the ceiling. Harry, as it turned out, had never had Ethiopian cuisine, and was absolutely delighted by the whole experience. They sipped at honey wine and shared a platter of vegetable dishes, Harry commenting on each flavor and teasing Draco about the unlikely image of him eating with his hands.
It was just after 10 PM, and Harry and his friends were making their way through the line into the Red Cap—the newest, supposedly hippest, bar in Wizarding London—for what had promised to be a truly epic Halloween party. They probably could have cut the line, if Harry were honest with himself, but he hated playing the celebrity card, and he was hoping not to draw attention to himself. Well, not for that, anyway. He couldn’t pretend that his black leather jacket and red silk shirt combination wasn’t a bit on the ostentatious side.
“I’m aware.” Draco shook another cigarette loose and lit it before settling his Zippo next to the ashtray. “Look, I’m doing you a favor, here. We’re not suited. Now you can go find someone who is.”
The house was packed but somehow still managed not to feel crowded. From time to time, Draco caught sight of his mother or aunt subtly encouraging people to move from one room to another, skillfully balancing the populations of each space to avoid claustrophobic conditions without ever seeming like they were doing so. Draco was a bit in awe as he watched them work, not just rearranging guests, but directing conversations, pulling those who looked lost into nearby groups and making introductions, refilling wine glasses here and disappearing them there. He sometimes forgot that, despite her later choices, Andromeda had been raised with the same exacting lessons in propriety and social graces as his mother had.
“No, Ginny and Pansy have already shut themselves up in their room,” she said, ignoring the retching noise Ron made, “and Draco’s still feeling a bit carsick, so he’s lying down. I think Blaise might be napping; his door is closed as well.”
“Merlin, stop being such a baby. It’s not like we’re going to show your cock on television; it will be blurred out.”
“I’m sorry.” Now that Draco knew Harry better, he could see how much it bothered him that his fame still got in the way of his life. Giving in to temptation, he reached out and ran his fingers through Harry’s hair. Harry sighed. “So you don’t know when Ron will be able to collect her?”
“Huh? Oh, the Quidditch game. Yeah, I didn’t end up going, actually.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck, not making eye contact. “Wasn’t really in the mood.”
Dinner was lovely. Andromeda and Draco had put together a spaghetti carbonara in addition to the salad and rolls, and it paired very nicely with the wine Harry had contributed. The conversation was largely dominated by Teddy, whose class had begun a new unit on the solar system and who was therefore positively bubbling over with space facts.
He flushed at being caught out, but thankfully managed to bite back his instinctive response that there was certainly nothing that Draco needed to make excuses for. Instead, he cleared his throat. “Um, it should be fine now,” he said, chagrined at how rough his voice came out. “Sorry, I didn’t think to show you how it worked.” He stood there, dripping wet in his clothes, unsure what to do.
“Relax.” Draco smirked. “It’s a designated Apparition point; Muggles can’t see it. Besides, the Gardens are closed. To most people, anyway. But not to us.” He winked at Harry before taking his arm and guiding him down the path.
“Looks okay,” Harry said, surprised, as he studied the perfectly clean toothpick. The muffins seemed to have risen correctly, and they were a lovely golden color across the top. “It’s entirely possible that we didn’t completely muck this up.”
Harry nodded and made a little sound of understanding, still looking out the window. He seemed to be a bit lost in his own head, and Draco wondered if, perhaps, he should leave him to his thoughts. He was feeling unaccountably awkward, more so than he had with Harry for weeks now. “Well,” he said, finally, “I’ll see you tomorrow morning, right?”
With only ten people left, it was easier for people to catch him alone. The first to approach him was Gabrielle, looking nervous but hopeful. He felt a little guilty; the only time he’d even tried to talk to her thus far had been interrupted.
Although Harry was not an enthusiastic dancer when sober, he generally felt loose enough after two or three drinks to participate without the constant fear of abject humiliation. He therefore spent the beginning of the evening lounging against the bar, chatting with whoever felt like joining him and watching his remaining potential partners on the dance floor. Perry had stayed by his side for a while, as had Leela, but it was too loud to talk much and eventually they’d given up and joined the others.
“Mmh,” Harry agreed. “Not particularly keen to kick off my return to England with another scandal, myself.” He nudged his knee against Malfoy’s. “I’d still like to see you, though. Maybe we could just… I dunno, keep it quiet? Spend a bit of time together; see if it’s worth the risk?”
“I remember hearing about that,” Draco said, grinning at the recollection. “Didn’t Chang throw a tantrum and leave you standing in a crowded cafe, gaping like a fish?”
“Yes! And then I’m going to show you my dinosaurs!” Teddy bounced off of him, once again forcing the air from Draco’s lungs. He was going to have to put a locking charm on his door, he decided, if he wanted to avoid any more abrupt wake up calls—especially any more featuring his unfairly attractive ex-rival. In the meantime, he hoped that his mother and Andromeda had enough coffee on hand to get him through the day.
Finding an open seat near where his next Portkey would be departing from, Draco settled himself, pulling his wool hat low to camouflage his distinctive hair and pulled a book from one of his bags to read.
“And cheese,” Pansy added, settling a tray of cheeses, crackers, bread, and fruit on the long table at the middle of the craft. “I can’t eat whilst discussing your weak stomach, so be a dear and shut up.”
Draco looked at his watch. “Well, we have the place for another hour, so we can have a drink or two if you’d like.”
“Could it really have killed me?” Draco mocked, but it didn’t sound like his heart was in it. “Yes, Potter, it could have. I know you’ve always had a death wish, but I’d appreciate it if you didn’t indulge it whilst on my watch—especially for something as stupid as a hot bath.”
Malfoy shifted, letting his leg brush against Harry’s. “It does feel extremely childish after everything we’ve been through.” He paused. “I do have to be somewhat circumspect, though. My welcome in this country is still a bit… tenuous. I can’t really afford to piss off my Captain by openly pursuing something with ‘the enemy’.” His voice went mocking at the end of the statement, but his eyes were serious.
Hermione ruffled his hair as she stood herself. “Don’t be stupid. Of course you do.” Turning to leave, she called back over her shoulder, “By the way, you should go shower. You smell like sex.”
“Which means Ginevra would have known, which means that if Pansy talked to her at all about casting…” His eyes narrowed. “Damn it, Pansy.” He gave Harry an apologetic look. “That was absolutely an intentional drama casting. I’ll make sure we keep an eye on things. Anyone else?”
“Cousin Draco, why do you call Harry ‘Potter’?” Teddy asked as Draco handed him the hedgehog so that he could decide where it belonged on the by-now-overfull tree.
“Hey! Sorry about that, I’m a little behind. Mind keeping me company in the kitchen for a few minutes while I finish up dessert and wash up?”
he would have been doubtful. While he did occasionally stay over at a date’s place, he wasn’t one to linger in the mornings. It wasn’t as though he was dashing out the door in shame, he just... didn’t have much interest in the artificial domesticity of it all. There was an intimacy in this sort of morning that couldn’t be faked or forced, and when it came down to it, he’d never much cared to try.
“I don’t understand why not! You’re handsome, wealthy, successful. It’s not as though you should have trouble attracting a partner.”
“I thought it was time for a change of pace,” Narcissa answered blithely. “Your room is just at the top of the stairs. Once you’ve taken your bags up, come down and have a drink with Andromeda and me. Teddy’s staying over at his godfather’s tonight, but you’ll see him tomorrow.”
Their gazes held for just long enough for Harry’s stomach to do a strange sort of flop, at which point he looked away and attempted to lighten the mood. “Might have gone a bit overboard on the ‘not lonely’ stuff, though. Dating fourteen people at once seems a bit excessive in hindsight. Not sure how I’m going to pull this off, honestly; we’re only one night in, and I’m completely exhausted!”
“I should hope so, as the last time you saw me was at a funeral.” He held her at arms length and gave her a quick once-over of his own: same blunt bob and severe bangs, same pristine red lip, same wicked smirk. “You look exactly the same as always.”
” He paddled back toward the pier and began to pull himself back up while Ginny broke into a new bout of giggles. “It’s just seaweed, you giant baby.”
“I’d take a cappuccino,” he answered, and the elf gave a nod and a bow before popping out of existence.
“Quite alright,” Draco answered, his voice a bit breathy and his face, if possible, even redder. “Stood up too fast. I should’ve been more careful.” He paused, looking like he wasn’t quite sure what to say before finally just adding: “Thank you.”
Draco leaned in and kissed Harry once more, trying not to linger too long and frustrate himself even more. “I suppose that will do,” he agreed resignedly. He forced a smile, pushing Harry back from him slightly. “Now get out of here before my magnanimity runs out and I refuse to let you leave.”
“Whatever,” Draco grumped. He and Harry had been playing this game for over a year now, and the margin was always extremely close. Harry was just barely ahead, at the moment, but Draco would catch up to him soon. He and Parvati had a potions ring bust coming up that Harry and Weasley weren’t involved in. Once that was done, he’d have overtaken him, and the smug expression currently gracing his colleague’s face would disappear along with his lead.
He had meant what he said when he’d told Harry that he didn’t want to ruin the bubble of comfort he was building here with his family, that he didn’t want to make everything worse in the long run. Sitting here now, though, he had the horrible realization that he was likely going to feel the tug of want and the ache of separation no matter what he did. The only way to spare himself would be to purposefully build emotional distance—to keep even their friendship at arm's length. The thought made his stomach churn, and he knew that there was no way he could bring himself to do that.
Sure enough, there was a sting sticking out of a red spot on her arm. Harry winced in sympathy and looked back at their table, where several more bees were now investigating their abandoned cups. “I think there’s a first aid station up near the entrance,” he offered. “Should we head up there? I’m not sure what kind of healing spell you’re supposed to use on stings.”
They relocated, but as they settled in, neither said anything, Perry apparently just as unsure as Harry on how to go about this. They sat in awkward silence for a few moments. “So…” Perry finally started.
They retreated, and as soon as the door was shut behind them, Leela told him, all in one breath, “Look, I really don’t think we should date, and I’m so sorry, this is
“That’s fantastic,” he said, rather than voicing any of those thoughts. “Thank you. I could definitely use some interaction with the outside world.”
“More or less.” Blaise twinkled a wide, white smile at her. “You’ll all be locked inside the room behind that door—” he gestured toward a heavy wooden door to his left “—where you will find an array of furniture, books, art, and other objects. As you explore, you’ll discover a set of puzzles that need to be solved, as well as a number of clues that will help you solve them. Once you’ve completed them all, the room will unlock. If you can finish within the allotted hour, we have a special treat for you tonight. Everyone clear?”
Draco leant his head back against the headboard and sighed, bringing the cigarette back to his mouth and waiting for the sounds of Max’s final departure. It wasn’t long before he heard the squeal of tires as he whipped out of Draco’s driveway in his Bugatti, and Draco let out a breath of relief before summoning his house elf, Clossy.
“Well this is… festive,” he finally said. “Remind me why we’re here and not catching up on our own somewhere?”
Harry shook his head in disbelief. “That is absolutely mental. How the hell does anyone ever find it?”
Harry sat up with a start, putting a hand to his head as he was hit with a wave of dizziness and a sudden headache. “What the… Draco?”
“Buffy the Vampire Slayer!” Harry attempted to explain to him, but his face went even more perplexed.
“Anyway,” Harry asked, addressing Narcissa. “Is Teddy ready? I told him I’d take him into Muggle London today to see some of the Christmas markets and lights and things since he had a half-day at school,” he clarified to Draco.
The look Luna gave him made it clear that she found his question highly amusing, but she answered him, nonetheless. “Your energies have always drawn you to one another. They even pulled you both back to England at the same time. It was inevitable, really, don’t you think?”
She hummed. “We’ve been experimenting with magic-dampeners on some disused outbuildings. Thus far, it seems to have been going well, although there have, of course, been bumps along the way.” She gave a wry smile. “We had an incident with a pocketful of shrunken packages; the student didn’t realize that the dampeners would reverse the charm. Quite a surprise when their robes burst apart at the seams.”
Harry watched him in disbelief. “We aren’t who we were in school, Draco. People change. You, of all people, should know that.”
,” Teddy repeated petulantly. Harry sighed and looked about to say something else when a girl who looked about Teddy’s age yelled his name from the edge of the pond.
“They’re much more interesting than anything I had as a child. And, as you’re well aware, I was a spoiled little shit.”
Shortly before noon, the glass doors slid open, and one of the crew whose name Harry hadn’t caught stuck his head out. “You’re needed,” he said, looking slightly fearful, and Harry winced. That look could only mean that Pansy was displeased, which likely meant that Harry was running behind.
“No, wait!” Draco cut him off, grabbing him by the arms before he could get very far. “That’s not what I meant.” Harry watched him warily. Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath, gripping Harry tightly to make sure he didn’t move. “I do. Mean it. I just didn’t mean to…” He shook his head.
He sighed. “Mother, I know you mean well. And yes, I’m enjoying my time here, with you, and Andromeda, and Teddy… and with Harry. But I’m not interested in uprooting my life. I like New York. I like my job. I’m… content. It’s more than I ever thought I would have.”
“You’re always starving,” Ginny snorted, but she was already leaning around Pansy, stealing a grape and popping it in her mouth. “Ooh, those are fantastic.”
Even Hermione Granger had to run out of steam eventually, however, so when they’d been hiking for close to an hour and reached a small clearing, she didn’t put up a fight as everyone collapsed in various states of exhaustion, sitting on thick fallen tree trunks or dropping flat onto their backs on the ground. Several people began removing layers of clothing, eager to relieve the excessive body heat that had built over the last stretch of their hike, and Harry joined them, pulling his sweat-soaked tee shirt over his head and sighing in relief as a cool breeze caressed his overheated skin. Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Draco watching him, but when he turned his head, he was looking contemplatively up at the canopy of leaves above them.
“Indeed,” Nancy agreed. She finished her glass of water and tried to put her pleasant expression back on. “An easy enough mistake to make, and a good lesson in kitchen organization: always clearly label your ingredients, and always keep them in the same place—that way, you’ll be sure that you’re grabbing the right thing.”
Tonight, in an exciting new episode, Harry gets to see a friend, is pressured into being naked in front of quite a few people, practices unsafe hot tub etiquette, and goes dancing.
impressed, and I can see why. I ended up reaching out to Luna to apologize. She was very gracious about everything, and we got to talking about her art, and one thing led to another, and, well, I ended up hiring her to design the cover for my upcoming album. So, I’d say it was a rough learning curve, but I like to think I’m better for it.”
Draco ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t know. We can’t really pull another contestant in for this date last minute; we let them all go into the Muggle town down the road from the house since they’re each only going to have one day out with you over the next couple weeks. But we already booked the tour and everything.”
Perry gave a wry laugh. “Well, I won’t say it was fun. It’s difficult to realize that someone you think you’re starting to fall for has already fallen for someone else. But I don’t regret any of it. The whole experience was wild, beginning to end, and I’m happy that Harry found the right person for him, even if it wasn’t me. I wish him and Draco all the best.”
“Fuck it, let’s try the tubes. It’s not like I ever got to try them as a kid, and I don’t think my ego can take another wipe out.”
“You’ve got your potion now, though,” Harry pointed out, ignoring the smirk that Pansy shot him. He hadn’t done anything exceptional by buying it; any good friend would have done the same.
“Fine, I won’t.” Draco groaned at her smug smirk. “Be there at eight,” she told him. “It will be fine. You can always hide in a corner with me and Blaise if necessary. Don’t count on Greg, though; he’s dating a former Hufflepuff and you won’t get him away from her side.”
She opened the various ingredients and demonstrated, skewering a marshmallow on one of the long sticks (after giving it a good
Draco shuddered. “Even watching was horrifying. I can’t imagine actually being the victim of whatever that was.”
“Oh,” Hilde said breezily, “William and I had a few lovely conversations before he left, so when the show ended, I thought I would reach out. We met for drinks, and the rest is history.”
ed body on the ground near him; his Stunner’s aim had been true, but the assailant had gotten off one last hex before it hit. He wasn’t in imminent danger—Draco had been hit by the same spell before, and it was extremely painful but didn’t cause any lasting damage once reversed—and although that would be easy enough to do, they didn’t have a wand to spare at the moment.
“Makes sense.” Harry laughed. “Anyway! Bit of a tangent we ended up on, there. I just meant it’s all been pretty crunched. So what else were you talking to your toad friend about?”
He sounded truly bewildered, and Harry laughed, except it was more a sob, really, and—fuck—the tears had started to escape. The salt stung his face. “Because it
Draco let out an amused huff and rested the side of his head in his palm. “Of course you weren’t. Why do I let you talk me into things?”
“You were just as bad, and you know it,” Harry returned, smiling. “Do you want to hear this or not?”
“According to who?” Draco asked, looking genuinely surprised. “I’m around them all day long, and I’ve never heard them talk about anything interesting.”
“Just a date, though,” Potter stated firmly as Draco turned back toward his desk. “This isn’t me signing up for a relationship. One date, just to see how it goes.”
“Now, resist testing your finished product, please; we’re all going to try everyone’s at the end to see how you all did,” Nancy called to them from the front of the room.
“Thanks. It’s fine, though. I’ve got a much nicer life now than I ever expected to.” Harry grinned.  “Also, I’m pretty sure my therapist bought a house off the fees I’ve paid him, so at least I know I’m doing some good for the world with my trauma.”
“Draco, dear, I’ve been telling you for ages that nobody cares about all that anymore. They still held a good deal of animosity toward your father, of course, up until his death, but it is widely understood that neither you nor I had much of a choice once… well.”
Draco gaped for a second before shutting his mouth. He hadn’t, he realized, ever really made a friend. Was this how it happened? When he was a child he had just… been repeatedly thrown together with the same handful of other pureblood children until they’d essentially become friends by default. “Ah,” he finally said. “Well then. Yes. I would like it if we could be friends.”
Before too long, the group had managed to secure themselves drinks—starting with a round of rather suspect-looking neon shots that Ginny had pushed into their hands with a wicked grin. Now, they were cheerfully working their way towards tipsy, chatting with each other and various others who dropped by to comment on their costumes or show off their own.
“A pleasure to meet you,” Blaise said, addressing the cat. He looked over at Luna. “What should I do?”
“Merlin, no. I doubt I could even put together a dinner party without help. Not that I’ve tried. I’ve never done much hosting, to be honest.”
“There’s more than one elf on staff, Harry. Honestly.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Anyway, I suspect Pansy’s concern was less about you and more about the show.” Their breakfast tray appeared on the coffee table, and he claimed his cup, taking a delicate sip. “I think she’s worried you’ll quit.”
They seemed content to mingle with each other, as well, which was nice. Rose and Owen had ended up in the hot tub together, having what seemed to be a fairly intense conversation. In one corner of the pool, Harry could hear Cormac was bragging loudly about his prowess on the field earlier, which no one seemed particularly keen on listening to, but there were still several others with him discussing the game with less grandiosity. Over by the wine table, Sullivan and Leela seemed to still be discussing nutrition. William was off to the side chatting with Hilde, although he looked rather bored. He was wearing a full three piece suit. Harry was somewhat tempted to push him into the pool, just to see what he’d do.
Speaking of Hermione, she was emerging from the nearby trees with an armful of long, thin branches, looking pleased with herself.
“So,” Draco said, mimicking Harry’s movement so that they were facing each other, meeting his eyes. His voice, when he went on, was barely more than a whisper. “Kiss me.”
“Anything you like,” Harry told her. “You can just wander around with me for a bit; I tend to stop by a lot of the different stations and see what the kids are up to and if they need anything before I settle in with anyone. It’s all very casual.”
“Oh. Hey, Draco.” Harry looked up at him, seeming a little lost. He looked hollow behind his eyes, and Draco could feel his eyebrows furrowing in concern. “Yeah, I’ve been…” he trailed off and glanced past Draco, into his office, to where the chalkboard hung prominently on the back wall. He seemed to curl even further in on himself. “I don’t want to count this one, okay?” he said, finally. “It doesn’t really feel like a victory.”
“Really?” Draco was… Draco didn’t know what he was. Surprised? Relieved? Pleased? Disbelieving? Perhaps all of them at once.
Harry watched from backstage as Blaise gestured to two tiered rows of chairs to his right, where eleven people sat and waved at a cheering, clapping audience.
“Hey. No. I’m sure twelve-year-old me would have thought so,” he said, trying to inject some humor to lighten the mood, “but I promise I’m much more aware of the invasiveness of the press, now. It’s why I’ve never bothered having the
When their wine was gone and the movie ended, they went to brush their teeth, Draco grumbling about being emotionally compromised by a stuffed frog. When Harry stepped in front of the mirror, his eyes widened. “What the—”
“Dermot,” Harry called. Dermot stepped up to him and Harry held his gaze for a moment. “I didn’t grow up with a family,” he told him, finally. “My friends are the only family I’ve ever had. They mean everything to me, and I can’t respect anyone who can’t respect them.” Dermot flinched, at least having the grace to look repentant. “Good luck,” Harry told him.
Harry buried his face in Draco’s neck for a moment. “Wouldn’t be so bad,” he mumbled. Taking a deep breath, he sat up. “Right. Bed.” He stood and stretched, stumbling slightly. Draco laughed.
Perry pulled back. Harry blinked his eyes open to see sad, resigned eyes. “You weren’t even there, were you?”
Ginny had also spent a while longer trying to convince him, but to no avail. Harry did not want to gamify his love life for the entertainment of the masses, and no amount of guilt was going to change his mind.
“Thank you, Mother,” he said, ignoring the knowing look she gave him as he moved past here and knelt before the fire. When he saw Harry’s face in the fire, his eyes widened. “Merlin, Harry, you look awful. Is everything okay?”
Draco laughed. “It’s been a long time since Hogwarts, Harry.” He paused before going on. “Feelings about what?” His voice turned teasing. “Are she and Ginevra looking to make it a threesome?”
He wandered up and down the street, peering in windows and hoping that something would catch his eye, but nothing did. His normal go-tos for gifts—books, clothing, nice wine or liquor—all felt impersonal, inadequate. He considered a plant of some sort, something that held a particular meaning, but he hadn’t seen any houseplants in Harry’s flat and didn’t know if he would want the responsibility. He thought about something experiential, maybe something Harry could take Teddy to do or see, but he felt like it would just highlight the fact that he was leaving, that he wouldn’t be there to enjoy whatever it was with them.
“Well. In that case.” Draco set his glass on the counter before snagging Harry‘s belt loops with his fingers, tugging him forward before plucking his glass from his hand, setting it beside his own. “I believe we were in the middle of something when we were so rudely interrupted the other night.” He pulled Harry closer and kissed him.
Kissing Draco was nothing like what Harry would have expected. He’d always imagined that it would be just as competitive as everything else they did, full of teeth and determination. Instead, it felt sure and steady and entirely in unison, as though this, finally, was something that they could completely agree on. When their tongues met, Harry found that Draco tasted of porter, burnt sugar, and chocolate—they must have made s’mores again while he’d been up here searching the sky for answers like a particularly inept centaur. He pushed that thought quickly away in favor of chasing the intoxicating flavors back into Draco’s mouth, losing himself in warmth and wonder.
“Actually,” Harry cut in, clearing his throat as he spoke for the first time since everyone had lost their collective shit. “It’s not going to be a problem.” Draco felt a sudden panic starting to rise. Surely Harry wasn’t breaking up with him already? It had only been a day since he’d said he loved him! But Harry kept speaking, oblivious to Draco’s distress. “I’m not actually going to be an Arrow once the season ends.” Draco let out a breath in relief, but then froze when he realized what Harry was saying.
Draco finished writing a nonsense sentence that had nothing to do with his actual job before looking up. “Hmm?” he answered absently. “Sorry, what was that?”
“I understand,” she said, face unreadable. “I do wish you would have told us you weren’t going to be back, though. We were worried.”
“Would she?” Ron still looked a bit shell shocked at the whole experience; his expression was giving Harry flashbacks to when they met Norberta the Norwegian Ridgeback, and he could help but grin.
A few more people were complete unknowns. A tall, slim blond with an even posher accent than Malfoy’s who introduced himself by his full name—William Williams III—had been striking on first look, but his overconfident air of self-importance had Harry biting his lip not to laugh at him. He didn’t expect him to last particularly long, but tried to withhold judgement; the man could potentially have hidden depths, after all. A gorgeous, lithely muscular black woman called Sadiyah who moved with an almost unnatural grace initially intimidated Harry, but her warm, amused smile and friendly greeting eased his nerves almost immediately. And then there was Sullivan, whom Harry privately thought might be a fitness model, with his perfectly sculpted body, square jaw, and summer-gold skin.
“What the hell is wrong with you?” she hissed, looking even more exasperated with him than usual. “Every time he’s over here, you spend the rest of the day mooning, and he finally asks you out, and you say
“It’s only teasing if you don’t follow through,” Draco managed as Harry’s lips travelled down to his throat. “
“I’m an idiot,” he sighed to himself before digging the thin book out from under his jumbled pile of clothes. Sadly, he hadn’t gotten much better at packing since his Hogwarts days. Tucking the book under his arm, he made his way downstairs.
He didn’t see what happened next. There was a loud crash, a couple of gasps and, above them, a horrified squawk. Unsure if anyone had been hurt, Harry tied his robe hurriedly and joined the group, only to find Dermot standing with his arms outstretched, his face a picture in indignation. His whole right side had been doused in electric blue paint—from his hair down to his shoes. Adding insult to injury, a burst of pink and silver glitter has somehow managed to spill on top of it, leaving a swath of sparkles across his shoulder with lighter dustings of it up his neck and down his arm.
blue. Cobalt is entirely different.” Draco dropped the piece into a pile that looked the exact same color to Harry as the one he’d been going for with an offended huff. Harry snorted.
As though he could hear him from across the room, Draco Malfoy’s head turned and his gaze met Harry’s, expression quickly going from its usual disdain to surprise to a smirk in record time as he took in Harry and then his friends. He nudged someone beside him, tipping his head in their direction, and Harry glanced down to see Pansy Parkinson, dark hair curled to her shoulders, in red leather pants that matched her lacquered lips and a sinfully tight black top, stake in hand. Behind her stood Blaise Zabini in a burgundy velvet suit and orange tie and Gregory Goyle in a long white nightdress and a wig. “Fucking. Hell,” Harry muttered.
Draco waved his hand dismissively. “Don’t be. I was the one to end things. He’d become dreadfully boring. There was no fire. Especially in bed.”
liked him. He was passionate and funny and affectionate and self deprecating in a way that made it obvious that he wasn’t just being modest; he truly didn’t think that he was anything special. To him, his role in the war was mostly incidental, and he hadn’t done much of note since. He clearly had no idea of the magnetic appeal he radiated.
Harry tried to read her expression, but couldn’t parse it. “Sure. Do you want to go into the other room, or…”
He was siphoning the last streaks of blue and black icing from his hair in the mirror when Harry appeared over his shoulder. “You missed a spot,” he said with a grin.
“Oh for—” Draco cut himself off before he swore (he’d gotten more than one lecture from his mother about the language he used in front of Teddy) and let out an exasperated sigh. “I should go deal with that.”
Once home, there was a scramble for the three showers, everyone wanting to rid themselves of the accumulated dirt, sweat, and bug spray. Harry, by virtue of having the Master Suite to himself, was able to claim first go with no trouble. He basked in the multiple streams of water, first cool as he tried to bring his elevated body temperature back down, and then blissfully hot to ease the tightness of his muscles. He sighed happily as the steam billowed around him, luxuriating in the heat. He should get one of these for Grimmauld, he thought absently.
“A fact that you seem to forget that every time I beat you at something but remember when I’ve got something you want.”
Pulling his favorite warm, worn old hoodie over his head, Harry opted not to change out of his soft plaid pajama bottoms and padded downstairs, unsure of the time without the rays of the sun to guide him. The large main room appeared deserted when he reached it, the doors to the two bedrooms still shut, so he thought it must still be fairly early. He lit the fireplace and turned to go make himself a cup of tea only to find Draco fast asleep on one of the sofas facing the windows, curled under a blanket, mouth slightly open and hair disheveled, looking extraordinarily vulnerable.
they didn’t keep leaving dark spots because they went off to flirt with the other lights.” He caught Harry trying to hide an amused grin out of the corner of his eye.
“Look, Draco!” Teddy called at one point when he’d fallen behind again, indicating a stall full of carved wooden toys. “These look like Harry’s!” He pondered for a moment and then added, looking up at his godfather, “Yours are better, though.”
Perry gave Harry a mischievous smirk. “Not surprised you don’t remember me; I seem to recall you being pretty singularly focused on Draco Malfoy, when it came to my team.”
“One night and you’re already replacing my toiletries.” Harry reached out, curling his arms around Draco’s middle and pulling his back flush against his chest before biting his shoulder lightly. “I’m not sure I want to know what else you’ll manage before you head back to New York.”
, he berated himself. He had to get himself together. The last thing he needed was to complicate his holiday with a romantic entanglement—especially with someone who was so deeply entrenched in his family. It could only end badly.
“You okay?” Harry asked, following her in concern as she backed quickly away from the table they’d been seated at.
“The listing said eight to ten,” Harry said, gratefully directing his attention toward his friend. “There are five bedrooms; I think two have pairs of single beds and the other three have doubles.”
Pansy had hired Draco as co-producer as soon as the show had been greenlit, and Harry found himself surprisingly glad to have him there. They’d become friendly enough over the years, and Harry knew from experience that Draco was good at reining Pansy in when her need to be in control started to get out of hand. He’d done an impressive job talking her off a ledge when the flowers for her engagement party hadn’t been the right shade of red, for example.
“Hey, how are you doing?” he asked as they walked to sit by a fountain of two centaurs pouring water out of ewers. Harry imagined Bane seeing it and shuddered.
His own eyes stinging, Draco held him tighter, not even minding when the frames of Harry’s glasses dug into his skin. “It wasn’t on purpose.” He felt raw inside, in both the best and worst ways at once. “I wasn’t certain what I was going to do until today, I swear. I would have told you if I was sure, but I had to sort it out on my own; I couldn’t...” He breathed out heavily, struggling—and failing—to keep his voice steady. “But after you left this morning, I kept thinking about what it would be like to be back in New York without my family. Without you. And this afternoon I just… realized. I can’t go back to that. I can’t give this all up.” He kissed the side of Harry’s head, his familiar curls—lavender scented from the shampoo that Draco had bought him, already in deeper than he was willing to admit—and added, quietly, “I can’t give you up.”
“Thank you, darling,” Blaise said, preening. “It’s immensely flattering that you view me as a threat to your aesthetic.”
The first long, slow thrust burned, and Harry found himself hiding his face against Draco’s shoulder as he tried to adjust. It had been a long time since he’d let anyone do this. Once Draco was fully seated, Harry clung to him tightly, willing him to stay still.
“Hey, come in!” Harry grinned in relief as Draco walked over to him. “I was just thinking about you. I don’t suppose you want to help me finish this sky?”
. Never heard a thing; never saw them on the off days. It was bizarre. Also, turns out it’s still pretty boring waiting outside a closed door in the hopes that something will happen.”
Harry popped his piece into his mouth, excited, only to almost spit it out immediately. “Oh my god,” he choked around his mouthful. Around him, he heard coughing and sputtering, and one man actually did run and spit his out in a rubbish bin. Hasty gulps of water were downed by several people trying to wash the horrifying taste from their mouths. Harry managed to swallow with a pained gulp. He looked helplessly at Perry, whose face was twisted in distaste.
The warm hand returned to his knee and squeezed it before disappearing. “Just… think about what I said. You deserve to be happy, Harry. Even if it’s not with one of us.”
As he wandered, something niggled at the back of Harry’s mind. There was something about the day before that was bothering him, but he couldn’t pinpoint it. He was meandering through a beautiful rose garden when it came to him, stopping him in his tracks.
, without the condescension or sense of humoring him that many adults treated children with. There was something about it that made Draco feel warm inside.
her way before she could teach a room full of kids an exciting new word. Hilde jumped around, holding her foot in her hand and silently swearing up a storm. “Just meet me in the hallway,” he told her tiredly when she finally calmed down enough to stand on both feet and glare at him.
“It feels really weird to be doing this again when I was just here this morning,” Harry told Sadiyah as he pushed open the cabin door. He’d spent a few pleasant hours working on his puzzle with Draco, but eventually, he’d had to get himself ready for this weird moment of prearranged deja vu. The room, as they entered, looked precisely as it had when he and Leela had arrived the night before, right down to the tastefully-set table. “They didn’t change a thing.”
Draco hummed noncommittally and made his way over to Harry, leaning on the counter next to him. “That’s not domestic, it’s practical. Also, this robe is truly hideous.”
Things were much less awkward after that, although at first Draco could still feel himself flushing when he accidentally brushed against Harry, and he caught the other man looking quickly away from him several times. As the evening wore on, however, the discomfort faded. Andromeda suggested a hot cocoa break, and by the time the beverages were gone, they had managed to slip into a surprisingly friendly rapport.
Creevey’s face fell. “I thought you’d just wrapped up the investigation for that counterfeit Galleons piece. Don’t you usually take a bit of a break before starting another?”
Shaking his head in disbelief at just how little vetting Pansy had clearly done regarding the contestants she’d approved, Harry flipped through his wardrobe, eventually selecting a casual dark red button up and a pair of slim cut grey jeans. He paired them with his all-black Converse, knowing that Pansy would disapprove, but figuring that Jack would be in their usual leather jacket/tee shirt/boots combo and not wanting to seem overdressed in comparison.
Blaise released the wheel for a moment to give Luna a one-armed hug. “I’m sure he’s perfectly alright, love.”
As they neared their destination, they veered off of the crowded highway onto a series of emptier country roads, which eventually led to a rough dirt lane that Harry might have missed if it weren’t for the built-in GPS.
“Well, we wanted to let you tell us in your own time,” she said, the unspoken ‘obviously’ perfectly audible in her tone.
Harry tried to hide a laugh as he accepted a slice of pizza from Hermione and a glass of wine from Ron before claiming the seat next to Draco, nudging his sprawled legs with a knee to make room. He took an eager bite of his pizza and then paused, chewing slowly, trying to figure out just what he was tasting. Wrinkling his brow, he dropped his voice in case Greg was on his way back out. “Er… does something about this taste a little… off, to anyone else?”
He showed up at Harry’s flat promptly at seven and was proud of himself for managing not to drool when he saw Harry in his fitted button down, which featured a black and green botanical print that made his eyes pop even more than usual and which he wore untucked over a pair of slim-cut black jeans, paired with a pair of shiny black chelsea boots. The print of the shirt made Draco smile to himself once his brain started working again; Harry had no way of knowing how appropriate his choice was.
Soon, however, he forced himself to relinquish his private oasis, unable to bring himself to make eight people share two showers—especially since the other two were nowhere near as nice as his. When he’d toweled himself off and slipped on a fresh pair of jeans and a tee shirt, he poked his head out the door to see Draco leaning sullenly against the wall next to the other upstairs bathroom, a towel draped over his arm.
When Draco answered, Harry curled further in on himself, hating how distressed he sounded. “I don’t… Harry,
Draco heaved a dramatic sigh. “I suppose I’ll still love you, even if you aren’t able to come swoon over my prowess on a broom.”
They were surrounded by huge spruce and fir trees, dappled light filtering through to leave patterns of gold across the lane. The road was rocky and uneven, forcing Harry to slow the car to almost a crawl for the final stretch, but the pace only made the eventual view of their temporary residence even more dramatic. As they took their final turn onto a long, curved dirt driveway, he could feel a grin spreading across his face.
Luna held the arm up in front of her face and smiled. “I do rather like this shade. Perhaps I’ll keep it.”
Harry had very minimal experience with boats, but he was aware enough of how they generally worked to find the Floaterboat mildly disconcerting. Despite its speed, it had no motor, and therefore made no noise other than the
Dancing with Sullivan was a different experience entirely to the others. His muscular body all but enveloped Harry, holding him close and grinding them against each other, stealing his breath and capacity for speech. Harry let his hands roam up Sullivans solid arms to his shoulders, marveling at the strength he could feel there. Harry knew he wasn’t a large man, by any means, but he’d never considered himself particularly
Harry was grinning now, too, the buzzing energy of their win almost visibly coursing through him. He beamed at Draco, and he looked so fucking beautiful, even though he was just as dirty and dishevled as Draco was, that Draco couldn’t help but glance, just for a second, at those lips that he’d surreptitiously observed for so long as they stretched wide with joy. When he snapped his eyes back up, however, it was clear that Harry had seen, because the smile had morphed into something that Draco couldn’t put a name to, and his eyes were searching Draco’s for something. And then—
Harry took Draco’s hand in his, looking at him. Draco’s snarky, media-ready veneer dropped as their gazes met, and what Harry could see in those silvery eyes made his heart stutter. Clearing his throat, he managed to look back at Blaise, who was watching them with a genuine fondness.
Harry rolled his eyes, but resisted the urge to snark back. “Yeah, it’s been good. A bit difficult, since we were supposed to keep things secret from almost everyone, but worth it.”
It was the warm feeling in his chest when he watched Harry with Teddy. It was the smile that he couldn’t seem to hold back every time he saw Harry’s face. It was the sweetness of falling asleep together and the comfort of a lazy morning after. It was the not wanting to part ways no matter how many hours they’d spent together. It was the sharp pain in his gut when he thought about saying goodbye. It was...
but she cut him off. “Now. Can you please explain for what reason you’re being so petulant about this?”
“Er, hi…” Harry greeted them, looking from one to the other suspiciously. “I just wanted to check if I’m alright to head to bed.”
Draco had approached Potter without ever making a conscious decision, and the grin that he’d been greeted with had sealed his fate before he even knew what was happening. His teenaged fascination, banked to embers over the years, had flared back to life almost instantaneously. Potter had seemed just as interested. Their banter had flown effortlessly, and the air between them had felt electric. The flirtatiousness of it had been unmistakable, and by the time that Weasley had dragged Harry away, Draco had felt lighter than air and also more than a little turned on.
Harry took his time chatting with various people, enjoying the luxury of not having to rush so much. He had just parted ways with Hilde after a very interesting conversation about the differences between magical and Muggle theater (neither of which Harry had much experience with, he’d admitted) when Rose and Owen approached him. He hadn’t seen much of them that evening, he realized, and they looked… well, nervous.
Despite himself, Harry found that he wanted to explain further. “War stuff, mostly. There was this incident with a sort of maze of random shit during the final battle. But also the Triwizard tournament.”
She headed toward where the side of the boat would open out, but Pansy wrapped an arm around her waist and held her back. “Wait until we’ve actually stopped, you absolute lunatic.”
Harry grinned mischievously. “So can I take you out again soon, maybe? On, like, an actual date where we both admit that’s what it is ahead of time?”
“At least you got one good thing out of today,” Draco said, and his amused tone was enough to make Harry look up.
“Yeah, right, I get that.” They walked on, but Harry couldn’t let it go. “But I’m asking, right? So it’s not like you’re just trash talking for the sake of it. It’s just that you all see so much more of each other than I see of you. If there are red flags, it would really help to know.”
Harry’s eyebrows rose in amusement. “So stalking seemed like the most reasonable choice. Got it. And you didn’t figure anything out at all?”
the smirk that accompanied the statement, and he found himself, much to his own surprise, grinning. “Malfoy.” He looked the man over. He wore a slim-fitting grey suit just a shade darker than his eyes, making them pop. His hair was pulled back in a low bun, showing off a handful of small silver hoops and studs along his earlobes and cartilage.
Draco gaped at him. Pansy, meanwhile, was observing them, looking deeply entertained. “I can’t believe you didn’t know he was queer; that’s absolutely priceless,” she said, sounding positively gleeful. “You really don’t keep up with the news at all, do you? He came out as bisexual
Draco looked a bit green as he clambered out of the SUV, but he managed a lopsided smile nonetheless. “Alright, Potter, you win. It’s not a cabin.”
The door opened slowly, and Draco stood on the threshold, looking uncertain. “Hi,” he said. “May I come in?”
Jack smirked. “Oh, I can take a lot more than that,” they answered, and Harry could immediately feel his cheeks heating. Jack’s handsome face was mere inches away, and Harry had the ridiculous thought that they could probably feel his blush. He cleared his throat.
“Riiiight.” Harry was only half listening, thinking instead of whether it was too early to go looking for a third drink.
The song was sweet and mellow, and Dermot’s voice was smooth and warm. Harry had expected to be uncomfortable, but he found himself rather charmed, instead. When the song finally wrapped with a final repetition of
“I’ve got tickets for the Puddlemere game on Saturday, actually. Ron was supposed to come, but something came up, so I’m trying to find someone else who might want to go. It would be a shame for the ticket to go to waste.” Harry was biting his lip and looking hopeful, and for just a moment, Draco thought— but no.
“Okay,” Harry told her, wishing he could make this easier but knowing he couldn’t. “If you need anything, come find me, okay? Or cross your fingers behind your back.” Lowering his voice, he told her “That’s what the crew has me do if I’m in need of rescuing. Don’t tell anyone.”
“Hey,” he said quietly when they were sufficiently far from the sleeping child. “Thanks for coming over. I’m sorry about this.”
,” Harry interjected, frustrated. “He hates having to be nice for too long. Taking his annoyance out on people who were being shitty was a harmless way for him to be… well… kind of a dick, but still.”
Despite his best attempts, Draco had not managed to escape his mother’s machinations for her perfect Christmas Eve/housewarming party, and he was now facing the idea of spending the rest of his ‘holiday’ hand-lettering invitations and dealing with temperamental fairy labor unions to arrange lighting for the night of the event. And that wasn’t even getting into the food preparation, which he was positive was going to be a complete disaster.
In some part of his mind, Harry had assumed that his natural ability to balance on things like brooms and hippogryphs and thestrals would translate into being able to balance on water skis.
Harry found himself surprised into a huff of laughter. “Yeah, well. I’d say ‘his loss,’ but I’m the one who fled the country to get away from the drama, so I don’t actually know if I got the better end of the deal. Still, I’m well shot of him.” He smirked a bit. “Aside from being a cheating arsehole, he was kind of boring to talk to and, to be honest, less than exciting in bed.”
“No one here appreciates my exquisite taste,” Draco pouted, flopping onto the middle of an unoccupied sofa and crossing his arms petulantly.
Draco looked around curiously as he followed, talking in the space. It was nothing like he would have expected a week ago, but for the Harry he was just beginning to get to know, it seemed just right. It was bright and cheerful, scattered with plants and art and photos of friends and family. The furniture was simple but sleek and comfortable looking, and a guitar was leaning in one corner.
Draco bit his lip, but nodded in resignation. It wasn’t as though he would be able to help it, now that it had been said. “Fine. I promise I’ll think about it.” He drained his wine and looked down at the empty glass morosely. Then a thought occurred to him, and he perked up. “We still need to go choose wine and liquor, don’t we?”
Harry’s smile was wide and genuine and made Draco want to kick the version of himself who had set those boundaries. Hard. In the shin. “Are you free tomorrow?”
Harry did his very best not to laugh and offend Dilly any more than he obviously already had by daring to have a bit of a lie in. “I would appreciate that. Thanks very much, Dilly.”
“Now! Let’s hear from the rest of you. What have you been up to since you left the Bachelor mansion? How do you feel about how everything played out? Leela, let's start with you. When you bowed out of the final three, you and Harry agreed to stay friends. Has that happened?”
A few of the little group made various sounds of affirmation, but most had already lost interest and were trying to pull Harry’s attention in several other directions at once.
“Hmm. A criminal of some kind, then?” Draco’s eyes twinkled as he leaned forward conspiratorially in his chair.
Some of the humor left her face for a moment. “Yeah, I didn’t think so.” Her expression turned teasing again. “Too much of a gentleman for that, right?”
Harry smiled, eyes still closed. “The Three Broomsticks had actually started doing Floo order, if you’re okay with pub food. Their fish and chips would be heaven right now.”
“I know you have. And you should be proud of all that you’ve accomplished. But being proud isn’t the same as being happy.”
“Take some time to think about your future. Not just next year, or even five years from now—your whole future. And ask yourself, are you going to be content with your current life forever? Or are you, some day, going to want something more?”
“Lucky for you,” she told him, handing another skewer over, but she was smiling in a way that made Harry very sure that she knew exactly what had just happened and was more than a little entertained by it.
Harry laughed wryly. “You’re not wrong. But my family can be very persuasive when they want to be, and it’s not like my dating life has ever been particularly private, has it?”
“Ah, yes, Ophelia Ogden,” the tour guide commented cheerfully when he saw that Harry had stopped. “She was a spitfire, that one. She formulated the Extra Bold line of firewhiskies, which were very popular in the mid 19th century. Discontinued after one too many lawsuits, sadly; they had a tendency to cause a bit of flame-coughing in consumers without a strong enough constitution.”
“Yes, I’ve been working in America for several years now. I’m afraid that I don’t make it back very frequently.”
“Yes,” Draco replied nonsensically. He turned his head to reach for Harry’s mouth, but couldn’t quite find the angle. He made a dissatisfied little sound, and Harry, apparently realizing what he wanted, kissed his shoulder once more before pulling out and rearranging Draco on his back, settling between his legs.
Harry did pull off this time, grinning mischievously. “It’s only teasing if you don’t follow through,” he quoted, and Draco groaned, throwing an arm across his face, covering his eyes. Still, Harry apparently decided to take mercy, because the next thing he said was “There’s lube in the bedside drawer, toss it down here, will you?” Draco turned halfway onto his side, fumbling until he got the drawer open and found a small bottle, which he chucked at Harry’s head rather harder than he intended to before flopping back down. Harry caught it with seeker-fast reflexes and laughed as he popped open the lid.
Draco’s eyes fell closed, and he allowed himself to melt into it, letting his mouth fall open under Harry’s and wrapping his arms around him to pull him closer. He poured everything he had into it, trying to tell Harry without words everything that he wasn’t quite yet ready to say. Harry’s lips were salty with tears, and Draco kissed them away, wanting to take back all the hurt, to mend every little broken piece. He kissed Harry until he couldn’t breathe, and then a bit more for good measure, before he pulled back, resting their foreheads together.
Harry grinned triumphantly. “All you had to do was ask,” he said, and Draco chucked a pillow at him. Laughing, he stood, removing his jeans and pants before moving up Draco’s body until they were face to face. “Hey there,” he said.
Harry’s jaw dropped. Ron slapped a hand over Ginny’s eyes in horror. Hermione blushed, Ginny pushed Ron’s hand off and cackled, Pansy and Greg rolled their eyes, and Draco glared at Blaise as though he had been personally wronged. Luna seemed completely unconcerned.
Harry was seated, slumping, at the table at the far end of the room. He had a half-formed carving of what looked like it was going to be a niffler in front of him, but he wasn’t working on it; his elbows were on the table and he was turning it absently in his hands. He didn’t look up at the sound of the door.
“You just need to remember to keep the tips of your skis pointed inward,” Sullivan told him, encouragingly.
“Oh dear!” Nancy fretted, twisting her hands in front of herself. “You can all go! I’m so sorry!” she called, and, not needing any further assurance, everyone bolted for the doors, sliding on the wet floor. Harry and Perry darted for the hall, where they stood with the rest of the group, gasping for air. Nancy rushed past them all, muttering to herself distractedly. “...must call maintenance… something wrong with the system… I swear there wasn’t even a bit of smoke…”
Harry looked on blankly. “What?” He couldn’t quite comprehend what he was hearing. He focused his attention on Nathalie. “I thought you worked in Muggle relations.”
“You’re staying?” Harry interrupted, looking shocked. He reached up and removed Draco’s hand from his hair, gripping it tightly, almost hurting Draco’s fingers with the strength of it. His eyes searched Draco’s, obviously not quite believing what he was hearing. “Draco, are you telling me you’re staying?”
Despite their undeniable chemistry, they hadn’t slept together. They were both content to let the simmering tension build, respecting an unspoken acknowledgement that nothing between them had ever been—nor could ever be—casual. Better to take the time to see how they fit and if the many complications they would face as a couple, if they decided to do this properly, would be worth it.
“Hmm?” Draco asked, looking at the piece for a moment before closing it in his fist. “Oh, I don’t know. Some stupid reason, I’m sure. Why aren’t you at the cabin? Did something happen?” His expression turned concerned.
As Draco lost himself in a long, blissful kiss, he just barely registered his mother’s voice in the background. “Well. I suppose that’s decided, then.”
“Alright everyone, please return to your work stations to clean up. We have bags at the front so that you can take the rest of your muffins home.” She glanced at Harry and Perry’s once more and grimaced. “If you’d like to, anyway.”
Draco watched as Harry allowed himself to be dragged around haphazardly, laughing and chatting with Teddy about everything that drew the child’s attention. They looked so happy together. Teddy’s hair was currently the messy black mop it had been when Draco first saw him, giving the two a distinctly familial resemblance, and he clung tightly to Harry with one hand, waving animatedly with the other as he spoke. Harry listened to him intently and grinned regularly, obviously delighted to be here, sharing this with his godson. Draco tried to stay a few paces behind them, letting them enjoy their time together, but every time he dropped back for more than a couple minutes, one or the other would draw him into the conversation, clearly trying to ensure that he was included.
“Yeah, fine. It’s been a weird couple of days, but… well, it's been a weird few weeks, actually, so I guess it’s nothing all that different, is it?”
Draco had not done much in the way of sledding as a child. It was a bit boring to do on one’s own, which was how he spent the majority of his winter holidays, especially because the land around the Manor was almost entirely flat. What little he
“I—” His eyes traced Draco’s face—pale, furrowed brows over expressive grey eyes; high, fine cheekbones and porcelain skin, still slightly flushed; thin pink lips a worried line. Harry’s gaze lingered on them for a moment before he looked back up into Draco’s eyes. “I’m going to try something, and you’re going to tell me if it feels right to you. Okay?”
The next morning, Pansy dropped by Harry’s room with a last minute change to the basic guidelines of the contest. In a brisk, businesslike manner, she told him that she and Draco had talked, and they’d decided that it didn’t make sense to force him to keep Perry, today’s date, just because Jack didn’t show up. Rather than sticking with the pairs eliminations, they were just going to give him a day off in between every date and then have one ceremony where he would eliminate two more people at the end.
At Perry’s name, Draco’s face took an interesting and rapid journey from shocked, to sheepish, to smug. “And what do I owe dear Peregrine, then?”
“You sure?” Harry sounded wrecked already, but continued to move his fingers, brushing teasingly against the sensitive nub as he loosened Draco further.
Glancing around, Draco saw that the room was rather crowded: in addition to Luna, half of his team was present, as were his parents. “How long was I out?” he wondered aloud, shuffling about until he was sitting upright.
When a prim young elf in an immaculate uniform popped into the room, Harry greeted her with a smile. “Good morning.”
When Harry woke up a few hours later, he was feeling distinctly less disoriented. In fact, he was finally lucid enough to remember the house guide that his swap-mates had sent and which was buried somewhere in his bag. The house guide that, conveniently, laid out all of the information he hadn’t been able to remember in enough detail to share with his friends.
Harry bit back a smile. “Alas, a centuries-old Quidditch rivalry has spoiled all my carefully laid plans of seduction.”
Harry gave a tight half smile. “Yeah. I, erm. I’ve been...ahem.” He cleared his throat awkwardly. “I, well. I was with Draco. Malfoy. I’ve… we’ve been sort of seeing each other? Since the gala?” The pair stayed silent, and he babbled on. “And I’m kind of in love with him actually, and we didn’t want to tell anyone in case it didn’t work out because everyone would have been in our business, and we didn’t want to cause a huge media mess, especially with the whole team rivalry thing, and I should’ve told you sooner, I know, but we wanted to be sure and I—”
That seemed to be enough for Blaise, because he nodded sagely and then moved on to his next question. “Are you looking forward to tomorrow’s group date?”
Perry sat back down. “We all heard that fight, you know. There was a window open. That was when I really started to believe all the rumors.”
“I packed sandwiches and energy bars in Greg’s satchel,” Hermione told them, “so take whatever you’d like.”
“Hey. Draco.” There’s still laughter in his voice as he wraps his boyfriend up in a tight hug. Draco’s shaking, he realizes, and he holds him tighter, rocking them a little, sobering. “I know. It’s fine.”
“The pizza tastes like Floo powder,” Luna told him, “and everyone is blaming Ron. I don’t mind it,” she added. “It makes it more unique.”
“Er, good morning?” Harry tried. Now that Draco was awake, he was petrified at the idea of standing and drawing attention to the... situation... happening below his waist. He tried to think of the least sexy things he could imagine, but found it rather difficult to concentrate with a sleep-rumpled Draco Malfoy
When he didn’t go on, Harry searched his face—the tightly closed eyes, the furrowed brow, the flush spreading across his pale cheeks. “Didn’t mean to… say it?” he asked, feeling shaky and trying to figure out where in the hell his internal organs had gotten to now. This whole day had been a hell of an emotional rollercoaster, and the faint hope he felt rising again was terrifying.
Harry cleared his throat and tried to smile. He’d been extensively coached on how he was expected to behave, and he was fairly certain that Pansy would throttle him if he messed it up, cameras or no. “Yeah, definitely. It’s all a bit surreal, honestly. But I’m excited to meet everyone.”
Nathalie gave him a sympathetic smile. “I’ll bet. What made you decide to put yourself through this? From the way you usually talk in public appearances, it doesn’t seem like your particular cup of tea.”
Twisting her right arm inward, Leela looked down at it and hissed through her teeth. “One of those little fuckers stung me,” she grumbled.
Sounds of enjoyment came from around the circle as people assembled and sampled their treats. A deep, content hum emanated from next to him, and Harry turned to see Draco sucking melted chocolate off of his fingers, eyes half-closed in apparent bliss.
Draco thought back on his two recent trips and had to agree; the streets and stores had been absolutely packed. “Alright. We’ll just keep our voices down for now, then. Would you like me to get us some food? I could go pick something up. Or do you have somewhere you like that takes Floo orders?”
The trio traded quick updates on their lives; Draco had managed to keep up a semi-frequent correspondence with each of them, so in reality, there wasn’t that much to update one another on. Draco finished his martini and ordered another, hoping that by catching up to the others, he’d feel slightly less out of place.
Draco was now trying very hard to focus on anything other than the pressure of Harry’s warm, firm body against him and wondering despairingly just how small those alleged four people were. Harry had explained to Draco that—as he was the tallest of the group—it would be best for him to take the back seat, his legs spread out to accommodate Harry, who in turn bracketed Teddy. Draco’s arms were wrapped around them both, joining Teddy’s on the string that would supposedly help them direct the sled, sandwiching them all even closer together. It was, in his opinion, a very, very tight fit.
The mudroom seemed dim after the bright sunlight, but to his right, Harry could make out a tall, lean figure in the games room. As Hermione headed upstairs, he rerouted himself, leaning against the doorway. “Hey Draco. Feeling any better?”
“I’m sorry, mate, but Verona won’t make any exceptions, not even for you. You’re suspended for the rest of the season. You and Smith, both.”
It felt… nice. Pleasant. A little strange, maybe, to be kissing someone so calculatedly. He wasn’t sure he’d ever paid such close attention to a kiss before. But it wasn’t
Draco is the one to instigate the hug, now, pulling Harry in gently and resting his own head atop his. “Well, you’ve no shortage of family.”
Draco’s face went stormy for a moment before he schooled it back into something more neutral. “Do people know about this?” he asked, sounding carefully casual.
“That would be lovely, thank you.” She gave him a brilliant smile, and Harry felt a twinge of sadness. She really was lovely, and it was easy to talk to her, but he constantly found himself thinking of her as Fleur’s baby sister rather than as a romantic prospect. Determined to at least try, he grabbed them another drink before sitting back down next to her.
He could not, in fact, do this, Draco thought morosely as he drifted back to consciousness. He’d woken up sweaty and turned on, having dreamed of hot skin over firm muscles, dextrous fingers, burning green eyes, and wild hair turned wilder through far-from-friendly-activities. Well, not
Hilde turned to him, eyes blazing. “Nathalie’s a conniving little liar, that’s what’s going on.” She brandished the camera at him. “She’s a reporter.”
As Draco launched into an explanation of the variations between Muggle and magical pool, Harry found himself zoning out a bit, watching his expressive hand and arm motions. Malfoy was such an animated talker, he thought. He always had been, of course, but now that it wasn’t part of malicious reenactments of Harry’s worst moments, he’d developed a great appreciation for it. There was something captivating about his energy, about the way his long fingers gestured to illustrate his words, almost drawing pictures in the air. His face lit up when he was explaining something, aglow with the pleasure of sharing his expertise. It was beautiful to watch, even if it did sometimes send Harry’s mind spiraling into thoughts of what those hands would be like in other situations. Especially now, when he was fondling that damnable pool cue. Fucking hell, did he even
“Should I try to dance like you?” she yelled back. Before Harry could answer, she altered her movements into an awkward sort of shuffling dance that had Harry laughing so hard his stomach hurt.
“This kid is almost as dramatic as you were when I met you,” Harry observed a bit later with a mischievous smirk.
After watching with crossed arms while Draco stood and went to pull his bathrobe (which was thick and velvety and very much not tartan) out of the wardrobe, he grabbed his hand and pulled him toward the stairs.
? It was bad enough to have a shitty love life off camera, but what if he walked out of here alone while hundreds or even thousands of people watched? What if he was alone forever? What if he was completely unlovable?
to be here to watch this place burn to the ground’.” He smiles, thinking fondly of his godfather as he looks around at the ash and brick and empty space. “He would have thought this was hilarious, honestly. He hated it, too. He hated it
The crowd exploded with screams and whistles as Perry took the stage, waving at the audience as he crossed to Blaise. “WE LOVE YOU PERRY!” a group of witches called loudly from the back of the room, making the already sheepish-looking Perry blush. He was wearing an open blazer over a tee shirt and dark washed jeans, and his hair had been cut short, curling stylishly around his ears and over his forehead.
Draco gave an involuntary snort of amused disbelief, giving away his game and earning him a glare from Potter. Draco thought he should be grateful, really, as the sound had drawn Creevey’s attention away from him and to Draco, his smile returning.
When dessert was done, the dishes cleared away, and Teddy sent to do his homework (pouting and dragging his feet all the way), Harry pulled Draco aside. “Hey, so I’ve been thinking about what we talked about on Sunday,” he said without preamble.
“Fiiiiiine.” Pansy’s capitulation sounded like Ginny, and Harry’s entertainment at the fact helped him relax a bit. “Just let us know if you start focusing on anyone in particular, alright?”
There was a tray of steaming iced cinnamon rolls, along with a full carafe of coffee, waiting on the island, and Draco put two of the rolls on a plate before filling a mug and heading to the living room. Andromeda and Narcissa were already settled in the two squashy armchairs nearest the tree, so Draco curled up on a corner of the sofa, settling his plate on his knee. Teddy was cross-legged on the floor, fidgeting impatiently and ignoring his own cinnamon roll in favor of staring longingly at the pile of wrapped gifts under the tree.
“A shame you didn’t go into potions, of course, you were always an excellent student—” Draco tried his very hardest not to snort and just managed it “—but I’ve heard wonderful things about them, wonderful things. A new age in wizarding finance, they say. Marvelous. Marvelous.”
“Move this leg up a bit,” he directed, and Draco did, opening himself so that Harry could push inside. It was easier than the first few times—Draco’s body more used to the intrusion now—but still intense. He closed his eyes and let himself feel every millimeter of Harry’s slow slide into him, every nerve ending sparking as he was stretched wide.
“Me too,” Perry told him. “I wasn’t really sure about this whole thing at first, honestly; it’s a pretty strange experience, you know? But I really like spending time with you.” He shoulder bumped Harry again, leaning against him for a moment longer than before but not pushing for any more contact than that, which Harry was oddly pleased by. “I hope I get a chance to get to know you better.”
Teddy had, apparently, learned to skate the year prior and took off across the ice as soon as his boots were laced. Laughing, Harry followed him at a more hesitant pace. He had confessed to Draco that he had only been skating a handful of times and was, therefore, a bit awkward at it. “Mostly I can just go in a circle,” he’d admitted, looking embarrassed.
“Sounds good.” Harry squeezes his hand, and they start moving gingerly toward the edge of the property, stepping around small mounds of ash. “I love you, you know. You complete maniac.”
Sure enough, Draco turned to glare at him over his shoulder as he waved his wand above his hand. “You bite your tongue.”
Despite his suspicions, the open declaration made Draco go warm all over. He remembered, for a moment, his own words from earlier in the evening. “You can’t control your feelings, so you might as well enjoy them,” he murmured under his breath, smiling wryly. Fuck it.
“Teddy,” Harry said softly, taking the boy’s hand, “Draco can’t stay with us, he has a very important job back in New York.”
His mother’s words—her plea that he at least think about the future—followed him constantly. Was ‘content’ enough for him? Would it always be enough? But he wasn’t sure he was ready to think about ‘always’ just yet. Especially when, despite his thoughts on family and friends and community, he was afraid that his reasoning might be clouded by his feelings for Harry.
“Draco, dear, you know you’re not getting any younger. I’d already been married several years and had you by the time I was your age.”
Draco groaned. “Please tell me that you aren’t including Teddy in your division of labor, Mother. He’s
“Okay. Love you, Teddy. Goodnight.” Harry leaned over and kissed his brow, reminding Draco of how he’d sent Harry off to sleep the night before. It was an almost unbearably sweet scene, and Draco wanted to kiss Harry breathless.
Draco glared. “I live in New York City, Potter. I spend almost no time in wizarding areas. I am perfectly capable of functioning in Muggle cities.”
“I’m going to murder you,” Draco answered. Harry smirked and kissed him before lining himself up and finally, finally pushing in.
They said their goodnights and walked off. Harry looked around for Pansy or Draco and saw Pansy in a corner chatting with Blaise. When they saw him headed over, they stopped abruptly.
“Merlin, don’t startle a man with a knife in his hand!” Draco berated, midway through slicing a lemon in half. Looking over his shoulder, he saw that Harry had joined them in the kitchen and was leaning on the counter behind him. He turned back to the task at hand. “And of course I know how to cook; I live alone. How did you think I fed myself?”
A while later, when they had parted ways, Sullivan caught Harry’s attention from where he was standing on a footbridge over a large, decorative koi pond and waved him over.
“Merlin, yes.” Ron’s voice came from the floor in front of the fireplace, where he was flopped on his back, looking exhausted. “Canoeing takes a lot of energy.”
Ron grinned even more widely. “Yup! Starting with the season kickoff gala and presser tomorrow. Which you
Draco tried to orient himself in time. “Ten days, I think? I have a portkey booked on Boxing Day.” It was strange to think that he’d already been here over two weeks. It felt simultaneously like he’d just arrived and like he’d been here forever.
Ron wrinkled his nose. “Great, he was sexy when he was being someone else. Why couldn’t I at least have been Vamp Xander?”
The next day at work, Draco didn’t so much ask Harry to go out again as tell him that they’d be having dinner the next night. Luckily, Harry didn’t have any plans, and he seemed more amused than anything at Draco’s superior attitude. Ignoring the way he was obviously biting back a smile, Draco told Harry he would pick him up at seven. He refused to tell him where they were going—partially because he knew that Harry loved being surprised, and partially because he was still ironing out the details.
Harry let out a surprised laugh. “I don’t know why, but I expected you to play a bit harder to get than this.”
“Right. I’ll let you get back to it.” He stepped back out of the shower, thankfully remembering to grab a dry towel on his way out of the bathroom. Trailing water behind him, he stumbled out the door and slid it shut behind him, closing his eyes. This day, he decided, was trying to kill him.
Harry did, each sip helping him feel a bit less woozy, although his head was still throbbing. “Thanks.” They sat in silence for a bit, Draco’s breathing heavy. Finally, Harry asked, “Why were you looking for me?” Now that he was more alert, he could see that it wasn’t all that late, so it couldn’t be time for him to get ready yet.
“I just want you to know that— wow, this is way more awkward than I thought it would be! Okay. I want you to know that even though I’m the last person here, you’re not obligated to pick me. I don’t care what the producers want you to do, or what the deal was when you signed up. Because I do actually really like you, Harry, and I think that we might actually be good together—but I don’t want to be your consolation prize.”
Draco huffed at Harry’s silence. “Your bed is huge. I’m sleeping in here. Move over.” Despite his tone, he lingered at the edge of the bed. When Harry still didn’t respond, he added, sounding uncertain, “Unless you’d rather I slept on the couch, of course.”
Perry gave a quiet, fond laugh. “Yeah, alright. But first…” cupping a hand behind Harry’s neck, he leaned in and kissed him. Harry barely had time to think that his lips were pleasantly hot compared to his own cold skin before it was over. “Sorry,” Perry said as he pulled back, smiling slightly, “you’re just kind of adorable soaking wet and flustered.”
cameras” he winked “—before Harry makes his final choice.” The glasses floated over to each of them. “To being one step closer to ‘happily ever after’. Cheers!”
“I mean, not really,” Harry said with an odd sense of deja vu. “But he knows all about Wizarding genealogy, so he had a better idea of where to start than me or Hermione did. He showed us a bunch of books from their family library, and it turns out that the Potters were black and my grandmother was Indian. I sort of wondered for a bit if I might still have family there, but her family had been in England for a few generations by the time she was born, so it seems unlikely.”
of the water they displaced. It also moved remarkably smoothly, the wind and changing scenery the only indicators of how quickly they were going.
“Not too early, please. We don’t want to put all the good material right up front; we have to make the audience work for it.” Draco winked, and Harry snorted, the teasing helping him relax a bit.
“Goodnight.” Harry made his way up to his room, brushing his teeth, stepping into the shower, and absolutely not thinking about the feel of Draco’s flushed, slick skin under his hands.
Looking over, Harry saw that—sure enough—there was some sort of deep red cocktail being served in a realistic-looking blood bag. He laughed. “Guess I know what I’m drinking tonight.”
“Definitely. We can do groceries tomorrow. The house book says they left us some coffee and pastries for tomorrow morning, so we’re okay for breakfast.”
. And Draco... Draco wanted passion. He wanted intensity. He wanted someone who would challenge him, question him, make him work for it. He wanted chemistry so intense that casual touches left goosebumps and sex was something he craved, not just something he used for a quick endorphin boost. He wanted
Draco sucked Harry’s earlobe briefly into his mouth, biting down before releasing it, making Harry hiss. “Oh, I’m not, as a rule. But I can be very,
“Everything alright?” Draco could see right through his mother’s faux-casual inquiry as they rejoined the group.
Maybe, he reflected forlornly, if he thought it enough times, he would start to believe it. He soon felt the toboggan slide into motion beneath him, however, and as they picked up momentum, his discomfort was swept away in the wind.
He raised an eyebrow at her, and she laughed. “It’s not a fetish or anything! It’s just a dancer thing, I think. Plus, feet are interesting to draw.”
echoed back at him. At a nod from Blaise, he took a long drink and a deep breath, and then ventured out into the crowd.
Harry let his eyes linger on Draco, enjoying the chance to ogle without judgement for a moment, before announcing their presence. “Better watch it there, Malfoy!” he called down to Draco as he stepped onto the pier. “You’ll get wrinkles.”  Draco snorted, not budging from his lounge chair as Harry approached.
Harry snorted. “Well, we could probably all use a drink,” he said wryly. “I certainly could.” He gave a disbelieving laugh. “God, I can’t believe I just got stood up for a date on a show where the entire
It wasn’t that Harry had a problem with Pansy. She, like most of them, had done a good deal of growing after the war, and although she would likely never be anything approaching

His lips are soft, and so is his skin when I bring one hand up to hold him in place above me. The kissing becomes just another part of this thing we do, with the music and the drinking and the letting each other be. We don’t talk about it.
“Yeah, well. Anyone would be, right?” He downed the remainder of his glass of wine in one go. “Now, go find Draco and have your happily ever after.”
