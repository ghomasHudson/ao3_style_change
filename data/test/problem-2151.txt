“You’ve found your mate,” the man hissed, as Missus Malfoy gasped and looked at her son expectantly.
“Well in the text Professor it was explained that the venom from this spider, when mixed with ink, works to ensure that it doesn’t blotch or smear and since I’m left handed I have a tendency to smear my ink all over,” Blaise paused and then plaster a look of wonder on his face, “Professor, you know these dungeon’s so well, would you mind helping me look for the spider while Draco and Harry look elsewhere? If all four of us search the dungeon, I’m sure we’d find it,” at Snape’s pinched look Harry had to refrain from laughing.
Blaise caught the look and snorted.
He didn’t need to be facing his friends to know that they had their wands drawn, it was one of the first lesson’s he had taught the DA the previous year. It was always better to have your wand ready and not need it than to be too slow and on the receiving end of a curse.
Smirking, Harry had an idea.
“We had agreed that we wouldn’t mention it until we were sure the bond was to progress,” Mister Malfoy made a face.
“Why did you ask me here Professor?” he finally asked after the minutes dragged on, Dumbledore looked at him with a exhausted expression.
Stepping into the warm spray Harry groaned as his muscles loosened. He stood under the water for a few minutes just enjoying the silence and the warmth. Making quick work of washing his hair and scrubbing down his body he was about to turn off the knob when he heard a click from the bathroom door.
“The Hospital Wing isn’t just for injuries, it’s traditionally a place where students go if they are missing home, hurting emotionally, or needing the comforts of a familiar place,” she said, and in that moment, Harry knew that hiding away the portraits was only hurting Hogwarts.
As the boys finally made their way towards the Hogwarts Express, Harry could only think about the Horcrux that was buried in the depths of his trunk and what was about to happen once he finally met with Tom.
His heart sped up as they entered the receiving room and familiar blonde hair greeted them. Biting his lip, Harry used all his control to not run over to his mate and into the Veela’s arms. Immediately as Draco caught sight of his shorter mate his eyes trailed over his figure, as if making sure that nothing had happened.
Within moments he was fast asleep and wandering the halls that began to feel like home to him.
“Well, I haven’t done any real research,” he mumbled as both Prefects shot him an exasperated look.
“My apologies Professor, something didn’t settle with my at dinner and I’ve spent the better half of my rounds in the loo,” Draco looked towards the Professor clearly embarrassed, McGonagall’s eyes narrowed as she looked to be calculating the authenticity of his story.
“Draco wanted me to let you know he went with Astoria to help her with her Astronomy assignment,” Harry had to bite his tongue as he felt a flare of jealousy, taking a deep breath he tried to push the emotion aside.
Harry spent the rest of the evening trying to get Blaise to give him a hint and after an hour and a half of Blaise dodging questions the Prefect finally got fed up with Harry’s pestering and left to start his rounds early, Harry had snickered because Blaise had rounds with the Gryffindor’s, he must have been really frustrated.
Most days he hated the life that he lived, hate that he didn’t have a family, that his worries were far greater than homework and gossip in the school grapevine.
“Any chance you won’t ever mention this,” he shrugged before realizing Draco couldn’t see him.
After Colin Creevey had been sorted into Ravenclaw the hat went silent. For a moment Harry had believe he was saved from resorting. Though as McGonagall approached the hat with her outstretched hand, she had almost had the hat in her grasp when it called out one last name.
“Oh, my silver fox, whatever shall I do without you,” Harry cackled along with Blaise as they held each other as they walked back towards the dungeons calling out for their silver fox that they loved so much, Draco was not impressed if his glares were any indication.
“Harry?” waving his concern away Draco grabbed at his hand and pressed a kiss to the palm, “Didn’t we just agree to be more honest?”
“This is a Portkey Harry, it’ll be activated if you say Muggleborn, and take you to the Apparition spot down by the lake. I want you to have this in case you find yourself in a situation where you need to leave immediately,” he said gravely, and Harry gave his best reassuring smile as he pocketed the item.
“We’ll figure it out Harry, I promise,” and as unsure as Draco’s voice sounded, Harry believed him.
He felt Hermione shift next to him and briefly his eyes flickered towards her and took in her pursed lips; clearly, she had caught the exchange as well.
As he got a good look at the gash on his leg, he had to take a moment to catch his breath at the sight of the matted injury which made his stomach clench harder. An erratic hiss from next to him had him looking towards his friend tiredly.
He had used two of the school’s owls after Hedwig had caught a cold and been unable to deliver them herself, what was even more perplexing was that each of the owls had retuned back to the school seemingly frightened. Now that Hedwig was feeling more like herself, she was up for the flight.
The teachers hadn’t let up after exams and from one class to the next there was a paper or dozens of pages of questions to answer. Snape had been extremely ruthless and expected fifty questions to be answered before break, the other fifty were due the first day back from winter holidays.
The cut had gone down through the middle and his papers scattered everywhere while his bottle of ink shattered. Harry’s anger spiked and the light fixture above them moved.
“Did he try to enter their mind?” Neville gave him a sad nod.
x.x.x.x.x
“I see you’re back Mister Potter,” came the warm voice and his eyes widened in surprise as the same man that had helped him before the Christmas holiday’s came around the corner of the shelf.
Draco stumbled and Harry was grateful they had been relatively close to the bed, as he fell backwards his heart warmed as Draco’s hand cupped his neck, having done so to make sure the fall didn’t hurt him, regardless that he had been through worse before it was still a sweet gesture.
“The pull can linger in a place once you’ve walked away, having been from one end of the castle to the other I couldn’t pinpoint where the pull was coming from, but I knew my mate was at Hogwarts,” Malfoy’s eyes hadn’t left Harry’s.
“No,” Harry retorted, Zabini flashed him a smile, which annoyed him.
An hour and a half later Harry stretched from his desk where he had finished his Potions assignment. He and Snape had been on neutral terms since he had been resorted into Slytherin and since he hadn’t got detention or lost any house points Snape hadn’t bother him.
Yet as he crossed the threshold into his room, he turned towards Draco who was waiting patiently outside the door and Harry’s lips quirked up.
Slytherin had Transfiguration with the Gryffindor’s and same with Potions. Harry could only imagine it was because both Professor Snape and McGonagall were no nonsense with the drama between houses. Walking up behind the group of Slytherins standing outside the door Harry’s eyes immediately landed on Malfoy who was talking with Zabini and Greengrass. His stomach did a flip and he backed up.
I dragged my eyes away from my bloody knuckles to view the just as, if not worse looking, boy who sat next to me. His face was bruised and a little bloody but all together not too bad, I could never throw a good punch anyways so I wasn't too surprised to see him already up and adam.
“Bastard he is!” Ron was practically shouting.
“Oh, it’s YOU. God can’t even walk down a hall by myself without having someone there to watch over me.”
I rolled my eyes as Harry huffed angrily in my direction before heading off the train with Ron and Hermione.
“Oh look, it’s the two lovebirds isn’t it!”
I pulled my books out to the Quidditch field, there wasn’t practice today so it would remain relatively empty for the next few hours. I dropped my robe onto the ground, stacking my books on top of it so they would stay dry, and laid down in the grass. Clouds loomed above me, darker than usual, I think it might rain soon. I closed my eyes and ran my hands through my hair. It was quiet out here, a strong contrast to the usual noisiness of everything, especially with these past few months.
“Quiet all! Malfoy, Potter, come see me after class.”
Lucius Malfoy”
“Bloody Potter, with his ‘oh so beautiful eyes’ and lips and hair. Thinks he's the center of attention at all times, I’ll show him and do something outlandish, kiss him or something, just to shut the fucker up for ten goddamn minutes, yeah-”
“Can’t read now, Potter? And to believe you managed to survive some of the Triwizard tournament! Maybe I should’ve bet on your death being mid-class instead, can’t even die normally, can you?”
“Were you WATCHING me? That’s creepy, even for you Malfoy.”
Jesus, she must be on her period or something, can’t even take a joke. Even Potter can take a joke better than her, and that’s saying a lot.
“Oh just a bit, Malfoy, especially since it caused you to come all the way over here to greet poor old mr potter.” Harry grotesquely spit on my face, smirking to himself as “Ooohs” and “aahhs” escaped a few student’s mouths.
It'll be a long week I suppose.
Jesus Christ, he writes every letter like I’m not even related to him. Can’t believe his whole
I didn’t respond.
“Why is everything related to Voldemort with you? Starting to think you’re in love with him, Potter.”
I snickered out.
My eyebrows furrowed, “love”? Jesus Christ, we’re enemies for fucks sake. I knew Ron was dense but even THIS was something truly elegantly stupid.
He stopped mid-sentence before turning around.
“Haha very funny, seriously don’t you EVER use your head? He’s probably planning something to mess up the tournament for Harry!”
"Anyways, as you know you'll be helping me out tonight, got a bit of an issue with some animals, just need to patrol around, nothing too serious."
“Bloody hell Malfoy you’ll be fine stop crying, besides, we’re even now ok?”
“You don’t get it, Hermione! He keeps staring at Harry! It’s weird!”
“Fuck you, dick.”
“The train’s stopped.”
Snape half yelled, pushing Potter out the door. He started going back to monitoring the class before pausing for a moment.
“Potter.” The name came out venomous, sharp on the tongue as if the sight of him annoyed me.
Once I had made it back to the Slytherin common room, I was informed I had received a letter from my father. I murmured a small thank you under my breath before shoving the person off and making my way up to my dorm.
“Yes… and no. It was good to punch a bastard like you, but it just didn't feel right I guess.”
I looked at my bruised knuckles before looking him in the eyes for what seemed to be the first time. He breathed in slightly, clearly a little startled by the eye contact, yet not chickening out.
“DRACO MALFOY” Mcgonagall erupted at me, quickly making her way down to the Gryffindor table, the hall finally going silent, I could feel everyone's eyes boring into my spine.
“Not planning on punching me again, are you?”
“Oh I’M the pussy? Really? You’re the one who god so upset that he ran across the fucking GREAT HALL just to deck me in the face and then TRIED TO GET OUT OF IT by calling for ‘dear old daddy who fixes everything for me so I don’t have to’.”
The Yule ball was coming up in the next few days. Friday I think, mainly for convenience. I decided to follow my father's request, not like I had much of a choice, and asked Pansy. She seems nice, caring, I’m sure, I just don’t really care for her all that much, nor most of the other girls at this blasted school.
“Hello boys,”
He stopped once more.
“Scared Malfoy?”
I mumbled a curse of annoyance under my breath about how difficult it would be to keep the suit clean. I closed the box and kicked it somewhere near my bed and leaned my head back so it was hanging over my chair, my hair falling out of my face. I crossed my arms over my chest and groaned out a sigh before then getting up to make my way over to my bed to get some sleep before dinner.
I rolled my eyes. Harry frowned at the statement and continued walking.
As I sit down in the train, I begin to feel a longing for what he has. A friend group like that. I mean, of course, I have Crabbe and Goyle but they don't care, no one cares about the asshole who prides himself on his blood status. They're friends with me because of the hierarchy, but he, potter, rather, has his friends because they care. They bounce off of each other so well, so cleanly, almost poetically. It's something straight out of a book. I suppose that would make me the villain, wouldn't it? Oh, that's perfect, the villain who yearns for what the hero has. But that's the thing, I don't want what he has, who would want to be a dickhead like Mr potter? Who cares if people like him or not, it's his fault for not seeing my potential as a friend. I wouldn't want to be his friend anyway, he's a loser hanging out with the wrong crowd.
He was mostly joking but I could tell there was some seriousness behind it.
“Did-” he paused for a moment
“Your face is healing up pretty good.”
“You didn’t say anything about me hitting you.”
I guess a quick nap couldn’t hurt.
Someone else responded, most likely Hermione,
Why was he being friendly?
I pushed him back, slightly more aggressive than how he did the first time. Harry, without missing a beat, took a swing at my face, missing.
He sighed.
“Can’t even turn a corner without seeing you two together, but then again, wouldn’t put being a blood traitor past someone like YOU, Weasley.”
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
Harry looked around, suddenly looking like an older sibling who didn’t want the younger one to tell on them for hitting them. He nervously, and rather uncomfortably shushed me, and took my hand away from my mouth to examine my lip before placing my hand back where it was. He sighed heavily before taking out a small wad of fabric from his pocket. He removed my hand once more and gently dabbed at the swollen muscle with the fabric from his pocket. Once he deemed he was finished, he handed the stained fabric to me and told me to hold it to my lip.
“It’s not worth it Harry,”
"Follow me."
I cackled at the boy,
“Malfoy, go follow Potter and make sure he doesn’t cause any MORE trouble, please.”
“He” was underlined in bold,
“You two have to help out Hagrid tonight, same deal as last time you both got in trouble,”
Harry- Potter, rather, was now covered in soot and a blueish-green residue.
About 10 minutes had passed, I was sitting slumped in a chair as I listened to Mcgonagall and Hagrid argue. this was worse than that time we got caught in the halls after hours a few years back.
your mother and I regret to inform you that you will not be returning for the Holidays. I have important business with some work colleagues, it’s incredibly important and I can’t have you here to mess it up for me, I can’t imagine how upset he-”
“Listen we wouldn’t even be having this argument if you weren’t such a pussy,”
He left it at a wink and shoved me.
The silence went on for a while until Harry chimed in again,
”Draco?”
“Back to class. You having the Yule Ball soon does NOT excuse you from the test tomorrow.”
“Oh you have freedom but here let me pick everything you do while you’re there.” bullshit.
The common room’s cold, both physically and aesthetically. It was the polar opposite of Gryffindor’s dorm. I'd been in there, just once, it felt so welcoming, like a cup of hot tea on a cold winter night. It was filled with warm colors and radiated the visual feeling of home. Slytherin was, well, the opposite. It's funny, once you think about it, Gryffindor and Slytherin really aren't all that different. We aren't all that different, are we Potter? Yet despite it all, I'm still your enemy. We could've been friends, taken this down together instead of apart. Just you and me Autumn Boy.
“You’re not looking all that good yourself, pug face.”
He entered his hut once more before reappearing with a lantern of his own.
I shoved him onto the table, not having the energy to grab my wand, I began punching him,
This didn’t really feel like even but I nodded nonetheless.
Hermione said gently. He cooled down so fast in their touch. What must that be like? To have someone so close to you that even just their presence calms you down?
I looked around for the said package he said contained the suit before placing my eyes on a long rectangular box. I opened it to see a formal looking white suit.
I heard a grunted response of approval before hearing a few more murmurs between the two as the footsteps got closer and closer to my section. I stood up and grabbed my textbook, leaving the other books I was looking through at the table, turning the corner of my section just as Ron and Hermione got there.
After a while, we had managed to meet up with Hagrid again, when asked about my lip, Harry explained I tripped on a tree root, Hagrid then begrudgingly accepted the answer once seeing I hadn’t disagreed, and sent us back to our dorms with a glass of water as thanks.
He giggled. He actually, genuinely, honest-to-god giggled, not to mention at something I said. Christ I must be going nuts, maybe I punched him a bit too hard yesterday and rattled his brain around.
It was Potter again. Bold of him to talk so lowly of me, doesn't he know how powerful I am? Shoving myself off of the bench I made my way over, the trio still chattering loudly, clearly having not noticed. Shoving a few kids out of my way I grabbed Potter by the hem of his sweater
Harry gaped for a moment, slightly smiling with the most confused face he could muster,
“I can't believe he’d do that!”
“Maybe if you had a proper father, you’d be able to hit the target next time.”
And over,
“Oh yeah? Well, at least I HAVE a ‘Dear old daddy’ in the first place.”
BUBBLE!
“As you know, you're both in incredible trouble for that stunt you pulled yesterday.”
“Shove off Malfoy.”
I had thought about asking him as a joke, just to see him sweat, but decided against it after that whole Weasley situation from the library, it wouldn’t be a good look if a rumor like that went out about me. It wouldn’t be right, a pureblood like me liking some half-blood, let alone a boy of all things. It’s disgusting to even imagine. I scraped the food on my plate haphazardly, not caring much for it. I felt someone watching me and looked up to meet eyes with Pansy.
"Yeah. Yeah I do," answered Harry quietly. "You don't?"
"I'm good," answered Harry with a smirk. "And you?"
"Sorry," he croaked as he let go of her foot.
"Then you have to take me out on a proper date. Dinner. Flowers. Everything!"
Ginny watched as hot green jealously bubbled low in the pit of her stomach as Blaise held onto Pansy writes and whispered something in her ear, making the brunette throw back her head and laugh unapologetically.
Harry wagged his eyebrows playfully and smirked at Ginny.
(See the end of the chapter for
Frankly, Harry had just been tired. Tired to the bone of everyone expecting him to be this great figurehead that he just wasn't. He felt like he'd aged. In that one year of hunting Horcruxes, he had gained ten years on his life..or so it felt like. When he looked in the mirror, it told another story. He still had looked like an eighteen-year-old wizard. Hermione and Ginny had tried to convince him to go back to Hogwarts with them, but that didn't seem right either. He loved Hogwarts. It would always be his home in some way. However, after everything that had happened there, the events were too fresh in his mind that he could not un-see them. Even after all the work that had gone into repairing the castle straight after the war. Harry had helped quite a bit on it too. No instead, Harry took time for himself. To find himself some would say.
No! Fucking NO!
"You're BIRTHDAY!?" Everyone seemed to shout at once around the table. They hadn't known it was his birthday.
Now Draco kept his company small and only opened up to a few very select people. And that was just his friends. His lovers were even more select. His love life nowadays wasn't much. He only went on the very rare date with someone Pansy thought he would hit it off with. Or he had the occasional hook up at a very elite private club when he'd drank too much Firewhiskey or it had been a few months since he'd had sex. Draco hadn't had a real relationship with someone in a while. Well, he knew when his last relationship had been, two years and almost three months to be exact.
"Are you not going to the party tomorrow then?" asked Ginny suddenly as it dawned on her what tomorrow was.
Both Harry and Ron jumped in surprise at this, nearly spilling their beers.
"Is it because of Malfoy?" Ginny asked in a quiet voice.
"Blaise is a
Just then a familiar bush of curls approached their table. It was Hermione.
"You're really going to bet on Harry just so you can get some?" asked Hermione in disbelief that the younger woman would stump so low to get laid.
More to come soon.
"Yes. Yes," said Draco dismissively.
"Oh. It was that obvious?" he asked, still looking at her.
"Okay. So you bet that they love each other and by the end of this gala night thing you think you can get them to confess this...to you...to each other," spoke Blaise slowly, trying to make sense of all this.
Harry smiled reassuringly before turning his attention to Molly.
," whispered Ginny in a sign of relief at seeing her brother's on-again-off-again girlfriend. Just like every relationship after the war, their's was complicated and messy.
"Ginny!" cried out Hermione in astonishment.
"So who else is joining us tonight?" asked Ginny looking over at Pansy.
"Yes."
"But aren't you tired of it not meaning anything?" asked Ginny. "Don't you want a something?"
"Raising owls?"
Ginny furrowed her eyebrows together at this question. There were two other Malfoys she knew in fact, however, both had died so it seemed pointless to bring them up now. She knew that the beautiful dark skin man beside her wasn't really looking for an answer to his question.
Do not own Harry Potter or any of the characters.
And it had only seemed to have gotten worse, the social anxiety over the last two years when he had decided to cut himself off from the wizarding world and people in general and escape to Wales. He still saw people, but only a select few and when he wanted too. He guessed also spending a majority of his time around owls who didn't talk back to him also didn't help with the issue. He'd managed to miss his last couple of birthdays, despite Molly Weasley's attempts of throwing him a party. But this year, she wouldn't hear of it. Apparently making it to thirty was a big deal or something? Apparently no one thought he would live this long. And he guessed they were right in thinking that. Especially since he'd been on death door more times then he liked to count.
"Well...we do we have here," asked Blaise in a clear clipped voice as he looked past Pansy and towards were Luna and Ginny stood. His brown eyes lingered on Ginny for a second before shifting back to Pansy.
Ginny's laughter could still be heard as she walked down the stairs and into her own bedroom. The redhead was already dressed and ready for the party but went to go retouch her make up. Her hair was half up in a top-knot, the rest fall into loose curls down her back. On her slim frame, she wore a white linen halter dress that fell mid-thigh. It was simple yet classic. Plus it was breathable in the summer heat which was the most important thing to Ginny at the moment.
"Because there will be an open bar."
Draco was unimpressed with the whole thing but listened to Blaise's story anyways. He was a little disappointed that it had not ended with anyone getting wasted and hooking up. So very unlike the Slytherin house parties back in the day where orgies would suddenly break out.
No one would suspect the savior to the wizarding world would be living in an old abandoned-looking farmhouse in Wales.
"Why not?" shot back Ginny with slight annoyance. He didn't think that Harry had any right to judge her in being interested in a Slytherin. "He's hot!"
“Uhm, well, yeah, I’m seeing Draco,” Harry rubbed at the back of his neck as they turned a corner, the dirt path had changed to rock which indicated they were getting closer to the small town.
The two had enjoyed a lunch of their favorites and Harry felt warm that Draco had caught on that he loved his sandwiches with extra dressing, something that had turned Ron and his Gryffindor housemates green in the face. When Draco had pulled out a fancy looking chocolate dessert Harry felt his mouth water and under the amused face of Draco Harry moaned with each bite of the chocolate fudge layered with caramel.
It was a few hours later before he tentatively opened the door and glanced out into the hallway. Everything was silent, which he expected seeing as it was nearing seven at night, and he edged slowly to the common room assuming that was where he’d find Draco and Blaise.
The piece of sphere and the cup had merged into one and as the cup settled back on the table it glowed once more before dimming. Harry realized then that he was witnessing a Horcrux being created, he knew it didn’t make sense that Tom had figured it out and done it to himself, it was Dumbledore who had created the Horcruxes from Tom’s soul.
He had never been jealous before. He was envious of Cedric taking Cho to the dance, he still crushed on Ginny when she dated Seamus, but jealousy was something entirely new for him; he didn’t want Astoria anywhere near the blonde, he didn’t want Draco to pay her any attention.
Setting his quill down and to the side Snape leaned back against his chair and stared at the three with an unimpressed look.
The man seemed to be having an internal debate before answering, “It’s in Parseltongue,” came the salty-sweet tone and Harry groaned, he could speak it but had never thought about reading the language.
“Thanks ‘mione, for the research,” he said and the trio split, Hermione heading off one way as Blaise and Harry made their way down to the common room.
“Boiled for thirty minutes before adding it drop by drop within fifteen minutes from the first drop,” Draco said with ease.
“As I had expected, he wanted me to break it off with you, forcefully control my Veela side into accepting living without my intended mate,” Harry’s stomach churned and Draco squeezed his hand, “He had tried to tell me he could have Severus brew a numbing potion meant for creatures that would slowly eat away at our bond,” Harry sucked in a breath, stunned that his father was that desperate for him to not be with his son.
It was a month before winter break that the castle woke to the first snowfall of the term. Students were ecstatic and the Great Hall was empty during the lunch period as one after another fled to the courtyard to laugh and play in the winter wonderland.
“HUFFLEPUFF!” Harry wasn’t as shocked as others around him were, Goyle was fiercely loyal to his friends and he was made for Hufflepuff. Sneaking a glance at Malfoy he was surprised that the blonde hair boy was looking relaxed.
“These, these stupid first years, you get resorted and completely abandon your friends, your true friends,” the red head stressed, “and you become the knight in shinning armor? I’ve known you for five years and you act like that meant nothing!” tears welled in the corner of her eyes and Hermione made a noise, taking a step towards the distraught girl, Ginny clenched her fists.
“Let’s talk more when I get back Harry,” he beamed at her and watched her retreating form join Neville and Luna outside.
“It’s just after six,” Harry whined but lifted his head up as he noticed that his mate was dressed for the day.
“The potion will be done in a few days, we just have to add the last of the ingredients and let it simmer,” said Draco who was looking at him worriedly, Harry had been having trouble sleeping which was causing him to be exhausted throughout the day.
“I recognize you Mister Potter, whatever you say here, will stay here,” Harry smiled.
Flopping on the bed, Seviper slithered over his shoulder and coiled up on his chest, stroking the scales Harry closed his eyes.
“Hopefully this year all Trelawney’s predictions come true and you die, Potter,” Ron fled, and Harry noted that no one had witnessed the exchange.
Summoning his wand, he pointed it to where she was and removed the barrier between them. Sinking to the floor as she became visible, his legs collapsed underneath him, and he was starting to feel lightheaded.
As most goblins had similar features this one had a very visible white scar run down its cheek, as dark eyes met his own green ones a flick of its wrist motioned for Harry to step forward.
and a blue shimmery boundary surrounded her concealing her from view, hearing footsteps come closer Harry pointed his wand towards the door having put himself between Esmelda and whomever was following them.
As he approached a secluded area the aches and pains in his body were slowing him and with a huff, he set his trunk down, peeled off his cloak, and sat. His green eyes darted around to check once more that no one was nearby and with a wave of his wand a loud screech was heard from his right.
Picking up the very familiar golden object Harry’s heart pounded as he thought back to all the times he had flown; getting an image in his mind of the Quidditch pitch Harry rummaged through his trunk to grab his Firebolt. A brief pang of missing Sirius stung his heart, but he pushed the sad train of thought aside. Putting the Snitch in his pocket Harry rushed out of the common missing the amused look Blaise shot him.
Harry felt his magic stir beneath his skin.
“Nott!” Draco snarled furiously having taken one look at Harry’s lack of clothing and how both boys wands were drawn. Harry was impressed that the Veela didn’t immediately attack his fellow housemate. Blaise stepped in behind Draco followed by their Head Boy who was looking equally angry.
“I’m Lockhead, how may I be of service,” placing his key in front of him Harry was unsure of how to proceed.
“It’s not for you to decide who our friends will be or who we associate with on our own time, Ginny,” Hermione snapped, all proper decorum lost as Harry watched her visibly rile up.
It was half after seven when the duo finally headed down towards where Lady Zabini and Blaise were waiting, the blonde had filled Harry in on what happened during his absence and teen was grateful that the day was seemingly uneventful.
The three made their way to the grounds and the trail that lead to Hogsmeade, and Harry was finally able to push all his worries aside and enjoy the time with his friends.
“Harry, what are you doing out so late?” Draco said with a concerned face, his eyes immediately searched for injuries and Harry felt his cheeks warm as he fiddled with the hem of his shirt. He could see Blaise rolling his eyes, but Harry had learned to just ignore the other Prefect.
Happy holidays everyone. What a chapter this turned out to be!
To Harry’s astonishment the feather that laid in front of him began to hover and raise, letting his wand clatter against the desk Neville shot him a worried look and Harry smiled sheepishly at his friend.
Waving away the worried look Harry rolled his eyes.
and be able to feel what you had felt. You can add as many memories as you can recall as you cast it but once you stop you won’t be able to cast the spell again,” the man warned and Harry’s heart swelled at the gift, it was something truly perfect for Draco.
“I know of some Veela situations that didn’t turn out well when the Veela pressured their mate, I told myself long before I knew my mate was Harry that I’d never pressure who I felt the spark with,” Draco said with ease and Hermione hummed.
Pricking the tip of his finger Harry waited for the blood to pool before letting a drop fall to the paper.
“My name’s Harry,” a flash of surprise crossed Malfoy’s face.
“Harry, Professor Snape had said that you were attacked in the dungeon?” worry laced the man’s tone and Harry tried to sit up from where Draco had held his shoulder down, the room spun and Harry laid back once more.
“What brings you in today?” Harry’s heart was racing, and he could only hope that Mister Spaulding wouldn’t call out his action.
“Mister Potter?” but before Harry had a chance to speak Professor Snape entered the room followed closely by Professor Dumbledore, both men looked less than pleased at the situation.
The last thing he saw as the Portkey was activated was Lady Zabini’s knowing smile.
“I want him to know how much this year has meant to me, it hasn’t been perfect by any means. We’ve had our ups and downs, but I’ve loved the time we’ve spent together and how much our relationship has grown,” fighting the blush he could feel blossoming on his cheeks he jutted out his chin, Alexander regarded him curiously and beckoned him towards the back of the shop.
The ingredient list alone was longer than anything they had brewed in one of Snape’s classes and as Harry flipped through the text, he realized that the instructions filled almost a dozen of pages.
Draco raised an eyebrow and Blaise shrugged.
Deciding to find Draco, Harry made his way to the blonde’s dorm room. It was a few doors down from his and with a short rap of his knuckles on the wood the door swung open.
Taking a deep breath Harry readied himself.
“And? Why does it only look like you recently put the healing salve on it?” Harry fidgeted and tucked his pillow underneath his chin.
Draco snorted.
On Christmas morning the few Hogwarts residents that remained at the castle woke to a fresh layer of snow blanketing the grounds. Under different circumstances it would have excited Harry, he would have rushed to get his winter coat and gloves on and spend the morning casting snowballs at one another with Ron, but this year was different.
“Madam Pince?” her eyes had been on him the moment that he walked through the doors.
“This is a Pensieve Harry; witches and wizards have the capability of pulling out memories, storing them in vials, and then,” Dumbledore uncorked the vial and let the contents drip in, “going back to look at those memories,” the liquid began to shimmer and Dumbledore had Harry get close to the magical artifact.
Pushing the door open Harry followed him inside and towards the only bed with an occupant; it was Draco.
He was furious.
“Why haven’t you hexed me Malfoy? Freaked out about this whole resorting thing?” with an air of class surrounding him Malfoy pursed his lips.
“It’s okay ‘mione, we just have to deal with it,” biting her lip her eyes caught sight of his bag and without even asking she ruffled through it and gave him a small un-Hermione like smirk.
Harry abruptly stopped in front of a fountain; it was fairly large, built with stone and filled with clear water that he could smell was fresh, but it was the animal that sat in the middle that caught his attention. It was a panther in striking pose and the water streamed out of its open mouth seemingly in mid cry.
Harry thought, amused.
Thank you for reading the first chapter!
Transfiguring a cup Harry tried to fill it with the water and dump it out but every time he emptied the cup the basin filled once more.
Neville had been the one to step up and be the friend that he hadn’t realized that he needed. When Draco and Blaise were busy fulfilling one of their obligations the brown eyed Hufflepuff was there.
“Did you tell Professor Dumbledore, Harry?” it was Luna’s quiet voice that spoke, and Harry squirmed giving her an uncomfortable look.
“My apologizes my Lord, but I have brought someone who wished to speak with you of a very concerning manner,” the elder Malfoy bowed and flicked his wrist and both he and Draco bowed, Tom cocked his head to the side, watching them with interest.
“You’ve preached being better than anyone else and because of that you’ve shut out people who can teach you more than you know, you hide in the shadows not realizing that in the light you can still be stronger than anyone else, no house is perfect, there are still rotten Ravenclaw’s willing to cheat to be the best, cowardly Gryffindor’s that feel comfort from other’s success, Slytherin’s who amount to nothing on their own accord, but at least, many of the Hufflepuff’s I know are true to themselves more than many can say that they are,” he bit out.
Nott barked a laugh.
What felt like minutes were hours and with a groan Harry swatted at his alarm that was blaring next to him. The first day at Hogwarts had always been something special to him and despite that he was in a new house it still felt like it was.
Before Harry could say anything in response Snape turned and headed towards the dungeon.
“Ha’rry?” the blonde slurred and as Harry nodded, he choked back a sob as the blonde’s arms wound around his neck and pulled him into his broad chest.
“Don’t ever let anyone say Blaise wasn’t meant for Slytherin, but we had better hurry if we want to do this without Snape coming back,” frowning, Harry and Draco quickened their steps to their warded room.
“You’re Salazar Slytherin?!” he said surprised, which had meant, “Wait, your heir?” he was shot a glare and Harry was reminiscent of his Potions Professor once more.
“I’m surprised it isn’t a pristine, glorified entrance to the Slytherin line,” Harry mused, not expecting any response.
“Seeing him, Hermione, we’ve spent a lot of time together and dating just came natural –”
So, Harry didn’t tell him.
Muttering something unintelligible Ron backed away from the trio.
It was two weeks before finals began that Harry and the other sixth years, and most of the student body, felt the pressure of exams. Teachers were cramming review after review and while no homework assignments were due there was a level of expectancy to complete the optional review.
“She could never keep her mouth shut,” he muttered with an annoyed sigh.
“I thought I lost you Draco,” he said as he clutched to the Veela’s shirt feeling overwhelmed as Draco ran his hands along his back and side.
“Are you almost done,” he hissed at his mate, Draco didn’t respond but a moment later the blonde stood up.
Taking one stair at a time he stumbled into the bathroom, turning on the water to the shower to a reasonable temperature he managed to wash himself up without making it look like he had ever been in the bathroom, he was tired, he was exhausted, he didn’t want to be there.
Harry’s routine had been broken when he had received a message from Professor Sprout after Herbology that Dumbledore had wanted to meet with him. It had been weeks since they had last talked with one another and Dumbledore had been regularly absent from Hogwarts, enough so that rumors had begun to spread about what he was doing.
“Veela’s want a family. Most Veela’s when mated with the idea partner, have as many children as the Veela side of them crave. I know of some families that have had a dozen children, yet some that have just the one child,” as she turned her head towards him her eyes were filled with tears.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck.
“We were attacked,” Harry breathed as his ribs ached in protest.
That voice was so familiar.
Hermione rubbed her lips together.
“It, it was an accident Professor, I didn’t mean for him to get hurt, he won’t want me as his mate anymore, I understand how mad you are at me,” he babbled on, expressing freely the feelings that he had bottled up for the last few days, “You were right when you said I was a danger to Draco, I didn’t mean for him to get hurt, it’s all my fault.”
“After Tom graduated from Hogwarts and I took over as Headmaster he approached me to apply for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position,” Harry’s eyebrows rose, surprised that Tom had wanted to be a Professor.
She tilted her head to the side, pushing back a piece of hair that fell to her shoulder.
Harry watched in horror as the green light morphed around Tom’s heart and a cut was ripped through his shirt and through his skin. The screams were becoming unbearable, yet Dumbledore didn’t seem swayed by them.
The Ravenclaws were looking at Hermione disapprovingly, as if she committed the most heinous crime in the house, while the Slytherin’s took to ignoring the two, both Malfoy and Zabini sat in front of them, and Harry paid them no attention.
Divination was up next, and Harry looked pitifully at Neville who had dropped the class and opted for Muggle Studies instead. Knowing that Hermione wouldn’t be in there either Harry almost expected a relatively silent class until he saw Ron headed up the winding stairs.
It was nearing one in the morning when a knock sounded from his door and Harry stretched his arms above his head before opening it.
“Draco’s parents went through a lot during the beginning stages of the mateship and even after they bonded, they have sound reasons to be very protective of their son,” Snape had a faraway look in his eye and Harry had to quash the urge to ask for more knowing better than to push his luck.
“Books Blaise? What could you possibly need?” he teased, and the Prefect pushed him playfully, scowling at his cheeky grin.
Harry nodded; he had felt the tension rise as each day leading up to exams seemed to be weighing heavily on everyone’s mind. The younger students didn’t understand, the Slytherin first years were happily chatting at meals whereas the seventh year seemingly always had their hand on their wands.
Till we read again,
“Detention Friday night, Mister Potter,” Harry’s jaw dropped, and Snape smirked.
The room he entered next was about the size of the first floor at the Dursley’s and it seemed as if the gold décor continued in the room as well. The settee and chairs were of gold fabric with dark brown wood as the frame. The coffee table in between the two was of the same wood and Harry’s eyes darted from one end of the room to the other. There was a fireplace in one corner and more of the purple potted plants that he had seen earlier.
“When altering a potion, you have to be extremely careful of which ingredient you are changing and for what intended purpose. Granger has pinpointed that by increasing the amount of Peppermint while reducing the Honey water will increase it’s longevity while decreasing the initial spike that the potion give’s its drinker,” he said factually, and Harry’s heart swelled towards Hermione whose cheeks were dusted pink.
“These dreams have led me to find out that I’m a Riddle’s heir,” Harry waited for any sort of acknowledgment, when silence greeted him, he opted to continue.
“Draco, don’t you have a group to join?” Murphy’s tone was light but that didn’t stop Draco from shooting the older boy an irritated look.
Students were still wandering around the halls as dinner ended and Harry bided his time until someone walked in or out of the Hospital Wing.
It was a surreal feeling coming to terms with no longer hating Tom. He hated Voldemort, the Dark Lord had killed his parents, his Godfather, and probably thousands of other people, but Tom had been used and manipulated by someone he trusted to be a pawn in a game where he lost everything.
Draco’s eyes were pure silver. Not just the iris, or the pupil, but the entire eye. Wondering what that meant and if it had anything to do with Draco’s Veela side, Harry was about to comment when the common room door opened, and Snape walked in.
Wiping the sleep from his eyes Harry peered up to Dumbledore who pulled up a chair to sit next to him, his eyes were twinkling but Harry didn’t have the energy to think as of why.
Harry had expected it and with his Seeker reflexes he had spun himself into Draco’s arms and reached up to the blonde’s face and tried to coax his mate to look at him.
he snapped and watched with satisfaction as Conner’s
“I’m Marline, Marline Merkoft,” she said with her face still pinched, as if he had insulted her by not knowing her.
Some fooling around between our two boys.
It was down a different hallway and up another flight of stairs before Blaise stopped in front of a door. Harry was starting to feel tired as the events of the day took a toll on him, he barely remembered which way they had come, and he knew full well he’d be lost in the morning.
he murmured and to his relief a cloud of smoke began to appear, creeping upwards as a shield in front of him and the two figures took a step back, likely in surprise.
“Wha, what?” Harry stuttered out; Malfoy licked his lips, looking pained.
Harry and Draco laughed at Blaise’s expense as the teen had gorged on his Christmas chocolates in record speed which resulted in him laying motionlessly on the dungeon floor. The few seventh years had stepped over him without a passing look which increased his whines ten-fold.
“Was there anything in the papers about my disappearance?” the Daily Prophet had to be specially ordered to Flagley, so Harry had spent two weeks unaware of any drama in the news.
“Interesting, well as soon as you have a vision, please see me immediately,” sensing that the conversation was over Harry made to stand.
Sharing a look with Blaise both teens walked in and Harry’s jaw dropped. If the outside of the manor was beautiful the inside was exquisite. The first sight to greet him was a large staircase the lead up to the second floor, he wiggled his toes as he looked down to see that the floor was of a deep gold glass that sparkled with the light. Large vases filled each of the corners with purple flowers and massive chandelier hung above them with dozens of candles lit.
“I believe with the correct adjustment, the Invigoration Draught could properly aid Harry with his energy,” Hermione said, pushing towards him a piece of parchment with her writing scrawled across it. Draco snatched it up, eyes tracing what was written.
“A blind wizard could see that Blaise fancies her, they had Prefect rounds together the last two weeks and I overheard him asking McGonagall if he could be assigned with her again,” Harry’s eyebrow raised and he gaped, he didn’t know that; Draco smirked at the stunned expression.
Grabbing the boy’s elbow, Harry hadn’t expected the shock to happen again, and Malfoy hadn’t been prepared for Harry to grab him. Spinning around Malfoy’s eyes narrowed, and Harry frowned.
Harry felt his magic swirling beneath his fingertips, it had made sense why Ron had approached him without Seamus or Dean, in Ron’s mind, the red head had a score to settle.
The smoke was starting to disappear.
It was an unsettling silence that filled the space between them, and it was the pop of a house elf that came as the much-needed distraction. Clearly shaken up the elf looked towards Missus Malfoy with distress.
Draco’s eyes were torn from Harry’s battered form as Esmelda sniffled and silver eyes narrowed.
Neville and Luna were waiting for him at the end of the street and from the matching rosy cheeks he could only wonder if it was the cold weather or something else that had each of them flushed. Neville tossed an arm of his shoulder and beamed down at him.
“I should do so many things Mister Potter, but it would hurt my son, it would tear him apart,” she sat down and put her head in her hands, it was such an undignified gesture that Harry felt like he was intruding on a private moment.
There was commotion from the other side of the door and Harry was momentarily stunned as he found himself flying through the door and landing heavily on his wrist, it clicked painfully, and he bit his tongue to keep from screaming. The door behind him slammed shut.
“Well, three and a half weeks.”
“Standard healing potion, higher dosage for swelling and mild for pain,” Draco’s words were sharp, but Blaise breathed a sigh of relief, he was more Draco than Veela then.
It was a strange sensation to share a bed with another person having never experienced it Harry had always believed that it would be uncomfortable, he had always enjoyed having his own space to sprawl out; but then and there, with Draco’s arms wrapped around him, Harry couldn’t imagine ever sleeping alone again.
“You were not born an heir to this family, by magical means you were granted ownership of a title, yet with this magic you were given traits of the family member’s before you,” Harry licked his lips, still not completely confident he knew how this was going to help him read Parseltongue.
Hermione bit her lip as she gave the two an unsure look.
“Well, no spells are being cast or blood being shed, I take it everything’s okay?” Draco shared a look with the other Prefect and Harry scowled.
“Would this have to do with our current Headmaster, Mister Potter?” he gave her a curt nodded and she looked at him sadly.
it was unusual that his friend wouldn’t immediately bombard him when he entered his room, even asleep his cold-blooded familiar would wake to pester him about his day.
“We were going to be together Draco! But you abandoned me, you didn’t love me anymore,” the brunette cried out and Draco growled, to Harry it was the identical cry he had heard from Ginny.
“Lucius! Lucius let me in!” a frantic voice cried out as Harry staggered to his feet and leaned up against the wall nearest to him.
“Mother, yes, Severus, probably not but he didn’t ask anything,” Harry pursed his lips.
Breaking apart what felt like minutes later both were out of breath and Harry felt as if his lips had been bruised. Draco pressed his forehead against Harry’s and in that moment, Harry felt completely content with everything.
Draco snapped at the students that were standing outside the door to collect Professor Snape from the Great Hall. Winding his arm to support Harry, the raven hair boy felt like he was forgetting something.
Wiping the tears from his eyes he was about to retort when the healing matron walked towards them.
Professor Snape escorted the Slytherin Prefects back to the common room and Dumbledore told Harry that they would talk more the following day.
“My name is Merope, this is my family home, and only a family member can step foot on these grounds,” she plucked a rose from the patch next to her and brought it to her nose.
Holding up his hands in surrender Blaise smiled, “I’m kidding Harry, promise.”
Dumbledore stood up and the hall immediately quietened. Giving his usual remarks about the new wave of incoming students Dumbledore waved his hand and the doors leading into the Great Hall opened.
Flipping through the pages Harry absorbed himself in the books.
Sneering once more, Snape flicked his wand at the destroyed light and Harry had déjà vu from earlier on the Hogwarts Express. It flickered back on and Snape turned to him.
Mister Malfoy is a dream for lost heir’s of a family line. A spell was cast on this family to ensure that the lineage would never disappear. Once an heir turns sixteen the magic is enabled to lead that individual back into the family fold, to accept what it means to be the heir,” Draco nodded his understanding but bit his lip.
“Blaise I had the room nearest to yours set up for Mister Potter, I’ll be retiring for the evening as I meet up with Marlin tomorrow morning,” biding goodnight Harry leaned against the settee back and let out a sigh, only opening an eye when he had the feeling he was being watched.
One of the few memories Harry had of Sirius was a prank they pulled on Remus at Grimmauld Place; Sirius had shown him how to animate books to shoot sparks and fly around. The spell only lasted a few minutes per book, but it was a sight to see and Sirius had reassured him that it didn’t damage the books.
He took a step towards Tom.
“It takes a month to brew?” he said aghast, Draco nodded.
Watching Dumbledore approach the basin he crept his way over as the man motioned for him to come closer, peering inside Harry saw that it was filled with water, yet a locket was at the bottom of it.
“Welcome back students to another exciting year of Charms. Now as most of you know sixth year is a special year for students because you can begin to learn more advanced spells and techniques in all your classes. Young witches and wizards reach their magical maturity at the age of sixteen and advanced magic won’t damage an individual’s core as it would have in previous years,” all that could be heard as Flitwick spoke was the scratch of quills against parchment and Harry made a note that he needed to do more research on magical maturity.
“So, no one knew they had been selected as Prefect? Or did he mean just not to talk with me?” Harry spat out the last bit, his temper flared and the light above them flickered.
Knowing that he didn’t create his own study schedule and would potentially hinder their aspirations he had pleaded with Hermione to give the eleven-year old’s some advice. Never one to turn down students with the drive to learn Hermione had told him to bring them along during their next study session.
“Wait, you were alone? Harry,” toeing the rug that was identical in his room Harry rubbed the back of his head uncomfortably.
“Is there such magic that Tom could use from the Founders to attack Hogwarts?” he fretted, hoping that he was playing off the unsure hero that lacked most of the information, which in this case was mostly true.
Shifting on both of his feet Harry’s eyes skimmed over the students who were still making their way out of the main entrance, his heart clenched as he watched both Ginny and Ron walk next to each other with Seamus and Dean following behind them. Neither paid him a passing glance.
“Explain, everything,” he demanded and that’s what the two teens did.
“That Lucius is a Veela, Narcissa is his mate and they passed on the Veela trait to young Draco?” she commented helpfully.
It had been there since before his first day of Hogwarts and according to the ghosts the book was Rowena Ravenclaw’s idea to help students find their way around the vast library. The book was like a large index, flipping through the pages a student could look up where in the library the book was that they needed. Presently, most students still relied on Madam Pince who knew where everything was at, but it got Harry curious.
Pulling his thoughts from the more intimate acts Harry pushed Draco gently as the teen chuckled.
that absorbed a
Draco leaned forward, all relaxed composure gone, with a fierce look on his face.
Wincing slightly as his leg throb he reached down and pulled up his pant leg which brushed against the wound that he had got from the incident in the cave. He had thought it was healing but as he poked the side of it, it oozed, and his stomach rolled. It was turning green and briefly he thought it could be infected.
The six chatted for awhile longer before realizing that it was coming close to curfew. As they left the Room of Requirement Harry trudged towards the dungeons with his fellow Slytherin’s. He stared at his tie as they walked, the green and silver catching the light and Harry couldn’t help but be in awe that this had all stemmed from a resorting.
The two made small talk before Dumbledore asked him something that made his blood run cold.
“Gryffindor’s would have just asked what was going on,” Harry mused, chuckling at the dual glare’s sent his way.
“This isn’t how it was supposed to be, we were going to be happy together,” she said soft enough that Harry strained to hear her, he watched with dread as her eyes darted to his housemates behind him.
Caught off guard Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s middle and squirmed to get more comfortable in the embrace.
Laughing he nudged her to the door.
the line before that segment in future chapters.
Harry left the bank feeling overwhelmed but appreciative of the time the goblin had spent with him. Harry was now able to purchase items with his pad, check his valet balances, transfer funds when needed, and withdrawal money from any local machine. Lockhead had explained that they took some ideas that Muggles had and integrated them with the growing modernization in the wizarding world.
The silence that had settled over the garden calmed him.
Glancing wearily towards the Headmaster, Harry could see that this endeavor hadn’t gone according to whatever plan the man had laid out.
Harry looked over as two boys chatted with their third friend, a very pensive looking girl, who, when she interjected her comments the boys just rolled their eyes and ruffled her hair, she scowled at them and the boys laughed coaxing a smile from her. For a second Harry imagined that was him with Ron and Hermione. Swallowing the lump in his throat, Harry looked back towards the entrance as a silence blanketed the room; there stood Professor Snape, robes billowing behind him as he walked in. His eyes immediately found Harry’s and his frown deepened.
“HUFFLEPUFF!” Harry gaped and knew from the stunned silence that blanketed over the Great Hall that he wasn’t the only one who was shocked.
Harry’s room was as he left it with a few articles of clothing scattered around and papers lying about on his desk. Seviper was laying atop the bed canopy having enjoyed the height and the warming charms that Harry had put on it as well.
Though before he could reply it was Draco who spoke up.
“What do you want Potter,” the sneer on his face was reminiscent of the last five years and had been absent since the start of term.
Without casting a glance back to his Professor Harry shot off down the halls following the pull that was directing him towards his blonde. The screaming got louder and as he rounded another corner, he barreled through the door knowing surely his mate was behind it.
The man paused and headed towards the door, catching on that he was leaving Harry hurried after him. Taking the familiar route to the library the man flung the doors open with a bang and waved his hand and a book from across the room came soaring towards them. Catching it in his hand he flipped it open and thumbed through the pages. Finding what he needed he turned the book towards Harry.
Making his way outside Harry surveyed the grounds wondering where he could find where Salazar was buried, he couldn’t imagine it being too far from the house yet – as his eyes trailed along a cluster of trees on the very outskirts, he could also imagine that the family would want some semblance of privacy.
“Draco?” the silver eyed teen winked at him.
It had felt like time slowed down while he was under though he could only imagine it was seconds he had been absent. Coughing up water he pushed himself to his knees and then to his feet as he staggered to his Headmaster still battling the fire. Shoving the locket in his pocket he stumbled his way behind the Professor who had briefly looked over his shoulder at him.
“Follow me,” ushering Harry into an abandon classroom Harry noted that Zabini shot the boys a worried look as he waited down the hallway.
“So, really, all you have to do is think of a happy memory,” she took a step forward and Harry felt a trill of panic.
The shield shimmered and vanished immediately after the spell had hit it, “Concentrate, Potter!” came the snarky order from across the room.
Turning down the hallway to head up the stairs it was the knock-back jinx that sent him flying back and crashing into another suit of armor, both his bookbag and glasses had landed out of arms reach.
“I do believe I’ve found one of the Horcruxes, there is a cave that is heavily warded by magic. I was planning on retrieving it soon, would you care to join me?” Harry’s heart started racing and he found himself nodding, he couldn’t pass up finding a piece of Tom.
“Maybe it’s because you haven’t accepted that you’re the heir and that’s why you’re still having the dreams?” pausing mid bite of his grilled cheese sandwich Harry looked intently at Blaise, even Draco had stopped flipping through his textbook to glance up mildly surprised.
“Sorry Blaise forgot my cloak, I’ll catch up with you guys,” brown eyes gave him an annoyed stare and Harry motioned towards a group of seventh years in the corner.
Concentrating, Harry couldn’t place what had set his mate off, unless.
“Shit,” muttered a figure and before Harry could do anything, the attackers fled.
“I won’t let anything bad happen, Severus,” there was a moment of silent debate between the two and Harry held his breath.
All at once things began to happen.
It wasn’t Blaise, or even Draco, that put up a ward; Harry’s magic was waiting for an outlet to be released and Harry heard Blaise suck in a breath as the walls shimmered with a strong combination ward. Harry hadn’t even thought to cast it, he hadn’t thought much except for what he saw.
As Harry filled out his transaction pad as Lockhead instructed him to Harry then placed the present among his other purchases.
“Draco will be fine, he’s strong, whatever happened, he will be okay,” Harry nodded moodily. Shaking his head to quell the fear in his mind, he wiped off his face with the sleeve of his shirt and pushed back his shoulders.
“It’s a bit more complicated than that,” he said as he glanced down to the rest of the Slytherin’s; Blaise was sitting amongst the other Prefects and Harry felt a pang at his heart, while he had only befriended the boy at the start of term he felt like they had been friends much longer.
“We’ve been friends since we were little, I’ve known for a while now and I made him a promise that I’d support whomever his mate was,” the last part was said softly and Harry made an ‘o’ shape with his mouth, unsure of what to do with the newly presented information.
Dumbledore had been more reserved in the last few weeks than he had ever been. He’d wander the halls, nodding to students, but never really engaging with them. There were days he’d be absent from breakfast and lunch and arrive at dinner seemingly exhausted. Gossip spread through the halls that he was finding a way to defeat the Dark Lord, but Harry knew better, knew that the man so many trusted, was the enemy.
Picking up his invisibility cloak he made sure that it was covering all of him as he checked the hallway to ensure that no one would see him. He didn’t have to wait long to leave through the entrance in the common room as a few fifth years walked in giving him a perfect chance to catch up with his mate.
“C’mon Draco, your parents are waiting,” when the blonde didn’t budge, he pressed his feet against his legs once more, Draco groaned and rolled over. Shrugging Harry tossed the blankets covering him aside and stretched his arms over his head.
“Dopplebeater Defense,” Harry said, both boys shared a look of confusion.
“How was it that you plotted this with Ginny?” while he could understand the girl’s distraught, he didn’t comprehend how two very different girls had come together.
Pushing the door open further to get a better look Harry hadn’t anticipated that the door would make a loud creak and when the man stopped playing, turned and made eye contact with Harry, both froze.
The room was stunning, though anything compared to the Dursley’s was lavishly better. The room painted in a light blue with a white horizontal trim running half-way down the wall. The carpet was a deep cobalt and as Harry swung his feet over the side of the bed, he couldn’t help but wiggle his toes on it. There was a chair and a table in front of the window off to the side and a dresser with a mirror above it across from him.
Harry smiled up at the Veela as the blonde pressed their foreheads together and a few strands of hair tickled his forehead, he let out a small laugh as Draco rubbed his nose against his.
Harry sighed at the comforting hiss from behind him. Seviper had been trying to convince him all day to seek out Draco and talk to him about how he was feeling but he didn’t want too.
“-here Harry, thanks for checking it over,” pulled from his line of thought he grabbed Draco’s Defense Against the Dark Arts assignment, while Draco was in the top five of the class Professor Murphy didn’t believe he dived deep enough into the assessments.
“It’s always been an inconvenience that my birthday has landed traditionally during exams, yet mother and father have always planned something,” Draco said exasperated and Harry had given him a weak grin, not understanding the feeling of a birthday celebration.
“Well I’m asking you who you are which implies I don’t know,” he said heavily leaning on the sarcasm.
“Where’s Harry?” though before Draco could retort Harry had tapped Blaise on the shoulder and the teen jumped clearly startled.
It was only second before Hermione was a few steps away from him and a smile broke out on her face, he returned it and opened his arms to take her in a hug, she squealed as he picked her up and spun her around. Momentarily he saw Draco roll his eyes but knew that the Veela no longer felt threatened when he was close with his friends.
“Ginny was one of the attackers,” as soon as the words had left his mouth Draco turned towards the girl in fury, Blaise’s grip on his shoulder was the only thing keeping him held back from physically assaulting her.
“Now, the best thing you can do is block out your free time into different area’s to study, cycling through all your classes, that’ll break down the time first. You’ll then want to outline the material that will be on the exam and structure your chunks of time around that, what you know best you’ll want to spend the least of time reviewing,” wanting to bash his head into the nearest wall Harry mentally urged Draco to hurry up and save him from this review torture.
“How did Luna take to watching over him?”
the reaction was immediate as Anderson’s brown eyes snapped open and he gasped.
“I have some ability in wandless magic; Murphy saw that tonight and offered to help me improve it,” Draco was silent as Harry fiddled with the sleeve of his shirt.
“My Lord, my Lord –“ Bellatrix gasped as she caught sight of him, immediately her wand was out and a deranged gleam appeared in her eye.
Harry looked at Draco wondering what the teen would say.
“Don’t worry, I’ve got it all taken care of, mother will be at King’s Crossing and we’ll portkey from there to the manor. I didn’t give her much detail, but she’d never deny me anything,” he said with an air of arrogance and Draco snickered.
Harry spotted Draco and Blaise talking with the librarian and as neatly as he could he put their papers in their bags and shouldered all three of them. Placing on a concerned expression as the two boys approached him, he noticed with slight amusement that they were looking perplexed if not in slight awe of what had transpired.
He glossed over his discussion with Helga Hufflepuff and the information that the Hufflepuff founder had revealed, he needed to talk to Salazar first.
Making his way to the path that lead to the Quidditch Pitch, Harry made it to the middle of the field in record time. There was not match scheduled for today, so everything was quiet. Scanning the stands and the field for the familiar blonde Harry didn’t have to wait long as a cough from behind him indicated that he wasn’t alone.
As the group left the joke shop, they wandered up and down the main street before heading towards the Three Broomsticks. Mentally groaning Harry was still unsure of what he was going to get for Draco. Stopping abruptly in the street Harry caught a glance of a store that he didn’t recall seeing before.
Draco snorted, “No, nothing of the sort. Zabini manor is unique.”
“I, well, I need to know where he was buried, it’s a long story, but there’s something going on, something bad, and he was buried with something that could help me – us, the wizarding world,” he fumbled, knowing he didn’t have time to explain his dreams and being a descendent of Slytherin.
“Potter,” controlling his surprise, Harry floundered.
“Professor, many of the students seem to be focused on their studies and the time they have here at Hogwarts, I can’t imagine they would know much about their parents behaviors,” wincing as he came off strongly in support of his housemates Dumbledore waved his concerns aside.
With students dragging their feet Snape shot the stragglers a glare and within a matter of minutes the common room was empty except for the injured group, Blaise and Draco, and the remaining Prefects; both Head Boy and Girl had been instructed to check on the students in their rooms and verify once more that everyone was accounted for.
“Everything okay here?” Draco strutted his way over and Harry had to admire Draco’s polished look. He was wearing dress slacks with a silver button up shirt that made his eyes glow. If sensing his eyes on him Draco shot him a smirk.
Harry felt the magic pulse again and try to reach itself to him and he sent a subtle burst of his magic back, it was as if he wanted to reassure the locket that he was there. The Riddle magic hummed, and Harry licked his lips, wondering what to do next.
Both chatted amicably until Draco sauntered towards them a few minutes later with wrapped gifts of his own and a few of the textbooks they had been researching through. Putting the books down in the middle of the table he handed Blaise and Harry their respective gifts.
“Well? How did everything go?” Neville’s eyes darted between each of them as the tension in the room seemed to change.
Pausing to collect his thoughts Harry felt calmer as he looked into the reassuring faces of both Draco and Blaise.
A soft touch on the boy’s shoulder had brown eyes snapping open and frantically looking around. Seeing Harry’s red rimmed eyes, he immediately stood up, searching for whoever had hurt him.
There was a pause as Harry was finally able to draw his eyes away from the Veela.
The man was sitting behind his desk hastily scratching at various pieces of parchment. Without looking up he had motioned for them to enter yet as they both came closer the man’s shoulder’s visibly tensed as he caught sight of who was standing next to his son.
“While you’re right, it’s not the enemy that I’m worried about,” Blaise said lightly, and Harry picked up on what he was implying.
By the time they had finished explaining everything Mister Malfoy seemed to be regarding him with something along the lines of respect though Harry convinced himself not to look much into it.
The following morning Harry was no closer to figuring out what his dreams meant. He hadn’t seen the man playing the piano, but Harry had become extra cautious in his exploration.
“I appreciate your account of what happened Harry,” standing up at the clatter coming from the Hospital Wing entrance, he nodded his goodbye.
Staggering upright Harry brushed away the sweat that had collected on his brows and breathed a sigh of relief that Murphy was standing, albeit, equally out of breath.
“I don’t understand Harry, he’s been awful to you, to me, to Ron, since we started Hogwarts, and you’ve just decided to see him?” her composure was gone and Harry was faced with a very hurt Hermione, and it tore at his heart.
“It’s fine ‘mione, I’m glad you’re enjoying the preparations,” trying to steer the conversation to a lighter tone his three friends still looked uncomfortable.
The locket underneath his shirt hummed with magic and Harry bit his lip. Though as he was about to say something the door opened with a bang and a maniacal cackle resonated in the room. Harry’s heart dropped as Bellatrix followed by the Lestrange brothers entered.
Pausing he tilted his head to the side with confusion, the man looked less then impressed.
“So, I’ll release you under the circumstance that you take one of these potions each night for the following week to help your body heal and you’ll be on reduced activity in each of your classes,” making the motion to get up and leave the Hospital Wing he looked up innocently as he heard her sigh.

The Malfoy patriarch didn’t drop his wand and for a second Harry wondered if father and son would come to blows.
“Come on Potter,” clenching his eyes tight he took a deep breath trying his hardest to reign in his wild magic that was still flowing throughout the room.
“This is my room,” Blaise signaled and then lead Harry down a few doors, motioning to it he pointed to above the doorknob, “this is your room, go ahead, put your hand above it,” and as Harry reached out and pressed his hand against the cool wood it glowed green and with a click, unlocked.
He let out his anger that his parents were dead, that Sirius had died, that fate would toy with him and bind himself with Tom Riddle. He hated Albus Dumbledore for torturing the man he had spent the last five years despising, that his Headmaster would betray him and the wizarding world for a personal gain; a gain he didn’t understand.
“I need you to be very quiet, Esmelda,” Harry said as his lips were pressed against her ear, a shaky nod was all he got in response.
“Who moved you?” he asked softly.
“What’s it written in,” he asked calmly, clinging to the small amount of hope Salazar would help him out and not make him beg for it.
“Hey ‘mione,” he curbed the immediate urge to ask her how she was doing after her meeting with Dumbledore as students chatted nearby.
When Harry had finally got back to the Slytherin common room he plopped next to Draco who had his own texts sprawled open and his History of Magic essay half-way completed. Blaise was sitting across from him jotting down his own set of notes.
Draco and Blaise shared a look before the latter heir waved towards the fireplace.
It was a pop the next morning that startled Harry awake. His shifting caused for the lanky arms around him to tighten and growl lowly.
Harry gaped.
“More that most, it’s a particularly dark form of magic, something that only a few would know about,” Harry controlled an eyeroll, it seemed evasiveness was a Slytherin’s core personality trait.
The next morning at breakfast Harry’s heart was racing in anticipation. Draco was no where to be found and Harry was counting down the minutes until breakfast was over. Walking briskly back to the common room Harry could hear the footsteps of Blaise behind him. The boy had teased him all through breakfast at his dopey smile and the few bites he choked on because he was in such a rush. Blaise had confided that he took Draco’s Saturday morning Prefect rounds which was why he was following Harry back to the common room; he had left his badge sitting on his bedside table.
If Lady Zabini was surprised that her son strolled up to her with Harry Potter, she didn’t show it. The matriarch of the Zabini household was a beautiful woman, just a bit taller than her son with piercing hazel eyes. Her hair was pulled back and tied in a bun and Harry marveled at her deep purple robes that seemed to scream elegance yet in the moment she seemed to fit in with the individuals of King’s Crossing.
Palms sweating and heart racing Harry sat on the stool once more, a second later his vision was obscured by the brim of the hat.
“Tom, you are to help me,” Harry barely caught it, but Tom had shaken his head no, Dumbledore let out a dark chuckle.
The boys cleaned the mess in silence but before Zabini could walk away Harry spoke up.
“Lars take us to Zabini manor,” the house elf bowed and gripped their legs, and with a pop, they were gone.
“He’s used the Floo many times since first year, usually to complain about you,” Draco shot his best friend a dark look while Harry snickered.
“Professor Snape, have you been following me?”
snatching up his uniform for the day he listened as the snake prattled on about wandering the pipes of the dungeons.
Harry smiled and while this wasn’t going to be like any Christmas he had at the castle before, he was grateful that he was spending it with them.
“Mister Malfoy, when I had given Mister Potter detention I had expected it just to be him,” Harry held his breath, while he assumed the two were on familiar bases, since Draco had been a Slytherin since first year, he wasn’t sure how this would play out.
Another shout and Harry took slow steps down the hall as Merope trailed behind him.
“I found your portrait at the school, you naturally wouldn’t talk with me, but someone else did,” Salazar rolled his eyes and snapped his book shut.
“You’re explaining your inability of following a plan to Draco,” Harry let out a groan and Blaise snickered, letting himself be pulled up Harry trailed after Blaise out of the room and up the main staircase.
“My magic wasn’t healing it and I didn’t want to go to Madam Pomfrey because she’d ask questions about what happened,” he said as Draco took his leg and turn it over.
“She told me because she wanted to help me,” just shy of explaining what had happened Salazar waved his words aside.
“Have a seat Harry,” the blonde whispered and with another flick of his wand two candles lit themselves, Harry fidgeted as the air between them sparked.
Malfoy still didn’t respond, just stood there, watching Harry.
“Uhm, hi, what do you need?” he asked gently, and the house elf squeaked and tugged at its ears, eyes still firmly closed.
“There’s some heavy damage to your muscles Mister Potter, you’ll be on potions for at least a week,” groaning Harry threw back the concoction with a grimace.
Neville seemed to have pushed aside his fear of the two Slytherin’s as he walked to the head of Harry’s bed, touching his shoulder lightly and giving him a small smile. Luna was at the foot while both Draco and Blaise stood off to the side, Draco’s eyes hadn’t left his body and it was somewhat soothing.
“Professor Flitwick has asked the sixth and seventh years to help with the decorations, we’ve been able to animate spiders, skeletons, pumpkins, and hundreds of candles,” she chatted enthusiastically. Harry’s smile slipped from his face; Halloween always depressed him because it was the anniversary of the night that his parents died.
“What happened,” Draco’s eyes skimmed his body as if expecting him to be physically harmed and Harry could barely register that the Veela was trying to soothe the anger that was coursing through their connection.
“I know, I know, I’ve missed you too, but we have to leave soon and you need to change,” Harry groaned as he shuffled out of the bed eyeing Draco who had sat himself at the end of the bed.
At one-point Harry had looked up to see Draco pink in the face and pupils dilated, Harry cocked his head to the side, unaware of what could be bothering the teen.
“We’ll meet tonight, I hope you know what you’re doing Mister Potter,” Harry watched as Mister Malfoy walked around them and out the door closing it with a bang.
When he had explained to his friends what was happening each had their own idea how to boost his energy after Draco had warned him that he could become addicted to the Wideye Potion. Neville had suggested coffee, which Hermione had pointed out would have adverse effects on his health; Luna had opted for an herbal blend, which Hermione had made a face, and Blaise had suggested liquor or sex, which had Hermione smacking him upside the head – a fond gesture that had Blaise smirking towards her and Harry watching the exchange interestedly.
“Were you able to say what you named your son?”
“Have you given consideration the dangers of pursuing such relationship in time like this? How dangerous it could be?” it was the first time that Harry had ever heard his head of house sound so sincere and concerned, Harry’s heart ached for his own godfather.
“Geesh, Harry. I’ve never heard of a
“And, what now, we’re stuck together for life? You’ll have control over me? Demand submission and I’ll be pregnant with a kid by the end of the year? Stuck at home taking care of a family?” the questions seem to flow, and with each one Harry found his frustration grow, “and with no choice or say in anything,” he finished softly.
She pointed to a row of books towards the back of the library and left him to his research, not before reminding him to behave.
“Anderson was stunned, I was able to cast
He couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy.
A crack of a branch had Harry holding his breath and his eyes focused on a tree a ways away. Nothing moved but Harry had a sneaking suspicion that they weren’t alone.
“Are you okay?” rubbing her lips together the blonde nodded and gave him a hug before wandering off towards Ravenclaw without saying anything more.
As Harry woke the next morning it took him a few moments to remember that he wasn’t at the Dursleys nor was he at Hogwarts. Fumbling around the end table for his glasses Harry pushed them on the bridge of his nose and took in his surroundings.
“I said I’m not going, Draco,” missing the underlying angry tone Draco pressed further.
Draco’s lips were on his neck, sucking and biting, and Harry barely recognized the sensation of his first hickey as the buildup was too much and with a cry his cock twitched, and he came. His breathing was erratic, and he could feel his cum trickle down his thigh. Coming down from such an orgasm was something else, he’d never done that with anyone before, and he could hear Draco’s loving words in his ear as everything came back into focus.
He watched their reactions carefully, and in that moment, the trio sitting across from didn’t respond. Hermione looked bewildered while Neville seemed unsure, Harry almost chuckled at Luna’s peaceful look but refrained.
As the train stopped students were quick to exit, from afar Harry could see Hagrid usher the first years to the boat. He didn’t see Harry but that didn’t both him much. Joining the other students to the carriages it was only a short ride before Harry found himself walking through the main doors.
Hedwig cooed at him obviously happy to see her partner. Seeing the letter in his hand she stuck out her leg with a determined look in her eye, Harry chuckled.
Tentatively opening the door Harry peered out into the low-lit hallways wondering how concerned he should be that someone else was in the manor with them, his wand never manifested in the dreams, but he wondered if magic would aid someone else.
The weeks leading up to Easter break started to blur together and dread started creeping up, Harry was less nervous about meeting with Tom than he was about meeting Draco’s parents.
“Artists who paint and charm moving portraits have to rely on their own magical core to bring the portrait to life. It’s why only some portraits talk, and others just move, while some portraits have a vast array of knowledge and others just know of their surroundings. When magical portraits are created most knowledge and information that the painted knows can be incased in the portrait with them, though that information is limited up until their death,” Blaise paused at the confused look the three were shooting towards him, “the portrait might know where they wanted to be buried but not necessarily if that was where they were buried,” scratching at his chin Harry drummed his fingers against the windowsill.
For the next hour Lockhead went through what a transaction pad was, how it was similar to Muggle checks, how to fill it out, the importance of a signature, and when Lockhead had realized Harry was completely unaware of the banking features he went over everything with the teen.
“You don’t look as surprised as the first years do,” curiosity laced Zabini’s words rather than accusatory, Harry let a smile play at his lips.
She paused and the stillness was filled with the pitter-pattering of rain.
Waving his hand over the blonde’s mouth once more the spell’s effect was removed.
“Don’t. Move,” he whispered and pinched Draco’s side when the teen seemed to protest, silver eyes shot him a glare.
Truthfully, he wasn’t rushing for her to know.
Running through the plan again Harry thought out all situations. He’d have to be quick in the Restricted Section as the books would only buy him short amount of time.
The both fell asleep and Harry felt content knowing that he still had his mate.
“Snape’s just as disgruntled,” a smile lingered at the corner of Draco’s lips and Harry felt his heart swell that the Veela had relaxed.
A knock at the door had Draco’s grasp loosening and Harry mourning the loss. To neither’s surprise it was a cheerful Blaise that strutted in the room, flopping backwards on the bed with a laugh.
Hermione, Neville, and Luna had found him at one point, Luna thrusting a sandwich and apple into his hands with a knowing smile. None of them questioned his mood but opted to talk about classes and how the other two resorted students were handing their new houses.
Classes were to resume the following morning and Harry eased as the topic of homework was discussed, happy that he wasn’t victim to one of Hermione’s lectures of responsibility. He eyed the teacher table and noted immediately that the Headmaster was absent, an unsettling feeling flowed through his veins.
“The magic surrounding the hat should never have missorted you, if you were meant for Slytherin it would have placed you in Slytherin, a resorting was to only occur in the most drastic of situations, who implemented it?” it was Harry’s turn to frown.
A chorus of greetings rang out to him and even Blaise and Draco as the first years chatted about their holidays, it was the fifth year Prefect that had come over to them and reminded them about dinner in the Great Hall and Harry watched with amusement as the five, eleven-year old’s rushed to the dungeon’s to drop their things off.
“How does the bond grow?” Harry felt silly asking questions that probably had an obvious answer.
A dream meant for the lost heirs of a family, not all families can cast a
“Harry?” glancing up at his friends he bobbed his head.
“Your hands are shaking,” he hadn’t noticed it yet Conner had immediately picked up on it, “You’ve completely lost control of everything we’ve worked on,” sighing in relief as Draco’s silver eyes immediately found his own green ones Harry looked up pitifully at the seventh year.
“Relax, Potter, men can only get pregnant with the aid of potions and spells,” Harry let out a shaky chuckle.
x.x.x.x.x
he didn’t care that he was talking to Tom, didn’t care that he was set on killing her, Bellatrix killed his godfather and hurt his mate, he would be seeking revenge.
“Do you know, erm, about, uh, it?” Harry fumbled.
Snape picked up on the change of emotion and his lips pursed together.
So, it came to no surprise that one evening Harry and Neville were joined in the library by the two Slytherin Prefects and the group was interacting respectfully. Blaise admitted that he had become quite found of Neville after he was able to help Blaise with his Herbology homework.
Since the beginning of October students in the Slytherin house had been chatting about what to wear for the feast and Harry was mildly surprised at the passion some of the students were displaying. He had even been shocked when the Slytherin house had come together to decorate the common room for the spooky celebration.
“Why would you help us? Aren’t you rooting for Gryffindor?” Harry shrugged, noncommittal.
“Well it looks like it’s healing, you probably have another day or so before it’s completely gone, did you take anything else for it?” he bobbed his head.
So, as he was sitting on his dorm bed staring at the Marauder’s Map, specifically the Draco Malfoy dot that hadn’t moved from the library since dinner he toyed with the idea of going down there to talk. He had tried earlier and had made it to the entrance of the Slytherin common room before he doubled back into the safety of his room.
Fennekitten.
“Clearly Draco was correct about your fondness of fruit,” without having time to say anything she turned and walked to a different door on the other side of the room, Harry hurried to follow her.
Once eight rolled around he yawned and meandered back to his room ignoring the suspicious look that his mate shot him, it had become something akin to a ritual that they alternated between sleeping in one room versus the other so sleeping alone was unusual but not unwarranted.
“Kids picked on him Professor, he seemed….so sad,” Harry said softly, “and alone.”
“Harry wishes to visit Blaise over the Easter break, Severus, when he mentioned it to Dumbledore the Headmaster said he would reach out to you about it,” Draco said smoothly and Harry marveled at the blonde’s ease of communication without giving away that they were up to something.
“He’ll get over this Harry, you two have been best friends for so long,” the smile she sent him lacked conviction, Harry shrugged.
The room was silent, Harry’s eyes darted towards Bellatrix who was being helped up from the floor by the Lestrange brothers having been knocked back, effectively breaking the curse.
Knowing that he was in one of Dumbledore’s memories Harry looked around for his Headmaster. Spotting him across the yard with, whom Harry assumed was one of the women running the orphanage, Harry’s stomach churned as he watched Dumbledore observe Tom and doing nothing.
Picking up the book his shoulder eased as the magic surrounding it seemed to relax in his presence, without even having to look at Salazar’s annoyed expression he flipped opened the cover to see what had been written.
Turning slightly, he found himself in one of the alcoves off to the side. There was a plump chair with a table next to it angled just right to look out the window. It was such a secluded spot Harry could only imagine it was the Headmaster’s personal space to unwind. Eyes flickering, he looked up and found himself unable to control his mouth dropping open.
“I love him! I love him father and I will never stop loving him! There’s nothing you can do or say to come between us,” Harry’s heart swelled, he hadn’t heard Draco utter those words before, or elude to them, but as his heart raced and their bond pulsed, he felt the same.
Making quick work of his business in the restroom Harry hurried back to his compartment, noticing that Malfoy and the other Slytherin’s were gone. Opening the door to his own compartment something must have shown on his face because the group had gone silent and pinned him with worried looks.
“I’m sorry Professor that we couldn’t get the locket,” he lied easily, and the man turned glanced towards him.
Draco caught something on his face and reached out to tug on the hair on the base of his neck, it had grown out since the start of school.
“What did you say,” he snarled as Ginny’s eyes didn’t waver from where she was looking.
Remembering why he needed to talk to the girl Harry shuffled nervously on his feet and Hermione immediately picked up the behavior.
He kissed the captain goodbye and wished him luck as he stopped by his room, the blonde’s energy was infectious, and Harry could only wish that he could be at the game cheering him on. It was just after nine as the common room cleared out with those who were going to watch the game. It was an early match and Harry mentally calculated he and Dumbledore would have a couple of hours before the match ended and Draco noticed he was absent.
“Oh Draco, my silver fox,” Harry had to cover his mouth to hold in his laughter, “ I’m so happy I was able to catch you alone, we haven’t had any alone time this year,” she said with a pout pulling her jacket closer around her and shifting it enough that her breasts were on display.
Luna and Ginny began to chat away about something, while Hermione continued to kick herself for not remembering her friend's birthday. She made it a point to remember all her oldest and dearest friend's birthday, especially those who had fought in the war. She blamed it on the ridiculously amount of work she had to deal with this week and the alcohol of course. She would surely make it up to Neville tomorrow by sending him a cake from her favorite bakery. Yes, that's what she would do first thing in the morning. She made a mental note to herself as she drank the remainder of her butterbeer.
"I'll be there."
I just wanted to say a quick thank you to everyone who left comments, kudos and read the last chapter. It means a lot. I have written fanfiction before but this is my first Harry Potter one.
Ginny let him go and listened as the two chatted away, ignoring the perplexed looks from Pansy and Blaise. Even after the decade that has passed since that night, Neville was still embarrassed about it. It was ultimately what broke Ginny and Harry up. For the longest time, Neville blamed himself for the golden couple's split. However, Ginny had reassured him countless times that it wasn't because of him they had ended it. It had been years coming to the break-up, it just happened to take that night to put it all into perspective. That he and Ginny wanted...no desired different things.
The corners of Ginny's mouth slowly spread into a shit-eating grin before she placed her small hand into Blaise's larger one and shook. "Deal!"
"Why? I thought you were pass judging ex-death eaters?" piped in Pansy, ready for a fight.
Hermione couldn't help but smile broadly at the former Slytherin. Never in a million years did she think she would be inviting a stuck-up pureblood Slytherin to an event she was hosting, however, all those old feelings were behind them.
"Yes, he is," admitted Harry with a small smile. He hadn't seen the wizard in a year or so, not since that one time he'd come out of a club that he and Neville had been going in to.
"You mean place some sort of bet on them...our friends?" asked Hermione in slight disbelief, slight disgust at what Blaise was instimulating.
Despite going out the night previously, Ginny and Hermione agree to meet up for dinner. Ginny felt guilty over how she and Hermione had ended things that night. She knew that Hermione was upset that she had made that bet with Blaise and Pansy and she wanted to make things right.
Neville knew the reference was vaguely from a popular muggle song, but that was it. He looked at his friends perplexed but soon his embarrassment and confusion weathered away to happiness. A sheepish grin spread across his face as a sudden wave of warmth filled his chest. He was no longer shy about it being his birthday as he lifted one of the shots in front of him. "Cheers!" he cried before draining it in one go. He closed his eyes as the liquid burned down his throat.
A blush crept into her cheeks as Harry cleared his throat and realized that the hug had gone on longer than she had anticipated. She smiled apologetically as she immediately removed herself from him.
"Where's Hermione?" Harry couldn't help but ask as he twisted off the cap of a muggle beer and looked around the not yet crowded party. Even though the party had just started, Hermione wasn't one to be late. He knew it was weird for him to be asking Ron who was technically Hermione's ex on where she was. But it was an old habit. And it wasn't like Ron and Hermione weren't friends still. They'd been together way too long not to still remain somewhat friends. It would be too weird if they didn't keep in touch.
"I don't know," responded Malfoy as he drank off the remainder of his second coffee. "I don't have any plans that I can think of. I should maybe go visit Mother. It has been over a month since I was last at the Manor."
"Don't worry, they didn't tell me." injected Ginny as if reading Harry's thoughts. "I just sort of figured it out." She'd seen them leave a muggle bar hand-in-hand once when she'd been out with her coworkers once. They hadn't seen her though. And then Hermione and she had gotten extremely drunk right after her split from Ron and told Ginny the whole thing after she'd just asked how Harry was doing.
A little noise escaped from Hermione's open mouth before she closed it and looked away from Ginny. She crossed her arms over her chest and didn't dare to look at the redhead for the rest of the night. She knew that Ginny had spoken the truth. She did use Ron as more of a boy toy than anything else nowadays. The two former Gryffindors hadn't been a proper couple in over a year or so. Despite breaking up, they always seemed to end up back in bed with each other. No matter how many times they said it would be the last time. It was like Ron had some sort of magnetic pull on her.
Harry just laughed as Molly scowled at her son and commented on his eating habits.
However, none of his friends seemed to care as they began to pound on the surface of the table loudly, all looking at him as they chanted- "
She'd come across the old typewriter in a pawnshop in Diagon Alley and after some tweaking on the old thing, she'd charmed it perfectly to her touch and thoughts. Her current article was a fluff piece for Witch Weekly about the hottest upcoming Quidditch players. It wasn't really on the game itself but it had been a fun piece to write. It had given Ginny an excuse to go into the locker rooms and talk to some of the most eligible bachelors in the wizarding world. Whatever paid the bills right?
Just as Hermione was finishing off her tale about a gruel experience with one of her college, Luna appeared in her usual Luna Lovegood fashion.
"With Potter and Malfoy, of course," snarled Blaise at the redhead. Did he really have to explain everything to them? He thought bitterly to himself.
"No. But I can ask." Blaise knew this was a lie. And that Draco would most likely kill him once the truth came out but it would be worth it, he thought as he thought suddenly of Ginny in his bed. Plus, Draco had been mopping around these last two years. It was time that the two former lovers were in the same room together.
"Ginny! Get the fuck out of here!" cried Ron as peeled off the socks he was currently wearing and threw them at his sister.
They'd tried to make it work.
Like any other young witch, Ginny felt the pressure from her family to settle down. Well, not all her family, just really her mother, Molly Weasley. See, Ginny had grown up in a family of boys. Being the youngest out of seven and the only girl, she thinks her brother prefer if she stayed single. They all had a bad habit of being overprotective of her in some way or form when she did have the nerve to bring a guy home to The Burrow to meet her family. Not that it had happened many times.
"And do you know this for a fact?" pressed Draco.
Ginny despite her hatred for boring charity galas, she couldn't help but be impressed at how passionate Hermione still was about S.P.E.W. The only thing that Ginny was still passionate about from her Hogwarts days was quidditch and even that was weary.
There was Draco sitting on his broom; he was dressed in his casual slacks with a silver jumper and gloves to match. The Malfoy smirk was in place and Harry was tossed a black pair of gloves. The weather was cool and there was a slight breeze that carried the scent of rain.
“Well the best thing you can do is talk to the person! Talking won’t hurt and I bet everything will get cleared up,” she beamed towards him and Harry chuckled.
“So, that went well,” he said dryly a few minutes later when their bond stopped humming and Draco’s grasp on him loosened just a bit.
Harry couldn’t give much thought to the Quidditch match as they approached the main entrance, a shout of his name had him turning in confusion as Blaise sped towards him, eyes clearly worried.
As the last student walked into the common room Harry felt all eyes on him, many looked indifferent while others, like Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott were openly glaring at him. Finding Malfoy among the group Harry’s curiosity sparked as his rival made eye contact with him, raised an eyebrow, and then looked away. Harry honestly expected a fight or at least a confrontation and was befuddled that nothing had happened.
Enough time had elapsed where it was nearing the early hours of the morning. Harry’s wrist was throbbing from his earlier incident and the bond between him and Draco was still numb. Tom’s frustration had escalated, and he had set fire to the drapes hanging in front of the window, Harry had winced and only hoped that Missus Malfoy wouldn’t be too angry.
The walk back to the common room was quiet as Harry still couldn’t believe that he had gotten off from a hand job in the darker hallways of the dungeon; sneaking glances Harry chuckled at the saucy look that was plastered on the Veela.
“Boy, I have to go out. I want this house spotless and dinner ready by the time I come back,” jerking him through the door Harry had to bite the inside of his cheek to refrain from crying out as all of his injuries protested at the careless movement.
“Hmm,” was Draco’s only response as he went to the mirror and ran a brush through his hair, Harry noted that the blonde only did that when he was stressed.
“Can we talk?” stepping aside Harry let Draco in as the boy eyed Seviper who hissed, even the older Slytherin knew when he’d upset the snake.
Tilting his head Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s and brought his other hand up barely noticing when Draco’s arms had snaked around his waist.
Attempting at giving his most pitiful look, Harry opened the door but was caught off guard to see his head of house standing there.
x.x.x.x.x
“No, he needs to fully recover and despite his chipper demeanor, he needs to rest,” the tone left no room for discussion and Harry bid the two goodbye and slid back underneath the covers.
The manor was built on a large piece of land in the what he could only assume was the center of it. The grounds were filled with flowers and plants which lined the various paths leading up to the entrance. It was nearing sunset with the suns rays hitting the grounds and illuminating them with a low light, Harry was stunned at the beauty of what he was seeing.
The following two days Harry had barely left the room, he had spent most of his time sleeping and for the few hours he was awake he was skimming over the summer assignments that he had to complete. It was the first year he wasn’t going to scrawl a bunch of garbage on the train ride to the castle.
Harry squirmed as Hermione watched him, she didn’t look angry, just curious.
Luna patted his arm.
“Harry, where are we? I was in a dream and then everything changed, I felt a pull and then suddenly I was here,” he trailed off as his silver eyes finally locked on the woman behind him and a flicker of jealously flared. Harry stepped closer to the Veela and coaxed his mate to look down and lock eyes with him.
“Well Mister Potter, due to that little outburst, I expect you and Mister Malfoy to clean up the remnants of the ingredients. Once that is completed you two are dismissed,” retreating back to his office attached to the classroom Harry sagged in relief as the door shut with a click.
The next few days seemed to fly by and before Harry knew it Sunday afternoon had rolled around, and he was no closer to better understanding any of the problems in his life. He didn’t know what to do about Malfoy, couldn’t concentrate on mediation to improve his wandless magic, and Merope wasn’t shedding any more light to what it meant to be in a
“Mister Malfoy doesn’t know about your injury which means he doesn’t know how you got it or the state that it’s in,” the man drawled slowly, and Harry watched as he retreated to his chair behind his desk.
“Look, I need to speak to you, this might be the only chance I get, please, talk to me,” he pleaded and groaned as there was still no response.
“She hurt Harry, she hurt Esmelda and Anderson, her and the Weasley girl were behind the attack,” Snape’s eyes darted towards the girl who was frantically denying it, as if her confession moments ago meant nothing.
Phew, okay! Next up is Harry meeting the Malfoy’s and meeting with Tom.
Walking towards the main entrance and turning down the hallway to the courtyard Harry looked over to Blaise.
“You’ve got your own bathroom,” Harry followed Blaise’s hand gesture towards a door at the far end of the room, “there’s a closet next to it and your trunk,” he snapped his fingers and a different house elf appeared with it, “Thank you Fitz,” Harry hummed and rubbed at his eyes, energy completely draining from the days’ events.
“Please call me Alexander, now Mister Potter, what are you wanting your boyfriend to feel from the gift?” licking his lips, Harry squinted his eyes lost in thought.
“Concentrate, Potter! Control your arm movement,” came the bark from across the room and Harry grit his teeth together.
“I’ll see if she needs any help,” the tiny Ravenclaw smiled lightly as she skipped the direction that Hemione had left.
There were a few moments of silence as each teen was lost in their own thoughts.
“What happened?” Blaise’s brown eyes skimmed both Slytherin’s and landed on Harry’s wrist that was still being held carefully in Draco’s grasp, as Blaise took a step towards the duo, Draco snarled.
The last thing Harry heard as the Portkey activated was the cry of, ‘bring home a girl next time!’
“Ah, what a beauty, it’s fifty Galleon’s,” the man said, and Harry nodded, with a wave of his wand the shopkeeper floated it to the front of the store.
repels spiders but if too much force is put behind it than it can malfunction whereas
“No need for the tone,” he sneered, eerily reminiscent of the current Potion’s Professor, “Why do you seek me out, after our last discussion I didn’t believe you wanted to see me again,” he commented scathingly and Harry had to refrain from letting his cheeks flush, vividly remembering him screaming in frustration at the founder.
“It was an accident Professor, honest!” gnawing at the inside of his cheek Harry had to refrain from making a face at the youngest Weasley’s cry of innocence.
After checking one room that Harry imagined was used as an office space, Harry’s hand lingered on the next door. Gently easing it open Harry was cautious as what to expect, but what he saw had never crossed his mind as an option.
Harry felt dejected as they walked into the common room, Draco hadn’t said anything, but Harry didn’t feel any distress coming from their bond, so he wasn’t worried that the blonde was upset with what had transpired.
“What is going on here Mister Malfoy, this is behavior unacceptable of a Prefect,” the drawl of their Head of House came as a relief as Harry turned to see Blaise standing behind the Potions Professor, a few of the older students had ushered away the younger years yet still lingered in sight, curious to what was going on.
the two sat in silence before Harry finally picked up his wand and started fixing up his room.
A swipe of the tongue and Harry was lost in the sensations.
“It seems you have an infection Mister Potter, you’re in luck and I have the necessary salve and potion for you to take,” Harry didn’t have time to say anything as the older man retreated to his stock room, returning shortly with the mentioned items.
As Harry walked to the door his hand stilled before he touched the knob, there was something that had been nagging at him since he had looked at the Pensive.
“We’ve passed it Harry, you didn’t mean for it to happen and I hold no resentment towards you for it,” the blonde responded, and Harry pulled a disgruntled face.
“Snakes honor,” barely controlling his snort, Harry covered his laugh as he was shot an unimpressed look, but nothing more was said as the first years watched the concrete bricks slide apart and looked in awe around the common room.
There were a few students milling about the common room when they walked in and Harry received a few warm greetings but before they could make it to where Blaise was seated the group of first years had surround him.
“Well Harry, once I talk to Severus I’ll let you know, as you can imagine we couldn’t have anyone in close proximity of the Zabini manor while you were there and with Voldemort at large this could be risky,” Harry nodded with a somber look on his face, there was a gentle prod at his mental barrier and he immediately felt himself tense, the prodding increased and Harry coached himself to relax.
“I told Anderson that I wanted to try to go to the Halloween feast and when we were walking down the hall a bunch of red lights started shooting at us!” her body shook and Harry tightened his grasp around her, red light sounded like stunners, “Anderson told me to run and when I looked back he was on the ground, he wasn’t moving Harry,” the tears came thick and fast and Harry’s blood boiled.
With a raised brow Draco masked his surprise, “Yes, my father taught it to me, most Purebloods know some level of Occlumency,” Harry sent him an annoyed look.
Luckily for Harry Slytherin’s had Charms with Hufflepuff so Harry saddled next to Neville who was happy to see his friend.
“Don’t be sorry Harry, you are my mate, you are my everything, nothing will ever come between us including my father,” the blonde insisted and Harry nodded, immediately recalling Draco’s declaration of love prior to them leaving the Malfoy manor, he looked shyly towards his mate who had retreated to where he had left Harry’s clothes on the bed.
“Yes, it looks here that Mister Bobeck suffered a minor concussion, I would assume from when you hit the ground after being stunned,” she said, frown marring her face.
Phew, progress!.
Harry was about to push her for more information when Draco nudged him and nodded towards the Great Hall, he frowned.
He grabbed the piece of paper folded on top of the box and as his hands shook and mouth dried up, he read the somewhat recognizable penmanship:
As the end of April was nearing Harry was becoming more and more agitated about trying to locate the Horcruxes or even finding one of the Founder’s portraits in the castle. Hermione had said that they were somewhere but none of the texts that she had read gave any indication on where exactly. His group of friends had kept an eye out and even during their Prefect rounds did the three expand their search but came up with nothing.
“How are you doing Harry?” the brown eyed boy shot Harry a concerned look and Harry hummed.
Merope gave a watery smile.
Lacing their fingers together, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders and brought the boy into the crook of his arm. Snuggling into Draco’s side Harry’s only thought was that then and there, nothing could go wrong.
Carefully pushing the door open Harry gave the Professor a small smile as he sat across from him. He took note that the man seemed tired, with dark bags under his eyes, but still had his all too familiar twinkle in his eye.
Turning, Harry found the voice that had spoken to him. Leaning against one of the counters was a man with long black hair and a beard to match with a scowl plastered on his face. He was wearing black robes with a deep green shirt and black slacks underneath. Dark eyes roamed over his figure and Harry squirmed uncomfortably, the man seemed familiar and an image of his Potions Professor flashed across his mind.
Nott snorted.
Groups began dividing up and one of the seventh-year instructors began prattling on about expectations; some groups were working on defensive spells, other offensive, and one group was working on more universal spells.
“Your sounds do wonders to me Harry,” and with a wink Draco waved his wand over the two and in a second, they both were cleaned up.
to ensure that the family line would never become extinct, though I am skeptical about your authenticity into this family,” at Harry’s snickered the founder sent him a glower.

“And why would Mister Potter be wishing to visit Mister Zabini?”
“SLYTHERIN!”
“Draco, I apologize, your mate,” the man held back a sneer, “caught me off-guard, we had always believe you were to end up with, some better,” Harry went to make a comment when Draco squeeze his hand and Harry bit the inside of his cheek, it was better than what could have been said.
“Draco, nice to meet you Harry,” Harry grinned and then looked sheepish at him.
“Draco, I – I’m, Draco, I’m so sorry that you wound up in the hospital wing, that you got hurt because of me, I’m an awful mate and I understand if you didn’t want me anymore and I should have told you where I was going but I didn’t want to distract you during your Quidditch match, I know how important Quidditch and winning the house cup is to you, and I,” Harry hated that he had tears in his eyes, the Dursley’s had literally beat any emotion out of him from a young age so whenever he was overwhelmed with any feeling he didn’t know how to cope.
“What makes you believe I was buried here?” breathing slowly through his nostrils Harry calmed his emotions.
“I’d love to thank you personally for showing that to me,” she whispered, lips open in what he took as a pout and she reached out to grab at his forearm.
“While it’s not in my nature to pry Mister Potter, I do wonder how you came about this injury and why you haven’t approached the Hogwarts nurse regarding it,” downing the potion he shivered as it felt like his veins were doused with ice.
?” snatching the book out of Draco’s loose grasp Harry flipped it over to see what the summary said, missing the pink look covering Draco’s face.
“Merlin, Potter, you’re an arse,” Blaise grumbled as he clutched to his chest, Draco snorted.
“I, uh, yes,” Harry stammered, Draco smirked and touched his arm, squeezing lightly.
Depending on the class Harry found himself partnered with Draco, luckily though, the boy had been respectful enough that in classes with Neville or Hermione, he partnered himself back with Blaise.
“Hi Professor,” Harry felt the heat rise in his cheeks as he realized that he was still in his pajamas from that morning.
“What happened mate,” Ron stood up and ushered him to his seat and Harry tried to wave off their concerned looks.
Two cloaked figures rushed by him and as Harry reached out to get their attention his fingers went right through them. Alarmed, Harry wondered if he was dead, that touching the ring had killed him.
“I’m going father as well,” he said coolly.
“Nothing to worry about there Longbottom,” brown eyes lit up at figure further down the path.
It was well past two in the morning when the two teens finally fell asleep and Harry found himself once more in the manor, yet tonight, it was like nothing he had ever seen before.
“Yes, I have father,” though before he could say more, he was interrupted.
“Do you have your death predicted often?” the question hadn’t surprised him as much as the person that was asking it.
could be heard and Harry gawked as Ron’s legs were bound together and he toppled forward. The boy had scooted backwards, wand still pointed at Harry, as his eyes narrowed.
“No, no, she doesn’t know anything. The Malfoy manor has many ancient Potions texts and I know the potion we need to brew was in one of them. I told her, and then Severus, that I was just wanting to do extra reading,” Blaise rolled his eyes.
Rushing to clean up his space Harry made it to the front where Mister Spaulding was watching him with curious eyes and Harry groaned as the Malfoy family was making their way towards the bookshop. Not knowing anything better to do Harry rushed behind the counter and hid next to Mister Spaulding who had the better sense of ignoring him as the door chimed and the family walked in.
As they walked back into the study Harry watched as Mister Malfoy handed him and Draco a black robe and a mask, neither said anything as they put the garments on.
Harry didn’t dare look back, he could picture the speculation that was going on and glancing up at Draco he wondered if the Veela wanted others to find out about their relationship.
“I wasn’t going to go out with her,” he said unsure of how to deal with a jealous Veela. Draco made a noise in the back of his throat and Harry wormed his way into his arms when it seemed like he wasn’t convinced.
“It was an accident Professor, I swear,” she sniffled and looked towards the man pathetically and Harry had to refrain from rolling his eyes, as if the Professor was ignorant enough to fall for her attempt at playing the victim.
“If it’s alright with you Professor, I’d like to turn in for the night, exams were stressful and we’ve got much homework for the upcoming break,” the sparkle returned to the Headmaster’s eyes.
“I appreciate the offer Luna, but unfortunately I couldn’t go home with either of you, or Hermione, Dumbledore would have someone watching,” the group was silent before Neville abruptly stood up with an embarrassed look on his face.
“Despite what you might hear, Malfoy’s aren’t abusive to the help, while I have no idea of the names, we don’t hurt them,” memories of Dobby flashed and Harry just hummed; tugging at the blankets wrapped around them he let out a chuckle as Draco whined.
Harry felt the pit in his stomach ebb away at their comments.
Another door was at the bottom of the stairs, very similar to the metal door that was at the entrance and with ease he pushed it open. Still expecting something grand from the Slytherin lineage Harry blinked in surprise at the rows of tombs that laid in front of him. There were torches in each corner that were lit and flickering but aside from that, nothing.
Draco was sitting on one of the couches flanked by Blaise and much to Harry’s disdain, Pansy. Each were chatting with him as a few other students walked up to him and gave him their warm wishes, at least that’s what Harry assumed. Unable to control his annoyance Harry’s face scrunched up and he walked alongside the wall to head towards his dorm room.
The five believed that was due to his nightmares from Voldemort and Harry didn’t correct them, Ron groaned that he had been doing more studying then relaxing all while Neville and Hermione commended him.
When it looked like Mister Malfoy was to take a step forward his wife grasped at his arm, he screeched and Harry clenched his ears, she seem unperturbed.
Tom screeched once more as another part of the sphere was removed and placed in the ring.
“I can’t believe someone attacked first years,” Hermione pipped up, looking upset the more she thought about it.
“I’ve noticed you’re spending more time with Mister Malfoy and Mister Zabini,” Harry began to feel uncomfortable; he knew the Headmaster was probing for information.
“It was a Halloween prank Headmaster, just something scary to liven up the night, no one was meant to get hurt,” Parkinson whimpered, and Harry couldn’t contain his eyes from rolling, while the Slytherin emblem was on her robes she was a poor embodiment of the house.
“Headmaster, I’ll be keeping all three overnight, so it’s best that everyone leaves now,” Madam Pomfrey said, her tone taking no room for arguments. Harry was dozing but opened an eye when he felt Draco’s hand leave his shoulder, the boy looked distraught at being told that he had to leave but after a moment of an internal battle Draco was able to walk away.
They walked for awhile deeper into the cave before the tunnel opened and Harry looked out to see a lake with a small island in the middle of it. Squinting, he could make out something on the island but turned his attention towards his Headmaster who had started to walk on a thin path towards the island. Following gradually, he cringed as his foot slipped on a rock and dipped into the water. It was tense minutes before they arrived at the small island and they headed towards what seemed to be a pedestal with a stone basin atop it. Harry felt the pulse of Riddle magic emanate from it and his own magic sought it out; Harry felt reassured that there was a Horcrux here.
Just then Arthur Weasley came into the room, followed by George and his current boyfriend Phil.
Pansy just rolled her eyes while Ginny and Hermione just stiffed a laugh more so at Pansy then at Luna. The two Gryffindors were us to the blonde's strange behavior. Pansy wasn't, even though the four unlikely girls had sought out each other friendship for over two years now.
"What do you want Pansy?" asked Ginny as she slipped her hand out from Blaise grip and looked over at the other woman.
"Nope. Not tired yet!" answered Harry with a quick shake of his head.
After the war, he had been expecting to make a career as an Auror. And he almost had. What else was a hero like him to do? Fighting dark forces and evil was all he knew how to do really. However, in the end, Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived-Twice, hadn't had it in him to except Kingsley's offer to join the Auror force at the Ministry. Despite his best friend, Ron Weasley doing so.
"Mione, tell me about your day?" She asked and smiled broadly at her friend from across the table.
Ginny laughed at her mum's pinched face at this. "Mum! There's enough food here to feed all of Hogwarts for a year!"
"So...have you talked to Harry yet?" asked Ginny in a quiet voice.
Hermione blushed and looked down at her feet before looking up again and smiling at Ron and stepping into his embrace.
"So the gala is going to be happening in two weeks' time," explained Hermione in excitement. She was talking about the upcoming gala she was hosting for her charity, S.P.E.W. "You all are invited. I will send you owls tomorrow with the invitations." The Gryffindor made another mental note for herself for tomorrow.
"Since the anniversary, two years ago," injected Ginny, seeing the panic look in Hermione's brown eyes. The brunette mouthed thank-you to her.
"Luna! How are you?" asked Hermione as she moved her purse on the bench of the booth to make room for Luna to sit.
"Do you know another?" asked Blaise giving the redhead a flirtatious look.
They'd tried.
"Not tired yet?" asked Ron in a teasing manner. He always asked Harry this question every time they caught up. It had started off as general curiosity when Harry had first informed his best friend that he'd bought a farm in Wales and started raising owls. But now it was more of a joke between them.
The redhead was so absorbed in her solo dance party that she did not hear the soft tapping at the kitchen window over the loud music and clacking of the typewriter. It wasn't until the small break in between songs that Ginny noticed the owl at her window. A broad grin spread across her features as she moved quickly towards the window and opened it. The great grey owl hooted in annoyance before flying into the flat and taking perch on the back of a kitchen chair.
"Well, my research ended in Wales," began to explain Neville a slight blush creeping into his cheeks. Despite the war, making him into a stronger man, the shy eleven-year-old sometimes made an appearance, especially when he'd been drinking.
