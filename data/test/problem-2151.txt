“Fine, I’ll leave you to your studying in a minute, but can we just talk about the ball for a minute?”
Snape grabbed the note, perused it, and said, “Fine, sit down.  The point deduction shall stand, for speaking without permission.  Now take out your textbook and turn to page 109, quietly.”
As if on cue, the owl post chose that moment to arrive.  Sunday mornings rarely brought much mail, but those who had subscriptions to the Daily Prophet were guaranteed to have mail regardless of the day.  A large barn owl dropped Hermione’s copy in front of her.  After unfurling the paper, she choked on her orange juice as she gasped at the headline.
“He came to England,” Godric answered.  “He lived at Hogwarts during the school year.  If I remember correctly he was taken in by the Black family during the summers.”
Despite the fact that they were being insulted, Crabbe and Goyle just sat there silently, watching the exchange.  They either had no self-confidence to speak of, or they really did, as many people suspected, have the combined brain power of a slug.
“Dislike?” Ron asked. “I don’t dislike him, Hermione. I bloody hate him! He’s a slimy, evil Slytherin bastard.”
Harry then explained to Blaise about everything that had been going on recently.  He made sure to leave out any mention of what had been learned about Voldemort and Tom Riddle, or about Sirius being in the Hells.  Upon finishing his tale, Madame Pomfrey walked over and startled all three boys when she spoke.
Meanwhile, in Professor Dumbledore’s office, Rufus Scrimgeour barged into the office, with a copy of the Daily Prophet in his hand.
“Why can’t they be wrapped?”  Aarik asked, confused.  “And what do you mean they weren’t bought in a store?  Draco you didn’t steal them did you?”
“Godric, I cannot even begin to count the times,” Helga said, “that Rowena and I tried to get this through your thick skull in life.  Alaric’s death was an accident!  Salazar did not intend for it to happen and he felt horrible about Alaric’s death.  Then, instead of comforting him, the man you claimed to love, you turned on him and blamed him for something that was not his fault.”
“They’re all male,” Corelian said, as he looked at the male students in the room, who consisted of Ryan, Zacharias, Harry, Draco, Nicolas, and Justin.
“My condolences on your loss, Matt,” Draco said.  “I didn’t know your father very well, but from what I saw, he was an infinitely better father than my own.  What about Ryan?  Wasn’t your father his guardian, too?”
“Ah, much better,” King Erevan said before anyone could say anything.  “Welcome all to the Kingdom of Atlantis.  I am King Erevan Rivarendell and now if you will all please follow my lovely wife, Queen Calliara, and I, we shall take you all on a tour of Atlantis to prove that it does, in fact, still exist.”
“Asheera also gave me a few other items to help me,” Draco continued, before getting a guilty look on his face and said, “Ah, by the way, Asheera, Valshar’s challenge was that I make him cry.  I used Apollo’s Mirror of Truth and it broke from the strain.”
“I don’t want your bleeding sympathy!” Draco exclaimed, as he was totally not used to anyone other that his mom, Blaise and Daphne being nice to him.
“Well, you wanted revenge on Godric,” Harry said, “and it seems that he also wanted revenge on you.  He just went about his differently.”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” replied Asheera.  “I’m referring to my brother-in-law, Lord Teryn, the Master of the Death Sphere.  He commented a few months ago that there was a lesser devil born in the Fourth Hell roughly three-thousand years ago named Voldemort and wondered if your Dark Lord was one in the same.  We just dismissed it though when we realized that Tom Riddle’s full name spelled ‘I am Lord Voldemort’ by rearranging the letters.  We thought it nothing more than a coincidence.”
McGonagall looked confused and then said, “Matthew, you’re a professor.  You know nobody can Apparate in or out of Hogwarts.  The wards simply won’t allow it.”
“No, I haven’t, but it’s a good idea,” Ryan said as he got up and went over to the large double doors that led into Rowena’s library.  Curious, Nick and Bill followed him and Brendan and Rowena disappeared from the common room frame as they moved to the library.
Harry stepped through the archway and looked around at what was obviously the common room of Godric’s quarters.  Looking around the room, Harry couldn’t help but notice the similarity to what Rowena and Helga’s quarters had looked like at first.  Sheets covered all the furniture, there were cobwebs everywhere, and a thick layer of dust coated every imaginable surface.  The air was extremely stale smelling and as it had been with the others, it was obvious that the room had been uninhabited for centuries.
“I applaud you on expelling Mr. Nott, Albus,” Salazar said, “but that is simply not enough.  It’s abhorrent and completely unacceptable to me that a member of my house would use the Cruciatus Curse against anyone, let alone one of their housemates!  So, Slytherins you have Mr. Nott to thank for this,” at this point Salazar yelled so loud that the people in Hogsmeade could probably hear him, “1000 POINTS FROM SLYTHERIN!”
“Snapped his wand?” Dumbledore asked in a grave tone, not liking the direction Snape’s tale was going in one bit.  Normally, he might have been overjoyed at the thought of Voldemort snapping his wand and giving up wizardry, as if that would ever happen, but knowing what Voldemort really was, the fact that he’d snapped his wand had dire repercussions that Dumbledore didn’t like to contemplate.
“Granger, Hermione,” McGonagall called, and Hermione was soon scheduled to take Charms, Defense against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, before putting her name down for Defense Arts and Basics of Battlefield Medicine.
Noticing Draco sitting in the office, Aarik ran over and flung his arms around the blond, “Draco where have you been?  I’ve been worried sick about you,” Aarik would have mentioned not being able to find Draco on his map, but as he didn’t want everyone to know about it, he said, “Alaric and the founders were all over the castle looking for you and they said they couldn’t find you anywhere.”
Newly-appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, the former Head of the Auror Office at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has confirmed that the last two spells cast with Mr. Malfoy's wand were indeed the Cruciatus and Killing curses. As a result, Mr. Malfoy has earned himself a one-way ticket back to Azkaban Prison. Due to the mass revolt of the Dementors, the Ministry has recently acquired two Welsh Greens, a Hungarian Horntail, and a Norwegian Ridgeback to act as guards at the prison.
“So, you think I should start exploring near Ravenclaw Tower and see if I can find some secret room that’s supposedly been missing for centuries?  Hermione, that could take forever and we don’t even know if they ever did exist to begin with.  Headmistress Derwent might have been right about it being nonsense.  Not to mention the fact that there have been other heirs of the founders in the school since 1750, if the rooms existed surely they would have been found by now.”
"What he's saying is that Salazar summoned a devil," Severus said.  "Voldemort is not human - he's a devil.  A real, live devil born in the Hells - a fact which he revealed tonight to all of the Death Eaters.  He doesn't care about Muggles and Muggle-borns or pureblood supremacy.  All he cares about is turning Earth into the Tenth Hell."
“Ah, how nice; you must allow me to meet him as well.  Would it be possible for you to bring them all here for me to meet?”
“Salazar, from what I’ve just heard, you don’t really have the right to throw stones,” Rowena said as she slipped into the frame.  “I must admit that Helga and I both were quite angry with Godric for maligning your memory, but now to find out that you bred a basilisk to kill Godric’s heirs, I’m equally as angry with you.”
“Yes, it is,” King Erevan agreed.  “Of course, is that really surprising considering that Atlantis had already been at the bottom of the ocean for several millennia when the ancient Greek tales about Atlantis were written?  The stories were based in fact, but they were told only by word of mouth until Plato first wrote them down around 360 BC.  As I’m sure you know, oral history can at times be unreliable, because overtime the truth becomes harder to find, as the various tellers of the tale add and omit details.”
“Well, I know of something that could be the perfect gift for Aarik,” Asheera said.  “What I’m thinking of could be considered the gift to end all gifts - a gift of such immense value that no other gift could possibly compare to it.  I think I can safely guarantee that Aarik will love it more than any gift he’s ever gotten before, and in the process of getting this gift, you could also get a gift for yourself as well.”
Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Harry stopped him and said, "Ron, I know you don't agree, so just please agree to disagree. I'm not in the mood to watch my two best friends fighting right now."
“Oh yes, it is definitely possible,” Asheera said.  “Evil sown on the Mortal Plane by a devil is very potent and when enough evil has been done, the Mortal Plane will begin it’s descent into the Hells, before finally, it ceases to be the Mortal Plane.  That’s why there are Nine Hells, because the Mortal Plane has been turned into a Hell eight times in history.  Earth is the current Mortal Plane and has been for millions of years, but before Earth, the Mortal Plane was Nessus, which is now the Ninth Hell, ruled by Asmodeus, the King of the Hells.”
“Rowena how is it that Brendan is here?  I mean, I’ve never seen his portrait before today and you said that you were alone here in your quarters since you died.”
“Yes, kind, but unnecessary, Professor,” Ryan said and upon the questioning look from the Headmaster, he elaborated, “My father and step-mother can stay in one of the empty bedrooms in Rowena’s quarters.  She has about twenty guest rooms, so there’s plenty of room and it’s very private since I am in sole control of who can and cannot enter the room.”
“The Temple District,” Asheera answered.  “More precisely, our destination is the Temple of Persephone.”
The woman in the mirror laughed and said, “At least those glamour charms haven’t changed you, Valen.  You always could make me laugh.”
“I don’t think he is, although I can’t be totally sure as I haven’t seen his complete family tree.  He’s my late grandmother, Lucinda Malfoy Cromwell’s grandnephew.”
“Using that infernal stick of wood these people at Hogwarts call a wand,” Valen answered.  “I realize that they aren’t as magically advanced as our society, but I can’t believe that they haven’t realized that their infernal wands are actually limiting their powers.”
Tom Riddle was lying on his stomach, naked from the waist up.  Only, it wasn’t a bed or even the floor that he was lying on, no, this night Voldemort decided to be especially brutal with the torture of his prisoner and transfigured the boy’s bed into a rack.  With a flick of his wand, Tom screamed again as his arms and legs were pulled further, not enough to dislocate anything but still very painful.
“Somehow, I doubt you’ll be glad for long,” Ryan said, as he noticed Rowena and Helga slip into the frame behind Godric.
Narcissa and Cedric both looked a bit confused by that, so Aarik explained the truth about his name.  Lily wasn’t very happy with Albus for legally changing her son’s name, but she understood why he did it.  She was also happy to hear that Aarik was now using his given name.
"I'm sure I speak for everyone here," Aberforth said, "when I say we could use some good news after the bomb you just dropped on us.  So spill it, Albus."  Aberforth Dumbledore didn't usually speak during the Order meetings, choosing to just quietly observe, but he decided to make an exception this time.
Young Mr. Malfoy was unavailable for comment, but Mr. Cromwell issued the following statement, "I went to Malfoy Manor because we had received intelligence that Lucius Malfoy was at the manor and was using one of the Unforgivable Curses. I arrived just in time to witness my cousin casting the Killing curse on Narcissa, so I quickly disarmed and stunned him so he could be taken into custody. I later found out from Draco that his mother had been trying to protect him from Lucius, whom had been using the Cruciatus curse on him."
“Hello Remus, my friend,” James said as he walked over to the werewolf, who quickly stood up.  Being this close to him, there was no mistake in Remus’ mind – this was definitely James Potter.  Remus flung his arms around his best friend and hugged him for a minute, before pulling back and saying, “I can’t believe you’re alive!  And you haven’t changed one bit.”
Nick noticed the looks on some of the people’s faces and decided to put a stop to it by wrapping his arm around Bill’s waist and saying, “I can’t stop you from looking, but don’t get any ideas, because Professor Weasley is officially off the market.”
The heirs of both Rowena Fiona Ravenclaw and Salazar Sebastian Slytherin both transferred to Hogwarts just this year for their sixth years of education.
“Performing our duties,” Hermione answered.  “Justin and I are only performing our scheduled rounds, Mr. Filch.  Now, if you’ll excuse us, we have to get back to work.”
Alaric didn’t switch back to Parseltongue and just said, “Dad, I may have only been nine when I died, but considering that I recently celebrated my 1290th deathday, I’ll talk to you any bloody way I please, especially when you’re being a git.”
“Now, if you will all please turn to page ten in your copies of Advanced Potion-Making, you will see the potion that we will be brewing today: the Draught of the Living Death.  I know that it is much more complex then anything any of you have tried before and I don’t expect a perfect potion from anyone.  However, to the team that does best, go these two small vials of liquid luck.  We have a little over an hour left, so between you and your partners, you should be able to make a decent attempt.  So, start brewing!”
Raising his scepter, a four-foot shaft carved from a solid ruby, Asmodeus mumbled a few words under his breath and prepared to force Voldemort’s return to his native layer of Hell, Phlegethos. It was then that he realized that he would be unable to do it, for as soon as he finished the first part of his spell, long tendrils of red light, normally invisible to the naked eye, emerged from Voldemort’s body and connected him to all of his Death Eaters.
“That’s just it,” Zach said.  “I know he isn’t.  William Hufflepuff told me that he came into Helga’s quarters earlier and left almost immediately.  He said he was clearly very upset and in tears when he left.”
"Now, let me tell you a little bit about how Hogwarts works.  In case you don't already know, the four houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.  While you're here, your house will be like your family.  You will sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room.  Normally, we would tell new students that they would also have classes with the rest of their house, which is true, since it will be very likely that you will have members of your house in at least some of your classes.  However, as sixth-year students your O.W.L. results determine which advanced classes you are eligible to take.  Since not every student excels in all areas, you will not necessarily be attending all of your classes with all of your housemates who are in the same year, as you would have done in years past."
Before leaving the room though, Harry turned to look at Draco and blew him a kiss, which caused Draco to smile.
The wall soon opened and Nick passed through the entrance, before inviting the others into the room.  Calling for Dobby, the house-elves quickly cleaned up the common room before moving on to the other rooms.  Nick couldn’t help but notice the look on Hermione’s face, which clearly said that she thought it was wrong for him to use the house-elves to clean Salazar’s quarters, but thankfully, she held her tongue.
"Now, on to the start of term announcements," Dumbledore said, as he once again paused to take a sip from his goblet before continuing. "As always the forest on the grounds of this school is forbidden to all students. Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to remind you that magic is not allowed in the hallways between classes and that all products sold by Zonko's and Weasley's Wizard Wheezes are on the banned items list. To read the list in it's entirety please see the list posted outside of Mr. Filch's office, although I warn you that it now numbers close to a thousand items and will take quite awhile to read. Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams will begin in about two weeks, as soon as we are satisfied that the added protection wards around the pitch are at their strongest.
"No, I've already been sorted into Ravenclaw," Ryan said. "Professor Dumbledore called me to his office for a private sorting ceremony because he thought I'd feel too out of place being sorted with the first years."
"That's all good and all," Ryan said, "but is there anyone who would still be at Hogwarts that you know of who might be?"
“Yes, it was Peter and Sirius spent twelve years in Azkaban for something he didn’t do.  He died fighting Death Eaters at the Ministry last year.  In fact he was dueling with your Aunt Bellatrix when he fell through the veil and she just laughed.”
“Oh Corelian, honey, will you just open the damn book and let them see for themselves already?”  Asheera said.  “Stop torturing them.”
After all the measurements were taken, Nicolas said, "In addition to the school robes, I'll pretty much need a whole new wardrobe. I'm sure a good portion of the clothes I have won't be all that appropriate. Hogwarts is in a very different climate then what I'm used to at Beauxbatons."
“Then you are both selfish idiots,” Corelian said, “and you will be barred from marrying in Atlantis if you go through with that ritual.”
“Tell me, what year is it?  It’s really rather hard to keep track of time when you’re a portrait hanging on the wall in a forgotten room with all the drapes closed for... well, I don’t know how long.”
Professor Dumbledore was, in fact, a very busy man this afternoon, because after contacting Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, and Mr. and Mrs. Diggory, he also contacted Remus Lupin, as well as Percy, Fred, and George Weasley.  He had been tempted to place a Floo-call to Romania and ask Charlie to come home, but he was fresh out of International Floo Powder and decided to send an owl instead.  The only people that Dumbledore didn’t contact who could be considered an interested party were Mr. and Mrs. Vernon Dursley, but that was at Lily’s request, as she wanted to deal with her sister and brother-in-law personally.
Blaise laughed, prompting Harry to give him a strange look, before Blaise said, “Draco is not my boyfriend.”
“I apologize, Mistress,” Valen said as he waved his hand over his face, which caused subtle but distinct changes to his appearance.  His shoulder-length black hair grew about a foot longer and turned platinum blond and his blue eyes turned green.
“Voldemort is a lesser devil?”  Angelique asked.  “Oh heavens, then that means that he’s trying to turn Earth into a Hell and usurp Asmodeus.”
"He who rules the deepest Hell rules them all," Dumbledore stated.  "In other words, if Voldemort succeeds in turning Earth into the Tenth Hell, he will become the most powerful devil in the Hells, unseating Asmodeus, the Lord of the Ninth Hell, Nessus, who has been King of the Hells for several millennia now.  If Voldemort succeeds, all hope of us beating him will disappear because only the Gods would be powerful enough to defeat him."
“You would claim four human souls and return to the Land of the Living yourself?”  Valshar asked and Draco nodded.  “That shall not be an easy task, mortal.  The crypt doors do not open easily; allow me to think for a moment of an appropriate task.”
“Well, he possessed a fake Tom Riddle to prevent Asmodeus from finding out he was on Earth,” Asheera said.  “Anytime any devil is summoned out of the Hells to the Mortal Plane, the King will know about it in a matter of a few minutes.  He won’t do anything if he senses that the devil is encased in binding magic to force them to do someone’s bidding, but as Voldemort summoned himself to Earth, he can’t appear in his true form or Asmodeus would find out and force him to return.”
“Well, Hermione think how I feel,” Ryan said.  “I actually slept in Rowena’s bed or at least the bed that I assume she slept in.”
"Are we perhaps talking about Fleur Delacour?" Nicolas asked. "Has a little sister named Gabrielle?"
“Excellent,” Dumbledore said.  “Mr. Delaney can fill you in further.  I have an appointment at the Ministry, so I shall have to take my leave now.”
Stephen and Tracey sat at the indicated desk, and Bill then motioned towards the table behind them and said, “Ryan Cromwell and Nicolas Delaney; Kevin Entwhistle and Hermione Granger behind them.”
“What!  How?”  Harry exclaimed as he grabbed the paper from his friend and started reading the article.
“Thank you for contacting me, Mr. Pucey,” Dumbledore said.  “I’ll do my best to get reinforcements to Hogsmeade as soon as possible.”
The student laughed silently and slipped away before being detected.  Unfortunately, in their haste to get away, they did not notice that their scarf, knitted in their house colors, fell out of their pocket – leaving a hint of red and gold in the otherwise empty and drab stone hallway.
“Yes,” Rowena confirmed, “I taught Ryan, Hermione, Harry, and three of their friends how to simultaneously cast a spell, as I did not believe that Ryan would have been strong enough at his age to cast the Mass-Book Restoration charm by himself considering the vast number of books and scrolls in my library.”
Matthew pulls away from Oliver and spins around to see his father standing there, along with Draco Malfoy. "Father! I didn't expect you home at this time of day. What is Malfoy doing here?"
“Yes, of course,” Dumbledore said.  “Mr. Potter, Mr. Smith, you need to prepare yourselves for what will be the biggest shock of your young lives.  I highly doubt that any shock you have ever experienced will compare to the one that you will receive in a few moments.”
Draco had always enjoyed spending time alone with his mother, because when he was alone with her, he didn't have to put on the act that he put on in front of everyone else, especially his father. Lucius was insistent that Draco not show his emotions, saying that showing one's emotions was a sign of weakness and that Malfoys, especially Malfoy men, must never, ever be weak. If Draco showed emotion in front of Lucius, he'd be liable to be placed under the Cruciatus Curse for several minutes as punishment. With Narcissa, however, it was totally different, because she encouraged her son to show emotion and to not be the stuck-up spoiled brat that her husband tried to make him.
“All of the cities in Atlantis are not this beautiful,” Asheera explained.  “However, Atlantia is the capital city and primary home of the royal family, so it was built up as extravagantly as possible to be the crown jewel of the kingdom.  This section of the city is even more splendid then some others, because it’s the Nobles’ Quarter.  If you look to your left, Draco, you’ll be able to see the royal palace on the hill overlooking the city.”
While Corelian went down to Level One to meet with the Minister, Matthew and Oliver proceeded to the Aurors’ Office on Level Two.  Matthew held Oliver’s hand tightly.  Matthew had been here before many times to visit his father, but the knowledge that his father was now dead, made this trip extremely hard and Matthew was glad Oliver was there.  He honestly didn’t think he could handle making this trip alone.
"Well, there were Oliver's housemates, Bill and Charlie Weasley," Matt said. "I think they were both bisexual at least. Bill graduated when Oliver and I were second years and Charlie when we were fourth years."
“I don’t believe you,” Pansy said.  “You want me Draco, I know you do.  If you had sex with Blaise, then it must be because he forced himself on you.”
‘Oh Ryan looks so cute when he’s thinking,’ Justin thought as he grinned from ear to ear.  ‘I’m as sure as I’ve ever been about anything in my life that he’s the one, so I hope he’ll agree to go to the dance with me.  Now that I know that the Wizarding World doesn’t care about same-sex pairings, I’m ready for the whole world to know I’m with Ryan.  Well, at least the Wizarding World.  My parents are a different story because I know they’ll be furious.  Probably best to wait until I’m legal before I tell them because I’m sure they’ll disown me.’
“Ryan’s father showed us all a very old book written by the founders which records the names, birth and death dates, and ages of all their heirs.  And the fact that I was able to bring you into this room proves that I am Gryffindor’s heir, because only an heir can open the door and give other people permission to enter.”
“No, even though they are technically my heirs, since it was you who found the room the magic will now only recognize you as my heir.  If Matthew or Charles had found the room before you, then one of them would be recognized as my heir.  Of course, as my heir, you can instruct the room to allow other people to open the door, if you so desire.”
Ryan grinned at Anthony.  He was tempted to ask if he was going to spend any time with Seamus Finnegan over the holidays, but after being outed himself by the
“No, Harry, listen to me,” Ron said.  “It just doesn’t make any sense.  I know you think that Draco has changed, but he was a right little git to us for five years.  He did everything he could to get us into trouble, make Gryffindor lose points, and generally make our lives miserable.  He loved calling Hermione a Mudblood and making fun of me and my family because we did not have a lot of money.  He’s just like his father, this has to be a trick - it just has to be.”
“Yes, Mistress,” Valen said with a grin.  “His Supreme Lordship thought that if I was going to change my appearance though, that I might as well go all the way and make myself look completely different.  Though to be honest, it isn’t the glamour charms that I really dislike.”
“Hmm, I’m not sure if you’ll be able to cast it, to be honest.  The incantation is simple, but in order for it to work, it would require a very large output of magical energy, which I cannot be sure that a sixteen-year-old wizard would possess, even though you my heir.”
“Ah much better,” the woman said.  “Now, I’m sure you must be wondering why I’m contacting you.  His Supreme Lordship is busy with important matters of state and asked me to contact you for an update on his behalf.”
"Who're you talking to Hermione?" a raven-haired boy said as he walked up, along with two red-heads.
“Yes, that would be one good use of the room,” Helga confirmed.  “Salazar also loved it because I was able to supply him with all of the rare plants used as potions ingredients that he needed.  Using some of the plants that have been extinct for ages, he was even able to come up with several of his own potions recipes.  Unfortunately, Salazar was a very private man and he never shared the recipes he created with anyone, so I fear many of his extremely useful creations died with him.”
“Patil, Parvati,” McGonagall called and Parvati was soon scheduled for the same classes and activities as her friend Lavender. McGonagall looked slightly disgusted as Parvati walked away and Harry figured it was probably because McGonagall had a feeling that Lavender and Parvati had only signed up for Archery and Fencing so that they could spend time gazing at the teachers, rather than an actual interest in the subjects.
“Please, Ginny, have a seat,” Harry said as temporarily ignored Ginny’s question and motioned to the chair across from him.
“I agree,” Bill said.  “Especially since I’m a professor and you’re a student.  The clause that Rowena added to the rules makes it legal, but some people will still disapprove.  I’m also not entirely sure how my family will react when they find out I’m dating a Slytherin.”
‘Wow,’ Harry thought.  ‘I hope that we find Slytherin’s quarters soon, because if he really was nearing being able to cure lycanthropy, then that means that Professor Lupin could be cured.  If I could help with that, I wouldn’t even care if I turned out to be Slytherin’s heir.’
Standing up to face Pansy, Adrian said, “Well, there you have it Pansy.  Draco said he was gay under the influence of Veritaserum and Blaise said that he did not force himself on Draco.  So, that should be enough for you.  The silencing spell will wear off in a few minutes.”
“Good, then if you could be so kind, please show Ryan and his guests to the bedrooms.  Please give Ryan the large room at the end of the hall, as he is now master of these quarters and it is only fitting that he has the master bedroom.”
“Kev, Steve, please tell me you two are not seriously thinking about going to the Ball that way?”  Ryan asked, as he finished combing his hair and turned away from the mirror.
He might not have any physical scars, but mental scars were another matter entirely and Tom was frequently plagued by nightmares of all the torture that Voldemort heaped on him.  He often prayed that death would just take him away from his hellish existence, but, should he ever be rescued, which he had long ago begun to doubt, he prayed that his rescuer would have the mercy to Obliviate him.
"I didn't need to know that," Charles said with a sigh. "Anyway, let's get down to business. Ryan, as you probably don't already know, this is Draco Malfoy."
“Ah, well that answers that,” Draco drawled.  “So, this peach is the gift to end all gifts you spoke of earlier?”
“Then we just need to brew the potion,” Salazar said, “and get Professor Snape to agree to donate a few drops of his blood.  Many of the potion’s ingredients are very rare, but that is not a problem in my private potions lab, because I charmed it so that it would have an infinite supply of every non-plant ingredient in existence.  I relied on Helga’s greenhouse for the plant ingredients to ensure freshness.”
“Voldemort is planning a raid on Inverness this weekend,” Snape said.  “He made it obvious that he intended to lead this raid himself, as he has been angry that the last few raids have been thwarted.”
“That is correct, Hat,” Rowena said.  “And yes, you have been lying for many, many years now.  I don’t blame you though, because it must have been Godric who changed your memories after the other founders and I passed away, but all these years you’ve been making Salazar Slytherin out to be a Muggle-hating monster, when in reality nothing could be further from the truth.”
Ginny looked confused, but nodded and followed Harry as he took off down the corridor.  Reaching the end of the corridor, Harry turned a corner and slipped behind an old tapestry that hid a staircase down to the sixth floor.  Of course, that wasn’t the only thing that it hid.
"Ah, I see why my family had a problem with it now," Draco said. "Dating a half-blood breaks about half a dozen rules listed in the Malfoy Family Code of Conduct."
Unlike Aarik Potter and Zacharias Smith, there are actually two heirs of Rowena Ravenclaw currently at Hogwarts.  The other heir is Kyrian’s cousin, Matthew William Cromwell, 20, who teaches an extra-curricular Music class to all interested Hogwarts students.  It is reported that Matthew is gay and engaged to Oliver Tristan Wood, 20.  In addition to teaching an extra-curricular Art class at Hogwarts, Mr. Wood is perhaps best known for his job as Reserve Keeper for the Puddlemere United Quidditch team.
“Well, what position do you play?”  Adrian asked after a moment.  He knew he couldn’t allow Lane to join the team, at least not without either Professor Snape’s or Professor Dumbledore’s approval, but he supposed there was no harm in at least letting the boy tryout if he really wanted to.
“You are so lucky that you’re a prefect, Weasley.  If you weren’t I’d be taking points from Gryffindor right now.”
“Our magical core is what provides us with the ability to sustain our lives past that of our human magical counterparts,” Corelian answered.  “I realize that I don’t look old, but I am actually older than Professor Dumbledore.  Without my magical core, though, I would be bound by the same lifespan of human witches and wizards, and no human witch or wizard, even Merlin himself, has ever lived to be as old as I am now.”
Draco nodded and this time it was his turn to look smug.  “What can I say?  I’m the master of the Slytherin betting pools.  Oh, Blaise is going to hate this.  He owes me another ten galleons.”
“I’ve temporarily staunched the bleeding, Mr. Malfoy,” Bill said as he placed his wand back in his robes, “but you’ll still want to have Madame Pomfrey take a look at that, so I’ll take you to the hospital wing.”
“So, that means that the six most powerful Olympians were Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Amphitrite, and Persephone?”
Seconds later, Argus Filch came around the corner and a smile spread across his face when he saw two students out of bed.
“Yes, he was, but Sirius didn’t kill him.  Peter is an unregistered Animagus.  Do you remember Ron’s pet rat?”
Over a month had passed, and it was now Friday, December Twentieth, 1996.  It was the final day of the fall term at Hogwarts.  The students who would be returning to their homes for the holidays would be leaving this afternoon and those staying behind would find the castle much quieter than normal.  Upon the start of the spring term, students in Professor Cromwell’s Music class would have to get used to calling him by a different name.  For in just three days, he would become Professor Matthew Cromwell-Wood, following his marriage to long-time boyfriend, Professor Oliver Wood.
“Helga is right, Godric,” Rowena said.  “Just because we’re portraits, doesn’t mean we can’t help.  We’re the ones who built this castle, after all, so we know all of its secrets.  Secrets, I’m sure, that even Professor Dumbledore, as the Headmaster, is unaware of.  We may not be able to offer any physical help, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t help in other ways.”
“Come, let us go outside to the gardens and watch the rare miracle of the Tree of Life blooming,” Asheera said.  “It is certainly something that none of us will live to see again.”
“I’m sorry, Justin,” Ryan apologized.  “I’m sure you’re great, of course, I don’t know that.  I do want to get to know you a bit better though, before we, well, you know.”
"Damn Blaise," Draco moaned.  "You'd think that with as many times as we've done this, you would have loosened up a little bit."
"Puppies!"  Draco cried gleefully as he knelt down to get a better look at the small black and white animals.
Harry looked at Professor Lasinius for a moment, not understanding what the professor wanted him to do, but then he understood.
“You got me a gift?”  Zach asked.  “Now I feel bad because I didn’t get you anything.  I tried, but I figured what could I possibly get for the boy who already has too much of everything?”
“Whatever,” Harry said as he stood to leave. “I’d better get going, before I’m missed. I’ll see you in class tomorrow, Professor Weasley. Oh, by the way, I wasn’t originally planning on taking Potions this year, so can I borrow a copy of Advanced Potion Making and use the school ingredients? At least until I can order some from Diagon Alley?”
Not giving Godric the chance to say anything, Nick left the room, followed by everyone else.  Of course, Rowena and Helga stayed to continue chewing Godric out.
“I also need candles and roses,” Aarik said, “for both the dining room and the master bedroom.  Oh, and some fresh strawberries with bowls of whipped cream and chocolate sauce, would be nice.”
Harry was almost out the door when he heard Draco quietly say, “Harry, wait.” It was said so quietly that Harry wasn’t even sure if he had heard it properly. He turned to face Draco and said, “What did you say?”
“I sure did,” Ryan answered as turned a few pages and then tapped the book in front of him.  “Listen to this.  Thornton Edmund Cromnvell, born 1470, died 1603; married 1497 to Fiona Cordelia Ravenclaw, born 1475, died 1621; one child, Edmund Charles Cromnvell, born 1500, died 1630.”
"Yes, I am," answered McGonagall.  "It's been awhile.  My condolences regarding your mother, she will be dearly missed."
Muggle archaeologists are incapable of reaching the areas that curse-breakers like me work in because the areas are hidden behind several layers of ancient and very complex magic.  They don’t realize it of course, but many of the tombs they thought had been looted and desecrated by tomb robbers were not entirely empty.  In most cases, the majority of the Pharaohs’ treasure and their mummies were placed behind so many layers of magic that the average tomb robber, the majority of which were Muggles, would have died long before reaching them.
Anyway, I've realized that nervousness may have played a small part, but it certainly wasn't the reason that the kiss went as badly as it did. On Cho's part, I think she would much rather have been kissing Cedric, and I've come to realize that I would much rather have been kissing a guy. I think the whole reason I ever started going out with Cho in the first place was because somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew I was gay and I was determined not to admit it, so I managed to convince myself that I wanted Cho.
Katie sighed and said, “That explains a lot.  I’ve heard rumors that Colin’s photography club is a front for an unofficial Harry Potter fan club.”
“How’d you know he was coming?”  Ryan whispered as pulled his hood back just enough to reveal his face.
Dumbledore and Pomfrey turned towards the doors as they opened and they lead the group into a large room, very different from the Great Hall that the students had gotten to know so well during their time at Hogwarts.
“Yes, you are,” a voice next to him said and Ryan jumped a bit when he felt a pair of arms wrapping around him.
“Well, my boy, if you would go and find Helga’s quarters, you could speak to two of them,” Rowena urged.
“Let’s see here, Charms, Defense against the Dark Arts, and Herbology all fine, Potter. I was very happy about your grade in my class, so you’re clear to take that as well. Now, I’ve noticed that you haven’t signed up for Potions, despite your ‘Outstanding.’ I thought it was your ambition to be an Auror?”
"Try this one," Ollivander said as he handed the wand to Narcissa.  "It's a nice and pliable fir - 10 inches with the heartstring of a Peruvian Vipertooth."
“Hmm, well, I suppose that does make sense.  It is rather hard to find something when you don’t even know it’s there.  I suppose the founders could even have laid some sort of magic into the rooms to make it so that the heir had to know it existed before they could find it.  Headmistress Derwent knew of the possibility that the rooms existed, but never found anything because she wasn’t an heir.”
“Now, Hermione, you said you had clues to the identities of the other founders’ heirs?”  Dumbledore asked.
“Thank you, Mr. Pucey,” McGonagall said, as she got a thoughtful look on her face.  “I take it you all were also responsible for all the Patronusses that I saw come out of here?”
“Yeah, Rick,” said Zach.  “This is actually kind of nice, because maybe if I know a bit more of what to expect, I won’t fear death so much.”
“You know, I haven’t said anything,” Ryan said, “but this whole long lifespan thing has been on my mind ever since I found out about it and I’m really beginning to get upset about it.”
“Draco Lucien Malfoy, you must have been crazy to even consider this,” Draco said to himself.  Then after a few deep breaths, he said, “Well, I’m here now, so I might as well do what I came to do.”
“Because when it is taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence. It is also highly toxic in large doses, so it’s best to take it sparingly.”
Poppy gave Draco a stern look that made it quite clear that he could argue all he wanted, but she wasn’t going to change her mind.
“Because it means that I’m going to have to watch all of my friends, my family, and Justin get old and die, while I stay young and alive for centuries longer.”
I have made a new ally among the sixth-year girls at least in the form of Tracey Davis. She’s always been good friends with Daphne and she assures me that I can trust Tracey. Daphne has also assured me that I can trust Adrian Pucey, the Head Boy this year, as the two of them have been dating now since the beginning of summer. I haven’t really had the chance to talk to him and see for myself yet, but it’s definitely something I’ll do. I’m a Slytherin after all, so I understand the importance of having powerful and influential friends, and as Head Boy, Pucey does fit the bill.
“Oh Gods, Potter, are you really as stupid as you sound?  I’ve told you that my father punished me whenever I did something he didn’t like.  Well, it was for that reason that I have always acted a certain way in public.  If I hadn’t gotten mad about his imprisonment and he found out that I didn’t, he would probably have killed me for disloyalty.”
On Saturday morning, the Seventeenth of November, students coming into the entry hall immediately saw a few big differences.  Under the large house point hourglasses there were now four life size portraits of the Founders.  Of course, that wasn’t the only thing causing murmurs among the students, for there was also a bright green flyer tacked up on the message board.
“Thanks,” Nick said with a smile, as he tucked the locket back into his shirt and the two of them continued their run.
Walking into the office, Snape dropped into the large armchair in front of Dumbledore’s desk and before the old man could say anything, Snape reached into the folds of his robe and grabbed a vial from the dragonhide potions carrier he kept there.  Uncorking it, Snape downed a potion, at which point he hurled the now empty vial across the room, where it shattered in the flames of Dumbledore’s fireplace.
"Kingsley, you're an Auror," Dumbledore answered.  "Can you think of no Dark Arts spell that could keep a person the age they were when they were imprisoned?"
“As punishment, he was cast into Tartarus, while still alive, as both ruler and prisoner.  The Olympians chained him to Hades’ ebony throne and made him immortal.  They then cast a powerful spell on him that would cause him to change from a human to a skeleton of gigantic proportions.  Now, this transformation was extremely painful and very slow; it took a thousand years to be completed – one year for each innocent person that Valshar had tortured and killed.  To best understand how painful, imagine the pain of the Cruciatus Curse, multiplied by a hundred and applied non-stop for a thousand years.  That amount of pain would have been more then enough to kill him, but as the Olympians made him immortal, he had no choice but to endure it.”
Both professors nodded, before Aurora Sinistra hurried into the castle to collect Asheera, and Septima Vector motioned for James, Lily, Cedric, and Narcissa to follow her, as Dumbledore lead Draco and the Heads of House to his office.
"Love you too, grandmother," Nicolas said as he gave her a quick hug, before following Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ryan towards the carriages.
Before Dumbledore could reach the newcomers, Professor Valen Lasinius was standing in front of them with his hands on his hips and said in a voice that was easily heard throughout the quiet Hall, “Corelian, you old fool, you always did have a flair for the dramatic.”
Arriving in the dungeons, Nick led the group down past the blank wall that led into the Slytherin common room, turned the corner, and went down an easily missed flight of stairs in an alcove in the next corridor.  Unlike the other founders’ quarters, where the entrance was on the same floor as their house common room, Slytherin’s was a floor below.
“No, I didn’t,” Draco said in a slightly hesitant voice, obviously trying to cover up the fact that he actually had said Harry instead of Potter.
“Ryan Cromwell is Ravenclaw’s heir, Zacharias Smith is Hufflepuff’s heir, Harry Potter is Gryffindor’s heir, and I am Slytherin’s heir,” Nick answered.
"Well, yes, actually, she was," Charles said finally. "He wasn't known as Voldemort then, of course, but yes, as much as it sickens me to say it, your grandmother was romantically involved with him for about a year."
Voldemort chuckled and said, “Good thinking, you stupid little whelp.  Just for that, I won’t use the Cruciatus on you today.  I’ll just use it twice on one of the other house-elves instead.”
“So, you mean you weren’t a pampered prince growing up?”  Draco asked.  “I don’t mean to offend you or anything; it’s just a commonly held belief that as The-Boy-Who-Lived you were treated like a prince.”
Minutes after the tragedy at Malfoy Manor, Draco emerges from the fireplace in the drawing room of Cromwell Hall, followed shortly there after by a loud pop as Charles apparates into the room.
"Draco will be living here now," Charles said and held up a hand to his son. "I can tell by the look on your face that you would like an explanation as to why Draco will be living here. I will gladly give that explanation, although first I think you owe me an explanation."
“These optional earrings,” Corelian said, “are what most Atlanteans use concealment charms on.  It’s illegal to conceal the rings and while you can conceal the bracelet, clothing generally covers it, so few wear a concealment charm on it.  The earrings, however, can be concealed if you don’t want others to know that you opted to use the optional jewelry.  For those who do use the optional jewelry, they can choose to perform that part of the ceremony in the privacy of a back room, so that only the couple and officiate knows that the optional jewelry was used.  At which point the concealments charms would be used.  For those who don’t care if other people know about it, they can do it in front of the wedding guests, although they can still use the concealment charms if they don’t want people who were not invited to the wedding to know.  As I mentioned earlier, vanity may also play a part and people will conceal the earrings simply because they don’t like wearing jewelry.”
“Of course, once the transformation was complete,” Asheera said, “the Olympians had a new punishment in store for Valshar.  One that they neglected to tell him about, choosing instead to torture him further by allowing him to think that once the thousand years had ended, his only punishment would be that he’d still be chained to the throne of Tartarus for eternity.”
“Anxious is an understatement, Harry,” Ryan said.  “Rowena has been talking about little else since we found out you were Godric’s heir.”
“Yes, Dad,” Alaric answered.  “I mean Voldemort.  When he helped you breed that basilisk and to place the necessary enchantments to keep it alive long enough for Tom to find it, he cast extra spells that would allow him to return to the Chamber upon Tom’s arrival.  He killed the rooster, imprisoned Tom under the Dark Arts prison version of the Time Suspension charm, and then assumed Tom’s identity.”
"Draco, you will do as I say," Lucius said in a cold and unfeeling tone.  "That runt is the weakest, and therefore must be exterminated.  It's survival of the fittest.  The same goes for us, Draco.  It’s our duty, as purebloods, to exterminate all those who are weaker than us.  That means Muggles, Half-Bloods and Mudbloods."
“It’s okay,” Ryan said.  “I was just hoping that my father might be a bit more knowledgeable about the topic at hand.”
Draco thought about it for a moment and decided that there really wasn’t any harm in telling Asheera what was on his mind.  Maybe she’d even have an idea for the perfect gift for his beloved Aarik.
“No, he wasn’t,” Asheera said.  “According to the ancient texts, Hades was so angry with Amphitrite that he physically attacked her, greatly angering Poseidon.  Hades and Poseidon were soon throwing vast amounts of magic at one another.  To help you picture the power involved here, the spells that Poseidon and Hades were using against each other could easily have reduced Mt. Everest to a pile of dust.  Zeus certainly wasn’t going to just stand there and let them fight, so he called upon his own vast powers to put an end to it.  Once everyone was settled down again, Poseidon was so angry with Hades that he changed his vote, making the final vote five to two in favor of Persephone’s proposal.”
“Fiona never married nor had children, Connor’s line died out in 1292 and Brendan’s line died out in 1398.  So, Kayne and Fiona Ravenclaw, born 1470 and 1475, are descended from Brandon Ravenclaw.  Up until that point, it looks like the births of Kayne and Fiona was the first time that Brandon’s line ever produced more than one heir in a single generation.  Kayne’s son Connor’s only child, a son named Ross, died when he was 10 and the only other Ravenclaw heirs listed after Fiona are all Cromwells, so I guess that means my family owns Raven Hill.”
“Redintegro Bibliotheca!” the six students said once again in unison and they could all feel a much larger amount of their power going into the spell as the blue arc that Rowena mentioned formed above their heads and all the books in the library suddenly glowed bright blue for a few seconds.
Of course, I never shared any of this research with Lucius, as he would be apt to do several things. One would be to tell me that I'm wrong, two would be to present a bunch of fancy words and explanations to try and falsify the research, and third, place me under the Cruciatus Curse as punishment for daring to even question what he had been teaching me. If it wasn't for my mother's love, I don't know how I would ever have survived as long as I have. Without her, I think I would have either been a cold and totally unfeeling jackass like Lucius or I simply would have been dead by now.
The screams drew the attention of Professor Dumbledore, who ran into the room and seeing what was happening shouted, “Finite Incantatem!” pointing at Adrian, and “Expelliarmus!” at Nott.  Nott’s wand flew out of his hand and into Professor Dumbledore’s.  There was no trace of the normally jovial headmaster, only cold fury and many of the students backed away from the old man, completely terrified.
“You’ll what, Malfoy?” Harry asked when Draco trailed off. “Hex me into next week? You’re welcome to try.”
“Could you please spell your name, third visitor?”  The welcome witch asked and it was obvious that she was annoyed that anyone coming through the Visitor’s Entrance would have an unusual enough name that she had to ask for the spelling.
Just last night, Harry had a chat with Ryan who informed him that he was dating Justin Finch-Fletchley now and that Draco had caught them snogging in a broom cupboard on the third floor the previous night.  Harry was frankly surprised that the news wasn’t all over the school now and that Draco didn’t take any points or attempt to get Ryan and Justin in trouble.  Harry knew that Justin was a prefect now, so he knew that Draco couldn’t take points from him, but that doesn’t mean he couldn’t take points from Ryan.  They were family, yes, but Harry never would have believed that fact alone would stop Draco from getting anyone in trouble.
“I’m sorry you feel that way, Ronald,” Hermione said, hoping that she would be able to make him see reason without going as far as she was prepared to go.  Of course, this was Ronald Weasley and she knew that he was a blockhead at the best of times.  So be it.  “Until you are willing to put your anger aside and trust Harry’s judgment, I’m afraid I can’t be with you anymore.”
Ron seriously doubted that there was a gift that Draco could give Aarik that would prove to him that Draco was not a carbon copy of Lucius Malfoy and a Junior Death Eater.  However, out of respect for his years of friendship with Aarik, he decided to keep his mouth shut for now.
The three of them watched as King Tyriand sat upon his throne, looking as if he was patiently waiting for something to happen.  Soon enough, the doors of the throne room opened and Corelian walked into the room.  Ryan and Justin could see that Corelian did not look the slightest bit pleased as he bowed to his King.
Blaise just nodded, so Draco eased his way in further until he was buried to the hilt inside the boy beneath him.  What followed was a collection of moans and groans as the two teenage boys satisfied their needs at a frenzied pace.
“Yeah, it’s true, Blaise,” Harry said.  “In addition to finding out that my name is Aarik Potter I also found out that I’m related to Godric Gryffindor.  I met him last night.  He’s actually not the nicest of people.”
"You had better succeed," Voldemort said, his ominous red eyes flashing cold fury, "or I will make you wish you had never been born!"
“Why did it take so long for you to come back?”  Ryan asked.  “I mean, you returned to Atlantis to avoid dying and all that, I get that.  But why did it take sixteen years for you to come back?”
“Hmm,” the student whispered to them self.  “The Dark Lord will be very interested in this information, I think.”
“As for you, Fierna, you’ve been extremely quick to befriend my dear Glasya, and I cannot help but suspect that you have ulterior motives. Perhaps you’ve grown tired of sharing authority with your father and thought to learn Glasya’s weaknesses, so that you can take the throne of Malbolge for yourself? As if I would ever allow such insolence!”
“I think you look ridiculous,” Michael replied, “but it’s up to you.  If you two want to wear matching pink robes, then I won’t stop you.”
"The Dark Marks," Severus answered.  "As long as there's even one marked Death Eater alive, Voldemort can't be sent back to the Hells."
“Oh, yeah,” Draco said.  “I nearly forgot about that.  I imagine that will be strange for both you and Tom.”
Waiting a few more moments, the sound of gushing water diminished and soon stopped all together.  It was obvious that the room outside the lift was now holding as much of the ocean water as it would hold.
Bellatrix nodded.  “As am I, Lucius.  Before today I thought he was a weak and pathetic little wretch that didn’t deserve to live for his refusal to take the Mark.  Now though, I find myself happy to know that my nephew isn’t bound to that fiend as we are.”
“I knew there was a reason I loved you,” Ryan said as he kissed Justin on the cheek. “Come on you two.”
Hermione nodded, as Harry stood and held out a hand to Hermione, before the two of them returned to the dance floor.
“Then that is why you have access to this room, Harry.  Ryan told you to follow him, which the room’s magic took as an invitation.  Only Ryan can open the door into this room, however, as an invited guest, the room will allow you to enter from now on without a word from Ryan, unless of course he asks you to leave and not return at which point the room’s magic would evict you and not allow you to enter again until invited.”
"Try this one," Ollivander said.  "10 1/2 inches, nice and swishy, holly, with a unicorn tail core."
In other news, dear journal, I think I might stand a chance with Harry after all.  I haven’t heard it from his own lips that he’s gay, but he did seem very happy when he found out that same-sex relationships were not only accepted in the wizarding world, but that same-sex couples could legally marry and have children.  If he is indeed gay, then I suppose I can understand why he would be happy about that, since I’m sure that as an orphan he wants children.  I just pray with every fiber of my being that if Harry does have children that I will be the other father.
Pansy looked stricken, to which Adrian just grinned and said, “I think it best that I be the only one who can ask the questions.  I’m sure you understand, Pansy.  If not, well, then I can always give you detention with Filch for interfering in official Head Boy business and you know that Professor Snape will believe me over you.”
"Oh Gods, NO!" Ryan exclaimed as he dashed from the living room and bolted up the stairs with Frances following close behind. Arriving in Lucinda's bedroom, it was just as Frances had said. Lucinda was lying on the bed, eyes closed, and as Ryan sat down next to her and grabbed her hand, he realized that she was indeed dead, as her hand was ice cold. Having always been very close to his grandmother, as she was the only mother he'd ever known, he threw himself down on her chest and began sobbing.
“Ah, I see,” said Helga.  “Well, then, if it wasn’t for Rowena’s spell, even Shakespeare would probably have had a hard time understanding us, seeing as how Rowena and I lived in the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries.”
Hermione just laughed and then said, "Oh, fine, Harry. I suppose reading something is better than nothing at all. If you ever get tired of reading such things though and want to read something with a bit more substance, let me know. I'm sure I can recommend some good books."
Even with the knowledge that Draco wouldn’t awaken anytime soon, Harry simply pulled up a chair, sat down next to the bed, and just began to watch the blond’s chest rising and falling.  He was so mesmerized by the movement that he didn’t notice the other person enter the room.
“I can see that I’m not getting you anywhere with you, Minister,” Corelian said as he stood up.  “I guess I shall be on my way then.”
"Matt, are you sure that you were a Ravenclaw?" Ryan asked. "I wasn't talking about the weather, you dolt. I meant, what is the gay population like at Hogwarts? As in very small or what?"
Looking around the room, Rufus grunted and said, “I do hope that you have more to show us.  So far, you’ve only proved that you’re insanely wealthy.”
“Yes, she did,” answered Remus.  “Aarik Evans was Lily’s favorite cousin.  He was not a wizard, but they still got along really well.  In all honesty, they were more like brother and sister then cousins, certainly much closer then Lily and Petunia ever were.  He probably would have been named your godfather, but he unfortunately contracted a rare form of leukemia and died a few months before you were born.  Lily then named you Aarik in honor of him.”
Ryan had yet to tell Matt and Oliver about being Ravenclaw's heir, but that was because he hadn't been successful in getting them alone long enough to tell them. Tonight, he had decided to risk getting in trouble and go to their shared quarters in the staff wing. Justin agreed to go with him, partly for moral support, but also because Ryan had decided that it was time to tell Matt and Oliver about his relationship with Justin.
"Yes, Mr. Ollivander," Helga said.  "I'm Helga Hufflepuff, one of the four founders of this school and the founder of the house you yourself were in I believe."
“It slipped out?”  Draco repeated.  “Bloody hell, Blaise, I’ve just managed to become friends with him.  Thanks a lot, Blaise, because I’m sure he probably wants nothing to do with me now that he knows about my feelings.”
“Now as for Keeper,” Adrian said looking at Eric Harper and Lane Waters, “you were both very good, but I think you did the best job, Mr. Waters.  I’ll talk with the professors and see if they’ll agree to let you join the team.  If not, then the position is yours Mr. Harper.  If Mr. Waters does get the position, then you’ll definitely be my first choice for an alternate, Mr. Harper, so I’ll want you at all of our practices and the same goes for you Miss Atkins, Mr. Pritchard, and Mr. Baddock.”
Reaching for his wand, Draco waved his wand over Blaise’s abdomen and muttered the incantation for the cleaning charm that was suggested be used prior to anal intercourse in the book, ‘A Wizard’s Guide to Sex with other Wizards.’ Draco and Blaise were quite glad that they took the time to read it before their first time, because it offered many tips on what to do and want not to do that made the whole process a lot easier and less painful for both of them. Draco waved his wand again to cast a lubrication charm, before he returned his wand to the nightstand.
"Yes, I do," Nicolas said. "In fact Gabrielle had a crush on me at school last year and was trying to get me to date her."
“Well, Harry, I should think it’s obvious,” Bill said.  “Of all the people on staff, Valen is the only one close to my age, well, other than Matthew and Oliver, but they’re engaged, so I wasn’t about to ask one of them.  After that the next person closest to my age would be Professor Snape and I wouldn’t ask him out if he was the last man on the planet.”
At the look that Bill gave his fellow professor, Valen chuckled and said, “I’m only kidding, Bill.  Nick isn’t really my type.”
When Draco didn’t say anything, Harry took a few steps closer, knelt beside him, and said, “I’m sorry about your mum.”
Adrian looked at Crabbe and Goyle, looking as stupid and clueless as they always did, and it was then that he realized something.  Looking at Damien and Michael, his glare accusing, he said, “You know, half the time I’m surprised that Crabbe and Goyle are smart enough to use their bats to hit the Bludgers instead of their own heads.  They couldn’t possibly have come up with this idea to attack Draco all by themselves.  Did you two have something to do with this?”
“The Headmaster will have to answer that one,” Remus said with a grin as he turned to look at the Headmaster.
YOUR FATHER AND I ARE SO DISGUSTED WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.  I SO HOPE THAT THIS HOWLER FINDS YOU IN A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEN MAYBE YOU WILL FEEL JUST A LITTLE SHRED OF THE EMBARRASSMENT THAT YOUR FATHER AND I FEEL RIGHT NOW!
Looking at the clock on the fireplace mantle, Oliver said, “Well, we have half-an-hour now, we should probably be going.”
“We didn’t discuss who would be in the class,” Valen said, as he sat down on a nearby empty bed, “but yes, I assume that Mr. Potter will be in the class.  I should think all of the heirs will be.”
As for the other founder’s heirs, Hogwarts student Zacharias Ethan Smith, 17, has been revealed as the heir of Helga Marie Hufflepuff.  Zacharias is the younger cousin of Cedric Jeremiah Diggory, who died two years ago following the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, during which time, according to Aarik Potter and Albus Dumbledore, You-Know-Who returned to power and his body.  Reports from Hogwarts say that Zacharias is openly bisexual, although he is currently single.
“Voldemort will probably kill him when he realizes the deception,” Dumbledore said.  “At which point if we ever do find a way to rescue Sirius from beyond Baazlebul’s Veil, he would still be considered a criminal in the eyes of the Ministry.”
“You all are my witnesses,” Ginny said as she looked at the others at the table.  “Ronnie actually admitted he’s an idiot.”
Looking at the boy, Adrian surmised that despite his youth, he might actually make a good Keeper.  He was rather tall for his age and he had long arms, which would be good for keeping the Quaffle away from the hoops.
“Would you like some tea and biscuits?” Oliver asked as he motioned to the tray on a nearby side table.
“Justin, that is the reason wizards don’t have a problem with it,” Draco revealed.  “There’s a spell which allows two wizards or two witches to have biological children together.  In the case of wizards, a surrogate mother has to be used since men can’t carry children, but the end result is the same: a happy, healthy child, the only difference being that it has two biological fathers and no biological mother.”
Even though he knew that it was irrational for thinking such things, for a long time Harry felt as if he was the only person in the world experiencing the feelings that he was having.  He felt so alone, and with nobody around to talk about it to, he figured that if he pushed it down far enough, he could be normal.
“You’re right, I did say that and it’s true.  When I died, the protective magic of my quarters kicked in immediately and unfortunately, the portrait version of me was here in my quarters at the time.  So, the magic effectively trapped me here and prevented Brendan or anyone else from coming to visit me.”
“That’s where you are wrong, Hermione,” said Helga.  “Payment does not always come in the form of money.  It can also come in the form of a roof over one’s head and food in one’s stomach, which no matter how they may treat their house-elves, all wizarding families who own them provide food and shelter to their elves.”
“Oh, yeah thanks a lot.  I’m here with a broken toe, I’m dying here and you’re laughing,” Draco whined.
‘I like the way you think,’ Corelian thought.  Without a word, Corelian cast a silencing charm, followed by a powerful charm to lock the Minister’s office door.
"Ah, welcome to Hogwarts," Dumbledore said as McGonagall walked into his office with Charles, Ryan, Professor Byrne, and Nicolas.  "If you will all please have a seat, we'll get started."  He paused, indicating the chairs before his desk, and they sat down.  "Would anyone like some tea?  Or perhaps a lemon drop?"
“As you can see from my visitor’s badge,” Corelian said, “My name is Lord Corelian Laitannen and you can’t arrest me because I have diplomatic immunity.”
Harry and Ryan then set to work casting cleaning charms and vanishing the dust and cobwebs.  After about twenty minutes, the room looked much better then it had.  Rowena’s portrait smiled at Ryan and said, “Much better.  Now, did you want to clean up the other rooms or did you want to see about finding out the identities of the other heirs?”
"An owl just arrived for you, dear," Narcissa said. "Judging by the seal on the back, I'm pretty sure it's your OWL results."
The voice belonged to the large and bulky mass of a man that was Harry's uncle, Vernon Dursley. Vernon, his wife Petunia, and their equally bulky son Dudley were sitting at the dining room table, having just finished dinner. The Dursleys hated having Harry in their home, so, over the past month or so, they'd gotten into the habit of eating dinner without him. They would then have him come downstairs, clear the table, wash the dishes, and then he could eat the leftovers of the night's meal. Of course, that was assuming there was anything left after Dudley finished eating.
“Aarik!”  Draco exclaimed.  “I’m insulted!  Rule #71 of the Malfoy Code clearly states that Malfoys do not steal what doesn’t belong to them, without good reason at least.  Of course, Rule #72 goes on to explain that good reason is trying to purchase it and having all offers rejected.”
Looking at them, Ollivander smiled and said, "You know, it's a good thing that my Healer recently told me that my heart is as healthy as a twenty-year-old's, because if it wasn't, I'm sure I'd be having a heart attack right now."
As Lily and James took time to digest Draco's words, Cedric broke the silence by saying, "Aarik, I want you to know that it wasn't your fault that I died and that if I'd been capable of remembering the circumstances of my death before now, I would never have blamed you for it."
The gathered students all began to file out of the entry hall and began to go back to what they were doing.
“You’re not helping Colin by trying to dispel the charm,” Harry said as Andrew’s wand flew into Harry’s awaiting hand.  “The creator of the spell made it resistant to all spells meant to dispel magical effects.  The spell normally lasts for fifteen minutes and the only way to stop it is to let it run its’ course.  Every dispel attempt makes the spell last an additional fifteen minutes, so you’ve just added thirty minutes to Colin’s mouth-washing session.”
“Yes, Serena,” Corelian said with a smile, before addressing all the members, “Members of the Circle, the sanity of everyone in Atlantis has been called into question.  The people of Wizarding Britain think that everyone who thinks Atlantis survived the sinking are crazy.  Already here is British Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour.  Our benevolent King and Queen are going to personally give him a tour of Atlantis to prove that we Atlanteans are not crazy.  However, the Minister is only one man, and our wise King hypothesizes that the Minister’s word alone will not be enough to convince the populace of Wizarding Britain.  So, I will give you each the name of a person and the place in Britain they can most likely be found, at which point I want you to bring them here post haste.”
The Founders were adamant that their heirs go on the mission as well, so the four heirs were put through four nights of extensive training sessions to prepare them as much as possible.  Draco Malfoy was included in the training sessions, as he also went on the mission, because a member of the Malfoy family was necessary to get the rescue group past the wards surrounding the mansion.
“I don’t know, to be honest,” Asheera said.  “I don’t even know exactly what happened to him, but I’ll do my best to assist in any way I can.”
“Wake up you little wretch,” Voldemort shouted as he entered the room where his teenage prisoner has been held for over half a century.  “I said wake up!  Crucio!”
Rather than addressing Ron, Colin looked directly at Harry and said, “You are Harry Potter, well, Aarik Potter, The-Boy-Who-Lived!  The public has a right to know everything there is to know about you.”
“Nick told us actually. He’s friends with her little sister Gabrielle. She told Nick in a letter that Fleur was engaged to her mate now.”
"I can understand all of you being shocked," Molly said with a knowing smile.  "Arthur and I were quite shocked when Albus told us - of course, that was nothing compared to how Amos and Hannah Diggory reacted."
“Yes, a truce.  Perhaps even be friends with time, of course, that’s assuming you can refrain from insulting my friends.”
Following the incident with Colin getting permission to enter Gryffindor’s quarters without Harry knowing about it, all four heirs returned to their ancestor’s quarters and rescinded all permissions that they granted since the nights each of them found the rooms.
Dumbledore didn't wait for any response to his question before continuing, "So, at any rate, in the eyes of the Ministry, Sirius is still a convicted felon, regardless of the fact that he fell through the veil while fighting Death Eaters. So, as a convicted felon, the Ministry believed his estate to be property which they could seize for themselves. As Sirius named me the executor of his will, I've been doing everything in my power to convince them that they should just allow his estate to be divided as he wished. In the end, and I am ashamed to admit it, but I had to resort to a more underhanded approach to get Cornelius to agree."
“First you call me by my first name,” Harry said. “Then you apologize to me. Forgive me, but I never thought I’d live to see either of those things happening.”
"Well then, go pack that trunk of yours, boy, and good riddance!" Vernon said as he threw the letter back at Harry. Harry just smiled sweetly at his hated relatives before turning around and leaving the room.
“Does that mean that Atlantis will be unable to help Britain in the war with You-Know-Who?”  Madam Rosmerta asked.
“First off, I would ask that you not call me ‘boy,’” Corelian said.  “Secondly, I am more than old enough to be an ambassador.  I am, in fact, older than you.”
“Yes, well, it’s not something that I tend to talk about,” Angelique said.  “Most people would think that anyone who studied Demonology in university was evil.  The truth is I studied it because I thought it was a natural extension to my study of magical creatures, because devils are among the most magical creatures in existence.”
“He’s Harry’s number one fan,” Seamus said.  “He’s asked me on more then one occasion for information on Harry, but I’ve never told him anything.”
“Thank you,” Corelian said with a smile to the secretary, before walking into the Minister’s office.
Most of the other students were all in their dorms packing, as the professors would be putting the students onto the carriages to take them down to Hogsmeade in a few hours.  Draco was alone in the bell tower.  Hardly anyone ever came into the tower and Draco often went there when he wanted time to himself to think.  Lost in thought, Draco didn’t hear anyone enter the room.
“Yes, I do,” answered Dumbledore as he stood from his desk and collected the item from the cabinet where he kept it.  Placing it on his desk, Dumbledore took a moment to empty his own memories from it, before he sat down and nodded to Corelian.
Also, I would like to impress upon you that you must have a sense of good sportsmanship to be chosen for the team.  Nobody who thinks that former Slytherin team members Urquhart, Vaisey, Crabbe and Goyle were justified in attacking team member Draco Malfoy because of who he chooses to date is welcome to tryout.
As the kiss ended, Draco looked at Blaise, sending him a silent plea to play along, to which Blaise nodded imperceptibly.
Ryan, Justin, Nick, Bill, Zach, and Hermione entered the room and the fireplace in the Gryffindor common room moved back into place, hiding the archway from sight.
“Yes, here you are,” Madame Pomfrey agreed.  “Well, I can let you all in to see him, but I don’t want you starting anything, Mr. Potter.”
“That is true,” Salazar said.  “I just want to make sure that my secret recipes don’t fall into the wrong hands.  You are a marked Death Eater are you not?  Which means you must see Voldemort from time to time and I would not want him learning my secrets.”
“Why don’t you look at some of the other listings?”  Brendan asked.  “See if you can find clues on whom the other heirs are.”
At the stroke of seven, the doors to the Great Hall opened and Professor Dumbledore and Madam Pomfrey appeared in the doorway.
“He’s been acting like a jerk lately,” Hermione said.  “He’s mad because Harry befriended Draco and has not only been giving Harry the silent treatment, but has made a point to leave the room when Harry comes in.”
“Oh please, that’s an excuse and you know it,” Alaric said.  “The private lessons were your idea, in case you forgot.  You told dad that you were going to tutor me in Defense Against the Dark Arts so that I would be ahead of my year when I started school.  When Dad announced his intentions to do the same in Potions, you encouraged him to do it, because it did your pride a favor to think that your son would be one of the most advanced students in his year.”
Draco didn’t really react and just went to the indicated table and sat down.  To be honest, he looked a little sick and Harry guessed that it might have something to do with the article in the Prophet this morning.  Not wanting to cause a scene, despite his displeasure at having to sit next to Malfoy for the year, Harry just sat down at the desk.
Draco closed his Arithmancy book, stood up and said, “Pansy, if you are referring to the fact that you think I should ask you to the Halloween Ball, that isn’t going to happen.  I’m gay, remember?”
Goyle dropped to his knees as a wave of pain washed over his body. Most people might scream from it, but all of Voldemort's Death Eaters have learned not to scream when he inflicts pain on them because it'll only make him even angrier. Or madder, depending on how you look at it, considering that most people, including some of his Death Eaters have begun to think Voldemort is quite insane, not that they'd ever dare to tell him that. After a moment, Voldemort stopped the curse and yelled, "Get out of my sight. Wormtail!"
Corelian opened the door of the box, allowing Matthew and Oliver to enter first, before he entered himself.  It wasn’t nearly as tight a fit as Corelian had thought it might be.  The box was obviously magically enlarged on the inside, making it much more roomy then it appeared to be from outside.  Picking up the receiver, Matthew dialed the numbers 6-2-4-4-2.
The real Thomas Byrne was the son of Jean-Michel Byrne, who was actually Professor Byrne’s step-son - her late husband Maxwell’s son from a previous marriage.  Thomas had never left the family home in Marseille since the day he was born, as he had always been a very sickly boy, born with a very rare genetic disorder.  His healers have often said that he should not have lived to see the age of five, let alone sixteen.  Professor Byrne consulted Jean-Michel, and both he and the real Thomas gave their blessings for Tom Riddle to use Thomas’ identity in order to protect him from Voldemort.
“I swear to you, Tom, you’re the only one I want,” Zach said.  “I’m not going to pretend that it will always be that way, because we are both still young and it’s possible our feelings could change.  We have not known each other very long, after all, but I would never cheat on anybody that I was with.  If my feelings for someone changed, I would sit down with that person and exhaust all possible avenues of rectifying the problem and if that didn’t work, then and only then would I break up with them, but I would never, ever cheat on anybody.”
“Well, it is against the rules,” Bill said.  “Though I really do wish I knew who added the clause saying that it was okay if the student was seventeen or older.  I’d love to thank them, of course, then again, they’re probably long dead and I won’t be able to.”
“No, Ryan, we don’t,” Matt said. “I know grandmother didn’t raise you to tell lies, so come one, just admit that you’re kidding and let’s move on.”
“The only foolishness going on here, Pansy is yours,” Blaise said.  “In case you haven’t noticed, everyone in the room is listening to this conversation and I’m sure they’re all thinking that you’re a complete and total idiot to continue thinking that Draco is going to ask you to the dance despite all the evidence to the contrary.”
“Yes,” Scrimgeour said immediately.  “If the Muggles knew about our society, they’d probably hunt us down and kill all of us, just as they tried to do so many years ago during the witch hunts.  Barring that, they’d probably expect us to agree to be under their jurisdiction, obey their laws, pay their taxes, and that is simply not something that I can allow to happen.”
“Is there something wrong with our attire?”  Stephen asked, as he did the same thing as his boyfriend.
While the second group went to Honeydukes Sweetshop, the first group went to Gladrags Wizardwear.  Professor Dumbledore had informed the proprietress of the shop ahead of time about the Halloween Ball, and she in turn ordered a wide selection of the very latest styles of formal attire.
“Oh I know I am,” Voldemort said.  “At any rate, I’m winning the war.  It’s only a matter of time before the Light falls, the Dark will rule for eternity, and I will finally get what I’ve wanted all these years!  I will rule not only Earth, but under my guidance it will become the Tenth Hell, deepest of the Hells, and I will therefore be Lord and Master of all the Hells.  That my boy is power beyond that which you can imagine and nobody will be able to stop me.”
“I think not,” Corelian said as he turned away from Rufus, bowed to his King and Queen and said, “Your Majesties, may I present Rufus Scrimgeour, the British Minister of Magic.”  Looking over at Rufus, Corelian added, “You refused to believe me, but perhaps you’ll believe His Majesty King Erevan Rivarendell of Atlantis and his wife Queen Calliara.”
"What do you mean until recently they were dead?"  Ollivander asked.  "That sounds as if you're trying to imply that they were dead, but aren't anymore, and I'm sorry, Albus, but I am a wandmaker.  As such, I'm very well versed in both wand lore and what they're capable of doing and restoring the dead to life as anything but an Inferius is not something a wand can do.  And Inferi don't need wands, so I know you didn't call me to sell wands to any."
Lucius glared at his son and yelled, "You're showing emotion again, you weak little bastard!  Crucio!"
Bill nodded and began to do his own warm-up exercises and Nick wasn’t sure if it was wishful thinking or what, but he could swear he’d caught his professor stealing occasional glances at him.  Encouraged by the chance that Bill was checking him out, Nick decided that he might as well make sure that Bill had a good show and started to do some exercises which really showed off his muscles and various curves.
Lucius had always thought that Draco was a pathetic little whelp.  He blamed Narcissa for coddling the boy too much.  However, Draco was also the only male heir to the Malfoy line, so as much as Lucius would have liked to disinherit Draco, he couldn’t, unless he provided a new heir.
"Now, many of you who were here last year, probably remember that a second teacher was brought in to teach Divination. That teacher, the centaur known as Firenze, is still on staff here at Hogwarts, but his talents will now be dedicated to teaching a new elective class for sixth and seventh year students: Archery. Now, in other staffing news, filling the position of Defense against the Dark Arts teacher this year is a person who has taught at Hogwarts for many years: formerly our Potions teacher, Professor Snape!"
"I'm not going to hurt the puppy, Draco," Lucius said.  "You're going to hurt the puppy.  Actually, you're going to kill it."
"Okay then," Ryan said as he walked over to the fireplace. "See ya later, Matt." Matt just nodded as Ryan took a handful of Floo powder from the vase on the mantle and then stepped into the fireplace. "Hogsmeade," Ryan said as he threw the powder down and soon disappeared in emerald green flames, shortly followed by a popping noise as Charles disapparated.
'Well, she has no need for it now,' Ryan thought a bit sadly as he wrapped the cloak around himself and walked over to the fireplace of his bedroom. Having lived in Cromwell Hall for ten years, Ryan knew all of its secrets, including the numerous hidden passageways. Reaching a hand under the mantle, Ryan triggered a small button which caused the wall to the left of the fireplace to swing open. Ducking into the hidden passage, Ryan made his way down the cramped space to where he knew the entrance to Matt's bedroom was.
When he did, Hermione set across from him, pulled out her wand and cast a silencing spell around the two of them so that no one who might come into the common room would be able to hear them talking.
“We’ve been friends since childhood,” Valen answered.  “He’s also my brother-in-law; my elder sister’s husband.”
“It was Weasley,” Harry said, knowing that Draco was probably referring to Ron and he just wanted to torture him for a few seconds.  He wasn’t lying after all, because he had lost his virginity to a Weasley, just not the Weasley that Draco was thinking of.
Matt looked at Oliver with a questioning look and Oliver just shrugged and said, “Well, there’s no harm in playing along with him.”
“It’s like history repeating itself,” Lily said as she kissed James on the cheek.  “Draco is the good student and prefect, while Aarik is the boy with glasses and untamable black hair who disregards the rules whenever possible.”
Everyone was looking around at the room and soon Kingsley Shacklebolt asked, “How do you keep all of the sea life out of here when all that water comes cascading in?”
“Hey, only Matt has permission to call me that,” Oliver said as the four of them left Matt and Oliver’s quarters and headed for the Ravenclaw hallway.
“Ron I haven’t decided what I’ll do with mine, but as for the other one, I’m going to stop at the hospital wing on my way to Herbology.”
“Yeah, that’s true, you do very well in my class,” Bill agreed as he returned the gesture. “What time is it?”
"Yes, he's my second cousin," Ryan said. "Just met him yesterday though, after my Uncle Charles brought him home, after what happened at his family's house."
Dumbledore smiled.  "As it does to us all, John," Dumbledore said and after a moment, added, "me much more so than you, of course," referring to the fact that he was almost thirty years older than Ollivander.
“Well, you’re partially right,” the secretary said.  “It really doesn’t matter if I believe you or not.  It does matter though that the Minister believes you.  If he doesn’t, you will be arrested and after the hearing, you could find yourself in Azkaban.”
Justin looked a bit like a deer caught in the headlights for a moment, but he quickly recovered enough to say, “Well, Susan, you know I’m gay.  What you didn’t know was that I’ve been dating Ryan for the last three weeks.”
“I’m just surprised is all,” Ryan said.  “It took you two over a month of running around the lake to finally admit that you liked each other.  I mean, I’ve known that Nick liked you since before school started.”
The next half an hour felt like an eternity, as they listened to the screams outside.  Finally, the screams stopped and Professor McGonagall walked into the Three Broomsticks.
“Hmm and I thought I knew all the ghosts in this castle,” Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye, obviously amused by what Alaric had said to Salazar.  “I don’t believe I’ve met this one though.”
"Severus, if it would make you feel better," Charles said, "you're welcome to stay here until school starts and then you can be with Draco. I'll even let you have access to my private potions lab, as long as you don't mind living with three Ravenclaws and a Gryffindor."
“Yes, that’s true,” Madame Pomfrey agreed.  “That doesn’t however explain why you are here, Mr. Potter.  I can’t imagine you coming to visit Mr. Malfoy, at least not of your own free will.”
“Yes, you’re right, Valen,” Bill said as he smiled at Harry and Hermione.  “Nice chatting with you two.”
“You like a Slytherin?” both Godric and Ginny asked in unison.  Godric’s tone of voice was more on the angry side though and Ginny’s was more on the confused side.
"What kind of special circumstances?"  Ollivander asked, as he arched an eyebrow, his curiosity obviously piqued.
Arriving on the seventh floor, Ron looked at the map to try to find Harry, hoping that he was not in Gryffindor Tower and thus perhaps wondering where his cloak and map where.  Finding Harry in the Headmaster’s office, Ron breathed a sigh of relief as he tapped the map with his wand and said, “Mischief managed,” before folding it back up and tucking it into his pocked.  He then removed the cloak and hid it under his robes as he made his way to Gryffindor Tower.
“Father, please, listen to reason,” Prince Erevan said.  “Corelian is family.  How can you treat him this way?”
“Well, it’s nice not to fear it,” Cedric said, “just so long as you don’t come to prefer it over life.  I admit, I did enjoy my time in Tartarus, but I definitely do not mind being alive again.  Anyway, Tartarus is split into two sections: The Charred Realms and The Palace of the Dead.  All souls judged as being good go to Tartarus, but which section of Tartarus they end up in all depends on how they lived their life while they were alive.  If they died with things left unfinished, they remain in the Charred Realms, which is not exactly a pleasant place to spend eternity.
"Thank you, Frances," Ryan said as he dried his eyes a second time while Frances turned and left the room. Taking a deep breath, Ryan stood and walked over to the bedroom fireplace. He grabbed a handful of Floo powder from the vase on the mantle, threw it into the fireplace and said, "Cromwell Hall, Yorkshire," as he stuck his head into the flames to inform his Uncle Charles of the bad news.
Again, Hermione’s hand went up almost immediately, but again Bill didn’t call on her. “Yes, Miss Davis?”
Ryan did as he was told and then quickly pulled out Draco's clothing list, "Oh before I forget. My cousin Draco Malfoy is staying with us now. He didn't feel up to coming with today, but here's his list. Said you had his measurements."
“Now, can anyone tell me what this potion is?” Bill asked as he motioned to a bloody looking red potion. “Yes, Mr. MacMillan?”
“Nicolas, if what you say is true, then that means we’re not only related to Salazar Slytherin, but that we’re also related to Voldemort.”
After a long silence, Draco and Aarik looked at each other for a moment and then at their respective parents before Aarik said, "I can only hope that my being with Draco is okay with you, mum and dad.  I've spent years now often questioning things I've done or how I feel about certain things, wondering if the two of you would approve or not.  Now that I actually have the chance to have your approval, I'm hoping that you'll approve of the person I've chosen to give my heart to, because if you don't, well, I'd rather not think about that."
Michael stared angrily at Adrian for a minute longer before he stalked off.  Damien scowled darkly and said, “Watch your back, Pucey.”
Harry closed his eyes and leaned his head against the trunk of the tree as he sighed and thought, ‘Maybe I’ll just skip the ball and save myself the humiliation.  I can’t dance and even if I could, I don’t have a date.’
“I don’t think he had a choice in the matter,” Matthew answered.  “I don’t know all of the details, but all I remember is a message arriving from Atlantis, ordering Corelian to return immediately and to leave Ryan in England.”
Asheera stepped forward and said, “We are about to witness a true miracle, my sisters; a testament to Persephone’s power and grace.  I pray that we all remember this day for the rest of our lives, as it is surely one of the most auspicious days that any of us shall ever see.  Praise be to the Goddess Persephone, our beloved maiden!”
Draco and Blaise nodded before they sat down on Adrian’s bed, as Adrian uncorked the Veritaserum and carefully put three drops of the potion into both Draco and Blaise’s mouths.  With Adrian standing in front of him, Pansy didn’t see the look that Draco gave Adrian, but Adrian caught it and understood the silent question that the younger boy was asking.
Nick was so engrossed in looking over the ingredients on the page that he didn’t notice Professor Snape coming over to stand behind him.  Looking down at the page, Severus asked, “What is this nonsense?”
Dobby then motioned that he wanted to speak to Harry privately, so Harry leaned down to hear him and Dobby said, “Though other elves won’t come.  Not with her here.”
“It’ll be a tight fit,” Corelian said, “but I think we can probably all get in it.”  He grinned at Matt and Oliver, and added, “I’m sure you two don’t mind being pressed up against one another.”
“Yes,” Zach said.  “Now, we just need to find you someone.  Just keep your thoughts away from one Thomas Byrne, he’s mine.”
Matthew and Oliver nodded, at which point, Corelian said, “I’ll do some research later and I’ll get my hands on the Cromwell and Wood family crests.  I’ll then send a work order to the top jeweler in Atlantis and he’ll get started on your jewelry so that it’s ready for December.  Did you two want the earrings or not?”
“What?”  Draco asked as he turned to look at Harry, fear clearly showing in his eyes.  Fear that he had just lost Harry as a friend.
"Thank you," Charles murmured as he motioned Ryan to step forward, "I'd like you to meet my nephew.  Ryan, this is Professor McGonagall, Transfiguration teacher, Head of Gryffindor House, and Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts.  Professor, this is my nephew, Ryan Cromwell."
Helga smiled at the boys and decided to give them a few minutes alone.  Just as she slipped out of her frame, the portrait of William Hufflepuff opened to admit another into the room.  Of course, William’s portrait never did get the chance to close, because as soon as Tom saw Zach in the arms of another person, tears came to his eyes, and he ran from the room.
Valen nodded and disappeared from the flames, but left the connection open so that Asheera could Floo directly to the hospital wing.
“I’m sorry,” Justin said as he moved in for a kiss, but Ryan just scrunched up his nose and moved away.
After listening to her arguments, Helga asked, “Am I correct in assuming that you’re a Muggle-born student, Hermione?”
“Well, you said you’re the last of the Delaneys,” Bill said. “That and you live with your grandmother, so I just assumed that your parents are dead.”
“Well, I’ve missed you, Ron,” Harry said.  “You’re my best friend and the distance between us has been really hard on me.”
“Unfortunately, yes,” Draco said.  “There’s an old law from about six hundred years ago that says if a pure-blood family is unable to find suitable pure-blooded wives for their children, that those children may marry each other in order to produce a legitimate heir to carry on the family name and bloodline.”
“Harry, I thought you said you followed the instructions in the book, but none of that is even mentioned in Advanced Potion-Making, so where did you get the idea to do it?”
After eating lunch, Harry slipped away from Ron and Hermione, which was really quite easy since they were to wrapped up in a lip lock to notice what was going on around them, and went back up to his dormitory. The room was, thankfully, empty, so he went over to his trunk and removed his cloak and the Marauder’s Map.
“Yes, well, what can I say?”  Rowena asked.  “Just because I’m an intellectual doesn’t mean that I am not a woman.  I still love to look my best and the presence of gray hair on my head was just not something I was ready to face at that point in time.”
“Good, Mr. Cromwell,” Professor Lasinius said.  “Now do you need a note to your next professor explaining you were late?”
“Pepper-Up Potion and Magic Restorative Draft,” Poppy said.  “Albus knew that Nikolas might be a bit drained after casting the charm tonight and wanted to be prepared.”
“This must be a mistake,” Hermione said as she read over the list of names a third time.  “It says that Tom Marvolo Riddle is only sixteen years old.  That’s impossible.”
Well, today is the first day of classes. Normally I probably wouldn’t even be awake right now and I would have woken up in a fashion similar to yesterday: with Hermione shaking me, trying to get me to wake up with just enough time to quickly eat breakfast before having to go to my first class.  Speaking of first classes, my first class this morning is double Potions; usually I would hate spending all morning in that class, but maybe with Bill teaching it won’t be so bad.
Justin smiled at the look on Ryan’s face and explained, “My housemates have all been extremely protective of me since I was petrified by a basilisk in second year.”
Once everyone had their wands out, Rowena continued her instructions, “Now, please stand in a circle and with your free hands I want you to hold the free hand of the person standing next to you.  Good, now, raise your wands above your heads and touch the tips of them together.”
Arriving in the hospital wing, Asheera rolled up her sleeves and strode forward, ready to help however she could.
A jet of red light shot forth from Charles' wand and hit Lucius, causing him to fall to the floor next to Narcissa's corpse, stunned.  Charles then knelt beside Draco "It's okay, Draco.  You're safe now."
Angelique remained quiet for a few minutes and then said, “You know, Nicolas, it’s a very good thing that we’re at Hogwarts now and have to abide by their rules, because even though you are legally an adult now, this kind of pairing would not be acceptable at Beauxbatons.  If Bill was teaching there and started dating you, he would have been fired immediately.”
“Can’t say the same for you,” Cedric said with a grin.  “You’re taller then I remember and I see you got out of that awkward stage.”
The young woman walked forward up to her master’s throne and prepared to bow. Before she could, however, he violently grabbed her right arm, ripped the sleeve of her robe off and jabbed his wand into the Dark Mark on her arm. With the Death Eaters not already present called, Voldemort flung the woman away from him and she screamed as she fell on top of Wormtail’s broken and extremely filthy body.
Matthew and Oliver turned to look at one another, the color draining from both of their faces, as they had obviously never even thought of such a scenario when discussing their plans for the future.  Finally, Matthew said, “You know, I never really thought of that.  I mean, the idea of the soul-bonding seems romantic and like the ultimate commitment, but when you put it that away, I can see why you say that it’s idiotic and selfish.”
“I don’t blame you, Severus,” Dumbledore said.  “I’ve come to think of death as being the next great adventure, but, if taking that adventure meant going to the Hells, well, I think I’d prefer never to take it.”
"Ah, Arthur, if only it was that simple," Dumbledore said with a sigh.  "No, young Tom here went down to the Chamber fully expecting to meet the basilisk.  Basilisks can live for a very long time, given an adequate food supply, however, locked away inside of the Chamber of Secrets, the food supply would have run out in the over a thousand years that passed between Salazar breeding the beast, sealing it in the Chamber and young Tom here opening it.  Salazar knew this and thus he called upon the powers of the Hells to help insure that the basilisk would survive."
Meanwhile in the staff wing, locked in a passionate kiss with their tongues dueling for supremacy, were Bill Weasley and Nicolas Delaney.  While it was true that they hadn’t been together very long, only about a week at that point, they weren’t wasting any time in getting to know one another.  The attraction between the two the first time they met in Diagon Alley had been instant.  They’d both spent the time between that meeting and their next dreaming about one another.
Wand held aloft, the person that the voice belonged to and cast a spell which caused a jet of sickly yellow light to hit Draco as he fell backwards to the ground, bleeding.  The assailant simply laughed before slipping away.
Pausing for a moment, Salazar then said, “Now, I’ve been observing in silence for awhile now, as I wanted to see for myself the full extent of the corruption of my name.  There is absolutely no truth to all of the bloody purity crap that you’re all so intent on believing.  Despite what the Sorting Hat may have led you to believe, I did not hate Muggle-borns or Half-bloods, and I must certainly never thought that only Purebloods were worthy of studying magic.  All of the ideals that Voldemort and his followers support are the creation of Godric Gryffindor!”
“Now, I must turn my attention to Earth and a way to stop that fool Voldemort,” Asmodeus said. “Of course, there’s no rush. He can’t succeed and thanks to the difference in the passage of time between Earth and the Hells, I have years to formulate my plan, while he tries to surpass my evilness. He still has a long way to go before surpassing even Avernus, let alone the seven levels between it and my beloved Nessus.”
Several gasps could be heard, before Molly Weasley asked the question that was surely on everyone's minds.  "But, Albus, you've always maintained that Tom Marvolo Riddle was You-Know-Who.  How can this boy who can't be a day over sixteen be him?"
Looking up towards the direction of the voice, Ryan noticed a young man who looked like he couldn’t possibly be more then nineteen wearing what looked like ninth century clothes in Rowena’s frame.
“Well, the Minister thinks Corelian is crazy to think that Atlantis still exists,” Matthew explained.  “I ran into Asheera on the way over here.  I don’t know if Ryan told you, but when Atlanteans get married, they can opt to wear a pair of earrings that grant them the ability to sense each other’s emotions and talk to one another telepathically.  Well, Corelian and Asheera have those earrings and she told me that Corelian has not only kidnapped the Minister and taken him to Atlantis, he’s also called the Circle to the palace and had them kidnap eight more people to help convince the populace of Britain that Atlantis really does still exist.”
“I’d have to agree,” Valen said.  “The books in Ravenclaw’s library aren’t readable yet, but, the Mass-Book Restoration charm was cast and I’m thinking they will be readable in early November.”
“I still don’t get it,” Ron said.  “What does Harry see in him?  Draco is an evil Slytherin bastard.  He is just like his father.  He does not care for anyone who is not a pureblood.  We have to get Harry away from that git before he can deliver him to You-Know-Who.”
“Please have your O.W.L results ready when I call your name,” McGonagall said, as she took out her wand, pointed it at the bulletin board, and waved it, causing five pieces of paper to appear on it. “Those are the sign-up sheets for the new extra-curricular activities, please sign up for those that you wish to take. I would suggest that everyone who qualifies takes Madame Pomfrey’s activity, as I’m sure it will be very useful in the year ahead.”
“Well, you heard Salazar,” Adrian said.  “Michael, Damien, Vincent, Gregory, you’re off the team.  I expect you to turn in your brooms and uniforms by the end of the day.”
As Draco approached, the figure held out its’ hand and Draco knew that Charon was silently asking for a fare to cross the river.  Reaching into his pocket, Draco took out the obolus that had been in the center of the peach where the pit usually was.  Dropping it into Charon’s hand, the ferryman nodded and waved Draco onto the boat.  Within minutes, the boat was crossing the river, and for the first time, Draco could see the imposing edifice of the palace in the distance.  When the boat docked on the opposite shore, Draco got out of the boat and followed the spirits of the dead up the steep hill to the palace.  As they approached, he could see two black hooded figures standing guard outside the palace's ornate double doors.
“SILENCE, YOU FOOL!!” Voldemort yelled. “All I asked was that you stay here with those other idiots and guard Tom Riddle. AND YOU HAVE FAILED ME!!”
“I’m only sorry that I couldn’t have done it sooner,” the King said.  “But, as you well know, I couldn’t help you until I had the power of the throne behind me.”
On Corelian’s hands, Matthew, Oliver, and Ryan could see a pair of fancy silver rings, engraved with what they assumed to be a family crest, although the crests on the two rings were different.  The crests were surrounded by a circle of alternating diamonds and rubies.
As Ryan, Nicolas, Kevin, and Hermione moved into their new seats, Bill moved back to the front of the room and placed his hand on the first workstation, across the aisle from Susan and Mandy, and said, “Daphne Greengrass and Ernie MacMillan.”
Before anyone could answer, Madam Hooch abruptly walked into the Great Hall and went to stand in front of the staff table.  Placing the tip of her wand against her throat, she addressed the students, “Attention, please.  The Gryffindor vs. Slytherin Quidditch match has been rescheduled.  It will be tonight at five o’clock.  We don’t usually have evening games or games during the week; however, for reasons of security, we are not following the normal game schedule this year.  None of the games will be played on the days that they have been in the past.  Nobody except me and the Headmaster will know in advance when the matches will be played, so Captains, I suggest you make sure that your teams are ready at a moment’s notice.”
“It’s okay, Draco,” Harry said, deciding that if Draco was going to use his first name, he might as well use his. “You have no way of knowing. At any rate, I do understand how you feel. Well, not entirely, since it was Voldemort that killed my mum, not my dad, but I still understand.”
“Yes, I know,” Justin said as he smiled at Ryan and wrapped an arm around his waist.  “I agree with you.  We’ve only been a couple for like three weeks.  We should get to know each other better before we go any further than snogging.”
“Hello Potter,” the newcomer to the Hospital Wing said as he pulled a chair over and sat down next to Harry.
“Oh, well, you make a very cute couple,” Susan said.  “I’m happy for you, but, Ryan, you should know that if you ever hurt Justin in any way, the other sixth-year Hufflepuffs and I will kill you.”
Hermione was watching Harry, but she was also keeping a close eye on Ron, watching for the tell-tale signs that he was about to lose his temper.  To Ron’s credit, he seemed to be taking very deep breaths and doing his best to stop himself from loosing his temper.
What Draco did not know, however, was that instead of doing his patrol, Ron had been shadowing him for the last hour, using Harry’s invisibility cloak and the Marauder’s Map to make sure he wasn’t caught.  Ron was simply biding his time for the right moment, before he cast the charm that would set his revenge against Malfoy in motion.
I also look forward to the other heirs being found because I think it will be quite interesting indeed, if what Rowena said proves to be the real reason behind the Gryffindor/Slytherin feud.  I can only imagine how everyone will react if it turns out that the Sorting Hat has been lying all these years and that Salazar Slytherin was not the evil person that it has made him out to be.  I for one though will be happy if it turns out to be true because a part of me has always been a little upset about being in a house founded by such an evil and prejudiced man.
“Professor Snape has finished my Remote Viewing Potion,” Salazar said, “and I watched him throughout the entire process.  He followed my instructions to the letter and I am confident that it has been brewed correctly.  Now, all that is left to do is add a drop of Professor Snape’s blood in order to get past Voldemort’s magic and for Nikolas to say the required incantation.”
Draco's knees gave way, and he collapsed to the ground in immense pain.  He tried for several minutes not to cry out, but as the pain coursing through his body continued to worsen, he just couldn't stand it anymore and began screaming in agony.  Lucius laughed as Draco screamed and writhed around on the floor.  Draco was screaming so loudly that Lucius didn't hear the sound of footsteps running up the stairs.  Narcissa Malfoy ran into the room and took in the sight before her with a horrified expression on her face.  Having come running the second she heard Draco cry out, she hadn't even grabbed her wand in her haste to come see what was wrong with her beloved son.  Despite that, she couldn't allow this to continue, and was thankful for the time she had spent learning how to perform some spells without a wand.  Striding forward, she pointed at Draco and said, "Finite Incantatem!"
“Now, Ryan, we’re not in class,” Oliver reminded. “You needn’t call me Professor. I’ll be your cousin-in-law in a few short months.”
Cackling, Voldemort raised one of his clawed hands, causing a column of red light to stream down from above him, followed shortly thereafter by several spirals of red and black magical energies. The assembled Death Eaters watched, curious and at the same time terrified, as one by one a stream of red light cascaded down over the heads of the nine Death Eaters, plus Wormtail, that stood before him. As soon as the red light touched them, they all began to scream in agony. Not only were they experiencing the pain of the Cruciatus Curse, multiplied by about ten times in its intensity, but their internal organs and flesh felt like they were being boiled in acid. Of course, that’s because they were and the other Death Eaters watched in abject terror as the flesh of the ten Death Eaters was covered in extremely painful-looking acid burns.
“No, nothing is wrong,” said Harry in an attempt to not set Hermione off on a rant about house-elves working like slaves.
“It is truly a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Ravenclaw,” Dumbledore said.  “I must admit that I was unaware that any portraits of the founders existed in this castle.”
As if he could read what was on his mind, Justin said, “No, Ryan, we just shared the bed last night.”
"Yes, it does," Charles answered, "but Headmaster Dumbledore owled me and asked me to bring you to his office today so that you can get sorted into a house. He figured you might feel a little out of place if you ended up being sorted with the first years at the arrival feast."
“I take it since she’s marrying this Phillipe Fortier,” Angelique said, “that you are not Fleur’s mate.”
"Now, those of you who attended last year may have heard rumors about a group called Dumbledore's Army," Dumbledore said as he gazed over in Harry's direction. "The group did indeed exist and its purpose was to give its members the chance to practice Defense against the Dark Arts, as the teacher filling the position last year did not, regrettably, include any practical instruction in her lessons. I have decided to allow the group to continue, however, I will personally be taking over as teacher for the group, which shall now be called Defense Arts. It will be an extra-curricular activity open to all fifth year and above students wishing extra Defense training in addition to what Professor Snape will be offering in his classes."
“Well, the reason is because I was reliving that night when I was one. I could see my mum standing in front of my crib, blocking Voldemort from getting a clear shot at me. She was pleading with him not to kill me and he told her to just move out of the way and he’d let her live. She obviously didn’t move, so Voldemort killed her. I’m sure you know the rest.”
"So, I take it you're here for your Hogwarts robes?" Malkin asked. "I'm assuming the standard robe with the Hogwarts seal, instead of a house seal?"
“To the best of my knowledge, yes, she did,” Dumbledore confirmed.  “I can fire-call Madame Maxime to confirm, but first, what was the clue you found for the Hufflepuff heir?”
“I’ll admit we haven’t been in the past,” Draco drawled.  “However, I think that’s been changing.  In case you haven’t noticed, my insults don’t really have the same bite as they used to.”
Blaise, Draco, and Pansy followed Adrian into his private room, at which point he locked the door and cast a silencing charm so that nobody outside would hear the conversation.
The gathered professors watched silently as the ominous black coach went into a sharp turn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest as it continued its descent.  The coach’s wheels soon touched down on the driveway about a hundred meters outside the gates of Hogwarts.  The professors watched as the coach sped towards the gates, traveling so fast that the snow on the ground was actually melting from the friction of the speeding coach.  The main gates, which had closed and locked after the last of the school carriages had passed through them, burst open as the coach neared.  The speeding coach soon began to slow, as it neared the castle, before coming to a stop in front of the main entrance.
“Yes, indeed, Rufus,” Dumbledore said.  “I’ve talked at length with Rowena, Helga, Salazar, and Godric.  I’ve also had conversations with Rowena’s husband, Brendan, who was the reason she added the clause about student and professor relationships, with the blessings of the other three founders, I might add.”
“It’s Veritaserum, sir,” Stephen said, “a colorless and odorless potion which forces the drinker to tell the truth.”
Moments later, the fireplace in Dumbledore’s office whooshed into life and Adrian’s head appeared in the flames.
Voldemort laughed cruelly and said, “I should have done this sooner.  Watching you suffer is so entertaining!”
Amos and Hannah immediately loosened their grip, as obviously neither one of them relished the thought of asphyxiating their recently returned from the dead son and having to bury him all over again.
Very few people in the Slytherin dungeons would be okay with the idea of a pureblood and a half-blood getting together, because the pureblood ideology is very strong in Slytherin house.  I can’t help but wonder though if such ideology actually existed before Godric Gryffindor amended the Sorting Hat’s memories to malign Salazar Slytherin’s name.  Rowena and Helga both insist that there is no difference between purebloods, half-bloods, and muggle-borns, that each of them has the same magical ability as the others.  If that was common knowledge, then I fail to see where the pureblood ideology of the others being inferior came from.  I can only imagine how everyone on the Dark Lord’s side would react if they knew that they were actually clinging to an ideology created by Godric Gryffindor, rather than Salazar Slytherin.
“No, Ryan, I don’t.  I realized awhile ago that it wasn’t Granger’s fault.  The only person I should really blame is my warped jackass of a sire.”
“Sorry, I’ve never introduced myself, Headmaster,” Alaric said, “but I’ve become a rather solitary being in the last thousand or so years.  The majority of the other ghosts don’t even know I’m here.  I’m Alaric Sebastian Bryant Slytherin-Gryffindor, Godric and Salazar’s first-born and only child.”
“Of course, Harry. Now, as you said, you should get going before you’re missed. I have to go to the library to check on something anyway, so you can sneak out ahead of me.”
“You mean Playwitch magazine?”  Blaise asked, as Harry nodded.  “How could Weasley have a layout in Playwitch?  He’s not even old enough to get a subscription let alone pose for it.”
“Demeter suggested that since they were voting on Persephone’s proposal, it would be unfair to allow her a vote, and instead suggested allowing Amphitrite to cast the deciding vote.  Zeus agreed and sent Hermes to collect Amphitrite.  After hearing both sides of the proposal, without being told who had voted how, Amphitrite was asked for her vote and she voted in favor of it.”
In Molly and Arthur's minds, while they had both been deeply hurt by Percy's words and actions, he was still their son and they loved him no matter what. So when he apologized and asked for their forgiveness, they gave it freely. Charlie had also forgiven him rather quickly, as the two of them were the second and third eldest, and despite some personality differences and other clashes over the years, they were still pretty close growing up. It took Fred and George a bit longer to forgive him, and Percy had been on the receiving end of more then a few humiliating practical jokes, although he didn't complain because he knew he deserved that and more for the way he'd acted.
“So, we’ll soon see Tom Riddle in his prison,” Harry said, as Nikolas and Professor Snape set everything up according to Salazar’s instructions.
Draco sighed, before drawling, “Yes, Potter, let me to say this slowly enough so that even you will understand.  My sire felt it was necessary to punish me whenever I did something he didn’t approve of.  The morning my mother died he was punishing me for something that really wasn’t even my fault.”
“Because I’ve been avoiding telling them,” Bill answered, “until after Fleur Delacour and Phillipe Fortier’s marriage.”
Nick stopped attacking the nape of Bill’s neck and moved upward a bit, careful not to break the contact of their midsections.  Nick slowly undid the first several buttons of Bill’s robe and the shirt beneath it, as he smiled down at the redhead.  His first glimpse of the rippled muscles of Bill’s chest only served to reaffirm Nick’s already passionate attraction to the older man.  Nick leaned down and began to kiss and lick each muscle as Bill moaned.
“I am glad to hear it, Anarra,” Asheera said.  “Please stand and allow me to introduce you to Draco Lucien Malfoy.  I’ve judged him to be the pure-hearted person worthy of using the fruit of the Tree of Life.”
“Vernon and Petunia?”  James asked.  “Why did Vernon and Petunia raise you?  Sirius is your godfather.”
“Minister, I’ve taken all I’m going to take of your mouth,” King Erevan said as he waved his hand in front of Scrimgeour’s mouth and muttered an incantation under his breath.
“No, Asheera was with him,” Alaric answered.  “So, wherever Draco is, I’m sure he’s safe.  Asheera is a very powerful witch and I’m sure she wouldn’t let Draco be harmed in anyway.”
"Well, Molly, with Draco living with Charles, it's possible that we'll begin to see a new Draco Malfoy. It's also very likely that Voldemort has just lost a potential follower. One less Death Eater to worry about is always a good thing in my opinion."
“No, Ryan, you won’t be,” Corelian answered.  “The Laitannen family’s appointment to the Cosmos sphere ends in 2001.  So even if I were to die before then, you can’t be Master of the Cosmos sphere because while you are my eldest and only child, you’re too young.  You would have to reach your 120th year before you could ever become a member of the Circle.”
“Tracey Davis and Daphne Greengrass are nice,” answered Nick.  “I’ve gotten to know them pretty well and they don’t intend to become Death Eaters.  Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode are a totally different story though as they both are very vocal in their support of You-Know-Who.”
The guard nodded to Valshar and again hurried out of the throne room.  He returned a moment later and Valshar said, "The Dullahan will drive the coach back to the Land of the Living, simply tell him where you wish to go.  I ask that you not discuss what has just happened until you are safely home.  As for you, mortal, until we meet again then; I assure you, we will meet again."
“Well, Ryan, it’s rather unbelievable,” answered Bill.  “Everyone in the school knows what the Sorting Hat said about each founder having an heir, but one just doesn’t really expect them to be someone they know.”
“Well, what can I say?” Draco asked as he placed his arms on his bent knees and rested his chin on them. “Seeing my mother die has had quite an effect on me.”
“You’ve caught me, Justin,” Corelian said with a grin.  “The truth of the matter is that Valen, Asheera, and I do know the identities of all four of the heirs.”
“Not necessarily, Ryan.  True, there have been heirs in the school since 1750, but if they didn’t know to look for such a room, it’s entirely possible that they would never have found them.  Tom Riddle did find Slytherin’s Chamber of Secrets, but from what I’ve been reading, that’s been mentioned a lot throughout Hogwarts history.  The only record I’ve found of these Founders’ Suites is this note from Headmistress Derwent.”
“I’m afraid not, Draco,” Asheera said.  “You see this tree produces only one peach every 1,000 years and it only remains fresh for twenty-four hours.  If it remains uneaten, it will shrivel and rot, meaning that you’d have to wait until the year 2996 to get another chance.  You will already be among the dead souls in Tartarus long before then.  And before you ask, it is not possible to use a Time Turner to go to 2996 and get the peach as Persephone’s magic prevents such foolery.”
“Yeah, we should,” answered Matthew.  “I’m not sure where he might be though right now.  What with all the Death Eater attacks recently, I imagine he hasn’t been spending very much time at the house.
“Yes, Belial,” Asmodeus confirmed. “191 years to be exact. Well, at least by the calendar of the Hells. I believe in Earth years it translates to a little over 50, but nonetheless, that is far too long of a period for you or your agents to not have noticed that he was missing.”
“I’m sure that Mr. Ollivander will be pleased to sell you all new wands,” Dumbledore said.  “I imagine you’ll need a new one as well, Mrs. Malfoy?”
“Well, it seems that Nick did some research and it turns out I’m like the twentieth great-grandnephew of its leader, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore. So, he’s hoping that I might have some influence with him, since I’m the last of the Delaney wizarding line.”
Draco was in awe by his surroundings.  When Asheera told him that she would show him the allegedly wondrous gift she thought Aarik would love, he never expected that a trip to Atlantis was necessary.  However, that is exactly where Draco now was.  He was sitting across from Asheera in a carriage pulled by two white horses, traveling down a road paved in limestone, which was lined by white marble planter boxes filled with colorful, fragrant flowers.  The buildings on either side of the street were all constructed of various shades of marble and granite.
Charles was wearing a deep blue cloak with black trim, so the fact that he was carrying Ryan's cloak wasn't immediately visible as it was hidden in the folds of his own cloak. Charles handed Ryan his cloak with a smile and said, "We're traveling to Hogwarts today, Ryan."
“I still get chills down my spine hearing Nick talk like that,” Bill said after a few moments of silence.  “It’s just something that will take some time to get used to I guess.”
One of Colin’s friends, fellow fifth-year Andrew Kirke, decided to help Colin and pulled out his wand.  Harry noticed and said, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” but Andrew didn’t listen and said, “Finite Incantatem!”
“What? He was just captured!” Harry said as he took the proffered copy of the Prophet from Hermione and read the article.
“Pansy, since you don’t believe that Draco is telling you the truth about being gay and you don’t believe that Blaise is telling the truth when he says that he did not force himself on Draco, perhaps you would believe it if I question them with Veritaserum?”
“Nick, Harry just spoke to you in Parseltongue,” Ryan said.  “If you could understand it, then that means you must be Slytherin’s heir, because only Slytherin’s male heirs can speak Parseltongue.”
“Master Draco liked many of foods house-elves at Manor made,” Dobby said.  “Always liked honey ham with baked pineapple and cherries.  Was served with mashed potatoes and vegetables.  Master Lucius frowned on it, but Master Draco liked potatoes with cheddar and bacon pieces in them.”
“That’s the strange part,” Ryan answered, “because I could have sworn the last time I saw it was two nights ago when I locked it in my trunk.”
“Rowena taught some of us how to simultaneous cast spells,” Justin said.  “Wouldn’t it lessen the strain if multiple wizards and witches, for example all of the professors, worked together to cast the spells?”
Looking at the Map, Harry soon found what he was looking for: Bill was in his quarters in the staff wing, alone.
“Correct, Mr. Malfoy,” Dumbledore said with a smile and nod.  “Five points to Slytherin.  Now, as you are all students, I will not be teaching the variant of the charm that draws power from your cores, as I believe that would be far too dangerous for wizards and witches of your skill level.  Now, the incantation for the Time Suspension charm is really rather simple and it is similar to the Time of Day charm.  The incantation is Tempus Subsisto.”
“I think it would be way too much of a coincidence for there to be that many similar names, but there might be a way to figure out for sure, if you are or not,” Hermione said as she walked over to the neighboring table, picked up a large book, and brought it over to Ryan.
“Surely you haven’t been totally alone?  I mean, you’re a portrait, can’t you visit other portraits?”
“I don’t know why, since you never show me the proper respect,” Voldemort hissed, “but I’m going to be nice and let you sit down this time.”
“It’s still standing,” Brendan said.  “It hasn’t been lived in on a regular basis though since 1623 when our eleventh-great-grandson, Kayne Ravenclaw, died.  He was Fiona’s older brother, but they never got along with each other and when Fiona married Edmund Cromnvell she moved to his estate and she never came back.”
“Oh that leads to my pride and joy,” Helga answered, “my private greenhouse.  It’s a highly magical room, similar to Rowena’s library, only it deals with plants instead of books.”
If it wasn’t for the twinkling in Dumbledore’s eyes and the smile on his face as he said it, some of the students might have actually been scared, but they knew that he was only saying it because it was Halloween.
Adrian ran each person who came to tryout through their paces, trying to determine the full extent of each person’s skills and to determine who he thought would make the best addition to the team.  Past captains of the team had always seemed to care more about the size of the players, rather then their skill, but Adrian firmly believed that skill was more important than size.
“Salazar with all due respect,” Snape said, “I am the Head of Slytherin House, so will you please leave decisions effecting it up to me?”
Through the glass walls and floor of the lift, abundant sea life could be seen swimming through the waters, but perhaps, most breathtaking of all was the view of Atlantis itself.  Spread out on the ocean floor, going on for miles in every direction, a vast city could be seen, housed safely in what looked like large glass domes.  Upon closer inspection, however, one could see that they were not glass domes but a shimmering field of energy.
Neville walked away from McGonagall with his new schedule in hand and added his names to the Defense Arts, Art, and Unarmed Self-Defense activities. Harry couldn’t help but notice the happy look on Neville’s face, which he surmised was due to a combination of McGonagall’s compliment and the knowledge that he had done better at something then his grandmother.
“I’m not disputing that,” Corelian said.  “Atlantis did, indeed, sink.  However, that was not by accident, it was by design.  My ancestors had a huge continent populated entirely by magical creatures and people to hide from Muggle view.  Sinking the kingdom beneath the waves was their answer to the problem.”
Mr. Cromwell says that he's had very little contact with his Malfoy relatives over the years and this was in fact the first time since their graduation from Hogwarts that he had talked with Lucius Malfoy. He says that there has always been a rift between the two branches of the family, ever since Lucinda Malfoy married his father, the late William Cromwell, a union which the Malfoy family did not approve of.
Ginny didn’t understand why Harry would want Godric to know it, but said, “Narcissa’s aunt and uncle were Walburga Black and Orion Black, parents of Sirius, who was Harry’s godfather, and Regulus Black.”
Taking the wand gently in his hand, Cedric's whole body lit up with a blinding aura for a second, causing everyone, Cedric included, to shield their eyes.  Once the aura had faded, Cedric gave the wand a quick wave and gasped as half a dozen bouquets of yellow roses shot out of the tip of the wand and fell to the floor.
Turning to the appropriate page, Ryan skimmed down the list of blue names and then said, “No, my name isn’t visible yet.  After my grandfather’s name it gets very hard to read anything else.  I can just barely make out my uncle’s name and my mother’s name.”
‘What is this Tree of Life, though?’  Draco thought.  ‘Why is it so special?  Asheera said she thought I could use it.  Does that mean that this fruit is the allegedly wondrous gift that Aarik will love?’
“We have to get that poor boy out of there,” Poppy said.  “Nobody should have to endure such a hellish existence.”
“Might as well,” answered Harry.  “I know that Rowena and Helga are anxious to have it out with him for maligning Slytherin’s name.”
“Thank you, Your Majesty,” his Supreme Lordship said, as he again bowed to his King, before leaving the throne room to go and inform his wife that they should begin packing for their journey to Hogwarts.
The two young men continued to kiss as they danced around the room, wrapped tightly in each other’s arms.  So engrossed in their kiss, they weren’t paying attention to where they were going and Bill soon felt himself falling down onto his bed, pulling Nick down on top of him.  Their passionate kiss never broke though as Nick decided to be bold and take advantage of the fact that Bill was now underneath him.  As Nick deepened the kiss, shoving his tongue as far down Bill’s mouth as it would go, he began to grind his hips against the older man.
“Yes, Anarra, he is indeed human,” confirmed Asheera.  “That does not change the fact, however, that I think him to be pure enough of heart to deserve the rare boon of using the Tree of Life’s fruit.  Draco and his boyfriend, Aarik, are both good friends of my step-son, Kyrian.  I expect that at some point, Kyrian will decide to sponsor Draco and Aarik in taking the Atlantean marriage vows.  Not that it really matters, as the ancient scrolls make no mention of our beloved goddess saying that only Atlanteans could use the fruit that she so lovingly cultivated.”
"I just said that maybe it was for the best," Goyle said. "Lucius told me that Narcissa was always undermining his attempts to get Draco to follow you, so maybe now that she's dead..."
Later that day, after classes were over for the day, Harry, Hermione, Ryan, and Nick carefully made their way to Dumbledore’s office.  Harry and Hermione were under Harry’s cloak and Nick and Ryan were under Ryan’s cloak.  Keeping a watchful eye on the Marauder’s Map, Harry knew that Ryan and Nick were right behind them.  There was also no sign of any professors, Mr. Filch, or Mrs. Norris and Professor Dumbledore was alone in his office.
Harry tried ‘Lemon Drops’, ‘Sherbet Lemon’, ‘Skittles’, and ‘Peanut Brittle’ without any success.  Hermione tried ‘Sweet Tarts’, ‘Nerds’, and ‘Kit Kat’ without any luck.  Harry and Hermione were beginning to get a bit frustrated to be honest, when finally the gargoyle jumped aside when Harry said ‘M&Ms’.
“You wouldn’t know most of them, Ryan,” Corelian answered, “despite the fact that you are related either by blood or marriage to all of them.  The nine Lords and Ladies of the Circle are currently all members of two of the oldest and most prominent Atlantean houses, the Laitannen and Lasinius families, in addition, of course, to Atlantis’ royal family, the Rivendells.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed.  “Professor Snape is brewing a potion right now concocted from one of Slytherin’s own recipes.  Slytherin says that it will allow us to see Tom in his prison so as to assess the danger level of a rescue mission.”
“I think I can overlook it,” Bill said with a grin, “but only because you’re so damn cute. Just don’t expect any special treatment in class.”
“Oh males definitely,” Valen answered.  “No offense meant to present company,” Valen smiled at Hermione, “but the female physique has never done anything for me.”
“So why wasn’t my own blood used?”  Ryan asked.  “Is it because I’m half-human?  Is my blood weaker then that of a pureblooded Atlantean?”
Nick nodded and after gathering quill, ink, and parchment, he sat down and began to copy the spell out of Salazar’s book.
“The center crest is the official seal of the Kingdom of Atlantis,” Corelian explained.  “It’s engraved on the bracelet as a way of signifying that the two households have officially been joined together according to the laws and customs of Atlantis.  Now, in addition to the spells cast to prevent the jewelry from coming off, each piece has an additional spell that provides the couple with certain benefits.”
"They won't have to come anywhere near the house," Harry said. "You'll notice that it mentions a portkey at the bottom of the letter."
“Hmm, how about if I win, you give me your invisibility cloak and if you win, I’ll get you Puddlemere season tickets.”
"Emotions are a sign of weakness, and Malfoy men must never be weak," Draco recited after a moment of thought.
“The core and time in use are unknown,” the security wizard said.  “I’m sorry, sir, but I will have to confiscate this.  We can’t have unknown wands roaming about the Ministry and I shall have to order your arrest.”
"Well, I'll see you later, grandmother," Nicolas said. "I suppose we should be getting to the carriages and up to the school."
Ryan watched the young man getting dressed for a few moments, thoroughly enjoying the sight before his eyes. Ryan couldn't help but think that while he was unaware of the fact that his cousin liked guys, he certainly did have good taste. And that's when it happened. Something which Ryan wished hadn't and he tried to stop it, but failed. Ryan sneezed.
Ryan and Justin happily danced in each other’s arms for several dances, before they snuck off for a little private time.  As many other students had noticed, the French doors on one side of the room lead to a terrace, which everybody was sure they’d never seen at Hogwarts before.  The terrace was very romantic though, with numerous places for couples to sit down and have some private time away from the crowd in the Hall.
“Watch your tongue, Severus!”  Asheera said in a stern voice that nobody in the room had ever heard her use before.  “I am almost eight times your age and I will not be spoken to in such a manner!  Despite what you may think, I am no fool.  I know you are mad that I allowed Draco to risk his life, but I don’t think that’s the sole root of your anger, and we both know it.  You may not want to admit it, but you’re just angry because James Potter is among the living again.  It means you are indebted to him, again, because as you well know, there’s a life debt between you and I’m sure you must know that while you have helped James’ son survive in the past, that doesn’t cancel or satisfy your life debt.”
After several moments of silence, Asmodeus said, “I’m sure you both know why I’ve brought you before me? Voldemort, lesser devil or not, was a denizen of the realm that you rule by my decree. You failed to prevent him from journeying to Earth and you failed to tell me that he had done so. He obviously used some very powerful disguising magic to hide the fact that he had left the Hells from me for as long as he has.”
“That’s horrible,” Ginny said.  “Well, not necessarily staying sixteen, but being held prisoner for over a century is horrible.”
Draco cocked his head and looked at Harry for a moment before he said, “You know, that’s the second time you’ve called my ‘Draco’.”
Kevin blushed a bit at the mention of his boyfriend, Stephen Cornfoot, and said, “What makes you think that?”
"Well, Ryan," Charles said, "it all has to do with why Draco will be living here now. You see I've just come from Malfoy Manor, where I was witness to Draco's father, Lucius, using the Killing Curse on his mother, Narcissa, while Draco was curled up on the floor watching. Judging by his position, I'm guessing he was recovering from the effects of the Cruciatus Curse."
“You are right, of course, Albus,” Helga said.  “However, if the jailer has been giving the prisoner regular doses of a powerful magical restorative draft, it might be possible for the prisoner to survive indefinitely.”
"I'll take that as a yes," Draco said as he positioned himself and then pushed forward into the warm, tight confines of Blaise's ass.
“I should have my head examined for being so nice to you, boy,” Voldemort said as he used his wand to move one of the other chairs to a corner of the room and then transfigured it into a bed.  “Although, I suppose it can’t hurt to give you a few creature comforts.  It’s not like they’re going to help you at all.”
“If he did, he certainly never said anything,” Remus said.  “James wasn’t really the bragging type, but I’m sure that if he knew he was the heir of Godric Gryffindor, he would have at the very least told his friends about it.”
Harry, Ryan, and Nicolas nodded to the nurse, before they all went over to Draco’s bedside.  Harry and Nicolas sat on the neighboring bed and Ryan sat at the foot of Draco’s bed.
“So, is that the only difference in the jewelry?”  Matt asked.  “That you wear a ring on both hands, instead of a ring on only the left hand?”
"Slytherin, ma'am," Nicolas said as he stepped up onto a vacant stool. Madame Malkin just nodded and then waved her wand at Nicolas, as another tape measure appeared and began to take his measurements.
“Finnegan, Seamus,” McGonagall called, as Seamus walked over to McGonagall and Lavender added her name to the sheets for Defense Arts, Art, and Music. Seamus was soon scheduled for Charms, Defense against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Archery, and Fencing, before adding his name to the sign-up sheets for Defense Arts and Unarmed Self-Defense.
Another thing that couples usually do is tell their loved ones about their relationship. That is definitely not something that Bill and I have done because if Mrs. Weasley ever found out that I was having sex with Bill, she'd probably want to kill him for taking advantage of me or something. I may not be in love with him, but I really do like him as a friend and the last thing I want is to have someone else's death on my head.
“We’re not friends, though,” Blaise pointed out.  “Not that I’m saying, I’d be averse to the idea, but, I think this is probably the first conversation we’ve ever actually had.”
Snape looked like he was about to unleash a scathing comment on Asheera, but Draco held up a hand to his godfather and said, “Sev, chill.  What’s done is done and while I appreciate that you care so much, it’s my life and it was my decision to risk it.  It’s not as if Asheera sent me unprepared.  In case you hadn’t noticed my attire, these are Atlantean battle robes.  Nothing particularly special about them, but they cover a full suit of mythril plate armor.”
“Yes, Draco,” Ryan said, as he looked over at Harry.  “My grandmother Lucinda also dated your grandfather, Jonathan Potter, for awhile before they started dating their future spouses.”
Looking around the room, McGonagall said, “If you’re not a sixth-year, please leave. Seventh-years please stay in the tower, because I’ll be dealing with your schedules when I finish with the sixth-years.” All of the seventh-year students did as their Head of House instructed and headed up the stairs to their dormitories, while the students in other years grabbed their belongings, went over to the portrait and left.
“Salazar,” Nick hissed in Parseltongue to get his ancestor’s attention before switching to English and saying, “May I present Hogwarts’ Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Severus Snape.  He’s also the Head of Slytherin House.”
"Well, it's your own life to do with as you please," the guard said, as he opened the door to allow Draco to pass through.  "The Throne Room is straight ahead through the doors under the grand staircase."
"I can't imagine my family having a problem with that," Draco said. "I mean he was a Slytherin right? I would have thought they would have been pleased."
“A bit young to be teaching potions,” Slytherin said.  “I assume you haven’t been in the position long.”
“Well, I am used to Harry,” Aarik said after a moment of silence.  “However, I’m also honored to have been named after mum’s cousin,” Aarik smiled at Lily, who smiled back.  “I’ll have to think about which name I prefer.”
Turning to the sound of the voice, everyone saw the life-size portrait above the fireplace.  It depicted a tall and muscular man, dressed in brilliant red robes accented in gold.  Around the man’s waist was a black dragon hide belt, with a sheathed sword attached to it.
“Amortentia is the most powerful love potion in the world, which smells differently to everyone, depending on what attracts them most.”
“That would have come in handy during second year,” Justin said.  “I certainly would have had a lot less make up work to do if Professor Sprout could have grown the mandrakes for the Mandrake Restorative Draft in minutes, instead of months.”
“So, if you two are a part of this Circle,” Dumbledore said, “does your presence here leave Atlantis and the shield artifacts you mentioned undefended?”
“I don’t know about the other group, but the students in my group are with me in Madame Rosemerta’s office.  The professors are outside helping to defend the town.”
“Nobody ever really goes up there,” Zach answered.  He was already on his feet and halfway to the portrait hole when he looked over his shoulder and said, “Thanks, Aarik.”
“Oh, I forgot it wasn’t common knowledge yet,” Valen said in a sheepish voice.  “Yes, all four of the heirs are known to the Headmaster and a select group of students close to the heirs themselves.”
“Yeah, I know that now,” said Harry.  “I didn’t know that though until a few weeks ago.  Somehow, the subject of marriage and children never came up when Bill was helping me come to terms with being gay.  He never told me that the Wizarding World’s opinion on such things is different from that of the Muggle World’s.  I think he thought I was sickened at the thought of being gay because of one of my crushes.”
Rowena then explained the truth to Dumbledore and informed him of a spell which she thought would counteract the charms that Godric must have used to give the hat false memories and to block the real ones.  Pulling out his wand, Dumbledore tried the spell, and it indeed worked.
“I’m inclined to agree with Tracey and Daphne,” Millicent answered.  “You saw Draco and Blaise kiss in the common room, along with half of our house.  To be honest, that was enough proof for me that Draco was gay, but with the Virginitas charm and Veritaserum confirming it, I don’t see how there is any room for doubt about Draco’s gayness.”
The security wizard just sat there, silently, for a moment, before he said, “I’m only an underpaid security wizard.  This is over my head.  You’ll have to see the Minister of Magic; his office is on Level One.  I will send word that you’re coming.  I am required to keep your wand, however, pending the Minister’s word to the contrary.”
“If you must,” Snape said, as he stood and walked over.  Pulling out his wand, he placed it on his temple and a moment later, a long silvery strand fell into the awaiting Pensieve.  To be honest, Snape was glad to be rid of the memory, as it was truly, hands down, the single most terrifying memory he possessed.
“Well, that’s true,” agreed Aarik.  “So, I suppose that dating me, seeing as how I’m a half-blood, is against your family’s rules?”
“Indeed,” Dumbledore said, as he turned and looked up at Fawkes.  The phoenix looked Dumbledore in the eye for a moment, before he nodded his head and spread his wings, disappearing in a flash of flames, off to gather all of the members of the Order for an emergency meeting.
“That’s what Ryan thought too.  We finally agreed though that it’s possible that only an heir could find their ancestor’s quarters and that the heir would have to know the room existed before they could find them.  From what I saw, these rooms weren’t mentioned nearly as much as the Chamber of Secrets, so it’s entirely possible that Tom Riddle heard of the chamber, but never of Slytherin’s quarters, which is why he never found them.”
"Yes, I know about them," Ryan said as he stepped out of the fireplace. "I've known since yesterday."
Ginny was speechless as she followed Harry into the room.  Harry closed the door after her, then walked further into the room, and took a seat on the large red velvet armchair in front of the fireplace.
“Light will prevail,” Tom said.  “It may appear to disappear, but it can never be banished completely.”
“Valen told us that you found out about being Rowena’s heir,” Corelian said.  “So, tell me, have you figured out who the other heirs are yet?”
"Yes, I am.  It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor McGonagall.  Allow me to present my grandson, Nicolas Delaney."
Adrian motioned for the ten students under his care to follow him and they went over to talk to the distraught tavern keeper.  Adrian talked to her in hushed tones for a moment, before she nodded and led them behind the bar and through the door to her office.
“No,” Aarik said with no hesitation.  “Honestly, I don’t care how old you are.  I went fifteen years without you and I’ll be damned if I’m going to go another second without you just because you didn’t age while you were dead.”
“You belong here in Atlantis!”  King Tyriand exclaimed.  “You do not, however, belong in England with your bastard half-breed son.”
“Well, Hermione, I said I followed the instructions in the book.  I just didn’t say that they were Libatius Borage’s instructions.  The previous owner of the book seems to have taken issue with a lot of what he wrote and put their own suggestions in the margins.”
Well, someone is coming, so I should stop writing now. The last thing I want is for anyone to be reading all of my personal thoughts.
“No, that was the creation of Voldemort,” Harry answered.  “The real Tom Riddle has been a prisoner all these years.  He’s been frozen in time since the spring of 1943.”
Dumbledore was on his feet at once as all the lights went off and suddenly there was a loud bang as what looked like a bolt of lighting struck the floor, causing an inferno of green flames to burst forth from the Hogwarts coat of arms.  As the lights came back on, the flames disappeared.  Standing where the flames had been, a man and a woman, both wearing ocean blue robes and possessing an otherworldly appearance, were now visible.
When I saw Lucius kill my mother, I suddenly felt very, very alone, so having Charles, Matthew, Ryan, and Oliver around makes me feel a little better. Well, I suppose I should stop writing now and get some sleep. Charles brewed up a batch of Dreamless Sleep potion yesterday when he got home from work and gave me a few vials of it so that I can sleep without any nightmares. I begged him for a Memory Charm, but he refused, saying that a Memory Charm would only be hiding from the truth and that wouldn't be a good thing in the long run. I realize that he is right, but it's going to be very hard dealing with the memory of watching my mother's final moments. I don't think I'll ever be able to get that look on her face out of my mind.
"Yes," Ollivander remarked.  "I remember I had quite the trouble finding you a wand.  You must have tried out over a dozen that day.  I wasn't particularly pleased with the match myself, but your mother was sick of waiting.  Well, let's see if we can do better this time, shall we?"
“It isn’t, Angelique,” Bill said.  “I love your grandson and I honestly believe that he is the one that I want to spend the rest of my life with.”
“Who will I get in trouble with?”  Draco asked in response.  “I don’t care what Lucius thinks and even if I break the rules, he can’t really do anything to me.  Punishment for breaking the rules would be that I’d be disinherited, but unless Lucius provides a new male heir, he can’t disinherit me because once he’s gone, I’m the last of the Malfoy line.”
“I don’t mean to sound insensitive,” Harry said.  “But, Godric, Alaric died over a thousand years ago.  For that matter, so did you.”
"Oh I remember those fights," Matthew said as he thought back. "She was furious with you for weeks. Figured that after two years of education at Hogwarts I'd learned enough to control my powers and should then go and have a proper British education."
“I have some of both with me,” Severus said as he pulled back a flap in his robe to reveal a black dragonhide potion carrier attached to his belt.  “I always keep a supply of various potions with me in case I need them.”
Bill, Ryan, Nick, Zach, and Draco arrived at the Gryffindor table in time to hear Harry’s last statement and Ryan said, “You know, Harry, I’ve just had a thought.  A couple months ago, I was in my room in Ravenclaw Tower and I realized that a small book on invisibility charms that my grandmother gave me before she died had disappeared from my trunk.  The book had dozens of spells in it and some of them were powerful enough that they could very likely have hidden both a person and a camera flash.”
"I said, 'Who's there?'" the young man asked a second time as he grabbed his wand from the bedside table and held it up, ready to defend himself if necessary.
Raising his hands again and calling for silence, Dumbledore continued, "I know some of you may be confused or even angered by this information. I have however always believed that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and as your Headmaster I felt that it was time that this particular lie was brought to light. Now in terms of the founder’s heirs, I'm sure that many of you are going to be spending lots of time trying to figure that out and I fully expect that many of you are thinking about going to the library and checking out the genealogical texts which are housed there. I would warn you however not to waste your time, because I know for a fact that the texts stored in our library do not go back far enough to reveal who in this room may or may not be descended from Godric, Helga, Rowena, and Salazar.
After fifth year ended, Bill came over to the Dursleys' to check on Harry occasionally.  It was then that they started their relationship, if you can call it that.  Neither one of them thought of the other as anything more than a very good friend, even though their activities would lead some to think otherwise.
"No, Professor Dumbledore had us come to his office to be sorted," Ryan said. "Thought we'd feel too out of place among the first years. I'm in Ravenclaw."
“No, Bill, I don’t think so,” Ryan replied.  “She said that after all these years the only portraits in the castle who would even know she was around would be the portraits of the other founders.”
"Hmm, Mr. Delaney, where shall I put you?  You seem to possess many of the traits that all four houses value.  You are intelligent, which would suggest Ravenclaw.  You are also brave and loyal, which would suggest Gryffindor or Hufflepuff.  I also see a certain amount of cunning in your personality, which would suggest Slytherin.  Hmm, let's see here, you also appear to have quite a bit of ambition and that coupled with your cunning makes me think that you would do best in…  SLYTHERIN!"
“Now, let me first say that I expect each and every one of you to take this class very seriously and to not goof off.  While it is true that we will be using dulled swords for the moment which would have a hard time cutting parchment, let alone skin, I do want to impress upon you that this will be one of your more dangerous classes.  If I see any of you handling swords in an inappropriate way, I will not hesitate to take points, give detentions, or if necessary remove you from this class permanently.”
“Yeah, and let’s not forget Nick’s grandmother,” Draco said.  “She was adopted shortly after their mother died, while Tom was still an infant, so it’s very possible he doesn’t even know about her.  Imagine finding out you have a sister who is now old enough to be your grandmother and who may in turn be your professor, if Tom takes Care of Magical Creatures.”
“If I had to guess, I’d say somewhere in the area of 50 million galleons, and that’s just my personal vault.  That doesn’t include the four or five other Malfoy family vaults that only Lucius has access to.  I have no idea how much money might be in those vaults though because he’s probably been helping finance You-Know-Who, not to mention all the generous gifts to public officials.”
Taking a few minutes to make it seem like he had gone to use the restroom, Corelian returned to the dining room and sat back down.
I have some very interesting news that I thought you would like to know about. I recently overheard a conversation in the Hogwarts Bell Tower. Present for this conversation were Slytherin Thomas Byrne and Hufflepuffs Zacharias Smith and Cedric Diggory.
"Yeah, that's pretty much it," Nicolas said. "Oh well, it was kinda fun in a way having an extra year off before starting school, but I must admit that it was also kind of lonely because most of my friends were able to start on time."
“It could be Cedric Diggory,” Bill elaborated.  “He was a Hufflepuff, but he was killed near the end of the Tri-Wizard Tournament two years ago.”
“Now, some of you may be plotting to escape from my service or to somehow circumvent my goals, but both are futile. NONE SHALL OPPOSE ME! And those who do will be punished in such cruel and unspeakable ways that the weak, mortal mind simply cannot fathom them. And as for the nine of you--” Voldemort motioned towards the nine Death Eaters he’d tasked with guarding Tom during the Battle of Inverness, “--you will soon wish you had never been born. If you thought my use of the Cruciatus Curse was painful, you haven’t seen anything yet! Or should I say felt anything yet?”
With that, McGonagall turned and headed into the castle, with Charles, Professor Byrne, Nicolas, and Ryan following close behind.
I can't wait for Hogwarts to start. The couple of times that Dumbledore has been around he'd hinted that we should expect a few surprises this year. I just hope they're the good kind of surprises. Of course, going off to Hogwarts also means getting out of this dreadful old house and away from the shrieking of Mrs. Black, who we still haven't been able to silence. Her portrait is still stuck on the wall downstairs and, try as everyone might, we can't find the necessary charm to remove it. I guess they don't call it a permanent sticking charm for nothing.
Upon learning that little tidbit of information, Bill had spent several nights with thoughts of the young and handsome boy of his dreams keeping him from sleeping.  It soon got so bad that Bill had to brew up a double batch of Pepper-Up potion just so that he wouldn’t fall asleep while teaching.  Then Nick began to show up every morning and join him on his morning run around the lake.  At first, Bill wanted to be angry that he couldn’t seem to escape his gorgeous pupil, but Nick really was too good looking for him to stay mad at for long.
"Yes, Aunt Petunia?" Harry asked as he walked into the living room, having just finished his meager dinner.
“No, Angelique,” Bill said.  Calling this woman by her first name was not especially hard for Bill, as she was new to Hogwarts this year, but calling some of the other professors at Hogwarts such as McGonagall and Flitwick by their first names was still a bit hard for him.  However, as he was now on staff, they all insisted that he use their first names rather than calling them Professor.
“Yes, he snapped his wand and said it was time for his ruse to be revealed,” Snape said.  “Headmaster, everything Alaric said is true.  I saw it with my own eyes.  The wizard we’ve always known as Voldemort melting away only to be replaced by a real, live devil.”
“Same with Helga,” Zach said.  “She’s furious with Godric and I know that he’s supposed to be known for his bravery, but I’m not sure all the bravery in the world is going to help Godric when Rowena and Helga get to him.”
