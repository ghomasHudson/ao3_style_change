Draco's private healer had a cottage hospital on the south coast, near the cliffs. Harry thought he could hear the sea.
Ron glanced at him. "Malfoy's never going to let that happen. It's well important to them, innit? Babies and stuff. The Malfoy name."
And yet, they are very clearly the same person. The sleight of hand videos, the model shots, the bickering over socks vs. not socks with Harry Potts, the self-titled product lines. In this world where influencing careers exist and we can't stop them, all I can say is that Draco Malfoy is definitely one of the more interesting social media personalities out there.
"Not to actual Draco, though," Hermione said. "I don't care who you're in love with, but he actually might."
"John's fine," Draco said, and still didn't look up. "But he's your baby, you can call him what you want."
Draco had taken all of his things with him when he'd come away with Harry, every last scrap of his belongings, even his rolls of toilet paper and the chipped, old mug he had his tea in. But Harry had watched him wrap those two tiny little figurines in his socks, gentle and careful and protective of them. Then, when they'd unpacked at the new place, at the little house Harry had found for them so that Draco could recover and get well, and where the two of them could learn to manage their bond, Draco had cleaned the mantelpiece first, rubbing it down so that the dust and the dirt was gone. He'd put the little fox and the fawn there, pride of place.
"Is he getting worse?" Sheila asked, one Thursday when the cafe was quiet and Draco sat at the counter and smiled at the little girl colouring at one of the tables.
"A good mix," Harry said, and then he stumbled into Hermione's arms and buried his face in her shoulder. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped."
"I'm sorry," Draco said, but this time it wasn't directed at Harry, and Draco was crying. "I'm so sorry, Jonny, that I wasn't here."
Draco's skin was flushed. "I don't do this very often, all right? I don't spend that much time needing to know where we're at in the moon cycle."
I ask Malfoy, finally, if there's anything he'd change about himself. He stares into the middle distance for a while. His cigarette burns down. I realise I haven't seen him smoke any of the cigarettes he's been holding throughout our interview.
Ron brightens up. Draco looks into the middle distance, suitably moody, which means he's excited for a 99. Hermione rolls her eyes.
Draco had come from an appointment with his healer. He'd brought ravioli from an Italian restaurant just next to his healer's, apparently, and was watching as Harry heated up garlic bread in the oven. His cloak had got a little more material than it had before, draped a bit more carefully to cover up his bump, but once he'd hung that up in Harry's cloak cupboard, there wasn't much hiding his pregnancy.
"We just haven't done anything about it because, like, we're tired and we have to look after Jonny."
Draco was dying. Everybody knew it. Hermione brought Sheila and Tommy to see him every day. Draco's beloved animal figurines were laid out on the bedside table.
"Marvellous job of secret keeping, Potter," Draco said. "Did you invite Skeeter around for tea too, or is that next week?"
Draco looked at the mango. "What are you," he said, probably to Harry, but still staring at the mango. "Why are you."
"Great," Hermione said, and allowed him another helping of lasagne, which he ate even though it should have stuck in his throat. He hadn't seen Draco since that time he was in green silk pyjamas, and that had been over a month ago. "Might not have to buy you a shed for your birthday after all."
Harry, who was half way through warming up a Marks and Spencer ready meal because he'd had to do a last minute trip to Mothercare for more nappies for newborns because he was scared he didn't have enough and still didn't know where the fuck to buy baby stuff that wasn't fucking Muggle, looked relatively bewildered. The possibilities at this point were a little bit endless. "What have I done now?"
But Draco hadn't stopped shivering even after the kettle had boiled and Harry had made them both some hot chocolate. He was so pale, with dark shadows under his eyes and his cloak thrown on over his pyjamas.
"It's a boy," Draco said, after Harry answered the door to a relatively frenzied ring of the doorbell. "They told me it's a boy."
"You are both completely incapable of dealing with normal human emotion," Hermione told him fiercely, pacing up and down the garden with Jonny in her arms. He was all wrapped up in a little coat and a little hat and little mittens and a blanket. "You are a shipwreck of a human. The two of you are completely emotionally illiterate."
"You're such a pleb," Draco said, but he stood back and let Harry into his hallway. It was a neutral beige hallway, with laminate flooring and silver hooks on the wall for his coats and cloaks. If Harry had had to pick any place on earth for Draco to live, it wouldn't be here. He hadn't really noticed the decoration either of the other times he'd been here, but then he'd had other things to think about.
Draco also looked a little green, but Harry rather suspected that was an overall aesthetic choice rather than abject nausea, although under the circumstances it could very likely be both. "It was raining," he said. "And overcast. And I was very, very drunk."
"Well, that one's just going to go on and on, isn't it?" Harry said, taking another bite of his pasty. "Surely at some point it'll grow old."
They had forgotten for a while, until Jonny had reminded them that food had to come on a relatively strict and frequent timetable around here, face scrunched up and little tears suggesting that no one had ever actually fed him before in his life. Draco looked distressed, until Harry told him that he'd better get used to seeing this little palaver multiple times a day. Then Draco had held Jonny, looking vaguely terrified, whilst Harry had made him a bottle, and then Draco had fed him, holding his son in the curve of his elbow with his expression swapping regularly between joy and terror.
"Hermione says if you can put up with how crap I am on a day to day basis, I'm really quite worth knowing," Harry said. "I think she takes it as a personal affront every time I don't know something."
"You can tell how mad she is because of how much she's swearing," Ron said helpfully. "You can tell how furious I am, because I'm not."
Harry sat down and shifted so that Draco could see him, could meet their son, their little boy. Draco didn't reach for him once, and tried to hide his tears.
"One day, someone at the ministry is going to get a mobile phone," Hermione says, "and then you'll be grateful for all my undercover work on Tumblr. Honestly, I cannot believe that in my actual adult life I've had to create a whole second personality, and a Tumblr account, just so I can literally go around debunking all those people taking your videos apart and saying you're a magician. Last week I had someone send me three anonymous asks telling me they're going to have me banned from the Magic Circle. I'm not even
"He's through here, Mr Potter," the healer said, and Harry launched himself out of the chair and through the doorway into the room where Draco was.
Harry considered telling them that Draco wasn't going to be bringing the baby up, but it just didn't seem the right time. Draco had been inconsolable in his kitchen, sitting at the table and crying through half a packet of ginger biscuits and two cups of tea, and Harry hadn't known what the fuck to do except to keep boiling the kettle.
"So how are you two going to divvy up childcare?" Hermione asked, settling down into the armchair with a glass of rose. "Have you started talking about it?"
"That's my boy," Harry said softly, once Jonny was done with his bottle. He leaned down to kiss the top of Jonny's head before settling him against his chest to rub his back, holding him gently. "Aren't you a good boy? Such a good boy."
"No," Draco said. Harry was upending salad leaves into a bowl, and half-heartedly quartering tomatoes. Draco, because he was forever perturbed by Harry never dressing his salads, started rummaging in his cupboards for oil and mustard and balsamic vinegar.
"I'll do it," he said, Mothercare bag still in hand, when Draco answered the door. "I'll bring our baby up."
"Probably," Harry agreed. He had Jonny perched on his lap, the two of them sitting on the stairs, waiting for the doorbell to ring.
Draco reached out then, touching Harry's arm. "Don't come back," he said. "Don't bring him back. Please."
Draco didn't let go of him, not when the healer was examining him, or when they were putting up the screens, or casting the spells to minimise the pain.
Fuck, he was going to have to get a babysitter if he ever wanted to sleep with anyone ever, ever again, although given on the experience he'd had between the ages of 22 and 28, that would come to six nights and about eight hours of human contact, so maybe a babysitter wasn't entirely out of the question.
"I promise," Harry said, because Draco needed him to, and because Draco hadn't slept. He went to get Draco some pyjamas, and then came back into the bathroom to help him out of the bath and get dry. Then, for want of something better to do, he put Draco to bed in his bed, and stayed with him until he fell asleep.
The Draco Malfoy I've met today should be in direct contrast to the Malfoy in his videos, the one that hid behind the sofa when Harry Potts turned the Roomba on by remote whilst Malfoy was mid-greenery decoration, or the one that woke Harry Potts up in the middle of the night bellowing "What is that monstrous beeping?" and when a mostly-asleep Harry said,
In his defence, he really had been very, very drunk, it had been raining, and his schooldays had mostly been concerned with Voldemort and his followers trying to kill him whenever he turned a corner. He hadn't had much chance to consider how gay he was until everything had all calmed down, and by that point he'd been 22 and in general a bit bewildered by not being constantly at war or being shoved onto a podium somewhere. It wasn't entirely his fault that by that point he'd missed the leaflet filled with all the things he was supposed to know by then, like, apparently, not shagging on a full moon and being aware of the fucking moon cycle in the first place.
"I didn't—" Harry said. He let out a breath. He hadn't told them that Draco didn't want this baby, that he'd be bringing it up alone.
"I'm 28," Harry said, because he was, and because any change to the Hogwarts curriculum now was hardly going to impact his life in any helpful way.
Draco looked very alone, all of a sudden. "All right," he said, and Harry didn't know what to say to that, so he nodded, and left.
"That is not the point," Hermione says, a trifle sanctimoniously. "It would be nice to reblog all those She-Ra gifs without the added hassle of having to constantly put myself in the line of fire of your fucking fans."
"Yeah," Harry said. "Maybe because I'm more scared than I've ever been in my whole entire life that you'll walk away and I'll fuck this up. I always fuck it up. I don't know anything about people. Turns out I don't fucking know anything about anything, do I? Got you pregnant cos I didn't know shit."
The doorbell woke him up at half past three in the morning. Harry, exhausted and not entirely certain he'd heard it right, stumbled downstairs with his wand in one hand and wrapped in his blanket.
Jonny responded in the only way he knew how, which was to regurgitate milk down Harry's neck, because Harry hadn't remembered to put down a cloth.
"Put the boarding school stories down, Draco," Harry says. His exasperation is mostly faked. He's continually charmed by Draco. It's terrible. "Anyway, the light's shifting. If you want me to take any pictures it had better be soon."
"It's fine," Draco said shortly, and turned back around to go down into the kitchen. He sat at the table and waited for Harry to divide up their dinner.
"No worries. I'm prepared for a bit of backlash. I'll not appologize for standing by my, though I'm aware of the atrocities that came with. I didn't care because my job was never to steer my husband away from anything only support his choices. At first it want that horrid either. Lord Voldemort preached how he would return the wizarding world to the wizards and wanted to purify our race and traditions once again, but just like last time, things got out of hand. I was relieved when Voldemort vanished since my soon was born by then and I didn't want him to grow up as a killer as his father and i had become. Life went back to normal and i raised my child to be a proud traditional pureblood as expected, but then He came back and ruined everything. Now i don't care. I don't care if thefamily line dies and I don't care if is tainted and i don't care if i die trying, but by Merlin I will save my son." Narcissa, in a desperate moment of clarity, became far more outspoken than she had been since her school days.
"Looks like Harry wins this time but maybe not having this discussion on the stairs while you keep guests waiting would be preferable." Severous said interupting the silence from behind them.
There was something entirely off about him on the train. Even here in school, it was like he wasn't entirely present.
"Oi whats this then?" One Draco Malfoy, having been ignoring Rons idiocy, announced. In his hand was a glass orb.
"Yes, but that healing potion you just took was from Severus' private stores. He said no matter how good some of his newt students were, he would make sure you healed by his own hands as much as he is able. He gave me explicit instructions to go to him for any and all potions you would ever need while under my care." Poppy explained, having done her job and finished wrapping the new cloth around Harrys hand and then walking away.
"All the more reason to leave. If we are registered as mates, Dumbles will likely use the two of you against me to force my hand. We need out from his clutches, and I have nothing here for me anymore except the two of you anyway. For now I will remain neutral." Harry declared.
"Very well. Harry, to be sure, do you know how the wizengamot works? I'd like to be sure you understand before I cast your vote for you." Lucius asked.
"Either way, we should leave. Come along Harry, we have much to discuss and quite a bit of shopping to do tomorrow so you'll need your rest. Come along and you'll never have to see them again." The taller man in all black spoke to him. His deep voice was soothing as he spoke and Harry instantly felt safer than he ever had before.
"Glad to see you made it. I was beginning to worry." Draco said as soon as the door closed behind them.
"Your first year this corridor was off limits due to what the headmaster hid here. Normally though this is the family wing. It is used for visiting families from over seas or when members of the board visit the castle. Families like being able to visit for holidays or birthdays and have somewhere to spend the night before heading home the next day. As you can see, it's much cleaner now than it was back then." Lucius pointed out.
"Yes. It was Lilys idea. She figured if she died, I might be able to plead for your life as long as you had ties to the dark. So she made me your other godfather. So, even though I hated that you were nothing more than a puppet, I have always tried to protect you. I always will." Severus admitted. Harry smiled.
Harry marched nervously to the pitch. He felt only minimally better as Sev had reminded him how natural he was as a kid on the small practice brooms he and Draco had raced each other around on. Sev even told Harry how his birth father James had been an ace flyer in his Hogwarts days, despite Sev's dislike of Harrys biological father.
"Then I suppose I'll wait. No need to learn it early anyway. I almost never lose things anyway. Have a pleasant trip. And thank you again... Err..." Hermione stalled not haveing gotten their names.
"I am. Draco dear, behave yourself please, and don't worry about your father or his orders. Ill take care of everything." Narcissa spoke calmly, though her heart was racing.
Now up until this point, Harry had never seen her office. He never had a reason to. He knew it was very pink from the small glimpses he had seen while in class, but beyond that he hadn't wanted to know. This however, should be classified as assault. His eyes wanted to bleed from the sheer amount of bubblegum pink in this room. There were pink rugs on the dark hardwood floor, her desk had a pink table cloth on it with a white lace runner across it, the walls were pink and covered in fine china plates depicting different kittens, the ceiling wasn't even spared as pale pink crystal hung from it. She even had pink quills in the holder on her desk.
"So there was no plan. She just... In front of basically the entire school? Bloody hell, Dra, what are you going to do?" Pansy asked now legitimately concerned.
Short chapter I know. The next one will be more than story filler I promise. That said I have work tomorrow and it's 11pm. Sleep is definately needed.
Harry was feeling some kind of way. He hadn't decided if he was more angry, disappointed, or flabbergasted. Maybe he was feeling all three at once. He wasn't entirely sure, but the last two weeks since he had moved into Potter manor had him completely overwhelmed.
"Hmm difficult difficult. I can see it all. Its right here in your head, but where to put you... You are kind but too cunning for Hufflepuff. No. You are smart but dont have the penchant for rules like Ravenclaw. You are brave but too shy for Gryfindor. You are cunning but not enough for Slytherin. Youd be great there you know. Many great wizards have come from Slytherin. A few terrible, yes I see that concern, but great. There is evil and good in every house. Make no mistake there. Hmm. Better be...."
"Is that really all he owns? Half a bag of old clothes that dont fit? Im amazed you muggles survived this long if this is your idea of how to treat a small child. And speaking of small, he looks half starved. You two and that fat pig of a son are truely repulsive. Merlins beard you ought to be locked away for however long you have left." The blonde man said sneering with full force as he stared directly into Vernons eyes, like he was daring the man to deny it.
That said, maybe Lucius would be there. The man had garnered some kind of tentative friendship with the boy, so maybe he would have some idea about what to do about Harrys predicament.
Looking over it was clear Draco was having a similar issue but was hiding it much better than he was.
"Well met, Lord Potter. Lead the way." Lucius greeted back. Harry turned with Lucius following him, going down the entry hall that led into a large open parlor with the largest windows Harry had ever seen that looked out on the vast land the Manor sat on. The elves had outdone themselves cleaning up and fixing the gardens. Already the life was coming back to the grounds and Harry hoped to have flowering plants come back by next summer.
"Excellent. I didn't put up a privacy spell for nothing then. Now here's the plan..." Pansy went into infinite detail.
It was no secret that the Malfoy family to some degree had always supported Lord Voldemort, though no one spoke of it and it was never confirmed to what degree.
It had been a very long time since Lucious had gone a night without his wife beside him, though with Draco being their only child (Cissa not being able to have more) he didn't blame her. Dracos state didn't escape his notice any more than it likely escaped his wifes, and she was prone to making rash decisions if she though it would make him happier.
“...Elsewhere.” He kisses Baz’s cheek. “And she told me to give Baz a message. That she’d been murdered, and to seek revenge.”
As he swallowed that sentiment, the clock above Astoria’s fireplace chimed 10. Then, the Floo flared, and Narcissa stepped through with his son.
There’d been a time, just after the war, when it seemed all anyone ever did was talk about the Saviour. In fact, it appeared only the downfall of Draco’s family could steal the spotlight from Potter. Until the public breakup with Ginevra Weasley. Then, the months of embarrassing drunken antics that almost lost the Chosen One his crown. And now, almost nothing.
Harry nodded, like he understood perfectly. Scorpius flicked his gaze from Harry to Draco, trying to understand.
later. In the meantime, Boy Who Went to Therapy, tell me: why am I perfectly content being Granger-Weasley’s secretary, when I could theoretically run my own department?”
Draco cut him off. “Really, Potter. I rarely see the boy. Astoria has full custody. She’s Scorpius’s real parent.”
“Mike,” The man said, removing his hand from Harry to greet Draco. Draco took the hand, shaking with a rough squeeze.
But then his clock struck 6 and manners overtook procrastination. He stepped into the Floo, calling out Harry’s address.
Draco dropped his head to the table with another loud groan. Wrapping his arms around his head, he mumbled, “I just wanted to complain about the book.
This is what Harry wants. What Ginny wasn’t ready to give him. She’d wanted a career all her own. The chance to be her own person outside of Harry’s shadow. And who is he kidding? It’s a big goddamn shadow, whether he chooses to cast it or not.
Ron peered out the back door. “Looks like Molly’s already started feeding them. She never could resist a gaggle of hungry kids.”
“Well, I spent most of my teenage years trying not to die, so figuring out I liked boys as much as girls wasn’t high on the priority list,” Harry snapped, bringing his hands back to muss up his hair. With a sigh, he seemed to calm himself, his shoulders and tone relaxing. “Why? When did you figure yours out?”
Once they’d recovered from the gripping stomach punch of Apparition, Harry glanced around the alleyway Draco’d selected for arrival. “This is near Diagon, right? I thought this was a muggle place?” He asked as they walked down the street to their destination.
Harry smiled his (adorable) smile. “I doubt that’s true anymore, Draco. I expect you’ve changed quite a bit from the boy I once knew.”
Harry eased his body language some. “I get that.” He smiled wryly. “Probably wouldn’t be kosher to invite the war hero to the pity party.”
This was it. The moment Harry could choose to be brave again. He forced his arm to cross the distance between them, grasping Draco’s hand in his own. “You don’t have to be.”
“Do you want to go home, or would you like to stay and work?” Hermoine asked, once she’d released him from her embrace.
Raising one finger, Harry summoned the bartender. “Two bottles of the 1369 Goblin Vintage,” Harry instructed. “Send it up to the honeymoon suite.” Then, on second thought, “Discreetly, please.”
“Well,” She smiles, stopping back in front of a familiar door. Draco and Harry’s room, if I remember carefully. “I will let your new roommates provide input on what classes to take.” Clapping her hands in front of her, “All right. Lunch is served at noon in the Great Hall. In the interest of your safety, I will send an escort, and I ask that you only leave the room with a member of this dimension at your side. Mr Potter will be your best resource in recruiting volunteers.” Her lips purse a bit at this; the implication clear.
Hermione turned serious again. “But, really, Draco. Rethink your definition of failure. Sometimes, the only way to fail is to have never tried in the first place.”
“This is why you wanted Scorpius to stay with me,” Draco said, pressure in his chest building. He felt anger, grief… gratitude. “You wanted him to build a relationship with me before introducing him to your boyfriend.”
Feeling brazen, Draco scanned Potter from his feet to his head, letting his pleasure show on his face.
And Pansy had to pop the bubble. Because while Draco’s mind choked on Harry’s question, Pansy stalked over and plucked a hair from Potter’s head.
The man in question made a soft whimper that Draco refused to let tug at his heart strings. Refused!
Which was a good idea, Harry thought, so he repeated Malfoy’s words to secure the order. He’d hardly eaten that day. Too nervous. Harry suppressed another laugh at the irony of
Tilting his head to the side like he was trying to solve a particularly complex puzzle, Harry said, “You’re a weird one, Draco. But I think I like it.”
Harry waved him off. “No, Guillaume, please. No apologies. You’ve done nothing wrong. If I were offended by sarcastic barbs, I could hardly be friends with Draco here.”
They started their meal in a relatively drama-free environment. Harry did not bring up his sexuality. Draco did not bring the fact that learning about Harry’s sexuality had passed up his failure as a father and his hatred of books that sympathize with death eaters as the number one thing threatening to unravel his fragile mental state. Hermione and Ron did not bring up… whatever happily married couples with two adorable children think is the equivalent to announcing your sexuality to the entirety of wizarding Great Britain or the fact that you’re probably going to wank over your childhood nemesis in a few hours while your son who hates you sleeps next door.
Over lunch a few hours later, Draco spilled the beans about everything but his burgeoning friendship with Potter. Lavender was surprisingly supportive of his decision to explore advancing his career, despite her happiness at her current role.
Harry groaned. “I’m going to regret this question, but since it’s my hair, I feel I have the right to know.” He paused. “Who’s going to Polyjuice into me? Will it be you or Blaise?”
“I promised I wouldn’t.” Draco summons the bottle of Firewhiskey and pours his tumbler half full. After taking a deep swallow, “I’m trying, Potter. To keep the promises I make. To amend for my past. I thought you knew that.”
He turned into her kitchen, and stopped short of the sight of one Harry Potter having mimosas with his best friend. Wearing a second day outfit of his own. Sporting, Draco gulped, a rather prominent love bite he’d yet to heal.
“I know,” Draco breathed. “I used to visit here as a child. Does it still have that awful painting?”
Draco ignored the surge of pride he felt that Harry trusted him with these secrets. Instead, he sipped his wine. “So how
“Molly and Arthur are watching Rose and Scorpius, and it looks like Victoire’s joined them as well,” Hermione called from the kitchen, finishing the sort of post-work routine Draco imagined Hermione scheduled into her CL. Eventually, she joined Draco on the couch, two empty glasses in hand. “Ron will join us in a bit; he’s still at the shop with George.”
“You’re smiling,” Hermione interrupted Draco’s not-actually-flirting flirting. “You’re smiling, and you’re messaging. What’s going on? And don’t tell me it’s Lavender, because I know she’s out today.”
“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Hermione conceded. “All right, come to my office. Let’s have a chat.”
“Sorry, Draco.” Hermoine looked pained. “It was last minute, and I didn’t have time to ask. You don’t mind?”
Slightly tipsy, but mostly focused, the two men worked together to craft Draco-approved answers to Pansy-suggested questions (she’d sent them over to Draco shortly after setting up the press conference).
“I can see how that would help,” Draco said, thinking of the kind words Harry bestowed on him earlier. “Harry’s approval has a tendency to buoy one’s self-esteem a bit.”
Sighing, Draco decided to reconstitute himself and try again. “Sorry, Potter. But I’m having a bad day, and I wasn’t prepared to see you again.”
“Will you visit me soon, Grandmother?” Scorpius asked, his eyes wide and almost fearful. “Even if I’m at my mother’s?”
“Anyways,” I redirect, getting a bit self-conscious at the way everyone’s looking at me. “Then I lost my magic, and nothing would get rid of the wings. Nothing magickal, anyway.”
This is going to hurt to admit. I look at the roommate, the man with the scarred forehead, and feel a pang of sympathy. “Remember when I thought I hated you?” Wincing internally at my own lack of self-awareness, “I used to make that same face when you slicked your hair back.” My tail snakes over my leg and onto Baz’s.
“What?” Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “That I would have come out sooner if I’d understood what was at stake?”
Pansy nodded. “I think that’ll do it, if The Prophet gets an exclusive as well.” She shifted into work mode. “Ok, I’ll need the statement ASAP to kill the Hogsmeade story. We’ll need to schedule a press conference before I leave—Draco, I assume you’ll work with Potter on wardrobe?”
“Why, Potter,” Draco drawls, setting down his book. “I can’t believe I’m finally getting to benefit from your penchant for rule-breaking.”
She caught onto his hesitation at once. “Because why, Draco?” Her eyes narrowed, and Draco sighed. He did call her voice shrill; he could owe her this.
“Well,” Draco drawled, eyeing the way the foam highlighted the strong muscles of Harry’s forearms. “That would imply a desire to clean the dishes myself, which I clearly don’t have.” He looked over at Scorpius, whose eyes twinkled at the exchange, and Draco winked at his son.
Scorpius, on the other hand, looked between his Aunt Pansy and Harry Potter, torn with the decision.
Harry nodded. “I owe her a life debt, so she’s very important to me.” He caught her gaze again. “Even if I don’t get to see her very often.”
This affront to his fashion shouldn’t be the straw that breaks him, but he looked down at his sad, mismatched loafers, and he felt tears well up in his eyes.
Draco’s body went cold. He placed the book back down on the coffee table, downed the rest of his firewhiskey, and went to bed.
The ‘or something else’ lingered in the air, but Draco dismissed it. “Scorpius, would you want to—” But Scorpius is already halfway to the monkey bars.
“Oh dear, my transfiguration skills have gotten a little rusty since my Hogwarts days. I don’t think I can,” Draco drawled.
Mother smoothed down Scorpius’s hair, and picked a few small twigs off his sweater. “I should be leaving, darlings. Give you some more quality time together.”
were to blame for the confession. Which it probably was. Despite his lack of lunch, Draco still hadn’t ruled out Veritaserum.
This isn't as polished as I'd like, but I realized I hadn't posted in a week so thought something was better than nothing. Hope you enjoy! And yeah... I DID google translate "hair color" to Latin for a spell. I'm not ashamed! :)
“I am,” He blushed, taking a sip of his wine. “It’s so weird, I never saw myself here, but I can’t picture myself anywhere different.”
“Is that all? Bisexual? Really, I’d been hoping for something a bit juicer,” Draco lied. “Pony play or something. Secret furries with the dragon-taming Weasley. Maybe Rose and Hugo are actually your kids. Anything but being unable to line up your sexual preferences perfectly against society’s ruler.” Really, Potter being bisexual was the juiciest gossip Draco had ever heard, and he had known Hermione was pregnant with Hugo before she did. Of course, Draco’s interest in the gossip had more to do with a few Hogwarts-era dreams and fantasies of his, but that fact would stay shuttered in Draco’s brain forever, thank you very much.
Simon elbows Baz. “There’s a similarity. Do they also like melted chocolate bars disguised as lattes?”
Shrugging, “What can I say? I like a passionate man.” Pulling Draco back into his arms once again, “I like
Enjoy this fun and flirty exchange of backstory! This chapter was one of the first parts of this story that I wrote, so I'm excited to finally connect it to the whole (yes, I've been living with the secret of Harry+Luna+threesomes this whole time).
Harry gave Draco another one of his unguarded laughs, and Scorpius looked up at the exchange, as if trying to understand it.
Draco hardly had to ask; Scorpius pulled his father out the front door with a terrifying show of force for a 10-year-old. As the front door closed behind them, Draco could almost hear the sigh of relief his mother exhaled at their departure.
“Like I said,” I nod, not sure what to do with this information, “I found out when I was eleven. The headmaster of our school, the Mage, came to my care home.”
“Apparently Blaise helped draw off some of the Carrow’s attention,” Harry continued, mostly to fill the silence. Maybe hoping that, in repeating Ginny’s words, he’d find some measure of truth in them. “He helped Neville stage some rebellion. Ginny joined. They got cozy.”
“No, you moron. You!” Huffing, Draco muttered, “Moron.” He found the insults slightly grounding. Maybe that was what this evening needed. A reprisal of schoolyard taunts. That’d be a mature way to react as a 32-year-old man.
Harry dropped his utensils, took a deep sip of his drink and leaned back. “That’s a loaded question.”
The responding moan left Draco bereft of all thought and caution. Allowing both hands purchase in that black mane, he pressed his body flush against Harry, satisfied to feel the mutual effects of the extended seduction. He mouthed along Harry’s jaw, drawing up the courage to taste his mouth, but faltered once there. He dropped his forehead to Harry’s.
Sorry for the lengthy wait time! Post a cliffhanger... get struck by writer's block. Such is the life of a work in progress. It's possible this story may end up being 22 chapters now, but I wanted to post this ASAP given the wait.
Draco stood from the couch, stretching his hands overhead in an effort to get his blood circulating again. He turned to see if Harry needed a hand getting up, but Harry seemed to be looking anywhere but at Draco. Shrugging, Draco headed toward the kitchen, Harry trailing behind shortly after.
After dinner, the boys ran back out to the pitch, leaving Harry and Draco on the sidelines, stuck with the arduous task of drafting the actual statement. In many ways, the resulting battle over phrasing and figures of speech reminded Draco of the fights they waged as schoolboys over much more serious topics. However, as an adult the arguments invigorated Draco rather than draining him. From the energy Harry demonstrated while striking back, Draco assumed the same went for him.
No one deemed it necessary to tell him about the blood quill and since Delores was obliviated of the entire event, she wasn't saying anything about it.
It was everything Sev had ever described. There were floating never-drip candles making the whole room seem cosy even as the grandeose architecture gave off an intimidating noble vibe. The ceiling was charmed to look like it disappeared into the sky with clouds and everything. He overheard Hermione behind him mention that it was charmed to resemble the weather so you would know before hand what time of day as well as if you needed rain gear that day. There were four long tables with equally long benches for each of the four houses and at the head there was a series of seven steps and the raised portion held the professors table. Harry saw Sev at the very end in front of the Slytherin table watching closely. At the center sat the headmaster Albus Dumbledore.
"You can't be serious. You mean to tell me a boy the same age as my own son, is being hunted by both sides of a war he had no choice but to participate in? Has Albus gone mad!" Lucius replied.
Harry was now officially frustrated. Neither he or Hermione had any ideas about a stone that could recreate a body. Draco, being the stubborn pointy git that he was, only had one idea, but the Philosophers Stone was cosidered a myth according to every text they read.
Draco was suddenly struck by how the others were talking amongst themselves about mundane topics regarding the upcoming school year, giving Draco valuable time to gather his thoughts. For which he was grateful.
Lucious entered the Minister of Magics office. Fudge was next to useless with the actual war, but he made a good go between for the Order of the Pheonix and the old coot Dumbledore. No it wasnt a lie that he didn't like the old headmaster (always seemed to know too much with that stupid twinkle in his eye that never failed to make you wonder what you were missing).
"This is the first I've heard of this as well. Doesn't happen often, but once a blue moon my mother decides on something rather suddenly. Though you won't see me complaining too much." Draco admitted freely.
"So, whats it like having a death eater like Snape as a dad?" Ron asked, a sneer on his frekled face.
Severus landed in the Dark Lords meeting room. Sure enough there was Lucius. Although first things first.
"But you see, it is. I am banking of you winning this bloody war, and if we are going to survive it then whatever has that defeated look you are always sporting needs to stop being a problem. And I intend to make that happen." Draco said, stamping his foot for good measure, reminding Harry of a petulant child not getting to play with a toy. It was more than a little adorable and Harry couldn't help but chuckle a bit.
Draco obliges Simon with a scowl that deepens when I join them. Looking at Harry’s subsequent advancement, “Oh no. The bed’s crowded enough without having to accommodate
"Draco? As in Malfoy? Not that slithery snake. The whole families from Slytherin. Evil the lot of them. Howd you fall in with them?" Harry was surprised by this boys audacity. They hadnt even introduced themselves and Harry was already extremely uncomfortable.
Both Hermione and Harry left quickly, heading for the library. They needed to figure out what was guarding the stone and why Sev and Professor Quirell were after it.
His only real hope was if someone came looking for one of them. Surely Dumbledore would. They may not be close anymore but those curses had to have set off some kind of alarm. Someone had to be coming, if he could just hold out until someone came. Harry dodged another spell, this one a sickly pale shade of red.
It was exactly 6 weeks into the school year when Ron asked him a question that instantly made him angry.
Knowing Harry as I now do, and keeping in mind that I still don't know him very well on a personal level, I believe yours and Dracos lack of trust in his words will likely have him feeling quite rejected. I am sure I don't need to remind you what happens within a few days of a veela being rejected do I?" Lucius' words were carried by a weight that Severus knew too well.
"Ronald Weasley if you dont drop it I will hex you from here to the library myself. I swear if you keep this up you'll make our ears bleed." Ginny added. She had also grown tired of her brothers ranting.
Once at the front Harry noticed a stool and there on it sat the sorting hat. Harry watched in fascination as the old beat up wizards hat started singing of all things. Sev had said before that the thing was obnoxious and that no hat should be able to talk no matter who it belonged to or what enchanted it.
It was also no secret that the Weasley family supported Harry Potter and the effort to put an end to Voldemort once and for all. And they did so with religeous, classic red head tenacity and boldness.
"Perfect. Now, how would I unlock my family estate?" Harry continued, he was starting to lose track of everything, he could tell, but he would let himself process it all later. For now he knew he needed out of this office, but wanted somewhere to go.
"Alright, I trust you. I can not wait to see you again this winter for yule. I'll have the elves put up a real traditional holiday. I know you will have social obligations by then and won't be here for the whole break, but for yule itself it will be nice to have you here and relax. Tell me everything that happens when you get back. Hold your own Grandson." Charlus wasn't the type to say the words but that was the closest to 'I love you and goodbye' as he was likely to get.
"Don't you speak to me like that. Now come, we can finish up your shopping and you can stay with us the rest of the summer, but I expect you to apologize for worrying Albus and your family." Molly went to grab his shoulder to herd him and Harry stepped out of her reach.
Sev sat there thinking for a moment. Harry didn't know anything about the stone did he? Surely not there was no way he could. . . . Well, Harry was always finding himself in interesting situations. Never truely dangerous, but this could be different. . . . He would be making his challenge a good bit more complicated now and Dumbledore could go kiss a troll for all he cared. He was not going to make it easy for anyone to make it into the mirror room.
Harry sat alone for about twenty minuets before the door opened and he was greeted by red hair and a rat.
The others silently agreed. Harry being shy was the main issue. Along with being good hearted in general. Not to mention he was just small for his age. Thus everyone felt the need to protect him.
Harry was at lunch. The quittich team had surrounded him again despite him coming in early to get some peace and quiet.
"A horcrux. The Dark Lord split his soul in pieces, leaving them in protected objects, tying him to the living plane. That's why he didn't die. When he tried to kill me, my mother used a blood bond with me to create a shield that could rebound one spell with absolute power. Meaning any one spell shot at me would be rebounded. Any spell at all. She counted on the Dark Lord to cast the killing curse. When it rebounded though, his body was destroyed and his split soul scattered. One piece lodging into the scar left behind by the blood shield my mother created, and the other disappearing to later possess Quirell in first year." Both adults looked stunned. Harry had most of that figured out already, having read the journal his mother left him, Dumbledores meddling be damned. The bank goblins were perfectly nice enough to send him the journal with one well written letter explaining why he hadn't come in to settle his accounts back in fourth year. And while it was true that the last piece of the puzzle had only just fallen into place, doesn't mean that it didn't make sense.
"Yeahm maybe." Harry mumbled in reply. 'Keep your head down'. Apparently that wouldn't work anymore.
It was only ten minuets later that Lucious announced the party was moving on and things began to move as everyone scattered to enjoy further conversation in the gardens while the family and closer friends and very few others stayed to see the gift opening.
One man was really tall, with long black hair and a sharp look to him all over. His clothes were all black and he seemed in a dour mood as it were. The other was only a bit shorter than the other with long hair that almost glowed silver. He was pale and seemed rather drawn back. He sneered at Petunia as she offered tea. The sneer almost seemed to darken the whole mans face just as him smiling fondly at Harry seemed to lighten it. These men were..... Odd.
“I don’t know what I was thinking, agreeing to this,” Draco continued, taking Hermione’s silent cue to unleash his burden. “I mean, Astoria’s given me so much, and she’s never asked for anything in return. She means well, even if I know she’s wrong. And I shouldn’t expect anything different from Scorpius. I’ve been absent on purpose, which I used to think was better, but I’m starting to think is worse.
“What did you do to Simon?” I snarl, embracing my inner villain. Turns out, it doesn’t bother me to tap that well when Simon’s life is on the line.
“No,” Draco commanded. “We are not doing your Gryffindor pity-party routine. You do not get to ask me about last night. We’re on Draco-time right now. You can pick apart my psyche later. First,” Crossing his arms over his chest, “I want to complain about the book.”
Draco was pretty sure Potter couldn’t hear the sound of Draco’s internal explosion, but if he could, he’d expect Potter would be impressed with the way Draco powered through the glass crashing and debris spreading in his brain to make his retort.
Exactly what he didn’t need this morning. Draco crumpled up the note, then hit it with a burst of Incendio, making Winifred hoot in fear. Sighing, Draco stroked the eagle owl until she forgave him for the sudden outburst.
They sidled up to the bar. It wasn’t too busy; they’d arrived before the pre-Bingo crush. Draco caught the bartender’s attention easily enough and ordered two house reds. Draco watched Harry’s face as the bartender poured two cups full of mystery liquid from a cold-box, his curiosity evident.
“He Owled me, but, unfortunately I received so much mail in those first days that it took me too long to respond,” Draco said.
Salazar, how would Draco survive these continued confessions? He had to admit that juicy gossip almost tempted him. Almost. “Hmm,” Draco hummed, relishing the spark of hope rising in Harry’s eyes. “Tempting, but still no.”
“Sounds perfect,” Lavender said. “Oh, and, Draco? Don’t think we aren’t discussing why you were so freaked out I might set you up.”
“Don’t pout, Draco,” Hermione commanded, then sighed. “Really, as far as Harry Healing Sessions go, he seems to have gone easy on you. I think those two questions are perfect for your situation. I know you haven’t been challenged in this role for awhile; that’s why I’ve been recommending you for open positions. But, I know I sometimes push people before they’re ready.” She sighed. “I can’t tell you if fear is holding you back, that’s something you have to decide for yourself. But I can tell you that yes, I was terrified of the new role. Have you ever heard of imposter syndrome?”
“Huh. Mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, buttered noodles, dinosaur chicken nuggets, and about every type of chocolate dessert invented. Can’t say I’ve ever seen such a bizarre selection from Kreacher before,” Harry observed.
“Potions class, of course, requires no innate magickal prowess. It does help at times, such as lighting the fire under the cauldron or stirring, but even a Squib can manage basic potions.”
Draco shrugged. “Your last answer covered it. Just say, ‘Asked and answered’ if you feel like they’re beating a dead dragon.”
“I happened to look in the mirror, eventually,” Harry confessed. “Not all of us pull it off so well.”
Real talk: is the POV/First Person/Third Person switch hard to swallow? It doesn't bother me, but I wrote this so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“Oh, it’s nothing to do with you,” Harry said, running his hands through his hair in what must be his go-to nervous fidget. “Only, I’m still really private, and I’ve been working on a project that made me even more private, and I guess I just wasn't sure how to welcome a new person into my life. You realize I haven’t really met any new wizards for a decade or so.”
Wednesday started off better than Tuesday. Draco woke up with his alarm, made breakfast, and almost finished The Prophet when the sound of little feet entering the kitchen caught his attention.
Harry doesn’t correct him. Draco’s spit of Harry’s name no longer has the same punch. Sometimes, it even feels fond.
He knew he now found value in being the person behind the scenes in a way younger Draco never could have. Perhaps it was the public disgrace he’d experienced that changed him into someone weary of the spotlight. Or maybe he’d never actually been comfortable there. After all, it was never the public’s affection Draco sought, but his father’s.
“You’re patronizing me,” Simon complains, but he kisses the back of Baz’s head. Then, he tucks his chin over Baz’s shoulder. “Well. There you have it.”
“Definitely not,” Harry says. Running his hands through his hair. “It’s not fair for me to tell you his story while he’s not awake to defend it.” He remembers the origin of this line of thought. “But you’re not wrong. Perhaps there was always something deeper to my suspicions.”
Swallowing, Draco took on the role of voice of reason. “No, I think we were discussing The Prophet trying to out Potter’s and my illicit and fictitious relationship.”
Draco sat up straighter, dusting imaginary dirt off his tailored robes. As if he didn’t already know he looked fantastic.  “Lavender, have I mentioned how gorgeous you look today? I’d ask if you’d done something different with your hair, but, come to think of it, you always look rather fetching.”
Draco spent the rest of the day in a haze. Thankfully, Hermione got caught in meeting after meeting, leaving Draco to tackle reorganization projects he’d been keeping on hold. As he labeled folders, filed paper, and vanished old documents, Draco thought about what Harry had said.
Sighing, Draco let Scorpius walk into the fireplace, and, since avoiding things was the method of the day, Draco did not ask Scorpius to leave behind his now slightly worn copy of ‘The Wrong Sider.’
Astoria laughed. “Yes, right up there with elbows on the dinner table: discussing genitals before dessert. Not exactly the pinnacle of pure-blood etiquette.”
Three faces turned to Draco. Waiting. He pushed back the absurdity of it all, the entire whirlwind of the last 12 hours, and took a deep breath.
“Thankfully not,” Harry said, his expression wistful and sad. It made Draco want to give him a Hufflehug, and it also made Draco want to throw himself off a broomstick from the height of a Quidditch goal post.
Draco’s heart sank and he drained his wine. Of course. Any man in Astoria’s life would need to build a relationship with Scorpius. Logically, he knew this. Supported it, even. Only, he flashed back to his previous night’s revelation. As happy as he was for his friend, it stung that Astoria would now have precisely what Draco discovered his life was missing.
“I’m an excellent actor.” Draco’s reddening face betrayed the minimal effort it would take to bluff the role.
“To ask a question.” I suppress the urge to eye roll. Their eyes widen and they nod. “When are the two of you going to stop with the Potter/Malfoy nonsense?”
“No,” Harry admitted. “It’s a new addition. After spending that evening watching Scorpius and Teddy with you, I thought it might be nice to have some other areas of outdoor seating. And, well,” Now he managed to look sheepish, “The house heard the wish and made it real.”
Finally, the ink dried, the dust settled, and Harry toasted their teamwork with two bottles of craft beer from a new wizarding brewery.
“Smaller,” Draco smirked. “At least, you were.” He straightened up, using the advantage of his two inches over Harry. “Still are, actually.”
I kiss my favorite spot on his neck, just below the hairline over his scar, and sigh. “Because you look so good with it falling loose on your face,” I whisper in his ear. On second thought, this confession doesn’t hurt at all.
Draco gave Harry a confused stare, but was interrupted before he could say anything by Scorpius remembering people other than Aunt Pansy were in the room.
Scorpius stopped short in the doorway, suddenly transfixed by the sight in front of him. He’d met Hermione and Ron enough times to have passed this starstruck phase. But clearly nothing had prepared Draco’s child for the sight of his father eating Indian food with the Chosen One.
A small weight lifted off his shoulders as he recognized the nervous tick they both shared. Pansy was a bitch. A bitch who bought inappropriate books for his son and invited his whatever-Harry-was into her home. But she was his oldest friend, after all. She could be there for him. Despite the intruder.
With a brief kiss to the top of Baz’s head, Simon looks up at Harry and Malfoy. “We were roommates at school.”
Draco nodded, surprised as always at her memory. He suspected Hermoine employed a series of charms and spells to keep up with her fast-paced life, but the degree to which nothing escaped her notice never failed to impress him.
No one answered. Draco didn’t want them to. He let them sit in the silent wake of his question for a few minutes, then cleared his throat. “How did the author know about the forced Crucios? How did they know the exact pain I felt when taking the mark?”
She frowned and walked to his desk. Peering over his shoulder, “It looks normal to me? Except—” She slapped his shoulder. “
“I’m skiving off work, actually,” Draco grinned. “Scorpius wanted to visit Hogsmeade, and I’ve decided to indulge him.”
Like a toddler, Harry threw himself back against the booth and crossed his arms. The perfect picture of a pout.
“Oh,” Harry breathed. “That’s a relief, actually. I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, either, but people keep telling me it’s a big deal and asking me when I’m going to announce it.”
Now, Draco opened his eyes. “Circe, you Gryffindors are so easy to rile up.” He added a saucy smirk to punctuate his taunt.
Harry glared. “Real friends don’t let recent empty nesters wallow in self-pity.” Harry turned his glare to Draco’s wine, as if it were the one pouring itself into Draco’s mouth.
business.” She stepped into the fireplace. “Oh, and do try not to picture what my husband and I will do when I return home,” She leered at Harry. “That would be quite the invasion.” Then, the fire rose, and Harry and Draco found themselves alone in the room.
“You’re friends with Harry Potter?” Scorpius asked, and the kid finally looked Draco in the eyes. Stamping down the injustice he felt at this small act, Draco was definitely not thinking about how Emil might have reacted in this situation (because if Draco
Number 12 Grimmauld Place could design many other rooms at Harry’s pleasure, Draco understood from his knowledge of wizarding home dynamics. But the only additions he’d made were the Quidditch pitch, the ancestral room, and the house elf memorial. At least, these were the only custom rooms Harry included on the tour.
Walking into the office, Draco tried and failed to ignore the growing dread of what Astoria might want to discuss with him later this evening.
With satisfaction, Harry noted the level of shell shock on Draco’s face superseded the way he’d looked after Blaise ran away, arm-in-arm, with Harry’s bride.
Draco still didn’t believe her, but he answered anyway. “She’s fine. Still married to Father, but still not bringing it up to me. Honestly, if I’d had this arrangement as a child, I’d probably be way better adjusted.” Taking another sip of wine, he thought again of Emil and the vanishing cabinet, trying to suppress the shiver up his spine.
Because he could admit his job hadn’t been challenging for some time. When he’d first started, he constantly tackled problems. Granted, many of the problems were related to Draco being a former death eater. But some were interesting ones. Like how to convince other departments to collaborate on legislation. Or how to manipulate the bureaucracy to give Hermione’s department a well-deserved financial boost. Even how to get the Office of Supply Management to order the quills he preferred.
She laughed and leapt out of his reach before he could reclaim his property. “Oh, Potter, don’t you know? We Slytherins have the kinds of kinks Gryffindors wouldn’t
“No!” Harry objected, his hand flying to his mouth to cover another yawn. “I can answer more questions.”
Harry pondered this for a moment, fixing those big green eyes on Draco’s for longer than was comfortable. “Honestly, I’m not sure which answer would upset you more: that I lack manners to welcome a guest properly, or that I hadn’t tailored a greeting plan just for you.”
Once again remembering Harry’s threesome confession, Draco decided to fully retaliate. “All that mattered was how well I sucked cock.”
Sometimes, the chapters are way longer than normal. This will become more common as the story goes on.
“And more,” I joke, remembering Blue’s words at the Hoover Dam. I give his hand a brief squeeze and release it.
Despite knowing they’d been manipulated once again, Harry and Draco allowed the misdirection, though Draco filled up both of their glasses of wine with the remaining portion of the Malfoy Manor selection, leaving Hermione without another drop.
Harry should be annoyed by their constant flirting, but it’s somehow soothing in the dim room with Draco’s warm body inches away from Harry’s. Simon’s tail is once again stroking the inseam of Baz’s pajama leg, red wings pressed against the headboard, Baz’s body pressed fully against Simon.
She groaned. “How do you still not see your own worth? I may have clever ideas, but sometimes my persuasion is quite…” She looked at Draco’s face, and smirked. “Well it’s shit, ok. I know it, you know it. No sense in hiding it. Just look at S.P.E.W.”
Hermoine leaned forward and placed her hand on Draco’s forearm. “Draco, is it,” She swallowed. “Is it bringing up bad memories?”
Harry drank from his self-refilling cup, leaning against a brick wall while Draco and Treasure sat in plastic patio chairs and shared a cigarette. “Tell me the story of how you two met.”
“Mmhmm,” She replied. “Well,” Shuffling papers on her desk, “If that’s your story, I won’t push. Besides, I have a proposal to complete before meeting with Shacklebolt. Would you mind keeping my door shut and turning away any visitors until after lunch?”
The night started on the right foot. After Scorpius exited the Floo, Rose took one look at his book, and started chattering about recreating some of the scenes. Draco was certain even the wine couldn’t save him if they started to mime fixing vanishing cabinets, but the two settled on a Quidditch scene, enjoying the expansive lawn that the Granger-Weasley’s shared with the original Weasley’s—those of The Burrow I.
I sigh, pinching my nose. I can’t stay mad at him, the sentimental fool. “You’re in charge of untangling it,” I point.
There’s no room for dissent in her request. Not that I have any. Simon may have appeared the more thunderstruck of the two of us, but I’m not immune to Hogwart’s charms (except the name. Grotesque).
Draco waggled his eyebrows. “That’s because it’s magic,” And he reveled in Harry’s shock. “It’s charmed to taste like your favorite wine,” He explained. “The charm does tend to make the wine a bit too sweet, and sometimes there’s a metallic aftertaste, but still. A neat trick, right?”
Sitting, and gesturing for Harry to do the same, Draco sighed. “Honestly, I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been so absent in his life; the idea that I could waltz in now and become a father to him after what I’ve done… I don’t know if I have the right.”
“Mr. Malfoy! I take it this young man is whom you’ve referred to my services?” Guillaume greeted, a note of disdain in his voice.
As if manifested into existence by his internal queries, the Whirlwind descended in front of Draco’s desk.
like me, you know? He had Pansy as a beard, and then his dark missions to distract his parents from whatever it was Draco wanked to at night.” Glancing at Draco, “I’m not treading on too personal a thread, am I?”
“Well, that explains everything,” Pansy shot Draco a dubious glare as she gently tapped the back cover of the book.
“Don’t,” Draco held up his left hand, winced, and stumbled back, hastily rolling down the sleeves of his shirt until they covered his forearms.
“I think I have to go back to work now,” Draco said, still feeling like his insides had been somehow removed, shaken, and then shoved back in with no consideration to their original order. He stood up, and walked to the door, watching his legs move with amazement that they could do so without his brain’s input.
“For giving yourself the space to change. For not judging yourself for ending up somewhere you never expected to be. For allowing yourself to be happy.”
“But after Voldemort died, people were so focused on moving forward that they stopped to remember a) the whole wizarding world had just experienced a significant trauma and b) Voldemort was the symptom, not the cause, of many of the issues that led to the war.
“No,” Harry shook his head. “No, I think it’d be good to talk about it.” He took a deep breath. “Honestly, before things fell apart after sixth year, I couldn’t have imagined a future without Ginny. She represented everything I wanted in life: home, stability, love. Plus,” Here, Harry grinned. “She was smart, resourceful, and full of life. More traits I appreciate. I ended things with her just before I took off with Hermione and Ron.” Harry paused. “You know the story?”
It wasn't that Harry hated his father either. He was certain that, given the incentive, his father would have grown past his lack of responsibility and been an excellent role model for him had he survived the first war and had likely been working on that when he found out he was to be a father. At least Harry hoped his existence was enough to help his father grow into himself a little more.
Snape was getting frustrated by how little progress he was making in occlumency and Draco was fed up with him not telling anyone what was going on with him.
He had spoken to Minerva about Harry being on the house team. It had yet to affect his work but you would have to be an idiot to not notice Harry's exhaustion.
It was incredibly strange to Draco trying to sort through his options. He'd never really had options before. He had to stand by his family after all. But now the family was divided and he had to pick a side, regardless of what consequences came about.
Still, in the last two weeks Harry had learned a great deal, and knew he had a lot of very embarrassing apologies to make to several people. The Malfoy family and Snape to name a few.
Harry was currently hiding behind one of the desks in the farthest corner of the room from where Umbridge was.
"Expelliarmus! Protego!" Harry really wanted out of this room. He could still prove what was going on as long as he had the quill and lines themselves.
"I plan on it. I read that somewhere in the library here, I just haven't made an appointment yet. It still messes with my head a bit that I might be able to bear kids myself. It wouldn't be all that bad though to be honest. I wouldn't mind having my own family to take care of. I'm kind of tired of being the strong one all the time." Harry admitted.
He also found that many of the votes cast in his name as of the last few years, didn't really align with his beliefs anyway, which saddened him greatly. His current proxy, a certain headmaster, wasn't voting for the kind of reforms that Harry was told he would be fighting for. Just recently for example was further restrictions on werewolves. Dumbledore had voted in favor of those restrictions using Harry's seat.
Ok, so there is a plan, but will it succeed. Let me know what you think as always in the comments below, I do read them all. See you next chapter.
A large bed on one side. A dressor on the other. A desk by the window and a small bookshelf next to the desk.
The boy was nuts about practice. They easily went 3 hours straight daily. Harry had to be brought up to speed with the game and quickly. Oliver made it his personal mission to make a seasoned player out of Harry in only two months since that's when the season started.
Umbridge shows her toad skin. I can not express to you how much I hate this character. In canon she isn't given much in the way of a character other than nasty. She is every PTA Karen Mom/ Political lying pig in history smushed together to form one person and that is her entire personality. So, my version is going to include a bit more depth than a bone dry kiddy pool.
Harry smiled and nodded confidently before he took slipped through the door. He took a pinch of floo powder, grabbed hold of his fully packed and lightened trunk, and stepped into the flames.
Harry, being shy in nature, was immediately intimidated by the loud, boisterous, and huggy group. He had immediately gotten used to keeping the curtains around his bed closed while doing anything in the dorm room.
"Parkinson. I see you brought help. Come on out Zabini, I saw you through the shelves." Ginny called. The boy rounded on the opposite side of the isle as Pansy had, effectively blocking any exit.
He sat at the other end of the table, clearly separated from Ron and Hermione. The entire hall was staring at his except Draco who couldn't look at him without blushing now. And cute as it was Harry understood he had a reputation to maintain.
"Dray! I've been at practice. I'm sorry." Harry knew that particular look. Most wouldn't be able to read Draco but Harry knew he had hurt his feelings by vanishing.
This comment had gotten a small laugh from Harry, who was surprised to feel a sense of relief. Lucius had kept his word.
Turns out it's rather easy. Sharing his toys and things with Draco was fun and the two were running about the large room hiding and finding each other and starting a game they made up on the spot where if the other caught you, you'd have to do something silly.
The castle was beautifully decorated. The draping for each house on either side of the door to the great hall. The enormous double doors stood heavy and ornate and very very closed.
"I see. While I fail to see how that's any business of his, I do appreciate the olive branch. If he agrees, I see no reason why we can't have a cease fire. And as for the other thing, um, how did you find out?" Harry asked his face red.
He was out for his nap before they could answer. Four year old Draco was out like a candle and even more precious.
"The longest six months ever. I will mend this Lucius. Tomorrow I will find out what's going on once and for all, and when I do I will fix it." He may not have said it out loud, but Severus vowed to himself to make amends someway, but first he needed to know what he was up against.
"Did you know Harry, that most of the potions I use here are made by the newt students? Obviously Severus keeps an eye out to make sure they will work properly, but the newt students are partially responsible for the potions I require here." Poppy said conversationally as she started to unwrap his hand.
Harry had been tortured with a blood quill for a month, right under his nose, and he had chosen to not believe Harry when he said he had no idea.
So, here's the deal. In canon Umbridge makes an UmBitch of herself fairly quickly. Here I'm going to make her annoying until now because reasons.
With this less hostile Snape, Harry was left wondering if he had finally snapped and was hallucinating.
"Come now Severus, no need to be tense. I meant what I said, that boy is never anything but honest. If someone were doing something illegal, say, attacking other students, he would not be quiet about it. That being said, you also must remember he is still unpracticed in our ways; he isn't going to react the way he should every time something upsets him. Patience is key, but so is trust and communication. You may be fated, but you will all be miserable if you do not learn to trust each other.
With that though Harry nodded to them both and slipped back under his cloak and walked away. He heard Snape and Malfoy call out for him, but he had long since learned to walk silently when he wanted to.
And so, with nothing else for it, Harry had gone to breakfast, likely looking worse than he had ever before, but he didn't care. No one else seemed to either.
The last few letters were from Lords wanting marriage matches for their daughters or sons and promising many heirs to the Potter name to regrow the family and name.
"No. I will not. I started shopping alone and I intend to go home alone when I have finished. I will not be herded like cattle. Now if you'll excuse me, I really must be going." Harry said trying to back away from the now irate woman.
Narcissa looked on in amusement, sipping her tea and giving Lucious a pointed look as if to silently tell him he had better give her son everything his heart desired.
Lucius had stopped by and mentioned that Harry didn't seem to be feeling alright either and asked what was wrong. Harry told him he had no idea and that the school nurse couldn't figure it out either.
Draco had no doubt that dealing with Umbridge and the death of his god father had likely affected him in many negative ways, but now that he was paying attention, it seemed to have gone back to fourth year. It was right when the school year started. It almost seemed like Potter was falling apart and not in any kind of productive way either. He was more secretive. Harder to rile up.
When Harry finally found it within himself to tell his grandfathers portrait what had happened while he was out, Charlus Potter spent a good half hour laughing uproariously.
"I can't. Albus intends him to die. According to him he must or the Dark Lord will never truly die himself. I spoke my misgivings, and now Albus bloody Dumbledore won't tell me anything at all." So Snape was trying to protect him from both sides. His bad attitude made a lot of sense now.
"Well, that's the best news I've ever heard. Im in." Remus Lupin announced as he strolled in unannounced, though frankly they were barely passed the entry way as it was, a wolfish grin plastered on his face.
"Thank you. I don't deserve it, but I could use your help. I may have an idea that will keep us all alive, but it's a long shot." Draco announced. The others huddled in to hear the plan, not noticing theor head of house wearing a rare smirk just outside the common room entrance.
He had quickly packed, but stopped to transfigure copies of everything he owned and placed the copies where the items were normally.
This was not the scene Harry prefered though. Harry liked the years previous where he and Draco celebrated together a week after Dracos birthday and 2 weeks before his and exchanged gifts in the comfort of friends and family.
His classes were alright, but transfiguration was a test since Professor Mcgonigal was on the headmasters side and had spent the time after class yelling at him for ignoring the summons and taking points off for his 'disrespect'. She had then tried to drag him to the headmasters office, only to be told that there was nothing that the headmaster could possibly need to speak to him about since his grades for the year were above average and he had no detentions so far.
From the very beginning he had been breaking rules, ignoring or disrespecting authority figures and generally making a mockery of himself.
The nearest empty compartment faced the platform and the boys waved to her promising to write and waving bye. It was another ten minuets before the train left and they had time to settle in for the long ride.
The staff had been less than helpful so far, so it was now time to move her attentions to the youngest and (if only in her own mind) the most vulnerable of Dumbledores circle.
"Will it make you go away?" Draco sneered. He hated how little muggle born children were prepared before being dumped at school to learn something they had no knowledge existed until a month or so ago.
Hermione was beginning to think actually talking with the Slytherins was the only clue they were going to get. Besides, if Draco was on their side now, it only made sense that most of Slytherin house was as well.
"I look sophisticated. At least I'm not cursed with your mop. Did you even comb it?" Draco retourted sneering at the insult.
He was definately being watched. Harry could practically feel Dumbledores eyes on him all day. Breakfast was when it started. The headmaster had tried to summon him to his office again, a summons that Harry ignored.
"Draco, quit pacing. We need to figure out what's wrong with him. And since he's so determined not to say what we'll have to do this our way." Severus said, trying to calm the blonde teen who was still wearing a hole in the carpet.
"Mother, you aren't serious? We'll be hunted for sure." Draco, just removing himself from the shock, stated rather matter of factly.
"Unfortunately that would be difficult. He's set up shop at the Manor. Unless you figured out how to kill the bastard for good, it might be safer to go about as is. I do want you to do me a favor though. Off something does happen to me, make sure Cissa and Draco get these." Draco handed Fudge two letters one addressed to his wife and ther to his son.
"Sorry Grandfather, just a lot still to do. My wrist is already cramping and I still need to write back to a few more people and calculate the advantages of the investments Griphook sent me. After that though I think I will take a break. I still have a lot to figure out, and I still have the mediwitch coming over later today to fix my eyesight. The work never seems to end." Harry bemoaned to the painting.
It seemed to Harry that walking out on the people he thought he could trust was a new habit he was forming. Not that it didn't stab at his heart in a painful fashion. It felt like his very soul was shattering.
Harry accepted that knowing that Draco had been right. They had bad history to get past before any kind of relationship would be possible.
So what do you thing guys? Also dont worry, I plan to redeem at least the twins, but I apparently cant stand Ron any more than Dumbles.
"Honestly Draco, it's nothing much. Just a lot on my mind to be honest." Harry answered dispassionately. The cold draft in the empty classroom where Harry had decided to sulk causing him to shiver just a bit.
"Alright, but I still don't know what to get you. Your house isn't nearly as obvious." Draco admitted.
"I will be happy to accept your generosity of course. The time is perfect. Good day Mr. Potter." Malfoy senior walked away after that and while Draco remained silent, there was a curious light in his eyes as well as he looked Harry over almost approvingly.
"I'm in." Draco said quietly, just enough to be heard without truely interrupting. It was a weight lifted from his shoulders and rolled off.
The Aurors were always looking for a reason the shut down Borgin and Burkes and the vanishing cabinet there led to the one he saw in the room where Potters little defense club practiced the year before. He had no idea what it was doing in there when it clearly seemed broken and he had watched it vanish into the room when Umbridge burst in. He knew what it was almost instantly from the rune carvings on the door.
"Ha! Coming from you that's a compliment. Now remember what we discussed and don't let Dumbledor into your head. Continue reading about occlumency and do your best to create a barrier. I know we can't test it without another wizard, but better to have at least some protection and...."
Well, putting things lightly, it was rather hectic at work for a while after that. And the goblins were not happy that something was carried out against the will while they were meant to be the acting benefactors. Dumbledore got quite the tongue lashing (enough to make Lucious giddy though he'd never show it), and it was decided that with the clear abuse on top of the legal aspects Harry would be out of the Dursleys hands fairly quickly.
Severus, however, was currently battling with his own instincts. He had wanted nothing more than to chase after his young mate, to make the pain go away, but he also needed answers.
"How long have you known all this? Why not come to someone sooner?" Severus asked, feeling a bit off balance and more than a little embarrassed for not noticing all this during the failed occlumency lessons.
Harry nodded morosely. He had to admit that he agreed. He would prefer Voldemort killing him over the idea or Dumbledore somehow forcing his compliance.
And Lucious, the Slytherin that he was, took off for the ministry with Severous in tow. If they were to save the boy they would do so without giving anyone any legal loophole to put the child back in that blasted muggle house.
Someone tell me they can feel the tension I'm putting between Harry and Draco. It feels like I am but also not sure if its angsty enough either....
"Come along, we'll get you settled. Nothing here is as fancy as I'm sure it once was but we manage. You'll be perfectly safe here." Molly announced guiding Narcissa upstairs to the bedrooms, ironically placing her in her old bedroom before she was married.
Once his outer robe was fastened he had no other means of wasting time, yet still he lingered, really not wanting to face the public.
Madam Pomphrey nodded as she spelled Harry into a healing sleep, having noticed an overdose of dreamless sleep in Harrys system already that needed purging and rebandaged his hand now that he no longer was shivering.
As the prominent young lord that he was, he decided, much to his grandfathers delight, that the muggle clothes had to go. Harry had made several appointments to different private tailors and had an entire wardrobe made for himself to reflect his status. They were uncomfortable for all of a few days, but going from over sized rags to clothes made to fit would have made anyone uncomfortable for at least a while, no matter the material.
He could already tell that class would be a chore this year. She reminded him so much of some sick love child between his Aunt Marges dog ripper and a diseased toad, that he almost laughed at the mental image.
Now as nice as it is to see you so concerned, I have my own papers to grade." With that Minerva had closed the argument and left. Looked like he would need to get Madam Pomfrey involved if he wanted things done. If anyone was more stubborn than Minerva, it was Pomona and there was no way the biased git of a headmaster would take his side, Harrys health be damned.
"Of course. We can talk at length once the children are settled. Were you looking for a place to hide out?" Molly asked, ever the optimist despite probably being the fiercest member of the large family.
Once word had gotten out that the tournament had emancipated him, he had been flooded with letters. He had had a few of the house elves help him sort them all. Several were from virulent fans and were burned without reservation, Harry informing his grandfather that he owed the public absolutely nothing. A few were from members of the ministry in regards to this that and the other and the meetings being held in regards to their proper subjects. Harry had sent polite notes declining such invitations, stating that he would not be going to any gatherings until his estate was in order, which had gotten a few understanding responses stating that they simply
It would be another week before Harry would step into Snape estate for the first time. Thats how long the boy had to wait but Severous was determined to help him heal and learn to see the estate as home.
"Oh, good. You all made it alright. Lucius and Marvolo were both incredibly worried for you three." Narcissa Malfoy came into the parlor, greeting them all with a worried air.
Before she could do anything, however, she would need to get under Potters skin and find a way to get him in detention.
"Hail Mister Potter. I am Griphook, manager for the Potter accounts. I was beginning to wonder when you would come in to settle your accounts. Now that you are here we can get started. First and foremost, congratulations on your emancipation. Let us proceed." Griphook didn't necessarily speak too quickly, but had dropped a proverbial bomb on Harrys psyche.
Dinner was a lively affair, the elf kept busy between the two boys and the adults watching the boys interact excitedly while they ate.
"Well now you know what the headmaster is hiding. I assume you can use that information to keep yourself alive Mr. Malfoy? Your son worries for you, not that he'll say so out loud." Harry said in an emotionless voice that honestly worried both adults.
"Its 'may we go' Draco. Don't forget your lessons just because of a new friend." Mrs. Malfoy corrected.
"I would need to think about it, of course, but I could let you know by the time I leave for school. Somehow though, I don't think that's all you wanted to talk to me about." Harry ventured.
"But isn't magic bad? Uncle Vernon says it's for devils and evil people. Thats why i get in trouble so much." Harry asked confused.
To put it simply, none of the three were easily messed with, and they were easily to be the most influential triad once officially mated.
"Not well at all My Lord. And Draco reported he was declining quickly as well. He is quite worried. That said, if Harry says he doesn't know what's causing this illness, whatever it is, then I'm inclined to believe him. He doesn't lie if he can help it. If the change was sudden, I would observe the rest of the school. Severus, are any other students showing such symptoms?" Lucius asked turning to his friend.
Draco was excited about his many gifts. Harry had actually gotten his friend a little snake charm for a bracelet that matched Harrys as they exchanged charms on their birthday every year. It even hissed.
The party was ... For lack of a better word, frivolous. Harry understood that the Malfoy family was extremely influential in the ministry and therefore couldn't really be seen holding back for large events. That's fine.
"You mean to seek your own alliances. If the headmaster wants you dead then you don't side with him. You are your own spy. How very ... Slytherin of you." Lucius studied the young man (for he was no boy any longer) before him.
"He doesn't hate you Harry. In fact I would be hard pressed to believe you would still be alive if not for his help." Lucius answered taking a long sip of his tea. Damn him for looking so blase about turning Harrys world around.
Minerva on the other hand argued that once the other teams were sorted, the friendly matches would start. Meaning practices would not need be daily, and Harry would have plenty of time to get his work done. The team captains were required to post their final team selections by the afternoon of this up coming Friday so by next week an actual schedule for team practices would be posted.
Potions was almost therepudic that day. The rythmic chopping and dicing sounds as they made their potions (a more advanced healing draught that worked well when one has suffered traumatic but not life threatening injury) almost lulled Harry to sleep.
Before Harry could respond, Teddy and Scorpius dropped out of the sky onto the grass in front of them.
Scorpius returned his intense focus to breakfast, finishing off all of his bacon and most of his eggs before he broached the topic again. “But you’re friends now?”
Draco and Hermione have their first legislative meeting, Astoria confesses, and Draco makes a decision.
Harry startled, falling off the block and into another pile of fabric at his feet. He scrambled to cover himself up with the loose sheets of material, then tried to play it off like he’d
A bottle of beer and shot glass appeared before them. “Cheers,” Harry said, clinking his drink against Draco’s.
“Whatever you want,” Harry said, though Draco still didn’t understand why he needed such assurance. Why Harry thought Draco needed such assurance. Harry captured Draco’s wrists, pulling them out of his hair and down by his sides. Draco leaned back, just enough for green eyes to finally capture grey.
Besides, keeping mute allows me to evaluate the situation in which we’re stuck. As much as Simon seems to trust Harry, I don’t give over my stamp of approval so easily. And there is something off about him, something that feels vaguely familiar. The way his eyes sometimes unfocus if no one’s talking to him.
“Of course,” Draco snarled. He pulled out the small charm as proof. “Lifted it off his cheating ass when he came by my room to return his ring.”
“Here,” Harry said, finally standing. “Come sit on the couch with me and your dad and tell us about it.”
After staring, blinking, at the spot that used to hold Lavender for a few minutes, Draco took her message to Hermione.
“Not like this,” She breathed, clearly giddy. “You were giving him the kind of face you reserve for guys with whom you think you have a chance. For gay men only, that face.”
“They talk about me?” Draco asked, his heart filling with something that felt addictive and also frightening at the same time. Whatever it was, it quickly erased the annoyance Draco had felt at Harry’s utterly worthless explanation.
Astoria pushed back in her chair and launched herself into Draco’s arms as if the wooden table between them didn’t exist. “I knew I could convince you!” She placed a wet kiss on his cheek. “You
“I’m flattered,” Treasure said, giving Draco a curious stare, but if he doubted Draco’s story, he played along regardless. Turning to Harry, “Well, Harry. Welcome to the club, both literally and figuratively. What do you think of my place?” He opened his arms in a gesture that invited Draco and Harry to take in the sights before answering.
Draco pulled out his CL, reading through the words that might have spared them both a bit of indignity. “Well, fuck. Sorry about that.”
Harry swallowed and allowed himself the luxury of examining Malfoy without blinders for the first time in five years.
I saw your disembodied head by the Shrieking Shack! And Snape had me convinced it was a hallucination.” He shook his head, both amused and annoyed. Two emotions he’d long felt around Harry Potter. Along with maybe one other feeling that started with the letter ‘a.’ “You threw mud at my head, Potter,” He accused.
Shaking his head, Draco couldn’t imagine ever being in the headspace to consider Harry’s hypothetical. At Scorpius’s reappearance, he pushed all thoughts of what could be and what has been, and played gobstones with his son and Harry Potter.
Squaring his shoulders, “You know my family better than anyone, Potter. The rot they subjected me to, that they taught me. You of all people should know the damage I could inflict, if given unparalleled access to the next generation. Just look at my father.”
Harry eyed their drinks; both half full. Uncrossing his arms, he leaned over the table. “Draco, you can talk to me about this.”
Giving his scar a little nip, “About the fact we can see into some random bedroom through our mirror.”
“Your mother will be by shortly to take you back home,” Draco winced at the last word and hoped Scorpius didn’t notice. “Is there anything you’d like to do before then?”
Draco smoothed down one of the legs of his trousers, noting that he’d failed to change into matching shoes. He sipped more than a healthy mouthful of wine before answering. “Awful, actually.”
I’m debating the best way to ask if we’ll be confined to the bedroom when the Headmistress reads my mind.
Draco wondered if the proximity to him would change Scorpius’s mind, but the boy didn’t hesitate. He followed Harry Potter to the couch, sat between them, and told the Chosen One and the Death Eater how he thought Emil was misunderstood, and deserved a better father than the one he had.
Draco and Harry nodded, both ignoring Treasure’s last comment as they settled in for the second half of the show.
The speed at which Draco retreated from Lavender’s desk almost certainly masked the flush spreading up Draco’s neck.
“Shut it,” Draco said, all of the venom of his earlier frustration gone. Lost, probably, somewhere inside the pancake mix. “I tried to do too many things at once, and stopped watching the batter bubbles.”
The joke clearly didn’t land, given Pansy’s full strength death glare. Draco pushed back his chair, rose, and went to the living room, hoping softer furniture would help de-escalate the situation. Pansy trailed him, newspaper in hand. Draco was wondering whether Pansy would beat him with the rag or set it on fire when a sharp crack sounded as Harry Potter Apparated into Draco’s living room.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Probably to strategize his,” Draco darted his eyes around the room, as if a Prophet reporter was lying in wait to capture this lead. “
Ultimately, Draco won the battle, though it’d cost him a hefty pledge to Hermione’s house elf charity in return.
“I know that now, Draco. Of course I do. I’m just painting a picture of the broken Harry.” He smiled, and, again, Draco wondered how much of the expression was true and how much of it was what Harry wished were true. “And, then, the dreams started.”
“Actually, er,” Harry stuttered, pulling out a dented can of beans from his jacket pocket. “I requisitioned a Portkey for convenience.”
Holding up a hand, “I obviously don’t feel that way now. Only, it speaks to my mental state at the time. I was in no place to be a boyfriend. I couldn’t comfort Ginny in her loss. I couldn’t even feel my own. At least, beyond the most obvious one.
Because he’d never been one to stop while behind, Harry was the first to try again. “So, uh. He likes ‘The Wrong Sider’?”
The last few months had seen issue after issue chronicling their inane feuds over guest floo schedules and ceremony chapel timeshares. Things would only get worse when
Treasure gave Draco a look, seeking permission, which Draco granted with a slight head nod. “I knew of Draco by reputation, of course. Who didn’t? Especially as a fellow pure-blood.” If this news surprised Harry, he kept his reaction to himself. “But I didn’t go to Hogwarts. That’s why you don’t recognize me.” Treasure laughed, taking a drag of the cigarette before passing it to Draco. Blowing out a puff of smoke, “Not that I’m deluded enough to think Harry Potter would have even noticed me in school. I was a few years younger, after all.”
“Oh yeah,” I rub the back of my neck. “When I still had magic, I kind of… grew them?” My tail whips out from under me, creeping its way onto the Headmistress’s desk. Merlin forbid I ignore it. “And the tail.”
“No,” Hermione admitted. “But I understood, regardless.” She walked into her office. “Coming? Or have you already quit?”
Twenty minutes later, and three grey hairs older, Draco rushed into his office to find Hermoine Granger-Weasley already standing behind her desk.
Astoria groaned. “Draco, the whole Slytherin house played Bingo-Pottah starting my third year, your fourth year.”
I suppose it’s never good being the Chosen One. That should have been the main clue Smith-Richards wasn’t one. He wanted it too much. The spotlight. The followers. For him, there was no downside. That’s what I’ll look for. The next time a pseudo-Chosen shows up. I’ll look for the parts of their life that have been ruined because of it. Then I’ll know.
“Huh,” Harry said, scooping a chunk of icing off Draco’s plate with a finger, then shoving said finger into his mouth. Draco avoided watching the show.
has, that I may never have magic in that way again (though I never really had it to begin with). But, if I’m going to have any magic at all, I like the idea that it exists to protect me.
Eyeing the stack of yes’s with the kind of reservation only a Gryffindor could muster when faced with fine clothing, Harry sighed. “All right, Draco. Make me pretty.”
Draco waved his hand as if declining a second cup of tea, rather than explaining away how he’d willfully cut himself off from his son in a misguided act of protection. “The arrangement where Astoria and I marry despite having no interest in such a thing, sire an heir to unlock the contents of our vaults, and then Astoria raises the child alone without my involvement.”
Draco smirked, and Scorpius gaped, and then the three of them entered Number 12 Grimmauld Place to Kreacher’s overwhelming welcome.
The silence strained between them, and Draco felt a growing sense of dread stemming from his inability to soothe Harry’s nerves. Whether it was the stress of the conversation, a slip in Harry’s attention, or even the accidental catch of a stray spell, the moment broke, and Draco caught the instant Harry’s glamour fell.
“He basically asked me if being perfectly content in my job was all I wanted, or if I’m actually just afraid of failure.”
and a tray of steaming chocolate chip waffles, butter, syrup, bacon, and scrambled eggs appeared on the kitchen counter. It took Draco a second to remember Harry warned of this possibility.
Really, how could it surprise him? That Harry had organized a ‘coming out’ party at The Pub? That the whole event would serve as a fundraiser for Potter Friends? That Harry had given an invitation to Draco, personally?
Before Draco had a chance to appreciate the pride in Scorpius’s face at that observation, Harry called out, “Draco! Scorpius! Touch the beans!”
Draco sat on the bed, his wedding robes hanging open off his shoulders, his body caving into itself.
Harry looked at Draco. “Thursday?” Draco suggested. “That way, follow up stories hit Friday, the opinion pieces land over the weekend, and by Monday morning maybe people will move on to something more important?”
Harry scoffed. “Don’t presume to tell me what I mean.” He drew his hand back, crossing arms over his chest.
To further prove Draco’s point, the Floo flared, and Ronald Weasley tumbled out. “Hermione? Can you come help? I’ve got dinner.”
Suddenly, he realized where he sat. What he’d been wondering. The opportunity he’d unexpectedly been given.
“I am really very confused,” Harry said, taking in the room with wide eyes: Pansy and Blaise near tears with laughter, Draco fuming and petulant but sipping his coffee like this was just another Tuesday. “I just,” Harry huffed, “I just!” He turned those eyes on Draco, and
Draco raised an eyebrow. He’d only known Hermione to enforce a closed door, no visitors policy once, maybe twice, in his time working for her. “Sure, whatever you need.”
Despite the heat, Draco’s whole body turned cold. Ripping his arms from Harry’s grasp, he sneered, “Why would I want you?”
Draco sighed. “I know you’re not trying to be difficult here, Harry. You just want to protect this little piece of privacy you have left. Probably one of the few things the public doesn’t know about you, right? It feels sacred, this secret, and it’s not like anyone has to know. Unless,” Here Draco fixed a curious eye on Harry. “Unless there's someone? A reason you’d need to come out? A relationship?”
“No, I don’t,” Baz’s hair sweeps the side of my face as he scans the mirror. “What am I looking at?”
Also, I will accept suggestions for crossover experiences. If there’s something in particular you want to see. I can’t promise it’ll make it in, but I’ll certainly try!
That was the word Ginny had used in her break-up note. Cozy. Because she wouldn’t admit in writing what she’d really meant. Instead, she implied the betrayal in subtext hand-delivered to Harry by Percy Weasley of all people.
Shaking his head, “No. Harry, no stories. You can’t give them anything to work with. Let them wear themselves out asking as many questions as they can stand while revealing as little as possible.”
“I’m going to make you come in your trousers like a teenager,” Draco moaned in Harry’s ear. “I’ll make you forget the name of that slut who left you. Who never made you feel like
Draco leaned over and patted Harry’s leg. “You really are,” He said in a soothing voice, to which Harry growled. “Now, tell me what was more important than my wards.”
, Draco thinks, realizing the Saviour of the Wizarding World gave up the comfort of sleeping on a mattress to a dragon-boy, a vampire, and a former deatheater.
Draco’s stomach sank, but he kept his face neutral. “Of course not.” He tried on a smile. “Glad you’re making friends. Message me tomorrow?”
“This wine is good, Draco. Where’s it from?” Harry asked. Of course he did. As if things couldn’t get more awkward.
“No!” Hermione objected, falsely, as if she hadn’t once been so incensed over Ravenclaw’s Alumni Newsletter calling her CL invention “more flash than substance” that she’d gone on a months-long tirade that ended in Ron creating a light curse that spelled Hermione mute for 10 minutes anytime she said ‘Ravenclaw.’ It’d been the quietest month of Draco’s life, not counting his year of house arrest after the war. Then, Hermione threatened to withhold sex from Weasley until he gave her the countercurse. Consequently, the resulting makeup led to the conception of Hugo. Ah, the circle of life.
The elf suddenly noticed Draco, and fell into an even deeper bow. “Master Draco! What a pleasure to welcome you back to the most Ancient and Noble House of Black. Kreacher wishes to offer a belated congratulations on your siring an heir. Kreacher must wish you and Master Scorpius many long and happy years of life.”
“Who? Oh, you mean Mike?” Harry shrugged. “Fine, I guess. We only talked for a minute or two before Treasure finished his post-show work. Why do you ask?”
you can’t answer with your expressions like that. Merlin, you have no poker face.” Draco shook his head in exasperation. “Simply say, ‘I’m not currently looking, but I’m open to the possibility.”
Lavender slapped Draco’s arm again. “I can’t believe you took Harry Potter to a drag show before you took me! ”
Yes, you heard it folks. I'm writing an epilogue. It'll be short, sweet, and mostly involve brunch at Lady Ruth's house. Totally up to you if you skip it <3 should be up in a day or so (or tonight if I can get my shit together).
Harry sat beside him, uninvited but, by the way Draco unconsciously leaned toward him, not unwelcomed.
“So I’m second fiddle now, aren’t I?” Harry added, relaxing somewhat, despite the extreme violation of his privacy now set to occur. “I defied death for the Wizarding World, twice, and I’m in second place in Scorpius’s affections after
, Harry scoffed. How absurd that, five years after the war and a shared jilting to boot, Harry still couldn’t refer to the man by his first name. Well, fuck that.
“Ah, those kinds of dreams.” Draco shook his head. Because what did Harry need after surviving a war—given he’d literally died then came back to life, had his girlfriend cheat on him, witnessed the murders of friends and loved ones, and been abandoned by his two closest friends—but an identity crisis to top it all off?
“Please take him,” Mother begged Draco before he’d even had a chance to swipe the Floo powder off his robes.
“You did, didn’t you? You got all Slytherin and conspire-y and you turned a nice night of me drinking and forgetting my troubles into some Potter-themed plot.” Draco whined, over-pronouncing the ‘p’s. “But what I don’t understand is
He rolled off the bed and stumbled through his morning routine, wasting several fruitless minutes seeking a bottle of Hangover potion, only to realize he’d run out and failed to restock. With a curse, he soothed himself with the fact his meeting with Hermione was later in the morning, well past the point where he could expect to be recovered (though his mind shuddered at the thought of natural healing).
“I’d say ‘Don’t beat yourself up about it’ but I know you too well,” Treasure joked, earning a snort of laughter out of Harry. Treasure beamed at the reaction. “Waiting for Draco’s response, I stayed at home, suffering each day, unable to make a choice. But then, you wrote that op-ed condemning The Prophet, and I knew what I had to do. If Harry Potter approved of Draco Malfoy’s lifestyle, I could choose to be brave and strike out on my own. Luckily, shortly afterward Draco found my letter, Owled me back, and we connected. The rest is history, really.”
“Astoria has Scorpius today.” Draco sat back up in his chair. Raised an eyebrow. Dared them to continue their jeering.
“Jesus, Draco. Warn me next time,” Harry sputtered, lifting up the bottom of his shirt to use as a napkin for his spilled wine.
, young man! If my pins prick you, I’ll hear no complaints. How are you completely incapable of standing still? My word.”
“When I realized my sexuality isn’t as important as when I decided to come forward. It’s important to me that anyone who looks up to me understands their sexuality doesn’t define them, nor does it make them less than anyone else.”
Harry clears his throat, ignoring the topic to pass out pint glasses. “All right,” He cracks open two beer bottles. “We call this a Buttery Beard. Here,” He pours half a beer in each pint glass. Then, spelling his pint glass to float beside him, he fills the shot glasses half up with brown liquor, “Firewhiskey,” He explains, mostly for Draco’s benefit, since I have no idea what that is.
The hauteur revived Draco from his Potter-induced stupor, and he smirked, then spelled away Harry’s glamour.
“Stop with the martyr act, Draco. You’ve more than made up for your part. Plus,” She waved her copy of ‘The Wrong Sider’ in the air. “With this new perspective, I’m sure a lot of wizards and witches will begin to rethink their post-war prejudices.”
, he shook his head, narrowing his eyes at Harry.“Oh no you don’t. You had your chance to leave.” He extended his hand and pointed downward, the command clear.
“You don’t know that,” Draco raised his voice, bringing in a good finger point for emphasis. “You don’t know
Since I’ve never been able to exert control over individual eyebrows like Baz, I raise both. “How often
Since they visited on a school day, the trio had their run of the small village. Harry had forgone his invisibility cloak, which he’d admitted to Draco he normally wore on outings. He seemed twitchy out in the open, but the locals kept their distance.
, Draco thought as he flipped his tenth pancake of the morning. He knew he’d overdone it: cooking eggs, bacon, toast as normal, but adding hash browns, pancakes and strawberry compote to the mix.
Harry gave Draco an apologetic look. “Do you mind going on without me? I was hoping to catch Treasure.”
“You know,” Draco said, flicking his gaze down his book, feigning nonchalance. “It’s rude to Apparate into someone’s house without invitation.” He ventured a glance up at Harry, who stared back, aghast.
Smiling at Guillaume’s exasperated tone, Draco peeked to see what sort of customer was driving him mad today. And promptly lost his breath at the gorgeous, half-naked man on Guillaume’s stand. Dressed only in a pair of black pants, the tanned limbs flailed as Guillaume’s magical measuring tape wound its way around the man’s lean and muscular body. Draco’s eyes had barely taken in the sandy blonde hair when a familiar voice escaped the strange man’s mouth.
“Yes, of course, Potter,” Draco huffed. “How else am I ever to fill up the scrapbook I purchased for the sole purpose of documenting our probably insane venture into mutual like?”
But despite her support, he still didn’t know what he wanted in his career, or what to do about Scorpius.
She gave him a death glare, “Oh really? Because it looks like you had actual juicy gossip last night and, instead of sharing it, you let me whinge about my fucking botched manicure for nearly thirty minutes.”
"I didn’t even know they knew each other,” Malfoy said, eyes fixed vacantly at the back of the Wizarding Athens hotel bar.
Harry gave Draco the exasperated glare of someone who’d heard this question before. “Just because you don’t see the work, doesn’t mean it isn’t happening.”
Harry shrugged. “I’ll let you know if it gets too personal, and I promise to keep what you say between us, unless you’re planning to quit or something,” Harry joked.
Sorry for the delayed posting; haven't been in a writing mood lately. After a really rough week, I'm glad this next chapter is a heart-warming one; I enjoyed editing this one to post for the ending alone.
Draco glared at her, but her pleading gaze revealed no harm intended. He nodded, and said, “15 minutes.”
“Care of Magickal Creatures is another good option.” She looks at Simon, “I apologize in advance for Hagrid.”
Draco cleared his throat and extricated himself from the bed with the precision of a well-sharpened knife. He began gathering his clothes with haste, and Harry couldn’t stand it.
Draco’s son lit up from the inside out, and it absolutely did not pain Draco to see it. Scorpius’s emphatic nodding would have given Draco a migraine had he attempted it.
“Oh! Oh, yeah. I mean, I can get them surgically removed but it’s not easy. The wings have extra sockets or something? And the tail comes straight from my spine.”
Harry relaxed back in his chair, although his movement didn’t disturb Draco’s grip on Harry’s hand. Draco released it.
At each outing, he arrived late and left early. Alone. The photographic evidence of his attendance made him appear distant, out of focus. As if his face had been charmed to avoid the flash of a camera. Knowing Potter’s aversion to the spotlight and Hermione’s skill at charm work, he wouldn’t doubt if that’d been exactly their plan.
“Kreacher hopes tonight’s meal will be satisfactory to the Masters Malfoy. Kreacher was unable to discern Master Scorpius’s favorites on his own, so Kreacher created many options.”
Pansy faced Harry first. “You can absolutely bet that Blaise and I will recreate this scene tonight to a much more satisfying conclusion than the two of
Still, I don’t think twice before I follow Simon through the mirror (I’d follow him anywhere). I don’t know for certain, but somewhere between our bedroom and the swirling vortex that spits us out elsewhere, I suspect we’ve entered another dimension. One where magic can affect Snow, I realize far too late and with a sharp stab of my heart.
“Good grief,” Draco said, picking up the wine and taking a sip to ignore the warmth in his stomach at Harry’s gesture. “I don’t need your meddling sympathy, and if I did, I would have asked for it, you silly sod.”
“We’re not friends,” Draco said, his hand dangling naan like it’d forgotten how to make its way into his mouth.
“Someone at Gringotts will have a fun time lightening my vaults today,” Harry snarked, signing the transfer slip for payment, then shrinking his purchases pocket-sized.
“Well, I could hardly have taken you because—” He stopped, realizing he couldn’t admit why he didn’t invite Lavender.
She whispers an incantation that make my wings and tail reveal themselves. She holds my tail gently, bringing it up to her eyes. “It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. But the wings are almost like a Peruvian Vipertooth.”
Draco stood and wrapped his arms tightly around the sequins-clad body of his friend. “Treasure, it’s been too long.” He pulled back. “Now, spin. Let me have a look at you.”
Next chapter... we're going to have a POV free-for-all. Fingers crossed it doesn't get too confusing.
Blinking, “Harry I--” He reached out one hand, barely leaving the orbit of his body, but enough that Harry knew the emotional cost of the action.
Harry shrugged. “We could be,” The Saviour said, not having the decency to swallow his mouthful of curry before sending Draco’s hopes and heart soaring to the fucking ceiling.
Although, what a stupid question. Of course he feared failure. Who didn’t? Ok, maybe not idiotic Gryffindors. Draco wondered if Hermione had been afraid of taking on the Deputy Minister role. He suddenly wondered why he’d never asked.
But before Draco could form the words, Kreacher returned, bringing with him a full spread to lay on the kitchen table.
He looked so awful that when his mother arrived she’d told him she loved him, something she hadn’t said in years. Dazed with affection, Draco stepped into the fireplace, and only when he spun into the Ministry did it dawn on him that today was his turn in the rotation to pick up coffee for the department heads.
Reaching for the slice of chocolate cake he’d been ogling, Draco countered, “Well, that cryptic statement aside, because I sincerely doubt you’re going to share with me what work you’ve been doing, we’ve veered quite far off the original point.” Draco forked a bite of cake that didn’t include icing. “Although I think I’ve lost the thread. What were we talking about: my shocking lack of ambition, how mean it is to complain to orphans about trivial matters, whether we all should have taken a long holiday after Voldemort died, or what Harry Potter’s been working on for the last ten years?”
Draco winced. S.P.E.W. was Hermione’s first project when she’d been hired in as a staffer in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. While she’d been ultimately successful in helping advance house elf rights, she built a reputation as a troublemaker in the process.
Pansy scoffed. “Rubbish. It doesn’t have to reveal anything. It could just be a whim or a fantasy. No one’s promising anything.”
“I told you,” Harry whispered, nipping at Draco’s ear in a balanced mix of teeth and tongue. “Call me Harry.”
When Draco began spending time with Hermoine and Ron, he’d often thought how weird it was to see the Golden Trio without the Golden Boy.
The resulting beam across Harry’s face made Draco’s sudden lack of self-preservation worth it. “Really? That’d be fantastic! Can I invite Teddy? He’s a bit older, but it’d keep Scorpius occupied while we work, and they’re basically cousins.”
He couldn’t help but double down, placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder, then slowly dragging it over to the nape of his neck, adding a few massaging squeezes for emphasis. “See you tomorrow, Harry,” Draco added in a low tone, watching a flash of red spread up the back of Harry’s neck.
Draco wanted more time with Scorpius. Of course he did. But there was a growing part of him coming to realize that what he wanted most was a family. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to parent Scorpius, it’s that he didn’t want to parent Scorpius
about my time with Voldemort, Weasley.” Draco started to feel desperate with all of the defending he’d been doing lately. Explaining Draco’s poor choices felt just as tiring as it had thirteen years ago. More tiring, even, given he was now failing to convince people he
“I’m yours, if you want me,” Harry whispered, his thumbs gently rubbing the inside of Draco’s wrists.
“Oh,” Simon sits up straight. “Well that explains a bit. Though I have no idea what a deatheater is. Doesn’t sound pleasant.”
Potter gave Draco a curious look, and it dawned on him that Potter had not actually been privy to Draco’s internally monologued tale of potentially poisoning the three most famous wizards in Great Britain.
“Draco,” Pansy sounded breathless. “I don’t know… I can’t remember…” She took a large gulp of mimosa. “That story wasn’t in the book I read.”
They took pity on the girl, who seemed barely old enough to have graduated Hogwarts, and ordered drinks, white wine for Draco and a Firewhiskey cocktail for Harry.
Then, the house lights came on, and Treasure invited them for his break outside after slapping down a ‘Reserved’ sign on their table.
Letting Harry off the hook, the two of them turned to watch Scorpius play. The boy found the swing set, and he took to it instantly, swinging himself higher and higher into the air. Draco tried to ignore the rising guilt about how he’d never taken Scorpius to a park before now. He imagined a world where Draco hadn’t been crippled by his past or his fear of becoming his father. In the fantasy, Scorpius called out, ‘
Stopping at the door to Scorpius’s bedroom (now the guest room), Draco stared at the half-made bed. He imagined his son reading ‘The Wrong Sider’, kicking his legs as he ignored his father on their first day together.
Instead, Draco grabbed onto the one word that stuck out from his answer. “Technically?” He asked, one eyebrow raised.
Treasure shot him a look, “You really don’t know your own influence, do you?” He sighed. “At the time, I’d just come of age. I was debating about leaving home, which, all things considered, shouldn’t have been a challenging choice. But I was afraid. Having only been homeschooled, I didn’t know anyone outside our pure-blood contacts, and I thought none of them would approve. Then, The Prophet outed Draco, and I finally found someone who might relate.” Treasure gave Draco a fond look, which Draco returned with a brief hand squeeze.
Simon sighs, “Fine. Well, as Baz mentioned he pretty much hated me on sight. And, based on how he acted, it didn’t take me too long to hate him, too. In fifth year, I was convinced he was a…” He trails off, looks at Baz. “That’s not important. Basically, we hated each other until 8th year. Or, I thought we hated each other.”
Simon finishes first with a burp, Draco and Harry soon after. I finish last; I rarely drink, after all. But, whatever it is, it tastes like butterscotch ice cream. Despite my inability to chug, it tastes nice enough.
“Wait,” Harry repeated, drawing Draco’s full body into his arms. Nuzzling the silken blond strands with his nose, “Draco, I want to do something first.”
Whatever element of surprise we had is gone. I don’t have my magic. Wrapped up in Simon as I am, I’ve lost the edge my fangs give me. I haven’t felt this far out of my depth since America, and I don’t enjoy feeling that way again.
He planned to wait until the clock struck 10. Until he could reasonably assume at least one cup of coffee had passed his so-called best friend’s lips. He tapped his nails on the back cover of the book he’d finished a few hours earlier.
The inside of The Pub was dimly lit, much less vibrant than its exterior lights. On the wall hung different flags representing the myriad of gender and sexual identities, along with vulgar neon and aluminum signs. The audience theme was always ‘come as you are’ on Draq Queen Bingo nights, with some people dressed simply for comfort, and some dressed seeking company. Draco knew he and Harry fell somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. He wasn’t looking for any company other than the one at his side, and he hoped Harry felt the same.
the one who betrayed me. And what in the world are you doing hanging out with Harry Potter in the first place?”
With a sigh, Harry walks over to Draco’s bed. He curls back the sheets and coaxes Draco under them with a few murmured words. Draco nuzzles into the pillow, the harsh lines of his face relaxed. Like he’s once again in flight. Harry gently brushes a stray lock of blond behind Draco’s ear, then pulls the covers up around his neck. Tucks the sheets tightly around him.
“You seemed surprised to see me,” Harry said, arranging the nifflers into a pseudo-toga, staring into the mirrors. “Did you not get my messages?”
“Why don’t we—“ Astoria said to Narcissa, and the two of them exchanged looks before leaving the room.
Again, Draco marveled at the changes one week could inspire. He grabbed a waffle, some bacon, and eggs as well. The two ate in silence while Draco contemplated his next steps (while refraining from commenting about the devolution in Scorpius’s table manners).
Harry wanted to scoff, but it came out as a wet choke. He’d seen many good people die to those curses today, so they certainly did work.
“Why did you fight in this war, Malfoy? Why did you try to kill Dumbledore?” He choked out, because he had to know. Everything he’d thought he knew was uprighted onto his head like a crashing wave, and he was struggling to breach the surface.
A patch of sun had eased over his face, softening his sharp features and making his hair glow in the bright sunshine.
“You are the only one strong enough.” Malfoy breathed, and let Harry go. Harry turned, facing Malfoy. Malfoy just stared at him, mouth a grim line and eyes wide with determination.
He noticed then the gentle and limp curl of Draco’s long fingers. They were curled naturally, softly, splayed upwards into the air.
“No you wouldn’t, Potter! You wouldn’t because you are good and kind and righteous and brave. You wouldn’t have given in like a coward. You would have found another way.”
“Why...why you?” He asked. Why the youngest Malfoy? Surely there was people more loyal or more suitable. Why him?
Harry steeled himself, and leant forward again. He placed two fingers on Draco’s cold eyelids, and pulled them shut over Draco’s eyes. They mercifully closed under his fingertips, and he sat back, moving to stand before he could hesitate.
Malfoy noticed the hesitation, and he leant off the wall. The look in his eyes quickly disappeared, like a door shutting Harry out, and were replaced with hard, icy grey. His posture became aggressive and proud; projecting warning signals, with his fists held at his sides as he leant forward and his shoulders shifted back. Overall, it made him look bigger and more threatening.
Harry let out a deep breath. He had to tell them. He couldn’t keep it a secret forever, it would kill him inside.
Harry’s legs collapsed beneath him, hands sliding from Malfoy’s shoulders. He pressed his face against Malfoy’s knee, uncaring of how he looked or what Malfoy thought of him. Malfoy’s kneecap pressed into his forehead, and Harry tried desperately not to cry.
He had no more room for tears, chest dry and aching like he’d spent all day underwater, and had only just come up to breathe. His arms burned, their sharp complaints stabbing at his mind, making themselves known through the layers of exhaustion, grief and self hatred.
He struggled with the words. Did he thank her? For allowing her son to die? For continuing to protect Harry?
He blinked, realised he’d been staring down at Draco’s chest, at the place where his spell had no doubt hit the blonde. He wished there was a mark, a scorch, anything. Something to prove how he died, what he’d done.
“I had to. I needed for you guys to live through the war. I needed the war to end.” He whispered, wiping away the influx of tears with his sleeve.
He wished he hadn’t asked, because when Malfoy looked at him, he looked like a stranger. His eyes were dark and sad, deep soft pools of mercury with no fire or spite or any other emotion Harry recognised. His shoulders were curled forward, making himself appear smaller as his hands stayed firmly clasped in his lap. The bruise on his cheek was fully fleshed out, a dark smear against his pale skin. It was faintly red too, from where Harry slapped him. He felt a spike of guilt shoot through his chest. He swallowed heavily, attempting to ease the ache it left.
Harry pushed away from Malfoy, unable to process it. Every mother he had ever known would do everything for their children. His own mother had died for him as a baby.
Harry struggled to comprehend it. How Malfoy’s parents didn’t or couldn’t protect him. That’s what parents were for.
Harry realised then that the whole time, Malfoy had been trying to use his name, his real name. Harry had not even afforded him the same decency, hadn’t bothered to realise what Malfoy-Draco was trying to do. It just made him more upset.
Harry hoped that Voldemort would drop dead when he killed him. But he knew it wasn’t true, for the snake still lived. Only he and the snake were left, and he knew if given the opportunity; Neville would do his part.
“We were both dumb kids, Harry. I don’t hold any of it against you.” Malfoy smiled again, gently and kindly. It only made Harry more upset, because Malfoy had never been kind to him. Another side of Malfoy that Harry would never know.
He had to calm down. This was war. It wasn’t fair, never fair. It wouldn’t have mattered if Malfoy was sixteen or thirty.
He’d considered what he would do, in those cold nights in the forrest, if Voldemort tried to kill him with a killing curse. Whether he would retaliate with one. Whether he could kill somebody, even if it was the dark wizard that had destroying the world.
He didn’t want to look, but every time he tried to look away his eyes just found themselves back on Draco. On his pale skin, his dark suit, this thin wrists, his sharp nose. His hair looked so bright in the sun.
Possibly, it could have been his father. Lucuius Malfoy was a master manipulator, one of the reason Voldemort came to power so quickly in the ministry. Malfoy had always been his fathers son, always been the tool Lucius used to get to him or spy on him, but Harry discarded the idea. Lucius would never put Malfoy up to something like this. He was too prideful to make his son grovel to Harry, deception or otherwise.
Harry thought about the first day he learnt what the unforgivable curses were, in that horrible class with Crouch Jr. How he couldn’t fathom that anyone would use the warm gift of magic in such a cold and cruel way. He remembered watching the spider drop to splay awkwardly on the desk. Dead.
“I care, Potter!” Malfoy spat, suddenly, with more real emotion than he had been their entire encounter. “I care more than you know!”
He dug his nails into the palm of his hands, using the biting pain to keep him moving. To walk down the hill to where Hagrid’s hut sat innocently.
Draco was staring at the ceiling, eyes empty pools of grey, and for a second all Harry could see was his own mother.
Harry had never known a wand to die with its master, but it was clear that this one had known it would respond to another no longer. It had fought for Harry, but once it felt the residual magic of its deceased master...
He looked just as he did only a hour or so before, in his all black suit covered with dust and singed with ash, when they saved him from a death eater. Well, saved was a loose word for what happened. Harry stopped the death eater from attacking Malfoy, and Ron punched Malfoy in the face. Harry stared closer at Malfoy before him, and realised he could see the bruise darkening on Malfoy’s angular cheekbone.
He’d naively never thought Voldemort would never make another Horcrux, even as they destroyed the others. He never knew that the dark wizard could and would, given half the chance.
“Harry, just rest them over each other.” He heard, looking up at Hermione and Ron, who were watching him panic. “Just on his sternum, like in the muggle movies.” Hermione continued, voice warm.
Harry couldn’t fight this any more. Couldn’t muster a reason or an emotion to fight with. He let Malfoy grab his wrist, and hold it straight at his chest. To make sure he wouldn’t miss. Malfoy held his wrist a second longer than necessary, long enough for Harry to notice. He let go then, fingers lingering on the softness of his jumper.
“You have come here voluntarily to die, Malfoy. You came here without a wand, ready for this. Those are not the markings of a coward.”
He climbed off Malfoy suddenly, yanking the older boy off the floor to stand. Malfoy went easily, didn’t fight or push back as Harry dragged him across the room by his clothes and shoved him into the chair at the table. Malfoy sat without complaint, hands placed on his lap as he looked at the floor. Harry had never touched Malfoy without some sort of backlash, and now he was just quiet and complacent even as Harry just manhandled him into a chair.
He wondered if it was a sense of duty, self-hatred, or just pain old stubbornness. Likely a combination of the three.
“Why do you want to die, Malfoy?” He asked, and it seemed like the words snapped something within Malfoy. The blonde stopped struggling, stopped shouting, and just simply turned his head to the side. He laid there, limp and small under Harry. All the fight had left him, and the sudden change had Harry beyond confused.
Harry blinked, looking around. They were in a clearing, in the middle of the forest. He looked up, and the sun shone strongly through the edges of the trees. It wasn’t far from where he had died.
He wasn’t sure what he was crying for. Maybe it was the injustice of it all. Maybe it was that now Harry had to sacrifice his morals and kill Malfoy in cold blood.
Malloy’s expression was open and his shoulders were relaxed, but there was an intensity in his eyes that couldn’t be missed. Harry had expected fear or scorn, but there was nothing but determination.
And Harry realised how absurd that it was, that Malfoy was here with him and Voldemort didn’t know about it.
“All the Malfoy’s have ever known was sacrifice.” Malfoy whispered, like he was worried about being overheard. His hands gripped his knees in a white knuckled grip, still trembling. His mark was on show, striking on his white skin.
Harry frowned, abruptly realising Narcissa was trying to say something to him. Something the aurors shouldn’t know. The forrest was a dark place? Yes, clearly. Harry had died in the forest.
Harry thought about all the terrible things Malfoy had done, in this war and out of it. Suddenly dark and light didn’t seem so clear. Was any of it voluntary? Was Malfoy always a pawn, to his father and now Voldemort? Was his cruelty his own, or the front he placed to protect himself from further scrutiny into his intentions? Was he simply a projection of his fathers desires? A tool used to further the Malfoy’s, to complete some sort of twisted pure-blood duty?
Malfoy managed to open the heavy wooden door and duck inside just as Harry reached the door. Malfoy scrambled into the living room, turning to face Harry was he walked backwards. He knocked over the chair next to the table as he went, backing away hastily, breathing heavily, his hands raised in a pitiful defence as Harry advanced on him. The floor boards creaked under their sudden and shifting weight, and within no time at all, Malfoy’s back hit the wall with a dull thud.
“I...” Harry didn’t know what to say. He turned around to face them, Hermione and Ron standing on the stairs behind him.
“I am not a hero, and you are not a coward, Draco Malfoy.” He growled, and grabbed Malfoy by his clothes before he could run away again.
“What? Me, Harry?” He asked, voice trembling, that characteristic nervousness suddenly piercing though this weathered exterior. “Why me? I couldn’t-”
He must he been fidgeting, or showing some sign of the inner turmoil because Hermione grabbed his shoulder and led him into the side hall, where there was only an auror down the other end inspecting a body.
It looked the same as always, untouched by all the death around it. He focused on it, focused on the good energy coming from the place where he’d spent much of his childhood. He remembered his first visit, when he was so small and Hagrid looked so huge. He remembered the rock cakes and slugs. He remembered Ron’s childish laughter and Hermione’s scolding.
Harry snapped his heard up. Hermione was looking at him, much closer than he remembered her being. She had even placed a hand on his shoulder, no doubt shaking him.
Harry supposed it didn’t matter, as he arranged Draco laying flat. The worms would get to him quick enough.
It did not escape Harry how dreadfully ironic it was that instead he was the last person Draco ever saw.
He’d never sat with a body before. He’d seen plenty of them, but there was no time to mourn over them. They were a simple and devastating acknowledgement, before he moved onwards to fight the battle that he couldn’t escape from.
Something started beeping a moment later, and it stunned Harry into sitting up. He looked around with his wand held tightly, suddenly realising his vulnerable position mourning over a dead body. Only then did he realise it was only Draco’s watch on his limp wrist, beeping with an alarm. It made him feel horrible, because Draco had timed it; kept track of the hour, to make sure Harry killed him in time.
Silence suddenly fell, as they both stopped moving, nothing but the sound of their harsh breathing filling the space. The door shut heavily behind them as the moment settled, making the space darker than Harry would have liked. Malfoy’s hair was loose around his face, drawing his attention now as it glowed bright blonde in the dimness of the room.
Hermione and Ron kept digging across from him. Harry realised belatedly they could have commanded the shovels do it using their wands, but for some reason, they hadn’t.
Harry idly wondered if they'd ever been anything but children that were manipulated for adults gain.
“This war is because Voldemort couldn’t admit that he was wrong. He’s evil and power greedy, and he will do anything to prove he is the most powerful wizard alive.”
Harry scoffed at the thought whilst Malfoy hissed and hurled expletives at Harry from underneath him, bucking his body wildly to try and get Harry off him again. Malfoy hailed down punches on Harry wherever he could reach, and the punches hurt, but Harry remembered them hurting more as children. Harry did not make the same mistake as in the garden, and held firm even when Malfoy resorted to scratching his nails down Harry’s face, knocking his glasses to the floor. His face throbbed, and he couldn’t see Malfoy as clearly, but he didn’t ease off or lean away.
Their lives had never been theirs. Draco was born to a death eater father and expected to follow, and Harry was painted a hero for surviving a double murder. Both dragged into a war when they were barely able to crawl. Draco wasn’t a villain and Harry wasn’t a hero. This was not a story book, nothing was that simple.
Malfoy could ask probably ask somebody on Harry’s side of the war to kill him, and they would, no questions asked. Quickly, simply. And Malfoy could have achieved his goal.
“You need to kill the snake, Neville.” He whispered, remembering himself through the hollowness. Remembering that despite the betrayal, he still had a lot to lose in this war. He wanted them all to live through this. They had to.
“How? How did he do it?” He asked instead, because how could Malfoy be a Horcrux? Harry was a Horcrux by accident. Voldemort didn’t know he made Harry one.
“Please pass him to me.” He asked, and his voice sounded foreign even to his own ears. Ron and Hermione only nodded, moving towards Draco’s body. Harry couldn’t see them pick up the body, but they quickly came into view; Ron holding Draco under the arms and Hermione holding him by his legs. They kneeled next to the grave, and Harry felt some dirt trickle down from their movement. For a moment Harry vaguely wondered in he would get buried down here with Draco.
He didn’t want these realisations. He wanted this be easy. He knew how to fight with Malfoy, but that was all. He didn’t know how to understand him, he had given up on trying when they were eleven.
“Don’t be a git, Potter! Just get it over with!” He felt Malfoy grab at the back of his jumper. He whirled on the elder.
He almost wanted to laugh. It just didn’t feel real that Draco Malfoy sat before him, defenceless, asking to be killed.
Malfoy was just trying to keep his mother safe, this entire time. Of course that didn’t make him any less of an arsehole, but he didn’t deserve to die for being an idiot kid raised by racists that never taught him any better.
Harry was really doing this. He was really doing this. He was going to kill Malfoy and leave him here and nobody would know.
“He came to me, without a wand and tried to get me to kill him. We fought, I refused. But, he won in the end. He played on how much I wanted you guys to live through it.”
Malfoy’s shoulders straightened, hands loosening on his knees to instead rest gently against his thighs. Harry looked up at the change, and Malfoy had turned to face him, his mouth set in a determined line and he stared Harry down.
Harry was suddenly stunned by him, about what he was losing. About how different their lives could have been if Malfoy wasn’t born to a power hungry father and Harry didn’t lose his parents. He wondered if they would have met in first year, if Harry wouldn’t have rejected his handshake.
The other boy stopped moving immediately, breathing catching audibly in his throat as he pressed his back against the wall.
Malfoy was born into a life where he was expected to further his fathers aspirations. Forced to be the best in everything, to never compromise. To sit straight and dress proper and respect power. To be cunning and cruel. To obey.
Harry had thought himself a righteous person, detested what Voldemort did to others. Voldemort had hurt Draco so much, the manipulation, the dark mark, the Horcrux: and yet, it was Harry’s markings of violence and Harry’s dark magic that hurt him the most.
Malfoy was a coward. He feared death and pain as much as the rest of them, evident in the room of requirement and the death eater on the stairs. He didn’t want to die, had no reason to earlier.
He looked at the scene in front of him now, and was stunned about how much Draco looked like the spider. His limbs were thin and limp, spread around him like he was a children’s toy that was carelessly thrown aside.
He’d always been prepared to sacrifice himself for this war, but a small part of him thought he’d had a future outside of Voldemort’s reach. That he could live without Voldemort breathing down his neck. He knew now that the part of him that believed so, was naive.
Harry felt the small current of connection he felt with the wand fizzle out. He knew in that moment that even if he took it back, the wand would not respond to him anymore.
Once again, Voldemort had found a way to ruin his life. Or, realistically, Harry’s life was doomed to end at his hands from the beginning. He didn’t find another way to hurt him, simply finalising the process he already started. Part of himself had already been taken when he was just a baby, and he just had a few extra years to live his life before Voldemort took the rest.
He leant over Draco and turned off the alarm, tying desperately not to touch his cold skin. His fingers felt fat and useless as he felt around the small buttons on Draco’s frail wrist. He felt only a small second of relief when the beeping cut off. He leant back, and sat in the silence. He swallowed, closing his eyes and allowed himself another moment with Draco. He opened his eyes, wiped the tears from his eyes and moved to stand.
He didn’t have to wonder how much it had hurt her to realise she couldn’t save her son. Harry knew how it felt.
“Why me, Malfoy? Why do I have to kill you?” He replied, just as quiet, the anger was gone. Malfoy’s wand burned against the skin of his thigh.
At least Voldemort wouldn’t realise what he’d done until it was too late. Because by killing Harry, he was also dooming himself.
“I-“ Neville didn’t appear to know what to say. Harry leant back, easing himself to his feet and lifting the cloak back off his shoulders. Neville just watched with a broken look on his face. The hand he lifted automatically to stop him, dropped lifelessly to his lap.
“Did you do it?” Hermione whispered. He nodded once without looking away from Draco. The action made his neck and jaw ache, like it couldn’t bare to move. Or perhaps that was the tears he was desperately trying to swallow down.
“I do not deserve your sympathy.” Malfoy snapped, suddenly standing and yanking Harry to his feet. Malfoy grabbed for his wand, and Harry’s hand tightened on it instinctually.
He felt like a worthless pawn. He was the collateral damage that must be given up. He was the price to pay, one which they were happy to accept.
Ron stumbled slightly as they rose, unprepared for the dead weight of Draco’s legs. Harry didn’t falter, even if it felt like Draco’s dead weight was going to drag him down to hell.
Malfoy was telling the truth. Harry was so quick to assume anything different, because it was easy. Fighting with Malfoy was easy. Hating him was easy.
Hermione kneeled down next to the body, delicate fingers reaching to press against Draco’s neck. He draw them away a moment later, and Harry knew she had found no pulse. Draco had been dead for hours.
Harry just scoffed, bitter and disgusted that he almost fell for Malfoy’s trap. Malfoy was first and foremost a manipulator. He didn’t know what Malfoy was trying to do here, but Harry wasn’t going to fall for the broken and demure act anymore.
He held his wand straight and true, and took a deep steading breath. He felt the magic well up within him, and as he mustered the courage, he prayed that it would not hurt Draco. That it would be quick.
“Don’t pretend you liked him, Hermione.” Ron snarled, using his other hand to rip down the sleeve over Hermione’s arm, exposing the scar. “You remember what they did to you.”
He looked over his shoulder, black and blond hair mussed over her face and eyes bright with grief and fear.
To most it would be the same as killing the snake. It was something that had to be done. One wizard for a million. The choice would be easy.
Colin looked tiny in death, and it made sense, because he was barely sixteen. Harry tried to shut down the part of him that started to ache fiercely, shoving the hurt back down his throat into the pit of his stomach.
“Voldemort made another Horcrux.” He said, and watched as the knowledge swept over them. Ron seemed stunned, his eyes widening and he looked at Hermione in disbelief. Hermione was watching him carefully, her eyes a little unfocused in they way they always where when she was thinking quickly.
But could he trust his friends with it? They knew of the horcruxes, understood what they were. Yes, he could trust them. But, could he tell them what he did? Could he tell him of the horrible crime he committed to win the war? How he went again his morals and killed a defenceless wizard?
He stared at brokenness of the world that it displayed, and he vowed not to forget. No matter what awaited him now, he would be strong, and he would not shy away from his fate.
“Why have you been trying to fight death all day up until now?” Harry asked. “Why couldn’t you jump in front of one of the curses being thrown around if you need to die so bad?”
He climbed down into the hole, landing with a dull thump on the soft earth at the bottom. The edge of it came up just above his ears.
“Goodbye, Neville. Be brave.” Harry whispered, voice thick with tears, and pulled the cloak back over his face.
“How dare you pretend to care about us, Malfoy! I haven’t forgotten that you’re a traitor and a liar.” He hissed, spit flying as he remembered Malfoy’s plea’s to the death eater that morning. Malfoy leant forward in his chair to snap back, eyes bright with anger.
“Are you going?” Neville asked, still unmoving from the ground where he rested. His hand had fallen to rest heavily on his lap. He looked half dead.
Harry stopped, and felt everything at once. It was so quiet all around him, like there wasn’t a war in these walls. He realised he was now in a different hall, near the entrance to the grounds on the side of the castle. He was far away from Ginny and the girl, now.
Covering himself in his cloak, walking into the halls that were quiet with sacrifice and death, the air acidic with the lingering power of dark curses, cloying on the back of his tongue.
But, the anger inside him was gone. The moment to breathe and simply stare at the pureblood git had allowed it to dissipate. The bright force that made him push Malfoy and punch him and chase him was gone. He realised he couldn’t muster up a curse or a hex even if he wanted to, because the emotion that had taken hold had left as quickly as it came.
“We still have ten minutes. Why are you so eager to die, Malfoy?” He said, still holding his wand up at Malfoy’s chest.
But nobody cared any further than that. It was a entertaining thing to talk about, something fun to speculate about to pass the time through the long hours in the library or study hall.
Harry wiped the tears from his eyes under his glasses, and took a moment to watch Draco. He was so young, so beaten down by the world. He looked like a boy in a man’s clothes, the world on his shoulders and nobody protecting him from the cruelties of it all.
They started digging shovels into the dirt next to to the body, breaking the hard ground, digging through sticks and leaves to get down to the soft earth where they’d leave him.
She just just looked at him with dark eyes, heavy shadow under her eyes. Harry abruptly realised that Narcissa had indeed loved Draco. Really loved him, like Harry knew his own mother had loved him.
Harry wanted to protest, but he knew it was true. If he was lucky, his own body would be left alone and not paraded like a war prize. At least Malfoy’s body would be sheltered here in the hut away from searching eyes and the elements.
The quietness of the moment was destroyed by the distinct sound of a leaf being crunched under a foot. Harry whipped around, eyes searching as his hand reached for his wand, and felt his breath catch in his throat.
He smoothed the hair back against Draco’s cold forehead, and pushed himself to his feet with a burst in energy he struggled to feel. He moved around Draco looking down into the hole. He looked between Draco, the hole and his two best friends. He nodded.
He didn’t show it. He picked up the other chair that had been knocked over by Malfoy when they first entered the hut, righting it in front of the other chair. He walked across the room to pick up his wand and his glasses and sat down in front of Malfoy on the chair. He put his glasses on, and smoothed back his hair. He wiped blood away from the scratches on his face, and levelled Malfoy with an even look.
Harry absorbed everything Malfoy said. It made sense. Voldemort was always about killing powerful wizards and witches. That’s why he killed Dumbledore. It’s why he called an armistice to kill Harry when many ‘mudbloods’ were still in the castle.
“You didn’t have a choice. I would have done the same if my family was threatened.” Harry tried to be gentle, comforting. Malfoy just shook his head, backing away another step.
“Draco Malfoy had to die, Harry.” Harry stopped, stunned, and even Ron looked at her in surprise. Her expression softened.
He stayed like that, head down and feet marching onwards until it became monotonous. He focused on that singular action until he could see and feel nothing else.
Draco did not answer. Did not give any words of encouragement. He just laid there. Dead. Harry swallowed back the urge to vomit, feeling that ripped part of his soul decaying in his chest. He sobbed breathlessly, unable to care about anything else.
Harry let go of Malfoy, standing and moving away before he did something he regretted. He turned away, pushing his hands under his glasses so he could rub his eyes, staving away the exhaustion and rage.
“I’ll stay here until somebody finds me, I guess? I hadn’t really thought it through?” Malfoy shrugged, but stood still otherwise. “It doesn’t matter, anyway.”
Harry’s hands shook, his grip on his wand white-knuckled. His heart roared in his ears, and Malfoy just looked at him.
That only seemed to make Ron angry, as he ripped Hermione hand from his shirt and gripped it tightly. Harry flinched, watching them carefully.
He had promised himself that when it came down to it, he wouldn’t kill Voldemort. He’d weaken him, and leave him to rot in Azkaban for life, unable to come back once all the horcruxes were gone.
“I am tired of your sympathy. I know I am beyond that now. I’m tired of this war, Potter. I need this.”
He felt it ache, in chest. The part of his soul that ripped when he used that horrible, unforgivable curse. He knew it would ache for the rest of his life.
“We need to bury him.” Hermione said, standing to her feet. She beckoned Ron over, before coming and gently guiding Harry towards the body by his shoulders.
But then beautiful red hair caught his attention in the corner of his eyes, and he couldn’t help but stumble to an abrupt stop, legs shaking and head suddenly so very heavy.
He clung to the pain to distract him, to steady him. He didn’t look away from Malfoy’s eyes, and ground his teeth together. He took a deep breath.
“It’s not like anyone will know what I did today, Harry. Only my mother will, but they probably won’t listen to her long enough to tell.”
Harry wanted to snarl, to scream. Anger at Hermione for being kind when she hated Draco, anger at Ron was being so stoic, anger at Draco for everything he was, anger at the world for letting Harry kill him.
Draco was so ready for his death, but Harry couldn’t even muster the strength to walk to his, crying over the body of somebody he murdered in cold blood.
Harry remembered the harsh way Lucius held the back of Draco’s neck, that fateful day at the manor; the way Draco flinched when his father touched him, the way he avoided meeting his eyes.
The dark mark stood out against his white skin, the curled snake glinting cruelly against his inner forearm. Harry had never seen the mark so close.
Harry folded his arms over his chest in response to Malfoy’s sharper tone, a part of him glad for the normality.
When nothing Malfoy did got Harry off him, Malfoy started to fight like a wild animal; bucking without any direction whilst his threats and curses increased in pitch. Harry held firm.
“This war is not about bloodlines, Potter.” Malfoy started, still looking outside. The light was gentle on his sharp side profile, “It never has been.”
This war was no place for them, but they were taken by it just the same. The emotion was back, crawling up his throat and making his tears prick uncomfortably. He took another moment to calm himself, closing his eyes, taking a few deep breaths as he remembered Colin.
Harry lifted his wand again, and pointed it at Malfoy. His hand shook, but he steadied it. His grip was white-knuckled, and his muscles ached in protest from the days of fighting.
And in the next second he’d realised what he’d done. He stopped moving, stopped breathing. He kept his eyes closed as the quietness settled in the room. Only his own breathing could be heard.
Harry looked up at the sky. It really was the perfect day, barely any clouds and warm. The sun was so bright on his face warming his bruised skin and his aching bones; glossing over the pain like it wasn’t even there.
It seemed so bizarre. Harry had spent his first few years at Hogwarts terrified of Malfoy’s father. He’d always believed them to be a powerful and vindictive family. Harry wasn’t sure why he hadn’t seen it, maybe it was his own blind hate or suspicion. But the Malfoy’s were not powerful.
“By killing her son.” Malfoy affirmed. “It is with love that she sent me here. She knows you will not be cruel.”
“She has been protecting me and hiding me for this very moment, Potter.” Malfoy whispered, but his eyes didn’t leave Harry’s.
They looked different though now, strange enough to catch his attention away from the curse brewing in his chest, feeding on the tar in his throat. The look on Malfoy’s face and in his eyes was something he’d never seen, something he couldn’t put into words. He wasn’t looking down his nose at Harry like he usually did, eyes sharp and cruel. Instead, he was facing Harry straight on, shoulders squared but not arrogant, his eyes soft pools of mercury, filled with emotion Harry had never seen there.
The expectations must have been cloying. Harry had only known parents as protectors and overflowing with love. Ones that wanted only the best for him. Both his parents and the Wesley’s had proved that to him.
“That’s enough.” The auror to her right said, gruff. He lifted his wand, and began to lead her away by her wrists.
He had to mean it, had to want it. He didn’t, could never want this, but instead of thinking about Draco he thought about everyone that his sacrifice would save. Hermione. Ron. Ginny. Luna. Neville. George. Arthur. Molly. Charlie. Bill.
“He liked the stars.” She choked out, before she was grabbed and dragged down the hall, out of sight.
There was a jagged scar, like a blunt rusted knife had been lashed across the skin down to the bone. Without thinking, Harry’s hand reached out to touch it. Malfoy’s skin was warm, and the scar was angry and raised under his fingers.
“Well I’m sorry. Not just about this; but how I’ve treated you, what I’ve done to you.” He said, and me knew they were both thinking about the curse in the prefect bathroom, the way Harry left Malfoy bleeding out on the floor.
“Voldemort preyed on how close minded the pure bloods were. Used their ignorance as his power, using Mudbloods and muggles as scrape-goats to incite anger and loyalty. There’s nothing that unites a force more than othering.”
“Why me? Why you? Why must we play with each others lives like this? We are only eighteen!” He cried, pushing Malfoy away before turning his back again. “I’m so sick of this war!”
Harry nodded, before remembering Neville still couldn’t see him. Harry knelt down behind the half destroyed wall of stone and lifted the cloak to show his face.
The memory of Malfoy kneeling in front of him and lying to Bellatrix’s face crept into the forefront of Harry’s mind, but he shoved it away.
He was a Horcrux. And accidental one, but one nonetheless. A piece of Voldemort’s soul resided in him, and that piece needed to die. Harry was just the host that had to die with it. It wasn’t like his death had anything to do with him, or his worth.
The air was cool outside, the faintest tinge of frost in the air as the coolness of night fell away to the rising sun. The coolness was felt even under the cloak and his clothes, making a shiver run down his spine. The sun was just barely lightening the sky over the hill, the sky a dull mauve. Harry didn’t hesitate, and moved down the grassed hill that lead to the forbidden forrest. His sneakers slipped a little down the hill, the wet grass making his footing uneven.
It reminded Harry of that day in the prefect bathroom, how broken Malfoy had looked. How Harry had hurt him, badly.
Harry didn’t understand how he did it. How could Malfoy be so blasé about dying? Harry was terrified about the sacrifice he was about to make, but Malfoy was asking for it.
“You have no idea, Ron.” Hermione hissed, voice thick with tears. “You have no idea how I feel. I will never forget what his aunt did to me, hell, what Malfoy himself did to me; but he died for us. He gave more than most of the wizarding world for our cause.”
And just like everything else in Harry’s life, it was never going to be his choice. He had to die because he was a Horcrux, and now he’d have to kill Malfoy because he was one too.
“I am not using you as target practise, Malfoy. Don’t negate your sacrifice like that.” He snapped, and Malfoy just smiled.
“Malfoy...why is your family like this?” He asked. The Malfoy’s were beyond cruel to the point where they would consume their own for power. Where a mother would lead her son to his death so she could be safe.
He forced himself to take a step, and then another. He focused on each step, on the firmness of the dust covered stone underneath his runners. One after the other. He didn’t look around, couldn’t afford to absorb any more lest he waste time and let this all be for nothing.
“It’s okay, Harry.” Malfoy said, and Harry realised he’d closed his eyes. He opened them again to Malfoy’s bright eyes staring into his. He stood there, hands at his sides and facing him straight on.
If Voldemort had heard what Malfoy had just said, he’d be dead before he hit the ground. The dark wizard would never consider deception such as this. It would be too much like admitting defeat, to admit that there was a possibility of their side winning.
He turned, and Ron lent down, pulling him out of the grave by both hands until he could scramble up the side of the pit. He got to his feet, and looked down, seeing that dirt had fallen on Malfoy’s legs from Harry’s ungraceful clambering out of the grave.
“It’ll be easy, Harry. You’ve been preparing to kill Voldemort, I’ll be good practise if you decide to get a shot in before he kills you.”
Harry ran his fingers lightly through Draco’s wavy hair, perfectly soft and smooth under his fingers. Back and forth over his scalp, tufts of it catching between his fingers. He wondered if Draco had ever been touched like this. If he had ever known the kindness of a soft touch.
It didn’t excuse the horrible person he’d been to Harry and others; but instead of angry, it just made Harry sad.
“Thank you.” She said quietly, but it felt as though she’d screamed in his ears with how it felt like a wave hitting him in the side.
He wanted to yell that he could never. That he wasn’t like Malfoy, he couldn’t just kill somebody because he didn’t like them. Now that the anger was gone, he could see that. He couldn’t kill Malfoy. He saved the damn git twice already today, from the fire and the death eater. He couldn’t just kill him in cold blood, when Malfoy didn't even have a wand.
“We need to do something, now.” He whispered, and they immediately nodded, faces firm. They were used to doing things quickly, performing urgent tasks with no warning. The firmness of their faces stunned him a moment, because the war has changed them more than he realised.
And suddenly Harry was so angry. So angry that Draco bloody Malfoy was the last person he would see. Angry that he had to die today while people like Malfoy lived. And then he was just angry at himself for getting angry.
Without speaking, Ron took and step backwards and Harry took one forwards, Hermione moving to open the heavy wooden door and soon they were stepping out into the wonderful sunshine.
“You too Harry, come on.” Hermione prodded, and Harry kneeled next to Draco’s head, avoiding looking down at Draco’s face as he pushed his arms underneath Draco’s shoulders, wrapping under his arms and pressing against his chest.
He already knew what their fall from grace looked like on Draco, but it still left a bitter taste in Harry’s mouth to see it on his mother.
Now he had all the time in the world to stare at Draco Malfoy’ body. It wasn’t morbid curiosity, as much as he wished it was.
Harry tried to shut away the memory of the feeling of his fist against Draco’s skin. He knew if he lifted Draco’s jacket and shirt he’d find bruises there in the shape of his own hands. He’d been so unkind. He fell into Malfoy's trap, of making him angry enough to kill him. In a way Malfoy had been kinder than him, had tried to make it easier for him. Harry let his hate blind him, and he regretted it.
“What about....you know?” He asked, starting to panic and using anything he could as a distraction. He wondered what would happen to Malfoy’s body, or to his own.
“Screw you, Malfoy” he hissed, and it seemed to spark Malfoy’s temper again, for he took the chance to punch Harry across the face with surprising strength. Harry’s weight shifted from the hit as he raised a hand to cradle his face, giving Malfoy the opportunity to scramble out from under him to get to his feet.
He knew he would lose his resolve if Hermione started crying, or watch that horrible dead look take over Ron’s eyes. He couldn’t see them.
Harry turned away from the sky and bent down, pulling Draco’s wand gently out of his jeans. It felt loyal in his hand, and he knew it to be so. It had fought so valiantly for him against Voldemort, and he was thankful. But it didn’t belong to him, and it never would.
“You can’t. You can’t be.” Harry hissed, stepping forward and grabbing Malfoy’s shoulders. Malfoy’s thin bones pressed into his hands. Malfoy just looked up at him, eyes strong and accepting. There was no fear there.
He tried not to look at the forrest that stretched before him ominously, dark and beckoning. It was like the forrest knew it would claim another victim before the sun rose.
“Okay.” Was all he said, because it was all he could manage. He took his hand out of Draco’s hair, gingerly and carefully. Harry couldn’t bare to hurt Draco any more, even if he couldn’t feel it.
“You were sixteen, Malfoy. Why didn’t your parents stop him? Your father?” He gasped, trying desperately to breathe normally and think normally.
He turned around, walking quickly down the hall. He passed the auror with a small nod, avoiding looking at the body. His friends followed closely as they kept away from the main halls, from many people.
Colin’s body was right in the middle of the hall, just collapsed like the rocks around him. His eyes were closed, but it was no consolation.
He couldn’t waste time on anger. The temporary armistice would end soon, and Harry had be dead on the forrest floor before the hour was up. He needed to be if they were to have a chance to win this war.
“I laughed when Ginny Weasley and Hermione Granger got petrified.” Malfoy hissed, voice cruel and mean all of a sudden, The tone was familiar from Malfoy, and Harry immediately focused on it, in a sense of self preservation. He prepared for Malfoy to strike in some way. “I hurt Katie Bell. I have bullied you for seven years. Do it.”
Draco was laying on the floor, his body splayed awkwardly. His entire body was still, the frantic breathing and heartbeat Harry had felt against his hand earlier could not be seen or heard. His chest didn’t rise, nor did his hands tremble.
He expected the facade to drop, for Malfoy to draw back, stern and cold as Harry had always known him.
Harry flinched, but Hermione stepped over Draco’s arm and grabbed Ron by the shirt, yanking him down to face her eye to eye.
And that hurt. Harry tried not to let it show, but it did. Nobody cared about Malfoy. Nobody would come looking for him.
Now he had less than thirty minutes to come to terms with it himself and muster the courage to actually do it.
“I might if you don’t kill me now.” He hissed, a threat and a promise. “You need to do it, and you need to do it now.”
“Harry.” Hermione called, gently. Like he was a wild animal that they couldn’t predict the reaction of.
“No, they won’t.” Hermione agreed gently. “The kindest thing we can do is bury him where his mother wanted him.”
“Do not look at me like that, Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was firm, cutting through Harry’s thoughts. But, it was still softer than he was used to. There was no anger, no emotion. Just a quiet reprimand with no fire behind it.
He had to decide right then what path he was going to take. Was he going to leave Draco there, and never tell anyone what happened; or was he going to honour Narcissa’s wishes?
After all, the horcruxes had to be destroyed for them to win. It was a horrible truth, he now realised; but despite its depravity, it was still true. And Harry was a Horcrux.
He’d planned this, carefully. Harry realised Malfoy and his mother had risked much for him to be here.
Draco was bad, but then he was good. Harry would bury him in honour of his mother’s wishes, and as thanks for his sacrifice. Then, he’d put it all behind him.
The Malfoy’s were always the most outspoken pureblood elitists, from their mannerisms down to the icy blonde hair and grey eyed features they bred. After the negative connotation’s on pureblood following the war, the pure-bloods were sure to die out.
The magic left him, sharply and painful like it ripped part of his flesh away with it. He flinched away feebly at the horrible feeling, but it didn’t leave. He bent over trying to breathe through the stinging pain of casting a unforgivable, clutching where he felt his soul rip.
But, they would not have a future together. Not anymore. During the lonely nights in the forest, Harry often dreamed about red headed children with green eyes. He wished he’d known sooner that he was always going to be the sacrifice that won this war. He would have, perhaps, kept his distance. Tried to ease her into losing him.
Suddenly Harry was fed up. He’d had enough of making these horrible decisions. Of choosing between one horrible option and another equally horrible one. If Malfoy didn’t die, none of the deaths today would be worth it. Voldemort would win this war. But in order for them to have any hope, Harry had to get his hands dirty with Draco Malfoy’s blood.
“Because she’s about to help you win the war.” Malfoy hissed, voice a little quieter but nonetheless angry and upset.
And here he was, knowing in his heart that he would have to murder Draco Malfoy before he left Hagrid’s hut.
He had no energy, but he didn’t dare drop Draco. Ignored his arms complaints, even as they grew louder in his mind, throbbing constantly. He didn’t even let his muscles unlock, or ease for a moment.
Harry did not like the picture that was playing out in front of him. He did not like that Malfoy had given his mother back her wand and came here intending to...die by Harry’s hand without the ability to fight back. He did not like that Malfoy had planned this, and that his mother was willing to see this through.
Harry suddenly remembered what Snape’s memories had shown him. What it had taken to destroy the ring.
“Harry?” He heard, and spun to the quiet voice of Neville Longbottom. In his wallowing, he hadn’t noticed the blonde boy behind a section of partially collapsed wall. Neville was collapsed on the floor, leaning back against what remained of the wall. He held the sorting hat and his wand in either of his hands, but both laid weakly on the floor.
Draco smiled. “It’s a good one, but it’ll have to wait.” The stage lights came on, and Treasure mingled through the audience on his way to the front. “Shows about to start,” He winked at Harry.
Shit. He’d forgotten about the other days of the week. And like so many of the targets Granger-Weasley set in her sight, he folded. “I’ll be there.”
He also liked helping people, especially Hermione. There’s another contradiction with his Hogwarts self. She was his boss, sure, but she valued his input, and allowed him to shape the policies she enacted as well as the laws she supported. They were partners, and she always shared credit with Draco for his contributions. Not that he needed the credit, but receiving it reminded him that his work had meaning.
It wasn’t their best work, he had to admit, but thankfully the phrase ‘MOCK-UP’ was printed over the copy. “You’ve been holding out on me, Draco! ”
“I didn’t even know you were gay,” Harry said, trying and failing to fix his eyes anywhere but on the blond.
Draco took pity on him. “This tradition started after the war, Harry. It held us together when the world was dead set on tearing us apart. It’s like therapy. Or church. It’s.” He paused. “It’s sacred.”
Draco filled his glass with wine, then summoned a glass from the kitchen and filled that one up as well. Handing the glass over to Potter, he had a slight panic attack remembering that the wine could be drugged, and this might be the second time he’d accidentally poisoned one of the Golden Trio. Then, he remembered that he’d already given the wine to Hermione, and decided the symmetry of poisoning all three of the Trio greatly outweighed the potential negative consequences. Plus, he’d drunk the wine as well, which his slightly tipsy brain now thought was very funny. How in the world had he gotten this tipsy off one glass of wine?
Even Weasley seemed concerned at this statement, and opened his mouth to protest. Draco cut him off at the pass.
After gaping like a fish, Draco argued, “You can’t, Harry. They’ll eat you alive. They’ll accuse you of breaking every witch’s heart. They’ll accuse
It’s nowhere near what I need to be reassured, but the Headmistress has a look on her face that reminds me of Mrs Bunce. I know pushing this won’t get me anywhere with her. For now.
Rendered speechless, Draco stared at Hermione and tried not to drool, given the fact his jaw would likely not close for quite some time.
Draco gave the lovely owl head scritches. A gift for Scorpius’s 10th birthday from his mother, Snowy had always reminded Draco of Harry’s owl at Hogwarts. They were of the same breed, though Snowy wasn’t as pristinely white as Hedwig had been. Still, the similarity conjured a mix of concern for both Scorpius and Harry, creating a storm of anxiety which settled in his stomach, a feeling that promised to linger.
She raises one eyebrow. “As I understand it, they came through Mr Malfoy’s mirror, spelled by Mr Malfoy’s friend. How is it that you have undertaken the responsibility of their safety?”
Harry flushed, then stammered, “Er, well, that book isn’t strictly—I mean, from what I’ve heard it’s not 100% representative of… That is to say, if such a thing happened in a book it doesn’t necessarily mean it happened in real life.”
Not long after Harry left, Scorpius tugged on Draco’s arm. “Can we go home, now?” He asked in a quiet voice.
better. Still. Can’t help all those years I envied you for it. When I thought I wanted what you had. When I thought you did too.”
“Right!” Hermione added. “And how the light hits his eyes just so, turning them almost silver?” Then she went off on some tangent about the main character's flaxen hair while Draco tuned her out. Whatever discussion they were having, Draco knew it was hopeless to try and enter it. After years of experience, he knew that when Ron and Hermoine locked in on one another like this there was no chance for anyone else to join. Draco wondered if Potter had felt this way, or still felt that way—he knew Ron and Hermoine saw him often enough, even if the rest of the wizarding world rarely did.
“Harry,” She said. “You’ve done more than enough for my family. I doubt weekly tea’s are necessary,” She smiled. “However, you are welcome to call on me whenever the mood strikes.” Then, after a beat, “Privately, of course.”
“For your sake, let’s hope so,” Pansy said, her eyes darting over to Draco. “Draco, would you mind giving Potter and I a few minutes alone? I need to ask him a few questions.”
Again, Draco cursed himself for his part in Harry’s pain. He knew his own emotional withdrawal from their earlier conversation hardly made a drop in the bucket of Harry’s most traumatic experiences. Still, the fact Harry needed Draco, had asked for his comfort, had referred to him as
“In a twist worthy of a romance novel, the two jilted lovers were last seen ordering a 2,000 Galleon bottle of wine and retreating to Mr Malfoy’s honeymoon suite.
Draco extracted himself from the indent he’d made in Harry’s couch cushion, stretching as he rose. “It’s bedtime, Potter.”
Pansy smirked. “I’m freelance, so I can always sell my stories to The Quibbler or Witch Weekly.” She paused. “What I want to know is how you found out about the story. I can’t imagine
“Two, you said you could theoretically run your own department. Why is it theoretical? Do you think you’re not capable? Because, from how Hermione talks about you, it’s clear that you are. I’d hate to think the great Draco Malfoy held himself back in his career due to fear.”
Draco looked up and saw his mother and his son’s mother staring back with pride in their eyes. With a deep sigh, Draco released the part of himself he’d been holding at arm’s length, and relaxed into the embrace of his son.
Yes, despite Draco’s hatred of the book and subsequent avoidance, he knew that cover like he knew the grip of his wand.
They ran through the full list, Hermione’s small but satisfied smile filling Draco’s heart with pride.
Draco dropped his arms and fixed Harry with a stare worthy of his fifth year self. “Did I say you could talk, Potter?” He spat the name with as much venom he could muster.
Draco, poor soul, has an unflattering mustache that curls at the ends. Harry’s grown a rugged five o’clock scruff.
Like the little Slytherin she was starting to resemble, Hermione actually looked pleased, though she didn’t say a word. On the carpet in front of them, Hugo played on, completely oblivious to his mother’s transformation into an evil, evil woman.
“Oh.” Harry looked like Draco’s words had sucked the air completely out of his lungs. “I never thought of it like that.”
“It’s just…,” And he’s really on a roll, now, isn’t he? “I’m starting to wonder if Astoria’s been right all along and it terrifies me that I might have lost the chance to do this correctly. I thought I
“Sorry! So sorry,” He stammered. Bringing the last coffee to her desk, he looked down and realized he was wearing shoes from two different pairs. He sighed.
Draco whispered, “Well, I’m not sure if French cuisine appeals to a pre-teen, but my knowledge of Scorpius’s preferences is hardly robust.”
In an answer to a prayer Draco didn’t remember speaking, Scorpius joined his father at the table, taking the spare seat. Scorpius speared his scrambled eggs hesitantly, then paused.
Still, Draco knew Potter remained close to Hermoine and Ron. Having access to Hermione’s schedule permitted him that much knowledge. There were lunches and dinners, all mysteriously blacked out on her calendar. Hermoine didn’t keep secrets from Draco. Hadn’t for years. He even knew about the time Ron abandoned the Golden Trio during their search for Horcruxes.
“Oh, Potter, you almost make me regret I’m a married woman,” Pansy purred. “Except, by keeping your hair I can fuck you
Harry shrugged. “It makes sense. I mean, it didn’t at the time. But now it does. Being at Hogwarts during that time… well, you’d know, I guess.”
Draco couldn’t help the smile that took over his face, and he didn’t even stop to consider how Harry knew about their discussion (in fact, given the look of satisfaction on Harry’s face, Draco suspected Potter might have known about the job before Draco had). “Honestly? It couldn’t have gone better. I walked into that meeting completely unsure what I wanted, and Hermione offered me the job of my dreams.”
They adjourned to the back patio which was surprisingly uncrowded. Most of the audience had chosen to stay inside and use the break for drink refills, restroom breaks, and pickup lines.
“Just think,” Draco told Scorpius. “When you hit third year, you’ll be able to tell your classmates you’ve already been to Hogsmeade.”
“I kissed him in a forest after he tried to burn himself alive,” Simon adds. “What?” He says to Baz’s dropped jaw. “How would you explain it?”
Me, one month later: I think this story needs a little Ginny redemption. And some more Scorpius; there wasn't enough Scorpius in the other chapters.
Nodding, Scorpius pulled his father back in for another hug. “As long as you try, that’s all that matters.”
“Just what every man wants to hear on a Monday morning when he arrives at work,” Draco muttered around his mouthful of wavy brown hair.

Otherwise, it’s a bit like putting the cart before the horse, right?
