“Absolutely.”
“Then why aren’t you my emergency contact?” Draco demanded, the papers crumpling in his hands. “Why is everything so bloody difficult right now?” He looked down at the paperwork and his face grew dark. “Why does this paperwork say Draco Lucius Malfoy if I go by Draco Black?”
“Not sure.” Harry admitted, cancelling the diagnostic and walking to the head of the bed. “Lumos Languidus,” he murmured, and the tip of his wand began to glow with a weak light. Gently opening Draco’s eyes, he moved the light in front of them, watching as the pupils contracted and attempted to focus on the light. “He’s definitely waking up.” Harry confirmed, ending the spell and reaching for the chart.
“It looks like it’s covered in coffee.” He observed, swiping a finger over the damp grounds.
He may be emaciated, but he’s stronger than he’s given credit for.
“I… I don’t know what you mean,” Harry tried to say, but Malfoy nudged closer to him, brushing his own hardness against Harry’s, eliciting a gasp from the dark haired man.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry Potter, of course.” She nibbled at a scone she brought home. “He’s going through something right now, but I’m sure he’ll snap out of it soon enough.” With that, she changed the subject back to the cafe and allowed Draco to sink back into the depths of his mind.
Years ago, maybe he would have.
He steered me back to the bed - his bed - and all but pushed me into laying down. I tried to glare at him, but I really didn’t have the strength. How much blood had I actually lost?
“No,” Harry said quickly, “the Unspeakables creep me out, and I don’t want them crawling through Draco’s head.”
“He did.” Ron frowned at Blaise. “He lives for that shit, you should know that. He’s got a death wish, that one.”
“Three months is perfect, sir. Thank you.” Harry tapped his own wand to the parchment, and after registering his Magical Signature, the document rolled itself up and disappeared with a ‘pop’.
Ron became Head Auror and noticed that when his Aurors went on raids, the novice Curse Breakers were sent, even when the raid called for a Dark Arts Specialist. Draco was the only Dark Arts Specialist in the British Ministry, and he rarely got any field time. After some digging, Ron discovered that Draco was shunned and shuffled to the back, rarely allowed to leave his office and was more often than not stuck doing paperwork.
, really, Hermione…”
“It’s the SOCKS law, sir.” Holly interrupted. “If I do something that merits being let go, I would be given a sock. Just one, not a pair as if to wear.” Harry cast around in his mind, trying to remember what the SOCKS acronym stood for. The Head Elves had formed sometime after the war; it’s own branch in the Ministry. From what Harry could recall, the elves were tired of people trying to tell them what they could and couldn’t do, so they appealed. Hermione was more than happy to be an advocate, but she learned quickly that she was better off as someone in the background, allowing the elves to speak out for themselves.
“Oh…” Harry rose to his feet and placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “No, love. Not like that. Nothing like that.” He raised a hand and wiped the tears from Draco’s face. “Even before we started dating, when you had dates and such, you never… you were never explicit with them.”
Outloud, he said, “It’s not a hovel, and yes, your majesty, I have your damn Earl Grey.”
No really, he could.
“Could I have another piece, please?” The soft voice drifted into the kitchen, and Draco grinned, as he was already anticipating this answer and cutting another slice.
“Do you have a mirror? Or do you know how to do a Glamour?” Harry asked sheepishly, pausing before the front door. Draco turned to look at him, confused.
“I didn’t want to mess up your healing.” Harry gave into his feelings and hugged Draco. “I didn’t want you to focus on me and my feelings when it’s you who’s important at this moment in time. Your healing trumps any feelings I have.”
“You didn’t sleep with him after pub night, did you?” She accused, and Harry quickly shook his head.
I argued with anyone who would listen; Draco wasn’t a Death Eater, not truly. He never killed anyone. He was a child when he took the Mark. He was pressured by his father; his father who was currently sitting in a cell in Azkaban, awaiting the Dementor’s Kiss.
Draco was used to things happening. Bad things. Weird things. One time, someone didn’t properly hook the Cage up to the ceiling harness and both Cage and Draco had come crashing down - Draco managed to cast a silent, wandless cushioning charm without anyone noticing, and assured Carl he wouldn’t sue the club. Another time, a rabid fan of his had rushed the stage and nearly molested him - luckily, the bouncers caught her right away. She was banned from the club and, yet again, Carl was assured he wasn’t about to be sued.
“Ginny had a last minute practice she had to go to! It’ll just be Neville, Ron, and Hermione. And us, of course.” Luna indicated the three of them in the kitchen before grabbing her bag from the ground. “I really must be going, Draco, I just have to help set up a few more things. Think you can find something to do for the next thirty minutes?” Draco chuckled and threw his cleaning rag at her.
There would always be a next time.
The smile that Harry gave him was so brilliant that he wanted to make it into a Pensieve memory. “I trust you, Draco.” He motioned to the stairs. “Do you want to go and watch the telly? Or possibly discuss how we’re going to tell everyone tomorrow?”
Knowing that his face must be as red as a tomato, he was thankful that Malfoy was facing away from him. Taking a deep, steadying breath, he began to move with Malfoy. One step to the left, one step to the right, dipping his hips back and forth as he moved. His hands gripped Malfoy’s hips momentarily, and Malfoy leaned back into him, allowing Harry to rest his head on his shoulder. Malfoy’s hair smelled good and was so soft. He pressed his nose into the hair just behind Malfoy’s ear and inhaled deeply. Some sort of fruit? Whatever it was, it was divine.
This is it; finally the end! Thank you all for sticking with me; I had surgery and then I got super sick, but I'm back and I was finally able to finish this fic! It took me a little over a year, but I'm so please with how this turned out. I hope you like it!
There were more, absolutely, there were more. The first few I just strangled; it seemed to be the easiest. After a while, they caught on and began casting protective charms on their necks.
“Why would I want your weak ass coffee anyways?” Ethan spat before turning on his heel and storming out the front door. Draco listened to the tinkling bell die down before walking to the door and locking it. It was about ten minutes before the time he normally closed, but after a confrontation like that, there was no way he’d be able to deal with any more customers.
Then suddenly, icy grey eyes met bottle green and Draco’s world stopped for a split second.
Seeing Draco up and dressed in his immaculate clothing gave Harry pause as he peeked around the door frame. Draco was standing in front of the window, hands braced on the sill, staring longingly out at the enchanted mountains. As Harry watched, the mountains changed to a dark forest, then a Quidditch pitch, before it finally settled on a vast field of wildflowers.
“So you’re still enslaved then.” Harry frowned. “I thought the Ministry had passed a law stating…”
“Oh… actually, yes, thank you for reminding me.” Draco mentally kicked himself. He was still so fired up about the Ethan confrontation that he had nearly forgotten about his original task.
“No, but I’ve been there, done that, and I’m still learning. If I can give you the knowledge I have, then I will.” Draco leaned back and looked towards the door, which had opened with a happy jingle of bells. It was an older gentleman accompanied by his younger child, who was excitedly bouncing and chattering away about a croissant filled with something called Nutella. Making a mental note to look into this Nutella thing, he turned his gaze back to Harry, who had narrowed his eyes and was looking at him scrutinizingly.
“I’ll meet you there in a moment.” Harry repeated, and Draco nodded stiffly before walking to the fireplace and grabbing a pinch of Floo powder. Without looking back, he threw the powder into the fire and stepped through the green flames, leaving Blaise and Harry behind.
“One night isn’t going to change the outcome.” Hermione said. “Draco is in good hands, with you, anyways, and he hasn’t gotten any worse. We can continue this on the weekend. If you want to do your own research,” she waved her wand again and one of the large, ancient books flew into her outstretched hands, “You can take this home and study it.” Reaching through the fire, Harry grabbed the book and looked at its title -
And Potter noticed. When he tapped Draco’s shoulder and made the sign for ‘Deaf?’, he could have shouted his success from the rooftops.
“I haven’t even seen the house since I was… five?” Draco had to think. “As long as the House Elf heads aren’t on the walls, then you’ve done a great job.”
“No shit.” Harry muttered.
“It’s possible,” Hermione hedged, “It could be his magical core keeping him asleep so that he can heal any internal issues.”
“Mmhm,” Harry nodded his agreement, though his mind was a thousand miles away, thinking of other ways he could potentially jog Draco’s memory. If he remembered where the mint jelly was, maybe he’d be able to remember other things. If only he could come up with a solid plan to help him remember…
“Nonsense.” Luna appeared beside him and snatched the button away, swiftly pinning it to the middle of his apron. “There! It’s perfect.” She smiled serenely up at him as she grabbed a basket and began loading the scones into it. “Took me time to decide what kind of dragon to use, you know. But I came up with it…”
In my defense, I had just sharpened my new machete and I was being rather reckless - trying new things.
The whistling kettle brought Harry out of his reverie, and he quickly poured the hot water over the tea leaves and let it steep as Draco liked. A splash of milk and three sugars later, he levitated the steaming cup and went back upstairs to find that Draco had fallen asleep on his bed, curled around the same pillow he had thrown at Harry.
“I fucked up.” Harry choked out, and Hermione gave him a reprimanding look.
“Oh yes,” she answered dreamily, “I was making sure things were running smoothly in the back.”
That fateful Friday night, he dressed in the outfit Ginny had helped him pick out (nothing too fancy; simply a tight black v-neck shirt that showed off his muscles and a pair of tight dragonhide pants) and apparated a few streets down from the club. He could feel the music before he even saw his destination; the steady thrumming of bass seemed to pound through his feet as he curiously walked towards the source of the noise. He saw other people walking the same way he was; they nodded and smiled and he did the same back. It felt as though he knew them, even though there was practically no way he did - they were Muggles, after all.
“But he doesn’t remember…” Ron started, and Harry cut him off.
“Positive. You see this drawer?” Draco indicated the machine, and Harry, with a last suspicious look at Ethan, turned and nodded.
Once he had located not-Potter, he hurried to find Carl to discuss the set he had planned for the night. The stage was set and ready; all that needed to be considered was the music and color of the lights, which was quickly rectified.
“You confuse me.” Nose in the air, Draco looked around, grimacing at the dust he saw.
“Here you go.” Harry’s voice from behind him startled him, but he turned with a smile and took the drawer Harry was holding out. “It’s all clean and dry.” Draco opened his mouth to reply, but Harry had turned and strode back into the kitchen without waiting for a response. Frowning, Draco placed the drawer back into the machine, making sure it was situated properly before following Harry into the kitchen.
Harry smiled. “One month. Well,” he amended, “two months, technically, but you were in the coma for a full month, so we weren’t exactly… together.”
“Draco called me ‘Potter’,” he panted, “Draco was a right arsehole in school. Draco wouldn’t be friends with Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny…”
Draco shook his head fondly. “Because Luna doesn’t know the first thing about baking, even if it is just setting the ovens and placing trays in.” He waved Harry into the dark lobby, locking the door behind him. “I’d be worried about the whole place going up in flames.”
Taking a few deep breaths, he made his way into the backroom, where Harry was resolutely scrubbing the espresso drawer out.
As the night was finally winding down, Draco yawned and laid back against the pillows. “I don’t want to go back to the Manor,” he admitted to Harry quietly, the room so dark that Harry couldn’t see his expression. “Sure, mother is there, and I love her dearly, but I don’t feel comfortable in the place that he… that Voldemort claimed.”
“Sounds like I’ll be doing an awful lot of work!” He tucked a stray bit of hair behind his ear before settling back and taking a sip of his coffee. “When did this idea come to you, anyways?”
Someone has to do it - the Ministry is corrupt. They don’t do their jobs.
Luna had been the one to suggest the muggle cooking class, and Draco had agreed to it after laughing at the idea, thinking she was winding him up. She just stood there, looking at him placidly, before his laughter died down and he realized she was serious. “And we’re almost late, we need to go now!” She had tugged him, sputtering, into a side-along apparition that spit them out in the alley behind the college the class was held at. It was here that Draco discovered his love of baking (and Luna’s absolute ineptitude at it), and the rest was history. Luna would bring him different fruit from her garden room, and he would transform them into tarts and scones, muffins and puddings, and even jams and jellies. They did this once a week and indulged together - it was a special time, one where they got to unwind and not worry about anything else that was happening in the world around them.
“What do you mean?” Draco was confused. “We were just having a conversation about…”
“Get dressed, we open in an hour!” Luna called, “and don’t let the muffins burn!”
“Kind of obvious, wasn’t it?” Ginny snorted, “Harry coming out of your room, looking freshly shagged…”
Sorry this took some time! I definitely wanted to get a chapter out sooner than this, but it is what it is. We're almost at the end of the line! Thanks for sticking with me through this journey <3 I hope you like this chapter!
“She wanted to be sure she’d be ovulating at a certain time so we don’t end up with a certain zodiac sign.” Ron interrupted. “C’mon, he didn’t call to ask about our life, he wants help with his… which is weird, in and of itself.” He stared pointedly at Harry. “Usually he plays the martyr and does everything on his own.”
“I’m not going to force him into a relationship he doesn’t even remember.” Harry said through gritted teeth. “That’s not why I invited him home with me. He lived there before we were dating too. It’s still his home.”
“Cheer up, mate. We’ll get through this.” Ron rested his chin on his hand and thought for a moment. “You know, I could ask the Unspeakables if they know anything about these kinds of mind curses. I think they have a specific room where they learn about and test things like this…”
“So what happened afterwards?” Hermione pressed.
“Oh Harry.” Hermione shook her head and tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. “You have to be careful so the lines don’t get blurred. He’s still not mentally healthy enough to process these things!”
It would always come back to Potter.
“I’m not particularly hungry.” Harry said through gritted teeth. “I was planning on finishing up here and then going back to Grimmauld.”
“Stop touching my patient, Ron.” Waving him away, Harry conjured a stool and sat before Draco, who was eyeing him warily.
“Not enough.”
“So who’s going to tell us why we’re being subjected to Hogsmeade food instead of Draco’s fabulous cooking today?” Ginny smirked, stealing Harry’s juice and taking a drink.
“What’s that?” He asked, hopping up on a barstool and watching Draco eagerly. Draco raised an eyebrow and began to poke the bottom of the dough with a fork.
Ethan looked like he really wished the floor would swallow him up. “I just… look, I… I wanted to say I was…. Sorry.” He mumbled the last word, causing Draco to lean forward slightly.
“Bye, Harry!” Hermione called as he shut the floo connection, standing gracelessly and stretching out his sore muscles. He turned to the entrance of the sitting room, facing the sleep-rumpled Draco, who at least had the decency to look sheepish.
“Sir,” Neville hesitated, “We all have history with Malfoy, back from our Hogwarts days. Do you really think it’s the best idea to have Harry and Ron looking for him?”
“It truly is a goth club, at heart,” she had said, happily stringing some cupcake-shaped charms onto the bracelet she was making, “but they cater to all sorts. They even have BDSM nights sometimes!” Harry hadn’t been too keen on that; he was, after all, just trying something new for the time being.
Harry frowned, but sighed and waved his wand under the table, dispersing the Glamour. “It was uncomfortable,” he admitted to Luna, “But I just don’t want to be…”
Draco looked angelic when he slept. The hard lines faded, and the soft blond hair framed his face in an angelic way. He may have been a ‘pointy git’ like Ron called him, but these moments that only Harry was allowed to see made him fall even harder for Draco Black.
“Are you alright?” Harry watched Draco, desperately wishing he could hold him.
“Should we… Do you need us to prep the house at all?”
Laughing, Harry cupped Draco’s face in his hands and placed a gentle kiss on his lips. “You sure you don’t want me to tell you what my name is? It could jog your memory.”
“Fucking scones,” he grumbled, hurrying to turn the timer off and grabbing his oven gloves. “Don’t think you’re getting out of that kiss, Potter.” The scones were perfectly cooked, and Draco maneuvered the hot trays onto the cooling rack before placing the next round in to bake. As he turned around to reset the timer, he noticed Harry’s smirk. “What did you do?” He asked suspiciously, peering around him to look at the prep table. Two mugs were sitting there; one red, one green,  filled to within an inch of the brim with coffee.
, Harry, that was the whole point of this. Letting loose and finding people with similar interests.” She uncrossed her arms and placed them on her hips now, and Harry knew that whatever rule three was going to be would be a doozy.
“I’ve invited him loads of times,” Luna stated, “but he doesn’t ever come.”
“We live… here?” Draco was looking up at Number 12 Grimmauld Place, a sneer firmly in place. “Why didn’t we just Floo in?”
At least that was okay, Draco thought as he began to gather himself.
Harry didn’t answer.  “My body is different now.  I don’t need glasses either, and-” he lifted up his hand and Draco saw that three of his fingers had gone black at the tips again.  “It’s happening more.”
One morning he found himself in a small valley.  There was a little creek running through it, its water nearly silver in the misty light of dawn.  He walked around it, feeling the invisibility cloak slide through the damp moss at his feet.  The coolness of the air blowing through his overgrown hair was refreshing and he made up his mind to climb the hill and look beyond.
Suddenly he went over to the house elf bell and rang it.  An instant later Diri appeared, already in a bow.  “You – keep him alive-” he said pointing back at Harry.
And to my wonderful beta Billie who has been nothing but lovely and patient while dealing with my run on sentences and nonexistent knowledge of punctuation.
“The Healers don’t know much, according to this.” Ron flipped through the medical clipboard that was hooked to the foot of Draco’s bed. Hermione snatched the board from her husband and replaced it, glaring at him.
“I… I don’t want to get involved with Malfoy.” Harry stuttered, knowing that it wasn’t exactly true. “I just… it was a shock to see him, you know? And he did dance well. And he looked… good.” He finished lamely. Ginny reached out and grabbed his hands, making eye contact and smiling a sad smile.
“We’re only looking out for you, Harry.” Hermione pulled him into a crushing embrace, as Ron nodded behind her. “We don’t want to see you hurt.”
“Malfoy, sir?” Ron looked confused. “I didn’t realize he worked here.”
They weren’t spared a second glance as they stepped through the pub and out into Muggle London, and for that Draco was grateful. He just wanted to get home, to see Harry with his friends - their friends? - and then maybe, just maybe, he’d see a glimpse of the old Harry Potter he knew from school. Draco was well-aware that he, himself, was completely different from how he had been in school - he had been humbled by his probation and had done everything he could to become a better person - but he felt that his own change made sense. The quiet Harry Potter that was following him like a lost puppy, on the other hand… there had to be something to it.
“I don’t really dance.” That was the response Draco had been waiting for. Taking his last drink of water, he grabbed onto Potter’s
“How much cream  do you like?” Harry asked eagerly, holding up the pitcher he was holding. “And do you put sugar in yours? Or did you want to try the treacle syrup? I already put some in mine.” Draco watched in amusement as Harry put a splash of milk in the red mug.
I find that rather odd.”
“Pretty hot, huh?” The female bartender who had served him earlier said happily, cleaning out a glass as she leaned towards Harry. “He’s been coming here for a few months; caught the owner’s eye right away. He was always dancing alone, but something about him was just mesmerizing, to everyone.”
“Usually custard,” Harry finally said, “but I like whipped cream too.”
Did Malfoy… want him?
“Two months.” Harry crossed his arms and glared.
“Don’t bring Ron into this!” Harry shouted. “It’s not his fault that the minister refuses to see that Draco’s the best Curse Breaker in Britain. In fact, Ron has been his biggest advocate, so don’t you dare blame Ron for any sort of shortcomings!”
One morning Draco woke up to find Harry sitting cross legged in bed, his hand stretched out in front of him.  It was black – from the fingertips to the wrist – black like it was covered in charcoal, black like it had been burned to ashes.  Slowly, Draco sat up.  He knew what he had to do – mainly summon the Dittany – but he didn’t know if he should say something.  Did Harry understand what this meant?
“Very well, you may go.”
For a moment there was no pain, and he calmly watched the blood spill down, black in the darkness of the night.  But it only lasted a moment and the next he had fallen to his knees, his right hand automatically clutching at the wound, white panic flashing through his mind.  The slipperiness of the blood over his fingers, and the haziness that took over his thoughts made him drop the knife into the tub, mingling it with Harry’s rotting flesh, and the deep brown liquid that had once been pure mandrake juice.
He appeared right between two old Elm trees, not far from the place where the Grounds Keeper’s cabin had once stood.  He could see the outline of the school perfectly against the grey morning sky.  Towers and windows and walls, all restored.  Of course, Hogwarts was not a school anymore, it was only a castle, and served as Voldemort’s personal residence.
It was all incomprehensible to him.
He reached his hand inside the tub and touched the back of Harry’s hand with his dirty fingers just to reassure himself.  It felt like skin.  Like normal human skin.  Harry made no move to shift away from him, he stayed where he was, watching him with that one green eye.
It was here that he really began thinking about what he wanted, what he was trying to achieve.  The vague ideas that had made him leave his parent’s house were at last solidifying, and he saw for the first time his real intent in finding Cepheus’s grave.  He knew now that it had very little to do with the legacy of the Blacks and much more to do with Harry.  With the desperate and strong desire swelling inside of him to speak, to see him again.  To have a new start.  To do things properly
Draco sat up.  “A spell book?”
She had done everything in her power to keep Potter alive. She had brought him all the obscure ingredients he needed.  She had even gone so far as to modify Lucius’s memory, not once, but many, many times.  And this, of course, had muddled him, confused all his senses.
“It was a good idea to come out.”
Shaking, he got his feet.  He stood over the tub, his wand securely in his hand.  A breeze of cold air went through him, fluttering the ends of his hair, and he took a deep breath.  He needed all of his strength for this, and all of his love.  He needed all of his devotion, and all of his power.  This was the single most important spell he would ever cast in his life.
It was just a matter of turning his head just slightly, and his lips would brush against Malfoy’s, and he would finally know what it felt like.
He took the stairs two at a time, almost tripping at the bottom, before stumbling into the brightly lit kitchen. Draco was there, two steaming cups of tea sitting on the counter. He stared at Draco awkwardly, mouth opening and closing as he tried to figure out what to say.
The kettle whistled, and Harry hurried to remove it from the burner, but it was too late. The tell-tale noises of an angry, hungover Draco began to float down the stairs.
Draco paused and glared at the ground, fresh tears running down his cheeks. “I’m… I’m not really like that, am I?” He questioned. “I’m not the… the slag Blaise was making me out to be?”
“That’s enough!” Neville squeaked, the tips of his ears going bright red. “I don’t think any of us want the details…”
“Honestly, ever since we got here, I’ve been thinking about the cafe.” He admitted, glancing at the bakery cabinet that showed all of the different croissants the little shop sold. “And that child was talking about Nutella, which I’ve never heard of, so I was making a mental note to look it up and see what it was about. Maybe we should start selling actual food at the cafe, I’m not sure.”
“Yup,” Harry said warily, “Have for two years.”
And there it was, a hard presence pressing into Draco’s arse.
“You.” His voice sounded like a child’s now, the fight he had been giving the bed all but abandoned. He stood frozen and trembling, arms curling around himself in a protective stance. “You’re not the real Draco Malfoy.” If Draco had been expecting anything, that was not it. He knew about nightmares and had them himself; plenty of nights he woke up gasping, thinking he was still in the Manor and Voldemort was still a few rooms away. He assumed Harry would be having similar nightmares, but saying that Draco wasn’t real? What in the world…
Clearing his throat, Harry looked at Draco with pleading eyes. “That’ll be all, Kreacher. Off… off you go.” Kreacher bowed, first to Harry, and then deeper to Draco, before limping out of the kitchen, muttering to himself about ‘proper heirs’.
The morning started off normal enough: Draco arrived at the cafe around 5:30am and began the process of getting everything into place. He turned all of the ovens on and waited for them to preheat as he took the previously made scones out of the blast freezer and arranged them on their respective baking sheets. He learned that they baked more evenly when he only had 6 scones to a tray. It may take a little longer, but the reward was definitely worth it. Baking without magic was one of the most rewarding things, Draco had discovered, and he had taken to it like a hippogriff to the air.
“To be fair,” Ron finally spoke, “He has been here all day, every day since Draco was cursed. He probably deserves a break.” Hermione nodded in agreement and sat down in Blaise’s abandoned chair.
“I think you already know what it’s going to be, Harry, and you’re not going to like it very much. Rule three - don’t even think about getting involved with Malfoy while wearing a Glamour.”
“Where the fuck are you, you menace?” Harry looked under the couch and the armoire, but it was like the ferret had disappeared. Standing still, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, willing himself to calm down and think like a ferret. He heard a slight rustling, along with the ripping of paper. “What the…” he opened his eyes and glanced at the coffee table, where the ferret was busy ripping up the latest issue of Wizards of the Pitch, his new favorite Quidditch magazine. “You wanker, I haven’t even read that one yet!” His cheeks flushed as he saw some of the ripped and scratched up pictures: Beaters and Chasers topless and winking suggestively. He hoped that Malfoy’s ferret brain couldn’t put two and two together.
“I don't know, alright?” Draco exploded, “I don’t know him, I don’t know his wife, I don’t know me, but for whatever reason, I remember your stupid face and that I call you by your stupid surname. Is that what you want to hear?” Tears were shining in his eyes, but he was too proud to let them fall.
“Birthday drinks!” Luna to the rescue, as usual. She pulled a tray of purple drinks emitting clouds of fog from the fridge and handed them out. Draco took his gratefully, sniffing at the smoking liquid. It smelled of elderberry syrup and definitely had Luna’s signature all over it. “To Draco, may he have a wonderful 24th year!” Luna raised her glass, and everyone else followed suit.
“Harry! You came!” Luna came hurdling out of the backroom and rushed to give the surprised man a hug. “I really hoped you would!” Harry encircled his arms around his friend, patting her back awkwardly as he tried not to make eye contact with Draco.
“That sounds fine.” Draco flicked off the lights as he and Harry left the kitchen, grabbing their wands on the way out. “I’m guessing we’re going to skip the movie tonight?”
He leaned against the counter and took a deep breath. Almost closing time, and he was so ready to go home and spend time with his friends. It was becoming easier to call them friends in his mind. Grinning to himself, he set about getting the back room in order and ready for Monday, minus the scone batter. He’d come in on Sunday to make it. Maybe he’d even have that new recipe to try on the customers…
“You were comfortable with my body.” Draco set his teacup down and clenched his fists by his sides. “You were holding me almost the entire night, and the way you grabbed my hair…” He grabbed his teacup and threw it into the sink, the cup shattering. “I’m not a fool, Papaya. I know what this morning was, and what it could have been.” He brandished a piece of parchment Harry’s way. “I got an owl from Blaise this morning. I’m going to his place. Don’t wait up.” His shoulder bumped Harry’s, making him stumble as he watched Draco march to the Floo.
Cursing internally, Draco reached back and grabbed at Potter’s hands, bringing them to his own waist. “Here, maybe it’ll be easier if you feel
“No one will be able to tell who you are now.” Draco slid his wand into his sleeve, willing his shaking hands to be still. This was a mystery he needed to solve, but not today. Today was his birthday, and he was about to celebrate with his friends… and Potter, of all people. “Shall we?” Harry nodded and followed Draco out of the cafe, pausing as Draco performed the locking spells on the door. He shoved his hands deep into his hoodie pockets and followed a step behind as they made their way to the Leaky Cauldron.
After a time, the music began to fade again and Malfoy’s dancing slowed to a stop. He glistened with sweat; a few songs ago, he had taken off the fishnet top and tossed it into the sea of bodies. His chest heaved as he caught his breath, smiling down at the crowd, his eyes grey and piercing. He appeared to be looking for someone or something, and Harry melted away, slowly backing towards the bar.
“But you did,” Hermione spoke quietly, casting a quiet Scourgify on the tables as she danced out of the way of Ron’s broom, “You made it, you fed them all, and you’re still here. How do you feel?”
“Blaise called you that,” Harry shot his own words back at him, unable to keep the attitude from his voice.
those Chocoballs he was eyeing, and what was he waiting for?
(See the end of the chapter for
“I… I don’t really dance,” he admitted, “I’m not very good.”
“Beans?” Harry blanched, “I didn’t think there were beans in treacle tart.”
I knew how the Aurors operated when they found a body. Check for Magical Signatures, check for the trace of magic in the air.
Draco followed him down the hall and stepped into the room Harry indicated. Harry’s room wasn’t messy, but it didn’t exude elegance like Draco’s did. It definitely looked lived in. Harry’s bed sheets were a brilliant gold, and the sun shining through the window made it look as though they were glowing.
Returning to the front of the cafe, he carefully wiped out the crevasses of the machine and brushed the dried grounds away from the mechanical parts. This specific espresso machine was his favorite, and he was glad he noticed that something was wrong before it got out of hand.
“They’ll show up in Healer Douglas’s office in a mo’. Do you have everything?” Harry glanced around the room, noticing for the first time that Draco didn’t really have anything of his own in the room, minus the clothing he was now wearing.
After the scones were finished, it didn’t appear that he was any more inclined to speak; instead, he began cleaning his station with a look of determination on his face, as though he was doing everything he could to get out of the cafe as soon as possible.
Allowing himself a few moments to calm down, he took a deep breath and reached for the Floo Powder. Kneeling in front of the fire, he tossed a pinch in and called out “Granger Grotto!” before sticking his head in the flames.
Draco stood up.  He had always been curious about Harry’s life before, but he didn’t know if it was intrusive to ask.  “Did you like them?”
Hours later they lay facing each other on his bed, their knees bent and just touching.
Obligingly, Harry did so.  He had half a plate of food and then moved on to the tea. Draco managed to finish his fruit, but the toast was beyond him.  When they had both finished, he vanished all the mess, not wanting the smell to continue in the room.  “How are you feeling?”
“Of course!” she said, a pliant smile on her face.  “Would you like me to speak to him about this matter? Or would you prefer to do it yourself?”
Abruptly he rose from the bed and walked over to the window.  From here he could look down at the extensive Malfoy gardens.  They had, of course, seen better times.  His father had had little time to care for things as he usually would.  The place was overgrown, and not the luscious green he remembered.  Everything was a little dry, a little dead.  He wondered where the peacocks had gone, he hadn’t seen them for weeks.  Perhaps they had made a valiant escape right under the nose of the Death Eaters, like Potter had.
“Infatuated-” the word rang through the room.  “How very interesting.  To do so much for only such a petty reward.”
“I do,” said Harry quietly.
“Yes.”  He wanted to tell her that things were going very well, that he had succeeded, but he found that having the book meant very little to him if he did not have the power to get Harry back.
“Of course, Young Master,” she said with another low bow.
The second time had been in sixth year, when he had snuck into Draco’s compartment.  Draco had caught a glimpse of those filthy old trainers of his and then, when everybody left, he had cursed him.  He remembered taking the cloak off of his body, staring down at his stiff, petrified face, and those green eyes full of anger.  He had smashed Harry’s face, and thrown the cloak over him, hoping to have him sent off to London again, hoping to get him in trouble.
At other times, Mandrake juice might not be so hard to find.  There were the Hogwarts’s green houses for one.  And then there was also the fact that he had a vault full of gold at his disposal - an vast fortune hoarded by generations.  He could have gone to Diagon Alley or Knockturn Alley and found exactly what he needed.
It was a difficult thought to come to terms with.  Draco felt like he was poking at a bruise, a sore spot, a great festering wound.  But the fact that it was the truth could not be denied.  The moment Harry Potter had left this world, every goal and wish and aspiration Draco had previous harbored had left too.  What was the meaning of any of it if Harry wasn’t here? If they were not going to compete anymore, to bicker, to fight.  If he was not going to get revenge for the scars Harry had left on his body.
“If father died would you bring him back?”
“It wasn’t so bad-” Draco said without really thinking about it.  That day seemed like ages ago and whatever he had felt then, whatever fear and panic and pain, had faded.  He didn’t want Harry to carry any guilt over it.
“He found a corpse where his wife should have been.”
The events of that day were crystallized in his memory, but at the same time they felt distant from himself.  As if he had been a different person then..  He remembered the Room of Requirement well, and Harry saving him, flying him out of the inferno.  He remembered his own arms around the boy’s waist, and his head pressed hard against his shoulder, too scared to cry, too scared to speak.
“Draco?” he whispered.
“Let him go! Let him go!” Draco screamed, thrashing against them as they were dragged down the hallway.
The person below – that person whom he loved so much, whom he would do anything for – was really no longer a person.  He had reverted back to a corpse, withdrawn from his physical body. And although there was no way to speak to him, Draco knew that Harry was away, that he had entered his dreams again.  That he was imagining that quiet, empty world of death.
Harry gave another laugh.  “I like your shitty aim.”
Up above, immobile, his eyes watering from having remained unblinking for so long, Draco felt some finality in that gesture.  As if that eye was the symbol of Harry’s humanity, or Harry’s continued existence in the world of the living.  And now it was gone, stabbed and taken, and the thing below (whether it was breathing or not) was really not a person at all.
“My Lord.  Of course, that is what I call you,” his voice trembled, the tone rising and falling unnaturally.  “I am your devoted servant.”
“Are you okay?”
They bickered back and forth.  He was surprised by how animated Harry sounded, how much more like his old self.  This was the kind of day that made him think that the longer Harry was here, the more human he was going to become.
“Can you get up?” he asked, crouching by his side and automatically wiping the blood away with his wand.
“I will have my meals sent up from now on-” he commanded her.  “Bring some of everything, and tea and coffee, too.”
During his childhood, Malfoy Manor had been a place of comfort and opulence.  Now everything in it was tainted.  It was here that they had been prisoners, and it was here that they had been punished.  The three of them returned to the house after the battle together, grateful for a moment of peace, and grateful for a narrow victory.  But it was not the place of old.  The opulence had wilted, the comfort vanished.
Harry nodded his head. “You?”
“Well, thanks to your work Draco lacks no connections, does he?”
“If I had the power to? Then yes, of course, I have no desire to exist without him.”
“I don’t feel anything,” Harry answered, which was not very comforting.
And underneath this passage was a single line.  When Cepheus had set it down his hand had shaken, the letters were also uneven on the page, they slanted downward.  It read:
He felt Voldemort move across the room, his long grey robes swishing over the floor.  “Bring him to his feet,” he ordered, and Draco watched as they raised Harry.  There were two people behind him, pinning his arms down, and another had a hand on his neck, forcing him to look straight up at the Dark Lord.  “What do you say, Potter?”
This time he woke up gently.  He knew exactly where he was, and as he came to, he nuzzled closer to Harry, putting his forehead against the other boy’s shoulder.  It was so wonderful to rest like this.  For months he had been living off minimal sleep, he had been so focused on his goal.  Now, laying in bed with him felt so luxurious.
“Nothing to say?’
What had he been thinking? How had he let this happen?
And she knew better than to ask.
After a moment he sat down on a boulder to better take in the view.  He wondered if this was the kind of place where Harry had hidden.  Wondered if he had also been travelling, moving from place to place, in the wild.  He looked over at the spot beside him and really tried to picture him.  Small and skinny, his hair always a mess, his glasses overlarge, and behind them his eyes bright green.
He shut his eyes.  This was not a decision to be taken lightly.  This was not a moment to be impulsive.  He could hear the storm outside, and in his mind, he imagined the rain and the thunder as they rolled above him.  His clothes were still soaked and heavy – not that he felt them.  And his fingers were numb with cold as he fiddled with his wand.
She poked the tip of his nose.  “I think you could do anything you wanted; you have greatness in your blood.”
It was startling just how little he had thought of them… and, by contrast, how much he still thought of Harry.
“You didn’t eat.”
The crash was nasty, his limbs turning every which way, his ankle giving an unpleasant crack and then bending, making him fall to the floor on his side.
Harry made a small sound.
“Which do you remember best?”
For a moment they held eye contact and silently Draco begged him, begged him to end it all.
Lucius was quiet, but the frown lines had disappeared from his forehead, and Draco was sure he was already won over.  “It would ultimately be the Dark Lord’s decision.”
“And I can’t have him knowing anything about this,” Draco retorted, gesturing towards Harry.
“Wonderful. Harry, stay with him, would you please? He really should start heading home in thirty and I don’t trust that he won’t try to stretch out the time he’s here. Ta!” and with that, Luna disappeared through the back and left Harry and Draco alone in the kitchen.
“That would probably be a good idea.” He smiled and grabbed Harry’s hand, allowing himself to be pulled up the stairs. He felt a lightness in his chest that he hadn’t felt in years, and recognized it for what it was - hope. Grinning, he sat next to Harry on the overstuffed couch in the sunlit sitting room, watching Harry talk animatedly about their mutual friends and how to best tell them.
Maybe eating before Flooing wasn’t the best idea, Harry thought to himself as he tumbled out of the fireplace and into a large, high-ceilinged anti-room. His stomach turned and he took a moment to breathe before straightening up and looking around. He knew Blaise lived in a Manor that nearly rivaled Malfoy Manor, but he hadn’t been expecting to Floo into a completely unoccupied room.
“Oh, alright.” Throwing her hands up, Hermione sighed. “Bring the damn thing. But if he antagonizes Crookshanks, or, I don’t know, digs up my plants…”
“I’d like you to come.” Draco declared, turning around and crossing his arms across his chest. He decided to try to play off of their old back and forth from school, to try to get a rise out of him. “If you’re comfortable being around a Death Eater, that is.” Harry furrowed his brow and looked down, scuffing his shoe against a non-existent mark on the floor.
It was an unfortunate truth in his life. He had the worst luck. Voldemort living in his home, leaving behind dark, tainted magic that seeped into the walls of the Manor, making it nearly unlivable. His parents both passing away within a year of each other - his father in Azkaban, his mother in the Manor of a supposed broken heart. And of course, arguably the worst luck, was Harry Potter snuffing him at eleven and then the subsequent years of their unbridled rivalry.
I left, and kept myself out of the public eye, for the most part. Sure, catch me coming out of the Leaky or the Hogshead; normal night for the Saviour of the Wizarding World, right? Drinking away his fortune, keeping his disgraced head down.
He loved listening to their lives: Ginny’s Quidditch training with her team, Neville’s work with the Aurors and as a fill-in Herbology professor at Hogwarts, Ron’s Auror training and Hermione’s slow ascent into Magical Law Enforcement. Every now and then they’d mention someone else he knew from school - Hannah Abbott becoming a healer at St. Mungos, Ernie Macmillan securing a place as the Assistant Director for the Daily Prophet, even Pansy Parkinson’s name came up as they discussed her new line of clothing and fashion. Draco drank these stories in, happy for his old school mates for doing everything that Draco found he couldn’t.
Harry stumbled backwards, collapsing onto the couch, his hands gripping his hair. That couldn’t have gone worse, and now Draco had run off thanks to Harry.
“Potter… Harry, can you breathe with me? Let’s do something together now, okay?” Harry’s breaths were coming faster and faster, and Draco had to think quickly. “Harry, listen. What are five things you can see?” His eyes remained shut tight. “Harry, please,” Draco lowered his voice, “open your eyes. What are five things you can see?” Harry cracked his eyes open, finally, and Draco breathed a sigh of relief. “Come on, Harry. Five things you can see?”
He chuckled, and Draco had to physically restrain himself from being sick.
His body was exhausted, and he wanted to sleep, to drift away, to go somewhere he didn’t have to consider what life without Potter would really be like.  In practicality nothing would change of course, they had been enemies after all, but in every other way his world would be different now.
“For the Dark Lord,” Draco answered automatically.
He could just imagine the look of disappointment on Lucius’s face if he had been sorted into Hufflepuff, or if he hadn’t made the Quidditch team, or if he had brought some boy over to meet the family instead of Pansy.  His father would have been irate.  He would have disowned him.  So, surely, that was not love.  Even Narcissa, who he knew would do anything in the world for him, had her limits and if the time came for her to choose between him and Lucius, he was not certain that he would be her first choice.  She was dedicated to the old order of things, and despite the fact that she ruled him and manipulated him every chance she got, she still thought her main job in life was to service her husband.
Weeks passed by.  Happy weeks.  Victorious weeks.  Every dream his parents had ever had was coming true.  The Dark Lord had positioned himself at the center of Wizarding England.  The blood traitors and the mudbloods had lost everything.  Dozens had been arrested, dozens killed, and others simply vanished, either fleeing to the remote regions of the globe, or taken in secret midnight raids.  The world was theirs and they were doing with it what they pleased.
His dreams were nasty.  They involved bloodshed, and inferi, and Voldemort’s horrific red eyes staring at him from the inside of a sarcophagus.  He sat bolt upright as he woke, staring in confusion at the room around him.  He was relieved to see Harry, still in bed next to him, curled up like a cat, his head resting on his own arm.
He intended to finish the bottle, and with it to sink into some peaceful slumber.  Instead, after merely half he promptly fell asleep.  Curled up at the foot of the opened sarcophagus, like a small white cat at the foot of his master’s bed.
“He was at dinner yesterday,” she pointed out.
The Dark Lord quickly grew bored and called this act “silliness,” so they all stopped, and Harry’s head (or what remained of it) fell to the ground.
With a groan, Harry remembered the plans to attend Ron and Hermione’s house warming dinner - which had been firmly pushed out of his mind. “I suppose, Hermione. Do you mind if I bring Snowball? Ow!” The ferret bit him again. “Okay, Snowball isn’t sticking. I’ll come up with something else.” He assured the ferret.
“It’s always… been you.”
He didn’t want Malfoy to know just how much he enjoyed the performance.
Someone cleared their throat, causing Harry to jump and turn. There before him was a well-dressed House Elf, holding a tray of what appeared to be sparkling water. “Master Blaise is in the drawing room.” She squeaked, blinking slowly up at Harry. “You may follow me, if you so choose.” The elf turned and began to walk away, and Harry pushed himself away from the mantle and hurried after her.
As the day wore on, and the customers became fewer and fewer, Harry ventured out behind the counter, watching as Draco made the various drinks. He was a bit startled by the frother, which caused the milk to ‘scream like a mandrake’ as he so astutely put it, but he listened with keen ears as Draco told him and showed him that he could tell the temperature just by listening to the milk. He even allowed Harry to try, though on his first attempt, he lifted the frother without turning it off first, causing a milk explosion all over the counter. Apologizing profusely as Draco laughed, neither of them heard the door’s bell chime, and they were both started when a quiet voice spoke from the register.
“First time!” He replied in the same way, shouting slightly to be heard over the music. “Can I please have whatever you think is good?” The bartender withdrew and gave him a wide smile and a nod, whirling away to grab some bottles. She layered grenadine, crushed ice, lemonade, and blue curacao, popping a festive umbrella into the drink and pouring a singular shot of what looked like a citrus vodka before turning back to Harry with a smile, setting the drinks down in front of him.
Childhood nemesis.
Harry ignored him, focusing his energy on Blaise. “You have no right to touch him.” He took a step forward. “No right to touch him, or speak to him that way. As his Healer…”
At 7am on the dot, Luna reappeared to flip the sign from ‘Closed’ to ‘Open’, and Draco’s day really got started. If he thought that the weekdays had been busy, then he was extremely shocked with how many people showed up on a Saturday. He supposed he should have known; most people were at work on the weekdays while they were open, and since this was the first official Saturday, there were a bunch of new faces to cater to.
Harry waved his wand and cast a silent diagnostic, verifying that Draco was fit to return home. His head still came back a deep red, but that was normal with amnesiac patients. Besides some muscle weakness from the supine position he was in while he was under, Draco was cleared for discharge.
Harry waited until he heard the door close before rising unsteadily to his feet. He hurt. He knew it was best to keep their relationship platonic at this point, especially since it would feel like he was taking advantage of Draco if he made any sort of move on him. That didn’t make it any less painful to watch him walk away without a goodnight hug and kiss.
“Been following me since sixth year, Potter?” Draco teased. “Even your house elf seems to be enamoured with me.”
to feel that hard body above him.
“I can wait until the machine is back up.” Ethan practically purred. “In the meantime… where were we?”
Harry nodded, hope alive in his chest. “C’mon, Draco,” he held out a hand, “Let’s go home.”
“Well that one makes no sense, I’ve been asleep haven’t I? I can’t taste anything beside my own mouth… which is disgusting, by the way.” A laugh bubbled out of Draco, relief flooding his body.
If anyone knew what to do, it would be Hermione.
“...and I hope you’ll be coming to Draco’s flat for the party!” Harry choked on his bite of scone as Luna hopped off the counter and looked at him expectantly.
The saucy little minx.
I'm happy everyone seems to be enjoying this so far! This chapter didn't turn out how I thought it would at the end, but I guess my subconscious was just telling me to lay out a little more groundwork before anything else. <3
“Well… yeah, we knew that, mate,” Ron said, “But the question remains… why at The Ecstatic Croissant instead of Draco’s?” He lowered his voice conspiratorially. “The bacon here is too thin, and the eggs are always a bit overcooked. You must have noticed that the food isn’t fresh?”
The ferret paid him no mind, ripping and tearing at the magazine until he had a few pieces lined up neatly. He jumped off the coffee table and ambled over to Harry, clawing his way up his trouser leg and shirt to perch back on his shoulder. A nudge and a bite to Harry’s ear made him yelp, but the ferret stared at the line of torn paper deliberately. Harry sighed, but, getting the ferret’s meaning, he leaned over to look at the lined up paper. They were all words, lined up to form…
He just wanted to see Malfoy again.
“Weasley and his wife.” Draco said, a little too quickly. “Red hair, that’s obvious.”
Some people were on my side.
“For someone who likes it so much, I’m surprised you didn’t recognize the ingredients for treacle tart.” Draco felt a rush of pride as Harry’s eyes grew wide. “Reach behind you and grab me the beans, would you?”
Harry took a steadying breath. He knew that Draco was lashing out because he was scared, but didn’t want to admit it. He always hid his emotions, and had only recently begun to open up to Harry and sometimes Ron. The regression hit Harry like a brick wall. “Do you know who was just in the room with us?” He tried to switch the subject.
“What was that? Didn’t quite catch it.”
“He’s not so bad when you tell him exactly what to do. Plus, he’s helped Luna with the gardens, so he likes to hang around and make sure the plants are well-tended to.” Twisting the timer on the stove, he turned back to Harry. “It’ll be done in about 30 minutes. Do you like it with custard, whipped cream, ice cream, or clotted cream?” He walked to the sink and turned the water on, beginning to wash the dirty dishes. Harry hopped down from his chair and grabbed a nearby towel, holding his hand out for the clean dishes. They stood together in relative silence as Draco washed and Harry dried.
“So… Poison isn’t it, either,” he said weakly, and Harry shook his head. Draco sighed in defeat. “I’ll get it one of these attempts.”
“Well.” Harry was fiddling with the edge of his shirt. “This is it. It’s not much, and there’s still a lot of work to do, but… it’s mine. I live here.” He said it almost defiantly, daring Draco to say something back. Draco took a few steps of his own, following his nose down the stairs and into a rather open kitchen area. There, a wizened old house elf was bustling around, pulling a steaming hot pan of treacle tart from the oven.
muscular bicep - damn, being an Auror did him all the favors, didn’t it - and pulled him into the middle of the throbbing bodies on the dance floor. He saw Potter look back at Alyce, probably hoping she’d rescue him, but Alyce had always been on Draco’s side. She simply placed a cover over Potter’s unfinished drink and gave him a thumbs up.
“His healing is more important than a relationship.” Harry responded, trying to reel his magic back in. “You should understand that, as his emergency contact.”
“The jig is up, Potter,” he sighed dramatically, “they know all about our sordid love affair. Far be it from us to ruin their imagery of us tussling around in the sheets...”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Not that it’s any of your business, but while I’m not dating at the moment, I am most definitely interested in someone, and that someone isn’t you. Do you want your coffee?”
Maybe he was dead wrong.
“I’m Dragon, but you knew that.” He grinned. Harry took the offered hand and shook, momentarily struck mute.
“I am well aware, Weasley,” Blaise drawled, marking his place in the book and closing it. “I’ve been here since day one. Who knew that being a Curse Breaker was so dangerous?”
Head over to my
“That is a violation! You don’t touch his chart! Only Harry and the other Healers can do that.” Her voice softened. “Do we know
I'm super lucky to have these awesome people on my side <3
“As far as I can figure, Peanut.” With a groan he sank onto the bed, gripping his head in his hands. “That’s not right either!” he practically yelled, “Why the fuck can’t I remember your name?” He looked up at Harry, and the tears that had threatened to fall earlier were making their angry way down his face. “You’re obviously important, or I would remember someone other than you. Why is it
“One more, Harry.” Draco sat down on the bed and held out a hand. Harry ignored it and sat stiffly next to him. “Just one more thing you see.”
“Harry hasn’t left his flat in weeks.” Hermione’s worried tone was obvious. “I invited him to the opening but he said he was busy.”
Harry nodded slowly. “I’ll get some time off work so you won’t be home alone.”
Harry was still in the midst of training for his Healer’s license, and had stopped attending the weekly pub nights. He was working long hours, taking over shifts, anything he could to prove himself as his own person, not just Harry Potter: The Boy Who Lived.
“Maybe!” Alyce shrugged noncommittally. “I did give him one of your flyers and he couldn’t tear his eyes away…”
“Draco wait! At least let me explain…” Harry turned, reaching a hand out as though to grab Draco, but he was already in front of the fireplace.
“No, Blaise, I don’t know why he’s acting the way he is. I don’t know why you’re acting the way you are, either. If you didn’t remember, I have amnesia.” Draco sniped, arms crossed and glaring into the fire.
“It should,” Harry said, “It’s the old Black residence.”
“With all due respect, sir, the Head Elves passed the law. A wizard may not own us as the older generation used to be owned, sir.” Holly shook her head. “I am provided with living quarters, clothes to wear and change into, and wages, if I so choose to accept them. My master treats me very well, and I am a devoted caretaker to the home and family.”
“Harry, mate, wake up!” Ron shouted, slapping a hand across his back, “This is a momentous occasion! Draco Lucius Malfoy is no more!” He threw a hand across his forehead dramatically. “No, my friend, the blond git you see before you is none other than Draco Black; no middle name because who needs them?!” Draco was beaming with such an un-Malfoy like expression that Harry went along with whatever they were playing at. He settled Ron on his couch, and offered Draco the spare bedroom to sleep the liquor off.
“I doubt it’ll come as any surprise to any of them, but yes, let’s make it official tomorrow.” Giving him another soft peck, Draco detangled himself from Harry and set about carrying their empty stew bowls to the sink. “After you left, everyone was giving me shit about you spending the night.” Harry laughed, coming to rest his chin on Draco’s shoulder, watching him rinse out the bowls. “Let me see,” Draco pretended to think hard. “Ron and Hermione were appalled that we shared a bed. Who knows what they get up to on their own time, but Merlin forbid anyone else to do anything slightly scandalous. Ginny was happy that I was, ahem, ‘getting some action.’” He felt Harry tense behind him, but continued on. “Neville, always the mediator, said he was sure that there was a reasonable explanation, and Luna - lovely, loony, Luna - told me that the Wrackspurts had all but disappeared from you.”
to feel the burning pressure of Potter’s cock sliding into him…
“Well, now you’re taking ten steps back, starting over from Draco Lucius Malfoy, Royal Prat with Daddy Issues.” Ron laughed, vanishing his coffee spit with a wave of his wand. “Think he’ll go back to being Draco Black without a struggle?”
The Aurors rounded up the rest of the Death Eaters. I was in on that, when I was bright-eyed and ready to do what I could to rid the world of the last of the vermin.
Draco shivered and moved away from Blaise. “I am trying to have a conversation!” He hissed. “And you keep doing… whatever it is you’re doing. It’s like you don’t respect me.”
Harry did as he was supposed to - he went into Auror training a year after he defeated Voldemort. Skipping his eighth year had been a gamble that he, Ron, and Neville all decided to take, and with great success - the three of them had graduated from Auror training with top marks. Harry and Ron immediately began field work, while Neville preferred the paperwork aspect of things. Now, seven years later, the three of them made a pretty solid team, if Harry did say so himself.
” He began to slowly gyrate his hips, willing Potter not to bolt. He could feel the other man’s discomfort, but hopefully the liquid courage he had been drinking before would kick in soon. Alyce’s drinks were very strong.
“You have
With a wave of his hand, he wandlessly banished his mess and hauled himself to his feet, slipping his pajama bottoms and pants off as he made his way into the bathroom. He took a quick shower, only soaping himself enough to wash yesterday’s sweat off, and resolutely ignored the interested twitch his cock made as he gave it a cursory wash.
“In the living room. No wands in the kitchen refers to all kitchens, all wands. Why?” Draco raised an eyebrow. “Where’s yours?”
The article Rita ran through The Prophet when I quit was supposed to dethrone me - but it did exactly what I wanted it to - it helped me to become a relatively normal celebrity.
Screaming. There were shuffling noises coming from his bedroom, and all of a sudden, memories of last night came back. He had taken Harry to his bed when he had too much to drink and let him sleep there, and now it sounded like he was trying to defend himself against something.
Harry wanted to ask, so badly, but Ron beat him to it. “What form does he take?” Ron demanded, arms crossed. “That’s an important piece of information. How do we know if we’re looking for a man, or a dog, deer, cat, or…”
“And then?” The words were spoken in the softest of whispers and he was brought back to all those nights he had spent as a child in her arms, falling asleep to that same tone of voice.  “Will you come home to us then?”
It was only in 5th year that the story came back to him.  He was on Prefect duty, walking down the long trophy room when something caught his attention.  It was an old plaque, the metal dingy, the inscription hard to make out, but it bore the familiar Black family crest.  Draco tapped it with his wand to get the dinge off.  It was an award for Highest Standard of Magical Excellence, and it was made out to Cepheus Draconis Black 1490.
They walked slowly through the hedges.
“When did you make this?”
Greyback ravaged him, tearing clothes and skin, leaving his body raw and bleeding, with huge gashes from shoulder to hip.  And then Uncle Rodulphus had hacked off an arm with a cursed knife.  And not to be outperformed, his brother Rabastan had severed his head.  What followed was a makeshift game of Quidditch, played above the battle ground, with different Death Eater’s throwing Harry’s head at each other and hitting it back with a beater’s bats.
“Soon. I’ll see you soon, Harry,” he said to the darkness of the chamber, before letting sleep take him.
“I saw.”
Draco’s eyes burned. “Get out of here. Leave.”
He started talking more.  Telling Draco all sorts of things that he had never imagined about the boy before.  About his cupboard, and his fear of dogs, about his first train ride to Hogwarts, and the picture album of his parents that Hagrid had given him at the end of first year.  Colour seemed to drain back into him and, with it, want.  He had been so passive the first few days, like a lost child.  But now he was making decisions and choices for himself.  There were things he didn’t want anymore, and things he wanted more of.
Before bed they would have another meal, this one by candlelight.
Draco lay a hand on his shoulder, leaning in to kiss his cheek.  “It’s gonna be okay,” he whispered.
It had started with showing Harry a book Draco had loved as a little boy.  Harry had taken an interest in the doodles in the margins of some of the pages, which included a caricature of Fudge and a dancing teacup.  This was an old habit of Draco’s that he had never managed to break.  Slowly, they began going through all his books and journals, looking for more little drawings.  Many were Quidditch themed and there was one in particular that they both stopped and stared at for a long time.  It was two figures facing each other on broomsticks.  It had few details, the black ink figures merely silhouettes, and neither player had a face, but just from the hair it was easy to see who Draco was thinking about.
He considered for a moment and then nodded. “Come at dawn.” Tomorrow would be significantly easier if she were here to guide him through it.  He gave no more details, and said nothing else as Narcissa turned and slipped out of the clearing, quiet as a shadow.
with his son for a long time – years, in fact.
Without a struggle, both boys, malnourished and sick, were pulled from the room. Draco kicking and screaming like a child, Harry limp as a dead body, his one green eye staring at the ceiling.
He never managed to fall asleep again that night.  Harry slumbered quietly, curled up on his bed and Draco watched him, seated on the window.  Nothing like this could happen again.  He was not gonna let Harry die.
“Merlin’s beard-” said Lucius.  “Your destiny is here, everything is laid out for you to grab, you just have to reach out and take it.  And you want to run off into the mountains after an old spell book!”
And all of his sentences started with if…
The Dark Lord scoffed.  “Mothers are very troublesome creatures, are they not, Potter?”
, there are worse things than death.” He laughed, and again the Death Eaters joined him.  “Why should I give you what you want, Draco? Why should I offer you the one thing that would give you peace of mind?
Instead he began rearranging Harry’s remains so that they were at least roughly in the right place.  The mandrake juice had turned a deeper shade of brown, and he tried not to notice what the fluids were doing to the corpse itself.  It looked like all the flesh was turning to muck.
“Nor should you, it’s an old magical family.”
He walked the entire day, not eating, not resting.  He traced his wand over every surface he could reach, and it seemed with every step his certainty only grew. He knew now that this was no false lead, no fertility rock, no abandoned fortress.  He was moving towards his destiny.
Draco did not know what to say.  He had never planned for this contingency.  What was he supposed to do? Get on his knees and beg? Explain? Die standing firm with his chest squared, like Harry had?  “My- my- Lord-”  those were the first words which came out.
He walked the circumference of the grave, trying to summon anything that might have been left behind.  A shrunk brown thing zoomed up that he thought might have once been an ear.  When he heard the tiny sound it made against the revolting mixture in the tub his stomach flipped.  That was all of Harry.  Every bit that he had been able to salvage.  That was everything that still existed of him, but would it be enough?
He turned his back on Harry, wondering if he also wanted a little privacy.  A few moments later he heard splashing and felt the weight of another person in the water.  Draco looked back at him over his shoulder.  His wet hair was flat for once and his hands were full of bubbles.  “I used to take baths like this all the time when I came home from school,” said Draco, consciously trying to fill the silence.
“The one about his wife.”
“I know you are no Gryffindor, Draco, but really I think it would do you good to see this-” with a flick of his wand another spell made a gash across Harry’s face.  Draco tried to shut his eyes the next moment but found that he couldn’t.  He was frozen, perfectly frozen.
And he had tried – tried very effectively – to never think about the thing he had buried.  Instead he thought of Harry as he had been in school.  A boy with untidy hair, and Slytherin green eyes.  But now at last he would have to contend with the form he had actually buried.  A form incomplete and
But it was worth it.  It was joyous to see Harry on a broomstick again, his hair wild and windswept, his face rosy from the cold and the exercise.  They flew as high as they dared and then chased each other, diving in impressive spirals, Harry significantly better due to the lag that had developed in his Comet.  They only started to go back inside when the first signs of sunrise came.
When he reached the dungeon, he found the door open.  They had had no prisoners since Potter’s escape.  He lit his wand and walked in, holding it high.  He wanted to see some proof of Potter's existence, perhaps a little piece of paper in his untidy hand.  Or a discarded jacket, a forgotten book, something.  The place, however, was empty.  There was nothing here to indicate the presence of prisoners, much less of the famous Harry Potter.
He closed his hand tight around the invisibility cloak, his nails digging the delicate material against his white palm.
There were so many things he cherished in his memories of Harry.  But there would also be so many to cherish in the future.  Harry with his head on Draco’s shoulder.  Harry lying beside him in bed.  Harry smiling as he dried off his body with Draco’s Slytherin green towel after a shower.  Harry’s mouth hot against him. Harry’s hands digging at his shoulder.  Harry’s legs wrapping around his waist.
He moved his legs.  “I can move it.”
The elf gave a squeal and then rushed to the bed.
“He should stay in bed.”
Unmistakably, fear flashed through Lucius’s eyes.  They all knew how much he hated being alone with him.  “You do it.”
A second later the spell was lifted, and he found himself in the middle of a scream that filled the room.  His body shivering and convulsing, the pain still lingering, just under the skin.
Despite the Dittany he was taking, he now coughed blood regularly.  It had quickly been normalized by them, and Harry always said: “I don’t feel it really, it doesn’t hurt or anything.”  But it was growing increasingly alarming as it began happening on a daily basis.
“You saved me, it’s only fair I save you.  We always did everything in equal measures.” A hint of a smile came onto his face. “I step on you, you cut me open, you save me from the flames, I bring you back to life.”
It was only a matter of time.  It was only a matter of time.
“I can fix it,” she said quietly.  “But it’s just temporary.”
“Wanna take a bath?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco leaned down and began running the water, checking the temperature was correct, while Harry stood behind him.  Draco could see him through the large mirror on the opposite wall – he was staring at the space, as if taking it all in: from the golden framed mirrors, to the giant tub, to the beautiful and delicate oil paintings that hung on the wall.
“Such a disappointment,” said a third.
His stomach churned.  He wanted to be sick.  He wanted to crawl into Cepheus’s grave by the sea. To be still and forgotten.  He deserved nothing better and so much worse.  Time lurched on.  Lucius fell silent, curled into a ball, his hair spread over him, his face red from all the sobbing.
Draco was trying to get them both to eat more, but it was a struggle. He could usually manage some broth and a bit of bread.   Harry ate looking at the plate and going section by section automatically until it was empty again.  Sometimes he would grimace, as if eating were painful for him.
But he hadn’t.  Being with that Potter boy – rotting and sickly as he was – had been more important to him than his own family. He hadn’t even made an appearance at their dinner table.  He had not even spared a moment for the father who loved him so.  It was disappointing.  She expected loyalty within her family. As she had been loyal to him.
“Thank you,” Harry muttered.
She performed a spell he did not know, in the silent manner that she had, saying nothing, her face hiding any thought that she might have had.  “How does it feel now?” she asked Harry when the blue light had gone.
with the boy.”
His hand crept underneath the cloak until he found Harry’s hand and gave it a squeeze.
For his part, being alone suited him. It was a great reprieve from the pressures he had felt the last few years.  There was no one here to criticize him, and no one here he had to shield himself from.  He enjoyed the solitude, and the beauty of the wilds, and, more than anything being able to spend the bulk of his time thinking.
“Are you still feeling diplomatic, Narcissa? Or you do have something to say to me?”
in every sense of the word.
“I suppose that is to be expected, your wife and son did quite a number on you, didn’t they?” Abruptly the Dark Lord pointed his wand at Luscius, and Draco tried (and failed) to shut his eyes again.  His father screamed, the sound echoing over the room, cascading into his very heart.  His body twitched, his head jerking, unable to handle the sensation.
They did go flying that night, once darkness covered the grounds.   It was a risk, of course, and Narcissa had warned him against it, but Draco couldn’t be deterred.  He wanted to give Harry his best life – not just keep him locked up in his bedroom.  He could see Narcissa, a pale, disapproving statue, looking down at them from a high window as they left the house, her eyes burning into him.
Narcissa ignored him.  She cast another spell and the blue came back for a moment.  Slowly, she rose to her feet again, turning to look at him.  “I don’t think he’s going to last, Draco.”
Sometimes, Draco would ask a pointed question: “Did you hate me when we were at school together?”
Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s black hair.  “Are you?  Okay, I mean?”
He replayed time and time again the two instances when he had actually seen Harry wearing it.  The first was when they were 13 and Harry had snuck into Hogsmeade.  It had been a chilly day in November and Harry, invisible, had thrown mud balls at him, Crabbe, and Goyle.  His aim was admittedly quite good, but then the cloak had slipped to reveal his face.  Draco still remembered it so perfectly.  The sunshine reflecting on his glasses, his cheeks flushed from the cold and the exercise, his mouth in a comical angle, like he had been caught right in the middle of a laugh.
“Dittany is all I can think of,” she said quietly.  “Perhaps that book-”
It was a frivolous concern.  What did it matter what Potter thought of any of this?  He was dead, and yet Draco couldn’t stop his train of thought.  The longer he spent alone, the stronger his conviction was.  He set out on this journey half kidding himself, but now with every day that passed he felt a greater sense of urgency.
He raised his wands and said in the commanding tone of an aristocrat said: “Almus Exanimis
“I don’t know what to do,” said Draco, more to himself than to Harry.
“But I do think he was right about one thing, you know.  For some people, for
“Hey!”
For a moment he thought that she was going to deny him.  That she was going to refuse to tell this story at this time.  But the hesitation (if there was really any hesitation) lasted only an instant.  She moved to the side of his bed, sitting just as she had when he was a boy.  Her dress folded neatly; her hands, beautiful and ringed, in her lap.
Reaching a bare white hand into the stony depths of the sarcophagus, he brushed the man's half rotten arm to the side and grabbed the book.  He could feel the supple leather between his fingers as he pulled it up and then, backing away, he shut the sarcophagus by magic, without a second glance at the figures within.
This seemed to please him for he lifted the spell.  It made no difference however; Lucius remained sprawled on his back, sobbing and screaming, inconsolable.
“What’s wrong?” said Harry, his eye on him.
of blood. Like a dangerous amount of blood. In fact, the last time he had seen this much blood had probably been that day in the bathroom when Harry had almost killed him.  This was critical, an emergency in every sense of the word.  And yet, what was he supposed to do? He didn’t know any magic that could heal this.
Someone kneed him hard in the jaw, and he blinked back, the impact blurring his vision.
Calmly, she walked over to stand by him, one of her hands reaching out and touching his shoulder.  He moved out of her grasp.  “I am not saying this to hurt you, my love.   I am only saying it to remind you that this will not be forever.” Her eyes went back to the bed again.  “Enjoy this for now, but afterwards,” she gave a shrug.  “Your life will still be waiting for you; me, and your father, and the Dark Lord.” She stretched out her hand again and wrapped it around his wrist.  “It doesn’t make sense to alienate everybody for him.”
“I wanna stay up here,” said Harry.  “It would be nice to watch the sunrise with you.”
“Draco-” Voldemort’s voice brought a shiver down his spine, and his eyes inadvertently moved to him.  “It appears you did not tell me everything about your little trip-”  the last words were spoken with hatred, his lips pressed together into a tight line.
He was pleased by how heavy it was.  As he opened it, he saw cylindrical shapes all wrapped up in white linen.  He unravelled the fabric to see a crystal jar full of a murky brown liquid.  The bag had more than a dozen of them.  He took it and turned around, moving towards the old truck he had carved out. He could feel Narcissa watching him from the other side of the clearing, but it failed to make him self-conscious.  In that moment it felt like he had nothing to hide from her.
He turned his eyes to the next page.  It had further instruction on the working of the spell.  It could, of course, simply be uttered, but there were things to make it more potent.  He read through these instructions, which were made by the same hurried hand.  They brought a knot to his stomach.  He had thought that digging up Harry would be the worst part, but sections of these instructions made that seem like a children’s game.
In the evening they sat by the largest window in his bedroom. Draco would make lit candles float around them and they would play chess and cards in the semi darkness.  Both of them were rather careless players, more interested in the game than in being clever.  It was strange to Draco that, despite 7 years of fierce competition between them, neither cared if they won or lost.
“You call me my Lord, but it is him you look to.”
Carefully, one by one, he unravelled the fabric to reveal jars, and unscrewed the lids.  As the light in the Forest dimmed, he spilled their contents into the tub.  The scent was familiar.  It brought back days in Herbology class, looking at Potter’s reflection in the glass of the green house.
Draco could have purred.
She apparated away with a crack and he moved back to bed.
Before entering he removed his invisibility cloak and cast Lumos.   He had expected to find something grand.  A castle carved into the stone, or, at the very least, a high vaulted ceiling like those underneath Malfoy Manor.  What he found instead was a small space, about the size of a closet.  For a moment he thought it was empty, and then he saw the rune for life written on one of the walls.  He approached it, and held his palm against it.  It felt damp to the touch and, although it was neither hot nor cold, it made his skin tingle.
Before sunset he found something.  An engraving upon a stone.  It seemed to have an aura around it, something potent, that he could almost physically feel as he got close to it.  He knelt by it.  The rock itself was not much larger than a Quaffle, and it was dark and flattened by the sea.   He had to look at it very carefully before finding the inscription, and when he did it bore only one word: beloved.  This single word was carved 7 times in ancient runes.  He traced it with his index finger and it felt like touching a hands through glass, like reaching back and making contact with something lost so long ago.
When the water had reached about halfway Draco began putting in salts and bubbles and flower petals, a process Harry observed with some curiosity.  He seemed more interested in this than he had in anything else so far.  It was good to see.
“Do you want to try to eat something darling?” she said.  “Just a little broth?”
“Well-” began Draco.  “I am the last Black-” his father made a derisive noise.  “And you named me Draco.  The Dark Lord is starting a revival of the old ways, and the old magic, wouldn’t Cepheus’s teaching be a perfect fuel for it? Isn’t it-” he moved his eyes to meet his mothers.  “Don’t you think that this is my destiny?”
He raised his wand again and Draco shut his eyes.
“But I was making connections, not gravedigging.”
“I just don’t feel connected to any of it-”  he looked down at his chest. “I recognize it as my body, and I know that I can move it, but it’s like when it’s very cold and you can’t feel your fingertips.”
“But?”
As if to specifically prove him wrong, Harry lurched forward, vomiting blood.
“And when you are fully recovered,” Lucius would add. “The world is yours.  The Dark Lord has been most generous to us, his old loyal companions, you can have your pick of positions.”
“She was dead?”
She was pensive, her eyes unreadable as ever.  “He shall be very well soon.”
He made up his tent and rested the night inside, eating a good dinner, taking a shower, and changing into fresh pajamas before crawling into his warmed bed.  Although his body ached, and his head was pounding, he found it difficult to sleep.  It was just wasting more time, and he often found his eyes drifting to the heavy book on his night table.
(See the end of the chapter for
.  He did it unconsciously - it had simply become an automatic response.  He was also using his wand more and more, even for little things, like filling a glass of water or cutting up his dinner.  His mother would have disapproved, to her way of thinking magic was not meant for the inconsequential, but then again, her way of thinking was no longer Draco’s.
“Where did they take her?”
Draco found himself turning away.
In the evening he would walk around the forest in Harry’s old invisibility cloak.  He loved the feel of it against his skin, and every time he slipped it on, he thought of how often Harry had worn it, how many hours he had spent with it on.  Had it been with this cloak that he had found the Chamber of Secrets?  Had it been with this cloak that he used Umbridge’s fireplace?
Harry’s one green eyes was fixed on him.  It was neither sad nor sacred, but there was something else there, some anxiety.  And for the first time Draco realized that Harry was not scared of dying, he was scared of leaving him alone again.  Draco squeezed his eyes tight; he was not going to cry; he was not going to cry in front of her.  “Fix him,” he said, grinding his teeth together.
She smiled.  “I’m only trying to help you.”
He nodded his head.
His burial place was unremarkable and yet Draco knew it.  He could sense their sudden proximity to each other and when he reached it a slow feeling of calm swept through him.  He smiled serenely to himself, and here at last turned his attention to Cepheus’s book.
He curled up into a ball, his knees folded into himself, looking just like his father.  And as he closed his eyes, he saw Harry mutilated, Harry in pain, Harry bleeding and silent, forced to endure hell for him.
“He loved her.  He surrendered everything in the world for her.  They had no more castles, no more subservient muggles, no more dragons. Instead they moved from old place to old place, with nothing but one another.  For other wizards thought what he had done was wicked, and they wanted to hunt for them, to slay them.”
After their long morning in bed they would eat, although neither had developed an appetite yet.  Draco stuck to fruits for the most part.  Harry ate a little of everything, but almost like he didn’t taste it.   They both enjoyed the tea though.  And he liked seeing Harry’s face as he tried the different types until he settled on a hibiscus as his favorite.
She was quiet for a moment, and he looked up at her expectantly.  However, it was always impossible to read his mother. “The laws of nature can be broken by powerful magic, but breaking them has consequences.  Cepheus brought his wife back to the land of the living, but she was not the same as before.  She could walk beside him, and fly in his arms, and converse with him about all she had seen in the dark world, but she was not the same.  Cepheus had managed to bring back her essence, to reanimate her limbs, but she had no soul, and her form was not like one of the living.”
That evening neither one of them could manage any food.  Instead they lay together, Harry’s head on Draco’s shoulder.
Loving someone, really truly loving someone, could not coexist with wanting things from them.  Love was not a negotiation; it was an absolute.  At school, his friends had followed him, but wasn’t that largely because of his status? Because of his money? Because of his looks? And if that were true, then how could he have ever thought that it was love?
There was something healing about them being together.  As if kisses in the dark could cure everything rotten that had happened to both of them.  As if talking about his doodles would erase all the ways in which they had both failed.  Their intimacy was not based on sex or physicality, instead it was a complete understanding, and a complete trust.
“You’re hurt,” said Harry, his singular eye on Draco’s maimed left hand.
“One by one he went through his adversaries.  He sought them out in their strongholds and performed magic so potent we can barely conceive of it.  It’s said that he tore down entire castles with a word.  That he had spells to stop a man’s blood from coursing through his body.  It is said he dueled 10 men at once and killed them all.  Some even say that it was he who created the Avada Kedavra curse.  And as each of his enemies fell, he got closer to finding his Princess again – but years were spent in battles, years were spent getting information of her whereabouts.”
“It’s been lost, Draco, like so many things in the old world.  But she and Cepheus were remarkably happy.  Their dragons guarded their castle, and they had a village of muggles to worship them, to bring them offerings, to bow to their wishes.  And as the years passed Cepheus’s magic grew strong and stronger.  It is said that he could turn himself invisible, that he could fly through the air formless a cloud.  He could turn himself – not only into one animal like a common Animagus – but into any animal he chose.  His powers were boundless – or so he thought –
Voldemort was speaking again, but the words sounded as if they were spoken underwater.  Every one of them unintelligible.  He felt the arms around him let him go and he fell forward, the pain increasing at the sudden and harsh contact with the floor.
When he returned to his mother that Christmas, he told her about it.  It did not seem to affect her in any way, perhaps there was too much happening in the present for her to think about the past like she used to.  “Did you know his middle name was Draconis?” he asked her instead.
There was a loud bang and then someone levitated him.  He opened his eyes to see himself four or five feet from the floor, his hands forced to his sides, his legs stretched down.  A Death Eater he did not recognize had his wand raised towards him, and, on the ground, Harry lay on his back.  His face looked like it had been mauled, deep cuts zig zagging through the skin and heavy red swelling around the mouth.  There was blood over his good eye and he had it closed, as Voldemort hit him with another spell that slashed deeply from his left ear all the way down to his right collarbone, wetting Draco’s old pajamas with blood.
“Dobby?”
“In the old places,” she whispered.  “And Cepheus travelled through all of them.  The Pike mountains in the north, the Snowden to the East, he even went to the continent.  In his travels he acquired more knowledge and more magic than any living wizard. And when he returned to his castle, he was no longer alone.
