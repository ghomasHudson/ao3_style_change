Draco liked it when Harry would tilt his head ever so slightly as he asked a question, it reminded him of a puppy hearing an unfamiliar sound. Draco licked his lips and parted them to speak, but nothing came out. Why was Harry sitting in front of him? Why did he seem like he wasn't even hungover when Draco looked like he just shagged someone in the bathrooms? Why was he pushing Draco so much where Draco didn't want to resist anymore, he just wanted to give in to his temptation and kiss the bloke senseless. Harry cleared his throat, which snapped Draco out of his stare. Harry had a soft pink hue painting his cheeks as he placed his Potions book on the table, how long had Draco been staring? Why was Harry blushing? So many stupid questions that Draco had no good answer for. He pulled his eyebrows together and thinned his lips, watching Harry open his page to the same one he was on, glancing over at Draco's book to make sure he had gotten the right number. "You don't care if I join you right? I need to study for the liquid luck potion as well.  Ron and Hermione are too busy... well, they are just too busy to help me right now." Harry asked, trailing off when he brought up his two friends. Draco knew what he was going to say, they were too busy snogging each other senseless and cast Harry out like a third wheel.
Harry grinned and watched Draco's actions, tilting his head to look at Draco's face. Draco dropped his head to look at the book so he could distract himself from Harry. Harry let out a hum and tapped his foot on the hardwood floor beneath their feet, watching Draco read was actually quite entertaining in an odd way. "So, how's your head? You left early and I can only assume because you were starting to get too drunk so you went back to sleep?" He asked, trying to fill the awkward silence that surrounded them. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, not looking away from his book as he cleared his throat, "I was just tired, I'm not used to staying up that late into the night. I was not drunk so don't you go spreading that around." He snapped back, grabbing the book to bring it closer to his face. Harry simply hummed and shook his head, he shrugged his shoulder and leaned his forearms into the table, "Why would I spread it around? I'm done fighting with you Draco, I was thinking we could start fresh?" Harry asked, rubbing his hands together in anticipation of Draco's response. Draco looked up with a frown and scoffed, glancing out the window to their left. "Have you gone bloody mad? You rejected my friendship when you smacked my hand away in the first year, what makes you think I want to be your best mate now?" Draco snorted, clearly finding it funny Harry wanted to 'start fresh'.
His friends had stopped their loud blabbering to look over at the event unfolding. Draco bit the inside of his lip and looked up to meet Harry's expectant gaze. "We'd lov-" Pansy started, shocked to hear Draco pitch in his two sense. "Sod off, Potter." He muttered out before he rose quickly and exited the pub.
Draco was speechless, he had absolutely nothing to say and that might've been a good thing. He kept opening and closing his mouth almost wanting to say something but decided against it. He turned his head, his eyes finding the wall as he pursed his lips slightly. "You're making this hard.." he muttered out before he turned quickly on his heels quickly and made his way down the spiral staircase. Draco made his way through the crowded pub to their table and leaned down to tell Pansy he was wanting to leave. Pansy thinned her lips into a frown and said her goodbye's, placing a few silver Sickles down to pay for both Dracos and her drinks before she tossed on her thick winter coat and walked out the door. Draco followed, not bothering to look back because he could feel the glare Harry was shooting him from the staircase.
He felt his cheeks heat up, making him turn his head to the side to look at anything but Draco. He let out a small chuckle and shrugged his shoulders lazily. "I see. You know, you could've given me a shake, you're probably freezing." He mentioned and looked over the naked trees that surrounded them. "Not really." He hummed and looked down at the broken step below their feet. Harry stood up, wobbling a bit from the sudden movement, and looked down at Draco with a smile on his chapped lips. "We should go back inside, the others might think we're up to something," Harry suggested with a rub of his arm, shuffling on his feet with embarrassment from blushing so much. Draco stood up and stretched out his back, hearing it pop a few times before turning on his heels to walk inside. Harry followed, making sure to stay far enough away so he didn't step on Draco's shoes. They walked into the room everyone was in, surprisingly still filled with snore, and sat down on the sleeping bags they had claimed for themselves. Harry looked around at all his friends and scratched the back of his head, deciding if he wanted to wake them or let them sleep off their hangover. Luckily, today was Saturday, and no one had to get up early like usual.
"Why are you so bloody thick-headed?! I try to be nice to you, I try to start over, and you push me away with more force than the first time! What are you so afraid of?! What possibly could go wrong with starting over you twat?!" He yelled, pulling Draco forward a bit so Harry's forearm lay on Draco's chest. "Bloody Christ I just don't like you!! Why can't you understand that?!!" He retorted, his own expression contorting to irritation as he felt himself being pulled even closer. Their lips were so close, the only thing guarding them is their noses which were almost pressed firmly together. Having never seen this much rage in Harry's eyes, Draco lost his train of thought. "How do you not like me?! You were so nice this afternoon?! or this morning?! Please explain because I'm not buying it!" He groaned, his grip firm on the collar of Draco's hoodie. Draco stayed silent for a while but soon shoved Harry off his body, his breath heavy and rapid as Harry stumbled on his feet. "Stay the bloody hell away from me." He finally said and turned to walk away but Harry wasn't having. He walked quickly to the front of Draco and put his arms out, his face determined to get some answers. "Not until you tell me what you're afraid of." He said and moved anytime Draco would move. Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath, his hands curling into a fist as he tried to compose himself. "Get away from me." He warned, his eyes sliding open to a slightly darker grey filled with something Harry couldn't put his finger on. "No." He retorted and flinched when it seemed Draco was going in for a swing, his eyes sliding shut to brace himself for the impact.
"Say it. Draco, say the words out loud." She ordered, his arms crossing just below her chest, her eyebrows pulling together in a tight frown as she waited for Draco to speak up. "I-" He started but closed his mouth making Pansy stand up and walk around to where his head was facing, crouching down and placing her hands on his knees. She looked at him expectantly, her expression no longer angry, it was calm and comforting, waiting patiently for Draco to say it.
The room became quiet, and Draco squinted at the brightness of the light Blaise had turned on just before leaving. He let out a painful moan as he twisted to the side to place his feet on the cold stone floor. He rubbed his abdomen as he let out a yawn, walking around the bed to the chest at the foot of it. He unlatched it and gathered out his clean uniform. He slid his arms through the white button-up, pressing his chin against his bare collarbones to look down as he was pushing each button through the slits. Draco rubbed his throbbing head as he pulled out the uniform pants. He slipped into them rather swiftly and buttoned them, zipping them up with a short tug. He stuffed the button-up into the rim of his pants and wrapped his tie around his neck, tieing a quick knot and pushing it up to tighten it a bit. He slid the black sweater vest over the dress shirt and put on some socks; slipping into his already tied shoes. He grabbed his robe, stuffing it in his satchel as he made his way out of the dorm. He walked slowly down the stair, only hearing the crackling of the fire in the common room; everyone had left for breakfast. He slipped out of the password locked door and walked down the dungeon corridor. He let out a long yawn as the migraine in his head throbbed with quite a bit of force.
The blistering cold air hit pale cheeks as Draco stepped out of the warm confines of the Hogwarts castle. His cheeks flush from the sudden drop in temperature, his chin tucking slightly further into the dark green and bright silver scarf that was hung rather slack around his neck and placed gingerly on his shoulders. His pale blue eyes flicked up to the snow riddled sky, his eyelashes hitting the tops of his eyelids as he stared at the light grey clouds. He let out a heavy sigh as he stepped down cobble stairs, his right arm hooked gently around his shoulder bag as he made his way through the main courtyard. A rather short bob of black hair followed behind Dracos heels, a sly smirk on the female's lips as they walked in silence. She slid up to Dracos side and clung to his left arm, her eyes batting up to look at Draco. "Draco dear, it's rather cold out today, mind holding me?" Pansy Parkinson asked, her small smirk growing slightly when Draco shoved her off his arm. "Bugger off Pansy, you have a robe." He huffed, his arms folding into a tight cross over his chest as he walked to the rather large and elderly oak tree that was just shy of the middle of the courtyard. The golden yellow and dark orange leaves were scattered about the cobble street, scuttering across the stone when a gust of wind blew into the enclosed area.
The class ran by fairly quickly after Draco and Blaise finished their potion, which meant it was now lunchtime. Pansy had waited for Draco and Blaise outside of the Potions classroom, having had a free period. She smiled and hooked her arm with Draco, making him let out a sigh as they walked into the Great Hall. They all got only a few glanced before they settled down at the Slytherin table. "So, how was the test? I have potions after thing." Pansy asked, her arm detaching from Draco's as she went in for a sandwich. Draco shrugged and cupped his cheek in his hand as he leaned on the table. "It was fine, Pansy. You studied so you'll be fine. This prat didn't study at all so I had to do everything." Blaise said, whacking the back of Draco's head in which Draco decided to ignore instead of arguing with Blaise. When Harry and Hermione walked into the Great Hall with Ron trying to catch up behind him, Draco perked up a little bit, not so slouched over the table anymore. Pansy sighed and frowned, trying to act hurt, "Not even going to perk up to his friends like he perks up to Potter, how rude." She sighed and looked down at the sandwich she had in hand. "Put a can in it, Parkinson." He retorted and watched Harry sit down at the Gryffindor table, hearing a small snicker from beside him.
Draco gulped his eyes slowly going over to look at the lemon drop packages. He rubbed his neck and walked over to them, looking down at the bright yellow box. When Harry slid up beside him, Draco jumped in surprise as their arms pressed together. Their hands brushed ever so slightly together, making the blond jolt his hand away in a swift motion. Harry gave him a weird glance before shaking it off to look down at the lemon drops. He licked his lips and looked up at Draco, a smile on his lips that never seemed to leave. "You like lemon drops? I like them too, they have the right amount of sweet and sour mix." He hummed as he fantasized about the taste of the yellow squishy candy. He picked a box and shook it a little in the air at Draco before turning on his heels to walk towards the cashier. Draco cursed at himself, clearly not having the courage to speak up and ask the bloke if he wanted a box of them before he bought a box for himself. Draco snatched a box and walked up to the cashier after Harry left. Draco placed the box on the counter and dug in his pocket for ten bronze Knuts. He placed them on the counter before snatching the box again and stuffing it in his pocket, maybe he could offer when Harry ran out of the ones he just bought.
After a while, Harry met Draco's gaze reluctantly, a shy smile on his lips as the courtyard grew quiet. "Well?" He asked, pulling his eyebrows together to try and force away the blush that was growing rapidly. "Oh," Draco muttered out, almost crashing back into their conversation once more. Why was his mind wandering so much today? He could usually control his thoughts anytime he saw Potter, but today or better yet right now, he was thinking about everything he wanted to do with Harry. "Uhm... I don't think sleepovers are my thing." He answered and rubbed his neck, not looking away from the glistening eyes right in front of him. Harry nodded and then shrugged quickly. "Yeah! Yeah, I figured. It was stupid of me to ask anyway, I'm sorry." Harry said quickly and jumped up into a stand position, his feet getting mixed up as he tripped over himself. Draco quickly jumped forwards and grabbed Harry's elbow, pulling him into his chest which made him lose balance and fall back into the fountain. The water felt like sharp, cold needles piercing his skin which made him tense up quite a bit. He slowly opened his eyes, having closed them when he hit the water, and looked at the horror on Harry's face. "Oh... Oh my god. Draco I am so sorry! Merlin, you're drenched!" He said, clearly not being as soaked as Draco was from the way he landed on top of him. He sat back on the edge of the fountain and grabbed Draco's forearm to pull him out of the water. He sat there quietly as frigid water fell from his body, "Damn it..." He sighed as his teeth clattered against each other.
Draco swallowed hard as he watched Pansys back before she disappeared into the store. He cleared his throat and shoved his hands into his coat pocket, averting his eyes from Potters. "Yes well, I would need to be bloody sozzled to talk to you properly." He scoffed, his tone harsh as almost as he wanted the boy to walk away. Harry only let out a giggle as he stepped forwards a bit so the tips of their shoes were touching. That action made Dracos breath hitch as he looked into those emerald eyes he so desperately wanted to look at all evening. "I guess you're sozzled then." He smirked and slid beside Draco in one quick motion. "Walk with me?" He asked, taking a slow step forward to see if Draco would follow. Draco slowly stepped forward, following Harry's stride. "I didn't know you fancied sweets." He muttered, trying to fill their silent walk to Honeydukes. Draco snorted and shook his head, "I bloody despise sweets." He retorted, watching Harry's smile fade from the corner of his mouth. Draco knew Harry actually quite liked sweets, watching him dig into them at the feasts in the Great Hall.
Draco could feel his breath on his face, it was nice and minty like he had just freshly brushed his teeth. Draco stood up, which made Harry stumble back a little and hit a bookshelf. "I don't need your bloody help, you're not my savior like everyone else." He called out, picking up his potions book and stuffed it in his satchel. He walked past Harry, their shoulders colliding a bit which made Harry fall back into the bookshelf again with a grunt. Draco walked out of the library and down the corridor, making his way out of the castle to his first-class; Herbology. Blaise met him halfway and slapped the back of his shoulder, matching Draco's steady pace. "That's for taking my potions book, you have your own you dim-wit," Blaise stated, holding out his hand so Draco could return the book to its rightful owner. Draco sighed and rummaged around his bag for the book, that's when he noticed his missing robe that was previously hooked around the strap. He looked behind him as Blaise snatched the book out of his hand and watched Draco with a curious gaze. "Lose something?" He asked, looking back to where Draco's eyes were glued. Draco groaned and wanted to slap himself on the back due to his stupidity, his robe was probably back in the library, which meant he would have to either go get it now and risk seeing Harry or get it later and risk freezing his balls off.
Harry, now slightly more interested in Draco, is trying his best to get the bloke alone so they could talk. Of course, Draco would try his best to avoid that situation.
Harry slouched into the comfortable chair and sighed, shaking his head rather quickly "Who wants to pace themselves, I want to be wasted when I go back to Hogwarts." He whined, crossing his arms tight over his chest. Draco glanced over at Hermione, who wore an annoyed expression as she retorted back with a snarky remark. Draco then looked down slightly at Harry, who was shivering quite noticeably. Draco furrowed his brows and looked at the table, fidgeting with his thumbs as the others bickered around them. Draco did not expect to be squeezed up to Harry tonight, he expected to get a few drinks and head back to the castle annoyed that he didn't speak up to Harry.
After Herbology Draco went in search of his robe. He was shivering half the class because he only had two, rather thin, layers on. He walked into the Library and over to the table he had been seated at. The robe was nowhere to be seen, and people were not sitting at that table so it's not like he could look around it or under it. Draco gripped his hair and let out a heavy sigh before turning on his heels and out the doors of the library, of course, someone took it and Draco had a rising suspicion he knew exactly who it was. He walked down the hall, his hands in his pants pocket and silver eyes averted towards the ground. Walking absentmindedly, he collided with another person, watching their feet slip as they fell on their arse. He looked up surprised, not expecting to see the messy rat nest of brunette hair and viridescent eyes staring right back at him with just the same about of surprise. Draco huffed and crossed his arm, putting all his weight on one hip as he leaned down slightly. "What are you doing on the floor?" Draco snickered, watching Harry stumbled upon his feet. He stepped forward a few times, poking into Draco's sternum with a sharp-pointed finger. "Oh, can it." He groaned, but soon his expression grew to one of concern as he looked over Draco. "You're shivering?..." He pointed out, watching the blond wrap his arms around himself. "Yeah,  it's bloody freezing and I lost my robe. Do you have it?" He asked, rubbing his biceps a little.
Why was he in this situation again? Right, Pansy got invited to go out with them for some reason and she pulled Draco along against his own will. He would've much rather been asleep in his dorm room dreaming about Harry, now he actually had to answer his question, try and remain civil when he for some reason was so on edge. He didn't know if he wanted to make up some excuse to leave and go back to the comfort of his bed, expecting a massive hangover in the morning, or stay here and remain pressed so close to Harry. A knock on the door made Draco jump in surprise, he didn't realize how much time had passed with him just standing there in the same position. He opened the door to be greeted by green eyes, making his lips curve in an instinctive frown, hiding the small smile he wanted to show off. "Draco, I got worried you may have slipped and hit your head, you've been up here for a good while now." Harry joked, letting a small snicker leave his lips. When Draco didn't respond, he tilted his head to show concern. Harry had just said he was worried about him, he was worried about Draco so he came up here to search for him, that word alone made butterflies fly up to his throat from his stomach. He swallowed hard and pulled his eyebrows close, the frown on his lips deepening as he thought of an answer. "I don't need your worry, sod off." He grunted and shoved past Harry, what a perfect answer when there was a simple 'thank you' wanting to jump from the tip of his tongue.
The walk was long, and the morning sun was now shining bright as ever directly onto the snowy land. He made his way into the castle, the warmth engulfing him quickly and effortlessly making his cheeks grow a warm pink hue. He sighed and made his way to the Great Hall, hearing small voices coming from the large room; breakfast was still going on. He walked in slowly, a few eyes flickering away from their friends to the large mahogany doors Draco had entered before turning back to their friends. He made his way to the familiar black bob of hair at the Slytherin table, hearing her giggle at something Theo had told her. Draco sat down beside her, his head immediately going down to the table only to be covered by his arms. Pansy turned around while her glare drilled holes into the back of the blond's head, she sighed heavily and twisted her body around to face Draco. "Where were you last night? I didn't see you come back to the common room, and Blaise said you weren't in your room all night." She asked, her head tilting to the left a bit to try and get a look at Dracos face. "I went drinking. Pan, listen to me." He muttered and pushed himself up, looking directly at the female sitting beside him. "I don't want anything to do with Potter, alright? I need to avoid him, whatever it costs, do you understand?" He asked, desperation lacing his voice as his eyes flicked frantically at all the other people around them to see if they could hear him.
Draco wanted to reach other his hand and straighten his tie, he wanted to smooth down his robe on his shoulders, he wanted to cup Harry's cheeks just to feel the warmth radiating off them. Draco cleared his throat, forcing himself out of his wandering thoughts as frowned at Harry. "You haven't asked a single question, and you're not even reading anymore, you're just staring at the page." Draco pointed out, noticing that Harry had stopped mouthing the word and was just staring at the page. Harry looked up as Draco spoke, his lips curving up a little as he tapped his finger on the table. "You need help at all so sod off. I don't want you here with your annoying way of reading." Draco scoffed and flicked his hand, watching Harry's smile fall. "Okay, I'll admit that I don't need help, I've actually already studied this section already." He answered, closing the book so he could lean on his elbows to get closer to Draco. "I was wondering if you needed help, so I waited to see if you would ask. But of course, you wouldn't ask me,  you never need help, especially if it's from me." Harry scoffed and slouched back into the chair, his arms crossing over his chest. Draco swallowed hard, realizing Harry came him to help him or make small talk with him. Draco looked down as he felt his cheeks heat up slightly in embarrassment. "If you sit there and be quiet you can stay..." He mumbled and pulled the book closer to the edge of the table.
"Merlin's beard, I bloody love the prat!" He yelled, looking directly at her when he finally said it. The weight off his shoulders lessened as he looked over his expression, making sure she wasn't going to do something stupid. The smile that grew on her lips surprised Draco, but he soon felt comforted by the grin as she walked around and sat down beside him again, her head going to lean on his shoulder. "Now was that so hard?" She asked and kicked the snow away from her feet, hearing another heavy sigh leave his lips. "Yeah, it was."
"I should go, clearly not as welcomed as I assumed." He muttered and nealed down to retie his shoelaces that had come undone. Harry shot up on his feet and shook his head quickly, walking over to Draco. "No! It's okay, Ron is just groggy when he wakes up, it's no big deal." He chuckled, his cheeks puffing up a bit as he smiled. Draco looked up at him from his nealing position, his gaze harsh as a frown formed on his lips. "It's fine, Potter. I understand your friends aren't keen on my presence as you are." He muttered and stood up, stepping back a little bit to create a gap between the two. "Give my hoodie back when you're able to change." He pointed out and turned on his heels, stepping over Neville carefully while he felt Harry's eyes on the back of his head. He walked out of the room and slipped his hand through his slightly messy and wavy hair, a sigh he could no longer contain escaping his lips. He stepped out of the Shrieking Shack back out to the frigid morning he was once so comfortable in, the snow crunching under his shoes anytime he took a step. He stuffed his hands in his hoodie pocket and glanced back at the step Harry and him were once sat at staring at the stars together.
Harry tried to squeeze the water out of Dracos robe before dropping his arms and head with a sigh. Draco stood up and pulled his drenched robe off to give it a squeeze to try and get as much water out of it before he walked into the castle. He looked down at Harry and flicked his forehead, making the brunette flinch a bit and look up at Draco. "You're wet too. Come on," he ordered, pausing a bit when he shivered. He slowly started walking back to the castle doors, looking back to make sure Harry was following. Harry stood up quickly and wrapped his arms around himself before following Draco closely, not wanting to lose him. "I'm sorry..." Harry muttered out and looked down at his feet as he walked. Draco sighed and clutched his hand into a fist, "Stop saying you're sorry. It's fine." He grunted and walked down the stairs to the dungeon. Harry looked up as they started walking down the stair, finally getting a hint to where they were going. He gulped and tried searching for any other Slytherins that could be around. "Draco, Are we going to the Slytherin common room?" he asked just above a whisper to make sure others couldn't hear his voice. Draco crossed his arms to try and conserve his body heat before looking back at Harry with an unreadable expression, but Harry could tell he was pissed. "Yes. Don't worry, everyone is in class most likely, I don't think anyone has a free period but me cause they are too proud of their bloody studies." He replied and stood in front of the stone door that had a snake wrapped around it. It reminded Harry of the entrance to the chamber of secrets, but less creepy and more welcoming. Draco whipped his head back around and shot Harry a small glare, "Cover your ears. I don't need you sneaking into our common room every bloody second of the day." he ordered and made sure Harry had his ears firmly covered before he whispered the code. The snake shot back into a small hole and the door popped open. Draco held his hand out to tell Harry to stay put so he could search the common room before the Gryffindor walked in.
“Yes Tom. Ah, sorry. Lord Voldemort is what you prefer now right? You’ll have to pardon my lack of proper respect for such a great and powerful lord.”
“Lady Malfoy. The current laws regarding Creatures and Beings, as you call them, are of the same nature of some of the third world countries we are affiliated with. It’s so outdated people back at the Confederation call this place backwater you know?

“I’m afraid so Tom. No student is allowed to stay over the summer holidays.” Dumbledore told him and Tom felt rage like nothing else boil in his gut. “This is not to say that you must return to the orphanage. If perhaps, there was another place.” he said and Tom looked up at him sharply to ask what in bloody hell he was talking about but the man was looking to his doorway. Tom swirled around to see and saw Evans there, as stoic as usual.
“If you kill, Tom,” she said suddenly in the quiet and he paused. He had been very, very careful not to let her know about just how far he was willing to hurt someone, nor about how deep his hatred ran for mudbloods. “If you kill another person, your soul fractures. If left alone it will heal itself, but it will be scarred. And killing someone is a stain on the human psyche. It will never come out.” she told him and he sneered a bit. Who was she to begin spouting these noble, Dumble-esque words at him? She was nobody without him! When he had realized he’d more or less screamed that at her, it only made him even angrier. His fine control slipping over her stupid Gryffindor sounding words. As always, she remained unaffected. She was not frightened of him and that only incensed him more because she
knew it was her fault too. He avoided her and she’d seen the cold look on his face the first time she’d turned to him before she was left at Privet Drive and the way he avoided her.
She was a bit of an older woman than the ones that typically caught his eye though she looked hardly any older than his wife; the only thing really giving even that was the slight crow’s feet and the faint smile lines on her face when she turned to him properly. The rest of her face seemed youthful, even the décolletage area exposed seemed that of a young woman. She was rather attractive and Lucius examined her in as swift and subtle a manner as possible before smiling as charmingly as he dared at the unfamiliar woman. He spied no rings on her ungloved fingers, not that such a thing had stopped his interests before. Her smile was agreeable as she turned as a sunflower might to the sun, given their difference in height. She was pleasantly petite.

“I- there weren’t as many photos to show them as any of us would have liked but there were- there were always the stories,” he croaked and she couldn’t look at him, she just couldn’t do it. “You- you left so much of your things and there were memories there too to show them,” he went on babbling desperately. “They’ve known you their whole lives,” he choked.
“If that’s a challenge, I’ll take it.” she answered, leaning forward a little to stare at him and he looked right back.

“We were also thinking it might make it a bit more comfortable if perhaps, he stayed with us in our room.”
“Yes Professor Umbridge.” she intoned quietly, gathering her things and moving and deftly dodging the shoulders meant to hit her or the legs out to trip her. She was nimble and deft and knew well how to avoid so much as touching anyone in the crowded halls. She'd sewn runes into her robes to help deflect the hexes and curses that would sometimes find her.
Ron snorted a little in his robe, hiding another snigger and Hermione shot him an annoyed look for it.
Draco didn’t know yet. She supposed he didn’t have to. If she kept it, she could distance herself appropriately and once it was born, send it to its father. She knew how much Lucius complained (in his own stuffy way) about having an heir by now. In fact, she might just send it to Lucius and Narcissa anyways. Draco was…Far from ready for fatherhood. She yanked her ring off mechanically. She would put it in the letter she would write; no, a note. In an envelope, but she couldn’t try to write out her feelings to him after…After a betrayal like this. She was sure she wasn’t fully grasping it yet. She wasn’t sobbing yet anyways.
“Looking for Betty. She’s a big black rabbit and she likes to escape the enclosure. She’s pregnant right now, so I want to get her back quickly.”
He might just be more sentimental, with he and Pearl expecting their own child now. They’d always wanted children- of that they’d made sure of when they’d first gotten serious. They’d always been soft for children.
And…That was it. She had no idea what happened after that. In her concentration, she almost missed the small sound of the doorknob opening. Almost, but she still caught it and her body froze for a moment. Petunia used harsh, fast raps and quiet shrilling to keep from waking her slumbering uncle and cousin (who honestly, probably wouldn’t have woken up even if she had really shrieked). Uncle Vernon, rare as it was that he was the one getting her, could be heard long before he reached the door which he would thump heavily once in warning, rumbling out ‘Girl’ and then moving along. Dudley, when he was younger, would just slam open her door whenever he felt like bothering her before all the locks, or when they weren’t all done up when she finally had a room and not just the cupboard. Even after he’d gotten better (as a person, she meant) he had still held onto barging in with no warning until he’d caught her in her knickers while she was changing. After that, it was his usual stampede, a ridiculously timid gentle knock and only after he received permission would he come in. He’d only once strummed up the courage to ask about her scars.

“If Ms. Potter be needings Malmsi again, Ms. Potter call for Malmsi and Malmsi will appear!” the elf told her sister.
educational.” she turned her body slightly, reaching to take Lucius’s wrist to check his watch and Narcissa bristled at how casual it was. “Pity. I was hoping all this time I spent blabbering would have had me here long enough that I could leave without seeming rude.” she sighed. “What other things are there to even do here to pass the time? This Ministry is so stuffy.” she complained next. “No real entertainment for the guests besides the band which is lovely, by the way, but this entire shebang is so dull.”
When she dreamed that night, the hands didn’t just caress her legs- they teased around her breasts, pressed long fingers into her rounded hips and she might swear someone else’s hair tickled at her neck.
That I watch the people around me all succumb, that I’m left without, that I have to carry on and for what? What’s the point of anything anymore? Humans,
“Oh yes, you’re doing wonderfully, dear.” came the gentle praise and Mimosa preened, ears twitching. They weren’t quite on top of her head but they were higher than her normal human ears would have been. They were rounded, a bit more oval and the tip rounded, and her nurse had been impressed with her when she’d first reverted to this form. It had happened soon after she had woken up as a cat.
She shook her head because to be entirely honest- she had missed him. He was the only one she saw in the last how long and suddenly having him gone without warning had sent her into a dark spiral of emotions she would never, ever talk about. If she would ever actually
The immediate room they climbed up to was wide and had a domed ceiling that showed a blue sky with fluffy white clouds in a picturesque way- his sister seemed just as fascinated with it. The furniture, Malmsi had explained beforehand, came from where they placed all of their unused furniture and he had itched to find out where. He had seen the same look on his dad.
“Dedication, hard work, fair play, patience, kindness, tolerance and loyalty.” Hermione immediately recited. “That does sound like a nice House to be in.” she smiled at the other girl, her overbite showing. “Their dorms are in the basement- Slytherin is in the dungeons and the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws have towers.”
“Why did that snake have two heads?” Jasper asked the elf. It was Jasmine that answered, speaking for the first time in his presence.
There was an entire separate section for healing and preemptive potions alone. Honestly, Harry wouldn't have thought that Slytherin would have been such a health nut but then again- self preservation. He was pretty serious about staying active as well, in one of his private journals he'd said Godric was getting quite the gut while he was there. In the strange, flowery terms used back in their day (she may have had to grab a translation book from the library).
would have needed a ritual or leave some sort of magical residue there even after so many years. What had protected you in that graveyard had not been your parents’ souls, much as they had given you some shelter. I needed your blood to even
“She’s prettier than you, Desdemona.” one of the girl’s sisters shot back to her. “If she would just let me do her up a little…”
“Third year, the one I had nothing to do with, and even then you are embroiled in danger. Never has there been a Dementor on the grounds of Hogwarts before then- the danger would have been far too much and over what? Sirius Black? Even if the allegations had been true, there had been worse murderers who haunted Hogwarts ground through history, and none of them necessitated soul sucking monsters that the Ministry still cannot control and who bring out the worst misery around young children whose magical cores are still developing. The trauma of the knowledge that a grown man, Pettigrew, had slept by your friend for years, that the one who facilitated your parents’ murder had been so close to you this entire time and that because Black had never been given a trial, a man who could have watched over you instead of those awful muggles had been driven to madness and had barely been able to live on the run as it is.”
Harry hummed, deftly folding the wrapping paper her gifts were wrapped in and delicately placing it in her trunk. She'd been able to sneak it up, a decoy locked in the cupboard that she used to call 'room'. Her cat, an extremely large and fluffy thing, a Norwegian Forest and Kneazle hybrid by the name of Midas watched her flippantly. After she'd sternly told him to stay away from her wrapping, the cat had been sulking on her cot watching her and pouting.
He murmured quiet little nothings as he moved closer, using both hands to hold her and brush away her tears as she cried and wailed, now latching onto him because he was
“I told her the dungeons weren’t exactly…A safe place but.” he shrugged helplessly. “I don’t think that I managed to convince her.”
“Does that mean you’ll try to outdo the other champions?” he asked and from the corner of his eye, watched his parents flinch at the reminder. She hummed and plopped herself in a pretty claw-foot chaise. He sat on a loveseat and their parents moved to a sofa.
“I need to tell her,” he said, more focus returning to him as he turned, looking ready to bolt to his sister’s rooms.
I was thinking of whether or not to add my cross-over documents into this work or create a separate one for that. I'm thinking maybe just add them to this one and add a Harry-centric tag? Because...You know, they're all Harry-centric. Also, uh, hi. I read the comments, but I'm awkward and so I don't end up responding. But it's really nice to see people interested in what I write and what they think about it. And again, if anyone reading these wants a crack at one of them they have full support to do so. If you wanna.
Primrose didn’t care. She had stopped trying to defend the woman’s actions to herself a long time ago.
learning!” she ranted then paused, reigning herself in. “Sorry, I just…Am very passionate about the education of youth and its affects on society. And Hogwarts is such a terrible strain on my stress levels! How is it still open?!” she took another breath, snagging two glasses of white wine as a floating platter passed by and downing one of them quickly before it, obligingly, disappeared. She kept the other to sip at more languidly through the night. “On another note, why are there no fax machines?”
“And the schooling before Hogwarts! Usually taught by parents or if there’s enough money, home tutors! It tips a completely uneven scale of things! There’s no primary school for these children and thus, their education levels range from illiterate who are barred from Hogwarts regardless of how bright or inherently powerful they are, to those who have already learned the basics of the first year classes and are being forced to slough through it all again!
“Probably that nasty muddy blood of hers.” one of the four Rosier girls in their year sniffed and Tom very, very kindly did not curse her. While his Inner Circle had accepted that there was no way Evans was a mudblood,
“What an aesthetic pair.” she said then, quite bluntly and Narcissa blinked a bit. Of course, the underlying thought was obviously of their respective coloring, both pale blondes of some height with pale eyes to match. Not many so plainly said it, even if it was a fairly quick conclusion to make when seeing her and her husband. “Although I don’t envy your complexions much.” she added on a bit mischievously.
She looked up at the only two people she could trust. Veronica- Ron, as she told her two only friends- and her tired blue eyes, solemn on her elegant oval face, freckles a splash against her otherwise pale skin. And Geneva, Nev for short with her blank vacant dark brown eyes on her round cherubic face. She breathed in deep.
She had scruffy black hair in two long twin braids and her robe was maybe a little bit too big for her. Her spectacles were of the current style, thin wired and round. She had a carrier case on her trunk and he could see a paw, huge and black, dip out of the grate. He had no doubts she would be a fellow Hogwarts student.
The fifth was…Not one she was ever particularly close to. She was surprised nonetheless that Andromeda was present in the same space as her sister, or with Ron and Hermione (neither of whom liked her particularly much for her decision to withhold her godson from her). Strict, rigidly in place and tinged in a constant sort of melancholy and regret.
“Mr. Malfoy! Lovely to see you well.” the woman he’d greeted returned with just as much jovial familiarity. Had it not been beneath her to do so in public, Narcissa would have raised her brows in surprise.
listen. Yet every year, without fail, it would somehow wind up that it was her and her friends who had to handle things that
down that requires a recall and reconstruction of near everything that would likely take decades if not centuries to correct because of how obstinate those old conservative types are but still. The potential is there. There have been, after all, many a celebrated Potioneer from Britain or occasionally a Dueler. And people like Dumbledore who come from less insulated backgrounds who rise up to go above and beyond what the school curriculum teaches children to become one of the most widely respected figures in the international community and managed to help find twelve unique ways to use dragon blood and even had the honor of working with famous alchemist Nicholas Flamel. You know some people think he’s harebrained? I’d certainly like them to try to accomplish what he has. Though I do believe that he is too heavily relied upon by the Ministry despite his more egalitarian and liberal views being disregarded. He is already the Headmaster of Hogwarts where even still, he holds not much power with the tight leash he’s given by the board of governors. You know, I also think people look up to him too much. Too much reliance and devotion for an act against a tyrant and not enough respect for his scholarly achievements tell me that this society cares less for education and more for violence and grand displays of power. It’s truly no wonder why Britain seems to have more Dark Lord problems than other first-world magical states.”
“Jasmine!” he called as he almost reached the top, panting as he watched his sister set down a saucer and look over. She had her glasses on instead of those muggle contacts; learning her eyesight was as bad as his and his dad’s was both funny and a little worrying. Learning how one put in these muggle contacts was also kind of worrying but she seemed well versed in it at any rate. Her eyeglasses were dainty rimless pince-nez types. But those weren’t thoughts for now.
“But what about the trust fund?” he knew about it because he was in it. They paid for everything school related. They might not be the best of things, but it was still more or less the best he could get at current.
his name was said with such a deep derision that he felt a flare of hatred for this girl. “Do you know what happens when your soul is splintered too many times? From too much of the darkest of arts with no rest period? One would go insane. Slowly losing their personality and devolving into madness. Why do you think there are such harsh restrictions on so much of Dark magic? Not because it’s all nefarious, because if someone decides they like the high they get from it, they might keep on using it without balancing it out with neutral or Light magic. And that will lead them to try to find new highs and they’ll stop caring about how it might hurt others. Like an addict. An
“The only real correlation between werecats and Felidae are their weakness to catmint and the like and their feline roots. Felidae, while they can indeed be extremely dangerous, retain their intellect even amongst their instincts. And they can control their transformations which brings us to our next subject. The three ‘forms’ researchers have claimed make up the Felidae. They can maintain a human visage but keep most of their Felid perks, which is their first form. The next, easiest form for them, a default state if you would, since all three forms are their natural forms and none of the three can really be called their true definitive form…Pardon, I’ve gone on a tangent again. Yes, their default form is something of a hybridization of their human and more feline forms. While this changes depending on subspecies, strength of the Felidae genes and ethnicity; in regards to their cat species of course, one certainly wouldn’t find a lion, say, in the Arctic. The most popular markers, the ones most noted upon for their appealing nature, tend to be feline ears and a lack of human ears or pointed ears with fur growing about it and the ability to swivel them. A tail. The ever loved cat like eyes, though with a reportedly better ability to pick up color and spectrums than either felines or humans, more akin to hawks and birds of prey actually. Though they’re more popular for their wide dilation and ‘slit’ pupil. Claws, either retractable or non-retractable based on species. Less noted are more feline like legs in the general shape. Occasionally a very fine layer of fur in the Felid’s more human skin tone. Sometimes a broader, flatter feline like nose is also reported. Again, this is mostly based on the recessive genes so it might be a little bit different for each Felid. The third is the entirely feline form, much like the animagus transformation actually and some Felidae hide beneath that umbrella category rather than being forced to admit to their Felid status, given the current political climate in Europe regarding Felidae and werecats.
“You wouldn’t want to be famous?” he asked. Because she will be soon now that they found her. He won’t be surprised when he and his family are on the covers again. They usually were every few months. Be it because of his Boy-Who-Lived status, his father’s achievements as Head Auror or one of his mother’s books.
available medical professional all throughout the year? How does she keep up with all the students and especially if they have special medical needs or conditions? When was the last time she was reevaluated or taken a refresher course to make sure her skills are up to date? And how could the staff be alright with how utterly overworked she must be?
Aside from all of their super vitamin potions, and the ones to build tolerance to poisons and venoms, they’d been kind of working out. Nev had some trouble but it wasn’t like they were going all out like she knew the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff Quidditch teams did. It was mostly broom riding (quite a workout for the thighs, abdomen and arms and a great way to instill a sense of balance).
“And he looks like a ghost!” the ginger added on. Poppy smiled a little bit, Neville quiet among them nervously before Eddie waved his farewell and they moved to Hagrid.
Hattie hummed, the tiny tot on her hip silent and watchful as she’d been since she’d taken her in. Getting that unpleasant family to sign over papers for a girl that seemingly didn’t exist wasn’t hard, and given that all they did was sign the papers and then toss a ragged looking blanket at her before slamming the door shut, Hattie had the unique pleasure of naming a child for the first time. H.J. Potter was on the blanket and the plaque by the door to the family had been Dursley. She didn’t very much resemble what she had seen of the family anyways, and Hattie wondered sometimes at why they had her precious girl at all. She hadn’t known the girl’s age either. But little Hellebore ‘Helle’ Julita had become hers in winter, changing the Potter for Hattie’s Heath.
“Remember there is still much that I haven’t been able to talk about and we’re, as with all magical species, learning new things about them. Either way, it’s important to remember still; they aren’t simply magic folk with a few kitty characteristics. They are an entirely different species with different physiologies to us despite being genetically compatible.”
They were all fairly mild, light shades of brown and cream, beds that Pearl transfigured because he was pants at transfiguring things. Helle was taking well to transfiguration and charms both. Then again, Helle just seemed to do absurdly well at everything she applied to.
. “Narcissa and I will be taking over most of the care. The…” his face scrunched for a moment before smoothing,
to stop that abuse. All because of something you had no control over, could have no control over and only in your second year of schooling. Oh, the students may have forgiven you, but have they ever really apologized for the cruel things they said to you? For the hexes and spells sent your way that the staff turned a blind eye to? And then trapped down in the Chamber with a shade of a boy, a young girl’s life in your young hands as though you should have had to do it all yourself? And your friend’s sister nonetheless against a centuries old beast who hungered after so long asleep. Why had it turned into a twelve year old having to save an eleven year old girl after months of dangerous petrifications? Why did you have to protect the stone, why did you have to be put in the direct line of danger two years in a row?
“We've got four feasible options. The potion, the spell, the ritual...Or death.” Harry said solemnly.
Tom had more than once and very politely asked the mudblood to stop, had even arranged a few accidental hexes whenever the stupid chit had her camera out. It did not deter the girl, not at all and Tom would have to do something drastic soon. Perhaps if he could finally find the Chamber…
She’d gotten so used to dealing with it on her own, and the visions had saved Mr. Weasley but no one would listen to her about the ones in the Ministry, just told her to ignore it and let the adults handle it but she had
a crybaby, Willa was too eager to chase around the boys and threaten them with cooties to play with. Carla was three years older and snubbed them all, Petey was a know-it-all Carla’s age, Gracie was too controlling and no fun at all, and Blake ate a dirt-pie because Cindy asked him too. Anyone else was a ‘teenager’ and wouldn’t be caught hanging around with them unless they were specifically put on babysitting duty.
“Of course, mother.” and she nodded absently, already totally absorbed in her work again. Sometimes he wondered if she’d been older, what it might have been like if she
“She’ll…She’ll be alright after this won’t she?” Dudley blurted out just as they were getting ready to leave after a few awkward greetings.
it does to the victim. I could have gone batshit insane Tom. My nerves could have become useless, I wouldn’t be able to feel parts of my body. I could have hit my head on the way down, cracked it wide open on the floor here.”
“That man?” he asked with perfectly feigned polite interest. He had very little real interest in her purpose here, only that she had presented herself at all.
“I do.” he heard his sister and looked forward again. “I like learning about them. I like seeing them even more.” she turned her head as she led them to a slim spiral staircase. “Is it true there are thestrals on the grounds?”
“Put her back on oatmeal and hot cereal for a few days. She should know better than trying to sneak treats at breakfast outside of holidays and birthdays. Lunch and dinner treats are one thing but not for the first meal of the day.”
She swatted such insecurities away. How dare this woman come here and insult their traditions and ways?
The apothecary held her interest a bit later and she may have gotten a bit zealous in her purchases of ingredients that she, frankly, didn't know the uses for yet. And- how could she ignore a
“I always find her.” she replied, peering around. That strange spell on her forehead didn’t itch anymore but her cloth headband covered the area anyways. Mostly in case anyone else wonders where her very distinct scar went.
“Now now, Ms. Mulberry, I’m sure Narcissa meant no harm by it.” Lucius sent his wife a subtle, narrow gaze for a moment. Mimosa gave him an amused look.
“Your fourth year…” his hand switched arms to caress at the scar Wormtail made on her. “While Crouch Jr. had been ingenious in his ability to put your name in, it would never have happened if the ones who spelled the goblet hadn’t cut sharp corners in their haste. Being blamed and accused of cheating to get into it, having the school turn their backs on you once again and even the friend who you thought you could truly rely on…And then to be still forced to compete and then slandered against as a minor, to have to have faced dangers meant originally for only those who were trained more clearly, for those who wanted to take the risk of severe injury for fame and fortune and glory to their schools. To have only been accepted when it was clear that there were very real dangers that you were being forced to go against when no one had believed you before. Traitorous children and adults who were eager to condemn you so quick to turn and try to swindle their way out of the horrid things they’d said and done against you. Only to be then forced into my father’s graveyard at the end, fight for your life after watching another’s taken.” he reached up to brush her tears away- they were blurring her vision now and she was breathing fast as she tried not to cry. She hated thinking about those times.
“Morning is usually when one would have breakfast, yes, Osmond.” Edsel tried to smother his amusement but failed by the dimples showing up as he tried not to smile. “Lunch is noon, supper is eight.”
of Fossegrim in one of the water rooms, I’m told they live in the deep ponds built into the building itself. There were also a good few Huldra though most of them were employees.”
“Well, I did but...Well, I think I could make it into Gryffindor.” she said strongly. “Bravery, nerve, chivalry, courage and daring.” she recited. Poppy's immediate thought was that she was a by-the-books sort. Ravenclaws were known bookworms but one of Ravenclaw's traits was originality, another being creativity. Poppy didn't want to say she knew this girl that well but...Well no matter. Certainly not like Poppy knew how to deduce who would be in what House or anything. “What about you Neville?”
“Well I was just wondering about what kinds of classes the other schools had and Dobby overheard me and well, he got Mipsy, whose got a cousin who works for the Confederation, to get these all for me.” she explained. “I didn’t expect all of this of course, but Dobby does like being quite grand.”
Still, it was good to know in case she collapsed suddenly; which has happened before. Her friends and godfather didn’t know the extent of how much the horcrux was affecting her and it was between her, Dumbledore and Mad Eye.
her fault. It hadn’t happened. Not after Quirrell had died, not after she had made it out of the Chamber shaky and barely walking despite the Phoenix tears, not after the Dementors forced her to hear her own mother begging for her life or when they were almost slaughtered by Moony, not after coming back from the graveyard or when she was saved from Crouch, and not after she came back dripping with blood because of writing on her hand. Never an adult, only her friends to cocoon her. She didn’t have parents to fuss over her, she didn’t have a family she could cry to or ask for help from, she couldn’t trust the adults around her as had been proven year after year.
“It had been a debate for some time on whether or not to intervene. As however, that the British Ministry had been at that point, almost entirely cut off from the Confederation for some time beforehand and had not renewed their treaties, they were not considered to be affiliated with us and thus we had no reason to intervene. It was only after the supposed demise of the Dark Lord of that civil war that this Ministry reached out to us to once again open communications with us. All this to say, your own self-enforced isolation from the rest of the magical world had rendered us unable to aid. And seeing that your Dark Lord of the times had not touched the rest of Europe we could do nothing about him.”
“Oh! Thank you, I suppose we'll try that next. I'm Hermione Granger.” she stuck out her hand and Poppy carefully moved her book from her lap to stand and take the offered hand.
I mean. If not squibs, or magically weak children it can result in insanity of some caliber, instability, unstable magical cores,
Eight months. Nine months. Ten months. She was beginning to think she would never leave. She pet Rusty absently as she waited for Lucius to come back. She didn’t notice at first. Not until she fell asleep and woke up twice and the need to use the loo was strong that Lucius still hadn’t come back. Terror roiled in her and she had to lean over the bed at least twice to vomit what was in her stomach and dry-heave, because she was dependent on him right now. She was almost dropping off again, the beginnings of hunger pangs making her more open to sleeping again when the door banged open and she almost wet herself as she jumped and Rusty hissed angrily.
“I thought you knew.” Poppy shrugged and Ron muttered under his breath, using the sleeve of his robe to scrub at his face. “But you probably shouldn’t make fun of him if you hadn’t met him yet.”
Harebell sat in the back of the room, at the darkest corner to avoid her classmates. Fifth Year had begun maybe two weeks ago and she'd noticed the newest DADA 'professor' had it out for her. She wasn't sure why- she stuck to the shadows and didn't speak up, her grades were all above average. She would ask the woman, but that would mean another detention for ‘sass’. Her fist clenched, hidden in her robes and bandaged. Harebell had thought maybe the woman wanted to make an example out of her, singling her out. Of course, she knew the woman also went after poor Nev.
Dementors were…Not the best thing for her to deal with. She found that out when Pettigrew escaped Azkaban somehow and Dementors were set loose on school grounds. All her worst memories…
Making her way onto Platforms 9¾ was interesting- but what was on the other side was more so. Seeing a bright, cherry red steam train gleaming and the platform packed with people- quite a number of those people in robes- made her smile widely.
and Lockhart might have killed her and Ron if it had been his own wand he was using or mushed their minds to nothing with his memory modifications, and there might have been a teenaged homicidal Tom Riddle running amuck in the world! Sirius Black and Buckbeak
But they were currently using many, many restraining charms and baubles and the like to keep it from surfacing, whatever it was. They didn’t tell her much besides that, given her condition. Or something.
He sat at a small desk, dressed neatly but certainly not in the quality that he was used to she could tell. He did not look uncomfortable in these garbs, he didn’t look angry, he wasn’t sneering, he really wasn’t even paying attention to her now. He was disturbingly human looking at the moment, reading the paper casually if not absentmindedly as he picked at his breakfast between articles. She had come to in this room, arms and hands chained and her ankles as well. They were of some high quality; they were charmed to ensure comfort but not mobility and she wondered where they’d gotten them if Malfoy was wearing those clothes and they were here in this quaint looking little room together. She had been alone when she had first woken up. Alone and partially laying in the bed she was in now with its soft diamond quilted pattern in dark blue, the cushy pillows and the heavy curtains drawn back. She was not hurt, not scraped, bruised or even aching.
“You’re a private person?” their mum asked with a frown. She tilted her head as she thought about it. And then Malmsi suddenly appeared.
“All of those things are true, I suppose, but not the main reason.” Riddle told her musingly, his hold on her chin gentling and then slipping down to brush across her exposed collarbone and slide down her arm. Gooseflesh came up in the wake and she stared at him. How did he- “You think so loudly, poppet.” he chuckled, red eyes gleaming. “And you’re so expressive.” his eyes did that pleasant little crinkle thing again. “You’ve had direct contact with my diary.” he said suddenly. “In your second year.”
“I insist the pleasure is mine.” since offering the usage of his given name was too forward for his tastes, and they were in a professional setting notwithstanding. “Perhaps I can persuade Cornelius out? It is almost noon and he prefers to take his lunch outside the Ministry. If, perhaps, it is suitable.”
“The wards are updated and refreshed during the roughly three month period the students are absent, as well as extra maintenance.” she said after a moment. “Which is to say, it’s not safe in the least and could warp a student’s magical core if they were indeed to try and stay in the castle during that time.”
Lucius was in a mood today, it was in the tense lines of his shoulders and back. It took him a little longer to complete his usual disrobing and when he pulled his hair free, he didn’t bother putting it up again before slumping into his chair, elbows on his knees and rubbing at his jaw in agitation. She’d never seen him look quite so inelegant and disheveled since the capture. It has been, what Harry figures must be, a good five months since her capture. She was beginning to think her friends weren’t going to find her but still valiantly pushed the thoughts away.
Nev and her had become friends their Second Year, after a group of older Slytherins were maliciously taunting the pudgy girl and had hexed her badly. After they'd left, Harebell had slunk out from where she'd been hiding to undo them for the crying Hufflepuff. At first, Nev didn't trust her- another Slytherin. After the second and third time she'd helped her though, they'd begun to talk rather than her just running away from the black-haired girl. Of course, they only spoke when they were alone and hidden away or after curfew.
She might have gotten into Ravenclaw but the Hat had wanted Slytherin. Besides, Mimoza has always been a little…Over worried, she decided, of being scrutinized like her sister was. Oh, Marigold liked the attention just fine and she never had anything to hide so it worked for her just fine but Mimoza was different. She winced for a moment, thinking that. She’d never
To be entirely honest, she was still a little bit jealous of Ginny, who was shorter than Ron’s lanky height, too tall for a girl, who already had breasts the same size as Ron’s own, whose waist was a bit smaller, making her feminine frame easier to notice. She was a little jealous of her two friends as well. Nev was plush, with pleasantly plump breasts and lovely hips and a sweet round face and looked so soft and feminine. It reminded Ron, honestly, a little of her mother. And then there was petite Harry. She was small, could probably easily be carried around but she was mostly leg and her arse was phenomenal. She had such a tiny waist as well, thanks to her smaller ribcage and shapely hips even if she didn’t have much in the way of cleavage.
. The isolation, the bullying, bad treatment she did nothing to deserve, that she knew she did nothing to deserve, the knowledge that at any moment they could turn on her like in Second, like in Fourth, like they continued to do in Fifth. All when she was just trying so hard to keep things together, to keep people safe-
Harry nodded against Ron's shoulder, petting Nev's dirty-blonde locks. “Sounds like a plan.” without the other two, her life had been even more stressful and she'd been getting clumsy. She'd even contemplated just killing herself, drinking poison from one of Snape's private stores of potion ingredients. She was sure she could manage to get into them and be dead by the time Snape even realized someone had been snooping around. Her life became nothing without them there. Sirius was a distant presence, uncomfortable with her House and mostly focused solely on finding Pettigrew. Like he’d always been, putting his revenge first. She didn’t even really blame him that much- he was one of her father’s best friends, practically his
“You can’t leave the room without me and only to our meadow.” Lucius was saying but she was just marveling over seeing her arms so clearly. They were paler where the cuffs had been naturally but it was such a contrast. Her wrists, she noticed then, were a little plumper than she remembered them ever being. She pressed her hands against her body, feeling the pleasant bit of squishy softness. She wasn’t chubby, but she felt like maybe she wasn’t quite as scrawny. She wouldn’t entirely know, since there were no mirrors she’d seen thus far. She didn’t entirely mind but it bothered her sometimes, when she let herself think about such a trivial thing as compared to trying to get back to her friends. If they even thought she was still alive. No, but the Weasley clock would let them know she was alive wouldn’t it? “It won’t shock you, but it will immediately bring you back to this room and keep you here if you try to escape.”
It was beyond concerning of course, and there would likely be a sweep or two quietly happening while she tried to talk sense into these stubborn prats.
When she woke, it was to English. She’d been in either South America or throughout Africa the past seven years and any medical facility she cleared for her care were not ones that used English for their main language. She sat up after assuring that it was voices through the walls her enhanced ears were hearing and peered around. She frowned. The door was opening and she had a wand in her hand and was halfway across the room, slightly crouched to use the bed and the bedside table as cover or as obstructions if she needed. The man, clearly a Mediwizard, stared for a moment but was quickly pushed aside as two children sped past and directly towards her.
“Do your best, you’ll get through it. And we can…We can go to the cinema or something when you get back yeah?” he offered a wobbly smile and she smiled back, patting his muscular back.
Oliver, Osmond and Theodore had never been to his and Pearl’s home. Mostly because he lived in a mostly muggle area, with only a handful of squibs in the community here. Partly because his uncles disdained Pearl’s Muggleborn status but wouldn’t actually say it for fear of grandfather’s wrath. Grandfather didn’t have much care about blood no matter what crowd he tended to, but more about power.
“Oh yes, everything is fine. I don't get into trouble or anything, she's just a bit...Harsh is all.” she waved off, hoping the older girl would just bugger off. Feeling compelled to be nice no matter what as a Hufflepuff with no other
to make them stand out. Ron had nothing. Perhaps if she'd been the only daughter, she might've been treated a little better. Perhaps she'd get new robes like Ginny did or her own wand like her sister.
Yes, their room. She didn’t know where he slept, since she always fell asleep before him and woke up after him but was sure it wasn’t on the bed. Her bed. Hers because everything else was
The smash of some glass bauble against a stone wall. Tom was angry. No, he was utterly furious because Evans, the girl he’d known since
“Like we handle all of the Dark Lords or Ladies, or nonbinary Dark Folk our affiliated states come to us about. We exterminate them and set up relief programs to victims and take over the reconstruction of a governmental body which we carefully monitor until such a time we believe them stable and educated enough to move on without immediate, constant supervision.” she answered bluntly. “Unlike a traditional governing system, we have dealt with international Dark Lord upstarts, Dark Lords that have had reign over states for decades or centuries, Dark Lords with unique magics, Dark Lords with presumed immortality or amortal Dark Lords, almost anything and everything. We have dealt with what you call Beings and Creatures uprisings, cullings, armies of cults which are almost always under a Dark Lord and all sorts of other hasty, violent shenanigans. Including muggle or squib terror cells against certain groups of magicals. It is well within our range to dismantle and oversee the extermination of Dark Lords and the like.”
“Help prepare? Don’t you have elves?” Theodore spoke up nervously. He’d been looking around their modest sitting room, the only room that had a fireplace connected to the Floo network in blatant interest.
As the next few weeks passed they spent more time on something new- spells written down in an old potions book Harry had taken and helpful hints that Harry quickly used to her advantage. She was always proficient with Potions (in an effort to avoid unnecessary wrath from her Head of House) but now with Slughorn praising her at every turn for both her title and potions prowess and her new helpful hints she was being targeted by her Housemates a bit more. She couldn't bring herself to care, easily evading anything they tried to do to her. And if they were trying to do anything to her bed, she wouldn't know because she had the elves move all of her things down to the Chamber and hadn't entered her dorm once so far this year, the decoy trunk sitting idle. She showered, or actually bathed in the Prefect's room.
Or maybe it was a punishment. She gets forcibly attached to her caretaker, she had heard Hermione talk about things like that before, then they leave her and start the process all over again. It’d been a year and a half with him and already she was panicked at the thought she might not see him everyday.
just stupid worthless muggles. A plate was settled in front of him and he was broken from his reverie.
“Oh, you’re just being contrary!” Marigold scoffed, scowling now. Mimoza rolled her eyes and got up, collecting her things. Whenever her sister got into these moods, it was best to just leave. She, like their mother, tended to get stuck on an opinion and refused anything that pointed otherwise. “Where are you going?”
“The Board of Governors is supposed to be anonymous.” Hermione explained patiently. “But I guess for some it’s an open secret…”
The next few days passed peacefully; the week had been pleasantly calm in comparison to some of the times. When Dumbledore came dressed in bright yellow slacks and a paisley yellow and purple button down to collect her, sleek white hair braided extravagantly the Dursleys didn’t even look offended.
She stared at the little ring on her equally little hand. This was new. But preferred, since the cuffs were all gone.
She relaxed subtly, smoothing her breathing soft and slow to mimic sleep. She had always been good at feigning sleep when the occasion arose.
of an overbite. “They’ll be just another person being persecuted for crimes committed.” her head cocked to the side. “Please remember that I only need adhere to the laws and policies of the Confederation and my obeying any here is out of courtesy. Please also remember that if the Ministry acts in a way I believe is cause for intervention that a full investigation can be enacted. As it is, I’m still assessing the level of corruption which has already gotten to the point that I can indeed, call in an investigation.”
“Madam Mulberry, the young lady would like an approximate of your arrival.” a slow, cultured man’s voice answered her.
Instead, she had been furious and especially horrified when she realized they had changed her clothing into some sort of flowy sleep garment and that she didn’t wear unders under them. She had also been rendered mute- she was sure it wasn’t a permanent curse though since Malfoy had allowed her to speak once. Of course, all she did was snarl and curse and spit out insults and promises so that was short lived.
“The Minister of course.” she waved off flippantly. “Cornelius has been very…Ah, incompetent seems a tad harsh but it was the word used when I was sent to confront him. Oh, pardon me! I’ll be Mimosa Mulberry.”

“I-I…” she glanced down at Helle with a confused frown. “Yes, my husband and I…Sorry, pleased to make your acquaintance. Pearl Wright. My husband Edsel is looking at the house on the land.” she offered her hand and the women shook.

“Because he was afraid of losing his genius intellect, of it all going to waste. And losing one’s mind is a kind of death too, but he wasn’t scared of it like Morty.” she answered just as fiercely. “A bit of time and effort for access to unimaginable information about another self and their world,
Narcissa didn’t know what a pishacha was but she assumed it was some sort of substitute for House Elves.
She hummed, swinging her legs back and forth as she read the large book set up on her lap. Her cousin and his aunt trembled where they sat in the room, Dudley still crying. Of course- losing both Vernon and Petunia must have been a huge shock to the two of them. She glanced at them idly before returning her attention to the much more fascinating book. It would take a few days before Aunt Marge would explode on her about her nonchalant attitude to their deaths and to raise her hand to the small girl. It would take another few days for the woman to wake up- the doctors had said she'd collapsed from grief and exhaustion but she knew better- she knew better, she did!
knowledgeable, you should come to the Confederation Headquarters sometime. Some of them make me look like a schoolchild in comparison.” she waved off casually. “You should see it when one of the residential geniuses gets it into their heads to put together trivia-bingo. Competitive
Geneva smiled politely at her Housemates. They treated her as a clumsy, weak bumbling girl. A hopeless girl, no matter how good their intentions. Incompetent. The same things her grandmother thought. She saw the way her grandmother looked at her, felt it in the way she treated her. When lunch rolled around, she spared a glance for her only friends, the only ones she could really talk to. The others didn't take her seriously. Harry was small and hunched over and Nev saw the way she sneakily checked her food for tampering and spells and potions. Ron was eating as much as she usually did, nobody paying much attention except to look at her in disgust or astonishment.
The girls went back into their frenzy of studying the rest of the Slytherin texts. The rest of their fifth year was mottled with avoiding others and sneaking away, distancing themselves
She left the girl to her own devices then, too afraid to speak to her directly and did her best to shelter the two children whilst mourning for her sweet darling brother.
She kicked her feet, almost eleven now. She was currently helping her cousin with a summer assignment- they got along rather well, considering how terrified Aunt Marge was of her and how often she tried to keep the two of them separate. But without his parents' toxic influence Dudley was
“In your eyes and the eyes of the sort of people following you. I don’t like your ideology, don’t like your followers, don’t like the self destructive path you’ve chosen or the twisted way you’re thinking of immortality. Do you think I enjoy this Tom? Do you think I like knowing that whenever someone murders me, whenever I’ve tried to kill myself I
“Not at all! You are delightful company, Lucius, and my little cherub would benefit from a good day of fun.” she beamed at him and again, watched him smile in return. “Here,” she snapped her fingers again, this time a more standard, vague copy of her schedules compete with small notes on days she can take off if need be. “This is my current schedule and those with a red slash on the date are days I can skive because really I’m only needed to sit and look pretty. I can just as well set a recording device there and have all the same information. Better to do that, actually, that way they won’t feel the need to filter themselves.”
“If Ms. Potter be touching both snakey faces at same time, Ms. Potter be opening door!” Malmsi explained cheerfully. He watched Jasmine step closer, then go up on her tip toes. She couldn’t reach so she instead physically climbed on the dais the statue was on and again went on the tips of her toes to touch both. She easily slipped back when the statue moved to reveal a small and slim corridor.
, Narcissa was trim and did not possess such abundant curvature. Besides that, Narcissa had pale, faint coloring from her Rosier mother, and Ms. Mulberry was dark haired, bright-eyed and had a bit of a sun-loved, wheatish look not often found in the lighter complexioned Pureblooded folk of the magical Isles. “Narcissa, this is Mimosa Mulberry.” her husband presented the woman to her as though she were something he particularly prized. This incited some small mount of respect for the woman to have wrapped the cold man she knew as a husband so firmly around her little finger.

“Yes yes, don’t let my looks fool you. I was chosen for my expertise in troubled and warring states, usually civil wars and the like, which, according to those who have come before me, is what the English Ministry and its people are suffering from.”
“Chess is much more difficult than Draughts.” she frowned. “Draughts is nice and easy. And competitive.” she added as an afterthought.
“Skittish is a bad word for this I feel.” Edsel ran a hand through golden brown hair, mussing it out of the hair-tie he had it in.
“Nah, who'd want our Veronikins?” one twin snorted and she felt deep boiling anger, flaring hurt searing just beneath it and fueling it on.
“...Yes?” he answered hesitantly, wondering why a few of his friends stared at him. Seamus was the one who broke the silence and it was with gut-jiggling laughter.
And they’d all been told beforehand that she would be getting what amounted to a surgery soon to fix her declining health. She had overheard her aunt muttering things about possible magical tumors to her uncle.
That was a fair statement to make, Narcissa agreed. Lucius, she and Draco had to use a fair amount when planning to be outdoors for any real length of time. While Ms. Mulberry seemed like she could simply lay out in any tropical climate entirely nude and turn a golden bronze hue to her light brown skin. She briefly wondered if that was something the small woman actually did or not.
In some reptilian part of his brain, he realized he was panicking. He clumsily gathered her in his arms, spreading her on the bed after stumbling up and over to it, a cold sweat breaking out. For a few moments, he felt like he suddenly couldn’t hear anything but then he realized that he could hear something and that was the rush of his own blood and the hammering of his heartbeat as he stared at the corpse-
Dumbledore and her have been exchanging letters so far in the summer, it already being close to the end of July. Sometimes the subjects were perfectly light and fine, but some were of more secretive things.
“Ignore them both!” another chimed in. “I’m Parvati Patil. Don’t trust any of these Gryffindor boys. Date outside your house, that’s what I say!”
Which left Edsel and Pearl to babysit a fifteen year old, a thirteen year old and the current heir apparent to the Nott family, an eight year old. None of whom had ever been much exposed to muggles. Were probably told terrible things about them, given how his uncles were.
“No. We do everything ourselves. Whether by wand or hand.” Pearl absolutely beamed. “But usually by hand.”
“Yeah and you guys should really look them over! Hogwarts feels so behind in comparison and look at this! Comprehensive muggle studies and studies not solely pertaining to magic! Guess what else, guess what else? No, I’ll just tell you anyways- I got a few studies, all put together in a book, from the International Confederation about how international premier schools stack up and guess where Hogwarts is? Near the bottom! The bottom! Some criticisms include our snore of History, our exclusion of more varied magical classes and non-magical classes, not having a physical fitness class or clubs besides Quidditch, not even a muggle sports club, our food, our portions of food, our all-at-once dining, our Hospital Wing and injury rate and oh, the list just goes on! There are entire pages dedicated to our unstable D.A.D.A education!” she laughed as though this were exhilarating news.
is. Or a bomb, grenade, or a missile or most any other muggle weapons on sight besides things like swords and bows and arrows! Anyone with a basic understanding of muggle weaponry could come here and entirely wipe out the Ministry and the land it stands on since no one would think to stop them because they’d have no clue what they were even looking at! A student could waltz into Hogwarts unfettered with an entire muggle armory and no one besides probably muggleborns or raised would know to get out or hide!”
As if she could talk about her problems to the popular older Hufflepuff. About her Grandmother's constant down putting. About dealing with pitying glances and whispers of 'practically a squib'. About her parents being alive, but might as well have been dead. About what her Uncle and his wife did when she was especially young almost killing her numerous times, how they were never punished like they
“Is my sweet little darling giving you trouble again, Mr. Bodhi?” the woman asked him with a grin. “You can tell the cherub-faced menace I’ll be back in two days to see her.”
“Don’t worry about those, there’s no procedure to stop them from doing that. I’m sorry it woke you, you still need your rest.” she could barely hear his comforting words over the blaring noises. “Would you like a stronger sedative?”

Mimosa Potter was at her aunt’s place as always. And, as had become custom, would be picked up sometime through the summer. She still didn’t understand why she couldn’t have stayed at Grimmauld Place, even if Sirius was in St. Mungo’s. She winced at the thought and memory of how he ended up there. On the brighter side, Voldemort had fallen (she may have shoved him but really, who was watching in all the commotion anyways) into the Veil. It had almost been Sirius going through that Veil and she shuddered again. Better still, Sirius finally got a real and proper trial after much fuss was kicked up by her, Dumbledore and a few choice others who were made aware that Sirius had no trial for his imprisonment. This trial wasn’t happening yet, as he’d had to go straight to St. Mungo’s over some grievous wounds from the crazy fucking cunt Bellatrix.
His arms rose up and his eyes were so clouded that it looked like he’d been cursed. She wanted to Apparate out immediately- she wasn’t prepared for this, she didn’t want to be here, how did she get here-
Maybe he was manipulating her- he was almost certainly doing it. Right now, she was just grateful to have someone to hold onto her, someone solid and real, telling her that it wasn’t her fault, that it shouldn’t have been on her shoulders to begin with, that it was alright to cry and be unhappy with how she’s been treated. After the lonely summer, after years of her and her friends being left to their own devices to keep them and the people around them safe and the horrible, horrible feeling of abandonment that her friends, the ones who’d been with her for years were listening to adults who had left them on their own in the first place. The horrible feelings of guilt, of fault and self-loathing that Sirius was more or less in a coma because of her and that even that was lucky because he almost slipped away into the Veil, that Remus blamed her just as much, that Cedric was dead because she had wanted to be
flying,” she answered immediately, her pale eyes sharpening. Their dad grinned broadly, dimples appearing. Lily only gave a slightly exasperated but mostly soft look. She shook her head then, pushing the braid she kept her long red hair in over her shoulder.
“I’m accustomed to standing out sir.” and a wry smile, crooked, adorned her face. It made a solitary dimple appear.
“There is nothing to be done about Ms. Potter’s participation.” Dumbledore spoke before anyone could pipe in. “The tests have already been concluded. She is bound to compete or lose her magic, and it has been established that she does not wish to lose her magic.” he said with a pointed look after Karkaroff shifted to say something. The man grumbled.
Didn’t much matter now of course. She couldn’t…Stay with him, knowing that he had bedded another woman. That he’d been doing it for who knows how long. And she couldn’t stand the humiliating pity she would receive or the ‘told you so’ or ‘knew it’ that would come. Those would be the nicer ones. She’d been offered, a few times over the years, another position. She was,
“The conscious and unconscious mind and magical cores are all very different aspects of our checks, Mrs. Granger-Krum. Please keep a respectable distance for the time.”
(He’s grown attached to her through the few years he’d known her, but she really was a little bit creepy sometimes, with those empty eyes.)
Harry burst in anger, throwing her arms up. “That we change from who we are now, because who are now is
“O-oh…Eh-hem, yes well…” Petunia trailed off awkwardly, trying to appear disdainful and nonchalant. “And this…Address?”
is avoiding me again.” her perfectly beauteous tone was only slightly changed when she emphasized the ‘that man’ bit and he wondered who she might mean that she would need pester the Minister’s secretary about it.
No! No, she wasn’t dead, he just- he just needed to rouse her. Needed to wake her. How would he- how did he go about it?
“Oh?” he slid his gaze to the man at the desk who seemed relieved to have her attentions off of him for the moment but winced at his reproachful look. “Perhaps I can prove to be of some assistance?”
cauldron? There was just no way she could. Even if it'll simply sit in her room gleaming and bright while she's in school, she
Once she was cleared to go, she would be leaving again. And this time, she thought darkly, they would never see her again and she would never have to see them. Her magical core purred at the thought of not being subject to these strange and terrible feelings being back here brought up. Of not being too near these delicate little blossoms of magical cores, of not being near the self-antagonistic ball of a core that pleaded to her own. Of being out again, destroying enemies, trickling seductively to sway targets and payloads, to reach and spread until nothing was left untouched by her insatiably needy, possessive magic. People and things under her protection, cults dedicated to her existence quietly enough that the Unspeakables didn’t interfere. Complete unwavering devotion at a comfortable distance.
“Guys, this is my…Sister, Jasmine.” he was happy he only hesitated for a moment before introducing her. “Jasmine, these are my friends.” he gestured toward them to get them to start introducing themselves.
Tom thought about that for a moment with a frown. Well, he supposed it might make sense but if she were wealthy she wouldn’t have to worry about it running out anytime soon right?
The envelope was kept pristine, no matter what kind of episodes he exposed it to. He was careful to preserve it. Careful to preserve the short little note that she’d had to write him. Her ring rested on a chain so heavily charmed that if he tried to go anywhere with magical detection charms, he was sure they would go haywire but he wanted to take no chances with his wife’s-…
But she was soundly woken when alarms starting flaring. Her nurse continued what it was he was doing, snatching little baubles from where they floated above her and casually just crushing them in his hands like they were just pretty orbs made of paper. He noticed her awake again, albeit groggily and he smiled again, kind and warm she was able to see.
one of the old stone statues cracked dangerously and all three girls looked over quickly. Harry was breathing heavy and she took a deep breath, trying to calm down. She still tended to have outbursts when she got too worked up, though there wasn’t much she cared about enough
“You know, you could always come back to the Sector. They’ll give you a little specialty pass and if you wanted, while the children are busy playing, you can have a tour of the place.”
“Thinking about harming other people isn’t calming down Tom. And if you keep making that face, it’ll stick that way.”
Pearl brought him back to focus with a firm pat on the shoulder. “I’m gonna check one more round around the house.” she told him. Mostly so he would have to stay in the room with Helle. The last time they left her alone in their house, she had somehow gotten half their coop in. Within ten minutes. The point being, if he went to check over one last time, he would begin to obsess over small details. The permit for the magical expansion inside was pricey but not one he was willing to do without. Who knows how the boys would revolt if they had to share their one guest room for the whole of a week. No, instead there were three moderate sized rooms added on the main floor. It, being careful of the muggles, was only expanded on the inside using wizarding space so as not to alarm his neighbors. At least now when they left Pearl would have an actual metal working room. And he could have a dedicated potions room.
to be their poster boy for supremacist purism.” she sighed again and that look, that fucking look like he’d done something that she wasn’t
Once more they were interrupted, just as Hermione Granger looked to be firing up an enthusiastic discussion on the charms affecting Hogwarts. A freckled red-haired boy blinked at them, looked at their books and made a face.
“Really? I’ve never seen them.” he frowned. “Are they invisible?” and his parents smiled at him warmly. He wondered what he did to get that fond soft look.
“That would mess with the tournament and the Ministry still has to flesh out some stuff about her,” Jasper chimed in, filling his sister’s plate again once he saw it empty.
“Nope,” she managed, “Food can’t make me sick, got a stomach of steel,” she told them bluntly before going back to the demolition of any food stuffs on her plate.
“I thought you might enjoy a bit of variation to our usual days.” she barely heard Lucius say. That they had usual days at all was a punch to the gut but she could barely feel it, too entranced with the breeze and then the feeling of soft grass between her toes when Lucius gently helped her step down and into the meadow proper. They were both barefoot and she stared at her feet, then at what she could see of her legs. She wasn’t pale like Lucius, not the blinding white when she glanced at his toes but she was certainly not used to being this pale. Her skin took to the sun and the sun took to her, usually giving her a dusky sun-kissed glow. This dulling of her skin wasn’t the only difference to her body since she’d been taken. Even though it’d not been that long, she was gaining a bit of weight to her scrawny skinny body and the oils and shampoos in her and Lucius’ bathroom had made her hair seem much softer and manageable. He’d also cut the locks two days in so they only just brushed against her jaw. She didn’t mind as much as she’d nonverbally insisted she did; she’d been meaning to chop it off and likely she would have butchered it.
, came from muggles. You know, the muggles have had a fax machine for a good century now. Telephones for another hundred and some years. Yet the closest thing that the British Ministry and the majority of its occupants seem to have are two-way objects that, frankly, are a rare commodity as it is and as I’ve heard, are only made by one or two families for a ridiculous commission price. Or the WNN which is either radio shows thereabouts or a Ministry news station. It’s no wonder, I suppose, that near nothing constructive seems to get done when people are sending out owls and using charms to send everything in paper airplanes or origami folds.” she rolled her eyes. “I went to a little café just the other day here and asked for a cappuccino. Boy had no clue what it was, and neither did the shift manager. A
“I think he’s the only one who does all my wash actually, since he’s more or less adopted me as his witch. Pretty sure he’s also the one that got me those fancy bathing oils and those scar-fading pastes for my birthday since I know he heard me talk about wanting to take better care of my skin. You know I hadn’t even known scar-fading pastes even existed? I think I’m going to start researching some health and beauty and cosmetic spells and rituals and potions and all next. I think we deserve to pamper ourselves a little.”
“My niece at least, has gotten to the point of ‘we can share but you can’t keep it and I can take it back whenever’. Honestly I’m more concerned about the over confident ‘I know everything’ stage. I hear it happens around ages eight to ten the most. As a fairly mature woman myself, I’ve learnt long ago that there is always something I don’t know, and that there’s always room for improvement and honestly, nothing nags me more than a snotty know-it-all.”
Tom had never heard her like this, her words felt like they were coated in nothing but venomous hatred, nothing but intense, icy coldness that made him feel like he might be sick. She was over him, radiating some sort of presence that was making him feel small, vulnerable and Tom hated it.
“There's nothing we can do.” Nev said quietly as Harry flexed her hand. Ron's fist slammed against the stone wall, making both look to her.
hat flopped down over her eyes, he waited. The previous students only took a few moments but soon enough he found this was not the case with Evans. He began keeping track of the time she took and had gotten to four entire minutes (ignoring the murmuring that had begun) before the hat finally called out.
and a Ministry official with quite a lot of power to swing around had deliberately set one of them in not just a muggle neighborhood, but the very one that the disgraced Girl-Who-Lived was shucked away to.”
, Ron? Most of our Wizarding Community is considered largely uneducated to the standards of other nations! And we, well we have all of this!” she threw her hands out at the Chamber at large “And now, even the things the other, better schools are learning as well! Do you know that Uagadou, the very largest of all the schools, their students excel so much in advanced self-transfiguration that they can change their forms entirely? Most can find their animagus forms pretty quickly into schooling as well! And, most of them learn to use their magic without wands, only through pointing and hand gestures! Not to mention their alchemy classes and astronomy classes!” she was practically vibrating in excitement at this point. “Castelobruxo students are known for their advanced Herbology and Magizoology! They have an exchange program too, for European schools-”
Some of the potions Ron had slipped into her siblings things or sent in candies back to her parents or brothers and her sister. Protective potions or strengthening potions to be taken on a fairly regular basis. They took those potions too of course- they were slightly arcane but extremely effective-

As a margay. Not kidding, she woke up with paws, no opposable thumbs and a contentness in the way she stretched. It was…An incredibly natural feeling. There was no odd feeling, so she didn’t even really comprehend that she had woken up differently at first. When she did realize, she may have flipped out a little bit and bitten her nurse’s hand but he took it all in stride and worked to calm her down. She’d already smeared her scent all over the room (and him actually), and was getting agitated at the small territory in a way but she could cope with it for now. The cot at least already smelled like her.
The diary with the soul in it wasn’t mentioned. Instead, Marigold had apparently found out the cause of the petrifications and ran to stop it because it had stolen Mimoza. Marigold then managed to find out where the Chamber was and fought and slayed the Basilisk after it attacked Mimoza.
“Malmsi not be called, but Malmsi wondered if Ms. Potter and Ms. Potter’s family are wanting refreshments?”
“And what about regular assessments? Oh wait, that doesn’t happen! The homework is usually too long and time-consuming for pupils to spend any amount of free time doing anything but and half the time the assignments are irrelevant to the subject altogether!
“Follow me.” she said in curt response, beginning to push her trolley along and he quickly followed.
territory. Jasper resolved to warn her away from that sketchy area during lunch. His general intent must have shown on his face because Diggory smiled at him sheepishly.
She kept her eyes closed, hands idly petting over the children in a repetitive self-soothing. As long as she didn’t think about it too much, it was fine.
“I can see them just fine.” she said and he paused as the implications slid into his mind. He wanted to ask who she’d seen die in morbid curiosity but couldn’t bring himself to because he was more than a little afraid of the answer. Then they were going up the stairs.
“Yes, but we need not worry of tan lines.” she said thoughtfully. Ms. Mulberry huffed, a small smile on her face.
“This will be the first time Draco will be interacting with a child his age that hasn’t been selected by his mother.” Lucius mused and Mimosa’s eyebrows rose up. He noticed her look and hummed quietly. “Her regular luncheon with other women of standing tend to see our children all grouped together.” he explained.
When he opened the door, he stared at his parents. He hadn’t shaved. Or showered. Or cleaned. Or really, bothered with anything. Not since…

“You should feel honored,” Lestrange sniggered meanly, “She stopped eating for a moment to answer.” he said to the surprised blond. Tom could somewhat imagine it because frankly he hadn’t thought his comment warranted an answer. Or even if it did, that she would give one.
“Look at that, not even two hours and I've already made three friends.” she said, pleased with herself.
She was in lilac colored coveralls and her long sleeved shirt was gray. A cloth headband kept her curls out of her face.
“Speaking of the needs of children, their meals are entirely outlandish and they have no classes that talk about health and biology! You know I’ve met some people that didn’t even know what an appendix was or that they had one? Preposterous!

He had known about you, had put you with the muggles and never returned to check on you and when you tried to voice your abuse, the neglect and pain you suffered at their hands was dismissed. You had killed a man your first year, a damned man, but killed him nonetheless after being drawn into something that you, as a first year student, should never have been a part of. Your second year came the Chamber and you were shunned and mocked by all, and the professors meant to help you and protect you did
Sometimes there were snatches of what she was sure was talking but she always tuned out pretty quickly.
So Helle, altogether, didn’t think she’d much get along with Edsel’s cousins. Especially with how Pearl and Edsel talk about them or their dads.

“But were another war to break out, and another Dark Lord should take over the Ministry and thus, the magical communities of Britain, how would the Confederation stop it?”
She sighed, murmuring in her sleep and shifting at the admittedly nice feeling of hands stroking up her legs. She had missed the feeling of large hands, missed intimate attentions. Not that she ever had much time or many suitors she had entertained though this was not so much by choice as much by circumstance. She feel into deeper sleep soon after, not realizing that those hands had been very real.
“If you keep making faces, they’ll stick that way.” she told him before going back to her papers. He sneered a little as he sat up a bit.
“It was called the Chamber of Secrets for a reason. Slytherin was a mad man but he was a genius. The spells and rituals he created are...They defy everything we know about magic. He theorized that magic had no real 'rules', that it was only constricted by what the user thought of it. That's why he was so good at wandless, silent magic, why he was so powerful.”
“Oh no no, my dear. I wasn’t planning on making another one when I went to vanquish you. I suppose my soul, or my magic had become so accustomed that a sliver just latched onto you once my physical body was destroyed. Or perhaps it was a survival method.” he mused aloud to her. His hand lingered, wrapped lightly around her thin wrist. His thumb stroked in a small circle she wasn’t sure he was aware of. He was unsettlingly warm now, instead of the room temperature he’d felt when he first touched her. “But the diary. That particular piece had only recently found its way back to me. It had been wandering between the planes for a few years in between. Pure chance that I had managed to call it back.” he told her. “I will admit it had left me…Bed-ridden. While of course Lord Voldemort had far more time, power and knowledge than the sixteen year old Tom, Lord Voldemort had also been so fractured he had gone mad. And, Tom had the benefit of having half of an entire soul. In the end of course, they managed to meld together. It didn’t end there. I have other horcruxes, other large pieces of my soul around. I absorbed most of them. Not with any regret of course.” his lips screwed up and his eyes narrowed in blatant distaste. “If that is what Albus is still trying to push onto the few youth that might happen upon knowledge of horcruxes. The entire process is simply a matter of will.” he sniffed. “Any soul piece retrieved will attempt to take over the body when returning and either absorb the other piece or meld together like my own did.”
“Yes.” she quietly chimed. She had a real charm with animals and the chickens were no exception after all.
. I myself, don’t give a damn about your convoluted Ministry policies, outdated views and regulations. The only place I’ve thus found free of corrupted influence is the Department of Mystery which does not fall under Ministry jurisdiction. What a shock there, right? That the
“Great for Etta’s little orchard. Otherwise when she gets upset things tend to explode. Better she gets it out of her system.”
Coming back to conscious was fuzzy and he was fairly sure he was drooling but his head was pillowed on something firm but soft and something was very pleasantly stroking through his hair. He stared ahead of him, unseeing for a few lovely moments before reality rushed in, making him skitter away and stare in flabbergasted horror at Evans.
“Why would I dance? What, plain old rigid traditional English dancing? I might as well just twirl around by myself. Oh! Maybe a ballet display should be set up? That would certainly make it more interesting. You know, in Italy they’ve mastered a sort of spell that makes shadow ballet dancers? Oh, they’re
“This is goodbye, Lord Voldemort.” she said plainly and when he stared at her face, there was something about it that made a sudden and fierce terror, frantic and fire-wild, well up from somewhere in his gut that made him want to vomit.
“Thank you Malmsi, you’ve been very helpful. I’ll be sure to call on you again.” the elf looked like she might be delirious with joy at being thanked so politely.
“Cygnus was born first.” his mother gestured to the one with pale hair. With his hair. “Corvus had been more…Difficult from what we are given to understand.” and that made Draco alert for the first time in
“So these new spells and the like, I assume that they’re what we’re going to study until hols come and we can use the ritual?” Nev spoke up again.

The house elves really did adore her. She smiled a bit, thinking about the little creatures. So helpful, they were.
That was good at least, she'd gotten used to living a fairly comfortable life even if she didn't get expensive presents and snacks like Dudley. She did have access to the study and thus books Marge kept and a large room all to herself that she got to decorate as she liked. And her own rather posh clothing, unlike when she lived with her own maternal Aunt and her husband. Walking through a dirty, rowdy pub called The Leaky Cauldron had her shift just a bit closer to the Professor who seemed thoroughly unimpressed by their current surroundings. The tall woman ignored the calls and Poppy stuck close to her, brushing down her bangs like the woman had told her to before they went in. It was only towards the exit that she stopped, and for a tall reedy looking man in a purple turban.
Well she supposed death wasn’t really considered harm when it was the killing curse. His lips turned down in a severe looking frown and he caught her chin in his free hand, forcing her eyes to his. He wasn’t- necessarily cold but he certainly wasn’t
“…This is going to come back to bite us at some point.” he eventually conceded but Pearl’s bright smile and tight hug made him crack a smile.
She nodded a little, or at least she hoped so. She was drugged up on so many potions and tranquilizing spells and charms she couldn’t really move all that much. Through her blurry vision, she thought he might have smiled before he reached for her. She slipped into half-sleep, that she was still vaguely aware but mostly sleeping so she probably wasn’t reliable enough to tell what exactly happened next.
She kicked her feet excitedly, a number of thick books spread and open around her as she did her best to absorb as much knowledge as she could before having to go to school. Practicing wand movements with a twig in the backyard before throwing it to the dogs (of whom Hesperia was vastly condescending to- Poppy could just see it in the owl's eyes) or spending most of her time reading. Or having bought a Bunsen burner and practicing potions things- she may or may not have bought a few extra potions kits than she really needed and
“I’d certainly hope not, but extenuating circumstances might mean there is.” her voice had a pleasing natural husk to it, soothing, and the sort of lilt that suggested she was well-traveled.
“You seem…Quite confident.” Narcissa struggled to get out, careful not to let her voice croak with the influx of information.
“There there, you’ve not had a thing to drink by way of mouth in quite some time now. A few potions and adjustments back into liquids will help that in a few days.”
His hands were shaking too hard. No, his entire body was shaking. He felt like he might collapse at any given moment. But he couldn’t do that, he needed to wake Evans. Pale, pale Evans sprawled in a mess on his bed. Pale pale Evans whose chest wasn’t moving-
People had used children or child-like guises against her before and she tensed up but a choked “Rosie,” immediately froze her as those two small bodies slammed against her, holding against her as small faces pressed hard into her stomach and hip. Her eyes drifted back to the door.
“Oh, what a coincidence! My niece is about the same age.” she smiled over her food at Lucius. If anyone would have told her back when she was young that she would be more or less flirting the line of seducing Lucius Malfoy, she might have thought they were just being a weird berk who was actually saying she had daddy issues combined with Stockholm syndrome. And to think! She was the older one here!

“The mousers seem to like her well enough. That mean calico that hangs about Gilbert’s goats? I saw her
Exhaustion mostly, the both of them since Fawkes tears helped her own injuries though the Matron had stared at Mimoza with pursed lips. A physical examination, thankfully, wasn’t needed as the initial scans didn’t show Mimoza to have any scrapes or bruises that was in direct conflict with the rips and tears in her clothing and the dried blood beneath the dust of rubble and grime from the abandoned chamber. She rubbed at her arm absently. That didn’t mean she didn’t have a new, large starburst-shaped scar. She would be wearing long sleeves for the foreseeable future. And since Marigold didn’t remember anything, she didn’t need any Mind Healers.
“That’s wonderful, simply wonderful. I’ll take you to the restroom first. Worry not, I’ll wait just outside and if you need me for anything, just knock on something yes?” the French lilt of his voice was pleasant. She nodded as he helped her stagger along to the plain door just across from her cot. He opened it for her and delicately placed her leaning against a clean white marble counter, smiling at her again and gently closing the door.
Her chuckle had the same husky tenor and it caressed his ears pleasantly. Oh yes, he thought to himself, he certainly wouldn’t mind a whirl with this woman. “I appreciate the offer and I do believe I’ll take you up on it.”
“I don’t ask to be excused. The statistics of the British Dark Lord or equivalent rate is astronomical, as is the harsh regulation and outlawed Dark Arts. Witches and wizards are not being taught to balance out the more addictive Dark Magics, just as they are not being taught Dark Magics with good and positive outcomes. Even things like blood related rituals have been entirely banned here! This sort of harsh oppression is what helps to create terroristic threats like the most recent Dark Lord, Morty or something. Those restrictions also make preparing oneself for drawbacks to more dangerous Dark Arts and knowledge on safely using Dark Arts almost impossible to find out and those that do look for such safety measures are often seen in harsh negative connotations or even as downright sinister for being associated with Dark magic at all. It creates a bubble of uneducated people who use magic without knowing the costs or safety of it. A novice might use a costly, addictive Dark spell high above their level and it will damage the magical core as well as possibly causing breaks in the mind that could lead to anything from coma to insanity. It’s just all left behind and those who use it and turn out as coma victims or insane are used as a poster-child for any and all who use Dark magic. It’s positively

besides standing around and gossiping like teenage girls? Because so far, that looks like all anyone is doing besides trying to out-do the others in strange boasting competitions about the silliest things. You know one man tried to say he’d wrestled a wild Mountain Troll with his bare hands and killed it?”
She looked like she was sleeping, he thought hysterically. And it certainly didn’t feel like this when he’d killed those muggles.
“Merely a correction, my dear Mr. Malfoy.” she said breezily before again pulling up his wrist. “Hm. That seems like a satisfactory amount of time here. If you’ll all excuse me, I need to regroup with the research team deployed here. Enjoy your evenings, the night is young, all that blather. Mr. Malfoy, Lady Malfoy.” she nodded to them in turn.
And just like that, her quiet seething turned into an inferno of fury and she very near didn’t stop herself from lunging at him, restrained arms or not. He glanced at her through his pale pale lashes. “That option is unlikely to ever come to fruition.” he pet the cat in his arms, even as the cat tried to push himself from Lucius’ chest to sniff at her face. “Still, the decision had not yet been made so for now Rusty will remain waiting.”
The other two, Lucius with the graceful curls of cool magical core twisting now almost nervously, and Narcissa’s creeping soft mist like core thickening in a fog with emotion.
Maybe if she were a boy, it'd be different. Then she would be the youngest Weasley boy and surely even that was better than what she had now.
“Yeah yeah, no group hugs yet, got it.” the casual way he said it was undermined by the way his core swirled in an angry twister of torn emotions. Hermione’s, steady as she always was, reflected it but not without little spikes, inquisitive and sharp.
been whispers that Walburga and Orion had used rituals and potions to aid in their conception of both boys…
“No, apparently the silkies come from a passed away relative and the frizzles were a family favorite. Got this beautiful lavender silkie too.”
When Jasper next found his sister, he and his friends were by the Great Hall entrance. She was surrounded by Hufflepuffs and The Hufflepuff. Cedric Diggory was talking with her animatedly and she listened compliantly. Jasper was quick to push himself over to his sister, not liking the way they were surrounding her.
And then they were in a bookstore and she almost felt like she would bounce off the walls. She was let loose and she shred through the store hungrily. It was a thorough inspection of all of the books she could get her hands on and she was glad for the extra money from her trust fund. She was brought up short when she saw her name on the cover of a thin book. Eyeing the other paperbacks around it, she was dismayed to see her name and the title Professor Sinistra had told her about. Naturally she grabbed one of each to better assess what this new exciting world had theorized about her- and weren't there laws about things like this? She knew there were in the muggle world about minors and publicity. Beyond that though, she got books for everything- law books, etiquette books, history books (she got quite a lot of those) theoretical books on subjects she'd never heard of, books on magical creatures and beings and books on the Ministry. Whatever she could get her hands on. In the end, she needed a cart and the person at the register had very kindly given her (with a little extra fee) a heavily charmed bag to hold all of them in one neat little bag and it was quite light. Her guide expressed amusement at the amount of books disappearing into the bag and muttered something about roosts and ravens? And then they, she and her guide, moved on.
“How is it, you think? It looks quite fanciful doesn’t it?” she asked the cat, turning her neck this way and that. His tail thumped against the bed, blinking at her slowly. She rolled her eyes before copying that slow blink, waving him off before sitting cross legged on the floor again. She plucked open Ron's gift, snorting at the candy she found but raising her eyebrows at the Cauldron Cakes. How on earth did she get those alcoholic treats? She shrugged, pulling one out.
from the wizarding side. Can you imagine what will happen to that poor girl if they get ahold of her? Just the privilege of saying they’re raising her will start a bidding war of the most influential families to get their claws into her. When you think Heather Potter, it’s always with ‘The-Girl-Who-Lived’. Not as a little girl who’d been orphaned and then celebrated because of it. She’s just a little girl, Edsel.” she was pleading now. “And she’s not even Heather Potter! Her legal name is Hellebore Heath now. And…” she got a spark in her eye. “Who’s to say that they won’t try to send her back to that muggle family she was with before? What if they’re her closest kin? Even if they don’t, if they’re the ones who sent her there we surely can’t trust them to treat her like any other orphan from a magical family. There would be a full blown social scandal. We can’t do that to her, Edsel. We
“She turned one of Gilbert’s goats pink once. It’s still pink, I mean. Floated some toys around when she was even smaller.” the woman told them.
She sat beside him on the train and his minions surrounded them in their compartment. They did not speak to her, and she did not speak at all during the trip, as has become custom. And, as usual, when the trolley came around, she bought an alarming amount of sweets that she would devour in a shockingly short amount of time. Precisely two hours before getting to the school, she would take out the food she’d made for the trip and eat again. Then when they get into the hall and after the usual sorting, she would stuff her face even more.

. What a way to find a long lost sister. Daughter, he thought as he glanced again at his parents. They looked like they would break into tears any moment now and he cringed a little. Just a little.
Being that land was somewhat precious commodity, owning a space enough for smallholding or farming, or just owning land in general was expensive business so Helaine’s land and home were untouched for the past six years since her passing.
she was most certainly not at the Dursleys, where she last remembered being and this was certainly not her cot. She frowned to herself, keeping quiet and mostly still under the wonderfully comfortable blanket as she tried to recall how she might have gotten into this bed.
He stayed at a seedy place in Knockturn over the summer. He’d also found and met his father and grandparents. He’d killed them with little fanfare. He was…Almost disappointed with how the thing played out. It did not give him a thrill, but he was immensely satisfied to have killed that dirty muggle and those doddering old fools. The way his hands shook and how he couldn’t seem to sleep for the next day or so were just…Jitters, is all. About being caught.
At this she looked to Eddie to see if he had any problems. He only shrugged so she offered a grin at the girl.
to gain some weight, some sort of curves to her lanky frame. She sighed to herself, quickly putting on a smile as one of her housemates started talking to her.
“You meant it. You have to mean it to cast those spells. You’d rather I be dead than leave you.” she looked at him, an assessing gleam in her eyes. “That’s not a good weakness to have Tom.”
But she was going to do that, with Dumbledore acting as guardian for it. It was only a few days away but she still felt like a miserable mess. At least the Dursleys were behaving. Well, Dudley was practically waiting on her hand and foot since she’d come back and while Vernon begrudgingly thanked her (thanked her! Him! Uncle Vernon!) for not letting Dudley get his soul sucked out, her aunt was less than impressed. However, now the woman simply ignored her with her nose in the air. As though that were a punishment somehow, not having to deal with her constantly harping at her. She did however, make her soup on her worse days. So she might care somewhere deep, deep,
“I don’t muck about with things like magic and whatnot but I’m certainly not going to stop her or tell her not to.” the woman gave the young couple a reproachful look. “If she gets too antsy and it builds up, she can disperse it into the gardens anyways. Why they’re so healthy and full anymore. Keeps certain pests from munching down our garden too.”
“So,” Harry began, looking between the two. Blue and dark brown eyes looked to her before glancing at one another. They offered solemn nods and Harry let a grim smile cover her features. And then conversation went on as usual, talking about their desolate summers and Harry handing over her Invisibility Cloak to Ron and Nev for them to sneak down to the Chamber later to meet her, along with the map she'd swiped from Filch in her second year to help her escape her peers.
“And how do you manage to stay well informed?” he asked with a frown and she shrugged noncommittally. He frowned again, anger rising and then waning. She could keep those secrets for now but he would get them at some point. Besides, she had answered his questions pretty consistently.
“It mimics a person. I live alone.” she told him as though that were all she really needed to say. Tom on the other hand, was wildly curious and immediately an idea hatched in his head.
heal.” she said and he couldn’t seem to keep from her eyes. They were brighter than normal, they were sharp like shards of ice in a tundra, more than able, than willing to cut him open with the slightest misstep.
Still- practicing writing with a quill and ink pot, charmed and magical as they were, was probably the most challenging thing. And with parchment! She would naturally be bringing many notebooks and colored pens and all of that but she would need to perfect parchment and quills for actual assignments. When her cousin Dudley would sneak about and ask her about her new books (and that shiny golden pot- she didn't bother correcting him), she cheerfully told him all about the things she was studying and the boarding school she would be attending.
“What do you mean someone’s taken her wards down?! How did someone not authorized even get in?!” a furious, frazzled Director hissed. There were five units in this facility and each had its own Director, who worked solely under the owners of the entire establishment, a small group of distinguished medical professionals. And no one in his department was allowed to go into the patients’ rooms without at least two other people, which meant whenever a staff member visited and checked on their patient there were at least three in the room besides the patient for safety and legal reasons.
The first time they’d seen her giggle was a shock, to be sure. With her placid expressions and quiet demeanor, it was amazing to see how it changed when she laughed or giggled or smiled. Her whole little face lit up and her eyes sparkled and it was always just such a wholesome sight.
