"Draco Malfoy—" Draco almost flinched at the use of his first name coming out from Harry's mouth but played it off by scratching his arm."—did you just make a joke with me?"
Draco snorted, shaking his head slightly. "A high five?" Harry nodded back. "You can't be serious? You got a question right, not an outstanding in your exam."
"I'm a disappointment. I've heard it a million times and I bet I'll hear it another million times. It's like I can never satisfy anyone. Either I'll be hurting my friends or random mudbl- " Draco once again stopped himself from saying the word, glancing at Harry. "-muggles I don't care about or I'll be hurting my parents, not living up to their expectations as a Malfoy or a pure blood."
"That Ravenclaw guy? Jet black hair with really,
Thanks Hermione for interrupting my pleasant daydream.
Instantly Harry started to protest, shaking his head. "Never." But Draco didn't really process what Harry had said and shrugged unconvinced. "You just seem a bit... different, and now I don't know if the potion actually worked."
"I never said I found it funny."
"Finally, Ha! Two words, thank the Heavens."
"But I want
It had simply been brushed past, unfortunately for Harry, and nothing more was said about it. Though Draco had continued to give Harry kissing tips, he had left the practical side of it out, reducing the teaching to
He didn't think he had ever liked a boy before in that way.
Harry's eyes opened immediately to find his arms wrapped around the person- who he now knew to be Malfoy- and started to panic. If it weren't for the
was he here? There were so many more, but they all left when Harry took off the invisibility cloak, revealing his chaotic self.
After the game, he would try and confront Harry, find out why he was ignoring him and why he was stressed, Draco decided as he walked back to his common room, filled with thoughts of Harry.
Draco.
"You were being smug, I could see, and you don't always have to use my name. I know you're talking to me, you don't need to say my name to remind me."
It felt so real.
"I promise." How would she even think to get mad?
Harry kicked out the thoughts of him being horny for Draco's hand and did what he was meant to do from the beginning: Pass his essay to Draco. As Draco read, or skimmed, through Harry's essay on the properties of the ingredient Moonstone, Harry could already tell what Draco was going to say: it was–
Did he always look this pretty?
Draco dragged Harry's arm, pulling him to a random classroom that seemed to be empty–how perfectly timed– and ignoring Harry's questions on what he was doing since he didn't even know the answer himself. There, in the classroom, he pushed Harry against the wall, staring into Harry's eyes that held confusion, fear and something else... excitement?
"Harry! Are you ill or something?"
Harry knew this to be an obvious lie; Hermione finished all her homework's on the day. Hermione gave Harry one last knowing look before getting up and leaving the hall.
"Harry!" Hermione's slightly irritated voice instantly moved my gaze back to her chocolate coloured eyes, missing the grey ones from before. "When are you going to ask her out?"
Harry attempts to make a move with Ginny.
Draco was out before you could even say the word 'go', as Harry did a slight jog to catch up with him. "Where you running off to?"
for the sake of this book, the love potion works by if u drink or taste it, the first person u look at is who u fall in love with unlike the og plot where it has to be received by the person for u to fall in love with them :)
Draco didn't wait a second longer for any doubts to sink in and leaned in, lightly backing her against the wall. He roughly kissed her, desperately trying to get that spark he would with
"Don't be mad." Draco rolled his eyes, but a ghost of a smile still remained on his lips.
"Yeah, whatever." Harry grumbled, trying to shut the conversation off.
Harry had an almost-defiant look on his face, keeping his mouth shut so Draco knew he had to answer for the both of them. "Yes, it's still going on."
"You're in Hogwarts Potter. Exactly where you were before you fell asleep." Draco's retorts fell out of his mouth smoothly, almost like his thoughts from before had never happened.
"Don't blame yourself. Presuming all you told me is how things happened–" Hermione arched a brow, Harry nodding in response. (Well, most of it, he thought to himself.) "– then I would think he had the same feelings back."
as his perfect candidate to help him.
, and he had completely forgotten (again) that they were back to surname basis. Normally, before the
was ready to kiss him again.
Harry put on a (hopefully) believable fake smile and laughed with Ron. He tapped his feet against the ground to distract himself from his worrying thoughts about Draco. "I- My bruise is hurting a bit; I think I'll go to the toilets and check to make sure it's okay but you guys can go to our next class without me, I'll meet you there." Harry stood up and left the hall, hearing faint goodbyes.
Draco rolled his eyes, carrying on walking. "No surprise there that you're friends with second year muggles."
"Spit it out, we don't have all day."
"I've finished it." Harry announced after a few seconds, passing the parchment to Draco. He checked over it, searching for any mistakes, but there were none.
Draco simply nodded again, Harry taking it as a cue that the conversation had ended. He started heading back towards the hall before he stopped and turned back around. "Will you be there tonight?" His head tilted a bit to the side, waiting for Draco's answer.
"–I'm gonna get an Exceeding–"
The corner of Draco's lips started to twitch a bit, like they were trying to resist the smile coming, "I don't think that's true." Harry, however, immediately caught the trace of something that seemed like a smile growing and his eyes brightened, "See!" He exclaimed, so eagerly that Draco let out a laugh at his silliness.
Or the other way around, depending on the angle, and on who would be the one telling the story of this day.
Ron smiled seeing the two of them then remembered Harry had wanted to say something to him. "What were you trying to tell me in Potions?"
"Yes, just need the toilet." Draco responded in a rushed manner.
, but also weird, very weird. Parkinson leaned closer to him, creating a whole lot of questions swarming around my head.
These were the lips Draco had been craving; the ones that felt so right on his and as the kiss became more secure, the warm sensation in his stomach also started grow, but then Harry's boner was rubbing against... his boner, and although the friction felt titillating, it snapped Draco out of it, remembering how wrong this should be.
reacting to the conversation. "What's wrong?" He asked again, having realised that Draco had never told him the reason he needed to talk to him.
"No, you know–" Harry looked serious but on seeing the smirk on Draco's face, he rolled his eyes. "You're such a smart arse." Which would've prompted Draco to say
His gaze would just drift to the brown haired boy and stay there, watching how at ease he looked :smiling, laughing, chatting... the opposite of what Draco had been doing lately with his 'friends'.
The smile dropped from Harry's face; was he really that obvious? "He's just going to tutor me, that's it." But when Harry saw the dissatisfaction on Pansy's face, he realised that she had just been trying to get a reaction out of him, allowing him to relax a bit again. Pansy opened her mouth to speak again but Harry had had enough, and swooped in. "Nice seeing you Parkinson. Tell your boyfriend I said hi." Harry let a bit of his jealousy drop out, walking the other way and leaving a fuming Pansy standing in her spot.
Draco quickly regained his posture, standing up straight with that usual sneering look he gave. "Give me one reason why I should help you,
Harry could see Hermione's face crinkle up as their lips got closer and closer to each other until at the last second, Harry shook his head and stood up abruptly, causing Hermione to almost fall over into the air where Harry was sitting before.
"You alright?" Harry asked cheekily.
The conversation had come to a comfortable end, and Draco actually felt satisfied that he had managed to get on Harry's good side again.
Draco Malfoy laughed.
Draco didn't waste any time to deepen the kiss, his hand cupping Harry's cheek as their tongues met, Draco almost groaning at how intoxicating Harry's lips were. That's why he was surprised-and annoyed- when Harry pulled away and almost pouted at him. "We have to go back to Potions." Harry reminded.
"And it didn't look like a glare." She continued, eyeing Harry as if trying to scare him into spilling what was happening. "Are you two friends now? Because of your tutoring sessions? Malfoy barely spares a glare for you anymore."
Harry nodded but inside his head he knew as soon as the wand was placed in his hands, he'd be gone before you could even call out his name.
"Oh, I just remembered that I need to finish off my... charms homework." Hermione announced before either of them could speak.
"Singing?" Harry frowned, his brows furrowing. "Oh, just now?" Draco nodded. "Just some muggle song." Harry seemed surprised at the question and paused, maybe expecting Draco to say something about muggle music, but he didn't, so Harry carried on. "I heard it on my cousin's radio–"
Harry grinned and thought of questions he could ask, some that Draco would actually be able to answer. "Pretend I'm somebody you don't know, I'm not the Harry you know, so I won't judge any of your answers." He tried to reassure Draco as best as he could, carrying on when he saw the nod of approval from him. "Have you- Well, have you ever jerked off thinking of someone of the same sex?"
"Potter, once again, your inability to follow instructions has been proven." Snape pointed to the board where it was written 'Silence.' He stopped talking but carried on looking at Harry pointedly, making him fidget in his chair at the unwanted attention.
Harry had no choice but to just watch her circle him, his eyes following her every movement. "
Ginny. Yes.
"Muggles?" Apart from Harry thinking about him, thinking of muggles was even more unexpected.
sport." Harry teased, already knowing he'd– excuse the pun again– hit the mark when there was no reply from Draco except a grumble of some kind before a "Shut up." Then the sound of a door shutting.
"Yeah." I agreed with her half-heartedly. If Ginny was the way to get Hermione off my back, then I would follow it gladly. This thing with Malfoy... I needed to fully come to terms with it myself before having a curious Hermione hitting me with question after question.
A few weeks later, Draco and Harry's tutoring sessions had been going strong, despite the awkwardness they had to overcome every time they met, both of their minds going back to after that quidditch match.
"Do you like Parkinson?" Harry completely ignored Draco's previous statements.
"Oh well— No, I just... Er, you could say." Harry stammered, trying to find the right excuse. "Yeah, I just want to make sure we win, you know?" Harry half lied.
Neither of them spoke for a bit, not even Draco who just sat with his head buried in his arms, tapping his foot against the ground as if it would quicken the boredom he was sure he was destined to die from. "I'm hot." Draco lifted his head from his arms, putting his hand on his forehead that felt like it was sizzling.
Draco, the boy who had wanted to make Harry's life a living hell since the day he rejected a handshake.
"Yep, you sure are." Harry replied, misunderstanding which 'hot' Draco was talking about.
Harry opened his mouth, ready to thank her, or even start some small talk, when he felt someone crash into him from behind, catching him off guard so much that he stupidly lost his balance and fell onto the ground, hearing a click as his knee took the brunt of the fall.
Hermione had on her concentrated look, tapping her foot against the ground. "And he went home recently?"
harry finds that not all things are merry and bubbly in his friendship with draco
"I– It was nothing."
Draco nodded back.
"Advantage? Of me?" Draco wondered if they were talking about the same person. How could
Yet all his thoughts were once again knocked down by Hermione speaking... When had they finished arguing?
"Shut up or I'll take it back." Draco snapped, Harry going silent for only a few moments before he carried on mumbling his self-written song.
Hermione didn't respond, but he got his answer when she stood up and told them that she'd be back before going in the same direction Draco had.
Harry was stressed... but why?
"Oh... Oh." Of course he did, Draco thought.
"Don't be rude." Harry frowned, but accepted Draco's jab at him to shut up and kept quiet until they got to Madam Pomfrey.
"You know, like a celebratory thing... like a high five."
Draco nodded slowly, seemingly unaffected by Harry's sudden outburst. "Hm."
"You shouldn't just live to satisfy people. You should be who you want to be. Take care of yourself first."
Draco knew he'd said the wrong words when the half smile on Harry's face left as his lips pursed together, appearing to be in deep thought.
"Yeah, I did feel a bit dizzy." And he felt even more dizzy now with Harry's subconscious teasing.
"I should go." Harry turned to leave, but without even thinking, Draco stopped him, placing his hand on Harry's shoulder. He quickly moved his hand away from Harry's shoulder to his chin, forcing Harry to look into his eyes.
"Five minutes." Draco murmured, his lips dangerously close to Harry's again.
Harry could easily twist his head to the side, tell Draco that they couldn't do this, but then it was too late; his lips were on Draco's, and for the fifth time– not as if Harry was counting– Harry was kissing Draco, and Draco was kissing him back.
"Just as foreseen, no apology. 10 points from Gryffindor and in fact, Mr Weasley, swap seats with Mr Malfoy, maybe that'll prevent either of you from talking over me."
"Yeah, so you like boys too?"
Harry frowned; his previous questions/statements being completely ignored, but then shrugged, hiding his annoyance with a tight lipped smile.
Yeah, that sounded like a perfectly explainable reason.
"But–"
He heard a good luck from Ron and saw Hermione give him a warm smile before he made his way to the Slytherin dungeons.
"Has he talked to you about his family's views?"
And when he did finally come back to consciousness, he immediately noted a natural light shining over him, a bit of a breeze rumpling his clothes.
Never. (Maybe a bit debatable but...)
Hermione slowly nodded, her eyes still squinting at him before she carried on.
Malfoy wasn't the one I liked, it was Ginny.
Harry thanked the heavens for Ron's unconscious distraction that he had given him and still, even whilst on the brink of having his secret exposed, Harry looked over to the Slytherin table whilst Hermione was busy trying to reassure Ron that she had simply noticed it by accident.
." The venom in Potter was even worse than all of the other times.
But Draco was bored, and was trying to stir up an argument that just wasn't happening. "You look ugly."
Harry knew why, it was obvious, but pretending to be oblivious seemed the easier option. "Malfoy was always a sneaky little scum, there's no point in bothering about him." Ron had been gladly piping in his Draco hate for the past week, hearing less protests from Harry this time. Hermione, however, glared at him and opened her mouth to most likely correct him but Harry shook his head. "No, Ron's right, I shouldn't have gotten my hopes so high."
"If you excuse my bias, I think he led you on. You two sounded...
"Yes." Harry managed to splutter out. "Don't– Just, stick with Potter for now." He looked conflicted at his own words; he didn't mind Draco calling him by Harry, but the way he said it– God, it evoked dirty thoughts in him, all reminding him of when Draco had moaned his n–
Harry walked back by himself from Madam Pomfrey, heading to his room. He was still suffocating in the shame of today's events and had lied to Madam Pomfrey saying he still felt a bit woozy, blaming it on the antidote's aftereffects.
Harry had been ignored by Draco for the past week and it was killing him.
"Expect the unexpected." Draco moved away from Harry. "Because I sure didn't." He muttered to himself. Harry really was crap at kissing, but Draco still felt as if the confusion played a huge role in his freezing.
Hermione shrugged, a curious glint still in her eyes, but she didn't bring it up again, though knowing Hermione, the first thing she would do as soon as she had the chance to would be to investigate where his 'bruise' had come from.
He was grateful that he had his own to himself, thanks to his father requesting a separate room, but it could get lonely sometimes, which would explain why he would prefer to be alone in the astronomy tower then in his own room.
"Why don't you take a guess?"
"No, you're right." He nodded with a grim look on his face. "I've been cowering behind a shell for too long, all because of my fear of what people would say and whilst doing this, I... I hurt you in the process too and I shouldn't have done that."'
Apparently the offer for the two of them to be civil had been conditional; the condition being that they both had to only see each other in a friendly way, but Harry had broken the terms by admitting his feelings for Draco.
Draco swiftly looked down at the textbook in front of him, heat running through his cheeks at being caught. He cleared his throat and adjusted the collar of his shirt.
Draco took the silence as an agreement to what he had said and smiled, nodding his head. "Great, I'm glad you get it too."
"It's for emphasis,
Seconds passed as Draco tried to think of something up on the spot. "Have you done the potions assignment?"
"You better leave Harry alone. He doesn't need this extra stre–" She stopped mid sentence, realising who she was talking to. "Just forget it."
"So you're saying if he did you'd date him?"
"Nemesis' to lovers. Wow. Who knew?" Draco seemed more amused at the discovery of Harry actually being interested in romance novels.
Unlike last time in his bed, Harry woke up quicker, wiping his eyes with his hands before squinting at Draco. "Malfoy?"
Harry remembered Hermione was still waiting for an answer, so took his eyes away from the Slytherin table and bluntly answered, "No idea." Completely aware of why Draco was staring.
Harry didn't look up, nodding his head. "Yeah, see you later." And before Draco could protest, Harry had ran outside, joining Ron and Neville.
!" He hissed, shaking his shoulder. Harry looked down at the point of contact, grinning before spontaneously flinging himself into Draco's arms, proclaiming his love for him.
." Hermione was still getting to terms that Harry, the boy who had just said he liked Ginny, now liked Draco.
"I love you Hermione but I just— I can't do this with you."
Harry looked back down at Draco, an apologetic look on his face. "I'm sorry, I should've paid more attention," Harry felt the weight from his lap dissipate as Draco sat back up, appearing better than before. "So Snape sent me here so you could get some air then
"So,"
"Someone's got their knickers in a twist." Harry joked to himself as he limped next to Draco, every step he took sending painful jolts up his knee.
"No, I wasn't watching you eating." Draco practically read Harry's mind. "I just happened to look over at the same time that Granger was stuffing her face into your neck instead of her food, like Weasley does." He retorted.
Draco simply watched her leave before continuing on his route to the library. As soon as he entered, Hermione's face come to view, her unkempt hair exploding into all of the books she had open.
"Oh crap, yes." Harry stood up, realising that Ron had told him he'd be back. "How about you? Won't anyone notice that you're gone?"
"That sounds like the bloody worst. See, that's one advantage of not being a nerd in classes, least I don't have to tutor Gryffindorks. Gross." She scrunched up her face in disgust, Draco rolling his eyes at her immature insult of the Gryffindors.
He pulled away from Harry's body abruptly, shaking his head. "Oh fuck."
"Actually Mr Malfoy, Potter will, I need to talk to you separately." Draco's smirk faded as Snape stood in front of their desk, but Harry wasn't in the mood to analyse or feel any sympathy for Draco. Served the git right, he thought to himself. So blinded by his irritation, Harry didn't double check the amounts he measured, and didn't even bother to look at anybody else's cauldrons. He knew he was being a bit careless, but the potion actually smelt good, almost like a minty smell. Was it meant to be this colour though? It looked familiar. Harry pushed those thoughts aside and glanced quickly to both sides, checking to make sure nobody was watching, then quickly dipped a finger in, bringing it to his mouth and tasting it.
Draco raised a brow at Harry, curiosity clear on his face. "And how accurate will this be?"
"You."
"And what could you possibly be thinking about that is more important than your studies?"
"Merlin Harry, can't you get one thing right?" Draco didn't even believe the words pouring out of his mouth but he just really wanted Harry to snap, yell at him, anything, but all Harry did was a twitch of his brows before his neutral expression came back.
End of Exhibition B.
As usual.
"Draco! You're back?" Draco turned around to see an elated Harry whose mood started to dampen seeing the frown on Draco's face.
"I knew you liked me as more than a friend."
"Friends again?" Harry held his hand out to which Draco stared at it before swallowing down his doubts on their friendship and shaking Harry's hand. "Yes, friends."
her face into my neck, she thought she saw a bruise on it, and technically, that was your fault." Harry defended, folding his arms.
Hermione sighed but explained anyways, "You're with Malfoy. Professor Snape switched the order in how he picked the partners." She whispered, glancing to where Snape was standing to ensure he wasn't looking. "Are you sure you're okay?"
"Shut up
I nodded my head in agreement, Ron seeming to be satisfied by that answer, when the image of Malfoy winking came into my head causing me to choke on the food I hadn't even began to eat.
Draco went to say something; of course Harry liked him, they just used to be friends a few days ago, but Harry could see in Draco's face that he didn't get it and quickly elaborated, "As more than a friend, you idiot."
"I said no talking."
"What is it you wanted then?"
"What do you think?"
Of course only his mother cared if he was okay.
Draco heard Harry walk up from behind him, placing a hand on Draco's shoulder. "Not that I'm complaining but... Why did you just kiss me?"
Draco didn't turn to reply to Harry, unsure if he could trust himself to make eye contact with him. "See you..." Harry's words faded off as he used his wand to open the door, leaving the room.
It just vexed him more that Hermione was right. Obviously it was his father, it always was. Draco needed something, or someone, to just release his frustration out on, yet the person he really wanted to talk to wasn't there, and it just enraged him even more.
"Thanks Harry, I guess I'm gonna have to spend the rest of today cramming for it." Ginny sighed, glancing to the side. "I don't know if I'm going crazy, but is Malfoy glaring at me?"
I like the way you're always so kind even when others aren't. I like the way your eyes light up when you think you know something I don't–very rarely though– I like the way I feel when I'm around you; like we're in this secret bubble that only the two of us know about, and there's no worries, no sadness, no–" But Draco didn't get to finish his 'love confession' as he felt lips crush against his.
"A lot on your mind, Potter?" A voice called out from behind me.
Harry stayed lying down on his bed for a few minutes before deciding he had stayed there for too long, getting up and grabbing his invisibility cloak.
"They are?" Snape still had his view on Harry who didn't appear like he was going to say anything.
Draco was sure he'd be able to find out what Harry was going to say soon enough; perhaps when Harry would be sleepy.
Hermione had tried her best to convince Ron to join them in the library, and she almost had, until two minutes in, Ron had claimed that the vibes were off, leaving Hermione and Harry by themselves.
Harry still risked a glance to the Slytherin table again to see Draco with his jaw clenched as he glowered at Harry. Seeing Harry looking at him, he got up, and practically stormed out of the hall, attracting heads to turn and stare at him.
"You're not... well, you can be sometimes, but it's because you're always trying to live up to other people's expectations. You don't always need to live by a rule book."
"Actually, I do believe it is my business."
Draco wanted to laugh at the irony of the Chosen One asking him to help with flirting skills but Harry's look was sincere, also being very ashamed.
"No, tell me now what you mean by that."
"Your room?"
Draco
When they finally got to Draco's room, Draco immediately split from Harry, almost starting to sweat at how close together they'd been whilst Harry went straight to Draco's bed, flopping onto his stomach. "Your bed is so comfy."
Harry discovers that paying attention in class is key for avoiding embarrassment.
Harry expected the Draco before to probably make a snide comment about muggles and their ways of fighting, but Draco kept quiet, not mentioning a single word on Harry's face, or the fact that he had somehow managed to heal it.
Draco froze, staring at Harry with a blank look. "A wha–?"
Harry was trying his best to shut off the Draco side of his brain for the week, but it was much easier said than done, especially with how Draco had finally decided it was 'notice Harry Potter' week. It was like instead of him being repelled away from Draco, they were magnets being attracted to each other. Draco would just constantly seem to be in the same place as him; the bathroom, the corridors and even outside the Gryffindor common room once (though that was because he needed some notes from a Gryffindor in their year) . Perhaps this was how Draco had felt before, Harry showing up everywhere he was. Right now though, Hermione was searching for a book on her new project: House elves.
"So what?" Harry shrugged, the smile leaving his face.
Harry's mind is occupied with thoughts of Draco, but in order for him to keep it a secret, he may need to be more cautious about when, and where, he gets closer to him.
"I'm busy." Draco's short answer felt like a hit in Harry's heart.
, and your hair, what products do you use? I'd love to run my hands through your hair all day if I could." In the middle of speaking, Harry had started to poke Draco's flushed cheeks whilst Draco stood still.
"Does anyone care to tell me why nobody woke me up?"
"No, Potter, it's due tomorrow."
"Welp Draco," Harry sat down in his seat, looking up at Draco. "Guess I'm stuck with an irritated you for another five minutes- not like that's anything new."
Hermione and Ron gave one last look to Harry but he didn't even spare a glance at them as they walked out.
"Someone's grumpy. Maybe his father never heard about it." Ron snorted.
your fault because I had to search everywhere for it, not knowing
Harry was so shocked by how soft Draco's voice had become, and before he could even snap back in to step away from Draco, he heard Draco mumble something quietly, lightly touching one of Harry's bruises and somehow making the pain fade. Draco stepped away immediately afterwards, but not before Harry noticed a slight blush on the tip of his ears as he cleared his throat. "Right, let's start then."
"I'll see you later." Draco ignored the question, walking out and leaving Harry to wonder what he'd done now to earn this sudden mood change.
"You know...?" Harry trailed off, expecting Draco to catch on but if anything, Draco seemed more puzzled. "Have you never read a romance book like that?"
"Yes." Harry answered dolefully.
"Are you okay?" Harry seemed to be asking that question a lot to him these days.
Ron straight away forgot about their discussion on Draco and brightened up. "Well, I thought I needed the toilet so I was like
Harry hid his face in his hands, shaking his head. "Please no."
"Three times?" Draco exclaimed, raising his brows whilst also in knowledge that he should've been paying attention too.
"It doesn't even matter anymore."
"Pleaseeeee..."
." If Draco had known to get Harry angry all he had to do was say his first name, that would've been the first thing he would've done when they were younger.
"It's just, please don't laugh but... I've been told my kissing techniques aren't the best by uh-" Harry cleared his throat, drowning in the awkwardness. "-a lot of people? So I needed help and that's where you came into the equation."
Harry, however, had no idea of the conflicted thoughts Draco was having, and felt so confused and upset that he almost ran into someone as he turned into a corridor.
"You were so great out there, well done!" She complimented, giving him a hug. Harry was sure he was sweaty, but Ginny didn't seem to notice, or if she did, she just didn't mind.
Hermione glowered at the nickname but kept her voice as calm as she could, "I'm not interested in talking to you right now Malfoy. Don't you have anywhere else to be?"
Whilst Draco could feel Harry's breaths start to become steady, the thumb stroking Draco's skin slowing down, Draco was the opposite; his heart rate climbing to unthinkable levels. "Harry?" Draco heard no response, confirming that Harry had fallen asleep. "Fuck." He couldn't believe how easy it was for himself to melt in Harry's hands, just like putty. He tried to shuffle around since Harry's hand was getting far too near to his groin area, but all that did was make him feel something growing against his arse.
Ron turned back to Harry who was still looking in the direction of where Draco had been. "You alright? Did Malfoy bother you?"
He would never truly admit it, but as much as he could say he didn't want to see Draco ever again, it wouldn't feel the same without his constant ridicules. However, as Harry got closer and closer, his embarrassment, and temporary kindness for Draco, had started to switch to anger, remembering the events that had led up to him drugging himself.
Pansy seemed to be into it, letting out a little whimper as Draco tried to make the kiss deeper but he couldn't–it just wasn't
Hearing her name jogged Draco's memory to her saying that Harry had said they were friends. He didn't know why it bothered him so much, he should just forget about it, but his curiosity got a hold of him as he started to speak. "Granger told me that you said we were friends."
had it. Then you boss me around, finding it funny that Snape hates me–"
being that close to Draco... but only if you could minus the audience that had been watching
This whole conversation seemed so foreign; him asking if Harry was okay, Harry almost spilling a secret, calling each other by their first names...It was like a fever dream.
However, when he saw Harry sitting- or rather sleeping- against the wall, half of his body invisible, most likely by the invisibility cloak slipping down, he didn't feel the annoyance he thought he would've. He so easily could have left, found somewhere else to go, but he could always blame it on his ego; this was his spot, he had come here regularly before Harry, but he knew that wasn't the only reason he stayed.
As soon as he got to the toilets, he checked the stalls to ensure nobody was in there and went straight to the mirror. He unbuttoned the top part of his shirt to find many prominent 'bruises' splattered just below his neck. "Shit, why'd he have to make them so noticeable?" Harry grumbled to himself, pulling out his wand to do the glamour spell when he heard a voice, causing him to jump.
Draco didn't react as melodramatic as last time, but he still looked uncomfortable and kept silent. "Fine, imagine you're on an island, and there's no parents, no friends, nobody to judge any of your decisions, and you don't care about what anybody thinks of you. Now, if you were thinking of somebody to date, would you mind going on a date with a boy?"
"Fuck, Draco."
want was to see Ginny and Harry together. There was no exact valid reason for why he didn't like the Weasley girl, but he was Draco, he didn't need a reason.
Why couldn't he have liked kissing someone who was kind, not actively out to get him? Someone who didn't steal his homework on purpose or hold a grudge against him because he didn't accept a handshake from when they were eleven.
The taste was almost bittersweet— he would sure love some pumpkin juice right now to wash it down— but since he still felt relatively normal; no missing fingers or his teeth growing long like a beaver, like Hermione's once did, he shrugged, feeling okay with himself.
"About yesterday." Draco simply carried on, dismissing Harry's words.
Harry sat down at Draco's very fancy, and organised, desk, sucking in a deep breath when Draco pulled out a chair and sat next to him. "Let's start with the essay you did then." Draco held out his hand for Harry to pass it to him. Harry, instead, just stared at Draco's smooth hand, thinking of what it would be like to hold it and smile with Dra– "Harry!"
Harry, however, was too skittish to just sit down and study so decided he would take his leave. "I'm gonna go outside, see if I can find Ron as well whilst I'm outside."
Harry didn't know if he was fully ready to admit his crush on Ginny, but since Draco had opened up, he also felt obliged to. "Don't laugh, but I want to impress Ginny." Draco didn't know if Harry realised but he had started to smile thinking of Ginny. "I think I really like her."
When Harry did zone back into reality, Hermione was giving him a sympathetic smile, like she knew what he was thinking... which she definitely didn't.
Harry didn't make any effort to talk first so Draco gladly welcomed the idea of a silent Harry and started to speak. "Since you're so incompetent, I'll make the potion, you watch."
That woke him up.
last time you showed up with bruises that you're still not telling me who did it... and I know you didn't trip–"
"Okay, great, yeah." Draco's voice wavered slightly, staring at Harry who was biting his lip, almost making Draco want to kis-
"Because."
"You shouldn't swear on anything." Draco lightly reprimanded him, but nevertheless went and sat next to Harry whose smile grew.
But now Draco had done something wrong and this was not the time for Hermione to dwell on how blind sighted she had been, so obsessed with her exams that she had turned a blind eye to her own best friend's love life. The rage came back in Hermione's eyes as she realised that Draco had messed up badly for Harry to be this upset. "What did that bloody punk do now?"
When Draco did finally hear that knock on the door, he straight away whispered a "Alohomora" that opened the door up, revealing Harry who had his head down as he slightly...
But then as if he had foreshadowed the coming of people, he heard some loud giggles around the corner and almost immediately, the two of them split: Draco rolling off of Harry and sitting up whilst Harry did the same, pulling himself up so he was also sitting next to Draco.
"Yes, that would appear obvious to anyone with eyes."
"Potter, I do advise you concentrate."
Meanwhile, Draco stood leaning against the wall.
"Harry!" Hermione whisper-yelled, getting Harry's attention as he realised she, and many other of his classmates, were standing up. Harry got up and stood next to her but she shook her head, confusing him even more. "Oh Harry, were you not listening at all?"
"Is this still about Jack? Because if it is, I swear I didn't mean that I'd actually be angry at you."
"Views on what? He's talked a bit about how they're strict and stuff, but only because they love him, he claims."
But Pansy seemed to show up every time he didn't want her to. "Did you just bump into Snape?" She immediately inquired, poking her nose into where it didn't need to be.
Harry was listening intently to Ginny when he felt a stare on him, looking across the hall to see it was none other than Draco. With their 'budding' friendship, Harry had expected a bit more support from Draco at the fact he was talking to his crush, but instead, he got a glare.
Although Draco had agreed to meet Harry, he sat in his own dorm by himself.
Harry came to a stop at the wall, glancing up to see Draco staring back at him, taunting him. "I just— I don't know Malfoy, just say if you'll help me already so I can know whether I'm leaving or staying."
"I'll see you tonight then." Draco didn't bother for a reply from Harry and walked off with a sly grin that Harry didn't understand; he wasn't going to meet Draco, that would just be stupid.
Harry instantly felt more relaxed, grinning back at Hermione, another reminder of why he was best friends with her.
"Oh."
this was a very slow update so apologies for that but i’m hoping there’s no mistakes so enjoy this last chapter full of rollercoasters :) thank you for reading!
And there it was.
It was Pansy's voice that reminded him that he had really done that. "Looks like the Golden boy likes you." Her tone was taunting, but not towards him, yet he felt rage towards it.
He liked Ginny.
"Of course." Hermione responded calmly. "You told us many times to bog off because you were too tired to get up."
Loads of things: you included, Harry thought shamelessly, praying Draco hadn't suddenly become a legillimens.
"Fine." Harry repeated back.
Now that made more sense.
"Why didn't you answer my knocks?" Pansy would look annoyed, assessing Draco's messy look.
Draco's mouth opened and shut a few times, nothing coming out until he saw Hermione arching a brow, waiting for his reply. "I'm not gay and I don't like Harry."
"Yeah, it's just weird." Draco replied back, decidedly stopping trying to discover what Harry was hiding for now. "Harry, Harry, Harry, how does it sound?" Draco looked towards Harry to see him biting roughly down on his lower lip, the redness being sucked away.
Well, not literally, but compared to when Harry would practically follow him around whenever he could, he hadn't seen Harry for a few days, even in lessons.
"You sure? Peeing with a boner sounds like a
It went silent after that, Draco openly welcoming it. Pansy's concentrated gaze was fixed on the ground, like she was attempting to do a wandless spell. But Draco knew what that meant when it came to her; she wanted a favour.
"–that's why."
"Are you sure? Your lips are looking a bit swollen." Hermione pointed out.
"No." Draco straightforwardly replied back. "Last time was once and not again
"Although I believe this is highly dumb, and I personally think you should wait until the right person comes, if you are going to-" Hermione paused, searching for the right word. "-practise, practise with someone you're not close to, therefore, less feelings attached. That's why you couldn't do it with me, we're too close as friends."
"Terrible."
Silence.
"Uh the pot– Wait, so it did work?" Although Harry had asked this softly, it had come out much harsher in Draco's head, like Harry was shouting at him, so he snapped back immediately, not liking the way Harry thought he could talk to him. "What do you think, scarhead?"
"I'm guessing you're not going to say anything."
"You're like Hermione... but a colder version."
Naturally, Draco tried to push Harry off of him but it was as if the boy had grown super strength, holding him tightly and snuggling his head into Draco's neck. "I love you so much Draco. Wow, can I call you Draco? Draco is such a beautiful name to suit such a beautiful face like yours." Harry rambled into Draco's neck before pulling away so they came face to face. "Your skin is so smooth, like a baby's, but you're not a baby, unless you want to be my baby,
"Well, yes, mostly, since he does have a say in who I should marry and all." And Harry's worries were confirmed when Draco still didn't say 'No'.
Harry nearly let out a sigh of relief at that being all. "We're friends now, I guess, so it doesn't matter too much." Though Harry would've been freaking out more if it wasn't for the knowledge that him calling Draco by his first name was a much better option than allowing things to click into place for Draco.
." Harry corrected, but Draco carried on muttering something to do with the word 'lovers' that Harry couldn't quite hear. "Anyways–" He deliberately raised his voice over Draco's, cutting off Draco's conversation to himself. "I'm glad it happened."
Is what was ringing in Draco's head as he explained the incident so collectedly. It had been completely natural for Harry's name to just come out as
Another typical Slytherin response.
Draco looked at the way Harry seemed so at peace, feeling this need to protect him from any dangers that would try to come for him, but what if he was the danger he was so worried about? But then he remembered Harry's words: 'You're not evil.' And he had seemed so sincere though he knew nothing of what Draco had done.
"You told them about us?" Harry blurted out, seeing the way Draco's brow raised, most likely at the fact he had said 'us'. "Oh, I didn't mean us in that way, I meant, you know er- I just didn't think..."
It was just Draco.
Harry groaned, running a hand through his hair. He knew he was stupid, he didn't need Hermione to confirm that again. "Yes, I know, I know, I definitely regret it now."
"You don't need to swear to prove it to me. I've seen your work, it's usually... okay, but this," Draco pointed to it. "This is appalling."
"Well, not entirely."
Draco mumbled out a feeble, "Sorry," but then remembered who he was: a Malfoy, and Malfoys didn't back down.
be going back tonight to retrieve his wand. That was it. Take the wand and leave. Nothing more.
It went silent again before Harry decided that enough was enough, and made a (very tough) decision to let go of Draco's hand. "Why'd you let go?"
"No, of course not, though it was a bit difficult for me to try and hide this from Hermione. Next time, somewhere less exposed would be better." Harry's grin grew wider, but Draco's eyes were at full alert from Harry's words. Harry's smile started to leave seeing Draco's face as his brows furrowed. "What? Did I say something wro—"
Harry didn't ponder on it for too long though, and ran his hands through Draco's hair, savouring the softness of it, and let out a groan as Draco's hands made their way under his shirt. "Shit, Draco, what are we doing?" Harry breathed out, looking into Draco's dilated pupils.
He shook his head frantically, wiping off his proud expression and putting on one that hopefully seemed innocent. "Oh, no, nothing."
"Oh. Will I see you later then?"
The cogs in Harry's brain immediately started to turn, searching the contact book of his brain to locate someone who he wasn't too close to, and able to kiss without catching feelings.
"Malfoy." Harry greeted, and Draco despised the way his heart did a double take realising Harry was there. "Why were you glaring at Ginny?"
"Yes, only now, I wouldn't take back anything that happened between him and I." He snapped in a way that made her wince but he instantly regretted it and calmed down. "I'm sorry, you did nothing wrong, I shouldn't be taking this out on you when you're just trying to help." He apologised in a rush. "I'm just... mad, I guess. Mad at him, but more mad at myself for being so naïve and trusting him. He's Draco Malfoy for God's sake and I
"Malfoy?" He shouted, way too loud, causing heads to turn, especially from the Slytherin table
She had suspected that Harry was having a fling with someone; after finding out the 'bruises' on his neck were hickies and that's why he had been so embarrassed about the topic, but she hadn't thought he could be bisexual, or any other sexualities, but then she had never asked, so it wasn't anybody's fault. "Who is he?" She curiously asked, not many names coming to her head of who Harry could've become infatuated with.
"Miss Granger has enough responsibilities." Snape's answer was firm. "Potter's grades must improve before the next Potion's exam. Repeat everything I said to him as soon as you can." Snape walked away, once again giving no time for Draco to respond, or protest, even though he wouldn't have been able to either way.
Dumb.
"What is it Potter?"
Crap.
"Thanks." Harry mumbled, shuffling closer to Draco. He hesitantly wrapped an arm around Draco's torso, ready to retract his hand back if Draco felt uncomfortable and slowly moved until his lower half was in line with Draco's. "Uh, tell me at any time if you want me to stop." Draco had never heard Harry's voice go that low, but it sent vibrations down him as he felt Harry's lips softly brush his neck.
Instantly, the class went silent, everybody watching the miracle of a lifetime:
He was going to do it:
"Yeah." A specific one actually.
Snape had still kept Draco and Harry next to each other, unaware of the relationship between the two of them. Their whole class was ready to brew the Befuddlement Draught, something that would make anyone who drank it act a bit reckless, or belligerent.
Draco got it now, his mouth falling open as a slight tinge of red appeared on his cheeks. "Oh."
write about it doesn't make sense."
"Did what work?"
Pansy looked up, her eyes wide at Draco's question. "What?"
"Randomly kissing someone is not nothing."
"Is that a yes then?"
"Yeah, he's been gone for the past week."
He just didn't realise
Again with the use of Harry.
Harry shrugged, giving him a lazy smile. "Yeah, sure, like me sometimes."
"No, how about now? She's just walked in, call her over."
And he had forgotten all about it that he had made no effort to change or modify it. "It's not
In truth, he did still feel faint, but not because of the potion.
thing harder than it needed to be.
"It would be nice?"
"I'm not." Harry proved by shuffling closer to Draco, letting their hands skim each other.
"Don't stress, I'm sure you'll do really well, you're already so smart." Harry complimented, liking the way her cheeks went rosy.
is who Draco picked over me? Harry Potter: the one who lived, the one who'll bring justice to the world... the one who likes to take it up the arse."
"Are you going to freeze again?"
"Do you have any in mind right now?"
Draco immediately pushed Harry's hand away from his face, burying his face in his hands. "No."
"I knew this would happen, I knew it."
Harry let out a loud sigh, walking towards Draco, "You are exasperating."
"Why not? You can call me Draco. I can always just call you Harry when we're alone then, and we're alone now, so I'll call you Harry. Harry Potter." All Draco was saying made sense, but every time he said Harry's name, Harry was triggered back to that short night.
"None of your business, Malfoy." I carried on walking, praying that he'd take the hint, and for once in his life, act as a decent human being, but he didn't. Instead, I heard his footsteps coming closer towards me before he grabbed my shoulder, pushing me roughly against the wall.
"No we didn't." Draco shot back for no reason.
But Draco had already dragged Harry away with him, a scowl on his face. "Don't ask any questions." Draco immediately ordered, sensing the long list of questions that Harry would have.
"I know." Harry sighed, looking down at the ground. "You were joking though, right?" He kicked at the ground, slightly lifting his head to peek at Draco.
"I need to piss." He pushed Harry's arms off of him, feeling his voice came out as a squeak, and thanked Merlin for the dim lighting that was in the room right now.
Harry glanced up, feigning a look of surprise as he let out a chuckle, stepping to the side. "Oh wow, what a coincidence. Well, now I'm here, I might as well wait for you."
Draco shook his head in disbelief at the brown haired boy, wondering if he had somehow been drugged with a love potion. He was tempted to pull out his wand but resisted the desire to, and stayed with his hands by his side, his fingers itching to pull his wand out in the case of an emergency.
"Hm." Homosexuality wasn't as looked down upon as it was in the muggle world, but that didn't mean that homophobia didn't still exist. Especially in more conservative families: like the Malfoys. If they were so fixated on blood status, and having a legacy, Hermione was quite sure that they'd also have strong views on homosexuality. "I say do talk to him later, but for now, keep your distance. You might need a bit of time to think through what this means. You two were never official, of course, but by what you've said, it's obvious you two were just an unlabelled couple." Hermione told him truthfully and sat back down, Harry sitting next to her again.
"The Snitch has been spotted! Look at the seekers go! Draco Malfoy's catching up but... HE'S DONE IT! HARRY POTTER HAS CAUGHT THE GOLDEN SNITCH ONCE AGAIN!"
"Because it's what Dumbledore wanted, we can't question it."
Snape raised his brow at him before turning back to Harry. He opened his mouth and started to speak but Draco didn't bother paying attention to any of the words that came out of Snape's mouth, instead only watching Harry who glanced at Draco a few times, folding his arms. Snape's lecture was cut short, Neville calling out for help about his potion that kept changing colours, leading to Snape leaving them with a warning look towards Harry who, if it was possible, seemed even more deflated.
"Take it as you want." He simply replied, communicating for Harry to continue speaking. To elaborate on what he meant by needing help.
"I didn't mean that."
"Oops?"
When Harry finished rewriting the first lines of his essay, he passed it to Draco, looking at his face for any clues on how he felt about it. "Is it better? Does it seem more legible than the first one? I tried to use the tips you gave me so I–"
Hermione could see Harry's shoulders slightly relax, understanding that he wasn't going to get a lecture or a fight from her at the fact he had told her it was Draco. "As much as you'd love to, don't hex him, it's not entirely his fault, I shouldn't have read into things that weren't there."
Draco spun around to look at Harry, shrugging off the hand on his shoulder. "I don't know, okay, I just– I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that."
Harry slightly gaped until he looked in Draco's eyes, seeing the lust in them– but they shouldn't.
"At least a kiss to make it better?"
Harry didn't trust his voice to speak so shook his head, rubbing his palms on his trousers and watching as Draco came closer to him.
"Like what?"
"Looks like you've got your feistiness back." I felt him touch my robes and was about to look down when he placed his fingers under my chin, forcing me to look back up. I hadn't realised how close he had gotten and the words that I had been planning on saying were all swallowed back down. I didn't want to, I really didn't want to, but as Malfoy licked his lips, my stare went to them, being reminded of how soft they were on mine the night before. As soon as that thought ran through my head, I quickly turned my head to the side, feeling uncomfortable by my own thoughts. Malfoy being the bastard he was, noticed and grabbed my face, turning it to face his. And if it wasn't just my imagination making it up, I could've sworn it was like he was about to kiss me, but as if he realised where he was, he stopped, instead leaning in for his lips to brush my ear. "Scared, Potter?" He teased, but his voice didn't have the same tone to it as before.
"No." Harry lied. "You wouldn't pick him over me anyways, he's a Ravenclaw."
No, not unfortunately, that was fortunate, Draco tried to convince himself.
Draco stayed silent and as Harry turned back to him, the smile seemed to have vanished, replaced by a calculating look. "Who are these... lessons for?" Draco asked out of the blue.
She paused, as if Harry could say something back, before she let out a chilling laugh. "You're nothing but a half blood, not even fully pure." She moved closer to him, poking his cheek harshly. "How should we sort this out then? Maybe we should do it the muggle way. You did have a muggle mother didn't you?" Pansy then covered her mouth with her hand, pretending like she'd revealed something by accident. "Oh, silly me, I forgot she died before she could even teach you any of her special muggle mannerisms. Good riddance, I suppose, though bad luck for you. Stuck with a different family of muggles."
Harry had been hanging on to every tip Draco had given, tugging lightly on Draco's bottom lip, hearing a small groan as they shoved their work out of the way. Harry pushed Draco down to the ground, removing his lips from Draco's and placing them on his neck, kissing him slowly. "Wait, you know how to give hickeys?" Draco questioned between pants, feeling Harry's mouth sending tingles everywhere in his body.
Draco opens up to a confused Harry who is having second thoughts about his sexuality.
Harry was striding away, trying to avoid any contact with Draco whilst Draco was the opposite, frantically trying to catch up.
Harry's smile dropped as he realised Hermione was serious. "I was joking Hermione. You're not actually going to ask him, are you?" Harry felt his palms clam up thinking of Hermione confronting Draco.
"The boy who's almost been killed every year." Harry thought Draco was offended but then a small smile broke out on his face. "Sounds reasonable to me I guess."
"It's a muggle saying." Harry explained proudly at knowing something Draco didn't. "Heard it from one of the second year's so I asked them what it meant."
Harry actually looked guilty and glanced down at the ground, kicking a rock underneath his foot that seemed to frown at his rude attack.
"So am I." Draco smiled genuinely, but then a second later added, "That we've gone from enemies to lovers."
Harry instantly stopped writing, turning his head to look at Draco. "What?"
Harry pressed into Draco... grinding into him... Draco's moa-
bad."
Draco chuckled, "Maybe you should recommend Snape some books, might loosen him up." He spoke, before confidently striding into the classroom whilst a less eager Harry followed behind him sluggishly.
Time for him to leave, he decided, before Granger would dig deeper and unravel all the secrets he'd been wrapping up. "I'll see you later Granger." He didn't wait for her reply and walked away as quick as he could without running.
Harry's anger washing away, he started to take account of how closed off Draco looked, his knees tucked into his chest whilst he
"Maybe he's thinking of ways to hex you?" Ron gave his input, but it sounded more like "Mwaybe ees tinking of weys to ex yu?" due to the food in his mouth.
"What?" Had Harry gone mad?
"I'm sorry, I didn't know if something happened to you or..." Harry's sentence trailed off as he still carried on looking at the ground. "And I had the Maurader's map so I knew... I'm sorry, I'm so stupid."
True to Hermione's word, Ginny walked in with Luna, the two of them looking to be in a deep conversation. Harry caught Ginny's eye and waved her over, separating her from Luna who went and sat with Neville whilst Ginny came to sit next to Harry.
Harry himself looked kind of pained but he didn't say anything else and instead nodded.
"What? Why?" Draco's voice sounded genuinely panicked, causing Harry to freeze. "I meant uh- Where to?" He tried to adopt a less needy tone but it was already too late.
"I need to tell you something later Ron." Harry whispered as soon as Snape turned his back to the class, writing something on the chalkboard.
Draco was in deep.
Draco decided to echo him too, finalising the conversation. "
"Harry?"
And that's how Harry and Draco ended up sneaking into the Forbidden Forest, talking for the rest of the night.
It was all Draco's fault, definitely. If he hadn't have stolen Harry's homework, then Harry wouldn't have been late, then Snape wouldn't have been in an even worse mood and Harry wouldn't have been so angry and stupidly messed up the potion so yes, it all started with Draco.
"I just thought you'd be happy to know."
He had completely forgotten to put a glamour charm on this morning; waking up late had made him rush to get ready, forgetting all about any evidence on him that could expose what had happened last night.
Pansy didn't know if she should laugh or ask Draco if he'd gone crazy. "What? Why?"
And there went the happiness that Harry had been feeling from before. He took a good look at Draco: his posture was more stiff as the eye bags under his eyes seemed to have increased. There was no sign of light in those thunderstorm eyes, just an impatient Draco eager to get away from Harry as quickly as possible. "Potter?" Harry questioned, they were back to last names?
Draco stopped, facing Harry with a brow raised. "
"Don't."
"Oh, it's you Potter." Draco was relieved. Harry had been avoiding him the whole day, and after letting him into his dorm
Pansy let out a loud sigh for Draco to hear but he heard her footsteps fade away, indicating she'd listened. Draco turned back to Harry, his heart doing a leap seeing how cute Harry's tousled hair looked, but before Harry could speak, or reject him, Draco put in his own words first. "That was just practise, right?"
"Miss Granger and Mr Weasley, out now. You'll see your friend later." Snape's voice was stern, not turning around to face them.
"No!" Draco practically exclaimed, shaking his head. "No." He said more softer this time, burying his hands in his face. "No." He repeated for the third time, despite Harry hearing the other two times.
Harry winced at his word choice, but it was Draco Malfoy he was talking about. The boy obsessed with blood status; of course he wouldn't be fully open to the idea of two boys kissing. "It's not that I want to necessarily kiss you, it's that I want to practise and since we're not friends, there's no feelings attached."
Begging to be friends with the chosen one.
"Yes sir."
His mind was telling him to stay sitting down but his mouth was already halfway through an excuse, standing up. "–but maybe we can practise some Quidditch together on Saturday if you're doing nothing?"
Despite Draco's heavy reluctance to share the invisibility cloak with Harry, saying "Unlike you, I am actually able to sneak around without being seen." Harry had won the argument, saying he felt bad and it was "just in case" which had led to them being squished side by side, Harry stepping on Draco's feet a lot, and Draco being engulfed in Harry's warmth.
"I didn't expect it." Harry breathed out, his eyes still darting to Draco's slightly puffier lips.
Draco quickly stood up, tucking the note in his pocket, unsure if
"Really? You'll tutor me?" Harry's tone turned buoyant– Draco hearing the smile without even looking at him.
"No, stop it." Draco shook his head, desperately trying to communicate to Snape with his mind to hurry up. "Er- how long until it's ready?"
"Yes, Malfoy. You're being too loud." Harry was desperate for people to not know about this, and from the way Ron kept muttering profanities about Draco, he was sure people would start to suspect that something was up.
He would tell Harry tonight then.
Draco was not giving an explanation for why and simply remained silent so Pansy thought out loud, "Why not then?"
Harry covered his ears, dreading the reminder. "Please don't remind me."
"Ugh for fuck's- I don't know Malfoy, what do you even bloody want? A snake or something? Or maybe a handshake would better satisfy you?" Harry snapped. He was just fed up. (He'd even rather be back where he was before, attempting to kiss Hermione.)
Sitting on his bed, he truly took in his thoughts.
"Yeah, him. We're going to Hogsmeade this weekend–"
"Be quiet."
"I said shut it Malfoy." Harry hissed, finally turning to look at Draco. Draco could no longer see that excited gleam Harry used to have sparkling in his emerald eyes, instead, it was replaced by the dull look that Harry was giving him.
"Have you found your wand yet?" Hermione asked Harry as they walked to dinner.
That someone was Hermione.
"Yeah, course." Harry nodded, a polite smile on his face as Jack went to leave, but as soon as Jack had turned his back, Harry's smile disappeared scarily quick. "What do you need?"
And then there was his saviour, always Harry Potter, and instead of calming him that Harry was safe and okay, he felt even worse. Why couldn't he ever just be strong without anyone else having to help him?
Perhaps it had been building up for weeks now, or the hug had triggered it, but Draco didn't want to resist this
"You can't ignore me forever."
"No, you're only friends with him, he thinks the world of you and you know that." Her unsettlingly deep brown eyes stared right into his soul, trying to uncover all the secrets that he had pushed to the back of his mind.
And for once, Harry and Draco both shared a mutual confusion that took over the silence in the tower.
The shame and regret that passed through Draco was indescribable. The look on Harry's face heightened it; he didn't know if Harry looked like he wanted to laugh in his face or ask if this was a different person under Polyjuice, masking as Draco.
"I'm not stupid Malfoy, I know you don't want that either. I see the way you talk with him, I've never seen you so at ease before and I'm not saying you're my first choice on who I'd want Harry to be with, but if you make Harry happy, then I'm not gonna stop him. Just don't ever hurt him."
Draco stopped laughing, just to choke out a, "Nope," before carrying on.
He tried to stay awake, but with nobody to talk to, and matching the slow breathing pace of Harry, it was impossible for him to not allow his eyes to close, which, if he had been more focussed, he would've questioned himself at how easily he had found it to fall asleep, compared to the other days where he would be up all night.
"What happened? I just remember making it out of the classroom, that's it."
Harry's eyes slowly opened as Draco didn't know if he was mumbling to himself, or Draco. "Malfoy... stop– sleep, with me. Sleep." Draco's mouth slightly gaped at Harry's words, secretly smirking inside.
Draco shrugged, blocking out how close they were, "Okay, I'll leave it then."
"Cool?" Harry repeated, clearly confused.
"Speak up." Snape ordered although Harry was sure he heard. "I lost it." Harry said louder, hearing a few gasps coming from where the Hufflepuffs were sitting.
There stood Draco with his back turned to the world, stargazing out the window. Harry forgot all about his big revealing plan until a voice cut through the silence.
Context: Draco had just finished his Quidditch practise and Harry 'happened' to be there, conveniently standing right in front of Draco's bags whilst simultaneously pretending to be occupied by a speck on his wand.
He'd had it in Potions, that was the last class he could remember using it in, but then afterwards...
"Oh actually, that may have come out wrong. I do like Ginny, but just as a friend."
"Yeah." Draco agreed half heartedly, too lazy to have an argument about different houses.
"But–" Thank Merlin. "We both agreed that we're better off as friends, I guess I had just mistaken my crush for something bigger, and anyways I think I like–" Harry stopped suddenly, glancing down at the floor.
Harry relaxed a bit, feeling some of the tension leave the area. "I'm sorry about today again."
"You're acting childish."
"Mr Malfoy. Just the person I needed." On hearing that voice, Draco stood up straight, looking to see Snape who had managed to erase the warmth Draco had been feeling. Snape didn't wait for a response from Draco and continued to talk. "You are an acquaintance of Potter, I've heard–"
"You're fit." Draco tried again, dropping the insults whilst attempting to peek over to see what Harry was reading.
"He's not my boyfriend."
Harry didn't understand what Ron was saying so just thanked Ron and Hermione both before starting to head towards the changing rooms until he saw Ginny, a smile lighting up on his face. "Hey Ginny."
"What? You don't even know him?" Harry looked a mix between offended and concerned. "Are you sure he hasn't drugged you or something?"
"Let's go outside, there'll be less people there." She linked her arm with Harry, leading him outside with her.
"I know you were a victim to the love potion," The blood ran to Harry's cheeks: whether from embarrassment or frustration, Draco guessed both. "–due to your lack of accurate brewing skills, but it doesn't mean that everyone is the same."
All Harry could think about was that... and the knowledge that he had somehow been turned on by it.
So now the Weaselbee had learnt how to whisper.
"And I didn't need to. We're just friends, Potter, do you want me to tell you the exact time I ate today as well while we're at it?"
, yesterday, he had avoided Draco at all costs, ignoring Draco's curious stares he had felt in the Great Hall.
How kind of him to ignore his question, Harry rolled his eyes.
"Huh?"
"Ron just likes his food, don't be rude, and number two, Hermione wasn't
Mental note to himself: Be more cautious around Granger.
Draco had never really seen Harry as the most judgemental person in his life (there were many more higher on the list) but in that moment right there, he felt like the judgment could crush him. "You know what, forget I said anything. I'll see you tomorrow." Draco turned around, ready to leave in mortification, but he felt a hand on his arm, stopping him. "No, wait." Harry realised how he'd sounded- rejecting Draco. "Let's go then." Harry smiled, Draco also turning back around to hide his own smile. "Okay."
Harry was saying until a pair of soft lips met his.
"Well, if it isn't Draco's one and true love." Pansy sauntered up to him, taking her time to scan him.
"You look disappointed."
"Fine, fine." Harry raised his hands in the air, a mock surrender. "I'll rewrite the first paragraph and then we'll see what's so terrible about it."
"Oh." Harry looked confused. "Then what's wrong?"
"Huh?" Harry didn't know if it were his thoughts that had said terrible or if it was Draco. Most likely the latter.
Draco had been in control of brewing the last potion they had done a couple of weeks ago so it was Harry's turn this time, yet as he stirred the scurvy grass, lovage and the sneezewort once, something didn't seem right about the colour. "It looks a bit light, doesn't it? It's meant to be dark green so I think I've done it wrong."
Draco was quiet for a few seconds, taking in what Snape had said, before questioning him. "How about Grang- Hermione?" That would surely be an easier option for both Harry and himself.
"I don't like boys." Draco interrupted, wanting to squirm at how unnatural it felt to say that.
After nearly five years, they were finally friends.
"You shall play too knight..." Harry muttered under his breath, trying to understand when it finally clicked. "Oh! Usual place tonight." He half exclaimed the words a bit louder than he had expected to, Hermione's brows furrowing at him as she stopped talking. "What?"
He felt like he was seething with green, and he hated it.
Draco didn't respond to Harry, instead he laughed.
Harry checked behind him, just in case Pansy had decided to follow him outside until he once again bumped into another person.
That was probably the closest Harry would get, and the closest Draco would allow him to. "You could say that." Draco turned away and collected the books he needed, signalling for Harry to drop the topic. Harry was still curious but he -sometimes- knew when to stop and pulled his own stuff out as well.
When he did find it, he hesitated whether he should leave something, but decided against it, and simply walked out, looking at Malfoy one last time before leaving.
"Yes you are." And to prove this, Harry placed his hands on Draco's normally cold cheeks that were now warm. "Blushing."
This time, Draco didn't waste time to be in control, his lips barely staying on Harry's before going down to his neck. Harry threw his head back against the wall, feeling Draco suck on a certain sweet spot that was making him writhe in pleasure. "Don't be–
Harry wouldn't be able to live this one down, he decided. "No, wake up now."
They were excited.
-, almost coming undone when the person let out a groan.
to kiss
"I don't understand. Why ask
Fuck.
Draco almost choked on the air at how casual Harry had said that but forced himself not to react, feeling Harry's stare checking for any slight movements he made, but he was sure he'd let something show when Harry started to chuckle. "You're properly blushing." He spoke the obvious. "Oh Merlin in the Heavens above, Draco Malfoy is blushing."
"Draco, liking boys isn't some kind of evil curse, they're just your feelings. You don't have to be so scared to accept them; they won't hurt you."
"About what?"
Harry just hadn't expected it to ache as much as it did. He had gotten on well enough for his whole life without Draco, so why did this one week without him have to affect him so much?
Harry began to shake his head, the flush that had just left his cheeks steadily coming back, "No, it's not like that. It's just a one off; I found it in my aunt's room and I was bored, so I read it. That's it." He explained, missing out the part that he actually found it interesting and had consequently made several more journeys to his Aunt's room to
"I have a grave feeling you've messed up already." Harry looked up to see Draco, and instead of noticing the way Draco's previous confidence seemed to have deteriorated or being ready to prove to Draco how well he had done the potion by himself, he found himself falling hard for him.
Harry was about to ask when the door to the bathrooms started to open.
The first instinct for Harry was to freeze, becoming a still statue. Draco assumed it was the shock at first, but when a few seconds passed, and Harry still wasn't making any moves, Draco pulled away. "Wow Potter, you really are that shit at kissing."
"I can try Accio it later if you'd like."
blue eyes that it's almost scary."
bed, curled up like he was a little baby.
Harry didn't know what she would do next; he couldn't tell in those menacing eyes of hers, but what he didn't expect to happen was for a fist to come flying into his face with no warning, landing onto his cheekbone and sending a rush of pain to wash over him.
"Harry, you're- Oh my... hilarious and...advantage- No, no." Draco's sentences were completely broken but he couldn't find it in himself to try and make a coherent one, still laughing at Harry's absurd suggestion.
"What was Granger doing?"
Draco shrugged, "I mean, I don't know? Depends on the person."
"Bloody hell Potter." Draco muttered, going to the side where he was and trying to shake him awake.
"Because you can't, so leave it Draco." Harry hadn't actually expected Draco to leave it, so when he got no reply, he looked towards Draco to see him with an almost incredulous look on his face. "What is it?" Harry asked urgently, hoping Draco hadn't somehow been able to piece the puzzle together.
Harry hesitated, peering at Jack once again who was looking between the two of them and decided he would make himself known in the three way conversation, "It's alright." He winked at Draco, surprising him so much that he didn't have time to think of anything to say back and instead just stared at him with wide eyes. "I'll see you later, yeah?" Jack directed his words to Harry this time. (Thank Merlin since Draco was still fazed by Jack's wink.)
"I think we should talk." Draco was the first one to speak, actually having the skill to whisper properly unlike Ron.
"Ten percent if you're lucky?" Harry guessed.
"Of course not." Draco stood by the side of his bed, looking at Harry who had his eyes shut, snuggling into the bed.
"No," He smiled, a sad one. "I still like you dummy–"
"Hm. It's so comfy, thanks Draco." Harry's almost luminescent eyes stared back at Draco, smiling and patting the spot next to him. "Sit." He commanded Draco like he was his house elf which Draco wouldn't have appreciated at all if it weren't for the fact Harry leaned over, dragging Draco by his arm and bringing him closer. "Lie down." Draco was going to refuse; Harry couldn't get away with ordering him around, but then he heard a small 'please' and who was Draco to refuse manners? "Turn around."
"Are you even listening to me?" Draco asked as they sat in his room, currently trying to go over the Wit sharpening potion.
"I don't... I don't particularly want us to go back to being enemies." Draco stared down at his hands as he spoke. If his father could hear what he was saying, he'd probably crucio him on the spot. "We can still be friends, just less... publicly?" He himself wasn't even sure on why he was saying this.
"Potter." Draco called for his attention but he still had that dazed look of his. "
This had been coming all along yet it still hurt Draco to hear those words. "What isn't?" He acted dumb, pretending to not understand what Harry was saying.
Harry was momentarily stunned by the Slytherin boy who was sitting down, but quickly remembered why he had practically stormed up all the way here. "No, definitely not, and I'm being civil here by apologising for how I practically er- molested you, I really wasn't in my right mind so sorry about that.”
With that, Harry looked back up, a cheesy grin growing on his face and staying there as he walked back into the hall.
Harry didn't say anything more; he didn't want to mess up or feel that same silly feeling he had before. For some reason, embarrassing himself in front of Draco always seemed to leave the worst feeling yet it was such a common occurrence.
It surely couldn't be solely because of that.
As soon as Harry got to the tower and saw Draco sitting down, he immediately requested for his wand back, hearing a snort from Draco in response. "Not even a hello, Potter?"
? What's twisting?"
Draco sat waiting in his room for Harry to come.
When the lesson came to an end, Harry was one of the first to pop out of his seats, ready to leave... until Snape called him and Draco back, saying that he needed to talk to them.
"What happened here?" Madam Pomfrey asked as soon as they walked into the infirmary. "These Qudditch games seem to be getting more and more dangerous each year." She mumbled to herself.
He was late, no surprise there, but there was a small part of Draco that didn't want Harry to show up, just so there would be no confrontation.
"How about we talk tonight? At the usual place." Draco suggested, but Harry shook his head. "I'm busy." He deliberately played on Draco's words, seeing the frown appear on Draco's face as he understood why he'd said that.
