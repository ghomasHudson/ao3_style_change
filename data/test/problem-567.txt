“Has he?” Harry said with genuine surprise. He knew absolutely nothing about Narcissa and Malfoy’s relationship. What sort of things had Malfoy said about him exactly?
Draco, for once, is shaking his head in refusal. “No, I think I’d much rather be the one sucking your cock, thanks. Too.. intense.”
“I think I want to try and pursue something—someone new. Have a proper go at a real relationship. An honest one.”
“I’m pretty sure you just called him something to do with being a whore and now you’re defending him?”
Harry sort of wonders if Fe might be up for it, he knows that Charlie’s a pretty kinky bastard himself.
“Wait, damn it,” he snapped when Malfoy made an impatient noise and went after him again.
“And what do you think I’m going to do? Jump on his cock the second we’re behind closed doors?”
It was hard to imagine that the body beneath him was Draco's when everything about it was wrong. But then Sergio squeezed the muscles in his arse around his cock. The elusive orgasm that tore out of him was almost painful. It left him panting and near shaking with irritation and slumped over a body that was distinctly lacking in sharp angels.
“Alright, enough, Potter, what the hell has crawled up your arse and died?”
He does exactly that, pours himself a nice cup of tea, adds a splash of milk, sits across the room, and picks up his book. He has to whisper, but thankfully he’s far enough away and Parseltongue is sibilant so it blends in with the wireless Aurora always has on.
Harry fumbled for his wand and eliminated the mess even as he pressed closed mouthed kisses against Malfoy’s lips. Then he clutched the other man against his chest tightly and drifted back into sleep.
“Another?” the boy asked. He looked Spanish rather than French and was going for a wide-eyed innocent look now.
“Shhhh,” Potter soothes, pressing small kisses against his arse cheeks as his finger presses in. “Gripping me so tight, look at that… No need to hurry, gorgeous, finish your work, I’m not stopping you.”
Potter doesn’t look offended. “Apparently, or maybe you’re really dense, did you consider that?”
“Yeah, so do I,” said Albus.
“Fine,” he managed. “Then what did they give you?”
“Well it’s been nice talking to you, Professor Malfoy, have a good day!” There’s no shame in running, he decides. For now at least.
Harry’s only choice is to make Draco come to him.
“Distract me,” snapped Malfoy.
“Mrs. Malfoy,” he managed as respectfully as possible, though it felt strange calling this woman by the same name as his somehow-not friend.
“Busy,” Draco snaps again, already picking up the mortar and pestle to grind up the delicate lacewing flies.
“Out,” repeated Malfoy, looking appropriately skeptical. Then he snorted, threw down the still running hosepipe and stomped back into his corner shop.
Malfoy blinked. “Because nobody else wanted me.”
“Well I happen to think you’d be quite sexy in an apron, Ron,” says Hermoine, batting her eyelashes in exaggeration.
Draco’s waving a hand, the one not holding the fork spearing a carrot slice. “No, I mean in public. In a bar. What’s the point?”
“Expelliarmus!”
“I’ve just nearly drowned because of you. Now it’s dinner.”
On the shelf, is a butt plug. His butt plug.
“I want you,” pleaded Malfoy and Harry had to shut his eyes and turn away in case that thought tempted him too much. Malfoy reached for him again, and Harry stepped away, heading for the relative safety of the sitting room.
“Yeah,” confirms Draco.
The git actually looked like he was enjoying himself. Harry narrowed his eyes. “My lot knew the rules just fine, it was your lot that was always breaking them.”
“He’s older than you.”
“Yeah, I’m training some devil’s snare for you as we speak, Potter. I’m trying to convince it to suffocate you in your sleep.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but continued to follow the other man through the suddenly thickening throng of people. The passed street magicians, and numerous shops that would have otherwise drawn Harry's attention, but Malfoy passed them all by with a purposeful single mindedness that Harry felt inclined to mimic.
Harry’s being creative with his stacking, he can feel them slide between his calf and thigh, balance on his shoulder, tucked into the ropes on his stomach, and Draco’s pretty sure Harry’s built a little house with them on his right arse cheek.
“A present.”
“I concur,” says Percy.
With great enthusiasm Harry thrust into the tight heat beneath him. Sergio gave out a long whine and hooked his legs over Harry’s shoulders, angling his arse for deeper penetration. Harry held onto the slim hips and pulled them towards his body.
“Legilimency,” states Draco finally. It’s an absurd proposal, but now it’s been proposed Draco wants it. Desperately. A chance to see inside Harry Potter’s head. Either he’ll be proved right and Potter doesn’t really see him, isn’t really invested in the way he insists he is, or… well the alternative is maybe he can have this. Have Potter.
Draco slams Harry’s diary closed with a slam, bending the lesson plans he’d been reviewing in between the pages of October. “You can leave,” he says.
Then he has to pause to drop a peck on Draco’s pouting lips. “If you like,” he says. “Besides, you were the one who was complaining about not getting to see the finished result the other night.”
“And you’d enjoy that?” Harry still can’t quite fathom it himself.
The right brow was arched already. “Just decided that did you?”
Neville sighs again. “Nah, I’m knackered, promised Hannah we’d look at paint samples for the nursery as well. Best deal with this lot then.” The sixth years are twitching as hair grows in their noses and ears and the hair on their heads goes grey and wiry. Rigby stumbles into a limp, hand on his curving back.
They break apart for another shared breath, and then Draco’s on him again, the tips of their tongues coming together as they gasp into one another’s mouths. Draco whimpers then shakes, and then…
Harry shrugged and shifted uncomfortably. He was still standing, hoping to only stay long enough to somehow make Malfoy feel better before he could make his escape. He was in desperate need of a real shower and he didn’t much like the idea of being around Malfoy after leaving another man’s company.
Harry just laughed and licked the pink frosting from the other man’s lips. “Okay, Malfoy.”
Slowly, he presses forward, kissing Draco gently, letting him decide if he wants to accept the kiss or not. Their lips touch for a moment and Draco’s part just slightly. It’s not quite the same as when he’d been under the influence of the Amortenia, but it’s just as intoxicating. Harry sucks Draco’s bottom lip and pulls him closer, desperate to show him how much he wants him.
Harry wasn’t sure if his type was cosmopolitan and attractive, and his first instinct was to say thanks by no thanks, but then he caught sight of a woman traipsing through the park trying to sell carnations to men to give to their sweethearts. So instead he shrugged and said, “Tell me about him.”
Potter huffs. “Work.”
He had liked this relationship. Matthew was fun, and easy to be around, and he cared about Harry and the things Harry liked. He had even thought about introducing Matthew to his kids, and they’d been talking about going away on a holiday together in the spring. And now Harry was confessing that he’d spent the night with another man.
“Probably,” agreed Harry.
Harry briefly closed his eyes shut as he wished for things to be different, and then went to join Malfoy on the couch. Malfoy fell into his arms easily, tucking his head beneath Harry’s chin, his pale hair tickling Harry’s lip. It wasn’t a comfortable position with Malfoy resting all of his weight on him so Harry dragged them down so that they were half-leaning half-lying against the side of the long couch.
“Of course we have a kitchen!” he grumbles, but he doesn’t mention ever having visited which is suspicious. Draco’s a big fan of the lie of omission when he doesn’t want to admit something.
It’s obvious Draco wants to complain some more, his lips twist a bit, and his eyes go a bit cross-eyed, trying to figure out a way to be contrary and still get what he wants. Finally, he gives up. “No, I like it. I like it a lot and I want to keep being your stupid tied up test dummy, I’m just boooooored.”
Nervously, he laughs along with Ron and Hermoine as she continues to make suggestions on just what Ron could be doing in his sexy apron. It’s hard to follow through, because yeah, now it feels like fingertips are skating up his torso back to tease his nipples. When he crosses a hand across his chest he can feel them poking against the fabric. It’s a little embarrassing and he doesn’t want his friends to catch on, so he leans into his crossed arms somewhat awkwardly and resists the urge to moan.
Draco hums his agreement against his ear. “I used one soapy finger, and then two. Opened up that dirty hole and cleaned out all your cum. Felt so empty without you. I thought about going to your office, grabbing my ankles and beginning you fuck me.”
“I’m sure you do,” says Draco dryly, but the tension is leaking from the room and the warmth is back in his voice again.
After following the hosepipe to the connector and making sure the water was off Harry hurried to follow him.
Beneath him, Draco is trying to thrust up, but Harry’s build is much heavier, and with his hands tied and arse full it’s not hard to pin him down by the shoulders. His hips however only start to buck more as Harry lifts himself up to line himself up and that won’t do at all.
She ignores him and continues on. “How many of them in this room have you had? How many have experienced the pleasure of your company?”
The Hogwarts Express rolls in with the usual cacophony. Owls, cats, rats, and of course, young witches and wizards of all ages spill out onto the platform. Hagrid has time to turn and say; “Here we go, gents,” before he’s striding into the thick of it bellowing for the first years.
Professor Potter’s Office
“Don’t be mean, Malfoy,” chided Harry.
“You may want to run a rope from the wrists to the ankles to help him hold his arms up. You can leave it without it if you like, but it would be a bit more of an advanced position, the arms will naturally fall forward causing additional strain on the shoulders.”
“So?” asks Harry.
If Harry had ever given any thought to actually having lunch with Draco Malfoy he wouldn’t have thought they had anything to talk about. However, the conversation flowed with surprising ease as they ate their croque madame. It was interspersed with a heavy dose of bickering, eye rolling and occasional French cursing, but it still flowed.
Although it looks as if Draco is immune to the sudden wealth of skin on display, Harry knows better. He can feel the slight falter in Draco’s otherwise precise movements, and he’s sure there’s tenting in the front of Draco’s trousers. But the man remains almost clinical in his task, not even lingering when he moves behind Harry and massages down Harry’s back, ending at the very top of his arse.
“Thank you for your help today, gentlemen,” says McGonagall from where she sits in her purple armchair.
Draco’s form is impeccable, he’s a fantastic technical dueler. Harry’s the opposite, the practical wins in his book every time, but then again he’s spent most of his life duelling for his life so by the time he’d had time to go and learn the basics he’d already defeated Voldemort. His instructors had been less picky then.
There was no resisting the twitch that hit Harry’s lips, but he did manage to not allow it to bloom into a full smile. He couldn’t believe how long he’d forgotten the memory. It could probably fuel his next Patronous. “Barty Crouch Junior.”
Thursday, September 13
Draco snickers. “Made it to the loo then did you? And who cares, that sweater was horrible on you, baggy and ill-fitting. I’ll buy you a new one.”
Malfoy looked wounded, his mouth was opening and shutting in indignation. “I’m always alone!” He said finally.
“Excuse me, not all the students, only certain students, thank you. That Felix Rosier, I could write a novel on the pertness of his arse cheeks alone.”
Harry scoffs and pushes Draco back. “Shut the hell up about that, Malfoy. No one gives a toss about that except you, you idiot. I’ve got your potion so you can untwist alright?”
“Dinner,” he prompts again.
“Yeah,” agreed Draco. “And he had a habit of seducing and sneaking off with young men, ruining the marriage contracts their parents had set up for them. The Sacred Twenty-Eight had him imprisoned after they found young Lord Selwyn strung up in the attic swallowing Percy’s cock.”
This time Draco nods without any hesitation.
Fingers squeeze into his cheeks, massaging them. He can feel Potter’s hair tickling the skin there. Potter teases the tip of his tongue against his rim, circling and circling and circling until Draco can’t stand it anymore and pushes back against Potter’s face with a growl.
“What?” asked Malfoy in that still odd voice.
Lily skipped up several minutes later with a bouquet she had made on her own. It contained at least a dozen different types of flowers and barely fit in her tiny hand. Malfoy tossed aside his newspaper and proceeded to advise Lily on how to arrange her collection to the best aesthetic. Several pink ribbons were included in the ordeal and Malfoy was instantly forgiven in Harry’s mind.
“Yeah, okay, I see,” says Harry. He’s not talking to Draco, who has a silencing charm on him again.
Draco takes great care in warming the substance in his hands before reaching out and massaging it into Harry’s skin, first up each of his calves, then beneath the edge of his robe into his thighs. By the time Draco’s untying the cotton robe and pulling the ends apart Harry is hard again and leaking against his belly.
Potter’s hard in his trousers, a side effect of the full body bind. It’s not the most pleasant feeling, Draco knows from experience. He’s not even sure Potter will be able to cum as it’s not a real erection. It is, however, hard enough for what he needs it for.
Still kneeling at his feet, Draco turns his gaze upward and Harry shivers with the thought of what happens next. It is, Harry must admit, his favorite part of Draco’s very specific set-up.
Ron doesn’t notice her leaving, as he’s still regarding Harry with concern and confusion.
Draco’s tried to explain it before, but Harry’s pretty sure he’s just a shameless exhibitionist.
By all rights, the duel is Harry’s, all he needs to do is disarm Draco while his tongue is still too tied to verbalize his next spell, but then three nonverbals hit him in quick succession. He stumbles, loses his duelling stance, and before he can correct himself Draco’s back on his feet.
Harry frowned. “The Ministry took your father’s money first of all, not yours, and they gave you enough to make a proper start of it.”
Saturday, November 24
It’s not hard to centre himself, to dip into that hidden well of calm and balance on the edge he needs to invade another’s mind. Everything around him blurs and he shifts all his focus on staring deep into Potter’s bright eyes, lifts his wand and says; “Legilimens.”
A brique noise,a clipping of impatient feet, made Harry look up again. Malfoy was staring at him and sighing heavily.
He’s not entirely sure what he’s done, not entirely sure what he feels other than sharp rejection.
“Not even enough for a deposit on a flat?” finished Malfoy. “Exactly. It was enough cash for a train ticket from London to Paris, enough to buy myself a hotel for a weekend, and enough to get me drunker than I’ve ever been in my life. And that’s it.”
“Do you like your Dark Mark?” he asks.
“Does it have a cooker though?” he asks. A lot of magical houses don’t, he’s discovered. This is why so many witches and wizards he knows don’t know how to cook properly until they get their wands. “Or do the elves just do everything with magic?” Draco suspiciously doesn’t answer, which either means he doesn’t like the answer, or he doesn’t know. “Grimmauld Place has a cooker. A whole proper kitchen even.”
Harry made it all the way to the door before hearing one last, “See you, Potter.” He didn’t turn around.
“When I was exiled from England,” corrected Malfoy with a sharp hiss.
“Heya, Harry,” says Neville. “Meant to ask, how’d the board meeting go this morning?”
He bobs shallowly, and Harry can’t help thrusting a bit, letting his cock head pop in and out of that mouth, feeling the cool air and Draco’s breath on his wet skin whenever he pulls out. It’s near perfect, but Draco’s hands are roving again, massaging his balls, tickling just behind them, pressing on his taint, then back to his hips. It’s annoyingly distracting and when Draco tugs slightly at his pubic hair, Harry’s had enough.
“I thought you hated this bloody portrait,” grumbles Draco.
“What?” Harry very nearly laughed in surprise. “No. No I am not.”
“You asked Dervish to spell a dildo for you?” How is Harry going to show his face in Hogsmeade when it comes out who Draco buys all of his dirty little trinkets for.
Malfoy did not seem surprised by this. “Tried to pick a place that was the furthest from Wizarding Paris without being in the suburbs?” he asked.
Harry presses his thumb to Draco’s slack mouth and strokes his bottom lip. He has such a lovely mouth, wide with full lips. Draco stares at him for a moment before hesitantly flicking a tongue against the invading thumb.
They’re staring at one another over the dining room table in Draco’s rooms. Their forgotten dinner plates are pushed to the side, half-finished, the dessert untouched in Draco’s exuberance upon hearing that Harry hasn’t prepared his lessons for tomorrow. They’d not woken up together, but had met up for lunch and hadn’t left one another's presence since, not even when Harry had had to fetch his work from his tower office.
“Sentences?” snaps Draco.
“Ron, you promised you wouldn’t bring this up,” Hermione adds, tight lipped. She gestures meaningfully to the babe on her hip and rolls her eyes when Ron fails to grasp the significance and plows onward.
“I spoke French.”
Malfoy shot him a level look. “You have to.”
“Yes, he tells me that your children are very fine indeed. He speaks of them quite fondly.”
“Why?” asked Lauren, clearly not understanding. Perhaps she did not know as much about Malfoy as Harry had thought.
He shoots a diffinido at the tentacle grasping his ankle and kicks back to the surface, desperate for a breath.
The clock on the wall reads ‘Office Hours’, but no one had signed up for a chat. Draco had checked.
Draco howls into his gag, thrashing his hips. His cock is impossibly, starting to thicken again, particularly with the way Potter is drinking him in. He must not have been able to see him then.
That will be the little snake sliding under Draco’s trousers and up his leg.
Room of Requirement
Malfoy was opening the cabinets, apparently to locate a cup and saucer. He’d already turned the kettle on. “No espresso pot?” he asked.
The room wasn’t a large one, and it had the same stone floor as the rest of the castle, but all four walls, the door, and the ceiling were all gigantic mirrors. The only blemish was where Percy himself hung, but perhaps when Harry grew more confident they could leave him behind.
Draco’s already rutting gently against his hip, his mouth working at Harry’s shoulder, but he lifts his head up enough to answer. “I thought you knew by now? I’m terribly rich.”
Harry shivers, his cock twitches in his trousers though he’s not hard yet. If Draco keeps pressing soft kisses in that spot though, he will be soon.
Eventually Malfoy’s lips snapped shut with his paper and he was gesturing for Harry to pay the bill already so they could take the Métro across the city.
He gasps into the table and he’s sure there’s drool there now, his face is sticky and messier than it was before. He can feel the euphoria spread through his whole body, radiating out from his pulsing cock to his arsehole, down his legs and up his arms.
Potter has to get on his tiptoes to kiss his stretched lips. He wipes the tears from the corners of Draco’s eyes and unhooks the gag. Draco immediately tries to bite him, but Potter’s too quick.
“Looks fine,” he said, giving the lettuce a glance.
He hadn’t realized how much he had missed that eyebrow. “That’s ridiculous even for you, Potter.” Malfoy turned back to Harry’s counter. He was only making enough tea for one, so Harry grabbed the chipped mug for himself and nudged him over.
Malfoy huffed. “Yes, but he didn’t know that,” he said with a shake of his head in Harry’s direction.
And ah, yes, fertility spell. Probably doesn’t do a pureblood family any good to find a way to get their homosexual sons off easier without involving a woman unless there’s somehow an heir out of the deal.
Draco, the utter shit, is smiling with his teeth showing, but he doesn’t even bother going for his wand when Harry sends an incarcerous his way.
Harry took the opportunity to size up the man as he hadn’t that other night. He was tall, several inches taller than Malfoy, who was already taller than Harry. And he was sort of…dashing. Harry couldn’t think of another word to describe it. He moved easily, and confidently, and was clearly charming if the way the people around him were acting was any indication. And he had Malfoy eating out of the palm of his hand. Sometimes even literally, which was also disgusting.
Harry chuckled and stared at his Auror partner. Adrien really did look ridiculous in that dress.
And okay, the kissing is good. That can stay, but he definitely doesn’t want to hold hands under the breakfast table.
Harry cradles Draco’s face with his palm as he moves his thumb in gentle thrusting motions. Draco’s cheek is slightly prickly beneath his fingers. He must have been worried to have forgotten grooming charms this morning, he’s normally so meticulous. Slowly, slowly, with Harry’s fingers stroking his cheek, Draco relaxes. His eyes fall shut as he concentrates on lavishing attention on Harry’s thumb and his body presses Harry’s against the wall.
Bars were easier than parties. At parties he felt the need to prove that he was a productive member of society, by making witty and hopefully intellectual conversational. At bars he only needed to prove he was interested in moving this to a secondary location.
As usual, Draco ignores Harry’s obvious erection, even when it is practically twitching against his arm. Instead Draco massages the lotion into Harry’s stomach, then chest, then up and over his shoulders where he knocks the rest of the robe from Harry’s upper body. Once his arms are carefully removed, the remaining material falls around the circular stool, still captured under Harry’s arse and thighs, but no longer covering his body.
“What’s that mean then?” asked Harry after the third round of embarrassment.
“Would you like to keep it, I mean,” asks Harry. He has to be careful to maintain eye contact, to not give Draco a chance to look away. It’s a bit like staring down a real dragon, which Harry knows from experience. You can’t show fear.
Merlin. What is he getting himself into?
Harry sighed as he watched the other man turn around and head for the door. “See you, Draco.”
“I like him. He’s got experience.” And the way he says experience like that, ‘experience’, gets Harry hot under the collar. Like Harry’s experience isn’t even in the same realm.
So, yeah. Harry’s getting the cold shoulder.
“Coffee first,” he had said by way of an introduction, so Harry had ordered himself an espresso and a croissant. Malfoy had ordered something that came in a tall clear glass and was overflowing with whipped cream. Thankfully he had read the front page of his newspaper and ignored the looks Harry kept sending his cream covered lips.
The summer went by faster than Harry wanted it too. Every day he was aware he was losing time with his children. They filled July with jaunts to the French countryside, interspersed with lazing around Harry’s flat or Malfoy’s flower shop. Lily’s collection of bouquets grew until Harry’s entire flat began to resemble a florist shop itself, and James and Albus were routinely roped into acting Junior Associates, as Malfoy liked to call them. Harry rather felt that Malfoy was just taking advantage of available child labor, but Malfoy steadfastedly assured him he was teaching valuable business skills.
“And how much more do I get?” Frederick asks as he pushes at Harry’s collar.
“I cheated on Ginny,” admitted Harry. “A lot. With a lot of different men. I hated myself for it, and I deserve every hurtful thing she ever said to me. I broke up my family and lost more friendships than I can count, I never wanted to be that person again.”
“Have you changed your mind then?” he asks, then wishes he hadn’t when Draco’s eyes narrow.
Lily and Albus exchanged grins and scampered away, James rolled his eyes and continued on in a fashionably slow pace.
It’s impossible to keep Draco very far from his thoughts, not with his gift resting against his chest. Hermoine noted it instantly, eyes flicking down with a curious frown, then darting between Harry’s eyes and back down again. For whatever reason, she’s not commenting, and Harry’s thankful. If Ron notices he’ll have a field day, no doubt. Harry certainly hadn’t given him any breaks when Lav Brown had gifted him with jewellery in the fifth year.
“Just the one leg then. Next time we’re doing it in your office with the TV, I want to watch Come Dine With Me again.”
“But you left, didn’t you?” said Harry.
Harry opens his eyes in time to catch sight of Draco licking the last traces of cum from his lips.
Draco leans back and arches against him. “I love the mirrors. Thank you for that. But now I want to know how you’re going to take care of that,” and fuck, his nimble fingers, even tied, have managed to feel out Harry’s hard cock.
Draco shrugs. “He’s not real, he’s just a portrait.”
“Right,” Harry said when Malfoy didn’t look up for several minutes. “I’ll just be going then. Happy birthday, Malfoy.”
“I like to watch you fuck that tight arse of yours,” says Percy shamelessly. “Far more fun for me.”
Remaining naked, the boy trounced out of the room to the kitchen. Harry could hear the now familiar sound of espresso being made on a hob and what also sounded like eggs frying in a pan.
“Malfoy,” he whines. “I can’t.”
“Interesting,” says Draco as Pervy Percy moans; “Oh do invite him to tea, I’d love a reunion.”
Draco whimpers as a card goes off against his belly button, he tenses up so much that he swings a bit in his bondage. And despite it all, he’s relentlessly hard, cock leaking, pointing down to the bed beneath him, probably leaking shamelessly on the duvet.
Monday, October 8
“And you’ve done this before?” he asks Draco, who looks as casual as can be.
“Alright, mate?”
With the armoire out the way, they can get at the boxes in the corner, the ones McGonagall had been looking for to pull the credentials of an old student that the Ministry has requested information on.
“Tell me about your shower,” says Harry, letting his eyes close. With Draco’s hand steadily teasing his shaft it’s easy to relax and imagine he’s there, with Draco, standing in his steamy green-tiled shower, watching him soap up with that poncy gel of his.
Harry’s shocked, Draco’s never so much as offered to make him a cup of tea. After this morning, he certainly hadn’t thought Draco would be in the mood for any type of kindness.
“So?”
Harry frowned. “What do you mean keep?”
The Room of Requirements had been Harry’s idea. Draco hadn’t been keen on it at first, but when he had complained about not knowing what he had looked like suspended, Harry knew it would be perfect.
“Could be worse,” he points out. “Could have taken Playwitches offer to become a centrefold couldn’t I?” He waggles his brows and leans closer to Hermoine until Ron has had enough and pushes him back.
“Oh, what do we have here?” Potter’s found his cock is what, and despite himself, Draco’s getting hard at the attention.
He is very much looking forward to the retribution.
“Oy, hands to yourself, Potter, my wife doesn’t need anything to do with Playwitch thanks.”
“Too much,” whines Harry, pushing him off, which sends Draco rocking back. “Oh, look at that.”
Harry doesn’t say anything, they both know the law well enough, but he does look up enough to see Draco’s eyes looking back at him. They’re shining.
Great Hall, Head Table
“They’re staring at you,” Draco whispers against the rim of his whiskey glass.
“Shh,” soothes Potter, rubbing the tears from his face. “Tell me you can do it, one more, for me. I want to watch.”
“I thought you were chaperoning today?” asks Harry, knowing that somewhere nearby Neville is probably having a right time with his lot and would probably appreciate the Potion Master’s help since whatever the seventh years have taken is almost certainly potions related.
“Now, ‘vous estes incroyable sir et je suis idiot,” said Malfoy.
“Why?” asked Harry even as Malfoy stood. Somehow he felt he had completely lost control of this conversation, although he doubted he had ever had any control to begin with.
Harry shrugs. “He’s growing on me, and you were right. He is experienced. I’m learning so much.”
Which of course leads to the first time, then the second, then the third. And wow, they have fucked a lot.
Harry laughed. Good was an understatement. He reached a hand up to pull the boy’s head down and rewarded him with a lazy kiss. “Good, yes,” he said once the boy pulled away. “Muy bueno.”
There’s a litany of words spilling from Draco’s silent lips. Either begging for more, or cursing Harry’s name, either is equally plausible. Harry gives the vibrator one last twist and then swings his legs over Draco’s hips, grinding their cocks together. He moans and rubs himself against Draco’s pretty pink cock. It’s longer than his but narrower, and his skin is much paler next to Harry’s.
“This is all that there is,” snapped Malfoy. He was sitting very, very still.
Yes, he wants to say, do it, but he can’t so he hums and sucks and licks instead and the second Harry tenses and he feels his cock tighten in his mouth, the beads are pulled viciously from his arse, rubbing relentlessly against his prostate. He screams as he cums and as he does Harry pulls him forward by the ropes until Harry’s cockhead is pushed directly down the back of his throat. He gags and tries to swallow around Harry’s cock as his twitches and spurts into the empty air. His whole body is jumping and shaking and another card snaps against his thigh. He can’t bloody breath with Harry’s cock in his throat so he gags hard again and the movement makes his cock jump and spurt again.
After he fixed it, he could paint the ceiling blue. Harry seemed to recall Ginny saying something about blue being a soothing color for a bedroom. It was supposed to help you fall asleep. He tried to imagine the whole bedroom blue, and then wondered what shade would induce the most relaxation. But then he glanced down at the card in his hands and his distraction efforts failed.
When Harry first saw him he stared. Not because he was surprised, but because he was confused. He knew there was something about that pointed chin and the face it was on that should be familiar, but he couldn’t place why. It wasn’t until he heard the lilting voice that the pieces snapped together. Even in French, Draco Malfoy drawled like a bored aristocrat.
“Can’t? Not that you don’t want to?” Draco doesn’t explain so Harry sighs. “Malfoy— Draco we’ve been having pretty filthy sex together since last May. What difference does it make if we add in some nights out as well?”
“I’m sorry.” Malfoy’s voice was deeper than usual, and a little scratchy.
“I’m not sure I want any more presents from you,” he says as he wraps an arm around Draco and pulls him closer. The bed is warm and as soft as a cloud. Draco, no surprise, has the loveliest sheets and his bed is spelled with so many cushioning charms that Harry has never once tossed or turned while sleeping in it. It’s still a novelty to be able to sneak into Draco’s rooms and share a bed.
Angry with himself, Harry grabbed Sergio’s legs and pushed them until the boy was bent almost double. He thrust with a renewed effort, desperate to find his finish and closed his eyes. Instead of the rushed Spanish, he imagined drawing criticisms, and halting curses. He imagined that the soft skin beneath his hands was as pale as milk, and marred by the occasional scar. Draco would have them, he knew. He’d still have the ones on his torso that Harry had given him, and probably a great deal more from his time during the war.
A smile which faded as he walked past Malfoy’s shop and saw the deep scowl the other man was giving the geranium he was watering.
Harry pressed his eyes closed and forced himself to remain still. He wasn’t sure what he would do otherwise. Would he hold Malfoy closer or push him away?
She frowns. “Don’t try and make me feel sorry for you, Harry Potter. We both know that’s not what’s going on and I’m worried about you. You’re constantly in the gossip rags, and with a different person every time. Don’t you ever have any second dates?”
On the shelf are little figurines, folded paper cranes, shiny stones and…
Potter huffs, pulls off Draco’s back, and then starts fucking him in time with Draco’s counting. Draco wants to smack him, but he’s already watching the potion, counting, and oh yes, being fucked, and he can’t handle anymore damn it.
Perhaps sensing his hesitation, Draco takes the vial from Harry’s hands and steps closer, into his space, lining their hips up with one another.
He shouldn’t.
“Basically,” said Malfoy. Then he pushed against Harry’s side and guided him towards the nearby café. “Here. They do the best croque madame.”
Harry laughs.
And when Draco eventually opens his eyes to look into Harry’s he suddenly gets it. “Oh,” he says, somewhat stupidly.
Finally, finally, Potter appears in the doorway and smiles with a wicked twist of his lips.
Draco’s cum leaks from his hole when he laughs. “Sure, Malfoy, sure.”
Hogwart’s Grounds
Draco melts and presses into Harry’s arms, his lips. His hands come up to tentatively caress his hair, then more confidently, his fingers sinking into Harry’s curls. He throws a leg over Harry’s hip and presses their bodies together.
“Have you ever been to Montmartre?” asked Malfoy after he had nearly polished off his torte.
“Shall I add the curry?” he asks.
“Huh,” says Draco after a minute. “It’s like a little amuse-bouche.”
Draco shoves him again. “What the hell is wrong with you? Do you have any idea how long that potion took me to make? Six bloody months!”
“Malfoy,” said Harry and followed him into the kitchen.
It’s Draco’s favourite vibrator. It’s long and slim, fantastic for filling him up just so and torturing his prostate. It’s the toy that taught him how to cum hands-free and turned him into such a desperate bottom. It makes him crazy.
Harry didn’t quite know how to respond to that so he only said, “Thank you.”
He has the audacity to giggle. “Shh, there we go, that’s better, isn’t it? I’m so proud of you darling, you did so well.” Draco’s so wrung out, so over-sensitive that he relaxes into Potter’s gentle head petting and soothing words.
Lauren nodded.
The blankets around his waist shifted above the weight that rested between Harry’s splayed knees. He watched the mound rise and fall and pictured what was happening beneath it until he remembered through the lust filled haze that he could simply remove the blankets and see for himself.
“Are you going to invite your friend to the party tomorrow night, Draco?” she asked once she was sure she had their attention.
“I thought you had something to show me? It better not be your cock, Potter.” Except, he kind of hopes it’s his cock.
But Malfoy wasn’t listening, he was on his mobile again, pounding at the touch screen and likely sending another unnecessary message. Harry hopped he was telling Lucas to fuck off, but he rather doubted it.
There’s no possible way a finger has managed to find its way into his arse through the layers of his pants, trousers, and the seat of the bloody chair he’s sitting in, but that is absolutely what it feels like and Harry is familiar enough to know what the slim, wiggling thing is. It pumps in and out of him a few times while he silently goes to pieces, and then disappears entirely.
He has to blink the tears from his eyes to see properly and he concentrates on his audience. Both men are sitting in the chairs on the other side of Potter’s desk now, cups of tea in hand. They are opposite where Draco is displayed, sipping their drinks and talking about whatever is on the wall behind him.
It’s only one finger, but it slides in so smoothly that Draco’s cock pulses.
And Draco wouldn’t allow himself to be used so carelessly, Harry thought. At least not by Harry. With Harry, he’d put up a token struggle, he’d tease and torment, and try and make Harry come before he was ready, then make fun of him for it. He might not even bottom for Harry, he might say something dirty in a superior tone like ‘Malfoy’s do not take it up the arse, Potter’ and make it sound like gospel.
“Okay,” said Harry, wondering if he’d missed something.
“You can’t say you don’t care,” says Draco. There’s moisture gathered in the corner of his eye, Harry can see it pooling there. Would rather look at his face than the ugly mark.
Paris had been beautifully decorated for Christmas, and had retained its holiday charm even several days after the holiday.
Harry looks away and smiles to himself. “Only with those that capture my interest,” he assures her.
He grins and shoots her a look through his fringe. “I think I could say the same about you.”
“Get?” Harry snaps. “You get exactly what I’m willing to give you, no more, no less.” He pushes Frederick’s grabbing hand aside and for good measure takes a step back.
Indeed.
“A quick one, Professor Malfoy?” Harry calls out. “Fifth year spells only.”
Harry pulls out as Draco coughs. Most of Harry’s cum has gone straight down his throat, but as he wheezes some of it comes back up and drips from his gaping mouth. It takes several deep breaths for Draco to feel in control again and then another card snaps on his upper back.
“That’s personal, Potter,” snaps Draco, but it’s half-hearted considering he’s leaning into Harry’s space, tipping his head up for the potion.
The attention is fantastic, but Draco is in a hurry. He’s teased himself long enough and he has no real intention of making this last. And also, damn it, Potter does need to finish his proposal, even though he doesn’t know why he cares about that.
Draco tosses the garment onto the floor and works at the bows that secure Harry’s panties to his hips. “For now I want this. Now, tell me how wet you are, how ready for me you are,” his lips are working their way towards Harry’s now.
He can only hope that the sentiment is reciprocated. Because he might still be a bit of an awful teacher, but he was a good Auror and he is the Boy-Who-Lived, as cringe of a title as that is, for a reason. And there are things that only he, Harry Potter, is good at and that only he can do for Draco.
Defense Against the Dark Arts Classroom
Harry nodded seriously. “It’ll be a year since the divorce, and it’s not like Ginny and I were serious about each other for some time before that.”
Because Draco is a traditionalist, a matching garter belt and two black stockings follow, the bracers connecting on Harry’s thighs with small nude-colored ribbons. Draco takes extra care in adjusting each pale bow before rising gracefully to his feet and picking up the bra.
Draco is uncharacteristically silent, letting Harry touch to his heart’s content, without a single whimper, or complaint.
“It didn’t take nearly so long the other night, did it?” continues Draco. “You had me strung up right quick.”
“Do you like him better than me?”
“Good boy,” says Harry, and even though he’s stroking his hands through Draco’s hair like he’s a well-behaved pup, Draco can’t help but lean into the praise.
Harry forces himself not to clench his buttocks together or to thrust his pelvis up as he desires to do. He needs the scene as much as Draco does now, needs to see it to its eventual conclusion. He won’t do anything to ruin the illusion at this point.
Harry shrugged. He didn’t really want to say it. He always embarrassed himself when he tried to pronounce French, or any other language for that matter. It was probably pretty stupid of him to think he could live in Paris. “Merde,” he said after he summoned up the courage.
Potter slides it down his cock, letting it just graze his sack which causes Draco to jump and scream into his gag. “Oops,” laughs Potter, not at all sorry. “Let’s see if you’re hungry enough yet. Ready?”
Draco remains frozen, merely nodding and offering brief smiles to the returning students as they wave hello. Jonathan Rigby slaps him on the back and nearly sends him flying. That summer growth spurt has made him taller than Draco, but Draco doesn’t chastise him, merely holds up a hand and accepts the poor sixth year’s mortified apology.
Their coffee came, and this time Harry added liberal amounts of sugar, following Malfoy’s lead. It tasted much better that way.
“But I thought…”
It felt like a holiday and for the first time since he’d arrived Harry felt good with how his life had turned out. His children still loved him, and he was happy.
Draco’s looking up at him now, waiting for him to decide. It grips Harry for a moment, how full of trust his expression is. As much as he grumbles, he’s shown a willingness to put himself in Harry’s hands again and again. It makes Harry want to do anything for him. Or to him.
Draco shakes Potter from his person, but he’s curious despite the instincts that are telling him to run. “Show me what?”
Draco makes quick work of Potter’s trousers, opening them up, and spreading them wide so that he has space to pull Potter out of his boxers. It’s a bit strange as he’s stiff all over, stomach, thighs, balls. His cock is hard, in an artificial sort of way, like a dildo. Fitting though, as that’s what Draco intends to use him as.
“How long does the spell last?” He asks Percy. Draco’s drooling on his shoulder and doesn’t seem to care.
In response, Draco drops to his knees and splays his legs open so Harry can see everything. With his arms pulled back like that he finds his eyes drawn to Draco’s chest more than he ever has before. “Try it on my nipples then, that’d probably feel good. Hey, Percy, does it work on nipples?”
He uses the usual potions and tonics in the shower, one to soften his hair, another to remove the stubble from his face and body, a third to soften and tan his skin. He’s left dripping on the tiles feeling refreshed and smelling faintly of green apples. He dons the white cotton robe he’s used before and slips his feet into the matching slippers before going out to meet Draco in his playroom.
He stepped over to the counter and righted the box as best he could, smoothing down the red paper and adjusting the green ribbon. Narcissia’s note was bent, but there was nothing he could do about that. So with one last brush of his fingertips he retreated from the package and from the shop.
“Ah,” she was smiling a bit sadly. “Of course. Then perhaps you may give me a moment to purchase these? He loves the caramel ones, but they’re all out at the moment.
“Just nowhere,” Harry lied.
“Chaser?” said the boy as he reached for the bowl of limes. He picked one up between his thumb and forefinger and then pressed it against the side of his own neck.
That’s true. Draco’s shown Harry all of his toys. The vibrators, the cuffs, the plugs, the dildos, the beads, there’d been so many Harry’s head had spun thinking about all the nasty little ways Draco might have used them to get himself off. By the time Draco had shown him the perverted portrait he kept in the closet, he’d been too excited to try some new things out that he’d promptly forgotten all about Percy.
“Is this for me?” he asked with such delight that Harry didn’t even complain when the chocolates were ripped from beneath his arm without so much as a hello.
“Don’t mind me,” says Potter. He pulls Draco’s briefs down around his thighs and then his mouth is on his arse cheek giving him a playful bite. “You haven’t finished your Polyjuice yet, have you? Keep going.”
“I don’t have a lads group,” says Harry, rolling his eyes.
“Yes,” snaps Draco. “Your mouth on my cock.”
“And see to it you don’t scuff the marble on your way out.”
“You want us both to do it then?” he asks. He’s not sure what he’d say. The idea of losing control and spiralling into desperation does not sound at all appealing. How annoyed will Draco be if he refuses?
“Invisibility cloak,” explains Potter.
“Oh-key, Phot-her,” Draco managed from around the gooey chocolate. He hadn’t even tried to finish his bite before answering, or covered his mouth.
“Besides,” continues Draco. “I don’t have him out all the time. I usually keep him in the hall closet so he can’t creep on me.”
And it’s the strangest, most difficult walk of his life, walking through the Hog’s Head to the toilets as two fingers fuck in and out of his arsehole and another set of fingers pinch his nipple. He barely has the door closed before a third finger is added and he’s sliding to his knees.
Harry lay in bed and stared at the unfamiliar ceiling. This one was tiled, but many of the white tiles had faded to beige, or had been cracked or damaged. He was too old to be waking up to ceilings like this one, too old to be lying in a stranger’s bed, and definitely too old to be having his cock sucked by the boy beneath the covers.
That Saturday, while Malfoy was in Giverny, Harry went to a gay bar Malfoy had once talked about. He gave the name to a cab driver and paid the cover fee at the door. He’d worn his tightest jeans and what he hoped was his most flattering button down.
It was time to give the issue up, Harry thought. It was obviously never going to make sense to him.
The bloody fuck weasel is laughing, but Draco’s barely hanging on. He’s gripping the edge of his work table so hard his hands are cramping and then it gets worse as Potter reaches around and starts slowly pulling his cock in time even though Draco isn’t counting aloud anymore.
Whatever they’ve taken, they’ve obviously messed up the dosage as by the time Neville reaches the seventh year students they’re all firmly in the octogenarian range. Harry watches for a moment, wondering if Neville might need some help sorting them out when a hand grabs him by the arm and pulls him aside.
She looked down at her hands in consideration. “I don’t suppose I could request a favor from you?”
Harry smiled. “Of course not.”
And that, to Harry, sounds like a great idea. He’s lucky he put down a cushioning charm because his knees would be bruised without it. Draco can’t do much other than lay there so Harry sets the pace, trying to time it with the little clenches Draco makes around the vibrator. He enjoys the long slide of Draco’s cock for a bit, but then he has to take himself in hand and yes… that’s so much better. His balls tighten and draw up at the first stroke, his cock heavy and full in his palm.
“You can’t, you’re busy.”
Professor Malfoy’s Office
Harry gasped at the contact, opening his mouth almost instantly to Malfoy’s searching tongue. He pressed himself against the other man, chest to chest, and allowed his lips to be bitten and sucked on. Malfoy’s hands were still stuck between their bodies, so Harry wrapped his around the other man’s hips and ran his hands down Malfoy’s arse.
“Didn’t know you were coming, did I? We didn’t have plans.”
“Such as?” asked Harry, taking the bait, even though he knew it was a diversionary tactic. However, he had no desire to continue exploring their previous topic, at least not without further contemplation. Perhaps with something stronger to drink than rapidly cooling coffee.
“Arms, Potter,” prompts Draco.
“I’ll cook a curry. They’re always eating curry on Come Dine With Me.”
The smile he felt on his own face was a bit of a surprise, but he couldn’t help it. Malfoy had provided the words better than he had been able to since he had thought up this crazy move. “Pretty much, yeah. I wanted to start over, and to be left alone for a while.” Then he added, “mostly alone,” in case Malfoy took offense. “Paris seemed like a decent choice. No one is going to follow me home, or ask me for my autograph, or an interview.” There were a million other little things that seemed to make sense, but he’d felt he’d said enough so he just shrugged in closing.
And fuck, yeah okay.
It was a ridiculous place, Harry had concluded by the time their food and drink had arrived, but he loved it instantly.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t actually like coffee.”
“Besides the shop being there, I live around there too, and so do about a dozen other witches and wizards I know,” he looked away from the artist he’d been watching and gave Harry a mocking smile. “Turns out we’re not very original in our escape.”
After the divorce he told his children that he was moving to Paris because he wanted something new. What he really wanted was to escape the embarrassment of having his separation and numerous infidelities trotted into the public domain. What he really, really wanted was to crawl into a hole until his name was forgotten entirely, but he still had three children and monthly alimony payments so he settled on Paris.
When they’re finished they walk back down the corridor. McGonagall has started the staff meeting already. The room is full of professors, some sitting around the communal table, others perched in the more comfortable armchairs that decorate the space. Harry’s at the table and there’s an open seat next to him with Draco’s bag on it. Harry’s biting his lip as he carefully writes out the dates McGonagall is reading out.
“Don’t tell me you have a bestiality fetish too,” snaps Draco.
“What are these for?” he asks, rather stupidly. He’d been an Auror for six years before becoming a professor, he knows what they’re for. He’s just surprised Draco would have them or allow Harry to use them on him.
It takes Draco a long time to answer. Harry knows he’s clever enough to have all the information he needs, but he’s doing the annoying Slytherin thing of weighing up how much information to give. As an Auror, Harry’s learned the best technique with these types is to wait them out.
Frederick looks confused, and anxious, and desperate, all looks Harry is intimately familiar with. It’s not that Frederick is bad looking; he might have turned Harry’s head in another setting, but he’s no longer new to this game. He can spot obsessive and unhealthy easily these days.
Draco watches him go and tries to make sense of what just happened. It’s all a mess in his head and he doesn’t know what he wants, but he has the feeling he’s just royally fucked up.
“Want you to come on me,” pants Draco, eyeing up Harry’s cock as he jerks it off.
“Hello,” said Harry, trying to be polite.
Taking a trick out of Malfoy’s book, Harry arched an eyebrow. “Right,” he said.
Draco barely hears the words, he’s whining, clenching around Potter’s fingers as his cum spurts out, arching into the empty air. Draco loses track of how many times he pulses, cock wet and twitching. All at once, it’s too much. Potter’s fingertips teasing his prostate become painful, his rim too stretched around them. He’s sticky, he’s uncomfortable, and yes, he’s splattered cum down the front of his formal school robes and the welcome feast is starting any minute now.
“Oh,” says Potter, unconcerned with his causal display of sex toys in a school. “You’re the one who left it here.”
“But for now… dinner? In my rooms?” he asks. Potter grins and kisses him again. Draco sucks his lip and smiles into the kiss. “And bring the plug.”
Draco’s hands continue to work his shaft, holding him straight even as Harry tugs Draco’s mouth off him with a hand in his hair.
It turned out that Harry hadn’t gotten any better at parties since the last one he’d attended. After Lauren had gravitated towards the other guests, he tried to circulate with the people he had been assured spoke English, but he had never been very good at small talk. As a result he polished off the bottle of red he’d brought all on his own, and started in on the gin and tonics that the young red headed woman was pouring in the kitchen. He drank two and tried not to think of Ginny. He also took several trips to the toilet, waiting in a short queue each time.
“Do you want to come down?” he asks. “Or stay like that?”
“Bad day?” he says as he lounges in Potter’s doorway.
Draco and his mirror image reach up to touch his cheek, but there’s nothing there. He glances over his shoulder again, but it’s still just a storeroom with his colleagues arguing over an old professor’s handwriting.
Pickles sauntered into the room in a way that drew their attention how only cat’s can, and draped her body down on Malfoy’s feet. He reached down and scratched between her ears and didn’t say a word about the fur sticking to his trouser legs.
“Draco, I know what I want,” he explains.
The boy, and yes he was definitely young enough to still be called a boy by Harry, bit his lip and fluttered his lashes. It looked like the sort of move that had been practiced in front of a mirror.
Harry’s head whipped around fast enough to cause him to wince. “Married?” he repeated.
“What do you think of this lettuce, does it look a bit wilted to you?” Malfoy asked as they wandered through produce. He had his own basket draped over one arm, and it was predictably filled with far more pastries and sweets than actual food. Harry gave him credit for buying any vegetables at all.
“Has someone sent me flowers, Malfoy?” Harry asked after a moment.
Draco groans and flops down into the sand beside him. “I don’t know how I feel about that,” he says eventually. “I like spending time with you here, alone. I don’t think I’m ready for dinner.”
“New television,” he explains. “I thought Eddie might like one for the Muggle Studies department.” He flicks his wand and the shimmering fabric falls to the floor. “Oh wow,” he gasps. “You have made a mess of yourself, haven’t you.”
“Well, if there are no complaints there I think we can leave it at that,” says McGonagall. “Our Thursday morning meeting will also be cancelled this week as we complete the induction activities for the first years— Neville don’t forget you’ve volunteered for the safety drill of what to do if you encounter the giant squid— but I expect Heads of Houses to meet with me on Friday morning to discuss any potential safeguarding issues with your new charges. That will be all then, enjoy your evening.”
“Yeah to their own advantage,” quipped Harry, well aware they were only skimming the surface of a deeper conversation he wasn’t keen to have.
Since the shuttered doors that made up the front wall of the café were open it hardly felt as if he was indoor at all. But the thick supports and the other patrons blocked him enough that Harry felt confident in his subterfuge. He ordered an espresso to give himself something to do with his hands and watched.
He wants to refuse. He wants to leave Potter standing there with that insufferable smirk. He wants…well what he wants is for Potter to finish the job he started.
The chair scrapes loudly against the stone as he hurriedly stands. There’s a group of fifth years at the Gryffindor table who look ready to leap to his defence. The Gryffindors usually seem to like their prickly Potions Master, but even Harry can tell that the fake smile and murderous look in Draco’s eyes are coming off a bit unhinged.
“Hmm,” hums Harry. “I don’t know, now you just look constipated.”
“I didn’t have many options, remember,” added Malfoy quickly. “I had no money, and nowhere to go, and no one else wanted me. It was a good deal for someone like me.”
Thursday, November 8
“I can’t explain it, Ron,” says Harry. And how could he? His dates vary so much in appearance and personality. How could he explain why one week he’s out with portly, middle-aged Guy Ferguson from the Ministry’s Human Resources, and why the next he’s on the arm of Salina Arellano, the latest up and coming pop sensation.
“Going to ask me nicely?” Potter's tone is teasing, but thankfully he’s already pulled Draco’s trousers and briefs off and tossed them into the corner. Draco would complain about the complete lack of respect for his personal belongings, but he’s too busy rucking up his robes and throwing a leg over Potter’s shoulder. He’s almost fully hard again.
He’s almost got it, the horn isn’t crushed as fine as he’d like it, but just a bit longer and it will be good enough.
“Well, what did I say?”
And Draco is smiling at him, looking at the necklace as if he’s just bestowed Harry with a precious gift. “I’ve been shopping,” he says, holding up another slim box.
“So dirty,” agrees Draco with a moan that makes Harry’s cock throb. “I had to soap it up real good, my balls too, cover them in suds, massage them all over, rinse off in the warm, pulsing water.” Draco’s lips are so close Harry can feel the movement of each word on his neck, just behind his ear, feeling each warm breath. “You know what else was dirty?” he asks. Instead of answering Harry moans. “That’s right, my filthy arsehole. You came in it this morning, do you remember? Pounded me into this mattress before my alarm went off and told me to carry your cum in me all day. My pants were so sticky, you have no idea.”
James just grunted.
Some of the tension ebbs from Draco’s tightly wound frame, his shoulder stops trying to climb into his ears and his wand points back to the ground. “So you do have it!”
Friday, September 21
Draco starts unhooking his robes. He’d made a quick detour to his private rooms after dinner and he’s no longer wearing anything underneath.
Rosy Lips are dusted across his nails as Draco delicately holds each finger still for the slim brush. He knows he’s not supposed to move, but Harry tilts his head just slightly so he can better see the intense concentration on the other man’s face as he works. Each miniscule movement of the brush captures all of Draco’s energies, each stroke precise in every way.
When he turns around, Draco is still standing, slim hands covering his eyes and half his face, and yes, his lips are moving in little movements as he counts. Harry’s chest clenches in affection. He makes him wait for a few more hippogryphs, just so he can watch, before clearing his throat.
Saturday, September 1
“Neville gave me one for Christmas last year, rather tame don’t you think?”
Draco leans forward and laughs against his collarbone. “That’s true enough, my dear.”
“For me?” asks Harry.
“No worries,” said Malfoy. “Daniel always pulls that shit on foreigners. He speaks English.”
“You need to get your cock sucked, Potter,” Malfoy started off as he took a deep sip from his takeaway coffee.
“Finished?” asks Draco.
Potter laughs and pumps the vibrator in and out a few times. “Lovely and wet,” he says. “You’re making obscene sounds down here too, you know.”
“Fuck that’s hot,” whines Harry. He’ll never understand how Draco can stand it, but he loves the thought of Draco walking around with an arse full of his cum.
“I think you can wait,” he says against Draco’s lips. And then in parseltongue, he says; “Hey. Wake up.”
Despite the truly spectacular orgasm Harry gave him on the Hogwarts Express, Draco’s still angry about being left unsatisfied. Never mind that Harry had rectified the situation as soon as possible. It’s annoying, especially considering that just last week he’d been gagging for it as much as Harry had after two months away. And Harry doesn’t want to think about if it had been two months for Draco like it has for him. He doesn’t want to think about who else Draco might have had during that time. It’s not like they're exclusive, or that they even talk about anything like that.
It takes a minute for Draco to take stock of his body, and Harry helps by adjusting a knot here and there until he’s comfortable. Then he takes a step back.
He’d had been instantly suspicious when he’d arrived after his own detention with first year Gloria Green, poor thing, to find Draco so relaxed and that Pervert Portrait hanging on the wall in the bedroom. It’s not exactly cheating is it? Getting off with a portrait. Is it even really sex? It’s not like a portrait can penetrate Draco in any way, and Harry doubts Draco gets off rubbing his cock against the frame.
Malfoy looked entirely too smug, an expression that called back an, until now forgotten, ire.
Draco nods and lets Harry do his thing to signify the end of practice. Dueling Club has been his responsibility ever since he joined the staff last year. At the time he’d been worried Draco would take offence since he’d been leading it previously but Draco had just smirked and wished him good luck. The kids are always wound up and beat up by the end of practice, and their exuberant energy levels have the reputation for stressing out Hogwarts Professors.
Draco’s going to be furious when he finds out.
“I think you know what you want,” Harry answers as he deftly disposes of the other man’s cufflinks.
“Dinner?” asks Potter.
He had expected another run-in with Malfoy at some point. What he had not expected was for the man to turn up at his flat on a Tuesday morning when he should have been at work. He hadn’t even known Malfoy knew where he lived.
“Good?” asks Draco, looking like he already knows the answer.
Harry smirks. “Oh yes, it certainly is, and you’re going to have to make it very good too if you want that potion back. You do want your potion back don’t you, Malfoy?” Casually, he leans back against the wall and starts rubbing his bulge through his trousers, Draco can’t keep his eyes off the motion and he licks his lips again, the little tart.
Harry didn’t like the twisted smirk on Malfoy’s face. “What was it again?” he challenged. He repeated ‘je veux t’enculer’ five more times until he was sure he had it right.
Malfoy grunted in response, and continued scrolling through his phone. Harry left without a goodbye.
Draco shouldn’t distract him, doesn't want him to burn, so he waits until Potter has finished distributing the dead fish and has washed up again before he tells him; “No.”
Great Hall, Head Table
A long whistle breaks the rather uncomfortable silence. Draco clenches his cheeks and sucks in a deep breath in preparation.
Draco smirks and tucks his fingers into the waistband of Harry’s trousers. “Want me pliant and happy, on my knees for you, desperate for a touch, a taste?” His fingers tease through the fabric of his shirt until they come in contact with bare skin. The fingertips just barely tracing the thin skin over his hip bones on either side.
With a heavy sigh, Malfoy relented. “It means ‘I want to have sex with you,’ I promise you’re going to want to use that one at some point. Unless you’ve become celibate in your advanced age.”
“Of course you did,” says Draco, who disappears for a moment, then returns with his glasses in hand. They must be scratched up because Draco gives them an episky before sliding them back onto Harry’s face.
It was gibberish, but Malfoy was looking at him, and Harry wasn’t a Gryffindor for no nothing so he took a deep breath and said what he hoped sounded vaguely like ‘vous avez plein de merde,’ but probably didn’t.
He took his CV to Ministère de la Justice and met with several men he’d collaborated with in the past. Three weeks later and he was hired on as an Auror. It wasn’t as senior as his job in London had been, and he wasn’t paid as much, but in some ways it was so much better. For one, he had been right, no one in France gave a damn about his name and if he was recognized it was only with uninterested glances and brief lingering pauses that were quickly forgotten.
It’s agonising waiting for Eddie to finally stand up, picking up the two empty teacups. Potter stops him at the door and keeps chatting, eyes flicking over to Draco in a way that lets him know he’s doing it on purpose.
It was incredibly rude and it caused Malfoy to turn bright red and scrunch up his face like an angry dog, but Harry couldn’t help it. He’d completely forgotten the memory of the amazing bouncing ferret and burst out laughing. The couple at the next table eyed him uneasily.
“Should I release the featherlight, or do you prefer it?”
“No!” Harry’s head snapped back to see the shopkeeper trying to thrust a bucket of cherries at a clearly irritated passerby.
“So how’d you end up with him again?” asks Harry.
No, definitely not, thought Harry,  just far too young for him. “I think I’m too old for one night stands.” He said instead.
Harry turned, clutching an extra large bar of Honeydukes finest against his chest and stared at the woman who had tapped him on the shoulder. He hadn’t seen Narcissa Malfoy in years. Not since her trial at least. She’d been the only member of her family to escape extreme punishment, thanks in part to his own testimony. House arrest, he recalled through the haze of time. Lucius was still in Azkaban to his knowledge.
“There we go,” says Harry, looking pleased as punch. “All finished.”
It’s impossible to keep a tight seal around the cock in his mouth this way or do anything more than take it. He keeps his jaw slack, and tongue out, a wide messy hole for Harry to fuck into. He’s completely powerless, overcome with the sensation of the beads wiggling inside him, cock beginning to hit the back of his throat as he hangs immobilized.
It couldn’t be more ideal actually. Potter managed to push himself back from the desk, leaving just enough room for Draco. His arms are hanging off the armrests, and his feet are planted on the floor, hips angled up, but body leaning back. Behind his glasses, Potter’s bright eyes are furious.
“You don’t want to commemorate the moment, Potter? I’m offended,” said Malfoy as he looked over the menu.
“You’re going to have a rough time being a Parisian if you don’t learn any French,” said Malfoy.
“I am guessing that you thought you were well hidden and therefore hadn’t noticed that I saw you staring at me on the street before you even came in? Is that what that face means?”
It’s hard not to let that hurt his feelings, but Harry is nothing if not determined. “We could though. Have a drink, in public, at a bar. I’d like to at least.”
“And you?” asked Harry. “Why Paris?”
“No. You got detention for being out after curfew and consorting with a man with an illegal dragon. I received a detention because your head of house had it out for Slytherin.”
“What if it was?” asks Harry.
Harry’s dick is hard the moment the man opens his polished mahogany door. He doesn’t bother trying to hide it and instead makes a show of adjusting himself as he steps over the threshold.
“There’s a difference between having a Death Eater bend over for you in the toilets and having one on your arm.”
“Because it would be rude,” the woman continued in English. Then she turned to Harry. “I’m sorry, but we haven’t been properly introduced, my name is Lauren Arret.”
Instantly, Draco relaxes into his chair and steals Harry’s cup of tea with a smile.
And it’s a shame he can’t hear Draco agree with him, can’t hear those little moans he enjoys so much, so he cancels the silencing and blindfolding spell.
He was so very, very tired and he just wanted this all to end so he could go back to being happy again. But he shushed Draco’s quiet tears and ran his hand up and down the other man’s back the way he used to when his children had a nightmare.
When Draco lets a long minute pass and still doesn’t say anything, Harry sighs and picks up another bucket. “Fire crabs next.”
Draco lets his ball drop from his mouth and runs his lips up Harry’s cock to the tip and dips in with his tongue. It’s practically worshipful, the way Draco sucks cock. It’s opposite Harry’s usual technique which usually involves going at it as hard and fast as he possibly can. Draco’s sweet as a kitten, with little licks and sucks, never taking Harry too deep but never giving Harry a chance to notice the lack of depth because one hand stays so busy at his base, with its caressing and squeezing and pumping.
This time Malfoy’s lips twisted in pleasure rather than annoyance. “Of course I did.”
Draco whimpers, and tries to clear his head. He’s let his head fall onto his arms and it’s hard to straighten up again with Potter’s hand holding him so firmly in such a delicate place. His ingredients are all lined up, just how he left them, but the haze of arousal is making it hard to think.
Outwardly Harry winks. “Give me ten hippogryphs then?”
“You are supposed to be chaperoning, you know, stopping this sort of thing,” Harry reminds Draco.
He’s so worried about it that when the card on his tongue sparks he’s completely taken by surprise. Instinctually he clamps his mouth shut tighter, even though the corners of the card cut into the sides of his mouth, and the sparks burn against his tongue. He gasps, his mouth opens, and the card falls. Then before he can soothe his burning tongue Harry’s up on his knees, grabbing him by the hair, and sliding his cock into his open mouth.
Thursday, September 27
“No, what?” asks Potter, but Draco can see on his face he knows.
Harry had been about to ask what on earth Malfoy meant when one of the artists broke away from the crowd and gestured to them both with the clear purpose of drawing their picture. Harry stared at the man for a full-horrified minute before he hurriedly shook his head. The artist shrugged and moved on to the next table.
Malfoy was frowning at him when he opened the door. “Potter,” he said before shoving his way inside.
“For work,” Draco reminds him. He checks his pocket watch. He has enough time for one more cup of tea and to listen to Potter’s sulk.
There’s no way Potter can go any harder than he is, but it doesn’t matter because the robes against his cock feel so good as he jerks himself through the material, his tip catching once, then twice, then—
“Oh, doll,” Draco laughs. “I thought you realized by now. I want you.”
“And then we step,” says Harry, taking a step forward as Draco takes a step back. It’s harder to get used to the shuffling duelling step instead of placing one foot in front of the other, but it puts you at less risk of any curses that would aim to trip you up. “Then again,” he says, this time stepping back as Draco smoothly steps forward. “You want to maintain that distance, some of the spells you’ll use will have backlash or might affect you if you get too close. If you want your spells to solely impact your opponent and not you then watch your spacing!”
Draco starts crying. His cock is painfully hard now, but he’s scared to cum again. Can’t handle the feeling one more time, or the painfully sensitive feeling after that won’t abate.
“Are you still good for a demonstration?”
But still he found himself sitting with Malfoy at least twice a week, listening to him rattle on about whatever thought floated through his head.
“There’s more I take it?”
“Finite incantatem,” Harry whispers against his chest, too tired to do so nonverbally. One of Draco’s arms comes up around his shoulders and the other, predictably, goes to play with his hair. Harry’s still not a fan of excessive touch, and it's a challenge considering Draco is part octopus, but he’s beginning to enjoy the gentle tug and scrape of fingers through his curls. So long as it’s Draco.
“About what,” says Draco, an edge to his tone.
“I don’t work for the Ministry anymore, Malfoy,” explained Harry. He wondered why he even had to. Surely the Daily Prophet was available in Paris somewhere. Or perhaps his humiliation had been spread across the front pages of the French equivalent.
Draco is at the desk when Harry walks in, his quill working at a steady pace down the curling scroll. He does not look up as Harry walks in so Harry makes his way to the padded stool at the vanity and looks out the window. The rain is letting up a bit and just a hint of the sunset can be seen peeking through the clouds.
Sunday, September 9
Harry holds him throughout, doesn’t argue at the nails dug into his shoulders and then looks down at the mess on his stomach. “Did you just…?”
“Ah, no worries then,” says Harry. He can’t keep the smile off his face as he turns to the last person in the room. “Malfoy?” The man is holding himself as frozen as if he’s the one that’s been caught with a body bind. Harry's smile grows teeth as he looks at him and asks; “Anything tying you up tonight?”
And ridiculous Potter, with his ridiculous glasses, and ridiculous hair sitting in the middle of his pile of pillows just looks so damned earnest that Draco finds himself hoping for the first time in a long time.
Thankfully Potter is pressing dirty open-mouthed kisses against his arsehole and gently stroking his cock, neither of which are as distracting as being tongue fucked.
“Anyway,” he says, “I wanted to tell you to enjoy your evening.” And Harry wants to make one last play to convince Draco to join him, but Draco is kissing him sweetly and he has just given him a present so he decides to hold his tongue. “Come to mine later whenever you get in, I don’t care how late.”
Pure relief floods over his body. He’s done it.
He can’t even say the words, but Potter must take his pained whimpers for agreement. So, so gently, he presses his lips against Draco’s. Then he does exactly as he’d said. He sits in his chair and watches.
“You’re really bad at it, aren’t you? Dating?” he says. Mostly because he doesn't know what else he can say.
But Draco doesn’t know what’s got him so excited because the cards on his arse cheeks are going off, all of them, and it feels like being spanked in quick succession, each slap overlapping the next. He’s glad his mouth is free because he whimpers and moans through the pain and his arse clenches around the beads inside. The beads start to twist and pulse just as Harry thrusts himself back into his mouth again.
There is always the possibility that Draco will tire of him. Maybe next week will be the week the green invitation does not arrive. Then again, maybe by next week Harry will find himself someone new. Or maybe they’ll continue this twisted relationship they have. Maybe they have a shot at something more. Maybe.
“Please, the backroom of the Wheezes is full of them.”
And probably, that wicked smirk should have made Harry suspicious.
“And you? Married out of Hogwarts, only divorced one year? You’ve been alone a lot have you?” Harry winced at the tone. Malfoy hadn’t been so callous in months.  Malfoy was sitting up now, swinging his legs off the couch and pushing himself up with his hands. “Well?” he demanded.
“Not my fault you’re a shit teacher,” Draco tells him. “McGonagall mentioned the curriculum proposal deadlines in our staff meeting last Tuesday. Don’t worry though, I’ll be quick, I came prepared.”
Unfortunately, Rosmerta has retired and the new proprietor Rogers has no sense of tradition. And to the horror of the adults of Hogwarts, he believes in non-alcoholic Hogsmeade Weekends for the Hogwarts students. He won’t be serving a drop until Monday evening as he does once a month. It makes chaperoning far less enjoyable and means that all the teachers have just moved to the Hogs Head instead for their evening drinks.
Next Draco opens one of the drawers on the vanity. Row upon row of small glass bottles lay inside in a rainbow of colors, though there are a large number of darker, bloodier reds. Tonight he’s chosen a soft petal pink, when the lid is uncapped Harry can see it’s called Rosy Lips.
Malfoy shrugged and continued rifling through his newspaper. “Not my problem, is it?”
“Spend a lot of time talking to the flowers, do you, Malfoy?” snipped Harry.
Malfoy deflated. Slightly. “I’m with someone.”
For some reason Malfoy looked confused. “Potter, this morning I told my landlady to suck my balls, why on earth would I be bothered by calling Daniel a cock-sucking, shop-keeping whore? It’s not like he took offense. It’s just business.”
Hogsmeade Station
“I used my hands,” continues Draco. “Combed through my hair, and covered every inch of my body. Felt so nice and warm under the water, the soap was so slick against my skin I couldn’t resist. My nipples were so hard on my chest, I had to give them a tease, run over them with my soapy fingers until my cock grew hard.”
Harry’s not bothered, he sort of wants to see how Francis does. It looks like Marietta Clark has spotted Francis disobeying, her narrow-eyed focus has drifted over more than once, but so far she hasn’t said anything. And Harry’s not worried about his partner because Francis is duelling Guy Frank and Francis and Frankie have been joined at the hip since their first year so Harry knows Frankie can take it.
Draco goes to kiss him, but Harry pulls away. “I’m still annoyed, you know.”
“There we go,” says Harry, pressing the thumb in slightly and humming as Draco closes his lips around it, giving him a little suck. “I’ll give you your potion back, Malfoy, don’t you worry. Only if I’m going to do such a favour for you I think it’s only fair you do something for me, don’t you think?”
“Blood magic is illegal,” says Draco carefully.
The gentle massage stops and Potter’s grip tightens. It’s not nearly as nice.
Probably, Draco wants both legs fancy and also to be done right this instant, but he’s going to have to choose.
Malfoy’s eyes sharpened. He’d never told Harry that, and Harry had never let on that he knew. Apparently Malfoy liked to pretend that Lucas was solely devoted to him, despite the fact that Harry had only ever seen them together a handful of times, (thankfully).
Wednesday, November 14
“What is?” asks Harry.
McGonagall always spells the test names out, never calls them the ‘owls’ and ‘newts’ like the rest of them do. Draco and Neville exchange a hidden glance and smile at that. It’s one of the things the staff teases about behind her back. How much shorter their staff meetings would be during exam time if McGonagall didn’t always take the time to spell out their acronyms. Thankfully, McGonagall doesn’t notice. She’s getting up there, but she still has eyes in the back of her head.
“Just like that, just a little more,” encourages Harry, trying not to thrust too deeply. “Fuck the mouth on you. I’ve missed this. Your perfect fucking mouth.” He’s too far gone to censor himself, to pretend he hasn’t been thinking of this exact scenario for the past two months and hasn't been wanking off at the thought of making Malfoy go all soft and desperate for him.
He paused just long enough for Malfoy to ask, “You like Paris, because Paris doesn’t like you?”
The feeling that overtakes him feels deliriously close to happiness and Draco is finally ready to start allowing himself to feel it. He looks at the clock, they’ve missed dinner, but they can always call on a house elf. His eyes slide to the shelf, then back to Potter.
And then Percy had chimed in again and said; “Perhaps a punishment is in order?”
There were no more trips to Montmartre, no more parties with Lauren. Just Harry and listening to Malfoy complain about whatever the topic of the day happened to be while he drank bad coffee and sat in uncomfortably stiff chairs.
“He is no good,” said Lauren. She’d been a good host, introducing Harry to all the other English speakers and making sure he wasn’t getting bored.
Draco wants to dig his fingers into that ridiculous mop, but he does know better, Potter hates when he gets handsy and he doesn’t want to ruin this, so he obeys without hesitation. Anything to get those cocksucking lips closer. He throws his arms out to grip the back of the seat and holds on.
It’s one of the first times Draco’s been grateful to be left-handed, despite all the tutors he’s endured who’ve tried to force him to write with his right. Thankfully it never took, so it's as easy as anything to reach out with his free hand to find Harry’s hand. He gives the fingers a gentle squeeze, turns his hand over, and presses their palms together.
“He has?” squeaks Draco. Is Neville seeing the same thing? Is this mirror his ridiculous boyfriends doing?
The training mat’s get stored away by a few helpful students while the others mill about in a uselessly busy sort of way.
Lauren didn’t even respond to the question. “He has been coming around with Draco for a few years now. Never stays long. Never does any good.”
“You can do it,” Potter nods encouragingly. “I’ll think about how I feel about you, and you think about what you want to see. I won’t be able to hide. I’m pants at Occlumency, you know that.”
Draco’s not capable of arguing back, not with the gag stuffed between his teeth. What he can do is whine as Potter pushes a second finger in with a rapid thrust.
Then Draco sighs. “I’m going to have to take up yoga aren’t I?”
Draco looks pretty blissed out and hums. “Feels good, is all,” he says.
Malfoy, ignored the complaint and ordered two. Presumably one of them was for Harry, but it was never clarified.
Potter’s fingers slide out of his hole and he wipes them against Draco’s thigh, the arse. He takes a long look at the mess Draco’s made of himself then smiles wickedly and says; “I really do.”
“You should have,” Harry says, thinking about it even though he’d been in detention and it would have been far too inappropriate. “Would have bent you over my desk and filled you up.”
Draco leaves Neville to fend for himself, and takes his seat as inconspicuous as possible, so as to not interrupt McGonagall. They’ve reports coming up and it’s important information she’s giving. He hopes Harry has written down the dates correctly so he can copy them into his agenda.
“He likes you, you know.”
Harry hummed in response and looked away. There didn’t seem to be much he could say to that.
“Why do you always have to ruin everything?” Draco shouts back.
Harry bows and holds the pose for exactly one second before he’s up again and bringing forth his shield. Draco’s whip quick, he’s learned and has no qualms about embarrassing Harry in front of the students. His tongue-tying curse bounces harmlessly off Harry’s shield, but he’s already got another spell on his lips.
Lauren’s flat was decorated in Christmas cheer, and Harry had on the scarf that Matthew had given to him the night before. They had celebrated early since Matthew was returning to the states to celebrate with his sister and nieces, and Harry was leaving for England next week to celebrate with his children. He’d given Matthew a new shaving kit and a book on French politics that Matthew had shown an interest in on one their walks.
Harry shivered all over. “That’s creepy.”
Harry focused his attention on the potted plant in the corner. It was a cactus, Malfoy had given it to him for his birthday and assured him it was the one plant he couldn’t kill.
“Leave it,” he leers as his lips descend. The hand slides down his wrist as a tongue pushes in between his lips. Fingers gently caress his own, sliding against his pink polished nails as Harry wraps his own tongue against the intruder. Then just as suddenly both retreat.
A cold, heavy, well-deserved weight settled in Harry’s stomach. So, Lucas wasn’t the sort to leave his wife and three kids…
“His name is Lucas and—”
“School,” said Malfoy finally. Once the woman had bounced her gaze from Harry to Malfoy and back several times, waiting for an answer. “Boarding school, before L’Universite.”
The last knot is tricky as he’s nearly run out of rope, but he’s getting the hang of it now and it catches in the end. He tests it with his fingers and takes a step back.
“Am I forgiven?” he asks against Harry’s lips.
Draco just shrugs with a slight dip of his shoulders. “Had time to nip into Dervish and Banges. Bought myself these.” He shows Harry the inside of his slim box where a pair of soft black gloves rest. They look soft and lush, and Harry can’t help but think they’d make a much nicer present on a cold autumn afternoon than a necklace. He shuts the lid quickly and tucks the box back into his robes.
This time Harry didn’t bother repeating Malfoy’s words and instead widened his eyes in question.
And there’s a thought. These rooms have been used by both Snape and Slughorn. Harry can’t help tensing up, what about the bed…
Harry’s mouth goes a bit dry at that, he suddenly, really, really likes the idea of tying Draco’s hands away.
There was a dainty clearing of the throat. Harry and Malfoy both turned to look at the woman sitting at their table. She was smiling as if she knew a secret they didn’t.
Eventually, Potter sighs and hisses something under his breath.
His longtime friend makes a noise of agreement from the couch, but does not look up from her reading material. It is only after Harry has put away his groceries and returned to the sitting room, coffee and newspaper in hand, that he notices what she is reading.
The other man just grunts, his shoulders are tense and he’s bent hunched over his desk, scribbling away on a long parchment.
“Release it,” says Draco. “I want to try without.”
“Where about?” asked Malfoy in a vaguely, passively interested sort of way. He was looking out into the artists, watching as a man in an offset hat drew a picture of a young Asian girl in twin plaits.
His mouth was open, Harry noted. And his lips were swollen.
He’s fuming, cheeks near red in anger. His left eyebrow is even twitching and his hair looks like he’s been running his fingers through it, disturbing his usual carefully arranged coif. His body is also extremely close to Harry’s, as he leans in to box him in against the wall, two hands fisted in the front of Harry’s robes. Despite the situation, Harry shivers and his cock gives a very interested twitch.
He doesn’t like the cold shoulder. Not when he knows how lovely, and pliant, and filthy Draco can be. He knows if he can just corner him in private he’ll be on his knees for Harry in under a minute if he’s not bending over and grabbing his ankles. Clearly, Draco knows that too, because it’s been over a week and he’s been very cleverly avoiding all of Hogwarts’ numerous private corners.
The thing is, Potter’s a bit of a hoarder. He seems to keep every scrap of paper, and every useless knick-knack that every student has ever given him. One wall is absolutely plastered with thank you cards and doodles of the man scribbled in the margins of parchment. And he’s only been teaching for a little over a year. How’d he get so many?
Draco is, no surprise, a fantastic kisser, sucking on Harry’s bottom lip, slipping his tongue inside to massage Harry’s own. Harry groans into the kiss, opening his mouth further to let Draco in. He has an armful of a desperate wizard and now Harry sees what Draco meant about the handcuffs. An uninhibited Draco Malfoy is apparently touch hungry, his hands roving across Harry’s body, sneaking under the top of his collar and in between the buttons on his chest.
It was after midnight before Malfoy acknowledged his presence and even then he had only merited a brief nod as Malfoy was pulled out the door by his ‘no good,’ married, sometimes-boyfriend, Lucas. Harry was sure that Malfoy wouldn’t be returning to make further conversation this time. So he thanked a glassy eyed Lauren for the invitation, left his half-empty drink in the kitchen, and went home promising himself to stay as far away from Malfoy as possible.
“I didn’t lie,” Draco had insisted, though he was having to argue with Harry's back. “I fingered myself in the shower, and then wanked with the beads inside me.”
“So go to dinner with me,” he repeats.
Percy regards the situation through his portrait with only the hint of a leer. He’s been a surprisingly good teacher actually and Harry’s open to giving him a chance as long as he doesn’t catch him wanking at his boyfriend. Percy’s portrait only shows his body from the chest up, but Merlin only knows what he could be getting up to beneath the frame. He can lift his hands from his lap to do spells, so he must have something under there.
“I like spending time with you too,” says Draco.
“Impedimenta,” he shouts, but Draco through the mist is a difficult target and it must not hit because just as he raises his wand for the next spell he hears Draco shout out; “Everte Statum!” And as if he’s learned nothing since he was a second year he flies back arse-over-tit and slides across the duelling floor.
Francis Bellamy is a little cheat, but he’s a Slytherin so Draco’s hardly going to take points from his own house unless he has to.
With a few stretches Harry made his way to the toilet to clean himself up. A few spells helped remove the lingering stench of sweat and sex, and the taste of stale liquor from his breath. Living among Muggles was one thing, giving up the convenience magic completely was another thing entirely.
This is the part that Harry does actually feel guilty about. From a distance it must certainly appear that he is the most discerning wizard in the world. The truth is, as usual, far simpler than the lies and speculation spread by Rita Skeeter and eaten up by his adoring, but confused and often concerned public. The truth is he likes it.
It’s hard not to be utterly exasperated even though he knows Draco’s being purposefully forgetful. As if they hadn't been having an argument when they’d last seen each other this morning. And last night. And the night before that. “Drinks?” he says. “With Ron and Hermoine.”
Harry evades them to gasp as his cock is released and grinds against Draco’s trousers. “I’m soaking, Draco.”
Harry rolls his eyes at himself in the mirror as he reaches for the nail polish remover. Now it’ll be about his…
“Harry,” said Malfoy in a breathless voice and Harry inhaled sharply at the plea. Another first. Malfoy had never used his first name before.
They compared notes about apples, and Malfoy gave Harry advice about the pâtés then they wandered over to the checkout counter.
Malfoy’s expression did not so much as fall as it did freeze. The smile looked much more forced now. “From Mother. Yes, of course.” He looked down at the box and nodded to himself.
“Merlin yes, eat me out, Potter,” he moans. “Get me nice and wet for your cock.”
Harry wondered if Malfoy still had a sweet tooth. “What else is my fault?” he asked instead.
Draco adds the second leech to the cauldron and counts to five hippogriffs in his head then adds the third. He makes the mistake of looking up— three hippogriffs, four hippogriffs— Potter is standing on the other side of the table now looking curiously into the potion.
And Harry does reach down to pet Draco's furled hole. “Let’s see,” he says concentrating. “There was cleaning, then lubrication, then stretching,” and with each word he nonverbally and wandlessly casts the spells that Draco had cast on him. It’s the stretching that’s the worst, going from relaxed to suddenly full, then empty and gaping in the span of a second is enough to make your heart skip a beat. Draco’s mouth falls open and his balls draw up tight at the sensation, the muscles on his abdomen go rigid.
“And I assume you took payment for those flowers?” Another nod. “But decided to only tell me about them instead of actually bringing them to me?”
Maybe not in the prickly, kind of cute way he normally gets, but in a proper what-the-fuck-have-you-done-Potter way that is usually followed by a period of avoidance.
In the end, it’s Potter groaning out; “Twenty,” that prompts him to scramble for his wand. It’s rolled away and Draco has to stretch his upper body across the table to reach it. Potter takes advantage of the new angle and starts fucking him faster, hips snapping against his arse. Draco tries to lean up, but Potter drops his cock and presses both palms against Draco’s back and pushes.
Draco cries out and stills, let’s his arse milk Potter’s cock as he cums. Potter loves him messy, so Draco takes longer than necessary to come down from his high and lift off Potter’s cock. Let the man look at his messy stomach and chest.
Draco nodded and folded his arms across his chest. His tongue was pressed between his lips. “See you, Harry.”
And they did indeed leave the table and round the corner of the café hand in hand so Harry tried to put the images he had just witnessed from his mind. Abandoned once more to his quiet solidarity, he turned his attention to finishing his untouched espresso so he could get the hell back to his boring, yet predictable flat.
Harry thinks about this. “Sometimes,” he explains. “Sometimes I am.”
Slowly, he turns back and levitates the last few boxes down so he can have a closer look at the mirror. It’s big, and old, with writing at the top that reads “Erised stra ehru oyt ube carfru oyt on woshi,” which is frankly gibberish. It’s definitely a magical mirror because when Draco looks back into it the scene has changed.
It was growing colder in Paris, but Harry thought it was a bit premature for Malfoy to be wearing his scarf, particularly indoors. Since they both still lived in the same neighborhood they had run into one another on a number of occasions, but hadn’t exchanged any words beyond a brief hello or goodbye. Usually they just waved at one another from across the street, in mutual acknowledgement that the other person did in fact exist.
He’d held the image in his head and paced three times in front of the door while Draco had stood off to the side with Percy’s portrait in his arms. Once they stepped inside, even Draco had broken down and said the words; “Okay, you were right.”
He isn’t. It’s a surprise, Potter coming out and asking outright, but he had picked up on the hints. He’d also been very happy pretending he hadn’t.
“I most certainly am not,” says Percy. “I am the portrait of Percival Patricio, the first openly gay wizard in England to publish a series of works in the 18th century. My novel ‘Fool’s Folly’ is still a smashing success to this day.”
Harry felt his eyes watering up and hugged Lily to his chest, touched by his children’s easy acceptance.
They are in the middle of the Great Hall at Hogwarts and regularly attend professional development sessions about the dangers of that exact subject. Harry reminds him; “Aren’t you the Potions Master? What am I supposed to say here?”
Harry looked down at his plate to see that Draco’s somehow managed to steal half the piece in one bite. He shook his head in silent laughter, knocked the fork out of Draco’s hand, and entwined their fingers once more.
“You realise this is blackmail don’t you former-Auror-Potter?” he says, but his mouth is wet and open and ready for him.
“Malfoy, you followed me out to Hagrid’s hut. You got detention for being out after curfew, same as I did.”
“Yes,” he confirms. Harry’s stomach sinks a bit further, he doesn’t want to know who with but is also desperate to find out more. “It creates obsession,” explains Draco. “Not love.”
“Besides,” continues Draco. “He’s dead. Gone. Not exactly any spare blood hanging around to undo the magic.”
When it’s time to lift Draco, he’s as careful as possible, lifting his leg’s slowly up and then together until he’s hanging inverted from his ankles, pressed together from calf to thigh. Harry checks his arms, to make sure they have the support they need and are laying as comfortably as possible against Draco’s back.
“His nonverbal spells are impressive,” says Draco. “I wanted to see what he could do. Might be ready for some more specialised training, don’t you think?”
As he always does, Bill sighs and rings for a goblin to bring him the books.
“My son tells me that you’ve become friends,” she continued on.
“So?” snapped Malfoy. His arms were crossed over his chest now.
He’s wearing trousers under his robes tonight, so it takes Harry a moment to pull them off and part Draco’s robes around his chest and legs. The angle isn’t quite right either so Harry uses another cushioning charm under Draco’s lower back to lift his arse up. Draco’s mouth drops open again, probably thinking he’s about to get fucked, the tart, if the way he immediately spreads his legs is any indication.
Draco makes a little surprised noise as their lips press together and pushes Harry back. They don’t normally kiss. “Potion, Potter,” he says, but he’s amused, Harry can tell.
Draco just stares back, lips twitching in his almost smile. “Don’t worry, I like it.”
“Turn around,” he says, and Harry’s pleased to hear that his voice is sounding rough. “Slowly.”
“Fuck it,” he says and pulls out his cock. Draco looks like he’s in absolute heaven and he wants in.
Harry’s sips at his coffee as he examines his morning post. He has three new missives today. Two are new business, recommendations from past clients, but the third is printed on green parchment.
A hand that was almost femine in its delicacy slid down Harry’s torso to cup and massage his sac. At the same time the boy lowered his mouth until it was pressed around the base of Harry’s cock. He could feel the spongy tip of his crown being squeezed into the boy’s throat. Then he swallowed. Hard. Fuck, if that wasn’t amazing, Harry thought as he came. Who cared how old the mouth on him was if it could do tricks like that?
The squid isn’t a great listener, but he is a good distraction. Harry has to keep moving out of reach of the tentacles searching for his fish bucket. He has to duck and weave, remaining close enough to the water’s edge to toss the dead fish in, but far enough away to avoid capture. He tries to make a game of it, seeing how high and how far he can get those tentacles to stretch and it takes some of the sting out of the day.
“Alright, fine.” His tone was mild, but Harry could still see Malfoy rolling his eyes. “I spoke French, and someone offered me a free place to live and since your Ministry,” he shot Harry a suspicious look. “Saw fit to strip me of my inheritance, and all of my money, free, seemed like a pretty easy decision for me.”
Even through all of their summer conversations Malfoy had never turned the full force of his smile on Harry before the way he did at Harry’s words. Harry felt something he knew he really shouldn’t at the sight, and bit his tongue to keep himself from saying anything.
Matthew’s hand reached across the table again, this time to flick the hair from Harry’s eyes. Harry shook his head away, but laughed, enjoying the easy exchange. It had been a very long time since he’d so enjoyed the company of another person. He was thinking it would be good to increase the intimacy in their relationship.
At Christmas, Marie invited Harry to another one of Lauren’s parties. He didn’t see Malfoy there, but had decided not to bring Matthew along, just in case. He had a lot more fun than he had the last time. His French was better, and he recognized more of the people from around the neighborhood, and he invited Kate and her husband Jon along to add more English speakers in case he got nervous (which he didn’t).
“His name is Lucas?” Lauren repeated slowly.
“Fuck, Draco,” he moans.
Harry comes and stands at Draco’s side just in time to see Francis double cast and although the twitchy ears hex breaks up Frankie’s Protego the nonverbal leg-locker sends the boy to the floor in a heap.
It’s like being on a racing broom in the middle of a storm. Images and emotions whipping past Draco almost faster than he can process. The excitement of trying on his first robes as a first year, annoyance at Draco drawing the appraisal of Professor Snape, fury and humiliation at the sight of the Potter Stinks! badges.
Draco is writhing on the floor, blind and mute, probably trying to get Harry’s attention with the way he’s thrusting his hips up. Harry drops to his knees beside him and runs a hand down Draco’s chest, stopping when he finds the hard piece of flesh between his legs. Draco’s mouth drops open as he says something and thrusts up into Harry’s hand.
The flat was emptier than ever after the children left. Harry broke down and adopted a cat. She was 6 years old, a bit on the round side, and had black fur that stuck to Harry’s clothes. She woke him up in the mornings by sitting on Harry’s pillow and smacking him in the face with her tail. Harry took this to mean ‘I demand you feed me this instant you lazy man.’ Harry named her Pickles.
“Women too,” Draco insists.
‘84 is in easy reach, but they have to work together to shift the other boxes to get to ‘82. By the time they’ve got it, the mirror has been revealed and Draco can’t help catching his reflection in it to make sure his hair is still in place. There’s some dust on his robes, he brushes off, but otherwise, he’s still looking as expected. They get to ‘82 and Neville hoists it up in his arms.
Draco gives him two fingers, but he does close his eyes, and cover them with his hands. Harry looks around the neat office, far more organised than his own. There’s a large snake plant in the corner, Harry slips the vial in between the long leaves, making sure it’s tucked out of sight, but easy enough to retrieve when the time comes.
“Alright there, Malfoy?” asks Neville.
Not that Draco hadn’t enjoyed the fierce welcome back after a long summer. Hadn’t enjoyed that familiar flair of passion in Potter’s eyes just before he’d be turned around, slammed against the wall, and brutalised.
“Who?” tried Harry even though he knew it was in vain. He had hoped he’d been less transparent, but apparently he hadn’t.
Draco’s cheek twitches. It’s not quite a smile, but his face is more relaxed than it was. “It would have to be something very good then, I expect.”
“Alright,” he continues. “I’m still not comfortable with this then. You’ve more than enough money, why be paid at all?”
“The what?” snaps Draco, all prickly again right when Harry had got him to go all sweet. “There’s a sucking spell and you’ve never told me before? What the shit, Percy?”
Harry watched the juice trickle against the dark skin and drip into the hollow at the boy’s throat. He licked his lips at the sight and raised his glass in a toast. “Je veux t’enculer,” he said.
“Drink? Malfoy, we had a drink in the staff room last week.”
Percy sighs. “Ah, Reggie, he had a mouth viper, and just about the prettiest pink lips you’ve ever seen.”
Potter pulls his fingers out, stands up and throws Draco’s robes over his back. “Keep going,” he says even as Draco hears the sound of a belt buckle and rustling fabric.
“It wasn’t so bad really. He wasn’t ugly or anything, even though he was a lot older, and I had a lot of time to myself. And he helped me pay for L’Universite when I decided to enroll.”
The potion gurgles so he whips his head back around and judging by the big rolling bubbles he sees he’s at the halfway point. He picks up at sixteen hippogryphs just as Potter's hands run up his bare legs.
“Who do you think broke into your desk? Your locking spells are Auror grade. I'll give you that. It took me nearly twenty minutes to break through.”
The sixth years still haven’t noticed them, they haven’t even put out a scout, the amateurs. They look closer to completing their plan though, they’re all looking into a bag of something that Rigby is holding up.
“Fuck, I can’t wait for this weekend.” It was the usual type of conversational segue for Malfoy. He tended to jump from topic to topic without cause.
“Yes, but you’ve written replies agreeing to all of them.” Her pointed finger lands on a second stack. They are indeed replies he hasn’t yet sent off.
Pervy Percival stares back.
“If it’s your cock it will cancel once you ejaculate. It’s a fertility spell, don’t you know. For all the homosexual pureblood types who end up with the likes of me instead of their pretty wives. If you’ve spelled anything else you’ll need to cancel it manually.”
“I know,” said Harry, and he had. He just knew he couldn’t go back there anymore, even if he would be welcome.
Draco jumps as liquid metal unwinds from around his cock.
His hand lingers at his cheek for a moment, so Harry grabs it and gives it a little kiss.
The second the door closes, Harry locks and silences the room and turns on Draco with his wand.
The lotion is faintly scented by something Harry’s never been able to identify, but it’s light and pleasing, and only slightly feminine, and the scent seems to linger on his skin long after he leaves Draco’s house.
“Everywhere does croque madame,” complained Harry. He was still feeling a bit embarrassed but he took his seat at the outdoor table, the same as Malfoy. It was one of the few things he knew about French cuisine. A croque monsieur was basically a cheese toastie with the cheese on the outside instead of on the inside, and a croque madame came with an egg on top. Harry had been in Paris for two months now and was still trying to figure out why either had any business costing over a fiver.
“Merde. No wonder they never told the parents, the Governors would have had a field day with that information. I can’t believe the best Defense teacher we ever had was a Death Eater. Merde.”
Until meeting with Draco, Harry’s never thought he’s made a very convincing woman, or considered himself to be particularly feminine. But even he has to admit that he’s certainly passable. Draco, it seems, is an amazing stylist, and no one at the restaurant has glanced at Harry with anything other than appreciation.
He’s never been particularly good with his words, he’s always been better with actions. Maybe he can make Draco believe him.
Occasionally, Malfoy would wave to someone as they passed, or shout out something in French that Harry tried to grasp with his limited understanding. He caught words like hello and goodbye easily enough, it was everything in between that was a muddle.
Harry turns and it’s a mistake because the second of inattention costs him. The squid catches him by the ankle and pulls him into the lake. His back scrapes unpleasantly against the rocks and sand and then the water starts to fill his mouth and nose as his whole body is submerged. He throws the bucket, hoping to cause a distraction and reaches for his wand.
Professor Malfoy’s Personal Rooms
Harry smiles and laughs as he retrieves his wand from Draco to show the other student’s that there are no hard feelings. Someone has to set a good example for the children after all.
Somehow Harry did not manage to suppress his smile. He did try, really. “I don’t think that’s what that says at all, Malfoy.”
Harry’s never been a huge fan of excessive touch, but he lets Draco’s hands wander. One plays with the hair on the back of his neck while the other strokes across his chest, searching out the skin in between his buttons. Harry doesn’t care though, not as long as Draco keeps sucking his tongue like that.
Draco loves it, loves his cock bouncing with every thrust, his hole aching as it struggles to keep up with the continuous stretching, the friction near burning, but so wet and so good. He drops his wand and tries to get a hand under his robes, but they’re too long in the front and Potter’s got a death grip on his hips. Draco settles for grabbing his cock through the thick fabric and hisses at the rough material rubbing against his cock.
Draco manages brilliantly though, brings both hands up to wrap around the base of Harry’s cock and works them in tandem with his mouth until Harry is enveloped in a tight, sucking vacuum. It doesn’t take long like this, with Draco gazing adoringly up into Harry’s eyes with his mouth stretched tight around his cock. By the time Draco starts moaning again and the little vibrations tease and tingle, Harry can’t hold on any longer.
“Hurry up,” snaps Draco. Although his half-hard cock is stiffening under Potter’s re-attention, he’s too wound up to appreciate a fumbling handjob through all his layers of clothes.
Before he was ready, Harry was sitting in Albus’ favorite Thai restaurant, celebrating his birthday and his children’s last night in Paris. They had a portkey to catch tomorrow afternoon and he wouldn’t see them again until September 1st when he would make the trek to London to put James and Albus on the train. He was celebrating with all three of his children, but Malfoy had refused the invitation that Lily had extended. Apparently he had a date with his boyfriend.
The second his hand closes on the jar, Potter’s grip goes gentle again and his tongue searches for his hole. There’s less room to work, and Draco has to arch awkwardly to open the jar, but the tongue finds its target regardless.
The chocolate stained business card read:
She’s watching as Draco and Neville work together to carry a heavy armoire into the corridor. They’re using magic, of course, Draco’s holding the thing steady while Neville directs it. It’s a finicky old thing, but they get it settled in the end.
“I’m pretty sure it’s your fault that Moody turned me into a ferret.”
“I know what you need,” says Potter, blowing against the wet strip. Draco’s cock jumps in his hand. “Hands off now.”
Harry took the bait and tried not to think about how Malfoy’s two previous comments were related. “Why’s that?” he asked. Now he was trying not to pay attention to the way Malfoy’s tongue was once again in evidence, pressed against the top layer of his teeth.
“Sorry my arse isn’t fun enough for you, Potter,” says Draco. Then he stops and carefully sets his fork back down. It doesn’t even clatter as it hits the plate, Harry doesn’t know how he does it. “Actually... I know something that… could be sort of fun.”
“Anyway, forget that and come sit.”
The pillows turned out to be a fantastic idea because his body isn’t as stiff as he would have expected after sitting still for so long and now he has something to grab and clutch to his chest while he processes.
Potter’s office is a disaster. It’s no surprise since the man is supremely disorganised. Everything about him is a mess. His hair, his fashion sense, his work diary. Draco doesn’t usually come up here. Usually waits for Potter to corner him in some hidden corner, or to get desperate enough to come to his office.
Harry looked into his tea leaves and tried to read his fortune. “I didn’t want to be friends with you either, Malfoy.”
Upon seeing him, the boy smiled, flashing a row of teeth that were impossibly white against dark brown skin. The boy gestured to the food and rattled off something in Spanish, but Harry understood the meaning well enough.
Harry actually stopped walking at that then had to run to catch up to Malfoy who had kept going on without him. “You can’t just say things like that to people!”
Thankfully this bar was a mixing pot of cultural backgrounds and languages. He talked to a few men who spoke various proficiencies of English and drank enough to feel tipsy before he was approached by anyone of interest. He accepted the shot he was handed before he took in what was on offer.
The spell hits Draco’s right nipple first, then at his exuberant nod, Harry spells the left as well. Draco shouts then falls forward, and without his arms to catch him nearly winds up on his face. Harry grabs him by the shoulders just in time with a finite on his lips before Draco stops him.
The bicorn horn is stubborn, it keeps slipping away. Draco grips mortar and pestle desperately and cries out. He’s practically jerking off the pestle which probably doesn’t help anything, but Potter’s tongue and two fingers are busy stuffing themselves in his hole and there’s a hand giving his cock the barest hint of friction and he wants more.
There was a bell above the door now, Malfoy looked up when they walked through and Harry could tell from the look on his face that he hated the new addition. The scowl at the bell flitted to surprise and then something like glee before being forced back into boredom when Malfoy spoke.
“Christmas,” repeats Potter. He doesn’t look quite as happy, but there’s still a pleased puppy dog look on his face. “You’re not still unsure?”
“I care,” he explains. “Of course I do, but not enough not to want this. Not enough to stop wanting you.”
“It means, your mother sucks cocks in hell.”
He’s had enough time to learn the basics now though, even if he doesn’t move as smoothly as Draco and even if his chest sticks out a little more than the other man’s.
“What?” asked Malfoy.
The tongue retreated into his mouth and Malfoy smiled widely. “I’m celebrating my birthday with Lucas, he’s taking me to Giverny for the weekend.”
Harry shrugged. “I can use a translation spell when I really need to.”
He’d been a little nervous, standing out in the corridor, knocking so late, hoping Draco wasn’t already asleep and that he wouldn’t have to make the long walk back to his lonely tower rooms. He’d never come to Draco’s rooms without Draco before, but he’d had a long day and didn’t want to sleep alone.
The boy’s eyes locked onto him the moment they were revealed, and Harry was rewarded with a particularly hard suck. He moaned and thrust his hips up, wanting to get deeper into that wonderfully, wet mouth.
After that there were many such mornings when Harry either purposefully or accidentally ran into Malfoy on the street and followed him back to the shop. Once he’d even persuaded Malfoy to join him for a sandwich in front of the Eiffel Tower. Malfoy had proclaimed the spot loud, and ridiculously cliched and touristic, but had stayed for a full hour anyway.
The vibrator keeps going, stroking over his very sensitive prostate again and again and his colleague is staring right at him cumming all over himself. He’s not sure if the tears that blind his eyes are from the overstimulation or the humiliation. How could Potter do this to him?
“Merlin, calm down,” says Harry. “Yes, I do think we could have a relationship. In fact, I hate to break it to you, but we already have one.”
Then he made a plan.
“Don’t bother,” snaps Draco. “I’ve got to get to the dungeons. I’ll see you later.”
“Alright!” snaps Harry even as Draco tries to cover it up with a loud. “Thank you, Percy, that will be all!”
“Malfoy. Finish your potion.”
Potter stops trying to hold himself back, grips Draco by the hips and pounds into him. It’s a struggle to keep his feet planted, but Draco braces himself and takes it. “Harder,” he demands. His voice is muffled by the table and his hair is falling into his eyes, but Potter hears and starts panting as he sets a punishing pace.
“About three hundred Euros.”
In the end, it was Hermoine who made the biggest difference out of them all. Hermoine, who worked her arse off to learn the system and get herself promoted to the DMLE and start making changes from within.
“Mouth,” gasps Harry. “Want to cum in your mouth.”
“I know you’re a bit of an exhibitionist, Malfoy, but if you want to get your hands on my cock that badly I’m going to have to insist on a bit of privacy— ow.” The second hex lands on his nipple. Harry rubs it through his shirt and robes despite how that might look to the rows of students.
“Are you sure you wouldn’t rather show me your cock?”
He wanted to tell her he owed her his life, but instead only nodded.
Harry chanced a look at Malfoy from the corner of his eye. The other man looked sullen, his arms were crossed across his chest and he was staring resolutely at the crumb-covered table. But he wasn’t raising any objections, and he wasn’t cursing either Harry or Lauren, so it must be all right. Resolved, Harry gave his best Saviour smile and said; “I’d love to, Lauren.”
Draco pulls his cock roughly, it’s still sticky with pre-cum and lube from earlier and it feels hot and heavy in his hand. Potter licks his lips and runs a hand down Draco’s thigh from the knee over his shoulder straight down to his open hole. They both moan when Potter’s fingers find the dripping mess there.
“Well, as much as I’d enjoy you worshipping attention on me, one of us needs to remain level headed enough to administer the antidote,” explains Draco who then pauses to suck another kiss into his neck. “Besides,” he says after popping off with an obnoxious sound. “I don’t think you’d enjoy the lack of control. I figured I’d take it.”
Malfoy’s lips twitched. It was almost a smile. “Oh, quite a lot of things, Potter. But first, desert.” With an arrogant flick of the wrist Malfoy called over the waiter and ordered something in French that Harry was only sure had chocolate in the title. “Now, are you here on Ministry business?”
“What did you use?” he asks, panting as Draco repeats the little ring motion.
Harry has to squeeze his eyes shut and process that for a moment which is when he notices his glasses are missing. “I’ve lost my glasses,” he says stupidly.
By the time Harry had turned onto his street, alone now, with nothing but dirty hands and a paper wrapper left from his kebab, he was smiling foolishly. Life felt good for once. He lived in an amazing neighborhood, in an amazing city, he had great friends, and a boyfriend who cared about him, Ginny didn’t feel like killing him anymore and he was invited to Christmas dinner with his children, and wasn’t that halo around those street lights absolutely gorgeous?
Harry looked at him. Malfoy’s tongue was poking into his cheek now, he could see the bulge of it beneath his skin. He was probably biting it, Harry realized.
Every minute or two another card snaps, leaping off his skin with a sharp slap if balanced too precariously, or rattling harshly against his skin if tucked firmly against a rope. Each time one goes off he can hear Percy groan.
Harry resists rolling his eyes again. “You know I’m not hopelessly heterosexual.”
“It’s not my place to comment,” he said. Malfoy’s scowl deepened.
“Pas d’arret,” snapped a familiar voice. It was followed by an angry gesture. “Cinq tomates ne.”
It’s not hard to chase the edge again. It’s been hoovering, Draco’s just been doing his damnedest to keep it at bay. But Potter wants to see him cum one more time so that’s what he does. It’s every bit as fantastically torturous as his other two orgasms. This time his cock barely twitches as he cums, he has so little left to give, but his whole body shakes with the sensation and he’s crying again without even realising it. But this time, thankfully, the moment he cums, the vibrator switches off and falls wetly from his body. His arsehole gapes around its loss, it feels numb, and he can still feel the phantom sensation of the vibrator deep inside.
“Sorry, Professor,” says Francis automatically, but he’s already eyeing Frankie for more.
Predictable, Draco groans, but Harry has him laughing again with an exuberant spin. He lets him go round a few times, but not enough to make him too dizzy, and stops him so he’s got his back this time. Draco hangs his head and stares at the floor, which he complained about earlier because there was less to look at down there.
Harry shrugged again and passed Malfoy the tea tin. “Yeah, but I just didn’t know how to order tea how I like it in French.”
Draco considers the proposal over his tea. He’s been avoiding taking that step not because he doesn’t want it, but because he might want it too much. Potter’s already crawling into every aspect of his daily life, if starts claiming his nights too it’s going to hurt all the more when it’s gone. He still doesn’t quite believe it when Potter says he wants to be with him of all people. It’s probably just proximity speaking. There aren’t exactly any other horny gay teachers in rural Scotland to shack up with.
Malfoy slurped his tea. Loudly.
However, Harry found out very quickly that for all of his grand plans, he was not very good at being on his own. He was used to having someone remind him to turn off the oven, or to know what kind of milk to buy at the market. Twice he’d run out of loo roll unexpectedly, and it had taken him an embarrassing number of attempts to remember how to cook his eggs how he liked. In defense of his failings he took to living like the bachelor he’d never had the chance to be. He wore his pants two days in a row and ate his cereal out of the chipped mug when all the bowls were dirty. He left rings on the glass coffee table and drank beer with breakfast when he ran out of juice. He killed his first houseplant and bought either far too much food, or far too little, for one person to eat.
It’s like being doused with a bucket of cold water and suddenly Draco wants the little snake back, wants the spark back in Potter’s eyes, and wants him to order Draco to his knees. He’d been sort of looking forward to doing a bit of begging. But as Potter retrieves the little snake it’s clear that he has no intention of fighting or fucking.
“So you’ll go to Eddie’s rooms,” says Potter.
He spells Draco first who immediately howls and then spells himself. Dear Merlin, it's fantastic. It’s like the tightest arse and the wettest mouth all in one, covering his whole cock, rippling up and down his shaft. He falls into Draco and they end up propped against one another, leaning on each other’s shoulders, although Harry’s got the use of his hands. He digs his fingers into Draco’s waist sharp enough to leave bruises, but at the moment he doesn’t even care. The absolute only thing that matters is that intensely pleasurable feeling surrounding his cock.
“Fuck off,” he snaps. He has less than a minute left to get the lacewing flies in if he wants full potency. He tries to step forward again, but Potter’s hands are tight on his waist. “Potter,” he growls and breaks away.
The potion Draco has him to use on his hair leaves it soft and wavy, a texture Harry’s never been able to duplicate outside Draco’s posh flat. Later Draco will style the usually unruly locks, but for now he simply brushes the water  out of the strands and sets the brush away again.
Draco swivels with ease before the class, back straight, turned to the side with one foot in front of the other and his right arm behind his back. He’s deadly gorgeous like this, long and lean, with his wand raised between them, grey eyes challenging.
A laugh was still on his lips when he looked across the room in search of the waiter with their wine. Instead his eyes lighted on a pale figure, sitting across the dining room, alone at a table set for two, staring back at him.
“Couldn’t have waited,” argues Drago. “I was so wet and horny you have no idea. Had to take care of myself. My greedy hole needed to be filled so desperately.” Draco’s fingers form a small ring around Harry’s cock and Draco pushes down slowly, letting the small ring open up around him, Harry can almost imagine he’s sinking into Draco’s tight hole.
“You think I want a wife,” Draco says as he pushes the frock from his shoulders, allowing it to slip over his frame to pool onto the floor.
Sergio pouted perfectly. His lips were plump and swollen looking, and they were pressed out and together. His eyes were closed, adding to the look of pure concentration on his young face.
“You name?” the boy said after they’d pushed away their plates.
Draco looks damned pleased with himself too. “You’re amazing, Harry,” he says. “So perfect for me. Let me show you. I’ve got to have you.”
He’s not sure what Draco wants, but he’s not sure what he wants either. But for now, Harry has this.
Harry smiled at Malfoy sadly. “It doesn’t have to be.”
Malfoy just shrugged and leaned against the back of his chair. “I’ve used that one at least three times this week alone. Bet you don’t make it through the month without it.”
“Finished? Good,” says Draco. “Come here, you’re going to have to feed it to me to make the magic take hold since I’m the one who brewed it.”
“I’ve been waiting.” Harry could practically hear the pout, but did not look up. Instead he reached his fingertips under his glasses and pinched his eyes. His mind was decidedly fuzzy and he’d had far too much to drink to think rationally.
“Remus was definitely second though,” remembered Harry. He felt guilty for not thinking of it before.
Saturday, September 29
Monday, October 8
Malfoy passed him a bottle of wine with an orange label and said, “Try this one instead, it pairs much better with fish.”
“Is that the way you talk to customers at your business?” asked Harry.
Which just reminds Harry that he’s still wound up and Draco’s already had his. Without Harry. With a portrait.
Harry’s not quite sure how his toes could look anything but manly, even with the hair removal potions his feet are too large and knobby, but Draco caresses them as if they were as finely boned as a woman’s. A lotion is rubbed into his heels as Draco’s fingers massage beneath his arches, and then another bottle is in Draco’s hands and Harry’s toenails are being painted a bright and playful purple. Apparently Draco’s in a spirited mood tonight.
Lauren nodded. “With three kids, and he’s not the sort to leave his wife.”
There had been a day or two of discomfort when they’d first arrived by portkey. He hadn’t seen them since that last strained Christmas, where there had been an uncomfortable level of honesty about Harry’s actions amongst the Potter and Weasley families. He was sure little Lily didn’t fully understand what being gay entailed, but even she hadn’t been spared the information that her father had chosen to cheat on his long-time wife with an embarrassing number of men.
Malfoy’s mouth snapped shut and this time Harry didn’t have time to resist before he was being pressed against the kitchen wall, with Malfoy sliding his tongue in between his teeth to wrestle his tongue. This time Harry shoved him away with force.
Three measures go into the potion. The next stage has started and he has to work swiftly now.
“Alright, alright,” said Harry, wiping tears from his eyes. “Sorry! But you know that wasn’t actually Moody, that was a Death Eater under a Polyjuice? So technically you were turned into a ferret by someone from your own side.”
He winces as the fluid dampens the seat of his briefs. For the first time, he is thankful for the requirement of the heavy formal robes even though it’s quite balmy for the first of September.
He was right. Harry had followed Malfoy without a thought. He stopped instantly at the realization, coming to a freeze just beside the fishmonger. The smell was unfortunate.
“Ready for more, baby?” Harry asks. “Think you can take it all for me?”
The moan elongated into a string of Spanish profanity. Harry still wasn’t sure what most of it meant, but he was pretty sure that ‘duro’ meant harder and he knew ‘rapido’ meant faster. When he started hearing those words with increasing volume and repetition Harry grasped Sergio around the waist, flipped their positions and bore him down into the mattress.
Draco stares at him for a long moment, Harry wants to give him space but he can’t help reaching out to twine their fingers together. He hopes Draco will let him kiss him again.
“He hates me,” said Harry in a reflex. Then he thought about it and changed his mind. “I mean, he used to hate me, now I think we’re too old for that. He tolerates me.”
It makes him cry again, or maybe he hadn’t properly stopped. The tears leak from his eye, so he wipes them against Potter’s shirt. He’s a mess both emotionally and physically, so fucked out that he doesn’t think he’s going to want sex for at least a week. All he wants to do is curl closer to Potter and be taken care of. A cloth settles across his shoulders, covering up his shivering body. He looks down and twitches at what he doesn’t see.
Draco’s wasting no time wherever he is. Is he somewhere nearby? Or has he made it back to the castle? Wherever he is, he’s clearly found himself a toy, Harry has no reason to suspect it’s anything but a toy that is battering his prostate. Draco likes it much rougher than he does, Harry knows, and it’s almost difficult to track all the different sensations. Harry can feel his own hand on his cock, struggling to keep up with Draco’s pace, but then when it feels like another hand joins his, stroking in tandem it’s mind-blowing.
Very briefly Harry considered arguing over the tab, but decided it wasn’t worth it and instead followed Malfoy through the city, down the stairs to the Métro and onto the crowded train. A few quid was definitely worth having someone else navigate the tricky underground system that Harry hadn’t had the heart to brave quite yet.
“He was here when I moved in. Found him in the hall closet. Snape must have shoved him in there after he removed him from the dungeon.”
Harry grins at him, eyes crinkling at the corners beneath his glasses like they do when he’s extremely pleased. Then he ducks down and gives him a peck on the cheek.
“Obviously not,” Harry snapped harsher than he had intended. Malfoy gave him a surprised look, but returned to his reading quickly enough.
Draco huffs again, but maybe he’s also blowing the hair out of his eyes because he’s hung his head back and is looking at himself in the mirror from an upside-down angle now. “You and that bloody list,” he says.
Draco starts moving his hand faster and Harry can feel the skin on his cock getting tighter and tighter.
Harry had perked up the second Pervy Percy had made the suggestion.
“You want all these?” Neville asks. There’s about ten stacked in a haphazard pile, leaning against a tall mirror.
It’s too much and still not enough. Draco doesn’t know if he wants it to end or go on forever. The vibrator keeps thrusting and he can’t hold back his noises any longer. It hurts now, the constant buzzing and pressure, and his whole body is stretched and shaking.
Malfoy made a vaguely interested noise, but accepted his piece of chocolate torte, several seconds later, with more glee. “So then, why spy on me?” He asked just before taking an inhumanely large bite.
“So good,” agrees Harry.
“Exactly,” said Malfoy smugly.
“Hey,” he says. “Wake up.”
Draco’s caught up and as he wrenches Harry’s arm back his papers go flying to the floor. Draco steps on top of his agenda and shoves him against the wall. “You do realise it’s my arse on the line if anything happens to that potion. I know you took it and I want it back— now.”
“Fifth year spells only, Mr Bellamy,” he sighs, sorting Frankie out with a wave of his wand. “Nonverbal spells are in the sixth year curriculum.”
“Well spotted,” says Draco, already taking it from Harry’s hands to fasten it around his neck. His voice is still a little stilted, but his hands brush Harry’s hair out of the way with perfect gentleness, so that no curls get stuck in the clasp.
“Git,” said Harry, because he couldn’t think of an appropriate insult when he was suitably impressed. “Is there much need for a degree in floristing?”
“Well,” said Matthew after a long pause. “I guess that’s it then.”
Draco takes one look at his red face and laughs. “Sorry,” he says, looking anything but. “I didn’t think it mattered. You’ve never seemed to care about any of my toys.”
“I thought that phrase applied only to children,” Harry continues.
It’s not perfect. Harry’s still soaked and now covered in dirt and sand, with pebbles digging into his back. But he has his arms full of a frankly hot man who’s finally admitted to liking him and he can feel another cock hardening against his own even through the layers of wet clothing. Draco whimpers and makes those pathetic little noises that always shoot straight to Harry’s cock. It’s Draco who grows desperate first, panting against Harry’s lips as he thrusts his hips.
Potter surreptitiously adjusts himself in his trousers, having forgotten to change into his formal robes, of course. Draco hopes he’s chafing. It would serve the bastard right for jumping on him without any proper planning or prep.
Draco makes an exuberant slash across Harry’s diary. It’s rather unnecessarily dramatic in Harry’s opinion, but he’s not going to argue.
“My beads,” says Draco. “I got on my knees, right here on this bed, bent over, and stuffed my hole full. We haven’t used those yet, but we should. They’re so good, Harry. They fill me up so nicely, I had to pop each one in slowly, let them stuff me full one by one by one.”
Potter’s eyes linger for a moment. Draco wonders if he’s going to press the issue. “Okay then. Christmas.”
“Oui?” the man said as he turned around.
Draco doesn’t answer but starts sucking on Harry’s ear as his fingers dip below his waistband. It’s a tight fight, but he wiggles in, pressing along Harry’s thickening cock, pulling it up from his leg to press against his stomach.
The heat on his cheeks does something for Harry. He didn’t figure it out until after the first time they fucked, but Draco goes just as pink when he’s angry as he does when he’s turned on. It’s fantastic.
Harry kept smiling. “I know.”
“Fat is it?” he quips then winces as his head hits the wall and Draco’s wand (not the one he is hoping to feel) pushes against the underside of his jaw.
