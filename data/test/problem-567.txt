There was an unfortunate number of new Slytherins but the returning students welcome them warmly. They were the Slytherin students who stood by their house and know it’s not evil.
“Oh good, I became worried when you didn’t show, then harry left to find you. And then he didn’t turn up-”
Soon breakfast was done, Draco barely clearing his plate of the eggs and toast, with three mugs of coffee consumed. Harry stood. “Well, good luck today.”
She looked away. “I’m not sure that’s quite ethical Draco. I’ll look though the rules and guidelines and see if anything is against it, if not, I will allow it.”
The boy in the middle, spoke, grinning but Draco could see the meaning under it. “Just a bit of fun Professor.”
He sensed the kids felt much better than when they started, he hoped him meeting them helped. He hoped talking to them helped but he can never Ben sure. Once the kids were gone he used his wand to return the great hall to its normal tables before walking out to go to his own classroom.
Draco stayed quiet, silently crying into Harry’s shoulder. Harry spoke softly. “How about we get some tea and write Hermione a letter? I’m sure she’d be happy to hear from you.”
But he felt judging stares everywhere he went. And the school year hasn’t even started. He was still setting up his quarters and classroom, nostalgia hitting him as he walked into the old potions room where Snape taught. Draco felt a small, weak smile as he walked past the desks, remembering all the times he wouldn’t pay attention and would put his attention into bothering Potter and his pals.
McGonagall glared back, gently ushering Draco outside the door. Once it was closed she turned to him. “Professor, I understand your anger in this. I’m angry too but to make a real difference we have to work with the rules, not against them.”
Draco looked away with a blush.He honestly never thought of that. Never gave into the hope that he could date his crush that he barely admitted to himself he had. Harry always felt so out of his reach, on different levels; one was a hero, the other was a death eater, there was only one way that would end.
As he read over the essay he sighed. Guilt starting to hit him. The Hufflepuff was a good student. Draco knew more than  others that potions can be difficult to get a handle on. So many times he had to help others in his house on potions.
“No. I actually write stories, as a way to vent, to recreate those events and make them better. To help me realize how much I couldn’t prevent.”
The three boys ran off and the first years looked grateful and scared. One of the Hufflepuffs, a girl, in the first year groups huffed, following the others. “Guess this is what happens when you take classes with Slytherins.”
She bowed her head, not wanting to anger him more. “Yes sir.”  She cleared her throat, pointing to each word with her finger. “
Once it was all over and the students went to their common rooms of their respective houses to celebrate and rest for the beginning of classes. Though he did want to talk to the Slytherin house, it can wait. He did write the flyer up stating he wanted  a small meeting his his new students in the great hall after breakfast, and asked a house elf to hang it in the Slytherin common room, thanking him profusely.  After that he headed to bed, wondering what to say to these kids he’s now  in charge of.
year boy, hufflebpuff failing at it. Draco walked over immediately, seeing it’s odd color of vomit green. “Mr.Turner, are you aware your solution should be a bright green, not vomit?”
Harry rolled his eyes and took the glass. “I’m not your personal house elf, you’re lucky I like you.” He said with a small smirk before walking away. Draco blushed softly, looking at the table.
Mr. Turner, stood at his door, papers in hand. He saw Draco. “Hello Professor Anderson. I finished the essay you wanted.”
Draco sipped his cup of coffee in hand as he entered the potions room, 15 minutes before any the of the students should arrive. He took another sip of his coffee before placing it down on the desk and getting to work of writing out  today’s lesson on the chalk board which was a simple introduction to Potions along with the first potion there are going to try making at the end of the month; wiggleweind potion. He wanted to start on something practical and they could actually use before moving onto ones they may never use outside a classroom.
Draco shrugged, picking at his food. “A bit. I’m starting first with a small meeting with Slytherin house here after breakfast, I want to get to know them and see what's been going on with the house. After that, it will just be normal potions.”
Draco felt his eyes water. “You’re all too kind to me. Every single one.” He crunched up her letter, feeling mad for some reason, he wasn’t sure why.
“Fair point. At least you had a house to live in. They kept me in a cupboard under the stairs; barely any room to sleep.”
Hours later he cried out, startled awake in bed as a thunderstorm rocked the castles walls, raining pelting heavily onto his glass window.
years and were actually making potions. They were still working on shrinking solutions. He walked around the class and observed, staying quiet.
He took it gratefully and drank a big gulp as Harry sat next to him, his own plate of food appearing. “Good morning Professor Anderson.”  Draco looked over. “Good morning Potter.”
Draco stayed quiet, not answering her question. “Have a good night, headmaster.” He said before walking out, feeling a protective anger flaring inside for the kids in his house.
Harry stirred in bed. He wasn’t holding Draco anymore but had turned over. He turned over with a yawn. “Draco?”
Draco felt rage fill him. A different type than the anger he felt as a child; he felt protective. Like someone hurt his own child. And in a way, they have.
He turned quickly, wand out, panting, feeling like he couldn’t get enough air, no matter how fast and hard he breathed. Tears and water dripped from his face.
She smiled. “It’s a bogart. They turn into whatever the person they’re facing fears the most. The only way to beat it is to use the spell
Draco just held it and  felt his heart beating so he’s it may beat out of his chest. Harry smiled, gently elbowing him. “Go on. Open it.”
Draco sipped his tea. “I want to put some kind of listening charm on the students that are getting the worst of it. A sixth year came to me today, crying. Apparently one of the many Griffendors caused it. The bullying is out of control.”
Draco glared softly at both of then. “Yes, now if you will excuse me while I enjoy the rest of my lunch.”
Draco was just mumbling and crying everything his father did to him and also apologizing for all the bullying he put Harry and his friends though.
He sighed. He got up, going to the Slytherin table. “Excuse me, have any of you seen Dra-Professor Anderson?”
“Well Wilber, I promise, no one is killing anyone. But I will do everything in my power to help you, ok?”
Once inside Draco huffed. “I hope that was your idea of a joke.” He said to Harry. Harry looked at him, a little more serious, a hesitant smile on his face. “And if it’s not?”
As he walked to his own quarters he ran into Harry, almost literally. He was so focused on his anger he didn’t see him until last second.
He got Draco to bed, took his shoes off, undressed him and got his covered by his blankets. Draco had tear stains on his cheeks, eyes red.
Micheal vented everything. Apparently some Griffendors burned his books and called him a death eater,  how often he’s made to feel worthless for something he had no choice over.
Draco nodded, smiling. “Good. Good.” He turned to the rest of the class. “Now class, do you think Wilber is evil?” All the heads shook no. “Do you want to hurt him?” And the heads shook no. “Has he done anything worthy of being bullied?”
When it was lunch Harry didn’t find Draco anywhere. He got to the Professors table up front and got his food, eating and waiting. But Draco didn’t show.
Professor Trelawney saw him and came over with that far away look she’s never lost. “You are such a familiar sprit, do I know you?”
Harry shrugged as he walked closer. “No, just wondering why you’re taking your lunch here and not in the great hall.”
The third years turned, there was three of them, boys, all from Grriffendor. He sneered down at them. “Grriffendor, of course. What is the meaning of keeping my students from class?”
Once it was linch he felt the need to hide. Teaching so many children and ones close to adulthood was exhausting. His social battery already low and its only been half a day.
He cleared his throat as he got to his desk. “Welcome, to potions. I am your professor, Albert Anderson, I hope we can have a good year. First thing we’re going to learn and attempt-“  He pointed to the board. “Wiggleweind. It’s a very practical potion, it’s a healing potion and an antidote to many other poisonings but before we do that, I trust you all brought the required book for first years?”
Draco didn’t waste any time the next morning. He didn’t bother sleeping, knowing he’ll only be woken by nightmares and visions of his past he’d rather ignore.
Harry smiled as he stood. “You have today. Com’on, I’ll help you.” He helped Draco up, holding his hand before they stopped at the door. “Wait, your glasses.”
A hand shot up, near the front. Draco pointed to him. “You. Stand up.” He corrected himself, noting how sharp his command sounded. “Please.”  The boy did.  “What’s your name?”
Draco tied his tie and did his hair and adjusted his glasses about ten times over. The new and returning students would be here in an hour. His anxiety made his hands sweat and shake. Fuck, maybe he should just completely put a glamour spell on himself and be done and hell with the side effects.
“I still blame myself for Cedrics death. I blame myself for everyone’s death. If it wasn’t for me they wouldn’t have died. But I’m getting better, little by little.”
Harry smiled, glad to see more of Dracos sarcastic spirit back.  Draco sighed. “Get me some paper and quill.”
There wasn’t anything that seemed upsetting. Harry folded the paper up and put it in his pocket.  Neville leaned over from his spot next to Harry. “Is the Professor ok? He looked pretty upset.”
Once lunch was over, he readied the classroom for the sixth years. They were making more advanced potions. When he was double checking his ingredients one of his students came in, sitting down and huffing into the closest seat, looking like he might have a panic attack.
Draco glared. “No. The kids in my house are being bullied every day for a selection they didn’t choose. You know some of them are being called and even accused of?”
year him would think of adult him now.  Going to the pub, with potter, as a fellow Professor. He almost chuckled to himself.
Harry chuckled. “In a sense. I remember the last time I felt good about fighting was teaching when Umbridge made it illegal to actually learn to defend ourselves. So that’s what I’m doing.”
They sat there and drank their tea in a comfortable silence. Draco spoke up suddenly. “What do I even say to her?”
“I’m glad to hear that. It’s interesting seeing the sorting hat ceremony from this side. I remember bring so scared of going into Slytherin.”
Draco gently patted Wilbers shoulder. “Thank you Wilber, you can go back to your seat.” Wilber went back to his seat quickly as Draco continued. “I will be the first to admit, Slytherin house seems to…attract dark wizards but…being sorted into it doesn’t automatically make you evil or trouble. You get as much choice of the house your sorted into as you do the color of your skin.”
He went looking for him himself. He checked the potions room first, as it was closest, wasn’t there. He checked the Professors bathrooms, he wasn’t there.
But the nagging feeling of panic didn’t leave. He looked down at his arm. The dark mark has long since gone but he swears he can still feel it’s impression in his skin, like when you wear something tight too long. He sucked in a shaking breath and quickly got a long sweat shirt on to hide it.
years decided to burn his new school books. They called him a worthless piece of shit, they called him a death eater. I don’t care if it’s against guidelines or school rules, I will stop this however I can, even if that means going over your head.”
Many of the kids looked scared, mummering if it was safe. Harry nodded to them. “I assure you, it’s completely safe. The worse that may happen is that you pass out for a few seconds. In which that happens, you’ll get some chocolate to help recover. Now, who wants to start?”
Wilber smiled weakly. “Pizza. American pizza though. My family went to America for vacation. They have such good food everywhere.”
He gently held her arms. “It’s alright. What’s wrong? What’s happened?”  He tried to move her hands gently but she kept firm. He became extremely concerned. “Emily, please, what is going on? Has someone hurt you?”
“No, I’m not. I have to get going, it was nice meeting you as well.” He said as he went around him with a huff.
Draco huffed as he adjusted his hair one more time, making sure it was dark enough to mask his platinum blonde to a light brown before walking out the door.
year.”  Draco nodded. “And the boy in the back.” The boy cleared his throat. “I’m Benjamin Cartwright, also 5
Neville was quiet just long enough that Draco thought his identity was already found out but Neville just smiled. “Well, it’s great to finally meet you, Professor Anderson. I’ve only seen glimpses of you, guess you’re not very social?”
“Fine. It’s just….” He looked away. “I remember sitting in these desks. I was a right prat, wasn’t I?”
years spoke up. “I don’t know but something was bothering him today. He’s never been that mean.”  Harry nodded and went back to the Professors table, asking if any of them have seen him, even Hagrid, thou the doubts Draco was near Hagrids hut  at all.
He went to the sink, turning it on cold before splashing his face with it. When he had enough he looked in the mirror and was taken back to a point in his life he never wanted to go back.
A few of the kids at the Slytherin table waved to him. He waved back, giving a weak smile. He was glad they at least seemed welcoming of a new head of Slytherin. He got to the Professor's table at the front of the great hall and as soon as he sat down food appeared in front of him.
“You were at times. You’re a good person Draco. We wouldn’t have let you back if you weren’t.” She said softly to him.
Harry managed to open the door to Dracos quarters, Harry looked around and didn’t see much. There was a bed, looked like his but with green sheets of his house, a suitcase and picture frame that held a photo of his mother and Draco as a baby, his mother looking softly at him, he looked like he was about one years old. Probably the only time Draco was treated as he should have been as a child.
“Certainly. I’ll get right on it.” He said as the door to the headmasters office opened. McGongal greeted them. “Hello Professor Potter.”
Once there, there was two teas waiting. Draco sat down on the couch, taking the tea that was on the table as Harry started a fire easily with his wand.
“Get me some fire whiskey and maybe I’ll consider it.” Harry grinned,  going up to the bartender. “One butterbeer and fire whiskey-“
Draco saw this and treaded lightly, having a good idea of why they were here. “Didn’t have a good lunch?”
Ron stares at her strangely while I snort into the drink I have poured myself, “It was less of a trial but more of condemnation.”
“Fine, I will leave it be for now. But since I am already here can you show me to Draco’s room?” I ask, anxiety creeping up my throat.
But before I can draw him into my arms, Shenan whinnies to get his attention. He smiles softly, the blissful empty version of a child. I run a hand through my hair as he strokes the horse’s nose. I let him do it and instead throw a look towards the end of the stable to where I hope Andrea will appear soon. She doesn’t but after a few minutes Draco’s figure straightens again. I don’t notice it because I have been looking away. I only turn back when I hear the jingle of the stirrups and the sound of the saddle being lifted again with some grunting.
And Ron kept his eyes closed, half dreaming half awake, when a voice called his name, “Ron...” whispered Hermione— yes, the classroom smelled like Hermione. Chocolate and sweet strawberries.
“Draco. Draco,” I chant, trying my best not to instinctively touch him, “Look at me, Draco, please. What is happening? Give me a sign. Anything. Please.”
“Potter!” he yells, trying and failing to hide the panic in his eyes. It seems he needs more time to rebuild his masks, “What is going on?”
The blonde doesn’t react at all, so I wave my hand over the pale form, dispelling any kind of spell still lingering on him. For a moment Draco startles, giving a pained sound. I immediately start to calm him down. The other falls silent again. It takes a few more moments until grey eyes blink slowly open.
I actually get his attention and grey eyes land on me. Luckily the steps are just broad enough for me to walk up them next to him. He follows once again and eventually, we stand with the horse’s back at the height of our thighs. I nudge his right leg, at a loss on how to get him to make the last move from the steps onto Shenan’s back. I breathe a sigh of relief when apparently muscle memory from his youth days kicks in and he moves his leg over the palomino’s back. His strength gives out halfway through and his knee lands on the middle of the cloth. But Shenan doesn’t even twitch only gives a soft snort. I support Draco from the side, so he manages to slide completely onto the horse’s back.
“Yes, I know. You said that numerous times,” I give her a weak smile, “Now show me that list, please.”
“What – “ I ask but am interrupted by the chair on the other side of the table scraping over the floor.
I am pouring over one of my textbooks when I hear the door squeak behind me, alerting me to someone entering the room. Since Kreacher always apparates in, it can only be Draco as no one else is currently at the house. Knowing it’s easier for him to speak if I’m not staring at him, I just sit straighter but don’t directly turn to him.
laptop is mostly working but I don't have internet where I'm living during the week, so updates will be mostly confined to the weekends until my roommate finally gets the router. Currently I am leeching off my university's wifi ;)
“Alright, what do they want to hear from me? The names of the people I killed and tortured. How I enjoyed doing so?” he sneers and I wince as those questions actually are on the list, marked red though.
“Of course not. It was a mask. His pain to bear. Malfoys don’t complain and don’t react to pain. They don’t show emotion either. That was apparently part of what was drilled into his head from infancy on,” she strokes my back in comfort, her own tears visible.
The blond is pressed to the wall next to the door, body tense and arm held out in a defensive way in front of him. The grey eyes are wide in panic and the light hair chaotic. I hastily move from the couch, the fast move and the heavy book tumbling to the floor, causing Draco to scare anew. Immediately I freeze.
“A riding school then,” she agrees, “I can give you the address of a stable where I have sent patients before. I know they give riding lessons but make the adjustments if someone needs special treatment due to an illness.”
I haven't been paying attention because I'm so busy with university, so I missed the fact that I planned to end this part of the series on the last chapter. I only noticed today. However I have no clue what to name or tag the next part yet, so for now I'm going to publish it in 'Healing begins' until I find the time to start a new story. Not sure how to transfer it yet but I will tell you.
But I never find out what Lucius said because he suddenly falls to the side, his eyes closed and left hand unresponsive again. I am just fast enough to catch him before he can hit his head on the ground. Sadness choking me, I brush over the tear tracks on his cheeks, cleaning the wetness away. A tear of my own runs from my eye as I pull his unconscious body close to me, curl around him and cry once again for a broken boy whose pain no one recognized before it was too late.
I stay silent and let myself fall back into the soft couch, eyes closing. On one hand I definitively do enjoy a bit of time without having to worry about Draco all the time, however I don’t really manage my thoughts to leave him. Luckily I am interrupted once again when Andromeda comes back, carrying a still sleepy Teddy in her arms. Nonetheless he squeals when he sees me, his hair turning black. He wriggles in his grandmother’s hold until she sighs and simply deposits him in my lap.
“Would you cease pacing?” said Atieno, turning around. “It is worse than your constant inane chatter. I, however, came up with an idea, which is more than what you could offer.”
Harry slowly opened the door and snuck through the house, his plan failed when he saw Molly standing there laughing at him. He decided he would just hug her and so he did, “I’ve missed you Molly!” Harry shouted and pulled from the embrace and cleared his throat, “sorry for the informal visit, this is official Hogwarts business.”
“I almost forgot,” said Professor Sprout, cause all the students to pause. “Four people to a tray, one person from each house. There is a large supply of pots here – compost in the sacks over there – and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula, it’s teething.”
Harry sighed and muttered under his breath. He sent Draco one last look before he caved and just walked into the dark room, which held no light at all and was deathly silent. He twisted around when he heard the door close and spotted Draco’s bright hair, which made him smirk as it meant this wasn’t a trap or Draco wouldn’t be in here.
Harry leant back in his chair, immensely amused at the fact that James had just rendered the entirety of the Weasley family dead silent. However, the highlight was that Ronald, the moronic one of the family, was gaping like he his greatest dreams had just come true. This gave him satisfaction of the largest amounts because the idiot would never actually get to experience the thing that James was holding.
The last thing he saw was a man bow, his blue eyes with traces of red, a sign of obvious sleep deprivation, ducking out of the room like a scolded schoolboy.
“I can already tell that this is going to be a rather gruelling experience,” muttered Harry as he weaved around a third-year Slytherin, who sent him a curious look. “Let’s just hope we can do it without any arguments occurring.”
“Gringotts would be the best place to start,” said Lily, gently nudging Harry so he’d begin walking down the slightly busy street of Diagon Alley. “We need to set you up a small trust vault, seeing as you’re now eleven and you’ll be wanting to buy things while at school, it’s easier to just do it now instead of later on in your years, only gets more complicated the older you are.”
Draco stares at the saddle and Shenan’s back for a moment as if contemplating how to get up. He pulls a face, changing to looking around the hall. Eventually he spots some kind of heavy wooden cross in the corner. Grabbing the horse’s reins again, he walks over there and carefully positions the mare until the left stirrup is dangling over the cross. Taking a deep breath he tests the stability of the cross before stepping up onto it. His feet aren’t much lower than the stirrups now, so he puts the left one into it. His hands grip the front of the saddle and Shenan’s mane tightly enough for his knuckles to turn white. I worry and want to start towards him, but Andrea puts her hand on my arm.
A frown crosses Draco’s face, “That was throughoutly checked when I was taken into custody. There is no need to prove it again.”
Draco is laying still, as apathetic in sleep as he was the first few days he was here. If the set-back was that bad, I’m honestly not entirely sure whether Hermione was not right in her suggestion, no matter how much it pains me. Body and mind drained I fall down on the bed next to the blonde. I stare at him, his fine cut face slowly becoming beautiful once more since he is starting to fill out again and is getting a skin colour close to healthy back. I sigh and stroke his hair and cheek, chocolate left on the bedside table.
“I don’t care,” Draco surprises us with his words, “Justice has already been served in their eyes when they sent me to prison.”
“Unfortunately,” she nods, “The wizarding world is still as prejudiced as before the war. It’s like they learned nothing at all.”
“I know,” I shake my head, “That’s why I never came to you before. But now we have proof that he was actually on our side. Spies in Voldemort’s army where pardoned for their crimes, were they not?”
Her frown deepening, Hermione tries to argue but he cuts her off, turning to me and the paper in my hands, “You wanted to ask questions?”
His movement is slow but his right arm lifts and carefully his hand lands on the toy. He runs it up and down the dragon’s back, fingers trailing along the ridges on it. His wide eyes come up to meet mine and there is a clear question in it but I can’t really understand what exactly he wants to ask.
“That you are,” I bury my face in his long hair to hide my own tears, “You are so much stronger than I ever was.”
So the next morning finds me sitting anxiously on Draco’s bedside. My wards didn’t give any alert during the night so he should still be calm. Hermione is here as well. But she is still sleeping.
“I know,” I sigh, “But he’s a fighter and he is already showing signs of recuperation. I am sure he can heal if we help him.”
To all our amusement he gives her a look as close to his condescending old one as possible. I hear Hermione giggle behind me while I watch him fondly.
“Well, that was a very effective evening. I know I brought the idea up but I wasn’t expecting it to work that well,” she shakes her head. At a strange look from me she continues, “Don’t get me wrong I am glad about it. It was nice seeing him like that.”
Stubborn idiot. But he won’t be deterred and now is as good as any time to take the next step, especially if he is the one initiating it. We can still end the attempt within a moment if it turns out to be too much for him. I have chosen a quiet muggle café around the corner for our first outing. It’s just a small bistro, with only local customers. By foot it takes less than two minutes to get there and there are booths in the back, that shield you from the people out on the street. The fact that it’s muggle also means that we have to worry less about anyone recognizing either me or Draco and causing a scene, even if we don’t use glamours.
He sighs and sets the brush down once he is finished with it. Spotting the other tool, he bends down and picks it up. Only then does he seem to realise that his left arm is in a sling. He stares at it in confusion for a moment then sighs defeatedly.
“Okay, for now it’s the stuffed dragon then,” I smile at him as he finishes his biscuit and tentatively twitches with his hand towards the food tray for another. He doesn’t have the strength yet to get it himself so I grab behind me and hand it to him.
“You didn’t see him that evening. He could not kill Dumbledore. He could never kill anyone in cold blood. He may have done some awful things while under Voldemort’s reign but I believe that he would never do it on his own free will. Taunting, teasing, playing pranks and insulting or throwing punches, yes. But nothing that would warrant any worse punishment than social service. Like I said, I am aware he might have committed smaller crimes, but nothing that is enough for what he is suffering now. And the worse stuff he did was forced anyway, I saw that,” I rant.
“A book?” I ask and at a blink I start lifting one book after another until he gives me the same pronounced blink.
Sorry for being a day late. But I was busy with university and driving yesterday. My internet cut out right before I could post.
“Draco,” I hear Hermione breathe beside me and with a shock I remember that this is the first time she really sees him in a properly clear state.
“Are you sure about this, Draco? You don’t look too good,” I try to reach out to him, but he bats me away.
And the blonde manages the movement for the whole round, even gives an annoyed ‘Hey’ when she slows the palomino down after that.
“Sounds good,” then I frown, “But the Manor burned and with it everything from Draco’s childhood didn’t it?”
Since I never owned a horse myself, only took riding lessons, I used to ride with a saddle too most of the time. Only twice during a very hot summer we were allowed to ride on the horse's bare back and in my opinion it was a lot of fun though more difficult.
“You don’t know how it feels like,” he shakes his head into the shoulder of my coat, “When the doorstep seems like an unpassable hurdle and so much as going outside is as scary as facing Voldemort. When you’re afraid of every person who passes you, because you automatically think they could hurt you, even children who don’t even reach your knee yet.”
“This is a muggle stable, is it not?” he glares at me past her mane, “I might get away with it if nobody sees me but I would rather not risk it. There is a reason you have bound my magic after all.”
I nod and hand the cat back to her. Dragon gives a displeased huff but keeps still nonetheless. I fill the empty spaces on the stack of papers the shop keeper handed me. It takes me a few minutes and afterwards more words are exchanged and I pay for him.
She freezes for a moment, then only shakes her head more, “Tilly is sorry. But Tilly is really not allowed to say.”
“Hermione!” I shout in between her flood of words, “Take a break. What happened? Maybe then we can find a solution.”
But all my tries are useless. He doesn’t react to anything. If I try to touch him, he only gets worse. During all of it he doesn’t give one sound. In the end I have run out of options, so I take my wand out of my pocket with shaking hands. I am crying too now.
Draco apparently considers fifteen minutes appropriate warming up time. When they have passed though he starts urging Shenan on. Since his movements have gotten a good deal more precise since that first time, she recognises the signals immediately and happily falls into a slow trot. Andrea snorts but with a sigh starts jogging next to the horse. A look back to the boy shows that he is doing something I haven’t seen him do very often. He is moving up and down in time with Shenan’s steps. Up until now he preferred to sit back or just did this for a few moments before he lost strength.
So after another one of those awakenings, I am blinking blearily at one of my textbooks because I can’t go to sleep anyway and there are a few chapters on trauma patients in this one. However the letters are blurring in front of my eyes and I have no idea what I just read. My head falls forward onto the book, eyes closing.
I want to know where you are. I am not exactly sure why, but I need to know. I have been keeping an eye on you since the beginning of the year, mostly to find out what you were planning. But now? You are a risk for no one since you are gone. But I can’t stop my mind from straying to this subject. I wonder why you suddenly disappeared without a trace or warning. Are you dead? No, a corpse would have been found. Besides your parents declared you missing. Not even they know where you are, apparently. If you would have been killed or assigned to a mission by Voldemort, they would have known. So you really disappeared without a trace.
“Great. I love my job and my kids,” I grin at you, trying to pretend happiness, even though your coldness is gripping my heart. I probably look like an idiot right now, I was never as good as you at pretending, “You have a child too, don’t you? He’s in Hogwarts already. Orion was it, right?” I inquire about your son who I came to know over the last year.
He murmurs an incantation over Draco’s dead body and his whole body jolts. Then the inevitable ‘Crucio’ and such a heart-breaking scream fills the woods, that I have the feeling my ears are about to bleed. Voldemort only grins as the other boy’s body contorts violently.
“He suddenly woke up in an unfamiliar place if he didn’t have any memories of the past years,” she shrugs, “It was to be expected.”
He sighs, “Depends. Most people never forget a trauma if it was bad enough. On the other hand, your generation is strong. I doubt he will ever be like he was before the war, but he should recover, yes,” he tries to give me a reassuring smile, “I could give you the contacts of a friend of mine who specialises in psychology. I know he won’t care about the identity of his patient. Your friend wouldn’t be the first suspected death eater who he treated.”
He is sitting in his usual chair, still slumped but his posture portrays a bit more strength than when he came here. Like I said, small victories. He also looks cleaned up now. The nearly white hair is pulled into a neat ponytail at the back of his neck. A green band secures it in place. His face is comparatively relaxed. Nothing can change his pale skin except getting outside, something we can’t do at the moment. He is still thin and looks somehow hollowed out but again he is a good deal better than before. Dragon is curled up on his lap, purring contentedly. The stuffed toy is on a table not far, but the blonde’s focus is on the cat, whose tail is twitching lazily. Draco’s fingers are running through the white animal’s fur, face soft. He is even making a small humming noise in the back of his throat. It’s not speaking yet, but it’s something new either way.
To my happiness the next day I experience what a ‘good day’ means for Draco. When I walk into his room the morning he has apparently moved. I laid him down on his back after dinner last night, but he is turned on the side now, staring at the door again. I frown first, but when I step closer my eyes widen. There is certainly a spark more clarity in his gaze than the day before. I would like to take it as an improvement from being out of prison, but Michael already mentioned that Draco’s condition can change in between days without any warning.
Anyway, this is the last chapter of part 1. I can't say when I will start the next part, but I will try to make it soon.
After having put fresh clothes on him, I lift him up again and walk him back to the living room. I had to alter the clothes a bit because he is still taller than me, but since he is nearly a skeleton, I also had to make them tighter. Since it is already past noon, the next thing we have to do is eat again. But just as I am making my way along the hallway with Draco, I feel someone prodding at the wards around my fireplace. Carefully feeling it out, I smile when I recognize Hermione’s magical signature. With a wave of my hand I open the wards for her and when I enter the living room, she is waiting in front of the fireplace, a basket on her arm. I give her a smile before I focus on guiding Draco to the same armchair as this morning. He stares blankly and slumps into the chair like last time. I stroke his now clean, though slightly damp, hair, then straighten up and turn towards my friend.
He passed many compartments: Luna’s (which she was sharing with Neville and some first and second years, who were asking for autographs and demonstrations of magic); one where professor McGonagall was yelling at some third years; and last, but not least annoying, Malfoy’s.
“MrPotter!” Flitwick shouted, making him almost fall off his seat. The heat rose to his face, as he felt the embarrassment of having every classmate looking at him, hiding their laughs.
You see, George kept the WWW going even without his brother. Also, he has some new toys inspired on muggle products Hermione has taken to the Burrow to show MrWeasley during the summer.
Ron was left alone with his best friends— being one of them his girlfriend who, fit some reason, was too eager for the first slow dance he had promised her.
“Wow, this all looks great, they really did put a lot of effort into everything” commented, giving Luna a cup full of punch.
Harry didn’t know what had made Draco cry, he didn’t know why he even cared or why he felt guilty and sad or why his stomach felt like it was full of butterflies, but he didn’t want to see him cry even again.
As he slowly took his clothes out— trying to NOT look at the other boys around him who were preparing themselves for practice, why should it matter if that seeker from sixth year had clear olive skin, or that Theodor had defined abs and Zabini a firm ass— his teammates occupied every shower except one.
“Harry, mate—“ Dean, who was just besides Ginny, tried to calm him, as he noticed that everyone in their table and in the Hufflepuff one were looking at them.
Hermione was sitting in Ron’s lap, reading her potions textbook over his shoulder, with her arms around his neck and each one of her legs at his hip’s side.
He didn’t know the answers to those questions, all he knew was that he needed to learn a charm that would take that horrid smell out of his clothes, hair and entire body— since water did not work!
The hand roaming under his shirt slid down and stroked him over his pants, peeling his face away from Harry’s shoulders and facing him. Their noses were touching and Harry was sure that—just like his eyes were focused on the pair of pink, thin, kissable lips in front of him—Malfoy wasn’t looking at his eyes either.
When their faces started to get close enough so Harry could feel Malfoy’s breath dance across his face, their eyes started to close on their own accord.
Harry, on the other hand, had just arrived at his dorm with great difficulty in the whole breathing area which complicated the process of walking up lots and lots of stairs.
So, in the corridor, as soon as he saw a group of Hufflepuffs—and whispered jackpot under his breath—he approached them and cast a spell to make the bag of one of them fall and drop all the books so he could get close and help her catch them from the floor so he would be close enough for her to smell him “unintentionally.”
Fuck! Complications were not good, and this was definitely one, but he could manage. He could always ask Hermione to distract Harry, since she was the best liar in the entire wizard and muggle world, specially under pressure.
Harry looked away, blushing and wondered when his best friend had gotten less oblivious to the world around him.
Some Gryffindors looked at the Slytherin table and saw two Slytherins locking eyes with the red head in the lions’ table and a pale, blonde Slytherin with a preoccupied face, mixed with a fake smug look.
“Why does it smell like some disgusting muggle food in here?” She asked, not noticing the way Harry’s eyes widened after hearing her question.
He was in a corridor in the third floor, pretending to tie his shoe near a group of gossiping  fifth year girls asking Pansy what products she used on her hair.
Now, in front of him, was someone totally new to him, someone with no barrier between their emotions and the outside world, someone who was about to burst with emotions like an erupting volcano, he was fire and he was dangerous and that, to his Harry’s surprise, was exciting.
“Oh, uh, I—uh— I asked Professor Sprout if I could have a free night today.” His cheeks started to become red. “I asked Luna to meet me by the lake today, you know. I just came here to look for my favourite shirt and found your map under my bed.” Neville chuckled and bid Harry goodbye.
“Draco” he whispered this time, instead of shouting. In a flash, he was beside the blond, casting an ‘espisky’ to clean the scratches on his freezing hands, shaking his shoulders and trying to brush his wet hair away from his eyes so he could see them.
As Harry remembered his early thoughts about what it’d be like licking the milk out of Malfoy’s pale skin while he stepped out of the shower, he realized how crazy his life was.
As he was about to get up, ne noticed he was clean. Draco had cleaned him. He reached with his hand to check himself down there and it was also clean.
He started to wash himself and, when he was ready to turn the water off, the same unmistakable, throaty moans he’d heard last time started.
It was awkward, the silence. Every time they heard a sound they would walk faster and bump into each other and he didn’t know if it was on porpoise or not, but their hands would meet and one of them would try to hold the other’s hand and then give up and create even more tension between the two. If he had a knife right now, he would either cut the tension between them or kill himself because of it.
He tried really hard to, but even when thinking about what the both of them were doing and imagining them going any further was still too far away from reality, nothing really compared or was half as good as the feeling of the blond’s hot breath brushing against his erection and there was nothing he could do but to wait for the whispered promise of more to be fulfilled.
She trailed off, looking at the other side of the Great Hall. Ron, who was beside her noticed this and looked at the same time as Harry and Hermione did, who were in front of the ginger siblings.
He was so tired; he had a huge headache! All he wanted to do was to rip his hair out and grab his eyes and eat them! He was so hungry too!
“you shouldn’t throw trash in the lake” he said, trying to lighten the mood “its bad for the environment.”
Harry blushed and placed his hand behind the other boy’s wet and messy hair, pulling him in for a sloppy kiss.
Slughorn seemed tired of his student’s laughter and glared at some giggling Slytherins over his shoulder.
He closed his legs and pressed them together, trying to regain the friction and pleasure he’d felt before, with that hand caressing him.
She looked at the Slytherin table and noticed Malfoy’s eyes glued on the door from which Harry had left.
His lips interrupted her speech—understanding it was a waste of oxygen to let her keep speaking when they could use it for things much more pleasurable—while his thumb cleaned the tears on her cheeks.
“If you can handle it, I’ll meet you in your dorms” right beside an enchanted drawing of a smiling face winking up at him.
“Rumours?” He questioned, locking eyes with her and trying to leave any emotion he might feel out of them.
Ron had been too quiet since then— and Ron was only quiet when he ate, so Harry supposed his best friends’ relationship was serious, since the ginger considered the brunette as worthy as food.
And maybe he had never even thought about doing it with a girl, so what's the big deal? Just because he didn't even think of it in fourth year when Fleur was in school, even though every other straight boy was?
“By the way, Potter, good try covering up you old stinky smell with green apple perfume, but you cant fool me.” Malfoy said, unclenching his fists and dropping his chin on top of Harry’s head.
He explained how the ideas for this line of products from Muggle products and, somehow, reached a subject that had nothing to do with the gift itself.
Ron was sure Harry only needed someone to be with, since he was always complaining when his best friends showed too much PDA for his liking.
Oh, well, he'll have to handle the fact that when—no, if— everything goes wrong  Pansy will kill him in the most horrible way possible and not even Zabini—her beloved boyfriend —with the help of every Slytherin at Hogwarts right now could stop her.
Ron, on the other hand, was so focused on his plan that he hadn’t even made a mean comment in any class today and hadn’t eaten anything besides his entire chicken at lunch and two meat pies for dinner.
“to give you an alternative”, he sighed and handed it to him, ignoring his confused expression as he held a box in front of him.
He looked at the products exposed on this new jewelry, most of each were too simple for wizards yet had a magical air that he couldn’t quite see muggles wearing them either.
“Thanks, Neville.” Harry said, taking the map from his friend. “What are you doing here? You usually just come back after dinner.” He was truly curious, actually. And he felt bad for not being too present in his friend’s life. Now that Hermione and Ron had each other, he was too focused on himself to notice the fact that there were other people around him who, as he should have realized earlier, were his friends.
“Just lay down, mate” Ron said. Harry did so and spent the next half an hour listening to his friends explain what happened after he caught the Snitch with his hand and the Bludger with his face.
After some hours of a sleep surprisingly full of dreams, Draco woke up painfully hard; it was obvious to him that all the experiences from the night before were planted on him brain.
“Do you— I mean, ipotetically speaking, would you think I’m crazy to think Harry ... to think he isn’t obsessed with Malfoy because he thinks he’s bad? I just— what if he just wants to have the last years back— he want to fight with the ferret again and—“
As he walked past a group of Ravenclaws chatting with Gryffindors, probably third years or something, he ran his hands through his hair to make the smell fly around the corridor and tried his best to contain his laugh as he heard their comments.
“Hey Potter,” yelled a Slytherin, who Ron recognized as Theodor Dott, or Mott, or something. “I already know why your girlfriend left you! I mean, I’d too if I was dating a prude!”
There was nothing he wanted to do more right now than continue this session and forget about what his friends would say to him if they found out, how they’d look down at him, but he had never been good at hiding anything from anyone, specially his best friend.
At least now he could take a relaxing, long, hot shower with the shampoo he had borrowed from Hermione, which smelled like apples— she didn’t use it because she said she had purchased the wrong one, since she preferred the smell of oranges and cinnamon— so, after Harry’s shampoo finished, Hermione gave him hers.
“Your sh— oh, my Merlin, Ronald! You WANTED Harry to get pissed! That’s — uh—Now, if you don’t want ME to get pissed, you’ll get your ass out of here and you’re gonna comfort him!”
“We prefer to use the plants here in herbology to make antidotes instead of perfume, but—if you want—I think Parvati was using plants in her muggle studies trying to find what certain perfumes smell like. Maybe she will help you. I’m not really sure it was Parvati and not Padma, but one of them surely has what you’re looking for.”
He responded by turning back to his nonexistent notes and tried to focus on what Hermione was saying.
Yup, Harry needed advice and consolation. And who better for that than Hermione, his best friend and sister? Unfortunately, when he got to the dorm, she yelled at him and told him she was studying.
He sat there, in a chair they pulled for him, shaking and leaning back and forth, looking at the big clock on the wall above his head, sipping the once again full cup of tea and biting his nails.
He felt Malfoy push forward and he could actually feel Draco’s belly muscles clench, stopping himself from moving.
“my wand is in my other pocket, you can check” he affirmed, hoping it was dark enough to hide his still semi hard cock. The blond took it out of his pocket and lowered his own wand from Harry’s neck, pointing it now at his chest but at a bigger distance now.
During the day, Harry tried to be as close to the Slytherins as possible, just to get a reaction from them. But, by the end of the day after many idiotic attempts to get their attention by touching his hair in a way that would make the smell fly around them or fail at obvious spells during classes so they’d look at him to mock him, he regretted the smell he chose.
It must be nothing, Harry thought, but as he sat for lunch with Hermione —who was talking with Ginny about dresses for the ball while Luna was at the Ravenclaw table —he had a really hard time swallowing his food and drinking and breathing started to become a difficult task as well.
He looked around and noticed that his teammates and the Ravenclaws has stopped midair as well, looking at the cam uncertainly.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! He would not let himself go down like this. He, Harry James Potter, was Gryffindor, for crying out loud. So, he was going to be a real Gryffindor and show his red and gold colours as he yelled in the ferret’s face for making him feel this way.
“I was just wondering if ‘Mione still had Harry’s cloak from the last time she went to the library after curfew.” He said, making those puppie dog eyes, cute smile and ‘attractive’ voice Hermione couldn’t resist.
He could smell the mint and honey coming from the other boy’s breath, the salty water in his skin; he could feel the bed sheets shift as the blond leaned closer and hot breath tickling his neck and jawline; he could hear a fast breath and a racing heart- both his, obviously.
But just as I am about to take his left arm to put it in the sling, it twitches. Twitches away. But the rest of his body didn’t really move, so it could only have been caused by a muscle directly in his arm. I smile softly. ‘Small progress once again,’ I think while I rub said arm in encouragement. That earns me a wide-eyed look from the blonde, but he doesn’t make any move away either.
Clearing my throat, I look at him, “How about we get you cleaned up now? You desperately need it,” I say, standing up and taking his hands again.
“That’s interesting,” he says as he tips the silver into a nearby pensive, “And you are sure this memory is not altered?”
And I don’t get one either, he just blinks another time. So I start pointing at things and wait for that blink to come again. Finally I settle on a handful of biscuits with chocolate which I originally bought for myself yesterday and only put them on the tray on a whim. But he blinks when I pick one up and so I hold it out to him. Luckily they are relatively soft in texture so they can’t hurt his teeth. His hand which has retreated to the stuffed animal again, comes slowly forward to take the first biscuit. I turn to smile at Hermione.
“That’s good,” he smiles a sad smile, “I wish you the best luck with him. I hope you can bring him back. He did not deserve this and I don’t want him to suffer any further.”
“Are you sure?” she squats down next to me, “You look like a mess. Didn’t you say, you found Draco? Is something wrong with him?”
“As far as I understood it, they passed a paper around and each of the judges was allowed to write their questions on it. It wasn’t checked afterwards, just handed out to me.”
That’s why I am currently standing in a muggle pet shop. We decided early on that we wanted a completely normal, nonmagical cat, so there is less of a chance it might scare Draco. But there are just so many! I never knew how many races of cats there are. Not to mention that this shop has every age, from kittens, still falling over each other, to older cats, who do nothing but bathe in the sunlight the whole day.
With an indistinctive grumble, green eyes fall closed and it doesn’t take more than a few seconds for the raven’s breathing to even out into deep sleep. Hermione shakes her head, takes off the other’s glasses and tucks him in bed with a swish of her wand. Once she is sure her friend is sleeping comfortably, her next way leads her to the second occupied bedroom in the house. Opening the door as careful as she can, her eyes land on the thin figure on the bed. Stepping inside she slowly approaches the blonde. His face is clinched even in sleep. With a sigh she waves her wand over him and his face relaxes.
I sigh, running a hand through my already messy hair, “So what? I certainly won’t force him to reciprocate anything.”
I sigh, “Let’s just say, he’s better. He’s still far from good, but we’re getting there. Horse therapy is helping him a lot.”
“You are welcome,” he waves towards the door, “And now go. You can barely stand still anyway. Go and free your boyfriend.”
But my thoughts are elsewhere because the blond boy has just been called up and is putting the Sorting Hat on. It takes some moments in which the hat is talking but no one but Orion can hear him. Finally it calls out.
“Yeah, you know I have lost so many people…” I grip her wrist tightly which she allows even though it probably it hurts her, “If something happened to him…”
So when the lessons end for the day and everybody hurries out of the hall to get home, I on the other hand walk down to our professor. He looks up when I stop next to his desk.
Hermione opens her mouth and closes it again, “I guess he has way less self-esteem than we thought. All just a mask,” she shakes her head, “Another issue you will have to work through once he is clear enough.”
“I so can’t reconcile that picture with the annoying bastard I remember from our school days,” Hermione shakes her head, “The broken shell from before maybe. But this… He looks like a frightened little child.”
“Not anyone can be a healer. Everyone has a different affinity for this kind of magic. And unfortunately this seems to be one of the few things I am not good at,” she pouts, looking slightly pissed, “You on the other hand have a high affinity for healing magic. I mean, you’re studying it. So it should be easier on both the caster and Draco if you would do it instead.”
Draco sighs and shakes his head, but he looks resolved to accept whatever is in store him. I even can’t help but admire him for it. Where did that whinny boy go who spent weeks complaining about a fall from his broom. Something must have changed him quite a bit.
When I return home it is to find Hermione feeding Draco some sort of soup in the living room. His eyes are as absent as usual and he only reacts slowly to the girl’s commands to open up and eat. But it’s better than nothing after all. When she hears the floo flare she looks up over the blonde’s head. She gives me a sad smile then lays the spoon down.
“Mr Potter,” I hear Professor Javis, our teacher for psychological illnesses, call out, “Are you okay?”
“What? No, I’m fine. Nothing happened to me,” she rants and waves her hands about furiously, causing me to take a cautious step away from her, “Just angry. The whole world is full of idiots!”
“I see you two have reacquainted yourself,” Andrea has come up to us, “Hello Harry, Hermione and Draco.”
“Oh, you wouldn’t want the only person who actually spares you any attention apart from your two mindless puppets to leave, would you, Potty?”
At that the brunette throws me a look which seems unnervingly knowing and nods, “I will help you. Maybe I can find some kind of loophole in the laws.”
The afternoon of the next day I meet up with Hermione for tea and biscuits. It’s a sunny day so we are sitting outside, watching Draco play with the cat in the backyard. He is waving one of the animal’s toys above it’s head, always moving it out of reach when white paws make a grab for it. A careful smile is on the blonde’s face and he is making humming noises in the back of his throat.
“Nothing special. I went outside and at first it was fine,” he recounts slowly, face pulled into a grimace, “Then I… I came across a couple with their dog. I thought it would be fine, simply turned away but the dog wasn’t controlled and jumped at me,” he takes a shuddering breath, “I startled and fell. The thing was still licking and bothering me, but at least the couple noticed. They tried to pull him away. I was still mostly in control, even if it was difficult, until the man suddenly reached down and grabbed my left arm. I-I,” he swallows, “I don’t remember much after that. Just running, running and fear. Every time I thought I could calm down I came across another dog or person and it started anew.”
“That’s not what I – “ I start up again but then take a deep breath. Arguing like we’re back in school isn’t going to get us anywhere. I know he is only deflecting the helplessness and hurt he is feeling right now into anger. He is riling me up again to divert me from his show of vulnerability. That tactic worked perfectly back in school but I refuse to let him do it again. I pinch the bridge of my nose, “That’s not the point here, Malfoy, and you know it. Don’t try to turn it on me.”
“Harry Potter. I am from the Ministry of Magic. Come to the door now. I have questions you need to answer,” a voice booms through the house. Damned magic sometimes!
He doesn’t so much as blink. I sigh and put my hand on his shoulder, “Can you hear me, Draco? I am Harry. Harry Potter, do you remember? We used to be rivals in school.”
“I know,” I nod, crossing my arms, “But he reacts badly to strangers which puts human therapists out of the question. On the other hand he seems to connect well with animals. I bought a cat and it took less than a day for him to accept the animal while he still stiffens when someone other than me comes near him. We also found out that he owned horses when he was younger and he loved riding, so that might add to it,” I sigh, rubbing my arms, “Even if we have to find something else for his mental troubles he is still having balance problems and his muscles don’t work properly sometimes.”
“You did lose your head,” he glares, pushing himself away. His arms are still wrapped around himself. No matter how much he tries to pretend his old haughtiness, I can see the fear in his eyes. His memories might be fuzzy but he knows what he went through.
“Alright, I concede on the second point, but I am still not letting you off the lunge,” she glares right back, even though her amusement is clear, “Shenan is a good horse but you aren’t stable enough yet.”
“I won’t. I won’t. I promise I won’t let anyone hurt you ever again if I have the possibility of stopping it. I promise,” I repeat into his hair and keep on mumbling it as I slowly feel him start to relax in my arms.
“Okay, uhm,” I think for a moment, “I need a cat who is not easily startled. Not by sounds, strange smells or other beings. They also need to be very accepting of humans. If it is possible that they won’t try to scratch or bite even if someone doesn’t really know how to handle them,” I tilt my head, “And one that’s friendly, that they come to the human on their own but also won’t need too much attention.”
“I can and I will. It seems the Ministry learned nothing from the last war. This kind of attitude is exactly what allowed Voldemort to rise as easily as he did,” I cross my arms, glaring deeply, “I will only say this one last time. Draco is in no condition to make a statement, not to mention standing trial. He is neither capable of talking nor walking by himself. He needs constant care and I will under no circumstances subject him to the Ministry. If you actually want something useful, try sending someone compassionate or at least understanding. That Sergio Danito who was here last time for example,” I am about to turn away, then glare a last time, “And if anyone asks for Draco to answer anything again before a medic of my choosing clears him, I am going to sue the Ministry for more than they already owe him. Tell that to Kingsley for me.”
But somehow it sounded appropriate when I wrote it and if I changed it now it would only lead to chaos.
As it turns out though, the reawakening of Draco’s magic is more problem than expected. Yes, it’s a step forward, but it also means that I have an emotionally unstable person with uncontrollable magic in the house. I feel like half the time I have to duck from something or the other exploding. Whenever something doesn’t go his way, things start to blow up. When he’s happy, one thing or the other in his vicinity starts to float. Most of these times said things come crashing down when his elatedness fades which ends in more broken stuff. I guess this is similar to a child’s magic outbursts except that Draco’s magic is fully formed and a good deal stronger than any child’s before Hogwarts. He regularly causes Dragon to hide under whatever furniture is closest which then ends with Draco more unhappy and because of that more broken things and scared cats. It’s an endless circle.
Kingsley nods gravely then motions us to wait while he dives into the pensive. I can barely keep still. Until finally the man emerges from the basin again, a frown marring his face.
“Draco? Better I would like to say,” I sigh, following her in sitting on one of the sofas, “We had a setback three days ago though.”
“Potter?” he glares, his anger a default reaction to cover the panic after coming to at an unfamiliar place with no memories of the recent months, “Where am I? What are you doing here? Where is my wand?”
“No problem. It’s actually going better than we expected too,” I agree, letting the other boy go back to petting the horse, “Like I said, he gets along pretty well with animals. The horses calm him down a lot. As soon as we step out of here, he will jump at every new sound again.”
My hands are clenched and my face stormy and pained. I never thought such a fate could ever befall the proud Draco Malfoy. My heart beats harshly against my chest and the strength of the panic which seizes me forces the realisation on me that my feelings for the blonde go much further than sympathy and the wish to save him from an undeserved fate.
Hermione is waiting for me in the kitchen with a mug of coffee. Thanks to magic I look halfway presentable again, but I doubt I can fool her.
Still I am encouraged and happy every time I see his progress. Another one of those moments happens this Sunday. We were riding yesterday and he fell asleep smiling, the dragon only sitting next to his head instead of pressed against his chest. Since I have an exam in a week, I have been studying in every free moment I have. So I sat down as soon as the blond was asleep, opening books and making notes until I fell asleep with one of the heavy tomes on my chest, sprawled across the couch.
The next cat she shows me is a sleek black animal. She’s beautiful but her fluid movements give me a slight impression of snakes. And if even I think of that, I don’t want to risk Draco to be reminded of Nagini in the slightest. Better not bring in a potential trigger. She shows me several other cats after that but none really seem the right ones to me.
“Like I said, it’s psychosomatic I think. He’s been having clear moments in the last weeks. During those times he’s mentally there enough to move his arm. Though never to this extent up until now,” I answer, watching the other boy with fascination.
“Fifth year at Hogwarts,” he answers what I have already read in the reports, “My father was trying to include me into deatheater business more and more. I started seeing that it was wrong, so I went to Dumbledore.”
“Well, since I haven’t been over as much as I should, how about you and Teddy come to Grimmauld Place? Don’t worry, it’s been cleaned and child-proofed.”
She seems to think for some time then starts humming softly, “Hm, maybe. But I don’t doubt that you will find out who it is one day. I know you. When you are set on something you achieve it too.”
It earns me another shake of his head, soft blond hair tickling my cheek. I sit there silently, letting him rest against me. After some more minutes I realise that his breathing has evened out. Shifting him cautiously, I turn his head towards me. His eyes are actually closed. He has fallen asleep. I sigh, but remember that a longer clear phase is usually followed by him needing to sleep. So instead I shift him again until I can lift him into my arms. His bare skin is ice-cold from standing half naked for so long. Being careful, I lower him into the bed and put a soft shirt on him after healing the small wounds he made with his nails and clean the blood from his skin. Then I cast a warming charm on his blanket to chase the cold from his skin. I pull the cover over him, smiling down at the peaceful face, and run a hand over his hair. He looks so much younger when he is asleep. After a last check around the room, I turn around and walk out the door, closing it only partway.
A few minutes after settling down, I feel his body shift. To my surprise I notice that while he has now turned his back to me, he has come close enough to siphon off of my body heat. His own body seems to give off only very little warmth, so I carefully throw an arm around him, in hope to keep him warm. Once again he surprises me when instead of getting nervous, he just slips his ice cold hand into mine. I smile into the cold skin of his neck, more than happy with the current situation.
“I want to find who helped us too,” she finally agrees, “But I don’t know who it was. We always only saw the house elf. I asked her once but she said, the master told her not to tell anyone.”
Following the sound, I hurry out of the kitchen, teapot forgotten on the stove. A short race later lands me in the living room, looking at a not exactly comforting picture. Draco is curled in his chair, legs pulled close to his chest. A fine trembling is running over his form and his eyes are squeezed shut. Dragon is huddled under the table in front of him. The cat looks severely startled but he is already creeping out and back to the blonde again. With curiosity I watch the animal’s actions as he carefully pads towards Draco, who doesn’t seem to be registering anything going on around him. I want to help him right now, but decide to watch whether Dragon can bring him out of it on his own. The cat has reached the chair by now and gets on his hindpaws to reach the soles of the boy’s feet. He manages to nuzzle his nose against the skin. But all it earns him it another frightened squeak and Draco curling in even further (if that’s possible). The cat instinctively does a jump backwards and stares at the human with confused eyes. I sigh and walk into the room. Bending down I scoop up the small animal and deposit him on the couch.
Hurriedly I flip to the aforementioned page. What I see there causes my eyes to widen. The entry of the 8th November speaks of Lupin doing more than just kissing. And not with a girl. No, with my godfather Sirius. I cough when the part gets a bit too explicit, hearing a giggle from the woman again. Sweeping my eyes over the next entries up until their last year, I find out that it was more than just a bit of fooling around. They were in an actual relationship for some years. Why did no one ever tell me that? I groan and burry my face in my hands up until something catches my eyes.
“We have taken on patients from Andrea before. If she says it’s better for them to take normal riding lessons, then that’s what we are going to do,” he smiles, “What special conditions does he need?”
“No, and I will never pretend to understand that,” I try to soothe him, happy to let him lean on me, “But I know what it means to be afraid to leave the house or tent, because someone might jump from behind the next bush. When the whole world decides to depend on you, a teenager, alone and where one wrong move can mean death.”
It takes long until I wake again. But eventually my full bladder overrides my tiredness and groggy green eyes blink slowly open. Yawning widely, I heave myself from bed and pad towards the bathroom. After relieving myself and cleaning up, I walk back in the direction of the living room. Expecting Hermione to still be there, I am surprised when all I encounter is a floating message.
“How do you know so much about his childhood?” I breathe shakily, moving back again, to look at her.
He is gaping at me, completely frozen. I take that as a yes and slam the door in his face. Just to convey my anger further, I forcefully erect new wards which throw the ministry employee right on his ass in the middle of the sidewalk. I huff as soon as that is done. But then Draco’s picture reappears in my mind and all anger leaves my body and I slump against the door. Burrowing my face in my hands I groan. All I can do it hope is that the set-back from today’s incident won’t be too bad. Tiredly I send off a message to Hermione before I manage to sort my limbs out and walk upstairs to Draco’s room again. On the way there I summon myself a hot chocolate. I need the comfort.
“Yeah,” she nods thoughtfully, “Anyway,” she motions to the book, “I may have some ideas on how to start with Draco.”
“Not really no,” I groan as I fall face first onto my bed, “But it would be nice for him to sleep through one night.”
Hermione laughed when I told her about it, not that I can really see the funny side of this. Still Draco is getting better and that’s a good thing. His next appointment for riding therapy is scheduled for next week, so I have to endure his constant pointing at horse pictures and exploding vases every time I tell him that he will have to wait.
I see you automatically freeze. My heart skips a beat too. Do you still hate me that much? The brunette next to you lays a hand on your arm and I can just keep myself from glaring at it or her directly. She is levelling a calculating stare at me behind a mask of polite smiles. Am I really being jealous of the woman who is allowed to stay by your side while I am nothing but your former enemy? Alright, I admit that I am. But I guess you will never know that in this moment I want to be your friend. That I even want to be in her place. That you look and laugh at me like you do at her. That I am the one at your side.
“Well, I guess the best way to explain this, is that Draco tends to shut himself in his head. When he does that he remembers nothing of his life or personality. He barely reacts to outside stimuli and behaves like a toddler. But in recent times he has come out of this more and more. When his mind is there, he acts his twenty years and is fully capable of riding on his own, he actually scoffs at you if you try to help him. Unfortunately he is easily startled back into his mind if someone he doesn’t implicitly trust tries to interact with him,” I explain.
As much as I want to take him to Narcissa, that would mean bringing him to St. Mungos. Since we can’t just simply apparate to her room, we would have to walk right through the hospital. It’s crowded, chaotic and often loud at the best of times. He is nowhere near ready to go there. If I take him I either risk him panicking and having a relapse or even that the healers will try to force him to stay if he gets scared in the middle of the hospital. He could use the professional help, yes, but I am afraid of what they might do to him when they realise who he is. So I shake my head.
She squirms a bit but relents in the end, “I did a few scans on him and his mental state while you were preparing the tea. Right now he is still at toddler stage, somewhere between mostly instinctual behaviour and more elaborate ones, but his mind is slowly starting to wake up more and more.”
“I don’t, don’t worry,” I smile, he is as difficult to get talking as you were, “I just want to know what he is doing these days.”
Her ears flop dejectedly and her eyes fall to the ground, but then she nods to my greatest relief, “Yes, it was the young master who ordered Tilly to take care of the prisoners.”
“Correct,” he nods, “Since it is being investigated anew and thanks to the insistence of Mrs Granger, we are following every trail of information.”
“Yes, you already said that,” my brow furrows in anger, “But why would you want a statement from him? The Ministry didn’t give a damn about what he had to say last time. Not to mention that we’ve already been over that once before, he can’t really answer questions right now.”
The moment the loud voice said ‘ministry’, he started to scream. He throws his panicked weight in the opposite direction of me, nearly upsetting every balance either of us had. It’s the first time I have heard him make more than grunts, squeals or hums but that just makes it worse. His voice is higher pitched than I remember. His body is shaking once more and he is fighting my grip. In a different situation I would be happy about how much activity he is showing but right now all I want is for him to stop.
“What’s wrong?” I ask, but when I try to reach for him, he steps back and burrows his nose deeper into a slightly exasperated looking cat.
I frown. It’s not really a diary though. It looks more like some of the reports (especially the ones from spies) I saw earlier. And my thought proves itself right.
I squirm in my seat, “Unfortunately not. His guardians are not in the picture,” I clear my throat, “His father is dead and his mother is in the mental ward. She is not properly aware of the world around her.”
“Not the last time I saw him,” she takes my bag instead and leads me up the stairs, “He’s in the living room. Well, if he didn’t wander out, since he can do that now, he doesn’t exactly like to do what you tell him to, not to mention stay where you put him.”
I perk up immediately, “That’s great. I talked to my professor and he had some suggestions as well. He also gave me the contacts to a psychologist who could treat him. But I only want to use that as a last resort. As much as I trust my professor’s opinion on his friend I don’t really want to force Draco to talk with some stranger he has never seen before. At least not until he isn’t somehow better. So what are your ideas?”
He takes a deep breath, “While I agree with you that I am guilty of minor war crimes I must disagree on the first accounts. I have never killed any person, neither have I tortured as many as you try to pin on me. Not that I did it voluntarily to begin with. Also your accusation of… rape is completely wrong. I would never lower myself to that,” his eyes are strong as he gives his answer.
“There is no solution,” she growls angrily, “Don’t flip out now, Harry, okay. I am as angry as you.”
But I think sometimes animals make for better therapists than other humans (my personal opinion as someone who has a tendency to shy away from other people, much less any kind of doctor).
“No, no,” I hurriedly move to correct her, “That’s not it. I have just never thought about it. I mean I can appreciate it when a guy looks attractive and I have never found that weird. But actually being with another man…”
“You want to tell me it’s all based on coincidences?” once again he looks at me like I lost my mind.
“Well, they are trying to dig up new evidence. Kingsley is pushing for progress but whoever is on the job isn’t as open as him and is barely doing anything,” she snorts, “Also, they want to wait until Draco can give a statement.”
“NO!” I say with as much force as I can muster, grabbing her hands, “I believe in him. If we give him the chance and help him, he will come back. I am sure. But we have to believe that he can do it,” my eyes fill with sadness, “This is not about me at all. He deserves a normal life too, Hermione. A life where he can be free and live like he wants to. Without his father, his name or Voldemort looming over him.”
There I lean against one of the counters. He seems indecisive for a moment then seats himself on one of the wooden chairs. At first he looks like he expects me to offer him something to drink out of decorum, especially with the half-filled coffee pot still sitting behind me. But after what the last ministry employee pulled, there is no chance. Eventually he clears his throat.
“I agree, I want to get out of here. And Malfoy really needs some fresh air,” Hermione nods as well, darting nervous looks around.
“Oh, look at that,” he taunts me, even though it’s a weak imitation of his old posture, “Saint Potter grew a bit of brain in addition to his oh so bleeding heart.”
That’s my last thought as my vision turns completely black and my whole body gives away. My awareness leaves me as I land next to your grave in the grass. I doubt they will bury me here though. Pity. But that’s for them to take care of. I am finally free of all my responsibilities. Of my masks and false truths. You know all about that, don’t you? How about in death we finally shed all those masks and just be truthful to each other? How does that sound to you? At least to me it sounds great. Even if Ginny is waiting for me there, I want to be with you.
He gives me a tired but happy smile which warms my chest. Immediately he shuffles over, pulling the sleepy cat with him. I move onto the bed, carefully gauging his reaction. But nothing more than a small increase in the tension in his body happens.
“Is too weak to argue against my father, much less Voldemort,” he says the name with derision, but without any fear unlike most people.
“He doesn’t see it that way. He dismissed his spying and instead focused on what he did wrong instead,” I say helplessly, “He…” I have to swallow, “He called himself broken and disgusting.”
Andromeda smiles indulgently behind us as I slide down to the floor together with Teddy. Immediately he picks some of his toys up and thrusts them at me. I grin and start following his instructions in how he wants this game to go. The older woman leaves at some point and half an hour later I can smell delicious aromas coming from the kitchen.
Due to that I turned to the magical world. However they don’t have something like the internet, so without any papers, tracking a single horse is difficult. It requires many owls and a lot of footwork. I have found out that most Malfoy horses were sold to other purebloods. A lot of them went to France or Germany, but Kari was not among them. She was sold by Narzissa, not Lucius like the others, to some small breeder for Thoroughbreds. I tried contacting the man, only to find out he died a few years ago. His son sold the horses again, but I haven’t been able to get in touch with the younger man yet.
Another, more vicious, glare, but when I don’t relent he sighs dramatically and runs the brush down Shenan’s flank again before answering, “It is calming to me. My…” he shakes his head, “I was supposed to let the house-elves prepare the horses when I wanted to ride, but I never liked that. Brushing and preparing them yourself is supposed to establish a connection and a first amount of trust between horse and rider. So yes, I prefer to do this by hand and by myself,” angry grey eyes snap at me, “Problem, Potty?”
He takes shaky steps further into the room. I lead him over the threshold and stop him. Carefully leaning him against me, I very slowly put my hands on the hem of his prison shirt. He barely flinches as I start moving it upwards. When I finally pull it over his head, I feel him shudder in my arms, but he stays still. When I run my eyes over his naked upper body, my throat closes. He is literally nothing but skin and bones anymore. His skin is something between pasty white and sickly grey. He is littered with bruises, cuts and scars. Since I can see each bone clearly, I also spot some bumps on them which suggest that they were broken and not properly healed. I take a shuddering breath, mumbling apologies all over again.
She nods, “I will leave you alone with them. See you next Saturday at the Burrow,” she says and touches my shoulder.
“It’s fine,” he waves off, “When someone you care about is in a bad situation studies take a second place. Believe me I know what it feels like. I only started to study healing myself because my sister got hit with a curse that was doing things to her mind.”
She nods, waving her wand and the black material lands right in her hand, “Here,” she holds it out to me.
Outside I call for the house elf again. She eagerly agrees to help me find my way back through the Manor. On the walk out I give it another try to find out who ordered her to feed the prisoners, but she just shakes her head again and says she is not allowed to tell. Sighing I say goodbye at the door and apparate back to Grimmauld place, glad to be out of Malfoy Manor.
“You do!” I answer in my desperation, “You make me proud. Just look at all the progress you made since you came here. I am so proud of you.”
this is more the time frame I planned to update. I can't promise it but for the first part at least I am trying to stick to uploading a chapter every second day.
“That’s good. Everything okay,” I rub his hand, my eyes locking with his, “Now why don’t you tell me what you are doing here?”
The next day I have to leave Draco in Hermione’s care for most of the day because I have to go to a mandatory lesson for my healer studies. A lot of the studies we can do from home (even though it’s advised to be actually present) but there are several lectures we have to go to unless we have a very good excuse. So my friend arrives early in the morning. Draco hasn’t moved the whole night through, but he seems as stable as he can get when I come in to get him for breakfast that day. He barely reacted to Hermione though and I put him back to bed before I left for lessons.
“I managed to get your case reopened after I brought proof of your spying. However they are not content with what I already presented them…”
I breathe a sigh in relief seeing his interaction with Dragon. At least he can work past his fear now. Careful I approach him. Hearing my steps, he stares at me with wide, slightly nervous eyes. I hold my hands up to soothe him.
“Yes, yes, that,” she waves it off, “He looks worse now. He is nothing but skin and bones now, deathly pale. Everything I could see of his skin is covered in bruises and cuts. And he looks like he hasn’t seen anything to clean himself since the day they put him in there.”
You only smirk at that, click you tongue and walk off as if nothing happened. I wonder why but a second later Ron claps me on the back, babbling something, probably about how I chased you off, but I don’t listen. I am way too captivated by the mystery that you represent to me.
That earns me a disdainful snort, “Would you be? I used to…” he waves his hand angrily at the mirror, “…look good. But this,” he glares at his reflection and I take a step forward because he looks ready to smash the glass, “At best I look like a ghost, at worst it’s disgusting.”
I still don’t know much more about the mysterious man’s identity. Like I said, I know he’s male. His mother is still alive, at least she was during our fifth year, so it is likely that he is still relatively young. Also he seems to have a vast knowledge of me or at least behavioural patterns. My guess is that he is some pureblood son who was forced into becoming a death eater and then rebelled by putting his life on the line as a spy. I am also sure that he lived in Malfoy Manor during the year leading up to the final battle.
My next clue is Tilly, the house elf, then. The Malfoy Manor itself is empty now, since Lucius is dead, Narcissa in the hospital and Draco in Azkaban. But the house elves stayed there. I remember that Hermione tried to convince them that they are free now. It was close to hilarious watching how everything she said was ignored. They were set on staying at the Manor and taking care of it in case one of their masters will return one day. I am wondering when Hermione will understand that most house elves don’t want to be free to begin with.
