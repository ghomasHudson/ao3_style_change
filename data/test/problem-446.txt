“So, any of yeh can tell me wha’ these are?” Hagrid asked, looking expectantly at the students, but no one lifted their hand. Harry and Ron turned surprised at Hermione, as she never passed a chance to answer a question in class, even Hagrid was looking at the girl. But Hermione was facing the ground sheepishly “I couldn’t open the book”.
Harry was admiring the big animal when Hagrid caught him by surprise, grabbing Harry under his armpits and lifting him on top of the animal, while babbling about Harry
“In the last two months, we spied on Lupin to learn his routine: Snape leaves him the Wolfsbane Potion is his personal quartes in the morning, and Lupin spends the whole day locked up. He has strong protective spells and wards in his quarters, plus physical restrains for himself. He also uses multiple layers of disillusionment charms and silencing spells” Miles explained.
After multiple students flinched, and a first year Hufflepuff cried, Draco was satisfied to make his way to the Slytherin table for lunch. He squeezed himself in between Pansy and Blaise, that were once again snickering.
“Wait, I got it” Cedric was laughing again, but once Draco stopped moving to allow the other boy to touch his hair, he quieted down. Instead, he was looking at Draco with upmost attention. He reached up, and carefully threaded his fingers through Draco’s platinum hair, and pulled a little white flower from it. Cedric caught Draco’s grey eyes in his caramel ones before he looked away to place the rogue flower in between Genevieve’s ears, who hissed once more.
“Okay, let’s do this again” he urged Flint to pay attention “Most werewolfs drink a Wolfsbane Potion every full moon, when they transform. They have to do that in order to maintain their rational minds and not hurt themselves while indoors. If they are outdoors for the full moon, it also helps to control their impulses so they don’t hurt anyone, or anything like that” Flint already looked distracted. Amanda gave Miles a empathetic look, and he tried to go over everything as simply as possible.
“That’s good” smiled again, and turned to continue to make her way though the castle, but Harry scrambled to his feet “Wait” he asked.
Draco liked to jump on a broom from time to time, and just enjoy the magnificent view – it was therapeutic. And, oh Merlin, therapeutic was just what he needed at the moment.
Lucius finished his tea and leaned forward, shoulders tense “I’ve never seen her like this. Even when ‘He’ was still around, she was always so contained and controlled, never losing composure like that. I would think it was a panic attack, but she was breaking things around her, and muttering nonsenses.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” Draco almost fell off his broom with the booming voice of his aunt resonating through the grounds “Get your scrawny ass over here right this instant!”
Blaise Zabini made a show of rolling his eyes and huffing every time Pansy and Draco jumped up and down in the Slytherin stand, but both of his friends knew he was internally amused.
The Dark Lord’s face contorted with anger, turning his handsome facial features into something animalistic. With a wandless hand motion, he defended himself from the fist blow – a killing curse from Abraxas, the elder Malfoy, and started muttering a incantation, probably trying to break the anti-apparition wards.
The Slytherins and Gryffndors were mashed up together in a line, and everyone took turns facing and dismissing the creature. So far, there had been some Dark creatures, some muggle lore, parents and even a few professors. When it was Pansy’s turn, who was a few people ahead of him in line, the Boggart turned into a mirrored image of herself.
It was the Saturday after the Quidditch tryouts, and the first weekend where the third years would be allowed to go to Hogsmeade, and Harry was really excited about visiting the village with his friends. But when he presented his authorization form to Filch, the caretaker stubbornly denied him, and before Harry could find a way around it, Remus was already behind him, with a hand on his shoulder, asking him to have a talk.
His Quidditch practice had ended a hour ago, but he wasn’t tired enough, so he stayed to try a few riskier maneuvers and fly after the snitch by himself. Now, he was spent and drenched in sweat, ready to take a warm shower and fall on his bed. But, of couse, he wouldn’t be so lucky.
Ron Weasley, someone she considered, previously, as one of her biggest tormentors, turned out to be quite receptive to a ‘know-it-all’, if said ‘know-it-all’ made herself available to helping him with his homework.
Later that day, Theresa found Harry in one of the alcoves of the Clock Tower that looked over the Courtyard, where the older students were preparing to leave for Hogsmead.
“... and lots of tasty treats. Yes yes yes. And then, you will change your allegiance. Remember: many treats. And here’s why I think you need them, it’s very simple: not enough fat. Don’t you agree? Croockshanks doubled in size since Hermione got him, and that’s a pretty active cat. You just lazy around all day, and if I poke you, like this, I can feel your ribs. That’s just wrong, don’t you think? Unless that’s a requirement, in that family, to be always fit, and perfectly put together, and pretty, all the time! That’s pretty unfair right? So, yeah. I offer you many treats, if you change sides. Then, you can spill all his secrets. All strategic information, of course, all his little quirks, I bet he has a lot, he seems the type, and all the-“
“Hagrid told me there’s been mer-people going missing after the giant squid died, and he didn’t know what was causing it. I didn’t think much of it until… I saw you, down at the lake one night.” Harry said, watching Malfoy’s expression change to one of horror.
Harry checked his watch, the moonlight glinting off its crystal face. 11.36. Harry peered at the numbers, then looked back out at the dark lake. He’d been sitting in his usual spot for the best part of an hour now, waiting for Malfoy to appear as usual beneath him. He had been down to the common room earlier as many of the 8th years were leaving, biding them goodbye and muttering well wishes for the Holidays. Harry had maintained a happy expression, trying not to seem obvious that he himself did not intend on leaving that evening. When asked, he said he was going to apperate home, as he had arrived at Hogwarts in that way. Nobody questioned this, to which Harry was grateful.  After the common room had emptied, Harry went back up to his room, the absence of Malfoy during the commotion of everyone leaving indicating to Harry the blonde was remaining here, perhaps cooped up in his room, alone.
Harry pushed the letter back into the envelope and tossed it into the trunk. His eyes wandered over the messy contents, illuminated by the orange light, and then followed it through the window, looking out at the glorious view of the cold winter evening outside. The lake shimmered golden, the frozen patches mirroring the warm light back into the sky, and a question dawned over him. Malfoy. Where would he go during Christmas? Would he remain here? Harry turned back towards his desk, fumbling with the papers on the surface to find the most recent copy of the Prophet, which he picked up and rifled through, eyes skimming its pages to find the name “Malfoy” anywhere in its articles. After flicking through the whole thing and finding no mention of the family, Harry frowned and rubbed his eyes. What if Malfoy was staying at Hogwarts? What if he went into the lake while Harry wasn’t here and something happened to him? He should tell someone what he’d seen. But then… if he did that, Malfoy would be in all sorts of trouble. He didn’t want to destroy whatever solace Malfoy had from going down to the lake at night, however bizarre Harry thought it was. Harry's brain whirred, before he came to a conclusion. He’d stay here, at Hogwarts just for one night extra, just in case. If he saw Malfoy going down to the lake again, he'd have to tell someone. If he didn’t go down then he must have gone home, or somewhere else for Christmas at least.
He stood in the silence waiting. The tear tracks from his eyes were tingling slightly and that was all Draco could feel of his body. Everything else was numb. A pointless body in a pointless house.
Harry woke with a start and fumbled for his wand on his bedside table. He grasped it, panting, and held it in front of him defensively, before he realised any danger he had perceived was just imaginary. Nightmares like this had become fairly regular for Harry, but in this one, just before he woke, he had felt a horrible burning sensation in his lungs, like they had been filled with water, causing him to lose his breath. Blinking in the darkness he noticed a thin blurry yellow light filtering from underneath his bedroom door. Harry quietly reached for his glasses and pushed them onto his face. Uncovering himself from the heavy duvet he crept towards the door, listening closely to the other side. He heard a couple of swift footsteps on stone, a faint creak of a door, a quick blowing noise - the light under his door immediately extinguishing following it, and a click of a latch. Harry lingered for a few seconds contemplating what he had heard, before deciding on silently opening his own door. He pushed it open and looked around, seeing nothing but blackness. He silently cast ‘Lumos’ illuminating the dark circular landing in a cold blue glow from the tip of his wand. He couldn't tell which of the doors had just closed from behind his own, so aimed the wand light down at the floor, searching for any clues. There was nothing. Except…
Eventually Malfoy straightened, snatching his cloak, trousers and shoes up, and strode back towards the castle. Harry watched his progress, shifting to see him for as long as possible before he disappeared from view, leaving Harry staring at the place he vanished from. Harry closed his eyes and rolled his back onto the wall beside the window, and groaned, letting his head drop against the brick wall behind him. This wasn’t good. Whatever he was doing, Harry knew it was definitely not something he could just forget about. He wasn't doing anything suspicious per say, Malfoy wasn't hurting anyone by going into the freezing lake late at night. And seeing as he got out, Harry supposed he wasn’t trying to intentionally hurt himself… was he? The idea of Malfoy intentionally putting himself in harm's way didn't sit well with Harry. The Malfoy he knew was cowardly, always putting himself first, never risking his own neck. But this was a different Malfoy. This Malfoy didn't care about anything, maybe not even his own life anymore.
“Yes professor.” Harry ate the rest of his custard cream, and reached for another. From experience, Harry knew taking just one biscuit did not suffice when in the hospitality of McGonagall.
Harry waited for a response, but Malfoy just blinked up at him, his eyes flicked quickly from Harry's eyes down to his bare chest, Harry feeling suddenly self conscious at his lack of clothing, and then back up to Harry's face, lingering wordlessly on his eyes before his mouth twisted in a grimace, and he looked down at the arm he was clutching. His left hand was clenched in a fist, shaking slightly. Harry lowered his wand to see it better. Slowly Malfoy uncurled his fingers, revealing an orange glow, which when Malfoy fully opened his hand, read ‘H.P’. Harry, having seen this effect before at the beginning of the year on Seamus when he'd tried getting into Dean's room, was unsurprised. Looking at Malfoy however, his expression of pain transformed into one of mild confusion, then irritation. Harry decided to remedy his lack of understanding.
“Hah, me neither, been running round this place like a lunatic, didn't even notice the days were also running past me. Well, have a good one Harry.”
Once the day's timetable had been completed, Harry trudged back to the 8th year common room, feeling deflated. He bypassed all the talkative inhabitants of the common room and up the stairs to his bedroom. Once inside, he let himself fall heavily onto the cushy bed. It was a good few minutes before he moved again, he had his head buried comfortably in the feather pillows, eyes closed against the blackness. Eventually he rolled over, and fell into a restless sleep in the dying light of the day, waking a few hours later to find himself bathed in moonlight from his window. He blinked, bringing his vision to focus and looked at the clock on the wall. The spindly hands read 10.03 pm. He’d slept through the evening, exhaustion overcoming him from the draining day, and missed dinner. There was no chance he'd be getting back to sleep anytime soon, so Harry dragged himself up from his bed and trudged into the bathroom. He took a quick sobering shower, and changed into an old grey shirt and some baggy plaid pyjama bottoms. He brushed his teeth and spell-dried his dark hair, which had grown to be long and ever more unruly.  He went downstairs into the abandoned common room, the embers of the fire still glowing in the pit, and made himself a steaming hot chocolate, smiling when he saw 3 custard creams appear on a plate next to his mug. He took them back upstairs to his room and sat on the end of his bed, looking out at the stunning view.
“Alright Potter, Merlin, this is such a mess.” Malfoy shook his head and squeezed his eyes closed. Harry waited.
Narcissa approached the gate and Malfoy saw her look at him. Her eyes were sad, but looked meaningfully into Draco’s.
Harry appeared at the top of the high street, head spinning. He blinked, and looked around him. The street was nearly deserted, A thin layer of frost coated the buildings and floor around him. He looked up towards the castle, and saw a tiny figure disappear behind the crest of the hill. He hitched his backpack higher over his shoulders and broke out into a run up towards the castle, hot breaths escaping his lips in clouds of pale white as he ran, the cobblestones echoing his loud footfalls. The wind lifted his long hair, and the cold air burned his throat as he made up the steep hill. As he neared the top he looked down into the grounds and saw the edge of the huge shimmering lake below. He stopped, doubled over panting, and squinted down to find the other boy. His eyes burned with the cold and watered slightly, blurring his vision. Harry rubbed his eyes, squinting, but he saw nothing. Harry remembered the boulder he could see from his window, and knew it was out of sight, a bit further across from what of the lake he could currently see. Deciding that this was likely his best shot at finding him, he jogged down the steep path towards the shore, slipping a few times on the loose gravel. Harry made it to the edge of the lake, and began to run along the shoreline, the huge castle above him casting a shadow over the shore. Harry could hear only the sound of his feet against the stony shoreline and his own desperate breaths as he ran. The lake was deathly still, unsettlingly so. Finally, after what seemed like a marathon, Harry looked up at the castle and saw the tower his room was situated in, and followed the line of sight from his window down, until he saw the boulder. Harry’s eyes widened when he saw the figure wading into the lake. Oh god, what was he doing? Harry swallowed and sprinted towards him, the burning sensation in his throat nearly unbearable. He skidded to a stop on the pebbles when he reached the boulder, which was strewn with expensive clothing. Harry looked out into the lake and saw the blonde head and naked, pale torso he’d seen so many times from his bedroom. Harry didn't know what to do. If he called out to Draco, it could end in a duel, but if he did nothing… Harry decided to squat down beside the boulder to recover his breath and watch Draco, see exactly what he would do now that he had a wand.
Hermione is clearly holding in a laugh. “We thought it was both, Harry, sorry for not being clearer.”
Malfoy looked hard at him, seeming to evaluate if Harry was taking the piss. Then he nodded. “I would have been nice to them anyways,” Malfoy told him. “I only ever hated them because my father did. But I learned the hard way just how wrong my father was about, well, pretty much everything.”
Draco just leans in and rests himself against Harry’s chest, sighing softly. Harry can’t hold back their smile.
“Yeah,” Harry continues. “And when I started to realise that, I started to deny and question. When I finally admitted to myself that I was bisexual, it was like a weight off my chest. I thought I was done. Dealing with sexuality was enough. I don’t want to have to deal with… gender issues… too.”
Draco didn’t respond. But after a few minutes of silence, Potter spoke again. “What’s your tattoo of?”
at him. Potter’s dress robes are perfectly tailored to his Quidditch-fit body. There’s a glint of emerald green woven through the edges of the fabric and Potter’s eyes look like jewels. Potter looks Draco up and down, and it looks like he’s hungry. Well, Draco thinks, there’ll be food at the ball. If they’re even going there.
It was quiet for so long after his words that Harry thought Draco had fallen asleep. But then, he said, “I’m sorry.”
“She’s an American Miniature Hognose,” Draco tells him as he grabs his tools and begins checking on Eleanor. “They tend to attack their prey using a form of legilimency. They take control of the victim’s brain so instead of running, they just sit and wait to be eaten.”
He pulled his eyes back towards Malfoy’s face, then grabbed the blanket from the bed and threw it at him.
“No, that about sums it up.” Draco’s smirking. “I do some potions consulting every now and then, but philanthropy is a full time job.”
“Alright, alright.” Harry allows himself to drop and can’t help his surprise when Malfoy’s arms are firm in holding him up. He pulls himself away quickly, and they repeat the falls until Betsy calls for the next activity.
He goes to the department store again after work. He finds a tight, dark green shirt with three-quarter length sleeves, and a pair of skinny jeans. Just to be nice. Not because Malfoy would look good in them.
“Good. Glad that’s settled.” Harry takes the small snake from Malfoy’s hand and places it on the exam table. “Is this another big one?”
“Ron and Hermione know the relationship is fake, but everyone else needs to think it’s real. I love Molly to death, but she can’t keep a secret to save her life, and I’m not close enough to anyone else to ask them to keep this quiet. Got it?” Potter’s brow narrowed as he waited for Draco’s confirmation.
Harry’s earbuds were playing music for him as he walked back to his room after the run. He started stripping off his sweaty clothes, turning to walk over to the bathroom and shower when—
“Malfoy… I’ve never worked with magical snakes before,” he admits, realizing that must be what she is.
The first activity is trust falls. Malfoy glares at him before turning around, as if daring Harry to drop him. Harry catches him easily.
“No, I can – I’ll try,” Malfoy says, still sounding hesitant. “You’re right. It’s not on them to educate other people about their own identity. I actually spent some time reading up on social issues after one of the Wizengamot judges handed me a book on the dangers of pureblood culture after my trial.”
Harry wakes up nearly every night with a nightmare. Sometimes he’s screaming, and Ron’s shaking him awake. Sometimes he just wakes up in a cold sweat, and heads to the common room to avoid waking Ron up. Sometimes he sits on the common room floor for hours, short of breath, trying to remind himself that it’s over. That he’s safe now. Ron’s safe. Hermione’s safe.
Harry can only shrug helplessly. The damage has been done. He waves his hand at the walls. He doesn’t know how Malfoy didn’t notice the snake jokes and cartoons last time.
It’s “Wow, Potter, finally decided to grace us with your presence?” It’s “Hey Potter, ever heard of a comb?” It’s “Do you ever stop eating, Scarhead?”
Harry’s still excited about the retreat. Leaving the Aurors to teach feels… right. Like he’s finally doing something that
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” Hermione says. “We thought you moping around was because you had finally figured out that you like boys.”
Malfoy waves him off. “No, you’re right, it’s a fair question. Gertrude was my first, I found her on the side of the road in Diagon one night. Can you imagine? No idea how she got there, but my guess is she was abandoned.”
Everything is going just fine up until December. It’s the last social before the Yule Ball. Draco doesn’t have a date, but he doesn’t really mind, he’s actually looking forward to going with the other eighth years, as a group. And Potter doesn’t have a date, either. So at least he won’t be the only single one.
The common room door opens and Granger peeks her head out. “Not to interrupt, just wanted to let you know that we can all hear you. And also that we’re ready to get started.”
“I just…” Harry rubs at his face. “I don’t know if we should keep doing these lunches,” he gets out.
“I’m glad to hear it! Now, you two follow me. I’m going to show you the most romantic spot on the ship.”
“But, couldn’t he have just gone to a Muggle vet then?” Ron cuts in. “I mean, a vet that’s actually a Muggle?”
him,” a deeper voice — Arthur Weasley’s — retorted. “You think it’s a coincidence the engagement gets announced the same day the boy uses Wilkie’s Law to get out of exile? He’s using Harry.”
Gilbertson glared at him. “I was trying to do you a favor by giving you a head’s up. I’ll see you soon, Potter. Get ready for a thorough interrogation.”
The Snake Whisperer continues to do well, and The Snake Charmer grows larger each week. Harry gets to see Draco every day, and shag him senseless, and tell him that he loves him. Gertrude seems to adopt Dave, taking special care of him when she thinks Harry isn’t paying attention.
“We need to talk.” Hermione sits down on Ron’s bed and stares at Harry, who groans and sits up in his own bed. Ron is sitting next to Hermione and looking vaguely guilty.
“I’m sure Draco would be telling his friends about how nice I am too,” Harry says, “if he had any friends to tell.”
of them and-” Hermione stops herself and takes a big sigh. “Actually, I need a bit more time to cool off. Ron, your turn.”
were there, and I thought I may have been losing my mind til the article came out in the Prophet the week after that you’d become a Muggle vet.”
“You need to learn how to trust the other teachers in your school,” Betsy announces, looking around the room. “If you’re here with some of your colleagues, I’d encourage you to partner up. If not, find someone in your row. And let’s get started!”
Harry walks away quickly out of the bar and towards the lifts, but they can feel someone following them. Whipping around, Harry finds Draco walking swiftly to catch up with them.
Draco looks in his formal robes, and Draco keeps looking at Harry like he knows exactly what they’re thinking. After they finish eating, Draco pulls them away to the auction tables.
Ron tells them all about the newest line of Exploding Parchment, and Hermione “cools off” enough to rant about the Department of Mysteries for a solid hour, and then they’re putting Rose to bed and hugging Harry goodbye.
“They can turn themselves invisible, when they feel like it,” Malfoy tells him. “Fantastic creatures. But Bertha’s been acting strange recently. She won’t stop moving around, she’s being very squirrely.”
,” he can’t help but murmur out loud. Because she is. She’s got to be at least six feet long. He’d measure, normally, but the way Malfoy’s worrying his bottom lip makes Harry think it’s an emergency, so he decides to leave her be until he figures out what’s wrong with her. Her scales are bloodred, and she almost looks like a mamba except… well, red mambas don’t exist. There’s a twisting pattern of soft yellows and oranges down her back, and Harry’s reminded of the sunset. She doesn’t really move once she’s settled on the table, other than to flick out her tongue.
“Yeah, I’d noticed, thank you,” Malfoy cuts him off. “We can Transfigure it into two beds at night. Can’t allow the Muggle housekeepers to see them like that, though.”
“Yeah. Thanks.” And maybe that was why Harry had gotten nervous about bringing the subject up to Hermione: he’s known her and Ron for so long that the prospect of them changing the way they think about him is… terrifying. He knows Malfoy, but they have little history besides being childhood rivals, and having Malfoy think about him in a new way is much more palatable.
“I don’t know if I ever hated you. I definitely didn’t like you. But things changed.” Harry took another deep breath to steel himself. “Things changed when we kissed. When you bonded with Molly. When we saw each other naked.”
A bell goes off, and Malfoy and Harry start their hobble to the first obstacle. Harry steps over with his right leg, then they pull over their connected legs, and Malfoy brings his left leg over. Next, there’s a line of cones to navigate around. They’re moving slowly, and the old men to their right are overtaking them. Malfoy’s grabbing onto Harry’s arm, and Harry’s doing his best not to move it around too much.
A tap on a microphone cuts off the flow of conversations around him. Over the sudden quiet, a speaker announces, “If you could all please find a seat, we’ll be getting started soon.”
It seemed like… some part of him had been waiting for this. Since that first ill-fated meeting in Madame Malkins all those years ago, Harry had been intrigued by the mean, judgemental boy, and a bit of his mind had maybe known even then that Malfoy was capable of learning, and growing, and changing.
“You don’t like me,” Harry tells him. “You… think I have a punchable face. You were miserable at the ball-”
“Yes, that’s what Harry said too.” Molly looked thoughtful. “Hmm. What if you two got married at the Burrow? It could be a small event, nothing too much, but that way it’s a little bit more special for the two of you than just paperwork?”
And then, because Draco’s mouth betrays him and he’s too used to snapping at Potter, he says, “Scared, Potter?” And he instantly regrets it. Because Potter glares at him, and says “Never.” And now Potter’s coming across the circle, curly hair wild, crawling on his knees towards Draco with a look of determination, and Draco doesn’t even have time to back away before Potter’s hand is behind his neck and he’s
Malfoy’s different from usual, and not just because he’s wearing a Muggle bathrobe instead of his tailored dress robes. He’s twisting his hands together and isn’t insulting Harry, and though that is an improvement, Harry’s thrown off.
Draco thinks that one needs no response. They sit in silence for a while, listening to the Hobgoblins play song after song. Weasley and Granger giggle their way over, and plop themselves down next to Potter.
There aren’t too many teachers at the bar, although Harry spots Padma at the end. He sits down next to them. “Hey, Padma, how’s it going?”
made them feel uncomfortable, but that means Harry prefers ‘they’ pronouns, and that means… that means they definitely are
“I may have thought your practice was a snake charming shop. In my-” Harry’s laughing. “In my defense- Potter,
Draco doesn’t know what to say to that. He should leave Potter alone. He should get up, and leave, and go to the kitchens for a snack. Or he should get up, and go back to his room. He certainly shouldn’t be here, sitting a foot away from Potter, on the floor, in the middle of the night. The silence is wound so tight it’s almost painful.
Potter laughs, then realizes Draco isn’t joking. “Oh, you mean it? I don’t think there’s alcohol in anything.” Draco looks pointedly at Granger, and Potter laughs again. “Hermione’s not drunk,” he says, then scrunches his forehead. “I don’t think she is, anyways,” he amends, then leaves to get drinks.
Potter gets on his knees and starts picking up Draco’s spilled books and quills. After a moment of hesitation, Draco joins him, and they shuffle in to the common room together once everything’s been shoved back in his bag.
, but he’s not sprouting shit against marginalised groups. Which, like, yeah. I guess the bar really is that low, but it’s Malfoy, isn’t it?”
But everything is not the same. If he enjoyed kissing Malfoy, does that mean he’s attracted to Malfoy?
Malfoy moves to leave the exam room, and Harry grabs his arm. “You don’t- I’m already seeing you right now, aren’t I? Just make an appointment next time.”
They spend the evening in a bidding war against each other at every single item up for auction, and it’s the most fun Harry’s had in a long time. After a few hours, Ron and Hermione stop by to wish them a good night, and Draco tells Harry he should head out soon too.
There’s a crate in front of them next that they have to hop on and get over. Malfoy moves first, sticking his left foot on top, then bringing their combined legs up next. Malfoy steps his left leg down, and Harry stands fully on top of the box – but when Malfoy moves to bring their combined legs to the floor, he moves too fast, and Harry’s pulled down with their legs.
“It’s going to be okay,” Harry tells him softly, briefly touching Malfoy’s arm. “We’ll figure it out. Why don’t you take a seat?”
Harry grabs the light from his wall and briefly shines it in Gertrude’s eyes. Her spectacles, the covering over the corneas, look normal. He checks her glottis, nostrils, and back muscles. He runs his hands down her underside, checking for any lumps and making sure her vent is clear.
“So I need to come in,” Malfoy says slowly. “Come in, talk to Dave, make an appointment, and then he’ll stop harassing me?”
They’re turning into Hogsmeade now. None of the shops are open but a few early birds are out walking dogs. No one seems to notice them.
“Yeah, that’s him. Well. He was the flying instructor when I was hired as the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.”
Malfoy’s cheeks turn a bit pink when Harry mentions that she ate. “Well, good,” he replies imperiously. “I’ll be seeing you.”
As they closed the door, Arthur stepped into the room. “Great, you’re back. Come with me; Auror Gilbertson is upstairs.”
Harry looked at the photo again, and thought angrily of all the times he had been a ‘witness’ to Lucius Malfoy acting under Voldemort's orders. Without thinking, Harry pulled his wand out from his pocket and silently performed a summoning spell for a pot of ink, a quill and some parchment. Immediately he heard a cry of pain followed by a smash of glass from somewhere above him. Harry had momentarily forgotten he was at the Weasley’s, not in his own kitchen at 12 Grimmauld Place. A piece of torn parchment zoomed into the room and into his hand, and a quill landed neatly in front of him.
He looked up momentarily as something moved in the corner of his vision. One of the many portraits in their fancy frames had shifted, it’s eyes trained on the boy below him. Draco looked up and met the gaze of one of his ancestors. It was a fierce looking man in Edwardian fashion, that sat in front of the very same fireplace Draco was standing beside, but this version glimmered with orange flames. They held each other's gaze for a moment, before the portrait pulled out his wand from beneath his robe and ceased the roaring fire behind him, the warm colours of the painting shifting to match the monochrome pallet of the real world. Draco nodded, appreciating the gesture. But his eyes lingered on the wand the man held in his hand and something inside of him lurched with sudden urgency. His wand. He could finally get his wand back. And once he was reunited with it he could finally finish what he'd been trying to do all year.
“This is bad. Really bad. You know how Inferi works, don’ ya Harry?” Hagrid looked in disgust down at Malfoy. “There’s gotta be a host.” He said in a loud whisper.
Draco smirked, and grabbed Harry by the shirt again, pulling him down into a biting kiss, his sharp teeth grating Harry's lip. Harry's eyes fluttered with a mix of pain and pleasure, and he rolled his hips against Draco’s, searching. Victoriously feeling something hard underneath him, he pressed himself down into it, smiling into their kiss as he heard a deep moan from the other boy.
“I saw the papers. Your mother...” Harry paused, and swallowed the dry lump in his throat he had procured as he watched a crease in Draco’s eyebrows form.
Harry sat and watched, the minutes ticking by. At around the 10 minute mark, Harry was getting frustrated. What on earth was this person up to? Why on earth would they risk getting caught out of bed past curfew just to stare at the lake? It made no sense. And as Harry seethed silently at the figure, it started to move.
Malfoy laughing eased into a grin, and then into a tired seriousness, and he breathed heavily, looking at Harry. His eyes scanned his face, and came to rest on Harry's bloodied lips. As Harry also caught his breath back, he suddenly felt very aware of Draco's entire body pressed up against his. He could feel the others body heat radiating into him, bony hips pressing against his own, creating an odd twisted sensation in the pit of his stomach.
“Well… yea. As soon as I saw you were just… swimming, I didn't suspect you were up to anything, but knowing that stuff about the lake I felt like someone should, I don’t know, just keep an eye on you, just in case? How were you supposed to know the lake was dangerous?” The expression that crossed Draco’s face was unreadable. It had softened from the horror struck expression, but his brows were still pulled close together. He looked conflicted. Harry fidgeted with the sleeve of his sweater, picking at a loose end. He felt foolish for telling this to Malfoy, but maybe, just maybe it would convince Malfoy to reveal his own secrets. After a while of silence, Malfoy huffed a derisive laugh, and sneered up at Harry.
“Don't follow me, Potter. I’m warning you.” Malfoy yanked open the front door and Harry ran, arm outstretched, but in vain - Malfoy hurried down the steps, turned on his heel and disappeared. Harry reached the door frame and hung off it, watching as the last piece of Malfoy vanished into thin air. Panic rose in his chest, and from his lips escaped a frustrated shout. Shit, shit, this was bad. What had he been thinking? He hadn't even got Malfoy’s plan out of him before he vanished. Where had he gone? Harry slammed the door and went back to the living room, and paced the length of it. Malfoy was in danger, he was a certain. Would he have gone straight back to the lake? Was he that stupid as to go and face whatever was in there without anyone knowing about it? Harry knew of course. Malfoy’s words echoed in his head. His cries of “I don’t need your help” ringing in his memory. The image of his smile when he was reunited with his wand. But then his sudden determination. Oh god. What was he about to do?
“Dark magic always needs a sacrifice. I knew you dying wasn't an option, so I knew the only other way was me.” Harry admitted. Draco nodded. Harry was surprised Draco wasn't more angry at Harry for putting his own neck on the line. They looked at each other, and Harry reached up to touch Draco’s lips, soft and warm under his fingertips.
Harry raised an eyebrow, impressed. He stored the detector safely back in its box and grabbed his glass of port, smiling.
Harry looked at his watch, which read 11.24pm. Time to go to bed, he thought gratuitously. He’d send a letter to Ron in the morning, confirming both their suspicions that nothing strange-
The couple untwined each other's limbs painfully slowly. Harry bounced his leg impatiently. Once the couple had parted enough for Harry to get between them, Harry hurried through them into the common room, turned the corner and eyed the space for Malfoy. He saw the table filled with food, but no one was sitting in front of the silverware. Harry let out a breath, and wandered over to the table in disappointment. Where was Malfoy? This repeating question was getting dizzyingly frustrating as it did laps around Harry's mind on a regular basis. Harry huffed, and placed a heavy hand against the stone wall, and the curiosity inside him sparked and glowered. Harry pictured the blonde in his head, infuriatingly silent and unmoving, as Harry reached for a chicken leg perched at the top of the pile of them on the food table in the common room before chewing on it, unsatisfied, and throwing the clean bone onto the table, where it clattered and rolled into a dish that emitted a metallic clang. Harry huffed again, and turned, sourly towards the boys corridor, until his eyes rose to look at the archway, where he saw a figure, and he paused.
Draco sunk to his knees before the hearth. He closed his eyes, and his mind slowly resurfaced. And there, he saw Potter. Trapped beneath him with Draco’s dagger pressing a divot in the dark skin of his pulsing neck. Draco replayed the memory in his mind, only slightly aware of the burning sensation melting his icy demeanour. Harry's heavy breaths had lifted Draco’s body slightly as Harry had panted that the wand wasn't in Hogwarts. Then a painful memory of the head butt - Draco rubbed the site on his head, the lump that had grown there still slightly present under his fingertips. And then the weight of Harry above him made Malfoy breathless once more. It had unsettled him at the time. He’d had no physical contact with anyone like that. Draco felt his heart hammer against his chest at the memory. He’d looked up into Potter’s face, all red and full of life. It hurt to think about how very different they were. Harry was red, and he was green. Warm vs Cold. Happiness vs Misery. The weight of Harry had been real in that moment. Everything Draco had felt of him came to the surface, looking up at the boy who’d informed his entire life, pressing down on him, commanding him once again. Draco thought he’d never get free from that. A part of him didn't want to. It was easy there. Safe, almost. Draco felt himself go hot and forced himself to not linger on that moment. He had got away after all. He still wasn’t sure how; Potter had the upper hand. Draco remembered Harry’s face after he’d mocked him about binding him up and a knot tightened itself in his stomach. No, Harry’ d lost control because it was unexpected, nothing else. If anything he’d probably been disgusted. That must have been it. The weirdness of their position probably made him recoil. Draco had spat something at him, and rounded the corner, entering his own room and collapsing on his bed, with his heart pounding. He’d gripped his dagger painfully tight in his hand, the events of a few seconds prior burning itself into his memory.
Harry received an owl at breakfast one morning in November. It dropped a letter onto his toast, and Harry sleepily picked up the grease-stained letter and turned it over. His heart skipped with joy when he recognised the untidy scrawl of Ron's handwriting. Harry tore the letter open, unfolded the parchment and began reading eagerly, hearing Ron’s voice through his choice of words and expressive handwriting.
Draco Malfoy was kneeling before him, looking utterly uncomfortable. He was breathing heavily, and his face was twisted in a pained frown, an expression of cureless mire. The silence between them hung dreadfully for what seemed like minutes. Harry couldn’t quite comprehend this predicament. He was under the impression Malfoy had left the castle under Auror supervision, but as he looked down at the boy, confusion clouding his only half awake brain, he supposed he had just assumed this, he hadn't actually seen Malfoy leave the castle at all. Harry’s eyes washed over the other boy, taking in the ruffled white hair, the hollow cheekbones, and Malfoys thighs, that were spread on the ground defencelessly. Harry's abdomen tightened seeing Malfoy look so vulnerable, something he'd noticed himself feeling while watching Malfoy in the lake. He looked over Malfoy’s white face, his lips were pressed tightly closed in a firm line. Harry fingered his wand in his hand and decided to break the silence.
“That’s why I tried to sneak a wand in. I needed it to perform the summoning spell. That’s what you saw me doing now. The Inferi have been awakened. They were supposed to kill me, Potter. Merlin knows what is about to happen now that I’m still alive.” Malfoy became quiet, and Harry took a moment to process what he'd heard. His skin crawled slightly as he realised the implication of Malfoy saying the Inferi had been awakened. He was reminded of the mission he took with Dumbledore, at how those bodies did not relent, how they only just made it out alive. This lake was about 50 times larger than that one, and filled with a lot more life. But then Harry looked at Malfoy, and remembered that he’d caught his wand when Harry threw it to him, he had fought them off.
The screaming had stopped. It was instead replaced with something horrible. The Inferi were mumbling, moaning, the screams sounding different underwater,  like they were in pain. Horrible, agonised, tortured moans. The water gave their voices new meaning. Harry felt his limbs being held, but did not fight it. He would either die like this, or his idea, as mad as it was, would work. Harry waited for the pain, the monsters to start attacking and tearing at his flesh as they did to Malfoy, but something bright made his eyes open in the water. He saw the blurred outlines of the rotting Inferi surrounding him, but also a shimmering ball of fire just out of his reach. Something started to come into focus, and he saw Malfoy swimming towards him, a halo of flames protecting him from the scaled hands reaching towards him. A hand grabbed his, and he was pulled into the flaming sphere, two arms wrapping around Harry and holding him tight. Harry breathed in Malfoy, held his head in one hand and wrapped his other arm around the boys’ shoulder. He could hear the moans of the Inferi becoming louder, confusion and pain deafening his ears, but he closed his eyes and felt the magic between the two boys working. He focused only on Malfoy, the image of him pounding in his head, letting the intensity of the feeling he'd been trying to suppress all this time free to be acknowledged by the other. He felt Malfoy’s magic reciprocating, and he'd never felt anything quite like it. It was if his whole body was on fire against the other. It was almost painful, but wonderful at the same time. It felt like a promise, a bond. A magic so magnetic, nothing could touch them. They held each other like this for a while, the sounds of the Inferi slowly ebbing away, until all Harry could hear was the roar of the flames he and Malfoy were suspended within. Harry opened his eyes carefully, squinting at the bright flames. He lifted his head from Malfoy’s shoulder and slowly turned to see the other boy looking back at him. Nose to nose they stared into each other, something invisible chaining their eyes together. Harry pushed forwards, his whole body urged him to do so, until his lips collided with Draco’s, who immediately responded. The heat intensified but Harry only felt Malfoy’s lips and how they moved perfectly, all of his senses reacting at once. He felt a hand enter his hair and felt every follicle on his body stand on end. It was like a surge of static, his muscles tightening at the sensation and he pushed further into Draco.
“My wand, Potter. I know you have it.” Draco said this in such a quiet, low voice, it was almost a whisper. Harry looked over him. He was cloaked, but Harry couldn't tell if he was armed, he’d not seen beneath his cloak when Malfoy was knelt on the floor. But if he'd wanted to get into Harry’s room so badly, he could’ve attacked him at any point while Harry was busy healing his hand. Harry was still unsure, and now Malfoy’s hands had disappeared beneath his black cloak.
“Draco?” He said. Harry squeezed his hand encouragingly, and Ron looked between them, a look of confusion and fear etched into his features.
After muttering the password (still ‘Dumbledore’) and ascending up the revolving staircase, Harry knocked lightly on the door of the Headmistress’s office. He swallowed, feeling slightly nervous. Maybe he was being a bit presumptuous, coming up here uninvited all of a sudden.
“Sorry?” Harry felt a trickle of doubt creep up through him. He fingered the tip of his wand poking out of his pocket. Malfoy wouldn’t dare attack him, would he?
“We have to get help.” He said, looking seriously at Malfoy. “It’s the only hope we have. We need to lure them all out, and just completely obliterate the whole lot. We can round them up, I'll call the ministry, we can do this...”
Draco dragged himself up off the floor and knew where he needed to go. He needed his wand. Knowing Harry, he would be at the Burrow for Christmas, which already meant this would be a hell of a lot easier without having to confront Potter again. But this time he wouldn’t have Potter’s empathy to take advantage of.
They stood like that for a while, saying nothing, just looking at each other. They were both wrecked, blood stained, sweaty, and surrounded by their own ruins. There was a layer of debris covering the entire floor. They were engulfed in torn furnishings, burns on the walls, and even a small fire made of destroyed objects was burning in the furthest corner of the room.
“I thought I heard something down here. You, I suppose.” the way Malfoy spoke was gentle. Harry looked, confused as the blonde stepped down from the archway and approached the dinner table. Harry just stared at him, but Draco had broken their eye contact to look down at the table's offerings. He surveyed the food, and reached for the chicken bone Harry had flung across the table. He picked it up between a slender forefinger and thumb and examined it, turning it in the candle light to examine its bumps and lines, before placing it back on the table, brow creasing, Hooded eyes downcast in introspection.
The minutes went by painfully slowly, but Harry persevered. He could hear a vague chatter and laughter emitting from the common room below him, but he remained dutifully watching the lake, despite the tempting activity. After a while it died down, and Harry began hearing people returning to rooms and the sounds of farewells and doors opening and closing on the landing. Harry appreciated the new silence which eventually settled in the dorm, and found himself concentrating a bit more on the scene below him. Thankfully, the scenery wasn't completely still for the entire duration of his watch. He’d seen a lone deer emerge from the forest momentarily, grazing on the frosty grass, before slipping back into the shadows of the trees. A little later on he saw a creature, presumably a mer - person, break the surface of the lake, a small dark head poking just above the water, then re-submerge moments later. Harry also witnessed a couple of rabbits hopping around Hagrid's pumpkin patch, scavenging for food in the quiet darkness.
“Of course I haven't forgotten, Potter. I think it’s just a bit… broken after what happened last year.” Harry remembered the Fiendfyre, and felt disappointed in himself for not considering what kind of damage that had likely done to the Room. Harry didn't falter though. He took a couple of steps towards Malfoy, eyeing him up. He could see Malfoy better now. His white hair was glowing amber slightly, and his eyes flickered with the reflection of the fire next to him. He was wearing his usual white shirt with the sleeves rolled up over his elbows, half tucked into tight black trousers. He could see he was a little flustered, and his lips were parted. Harry smiled darkly. Malfoy narrowed his eyes.
Harry inhales sharply. He’d only just started to realize he felt confined by gender, and hearing that word already gives a sense of freedom.
His mother had found him lying on the floor, passed out in his own blood. She rushed him to St. Mungo’s. When he came to, his left arm was nothing but a mess of torn skin and drying blood. The Healer had been kind to him. “It’s going to scar,” she said. “I will do my best, though.” And she had. All the others could see now were the scars. Not a trace of the Mark. And as gruesome as it looks, Draco’s relieved to have the snake gone.
Draco refuses to run through the castle, so he makes do with a brisk walk. Potter’s legs are shorter but he has no problem keeping up. They’re almost to the common room. Could the prank be waiting there for him?
Harry only has a few appointments Monday morning, and they’re over pretty quickly. He brings a Western Hognose back to its owner and finds Malfoy sitting in the lobby, a beautiful metallic blue snake on his lap. Harry’s starting to wonder if he’s going to need to Obliviate Dave of all the magical snakes he’s seen. Eh, it’s probably fine. He hopes.
Granger picks Weasley, who admits to adopting a stray rat he found near the kitchens. Ernie MacMillan does a cartwheel. Dean Thomas eats a piece of parchment. And then it’s Draco’s turn.
Harry doesn’t respond. He thinks about Charlie Weasley, flying around on his broomstick outside the Burrow, no shirt on, racing Harry in the air. Harry’s stomach feels queasy, just like it did then. And then he thinks of Malfoy’s lips, and how soft they were, but firm, and how just before Harry pulled away, it seemed like he was kissing him back- and how nice it felt.
Malfoy keeps showing up like he belongs at the clinic. It seems like he doesn't know he's not Harry's typical client, but he
“Slow walkers. When people are late. Loud chewers. Being on boats. Think you can do me?” Harry gave him a challenging smirk.
Harry’s become so used to the bed being Transfigured into two by Draco before even getting to the room at night, that they’re nearly startled to see just one bed.
“Well, sure, but this seems like the kind of thing… shouldn’t I not burden them with having to explain their own identity? Shouldn’t that be on me to understand on my own?” Harry asks. “It’s fine, just forget it, you don’t have to answer if you’re not comfortable.”
Harry crumples up the wrapping paper and throws it at him. Draco’s never going to let him live that one down.
Harry pushed the door open so hard it slammed against the wall. Draco jumped from his seat, and so did Gilbertson.
Draco, who was bobbing in the water, gasping for air. Harry swam as fast as he could, making quick strokes through the water. Draco’s head dipped under and back up, and Harry’s heart left his body.
Malfoy gave Harry another panicked look, but Harry just gave him a confused expression in return and took a handful of Floo powder.
“I’d rather gathered that, thanks,” Harry replies. “How’d you get to having so many snakes? I mean, after Nagini…”
Harry’s starting to accept that they have a long road ahead of them, with coming out to their friends, and potentially even to the wizarding world. And they know they’re not ready for that now, but Harry thinks with Padma working at Hogwarts with them, and Draco, too, being as supportive as he is, that it could be good to be out to even just the students. Maybe at Hogwarts, there’ll be kids that don’t identify with a gender, and having both Harry and Padma as professors could show those kids that it’s okay to be who they are.
And nothing is wrong with the snakes. It almost seems like Malfoy is using the snakes as an excuse to show up, but obviously that makes no sense. Why would Malfoy want to see Harry? And so often?
"Yes," Granger nods. Draco can barely believe they've worked together on something. "So we've created a petition that we hope everyone will sign, and then I'll bring it to Healer Vincent. We'll still do socials when they're scheduled, and work on inter-house unity, but here in our common room instead of in the Great Hall with the entire school."
A beat later, Harry adds, “It’s just – you knew Padma’s pronouns, right? So I figure you know about this kind of stuff?”
Harry thinks about what it would mean for him to be separated from gender identity, and the possibilities seem endless. Experiencing what it’s like to be Harry, not just on a level of choosing careers that make sense for him, but being fully and completely himself, in every manner of his life. No more walls limiting what he can be.
“And here I was, feeling insulted that you wouldn’t kiss me goodbye after such lovely dates,” Draco teases. “Turns out you were just waiting to be in a workplace setting, that’s certainly more appropriate.”
They walked towards the dock, following the signs. There was a man with an aggressively curled mustache standing on the docks in front of a two-story ship.
“Eleanor looks fine to me,” Harry says. “If you’re really concerned, you could give me a few memories of her doing the behavior, but it’s up to you.”
Harry nods. “I bet. Well, Malfoy’s snake was fine, just had a bit of residual skin from her last molt. Hermione, how’s work for you?”
“I mean, my practice isn’t incredibly busy, is it? I only work with snakes,” Harry says. “I don’t mind if you just walk in, but Dave- well, Dave’s an administrative purist. He’d want appointments even if I only had one client.”
“Right,” Harry replies, remembering the rest of McGonagall’s rules. Harry’s not sure why she picked a Muggle teaching retreat, but Hermione had researched it and told him it was quite well-respected. He briefly wonders if it’s because Malfoy is one of the new teachers, but reminds himself that he’s witnessed firsthand Malfoy’s newfound lack of bigotry.
Draco stops and turns to Harry once they reach the Apparition point. His grey eyes are so sharp, and Harry leans in. Kisses him.
Wide eyed, they stared at each other. Pyrites was the first to move, left to dissapparate and never be found. Snape was second, raising his wand to
He was pleasant to work with, with precise charmswork and delicate hands, although refusing to outright touch any rogue substances that oozed during the de-fanging process. Draco also slowly relaxed his stance during the lesson – he started stiff and businesslike, but by the middle of the class turned to making jokes and funny faces. Hermione was aware that she would be annoyed about it if they weren’t ahead of the rest of the class in the assignment, but since they were, she allowed to laugh along with the boy, and to let her attention to slip enough to see how the rest of the students were doing.
He got off his broom outside one of the Manor’s back entrances, next to Bellatrix, who was just cancelling her
After saying goodbye to Remus, Harry decided to spend some time with Hagrid. He still hadn’t properly spoken with his friend this school year, and was feeling guilty about it.
Miles might not agree with prejudice against muggleborns, but he respected the Old Magic traditions.
- aaaand it was the wrong answer, he could tell by their faces. Harry was now sweating while his friends were looking at each other with weird expressions.
it to be Malfoy. Harry was fuming, he was about to enter the castle when a teasing voice made him turn around “Excuse you Potter. What got your knickers in a twist?” Malfoy looked unbothered, a teasing smirk tainting his otherwise emotionless face.
And now here Draco was, trying to search through his happy memories – which he had many of, thank you very much – to create a silver animal smoke shield. It all seemed very stupid.
– oops! Bad word. That’s a bad word. He knew that because Tessa told him after he said it once. Yeah, let’s forget that. This is not even
“How d’you do that, Draco?” Bellatrix asked, quietly. “It’s your magic, Tix” he grinned, producing more sphere’s of light and butterflies, oblivious to the atmosphere of the room.
Either way, Draco wanted to know the protection charm. Not only because of the Dementors – since it was unlikely he was ever going to face one again – but because it was a beautiful spell and the communication benefits were awesome. He asked Sybill to teach him, and then he would teach Pansy and Blaise.
“So” she gave him a side glance “were you ahead of us already? In the curriculum?” she worried her bottom lip – why did she do that to herself? She predicted the rest of the afternoon in the library trying to catch up, if he sad yes.
“What about you?” the Hufflepuff asked, looking up “Are you doing anything special today...? With... anyone in particular...?” Cedric seemed to cringe at himself by the end on the sentence.
“Honestly Bellatrix. I’ve annulled it’s effects with a counter potion. The most damage you’ll endure is a slight hand tremor and a full bladder” he sneered “You really have the audacity to question my proficiency in the subject I dedicated my life to, as if I’m not one of the most respectable Potions Masters in the whole world right now. How do you imagine–“
“But, you know, Draco, the important thing to take from this is not who is a Animugus, but, who wasn’t able to become one” she gave him a heavy look, that his aunt matched.
Lost in her own despair, she almost didn’t notice Draco’s. The boy was dealing with it worse than she was, sweating profusely and with silent tears streaming down his face. “I can’t block them out” he whispered with a strangled voice. Draco was very susceptible to outside influences, she remembered. She couldn’t imagine what he was feeling right now, if she already felt so awful as it was.
Draco squirmed in his seat in the headmaster’s office, looking around at the weird pilled up artifacts, and trying to organize that night's events in his head.
He felt bad about dimming their excited looks, but he had learned about Animagi Theory, and he just wasn’t really interested.
Malfoy’s expression was serious, but Ron’s was angry and Hermione’s was sad. Harry turned around to leave, once again. And once again, a posh accent stopped him “Poor Golden boy, are you feeling threatened? That’s why you’re dumping your insecurities all over the place?” the tone was mocking but his words were rushed - however, Harry barely registered any of this, and before Malfoy finished talking Harry already had his wand out and was sending a very strong stinging hex towards him.
It wasn’t Harry’s fault! Malfoy was just... always there! With his superiority complex and smug looks... It was easy to gravitate towards him with arguments and sneering and rude words. Either way, the harmless sparr was much preferred then the intense brooding and explosions of anger. But there was still anger.
“Did you say ‘Malfoy’?” Harry asked, he had to be sure. “Yes, Malfoy. I heard some second years talking about him” Hermione answered, still throwing glances to the new boy. “A lot of girls talking about him” Ron mumbled as Hermione blushed. But Harry wasn’t really paying attention “Well, my dad told me a lot about the Malfoy’s” Harry started, and Ron and Hermione exchanged worried glances in front of him. “What?” he asked.
“I have no flowers on my hair!” Draco screeched. He had made sure to get rid of all those little abominations. He started to shake his head from side to side profusely, messing up his hair, just to make sure.
puzzled about Ravenclaws, they really should have this all figured out, but I guess applying academical knowledge to real life situations might be a little challenging for them”
Hogwarts students, overall, didn’t appreciate Herbology enough. Hermione attributed that to Professor Sprout’s kindness and easy going attitude – which allowed to considerable slacking off, not that Hermione would ever to that. She quite liked Herbology. But, of course, she liked all of her subjects. A side effect from growing up as a muggle, is that everything magical became
Draco scowled at her and went inside. He only had forty minutes to get ready, and refused to use cleaning spells as a replacement for showers – that was just barbaric.
” Draco yawned. As he sat up, his cat slid from his chest to his lap, and hissed angrily at him. Draco held her face and hissed back.
“Alright children, lets finish this up before I let you go” Remus called them back to their tables and Draco gave Harry a soft smile before nodding and going to his place besides Pansy.
Peter was frozen in place, apparently shocked by his own actions, and Snape found himself incapable of even looking at the men. As Pyrites got into the room, he immediately raised his wand to the boy behind Lily’s body, and started casting the Killing Curse when, all of a sudden all three Death Eaters buckled - the mark in their arms burning. Only, it wasn’t the regular pain of being called upon, but the blaze of the harsher lines fading – and that could only mean one thing.
With concentration, Draco just felt a unspecific rush of agitated magic, he couldn't pin down where it came from or where it was going. The vibration was too faint for him to determine if it was Dark. Another peculiar thing was that he could also feel some emotion emanating from it... Joy? Maybe.
- I am very sorry, but I'm not from the UK and don't know how to make this very cohesive, as it happens there in the 90's. If you see something wrong, let me know and I'll try to make it better!!
Hermione seemed about to protest some more, when she gave another look at the map that Harry was folding, before her eyes widened a fraction.
Draco knew how ancient Hogwarts was, but he was still overwhelmed. Ever since summer, when his parentes agreed to let him leave Beauxbatons for the Scottish school, all he did was research - needless to say he was very excited to finally be here.
“Looks like your stellar reflexes are limited to when you’re in a broom” she huffed, but smiled nonetheless.
The sounds of the storm around Draco were getting louder, so Lucius strained his voice to be heard “Maybe we should call a healer, or a cursebreaker -“

In a split second, Draco lowered his shields so fast that the man wouldn’t even realize that they were there in the fist place, and pushed to the forefront of his mind deliberate thoughts of ignorance, about what a nice conversation he had, and how he shouldn’t have left the bed just to walk his cat. At the same time, without wavering, Draco wished the man a goodnight, providing plenty of eye contact for him to easily pry those staged wavering thoughts. Thankfully, Draco was trained well enough to manage such a feat - he would have to send a thank you note to his aunt for it.
was a tricky charm, sure, but it was based on emotion, and one thing Draco was always in touch with was emotion. A whole month had gone by since the whole Dementor debacle, and he was still annoyed. His and Pansy’s parents were absolutely irate when they heard about it, but the ministry wouldn’t change their stance. His father told him that he was once offered to join the board of governors of Hogwarts; after all of this he would probably rethink his previous refusal.
When Draco return to school after the holidays, he had been advised not to share any of the new knowledge he acquired – but he couldn’t keep it hidden from his best friends, he just couldn’t, especially Pansy.
to just control himself, just as much as she wanted to recoil and cross her arms over her abdomen, over her poorly healed
After some more bickering, they all made their way out of the castle to Care of Magical Creatures. Harry was able to sustain his good mood for about ten minutes, before he realized who they were sharing the class with. Harry’s deep sight got cut off by Hermione’s elbow in his stomach.
curious once he heard of ‘Slytherin Princes’, ‘the only Malfoy heir’ and their ‘power and influence’.
He barely got to listen to the commentary of what was happening with the rest of the game before the Snitch was in his line of sight once again. He sped downwards, wind ringing in his ears. The little sphere was going straight down and Harry was dropping vertically in his broom. The grass below him was getting closer and closer, but the Snitch was not changing it's course and if that damned ball could move last second then so could Harry. So that’s what he did.
When Remus directed them to the next lesson, Harry left hurriedly, Ron and Hermione on his toes. “Can you wait a second please?” Hermione said to them before taking a few strides to the opposite direction on the corridor, where the Slytherins were leaving to their next lesson. Harry’s wrist clenched when he saw Hermione approaching Malfoy, a slight blush to her cheeks. “What is she doing? Why is she talking to him?” Ron seemed to like the interaction as much as Harry did. They waited for Hermione to return before demanding a explanation.
“Sorry” Cedric Diggory smiled as he propped himself on the ground next to Draco, who was getting to a seated position. “Some students said you’ve been here since lunch, I wanted to check that you hadn’t been stunned or something like that”.
Hermione gasped but her worries were unfunded, because Malfoy just raised his empty hand and deflected the spell wordlessly. He at least looked a little alarmed. Harry felt embarrassed by his friends reproving and impressed expressions, so he turned and left, this time for real.
And maybe he was also trying to avoid Sirius’s encouraging words, always ready to motivate him after one failed operation. But this was the seventh time James went on a rampage after a false piece of information regarding Peter Pettigrew. Merlin, how James hated Peter.
“Oh, no, no, no” Ron continued bitterly “She’s just more discrete. But don’t think I didn’t notice that our picture from last term suspiciously disappeared. I think she’s making a secret altar for you in her room” he grinned at Harry.
There really was a reason as to why it was called a revolutionary model. So much speed, so much control, so much precision... He was feeling giddy.
After another subdued conversation, Draco left to the dungeons, with Genevieve on his arms. He soon got lost in thought, imagining what his parents might have kept from him, but it was probably stuff regarding Death Eaters and the War, and Draco always shimmied himself out of those conversations, because he never liked to think about the wrong things his parents did before him.
Remus had explained the theory of the spell and was walking them trough the wand movements. The jinx was suppose to produce a large bubble, and used to trap a target. It was a difficult charm, so Remus said that if by the end of the class they could only produce a physical one, he would already be happy.
Shoeless, trouser-less and cloak-less, wearing only his white school shirt and underwear which poked out slightly beneath the hem of his shirt, Malfoy stepped towards the lake, pausing at the lapping waves that bordered the vast body of water. A few moments later, Draco started forward and waded into the likely freezing cold water. Harry stood up, concern rising in his chest as he watched Draco go deeper and deeper until only his head and shoulders were visible above the surface of the gleaming lake. What the hell was happening? The water must be utterly freezing, Malfoy was crazy to be going in. Plus he didn’t have a wand, and it was dark, and there was no one around to help him. No one could know what he was doing, except Harry, who watched him in bewilderment.
“Yea all good Harry. I was just wondering, I think I need some advice…” Harry was only half listening as Neville explained his problem. His mind was too preoccupied with what had just happened. Malfoy had looked at him. Made eye contact with him. That hadn’t happened for weeks. Harry followed the line of Draco’s jaw in his memory, the way he’d tucked the hair behind his ear…
“Well, If anyone can think of no other reason for us to stay, I think our work here is, well, done.” the Aurors looked at one another, and made small noises of agreement. Harry couldn't help but to find it slightly amusing at the disappointment in some of their faces, they had expected a huge fight from the dark detectors signals.
McGonagall wasn't exaggerating when she said that NEWT’s were going to be tough. Harry had been given more homework in his first week than he could have imagined possible. Harry looked down at the utter chaos of parchment, spell books and ink set before him. Only one week had passed and he was already swamped. He gave a dramatic sigh, and held his head in his hands. He closed his eyes, and listened. He could hear the rain pitter pattering on the window panes, the fire roaring in the enormous fireplace, gentle conversation from the other 8th years spending their Sunday evening in the common room. Ginny, who had made a habit of joining Harry in the new common room most evenings instead of Gryffindor tower, sat on the sofa opposite Harry. She snickered. Harry looked up and glared at her.
They got to the statue of the embracing couple, and Draco stood before it, looking up at the faces of the individuals.
They stood in a barren hall, a sort of ante-chamber; old, crumbling concrete boxing them in. In front of him he saw a gate that stretched the length of the room, with a small corridor-like space behind it. the metal bars occasionally curled into strange words Draco couldn't make sense of. A cold feeling trickled down his spine as he saw two more Aurors standing on the other side of the gate. Where were they? Draco had thought he was to be taken back to the Manor for the Christmas holidays. Draco looked around, trying to discern his location from the room. He looked up, and his stomach dropped. a blue glow stretched above them, and behind it, black robed figures floated ominously. Draco swallowed and returned his gaze to the gate. A horrible realisation had sunk through him. He knew where he was.
“Inferi!” Ron wheezed as he came to a stop in front of them, doubling over, struggling to get his breath back. Harry watched as the aurors skidded to a halt, the majority of them armed with their wands, looking around for the danger. One of them, a tall, bald wizard Harry vaguely recognised, locked eyes on Malfoy, and pointed his wand at his chest.
“All this business with trying to sneak a wand in too, that’s been blown way out of proportion. Gosh, I’d know I’d try and get one if I couldn’t have mine, imagine being here without a wand!” Neville gestured at the room with an incredulous look.
Harry didn't have to wait long before he got an explanation for Malfoy’s absence. It came in the form of his Daily Prophet, which was dropped in his cereal the next morning by a ruffled looking post-owl. Harry saw the article as he browsed the paper, and his pulse quickened when he saw the photograph of Malfoy being escorted from Malfoy Manor beside the title of the article. He skimmed through the piece until he found what he was looking for.
Harry occasionally looked up from his work to peer out of the window, and scan the scene below him. This process of working, looking, then working again eventually became routine, and Harry got used to the process. At just past 10pm, Harry noticed Hagrid’s lights going out, yellow squares disappearing from the now completely monochrome scene. Harry blinked, and noticed now without the light of Hagrid's hut, he couldn’t see that well; the candlelight from his own room was casting a yellow glare against the window pane, making it impossible to see much out of it. Harry reluctantly extinguished all the candles, the prospect of getting any more homework done extinguishing along with them. Now, the only thing he could do was look out of the window and wait. Harry sighed, slightly regretting agreeing to do this now that he had no other distractions, and put an elbow on the arm of the chair, leaning his head against his hand. He watched for a while, taking in the whole wintery scene, before checking his watch again. Squinting in the low light, and angling it towards the light of the moon, the clock face read 10.27pm. Harry dropped his arm onto the soft blanket covering him, and decided that if there was nothing here by 11.30, 12 at a push, he’d call it a night and go to bed. Feeling a bit better for giving himself a time limit, Harry watched more intently at the scene below him.
“Yea, well, thought I’d come and take a look at the place before everyone got here. How’s it been, Hagrid?”
They spent the afternoon talking, exchanging stories and reminiscing. Eventually it started getting dark, and Ron announced he had to get back to the office to finish up and report back to Kingsley. They said their goodbyes to Hagrid and left the warmth of the Hut, stepping outside into the biting cold and silvery moonlight. Harry insisted on walking Ron to where he could apparate from, and as they walked passed the reflective lake, the scene reminded Harry of the figure he had seen on a similar moonlit night.
Harry nodded. Uncertainty lingered slightly in his mind but he knew this was the only way he was going to find out what Malfoy was doing, and to put a stop to it if he needed to.
It was if a trap door had been released under his feet and he was falling through the darkness. His pulse pounded in his ears and his vision swam.
“Minister. I do believe we have had a confession of highly illegal dark magic from the Malfoy boy. It is only right if we immediately escort him to Azkaban to await trial for his crimes.” the bald wizard growled. Harry felt Draco’s hand go limp, and saw his eyes widening in fear.
“HARRY!” He looked around, and saw a group of people sprinting towards them, lead by Ron. He was red in the face, and sweat plastered his red hair to his forehead. He was followed closely behind by a group of men and women dressed in Auror attire. Kingsley Shacklebolt could also be seen a little further back, his embroidered cloak flashing as he ran. Harry stood up, grabbing Malfoy’s hand and pulling him up with him. He didn’t let go of Malfoy.
A whisper escaped Draco's mouth, pushing past Harry's lips, and the light around them disappeared. The heat, the static and the sensation vanished, and Harry felt himself fall, losing contact with Draco, before hitting something cold, and he sank, he couldn't breathe again.
“Hagrid!” He saw the half-giant walking towards him from the courtyard, his big beard obscuring the huge smile that Harry knew laid beneath. He was in his usual moleskin coat, keys jangling from somewhere within, and he reached his arms out towards Harry as he came closer, and engulfed him in a crushing hug. Everything went dark, and Harry was momentarily buried among the folds of his coat and bushy beard. He resurfaced, and looked up into the glimmer eyes of his friend.
“Will you shut up!” He shouted. “Stop laughing Potter!” Malfoy demanded petulantly. Harry's laughter trailed off, so that he was reduced to giggling, and he leaned back against the wall with his legs bent and wide apart, looking up at Malfoy through strands of black hair, raising an amused eyebrow. He loved seeing Malfoy wound up like this, and now he knew precisely why.
“He misses you.” Ginny muttered, gesturing lazily at the letter in Harry’s hand. Harry just smirked, and carried on eating his breakfast, the exciting prospect of seeing his best friend again in two days giving him the motivation to get through the rest of the week.
“FIRE MALFOY! THATS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS!” Harry yelled, and Malfoy nodded, and blasted fire beneath him, kicking away the attacking Inferi. Finally, the tower started collapsing, and the number of Inferi was lessening. Bodies were piling up on the shore, Harry had to climb over them to reach Malfoy, who was just finishing off the last few bodies. Finally free of the Inferi, Malfoy stumbled towards Harry, his torso torn and bloody, and collapsed before him, Harry only just catching him under his arms. Wet, from the blood and lake water, Harry pulled Malfoy up, lifting his legs around his waist and stepped back towards the shore. Malfoys skin was almost painfully hot to touch, it was like he himself was on fire. Harry cleared the bodies of the Inferi and carried Malfoy up the shore, before gently letting him down on the grass, and examining his injuries. Malfoy’s legs looked flayed. The skin looked near destroyed. It was gruesome and Harry shuddered. He knew he needed to stop the bleeding immediately, so recited a healing spell. He waved his wand gently over all of Malfoy’s gashes, which slowly started to knit themselves closed. Harry hoped his magic was powerful enough not to leave too bad scarring. He worked his way up Malfoy’s body, paying extra attention to the deeper, more traumatic cuts. He looked at Draco’s face every few seconds to make sure he was still breathing. With every cut healed, Malfoy’s face relaxed, the crease in his brow loosening. Harry’s own body relaxed simultaneously, knowing Malfoy was going to be ok. Finishing up healing, Harry examined Malfoy once more, then stood up, intending to go and get the bag still left at the boulder.
McGonagall shot at both of them, and Harry tore his gaze from Malfoy to look at her. He’d normally feel guilty for breaking the rules but today there was a fire raging inside him, so he didn't care. He looked at McGonagall seriously, as if trying to silently communicate to her that Malfoy had deserved it, the git.
“McGonagall put hex wards on all the bedroom doors. Seamus found out the hard way on our first day before you arrived.” Harry felt slightly guilty no one, including himself, had thought to mention this to Malfoy. The fact Malfoy had not even overheard this piece of information just proved to Harry how isolated Malfoy had been this term. He’d been so vacant, and Harry wanted to know why.
“DEAN! Your bloody door handle burned me!” Seamus screeched, and shakily opened his palm to reveal a glowing “D.T” stamped on his palm. He looked murderous as the three other boys roared with laughter.
“What are you doing back at Hogwarts? What good is it coming back here if you're going to be locked up in Azkaban before you can sit your exams?” Malfoy’s jaw tightened, and Harry's heart sped up. He could see that had struck a nerve, and waited for Malfoy to retaliate, to bite back. Go on. Harry's conscience egged him on. Fight back.
“I can smell burning.”  Mrs Pince whispered sharply. Harry raised his eyebrows and shrugged, although he couldn't help a small smile curling on his lips. He felt slightly ecstatic at the idea of a midnight duel with Malfoy, especially in the Room of Requirement, where they could go for hours and no one would hear them. He was going to get out all this pent up rage and anger, and Harry couldn't feel more darkly excited. Mrs Pince’s eyebrows creased. Harry knew he'd been caught.
Harry pulled on Malfoy’s wrist a little and turned it towards the lamplight, while his other hand gently tapped out a few drops of dittany from the vial. He watched as the potion instantly got to work, the magic liquid quickly finding the wound and absorbing itself into Draco's skin. He heard Malfoy hiss quietly under his breath, and his arm tense slightly under Harry's grip. After a couple of seconds the orange glow faded, leaving the wound as just a red scorch on Draco's hand. Harry tilted his head, admiring his handiwork, and raised the vial to the cork between his teeth, depositing the cork in the hole and pushing it in with his thumb.
Malfoy quickly recovered though, faster than Harry had anticipated and sent a spell flying towards him, a hex he didn't recognise. Harry managed to cast Protego just in time, which made the unknown spell ricochet into the fountain, causing a large gush of water to spray onto the crowd of people standing nearby with a loud splash. Harry hated to admit it but he was enjoying this. He’d not had a proper fight in ages, and Malfoy, the bloody git, had been winding him up all week with a new charm he had invented, which when cast upon parchment, made the edges razor sharp, cutting Harry’s fingertips whenever he picked up any of his papers. Impressive magic, Harry had admitted, but with utterly infuriating and painful results.
“You’re not allowed a wand, You’re under ministry supervision. I would be breaking the law if I gave it back to you, and I, being the hero I am, don’t want to ruin my reputation.” Harry knew he was laying it on a bit thick, but he couldn't help it. Seeing Draco riled up did something to him, made him feel things he hadn't felt for ages. Draco released an impatient breath from his nose. Harry spoke again.
“Harry, you realise he's just about to go on trial. The whole ‘stolen wand’ drama probably scared him straight, he probably just doesn't want to ruffle any more feathers or he’ll end up rotting in Azkaban for as long as his father is.” Ginny looked at him with eyebrows raised, and then looked back at her parchment and carried on scribbling out an essay. Harry considered her words. It made sense that Draco wouldn't want to cause any more trouble, but he seemed more distracted than just ‘trying to behave.’ He was totally unavailable, like his attention was focussed elsewhere entirely. Harry thought about earlier that day when he tried getting Malfoy to pay attention to him by ‘accidently’ launching a potted fig plant across the greenhouse, making it explode loudly against a table, grabbing everyone's attention except the one boy he wanted it from. Malfoy didn't even bat an eyelid, and Harry lost 10 points for Gryffindor. He hadn't mentioned to Ginny about seeing the figure at the Lake, but that was such a stretch he thought she might find it strange that he was making such conclusions after only seeing the figure one time, and hearing Malfoy go into his room many hours afterwards. Even Harry considered it a bit far-fetched, but something told him he was right in believing that the cloaked figure was Malfoy.
“Sorry” he gasped, looking up to a group of girls in Ravenclaw embroidered uniforms, and then to the one student he had accidentally pushed over to the floor. He bent down to help her gather her books and parchments, and realized that the girl was none other than Cho Chang – the other house’s Seeker.
Draco had perfected his emotional control since the time they were kids, but the Gryffindor Golden-boy just knew how to throw that progress out the window. Pansy couldn’t really blame Draco, Potter
“Uh oh, don’t go all Harry on me now” Ron laughed, and nudged her with his elbow “That’s probably how they taught it in France. Don’t read that much into it, or soon enough you too will be coming up with conspiracy theories about the Malfoy’s controlling the Minister”
When she learned she was a witch, Hermione though everything would change. And most things did. But she still had no friends. Kids still said mean things behind her back. She still felt like a pariah - alone and isolated. And she couldn’t blame it on the feeling of being
we’ll get punished, and say goodbye to your N.E.W.T.S.” and then “Get out of my way Malfoy. I’ll make sure you’ll get some credit for it if you behave”
“Harry! Wha’ a surprise! Do come in” Hagrid pulled Fang away and gestured for Harry to sit at the table, while he started to make some tea. Harry was going to drink more tea today then, yay.
Draco was excited about his Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, it was a practical one, and they would be facing a Boggart. He was familiar with the spell, as were most Purebloods – living in ancestral homes, with very old miscellaneous artifacts - that could easily house Boggarts - used to do that. The last time he faced one, he was met with a vampire – to Draco’s defense, he was 7 at the time – and right now he wanted to see what it would become - he had a hunch though.
“No, it’s not really doing anything” he continued going towards the grounds “It’s getting closer, but they don’t seem to have any particular intent”. “
Harry couldn’t get pass everything Malfoy represented, and he wasn’t actually trying to get past it either, not allowing himself to get back into that downwards spiral of confusing feelings, that always managed to bring up thoughts of his father and Sirius as well.
Still in the garden, but in it’s ending portion, was a hexagonal hedge maze. With high walls and a large fountain in the middle, the maze also housed an endangered species of Fairy, that could mess with it’s visitors heads, making them get lost in it for days if they were in a bad mood. Narcissa assured Cygnus that the Fairies mostly kept to themselves, but avoided the maze all the same.
“We’re all children Harry, the War is over” Tessa could sound so grown up sometimes, like she had it all figured out. But she was only twelve.
Draco stretched his hand to hold Bellatix’s wand with her – a common request of Draco for the members of the family, that after failed attempts of trying to explain why it wasn’t polite to touch another wizard's wand, decided to just indulge him. After all, it was his way to get closer to his loved ones magic.
“His mother is a Black, and she was my cousin” he shrugged “We were actually quite close when we were kids, but she has always been a good pureblood through and through. She sent me a couple letters a few years after the War ended, actually”.
Draco’s parents told him about the Potions Master over the Winter Break, how he used to be a friend of the family. Draco tried to sympathize with the men, thinking about how lonely he probably was, how he lost the woman he loved. But looking at how Snape’s face contorted in disgust every time Potter opened his mouth...
“Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley! What is the meaning of this?!” Harry turned around slowly, already grimacing, imagining McGonagall’s angry face. What he wasn’t expecting, though, was a pair of curious silver eyes, locking on his.
“Harry! I knew yeh were a brave one! Come here!” Hagrid signaled for him to jump over the fence with him, to where the creatures were.
Other extremely amusing part of the match was the ire of one Harry Potter, who was red faced and muttering to himself. From time to time he would fly by the Slytherins to – and Blaise suspected, exclusively to, – scowl at Draco, who was always ready to make mocking faces for the further entertainment of his mates – and enraging of Potter.
“Thanks for the validation,” Padma says with a snort. “And it’s not just that either, it’s – you and Malfoy.”
They’ve taken to spending time together in the daytime, too. Draco can’t help but notice Potter’s strong hands as they repot plants in Herbology. The flex of his forearms as they race each other on the Quidditch pitch. The way Potter’s eyes close when he’s laughing too hard. The way he’s all grumpy in the morning, until Draco shoves a coffee his way. The way he snaps at younger students for looking at Draco in a bad way. The way he still needs to save everyone and everything, from a first year student who’s afraid to fly to Draco himself, when he gets stuck in the mud on the way back from Care of Magical Creatures.
Harry just glared back as Gilbertson left the conference room. He finished up the last bit of paperwork, dropped it off at the front desk, and headed back to the Burrow.
A few more minutes in silence pass, and when Draco looks over, Potter is asleep, slumped onto the floor.
“Apparently, because I’m not a lightweight,” Harry replies, smiling softly and looking pointedly at Draco. His hair is mussed for once, and he looks… more human. Harry hands him a cup of coffee.
Harry now was looking at her intently, like it was his first time hearing english after listening to only russian for months. She took a breath before continuing.
“Hmm, why do you ask?” Draco couldn’t help but tease, smiling wickedly. Cedric actually scowled and pushed Draco’s shoulder lightly.
“Harry, right?” Draco Malfoy asked with a half smile. “Ugh, yes” Harry answer dumbly, his voice cracking, he noticed the students were suddenly quieter and cursed internally when he felt a blush starting to creep up his face. “My name’s Draco”
“Okay then” Pansy tried to keep a clear head, since Draco was looking lost and Blaise had wide and manic eyes “You go get a teacher” she ordered to the latter, that nodded before turning to were they came from and started running. She faced Draco “What should we do? Is it trying to hurt us? Or to get inside the castle? Should we run away too?”.
Draco was disappointed at that. He wanted to spend a little more time with the other student. Especially after noticing how good the Hufflepuff was looking, with his soft brown hair and long legs stretched in front of him.
“He already completed the whole charms curriculum! The boy could break those wards better than the three of us combined!” Amanda insisted.
Pansy Parkinson inspected her nails one last time. She had decided on matte black with little swirling green serpents on each of them – pretty cute, but complicated spellwork, the type that wasn’t really noticed or appreciated very often (what serves her well, since she always liked being underestimated).
“Well, aren’t you a lucky boy” his aunt was terribly cheery, it was unnerving “We happen to have two great teachers at hand!”
“Oh Merlin you really scared me” he smiled at the other boy, but Harry was frowning and his expression didn’t change. Draco lowered his shields just enough to feel the boy, and he was met with distrust and suspicion.
“I did” Harry crossed his arms “I just still find it weird he can roam freely after curfew” he mumbled under his breath.
Draco was nervous from all the stares for about a second, before a familiar black haired girl broke from the crowd, and jumped in his arms with wide eyes and a huge grin, “Draco? Oh, I can’t believe it!”. He hugged her tightly and twirled her round once, laughing “Hi Pans, how do you like the surprise?”. After he put her down she sized him up with a exaggerated pout “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! I honestly didn’t think you were capable of keeping secrets”.
“Thank you, Harry” she stood with the rest of the Ravenclaws, and Harry felt a little embarrassed when he notice how intensely her friends were staring him down.
“I didn’t know you had a cat” Cedric’s spoke, after Genevieve’s hiss broke the tension that had built up in the air – the ungrateful feline.
It was when Hermione was feeling her most hopeless that things started to turn around. Who knew that skipping the long anticipated Halloween Feast to cry alone in a bathroom about not having any friends and being attacked by troll – of all things - would result in... friends!
Harry ended up saying to Ron and Hermione go without him, though he was bitter about it. And now he was here, having tea with his practically-uncle, and with sudden chills running over his spine “He’s coming for me” he muttered.
“Yes, nothing’s wrong, I just want to talk to you for a bit, is that alright? It’ll only take one second” he assured her.
So, either way, it bothered Harry to now that there was a “JamesxSirius Situation”, and he didn’t like that he was being lied to, and that it was happening at all. In conclusion, he would keep it a secret, because he had no desire of thinking about it any longer.
“Shhhh, keep your voice down. I’m being serious” he sighted before trying to explain everything to Marcus once again “Think about it. Snape has been dropping hints nonstop. I heard that he’s been giving the same lecture about werewolfs to every year. The last Defense professors were so incompetent with the curriculum that he can get away with it”
It was still one week before the game when the blond boy climbed up the small table in the middle of the Common Room to organize the students into one enthusiastic Hufflepuff fan club.
Deeper in the windmill of what he recognized as the 'problematic' line of thinking, Harry put himself under the magnifying glass. He new that 'being gay' wasn’t genetic – he wasn’t stupid – but when he questioned his feeling, maybe he could see that – what? No. No, no, no, no. That’s stupid, let’s not even think about that. Harry’s not a
“Oh stop it, you big baby” Pansy got up from the bed “Now, make yourself useful and teach us that bloody spell already”. She pulled Blaise up from her desk too.
Before the crowd dissipated, the Ravenclaw seeker showed up in front of him. “That was a good catch Harry” she smiled at him from under her eyelashes “I hope I’m a bigger challenge next time” she waved him off before leaving, and Harry stared dumbly after her for a second - she really was pretty. He was blushing, but thankfully the team was still too distracted with their victory to notice. He made a mental note to ask around for her name later.
Hermione’s face was all scrunched up while she opened her mouth to reply, and Ron almost recoiled in the eminence of her retaliation, when they both got distracted by some giggling coming from the other side of the table. They turned to see Malfoy using his hand to cover his mouth while he laughed.
when Draco was halfway through them. The boy heard about the Moving Stairs before, but he never saw it happen. Now, he was in one. After it finally steadied he was dropped off another twenty minutes away from the dungeons.
- fyi: Voldy read Bella's mind in that moment bc he saw her twitch, and wanted to know what was up in there.
As soon as the whistle was blown and the players got in the air, Blaise saw Cedric scanning the Slytherin stand – now covered in black and yellow – until he found the head of silver white hair that was leading the chant.
The Malfoys really were a powerful family – they might not be the oldest, but the impeccable way they managed themselves throughout the years made sure they held one of highest spots in the worldwide Wizarding Community.
“I think she’s Theodore’s older sister” Hermione said, leaning in to watch the Map with them. She looked up to find matching confused expressions “Honestly! He’s from our year. He’s in Slytherin” she rolled her eyes when her friends exchanged dark looks after that.
“Not really Petunia. I’ve gotten a few offers, but I think I might stay here for a little while longer. I think it will be a nice change of pace” he smiled. At the end of the table, Harry and Tessa exchanged excited looks. They
Either way, Hermione had cornered the Slytherin and forcefully scheduled a study date for them, so here Ron was. Harry had refused to come, after throwing a temper tantrum about loyalty and whatnot – honestly, even Ron was tired of the whole rivalry/obsession that his best friend kept pushing.
They could both now see the grounds through the large archways, and Pansy pulled on the sleeve of Draco’s robes, trying to get him to stop, but he kept going, despite looking like he would pass out in any second. The corridor they were in was completely empty and dimly lit, and seemed unnaturally cold. By the time they reached the end of the hall, Pansy was shaking alongside Draco, and squinting trying to see outside, were the Sun had already set.
Harry finished unfolding the Map, letting it splayed completely open over the table, so they could see the entire castle all at once.
James Potter punched the tree beside him, so hard that leaves fell around him and his knuckles got bloody. He was so angry that the men around him didn’t dare to utter a word, and just waited on what to do next.
He considered going to Remus with this, but the Professor was still sick. Plus, if Remus somehow already knew and was also keeping it a secret... No, better go to his friends.
Silence echoed between them again. They eventually hugged, letting their affection express what couldn’t be put into words.
He made a point of being friends with the other boy early in his schooling. It was simple to do, offering Marcus a bit of tutoring and listening to his nonsensical musings from time to time. And although not enjoyable, it had been worth it. Flint was from a rich pureblood family, and he could easily provide contacts and status by association – all that Miles needed, being one of the few Slytherin muggleborns in the school. Not that he knew how few there actually were, since they all made a pretty good effort of hiding it.
” Draco tasted the name in his mouth, and decided he really liked the flavor. “Oh no, darling, just- no. I mean, I get it, he’s nice to look at, but that one just
other students, Draco was a Malfoy, and that meant he wouldn’t be undignified. So, before he stepped onto to the stairs leading to the headmaster's office, he straightened his back, put on a blank expression, tightened the hold on his cat – that started to squirm back to consciousness due to Draco’s worried emotions – and made an effort to look as if nothing was wrong.
“I wouldn’t be so smug, Ron” Hermione interrupted his musings “Ginny has been ogling him quite a bit”, he inspected his sister down the table, that was, in fact, staring the Slytherins.
After a few moments, Ron tumbled through the Fat Lady portrait, his robes dusty and face set in a grimace.
Ages later, at least that's what it felt for Harry, it was time for dinner – which with was always entertaining with his mother’s side of the family. “Are you planing a new work trip soon Sirius?” Petunia asked, after some light conversation. The Dursleys weren’t as respectable to Sirius as they were to the rest of the family, because he was a freelancer, and never showed a interest in settling down with anyone. Once, Vernon and Petunia even sat down with James, trying to convince him that Sirius was a bad influence on his kids, and was taking advantage of his hospitality – it was one of the few times James got angry at them. But after scolding them about how Sirius was one of the main reasons he was able to get his life back together after Lily’s murder, since the man basically gave up on all of his own projects to attend to Harry and Tessa – while at that time the Dursleys were still ignoring James -, they never brought up the subject again.
With a flourish, Zabini made to turn away from them, pulling Pansy along, but Harry raised his wand before they could.
A sphere of light formed in her hand. “Get my wand” she whispered to Narcissa, that gently coaxed it out of her son’s grip.
- maybe is not even that big of a deal, and that’s why they didn’t tell us. Maybe it’s just starting”
” he spoke bitterly, before taking a somber tone “I think it was the frustration. We’ve wasted so much time and resources to find it, but it was fruitless. And also because of Regulus – he was never found, so the prospect of figuring out what happened to the actual medallion is slim. She is just so worried, we all are. With Pettigrew’s escape, and Trelawney’s Prophecy – it seems like something big is about to happen”
Therefore, he hadn’t discussed what he witnessed during the Holidays with anyone yet. Not his sister, not his best friends, not his hometown friends.
Tessa was sad that Harry kept all of it to himself since Christmas, that’s why his thoughts had gone so dark and he got so upset. But her brother was like that sometimes, he took it from their Dad – keeping quiet about his feelings until eventually imploding, short temper, self sabotage... Sirius taught her about that too, after one time Harry and Dad screamed over the dinner table and refused to talk to each other for one week.
When he got to his dormitory, his friends were already asleep. With a pounding headache, Draco made a cocoon around himself with the blankets and raised his occlumency shields as best as he could, hoping for a good night of sleep.
“Well, uh, do you know who you were speaking to, just now?” she looked at him intently, making him squirm, before furrowing her brows “Tell me this is just about you being an overprotective brother Har”.
“That’s quite enough Bella!” Narcissa started to pull her sister back, but wandless and furious, Bellatrix just used her hands to push her sister to the ground, and turned back again to shake her nephew and scream in his ears, she tried to grab her wand back but he held on to it, so she was now grabbing at his wrists, his cries against her screams.
Draco scrunched up his face in distaste of the name, making Cedric laugh once again, but still responded with a awkward reverence he did while still sitting in the alcove and said “Well, it’s your pleasure”
At this point Ron and Hermione noticed his approach, waved their hands and greeted him, but Harry didn’t listen. He kept his pace towards the trio and passed through them, bumping his shoulder strongly with Malfoy in the process, making the skinnier boy stumble back.
James asked if they would mind looking after Harry for a little while longer, since he needed to have a
“I swear to you, this is happening. And it’s a very dangerous situation. Snape works under Dumbledore so he can’t do anything about it. But
With a trembling hand, Bellatrix gave her wand for her nephew to hold, and got down with her sister in front of him, waiting expectantly “Return it to me Draco, please”. He looked at her with wide eyes, held the wand tightly with both hands, and closed his eyes, his face contorted with effort. “Are you doing it? Is it working?” she asked, her tone starting to gain back the edge of hysteria.
As it turns out, students start their classes in Beauxbatons when they are ten. The school offers lighter and more dynamic classes, beginning with a general overview of magical theory, wandlore, and other magical manifestations. The first years get to go home at weekends, or after classes sometimes, and family visits are accepted. Also, a few times during term, they have organized field trips, through
They had a short staring contest but soon enough she caved and offered her hand in a truce. Harry shook on it and they moved on with the conversation without exposing more of their childhood ‘events’. After a while Hermione pointed to the other side of the room, were Augusta Longbottom was still chatting the ears off of her parents “Who is that?” she asked. The girl had been excited to spend Christmas with Harry’s family, it was the first time she would be visiting a wizarding household, and had demanded a full tour upon arrival, asking waay too many questions that Harry barely knew how to respond, and almost had to be dragged away from the house elfs. She had been a little surprised when Hagrid arrived, spluttered as Remus came though, and completely inarticulate in the sight of McGonagall – “I didn’t know there would be
“I heard he transferred from Beauxbatons” Hermione said, breaking his trance. “He is in our year, isn’t he?” Ron asked with his mouth full. “Ugh” Hermione grimaced, looking away from Ron “Yes, he is. His name is Draco Malfoy”. Harry turned to face his friends again.
Blaise furrowed his eyebrows “Do you even have the time to do that?”. He knew that his friend had had plenty of fun rounding up the crowd and organizing today’s event – but he had also neglected many of his other obligations to do so.
Harry spun around, dribbling the ball from one foot to the other, managing to get around Daniel, before kicking for the goal, and scoring. He laughed as his friends just grumbled to themselves.
On his way to get a refil of hot chocolate, he got intercepted by Sirius, who wrapped a arm round his shoulders and brought him into a conversation he was having with Hagrid, about a animal that Harry didn’t even want to comprehend.
She calmed herself thinking of her nephew. Just a week ago Narcissa and Lucius came to her, after listening to the prophecy, begging for secrecy. Draco had been premature, for over a month. They didn’t know if that made him fit the criteria of “end of July”, since his actual birth was June 5th, but they didn’t want to find out. The whole family kept their mouths shut about it, and she didn’t regret it one bit.
It was a week after that last lesson, that Draco stopped in front of the door to his father’s study, as it opened up for him, even though no one was inside. He knew instantly that it was dark magic doing that - of the worst kind, the kind that didn’t just want to harm him, but wanted to make him suffer too. He knew he should call his parents, but his occlumency was just so
After talking for a while longer, all the boys were soon in bed, after all, tomorrow was the fist day of school. Draco was looking forward to it.
Blaise didn’t know what had Draco more excited: Cedric’s adoring smile, or the power trip of having his whole house going along with his ideas.
Bellatrix and Narcissa gave him matching wide smiles before stepping further into the backyard. Their heels were close to sinking into the grass, but it wasn’t really a problem, because moments later, they both turned. A hyena for his aunt, and a lioness for his mother.
Lucius let go of Draco and was calling for Nacissa as Rodolphus started casting diagnostic spells on his wife, who was trying “Lumos!” loudly over and over again, tears streaming down her face.
If Lupin was exposed as a werewolf, he wouldn’t just loose his job, but his life would pretty much be over – that’s how drastic the prejudice and discrimination against lycanthropy was. By the end end of the class, Draco was fuming. Severus Snape was a very cruel man.
Luckily, most people were generally impressed at his being so advanced in classes and taking extra lessons in random subjects. Of couse, his family name and reputation always helped to inspire respect and fear. And it was also a advantage that he was getting pretty good looking – for a wonky and skinny thirteen year-old, that is. Overall, he was admired by the Slytherins, and the other Houses reactions varied with the students - some showed fear, others respect. And there were always the defiant ones, that had families personally involved in the War, or that distrusted Slytherins. But the whole House had experience with the last type. It was no biggie.
Harry’s father already knew Ron, having met his family previously, but it was his first time talking to Hermione. He heard she was friends with his son ever since the Troll incident, and seemed eager to finally talk to her, getting a twinkle in his eyes every time she rambled in the tone of voice that always made Ron roll his eyes and mutter under his breath.
“I know” he agreed “But, you know, I’m glad you’re the mature one. I don’t want all that responsibility”
that went to a wizarding school with a wizarding curriculum. They were just going to think that Harry was
“Professor?” Draco opened the door to the astronomy tower slowly “Ah, yes Draco, do come in, I was just getting my divination lessons ready for my next class. Go sit down over there, I’ll be right with you”.
Now, they were all slumped in Oliver’s room, looking over some of his miscellaneous comics while they chatted about their school, updating Harry on the gossip. As they got caught up on the absurdity of a past biology test, Harry disassociated, because is not like he had biology tests in Hogwarts.
The next day, it was Tessa who shook him awake, urging him to go downstairs, so they could start opening the presents already. Harry followed her without complain.
“I’m glad you decided to talk about it Harry” Hermione took his hand “You know that we support you a hundred per cent”
“Familiars are very powerful litt'e things, they have ancient magic, that is. They are very rare this days, is a real honor to mee' this one”.
By Harry’s side, Hermione’s breath hitched and she grabbed his sleeve. Harry followed her eyes to something he hadn’t noticed immediately in the scene before them. Lightly covered by the overall darkness of the hall, between Miles’s and Malfoy’s feet, was a large bundle of clothing. Only it was too large, shaped weirdly. Hermione’s reaction made sense when Harry noticed that
Okay, that was a complete exaggeration. But he recognized that the kid was smart – smart enough to have already figured out about Lupin.
Bellatrix knew it made no sense, there wasn’t such a thing as “stealing” someone’s magic, but tears were still spilling slowly from her eyes and her hands were trembling. She took a deep breath and crouched down to her nephew, as the others watched. “Well, can you give it back to me Draco?”.
Knowing you and your family are the reason why the genocidal maniac that brought on a Wizarding War is dead, is a big piece of information on its own, but realizing the Dark Lord is coming back – that’s another level.
“That’s what I’m saying!” Oliver agreed “I knew Mr. Brown just hated our class”. Harry, exhaled, relieved. But before Oliver could take the sheet of paper out of Harry’s hand to put it back in the drawer, Daniel held it in place, with a weird expression on his face.
And the other thing was, going into the “secrecy” line of questioning was great at keeping Harry from the other path of questions...
“I’m doing better than Harry in the grades department” was Tessa’s amazing contribution, which earned her a kick in the shin. “I've been doing really good on the Quidditch Team, really saved us last game” Harry gave the adults a wide smile, and they promptly changed the topic of conversation, knowing that none of them were ready to have the “what is Quidditch” discussion.
Now, Draco was lighter and more himself, and if the cost of it was a little slaking in a few of his many obligations, then so be it. He was
“Honestly, I though the Black’s were suppose to be proficient in fire magic” he drawled, then started reciting once again.
Draco went along with the subject diversion and quickly processed that Dumbledore knew about Genevieve, although he never told anyone – besides his closest friends and Harry Potter, for some reason – but it wasn’t very difficult to figure out, if one only paid attention. He looked over at the bird, and tried to seem more surprised than he felt – even for a Phoenix, the animal had a very strong magical aura, that was intertwined to Dumbledore’s. Therefore, Draco had already known.
“And then” Flint seemed to have caught on – since that was the part of the plan he liked “We take him out of his room, let him turn, provoque him with some hexes, and let the Wolf loose” he grinned.
As soon as they were dismissed Draco stomped out into the corridor, and Blaise and Pansy scurried after him – with their usual level of decorum, obviously.
“Hey, Nott’s sister was waiting for me after my class, and she is making me go somewhere with her. She’s being really ominous, I’m not sure what to expect but I have a bad feeling about this. Could you get Pansy and maybe just be on the lookout? I’m quite sure this isn’t a sexy adventure she’s taking me on, and I’m too tired for this shit. Thanks.”
Harry felt self conscious without his invisibility cloak, but the Map was enough to make sure they didn’t stumble upon Peeves, who was lurking in one of the staircases, or anyone else.
“Stop it Ron” Hermione huffed “I think it’s sweet” she busied herself with her breakfast as Ron frowned and mumbled to himself.
Lucius was the only one that didn’t seize the moment to send a killing curse to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, that had stood in transfixed horror before the child. No, Lucius was instead freezed in silence, with tears running down his eyes, looking at his son, and feeling all those spaces in his soul that were before occupied by hate, being filled with only love.
When they started marching into the castle to get ready for the Hufflepuff’s victory party, Blaise noticed that Draco hesitated before the entrance, with a bashful smile.
Lucius exhaled and ran one of his hands through his long hair as he sat in a settee. He called an elf for a cup of tea before speaking.
Not that it made any difference to her, because once she met Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, her heart was set. It was difficult at first, with him being older and not really noticing her, but Narcissa was patient and focused, and by the time she was fourteen, they were already exchanging love letters and going on secret dates.
potion. But most people feel panic, fear, despair and deep rooted sadness. It also causes hallucinations, tremors, sensibility to light, pain in the extremities, sweating, shortness of breath, extreme thirst, sensation of chocking... It can also induce suicidal thoughts, if you’re sensitive” he started to fill up the goblet once again.
That was one of the spells Harry practiced during break, and he already could make it physical. When it was time for them to try, Harry focused and pointed his wand to Malfoy, who was waiting patiently “
“I am not!” Draco whined “but- really? This castle is huge, was this really the best place that Salazar Slytherin could find?” Draco was appalled, and soon all the boys were laughing at his antics. Draco didn’t mind – he learned pretty early that he thrived on attention.
was filled with the highest level of concealment charmswork, but today, after weeks of frustration, Rodolphus told him that Lucius gave in and just opened the necklace in a moment of anger, figuring out that it was a fake, and the real
Draco just shook his head sideways, heavy tears making their way through his closed eyes. “Try harder! I know you have it!” she screamed at him, his tiny hands trembling. “Bella-“ Narcissa started before Bellatrix snapped “Shut up already Narcissa!”.
“I had detention with Snape” Harry answered, and waited for Draco’s justification. But guess what? he wasn’t getting it.
After some time, James was ushering the people to the dining room, and Harry ate so much that he thought he might actually pass out. Everyone seemed pleased and excited, conversations flowing freely and laughter resonating in the room. After a couple hours, the adults were growing drunker and drunker - and that only made everything so much better. By the end of the night, Hagrid was snoring loudly in his seat and McGonagall and Augusta were arguing about Quidditch, rather enthusiastically. James, and Lupin were talking excitedly with Hannah’s and Hermione’s parents, while the house elfs tried to swiftly replace some of the half empty glasses of alcohol for water. Sirius was sharing tales of his last travel to a energetic Nymphadora and Ted, while Andromeda would occasionally shake her head disapprovingly. The evening reached an ending when the adults started to notice that the children were starting to fall asleep in their seats.
“Patil can speak for themself, Malfoy,” a husky voice cuts in from behind them. Padma looks… well, older, for one. Harry hasn’t seen her – them; he corrects – since Hogwarts. Their hair is shaved into a buzzcut, and it makes the sharp angles of their jaw stand out.
Harry’s mouth drops open sometime during the rant, and Harry’s oddly thankful to have snarky Malfoy back. Harry clears his throat. He is a
Malfoy’s just admitted to being gay. Or bi. Or whatever. He likes men. He’s attracted to men. Should Harry put a finger down? So Malfoy knows he likes men? But then everyone would know. And Harry definitely has
“So, I went to vet school, and all that, which you obviously know. Okay, but now I’m remembering you stopping by when I first opened the clinic- that happened, right? I didn’t imagine that?”
“Roommates are assigned by gender,” Padma explains. “I’m the only one here with no gender; thus, I have no roommate.”
It’s Tuesday, and Harry stands in front of Malfoy. They both have their arms stretched out in front of them, palms touching.
After lunch, Molly shooed Harry and Malfoy over to the Floo, claiming she had a surprise for them. “All right, boys. I have a friend over by the coast who runs a line of dinner cruises. I thought, what better way to spend the day before your wedding? After all, Harry told us how much you love boats, Draco, and they're such an important part of your engagement!”
Draco flushes. “Go fuck yourself, Potter,” he snaps, even though Potter’s looking like he just killed Draco’s dog and Draco
It’s nearly six in the morning when there’s a soft knock on the door. Harry walks quietly to open it, trying not to wake Ron.
Potter's face had immediately flushed. Insults were hurled. Fists were thrown. The two of them were forcibly removed from the Wizengamot.
Harry looks up at a flash of blond hair as Malfoy takes a seat in the chair next to him. Harry raises a questioning eyebrow.
Harry turns to Malfoy, even though he can’t see anything. “You’re not about to start feeling bad for me, are you? I was just as much of an arsehole to you.”
. About not being confined by the label of a gender. About falling entirely outside of the binary. It feels…
“Anything you think is relevant. The more the better,” Harry replies, offering Malfoy what he hopes is an encouraging smile.
Draco leapt forward and threw his arms around Harry’s neck, and Harry held him tightly. Taking a step back, he grabbed Draco’s face softly with both hands and tilted his own head upwards to kiss him.
Draco looks like he’s got a biting comeback, but he settles with, “Don’t you have money to throw at the
Harry laughs. “No, I’m not you,” he replies. “Although that would make the house less empty, at least. I’m living in the old Black place, I’m not sure if you’ve ever been?”
Harry melted into Draco as their lips met and moved against each other. It was more tender than their first kiss; it was longer, warmer, deeper; it was infinitely better now that he knew Draco, now that they knew
Harry hears a foot tapping, and then, “Looks like we have a free spot. Please take a seat. Dr. Potter will be with you shortly.”
, Potter,” Draco spat, anger coming back in force. “But not everyone has the luxury of staying morally incorrupt. I don’t
“Right. Well, they hired me a tutor for the years before Hogwarts and then sent me off. Not too directly involved, which is pretty typical of purebloods.” Malfoy turns up his nose at the word. “What about you then, I suppose your – how did your aunt and uncle contribute to your education?”
Harry’s awake. Ron had stumbled into bed around three, and Harry had pretended to be asleep. He still is. He wishes he could go out to the common room and talk with Draco for the rest of the night but Draco hadn’t been there a single night this week and he certainly wouldn’t be there now, not after Harry had kissed him. His cheek. But still. It was mortifying. And Harry’s gotten to know Draco well enough the past few months to know that he won’t make fun of him for it, or gossip about it, but Harry’s still gone and ruined their friendship.
. It’s a dick move. And you know it.” Harry could feel his face reddening as Draco just stared at him.
They’ve been dating for four months when Harry suggests he move in. And it’s soon, but it doesn’t really feel like moving fast, it just feels like it’s time. Draco agrees.
Harry turns to Dave, who’s gesturing for Harry to come in the back with him. Harry follows, and they walk to where Malfoy can’t hear them.
“Rooming alone is a blessing, thank you for asking,” they reply. “No snoring, no awkward small talk, no sharing a bathroom.”
“You’re not allergic to anything, at least that I know of. Pet peeves... people who assume they know you. Slow talkers. People who use your name to get things.” Malfoy grinned tentatively.
“Any hint of pureblood, bigoted bullshit, especially to the Weasleys, I turn you right in to the Aurors,” Potter warned when he reached Draco.
The Wizengamot had started with the worst of the Death Eaters right after the war, including his father, who they sent immediately to Azkaban. His mother’s trial had been just last month, and after a moving testimony from Potter, of all people, she walked free. Well, she was on probation for three years and had to stay within a few kilometres of the Manor during that time, but she was safe from Azkaban.
Last week, a team had finished up a case on a string of burglaries in Diagon Alley. The paperwork was straightforward enough, and Harry had nearly finished with it when Matian Gilbertson walked into the conference room.
a sign on the door reads) and Harry is all too conscious of the silly snake signs and puns placed around the halls and in the room. He’s blushing a bit as he gestures towards the exam table.
Potter laughed again, and the tension in the room eased. “The metaphorical closet existed separately from the cupboard, which was quite real.”
“Do you want… if you want, I could use he and they pronouns for you. Interchangeably. To see if you like that.”
In the end, Draco gets a blanket, tucks Potter in on the floor, and heads back to his room, wondering when he had started caring about Harry Fucking Potter.
“Are you going to tell me what’s wrong with Eleanor?” Harry continues, before Malfoy can ask him any more questions on snake gossip culture.
Harry doesn’t wait for him to finish. He grabs Draco’s hair and pulls him in and kisses him, and Draco grabs Harry right back, nestling one hand in the back of Harry’s shirt and the other around his neck. The kiss is warm, and sweet, until Draco
Betsy, the purple-haired woman in charge, lectures for most of the day. They stop for a lunch break only to continue with more presentations and lectures. Harry’s eyes are drained from staring at the screen for so long. After the participants are given dinner, Harry and Malfoy return to their room.
“A rather traumatic experience for Professor Sprout, I’m afraid.” Harry tries to shrug casually, but he’s still mortified. Draco bursts out laughing.
“Yes, it’ll be very nice.” Harry smiled, then shoved some more food in his mouth. Malfoy did the same next to him.
“That’s right, I forgot how much you hate workplace canoodling,” Draco smirks. “Our first snog definitely wasn’t in your office. And you weren’t fired for shagging on the job at Hogwarts-”
“Yes, Harry,” Hermione answers softly. “Although, if we’re being honest, it was probably before then.”
. You were at each other’s necks every goddamn second during school. I don’t want to have to deal with your bickering. McGonagall thinks she’s going to fix all your problems by forcing you to be together, but she forgot that she’s also forcing
Draco bites his lip, considering. “Dave,” he replies. Harry laughs. They bring Dave up to be with the other snakes, and he seems much more comfortable around them.
That evening, Harry’s the one who starts the conversation. In the darkness, the words naturally tumble out. "What does it mean to have no gender?"
“Oh, she’s fine,” Draco replies. “I just thought you might want to take a look at her magic, like you did the others. And no,” he smirks. “You haven’t seen
“Fine,” Draco replies, cooly, but his smile is as bright as ever. “I suppose that would be alright.”
And it’s… Harry had guessed at something like that. But to hear Malfoy talk about all these options, lay them out there, it’s almost too much for him to hear. Harry clears his throat. “Right. That helps. Thank you.”
“That’s good,” Malfoy replies, a hint of caution in his voice. “And if you’re not completely sure, that’s okay too.”
Harry James Potter is not without his flaws. High among these flaws, if you happened to ask him, is his inability to let go of things that bother him.
“Please just leave me alone. I’m not in the mood.” Potter’s voice is oddly strained and quiet, and Draco knows immediately that something is off. Without really knowing why, Draco starts walking over towards him and sits next to Potter on the floor.
"Everyone is welcome to stop by and say hi, even if you don't necessarily need any sessions. I'm here for you guys as a resource and a friend. That being said…." he turns to McGonagall, who nods. "We'll be starting some new initiatives this year. Mainly, inter-house cooperation, resocialization, and just general good times. We'll be starting bi-weekly socials, where everyone can get together and enjoy Hogwarts and each other's company." Draco rolls his eyes. "Oh, and these are mandatory. Let’s have a great school year!" The Healer lifts an arm in a wave and hurries back to his seat. Draco blinks. There's some applause, but most of the students seem equally stunned that they'll be forced into inter-house social events. Draco chances a glance at Potter, whose mouth is hanging open.
!” Harry exclaims. “See, you get it. I told Ron and Hermione last night, and they said congrats and all that, but they didn’t really
“Sorry, I – thought maybe it made sense to leave the bed how it’s supposed to be?” His cheeks redden even more. “I mean to say, all of the other teachers are dealing with the sleeping situation, and we don’t know what using Transfiguration every night could be doing to the integrity of the–”
They unpack, then head together in silence to the ballroom on the ground floor where the conference is set to take place.
“Explain yourself, Malfoy.” Potter’s voice was terse, demanding. Draco wondered, not for the first time, how such a short, skinny person could be so imposing.
Malfoy met his eyes, sitting up in his chair and sticking up his nose. “Nevermind, Potter. It’s none of your business.”
Neville, Dean, and Seamus are already seated when they arrive, but students from the other houses slowly trickle in. Hannah Abbott. Ernie MacMillan. Anthony Goldstein. Malfoy slips in last, along with Pansy Parkinson, Goyle, and Blaise Zabini. Every eighth year is at the table, but instead of mixing in like they’re supposed to, they’ve grouped themselves by house.  Everyone seems to feel just as awkward as Harry to be all together, even if they are still next to their own houses. Harry wonders if Vince is going to make them change seats, but then the first activity is announced and they all have to get up anyways.
“No. I’m telling you. We’re telling you. We know you’re moping about because of the kiss with Malfoy.”
Draco follows Potter to the chaise lounge chairs towards the east side of the Great Hall. There’s a good amount of seating and most of it is already taken by couples. Potter grabs one of the larger ones and drags it away from the others, then sits down. He pats the seat next to him and Draco decides that sitting is probably harmless.
Malfoy just gave a polite nod, looking somehow even paler than before. He took a seat at the table, and Harry followed.
“I wasn’t implying we were friends.” Draco let out an exasperated sigh. “I’m just saying, I had no one to ask, and given your tendency towards a hero complex, I thought you might help me. And besides, you really think they’re going to mess with their Saviour? You have far too much power for them to send your fiancé away.”
"The past year has likely been extremely traumatic for most of you," she’s saying. "We considered taking a year off of education but we understand that Hogwarts is home for many of you, and the only way to move forward is to, well, move forward.
the Slytherin thing is the lie," Malfoy drawls, finally participating. "At least give us a challenge."
“Molly told him great things,” Malfoy said quietly, ignoring Harry’s comment. “Why would she do that?”
Kissing Harry Potter was… not what Draco would have expected. His lips were soft and gentle, and Draco couldn’t help but lean in further. He would have expected rough lips, and anger, but this was almost tender. Almost sweet.
Potter didn’t really mean it, he testified at Draco’s trial for Merlin’s sake, but it still stings to hear the words. To be reminded.
“No, I hadn’t seen her again until Friday. But I Owled her a thank you note after I finished reading them.”
Malfoy was still looking out at the sunset. With the golden sky highlighting his pale features, he looked… beautiful. “Can’t we stay just a little longer?” Malfoy asked.
Draco’s mind flashed back to every time he’d said something cruel to Potter about those Muggles, and he felt sick to his stomach. “I’m sorry.”
“Thanks, Harry,” Ron says breathlessly, following Harry into the kitchen. “Remember when she first started walking? That was a good pace. Quality stuff right there. I think she must be using magic to run so fast, there’s no way a Muggle toddler could run that fast, right? She’s only two!”
