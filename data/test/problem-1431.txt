They were gone with a
"Yeah."
After a few seconds, Potter relaxed, and the grip he had on Draco’s hand loosened considerably. Dinner plates were cleared as everyone finished and Molly returned from the kitchen, her hands full.
The scarf clenched in his hand dropped to the floor without ceremony. Potter's voice was husky as he whispered, "I do."
Harry drinks him in, standing naked with his clothes huddled in a ball in front of him like a shield, his eyes so stormy and yearning.
"I thought the Council was headed by a quorum? How can he be their leader? And why was he so insistent? And why don't you like him?" Draco's mouth ran away with him, spouting off the rapid fire questions with barely a breath in between.
Draco huffed, tired and filthy, and not overly keen on Snape's condescending tone. "Or what, you'll take House points? I wasn't aware my clothing affected the outcome of my grade."
“Terms?” he said, his voice peaking with amused interest. “There was nothing mentioned of terms when the Ministry shoved me into Azkaban to starve to death.”
Narcissa waves a hand. "Draco's always had a hard time not taking himself too seriously. He's much better than he used to be." Her eyes glint in the streams of sunlight cascading in through the windows. "He interests you," she says. "Draco."
Draco snorts. "At least until Longbottom gets here."
Ron became considerably more animated, fueled by his glee at divulging the tale. “It’s like this—Mum was all in a tizzy about you and Draco, Merlin that feels weird to say, coming to dinner. She was at sixes and sevens, rushing us all about to make things perfect. And Ginny huffed and snarked off, saying how she couldn’t believe we were all putting ourselves out for a Malfoy.” He looked a little sheepish as he continued, “Mate, I tell you, she said some nasty things about the both of you, and went on about you flaunting your fangs and that this thing between you and him was disgusting and unnatural, and that we were all terrible for going along with it and not trying to make you see sense.” Ron paused for a breath. “Anyway, Mum started yelling that Ginny needed to shut it, and that we wanted to do this for you, that we were family, and family supports each other. Well, then Ginny shoots her mouth off and said the only way you would be family was if you had married her.”
"I—I suppose I've overstayed my welcome here."
Silvestri coughed beneath him. "You know you can't kill me like this," he croaked.
Draco's head snaps up and a tiny gasp escapes him. "I—I did as you asked."
Snape inclined his head to the closed door. "Draco. What you're doing to Draco."
Harry drops to his knees and shoves his face in Draco's arse without ceremony, licking upward from his balls in one long, wet stripe.
Draco tsked. "I wouldn't call you swotty."
Draco's eyes are like pools of molten silver. He is relaxed, unguarded, and completely at ease. He's telling the truth. It takes Harry's breath away.
Potter didn't seem concerned at all, if anything it spurred him on, drawing out sharp gasps and growls as he sucked Draco off. The pads of Potter's fingers pulled him closer, sending him deeper into Potter's throat, urging him to move his hips.
Her eyes fluttered to the hand at her shoulder, and she waved it carelessly as if she had forgotten its existence. “Oh, yes. Ron and I married last year.”
"Master Harry! Master Harry!" she huffs breathlessly, "There is being a Weasley Auror—"
"I suppose I shouldn't tease him."
Ron’s eyes asked him to answer his own question. And the answer was yes.
At the first press of his tongue, she opens, because she has no choice but to let him in. He plunders, takes, demands. But at the same time, he's giving, sharing, and offering. His hands come up to tangle in her hair, and she clutches at him for support. She could kiss him like this for days, for years, forever.
Harry has to bite back a groan because that right there is undeniable proof of the truth to Draco's words. He wants this. He wants Harry. He's ready for Harry to take control. To make him feel alive, to give him pleasure. To make him come undone.
"Well, you're not going to tell her, are you?" Ron looks deeply concerned. He should be.
The tension Harry expects at dinner is unsurprisingly present. However, it seems to be centered at Malfoy's end of the table. In fact, Harry's enjoying a perfectly lovely conversation with Narcissa at the other end about her Trilling Roses, while Draco's poking around at his trifle like it's insulted him personally.
Draco's head lolls forward as he gasps for breath, and Harry continues his path, finally reaching that hollow of ankle that tempted him before. He noses around the restraint to lick up underneath it, and takes a moment to catch his own breath.
Draco cried out as he came, a guttural sound laced with angst and release. He knew it would always be like this, charged and blinding, but there was too much else that he couldn't overlook.
"He never mentioned it to me."
Draco's head falls back, and Harry squeezes to regain his attention.
The handshake was perfunctory. “Bill Weasley.”
"I want to know that you're in my room, my space, my shower, smelling like me, fucking into your fist, gasping for me. I want you to make yourself come for me, and then I want you to wear something from my closet and come down for breakfast. Am I clear?"
Harry covers her hand with his and smiles. "Yes, ma'am."
Malfoy looks only slightly chastised as he shoots Harry a glare and huffs off to plop in a chair near the fireplace, bare feet stomping the whole way.
"We just want what's best for you," Hermione pipes in.
Harry takes a tentative sip from his teacup, deciding how to explain the situation, especially since he's not really sure himself what happened. "I don't know," he says with a rueful, but respectful smile. After all, he did end up arse over tit on her sitting room rug. "Nothing like this has ever happened to me, but honestly, I can't be surprised by all the strange things that happen to me anymore."
He shoves his fingers further into his arse, pistoning his hips back and forth in time with the pump of his fist. The sensation is incredible, and his mouth falls open on a guttural moan that sweeps up from his toes. His eyes slam shut because he can't bear to look at himself, instead choosing to put Harry's face at the forefront of his mind. He focuses on Harry's eyes, looking at him with such wicked intent. He hears the sound of his voice, urging him onward in raspy, throaty encouragement. Draco shuffles forward and braces his knee on the seat and crouches forward for a better angle. The change is instantaneous.
Harry breaks off the kiss and turns Draco around. "Go sit on the sofa. Get comfortable. And spread those legs."
"You're ready now, then? Three months of counseling to erase both our pain?" Draco knew his voice sounded pinched and whiny, but he didn't care.
Draco stopped short and turned to face him. "When? I mean, I know you've been inside the Manor, but the rest of the grounds?"
He smirks and chuckles. "I asked if you were alright. You went somewhere for a moment. I admit, seeing Longbottom was a shock for me, I mean, when did he get so fit? But you, you've seen him recently. Or were your thoughts elsewhere?" He says it like he knows what Harry was thinking, and maybe he does.
Hermione opened the door to the cell and stepped inside, keeping her back to the door as she closed it. Despite her feelings to the contrary, Harry was still dangerous. And not sleeping as his back to the door would imply.
A begrudging noise that sounds like 'fine' comes out of Ron's mouth.
“Not until you leave the room. You’ve annoyed me, so now I plan on denying you the sight of my glorious nakedness. A worthy and just punishment.”
Draco Apparated away a second later with the echo of Potter shouting his name ringing in his ears.
, pulling Draco down to straddle him on the sofa.
“A touch queasy. I haven’t Apparated in quite some time. Wasn’t expecting that,” he confessed on a gasp, taking a deep, cleansing breath. He straightened and took a good look around. “Is this Grimmauld Place? I haven’t been here in ages.”
Narcissa sips her tea and dabs at her mouth with her napkin before addressing him. "I trust your quarters are acceptable?"
He moved so fast, lightning quick, to grab her wrist and hold it tight. Harry’s eyes stared her down, and she felt herself fall underneath the deep, green gaze. “I could take you now,” he said softly, squeezing tighter. “I could drag you across this table before you could even think about reaching for your wand.” Her breath stuttered against the coldness of his grip, and she was lost inside the endless sea of his gaze. “I could take you to the floor, press my fangs against your neck and bleed you dry before anyone could save you. I could kill you in the space of a heartbeat for no other reason than I am hungry and you are here.” His head tilted to the side as his smile mocked her. “Is that the man you want to help?”
Draco shudders as Harry lets his fingers trail over the warm skin. He kneads against Draco's arse cheeks, and one of his thumbs dips in to brush lightly over the hole. Draco moans.
This time, Draco barked out a sharp laugh. "The thrall? This from a man who can throw off an Imperius and defeat the most powerful Dark wizard of our time with a disarming spell? You think I'm going to believe that you can't shrug off the attempted thrall of a two-knut rogue vampire?" He laughed even harder, shaking his head in disbelief. "That's rich, Potter. No, I think when you came upon that vampire it was the answer to your prayers. Because I think your friends all knew you had a death wish, and if you died in service, you knew that they would always wonder, and that would be more guilt for you to take to the grave. But murdered by a vampire in the middle of an escape? It's tragic, and unlucky, and utterly exculpating. How fortuitous."
Draco's eyes grow wide. "You mean—?"
Harry spears at his eggs. "'Fraid not."
It takes Harry's brain a few seconds to process the implication of those three little words, but when it does, Harry grabs Draco by the face and
Harry makes a concerted effort to catch Draco's gaze every so often through the meal, catch it and hold it warmly. It's genuine on his part, partly because Draco is just so lovely to look at, and partly to make his point. The façade drops once or twice, but Draco's been trained to conceal his true emotions since he was born. He crumples under extreme stress, as attested by the war, but this—this is more of a political arena. The sort of thing Draco's used to. Managing himself in the cold face of others, calculating someone's true agenda, while hiding his own. Harry kind of wants to shake him and tell him that this is personal; it's not politics. He's not trying to committee Draco into his bed.
He's gotten back into painting, and reached out to Luna at the prospect of opening a gallery in Hogsmeade. She readily agreed, and even made a trip over to the Manor to see Harry's studio and catch up. Luna's wise and accepting soul worked its magic on both Malfoys, and soon they took tea in the solarium as if nothing had ever happened. The Manor itself was pleased beyond measure at her forgiveness, thrumming happily as Harry and Draco gave her a proper tour. Now that he's sent Pennywort back with the signed contract, it wouldn't be long before their venture would come to fruition.
It’s the worst case of bad monologuing he’s been witness to in quite some time. But Gilles will not go gentle into that good night without a final grand gesture of wounded pride. A single, solitary, honest-to-fucking-Merlin tear rolls down his alabaster cheek while a pained, broken sob professes that he thought Draco loved him.
Draco sniffed in defiance. "Well, I have been making an effort. Arthur's been downright fatherly to me, and it seems only fitting to assist him in his endeavours, no matter how strange they are. Do you know how hard it is to keep a straight and interested face while he goes on and on about 'pistons' and 'cam shafts'? It's almost obscene."
"Yes?" Harry frowned, determined not to be guilted into coming to the Burrow. He said as much to Draco before he left, not that Draco had responded.
“Going to look in my mouth next? Check my teeth?” Draco spat, giving voice to his irritation. “I can assure you Azkaban has kept me at least healthy enough to sustain you.”
Harry grunted and mouthed against the newly-exposed patch of skin, alternating the rub of his lips with the scrape of his fangs. “I swear, Malfoy, you’ll be the death of me.”
Potter’s eyes drifted from his chest to the Dark Mark. “They suit you.”
The plates on the tea cart rattle with a surge of Harry's irritated magic as Malfoy's mother snaps, "Draco! That was uncalled for!"
“If he decides he wants to see us.” The hurt was evident, not just in her words, but the slight pinch to her face. She rose to her feet gracefully and smiled up at him. “It’s been a while, and I don’t think we all quite know each other anymore. Perhaps we should reacquaint ourselves?” Granger offered her hand. “I don’t think we’ve been introduced. Hermione Granger-Weasley, brightest witch of her age.”
Harry shakes his head. "You didn't let me finish, Draco."
He tastes salty and sweet all at once, and it's an addictive combination that stirs an awakening in Harry's groin. Draco groans and tilts his head to the side, elongating that beautiful neck, giving Harry access to worry his teeth along the slope.
For some reason his eyes glance back to the enormous bed.
Potter groaned and the kiss quickly turned heated, and Draco found himself being unceremoniously pressed down into the sofa cushions. Draco pushed at Potter, turning his head to the side, breaking the kiss. "As much as I would love to continue," he gasped, "I think you should take me home and shag me properly, in a bed, as I have no intention of being buggered on Weasley upholstery."
Potter smiled in a half-hearted fashion, and his arm curled into Draco's as he urged them to begin moving. "It's true I hated your father," he started, "but he was more than just a Death Eater, no matter how the Ministry felt. He was a husband, and a father, and he left behind people who loved him despite his terrible actions. That deserved a modicum of respect in my book."
Malfoy actually steps back this time, putting distance between them. His face shutters closed. "Well, Switzerland left me rather cold. I don't suppose England will be much better."
Harry roared, his magic surrounding her to lift her from the floor and throw her out the open door. Valeria whooshed out the doorway with a shout of protest, arms and legs flailing against the power of Harry's magic. The door slammed shut and the wards strengthened. Her presence no longer irritated them. She was gone.
Draco sits back and inhales a cleansing breath before downing a gulp of water. "That's not what—I didn't—oh, bugger off, Potter." He shakes off Harry's touch with a violent shudder.
"Wouldn't dream of it."
"I refused to help him otherwise." Severus' chin was set at a haughty angle. "My first concern was your well-being. You've always been like a son to me, and if Potter was mistreating you, I wasn't going to stand for it."
“Oh, right. Yeah…here,” Potter said quickly, waving a hand in front of the portrait. His eyes narrowed on her and he warned, “Be nice, Walburga.” She cast a nervous glance at Potter before looking back to Draco.
He is Harry's.
“Silvestri,” Potter warned. “Go back to your coven. By my good graces, I allowed you to come in and have your say, but I am no longer feeling hospitable.”
From the other end of the table, Malfoy shoots up straight in his chair. "Longbottom? Are you serious, Potter?"
"You mentioned that you do not like humiliation. Neither do I, so be assured that is something that I will not pursue. How are you with pain?"
OOOOO
She lets out an indignant squawk and is gone.
Draco shoved his hands in the mess of Potter's hair, delighting in the silkiness of the perpetually disheveled locks, fingers curling as though his skin might absorb the texture to memory. Potter moved them in the direction of the bed, Draco guessed, but he couldn't be bothered to open his eyes and check. There was a scrape of fangs just below his ear, and the dart of a slick tongue that licked over the little hollow there, and really, nothing else seemed to matter. Potter could have been turning them in circles, and Draco would have been content to revolve forever.
Draco's fingers curled around the letter as he sighed, and it hit Snape that Draco had only entered the room looking for Potter.
"Do—do you like it?"
George’s fists clenched by his side, and Draco swore he heard Potter growl from his right. But he spared no glance, keeping his attention on George.
Draco’s hands shot up to grab Potter’s shirt and shove him back against the wall. “Listen to me,” he snarled. “I don’t give a bloody fuck what you want. This is not just about you. I have bound myself to you, and I don’t care if you don’t want it or don’t like it, but you will fucking take it.” Potter went still underneath him, and Draco knew it was only a matter of time before Potter shoved him off, or threw him across the room. But his pride and his fear were bubbling up from his toes, and fuck if he was going to let Potter and his whiny petulance stand between him and freedom. “You can brood and bitch all you want, I don’t give a shit. But you will do this so I can get out of here.” He brought his right arm up and shoved his wrist into Potter’s face, forcing it into his mouth. “For fuck’s sake, Potter,
“It’s Granger-Weasley, now. She’d have Kneazles if she heard you.”
"No," Potter growled. "Leave it."
Ron exhaled sharply with surprise. "Merlin, Harry—"
Draco blinks, startled. "I—I never—"
"Potter!" Draco cried, fisting his hands into the sheets. Potter's chuckle rumbled against his skin as his tongue circled Draco's hole. Potter's fangs scraped over the sensitive flesh, sending ripples of super-heated pleasure through body. His cock hardened even more, the tip dipping down to drag over the cotton sheet, leaving a thin, wet trail behind. Potter's tongue stabbed at him, wriggling and working its way inside, forcing sounds out of his throat he'd never thought possible.
Draco's fingers curled into the skin of his thighs, the sting amplifying the glorious sensation around his cock. Want pooled into the dark, empty space where Harry knew his soul should be, and he swallowed against the hollow pleasure even as his traitorous body grabbed for more. Dexterous fingers brushed just behind his balls and pressed with knowing force. Harry threw his head back and came on a rush of sound, emitting a half-gasped, half-choked benediction that sounded exactly like
Draco watched with clear, focused eyes as Harry and Silvestri collided in midair. They fell to the ground with a thud and sprang apart, circling warily, wandlessly casting and deflecting a number of curses. He shifted within the confines of his barrier, able to move only a fraction. Draco frowned. He was well and truly corralled; there was no way he could get out to help Potter.
Studio is an understatement, as are most things when it comes to Malfoy. The ballroom-sized space is open and airy, with bright white walls that extend upwards to what has to be a twenty or twenty-five foot ceiling. The wall directly opposite the door has to be some thirty feet across, and floor to ceiling windows are reflecting the outside winter landscape. It's gone half-nine in the evening, but those windows are letting in early morning sunshine.
. If purpose was an illusion he once sought, it coalesced here and now, under Potter’s sinful mouth and hands, beating out a staccato syncopation of
Those soft words of permission have Draco at the cabinet in a flash, his eyes roving over every piece in detail. In the end, he chooses a thin leather crop and a green silk blindfold. Harry stays silent as Draco turns back around and moves forward. He kneels at Harry's feet and bows his head, raising his hands to present the items for inspection.
The promise in this one simple act has Harry's blood singing.
"I—I don't know," she says. "Why do you ask?"
"Let's find out what's crawling around inside of you, eh?" Potter's voice was dark, so dark, and it sent a shiver of fear over Draco's skin.
Draco's brows knitted in confusion. "You're seeing a mind healer?"
"Yes—" Draco huffs. "Yes, Sir."
Harry’s face drew tight. “I’m not the same as I was. You know that.”
Harry closes the distance between them until the scent of citrus and sweat bleeds into his nostrils. He leans over, putting his mouth precariously close to Draco's ear. "All you ever have to do is ask. Remember that,
It was wrapped up tight in the perfection of his mouth, lips shiny and red like a Christmas ribbon. Wrapped securely in the warmth of his breath, the swirl of his tongue. Tucking in at the corners, perfectly creased paper, daring him to peek at the treasure inside. A gift begging to be opened.
Harry couldn’t hold back the snort. “Peachy.”
Draco looked at Potter, unable to move as Potter plucked the ring from the box and slid it on Draco's left hand.
The guard outside Potter’s cell gave him a derisive once over before stepping aside. Draco ignored the slight and went in without hesitation.
Again, his tone is modulated, and the restraint it shows is admirable. He's doing beautifully.
“She had asked Harry if it was alright if she stopped by,” Molly continued. “When Harry told me, I owled her right away and invited her to tea at the Burrow.” She paused to smile fondly. “Imagine my surprise when she accepted.”
Strong arms wrapped around him and Draco felt the familiar pull of Apparition.
Potter nodded. "I know. It took me a fair few tantrums and quite a bit of alcohol to realize that. That you were right about me. About everything. It was," he paused, "a distasteful realization." He sucked in a breath and ran his hands along denim-covered thighs. "I didn't want to feel that anymore." He pursed his lips. "I'm seeing someone."
A sly smile worked across her face as Hermione tilted her head. "Well…it's not just your new business endeavor we're celebrating."
Lucius Malfoy blinks calmly at her from his wingback chair. The gilded portrait frame glows in the warm light of the room.
Harry’s body felt colder than normal, thinking about what sort of life Draco would have been subjected to if he hadn’t signed that damn contract. Maybe he had saved Draco. Maybe he hadn’t, and Draco was just moving from one prison to another.
Draco stood outside the door of the one place in this world he never thought he would seek solace. He felt the ripple of magic as the wards touted his presence, and it was a second or two before a soft light glowed in the front window and the door opened.
Harry breathes in scent of Draco's cologne and feels the softness of his hair against his lips as he leans in to rumble in Draco's ear, "Open the door, Draco, and let's find out."
“What?”
Draco headed to the kitchen and found his plate under a warming charm. He rummaged through the cabinets to find a glass and filled it with water from the tap. Potter made no effort to point out were things were, so he rifled through the drawers for some cutlery and then took his plate and glass to the table. He pulled out the chair to sit, wincing as the legs made a loud, scraping noise.
Draco sagged against the wall to slide down to the floor as his legs gave way. The spray turned icy, but he was unable to move, except to bring trembling fingers to press against his bruised mouth.
Harry sighs and nudges at him with a foot. "Do you want it to happen again? Both of you? And what about Pansy? How did you leave things?"
"Oh, God—I'm s—sorry," he stammers. "You didn't tell—"
"What?" Malfoy turns back to face him with tired eyes.
, his brain supplies.
“Merlin,” Harry rasped. “You think it will always be like this?”
By the time Harry maneuvers him through the door, the shower is already running and steamy. Harry shakes his head and lets out a muted chuckle.
Lucius's adjoining suite is the same as he left it, only now the furnishings are covered in muslin. A fine layer of dust coats everything; it is the one room in the Manor that the house-elves are not allowed to enter. She turns her gaze above the fireplace and comes forward. Her hand trembles for only a second before she reaches for the edge of the fabric and pulls.
"I was low, lower than I have ever been, even after the war, when I came back. My head was in all sorts of places, and I admit to…unhealthy ways of coping."
Hermione snorted. “Please. I don’t care what you get up to with him in the bedroom, if you’re doing that as you’re not-so-subtly implying. Just do it where only you can and he can see. Make it something you share between the two of you instead of something that flaunts your carelessness of him to the rest of us.”
A year after that Draco sits at an upscale pub table across from his latest paramour, a stunningly gorgeous French transplant named Gilles, who is currently downing four galleon glasses of prosecco without batting an eyelash. This is his longest relationship by far (six months), and frankly it’s beginning to lose its luster.
Harry swivels on his stool to face him. "That's ominous. Girl trouble?"
Draco rose from the sofa, a slow, calculated unfurling, and drew himself up to full height. "Yes. She was here. She brought paperwork from the Ministry for me to sign."
He took a second to compose himself and made sure his face showed nothing other than mild annoyance as he descended.
Draco relaxed and Potter shifted to get comfortable, rustling and wiggling like an animal burrowing in its nest. A knee thrust its way between Draco’s thighs, and Potter’s leg wound around his ankles, hooking them together from head to toe. Warm breath fluttered over his ear, and the sharp rise and fall of Potter’s breathing had evened out. Potter murmured, so soft he almost missed it.
Time stopped as Draco stared at the little box, knowing instantly what was inside. Potter flipped the lid and the ring winked back at Draco, the single, flawless emerald in the center of the platinum band sparkling like the hope in Potter's eyes.
"Don't let it close you off. Don't let one bad apple put you off fruit entirely." Renault smiles with cheek. "The world is your orchard, Draco Malfoy. And I know how much you love apples."
that had him on the razor’s edge. It was the guillotine and the gallows all rolled into one, and Draco was ready to bare his neck and swing from the rafters to chase it into oblivion.
"Thank you, Blinky. Show him in here, please. And you look positively radiant today, I might say."
Harry rests his hands on his knees as Draco begins a slow, pacing circle about the room. "If that's what you need, then yes."
“And you can live with that, can you?” The bitter edge to his voice made her frown.
The frisson of magic he feels as a result is tinged with smug amusement, but underneath there's a heavy portent of divination. As a man who is intimately acquainted with the trappings of prophecy, it's something he knows he can't ignore. But he's done with manipulation on all fronts, no matter the source, no matter the intent.
Blinky bows her head. "Right aways, Miss Cissa."
"Us?" Harry asks lightly.
He paused at the landing as the conversation began to come into focus.
Ron, Hermione, and Pansy take their leave, and Harry notices that Narcissa and Neville are nowhere in sight, leaving him alone with Draco.
Ron rolled his eyes. “It’s the Ferret. Of course I had an issue. Probably will still have a few more in the future. Wouldn’t be us if we didn’t.”
They landed at Grimmauld and Harry instantly pushed Draco back a step, dragging his hands all over Draco's body, interrogating him with rapid-fire questions.
They were cemented together from mouth to groin, and Draco rubbed his lips across Potter’s with a precision designed to destroy. Potter’s tongue met his with equal fervor, seeking and tasting, mapping out every crevice it could reach. Draco sucked in a breath as his tongue slid along the underside of Potter’s lip, grazing across the tip of one pointed fang. Potter shuddered, and clutched at him for more, but he ended it with a hard, deliberate press of closed mouths. As he pulled back, Potter whimpered and leaned forward, chasing after Draco’s mouth.
"Now, do you have a safeword?"
"How do you explain the vampire?" Ice dripped from Potter's tone. "I couldn't have known about the vampire."
Draco woke to the sound of screaming. He bolted out of bed and into the hallway, straight to Potter’s door. He barreled inside, the anguished sounds louder than thunder. His eyes took a second to adjust to the darkness, and Potter was there on the bed, tangled in the sheets, flailing and twisting, as if caught in a Cruciatus.
Draco shook his head. "It is what it is," he replied softly. "And that's all it's going to be. Potter's made it quite clear how he feels. I know my place." Draco's brows knit together and he tilted his head in deference. "Draco is being serving Master Potter."
It was sometime later that he awoke to the tingle of the wards he'd placed outside his room. Draco lifted his head from the pillow and pointed his wand at the door. The door rippled and melted away, allowing Draco to see the other side. Potter lay curled up on his side, almost in the door frame, his fingers making absent trails against the grain of the floor. After an hour, Potter still hadn't moved, and Draco went back to sleep.
“Can he get it back?”
"Why-why are we here?" Draco's voice trembled.
"Ah, I see." He says it like he knows something she doesn't. And he might, given that he knows Harry so well. "But you believe they will be soon, yes? I can hear it in your tone," he teases. "Mother's intuition?"
It hits him hard, like a live wire sparking at contact, and his body jerks as he comes down Draco's throat. As orgasms go, there is no anticipation, no build-up, just the sheer, raw strike of pleasure searing through him like a match thrown into a lake of kerosene. Draco swallows and tongues at him a few more times before collapsing. His head rests on Harry's thigh, and Harry's fingers unfurl to rake through his hair in a tender caress.
Despite the outward appearance of obedience, Harry knows Draco is tweaked about the whole situation. He thinks it goes deeper than Draco just being a cheeky sub, especially since whatever they are to each other has yet to take shape. He's not coy, not aloof, not trying to draw Harry's attention in that way. It's not about balking against the Dom/sub dynamic. Harry doesn't even think it's about him, per se, but more about Draco's acceptance of himself. And their conversation earlier makes it perfectly clear to Harry that Draco doesn't know who or what he is, so he's relying on the self-preservation tactics he's used in the past.
Which, in and of itself, can be charming…to a point. Draco’s always fancied himself a bit of an aggressor when it comes to sex, but he’s generally topping from the bottom, so to speak. He sort of misses being pursued, being more demanding in his pleasure, and a partner who is a little more fluid in their sexual dynamic. Gilles wants to be pampered, and it’s become obvious that he relies on exceptional fellatio to get it. He can’t deny that Gilles is lovely and delicate, with a softness that beckons to be ruined. It’s been no hardship to worship his lithe body among silken sheets and candlelight, but the man’s personality simply doesn’t deserve it.
What can only be described as a shriek of indignation passes through Gilles’ plush, glittery-gloss covered lips. A shocked hand covers his heart as he bursts up from his seat, ensuring that all eyes in the quiet pub are now fixed on the spectacle that is about to occur. Gilles’ righteous outrage knows no bounds, because apparently no topic is off limit. Draco (and the entire pub at large) is treated to a running commentary of each of his flaws. He is aware of most of them, Draco knows he isn’t perfect (has never claimed to be, for that matter), but some of what spills from those cock-sucking lips is just ridiculous. Dramatic arms flail about, and Gilles’ voice rises in pitch with all the panache of bad Shakespeare as he proclaims that Draco is cruel (again, not intentionally), selfish (he absolutely is), a cheat (he absolutely isn’t), a liar and scoundrel (sometimes and reformed, respectively), shallow (yes), heartless (occasionally), and a terrible fuck with a tiny cock who couldn’t satisfy a man if his life depended on it.
Potter’s eyes darkened, and for a second, Draco thought he’d made a calculated error. But Potter brought their faces together, lips so close they almost touched, and his fingers came up to brush the back of his cheek. “Oh, Draco,” he murmured, and damn if Draco didn’t have to bite his lip to keep from shivering. “I think we both know I could have you anywhere I wanted to. Walburga be damned.” This time he did shiver, but not because of Potter’s proximity. But because Draco knew Potter was right. Potter turned him around and pushed him toward the door as Draco’s breath caught in his throat. “Go on, now. I’m waiting.”
"Why so far?"
"I love him!" Potter blurted. He braced himself on the door jamb, staring at the floor. "I—I love him, Ron."
Ron sighed. "It's been three months. If Draco hasn't owled you by now, then he's not ready to see you." He ran a hand over his face and regarded the vampire with a sad frown. "Look, you're my mate, but so is Draco, and this is putting me in a really shit place between you. If he says he doesn't want to see you, then he doesn't—"
“Into the dining room, everyone! Arthur, help me bring everything out,” Molly said briskly, turning to hand the coats over to Ron.
"Not that I don't love chatting with you, but you realize there would less of this back and forth if you would just claim the trust. It makes the paperwork so much easier, and it would certainly give you more time to your hobbies." Renault's face cracks into a wide grin. "I've missed seeing you at the club, despite Blaise's idiocy." When Draco doesn't respond, he adds, "I am sorry about that. If I'd known that's what he was planning, I'd never have agreed to it, you know that, don't you?"
He waves off the question. "It's just something I got after the war. I wanted a reminder of how much I'd changed."
Draco’s lips twitched in a smile. “’Den of iniquity’? Merlin, Potter, what are you getting up to?”
Harry scoffs, "When you say it like that, it sounds horrible."
Draco stepped into the bathroom and had to hold onto the door handle to keep from falling to his knees and praising Merlin for his mercy.
Granger’s smile was smooth, and for a second, she looked too much like Pansy Parkinson for comfort. “Then you don’t have anything to lose, either. You may still be prideful and arrogant, Malfoy, but the one thing you’re not is stupid.”
God, the small talk was going to kill him. Again. So perhaps the best option was to leave it behind altogether.
It's been a week since the dinner party, and in that time, much has happened. Harry's relationship with Draco has been fraught with more contact. Specifically, slow, deep kisses in the morning, not to mention the impromptu snogging sessions in shadowy corners all over the Manor. He doesn't feel the need to progress to sex, instead, taking the time to acclimate Draco to the wonders of affectionate anticipation. They're comfortable right now, and the sense of ease between them is more than satisfactory. More will come, he has no doubt. There is no need to rush. He's not going anywhere.
"Is this where I left you last night?" Harry asks.
"Nothing that you weren't already aware of," she replied. "I signed for Severus yesterday by proxy."
Draco's skin pinks up from his neck to ears and his lashes flutter as his eyes drop to the table. He picks at his napkin and gives Harry a side-long glance.
“What is it?”
Potter tried to shake off Draco's hands, but he tightened his hold. "Listen, you don't understand. This is part of the problem, part of why—this is why I have to hold back, you see. I can't let it out." Potter pleaded with him, pupils blown wide with thirst and want, and he was the most beautiful thing Draco had ever seen.
Millie's eyes narrow and her mouth opens, no doubt to revisit the long-winded, profanity-laden lecture about creating heirloom pieces, artist recognition, and her and Luna's future financial stability, but he cuts her off with a hand.
Draco nods. "Yes," he gasps. "Hard. Hard limit, sir."
"Draco," Harry warns. "Stop it."
Harry sat back down, feeling suddenly out of place. He straightened, hoping to afford himself some distance from the situation, from being alone with Ron for the first time in a very long while. It tickled at the back of his mind that the awkwardness was one-sided, because Ron sat next to him like nothing untoward had ever happened. Like nothing in the past between them mattered.
"Doubtful."
Harry's thumb rubs a hard circle on the column of Draco's neck. "Did I tell you to leave?"
Draco tilted his head back and stared at the ceiling, mouth open on a small breath. "I can't do this anymore." He closed his eyes for a long second, steeling his nerves. "I—I have to go."
"Your son?" she scoffs with a bark. "You have no son. He ceased to be your son the moment you let that madman brand him like cattle."
"Because of the kind of man he is?" It's a loaded question, and now Harry has absolutely no doubt that Narcissa knows not only exactly what kind of man her son is, but what kind of man Harry is as well. There's no judgment in her tone; she asks the question as if it's a point of fact. As if his and Draco's sexual inclinations are as mundane as discussing the weather.
Draco's frown is absolutely adorable. "Traitors. The both of you. I hope you're very happy together."
Harry admires the muscled curve of Draco's arse as he bends to place his trousers on the sofa. Draco's lashes bat shyly, as if he's unused to such compliments. Perhaps he isn't, not like this. That's about to change.
The thought of pressing Draco against these same tiles starts a slow burn in his blood. He imagines Draco, long-limbed and gorgeous, begging for Harry's touch. Harry can see them tangled together, skin on skin, mouths against flesh, panting and desperate as Harry fucks him into the wall. Draco moans and writhes beneath him, clinging to Harry with fingers that bite, like he's the only thing Draco needs in this world.
"You're goddamned right I did!" she shouts back. "I survived. I survived the Dark Lord, and I survived you. Now I'm going to live. Every breath I take from now on is a breath I take to spite you. This is the last time you will look upon my face, because the dead do not live here. I only hope that Hell treats you as favorably as you have treated us."
"Very good, Draco. Lovely. You've chosen well."
"Ten inches," Potter said with a sinister smile. "Hawthorn. It'll do." With that, Potter plunged Draco's wand, point down, into the gaping hole of Silvestri's chest. The vampire shrieked in pain, and Potter growled, "
Draco's out of the room like a shot, and Harry hears the door across the hall slam shut. A ripple of irritated magic pulses through the room and pushes at Harry, urging him toward the open door.
Her head dropped, and for a second he thought she might actually be crying, but when her eyes lifted, she had managed to restrain them. Tiny sparkles welled in her brown eyes, and the effort she exuded to hold them back was tremendous. Granger’s lip quivered. “He’s-Malfoy, he’s hurt people. Feeding without consent, Turning people against their will. It’s getting worse. Two days ago, he almost killed a man in Chelsea. Practically ripped his throat out. The Vampire Council was on the verge of declaring him rogue, and he was wanted by the Ministry.” Her hands came together and slid across the table as if to reach for him. “If he doesn’t take a Consort, they’ll execute him.”
"Or two, Mr. Potter, the Manor itself brought you to us."
"This house has no head!" she shoots back in annoyance. "Your father saw to that. And you have chosen not to take his place there. The house has made other arrangements, it seems." Her eyes flash at Draco and he backs down. "Even if only in the interim." She directs her gaze back to Harry. "Keep your seat, Harry. Everything is fine."
"Don't ask me 'what'!" he shouted as the fog around his brain cleared. "How would you like it if I accosted you in a moment of grief and attempted to bugger you over your mother's headstone?"
He's violently barreling around the room, never getting close enough to Harry to be a threat, but the expression on his face is downright murderous. Malfoy's brow is furrowed into deep creases, his skin is blotchy and red, and beads of sweat have dotted across his hairline. He's sucking in air as quickly as he's letting it out in his tirade. There's a vein that's popped out at his temple and Harry swears to Merlin he can take Malfoy's blood pressure just by looking at it. He's shaky and flustered, and so, so angry.
Snape's fingers ghosted over the line of his robes, flattening out an invisible imperfection. "What, because I'm dead, you think that will excuse your laziness?" He tsked. "I'm exactly the same man I was, Draco." Those dark eyes pierced him to the core. "Are you?"
"What—what is—I mean, it's wonderful. But why did you do this? I thought you were redoing the study for you."
"I knocked."
“As good as,” Ron piped up. “He’s your Consort, and that’s a magic that’s grounded in blood. Face it, when you and Malfoy shacked up together, you pretty much got married, and that makes you family. So the Malfoy wards have no choice but to accept you.” He lowered his voice a fraction. “Not to mention the fact that you’ve actually got his blood in you.”
Potter let out a non-committal hum as his hand fell away from Draco’s neck. He looked as if he had more to say, but the vampire’s features closed, returning back to the emotionless mask. Potter sat back, out of Draco’s personal space. “You should get dressed. There’s some things in the wardrobe that should fit. We’ll head to Gringotts for your key and then we should have enough time to get you to Diagon Alley for some new clothes before the shops close.”
"Of course."
"Because," he chuckles, biting down on her bottom lip hard enough to make her gasp, "your roses are trilling."
Draco's lashes fluttered and his tongue swiped out to moisten his dry lips. "Perhaps," he replied softly. "If it was tasteful. But knowing you, you'd give me something horrific and I'd have to take it just to be nice."
"I—I would have known—"
His mother's face scowls as she snaps at him, "Language, Draco."
“She wants to talk to you.”
"No, I don't plan on voicing an objection." His tone is soft and resigned. "Even if I think she's far too old and far too good for him, I can admit that his presence here has changed her state of mind for the better. If he makes her happy, all I can really do is be grateful." Draco glares at Harry's knowing grin and points a long, elegant finger at him. "However, should he make her
"Arms up. Grab the bar just above the chain."
I need you.
Draco looks surprised at that and slips out of the shirt with much less fanfare. He walks to the other end of the sofa, folds the shirt and places it on the cushion. He divests himself of his shoes, placing them neatly on the floor, tucking his socks inside.
Potter threw back his head and laughed. "I think the only reason he came was to make sure Lucius was well and truly dead."
Harry had warned Silvestri. Made his thoughts perfectly clear on the subject. But Silvestri just had to push. This time too far. Silvestri knew how he felt, and had crossed the line anyway. One thought filled Harry's mind as he Apparated.
Potter's face scrunched and he peered down into the expanse and snorted. "Nothing. You're as empty as I thought you were." He shifted his gaze into Silvestri's face, and Potter's words were so cold they chilled Draco to the bone. "I did warn you."
Her face relaxed, and her sudden aura of calm unnerved him. “You don’t hate him.”
"Brunch is being served, Master Harry. Will you be to joining Miss Cissa and Master Dragon?"
Potter moved his feet, shuffling them past the sofa to the far wall where Draco's back landed with a thud. With jeans shoved down to both their thighs, and Potter's hand on their cocks, it was a wonder they didn't tumble to the floor.
The prickle against his skin and the burn in his chest spread out all over his body, and he sees nothing but Fiendfyre in Potter’s eyes.
She nodded.
There is a small tremor around the corner of his left eye, but nothing more.
Afternoon swells into evening, and Harry marvels at the magic infused in the room as the light wavers and changes without a word from him. His fingers begin to cramp and he casts a quick
"You did say they were sparkly."
"Draco, I—"
“Not the ferret!” Ron cried. “Anyone but the ferret! Blimey, ‘Mione, couldn’t you get anyone else?”
Her mouth twitched, but she said nothing. Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion. He always remembered her to be extremely outspoken.
And he wasn't faceless.
Draco swivels to face him and Harry can see a light in his eyes. "A Malfoy is always punctual." The little grin that slides across his lips makes Harry want to tackle him and fuck him into the floor. "Especially when he's the guest of honor."
Harry backs away and stands. "Turn over."
Harry puts his teacup down and shrugs. "I've learned to take things in stride these days."
"Merciful Merlin!" Draco exclaims. "What's happened here?"
“There,” he growled, his face a mask of scorn. “You’ve done your good deed. Now get out.”
Shacklebolt rose and followed her out. The Minister paused at the threshold. “It’s the only way, Ron. I’m sorry.”
"Yes, Draco."
"You said you were thinking about potions. Now you can do that. I'll explain how in a bit, but for now, this is yours. I know nothing can bring back your expectations of how you thought your life would go, but this could be your life. If you wanted it to be."
Harry stares at him as he goes on. Malfoy's worked himself into a proper strop, and he can't string together coherent sentences any longer. The words 'fucking Longbottom', 'Golden Trio', and 'infestation' spout from his lips with all the force of expletives.
“Potter said you wanted to talk to me?” he asked lightly, perching on the edge of the sofa to face her, making a show of arranging himself with his back to Potter. If Potter wanted to sulk, he would happily oblige, but he didn’t have to see it.
Harry sighs again. It's probably just as well. A lasting relationship seems to be permanently out of his reach.
“And what if he decides to chuck it all and take me out with him? Hmm? What then?”
An audible swallow.
The question is laced with quiet insecurity.
Harry glances down, realizing that Blinky has, in fact, put him at the head of the table. Where the patriarch sits. Where Lucius Malfoy would be sitting if he were still alive. This can't be right. He expects the mistake to be rectified at once. Maybe the house will oust him from the chair. Maybe the specter of an angry Lucius Malfoy will make his presence known and wreak havoc until Harry gets his arse out of the chair. But nothing like that happens.
Draco smiled, pleasant with the feeling of chatting about a subject close to his heart. “We’ll see if it’s possible. Without my NEWTs, and of course, this old thing,” he shook his left forearm, “I don’t think there’s a Potions Master in Britain who would agree to apprentice me. And without that, I couldn’t be licensed by the Ministry, no matter how free they tell me I am.”
"I wish you would rethink this, mate. I really do," Ron says, and the imploring look on his face makes Harry almost want to reconsider.
Draco's eyes widen for a second before he barks out a short hoot of laughter. "Oh, Merlin, that was awful. Just—oh, that was truly terrible."
Harry snorts and sits up from his reclining position on the chaise, placing the volume of Rumi's collected works on the side table. He doesn't respond, instead taking in the way Draco's practically vibrating with restrained emotion. Harry scoots back, getting more comfortable. He adjusts his dressing gown, pulling it out from where it's bunched up beneath him. He's aware that Draco's getting an eyeful of his bare chest as he does so, but he blinks twice at Draco and says calmly, "I'm not trying to seduce you, Draco."
Potter shifted on his feet, scratching at the back of his head. "You weren't supposed to know."
. It's almost nine, and he's missed dinner. Just as his stomach rumbles in protest, Blinky pops back in with a silver tray.
The tent in Draco's pajamas is unmistakable. As is the darkening spot of damp on the pale blue fabric.
“Thank you.”
His cock throbbed between them, right on the edge of orgasm, and he reached down. Again, Potter's hand batted him away with a snarl. "No," he grunted, leaning over to brace one hand over Draco's shoulder. "You'll come on my cock or not at all."
The doors shut behind Potter and Blinky, and Draco lets out a strangled gasp. The hole that's been gnawing away in his gut since Potter dropped in has finally eaten through to his spine, leaving him empty with a roiling ache. He's calmer now than he was, and the knowledge that Po—no,
He takes her hand and clasps it warmly, watching the tight line around her mouth recede. "The past is the past, Pansy. Consider it forgotten. As for Draco, I have no intention of coming between him and his friends. In fact, I want him to spend time with you." He gives her a genuine smile. "He missed you, you know. I'm glad you're here for him. I was hoping we could become friends as well."
Potter's eyes shuttered closed, and his mouth drew up. His throat worked like he was going to speak, but no sound emerged.
"No—Draco! Draco, please!
"Maybe it was just the thrall."
Draco held out the frame for him to see. “It’s my mother and her sisters.”
"No," Harry says, his lips pursed into a tight line. "This is me, showing you what I have to offer. Openly, honestly. I can't help it if you're responding to that. I haven't made a move toward you. If I had, you'd already be in my bed and this conversation would be pointless. I don't need to pursue anything. You'll either come to me, or you won't. It's as simple as that."
He let out a half-laugh. "You really haven't changed have you, Severus?"
"I thought you didn't offer your body in gratitude," Potter said, his gaze trained on Draco's mouth.
Draco blinks furiously in an attempt to gather his words. "Wait, you're telling me that the Manor just gave you another room? What's wrong with this one?" He's trying hard not to look affronted, and the bit of fluster on him has Harry's eyes darkening with arousal. Draco is gorgeous when he's expressive.
Draco slips out of bed and into his slippers, not bothering with a dressing gown, before following Harry across the hall to his room.
Draco sidles up next to his best friend with a sparkle in his eye. "You two look cozy."
Potter’s eyebrow rose. “Really?”
Gilles is a free-spirited artist, which should have been Draco’s first clue at the outset that this wouldn’t last, but the man sucks cock so well Draco was two months in before he realized it. After that, the haze of fabulous sex tended to gloss over the rough edges. And now Draco’s bored with all of it, because although the pretty Frenchman’s oral skills are off the charts, he is, at his core, a total pillow princess.
"Exactly."
“Thank you,” he whispered in Draco’s ear. “Thank you, Draco. So fucking much.” There was a choked half-sob in there somewhere.
Potter's brow furrowed in affront and he snorted out an indignant breath. "You're no one's consolation prize."
Ron and Hermione peeked down from their vantage point on the stairs.
Potter looked contrite, but said nothing to confirm the emotion. “Treacle tart.”
"Thank you."
“Kreacher’s left you a plate in the kitchen. Smells like roast beef. I almost had some myself.”
"My mind did wander for a moment, but I assure you, I'm right here," Harry replies.
Harry chuckles. "I don't think that's going to be a problem. I think she likes me."
"Strip."
"Not particularly, no."
"But you did anyway, you realize?"
He makes quick work of his dinner and tidies up the studio, taking a moment to stretch once it's all done. He's made a bit of progress, and Harry has to admit he feels more accomplished than he has in ages. It's a good feeling.
"Thank you, Potter, I gathered that much. Exactly why do you own part of my business? Don't you have your fangs sunk deep enough?"
"You'll wear decent robes if I have to get Ron to Spello-tape you into them."
“What is it?” Draco frowned. “I realize that Granger duped you into this by getting you to sign first, and I should probably feel sorry for you at that, but I don’t.” When Potter didn’t react, Draco crossed his arms over his chest and continued, injecting as much scorn into his tone as he could muster. “So here we are, and I can’t help that I’m the last person you want to take a chunk out of, but believe me, you weren’t my first choice either. And if the thought of my blood is so repellent to you, you should take a look around and reevaluate your options, Potter, because frankly, I think this about the best that either of us is going –” Draco’s rant cut off as Potter’s fingers began to move, tapping out a silent rhythm on his thigh.
In this light, in this space, Draco is everything Harry has ever hoped for. Everything Harry has dreamed of. It's almost too good to be true, and despite the vehemence of his desire, there is a tiny, niggling part of him that thinks it is.
Draco is breathtaking.
“Master Draco’s room is being ready for him.”
“Then she can send him an owl.”
Draco smeared his fingers across Potter's lips, painting them with the mixture of blood and semen. "You owe me, Potter." His voice was a breath above deadly. "I have willingly given you everything, and you stole from me." Potter panted against his fingers, eyes now wide and apprehensive. "You owe me because I can give you your life back, but you can never give me back mine."
His beautiful boy is a mess underneath his crop and his tongue, mewling and writhing with sinuous grace. This time, Harry takes the flat of the crop and swats at his balls lightly before swiping up over the crack of his arse. The breath that Draco sucks in is sharp and fierce, and Harry has no choice but to respond.
Snape's eyes widened at Draco's house-elf affect. "Is that what you think? You're little more that Potter's house-elf?"
Draco doesn’t miss a beat. “Probably.
Neville turns and nods to Draco. "Draco, good to see you." He snags Harry in a one-armed hug as Blinky pops in to show him out. "See you around, Harry."
Harry can honestly say he doesn't remember much of the pleasantries after that. He's too caught up in Draco and the way he completely broadsided him. Neville and Narcissa have presumably gone off to the greenhouse, and he's left alone with Draco. Who, Harry suddenly realizes, is speaking to him.
The skin continued to recede, leaving a broad hole in Silvestri's chest. No blood poured forth, yet Potter's hand still hovered, wild magic seeping out of him so far that Draco could taste it on his tongue from his vantage point several yards away.
something."
His gaze flicked back to Potter, who stood with his arms crossed over his chest in a measure of impatience. Draco’s eyes caught the attention of a small frame on the desk and when he went over for a better look, he gasped in surprise. Potter was by his side in an instant.
Draco stared him down. "We'll have a spring wedding. With those flowers of Mother's sprouting everywhere."
Harry mentally shrugs. Maybe this one he's meant to figure out on his own. So he goes with his gut and gives Blinky a wide smile and reaches for her hand. "I'd love to."
Malfoy's stiff in the hallway, hands clenched at his sides, the lines of his lips pinched so tight against his face they've lost all color.
There was silence, but only brief before Potter offered, “Good to see you.”
“What are you doing? What is that?”
And…three…two…one.
He was so caught up in the feeling around him, so different than magic, so much darker and ever more promising. Draco's almost didn't recognize Potter's features as they shifted, the skin smoothing out over the planes of his face, blossoming with an inner light that made him seem to glow from within. He lost all sense of space and time as Potter moaned softly into the air between them. It was hypnotic and unavoidable, and he found himself pressed into Potter's body. The vampire's erection was hard between them, cradled in the juncture of Draco's hips as his body welcomed Potter's. The soft gasp that escaped him must have sounded like consent, because the moment it left his lips, Potter invaded.
Potter sat back and turned to stretch out on the couch, closing his eyes. The soft glow of the lamplight was kind to his features, softening the lines of his jaw, and giving his skin a golden hue that made him look more mortal than usual.
die before it could grace the open air, not ready to admit to emotions that he didn't understand himself. "Who was that?" he asked quickly, hoping it would cover his pause.
He pulled on the pajamas he never quite made it into the night before, making his way downstairs to find Granger’s head in the Floo with Potter sitting calmly on the sofa thumbing through an old copy of Quidditch Today, completely ignoring her. To her credit, she was glaring straight at him.
It was hard to imagine his mother ever consenting to visit the Burrow, much less sit down with Molly Weasley for tea. But he remembered the drawn look on her face at the trials, and the defeat in her eyes when he and his father had been sentenced. Their lives had changed so drastically by the end of the war, and things once found abhorrent didn’t seem so terrible anymore. It was easy to forget that once upon a time he would have rather died than be under Potter’s thumb. If he could swallow his pride and bare his neck for Potter, surely his mother made time for tea.
She smiled back warmly as Potter and Weasley brushed past him. “Anytime, Draco. If you need anything, owl or Floo me.”
Draco’s face scrunched in affront. “Do you enjoy being this creepy, or what?”
“Good,” she said, rising to her feet. Leaning over to press a kiss to the top of Ron’s head, she smiled. “It’s late. And I’m tired. You boys catch up.”
"I know you seem to think that I was embroiled in some sort of domestic violence, and in hindsight, yes, it was. But not to the degree you're thinking. I wanted what he offered. I thought it was what I needed. I thought I needed to be punished, and Blaise wanted someone to punish." His gaze flicks to Harry and he smiles. "It should have been the perfect arrangement. But you see, Blaise only unleashed himself in the bedroom. Outside of that, we were the typical pure-blood couple. Poised, driven, socially desirable in certain circles. My name still carried more weight than his in society, much like it had in school. His inferiority complex is truly breathtaking." Draco sighs and puts his hands in his pockets, craning his neck back to look at the ceiling. "The bedroom was the only place he could take out his jealousy and berate me for my standing. And I let him."
The stony expression anchored on Cook's face crumbles bit by bit, until her ears droop and her eyes are wide and liquid. Her bottom lip quivers and she bursts into tears. Her little hands ball into fists at her side and she shouts, "Blinky is being serving coffee now!" Her foot stamps once and she disappears with another loud pop.
"Out." Harry raises his hand to point at the door, when Draco jerks back, arm flying up to cover his face. It's instinctive, and defensive, and it is the final nail in Blaise Zabini's coffin. When the blow never comes, Draco lowers his arms warily, casting panicked eyes on Harry. "And that right there is why this isn't happening tonight," he tells Draco roughly.
," Harry says smoothly. "If you ever—and I mean,
Of pride.
Harry draws in a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Draco is still so tense beside him. "If I left you here last night, and didn't ask you to leave, then why in the world were you not here this morning?"
“Yes, she did. And we had a very cathartic chat. It was a bit awkward at first, what with the lingering feud—”
, pulling his body tight, making it bow under the strain. The whispered praise keeps coming, dulcet and delicious, and it hits Draco so hard because, yes, he wants to be good, yes, he wants to be perfect, wants to be all of the honeyed things Potter says he is. It fills him with such satisfaction that Draco decides the next time they do this (Merlin, please) he wants to ride Potter so hard he cries.
"Because, my love," she says knowingly, "hasn't it always been about Harry?"
There are at least a hundred different reasons he should say no. First and foremost is Malfoy. Their history is nothing short of volatile, and he knows it would probably please Malfoy to end if they ended up hexing each other at every turn. But second—is Malfoy. Barefoot and ruffled, with a sneer that seems to wax and wane like the tide, and it's so intriguing that Harry wants to know more. He wants to know about Switzerland, wants to know why he's wearing worn trousers and gets huffy over an enthusiastic house-elf. Wants to know if it's his magic's own doing or this old edifice of stalwart pureblood supremacy that's brought him here. Beyond that, there are so many other reasons to say no, but so many questions that he can have answered.
Draco dropped to his knees in one swift move, and Harry had to throw his head back and hiss as Draco's mouth engulfed his cock. No teasing, no pretense, no sense of heightening the experience. It was sharp and practiced, skillful and precise, exalting and damning all at the same time. Harry panted and gasped as Draco's lips tightened their seal, exerting pressure and suction and warmth that made him go boneless against the table.
Harry inhales deeply, trying hard not to look like a puffed-up peacock, but honestly, there's so much pride and confidence rushing through him he thinks he might burst. He knows what he looks like, black trousers and bare feet, a tailored blue shirt with the cuffs rolled up to the elbow. Elegant, but at ease, as if there's nothing in the world that can trouble him at this moment. And frankly, unless another Dark Lord suddenly rises to power in the next twenty minutes, there isn't. Even then, Harry thinks as Draco's tongue darts out to moisten his lips, it's iffy.
Hermione squeezed his arm. "Talk to him first. I see your color rising. If he didn't come to you, there must be a reason. Calm down, and find out what it is."
Narcissa's straighter in her chair than Malfoy and a worried pinch steals across her lips. "I don't know, Harry. I would hate for him to visit and feel uncomfortable. The Manor has left its mark on so many in one way or another. I don't wish to reopen old wounds."
"Shit!" he gasps. Draco cranes his neck forward, squinting into where Harry fills the doorway. "Ha—Harry?"
Draco thrusts his hips forward on a breathy gasp. "Take me home, Harry.
Draco sighs and throws his head back. "Harry Potter had nothing to do with my choice to see Blaise."
Valeria scoffed and shook her head. "You could have been so happy with us. You still can," she entreated. "Silvestri's not as unyielding as you might think. Once he gets past his irritation with you. And you know where he is. The place where it all began. Where you were reborn." She held out her hand. "Come back with me. Come back to the fold. We've been waiting for you." Valeria cut her eyes at him. "
"I thought things were going well between you," he ventured. "There's been no bloodshed." He paused with a smirk as Draco frowned at him. "You know what I mean."
Narcissa tsks under her breath at her son's language, but Harry simply smiles at her. "I don't think you'd be up for it anyway," He grins at Narcissa. "I'm a cuddler."
Maybe Hermione was right, and he should have known, but it doesn't seem to make any sort of difference now. He wants some space to think. He wants to be left alone. He wants peace and quiet. He wants a haven to be himself. He wants—
"Yes, you're so maligned." Harry rolls his eyes and straightens. "I like this. That we can laugh together. Talk together."
He can't help it. Harry laughs. Braces his hand on the ridiculously expensive wool rug and laughs. He rises to his feet, shaking his head. He grins despite himself, and is quite satisfied by the glare he receives from Malfoy in turn.
Potter stared at him, wide-eyed, no doubt imagining the scene in his mind. He burst out laughing again. "Oh, Draco. This is why I love you."
"Yes, Draco."
Harry twists his fingers and batters at Draco's arse as he bears his weight on Draco once more. He knows there is nothing in Draco's field of vision but his face, nothing Draco's body can register but Harry. His weight, his scent, his taste. He is the only thing Draco can fathom at the moment. And it's right where Harry wants him.
you are accountable."
Neville's mouth is hot and wet and altogether delicious. The stubble on his cheek is scraping, but it only makes her come alive. Every nerve is being awakened, roused into life in this trial by fire. She thought that maybe there would be a slow burn between them, but she never expected
"God, I've dreamed of opening you up like this," Potter panted as he slipped the tip of one finger inside. "Stretching you with my tongue and my fingers, feeling you, tasting you, getting you all hot and slick." The point of Potter's tongue licked around his finger, the twin sensations making his knees lock to avoid collapsing. "I want you wet for me, God, Draco, so fucking wet. Shiny, pink, and perfect, just open and ready for my cock."
Draco smiled and sat back in his chair, letting his right hand rest on his abdomen. “Merlin, Molly, you’re a menace to my waistline! If you keep feeding me like this, I’ll put on two stone by the end of the year, and Potter will have to roll me wherever we go.”
"War happened, Harry," Snape stressed, "and there wasn't anything else you could do. There wasn't anything else the rest of us could do, either. People died. It's sad and it's terrible, but it's the truth. The Dark Lord is to blame, not you."
It was a wonder the cup didn’t snap in his hands. To avoid the faux pas, he set it down gently with barely steady hands. “You-you saw my mother?” The breathy desperation in his voice was heavy on his ears.
The sneer that crosses his face is hate personified. "Yes, I bought you. And you were never worth the price I paid."
It works.
Neville scoops her up bridal style and carries her back into her quarters. Behind him, the door ripples and slams shut on its own. Instead of a bang, it sounds like an exultation.
Malfoy throws open the heavy double doors with more force than is strictly necessary, stomping into the room without a word, leaving Harry to follow. It's either that or stand out in the hallway, and he has to bite back a chuckle at the blond's petulance.
"All is well, I take it?" Harry asks.
"I wouldn't miss it. And I'll talk to Draco. Let him know that we're not actually conspiring against him."
They clung to each other as they rode out the last of the aftershocks, shivering against each other as they fell in a tangle to the bed. Potter rolled him to the side and spooned behind him, wrapping his arms tightly around Draco. He mouthed at the nape of Draco's neck, nosing through the strands of his damp hair, licking the sweat from his skin.
"I don't know," Harry says. "But the possibility is there, so yes, for the time being, attempt to acclimate yourself."
“Mrs. Weasley,” Potter said, tension pulling his voice tight.
A low, feral growl emanated from a point deep within the cavern of Harry's chest, morphing into a harsh snarl as it passed over his lips. His fangs and nails elongated as he threw off the shackles of restraint and let the creature claw its way to the surface. Red passed over his vision, sharpening his focus, and he let the thrum of Draco's heartbeat lead him without hesitation. Harry walked forward with a relaxed, easy gait. Each step was slow and steady. There was no need for haste; nothing on earth could stop him.
Potter's body covered the other vampire, using his thighs and ankles to press Silvestri immobile into the dirt. He watched as Potter's free hand came up and hovered over Silvestri's chest, steady and unwavering. Potter's eyes bore into the other vampire as the fabric of his robe parted over his heart, baring pale skin to the air. Smoke rose in swirling tendrils and flesh began to creep back, crackling like the sound of someone tearing old parchment.
Potter’s breath came in ragged whuffs of air, skating along the still-healing puncture wounds at his neck. They tingled under the warm, moist air, and Draco found himself craning his neck to expose more of it to Potter’s face. He felt Potter nose at the marks, rubbing softly, like a cat leaving its scent. The sensation deepened, and his hand came up to thread through the sweat-dampened tendrils of hair at the nape of Potter’s neck to press him closer.
When Draco stepped out of the room the next evening, Potter was gone, but the floor was suspiciously cool.
"All I'm asking is to talk to him. That's it."
Their silence and disapproval is palpable, and to be honest, he is far more than a little tired of it.
Draco inhales and lets out a slow breath, "Acceptable."
Harry's breath stutters when he realizes he hasn't said a single word to Malfoy since entering the room. Malfoy has worked himself into this state all on his own. And that is unacceptable.
Harry turns to get back to painting when Blinky pops in, her sunny yellow ruffles and bright eyes making her glow with happiness.
Because Harry says.
Draco's grin is as bright as sunshine. "Maybe."
“Enough!” Potter roared. “Don’t take another fucking step. You don’t touch him. You don’t look at him. You don’t come near him. He is mine.”
Grey eyes slid from the letter to Harry's face, the point of Draco's chin following a brief second after to stare up at him. A perfectly formed pale brow rose in question. He knew Harry was lying. And Harry knew he knew he was lying. A dizzying subterfuge, but obvious all the same.
"We should get them together."
But Harry thinks he is beautiful.
Draco
Potter’s eyes are trained on Draco like he’s the only thing worth looking at in the room, and fuck if it hasn’t been a long time since that’s happened. Potter wants, and it doesn’t take a second for Draco to realize he’s going to give it to him.
Draco swears and rolls his bottom lip between his teeth again. "Fuck, Harry."
She tapped again. “Just read.”
Harry nestles back into the sofa, spreading an arm across the back to get more comfortable. Malfoy's eyes track every smooth movement. "I'd just left the pub after meeting Ron and Hermione. I was outside, on the street, putting my jacket on, and a swath of reporters was there to hound me. That in itself isn't strange, but after my conversation with Ron and Hermione, I was in no mood to deal with them. I got frustrated, wished I could be someplace else, and *poof*," he gestures, "I ended up on your floor." Mrs. Malfoy shoots her gaze to the spot on the rug where he'd appeared, a small frown tugging at her lips. "If I've damaged your rug, I'll gladly pay for repairs. My apologies."
"I know. I can tell. That pleases me."
Draco meets his gaze and nibbles on his toast. "If I was, I would have every right to do so. She is my mother. Her welfare is my concern."
Granger’s jaw clenched. “You’re overstating, and rather crudely, I might add, but yes.”
"Please, come in," he says, gesturing Draco in with a hand.
“No fucking way.”
Draco froze at Potter's easy assertion, directed toward him for the first time. Potter lowered his lashes and reached out to touch Draco's knee.
Harry expects a violent protest, but when Malfoy's chin dips ever so softly down and to his right and his lashes lower in what Harry knows in his bones to be, fucking Merlin,
Potter spoke, voice hitting a low register Draco hadn't heard before, and the deep, body-shaking tone went straight to his cock. "Get naked and get up there."
“Your pardon from death.”
"I owe no one!" Lucius hisses, fury erupting over his features. A pointed finger slashes in the air. "You betrayed me!"
"Finally, a declaration of love and you give it to Weasley instead of me," Draco scoffed. "I should be insulted, Potter."
"Yes." There's so much more to it than that, but Harry can't find the words.
She was right and he knew it. He didn’t like it, but he knew it. Harry had to admit he’d grown very fond of Narcissa Malfoy, and when he heard what she had done, it had gutted him almost as much as he imagined it had Malfoy.
"Oi! This is my life you're laughing about!"
Her face brightens considerably, and it warms corners of Harry's heart to see it. "I'll send those owls out, if you'll get in touch with your friends?" she asks.
Behind the charm, Draco’s eyebrows rose, but he remained silent, too interested in watching the confrontation unfold to be bothered by Potter’s vehement statement of possession.
Draco makes a noncommittal noise and glances down at his paperwork again. "What do you want?"
Harry drinks in the sight of him. He's possibly the most beautiful thing Harry's ever seen.
"Where is Draco?" he demands. "Where is my son?" His tone is imperious. Even in death, he never fails to make her remember where she stands in his esteem.
Beautifully obedient.
The tantrum is clearly a coping mechanism; one Harry indulges for a few seconds more, until Malfoy tips over the edge from childish to desperate.
He recoiled, but said nothing.
"And Pansy hung out after? That's a good sign that she was comfortable."
She shifts in her seat, raising her chin slightly, and Harry knows he's probably offended her six ways from Sunday, but what she's implying seems so out of touch with reality that he can't even wrap his head around it.
This time Potter flinched as the barb struck home. "I'm doing what's best for him."
He wanted to scream and yell, kick and cry, and maybe even throw something breakable at Potter's head. But looking at the expression on Potter's face, he knew it wouldn't do any good. The vampire was single-minded, yet vacillated all the same. It wasn't worth the effort to get enraged anymore. Disappointment was disappointment, no matter how spectacular or subdued the tantrum. Potter used to be worth the tantrum. Not anymore.
“You don’t have a wand, you prat!” And then Potter’s bedroom door slammed shut.
The sound goes straight to Harry's cock.
"About breakfast—I don't want you to think I'm trying to usurp your authority or anything. I'm not sure why your house is doing these things, but—"
He looks down at where Harry’s hands are clasped together. Before he can ask what Harry’s holding, a hand opens and Draco’s eyes fall on a velvet box that he knows can only come from his favorite jeweler. Harry pops the box open to reveal a thin platinum band studded with sparking pave diamonds. It’s flashy, yet subtle. It’s totally Draco.
Draco keeps his stare focused on the small centerpiece. "What about you?" His voice is quiet, tone low and soft.
Draco chuckles. "You
"Neville helped me find the flowers, but I charmed them to be everlasting. No matter the season, the weather, these flowers will bloom like this forever. I thought it would be a nice tribute to her memory."
Ron shoved back from the table and stared out the open door after his wife. The vampire’s voice made him turn.
Draco spreads wider, and Harry shuffles on top to accommodate, keeping his left hand firmly around Draco's neck. His right hand dips down, bypassing Draco's cock to fondle at his balls for a moment before he slips a finger into Draco's arse. Spit makes for terrible lube, and he only presses into the first knuckle. He has no intention of doing this dry, not ever, so a whispered spell gets Draco's passage slick and ready. The rest of his finger eases the rest of the way in.
"True," he concedes. "But by your logic, then I don't really need the paycheck from the Auror department either."
He's barely sunk down into the soft cushions when a house-elf pops in, her long ears festooned with large, bright yellow bows, as if she was instructed to appear the moment a guest's arse hit the upholstery.
Malfoy's voice hits a strangled high.
Harry smiles fondly at the little elf. "Thank you, Blinky."
Potter smiled. "Audience? You would see it that way." He chuckled.
Harry full well knows they like their handcuffs fuzzy and pink with a quick release; Harry likes his with a bite and a beg. As for Owen—Harry should have spotted his game a mile off. The kind of sub that likes the game only when it suits them. And the only things about their game that suited Owen were Harry's fame and the contents of his vaults. But he hit every almost every one of Harry's weak points. Tall, aristocratic, with a gorgeous body that pinked up beautifully under the sting of a riding crop, and an eager willingness to submit.
He had stared at her with some incredulity before remembering his manners, offering her his arm in turn to walk up the path. She had slipped into his hold immediately, and if his presence of mind was soothed by her gentle acceptance, he supposed no one else was around to see it.
"Yes, Draco."
Draco lathers himself from head to toe in a frantic rush, soaping and scrubbing at every crevice like a madman.
Harry straightens, but not too much, just enough to put a calming, yet confident vibe out between them that, if Harry's instincts are right, will instantly get a response from Malfoy. It's the sort of stance he's used in the past that never fails to soothe and pacify. It's a stance that radiates safety and control, one that tells the sub that Harry's got everything under control and there's no need to worry. It incites trust on a subconscious level, and it's a specialty of Harry's.
She shot one more glare at Potter, took a deep breath and shouted, “Get out! Run while you can! Flee the monster and his den of iniquity! He defiles—”
He thought of his mother and his father, and briefly wondered if the flowerbed around their tomb was being kept. “I don’t have anything else to take.”
She giggles and blushes to the tips of her long, bow-laden ears before popping back out.
"Yes," Draco whispered. "So, you did all of this, for me?"
Harry catches Malfoy's eye over Blinky and her garish yellow ensemble as she pops back in to set up her tea cart, and he wants to grin, by Merlin, does he want to grin, because Malfoy's face is priceless. Blinky and her voluminous clothing are outlandish even by the strangest of house-elf standards, Harry knows that. And he knows Malfoy does, too. But the stubborn git can't be relaxed about it. Malfoy's mother has a fond expression on her face as Blinky does her due diligence, pouring tea and doling out finger sandwiches with the happiest of aplomb, all the while flipping those outrageous ruffles around. She swings by him so fast to place a tea cup in his hand that one of those massive bows nearly smacks him in the face. It's so utterly laughable, and yet Malfoy sits in his chair, lips pinched together, with his chin so high Harry wonders if it's going to permanently strain his neck, completely unwilling to crack the tiniest of smiles. Malfoy's whole posture screams 'so what if the house-elf is barmy – fuck off'. If Malfoy's testament to maintain control wasn't so admirable, Harry would burst out laughing on the spot.
"Don't be impertinent." He leaned forward, as if he were real once again, but stopped at Draco's wide smile.
Blinky pads over and places her little hand on Harry's arm, looking quite serious. "Master Dragon—he is being trying," she says softly.
Potter managed to hold out his resistance for a beat longer than with Hermione, but soon, he was returning Ron’s hug. Two more sets of footsteps sounded on the stairs and Potter’s eyes shot up over Ron’s shoulder and he stiffened. Ron turned and waved over the newcomers, oblivious of Potter’s wariness.
Potter’s eyes were wide and feral, glazed over with an unnatural light. He was crazed, lost inside whatever nightmare that floated in his head. The hand around his neck squeezed with supernatural force, and the air rushed from Draco’s lungs, burning and crackling in his chest.
Draco turned, and the wan expression on his face faltered into a resigned smile at the corner of his lips. "I used to think so."
Draco takes his seat at the table, and as Harry nears the head, the chair scoots back, causing Neville's fork to stop mid-way to his mouth. He blinks twice and then shoots Harry a sly grin. "Well, that's interesting," he says with a quirk of an eyebrow.
"I've changed my mind about your position. Turn around. Knees on the cushion. Hands on the back."
“I wanted to see if I could without the-” his eyes glanced at Draco’s neck, “you know.”
"You're afraid you'll hurt me like you hurt the others, I know," Draco offered. "You don't need to worry about that." He yanked Potter flush and breathed against his lips, mouthing at him, licking across his bottom lip. He tasted dark and rich, with the sweetness of danger. "You can only break me in ways that I want to be broken."
He looks down at Draco, whimpering and writhing, humping against the table's edge. He sees only beauty, only freedom. Surrender in abandon. Things he knows he doesn't deserve. Fashioned by prophecy, there is blood on his hands, and pain is the only gift he has to give. Tears leak into the corner of his eyes, and he blinks them back, never halting the cadence of the crop. It whistles through the air, smacking against flesh that gives and
"No," he said firmly, shaking his head. "You don't get to speak to me. Not yet. Not while I'm within a breath of cursing you if I hear your voice." Draco's eyes flashed dangerously, and Potter eased back, waiting silently. Draco lowered his finger and paced the floor with sharp, pointed steps, keeping his narrowed gaze on the vampire. "Two years, Potter. Two fucking years I sat in Azkaban, and in that time I lost everything I once held precious. I would have waited a lifetime if it meant I could see her again, one last time." A dry chuckle escaped his throat. "So Christmas comes early, and I think that I what I wanted most was right in my grasp. A chance to see my mother again, even if it would be whispered words over her dead body. A chance to say the things I never got to, a chance to make peace with our sins." He stopped, turning his body to face the vampire. "You took that from me. Led me to it like a lamb to slaughter and then snatched it from me like a damned Snitch." His voice dropped. "I don't know if I can forgive you for that."
"Yes, but don't draw too much attention to it. You'll do more harm than good."
Potter glowered and waved him off as Hermione drew him into the small living area. She closed the door behind her and motioned for Draco to sit beside her on the sofa.
Potter cleared his throat beside him, and the sound came out as more of a warning than anything else.
Harry flips the page, keeping his eyes on the text. "I'm in the library. Reading," he drawls. "Well spotted. Ten points to Slytherin."
“Yeah,” George piped up. “You’re the only one who doesn’t have to be subjected to watching Ron shovel it in.”
Potter outlines a series of theories and connections related to this new Death Eater faction, and requests only Draco’s insight (if he has any) as the case goes on. That’s all, he promises. Just information and insight. To top it off, Potter even says that the only person he’ll have to deal with or speak to is him. No Robards, no other Aurors, no one else. Just him.
"Noon sharp!" Snape called after him. "Don't let Potter keep you in bed all day! You have NEWTs to prepare for!"
"Two days," Zabini says, and his eyes crinkle in a slight squint. "Potter is mistaken."
The second the third finger pushes in and rubs against his sweet spot with force, his hands come up to wrap around Harry's wrist. Harry kisses him and increases the pace. He's fucking into Draco's tight heat with as much force as he can muster, and Draco's grip on his wrist is bone-crushingly firm, but not panicked. He keeps his eyes on Harry, and Harry can see the maelstrom of emotion that swirls across his face.
