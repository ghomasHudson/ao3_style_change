"You're… " Theo whispered, looking at him. There was no more admiration. "You're the one behind all of this?" Draco doesn't know why, but when it was put like that it made him feel guilty.
Draco paused on the staircase...why was he thinking about Potter of all people? Shaking it off, he turned the corner, walking pass his room and he ventured further down the West Wing. He’s been warned never to go pass the black door with the golden knocker, but as that door quickly fades from his peripheral, he feels something he hasn’t in a while. The feeling that lies deep in his chest, only growing stronger as he meets his destination, the Red Door. He comes closer to the wood, inhaling it’s familiar scent. He raises a finger and scratches the blood off the door revealing the black underneath. Draco will most likely never hear the Red Door’s story, but that doesn’t stop him from fantasizing. Grasping the doorknob, he ignores the sudden rush of despair coursing threw him and twist it open. The air was salty, causing his eyes to water, but Draco plunged on.
word. I don't wish for you to die. I don't! " Nott shouted as doubt clouded over Draco's face. The tears were steady, but he didn't let them hinder his speech as he continue to say apology after apology. It was only when Draco showed no sign of forgiveness did he finally start sobbing. Not for long, however, as Draco placed a hesitant hand on his arm. And when he looked up, it was to a small smile.
He went to speak to Borgin at the counter, robes billowing behind him. Theo and Draco shared a look with each other. Immediately Theo went to explore, ignoring the elder Malfoy’s demands. Draco rolled his eyes from where he stood, though he made no move to disobey his father’s orders, he did give everything in the store a scrutinized glance.
last chapter recap: draco found out that his diar- ✨journal✨ had a little secret, and has been conversing with it, for some odd reason 🧍🏾♀️
Draco was done with the world, Theo has avoided him ever since the forest incident. The only reason he is alive is because of a centaur named - Firenze? Fenrir? He wasn't listening. But that's not important! He almost died and Theo is choking on his damn pride! So Draco is not in the best of moods, and his luck only worsened when he was confronted by some ugly witch while reading in the library.
I'm so sorry for posting so late, a family emergency came up that had to be fixed for quite some time. Again, really sorry for the wait.
. It was only when he saw the small smile on his face that he relaxed. This was going better than he thought-
to omit a threatening aura along with one of aloofness, when there's this big buffoon with stupid glasses staring at you! Like!! Can't you see he's trying to be mysterious?!
Draco was, rightfully, uncertain. He had a conflicted look on his face. Stepping back, he avoided looking at Theo.
"Nott left Malfoy in the bathroom with the troll!" Hermione rushed to say. The adults slowly turned their heads to Theo, who had suddenly gained an interest on the floor.
Draco to notice him put the book in the cauldron. So that way Draco would take it, start writing in it, and then Lucius would sneakily take it to read in on his secrets! But, that still doesn’t explain who this Tom Riddle guy is!
to change his beliefs – and it had been painful and a slow process (it was still a process) but he’d made those changes because they were the right thing. Knowing that there’d been a violent catalyst to start those changes didn’t, as far as Harry was concerned, negate the fact that he made them.
He wondered what she saw when she looked at it. The room she shared with Lisa Turpin was quite small in comparison, with the two beds reasonably close and a bathroom that was perhaps a touch too small to easily share. The room Longbottom was once again sharing with Weasley, looked about the same, though it might be a bit more spacious now, given it no longer had a third bed crammed in. Having been inside the room Hannah shared with Susan Bones, Draco knew that the rooms were all the same, beds and just enough floor space to move about and a bathroom to share.
Slowly, Harry nods. Softly he says, ‘You said you don’t want to raise a child right now, Ginny. You said you can’t just get rid of it. Draco and I want children, we’re going to need help.’
Because he didn’t have secrets from Draco. He could turn to Draco in the middle of the night and prod him awake and complain about something stupid he’d only just remembered happening in second year or explain the origin of a scar on his right big toe without worrying that Draco would pity him, or that it would somehow change the way Draco saw him.
His little sound isn’t enough for her and she slams her fist on the table. ‘Oh? Fuck you Harry! I thought this was what you wanted. I thought, fuck, my Quidditch career is over but at least this’ll make Harry happy and you just – fuck you. How dare you fucking sit there and tell me you want a divorce!’
‘Merlin, you’re serious.’ Ron stared at his old friend and played the conversation back in his mind. ‘You and Malfoy are married. You’ve got four kids. Your son set your house – and your pet snake – on fire.’
And if Ron took extra care dressing that evening for dinner then Hermione never noticed – mostly because he thought she was putting a little extra effort into her appearance too.
The Slytherin girl, who, by now, was starting to flush red and sweat under the gobsmacked scrutiny of two Gryffindors (Ron and Hermione) and Harry’s amused grin, started backing away. ‘Sorry, it was – it was a stupid idea. I’ll just...’ she spun around to scurry off and Draco let out an annoyed breath.
‘Has she?’ Draco’s words were still a quiet hiss, but Harry barely even noticed as he was staring at the table across the room where Hermione had been sitting until just half an hour ago. He thought the fact that she’d chosen to sit all the way across the room with Lisa and not in the armchair Neville had eventually claimed, was especially telling.
‘Ugh, you were horribly obsessed with him for years,’ Ron moaned. ‘I’m just realising how much easier my life would have been back then if you’d just started shagging.’ He turned to look at Hermione. ‘How much more sleep do you think I’d have gotten sixth year if Harry could have been looking at Malfoy instead of his bloody dot on the map?’
He’d helped her come to terms with the fact that she’d never have her parents back. He’d sat there across the table from her in the kitchens and offered her words that gave her comfort. Gave her a reason to believe that even if her choices had been selfish in the beginning, that what she’d given her parents could one day (maybe) outweigh what she’d taken from them. It was never going to be okay that she’d wiped her parents’ memories, never going to be okay that she’d erased key parts of themselves – that she’d erased years of moments and memories and defining events just to protect them from Voldemort.
Harry shrugged. ‘Fifth year, maybe?’ Harry studied the corridor. ‘There haven’t been any classes held up here in the entire time we’ve been at Hogwarts.’
"Why? That's the girls-" "NOTT, YOU HAVE TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE!" Hermione interrupted, rushing to the bathroom and whipping out her wand. "I can't believe you even managed to lead me out!"
him?! His first thought went to Theo. No matter how hard he wanted to storm up to Nott and he’s him blind, he had to ration and think
He didn't continue, unable to find the words. There was silence in the bed and he didn't dare turn around. He said too much. He knows it. The words showed how he was really starting to feel, and that was too much for Draco himself. Now, he'll have to deal with Theo's unwanted opinion too. Great.
Maybe it was the vulnerability in his voice that made Hermione nod her head and scramble to get up. They both ran out the door, right as Draco began to raise his wand.
I'M SO MEAN TO YOU GUYS://// I'M SORRY FOR BEING A LAZY LITTLE SHIT,,,,,  ۰۪۫I۪۫۰'۰۪۫l۪۫۰۰۪۫l۪۫۰ ۰۪۫t۪۫۰۰۪۫r۪۫۰۰۪۫y۪۫۰ ۰۪۫h۪۫۰۰۪۫a۪۫۰۰۪۫r۪۫۰۰۪۫d۪۫۰۰۪۫e۪۫۰۰۪۫r۪۫۰:)
"Draco, " Theo started. Voice tight and eyes hard, yet his face was filled with determination. Draco couldn't count how many times his name has been said that evening. "I am so-" he choked on his words as the tears began to trickle down. "I am
Speaking of Draco- the other half of the school say it's Draco Malfoy. His nonchalance when he saw the words written in blood on the stone wall.
Draco gaped at the smoking red letter, not making any move to open it, so it burst open, spilling his fathers enraged thoughts.
Harry and Draco turned their heads to see Theo staring at them. Well, staring at Draco, he seemed to be avoiding Harry's eyes.
"What do you mean no?! I thought we were friends! Unless..." Theo changed his tactic and adopted a sad look on his face, " We really arent?" He stared at Draco, knowing this is where he would yield.
Draco turned to look at the kind faces of the Trio, and then into Theo's anger filled face. He looked down....
Ron looked eager to agree with him but Hermione’s elbow had him schooling his face features. Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and forced him to sit down.
Since Potter was no where near telling him who this admirer was, Draco would have to start thinking about it himself. And one person immediately sprung to mind. Oh no...
asked Draco something. Though when they did it was never, so I really don't know why they're so shocked. Their shock turned to annoyance but they kept it in as Amy and Leopold, Theo's parents, were still present.
Draco was staring his father in his eyes, noting how close he seemed to snapping. Anyone sane would listen to someone when they’re this deranged, but when had Draco ever been a normal human being? Lucius was losing his patience with every minute that went by silent, his stupid, stubborn son staring at him with a dumbstruck expression. It made his blood boil.
Draco questioned himself as he looked at the retreating pair. The boy turned back to the family, who were staring at him with varying looks of wariness and confusion, probably as to why he didn’t run off with his father. Draco ignored them all and looked at the Wesley girl, who was staring at him with a dangerous sneer. He stepped close to her and she immediately backed up, her family protesting loudly. Draco rolled his eyes and dug in her cauldron before she got the time to move away again. He held up a brown leather diary with a raised eyebrow.
Draco was in a depressed state for days. He went to the rest of his classes the day of the incident, but with a blank mind and barely seeing eyes.
Draco thought. As the two continued bashing the Weasleys, Draco looked down to the book in his hand. Turning it over, it looked like a normal leather bound diary. The front wore the initials, T. M. Riddle, and Draco couldn’t for the life of him remember who that was. Distracted by his thoughts, he didn’t notice when his father turned his eyes to him- or rather- the book in his hands.
, it’s because he finally thinks it’s time to surround himself with... less poor people.” It was as if he was trying to soften the blow, but then decided against it.
Draco was shocked into silence. Where did this new found courage come from? But, Draco didn't kick the brunet out, surprisingly. It was a change from their usual interactions, but a welcome one.
Draco left the hospital wing after a small disagreement with Madam Pomfrey and it turns out the Harry Potter had followed him!!!! They were hittin it off until Theo comes and ruins everything🙄Theo and Harry bicker in front of God and everybody but most importantly Draco. On the train, Harry removes Draco from Theo’s compartment as they somehow became friends once more.*bruh sound effect* Draco, Harry, Hermione, and ❤️Ron❤️are in each other’s company. It ain’t cute 🙈
” Harry shouted back, eyes squeezed shut and fists clenched at his sides. The two boys glared at each other, chests heaving with their newly released anger. “Draco... no matter what you think, no matter what you’ve done..” Harry was getting closer now, taking soft, slow steps as if he was approaching a frightened animal. He set a hand on Draco’s arm, lightly squeezing when he was showed no resistance. “You deserve to have someone who actually acts like your friend.” They stood in silence, neither daring to say a word. Until Harry dared to do what Draco thought was the impossible.
are sneaking glances at him and Draco is ready to tear someone's hair out. Unsurprisingly, Potter opens his mouth first. Draco looks at Theo with the corner of his eye. Coward.
“That’s because yours and Nott’s business was Nott bullying you! While no one else did anything about it!” Harry snapped back, standing up right and glaring into Draco’s soul, “I don’t know why you’re so upset with me helping you!” They stood staring at each other until Potter took on a concerned expression. Oh jeez.
Theo had know idea as to what's happening, too focused on the excruciating pain coursing through him. Suddenly, his hair was yanked so he was forced to meet Draco's eyes. He was slapped.
"I'm sorry. I'm so so sorry. Please believe me, I- I," Theo couldn't finish his statement as he covered his face with his hands and slid to his knees, crying softly.
lmao never said i was making draco smart 💀 how do y’all feel abt the poem?? rate it for me lol 💃🏾✨ and also plz comment!! i love ur comments so much! ❤️
the power surged through him. Lights shattered, wand cases were thrown, the walls shook. Draco's eyes began to roll into the back of his head. It ended as quickly as it started. The occupants of the room stared at Draco in shock. How could so much power come from such a little boy? Draco wasn't paying any attention to them.
“You are vile and there is no way that Malfoy would ever go back to your sorry ass. Because Malfoy maybe the son of Voldemort,” Harry didn’t bother biting back his smirk when he saw Theo flinch, “Or maybe a Death Eater in training,” ‘Whatever the hell that is’ Harry thought, “But he in no idiot. And only idiots would go back to you.”
As Draco was walking back to the Slytherin common room, resenting how much he has to pack, a shadow of a person caught his eye. He turned and was met with Theo staring back at him. There was a tense silence as they stared at each other, neither knowing what to do. Draco was ready to turn away, as this awkward encounter was not helping anyone. He stopped, however, as a sudden realization came to him. He was
Draco’s eyes were fastened on his clasped hands in front of him, but managed to shake his head. The witch’s gasp rivaled his own. Everything was turning blurry fast. His head pounded, he barely heard the screams coming from... someone. He also barely registered the black tar coming out of his ears... and nose and mouth and - Merlin above - everywhere.
He got off of the abandoned desk he was sitting, only now realizing that this was the same classroom the incident happened. Fighting down a blush, Draco strutted over to where Potter’s lanky body sat. He stood in front of the other, trying to be subtle with his posing.
“And by the way,” Harry panted, hunched over while trying to catch his breath after running back and forth. “I still want to be friends!” He finished standing proud and tall.
“What in Merlin’s beard was that?!” Lucius was in shock, what he thought was going to be a sad display of a panic attack turned into something much more concerning.
Draco properly adjusted himself so he was no longer on the side of his bed. Theo climbed on next to him, closed the curtains, and proceeded to make himself comfortable.
"No, you're a- you're a! Um, you're the one who's- a- AGHH!" Speaking his mind did not mean that Theo was suddenly immune to the vicious glares thrown his way. Red faced, he stomped his way out the dorm, slamming the door shut.
After losing quite a number of points, the Slytherins were even more adamant in not helping Draco with the Lawnmart problem,
"You never want do anything anymore! It's always 'We should leave him alone' and 'Why do you care about him so much Theo'," Theo shoved Draco until the boy was firmly pressed against the wall,
He stopped his musing when his shoulder was softly hit. Harry looked up to see Draco smiling softly at him.
Theo took a step back from the whole display but soon scoffed and turned to Draco, "Hah, did you see th-" He stopped.
Draco thought and went back to his original seat, ready to relay these events back to Tom. But the hurried sounds of footsteps coming back stopped him in his tracks.
He was so focused on the Mafoy Lord, he didn't even notice the fuming McGonagall until, however, she made it very hard not to.
Theo began to fidget. He asked, "W-would you like to go outside?" Draco didn't say anything. He continued to look at Theo with dead eyes, and watched two red spots appear on Theo's cheeks. Before finally, one black word appeared above his head.
Draco, Theo, and Lucius went to Knockturn Alley. Draco got suspicious of a cabinet but couldn’t investigate as his father got to him first. Draco ventures off to Flourish and Botts by himself and has an awkward convo with Potter, watches his father get pummeled by an orange man, and takes his father’s belongings back from an orange girl
" He shouted as blinding white pain filled his body – he crumpled. Writhing on the floor as Draco seemed to float over him. When did he move?
Draco swallowed back the guilt in the severely hurt face he was looking at. As if Potter’s world lit up in flames right in front of him. He turned away, set on leaving.
He offhandedly listened to Granger’s lecture the boys most likely hadn’t gotten a word of. He decide to be a little more helpful that day and gave handy-dandy-very-readable subtitles for the long and wordy rant. Panting heavily, Hermione stuck her huge frazzled hair back into the compartment and gave a thanks to Draco.
However, the only reason Draco believed it wasn't Potter, was because he knew who was behind it all. When Potter told him about the voice in the walls, Draco knew Potter was referring to the Basilisk Tom was letting loose in the pipes, but just shrugged it off when asked about it. He told Tom about Potter confiding in him, which lead to a conversation Draco was hoping to put off for longer.
“The name sounds kinda familiar,” Theo said, smiling when Draco agreed. “Do you think he goes to Hogwarts?”
"Detention." McGonagall told them. Draco glared hard at Theo with tired eyes, wishing he could've stayed in bed instead. Huff, he just got out of detention with Snape too. The fact they
Harry gives Draco a poem pretty much confessing his love but both boys are very dumb and cowardly so he might as well not have 🙄
Draco’s arms went to the edge of the windowsill, and with all his strength he tried to lift the window open. However, the blasted thing didn’t budge. It was either because it was designed not to open, or Draco has a severe case of noodle arms
"Just answer!" snapped Theo, now angry and scooting farther away from Draco, to the point where he would fall off the bed if he went back any farther.
So now, Draco is sitting in his bed contemplating on what the hell to do now. He clearly won't be spending more time with him, why would he? But how would he get that through Theo's head? Theo. Who has gotten
“But you don’t mean that do you! You’re smart, Draco you must have already caught on! I’m sorry if my feelings toward you make you feel uncomfortable- it’s just that I think you are really cool, and nice to be around even if you wish Hogwarts went up in flames! So... um what I am trying to say is Draco-!”
The silence in the compartment was deafening, Ron’s red face stares out the window, refusing to acknowledge either boy in front of him. The two boys sitting next to each other couldn’t keep up a conversation, as it seemed that Draco wasn’t interested in any topic Harry chose. Hermione also didn’t seem to make an effort, she seemed content with just staring long and hard at the blond boy.
Caught, Malfoy turned slowly to Harry, his expression carefully blank but shoulders awfully tensed. Harry stopped in front of him wide-eyed and frazzled, it was most likely at this moment he realized he had no idea what he wanted to say.
“You’ll be needing this,” he said as he dropped Ginny’s book back into her cauldron. He turned with a flare, beckoned Theo and Draco to follow, and left the store without a second glance. Theo followed after him like a pathetic little lapdog.
Eventually after what seemed like hours, (and maybe even was) Draco had passed out from the exertion. The room was silent for no one knew what to say
“Wha-“ Immediately, Malfoy slapped a hand to his mouth, and for some idiotic reason, Potter did too. This interaction was just getting worse by the minute.
"Why on earth were you so violent with it?! Yes it was attacking me -and you only wanted to help! - but you could have handled that situation much better."
that is not true! There's no evidence! Clearly you are just as scared as everyone else and it's taking a bigger toll on you!"  His hands were gripped tighter and Theo's voice took on a stern note, as if he was accusing himself. Well, technically, Draco is blaming himself because he is the heir of the Chamber of Secrets. But, Theo doesn't know that.
After most the whole class chanted back, they began to get to work. There were many pitiful attempts to make a simple feather float. Gray eyes surveyed the room in disdain.
Harry was hyped. He had seen Draco and Nott avoid each other like the plague and knew this was finally his chance to get to, properly, speak to Draco. He was practically vibrating in his seat in the Great Hall, waiting for Draco to walk through the doors.
Draco was not happy with this, as predicted. However, he strangely didn’t feel as opposed to it as he thought he would. He gave a sharp nod. Hopeful that this wouldn’t somehow backfire greatly onto him.
"Aren't you going to attempt the spell?" Flitwick asked, not taking laziness from anyone. Draco lifted an eyebrow and raised his wand.
Draco registered the threat, but didnt think anything of it, as his brain was too mangled from the tears streaming down his face at a rapid speed.
With a flaming face, the platinum blond boy tried to keep up with the conversation, but that was almost impossible for him. He quickly got bored and went to take a seat. He had just noticed that people were starting to gather up inside. How he didn't realize this when he was in the entryway, he wasn't sure.
She continued to prattle on, asking about Theo, scolding him on his behavior in class, asking why Theo didn't like Harry because "That flying class could have gone without it".
Since the professors also think it's Draco, it means that their eyes are always on him. And he doesn't even get any solidarity from Snape just because of that one comment in first year.
" The raven haired boy yelled and was preparing to lunge at Theo. But he didn't see Draco slow down as he took in the sight in front of him, so mid-air he let out a shriek and dropped, clutching his forehead.
Theo always knew there was something wrong with his friend. Always knew Draco thought about death and torture, getting a disgusting glint in his eyes. Because of this, Theo immediately knew he had to grab Granger and get the
Draco is just being hella manipulated by Riddle yet he still fails to see it. Bodies start ending up in the infirmary. Secrets start being revealed~
"For someone who doesn't talk you sure as hell have a lot of sass." Pouted Theo. "Draco! We have to catch them in the act! They deserve to have points taken off for this because I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to stay out past curfew."
Draco was covered in blood from head-to-toe. More blood splatters him as the club bashes the trolls face in again, but he never flinches. He stands eerily still as he watches the trolls face become more and more deformed.
Moving back to Draco, he tried to carry the boy. The bleeding still going, regardless of the unmoving child. Theo tried to maneuver Draco in a way that won't stain his robes, but eventually resigned to the fact that that was near impossible. Carrying the child, he noticed the lack of weight he felt and a wave a guilt passes over him. He knew that Draco was skipping meals because of his work...
Draco glared at the person who dared to wake him up. Of course, it was Theo, who was shrinking back from the sheer force of his glare.
His stare was cold. Any warmth that could have been there was replaced with ice. Draco stares into the eyes of his father, holding his breath for the inevitable.
"It was me," Theo states, looking down, wincing at Pomfreys scandalized gasp, "It was me the whole time. I pushed Draco into hitting me the other day. He snapped under all the abuse I put in him, yet he was the one to get punished."
"Why do you care?" Theo winced as the question came out his mouth. That question even got Ron looking appalled.
He looked up and cried harder, the black had expanded, now fully covering Draco's eyes aside from a piercing red dot acting as the pupil.
Draco gave a shrug where he was seated, he learned to deal with Theo’s antics, they didn’t really bother him as much as he made it seem.
Last chap Harry and Draco get into a little fight about how deserves some real friends which results in Harry planting a WET one on Draco’s cheek
Draco huffed and rolled his eyes when Potter couldn’t give him a straight answer. Why anyone would choose him of all people was beyond him.
They shared a look between each other, turned back and shrugged. Draco rolled his eyes- well he attempted to, the wind was just too much. He decided that he didn’t have to trouble himself with this, he doubted he could be of much help anyway. With a mock salute, he started to recede back into the compartment when muffled shouts caught his attention once more. Sticking his head back out, he saw the both of them frantically shaking their heads and Potter gesturing “no” with his arms.
He also didn't go to any meals. Many people were sent to his bed to pry his curtain open, even the professors went up. But, there was this type of...
"Hey, Draco," Theo turned to the boy in mention, narrowing his eyes when Draco moved out of his touch.
She released the breath she was holding when there was no objection to the use of his given name. Straightening up, she continued, “Have you seen Harry or Ron on board? I can’t seem to find them anywhere.” She deflated when he gave a shake of his head, and turned around to leave. The moment the door closed behind her, Theo shot up from the floor and immediately began cursing her name from hell and back. Again.
McGonagall's face thundered, but Draco was too angry to care. He only continued to stare at the still crying child, hatred running through his veins.
Draco scoffed, it was making much more sense now. Obviously, Potter would never feel anything like that for him. Haha... yeah. So that comment about the parents really was absolutely unnecessary. Whoops...
“I’m sorry.. what? You’re asking me who it is?” Harry was baffled... there’s no way right? Draco was just pulling his leg...
use that phrase around others because you are a Malfoy and we can afford anything. Just go to your room, I’ll have a talk with you when I’m sober.”
Draco rolled his eyes and tried again, now realizing that he probably shouldn’t be distracted them from the...”road”. Ehh, too late.
Draco stared at him for two seconds before deciding he had better things to do, he turned on his heel, ready to go up to his dorm before he was stopped by Theo's call of "Wait!"
”Draco! How can you still sit in the same compartment as him after what he did to you?” Harry shouted. Draco’s face was burning; he strangely never thought he would be on the receiving end of Potter’s spats.
He dropped into his chair, looking dazed as he tries (and fails) to stifle a large burp. Draco stared at his father in horror and dropped his sandwich back on his plate, appetite disappearing in a flash.
Theo was moping around the castle, when suddenly a hand shot out at him and pulled him into a dark alcove. He was suddenly face to face with the one and only Harry Potter.
Theo was only more frazzled. Sighing, Draco gave two pats on his arm before quickly leaving the Hall, Theo scrambled to keep up and noticed that Draco was not following their prefect.   "Uh, Draco?"
It was silent, which would be normal if Draco was saying something, but no words filled the air. Harry's face softened, and his eyes shimmered.
He sprinted to her and grabbed her arm. "We have to go, get up." Hermione wasn't listening, her mind was fastened on the troll in the room. "Granger! Get up!" Theo was getting irritated, and, quite frankly, terrified, knowing Draco won't care if he has an audience.
His lack of expression when Theo shouted next to him, "Enemies of the heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
Confusion was evident on every face in the Great Hall, Draco's robes have turned green. He...he didn't even put the hat
Sneering at Harry, he grabbed Draco's arm and tugged him to the Slytherin table. Well, he tried to, before Draco yanked his arm free with a sneer himself and strode to the table. Embarrassed, Theo looked at Potter with pink cheeks to see a smug expression on the Chosen Boy's face.
Draco put the diary underneath his pillow, with out really knowing why, and drifted off to a dream full of green-eyed orphans.
What did he want him to do that was so outlandish that he had to resort to spell casting? Can Theo even cast a
The only person who didn't believe it was Draco, was Harry. He felt grateful that Draco stood by his side, when even Ron and Hermione began looking at him differently ever since he started talking about the "voice in the walls".
Potter! It just had to be! Well... no it really didn’t, considering the You Deserve Better speech he
Draco let out a scream and lunged towards him. And though the action took Harry into surprise, he was quick to dodge him, causing Draco to crash into a desk. Harry was obviously prepared for a fight, however, all Draco did was quickly shoot up, his face red from embarrassment.
“He won’t be able to hear this because he is in a coma, Nott. A coma! What kind of friend are you?! I used to think before was bad. You know back when you would push him against the wall, hit him until he was crying. What the hell was that for anyway?”
“Why,” Pomfrey huffed, “You would think as his father he would be the most outraged out of all of us.” She turned to Draco, who was paler than ever and still had small amounts of tar leaking from his eyes. “What a peculiar boy.” She mumbled and went to go clean him up.
People still gave the pair dodgy looks as they sat down for the Halloween feast. Theo was talking Draco's ear off about Merlin knows what when Professor Quirrel came bursting through the doors. Draco feels dark energy whenever he's in DADA, giving Quirrel flashing eyes that clearly say
With a blush and a snarl, Draco removed his wand from his robes and pointed it to the window. He ignored Theo’s mad dash out the door, fool probably thought he was planning on blasting it open. Draco sharply swished his arm up, and the window followed the movement. Proud of himself, the grey-eyed lad stuck his head out of the train.
Draco shook his head as he willed the traitorous thoughts away. This was no time to start doubting Tom, not when so many bodies have already made their way to the hospital wing. Draco didn't think so many was necessary though.
Last Chapter Recap: Lucius, Theo, and Draco went back the manor, where Theo and Lucius bash the Weasleys. But then Lucius sees Draco with the diary and tried to do something about it but just ends up being an alcoholic. Draco left the pathetic scene to go to a very mysterious red door. The room inside the door is not good ✨ Draco dreamt of werewolves, metamorphogi, and The Grim.
Harry didn’t know he was so passionate about this, but the more he spoke the more he realized how much of a terrible situation this was. Harry thought he should back away before he ended up giving Nott a spot next to Draco, but he just had to get his thoughts out.
"How dare you say such a thing, boy! 100 points from Slytherin, and year long detention!" The Professor shouted.
"UNBELIEVABLE!" She shouted turning red, "You made this young man suffer, at the expense of what may I ask?!" The professor's arms were cross, with her foot tapping on the ground repeatedly. She stared at Theo as if actually expecting an answer to come forth.
The blood, however, waa as thick as tar. It was getting caught in his throat, making it more difficult to breath. After a couple minutes of coughing, he dropped to the ground, unconscious. Theo scrambled away, ready to start screaming for help, before memorising the words said to him only moments before.
Theo had to spend the rest of the year with Filch and Hagrid for his detentions. He was sneered on in the hallways ,because news of what had happened somehow managed to spread throughout the castle.
Neither Malfoy acknowledged the mad scramble he made to the floo, as he vanished in a flash of green. They looked at each other, neither knowing what will come next. But then Lucius dropped with a heavy sigh.
Theo, of course, also heard and immediately stepped in to defend Draco. He slandered the Weasley name. Insult after insult until he offered Harry his friendship.
As Draco walked back to his dorms, he was met with frightened stares, small screams,and disgusted glances. So, nothing new really. But, Draco didn't register anything, keeping his head held high, he met everyone's judging stare with a glare of his own. He stopped.
Both Theo and Hermione turned their heads around at the sound of running feet and heavy breathing. Ron and Harry stopped in their tracks as they saw a trembling Hermione and scowling Theo.
It's not like Theo's being subtle about it, he would do it in a common room full of people. A higher year would step in, tell Theo to knock it off, but would only help under one condition...
Theo whipped his head to McGonagall so fast he's sure he got whiplash. Snape had a thunderous look on his face but refused from commenting. The Professors made their way to the loo when Theo's voice stopped them.
“He’s not... doing it again is he? But worse? Oh god I didn’t make it worse did I?! Oh no Draco, I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to I promise- I was just trying to help, it never occurred to me that Nott would take that as a personal offense-“ Harry forced himself to stop when Draco started banging the back of his head against the wall.
“Actually, we were hoping that you could tell us that, Mr. Malfoy.” Pomfrey said. Draco looked around and saw the concerned faces (minus one Lord Malfoy) of the people around him. He registered what Madam Pomfrey had said and tried to rack his brain for answers.
“You may be very uncomfortable with this request, but... would you mind saying something for me? It’s strictly for medical reasons!!” She added when Draco got an enraged look on his face.
"I think it is." Theo continued, spearing Draco with his stare. "So, to prove your friendship," He paused for dramatic effect.
He started rambling about how Draco wasn't going to do shit to him, because apparently they both knew who the alpha was in their duo.
He didn't know why he asked, the dog looked like a coward. His suspicions were confirmed when Hagrid said so. Theo was immediately next to him and though he really wanted to scoot in the other direction, Potter occupied that space for some odd reason. He's sandwiched between imbeciles.
Frustrated, he dropped the-boy-in-pain's arm and began to grip his wand. That is until, a centaur came barreling in and took care of the thing. Damn.
He sits silently in the train compartment while Theo rattles off about every little thing he did over the summer. It’s as if nothing crazy happened! No fights, no hospital visits, nothing! Draco gazed tiredly out the window, wondering what this year will bring him. His thoughts are interrupted by a knock on the compartment door. Before Theo can say anything the door swings open to reveal a frazzled looking Hermione Granger.
So, one day, he woke up at an ungodly hour, and left. The sun was barely up, he didn't know if this counted as staying up after curfew.
“You had the Nott boy tied around your finger. He was weeping all over the hospital ward, truly a pathetic sight. What did you do exactly to get him in such a state?” Lucius asks, sitting down and sipping a glass of brandy Draco swears was not there before.
Theo quickly pulled her back as Ron and Harry panicked. "What?! What is it, what's wrong?" Ron asked, frantic.
He was in a coma. Eventually waking up only to repeat the process of spitting out tar, breaking his back, and passing out.
"I'm tired of it, what do you like him or something? Aw Draco got a crush on the Savior, is that it?" Theo's voiced adopted a mocking edge as he hit Draco's chest repeatedly.
The bloody fool Lodbark has made it his personal mission to get Draco to speak. The only other thing he talked about during his Defense lessons (other than himself) was how Draco must be insecure of how his voice sounds and “There’s no need to be ashamed Mr. Malfoy, you may be a little young but, puberty hits us all in its own special way!”
" Exclaimed Nott, moving closer with worry in his eyes and a hand stretched out, as if he wanted to comfort Draco. Not only does Draco look like he's a part-time dementor, but because of his recent fight, he was sporting several bruises. The boy in question was confused- didn't they just go over this? Why would Theo come back just to spout the same nonsense as before?
Tom Riddle, huh? Wait wasn’t that... Draco flipped backed to the front of the book and- yes there it was. Tom Riddle was the
Harry did not. His face shone with happiness and a grin was spread wide against his features. He should probably tone it down, but he couldn’t be bothered.
times, most likely still guilty over the...“incident”, as he likes to call it. It made no difference to Draco, who steadily ignored the brunet each time he came over. The summer was really, a disappointment.
Draco paused. There's no way these were actually their names. He shrugged it off, unbothered. Despite trying to reassure himself, Draco did not reach for the journal, wanting to catch some rest. Tom had to do what was necessary, but damn was Draco tired. He fell into an uneasy sleep. Dreaming of red glowing eyes and screaming blond boys.
Theo wasted no time at all to start bawling. He wailed and wailed for Draco to get away from him, using this opportunity to push Draco away a little too hard.
That's it. Draco didn't feel the need to say anything further. Harry was clearly very puzzled at what just happened. Theo spotted the confusion and jumped to help, "Oh Draco doesn't like speaking, so he doesn't." It was an acceptable answer right? It was correct even. So
had the chance to get a word out, Theo was immediately on her. He spat every derogatory term he could think of, never taking a breath in the middle of his sentences. Hermione did not blink or falter once, and Theo ended up being the one to go down when she punched him across the face. He went to the floor with a thud, cradling his bruised face in his hands. This somehow did not convince the boy to keep quiet. Theo started to groan on and on about “Mudbloods being scum of the Earth, and how they all act like deranged animals”. Looking away from the distressed boy, Hermione turned her brown eyes toward an indifferent Draco. She blushed when he raised an eyebrow and stuttered out, “Um.. D-Draco..?”
Everyone stopped in their tracks as they took in the sight of a fuming McGonagall, seething Snape, and terrified Quirrel barreling to them.
Snape was the one that was consistently on his trail, and being his head of house, this made the task extremely easy for the professor. It was no surprise to the students when the hated Potions professor ended up in the hospital wing, unable to move. The students had many things they wanted to say about this piece of information as well, not many actually fearing for their lives like one thinks they would. Half of Hogwarts sees Snape's petrification as proof that Potter was the one behind this, since 'those two have had it out for each other since first year', 'But, so has he and Malfoy', the other side argues.
And just like that, happiness overtook Theo as he launched himself into Draco's arms. And they stayed in that position as Draco relayed the events of what happened from the start of the year. The journal, Tom Riddle, petrifying people, killing roosters, the whole nine yards. How he didn't have any energy due to the fact Tom was using him as a source, the plan to get rid mudbloods and half-bloods alike, so this disgrace of a wizarding world could finally be pure again. When he finished, he pulled back expected more looks of admiration and wonder but instead he got a pale face and wide eyes. Theo was not looking at him, but to the side as he attempted to process what he was told.
Hermione paused in her struggle from attempting to leave Theo's arms and whipped her head around so fast, Theo got a mouth full of hair.
“You are not going anywhere near him for the rest of this train ride. I don’t how you still can bare to be in his presence! Any time I hear that fools name I feel like punching a wall!” Harry stated.
There was a faint blush on the blond boy's cheeks, his head was tilted down, but he looked up at Harry through his platinum eyelashes.
i just wanna say sorry for taking actually forever to get this out. I was so uninspired i had no idea when this was gonna come out. But then i realized that I had comments that my email didn’t send me for some reason??? All of you guys were so kind and understanding it blew my away how much u all actually like this story!! Thanks so much for 12000 + hits! love u all! ❤️
He went back to the manor and told Lucius he didn’t remember what happened, Lucius told him he couldn’t read the subtitles fast enough and to speak verbally to him. Draco was very much not vibing with the idea and decided he was going to cause an earthquake. He was sent to his room when he stopped, and Narcissa and Lucius were like ‘????’ And that was it 🙈
Harry had somehow managed to forget that he came with the Weasleys, Grangers, and Hagrid. Judging by the expression on Draco’s face, he must of figured out who shouted that as well. Turning, Harry met the incredulous faces on the red heads.
Theo beamed and dragged Draco outside. Chatting excitedly on all the fun they could have. Draco went along.
His back arched off the hospital bed in an inhumane way. There is no way his body should be able to bit that type of angle. Each arch gets more an more intense until you could hear the pops of his vertebrae.
Some say it's Harry Potter, who was apparently a parseltounge. Right after the incident with the snake inside the dueling club, Justin was found petrified on the floor next to Nearly Headless Nick. They say Potter was angry at him for not being more grateful, and that Nick was just an unlucky bystander. When Colin was sent up to the ward, the school went in a uproar.
‘I don’t know. Maybe?’ Harry shifted onto his back and then wriggled across the bed until his side was pressed tightly against Draco’s front.
‘Merlin, woman, I’m not the only one who left it until the last minute,’ Ron said, defensively breaking Harry’s concentration from wondering if there were ways to give Hermione permission to read the books – assuming that was something Harry wanted. ‘I don’t see you badgering Harry,’ he went on forcing Harry to acknowledge the argument brewing between his friends.
The process of stripping the two Death Eaters (confirmed when he slid their robes up to check for the presence of the Dark Mark) of their wands and any other dangerous objects was tedious. He couldn’t have anyone accusing him of improperly handling the suspects while in custody because, while they wouldn’t release two Death Eaters Harry Potter had witnessed committing a crime, there were still plenty of people within the MLE who would be happy to put him away too on even the smallest of infractions.
Harry looked up at her, expression still amused over the words of the article. ‘Hermione, this article isn’t actually half bad. Look, it talks about the auror raid and the wards around the house. They talk about bringing Draco in as an expert as part of his parole. The two of us are barely mentioned. Honestly, did you even read the article? That headline is all about grabbing attention.’ Harry traced fingers over the headline and then down over the photo. ‘This is the most honest article that’s ever been written about me or Draco – it’s brilliant.’
Draco made an offended sound, but Longbottom laughed, ‘I don’t think we’ll ever be friends but thank you for apologising.’
‘You have a lot more friends and family than you realise, you know.’ Draco settled his head back on Harry’s shoulder, nudging a sneaky paw out of the way with his chin as he did so. ‘You have Andromeda and Teddy, the Weasleys and Hermione and Luna and Longbottom – I’m certainly never letting you go and, as horrifying as it sounds, even my father would fight for you now.’
His skills and power, though it frightened some of the younger members of the department (and caused any number of rumours about what he could do if he wasn’t under Ministry control – as if he was), was helping Draco to prove himself to a lot of the old timers who’d made it through the war and Smith’s cleansing. Mendenhall had gone so far as to smile at him at one point which went a long way to winning over the rest of the aurors. Bill’s respect for him and Mustafa’s no-nonsense acceptance of his knowledge and skills had won the curse breakers over much faster than Draco could have predicted.
‘How is that good?’ Weasley demanded, attention drawn away from Draco’s feet and his best friend’s hands – which were working a magic of their own, though Draco wasn’t about to voice that out loud. ‘There were a hundred people in and out of the castle over the summer – McGonagall mentioned it to Bill.’
Ron was fifteen again. In the blink of an eye he was all insecurities and awkward words and frankly he bloody hated it.
The grimace of distaste that crossed both Mendenhall and Mustafa’s faces once Harry had translated his words told Draco they knew exactly what that said about the Carrows and the sort of spells, traps and curses they were likely to stumble across. Quick and nasty, with a foundation in blood and bodily fluids that would make them stronger despite their crude creation. Witch bottles did not take great skill to create and as longs as they remained sealed and spelled, they could last centuries buried beneath the earth. That didn’t even touch on the madness a broken witch bottle could create.
‘Yeah,’ Harry said, and there wasn’t a trace of sarcasm in his voice when he added, ‘let’s do that.’
At which point Carter managed to demand an explanation in the form of, ‘But he’s Draco Malfoy!’ while his sister was nodding in wide-eyed agreement at Harry and their father was finally taking notice of the meeting taking place practically beneath his table.
‘The Carrow family has owned this property for centuries,’ Draco explained. ‘Haven’t you noticed how much older the magic is the closer to the house we get?’ He waited while Harry shook his head. ‘I don’t think this was just the work of the last war, I think this has been centuries of psychotic Carrows branching further and further out to protect their land.’ Voicing aloud the next part was mostly so that someone else could share his worries and not because he thought it would do him any good. ‘I think there are going to be Dark spells closer to the farmhouse that have been lying in wait for centuries – I’m not sure we’ll even recognise some of them.’
It had warmed Draco’s heart to know that Harry had so strongly defended him even if it meant watching his first friend walk away from him. It had not warmed his heart to hear the words that Weasley had thrown in his face when he’d gone looking to explain more, to hopefully help his friend understand. It hadn’t gone like any of them had been expecting.
When the sketch was finished, he added a quick note on the bottom and signed it. He thought she’d appreciate the fairy tale euphoria of his simple words. The soft emotion he was conveying would say more than if he started with an apology, with rambled (though heartfelt) words and excuses. This was different, it was an olive branch in the form of a truth and one he knew she’d never be able to resist asking questions about.
It was Draco’s turn to be taken aback but he recovered much faster than Harry, who in this instance wanted to giggle. He straightened as best he could and offered an impressive bow, given he was crouched down to look beneath a table. Harry had never had occasion to see Draco in full stuck up Lord mode, with the fancy suit (and robes) and manners being paraded about, but he had a horrible feeling he’d find it just as attractive as he found it when Draco pulled his arrogance around him at Gringotts.
Harry reached to untie the knot, but he was too late, he had only enough time to shoot Draco a betrayed, ‘You bastard,’ before the tugging behind his navel tore him away from Hogwarts and straight to the atrium at the Ministry.
For some reason, he imagined whatever relationship they had would have crumbled the next time he bumped into Draco. He knew himself well enough to know that he’d have spent the next week ranting and grumbling about the arrogant git until Ginny had enough of him and told him to just go and talk to Draco and he knew that would be the start of something they couldn’t come back from.
Ron might have been amused too but he had no idea what the fuck was happening. And he still didn’t understand why Malfoy was there. Weren’t they supposed to be meeting Harry’s wife?
Harry shakes his head and it feels like a turning point in the conversation. ‘I’m bi. I think. I don’t know. Ginny you know what I’m like when it comes to Draco. He just sort of consumes me, he’s an obsession.’
After all this time, after so much pain and destruction, the death of Tom Riddle was a bit anticlimactic.
Draco did it anyway. Because Harry was right, he was the best person for this job. He’d always been the best person for the job and as little faith as he had in Harry’s plans, Draco had plenty of faith in Harry.
…Salazar that was an alarming thought. Draco had no doubt Harry had never even seen his parents will, let alone considered the ramifications of its contents. Another thing Dumbledore and the adults in his life had kept from him which meant more paperwork that Draco just knew he was going to end up wading through. This was why he liked curse breaking, there wasn’t any bloody paperwork. Research and dry old magical texts, yes, but they were interesting, financial paperwork the goblins handed him was dull even when it meant more gold in his accounts.
She needed to hate Draco because if she didn’t then she needed to acknowledge that Draco was everything that Harry wanted and needed and that when she’d turned her back on her best friend, Draco had been there building him back up stronger and surer than he’d been before.
‘What’s a bloody stupid idea?’ Ron asked, dropping onto the bench beside Harry at the end of the Hufflepuff table.
The first spell fired at him came from one of the wizards behind the car and was easy to deflect. He simply smacked it casually away with an air of bored indifference. He jabbed his wand carelessly back and didn’t waste time watching the way the soft purple light slid under the car to wrap around both of the hiding wizards. It wasn’t a nice spell, quite a nasty one actually, there was a good chance he’d get yelled at for using it if no one knew the counter-spell but it was exactly the sort of spell he needed right then.
Hadn’t he once tried to explain something like it to Hermione – and with Ginny’s help? But here in this moment it was something silly, something that was completely removed from the ridiculous pureblood ideology that had driven so many witches and wizards to join Voldemort. There was a very large somewhat sentient plant on the other side of the conservatory door and Draco and Luna took it as expected but Harry was caught off guard.
, but he started to see the torn and frayed edges of it all. He started to see the madness in tasking a child with something the Dark Lord himself had never managed. He started to see the punishment where before he’d only seen trust and honour and glory. He started to understand the fear and his own arrogance, and he learned what it meant to break. It was slow to happen, he couldn’t believe it – didn’t want to believe it. He didn’t want to believe that everything he’d once believed was wrong and twisted and that being a Death Eater and bearing the Mark was not all he had been promised, all he had hoped.
But she took him to be muggle – or at the very least muggle-born – because wizarding fashion had come a long way but there were still noticeable tells. She and Rose arrived by the train just as he was releasing two of the three children with him toward the train. Hermione only caught the back of a black head of messy hair and long red tresses as the two kids hopped up onto the train without a backward glance. She thought she heard the man mumble something about ungrateful children and homesickness, but Rose distracted her with another nervous question.
‘Have you noticed anything odd with Hermione?’ Harry asked, not bothering to look up from where he was slowly – and carefully – painting the nails on Draco’s left hand.
‘Would you stop getting distracted,’ Draco grumbled, grabbing Harry’s arm to start him up the next set of stairs. ‘Mary Avery was mid-breakdown when she gave her lecture on preventative charmwork – from what I remember Albert O’Keefe had just broken her heart and NEWTs were a real struggle for her. She wasn’t in the mood to give a proper educational speech about safe sex.’ Draco considered the terrifying hour-long lesson he and his classmates had been subjected to in one of the dungeon classrooms and felt his lips twitch with amusement. ‘Looking back, the whole thing is actually quite hilarious – though not nearly as fun as the year Daphne and I had to do it.’
Harry sighed, dropped his chin to his chest and just took a moment to remember why he’d thought this was a good idea. With Draco’s smirk (not his smile – again, things about Harry that should probably be discussed with a mind healer) fixed firmly in his mind, Harry lifted his chin and stepped into the vault. Ron followed after him and immediately took a seat on the fancy looking loveseat right inside the door on the left. The thing was probably five hundred years old, if not older, and had clearly been placed in the vault by a wary spouse, fed up with just standing around while the other half got on with the poking about.
‘A mushroom cloud of magical death,’ Harry deadpanned, seeming rather bemused by the whole thing as opposed to the quietly terrified atmosphere leaching out of the other members of the MLE behind them.
It was enough though, her words finally forced meaning into her husband’s and with a short sharp snap of his wand he released the protections he’d put up without thought. It was just unfortunate they were apparently what had been keeping him upright. He hadn’t even realised he was holding them in place, he’d done it instinctually. Now that he’d cut the burden of holding them in place from his own magic all of his injuries were making themselves known in vibrant technicolour and some of them came with blinding agony.
If she said all that to Ron, though, she feared it would give him even more reason to continue hating Draco and she didn’t want to push him either way. She didn’t want to tell him how much he’d changed or how much he’d stayed the same. Ron needed to see that for himself, needed to see it more than he already had, and only then would he be able to decide if he wanted to forgive Draco – or if he even should. Because it wasn’t up to her and it wasn’t up to Harry.
Harry would have liked nothing more than to shed his clothes and go another round. But they were running out of time. Draco was supposed to be in London taking part in a raid and Harry was supposed to be at Hogwarts planning their next counterattack.
‘I’m going to send a letter to Pansy,’ he decided, changing the subject. ‘I’d like her to hear it from me, not the papers. Although,’ he grinned, ‘the look on her face might be worth the surprise.’
Comically, she almost collided with Madam Pomfrey, as they tried to take the corner at the same time. Pomfrey only offered a vague apology as she scuttled around the headmistress to get to the gaping hole and her buried patients.
Harry nodded. ‘We don’t always have training or jobs when we leave the castle and we were home for two weeks over Christmas, remember? We even made the papers at Halloween.’
Draco, who had seen the Weasel eat, could believe it. ‘I’m not even dressed,’ he protested – half-heartedly as he’d already starting to scramble out of bed. He was always up for an excuse to get some nice food away from the Manor. ‘Give me ten minutes.’
She wanted to understand the bond and by extension Harry’s ability to forgive Draco because she – ‘Oh,’ he said aloud, realising suddenly what this was really about. ‘You should hate me.’ He looked at Hermione with sudden painful understanding.
The shouted command came from behind and although there was no reason to think it was meant for him, the voice was deliciously familiar, and his body reacted without much input from his brain. Draco ducked and a spell shot through the air where his head had been only moments before. The sickly yellow spell tore straight through the parked car, gouging deep grooves into the metal. The impact had all the windows exploding outward and Draco turned his head to avoid the shower of glass.
He’d have to see if he could get a copy of the original photo. And perhaps one of their last appearance on the front page too.
Hermione had sorted that one out and Sprout, who had witnessed the clean-up, suggested in a friendly tone that perhaps they shouldn’t be gossiping about things they didn’t understand. She’d patted Harry on the shoulder and told him Draco would be just fine, leaving him feeling rather fond of her but Ron rather confused.
Draco winced. He debated the wisdom of it for a moment before he decided that this had been a morning for revelations and Granger really was likely to be of some help, so he simply leant against Harry and licked a quick stripe up the side of his neck. There was a beat of silence in which Granger made a startled noise and Harry shivered pleasantly against him before the runes rose again to the surface of Harry’s skin.
But he was trying. Ron was trying and he loved and adored (possibly worshipped) Hermione and had for years. Just because he and Ron weren’t currently speaking didn’t mean Hermione had to completely shut him out. She’d been mad at him – for good reason – but she loved him, and Harry wouldn’t begrudge her wanting to stand by him as he worked through the layers of insecurities and self-doubts – and the anger – that had him spouting off horrible words. Because the fact that he was trying was something that even Harry – who was still more inclined to dislike him – supported.
He'd only just started to roll the sleeve of Death Eater #3’s robes up to check for the presence of a Dark Mark when the crack of apparition filled the square announcing the arrival of the Ministry team. With a sigh, Draco stowed his wand in its holster, raised his hands to show he was unarmed and took three large steps away from the chained Death Eaters.
Ron had left before. He’d probably leave again. It wasn’t Harry’s fault. It was never Harry’s fault and he was done caring that he might lose his oldest friend just because he loved
Draco thought longingly of the hot shower he’d been planning to have. The delicious glide of soapy wet skin against his own and sighed. He couldn’t – wouldn’t – ask Harry to abandon his friend when she was so upset.
Arthur Weasley was waiting for him. He offered Harry a cheerful smile which turned to a chuckle when he noticed Harry’s expression. ‘Ah. Well, Draco did say he’d trick you if he had to.’ Arthur sounded wholly unperturbed that Draco Malfoy had tricked Harry Potter into wearing a portkey which told Harry several things, most of which just made him more annoyed.
He really didn’t remember how that argument had ended so well in his favour, but he thought it might have had something to do with the way Harry liked looking at his arse in muggle jeans.
Luna hadn’t bought his lies and half-truths during the trials and his stay in Azkaban, but she’d also never pushed him for more than he was willing to tell. She’d just made sure she was always there when he needed her and arranged things so that when he wanted to tell someone something, when he wanted to let himself feel, Harry had been there. She seemed to always know when he needed to talk and, somehow, she was always knew what he needed.
‘Hi,’ Harry choked out, voice thick with emotion and it was a wonder he could even see the portrait through the tears forming in his eyes. They threatened to spill over as he reached careful hands into the box to remove the heavy wooden frame containing the animated form of an older man in his late sixties, hair just as wild and dark as Harry’s with soft brown eyes and a wide grin Draco had seen time and time again on Harry’s own face.
Draco frowned at the way Hermione said “Slytherins”, but he nodded all the same. ‘They need to make amends and this is how they do it.
It was weird that he was okay dealing with Ron in this respect. He didn’t like him at the moment, but he could be objective about his relationship with Hermione. Or more accurately, Hermione’s relationship with him. Likely, the ease came from the vindictive knowledge that Ron was doing a decent job of ruining his chance of happiness.
He took the opportunity to glance quickly to the other side of the street to see the aurors were still holding their own against the witches, although they didn’t seem to have made it any closer to the house. The aurors were clearly stood on the road, firing their spells toward the witches on the lawn, leaving a sizeable gap between the two that no one seemed willing to breach.
‘Still got both my eyebrows,’ Ginny declared with satisfaction after a quick grope of her own face to check.
Draco wasn’t sure he believed Bill then and he was even less sure now after a letter from his mother expressing how much she enjoyed getting to know Harry’s chosen family. She’d delighted in telling him about their discussion and how Molly had spoken rather highly of Draco’s role in improving Harry’s mood and his grief. There’d been no mention of the fact that Molly had killed Aunt Bella, no mention of any topics at all that might have put strain on their relationship.
But she’d taken hold of him and swept him inside and she’d listened as he babbled and ranted and sobbed and apologised. Merlin, he’d apologised again and again for not helping Draco sooner, for not stopping Voldemort sooner, for a lot of things, most of which he still doesn’t remember.
Ron’s shoulders slumped and he looked small and defeated – quite a feat given his height. ‘I never meant to hurt him.’
He watched the whole thing, strangely detached. He heard Pomfrey behind him scuttling away to meet the girls in the Hospital Wing, but he didn’t really understand what was happening until Ginny’s hand dropped softly on his shoulder and she asked him if he needed her to get him out too.
Harry knew, of course, about the missing antler tip; he’d seen the evidence and kind of liked Draco’s view on it. He liked the idea that the stag had been through and won a fight. Again, he didn’t say that, what he did say was, ‘He got tired of other people marking him -  Voldemort with the Dark Mark, Gladys at prisoner intake in Azkaban (that one’s on his hip in case you were wondering) – he wanted something of his own. He chooses things and people that have meaning for him.’
It wasn’t, and he knew that now, but that didn’t mean that it didn’t hurt to realise how wrong he was, how complicit he’d been in an event that robbed Harry of the one true family member he’d had.
‘Of course, we have,’ Hermione snapped, although she gave an apologetic guilty smile immediately after as though she hadn’t meant to snap.
He supposed, though, he should have realised that the night before they were due to make an appearance at the Burrow – and they were still going, Weasley be damned – would be when Harry was finally ready to talk about it. Nothing like leaving these things until the last possible moment.
He waited for the waitress to come and get their drink orders before he broached the topic of his disappearance from the Burrow. Hermione seemed honestly more fascinated by the way Harry’s tattoo of Sirius had acted as a warning system and that they’d
Harry’s tone was thoughtful – hurt – but there was a sense of acceptance to it now that Draco was relieved to hear. He didn’t exactly mourn the loss of Weasley, but he was Harry’s oldest – and until this last week – best friend. Draco could be upset for Harry while also being thrilled not to have to deal with the Weasel. That didn’t mean he also hadn’t been expecting Harry to be more upset. Three nights of horrific nightmares notwithstanding, Harry had been remarkably calm about the actual departure of the Weasel.
For a moment he just looks at Draco. Draco, who is curled up on the couch, deeply immersed in a file making notes. Draco who looks up with a smile when he hears the floo.
If Harry had been aiming to hurt, his comment fell very short of the mark. Amused, Draco said, ‘I much preferred all the sex, thanks.’
He was in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom and it was sixth year. He’d been following Malfoy all year and now he knew it was the moment, this was the one chance he would have to confront him and find out once and for all what he was up to. It was finally his chance to prove to everyone that he wasn’t just obsessing over nothing, that Malfoy really was up to something.
While he’d been talking with Kreacher, Harry had guided Granger to the end of one of the tables and got her seated before he’d slipped around to sit across from her. Draco sat beside Harry and folded his arms on the table as Harry reached out to take both of Granger’s hands in his.
Both times, Harry had been with a more experienced partner. Ginny had taken control the first time and Draco had done much the same their first time too. That had taken some of the pressure off Harry – some but not all. Merlin, the first time he’d fucked Draco could have been a disaster, but it had been almost reassuring knowing that if Harry was doing a shite job of making Draco feel good that his boyfriend was perfectly willing – and capable – of rolling him over and just showing him exactly what he wanted.
Bellatrix crowed in triumph. She rolled up her sleeve to summon her master and Draco hit her from behind with the sharp green of a Killing Curse. Harry surged up, slamming the palm of his hand into Lucius’s nose, driving cartilage up in a perfect strike. He fell boneless to the floor but Harry felt no guilt. Draco didn’t even look back.
The words hurt, more so because they were something he’d been considering for a while. Something he’d had to come to terms with when he started building friendships with Harry and Luna – even grudgingly with Ginny and with Bill through their work.
He snatched his hand away. Harry caught it and brought it to his chest with both hands. ‘I love you,’ he said, firmly. ‘I’d snog you in any alcove in this castle and all the broom closets. Don’t let yourself think about this. You’re shields are too good to get caught up in this kind of magic.’
‘There really isn’t a lot you can do in a cell in Azkaban and so we talked – about everything. Draco and I have always known a lot of things about each other – all those stupid things you can’t help learning about someone when you spend all of your time staring at them.’ He ignored Hermione’s amused laugh and carried on talking. ‘But there was a lot we didn’t know and so much I wanted to know. I don’t know how it started exactly but once we started talking it was really hard to stop. Like I wanted to know everything about Draco – and he wanted to know everything about me.
‘I…can’t actually argue with that even without knowing how other wizarding schools do it. I’m betting they didn’t have a different teacher every year for one of their classes and – don’t tell Hagrid I said this – but they probably have properly qualified teachers. And definitely not someone as terrible as Trelawney.’
Somewhat bemused – how was this his life now? – Draco shut the door behind him and then scuttled back to bed because he, unlike Harry, was not wearing socks and the stone floor was positively icy. Huddled in the blankets, perched on his bed, Draco raised an expectant eyebrow at Longbottom while Harry finally managed to get his joggers up passed his knees and started digging through the wardrobe for a jumper.
It was, Draco had come to discover, surprisingly hard to make a surprised “huh” sound in Parseltongue but he thought Harry grasped what the sound he issued was meant to be. ‘That, I was not expecting.’
In between sobs, huddled on Hannah’s borrowed bed, he’d gotten the whole story out. How Harry had gone to tell Weasley the truth about their relationship in full, with the details he’d walked out without hearing, the ones that would hopefully have given him a chance to understand this wasn’t something they’d gone into lightly or a ploy by Draco. He’d pulled the details out of Harry bit by bit about Weasley’s words and his shameful actions.
‘We went to see him,’ he found himself telling her, though he rolled his head to the side to look out the grimy window. ‘Wanted him to know the truth so he couldn’t use it – or have it used against him.’
But it didn’t go like that and when Draco reacted violently, trying to curse Harry for seeing him in such a weak moment, for seeing him and being angry and sharp and not understanding, Harry struck back. He used a curse he didn’t know based solely on a little note without realising that Malfoy wasn’t his enemy. He wasn’t his nemesis or whatever childhood ridiculousness had blinded Harry to the truth of a broken boy, terrified of losing his family.
Draco nodded and Harry, after eyeing Pansy carefully, slipped out of the booth. He and Pansy remained quiet for a moment, both watching Harry’s path across the pub and out the door – he didn’t pause to look back, the trust he had in Draco implicit in the sureness of his steps.
The chintzy mug had been Harry’s idea, explained away as a muggle thing that he knew Andromeda would appreciate.
Harry wasn’t stupid and he’d become a lot more observant since the war ended – probably something to do with not spending half his subconscious and his power on holding back a piece of Voldemort's soul – he could recognise that when Hermione had first realised the truth of his and Draco’s relationship that she’d still strongly disliked him. That she honestly had probably still hated him. But Hermione had seen how much Draco meant to Harry and she’d understood that pushing him would mean losing him and so she’d bitten her tongue and she’d sat back and she’d watched. And while he couldn’t say she was ready to call Draco friend, he did know that she could see the changes in him and was, in all likelihood, going to take that step one day.
‘You hadn’t slept in two days,’ he murmured into the side of Harry’s neck, remembering the way he’d gingerly wrapped arms around Harry in that cell and the way Harry had stiffened before he couldn’t hold himself together anymore and the last threads had let go before he’d buried his face in Draco’s shoulder and sobbed.
He didn’t find any. Not on his first check anyway, but the second series of spells he ran through flared an alarming purple and he fought the instinct to leap backward for the relative safety of the damaged Muggle Studies classroom.
Harry wasn’t going to enjoy it. That didn’t mean he wasn’t going to do it. He’d stood by and watched people curse Draco before, little things that Draco refused to let him do anything about. He’d stood by when Draco’s guilt made him think he deserved to be cursed and attacked but he would not stand by and witness this.
When he turned to his other side he was treated to a similar scene. The junior auror was stood, feet apart and wand held aloft as he performed a shield charm that blossomed around his curse breaker partner. The shield bloomed out and shrank down in a natural flow that, only after scrutinising it for long moments, Draco could see the break in the motion.
Granger hesitated, eyes darting between Draco and Harry before she said, ‘It can. But Harry, everyone is already talking about that duel yesterday, people are going to start asking questions.’
‘The Malfoy boy is dead,’ Kingsley repeated and there was a strange undercurrent to his words that Harry might have mistaken for grief but that couldn’t be right, no, it must be anger because Malfoy was locked away in a holding cell and the only people who had access to him down there were…
Draco, Harry had realised, enjoyed buying people things and now he did it because he liked the people he was buying for not because he enjoyed flaunting his wealth – although he did still enjoy that. He was allowed to be happy and proud of his money without tying it to blood purity. He was, after all, still a posh git.
Pansy to see that. They might not be close but he was beginning to think that was on him, that he’d been so driven to be the spitting image of his father that he hadn’t realised how little he knew about being a good friend.
The war had broken them but, in the aftermath, they’d pieced each other back together, sharing all those broken parts and learning how they fit together to make a stronger whole. Draco knew and understood Harry in ways Hermione and Ron would never be able to. In a way Harry was beginning to realise, he didn’t want to them to.
‘What if I’d known?’ Harry mused, smiling at Draco and eliciting a snort from Ginny who was familiar with their game of what-if.
‘Uh,’ Joseph stuttered before he seemed to realise he was the one in control and stepped up beside the two. ‘As you lot keep telling me you’ve fought in a war, I’m not going to insist on using proper duelling rules. I want an accurate demonstration of what you’re capable of. Show me why it is you find my class so boring.’
Ron deflated like an old balloon, shoulders dropping, colour draining back out of his face and he said, ‘Oh.’
Neville was covered in dirt and looked as though he’d just spent the last few hours happily absorbed in the greenhouses. He smiled cheerfully at them all, not seeming to notice the subdued air in the room and made a beeline for the stairs and a quick shower.
And really, it was Harry who had to do the hardest part. He had to replace the hair and blood and magic in the ritual with Draco’s own and he had to do it without anyone noticing. All Draco had to do was waltz in at the last moment, toss aside the cloak and hope like hell the timing was perfect and the ritual worked because, if it didn’t, he was going to end up dead.
There, like an absolute mad-man, stood Draco. Wand clutched at his side to the point it looked like it'll snap and eyes bright as he took in the sight before him.
Theo couldn't stop a little snort, which was fine because he wasn't the only one. "Tell me Potter, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
The wing was frantic, Pomfrey, McGonagall, and Malfoy Sr. crowded around his bed. All frantically waving their wands at an attempt to help to no avail. Theo was off in a corner. Shaking and whimpering as he took in the sight before him.
“Draco!” A hand clasped onto his wrist stopping him from making any further movement. The boy looked up to his fathers steely eyes and hard scowl.
After getting his laughter out the way, Draco gave a thumbs up and a wink to Potter, which smacked the blush right back in his face. Not giving himself a chance to think about it, Draco went back to his compartment to go and look for Granger. It was surprisingly easy, as the girl was still miraculously looking for the two missing boys.
Theo looked past Potter to stare hard at Draco, stupidly thinking that he was going to whole heartedly agree.
"Mr.Malfoy," Snape stated feebly. He went unheard, as the club continued to ruin(almost) everyones day.
Draco went back to observing everything when a strange glint from a cabinet caught his eye. Not thinking, Draco crept forward towards it, his hand outstretched to pull the door open waiting to see-
"No need to be so rude! And we shouldn't be using that type of language! Honestly. I'm Hermione Granger, that witch you saved from the troll. About that troll..."
Draco lied. It was clear that Theo didn't believe him, but, astonishingly, he didn't push the topic. "Draco, " Theo said slowly, softly grabbing his hands and staring straight into the blond's eyes. Bite mark on display for the world to see. Draco was stunned from the adoration that swam in the brown irises. Never in all his life has Nott looked at him like this, and it made him wonder what the
Moving closer, he gripped Draco's shoulder with strength that was sure to leave bruises. Draco couldn't do much about it, because even if he had his terrifying exterior and attitude, the bloke was just skin and bones. While Theo wasn't exactly going to the gym everyday, he still had more meat on him than Draco.
"What were you dreaming about anyways? I couldn't get you to wake up for ages… " Theo questioned, making his way onto the bed and throwing the covers over the both of them. He reached to closed the curtains and turned back to Draco, waiting for his answer as if he didn't just make himself feel at home.
Harry must have sensed his agitation and tried to quickly back pedal. “I’m sorry! You probably don’t like speaking about it much, because it was, er,  pretty traumatizing to be honest. Which you probably already know! ‘Cause it happened to you and all and you would know whether or not it was traumatizing, unless you don’t think it was! Then I’m sorry for-“
Draco refused to acknowledge what was going on behind him (he sped up) but he let what Theo said sink in. That was
that you would know more about Mr. Borgin, if you weren’t a pathetic little-“ it’s... it’s not important.
So, obviously, he confronted Potter. Just like before, he snatched Potter away from his group of idiots and threw him into an abandoned classroom. Draco locked the door with a swish of his wand, grabbed the poor flustered boy by his necktie and yanked him close. They were
Draco stood in a flash, startling Theo who was watching him with a careful eye. “Draco, what is it?!” He tried to invade Draco’s space so he could look out the window as well, but Draco pushed him back, eyes still trained on proof of the lack of brains inside Gryffindors.
, he thought himself. He had to admit, it was nice book. Boring yes, but classy. That’s when he caught the words on the front.
to try and take his book that he, slapped her hand, closed his book, pulled it to him, and gave her the dirtiest look known to man kind.
On the train ride back, it was almost as if nothing crazy happened. Theo was chattering non-stop only; he would occasionally stop so he could let Draco have a couple of inputs in. Maybe the whole year finally did some good. Oh, and the fact that Harry Potter came checking on him. When he slammed open the compartment door with an enraged look on his face, neither Draco nor Theo knew what was going to go down. Draco settled back in his seat, ready to watch Potter yell at the boy across from him. However, when Potter turned his red face to meet his own, he froze.
Theo was shocked at the turn of events, barely registering the shove he got which slammed his back to the door.
Draco gave a sigh. The things he does for other people. He turned back to their worried expressions and asked:
And stared back into glowing green eyes. Neither made any thought to move, simply looking at each other. They gathered a crowd even though neither had any intention of fighting each other. Finally Draco took a step forward. It earned a gasp from the crowd, many had their hands hovered over their wands. Some, already pointing theirs at Draco.
Potter’s face was flushed, his eyes seemed to be everywhere but Draco’s face. They both stood there in silence, Harry twitching and fidgeting about- but most importantly-
Draco's face contorted into sadness, his body crumbling down as he put his knees up and covered his face with his hands.
Draco thought he was going to burst a blood vessel from this annoying stubborn Gryffindor, yet Potter stood there, hip still stupidly cocked and expression smug.
Draco swung open the bathroom door right as both Granger and Theo shrieked. There was the big ugly brute, swinging his club like an
“He probably won’t ever get to hear that though,” the words hit Theo deep, but he did nothing but stare at the ground angrily.
my favorite thing is Draco does not know who anyone's name is,, I'm sure y'all can figure them out lol
While Draco was thinking, Potter was busy yapping about how “Yes I was absolutely a messenger” and “Yes I do need to get some dignity” and “Yes the only feelings I have for you are friendship feelings haha!”
Draco snapped his mouth shut as a groan was heard from further in the room. He snapped his head in the direction and there he spotted Harry Potter. Draco felt instant shame in himself at his stupidity, thinking that this was a trap the whole time. He glowered at Madam Pomfrey who went to hover over Potter, not taking any notice at the now hurt and offended blond child.
Harry, who was heavily scolding himself for such thoughts, startled as Mr. Granger cleared his throat.
Draco turned his attention back to the window, thinking about what the brown-haired girl had said. Where could Potter have gone? And the other one of course. His thoughts strayed towards Potter, unanswered questions popping up. Why was the Chosen one of all people so...
"Argh!" Theo shouted, and yanked Draco back in his seat. However, instead of Draco looking scared and intimidated, he just had a look on his face that said 'really?'.
He slammed the door of the empty classroom he finally found shut and rested against it, (hopefully) preventing Harry from leaving.
” Lucius yelled, getting up off his chair and in Draco’s face. Wine hit the blond boys nostrils and harshly reminded him that there was alcohol involved. Theo, who was in the background watching the exchange warily, perked up at the idea of Draco
“Draco! Snap out of it!” His shoulders were being shaken. Blinking back into focus, he sees his father crouched before him, voice frantic and eyes... scared?
Theo hauled the boy onto the hospital bed, looking around for Poppy when he realized she wasn't inside.
He opened his mouth, to be honest, his mouth did feel a little dry. Maybe it’s because he just came out a long ass sleep and hadn’t been offered any water yet.
“Why,” Lucius started, barely able to get the word past his clenched teeth,”Do you have that book, boy?” The fury in his face was so terrifying, Draco wasn’t sure if he would leave this interaction unscathed.
i’m SO UPSET BECAUSE I WANTED DRACO TO HAVE A LARGER TEXT SIZE BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO THAT ON AO3 AND I TRIED LOOKING IT UP BUT IT WAS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKSKINS AND I TRIED BUT THEY DIDNT WORK IM SO SAD 😩😩
And with those partings words, the dwarf flew off, most likely on its way to terrorize another poor student, not even caring about how his actions traumatized Draco for life. He stood, frozen in the doorway, mouth agape and eyes bugged out. If his mother saw him he would be getting a sharp reprimand. But it was just him. Him and...
This was going to hurt but it was a necessary hurt. Crouching to the floor, Draco sliced open his palm again, figuring the quickest and dirtiest break would be best for this kind of ward. The way it seeped into every bit of the house suggested the wards had been set further in the past than the Dark Mark ward had led them to believe. That was something they could deal with later. For now, Draco slapped his hand against the ugly brown carpet and snapped out a spell – another that wouldn’t reflect well on him, he was sure.
Hermione may not understand his relationship with Harry, why Harry would want anything to do with him or even why he’d been able to forgive Draco all his past sins, but she understood that she didn’t need to understand it to know that they were good for each other. Draco also thought she was looking back on their time at Hogwarts in a new light and finding certain interactions suddenly questionable and most definitely full of subtext.
Something about the way he’d said it, about the clear way the simple fact of his feelings (and who they were directed at) annoyed him, caused Arthur to chuckle and Molly had finally released him to smooth back his hair and brush some imaginary lint from the shoulders of the old t-shirt he’d been sleeping in.
Draco, being Draco, felt zero need to hold his tongue. ‘You’ve just described my relationship with Pansy in fifth year,’ he said bluntly. ‘And I couldn’t have cared less about her back then.’
Harry hadn’t lived. Pansy – no one – ever needed to know that. It was a secret he and Harry would take to their graves. The mystery behind the Deathly Hallows needed to stay a mystery. The connection Harry had once harboured with Voldemort needed to stay one too. There were some magics beyond Dark, some that should never have come to be. The horcruxes Voldemort created were one such magic, the control over Death gifted by the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak was another.
Draco didn’t remember the explosion. One moment he’d been walking with some of the second years he was tutoring – escorting them back from the library to the relative safety of the Slytherin common room – the next he was being slammed forcefully into and then through the wall into one of the disused Muggle Studies classrooms. He was sure he’d blacked out when his head slammed into stone, but it didn’t seem as though he’d been out for long when his vision cleared, and the world formed back into a haze of dust and debris and screaming children.
Draco placed his teacup down on the table with enough force to slosh tea over the rim. ‘You’re being stupid.’
Not that the woman he’d encased in ice was likely to do much, the fine layer that had clung close to her skin reached bone deep and she was well and truly hypothermic now. Her friend was putting up a good fight against the chains, but Draco wasn’t worried. He gave him an unimpressed looked and with a twist of his wand sent the chain slithering up his body like a snake until one end had wrapped around the wizard’s mouth acting like a gag. He pulled it as tight as he could, making sure the man was uncomfortable but unlikely to die.
‘Things between us have been different for a long time,’ he starts. ‘We’re never home together and at first I hated it, I hated that I never got to see you, but I was – I am – so happy for you, you get to fly Ginny and you deserve that.’ She makes a strangled sound at that and he winces. ‘I know, I’m sorry, but I have a point and I need to make it. You weren’t pulling away, neither was I, but it was lonely, you have to see that. I started visiting Ron and Hermione more, started seeing all of my friends more and then one day, I uh, I was supposed to be having lunch with Luna but she – well she’s Luna, she got distracted hunting down some creature and forgot all about lunch and I’m not even sure how it happened but,’ he pauses because this next bit is probably going to be the hardest bit to explain, ‘when she didn’t show I ended up bumping into Draco.’
But he’s not sure how to start the conversation. He’s not sure how to have all of this out there in one go, words that could make or break his future in ways more complicated than his (not so simple) request for a divorce.
Holding his hand wasn’t enough. Slowly, carefully, he slid Draco across the bed until he was far enough over that Harry could slide on beside him. He carefully kicked off his shoes – the ratty trainers Draco hated so much but Harry felt were too comfortable just to throw away – and eased onto the bed. He tried not to move too much, not wanting to bump Draco and risk hurting him. Eventually, he found the right spot, resting on his side with his chin on Draco’s shoulder and an arm draped low across Draco’s hips. He’d probably end up with the arm he tucked behind his head numb but it was worth it to be close enough not only to see the stuttering rise and fall of Draco’s chest but to feel it.
‘Eight,’ Draco repeated, lifting his head enough to stare at her incredulously. ‘In the morning?’ he asked, seeking clarification because that seemed horrendously early to be barging into someone’s bedroom and for Salazar’s sake, Ginny had been there long enough to build a five-story card masterpiece that he was impressed hadn’t already exploded in her face.
Possibly Molly Weasley, now he was thinking about it. He was sure she’d given Harry some rather sound life advice over the summer and although he would never admit it, Arthur Weasley had given him some advice as well. That was almost worth telling his father about. The very idea that Arthur Weasley was offering fatherly advice to Draco Malfoy would surely kill him.
Harry, whether in defence of his best friends, or just because it amused him, said, rather exasperatedly, ‘You started having sex with everybody that year.’
Given Harry actually liked that Draco could be a right git, he had to agree with Hermione on this one. That didn’t stop him from observing, ‘And I suppose you let Hermione do all of your thinking.’
‘You still own twenty percent of Sleekeasy’s,’ Draco informed him. ‘I don’t know that even that could…’ he trailed off when he realised Harry was staring back at him blankly.
reported, but Dad says Mrs Malfoy put a request in to the Ministry to have them help clear out any Dark Artefacts.’
In the time Astoria had been back at Hogwarts, there’d been a pleasant upswing in the number of students interested in learning to sign. Draco had, of course, taken Luna up on her offer of private lessons – Harry had too – but that didn’t mean he could always keep up with her rapid hand movements. Hermione, who was fascinated at the addition of a language club, hadn’t joined citing too much work to be done.
Harry had obviously come to the same conclusion because he made a beeline for a break in the wards in the opposite direction. ‘Bugger waiting on a portkey,’ he muttered, ‘I don’t fancy waiting around for that lot to notice we’re here.’
‘Now you’ve just got a piece of Draco in there instead,’ Hermione remarked, though not as unkindly as her words might have sounded because she seemed to be pondering what it might mean to have a piece of revolting broken soul removed from your own.
‘Ah,’ was all Professor Joseph managed to say while Draco and Harry untangled themselves. Draco pushed to his feet first and held a hand out for Harry to haul him up and watched as he winced when he put pressure on his burnt leg. Draco aimed a quick healing charm at Harry’s leg at the same moment, Harry aimed one at his cheek.
He and Luna had grown up in a world where magic just did things, often unexpected, terrifying and unpredictable things – some wondrous, some dangerous – and they just rolled with it. Possibly run away from it, you had to develop a decent instinct for these types of things. Harry, who grew up pruning boring rose bushes in a muggle garden and despite six years of Herbology, still hardly expected the plant life in a garden in muggle London to try and thump him through the glass.
Harry spat out a mouthful of toothpaste and met his gaze in the mirror. ‘What’s this new DADA professor like?’
‘I – I don’t even know what to say.’ She looked around the room he’d pushed her into, saw the photos on the mantle and the soft evidence of toys and love and laughter that practically leaked out of the room and she felt herself aching for all the things she didn’t know. ‘Tell me everything.’
‘Don’t call him that,’ Harry snapped likely harsher than he intended but he’d been having really nice thoughts until Ron’s snide voice ruined it. It was alright for Harry to call Draco a git, he said it with genuine affection, but Ron meant it as an insult. Which was why he phrased his response the way he did. ‘He’s gone out with Ginny.’
They’d glared at her some more. ‘We’ve already been to see the mind healer,’ Draco had then informed her crisply. ‘She gave us a prescription for some dreamless sleep, but Harry won’t take it.’
They’d fought a fucking war, a little thing like getting married young didn’t really seem big in comparison.
Bloody hell, was the slime starting to smoke? It definitely looked like smoke was coming off Draco’s ruined shirt.
‘What the fuck was that?’ he demanded, poking a tentative finger at the glass to test its durability. The thing – whatever it was – whacked up against the glass again.
‘It’s not just me!’ she added in a hurry, as though that somehow made it less bizarre that a first year was approaching the ex-Death Eater for tutoring. ‘Some of the second years missed a lot last year!’
‘You asked Pansy Parkinson for advice on what to get Malfoy for Christmas?’ Ron sounded incredulous and Harry glanced up to see his eyes were wide with surprise. ‘What the bloody hell for? Just get him some fancy chocolate or something.’
Well, read probably wasn’t the best way to describe what he was doing. The thing about these spells is they only worked for the caster. He’d found them in the same book he’d lent to Bill when they’d been looking for the right spells to bring the wards down and he’d known immediately how useful they’d be – if completely useless. They didn’t give off fancy colours or sound or even that one detection spells the Ministry used to teach which used temperature differentiation, no, these ones hummed along you nerves and without some considerable study in the Dark Arts would feel like nothing more than pins and needles.
Hermione started to giggle. ‘Oh my god, Ron, your face!’ And she fell back against her pillows giggling helplessly.
She never asked anything more of him than he was willing to give, never held his past against him and had been nothing but supportive even when he knew he hadn’t deserved it. Honestly, some days he was sure he still didn’t deserve it, not after all she’d been through in his family home, but that hadn’t once stopped her from sitting beside him and just being his friend.
With his wand still gripped in his hand, he reached down and pulled up the sleeve of his jumper, baring the Dark Mark for all to see. In the split second all eyes darted down to look, Draco saw the flicker of fear and uncertainty in the eyes of the three witches and that quiver of fear told him he’d been right to think none of them bore the Mark. They might have been followers of Voldemort – must have been to be in a house guarded by such wards – but they weren’t Death Eaters and that made things more interesting.
Just another reason she wished she could still hate him. It was just hard when he was right. She thought about Harry telling her of the things he and Draco did. Of the places they went – and ones that didn’t even require using money that she and Ron didn’t have. She thought about walks through markets and quiet dinners. She thought about going to movies – something she knew Ron would love – and wondered at herself for never even thinking about it.
‘What if I’d stood up to my only friend?’ he mused into the darkness, thinking on a twelve-year-old Hermione crying alone in a bathroom and a fourteen-year-old Hermione alone and crying because her cat (her stupidly smart, brilliant half-kneazle) had done what all cats do and tried to eat a rat.
They’d hardly expected Granger to be awake, hardly expected anyone to be, but it worked in their favour. There was no one around to witness Granger’s breakdown. He didn’t much care who caught him snogging Harry, but he thought both Harry and Granger would prefer no one had the chance to see her tears and obvious pain.
‘Liar,’ he was smiling softly as he said it. Draco wouldn’t care if he was bloody and broken, only that he’d sat all night by his bedside and fucking cried. That would make him smile. It made Harry choke up, laughter and tears mixing as he tried to hold them back.
By the time he realised that Voldemort didn’t care about blood, only power, he’d already lost his faith and one more thing against Voldemort barely registered.
Remembering the weekend spent cleansing the castle wasn’t especially pleasant. They hadn’t been the only ones to turn up a creepy sex trap and there’d been plenty of other things turned up during the extensive sweep. Spells and enchantments that had been in place for decades – some had been around working softly for centuries. Not all of them were harmful but they were all additions to the castle that shouldn’t have been there and had been overlooked during the summer’s initial sweep. Some had been overlooked by the restoration team who had been tasked with repairing the castle as they were not strictly checking for unwanted additional enchantments.
Draco looked up at Harry and for a moment he looked fine, tired and sore but fine, and then his expression crumpled and he started to cry. Harry wriggled up the bed a bit until he could wrap Draco in his arms and simply held him, whispering nonsense words and stroking his hair, offering what comfort he could.
Draco hadn’t felt that way in years. He hadn’t known his father could still love and care for him. He hadn’t realised the man he half-remembered from his childhood still existed after the darkness that Voldemort had brought back into their lives. He hadn’t realised the man who loved and cherished his son and wanted only what was best for him could still exist, not after the scheming and plotting and so much death. It was humbling and annoying as fuck because now he couldn’t just hate and resent his father, he had to love him too.
Harry knew that, he did, but that didn’t mean it was always easy to put into practice. Hermione had been his best friend for years but there’d never been the familiarity of just reaching out to hold her hand or tug on her hair. She’d always been the one to initiate hugs and touch unless they were in a life-or-death situation and Harry had only realised that when he’d realised he liked reaching out to Draco.
He waits a beat, debates whether or not to say it and then thinks that so far this has been a night for brutal honesty so why not just say it? ‘I want it.’
‘Yes, he is,’ he replied gently, wondering if he was going to find himself trying to explain to a six-year-old that it was perfectly okay for boys to like other boys.
Granger’s mouth twisted in another frown of disapproval. ‘I know I don’t know what went on during the summer to have you and Malfoy so friendly – but Harry that was incredibly dangerous.’ She locked her eyes on Harry’s willing him to understand. ‘Blood magic is dangerous. There are so many things about it we don’t understand.’
Harry fell to his knees in the damp leaves a sob tearing through him. There was no one around to hear him fall apart, no one around to comfort him because there was never anyone, there’d never be anyone and Harry would lose this war and people would die and he would –
Draco had no idea if Harry had ever explained to Granger (or Weasley for that matter) just how often he’d feared being left behind by his magical friends. Had he ever told his friends just how many summers he’d spent having to convince himself he could go back, that it was all still there just waiting for his return? Had they never noticed how different Harry was when he returned each year?
Harry laughed, a soft relaxed chuckle that likely seemed out of place to anyone watching. ‘Have I told you how much I love how uninvested you were in being a Death Eater?’
Draco ignored him and turned to the goblin. ‘Right,’ he said. ‘We’re going to need the paperwork to place the Potter Trust Vault in trust for our children, we’ll need parchment for cataloguing and I’d like additional paperwork to get started on merging the Black, Malfoy and Potter vaults as well as the three Lestrange vaults and I want to declare them as the start-up capital for Burbage Hall – which I’m going to need paperwork for as well.’ Draco wrinkled his nose. ‘I think we’ll need to make some charitable donations too,’ he admitted. ‘But I refuse to just hand the Ministry money – they’ll waste it.’
‘That was different,’ Harry answered. ‘None of my injuries were resistant to magic – they were all spells easily undone, or exhaustion. All it took was a potion or some chocolate and I was good to go. You don’t heal from a magical creature or even Dark curses that easily.
And that was probably fair. Luna hadn’t been called to attend this meeting either but when he and Harry had emerged from their bathroom just thirty minutes before, Luna had been curled up on their couch munching on some toast and announced she planned to help. McGonagall had given her a disapproving look, but she hadn’t sent Luna (or Ginny) right back out again. They were both of age and perfectly capable of identifying and not springing a trap or setting off curses – more so than the fifth-year prefects in any case.
His first glimpse of Harry in almost twenty years and he hadn’t even recognised him. To be fair, he’d been in the middle of a tour of the auror department – which had come a long way from the one he remembered from right after the war – and he’d only caught a glimpse in at the training room where a shirtless man who was all broad shoulders and lean muscle was putting some new recruits through their paces. He remembered tattoos, wild hair and a sly grin and then he was moving on nodding approvingly at the many – many – changes that had been made to the DMLE and the Ministry itself since the war when he’d last been in England.
If you’d passed her on the street you wouldn’t have looked twice at her, being that she was five foot nothing, had short curly grey hair and walked with a severe limp owing to the fact that she didn’t have any toes on her right foot and had a fused left hip from an incident with – according to rumour – three hags and a vampire.
Harry snorted. ‘It wasn’t much of a crisis to be honest. It was two solid months of thinking about you all the time, of dreaming about you. And a lot of revelations about our past.’
Draco snorted then shrugged. He was a little thrown by her words because he certainly hadn’t been expecting them. ‘You’re welcome, Granger.’
But it was the moments when she did see the boy he used to be, that the sinking feeling started. The one that said he really had grown and changed and was trying so hard to be better. He faltered sometimes, small stumbles that spoke to how he was raised but not to what he believed now, and it was so hard to keep hating him. It was so hard to pretend that her smiles were fake, that her conversations with him about anything and everything and the school he was building, were just her attempts to keep close for when he hurt Harry.
Granger’s watery eyes darted from Harry to Draco and Draco could see it in the way she took a deep breath, as though his presence there made it necessary for her to suck in all her emotion and bury any weakness. He wanted to roll his eyes. It was a bit late for that. She could hardly pretend he hadn’t seen her breaking down. Much the way he wasn’t about to pretend she hadn’t just watched him being horribly sappy with Harry.
Pansy’s tumbler hit the table with a crack, and she stared at him, hoping he’d elaborate. He wasn’t sure he knew how. How did he explain how it had all gone so completely wrong for Goyle? How did he make her understand the lengths he’d gone to just to be able to live without people spitting on him or sneering at him?
‘Floo him,’ she says again, slowly, carefully, enunciating each word as though he was an idiot for not understanding the first time. ‘Let’s talk about this.’
‘You can blame Harry for that,’ Draco informed her, with a sardonic quirk of his lips. ‘Anything weird is absolutely his fault.’
Opening all the windows in his room to allow the soft warm breeze to fill his room wasn’t quite the same but he didn’t want to brave the lake and McGonagall had done the best she could in making sure his room was open and light – a far cry from his Azkaban cell. She’d created the safest space she could for him and he was immensely grateful. It was still uncomfortable for him to spend so much time in one room but knowing he could step outside whenever he wanted eased the pressure that threatened to suck him under and trap him in a panic attack.
The lift jerked to a stop on one of the lower levels – the same one that housed the holding cells where he’d first found Draco. Instead of turning left when he exited, Harry turned right toward the training rooms. He hadn’t been down here in two weeks and in spite of the display of power he’d just pulled off upstairs he had no doubt he was about to get his arse kicked down here.
There was a brief moment where they both wondered if it was absolutely necessary to bring this ward down and if they couldn’t perhaps wait until spring, before they both hastily removed a single glove. Harry clasped Draco’s hand in his and shoved them both back into his pocket. They both turned to face the ward again as Bill wandered over to see what they were up to.
Hermione looked bewildered by their exchange, not because it had taken place half in Parseltongue but because she didn’t seem to understand what she was asking of Draco and all that it had brought up. Not that he’d expect her to know. How could she? How could she know all the fears and the anxieties her questions would prompt?
Terrified, Harry was momentarily frozen but then Ron was there, gently taking Draco’s other side and prompting Harry into action. Together they turned around, moving as quickly as they could to get Draco to the hospital wing.
Things didn’t much improve from there. Joseph started off the class talking about the assigned chapter in the textbook (Draco had read it and decided it wasn’t at all worth the time it had taken) and then struck up a discussion about the particular theory it discussed on defensive shields. Draco’s mind wandered and the glazed expression on Harry’s face told him he was just as bored.
Ron’s whole demeanour went from awkward to horrified in a flash. ‘Why the bloody hell would I talk to Malfoy about this?’
Harry’s eyes flashed dangerously and before Draco could stop him, he was on his feet and rounding angrily on Hermione. ‘Is that true?’ he demanded.
‘You still could have come and got us mate,’ Weasley pouted, this time at least his mouth was free of food.
(A small part of Draco acknowledged they’d brought this on themselves by disrespecting Joseph, but he couldn’t quite work up the energy to be guilty.)
He suspected it was the sudden lurching fear that his inability to give Hermione the answers she desperately wanted would somehow damage his relationship with Harry.
Harry, in spite of the tension, found himself laughing. ‘Merlin, Ron, do you know how much sex he was having while we were worrying about other things and trying not to get killed?’
‘I told you I died three days after the war ended,’ Harry pointed out wryly, highlighting the contradiction in his behaviour with casual amusement.
Pansy flinched. Clearly, she had no idea what she was supposed to say in response to that. Perhaps, had they been friends, she might have been there after it happened to comfort him. Perhaps, if he’d been better at caring and understanding people rather than using and manipulating them, he wouldn’t have been left hiding behind Crabbe and Goyle, as though they could possibly shield him from the world and his own stupid mistakes.
‘No,’ the fact it was Harry who disagreed surprised Granger. She looked betrayed. She was looking at Harry as though she couldn’t believe he’d ever say something so wretched in defence of a society that had only just come out the other side of a war. A war that had only gained momentum in the first place because of the wizarding world’s prejudices.
Draco walked impassively over to his aunt’s lifeless body and snatched away the wands she had on her. He tossed Harry’s back to him – who caught it easily – as he made his way toward his mother.
Ginny released his shoulders and prodded him sharply. ‘You’re covered in blood and tears and it’s very unattractive. Draco would hate it.’
Instead, Draco spun, and two more curses felled the Snatchers holding Ron and Hermione. Harry didn’t even flinch at the green light snapping toward his friends. He was too busy shaking the spell from his features as he wrestled with the Snatcher holding his shoulders.
They’d all known Ron was going to take the news badly, even if they hadn’t realised how badly but why should Hermione feel guilty for now being ready to talk to Ron just because Harry wasn’t?
He wasn’t wrong though. Draco hadn’t been there when the Hogwarts matron ran the first proper diagnostic on Harry, but he’d seen the aftermath. Madam Pomfrey had been adamant about dosing Harry with potions to treat the malnutrition of not only the year he’d been camping on the run but the many years of his childhood when he hadn’t had access to food or any kind of nurturing and healthy (emotional and otherwise) environment. Salazar, Draco wished he could curse those muggles Harry was forced to call family.
Intrigued, Harry asked about how the tradition came about and the sort of things the children were taught which spiralled into a discussion on the sort of subjects children should be learning in schools and honestly, it was just nice to be the one having an animated conversation with a stallholder instead of standing aside trying to pretend he had any idea what was being discussed.
‘I don’t think you would have,’ Harry murmured, once he’d shared this strange and horrible idea. ‘I don’t think you give yourself nearly enough credit.’
Because Draco’s guilt and future plans might have designated a use for all the money the Lestranges had acquired through decades (possibly centuries even) of dirty dealings and questionably legal exploits, but he’d be damned if he let Harry toss away all that money when there were so many better things it could be used for.
‘Oh.’ A beat later Weasley muttered, ‘Bloody hell. Yeah, right, okay, I can see why you’re glad it happened over the summer.’
In all honestly, coming out to the Weasleys had been easy. They’d been supportive, loving, and most importantly, they’d been around for it. They’d been there when he raged about the unfairness of the Death Eaters not receiving proper trials. They’d been around to watch Harry disappear off to Azkaban every day and they’d seen him testify for Draco and Narcissa. They might not have known what was happening at first but once he’d laid it out for them, they’d understood (mostly) and been very accepting.
Draco felt rather smug. It must have shown on his face because Harry prodded him sharply and hissed a reprimand to which Draco only laughed and said, ‘Well I suppose we can’t all have our sexuality sorted at fourteen.’
Harry groaned, horrified at the mere thought of someone so staunchly hating of children having any sort of say in the future. ‘Why would you say that?’ He gave Draco a good-natured shove which put him close enough to the nearest stall to be distracted by some sort of weed Harry didn’t recognise and then Draco was off, talking about the right time to harvest it and how it had been treated and what sort of potions it improved, and Harry just stood back and watched, a stupid fond smile on his face.
‘What the fuck for?’ Ron asked. He sounded angry, frustrated, like he didn’t understand how this conversation was going so wrong or why they were even having it in the first place.
‘I think you have to,’ Hermione responded. ‘I can’t die for you, Harry, I won’t. All those people who believe in you, they don’t know you’ve got no idea what you’re really doing, and I can’t be a part of that. I can’t go on letting them think there’s some big plan when really it’s just the three of us in this terrible tent trying to survive on nuts and berries and horrible mushrooms.’ She looked at Harry, her gaze pitying. ‘I can’t see this war ending, Harry, not the way we want it to, not the way Dumbledore planned for. I’m going with Ron and then I’m going to find my parents. I’m not going to die for this stupid war, Harry, I’m just not.’
She hammered her fist on the door of Draco and Harry’s room and then hammered again when her first knock went unanswered. She was about to try for a third when the door was yanked open and she found herself looking at a very dishevelled Harry.
But that was guilt she didn’t know how to process yet and so she tried to think about the things Draco had told her, the things Harry had admitted to, about how hard it was being on the outside of the wizarding world. The fear and the confusion and the not knowing. She tried to think about all the pain she could have caused her parents – because Draco had a point when he said she was never going to be quiet about her views – and she told herself she’d done the right thing. She’d told herself that her parents were safer and happier not knowing the dangers they were in, not knowing the dangers she was in.
Harry was normally terrible at charm-speaking (it involved a certain subtlety and finesse he frankly lacked) and they probably should have switched roles, but Harry was the official auror – sort of – and Draco was merely an ex-Death Eater forced to work out his crimes as the Ministry’s spell fodder. It went without saying that it was better he handle the magical people than be seen to be manipulating muggles. Although his ex-Death Eater status probably meant he shouldn’t be touching their captives either, but he’d rather get reprimanded for removing objects from the pair than risk an emergency illegal portkey or one of them getting their hands on a wand.
He’d always assumed Hermione understood the isolation Harry experienced every summer, especially after he’d returned fifth year an angry teenage mess. Though perhaps she’d assumed his time was more like her own, spent in study and exploration of the magical world even if it was done in secret – after all, it was to be expected given his relatives hate of magic.
‘You were a child,’ Draco reminded her, surprisingly gentle, because it really wasn’t her fault, and it wasn’t Harry’s. There was a lot of blame to be placed firmly on the Dursleys but plenty more on Dumbledore and Mrs Figg. Plenty of blame to be placed on anyone who didn’t offer Harry the safety and support he needed to have him even thinking he could reach out for help.
‘Anyway, by the time he got out of Azkaban the Ministry had found a way he could work off that last part of his sentence. There are a lot of things Voldemort and his Death Eaters left behind. Cursed houses, objects, places, all sorts of things, some of them dating back to the first war. Draco’s the only Death Eater they can control who isn’t locked up or dead. He knows a lot about the Dark Arts, and he’s got the Mark on his arm that lets him just walk through a lot of Voldemort’s wards. When they find something really dark or that they think is too dangerous for the Ministry curse breakers, they take Draco.’
He had no idea where they were, couldn’t even narrow down the part of the country just by glancing around and there was hardly any time to stop and ask someone. He had no idea what exactly they’d interrupted, either. Some sort of winter festival perhaps? He could see, over the heads of the fleeing crowd, at least four figures stood in front of the empty stage. Figures dressed in robes and masks, firing spells into the backs of the fleeing muggles. That was all he needed to know. All Harry needed to know, as well.
The fact he didn’t receive a second look from the witch who greeted them was unexpected. Oh, there was a tiny moment of befuddlement when she realised who he was and that he was with Hermione and Ginny, but to her credit she didn’t say a word and directed them to one of the nicer tables right on the street where they could watch the other witches and wizards braving the chill to take advantage of the Boxing Day sales.
Draco, despite how nice it was to know they cared, did not think this justified taking up residence in his bed before eight o’clock in the bloody morning. ‘Where’s Harry?’ he asked instead of pointing that out because he knew exactly how far that would get him with Ginny Weasley.
Draco shot an anchor charm at the felled Death Eater (possibly not-so-innocent bystander) to keep him from escaping should one of the others get past them and try to grab him and charged forward into the thinning crowd after Harry. The witch on the left spotted them making their way through the crowd and her gleeful laugh echoed hauntingly over the crowed. It reminded him of Bella – not a fond memory and probably why the spell he fired at her was so vicious. She didn’t try to avoid the spell, throwing up a shield charm when any sensible person would have ducked, and the spell tore through her shield and slammed into her. She slammed into the ground, limbs flailing as crystals of ice swept up her legs and the length of her body encasing her in a thick layer of ice before she even had the chance to prevent it.
It was Granger. Of course, it was. The gobsmacked look on her face as she stared at them did little to detract from the shadows beneath her eyes and the ashen cast of her skin. She looked dreadful. Her eyes were bloodshot and the shimmer of tears stained her pale cheeks. She was also still dressed in her pyjamas, with an oversized knit cardigan hastily pulled on over the top and ridiculous pink slippers.
‘You’re sick,’ Ron snarled. ‘I can’t believe I’ve been friends with you all these years and you’ve just been this disgusting fag, gagging for Death Eater cock.’
Although, granted, he sincerely doubted either of them were ready for that last one. Thankfully, Hermione gave him an opening.
Fury was easier than hurt in that moment. Easier than feeling the bewildering sense of betrayal Draco could see him holding back.
Draco pushed him to be selfish sometimes, showed him that it was okay to do the little things – taught him how to do the little things. And he never made a big deal of it. Sure, he’d caused a fuss over the wardrobe thing, but he’d made it about him. Of all the people in his life, Draco should have been the one to make him feel ridiculous for not knowing how to do basic things. The boy who’d reached out and used those things to torment him in the past should have made Harry feel small and ridiculous for not knowing what size jeans he would need. But he never felt like that with Draco.
‘You were this ridiculously handsome boy in fancy robes who spoke eloquently and only ever seemed to be around for fancy balls and garden parties,’ Pansy told him. ‘You were like something out of a fairy tale and my parents used to talk about yours in hushed whispers like you were some big elegant secret. You’d come to those things and you’d talk to us and play with us but you never really seemed to be one of us and for so long I just thought that was because you were this dashing fairy tale prince and I told Mother I was going to marry you and live in your castle.’
The wizarding world was such an odd place. Harry had known that for a while, but it was amusing to him to see that the prejudices he would have expected from a society that had just had a war about blood purity, a society intent on stamping out anyone who didn’t have the right sort of blood or family history, didn’t even bat an eye at two men in a relationship. They were just astonished to find those men were the Chosen One and a Death Eater.
After they’d chewed in comfortable silence for a few minutes, Harry broached the topic of their meeting with McGonagall. He wanted to know what she’d had to say and what they were supposed to be doing about it.
Draco cast the standard detection spells on both secured Death Eaters and then laid the two wands and a handful of pocket detritus – none of which had more than basic spellwork on it – out on the pavement far enough away from the two that they couldn’t somehow use them but close enough to identify which of them the pieces belonged to and then transfigured a muggle newspaper into little labels that he tucked under them. He didn’t recognise either of the Death Eaters so settled for labelling them Death Eater #1 and Death Eater #2.
‘I love you,’ he’d reminded Harry. ‘And if that means we don’t sleep then I will deal with that but, Harry, torturing yourself isn’t going to make this go away, it isn’t going to change anything.’
Of course, he hadn’t been subjected to lunch with Pansy yet. That might somewhat sway Harry in a different direction.
The fact that Draco had ways of making essay writing interesting said a lot about how much Harry loved the enormous git and he thought Hermione might appreciate knowing that even if he still didn’t get a thrill out of learning, Draco could almost make him see the thrill he and Hermione got.
The realisation had come to him on one of the many trips back from Azkaban. He’d had a lot of realisations like that over the summer since he’d started visiting Draco – and he was Draco now, not Malfoy. There was something about the despair of Azkaban, the dark horrors it made you contemplate, how the damp cold atmosphere could seep into your very soul thanks to the dementors, that brought about a certain amount of desperate soul searching and world-shattering realisations.
It was only when he was taking a proper look at the menu that he realised the witch was likely just happy to have someone who wouldn’t blink at the prices listed beside each item in the post-Christmas bustle. He could appreciate a witch who would let a convicted Death Eater sit at a table just because she knew he could pay.
‘You should go on a date with Ron,’ Harry told her, not so much because he wanted to encourage any sort of happiness for Ron as he wanted Hermione to be happy and he could admit there was a part of Harry that got the feeling once Hermione and Ron actually started to communicate as a couple that they’d realise what a disaster it all was.
They fell into a thoughtful silence, Harry seemed to be thinking it all over, though whether he was focusing on the good use of the Lestrange money or the idea of his mother taking on the ministry and demanding better education for future generations of witches and wizards, Draco couldn’t be sure. Still, whatever he was thinking, something else suddenly occurred to him because he sat up straight and glared into the distance.
This time Harry rolled his eyes, though Draco hoped he was smart enough to realise the very good reason Draco hadn’t used that little trick Fleur had taught him. Sometimes it was best to let the DMLE think they were in control.
Draco always had been somewhat obsessed with Harry Potter and if the stalking Harry had performed in sixth year was anything to go by (and they both knew it was), Harry had been just as obsessive about Draco in return. His stupid saving people complex, the very one that Dumbledore had once called “moral fibre” hadn’t let him stand by and watch as Draco was abused by Aurors.
It was a bit unfortunate (for Weasley) that Draco’s instinctive response was to hit him back because he had been training with Ginny and working out with Harry and so his return punch packed a lot more of a wallop than Weasley’s and came with the satisfying crunch of a nose breaking.
Because that was really where Harry’s hesitance came from and why Granger had acquiesced so quickly when Harry had shot her down. Weasley might have been an oblivious idiot but Granger wasn’t, and she was making an effort not to alienate her best friend before she had all the answers. Draco wondered if that meant she was willing to alienate him once she did have those answers. He’d always thought she’d keep on hating him, that even when she learned the truth about his relationship with Harry that she’d never trust him and focus all of her effort on getting Harry to see sense and break up with him.
‘Night!’ he called cheerfully after her. Once they were in their room Draco made zero moves as though he were up for sex. ‘I’m way to tired,’ he told Harry.
He’d likely have to broach the topic with Bill and McGonagall. And wouldn’t that be a fun conversation?
That was a bit of a loaded question. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t want to talk to Ron, it felt bloody weird keeping such a huge part of his life from his best friend, but telling Ron meant
‘You two are more familiar with the castle,’ Mustafa pointed out to Draco and Harry. ‘Start with the fifth and sixth floors. We won’t get it all done today. We’ll worry about the seventh floor and towers tomorrow.’
Draco picked up his fork and speared a piece of beef he knew would be melt-in-your-mouth tender but didn’t actually have it in his mouth before Hermione observed, ‘He’s not wearing the locket anymore.’
Draco had stared at his father, flabbergasted. Harry, though he hadn’t been much better, did manage to ask a question. ‘You know about me and Draco?’
And he realised, quite abruptly, that he’d been an idiot. Draco – and Ginny for that matter – would hardly be surprised. Hermione wasn’t demanding answers to questions that weren’t hers to know, she wasn’t demanding pieces of him he wasn’t willing to give her – she didn’t even know those moments and answers were things that drew him closer to Draco. She was just sad to think that her best friend couldn’t talk to her, that he’d been afraid to write to her or ask questions or seek comfort when he learned something about himself that must have been surprising and uncomfortable and all she wanted to do was support him and be there for him and he wouldn’t even let her.
Harry was still poking through a drawer full of rings (none of them the pair he was looking for) so he didn’t see the strange look come over Ron and therefore didn’t quite grasp his meaning when he said, ‘You like her.’
Draco hadn’t looked back; they all knew that was true. ‘I wanted to tell you in person before it gets out and people start accusing me of slipping him potions or blowing him for my freedom.’
Hermione’s eyes gleamed and he had only a moment to consider he might have just made a grave error in judgement before she grinned and said, ‘Deal.’
‘True,’ he agreed easily enough. He might have regrets and guilt and a whole host of feelings about his choices, but he wasn’t about to show weakness to a bunch of seventh years who knew nothing about what had really happened. ‘But I still fought.’
Bringing the wards down had left him exhausted but not so much that he didn’t react in time to reach out to grab the junior auror by the back of his battle robes and haul him backward even as he took his first step across the boundary. Draco’s sharp reprimand was an angry hiss that only Harry truly understood but he thought the sharpness of the sounds and the look on his face conveyed enough of his meaning.
‘Ex-Death Eater,’ Harry said automatically, ‘and he didn’t want to be.’ At least he hadn’t, not in the end.
There was a hate he’d tentatively believed was beginning to bloom into something that might one day be forgiveness. He’d thought the way they’d been talking, the way they’d been working together and the way that she’d stopped harshly demanding explanations to some of the magic he used, meant that she was beginning to see that he’d changed. He didn’t expect her to like him – had never expected that – but he was realising now that somewhere along the way, he’d let Harry’s insistence that Hermione would see the changes in him and come to maybe accept him as Harry’s partner and one day maybe even a friend, trick him into believing it was possible.
It was one of the reasons he loved him so much. They could talk about these things without having to try and explain feelings and thoughts and extenuating circumstances. He’d told Harry rather sharply, while still in that Ministry holding cell, that everything he’d done in sixth year had been to protect his parents. That he’d been terrified of failure and knowing he was the reason Voldemort killed his family. Harry had taken that knowledge – knowledge he’d already suspected – and put it together with everything else he’d known about sixth year from his not-at-all-subtle stalking and he’d understood. Made connections between the little things he’d noticed, and he’d understood.
He felt Harry stiffen against him before he forced himself to relax, letting out a long breath, as if telling himself not to feel guilty for something he couldn’t change – another thing he’d been working on with his mind healer. ‘I got so used to only being able to tell them things, of it being the three of us against the world. I was told to tell nobody what I learned about Voldemort, that it was too important and dangerous for anyone else to know. Dumbledore insisted I could only trust Ron and Hermione with the information and I believed him.’
He scrubbed his hands over his face and tried not to let his frustration leak out in his magic. He felt all over the place, like he couldn’t get a lid on his power or his feelings. He felt like he was back in that little boat on the passage from Azkaban, being tossed about on the waves, never knowing when he was going to be up or down or if the next rough wave would send them over entirely. It was like he’d been cut adrift, left without anchor, and now all he could do was grab tight and hope he didn’t blow something up while he tried desperately not to show Ron or Hermione what he was thinking and feeling.
Draco frowned and then glanced across the Great Hall to the Gryffindor table. Luna was seated with her back to him but when she felt his eyes on her, she glanced over her shoulder and looked at him questioningly. He shook his head and dropped his gaze back to the note, stuffing the letter back into the envelope before slipping it into his bag with the care package from his mother.
‘Hermione, please,’ Harry begged but Hermione had said her piece and she was done trying to explain herself, she just gave Harry one last look and apparated away with a very emotional crack.
Harry didn’t. Instead he turned and frowned at Slughorn for a moment before rolling his eyes again at the man and purposefully stalking across the room to drop into the available chair beside Draco. In the stunned silence that followed there was no doubt everyone heard Harry’s muttered “arsehole” though whether they realised it was directed at Slughorn, Draco couldn’t tell.
The original plan had called for Harry to be gone just twenty-six hours. They spent the extra forty-two reassuring each other they were alive and well.
‘He was a Death Eater, Harry, got the Mark to prove it. He did some truly awful things and just because you’re friends now, doesn’t mean I can forget all the terrible things he’s done. Doesn’t mean you should either.’
Hence, the presence of Charlie and a witch from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
Professor Sprout, much like McGonagall and Flitwick treated him no differently than they had before his role in the war became known. Sprout was inclined to favour him over some of the others if only because he appreciated what most of her plants could do once harvested for potions. Flitwick had always admired his charms work and McGonagall was one of the three people in the school who knew the true extent of what he’d been through during the war and its aftermath. She would never show favouritism, hadn’t ever even with her Gryffindors, but she was fair in her treatment of him and had shown her support for his efforts to redeem himself.
‘It’s not a bloody date,’ Harry relented with a roll of his eyes. ‘There are professional scouts coming to the next match and Ginny wanted to train with Draco because he won’t go easy on her and is perfectly willing to list all her flaws.’ Harry considered that he probably wasn’t too far from the truth there and in fact he thought those might have been Ginny’s actual words when she’d asked him for help. ‘I think the Italian food was supposed to soften the blow after.’
Draco clutched onto his arms to prevent the half-hearted attempt and then slid his hands up Harry’s arms until they were cupping his jaw. He dropped teasing kisses on Harry’s lips in apology, soft quick touches that didn’t stop the curve of a grin tracing his mouth or still the laughter in his voice when he spoke against Harry’s lips. ‘Can I have the memory?’
‘It’s fascinating,’ Hermione said. ‘I did a bit of research on magical tattoos and there wasn’t anything that I could find that matched what happened with your one of Sirius and Draco’s Dark Mark. I couldn’t find anything at all actually, not even when I looked at the spells themselves. It is possible to get paired tattoos but the magic tying them together is simple and needs to be maintained. It’s not a very popular choice among couples or friends because the connection is so limited. Most people, from what I’ve read, just prefer to get matching art rather than go for the extra bit of connecting magic.’
Draco twitched. The club went still, seconds away from hitting the troll once more. Draco twisted his head to look at her, eyes still bright.
“Wha-,” Harry spluttered, smug look replaced with a distraught one, “You just told me to do what my heart wants!” He retaliated.
“What is wrong with the child, Lucius?!” Narcissa questioned, crossing her arms and tapping her foot. Lucius didn’t answer her (mostly because he did not want to) for he didn’t know either.
The students were holding their breaths, none of them have heard him speak the whole time he was here.
Draco, however, was trying to get a hold on Potter and drag him away. It's a good thing they were a nice distance from the scene as Draco was getting no where.
Draco stood there gobsmacked, the crying asshole did this several times to him, day and night, but the ONE time Draco retaliated, he was getting life??
Draco and Tom have been talking on and off for days now. Despite the fact an old man could possibly be at the other side of the journal, Draco has been feeling a strong connection towards it. He would scowl when Theo attempted to take it away, panic when he couldn’t find it; he revolved his entire world around the diary. This was fine at first, despite what Theo told him, until the blackouts started to hit. He would wake up disoriented in the strangest places, and he couldn’t for the life of him remember how he got there. He would ask Tom, frantic:
Theo rolled his eyes and crossed his arms, in disbelief of what has come over his best friend. Again, his eyes roamed over the small boy. His pillow was propped up against his headboard, knees tight against his chest and shoulders dramatically hunched over. His sheets were thrown off to the side leaving him shivering in the cool air of the Dungeons. He was wearing pajamas that Theo realized he's been wearing for days straight. Even underneath his robes. The brunet shuddered, realizing that Draco must have been skipping showers.
Draco paused, his quill hovering over the notebook page. He's forgotten... He got so worked up at the thought that every mudblood and blood-traitor would be rid from his life, but failed to remember that Potter would be going with them. This...didn't seem like the greatest idea anymore.
He took a step forward, forcing Draco to step back. He continued this until he was in front of the doorway.
He opened the door, and inhaled the scent of rotting corpses, moldy earth, and the coppery smell of blood. He firmly closed the behind him, locking it with a flick of his wrist. Yeah, maybe he could do wandless and wordless magic. However, Draco fails to see how that’s anyone’s business. Draco didn’t have to look for long, the mirror was in the middle of the room. He walked closer, no matter how many times he enters the room, it never fails at sending shivers down his spine. He ran a slender finger down the mirror’s frame, he stared at his reflection, but it didn’t stare back.
Draco didn't give an answer at first, looking at Harry to give off an "I may have dragged you here but you're wasting my time" look.
The boy had to recover first, for he expected backlash from his father. What, was the Howler simply a prank? He continues to stare at his father, searching for a hidden meaning in the praise but finding none. He notices his father getting impatient and quickly replies.
It seemed like it was already was, for when the blond boy managed to get a glance at Lockhart, Potter was there standing next to him, looking like a right fool. They caught each other’s eyes, his raised eyebrows caused the other child to flush brightly and, somehow, escape from Lockhart’s clutches.
