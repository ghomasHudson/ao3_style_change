Draco’s bottom lip is caught between his teeth, and for the first time for as long as Harry can remember, he looks unsure.
Sure enough, that was crossing the line. “I thought I made myself clear that the first time we did this was an exception. I don’t do sleepovers.”
Your throat is dry, it doesn’t seem to work properly, and your words come out broken. “Forgive me, sir, I do not.”
think about Potter in terms of beauty, he’s only a good shag (or a bloody fantastic one if someone was pointing a wand at him).
He couldn’t decide if what he felt was humiliation or disappointment. Probably both. He’d never thought Pansy would do this to him, to sell him out like this just to become a part of the Gryffindor Gang (and honorary Ravenclaw).
lazy.
You try, you really try, but everything’s changed after this. You’ve always despised those who fall for the Tempter's tricks, those whose faith isn't strong enough to resist temptation, but now you know, there is no definite right or wrong. The Lord intended us to show love, didn’t He? So how could it be wrong to love someone as much as you love Harry? How could it be wrong to feel as good as you do when you’re with him?
She rolled her eyes. Really, humans were so stiff sometimes, rigid in their way of thinking. Even if she told him, she doubted he’d understand that she’d been so bored that now she absolutely
“Harry, we’ve been friends for a while now. I believe we’ve developed a certain level of trust working together. What is bothering you?”
“And now, you relax,” Draco murmurs and manoeuvers Harry into the living room, kissing him all the while.
Harry hisses in pleasure as Draco strokes a hand over his bulge, cupping him through his trousers. Then his knees give way as they hit one of his armchairs, and he falls down on it, his head thumping back against the headrest. Draco smirks at him, his bottom lip disappearing between his teeth, and then he kneels, letting himself be bracketed by Harry’s spread legs. Nimble hands work Harry’s flies open and then pull his trousers and pants down in one swift motion, making his cock spring free and bounce on his stomach. Draco looks at it, head tilted, his eyes bright and assessive, and Harry wants to squirm under the scrutiny, but Draco’s gaze feels like a warm beam, making him feel… safe. Seen. And incredibly aroused.
“Harry,” you breathe before you crash your lips together, with such force that you press him up against the door, making him gasp. His hair feels so familiar sliding between your fingers, and your heart leaps in elation at seeing him again, having him close once more.
Three days into their holiday, Draco felt like he had found some sort of new normal and started to find his place in the group, as well as a normal way to act around Potter. It was difficult to share a room with him, but Draco found that if he stayed in the living room long enough into the evening, Potter had often already gone to bed when Draco came up. Since he wasn’t in the mood to expose himself more than necessary, both figuratively and literally speaking, he also always made sure to be clothed, even though sleeping in his pyjamas was extremely sweaty once his cooling charms had worn off. The others had initially looked baffled at his choice of wearing long sleeves and full length trousers even on the beach, but accepted his explanation about his pale complex and sun protective charms not being sufficient enough for him to not get a severe sunburn.
“You’re not asking me why I didn’t tell you about some ancient curse that threatened to get us stuck to each other?”
“I know what you’re doing,” Harry snapped, trying to fix Malfoy with a glare.
like it,” Draco hissed, sliding his hand down Harry’s back and letting it rest on his hip, gripping around his hip bone and yanking him closer still. Harry gasped as he almost toppled over but managed to sling his arm around Draco’s waist and turn the gasp into a laugh. Somewhere in the distance, a voice was speaking but he couldn’t hear a thing for the buzzing in his ears. “You are the worst, Draco Malfoy,” he said as besottedly as he could manage.
“Why is the weasel here?” Draco drawls, and even though Harry can’t see his face he knows he’s got that extremely haughty expression only he can muster.
He turns his back towards the counter and immediately searches out Draco again, who is sitting with his head tilted, watching him silently. Draco covertly cocks one eyebrow, his eyes darting quickly towards the door, and heat rushes through Harry’s body. He answers with a tiny nod before sitting down beside Luna, slowly drinking the rest of his coffee.
And it’s the truth, he realises. No one can control their feelings, he of all people should know that, or he wouldn’t be in this mess.
Fuck I’m so horny. Even before this quarantine I was having a bit of a dry spell with women, but it’s like now that I know it’s impossible to get any action, the horniness is getting even worse. I’ve even started to touch myself without noticing. Not touch myself as in
They’ll give you the… hiccups (or worse)
“Right. If you get lucky tonight, you know who to thank. Just… try to treat it with care even… even if things get… heated tonight.”
He sips the hot espresso carefully, grimacing at the bitter taste of it, and Jane laughs again. “I hope it’s strong enough!”
“I have. I have been pleasuring myself, imagining that you were with me, that it was your fingers inside me.”
“Well, I do try.”
He quickly yanked his underwear up the last bit to cover his private parts, because even if Neville had seen them countless of times when they were sharing a dorm, he didn’t much fancy his friend seeing him in this state. Though he realised that it really didn’t make much of a difference when Draco and Neville entered and watched him lying sprawled ungracefully on the floor: he’d never been more embarrassed in his entire life. What would Draco think? What if he regretted the whole thing now? Harry looked up at them, and even though they were upside down to him, he could tell Neville’s smile was amused, but he couldn’t decipher Draco’s mood.
“Well, just go down there and do something! Surely they must be able to accomodate the Boy Who Lived?”
She grabs her bag and heads for the door, because she’s never been good with feelings or weakness either, has she? She’s just turned the handle when Draco decides to tell her.
. I felt like he could’ve cast a
“I do. I mean, who wouldn’t?”
He cups Draco’s head, looking into his shining laughing eyes, and that’s really all the answer he needs, but he can’t help but ask anyway.
Harry has to bite down on a gasp when Draco shifts uncomfortably.
And hold me for the world may end
“I’m sorry! I accidentally knocked the bottle over when I was pouring it out. I promise I’ll get you a new one.”
himself. She didn’t know much about the mating habits of humans, but she got the distinct impression that his behaviour had something to do with it, because his hands, that were folded neatly onto the table top, tensed slightly at Potter’s words, his thighs pressing together faintly.
Pansy had promised, and had been thrilled, had kissed him all over his face so he got lipstick smeared on his cheeks and his nose.
Draco just nods quietly.
Harry squirmed a bit at the teasing smile Ebba directed at him, and he glanced over at Draco, who seemed to be listening with rapt attention.
“I… Is that what you’re wearing?”
Draco could meet Harry’s eyes. “I can’t pretend to be a man who can’t keep his hands off the object of his desires when all I’ve been doing this entire time is stopping myself from tracing my hands all over you and mapping out every inch of your skin. Thinking about the job is the only thing stopping me from wrapping you up in my arms and taking you far, far away from here.” Draco closed his eyes. “I thought I’d be able to get through it after earlier, I thought when you were so repulsed by the very thought of being bonded to me, to anyone, that these things, these feelings would just naturally take a seat to the task at hand but…” Draco lifted his eyes and levelled Harry with as honest a look as he could muster. “I can’t pretend with you.”
to be a virgin!” Blaise snorts at this, but Draco keeps going. “And to be quite honest, I think my parents would be the
And this has continued throughout the day. When I suggested we watch One Tree Hill, he said he didn’t feel like it, and he went to clean the bathroom. He only cleans the bathroom when he’s upset about something. Which is, well it’s not surprising considering the times we live in, with an extremely contagious disease wreaking havoc, and people dying throughout the wizarding world from an enemy we don’t know how to fight. I just wish he’d talk to me about it, we
If you recall correctly, it’s not far away, and huddling against the rain, you run together through the bushes and leaves, shielding your eyes against the pounding rain with your hands, Harry holding you so tightly it almost makes your arm go numb.
He snorts, and you turn around, his arms still bracketing you.
Harry looked with fond amusement as Ebba showed Draco the potato-peeling device. Draco had recovered from the shock that was the traditional dance around the midsummer pole (several glasses of wine had undoubtedly helped, along with Draco threatening everybody on site that “if any pictures of this surface later someone will pay!”), and now he was trying hard to hide his excitement at the plastic device that Ebba was demonstrating.
“Well it’s not like I’ve told anyone else! I’ve even kept it from my own wife!”
He waves to Ginny and Pansy and struggles to put on his coat, that he apparently managed to turn half inside out when he arrived. The air is cold and crisp when he steps out onto the pavement, his breath leaving traces in the air in front of him. He rounds the corner and there’s Draco leaning against the wall, one foot propped up behind him. Just like that first time in the club he’s smirking knowingly at Harry, and Harry feels like when he’s on a broom, doing a daring dive. He slows down, because he wants to look at Draco, really see him, all confident and glorious in front of him.
It’s Pansy’s voice, charged with fear, with panic; her fist against the wood of the door, pounding, pounding, pounding. Or could it be his own head? He’s not sure, everything is foggy, like he’s wrapped up in cotton wool. But he needs to reassure her.
“Oh yeah? Well, we’ll see about that, now won’t we?” Draco says, hoisting Harry up by the hips so that he’s on all fours.
“It’s only this way with you.” Harry ditches the plan to take things slow and swiftly works Draco’s trousers open to yank them down. Draco seems to be on the same wavelength because he doesn’t object, he even lifts his hips to help Harry in his task. “I’ve even had a wank today already.”
liked that.
I actually started knitting. Mostly to keep my hands from fidgeting out of nervousness, but also because I was hoping that if Draco saw it he’d laugh at me and we could start from there. But he’s still keeping to his room a lot of the time.
Sounds of irregular movements in the water broke the silence and made him aware that someone was approaching him. He held his breath but refused to turn around, mostly because he didn’t know how to school his face, depending on who it was. A part of him wished that it was Pansy, because his pent up frustration demanded a let out, and he was itching to give her a proper scolding, telling her what a fucking bitch she was to treat her supposedly best friend like this.
Initially, after that first time Draco coughed up a flower, he’s fine. He keeps going to work, he keeps meeting up with his friends and going out to parties, and he and Potter keep hooking up occasionally. He’s even able to explain away that event as some sort of weird bodily malfunction, and soon, on the few occasions he thinks about it, it becomes a funny thing that happened once, his little
“Fuck,
- like this. At least not without retaliation. He narrowed his eyes at Malfoy, who was strutting out of the kitchen and onto the patio, hips swaying as he went.
They’ve just got back to Draco’s after abandoning the mandatory Friday pub trip. It only took one subtle but well placed hand on Harry’s arse while the two of them were ordering a new round for the others. Then everyone got so distracted when Harry announced that the drinks were on him that sneaking out was an easy task. Once outside, Draco pressed Harry up the wall, shoved his leg between Harry’s and pulled his earlobe into his mouth, and Harry got so turned on, he was ready to skip getting home entirely. At that moment he didn’t care if anyone were to come out and see them, the way Draco claimed him was nothing short of intoxicating.
Then someone (who sounded a lot like Pansy) shouted “What?” and there was the unmistakable sound of all their friends rushing to get to Harry’s front door first, then someone else (definitely Ron) yelled, “I don't need to see that!”
Harry was so scandalized that he didn’t even object as Malfoy bumped his hip so he could get to the sink, but as he watched Malfoy flounce out of the room, he thought they definitely needed to set up some boundaries for this to work.
He’s not even sure what it is he wants. He’s definitely not looking for a relationship with Malfoy. Sure, it’s easy enough to talk to him. Nice, even. Harry’s sort of come to think of him as a friend now, four months since their respective friend groups started hanging out together. Malfoy’s not such a giant prick as he was when they went to school, and Harry’s even noticed how funny he can be. And most importantly, he’s worked hard to redeem himself after the war, both in his work at the War Memorial Centre, as well as his regular volunteering at the orphanage. But more than friends is not something Harry’s interested in. At least he doesn’t think so.
Hermione looked thoroughly exasperated, arms folded across her chest. Harry was strongly reminded of McGonagall and wouldn’t be surprised if Hermione started tutting and tapping her foot. “I’m sorry boys, but did this
“ … “
Harry’s eyes rolled up towards Draco, pinning him in place. His voice came out low and rough. “Do you even know what I’ve been going through since the club? Before that?” Harry threw his hands out to the side and stalked towards Draco, who squeaked at the sudden movement. He stumbled backwards and his knees gave out beneath him when he hit the couch. Harry threw himself on top of Draco and pressed him back into the cushions.
“And I thought…,” Draco started but cut himself off.
Draco tilted his head and looked sweetly at Harry. “And why would I want a rougher texture to my hair?”
“Can the two of you shut the fuck up?!” Harry said, surprised at his own words and the force behind them. “I need to think.”
Everything after that was mostly a blur of blond hair and warm skin as their bodies moved together towards Draco’s chambers, while Harry’s arousal threatened to devour him.
“I love you, Draco,” he murmurs drowsily. “I can’t believe you came for me.”
“What’s wrong?” Harry says, trying to catch Draco’s eye. “Did I go too deep?”
The report they were given read as follows:
about discretion?” Draco hisses, kicking Harry in the shin again, hitting the same spot as before.
Nüwa stifled a yawn with her tail and tried to look as interested as possible, despite being bored out of her mind. When this human had arrived, with eyes like a green reed frog, she had been flattered when he asked if she’d be willing to answer a few questions. And after she’d got over the initial shock of being able to actually
“Nothing! Nothing of importance. Are you done?”

it for a prolonged time the same way we did.
Draco ran a hand through his hair, letting his head rest against his palm. “Because…” He took another deep breath, but it didn’t help, he still didn’t have the courage to look directly at Harry. “Because I thought you’d figured out how I feel about you. And I thought, why would you want to kiss me when you have a wonderful girlfriend, if not to mock me for those feelings?”
He heaves a deep breath, almost like a sob, and you turn around, surprised to see tears in his eyes. You kiss him again, trying to pour every confusing and exhilarating feeling into it.
You don’t know how to feel. Guilt and satisfaction are chasing each other’s tails in your head. Your body is completely boneless, and you’ve never felt this good in your entire life. This is the most intense experience you’ve ever had: lying here with Harry sleeping on you, his skin against yours, is nothing short of true bliss. But Leviticus clearly states that what you just did is an abomination, you’ve been told your entire life that loving another man is a sin, you’ve fought those feelings for so long.
“Fuck, that was—” he breathes, warm lips against Draco’s, soft tongue licking into his mouth. “You’re fucking amazing.”
Draco felt sick. The legilimency from their session must have worked after all. That meant...what they’d done was...God...It wasn’t Harry that had wanted him at all. He was such a fool. He’d taken advantage of Harry when he wasn’t in his right mind. He was no better than Alex and his cousin.
“Yes,
Harry stood next to the couch and reached out for Draco’s hand; the remaining clothes dropping as they moved into the bedroom. Draco manhandled Harry down onto the bed, climbing on top and pressing him into the mattress with his body.
Hermione gives Ron a significant look, but neither of them say anything more. Thankfully, Rose has managed to grab Ron’s spatula and is apparently tired of the lack of attention, so she flips it across the room, making them all snap out of it. Harry takes advantage of the commotion to slink away to the bathroom, where he stands in front of the mirror and tries to regain his equilibrium.
let Malfoy get under his clothes - no, skin.
“Always stampeding around like an erumpent in an apothecary,” Draco says, and Potter laughs, a little hysterically, like he’s startled that Draco is talking to him at all, and for some reason it makes Draco relax, like he’s evened out the playing field.
“Nothing’s going on,” he says, tongue thick and uncooperative, making his speech slurred.
is what’s going to end him? Love? The fucking irony.
That was it. That was why he was hurt. Not by your implied rejection, but because you let him down, you judged him after you’d told him he could trust you. The realisation makes your throat constrict in shame, forcing the air out of your lungs.
“Oh, Potter, back already?”
“You’re too generous, Alan.”
Every single time that he shows you how much he wants you to.
that Draco hadn’t meant to hurt him, but his mind was on edge, he felt frayed from the work resisting the false bond took. The way it had tugged at the edges of his emotions and clawed its way into the inmost parts of him leaving him raw.
“This is our first case, Harry.”
“When are you going to tell Draco that you’re in love with him?”
“Good.” Draco put his hands on Harry’s knees and gave them a reassuring squeeze, he had no idea when these subtle intimacies had begun to feel comfortable, but it broke his heart to think about why, and know that they’d all be gone soon. “Are you going to be okay for a few minutes? I was supposed to bring you back here to rest and then go back for my report on your prognosis and treatment schedule.” Draco was beginning to feel sick again, but he pushed it down. Now was not the time.
“Yeah, I’ll… I’ll think about it, Luna.” He drains the last remnants of his espresso and stands up. “Sorry, but I need to head home and take a nap or… something.”
But, you think as you follow him into your chamber, at least in this life you’re not hiding from yourself anymore. You’re true to yourself, you’re true to him, and you’re true to the way the Lord created you.
The knocking became more and more frantic, and Harry started to panic. He couldn’t have Neville find him like this, naked in Draco’s chambers. It was more than obvious what they had been doing.
little agreement, but now I’m beginning to discover that he’s about as well house trained as a baby erumpent.”
“Draco!” Pansy calls after him, but he ignores her as he stumbles towards her bathroom and locks the door, squinting against the shining clean tiles. Panting, he clutches the basin and tries to breathe through the pain as best he can.
Hermione and Ron only had time to shoot perplexed looks at each other before Malfoy continued. “I mean, at first I thought that the two of you wanted some privacy, and that was the reason you set up this
“I take it you aren’t including yourself in that.”
The rest of the session went by in this fashion, with Harry trying his best to accentuate his arse and chest, as well as “accidentally” brush Malfoy’s skin when he was reaching his arms out. Every time, Malfoy would flinch almost imperceptibly, and try to move away from Harry, but their mats were so close together that it was hard to do so without making too much of a fuss.
bring you here, Neville?”
Sheila Allen heaved a deep sigh and pinched the bridge of her nose. This was unbearable. She was too fucking old for this shit. She was too fucking
Draco nods slowly, and he hears Pansy gasp, but at least she has the decency to keep quiet.
“Malf— Draco.”
Draco froze, his eyes widening comically before flitting around the room to finally land on Ron, who seemed to try to make himself a permanent part of Harry’s sofa. After a split second, Draco leaned back into the hallway, not meeting Harry’s eyes once. “Wait, what’s that? Oh, no! I see Head Healer Patel’s patronus, oh this can’t be good, I really must be off.”
Draco came up behind him, the energy of his magic settling around Harry.
“Do stuff? Like what?” Ron said and was met with an eye roll from Hermione.
Heat rises in your face. Who else has heard you? Who else might have figured it out? Has Matthew figured it out?
“Pretty sure I already rubbed off on you anyway,” Harry laughed, easily dodging the pillow Draco threw at him. “What.”
And you scratch.
She smiles wistfully. “Yeah, I kind of noticed you’ve been a bit absent this evening.”
“You know, it’s getting late. You should get cleaned up before you get too tired to go home.”
“Well, what do you propose I wear then? All the clothes I’ve brought are basically like this.”
When night comes you wait until you hear that everyone around you is sleeping, and then you slowly, quietly slip out of your bed and out of the dormitory. You have at least three hours before Matins, before someone will notice you’re gone.
“Ron told me. Or, well, to be fair he accidentally let it slip.”
Hermione frowns. “I’ve only heard of that in old Japanese myths.”
Draco flexes his fingers. It’s still an unusual but welcome sensation to have them respond immediately. “They feel fine. A little stiff from underuse but much better than before.”
Draco looked through the peephole and waited for the man to walk away. This was it.
Draco mutters something that sounds like “Can’t believe I’m stuck with this imbecile.”
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Draco thought that Harry had just rejected him. Which meant that… he’d been serious with that cheesy come on.
Draco scoots forward, both of his hands grabbing Harry’s hair to press himself as close as he can, his heartbeat a steady rhythm against Harry’s chest.
“I was surprised to learn that you had any interest in her, though,” Draco says, as if he’s completely unaffected by Harry’s mouth on him.
“You did what now?”
Potter had come closer than Draco had anticipated, and even though he spoke softly it made Draco jump, almost losing his balance. He flung out his arm to steady himself, and it landed on Potter’s shoulder.
Hermione looks up at him, a crease between her eyebrows. “Is it someone we know?”
“Although I assume I’ll be wearing the clothes I’ll pass away in, are you sure you want a ghost dressed in a hospital gown following you around?”
That night you lie awake, staring out into the darkness, Brother Matthew’s words playing over and over in your head.
have some self control Harry and stop making your friends uncomfortable), I got up and started doing my daily work out. It’s week two of the fitness challenge, which means 20 each of push ups, crunches and squats.
“Holly? But…?”
“No. We decided we’re better off as friends, and that we should break it off before we grew wary of each other.”
,” she said, interrupting Potter in his rambling. “
Not knowing what to do, and afraid of waking Draco up, Harry lay down again on his back, staring at the ceiling, while images of the previous night swam through his mind. So apparently it had all really happened, it hadn’t just been a product of Harry’s imagination.
, I’ll hex your sorry arse into the next — oh.”
“So, Mr Malfoy, there’s no way around this, but I’m afraid I have some bad news,” Healer Goodwin says, her face schooled in a professional manner, but her eyes are kind and sympathetic.
In her own humble opinion, she was a very intelligent snake, and even though she couldn’t understand those gibberish sounds the humans used to communicate with each other, she had gathered enough information by lying pressed to the wall of her terrarium, observing the activities in the warehouse (well, at least as long as Medusa didn’t hog the best spot like she was wont to do, simply because that particular expanse of the glass was apparently “the most comfortable”).
“So… what could make someone start to cough up flower petals?”
When Hermione returns, she has a thick book in her arms, already opened and she’s flipping through the pages as she walks.
This morning when Harry woke up Draco had already left, but there was a tray with breakfast waiting for him in the kitchen: apple juice, porridge with raspberry jam, and two soft boiled eggs with soldiers, along with a note that said
“Yeah.”
Harry’s genuinely surprised by her words because he had no idea he’d been that obvious.
Harry scrambled up, confused by Neville’s statement, but didn’t have time to ask what he meant by that, because Draco made an impatient noise, crossing his arms across his chest. “So, what
Draco told me to stop the other day. Or to be fair, his exact words were “do you want me to leave the two of you alone?” and when I asked who this other person was he looked pointedly at my hand. It was a bit embarrassing, we were watching Baywatch (because it’s brainless and entertaining with attractive people in it) and that bloke Matt Brody was on the screen. He didn’t make any remark about me being turned on by a man, thankfully. I mean, not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s just that I’m straight as a nail. But I guess this lockdown is getting to me in weird ways.
, I’m so screwed.
Aya gave him a sympathetic smile. “Of course. Let us know if you need anything, anything at all.”
And the funniest of it all is how you still tell yourself that
Draco had to bite his tongue to not tell Potter how he only had eyes for him. He curled his hands into fists, pressing his nails into his palms and tried to focus on the pain rather than Potter’s proximity and sudden interest in him.
“Have you asked him?”
Behind her, Blaise is trying and failing to suppress a giggle, but Pansy looks like she’s about to stomp over to Ron and strangle him with her bare hands. Perhaps an
“Thank you.“
“Some people, unlike yourself,” Draco started, “can handle smaller portion sizes and have other things to do besides stuffing themselves at an overpriced dinner.”
You prepared your satchel earlier and hid it in the garden shed, and after retrieving it you sneak off to the gates, praying that they won’t make too much noise as you open them. The Lord’s will, it seems, is on your side tonight, because they glide open soundlessly and allow you to slip out unnoticed.
She tuts, but lets it go as the oldest child starts examining your supply of dried chamomile, and she promptly leaves, leaving a welcome silence behind her.
“Hmm? Oh! Yes! Yes, I’m fine. Are you going to try that on?”
“Kiss me,” Harry moans, pleads, and Draco’s eyes snap up to his, a silent question.
And afterwards, when they’re lying sprawled out on Draco’s bed, their bodies cooling off and Harry’s semen drying on his stomach, Harry still doesn’t know what he wants from Draco. He only knows that he definitely wants this,
“Okay, are we done?” Ron sighs. “Have we sorted out why everyone is here, so we can sort out why the two of you are… like
Your press yourself nearer to him, whispering his name. He looks at you with foggy eyes, pupils blown wide with lust. And yet you can’t look at him as the words tumble out of you in a rush.
Harry nods slowly, feigning agreement. Luna has no idea what she’s talking about. There’s no way Harry would come out unscathed if he told Draco he’d be interested in anything more than being fuckbuddies, or even hint at it. He’s not even sure that’s what
“Come on! You have to do this one, it’s definitely tradition!” she said as she dragged them into the circle of dancing people.
Made some brownies today. Draco had five while complaining loudly that I’ll ruin his physique if I’m going to keep this up, though he refuses to join the fitness challenge. Not that he has anything to worry about, he’s as slim as ever.
“Draco’s in hospital.”
“If that means meeting other people, I need to take a shower first,” Harry said, “I wasn’t made for this kind of humidity.”
“Oh don’t worry about him. Did I mention those little love potions we provided you with prior to your visit have a bit of a backdoor built into them? Sort of an insurance policy of sorts if something goes wrong and the wizard who brings them in can’t pay or tries to change their mind. With the right spell and a little of the legilimency we use here, we can switch their allegiance to whatever witch or wizard we choose.”
Draco nodded, eyes bright, his bottom lip disappearing between his teeth. Harry couldn’t wait to suck it into his mouth again.
“I never realized how comforting windows were,” Harry murmured, looking at the walls, “but not being able to see outside really messes with the mind, yeah?”
You’ve particularly fallen for tending the gardens. It’s become your own solace, watching the seeds sprout and grow into plants, digging up the earth, and watering the soil so it can blossom and nourish new life. It’s comforting in a way that you haven’t known before. You let yourself believe that the touch of the tiny leaves is the touch of another human being, your skin so depraved of contact that you can easily envision someone stroking your neck as you stretch to reach the top shelf and the lavender tickles you behind your ear. And sometimes, sometimes, when you’re alone and no one is watching, you let your hands wander over your own skin, tickling the fair hairs on your forearms, let your palm rest on your cheek and warm it, and imagine it’s the touch of another human, of someone you could love.
Thinking that he’s okay with having to wait a while until he’ll get to suck Draco off, Harry drags his gaze from Draco’s twitching cock to his face. “I really want you to fuck me,” he says before he pulls the soft fabric down. Draco’s erection springs free and bumps against his stomach while Harry lodges the elastic just under his balls and his buttocks. “Like this.”
“Well, you could be sweaty from all the newly engaged sex we just had for all they know,” Draco said mockingly.
Goodwin stares at him for a moment before she turns to Draco with a look that clearly says “really?”, but he just shrugs one shoulder unapologetically. He wants to snort at Harry for being so ridiculous, but apparently, life changing events such as almost dying has had some effect on him and he only finds it incredibly endearing.
“Now?” Harry asks, giving his cock a tentative stroke and hissing at the realisation that he’s getting dangerously close already. “Can you — oh
“Yeah,” Ron snorted, “I thought we’d have a third wizarding war when Hermione suggested you take Parkinson’s old room, but —”
(I lost.)
Draco gasps at Harry’s words but tries to hide it with a moan as Harry grabs one of his arse cheeks to sling his leg around Harry’s waist. “Tell me.”
“Yes, sir. Sorry.” As soon as they were out the door Harry started giggling.
Robards growled. “Are we done with the pleasantries now because we are running out of time. Boys, explain yourselves.” A collective sigh went around the room and Harry and Draco began their story.
“I’m trying to eat some dinner, and I’d like to have it on a plate, you know, like a civilised person.”
I’ve never held another cock besides my own, but it was… exciting? It felt sort of the same but different? Also the fact that I was holding a cock, but I only felt it in my hand and not
Harry gazed at Draco, his lips quirked in a devious smirk. “Isn’t this what you want?”
“Apparently not.”
You sit up and kiss him, cutting him off. “It’s not. Not if it was out of necessity, out of survival.”
“So, er… that’s how we ended up getting bonded on this mission,” Harry concluded, looking up at Robards who was sitting with closed eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose.
…” she thought for a bit for the right word, not too crude, she knew how sensitive the humans could be. “
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco pants wetly, his body pressed tightly to Harry’s. “You’re hard again. You’re fucking unbelievable.”
“Er, yeah, I did.”
Harry tried his best to not look at the way Draco’s waist was accentuated by the navy blue double breasted waistcoat he was wearing, or how his breeches drew attention to his crotch area. “What did I do now?”
She motioned with her tail to keep him talking, concentrating on the man’s - Malfoy’s - pulse again. And then she felt it, with no uncertainty, what she had seen before in his behaviour, could sense it in her entire body, so much that it almost made her dizzy, almost made
Harry snorted, glancing at all the people around them who were standing in a circle around a great pole that looked like someone tried to draw the deathly hallows but messed up. It looked more like a triangle on a stick with a circle at each end, covered in greenery, and Harry had to admit it looked a bit like a giant penis had been stuck in the ground. To top it all off, everyone present was repeatedly kicking thin air in front of them in time with the violin and accordion music.
You understand at once that this was the wrong thing to say: he stills under your hands in an unnatural way, and when you look at him, his eyes have darkened and his face has closed up. You wish you could take it back. However uncomfortable you were before, it’s nothing compared with this unease.
“Truthfully? The intimacy. You know how long it’s been, I think I’ve forgotten how to date.”
,” Draco said, dragging Harry with him, “let’s see our room and if the bed is suitable for our needs.”
“I was a bit cold,” Draco murmured, his gaze dropping to Harry’s throat.
“Huh. Don’t they know check out closed an hour ago?”
“Do you ever use Legilimency on Professor Potter to make him do what you want?”
“It’s the truth—but yeah,” Draco conceded, “this feels really wrong.”
“I can’t—” Harry began, before swallowing and starting over. “I can’t believe he remembered.”
Harry blinked and Draco stood still, an odd, agonising yearning pounding against his chest. He wanted to reach out and hold Harry, to comfort him, to make sure he knew that Draco would never let anyone do to him what was being done to the poor victims at the retreat. But it went so much deeper than that for Harry.
Potter nodded slowly.
And apparently, that’s all it takes for Draco to actually lose control, to let instinct take over, and with a growl he starts pounding into Harry mercilessly, his cock slamming into him again and again, and Harry wraps his legs around Draco’s hips to free his hands, letting them slide down to Draco’s arse to spur him on, get him in deeper. His head hits the headboard with the force of Draco’s thrusts but he doesn’t care, it’s too good to care about such mundane things, Harry could get a concussion for all he cares, as long as gets to have Draco fuck him like this, with this raw yet tender passion.
The praise goes straight to Harry’s cock and he whimpers as Draco continues to quickly but thoroughly work him open with fingers and tongue. It feels so good, Harry is so unbelievably turned on and he starts rocking back to meet Draco as he’s pumping his fingers into him.
Harry puts a hand on the small of Malfoy’s back, lets his fingers slip under his waistband to brush the soft skin there, and has to bite down on a smile at the shiver he gets in response.
, the parts of you that you don’t show anyone else.”
He notices that Draco has started undulating his hips in small movements against Harry’s thighs, and his voice is breathy when he says “Turn around.”
She heaves a great sob and turns her face away, biting her lip. He wants to tell her that it’s alright to cry, that she doesn’t have to be strong for him, but he knows that’d only make her angry with him.
“Did it now?”
paid them not to fix it.”
Suddenly he saw Harry spring into action grabbing the man's wand with one hand and hitting him squarely in the solar plexus with the other, sending him to the floor in pain. He kicked him in the gut for good measure and before Alex could turn he had his wand trained firmly on him.
kept it a secret that he had a crush on Potter back at Hogw—” she said, but interrupted herself. “Er, nevermind.”
“Yes. Very rare things happen to magic out here at sea.”
“Yes?”
He smiles, his eyes still closed, but his face is so relaxed, so soft and open, and you drink in every line of his face. “Harry,” he breathes.
Draco is quiet for a few long seconds, and Harry is almost beginning to worry that he’ll tell him it’s the stupidest idea he’s ever heard.
Sorted out my wardrobe today and organised it. I’m thinking about giving some of the clothes to the war orphans charity shop.
“Yes.”
“You are the absolute worst, I cannot
“The Hanahaki Disease is a rare magical condition, known from Japanese lore, where the victim of unrequited love starts to cough up flowers. The flowers are said to be a symbol of the love, growing inside the patient, most commonly in the lungs and around the heart, but in severe cases the roots can even follow the blood stream, making the patient stiff and immobile.
Draco pointedly did not move towards Harry, and, after a silent conversation threatening murder took place, Draco motioned for Harry to throw the parchment over. He took it with a sharp smile and blatantly ignored the smirk that was shot his way.
made him make those sounds, that
Last time we were doing it, he grabbed both of our cocks in one hand, and then he spelled some lube on them, and he wanked us both off at the same time. It was… like everything else we’ve done it felt so good. But that must be because it’s so new. I mean, I’ve never felt an erection against my own, the feeling of it was so… it was so smooth. I couldn’t look away, the way his hand was pumping us, and the way his cock twitched beside mine, it was mesmerising, and I just wanted
The other week they tried it with Harry on his hands and knees, but once Draco had pushed the head of his cock inside, he’d sunk into Harry a bit too quickly and it felt awkward, not at all how Harry had imagined it. But Draco noticed Harry tensing up and withdrew without comment or trying to persuade Harry to keep going, instead replacing his cock with his tongue until Harry was like soft clay in his hands.
Harry laughed again, deciding not to bring up all the things Draco did that annoyed the living hell out of him.
“Oh,” someone said softly, and Harry didn’t need to look to know it was Luna.
“No, there’s nothing you can do about it, Potter,” Draco spits, suddenly regaining some of his vigour and using it to stand up. He buttons his blood stained shirt with short angry motions. “I know it must be extremely difficult for you not being the hero for once, but in this case you’ll just have to take your fucking saviour complex and shove it.”
“Forgive me,” you mumble, “this won’t take long.”
“Do you really mean that, Harry? Everything you just said, is it true?”
Draco mentioned at one of those midnight tea parties of ours that it was the same way with Astoria. I don’t think that’s why they broke up (same as it wasn’t the reason Ginny and I broke up), but it was wearing on him that she knew some of it but couldn’t
“Surprise me,” he says, flashing Draco a wolfish grin. “I trust your judgement.”
“Well, the most common way, one that people use to this day, although no one takes it very seriously anymore, is to pick seven kinds of flowers, and then put them under your pillow. And then you’re supposed to dream about who you’ll end up marrying.”
into the touch. “So did you like it a lot because you loooooove me?” Harry mumbles into Draco’s ear, laughing when Draco kicks him in the shin for the third time. He really does have impeccable aim.
, letting the stress of the week rinse off them. Back resting against the lumpy stuffed sofa, Harry sits with a dopey smile, looking around himself and feeling strangely content.
Draco shrugged, turning to his side. “There are worse things that could happen,” he mumbled.
You wait, because you’re not sure if he’s angry with you or if there’s something else that makes him shut it in.
Draco got out a few words in between kisses. “Fuck me, Harry. I need you.”
Today I did the exercises after breakfast, because I thought I’d be alone. But of course Draco managed to leave his room just as I was doing the final  squats. He stared at me for a full minute, asked me “what in the ever living fuck” I was doing, and then accused me of disturbing his morning with my loud grunting. I would’ve kicked him if my leg wasn’t so sore. I know that wouldn’t be the best thing to do to the flatmate that you’re stuck with for an unforeseeable future, but at that moment I didn’t really care.
loves you, even if it’s not the right one?”
Malfoy sauntered up to Harry, and Harry almost dropped the orange he was trying to squeeze juice from as Malfoy came to stand not even an inch from him, his body heat radiating towards Harry.
The truth was, Potter was the reason Draco had stayed for so long. He knew it was futile, knew that Potter was already taken, but looking had never hurt anyone, had it? Not that it would help him get over his stupid crush that he’d harboured since at least their eighth year at Hogwarts, but it wasn’t as if he had any other options. And he needed to be a good friend to Pansy. And if being a good friend included being around Potter a lot more, well, that was just an inevitability.
“It seems to be working, I feel a bit lighter.”
“Okay,” Draco said, rather breathlessly, in an attempt to get back on track. “Do we have a question that has to do with Mindhealing or its purpose?”
“I love you Draco,” he says, quietly. “And I’ll wait for you. I’ll always wait for you.”
Draco scoffed, shaking his head. “And to think I usually defend you when people call you oblivious.”
“From me. I made it. Or, well, I got Hermione to help me make it because I famously suck at potions.”
“See you when you get home this afternoon,
. Where the hell did they go?”
Harry separated himself and began to climb off Draco, but was stopped by a sharp grip on his biceps. His dejected look immediately switched to confusion. Draco was panting harshly and it was hard to think with the lingering feeling of Harry’s teeth in his tendons, but he had to get this out.
“Well, I…” Potter still seems nervous, and he takes a big gulp of air before he speaks in a rush, “As far as I can tell, it seems that someone has developed feelings for someone. And… it doesn’t seem fair to continue this then, does it?”
was throwing a raucous party the night before.”
You don’t tell him that you’re not sure you’re thankful for that, because you’re not. His presence has woken something in you that you’re afraid to let loose completely. You’re feeling more alive than you have in years, but with that feeling comes the crushing sin, tainting everything. His smile falters, and he seems to guess what your silence means.

making me miss the Appleby Arrows vs the Kenmare Kestrels on the wireless.”
Harry props himself up on one elbow, and you open your eyes to look at him. He’s so unfairly beautiful in the scarce morning light, with his wild hair and deeply green eyes. You bite your lip to keep from kissing him, and his eyes drop to your mouth.
“Only for a while. And then Flora’s dragon necklace reminded me of you, and that got me hard again.”
feel the same as he. A quickening of his pulse, a shallowness to his breath, a shift in his muscles on the insides of his thighs.
Harry makes a strangled sound, like a sob slipping out unbidden, and then it happens, the thing you’ve been dreading, the thing you’ve wanted for so long: you lean in, and you kiss him. You kiss him, because you can’t stand not kissing him anymore. You kiss him, and you can’t remember why you haven’t done this before. You kiss him, and it’s all you imagined it to be, and more, because it’s
, one foot resting on his opposite knee. He looked up at Harry with a bored expression as he stormed in.
Harry’s at a loss for words. They haven’t really talked about their past other than what they covered when Ginny and Pansy started dating, but since they got together, Draco’s told Harry enough for him to understand that he fancied Harry, if grudgingly, even when they went to school. He wants to say the same, but it wouldn’t be true because he was too busy hating Draco and then feeling sorry for him, not realising what his constant obsession with Draco was until years later.
to the human and understand him, she’d felt important, useful. She loved being able to help nail the perpetrators that had held her and her family in captivity.
, that feels so fucking good,” Harry says when Draco starts to lick his cock from the root and slowly up to the head, because it’s safe, it’s within the things he’s allowed to say without giving too much away.
“And not…?”
“Exactly.” Goodwin nods. “But… let’s not tell him he was right, shall we?”
been fucking for the past six months, why is this the first time Potter’s become stuck?”
Do I sign off? How does one do this?
“I mean, yeah I can get that it’s annoying to find hair in the drain, or that I leave toothpaste on the sink, or that I forget to wipe down the kitchen counter. But he’s constantly throwing parties, going on dates, having… you know… people over. To… do stuff.”
And four days later, after Draco had cooked him dinner as a thank you for the shampoo, after they had somehow ended up in Harry’s bed and Harry had slowly and carefully slid the rose covered briefs off Draco’s body (because “these are
Fortunately that got Harry’s attention and he cast several detection spells around the room. The floor immediately began to thrum under their feet, and the couple, already back at their lovemaking, appeared to be enjoying it. Thoroughly.
they stop, once they notice that Draco’s not in any danger. As if Harry would ever let him.
“The Hermit’s hut. Long ago, or so I’ve been told, there was a man who used to live here,” you say, stroking your hand over the wooden panels, rough with neglect. The ceiling is so low you almost hit your head on it as you step further in. “He was originally a monk, but for some reason, he wanted to live on his own. So he built this little house for himself, with enough room for one person.”
Draco scoffed. “Right. Perhaps you want to hear me say it? Is that it? Do you want me to admit how pathetic I am for pining after you for the better part of a year despite you having a very lovely and beautiful girlfriend? Because I am well aware of how pitiful that makes me, Potter, no need to worry about that.”
He gives you a shaky smile, bringing your lips together once more, making your heart beat violently in your chest.
And yet, when you think about it, it strikes you as strange how quickly the weather changed, just when you were asking the Lord for a sign.
Anyway, to have something to do (besides absentmindedly touching myself,
You walk for what feels like hours before you realise you’ve passed this particular tree before. You also realise you have no idea where you are, or where you’re supposed to go. You close your eyes, trying to focus on breathing deeply and not letting the fear take you over.
Anyway, we’re better off as friends. Even if she does tease me about how I can never hold onto any girl for longer than half a year, tops. It’s not a very flattering look on her to be so smug about that she’s still the girl I’ve been together with the longest. Maybe once this disease has a cure I can start dating again and find someone nice.
“It must be someone really special,” Cho adds gently, stroking his back.
Harry blinks, unsure what to say. “Sorry, but I don’t think… That’s not what he wants from me,” he says, lowering his voice.
“I keep telling you, Draco, no, I haven’t. Not with another person.”
But Draco’s words make Harry stop kissing his way down Draco’s stomach, make him look up at him with a frown. “She told you that?”
I just don’t know where that leaves me.
“Yeah.”
“They bring out your calves, though,” he said without thinking first.
Potter bends down, but he needs to put his knee on the bed to reach Draco, and Draco refuses to make things easier for him by moving closer. He smirks when Potter has to brace himself on the headboard to reach him.
“I’m sorry Harry, I just,” she said, but covered her mouth with her hand as she started giggling again. Harry looked at her in utter bewilderment, then at Ron, who had the appearance of someone who was going to be sick.
“Which part? The one where I said he’d be rotting away in Azkaban? I meant that with my whole being.”
that this week was over soon.
You stay quiet, not knowing what to say. You get the feeling that this was some sort of divine intervention, like the last time you ended up in this place. But surely, it must be your own wishful thinking?
It’s funny how you can regret something and still keep wanting it so badly.
“You’re home early,” Draco answers from the sofa where he’s sitting, long legs crossed in front of him and a book in his hands that covers his crotch. It’s more of a simple statement than a question, but Harry hears the satisfaction, hears that Draco knows Harry skipped class to come here and that it makes him immensely pleased. Instead of his usual white, Draco’s wearing a dark green shirt, no doubt to make Harry wonder what’s underneath, the absolute prick.
Draco looks up at him from across the table with an amused quirk of his mouth, and Harry’s stomach does a little flip. Ginny, who’s sitting in the seat next to Harry’s, pokes him. “Wasn’t it so you could provide your ex-girlfriend with a first class custom-made broom?”
Blaise smirks, a dangerous glint in his eyes. Harry thinks fleetingly that they need to make him sign some sort of magical contract to prevent him from taking this story to the press. “When Draco’s patronus came for Pansy and I heard his message, I couldn’t pass up on the opportunity to see this disaster.” Blaise's smile grows wider with every word, and Harry decides that they definitely need to make a contract. Preferably along the same lines of the one Hermione made for the DA.
“Well… “ Healer Goodwill glances at Pansy, who nods for her to continue. “It took us some time to revive you after… You were almost gone there, for a while. We had to clear your airways and we’ve given you a potion to help your breathing and oxygen intake.”
“I’m sure,” Harry says, surprised to hear how firm his voice sounds.
out. ‘Malfoy’s up to something’ this and ‘he’s hiding in the Room of Requirement’ that.)”
“Who is he?” She’s still staring in front of her, too upset with him to grace him with a look.
You stare at him blankly, your mind whirring in every direction at once, but you can’t seem to gather your thoughts properly.
“Bullshit. Have you seen yourself lately? You look like a fucking ghost.”
He sighs, dropping his hands. “All my life, I used to think I was a sinner, Draco, that I was weak for having these… urges. That if I just punished myself enough, they would go away. And then I met you. And I know now, that… this isn't a choice. This is how I was made, this is how the Lord created me. This is how He created you, too.”
In an effort to clear his mind, and also because he desperately needs to pee, Harry leaves the edge of the dance floor and heads for the loos. Locked inside one of the cubicles he rests his forehead against the tiles (after a perfunctory
, it’s Harry, and you’re finally doing this.
But the most common are roses. Red roses with velvety thick, dark crimson petals. Something a lovesick teenager would give their crush for Valentine’s Day.
“Oh, I think there are some things that can still be uncovered.” Granger’s flushed face and glassy eyes showed that she’d obviously had quite a bit to drink, and Draco suspected that the heated look she gave Weasley wouldn’t be so apparent under normal circumstances. It still gave him the distinct urge to vomit.
“Of course it is. I’m disappointed I didn’t figure it out sooner.”
“You know how that is, don't you Draco?”
Harry sighed, and with what he hoped was an apologetic smile, he turned to Ebba, who was staring at them both with her mouth hanging open.
“I know you’ve been fucking, what other ways are there?” Ron says, making Harry wish the ground would swallow him whole right now. Or at the very least that Ron would shut up. “No, wait,” Ron continues, “don’t answer. I prefer living in oblivion.”
Malfoy gave him an arched eyebrow in answer, shaking his cock a little before he reached over to take a wad of toilet paper. “What the fuck does it look like I’m doing?”
“Well, take it up with reception, there’s nothing
“Well, it seems like you’ve worked things out, for now at least,” she says with a hint of sarcasm.
You try to focus on the words, so familiar, you know them all by heart and they’ve always managed to soothe you, but tonight they slip past you unnoticed, because all you can concentrate on is to get Harry’s attention. You miss his presence beside you, miss the way the heat from his body is a comfort to you, miss seeing his lips moving from the corner of your eye.
They already had. And now, the fuck was trying to make up for it in the worst possible way.
Ron nods, scratching the side of his nose with his wand, which makes the potatoes fly up in the air and crash down into the pot, splashing water everywhere. “Shit!” he says, aiming his wand at the mess to siphon the water from the cupboard doors.
You'll never ever let him forget how high you’re able to take him. How hard he’ll fall if you were to let go.
“Don’t ‘yeah’ me and shrug like this isn’t a disaster! What do you propose we do now?”
Harry closed his eyes and a small sound escaped his lips.
. I could actually
He stills, his hands on your waist going stiff, before he pushes you to the side. When you look at him, he keeps his gaze firmly on the water running past you, drawing his knees up to his chin.
“Okay, fine, I can take a hint,” Potter says, flashing Draco one of his most dazzling smiles that would’ve made him weak in the knees if he weren’t already lying down. Not that he’d ever admit that to Potter, who proceeds to rake a hand through his soft messy curls and then stretch his entire body with an exaggerated yawn.
He turns his head, lifting his chin and looking at you defiantly. “I think you know what happened.”
Draco swallows and his neck turns pink, which Harry assumes must mean that he’s flushing deeply at the moment. It’s a shame that Harry can’t see Draco’s face, because Draco flushing is something that Harry always finds endearing to watch. It makes Draco seem more approachable, more vulnerable, when he loses his haughty demeanor.
He didn’t get any further, because right then, Harry decided that he needed to do what he did best: use his gut. And his gut told him that he was pants with words, especially compared to Draco. And he wanted to make Draco stop talking, so he did the first thing that came to mind. He stepped closer and pressed his lips to Draco’s. It was probably the most chaste kiss he’d ever experienced, and yet it gave his stomach that funny swooping feeling again. Draco made a funny sound, like a mix of a squeak and a sharp inhale, and Harry realised that maybe this wasn’t what Draco wanted and started to pull back. But then he was thoroughly proven wrong when Draco grabbed him by the collar and pushed him backwards until they hit the opposite wall. Harry gasped when his head thumped against it, and then again when Draco opened his mouth and
“So fucking crass,” Draco scoffs, but when Harry wraps his lips around the crown of his erection to suck lightly at it, he hisses in pleasure, his hands coming to tangle in Harry’s hair. “Oh
.” She turned to the man again, regarding him, reading him. “
“Is it really that much fun playing Truth or Dare with a bunch of couples?”
“Are you sure you’re alright, Malfoy? You look a little pale.”
Even though Harry loves the command in Draco’s voice, he’s just about to say something about how he couldn’t care less if his floors get ruined. But the way Draco looks at him, like he wants to devour him, leaves no room for objection, so he obediently toes off his shoes, kicking them to the side.
The students all laughed again, and Harry said “Hey!”, but when Draco looked over at him he was smiling fondly.
Stay insideee
“I… You… I… I’m going to reception!”
“Look at me, Draco,” he says softly, caressing your cheek with his thumb. “Are you really sure you want to do this?”
“He knows.”
“Yes, thank you. We’ll be there in a few minutes.”
Draco runs a hand through Harry’s hair, lets it rest at the nape of his neck. He smiles at the memory of Harry’s stubbornness, but then he’s almost overcome with horror at what could’ve happened, at how he almost let his pride and fear of being rejected kill him. There are a lot of things to unpack here he realises, but for now he decides to focus on just enjoying being alive and well.
Harry even stayed when the residues of the wilting flowers started leaving Draco. He held Draco in his arms as he heaved and gurgled it out into a conjured bowl, stroked his hair and kissed his clammy forehead afterwards. And even though Draco was mortified to have Harry witness these gross bodily functions, it was soothing to have him there.
Harry leaned in closer to him. “Can’t you at least try to have some fun?”
You push him away.
“Yes, quite okay.”
“My mind was being forced, and it’s sick! The people that are doing this are sick! How could you just sit there and do it to me!”
Ron lifted his hands in a placating gesture. “Alright, mate, fair point.”
“Don’t,” he says. “Don’t say it. I know.”
“Oh, Harry, hi!” Neville said, a little more cheerfully than before. “Thought I’d find you here when you weren’t in your own room.”
Still, you can’t erase an upbringing of learning that what you’ve done with Harry is wrong, so every day you pray for strength to keep away from him, to treat him as a friend. But every time you come near him, it all crumbles and you can’t help yourself, you need to feel him again, and every second spent in his presence without touching him is a waste of time.
at this point.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut. “Yes,” he answers, mortified beyond belief, but Draco exhales shakily, pressing himself closer to Harry, his hands resuming their task of running along his back.
Although Draco is making things a bit easier by staying away from most social events, and when he’s around he never stays long. But still, there’s that constant gnawing feeling inside Harry of rejection, of almost having what he wanted but have it taken away from him.
Neville nodded. “Yes, please. I’m really worried, I haven’t seen him since I let him out for his pre-breakfast pecking, and that was hours ago.”
Harry pulls Draco closer, laughs against his lips and lets himself be guided into his own home while Draco quickly strips off both of their coats and scarves, tossing them carelessly to the floor.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Ron told her, making Harry look up at him with a grateful grin. But when he did, Ron didn’t return his gaze: he was staring at Hermione and the two of them seemed to be having a silent conversation. Harry looked between them in confusion, and after a moment, Ron looked like he’d had an epiphany. “Ooooh. You’re right, Hermione, how did I not see this coming?”
“That’s your idea of comfort?” Harry rolled his eyes. Draco let his eyes fall to Harry’s chest. His breathing returned to normal and Draco lowered his eyes even farther, Harry’s fists were unclenching and rising up to meet Draco’s arms. “Please,” Harry said, his voice pleading. “Tell me that we’re going to get these fuckers?”
It was a bit awkward again after, but then he chuckled and told me it was nice and that maybe we could do it again sometime, what would the harm be? And I agreed, because we’re both single, we’re both horny, and we both know that this won’t lead anywhere because we’re both straight, but why not give a friend a helping hand? (Pun definitely intended.)
He stops and looks at you, the green leaves around you reflecting in his eyes and making them look more intense, more innocent. “For what?”
. I wish he’d stop talking about her all the damn time, I don’t need to be reminded of how amazing she is
“M-Malfoy? What—?” Harry said, not sounding at all like a stuttering mess.
“Nope.”
Goodwin nods again, checking that the Dicta-Quill gets it all down. “That would be the plants leaving your system. You might experience some more of it, but it will lessen soon if that’s the case.” She smiles gently at him. “How about your joints?”
“Yes please, Professor Potter,” Draco said, feeling his stomach rumble at the prospect of a Hogwarts’ dinner, “but first I want to see that hole you blew in the wall first.”
“Er, yeah. Sure.”
You dress in silence, everything so raw and fragile between you. You don’t know what to tell him. You don’t even know what to tell yourself.
There are too many emotions chasing around inside him: fear for Draco, horror at the way he’ll perish, suffocated by flowers. But most prevalently, there’s an undercurrent of loss, betrayal. Because now he knows, with no uncertainty, that Draco actually does love. It’s just that he doesn’t do it with Harry. Because if he did, he wouldn’t be dying from unrequited love, since Harry somehow, somewhere along the line, has developed feelings for him. No, Draco is in love with someone else, so much so that it chokes him, quite literally.
“I would say this gives us the opportunity to take things slow, don’t you think?”
Pansy stands by the fireplace, one hand holding the mantlepiece, the other one pinching the bridge of her nose. Harry has never seen her looking so done with everything. She draws a breath to speak, and Harry braces himself for what’s to come, only for her to be interrupted by Ron snorting somewhere behind Harry.
“Oh that’s Draco’s,” said Pansy. “I promised I’d give it to you since he couldn’t make it today.”
When Ron and Hermione kept looking at him with their mouths hanging open, he scoffed and turned around, and this time he
The first time it happens it takes Draco completely by surprise, if he’d even dare to admit what’s going on.
It’s so strange that I can’t stop thinking about
underwear, Potter, I will
“Need I remind you of what the bible says about such alliances?” he says, cutting you off. “And need I remind you of what happens with those who disobey the will of the Lord like that?”
You notice you laugh more around him, and even when you’re not with him, your chest feels like it’s filled with a blazing light, filling up every forgotten corner inside you and chasing away the darkness.
“I suppose it’s not my place to enquire about your relationship with our Lord,” you say in an attempt to smooth things over, and you decide to leave it be. For now. You’ve met enough pilgrims in your time here to know that this kind of reaction means he did something he needs to atone for. You want to tell him that whatever he did, he’s forgiven, but that’s not your place.
“It’s fine, you get used to it, working at a place like this,” the wizard said, smiling even brighter. “Love is in the air!”
It feels strangely comforting to admit what’s going on between him and Draco, however covertly. He’s barely even admitted it to himself, or dared to use that particular word. “Crush” has been a frequent one, or “fancy”. But never “love”.
Game on, Malfoy, Harry thought to himself. Game fucking on.
Potter was trying to change the music as Thomas and Finnigan’s dancing was getting more and more filthy. Ginny was jumping around them in some sort of attempt at dancing, and even though she looked like she was having some sort of seizure, it was still charming somehow. But it only took one very meaningful look from Granger to make her stroll up to Potter and lower the volume.
Harry kept his gaze firmly on Draco, cheeks gone pink and lips wonderfully kiss-swollen.
“Fuck,” Potter says, and it actually sounds like he’s distressed.
They began with a sun salutation, and as Harry semi squatted and raised his arms, his top rose a bit. He smirked when he heard a sharp intake of breath to his left. He turned his head slightly and smiled at Malfoy.
Draco frowns. “Evening? How long was I out?”
, that was the cheesiest line I’ve ever heard. I’m surprised I agreed to take you home that first time.”
The words
“Did you see this?” Harry said, waving the copy of
The fitness challenge is up to 60 reps of each motion, and I did 10 more just because.
Now Harry and Draco had gotten together before at pub nights, ministry functions, etc., but this week was different. Everything was more intimate and Harry’s heart really couldn’t take it. He had finally had enough come Friday and his control snapped. They were having a few drinks at a club after dinner when all of a sudden Harry felt a hand on his thigh and he froze. Now, this shouldn’t have startled him considering they’d been trying to touch often, just to get used to the familiarity,  but this one caught him off guard. Draco’s hand was closer to his crotch than it had been before and he wasn’t looking at Harry. He followed Draco’s line of sight and spotted a well-built man eyeing their table. Harry wasn’t sure what was going on, or even if their act was convincing enough, but he wasn’t willing to risk an early discovery. He slipped his hand under Draco’s chin and turned his face towards him. He slid towards Draco in the booth, tangling their legs under the table.
dieeeee
“Potter! What in the name of Merlin are you doing in my room?!”
“I’m not… I have never met a woman with whom I would like to…
Burying his nose between Draco’s shoulder blades, Harry snorts. “Well, at least nothing else is stiff right now.” Luckily he has the presence of mind to move his leg before Draco manages to kick his shin again.
But before Harry had time to properly panic, the door opened.
“I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you all day, and I had to leave my friends after lunch to lock myself in one of the toilets so I could relieve  the pressure.” The words tumble out of Harry in a rush while he wrestles with Draco’s trousers to get them off as fast as possible. It’s hard to concentrate on the task with Draco’s erection directly in front of him, straining against the flower printed fabric.
Slowly, oh so slowly, he pulls himself out a bit before he rocks back into you, and the feeling is too much, not enough, the best sensation you’ve ever had, and it makes you throw your head back as you draw a sharp breath.
Draco lifts his head to look at him, his lips swollen and shiny, eyes blown so wide with lust they’re almost black. He scoots up and lets his mouth glide along Harry’s lower lip, fingers grazing over his rapidly beating pulse.
Harry draws a shuddering breath, sniffling. “Yeah. It is,” he whispers. He brings a hand to wipe his cheeks. “Shit. I’m so sorry, Draco, I shouldn’t have said anything, I shouldn’t have told you that I love you, but I—I do. I think I have for a while now. I just came back from a date where all I could think about was you. And… I know it doesn’t help you, but maybe at least it’s nice to know that
Harry’s at a loss for words, all he can do is nod, which brings out that glint in Draco’s eyes.
“Oh please, Potter, I’m merely fetching a glass,” Malfoy said, pressing himself so close that his arm brushed Harry’s before he reached up towards the cupboard. Harry’s head was still turned to him, and suddenly he had his nose full of the smell from Malfoy’s armpit, and Harry almost lost his bearings. It wasn’t that the smell was unpleasant at all, but rather… enjoyable? It was like a concentrated essence of Malfoy’s smell, musky and sweet, and Harry felt a tingling sensation in his spine, spreading forwards to his belly and down lower. What the fuck?
“Where did that expression come from, by the way? Seems kind of exclusionary, don’t you think?”
“Right, it’s settled then. We both find ourselves a suitable partner for the night, or for the duration of the trip, even, and we make sure we sleep in their rooms. You’re not half as dim-witted as you look, Potter, I’ll give you that.”
in my life think that this… cupboard would count as first class.”
“But… that was a marriage bond, right?”
Draco cleared his throat. “Right. Chopping.”
You try not to think back to how it felt to have his skin beneath your fingertips, feeling his warmth and watching the life return to him. He looks at you, his gaze unwavering, but guarded. There’s something he’s refraining from telling you. You clear your throat.
! Then shouldn’t the cabins be single ones?”
Malfoy gave him a blank look before shaking himself and regaining his usual poise. “Fine, I made a wager with Pansy and Blaise that I could beat you in this race, and I know that I still have the same ability to distract you as I did in school.”
Goodwin looks at him amusedly and then winks at Draco. “Feisty,” she whispers, and Draco snorts.
“And how was that achieved?”
what we’re doing here, we’ve been doing it for months now and it’s working fine. You don’t have to bring it up every single time,” Potter says, his voice sounding a bit subdued, his back towards Draco while he’s buttoning his trousers.
So we kissed and we laughed and we kissed some more and laughed at the same time, and thankfully, somehow I got the presence of mind to turn off the stove which was lucky because the food would’ve burned when Draco backed me up against the sink and then he
What he’s saying makes sense, but still, the Bible clearly says —
.” She shuddered at the dark magic still lingering around the skin of the man’s forearm. “
. I know it’s not fair to throw this at you right now when you have so little time left. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to burden you with this. I know you’re in love with someone else, and I… I don’t expect anything from you, I know that you don’t feel the same way. I mean obviously you don’t because you’re so in love with this other person that you’re dying from it!”
“Well well, aren’t you the cunning Slytherin?” Harry said, folding the paper and setting it aside and uncrossing his legs. He noticed how Malfoy’s gaze followed the action, noticed his eyes widening at the sight of Harry’s erection. Harry smirked and got off the bed, walking up to Malfoy and standing so close that he could feel the hairs of Malfoy’s chest brushing his own, without touching his skin. “Now, do you want to show me you have some stamina? Will you be able to hold out longer than me?” he murmured, leaning close to Malfoy’s ear.
“Yes,
When Harry looked over at the bed, Draco was stirring, rubbing at his eyes. Harry dived under the covers once again, hoping that Neville wouldn’t come inside when Draco opened the door. Draco blinked his eyes open, they were soft and sleepy as he looked at Harry, and Harry forgot about his friend on the other side of the door. But then, the knocking started again, and Draco turned his head towards it, looking confused.
“You don’t have to comfort me, I’m fine,” Harry finally said.
“Morning, Dave.”
“It most certainly is not!” Draco says, affronted. “Though to be fair, it’s considered to be very old fashioned, so most families have found ways to lift the curse for the younger generations. Except for a few families. And, well, it seems that mine belongs to one of those few.”
“Wasn’t that the plan?”
There was a collective snickering all around the classroom, and beside Draco, Harry gave short surprised snort. Draco stared at the girl, who smiled back at him with an air of serenity. “I’m… sorry?” he stuttered, completely taken aback.
(which came as no surprise to Draco who was used to Harry not always being able to gauge how powerful he was).
“How could I forget?”
Harry Potter in southern Italy, and now I’m in the same starting group as well.”
Draco shakes his head, clearing his throat.
“I think I’m attracted to Malfoy.”
“Yeah I noticed,” Harry said hoarsely. “Do you, er—”
Something painful twinges in his chest, and if he had the courage right now, he’d dare to examine this closer, he’d acknowledge that he’s felt this pain on several other occasions. But he doesn’t want to look deeper, he wants to shut his eyes and cover his ears and concentrate on hoping with all he’s got that this is not what he suspects it is.
Harry thinks about it, thinks about how he knows exactly how they feel underneath his fingertips, the silky yet sturdy texture of them, knows with intimate detail how it feels to slide them down over Draco’s arse, letting the elastic catch on his erection. The sensation of ripping them off, with so much force that they almost crack at the seams. Having the fabric trapped between their cocks as they rut frantically together. And one glorious time, Draco allowed him to actually tear them off with his teeth, and Harry made sure to take it slow, to restrain himself so as not to ruin the garment that he appreciates so much, and when they finally came off, Draco was a trembling mess of need and Harry had never been prouder of himself for rendering Draco Malfoy speechless. The memory of it makes him smile.
Harry chuckled, feeling a bit embarrassed.
I’m not sure how though. Fuck, I wish someone else could do this for me.
“Sure, whatever,” Potter mumbled behind him, and Draco felt a little bit like a dick. It was just that Potter always managed to bring out the worst in him, and it didn’t help that Draco was still hurt and embarrassed about what had happened after Luna’s art opening two months ago.
“Well, the absolute cow at reception was
“Well, I know
“Would you like to do the honours?” Harry looks up at Draco’s words: his thumbs are hooked inside the elastic of his skimpy knickers. They’re barely covering his cock, half of it is peeking out, the glans already exposed and glistening with precome. He regards Harry from under his fringe in mock bashfulness. “Place them where you want them.”
He finally reaches their landing and, with trembling fingers and a pounding heart, he turns the door knob.
“And you will. You will, just— Be patient.”
Harry brandished his wand in a swift movement and Alex fell bonelessly to the floor.
room!”
“—to think about this clearly. We plan. We let the team back home know, and we tackle this in the morning the way Kingsley would want us to.”
And you shouldn’t do this. What you’re doing is a sin, an abomination against the Lord’s will, but his skin is so soft, his body so warm and firm and
“I just don’t want us to get confused.” Draco sounds like he has to gather a great amount of patience, like he’s explaining something extremely complicated to a five year old. “Spending the night is a slippery slope towards—”
“Do we have to? I mean, how do you explain going undercover on assignment and coming back like this?!” Harry laughed at Draco’s perplexed expression.
Harry looked at the white stockings Draco was wearing, and at the ribbons with pom pom tassels around the knees.
Slowly, Harry pushes his torso up from the bed with his elbows, his gaze locked with Draco’s as he edges closer. Draco’s hands are trembling when Harry lets his fingers rest upon them, an indication of how much Draco’s reining himself in to keep his composure. Harry slides the pads of his thumbs along the waistband, starting just to the side of Draco’s cock, slowly bringing them to his hips, and he has to bite back a smile as goosebumps appear on Draco’s skin. Draco removes his hands to let Harry take control, bringing them up to rake through Harry’s hair instead, his stomach barely moving with his suppressed breathing. Harry leans forward, slowly dragging his bottom lip along the curve of Draco’s pelvic bone, grunting a little as Draco’s grip on his hair tightens, Draco’s nails scraping his scalp. He does it again, but with his tongue this time, licking a slow path over Draco’s skin, dragging his pants down just a little bit with his thumb and bringing the rest of his fingers to rest on Draco’s arse. Draco hisses, yanking Harry’s hair a little roughly, but Harry finds the sting of it quite enjoyable and he opens his mouth wider to do it one more time, but this time, Draco uses the grip in his hair to push him away.
“I have to admit, Harry, I’m surprised you’ve managed to get your bedroom in order in such a short time,” Hermione said, beaming at him. “All in all it’s a really nice flat,” she added, looking around the living room, especially admiring the many plants scattered about on tiny rickety tables and hanging from the ceiling.
Harry’s never been good with break ups. Even if his first meaningful one, with Ginny, had been amicable enough once they realised they’d grown apart after the war, it had still been straining for him because of all the initial awkwardness. Not to mention all the thoughts about how he’d imagined they could have been, and mourning for what they’d had. And even if this thing with Draco can’t strictly count as a break up, since it wasn’t even a relationship to begin with, it still hurts, and as the days pass Harry realises that maybe he’s come to think of it as one.
“Look at you, Harry. So eager. So ready for me,” Draco says as he in quick succession adds a second and then a third finger.
And yet, as he clenches around you, your name a muffled groan behind his hand;
“Oh Draco,” he says when he’s finally all the way in, his voice thick with emotion and want. He slides a hand up along your back, then down again to your hip, holding on to you, caressing you. “Can I?”
He starts to tear up, but he presses it back and shrugs one shoulder. “Yeah. Or maybe it was just complicated, I’m not really sure.”
“I mean… I wouldn’t want to ruin your sweater now that you’ve so graciously lent it to me.”
You start cleaning his wounds, and you try not to notice how surprisingly smooth his skin is, how dark it looks compared to your almost translucent hand washing it. This pilgrim must’ve travelled far, judging by the looks of him with his unshaven face and tanned skin.
Draco swallows. He’s decidedly avoided thinking about how things will be once everyone else finds out about him being sick with love, how they’ll pity him for his weakness. But Potter’s words make these thoughts come nearer, clawing at him, demanding access to his mind. “I guess.”
“Correct. I remember Mother told me years ago, when I started seeing my first boyfriend. I waved it off as an attempt to try to scare me, but… I guess I’ve always had that thought in the back of my head and I’ve… taken measures to avoid it happening.”
“Yes, well, I’m terribly sorry but I’m afraid I’ve remembered I have places to be now,” Draco repeats, and he’s almost able to hide the way his voice trembles, but Harry hears, and he wants to make it better, but he feels rejected and shut out.
are not going anywhere. But
He cuts himself off as Draco’s cleaning charm washes over him, leaving a tingling sensation in its wake. It makes him lean back to look at Draco properly, makes him see that Draco has collected himself, even if his breathing is a little quicker and shallower, his mask of smug certainty is once again in place. He smiles crookedly at Harry.
Draco strokes his palms over Harry’s thighs, up to his arse, strangely tender, and Harry looks down at him because he loves to see Draco’s soft pink lips wrapped around his cock, sliding up, up, up.
Draco chuckles. “Patience, darling. We’ll get there.”
“You didn’t even think about it until Hermione mentioned it,” Harry muttered, slumping in his seat.
“Shut up, Ron, my arse is nice looking. And it’s not as if you haven’t seen it before, we shared a dorm for six years and slept in the same tent for months!” Harry snaps over his shoulder.
this, to happen again.
Nüwa had stopped listening to Potter’s rambling, she was now fully observing the other man, and suddenly, there it was. She was surprised she hadn’t noticed it before, but somewhere in the back of her mind she must’ve registered that every time Potter spoke to her, there was a tiny shift in the other man’s posture. Like he was…
“And I’m leaving my luggage here, since this is
I just walked into the kitchen and Draco was standing by the sink and I got this urge, so strong that it felt like being under the Imperius curse, to go up to him and put my arms around him and kiss him on the neck. But that must be because I’m a bit touch starved, right? I mean even before this quarantine I’ve been single for a while, because no one ever feels right for me. I need someone who will treat me like an equal, and not put me on a pedestal. I need someone to challenge me, kind of like Ginny did.
fight each other at school (and that got me thinking about how I used to think about Sirius, though I’ve never told her that).
You smile at him, bringing your arms around his neck. “I’m not hungry.”
“Er, hi. Can I… Can I come in?”
instead of this person that doesn’t want him back. But he knows that that’s something he’ll have to wonder about his whole life, what could’ve been, what he could’ve had, if only. So he forces himself to stay quiet.
“Thank you,” he said eventually. “I’ll let you know what I think of it.” Then he disappeared into the bathroom, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
Harry snorts. “Takes one to know one.” He ducks from Draco’s hand trying to slap him, and grabs Draco’s thighs to heave himself up so that their faces are level. “Now, do you want me to keep casually sucking you off, or would you be so kind as to casually put that gorgeous dick up my arse?”
“Suck.”
“If I remember correctly, you told me we were going to Sweden to study the way they traditionally celebrate summer solstice, for our research into solstice magic.”
“Oh, Professor Potter, I haven’t even
“I had to do enough to be believable. Are you okay? I promise I didn’t mean to see anything I saw, I tried to hold back, I did.” Harry still looked a little pale, “You were incredible back there, mimicking the effects of the implanted commands while still maintaining control. I’ve never seen anything like it.” Draco ran his fingers through unruly black hair, he wasn’t even sure why he was doing it. He just needed to comfort this man that had been his friend and had trusted him. He just hoped Harry wouldn’t hate him when this was all over. “Harry, are you okay?”
Draco’s eyes are shooting daggers at him. No, not daggers. Icicles. “Assuming there will be a next time.”
I started looking through my photographs today but I almost fell asleep just thinking about sorting through them. Anyway, this lockdown seems to be going on for quite some time so I’ll have the opportunity later.
Noticing Harry’s reverie, Draco’s eyes soften, his features smoothing out. He strokes Harry’s hair gently, his fingers catching on some of the strands, but it feels good, it’s grounding, and Harry leans into his touch as Draco’s hand travels down to cup his cheek.
“And they couldn’t do anything about it?”
“What?” Draco said, straightening up
It’s such a marvelous thing, coming inside that warm velvety softness of Draco’s mouth. Harry’s driven almost mad by how good it feels when his cock pulses its release while Draco’s still moving up and down the length of it, only slower now, allowing Harry to come down from his rush. Harry lets his head fall back, his hand in Draco’s hair relaxing, and Draco draws off. When Harry looks up again Draco’s wiping his lips with the back of his hand, and Harry scoots forward, leaning down to kiss him. He loves to taste himself on Draco, loves to know there’s some traces of him left. But this time, Draco turns away, his hand curled into a fist, covering his mouth.
“Mr. Malfoy?”
It’s the truth, isn’t it? He knows what’s wrong with me, he knows how it will end, and he just —” he gulps for air, and now everything smells sickeningly sweet, “ — he just told me we should end it, like it was… like it was nothing to him.”
“How do you stand it?”
“Professor Malfoy, this is highly unprofessional,” Harry had panted into Draco’s ear as he’d pressed himself closer, running his hands along Draco’s back.
Potter seemed to relax at the words, probably because Draco hadn’t told him to sod off. Yet. He shifted slightly. “Bit uncomfortable, isn’t it?”
briefing
I wonder if they’re getting back together. Maybe that’s the problem, maybe
You nod, holding his face between your hands.
“Well,” Draco said, thinking that answering one little innocent question that had nothing to do with his purpose today couldn’t hurt, “not as annoying as he was when we were in school together, but still quite irritating.”
“Well obviously it was hard to miss how your eyes lit up as soon as you saw him when you came in. I’m surprised no one else noticed,” Luna says in her airy but matter of fact kind of way. “But I guess most people aren’t very observant of their surroundings, they’re too focused on themselves.”
“You do?”
, but I can’t. I can’t change who I am. And I don’t want to.” You watch his throat work as he swallows. “I used to think I was a sinner, that I was weak, but I’m not Draco. And neither are you.”
, let it happen again.
I had to do an interview today. Fuck I hate being this person. I know that if I say something it’ll give people comfort, somehow. But I just want to be regular Harry, going about my business by myself, unnoticed, without the press or admirers hounding me.
Arms falling to her sides in disbelief, Pansy gives Ron an even wearier look. No, weary is the wrong expression, Harry thinks, her eyes are practically throwing an
“Oh no, my dear, I’m quite rational. Why do you think it took me so long to get you here? I had to be absolutely certain my methods were sound before I’d risk your safety. Besides, you can hardly claim not to see the appeal. After all, you signed up for our little program here with the ‘boy wonder’. You know what it’s like to set your eyes on someone who thinks they are too good for you, otherwise you would have gotten him without our help.” He smirked as if he’d won. “I do applaud the choice by the way. Unfortunately, I can’t let you have him. You,” he pointed at Draco, “Are for me, my darling.”
“Of course we’ll help you, Neville,” Draco said with his gentlest voice, the one he used to soothe students plagued with exam anxiety. “I’m sure Strutty’s fine, but we’ll join you as soon as we’re decent.”
“Have you been thinking about me today?” Draco says, cocking his head to the side, his smile turning wider, a predatory glint in his eyes. “Have you been thinking about what you want to do to me?” He pushes himself up from the back of the sofa, sliding to sit on the edge of it. “Tell me, Harry,” he murmurs into Harry’s ear, sliding his hands along Harry’s back to let them rest on his arse, pressing it to make Harry rise up so that his cock is level to the sofa. Squeezing lightly, Draco pushes himself closer to Harry, and when his crotch comes into sharp contact with Harry’s aching cock, Harry can’t help but gasp at the sensation, unbelievably turned on. Draco chuckles, a low and guttural sound deep in his throat. “So hard for me, aren’t you, Harry?”
“Why are you looking at me like that?”
“What the hell is this? Where to next, Potter?”
“Fiance? We were never engaged, AND I broke up with you five years ago for being a possessive, controlling, manipulative bastard!” Draco spat. “ Or are you so delusional you forgot about that?”
“(If anything
Draco is quiet, breathing measuredly, a flush creeping up on his neck. Harry bites his lip so hard he almost draws blood to suppress his giggles.
doesn’t deserve you, because if they did they’d be here, right? Who in their right mind could know you, know the real you, and
Draco looked up at Harry, but Harry quickly returned to his task of rinsing the strawberries, pretending he hadn’t seen anything. But he had. And he hadn’t missed the adorable way Draco had flushed after his blunder. Harry bit his lip to keep from smiling like the besotted fool he was.
“I didn’t
Harry looks around, startled. “Ginny! Hi! I was, er… I was on a date actually, sort of,” he says, scratching his neck. He’s not keen on opening up this particular can of worms by telling Ginny who this date was with.
Harry had planned what words to use when he told Ron and Hermione; he had gone through the different scenarios and reactions in his head, so he wasn’t that surprised when Hermione choked on the sip of tea she had just taken, her eyes watering with the effort of not coughing.
“Like you know anything about my sexual preferences, Malfoy.”
“I recognise the smell of these,” he says, deeply inhaling the scent from the jar of little yellow flowers standing in front of you.
Harry quivers at the way Pansy ominously returns her attention to him and Draco. She practically has a sign over her head saying “Done with this shit”, and part of Harry is impressed with both Ron and Draco for daring to take the piss out of her.
“(I think I’ll have to burn those clothes after this trip.) Well, that looks more tolerable.”
Suddenly that subtle stirring feeling inside Draco’s chest turns into a sharp stab of pain, like something sick is taking root, and he has to gasp. He clears his throat, putting a hand over his sternum, and the pain subsides to a dull ache, but still lingers ominously.
Draco gasps softly, and Harry regrets the words even before they leave his mouth, but he’s too angry, too stubborn to take them back, and he turns on the spot to Disapparate, vaguely registering Draco rubbing at his chest.
Draco let out a dry laugh and grabbed his hand with more force than necessary. “Oh, darling, why didn’t you say so earlier?”
Blaise’s smirk is instantly wiped off his face. “What? Why do I get to constantly walk in on them like… this?”
“What, now?” Harry says, nonplussed. “But I… I just —”
He chuckles. “Harry,” he says. “I told you my name is Harry.”
It takes Draco a few moments to draw enough air to say anything, to even be able to take control of his vocal chords. “I do believe that was one the rules we stated, yes,” he forces out.
“Informal? You mean I’m failing to follow the appropriate dress code for being recently out of the shower?”
“Mhm… Could you… could you show me the best way to do that as well? Just so I don’t screw up, of course.”
After the cleaning, you put St. John’s wort ointments and wrappings of lavender on the wounds. He flinches in pain, even though he’s still in a deep sleep, and you try to be even more gentle so as not to disturb him.
Harry moved, almost unconsciously, under his arm and he felt Draco tug him back. He looked back at his hand and at Draco, confused.
Harry looks up at him, sniffling. Even with his eyes red rimmed and his face blotchy he’s breathtakingly beautiful.
“I’ll make sure to prescribe you the potion to help your breathing and have them distribute it every four hours,” Healer Goodwin says softly, waving her wand at a parchment to her right. “I’ll leave the two of you alone for a while.”
can do about it.”
Kingsley chuckled softly.
Shit.
You look around you wildly, trying to see anything through the thick curtain of rain, and then you hear a faint “Draco” coming from a tiny gathering of bushes in front of you. You sprint through the undergrowth and crouch down beside him. He’s sitting on the ground, curled around himself, shivering. You run a hand through his damp hair and he looks at you with wide eyes.
Draco scoffed, refusing to admit to the lame joke. “It appears to be now.”
“Don’t
Harry turned around, meeting stormy grey eyes. His mouth suddenly felt very dry.
Harry notices with satisfaction how Draco tries but fails to suppress a shaky exhale, shivering under Harry'sf palm.
It was two weeks later and Draco was once again standing in the doorway to the bathroom, this time holding a bottle labelled “Draco’s shampoo.”
“But today I’m not going to bore you with the different herbs and spices in their dried state, it’s time to transfer the seedlings I planted in March into the garden,” you say, showing him the tiny green buds sticking up from the soil in the pots.
“Draco?” he says as he enters the living room.
“Yeah, I know, it came as a shock to me, too,” he said, which made Hermione spray her tea all over the table and collapse in a fit of laughter and coughing. Ron smacked her on the back repeatedly until she straightened up again and wiped the tears from her eyes.
I was planning on talking to Draco, but the opportunity just never showed. So. I guess there’s a new day tomorrow.
“Don’t worry,” Draco says with a wave of his hand. “I’ll just cast a
“Of course! Happy to oblige. Especially to spare my clothing.”
Harry shook his head. “It’s just… would you have believed, six months ago when you were livid about me leaving my “bodily residues” in the bathroom, that we would end up like this?”
“Draco, hi,” he heard Neville say breathlessly after Draco opened the door. “I’m sorry, were you sleeping?”
You feel sick to your stomach upon hearing his words. The tale is so familiar, so similar to what you and him have had together.
He tried to drag Harry back toward the direction they came in but his vision was dimming and suddenly the world faded to black.
. And it was so freeing to have someone I didn’t have to explain everything to. I mean sure, Ginny could understand well enough when we were together, but compared to Draco and I she was so protected during the war, she didn’t
“Thank you so much, Mr Malfoy, I do hope it will help. We barely get any sleep now what with the screams.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Right, so you can call me a hopeless plonker because today I almost set fire to the kitchen. It’s embarrassing, really, but I was baking and cooking at the same time, and of course I forgot to put on a timer for the cookies. I didn’t really notice the smell, or realise what it was, before it was too late. But it wasn't the cookies that caught on fire. No, I managed to put my oven mitt on the stove and
But, yeah, he’s my boyfriend now, we’re together, and I can’t honestly remember being this happy before. I keep laughing all the time, because like I said a month or so ago, he’s still a prick, but he’s a damn funny and adorable one. I’m honestly a little nervous about how things will work out between us when we get to move freely outside again, but I think it’ll be fine since we’ve known each other for so long. We’re trying to take things slow, but it’s hard (no pun intended) to have him around all the time and being able to do all the things I want to do with him. (Mostly kissing. Draco is a really good kisser, and every time we try to watch the telly we end up snogging on the sofa (and sometimes more
want Astoria. I just know that every time Draco talks about her, or with her, I get super irritated and want to change the subject so as not to be reminded about how awesome she is.
Harry bit back a smile, trying to ignore the warm feeling in his stomach at Draco’s words.
Draco swallows drily. He wants to stand up and run away from here, cover his ears and scream at the top of his lungs, but he needs answers.
“Is it?” Draco says, even though he’s fully aware of it. It feels strange but nice to call Harry by his first name, rounder and softer than the “Potter” he usually still spits out like it’s a kernel or seed he wants to get rid of. “Well I guess it’s never too late to try new things.”
He regards you for a long time, making you squirm in discomfort. “I think I know now why you reacted that way,” he says eventually, and then continues walking, not saying anything more than that.
You’re out in the garden, pretending to weed the crops, but really you’re staring unseeing before you, letting your hands work of their own will. You’re trying to find comfort in the feel of the earth against your skin, the softness of the plants you’re pulling up, like you used to before all of this. It will be better with time, you tell yourself. You just need to let the passing of time take care of your hurt and your guilt and your loss.
“Yes? Why wouldn’t it be?”
The hour was late, but the May air was still warm as Draco stood outside the club to take a breather. He’d really meant to only stay for a bit at Luna’s vernissage, to support Pansy who was nervous about being introduced as Luna’s girlfriend, but had ended up staying late enough to tag along to the after party. All the free wine at the art gallery had made Draco pleasantly tipsy and now he was feeling nostalgic as he watched his best friend through the window, dancing with her girlfriend. Pansy and Luna were a couple who, if you were just presented with the idea of them, seemed ludicrous, but seeing them together, they just… made sense. He’d never seen Pansy so comfortable around anyone, and it made his chest warm at the thought. He smiled to himself, then glanced to his right when he noticed someone moving towards him.
“What the fuck!” Harry shouted once back in the confines of their room. “Obedience training through bond legilimency? Are you kidding me?”
Draco nods and starts by trying to get his arm out, but when he shifts it only makes Harry latch on tighter to him, and he looks up at Goodwin with fond exasperation. Normally he’d be embarrassed to have this intimate moment play out in front of another person, who he doesn’t even know that well, but he finds it hard to care when he’s so thoroughly pleased.
You almost run into a thick tree branch, and you duck to avoid it, but it makes you lose your balance. With a yell you fling your arm out to stay upright, drop the torch in the motion, and watch as it flies in a wide arch, landing with a faint sizzling sound in a puddle.
“I think you’re a bit too comfortable,” Draco says, trying to push Potter away, but he only snorts and clings to Draco even harder, leeching on and absolutely refusing to let go. Draco tries again, and when that fails he digs his fingers in between Potter’s ribs, which only makes him tickle Draco back, and suddenly they’re wrestling. Draco can’t decide if it’s all play or if they’re seriously fighting, it’s hard to tell with the both of them, it’s like they’re falling back into comfortable patterns of constantly trying to one up each other. But both of them are laughing, even more so when Potter almost falls out of bed.
Harry shakes his head, snapping out of it. “No. No, I know you need your distance. I was just…”
You don’t answer, you’re too occupied remembering how to breathe, how to not collapse in a heap on the ground.
The silence was deafening as every eye turned towards Draco. He tried to smile in a friendly way, but it felt like he was only pulling up the corners of his mouth into a grimace. He shouldn’t be this nervous. He was used to people judging him for how he had acted during the war, and Harry had promised the students wouldn’t give him a hard time, but even so, he was petrified.
Draco pulled away, turning around to trap the warm, familiar sensations that had sparked in his chest before they caught fire and spread lower. “A couple in love,” Draco managed to get out. “A couple who can’t keep their hands off each other.”
Harry flops down, the sheets cool against his back. Draco positions himself between his legs, silently studying him, like he’s planning exactly how to take him apart, and Harry can’t wait. Draco reaches his arms out, his fingers grazing the sides of Harry’s arse cheeks, feather light and almost tickling. Then, he trails them along the back of Harry’s thighs, resting them on the backs of his knees, pressing his index and middle fingers up in a silent command. Breath held, Harry obliges, lifting his knees to hook either hand under them, spreading himself open under Draco’s approving gaze, waiting, wanting. But nothing happens, and Harry’s is just about to tell Draco to get on with it when there's that same light touch along the curve of his calves, down to his heels and back up. He looks at Draco and is surprised at the smile he gets.
He sighed, scrubbing at his forehead. Potter must’ve figured it out by now. Famously oblivious though he was, he must’ve realised what it meant that Draco ran away from the party after Pansy’s
“Do forgive me, Pansy, love, but speaking of skincare, I realise I need to go powder my nose.”
“Yeah, well your body wasn’t attached to Malfoy’s body at the time, and I’d like to avoid seeing
“Then do the second, and get ready.” No point in being quiet anymore, Draco thought.
“I’m in one Slytherin now,” Harry says, laughing when Draco kicks him in the shin again.
Then Draco finally pulls away and pushes Harry down onto his bed, and when Harry looks up at him, his breath leaves him in a rush at the sight. Draco’s eyes are a stormy grey, there’s no mistaking his arousal, his want for Harry.
Malfoy’s angry demeanor, flushed cheeks and shooting-daggers-eyes changed immediately upon seeing Ron and Hermione there. He looked like a balloon that had suddenly deflated.
Harry swallowed, but shrugged in an attempt at casualness. “I couldn’t find my own, and yours smelled really nice.” He firmly closed his mouth to stop himself from adding that he’d thought it smelled like Draco and that he quite liked that.
The next day it becomes obviously clear: Harry’s avoiding you. He averts his eyes when you get to the church for Matins, and when you try to stand next to him, he turns his head, softly asking Brother Lucas beside him if they can switch places. Your heart sinks at his words, but you know you’ve deserved it. You don’t know what to do to earn his trust again.
“Is this seat taken?”
I’m thinking about learning to play the guitar instead, I’ve always wanted to know how to do that. Maybe it’ll help me attract girls once we’re out of this mess. I mean, sure, I have girls trailing after me all the time, but it’s getting old that they just want to get into my pants because of the whole Defeated the Dark Lord seven years ago. It’d be a nice change if they wanted to get into my pants for my awesome guitar playing skills.
Draco gasps and makes a whining noise, pushing himself as far in as he can go, and then Harry feels it, feels the pulsating twitching of Draco’s cock deep inside him, feels every vibration along his length. The sensation is entirely new to him, because he knows what an ejaculation feels like in his hand, or on his skin, or between his buttocks, but it’s so much more intense to feel it
Draco XX”
And that’s it. They hug each other, and as he waves goodbye he thinks that it might take him some time to get over all of this with Draco, but that he needs to learn a way to cope with it. The worst part is really not knowing what even went on with the two of them. Maybe he should just talk to Ron and Hermione about it? Maybe he shouldn’t try to go through this alone, but take help from those closest to him. He’s tired of keeping them in the dark anyway.
“Harry,” you say, and something stirs inside you. It feels familiar, like coming home, like breathing. “Harry.”
“Harry! Are you—” Then Draco began to feel it too, slightly dizzy and his vision blurred. Harry slumped to the floor and Draco kneeled to hold him, “Harry! Harry! Wake up!”
You don’t have time to say anything before you both start running. You’re following Harry blindly, tripping and almost falling on gnarled roots, your aching legs begging for relief, until you reach the Hermit’s hut.
spell and then the flames got bigger and began to spread and I guess I must’ve screamed or something, I can’t remember, but suddenly Draco was there. And I know he still has a problem with fire, but luckily, he managed to keep his cool (which is so impressive, I don’t know how he did that) and he put it out.
He lifts his head, and the sight that meets him when he looks into the mirror is nothing short of a nightmare. There are large dark circles under his eyes, blood trickles from his lips and his skin seems grey and washed out. He looks a fright. Worse than in sixth year, and that was really a low point in his appearance as well as life in general.
“Well, I guess I keep forgetting since the house elves always took care of that at the Manor. And at Hogwarts as well,” Malfoy said with a shrug.
Draco exhales shakily, his bottom lip disappearing between his teeth. “You’re still sure then?”
“Sto...uhhh. Harry, stop.”
You can’t help but chuckle, even though you know he must be hallucinating from the fatigue.
So, it’s been a few days since I wrote. I’ve been… busy, sort of. I can hardly write this without grinning like a loon, but I’ll try to describe it from the beginning.
Afterwards, you’re lying tangled together on the bed, your hand in Harry’s hair, letting the strands fall between your fingers. Harry has at some point managed to get up to put more wood to the fire and fetch a blanket to pull over you, and now he’s fallen asleep with his head on your arm, his heartbeat against your ribs, his even breaths grounding you.
Ron was now spluttering, frantically looking around the room for any sort of help from someone, and that was enough for the truth to register in Harry’s brain.
, and everyone loved her insight and knowledge on how to best reach your goals. They praised her ability to encourage you to push your body to its limits and beyond, with mental training as well as physical. She had the best record of all the running coaches available in Britain, and that was saying something. But this? Having to endure the sight of two rivals who were behaving like this was some sort of elaborate, aggressive, extended foreplay? She didn’t know how much more she could take of this idiocy.
“Okay,
“I’m sure you know why I wanted to see you, Brother Draco,” he says, folding his hands carefully in his lap.
“Draco? Draco! What’s going on? Are you alright in there?”
“Yes, well, it was bound to happen some time.”
anything.”
“Of course we’re fucking having this conversation now! Or do you have another suggestion for passing the time?” Harry says irritably. He draws a few calming breaths before continuing. “Why didn’t you tell me it was your first time?”
“Draco,” he whispers. “Draco, don’t make me wait any longer.”
As if he needed more signs, more blunt messages about him and Potter.
“It’s what it says on the label,” Harry said, scratching his neck. “Shampoo for you.”
“I think you still have that wound on my hip to look after,” he says instead, and you realise you’ve been idling in your task because you were too busy staring at him.
“Wait, what happened —?” he begins, looking up to see what remains of them lying on the bed beside them.
“Did you get that aroused just by thinking of me?”
The rest of the day we just hung around and watched Muggle telly (thank goodness we have Muggle telly!) and goofed around. Nothing out of the ordinary.
There were a couple of awkward rounds. Finnigan made Granger kiss Ginny, and Weasley was forced to tell them about the time between third and fourth year when he walked in on his parents shagging in the garden shed. Apparently, he still had trouble raking leaves because of the memories.
“Yeah, well, I’m not too chuffed either.”
As they went through the half lift, the chaturanga and the upward dog, Harry made sure to do every movement as precisely and deliberately  as he could, focusing on stretching his body, breathing loudly with small grunts, and was very pleased that his choice of clothing showed his muscles off. He was also pleased to hear that Malfoy seemed to have trouble with his breathing.
“I’m so sorry, I hope I’m not intruding!” Ginny said, to everyone’s protests that she was more than welcome. “I managed to take a break from Quidditch training camp and I really wanted to hang out with you guys!”
Harry shook his head and smiled sweetly. “No, no, not at all!” he said, and was pleased to see that this seemed to throw Malfoy off a bit.
“Would you rather have had me accept her offer?” you say, tilting your head.
The fire is already crackling merrily, and Harry is standing in front of it, dragging his tunic over his head and hanging it up on the only available chair in the room. You forget how to breathe. You’ve never seen anything as beautiful as Harry’s body, golden as it’s illuminated by the dancing flames, naked except for the stockings and shoes, which he quickly strips off as well, and your hands remember the sensation of having his skin under your fingertips, how warm and welcoming it felt, and how you never wanted to let him go.
Draco doesn’t answer, but his jaw is working silently as he’s staring at Harry, and it looks like he’s reluctantly admitting defeat. Tentatively, Harry starts to nose around Draco’s groin, inhaling the scent of him and kissing the tender skin on the inside of his thighs.
“What —”
Draco stares at her, fury pumping through him. Her cheeks are flushed and her eyes are brimming with tears, and she’s actually panting.
Malfoy leaned back, looking Harry up and down with a smirk that seemed more assessing now, more on guard.
He studies you for a while, regarding you silently. Once again you get the feeling that he can see straight through you, uncover all your secrets. “Not even if you left the monastery?”
“You know, I’ve been thinking on it,” Draco said, hands pressing upwards and out against his face in thought, “and maybe we need to look at this from a different perspective.”
“Shocking, I know.”
I told him I was so grateful he’s always around to help me, and he said “You know I’d do anything for you, don’t you Harry?” He sounded so sincere, but also nervous, so I sort of got up on one arm
But it’s nice that he can hang out with his ex like that, kind of like I can with Ginny. It seems like Draco and Astoria have had more interaction during this lockdown than me and Ginny though. Probably because Astoria lives alone and Ginny lives with Luna, but still.
Harry didn’t answer, he was too busy trying to hide the way his cock had swelled while witnessing Malfoy’s little show. What the fuck was wrong with him?
“Yes, well, the feeling is mutual, you sentimental old man,” he said, laughing at Harry’s indignant squeak.
Draco shook himself out of Harry’s grip. “What?”
You nod, closing your eyes.
“Nothing about this is straight.”
“Isn’t it? It’s what you usually do to me when you want help with figuring out potions… hrm, never mind, just go and get this fixed.”
“Look at you, Harry, look at you taking me this way.”
“So here is the mugworth foot ointment for your husband, Mrs Baxter. I do apologise for the pungent smell, I’m afraid it’s unavoidable, but if you wrap his feet in cloth it should lessen the foulness a bit.” You smile at the woman in front of you, ignoring how one of her six children is kicking you in the shin. “And here is dried rosemary to put under his pillow to ward off nightmares,” you continue, handing over the tiny bag of dried leaves.
“Draco…” he repeats, sounding like he’s tasting your name, and you find you quite like it in his mouth. “A dragon, then. Not an angel.”
Potter bends forwards and starts shaking, and it takes a while for Draco to realise that it’s because he’s sobbing. In an unfamiliar effort to console Potter, Draco slides his free hand through his hair, raking through the curls, scraping his nails against Potter’s scalp. And he finds that it doesn’t matter, that he’s not angry anymore, not disappointed anymore. Even if Potter doesn’t want him in that way, at least he’s not unaffected by Draco dying. It’s a weird sort of comfort.
“What, Harry? What do you want?”
you’d have someone fuck you before, and that you just wanted to wait before I did it because… well because you—”
“Yes, ‘oh’. I’ll have to find another kind of shampoo to replace that one. One that’ll make my hair shiny and soft and not look like a bird decided to live there.”
we have to… share.”
“There’s a difference between what Draco wants and what he pretends he wants,” Luna says, smiling like she thinks he’s being adorably stupid. “But please make sure you don’t wait too long. I think he needs to hear it.”
It was nearing midnight and they were out in a field, surrounded by trees. Despite the late hour and the fact that the sun had set an hour ago, it was still rather light, but there was a chill in the air. Harry noticed Draco shivering a bit, since he had long ago changed into his Muggle linen trousers and cotton shirt (with regular sleeves).
Draco looks up at Harry extending his hand towards him. He’s smiling, but it’s a bit shaky around the corners, and when Draco looks more closely he notices that Harry’s hand is trembling. And he realises that Harry’s afraid too. But he’s asking Draco to take the leap with him, into unknown territory. Together.
But a few weeks later, he gets slowly but steadily worse. Every morning he wakes up with a new itching in his chest and an overwhelming need to cough. It’s like that first flower was an early sign, and now the rest of the plants have bloomed in silence inside him.
“Maybe it’d look… I don’t know, a bit messier. Like… someone roughed you up,” Harry mumbled, pretending to read his book to avoid looking at Draco and his piercing gaze. “I just… I like your hair a little messier,” he added quietly, as he shrank into his book, unable to help himself. He dearly hoped that Draco hadn’t heard that last part.
And the only thing they all have in common is how they’re always stained with blood.
Harry felt his cheeks grow hot. He had to remind himself that this was just a show, and Draco was a little too good at acting.
Potter blinked (even if she’d live to be a hundred years she would never get over how weird the motion looked with only one set of eyelids). “
“I know,” Harry said, untangling Draco’s arms from his sleeves before he started working on his own shirt. “I didn’t want to scare you, but I had to play the part.”
“Only by two months!” Draco said, folding his arms across his chest and giving Harry the infamous Malfoy arched brow, feeling like he could breathe freely again. He knew Harry was only indulging him with the banter, but he was grateful for it.
“Get a grip, Malfoy, it’s a cruise ship, this
, Draco.”
“Honestly. I paid a fair amount for this trip, and now I have to share a room with the man with the biggest head in Britain.”
“Am I wrong to guess that you gave away remedies for free again?” he murmurs, letting his lips slide against your neck the way he knows you love.
Draco’s eyes snapped to him. “My… what?”
“Because you volunteer to sleep out on deck?”
Harry laughs again, and Draco doesn’t mind so much that the flowers are expanding inside his chest because of Harry’s presence, if it means he’ll perish faster he’ll accept it, just to be with Harry like this, making him laugh like this.
Finally, after a month of hiding from the world, Pansy unceremoniously shows up at his workplace and orders him to come over for tea, and now he’s sitting in her living room, stiff as a board, absentmindedly curling his hand into a fist and then opening it up again. His joints have started to feel less flexible lately and from what he’s gathered it’s because roots are spreading through his veins. It’s annoying how they hinder his movements, which makes him even less successful in casting spells since he can’t perform the correct wand gestures. As much as he detests it, he’s had to do some research, mostly to try and find some alleviation, but he’s also been morbidly curious about what’s to come. That was, of course, until he found out what really
“Well, I guess I’ll be sleeping on the couch now,” Draco said when the initial excitement had died down, and even he could hear the resentment in his voice.
Harry blinks up at her, his eyes foggy with sleep and he looks disoriented. Draco needs to restrain himself from kissing the adorable fool. “Wha? W’s going on?”
Mouth dry, Draco stared at the empty bottle of firewhisky pointing at him ominously. He looked up at Pansy who was regarding him deliberately, her eyes darting ever so quickly to Potter, and Draco realised that this was what she had conspired for with the other girls. For some godforsaken reason she’d probably planned for him to take Dare so she could force him to do something embarrassing in front of Potter and the rest. He had to avoid that.
Harry leans forward, trying to read upside down. “The Hanahaki Disease?” He’s never heard of it before, but Hermione nods sagely at him, starting to read aloud from the book.
“What?! This is unacceptable, I thought this was a
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed how Draco’s shoulders, which had been tense while he pretended not to listen to them, dropped the tiniest bit at Harry’s words. But of course, Draco could never admit when he was behaving like a prick, let alone stop doing it, and soon he started scratching below his knees.
“Are you taking the piss?”
Draco can’t sleep. It’s somewhere around midnight, and he’s thoroughly exhausted from the extended time without oxygen and nutrition, and yet his mind feels clear and bright. Perhaps having escaped the claws of death does things to you, he thinks as he flexes his fingers slowly, just because he’s able to. You start to appreciate how easy it is to breathe suddenly, how the blood flows unhindered through your veins, how light your body feels.
You smile again, careful not to make it into a grin at the thought of it being a punishment, having Harry as your only company. “Yes, well, one could say we’re helping each other stay away from the temptation of women, when it gets too overwhelming.”
Harry nods, and Draco mirrors his motion, eagerly but cautious.
The wizard at reception smiled brightly, not looking the slightest bit annoyed. Harry straightened up, feeling flustered. He wasn’t comfortable with this kind of public display of affection, especially now as he was supposed to pretend to be something he already was. Draco, however, ever the air of know-how and confidence, took out a sheet of paper with their booking confirmation, but still kept his arm around Harry’s waist.
The first time I took it in my mouth I got a little too eager and I gagged a little, but I noticed that if I did it with a little more patience I could fit more and more of him inside me. But it was hard to go slow, because Draco kept making all these amazing sounds, and I wanted to go faster to make him sound like that even more, because
A few days ago he had a massive attack in front of Potter, and he’s been feeling exceedingly ill ever since, frail and decrepit. His vision is starting to get blurry, and at the same time he’s sensitive to bright light: it’s hurting his eyes, feels like it’s burning into his brain, leaving gaping holes with burned edges. He’s not been able to go to work, instead he’s been cooped up at home with the curtains drawn, trying to remember how it felt to breathe normally.
“ … “
“Did you mean it? What you told Alex?”
“Thank you.”
“Did you… did you hurt yourself?” he asks in a low voice, his breath sending shivers down your spine, and you can’t help but let out a gasp at the sensation of his chest pressed against your back.
“I don’t know what that feels like, to have someone like that, but I think… I think it’s something to hold on to.”
“I checked, but they said it’s impossible to use that kind of magic in this confined space when there are so many other magic folk aboard. And a stretching charm won’t work either.”
“The what?” they all say in unison.
“It was. So if I’m not mistaken we’re about to consummate it now.” He looked up at Harry, his eyes guarded. “This would be your chance to back out.”
It’s probably a sign of how weak Draco is at this point, but he motions for Pansy and Healer Goodwin to leave, which they do. But even if Pansy is leaving quietly, it doesn’t keep her from giving Potter the filthiest glare Draco has ever seen her use. It’s impressive Potter doesn’t crumble to the floor right then, but then he did defeat the Dark Lord after all.
“Yes,
If he could, he would cry right now, but apparently the plants inside him are using the tears as nutrition, so nothing comes out, and there’s an increasing pressure around his lungs, the stems thickening and squeezing hard. His vision starts to go blurry, there’s a high pitched sound in his ears almost blocking out Pansy’s panicked voice calling his name, until suddenly, everything goes eerily quiet as he realises that this will be over soon.
I was shaking so much, and I could barely look at him while I spoke to him (I’m also surprised he even heard what I was saying because I was talking super fast and super quiet). But when I finally did look at him, his cheeks had gone pink (shit I love it when he goes pink, he looks so adorable) and he kept staring at the table. But then he looked up at me, and he smiled so brightly, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him smile like that ever the entire time I’ve known him. And he was sort of biting his lip a bit and he came up to me and he whispered that he’s in love with me too. And then he kissed me. Or rather, he leaned in, and we were both so giddy that we started giggling, so we kind of paused, but then he put a hand on my chest and angled his head and I swear I almost fainted, I’ve never wanted to kiss anyone so badly.
task of taking out the bins the other day.”
Taking a knife and a cutting board, Potter started showing Draco, but it was difficult concentrating on that stupid vegetable with the warmth of Potter’s body so close, his scent filling Draco’s nostrils. The memories of that night, the ones he’d fought so much to block out of his head, started resurfacing.
~~~~~~~~~~~
He knows what he has to do. Draco won’t do it apparently, so it’s up to him. It’s only fair to both of them to end this, but mostly to himself, his own heart. Because how can he keep trying to make Draco want more than what they have when he’s in love with someone else? Harry’s always been so good at protecting others, but this time he needs to protect himself.
He’s surprised to hear a knock on his door, and even more surprised to find Potter on his doorstep. Draco blinks at him, the roots around his heart swelling, constricting.
“Oh,” said Hermione softly in his ear, making him realise how close she was. “I remember these! Never had one myself but I sometimes played on my friend’s.”
Harry didn’t need to be told twice and he shoved Draco unceremoniously onto the bed, draping himself over him, kissing and nipping everywhere he could. Sparks of pleasure rippled through Harry’s entire body as he mapped out every inch of Draco, opening him slowly with his fingers and tongue. He could feel Draco’s arousal reverberating inside himself, heightening his senses. It was like the last time they had sex, only a million times better.
“Aaaaahhh,” Malfoy sighed while Harry tried his best not to look at his dick. “Whoever said there’s nothing better than sex has clearly never needed to pee that badly.”
“I know.” Harry breathed, and Draco squatted down to look at him once more.
this material?!”
, thank you, Mr Malfoy! But… I only have payment for the foot ointment and the rosemary,” she says, indicating the bread and cabbages on the table beside you.
“Because you look so bloody hot in them. The way they hug your hips and the way they show off your arse. And when you get hard your cock peeks out of them.” He leaves open mouthed kisses along Draco’s jaw and throat while sliding his hands in under the elastic of the top. “And the way they make you look like an innocent angel and a complete slut at the same time makes me want to rip them off you and do filthy things with you,” Harry growls into his ear, and Draco moans, grabbing Harry’s head to bring their mouths together in a sloppy kiss, their tongues sliding together.
Harry growled into his neck. “Stop me now if you don’t want this, otherwise I’m going to absolutely obliterate you tonight. I want you so badly.”
“Draco. I… Well obviously I’m into you as well. I mean, I’m an Auror and I
, the thrum of their magic twisting and turning, filling the room with crackling energy, until Draco came with a shout, his arse clenching around Harry’s cock, pulling him over the edge too.
“Oh. Forgive me,” he mumbles, “my eyesight isn’t good, and I lost my glasses.”
“Ew, who in their right mind would ever want to do anything like that with Malfoy?” Ron said with a shudder.
There was a rustling and bustling as over twenty students chattered away, whispering to each other and casting not-so-subtle glances at Draco, neither of them paying any attention to their professor who stood in front of his desk.
“Sorry, but I know that you and Harry have been fornicating plenty without being married.”
“I think you’ll need to talk to Pansy though, she almost had a nervous breakdown before I managed to get Ginny and Hermione to confess that they’ve been conspiring all week to try and get us together.”
voice made Harry wince as he sat cross-legged in his favourite squishy armchair. A belly full of birthday cake and the comfort of  his friends surrounding him made Harry sleepy; but as he watched them all scramble to get seated as close to him as possible, a warmth rose in his chest. Ron had, of course, already sat down on the sofa closest to Harry before he made the announcement, but at Harry’s single raised eyebrow he shrugged with a crooked grin.
“I think we are,” Draco says, giddiness making his voice lighter, more high pitched than usual. He turns his head and his free shoulder to be able to kiss Harry properly, but after a moment he grimaces and turns back. “Ugh, I’m getting a stiff neck.”
“Yeah,” Draco breathed, “I’m fine, I…”
They both turned to Hermione again, who had managed to compose herself, even if she was still letting out the occasional giggle.
You pull him closer again, taking it slower this time when you kiss him. He sighs, melting into you, and you start backing towards the bed, pulling him with you.
“What do you mean, ‘
think that it was something more than just friendly touching. I mean I know he’s straight. And I know he’s probably going to get back with Astoria once we’re clear to go outside freely again.
“We’re going dancing, you want to come with?”
“Thank you, Mrs Baxter, that is awfully thoughtful of you, but I’m afraid I took an oath to never be physical with a woman when I chose the path of light, and I’m honouring that oath still.”
“Yes. That.”
I have to talk to him. Which should go pretty well, I mean I
“Draco…”
“There’s not much to tell,” he says while you decide to examine the gash across his hip bone. “My parents passed when I was a year old, and I was raised by my aunt and her husband. They… they didn’t approve of… well anything about me.”
“Shut up and kiss me.”
“What are you doing here, Potter?” Draco says, because he’s not entirely sure he wants Potter here now, seeing him like this. “We’re not—”
“Fuck, Draco, I’m—” Harry says, tugging Draco’s hair again to to keep him in place while still giving him a moment’s warning, even though he knows Draco enjoys having him come in his mouth.
“Nevermind,” Harry sighed, “just stop insulting my intelligence with that nonsense about my arse.”
Harry swallowed, because his throat suddenly felt extremely dry. “What— What is it that you want?”
“Well, consider it an early birthday present from me to you. Did you record it? Or are you going to show everyone later in a Pensieve?”
“We are, but only under very specific circumstances. Firstly, it must be believed that the anticipated benefits would outweigh the risk of having the patient’s mind penetrated in that fashion.” Oh dear Merlin, he’d said “penetrated” in front of all the students, why had he used that word? Nevermind, he couldn’t undo it, and if he gave them any sign he knew its indecent second meaning, things would be even more awkward. He had to power through this. “Secondly, there has to be a third party present to ensure that the therapist only accesses the memories relevant to the patient’s healing. It is also fiercely debated whether this kind of treatment is actually helpful for patients who are so traumatised that their minds are trying to protect them by locking away these memories.”
“I can’t believe you asked if he was taking the piss.” Harry’s giggles developed into full-blown laughter. Draco’s lips twitched and eventually, he was laughing as well.
“Um, yeah. Sure, I’ll… I’ll do that.”
He hiked up his trousers to his  knees and waded to his left, out to a little lonely rock situated in the water. It wasn’t comfortable, but he’d always been skilled at cushioning charms, and he could still have his feet down to feel the water, while looking out over the waves. He could pretend that he was all alone in the world. Pretend that he hadn’t just made a fool out of himself in front of everyone.
“No, Draco says, his voice sounding odd and he clears his throat again. “No, I must’ve— There must be something caught in my throat.”
“Well, you know me, I’m pretty spontaneous.”
Draco preens, snuggling in closer, and then Harry feels it: the pants are gone.
Harry felt like he was watching a ping pong match, his mind reeling at all this information. Draco’d had a crush on him at Hogwarts? And now he was in
“Wouldn’t dream of it. I’d hate to find anything embarrassing like handcuffs or a whip.”
Harry looks sheepish, but remains clutched to Draco, and Goodwin adds, in a much gentler voice, “It’ll only take a few minutes.”
Harry’s stomach drops out and he stares at her. “What?” he whispers.
Walking through the pristine white walls of the hotel had given them a sense of stability. Had they not been chasing down a possible murder suspect, having the exact same set up underground would have normally given the same vibe. But the longer the two of them walked, expecting the end every second—given they were going down an incredibly long hallway—the more unnerving it got.
“But it’s only because I know you’ll never bugger off if I don’t.”
Shit, I’m so nervous. I can’t do it today because I sent an order out by owl for home delivery. But tomorrow maybe.
Harry pointed at the door. “Because the people are actually inside! Actually doing things!”
The wood creaks as your feet hit the porch. It’s miniscule, clearly built for one person to fit under the leaking roof, and Harry presses close to you as you try the handle, and to your relief, the door opens to a small cabin. There’s nothing more than one room, but at least you’ll be dry and safe from the lightning. You step inside, Harry closing the door behind you, the sound of the rain subsiding into a gentle tapping through the ceiling.
“How so?” asked Hermione, who was perched on the kitchen counter and looking through her work notes.
Maybe he’s upset with me? I bet he wishes he could escape this flat to go see Astoria in person or something (I mean more than what he’s obviously seeing of her when he gets outside to spend his free hour), because I can’t think what I did to make him upset with me. Or maybe he thinks (realised) that my snippy remark about her is because I might be interested in her as well?
“Keep it,” Harry says, “for putting up with me and my laziness.”
“And you tried flirting with her?”
At this point, she’d rather go back to her crowded terrarium and listen to old Medusa wax poetic about her life in Mozambique before she was captured (always pretending to forget that if she’d stayed away from being caught, neither of them would be in this mess to begin with).
“Hi,” a voice said, and Draco’s heart leapt to his throat, hammering so wildly it felt like it was trying to get out.
“Right,” he says through clenched teeth. “Well thanks for cheering me up then.”
This will all be over soon.
“Oh, sorry!” Ebba said, laughing. “I forgot to mention you need to keep one hand on top of it. And not go too quickly.”
“Don’t fucking tell me how to grieve, you fucking
Harry moaned and grabbed Draco’s hips, flipping them swiftly surprising Draco into a squeak again. Harry climbed up to straddle Draco’s face and tangle one hand in his hair; the other braced against the headboard.
Draco just nods dumbly, while Potter leans in to kiss him again, softly. Then he flashes Draco another one of those bright smiles as he turns and walks through the door.
to look at him, and suddenly I got this
“Can you tell me about yourself, Draco?” he asks, startling you from your examination of the cuts on his shoulder.
“Sorry,” he said, trying his best to focus on her, which was hard since he thought he saw Draco going pink, a thing he loved to watch. He cleared his throat. “Sorry, I think I was somewhere else.”
“Draco...I feel…”
“What?” The word leaves you as barely more than a whisper.
and it would’ve felt just as good. I don’t know how else to explain it, I just know that it felt better than when Hermione has done the same spells on me, and everyone knows how great she is with her spellwork. But when Draco stroked my hand I swear I felt the burn subside even more.
“Definitely! If you’re okay with it?”
“The two of you… you had something. Something special,” Matthew continues, tentatively. “And I don’t care — I mean I will not judge you if you did… something you shouldn’t have, but regardless, I… I could feel you were connected. Deeply. On a spiritual level.”
“I’m acting like a man under a love potion, inhibitions and protestations suppressed and replaced with the need to please.”
“I’m still your friend, aren’t I?” Potter says quickly, his eyes flitting briefly to Pansy, unsure.
“I mean he’ll do anything to save someone’s life, including yours. Just,” she gesticulates with her hand, “tell him he needs to confess his love for you and you’ll be rid of this.”
“Not at all! Although I would say it is highly unusual for a pilgrim to enjoy his stay here for as long as he has,” he says, his lip curling in distaste. “I am more displeased with the reports I’ve been getting that your alliance has taken a rather inappropriate turn.”
“You shouldn’t even feel guilty about what we’ve done! If you feel guilty it should be because you made a promise of chastity, not because you love — I mean not because you want to…” he says, his voice breaking at the end and he looks away, clenching his teeth.
You nod again, too focused on the irresistible pleasure filling your entire body to be able to speak.
“At least the company was good,” Potter murmured, and now he was coming nearer, his breath ghosting over Draco’s cheek.
“So, Harry,” you say to distract yourself from how badly you want to stroke your fingers against him, “what made you decide to go on a pilgrimage then?”
“I guess not.”
“I don’t need them. I wasn’t talking about how you look, Draco, I was talking about
come back to haunt you. Better?”
“Are the two of you quite done philosophising over the English language? We do have a situation here.”
Harry felt his cheeks heating, fully aware that this was not something you were supposed to say to your strictly professional partner slash friend. He cleared his throat, and he tried to look completely unaware of what he’d said as he met Draco’s gaze. “What?”
Harry at least had the grace to look a bit sheepish as he shuffled over to them. Apparently, he’d won a marathon the previous year, but Sheila had never heard of either him or that particular marathon. And apparently, Blondie (Drogo?) was going to compete against him this year, and was obviously doing everything in his power to rile Harry up. Sheila had gathered that they knew each other when they went to school, and that they’d been at each other’s throats back then as well. She’d never heard of the school either, but from what Harry had told her, it sounded like it was some sort of boarding school somewhere in Scotland.
You both start tugging at each other’s clothes, discarding them as you move to the little bed. When you both collapse on it, you have the entire expanse of Harry’s naked body in front of you, more beautiful than you remember it from your previous visit here. You reach out, sliding your hand from his clavicle, over his sternum and down to his stomach, and you can’t stop your hand from playing with those hairs, running your fingers through them, scraping your nails lightly against his skin. Harry hisses and arches his back, his hips bucking towards you, his hardness giving a little twitch.
“Thanks,” he murmured, and Draco shook himself, turning towards Neville again.
Malfoy grinned in a most predatory way, looking Harry up and down while leaning back against an olive tree. “I’m sure I have no idea what you’re talking about, Potter.”
“You’re in love with me,” he repeated, more like a statement now, or maybe a confirmation to himself.
After a second’s hesitation, Potter said something to the other man, in those awful flaccid sounds of their language, and she flicked her tail impatiently.
“Did you think about me today, Harry?” Draco pants in between kisses. “Did you think about me in these knickers and what you want to do with me?”
“Oh, that’s right, you did,” Draco said with a smirk. “Now do it again.”
“I have a fire striker,” you tell him, “I always keep one with me should I need one.”
After a week of barely any sleep and no word with Harry, you’ve had enough. You corner him after breakfast, in the garden shed, where it almost happened the first time. There’s just the two of you. Brother Mark and Brother Matthew, who usually tend the graveled paths and weed them out, haven’t arrived yet.
to participate in this… this blasphemy! It is beneath me to taint an ancient tradition like this, I am not sinking to those levels quite yet thank you very much,” Draco sniffed, angrily pulling at the hems of his poofy sleeved shirt.
“You noticed?”
“Alright settle down, Potter. You do realize we have to act like a married couple at the retreat, right?” Harry’s laughter petered out and he sat down heavily at his desk while Draco perched on the corner. “You don’t think we can do it?”
Fuck. He needed to up his game, he could
Maybe Ebba had been right, Harry thought as he slipped his tongue into Draco’s mouth and felt a thrill of excitement at the moan Draco responded with. Maybe they didn’t need any love predictions. Maybe this was all the solstice magic they needed tonight.
And you tell him how dirty he is.
have you rip them off with your teeth”), after Draco had straddled his hips and taken them both in hand, after they had both come all over Harry’s stomach and after Harry had marvelled at seeing Draco’s breath stuttering as he reached his peak, when they were lying together naked and spent, Harry laughed quietly to himself while drawing patterns on Draco’s back with his fingers, making Draco look up at him.
“You’re on friendly enough terms.”
“ … “
Harry looks up at Draco in surprise. “Yeah. That’s how we do this, remember?”
? Draco, I practically threw myself at you.”
“Don’t play daft, you know what I mean.”
He looks to be about your own age, and his handsome features do not escape you. Neither does how untamed his hair looks, wild and unruly, in sharp contrast to your own sleek straight strands, and you get a sudden urge to run your hands through it, but refrain. You have more important things to do, and it would look highly suspicious for you to perform such an act.
Draco hummed, snuggling in close and preening like a cat at Harry’s fingertips on his back. “Can’t say I would, but consider yourself lucky I was willing to try this despite your abominable hygiene.
“You did the whole looking at her from under your fringe, while giving her that dazzling smile, you know, the one that makes your eyes light up and… er…”
“Well yes, but not… not in this particular way.”
“Taking advantage of being famous, I don’t like that. I don’t want any special treatment, I’m… I’m just like everyone else.”
You mostly keep to yourself, perfectly content with eating, sleeping, praying, studying the medical arts and taking care of the monastery garden with all its flowers and herbs, because you know you don’t belong here, not really. You know you’re not like the others, that you crave something different to them.
“That’s St John’s wort. I… I used them on your wounds earlier.”
You sigh, closing your eyes to fully enjoy the peace and quiet, only broken by the rustling of the wind outside and eventually the clank of the shovel as Harry puts it against the wall. You stay still, enjoying the moment, enjoying the sound of your loved one moving closer to you, enjoying the warmth of his body as he comes to stand tightly against you, his chest to you back, his nose pressing in just below your ear like it did in a tool shed so many months ago.
So, I know I have to talk to him about it and tell him how I feel. And if he wants to move out or wants me to do it, I guess that’s how it needs to be then, once we’re able to do that, but at least I need to come clean and explain why this is happening.
“Thanks, I owe you one.”
Harry tilted his head to the side, trying his best to look concerned. “Something wrong, Malfoy?”
Potter turned around, his face splitting into a childish grin.
He’s on his back, coming down from a spectacular orgasm. Potter lies draped over him, panting against his chest, Draco’s cock still half inside him. Slowly, Potter lets Draco slip out of him and glides down on his side beside Draco, leaving open mouthed kisses up along his throat.
This makes Goodwin laugh, high and clear, and just then Harry walks in with a tray laden with food. She takes a quick look at it and almost drops her chin, but manages to hide it from him. “Well, Mr Potter, I daresay that they outdid themselves with the food. I expected some heated cauldron cakes or a half eaten box of Bertie Botts, but fresh omelette and bacon? I didn’t even know they could make that. And is that treacle tart?”
Ron’s
Neville snorted, and Draco rolled his eyes before summoning another dressing gown. This one was black, and it was more comfortable than anything Harry had ever worn in his entire life: he let out a surprised gasp as he slipped it on and the sleeve glided along his arm, and then quickly tried to hide it by clearing his throat. He glanced at Draco, who was watching him with his mouth opened and his eyes slightly widened. He was probably appalled by the way the dressing gown was a little too tight for Harry: it strained across his back and he had to hold it together at the front to keep it closed.
, I already know that! But I also want to be a good and supportive friend so I guess I’ll just have to put up with it.
Draco’s not sure what Potter’s talking about. What’s a magician?
You both laugh as you scramble to sit up properly, Harry’s breath warm against the side of your neck, and you feel goosebumps all over your body. You place your hands on his shoulders, pushing yourself up, and when you see his face it’s like that time in the garden shed, his eyes dark and his breathing coming in shallow bursts. You can’t seem to move. He licks his lips, and your eyes follow the motion, the quick flash of pink so tantalising. You should get up, you should get away from him, but instead you lean in closer, his green eyes getting blurry, your mouth hovering just above his.
your irrational arse, calm down—no don’t you
Harry’s known for quite some time that he’s bisexual, but as it turns out, dating in general, and exploring your sexuality in particular, isn’t the easiest to do when you’re extremely famous. He’d had to resort to casual hook ups with men at Muggle bars, which admittedly had helped him find out that he really does enjoy sex with men as well, but left him feeling empty afterwards, craving more, something deeper, more meaningful. But Draco is his first
The words fall from his mouth without him planning to, like they've been hiding in there and taken the opportunity to slink out when Harry’s defences were down. Draco freezes and his eyes widen, and Harry realises his slip, that he’s crossed the line.
Harry flips her off, but she just snickers at him. “I think you forgot something by the way,” she says, pointing to the counter where Luna is sitting on one of the stools, dangling her feet and chatting away with Jane the barista.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Harry?” came Neville’s voice from the other room.
“Why would you be here by yourself, I thought we agreed that both of us would try to pull tonight?”
He almost has this, he thinks. Almost, but not quite.
Harry felt heat creeping up his neck, as usual when he was scrutinised by Draco. He cleared his throat.
“Mr Malfoy, I have a question!” a girl with a cheeky grin shouted from the back, jumping up and down with her hand up in the air, and Draco gave her a confused nod to let her know he was listening. “I was wondering, is Professor Potter as annoying at home as he is at school?"
, and the way his hands run through your hair feels entirely too good to stop. His mouth searches for yours again, kissing you deeply, fanning the embers further until they’re a roaring fire inside you. But you don’t care that they might consume you, you’d welcome the wrath of the heavens if it means you’ll get to lie like this with Harry.
“Of course,” he says, equally formal, gesturing for Potter to step inside.
You nod slowly. “Yes. Completely.”
wants.
“Well, I can neither confirm nor deny that I’ve been confiscating betting pools among the students on when you idiots are going to hook up for months now,” Neville said with a wink, and then he was off, leaving Draco and Harry spluttering.
I don’t really know why I reacted so strongly to that failed bread, but I just felt like a deflated balloon, like all air went out of me because of that stupid sourdough. And one second Draco was patting my back in a mix of pitying and comforting, and as I turned to him he gave me this awkward hug (I already know Draco isn’t the most natural hugger due to his strict upbringing) and when I accidentally angled my hips towards him I could feel that his cock was stirring. Or maybe I was imagining it? Either way, I started rubbing myself against him. (Oh god, that makes me sound like I was dry humping him like a dog, I really wasn’t, honestly. I was just moving slightly against him and he gasped and we both started sort of rutting against each other and suddenly my hand was inside his pants and he was unbuttoning my jeans and we did it right there in the kitchen.)
You turn around.
Draco came to stand beside him, arms crossed over his chest. It was a double bed, which meant they could well fit together but there would have to be… some proximity, Harry thought, panicking slightly. What if Draco saw his morning erection? What if he accidentally tried to do things to Draco in his sleep? What if
“Yes”
Silently you obey, getting up on all fours, supporting your weight on your elbows.
Maybe I’ll do that just to mess with him.
Suddenly, Malfoy said something to Potter, sounding like he was wondering what was happening. Nüwa shook her head, Malfoy’s voice throwing her out of the feeling of being aroused by Potter, and suddenly, she noticed the way Potter looked at Malfoy.
“Could we please skip the details and focus on the task of getting us unstuck?!”
Bringing his hand up to grab Draco’s hair, Harry uses it to keep him close, to whisper in his ear.
“Well maybe we could transfigure something into a bed or a mattress or even a sleeping bag?”
“With yourself then. You’ve done this to yourself?”
“I know you will,” Harry says, licking his lips. “And also, I— I want to see you. I want to look at you while you fuck me.”
“Harry,” you amend, and he looks up at you with drowsy eyes, giving you a slow smile.
Harry stared at him.
Harry approaches him silently, feeling Draco’s gaze on him the entire time, knowing by the slight tilt of Draco’s head how delighted he is with the effect he has on Harry. With a sigh, Harry drops to his knees in front of him, letting himself be bracketed by Draco’s thighs and looking up at him in eager expectation.
“I should fucking hope so, that shampoo cost 10 Galleons a bottle and contains Horklump juice and moonstone powder.”
You nod, allowing yourself to snuggle in closer to him, listening to the steady rhythm of his beating heart, and eventually you fall asleep.
“Yes, well, if you had more friends, you could throw a fun party as well.” Malfoy turned yet another page, even though Harry was convinced he wasn’t even reading.
,” Draco groans, and his cock gives a little twitch against Harry’s hip, noticable through the thin fabric of his designer pants. “Fuck, Harry, do you have any idea what you do to me?”
Malfoy was obviously trying to sound surprised, but Harry knew better than that. He glared at the tosser to show his dislike, and not at all because he couldn’t take his eyes off Malfoy’s infuriatingly well muscled shoulders, or how his chest showed through the lowly cut armholes of his top, or how those joggers must be held up by magic, or by the grace of some deity, because they certainly looked like they could come off enticingly easily. If one just tugged gently at them, they’d probably fall all the way down at once, and from what Harry could see, he realised with a funny feeling spreading to his crotch, Malfoy wasn’t wearing anything underneath.
kissed him, hands still fisted in Harry’s shirt.
He was reading the same paragraph for the fifth time when the door opened and Malfoy stepped out in a cloud of steam. Harry tried not to look up, but when he inevitably did, he nearly lost his bearings, because this time, instead of having it draped over his hips, Malfoy was wearing his towel wrapped around his hair. And instead of having a towel to cover his crotch area, he was wearing tight white briefs with red roses on them and a matching crop top. Harry didn’t know where to look. Certainly he couldn’t look at the way Malfoy’s hip bones were protruding, and the way the fabric hugged his package, leaving absolutely
“Hmpf. I suppose I’ll have to do that. And I
, Potter?”
Draco sighed. “I hate that people think I’m capable of this.”
He’s particularly offended when they’re hawthornes, since that’s one of the flowers he knows the meaning of intimately, having researched all there is to know about his wand and its heritage and powers. Try as he might to block it out, all the different symbolic meanings flow through his mind as if on a loop:
In front of Potter.
“Is this some tripe about blood purity?” Ron suddenly cuts in.
“Not yet, but— “ Draco starts, but gets interrupted by his stomach growling loudly. “Well, apparently I’m starving.”
Hermione’s eyes flick to Ron and back to Harry. They obviously don't believe him, but they let him be.
Malfoy chuckled self satisfactorily. “Oh I’m ‘seeded’ alright.” At Harry’s disbelievingly raised eyebrow he took on a more serious expression. “I would have thought you’d be aware by now, that with the right amount of money, and the knowledge of who to use it on, you can get almost anything you want.”
“I know what a fucking date is,” Harry muttered, suddenly feeling very much annoyed for no apparent reason.
“I think this could be good motivation to keep me on the right track,” Harry said, shifting on the bed to let Draco know he was ready for another round. “And if I fail, I give you the right to punish me as you see fit.”
” He pointed back and forth in the space between them. “You were the one just lecturing me about what we’re supposed to be doing here. You know, the fucking job we were sent to do?”
Draco flinches, but his eyes are flinty and impenetrable. “Anytime, Potter.”
Pansy’s knees buckle and she slides down, right there on his doormat, while bringing a shaking hand to her mouth. “He did?”
“Oh come on, Potter, you know you drive me up the wall sometimes,” Draco said under his breath, but something told him that the girls in the front heard him, because the looked at each other with wiggling eyebrows before they collapsed onto their desks in fits of giggles. Draco’s face heated when he realised the double entendre.
“Maybe this one will be more useful,” said Blaise, as he handed Harry a thick, heavy parcel.
Malfoy followed his actions with his gaze, his eyes lighting up. “Right,” he said slowly, with an ominous sweetness to his voice. “I guess you’re right. I’ll make sure to, ah, dress more properly in the future. Wouldn’t want you to get an aneurysm upon seeing my naked chest,” he continued, and Harry realised he’d been staring. Shit. He hastily looked down to his book again, pretending to read.
“I’m just saying—”
He shot up from his seat, ignored the startled outcries from the others, wrenched free of Granger trying to take hold of his arm, then promptly stormed out of the house, slamming the door behind him.
Just then, the instructor greeted them all, and Harry took the opportunity, while Malfoy’s attention was on her, to quickly strip off his own sweatpants and shrink them down to hide them under one corner of his yoga mat. When Malfoy turned to Harry again, he looked like he was choking on his own saliva, but he quickly tried to hide it by pretending to cough.
Draco turned the bottle over in his hands, looking at the pearlescent liquid inside. “So that’s why you’ve been absent these past few weeks.”
“Well fuck you too,” Pansy calls after him as he saunters out, but he merely blows her a kiss.
“Ask them to put you in a suite, then.”
“Need a hand, Potter?”
“I don’t,” you tell him eventually, feeling him relax against you. “I don’t regret it, but…”
I started strumming the guitar today and it took Draco ten seconds to stand in my doorway, asking me if I was about to learn how to play Wonderwall. He said it like it was a bad thing. Also, how does he even know that song? When I asked him he just rolled his eyes and muttered something about Blaise Zabini learning to play it in sixth year to get girls.
Fuck Potter. Fuck Pansy. Fuck
His last conscious thought is that he wishes he didn’t have to put her through this, make her hurt like this, before his knees give way and everything goes black as he passes out in front of her.
“Are you ready?”
Tonight for instance, I found him in the kitchen, slumped over the table with a cup of warm milk still clutched in his hand. I didn’t want to wake him so I had to carefully carry him back to his room. I didn’t levitate him because if he’d woken up I think it would’ve reminded him of
What was going on?
It was as if there was a collective intake of breath before the entire room went still, and it felt as if every eye had turned to Draco. While every atom of Draco’s body was focused on Potter and his reaction, his eyes were locked with Pansy’s. He thought he could see the tiniest flicker of remorse, of insecurity in them, but it did nothing to ease the betrayal. How fucking could she?
It took a lot of will power for Draco not to say something. Instead, he cast a Disillusionment charm around the two of them before unlocking the door and pulling Harry in with him. Draco ignored the shout that came from the couple and dodged a thrown remote that hit Harry.
“Potter! Malfoy! My office, NOW!” Robards' voice rang through the bullpen startling several people. Draco and Harry were not particularly excited about explaining everything.
You fetch Harry water, and you feed him pottage, and you tell him about the life and the routines of the monastery. He’s weary, but he listens attentively to what you have to say before he drifts off to sleep.
“What are you harping on about?” he drawled, idly turning a page and dangling his foot nonchalantly.
“I love you.”
children,” you say, hoping that he will ask nothing further.
taking advantage of
“Oh, did I not mention?” Draco sounds ridiculously smug and if Harry wasn’t so bonelessly spent he’d pinch him. “Since dating you means there is a lot of time for special occasions, I bought some new ones.” He waves his wand and a paper bag with pink tissue paper comes zooming towards them, smacking Harry on the forehead. Draco snickers and pulls out one of the wrapped items, biting his lip as he hands it to Harry. “So, for the next time, would you prefer daisies or sunflowers? I also bought a spare of your favourites just in case, because honestly, the way you go at them I knew it was a matter of time.”
“I… When I arrived I saw your name on the guest list and I… paid the crew to put us in the same room.”
Harry’s unable to answer, too busy breathing and focusing on relaxing as Draco pushes pushes
“So… you just need to… make sure you slide your hands in under the hem… like… like this.”
Shit I need to get laid.
The vines around Draco’s heart flex at the sound of Potter’s voice, and when he looks towards the door, sure enough, there’s Potter standing in the doorway, looking like a lost crup. Pansy draws a breath beside him, but he gives her a glare and she keeps whatever she was about to say to herself.
Malfoy didn’t answer, because their instructor was telling them to rise, with her calm, lilting voice, and then the class started.
“Sure.”
she’s trying to prove a point at this moment.
He gives you a long, hard stare, and then he casts his eyes down. “You told me I could trust you.” His voice is so small, you have to strain your ears to hear the words, but they hit you as if they were screamed.
Draco nods and Pansy mutters “A whole bloody
“Fuck off, Potter.”
I can talk to him about this.
“What did you drop?”
“Mr Potter. Mr Potter, you need to wake up!”
“I’m very happy that you like your present so much, but trust me, Harry,” Draco murmured into his ear, “there won’t be time for any video games when I get you alone.”
“Oh, do keep up, Potter. I
Harry slumped. “Yeah. Yeah I know. Gross,” he mumbled. He distinctly thought that Hermione was looking at him, but when he glanced over at her, she seemed to be deep in concentration with her notes.
“WHAT?!”
“What was that?!”
So you bite.
Draco woke slowly, he was seated in a padded chair of some sort, his arms tied behind him. He opened his eyes and saw that he was sitting in a room very similar to the one he and Harry had had their “session” in. He looked around frantically for Harry but couldn’t see him anywhere. Panic rose in him and he began testing his bonds, scanning the room for anything he could use as a weapon once he’d freed himself. Then his blood froze as he heard a soft laugh behind him.
Draco took in the sight of Harry, flushed face and chest heaving, eyes unfocused and watering down the sides of his cheeks. “Harry,” he took a step back and pulled Harry’s chin up so their eyes met. “No one is in your head. I’m not. It’s just you...He’s...He’s gone.”
“Not thyme.”
“If you say that at my funeral I promise I won’t come back to haunt you.”
“What?”
“I heard that!”
Anyway, Draco cleaned up the mess I had made and I managed to finish making the food, so we got to have lunch, even though the prospects of it seemed doomed there for a while.
“Because you care, even if you don’t like saying it,” Harry whispered back, tapping the top of his menu pointedly, “and lay off the drinks tonight, we need to be in top form.”
Well I told Hermione everything. About the sex (not in detail of course) and about the awkwardness between us and how Draco says he’s nervous around me and how I kind of want to kiss him but I’m also jealous of his relationship with Astoria. And she just sighed and gave me that “oh, Harry”-look. She might even have said “oh, Harry”, I don’t really remember. I do remember though that she told me I’m an idiot and that I’ve been in love, or at least attracted to Draco, for years now. She didn’t outright tell me, but I got the feeling that she’s been waiting for this to happen.
“Agreed. There’s no need to let his head get bigger than it already is.”
toenail clippings on the bathroom floor
Harry tipped it back.
He lets out a sigh of relief and then he starts moving, tentatively slow at first. When you don’t protest he picks up speed, dragging himself further and further out before pressing himself in again, and it’s so good, so uncontrollably good, everything is this moment and this feeling of him inside you, filling you up so completely. His hand keeps travelling up and down your back, until he reaches around you and grabs you in hand, and you moan loudly, bucking into it with abandon. You’ve never wanted anything as much as you want this, now, here, never felt this burning desire about anything, ever. Your vision turns blurry and you squeeze your eyes shut, feeling a thousand fires inside you, every single one of them lit up by him, by his body, his laughter, his eyes on you and you’re not sure you will endure the flames, but if this is the way you go then so be it.
Draco has his book club with Astoria right now and he asked me to stay in my room so I wouldn’t be in the way. I don’t know what he thinks I’ll do, ruin their intellectual conversation by talking about sports?
“Come off it, Draco, that’s just an old myth!”
Draco’s face is closed off, his defences up completely. “I believe I am entitled to set the rules in my own home.”
you. I liked it. A lot. I liked it so much that I forgot about the curse.”
It’s tentative, chaste, not at all at par with how your entire body sets on fire at the touch. Your first instinct is to draw back, to beg his forgiveness and say that it was a mistake, but his mouth is so soft, it fits so well against yours, sliding perfectly in sync with you, and you can’t ever imagine not kissing him, and finally everything feels
He turns around, his eyes somber, but there is hurt in them as well. He keeps quiet, and somehow you get the feeling he’s been waiting for you to do this.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco snapped and took his bag. “But I get to choose the bed.”
Reluctantly, Harry relaxed and looked around, but of course Malfoy took the opportunity to press himself past Harry while he had his guard down, ending up stood so that his arse (his runner’s tights clad arse, not that it mattered what it was wrapped in, and not that it mattered that it left nothing to the imagination, not that it mattered that it was the firmest fucking arse Harry had ever seen, or felt, for that matter) was rubbing against Harry’s thigh.
“Draco, for a Mindhealer who teaches others how to improve their self image, you’re very bad at forgiving yourself for what you did during the war,” Harry said softly, resting his forehead against Draco’s. “You’ve done enough to redeem yourself: you’re helping people work through their trauma, you’ve used your family fortune to start funds for war victims, you volunteer at the orphanage, what else do you think you have to do to earn forgiveness?”
with Draco, when he already had someone? Unless it was some other reason. Unless it was… Unless he’d figured out how gone Draco was for him.
