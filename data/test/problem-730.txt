"Suit yourself," she says, "but frankly, I hope this doesn't become a habit now. Not that I don't enjoy your company, but there are better times for visiting your friends than—" her eyes flicker towards the clock on the stove, "—six in the bloody morning. Sweet Salazar, are you trying to kill me?" She doesn't sound particularly angry. She sounds amused, weary, possibly a bit worried—and yes, underneath all that, perhaps a bit cross. But Draco knows she loves the gossip and he knows she's his friend, which basically means he knows he'll be forgiven eventually. Even though she'll make sure to bring this up as often as possible. "Not to mention leaving Potter alone in your flat probably wasn't the brightest course of—"
"Sorry, dear, can't talk right now," she yells from the bathroom. "I'm so ridiculously late, Blaise is probably going to rip my head off as soon as he sees me."
“It’s not
"Do you think they'll ever figure out a way to break the bond?" Draco asked, but Potter stayed silent.
No, he won't, not yet anyway. He knows his mother well enough to realise she'd try to owl Potter.
The mere idea makes Draco want to laugh a bit hysterically, because yes, Potter certainly travels all over the place.
The only bit he keeps quiet is the bond. He’s not sure he wants Harry to know that. It seems pretty obvious that he doesn’t.
Still, Draco doesn’t really think that’s the issue here. He rather thinks Harry’s got it all wrong, and the issue is something else, something having to do with the distracted looks he catches Potter giving him, a mixture of attraction and want hidden behind them, that he’s quite sure his wife is not getting. At least not from Potter.
"No, it just seemed like a pretty building to pillage." Potter rolls his eyes. "What do you think?"
And it all goes fine.
Draco has (badly, since his magic seems to be perpetually turned off these days) healed the tiny cuts Potter’s teeth left on his skin. But he still remembers what got them there. He remembers, and he’s not likely to ever forget. “It’s fine,” he says, even as his thoughts revolve around
Potter stays still. Not moving closer, not moving away.
"Potter." Draco's voice sounds soft, far away. It sounds as if he's speaking through a mouthful of cotton. He feels oddly at peace. "Is she your girlfriend?"
"Okay." A light breeze blows across Potter's face, sending strands of hair whipping across his forehead. Draco itches to push them back, to run his hands through that hair. It feels so much softer than it looks.
"It was a date, Draco," Harry said quietly, and Draco felt his eyes grow wider. A date, between Granger and the Weasel—yes, all right, he should have seen that coming, especially with the way they'd been hanging all over each other during meals.
"It's fine, Pans. It wasn't all that important anyway." Draco smiles weakly. "Go, now. Have fun."
is being cast, mostly because Potter must have said something funny while Draco was lost in thoughts. And, at least this way, no explanations are required.
In all honesty, Draco thinks he'd like to stay there. It's a more challenging job than the one he had at St Mungo's, and he doesn't have to deal with Potter there.
Draco dares a little grimace back—it's not as if Pansy is going to think less of him; she knows him well enough. "I just wish you'd stay away from those Muggle acronyms."
“I see your standards have quite risen since the last time I saw you,” Blaise says, looking around at his partners. Draco doesn’t know what Zabini wants, why he’s even talking to him. Unless…
Harry would lace his fingers through Draco's and lift his hand to his lips. "Don't ever do that again," he'd mumble into the back of Draco's hand. "Don't ever leave me."
“You think?” the mediwizard asks kindly.
"And you thought—"
It takes Draco two full months to come up with an actual answer.
"So how is Potter these days?" Draco asks, his voice scratchy from a long morning of not speaking, of staring down at his notes and scribbling new ones underneath.
on his laptop when she’s gone. He’s made himself a dark elf mage; it’s hilarious because it looks quite as angry as he feels, mostly at himself. (It’s also quite hilarious what Muggles think a mage can do, but that, yet again, is a tale for another time.) Twat or not, Pansy is by far the more organized of the two. Not that it matters one way or another. Even if he wanted to, Draco couldn’t take Floo calls without the risk of being recognized.
"It's a start, all right?" Draco kisses Harry softly on the lips. "It's a start."
That’s when Draco realises he’s been staring at him for quite a while. “It’s…” He clears his throat, as quietly as he can. “Yeah, it is. A bit.”
Draco never expects to hear Granger's voice coming out of their Floo room, but that's undoubtedly what he's hearing. He pauses, his fingers hovering right above the door knob as an uneasy feeling builds up in his chest.
"I thought I might as well take it with me and find out what you were trying to hide. You must admit it looks a bit suspicious when your supposedly gay lover keeps potions for pregnant women in his kitchen."
and he doesn’t know what else to do. Until, suddenly, Potter gets up and heads to the loo.
He doesn't let it.
The luck he lost all those years ago seems to, somehow,
Fear takes Draco's heart faster than a Seeker on a Snitch, making it turn to ice in his chest. He wishes above all things to be able to fabricate a credible excuse, one that'll allow him to vanish before Potter gets there—he wishes to be able to do that, and to be able to do it fast. However, his mind is silent, his body perfectly still, and Potter is like that prophesied catastrophe Draco can never seem to avoid.
Draco's work as if he knew anything about potions. Draco is not entirely sure how to feel about that—amused, occasionally, but mostly just annoyed out of his mind. Over the past few weeks, he'd grown quite fond of the bittersweet oblivion that was being no one in Potter's book; at least it let Draco do his job. Potter's commentary, on the other hand . . .
When Potter isn’t there, Draco often wanders around the house. He’s been cleaning up a bit, though he has to admit Kreacher has done most of it. Kreacher, on his side, seems to adore Draco for some odd reason that eludes him. In any case, indolence equals joy in Draco’s mind these days, equals plenty of time to do other things he likes, and no time at all to do what he doesn’t. So, frankly, he’s more than glad to let Kreacher work. Who knows? Perhaps working is his thing. He really doesn’t look too joyful when he’s not bowing and bowing, and saying
He was up pretty early, Scorpius woke him up crying at four. It’s rather nice he gets to go home soon this week, though he still has to stop by Potter’s place. On the way to Morden South station, he smiles at the old man who sells papers near the coffee shop. Then, he waves at Salma, his replacement from six forwards. “Naomi is going to bite your head off,” he shouts at her, over the wind, over the children playing at the park. “She’s been complaining for a while that you weren’t there yet.”
Because he'd been in love with the prat ever since the day Potter had walked into his shop, claiming to be hiding from the press, or since he'd saved Draco from the fire in the Room of Hidden Things, perhaps even before that, "—because he wants to."
“I think the
“Your wife doesn’t mind you coming here almost everyday?” he asks once, sprawling out on the far side of the couch from Potter. His feet are barely inches from Potter’s own. Draco wonders, could he, or could he not? Does Potter want to be touched? Should he… after all, it would only be a couple of inches. He could always pretend he didn’t mean to; we all make the occasional mistake.
Draco sips at his wine while he tries to imagine Potter at his job, which is what he usually talks about. Frankly, there’s too much blood in it to be anywhere near pleasant, so he tries other things, which tend to include picturing Potter naked and moaning all spread out on Regulus’ bed. He once tried to picture Potter as one of the trolls on YouTube, surprising himself when he ended up laughing. Potter produced one of his deep grins, and Draco raised his glass at him, quite glad no
But he'd be lying, so he simply nods instead.
Potter really sounds quite desperate. Why, Draco wonders, why indeed. Why would Potter be frenzied over an escort getting hurt on the job? It happens every day, especially when said escort just turns out to be Draco Malfoy. But then again, Potter doesn’t know the full story, does he? He’s such a… bloody Gryffindor, that’s what he is. Draco should hate them—hate
“Really? And which parts exactly do you mean? Maybe the part in which he’s obviously shagged you, repeatedly, or rather the part in which you actually
“Good evening,” Draco says, taking in the wide shoulders and Miller’s face, wrinkled around the eyes like an old jacket. Well, at least now he can say he’s sure of three things, the first one being that Miller overtly doubles him in age, and the second one that he doesn’t look too amiable towards him. He’s thinking the third one might be that he’s not one of those people where one can say, ‘Yes, I think he’s aged quite gracefully’, while not feeling like a complete con artist. He’s wearing a Muggle shirt, like Draco, only his looks quite a bit more expensive. Draco’s guess is he might work in finance, commercial banking or something like that. Pansy was right though, both him and his place look rather well-to-do.
Morosely, a thought goes through his mind: that he’s not going to be here forever. Draco doesn’t want to lose this, these brief moments that mean everything.
Hermione raised her eyebrows. “And that George Weasley killed himself two months ago.”
The moment she's done talking, the rest of them all launch into an endless speech about male pregnancies—". . . but there's been plenty of research in the past few years," one of them is saying. "What my colleague means to say," another one pipes up, "is that, should any complications arise, you can rest assured that we'll see them through with minimal fuss,"—and about all the things Draco can still do, and the ones he really, really shouldn't—"No drinking or smoking," one of the mediwitches chides, just as another one tells him, "But do try to eat lots of protein, and remember to exercise regularly."
“Why can’t we go back to how we were?” Potter begs. “I still love you,” his voice says, behind him, as he goes upstairs.
And Draco… Draco finds it hard to believe, especially to believe this is happening to him—him, the boy who lost his luck in a gamble for friendship that turned out wrong, and has been regretting it ever since. Particularly since he knows that brand is quite a bit more expensive than a mere bottle of beer, and Potter still bought it. For him. Because Draco likes it. Even though it was never on his shopping lists. For a moment there he recalls what he wanted as a child—friends, legitimate admiration. And this… this feels pretty close to that, doesn’t it?
"I did want to stay here with you," Potter tells him, brushing a strand of Draco's hair back with his thumb. He sounds surprised. His lips are so close Draco can feel puffs of breath brushing his skin as Potter speaks. "You're gorgeous. You know that, don't you? You're even gorgeous when you're sick."
. “Where’s the little one?”
It's magical. They're nearly alone in the room, and Draco doesn't even balk when Potter kisses him, and he doesn't question it when Potter offers to walk him home. They're standing in Draco's doorway when Draco says, "You know, I used to call you the new Dark Lord."
"What happened to your girlfriend anyway?"
Useless, like the Dark Lord said.
“Not him.”
opinion on having my memory set to zero on anything that concerned our relationship. I can assure you, ‘Yes, please, go ahead’ wouldn’t have been my first answer.”
“So, basically, you’ve been lying to her all along.” Draco’s not sure why or how, but something inside him leaps, quite pleased. Even the Bravest and Greatest Gryffindor still has some secrets to hide, and one of them just happens to be him.
He does have a plan. He figures that is what happens when he can’t put his brain on pause, not even at night, when pain is Death Eaters and the dark is way too dark to be good. It’s a great plan too, at least he thinks so. He
Honestly, he’d much rather they wouldn’t, mostly because he is no longer sure what he ‘wants’ them to do at all. Certainly not fucking. This bloke is huge, and keeps looking at him weirdly for some odd reason, and it’s kind of making him worry. Is his suit filthy or something? It shouldn’t be, he cast a Scouring Charm on it before he left his last date.
“Such a shame Harry didn’t go into Quidditch,” she jokes. “He’d be making millions right now.”
It's what he's been doing for a couple of years now.
Draco shakes his head. "You don't understand. I don't want Potter to stay with me because I'm carrying his child, or because he thinks I need help, or that he's doing the right thing or . . . whatever. I want him to stay with me—"
“Oh. Morning,” says Draco, just pulled out of the mess that his mind is these days. He leaves his cup of tea on the kitchen desk. “I trust you slept well?”
Harry asked, “Again? I thought... didn’t you take him yesterday?”
Draco is desperate enough to contemplate following him, but he doesn't.
“Besides, right now I’d rather focus on my career.”
"My back aches horribly in the evenings, I should probably—" he gestures weakly towards his bedroom, "—go lie down for a while."
Harry blinked his eyes open, staring blankly up at Draco.
And that’s the last thing Draco remembers saying. Mostly because he was too tired, too empty. He’s not what he used to be—the fighter in him died screaming a long, long time ago. Let him do what he wants sang to him, so he shut his eyes and swang to the rhymes of nothing, till nothing becomes all in a world made of dreams. He wasn’t sure he wanted to go back there. Just as he’s not sure he wants to be awake.
“Me? Oh, no. I bet he’s quite pleased with you—”
Except Harry isn't kissing him back.
Pansy looks away. She reaches for the firewhisky, drinking straight from the bottle.  "Merlin," she says, "Merlin . . ."
“Lie back down, please. Try to hold your face up…”
He finds himself, unawarely, smiling even through the pain that comes with the change, his appearance turning into someone else’s. Perhaps his luck didn’t run out when he met Potter, he rarely makes this much in a single day. He doesn’t even have time to change or shower, so he just straightens his tie, kisses Pans’ cheek, and sweeps through the kitchen into the Floo.
that got burnt, but whatever. In any case, his waiter was gone now, and Merlin, his hand really did hurt quite a bit...
he liked that, but he seriously does now. He wonders for a moment if him being pregnant has anything to do with this. It doesn’t last long though, as he sucks in a breath when Harry moves lower and puts his mouth on his belly. Right where it gets soft and vulnerable.
"You take nothing seriously," Potter snarls. "Nothing!"
"You don't know her."
“And you’d be right, you know? Because I never. Fucking. Got there.” He raises his arms, as if that gesture could explain the complexity of his existence. Unfortunately, they slide against Harry’s wrist, and Harry can’t help but shudder; he can feel the air chill as it goes through him, a bit like an air-conditioning device, only… gross. “Instead, I got stuck here,” Draco says. “With you.”
"The…"
By the time Draco reacts, he follows him, running as fast as he can. “I’m sorry,” he says, apologises,
“Absolutely.” Indeed, he’s rather certain now he’s bonded to Potter. Not that he had any doubt before, given the pregnancy. “You know what I remember now, too? That no one ever asked
Pansy holds up her hands. "Just saying."
"And apparently neither do I. You never even told me he'd come back after that first time."
When he finally manages to get a word in, he says, “I had a bit of a mishap,” and launches into a full explanation, (obviously leaving out all things on Miller and the gory details of his visit there), which only ends when he gets to, “I’m at one of his properties now.”
“I don’t think I’d be against that.” There’s quite a bit of amusement in his voice. “Please, go ahead. I’d rather like to watch—”
Draco swallowed. Not Fenrir, please. He knows what he does to children. Draco might have been sixteen, but… but in that moment, he wasn’t feeling so grown up anymore.
Potter rolls his eyes. "No, you prat. Because you care about me enough to buy them for me."
"You're right," Draco says quietly, "they don't."
"No, of course not. You're my only son, I'm glad you decided to visit." Narcissa's eyes hold his gaze. "I just worry about you. I worry that you're running away."
So when he arrives home from work one evening to find Potter sitting on his couch, looking sullen, Draco just assumes he must have had a really bad day at work. Spectacularly bad, if the way he's drinking straight from Draco's bottle of Odgen's Old is anything to go by.
“But not all the time. Not today, not now.”
Because Draco
They stay near the back of the room, talking animatedly the whole time. Draco knows this because he's been watching them—because he can't take his eyes off Harry. No matter how much he tries to look away, his eyes keep focusing on the way the she Weasel pats Harry's shoulder as she speaks. On the way Harry slips an arm around her shoulders to guide her to her seat.
weren’t there with him?”
Across from him, Pansy hides a yawn behind her wrist. "More tea?" she asks, tilting her head towards the teapot.
After the war, Draco would dream they joined Auror training together.
Draco wonders if the girl Weasley is looking after him now. If she's bringing him hot soup and tucking him up in his bed. If Harry has fucked her yet.
"I told you that you wouldn't get very far," Potter's voice came through the doorway. "You seriously thought I hadn't tried that myself?"
"Cheer up, darling. It's not like he was your first."
meant nothing to you."
. He knows  he might be exaggerating here, but it seems as if every single day since the Endgame Battle all news stories posted seem to come back to Potter. He knows it’s ridiculous, but it bothers him.
* * *
Pansy knocks on his door when she gets home. "Draco," she says quietly, "may I come in?"
There’s a glimpse of Potter’s mouth turning upwards before he leaves, and that’s good enough for now.
Draco and Pansy had been sitting side by side when Potter walked in. The eighth year common room was nearly empty, the fire crackled soothingly in the hearth, and Pansy might have been telling him about that girl in the Hufflepuff team, the one everyone thought was pregnant but no one actually knew by whom. Draco can no longer remember the details—in fact, he's not even sure he'd been paying attention.
Gradually, the letters stop arriving. He still gets a weekly parchment from Pansy and, once, a Ministry reminder that he ought to pay his taxes in the UK—which he knew already and will do eventually, thank you very much—but that's all. After a while, there are no more angry letters from customers, and no more demands that their orders should be taken care of even though the shop is now closed.
Images flash before his eyes.
The Muggles never seem to notice.
“They call that the opening scene, you see, it’s the beginning of your tale, that then moves on to the...” Hermione’s hands were moving all over the place, and Harry took a step back, because, honestly, he was so done with the Macchiato falling all over his hand.
“Oh, joy,” he says wearily, turning another page. Seriously,
“It’s not fair.”
“Are you, you know, happy…” Draco swallows. Somehow saying that word brings up a huge pang of hurt inside him, as if his own heart were bruised and bleeding, and he doesn’t know why or how it’s happening, but it
"Indeed, an easy win," he said, and Draco breathed out a sigh of relief. "Who would have thought you had a sense of humour?"
"Why not? You're not going to be able to keep working all through the pregnancy. Besides, you've been a complete mess ever since you broke up with Potter, I doubt you're getting anything done."
the morning afterwards.
*   *   *
“You think? ‘Cause I think that’d mean dressing better…”
“... cuckoo? Off the loop...”
"So? Maybe I'd heard it at work—"
In their second year of training, Draco dreamt he got invited to Harry's birthday.
Draco’s eyebrows rise. “Figures…”
Draco laughs once, bitterly, because if only she knew how much—how often—he's wished that was closer to the truth . . . but it's not.
“What are you asking then?”
That evening, Draco asks Pansy, "Say, do you think I—"
"And how can you be so sure it's mine?"
"Yet another one?"
"Yes, you bloody well should," Draco snaps, and for a moment, he almost wants to laugh at the scene they must be making, fists clenched tight, eyes flashing with rage over something as meaningless as a Blood-Replenishing Potion. Only none of this is funny, nothing about Potter having the nerve to come into his lab doubting his work skills to his face is even remotely funny. "See, apparently, your boss believed it when she hired me. If you have any issues with her choices, I'd suggest discussing them with her."
"Merlin's beard, for a moment there I really believed we'd be stuck together forever."
“I know, Pans. I
“Evening,” he greets. Admittedly, he’s only acknowledging Potter’s presence out of respect for Mother. “Not greeting people is rude,” she kept telling him, even though Potter here, the Hero of Heroes—or, if you ask Draco, the supreme wanker out of all heartbreakers—barely deserves that much.
like a password.”
“We haven’t.” Pansy shrugs. “He looked quite well-off, to be honest, I thought we might charge him extra. I told him you were new here so…”
"Hello, Malfoy," he mumbles, reaching up one hand to slip along the white cotton of his scruffy shirt's neck. Draco's breath hitches in his throat as his gaze follows the movement—he remembers mapping out the skin there with his tongue, with his
Something wild flashes in his eyes then. He grabs Draco by the hair and drags him close.
Furthermore, she’s the only one who’s always surpassed him back at Hogwarts, at least when it came to grades in subjects. He’s guessing there might be a slight bit of admiration within his rancour: he’s feeling quite resentfully respectful here and that, well, that is really saying something.
Draco blinks up at her. "Would you prefer me to leave?"
"You're having dinner with Blaise?"
“I know. It’ll be okay. I mean, if you want to. Otherwise we can… not do it?”
“Would you at least consider it?” Potter asks.
Except his eyes are green
It's been so long since he last felt that way.
Not even when Draco drags him over to Regulus’ bedroom and has his fun there, with his conjured ropes that, for some odd reason, Potter trusts and at last,
He heads to the kitchen to make two cups of tea—his strong; sweet and milky for Potter, just how he likes it—before showing Potter to the back garden. Draco sits on the steps there, holding his cup in his palms. He brings it to his lips and blows the steam off the rim before taking a sip.
. His entire world, reduced to bucking helplessly against Potter’s face, and it’s rushed, and sloppy, but he’s so, so close…
"Fine."
He turns it around and quickly scribbles,
Draco’s lips nervously curl upwards into a smile, a smile that’s more of a grimace than a grin. “Excuse me?”
“Besides, he’s married.” Draco closes and folds the paper, puts it on the table and points down at the cover headline:
Potter shakes his head. “Why would you do that?”
Still, Draco guessed that would be the end of his and Potter's truce, and for a moment, he was almost too afraid to look back up, to see the disgust in Potter's eyes. But much to his surprise, Potter simply laughed.
hero.
Fortunately, he never needs to figure himself out, because that's the last time Potter ever talks to him at work. Whenever their paths cross in the corridors, Potter simply looks down and away, and he even goes as far as to send Pansy to fetch his potions—which is so ludicrous it borders on pathetic, Draco thinks. But it's also a way out.
Perhaps he ought to curse
for it?” Harry demands, rancour humming on his tone.
Draco shivers. He could send Potter away, he could tell him he never wants to see his stupid face again, he could . . .
He brings up his Shield Charm and takes off after Harry, slinging a couple of
“Cheers, Malfoy,” he said. His waiter stood still, then looked up, tense around the edges. “I see you’re still alive.”
The next two months pass in a flash.
. Once he’s finished, he tells him, “I don’t know why you fret so much.” Fretting and fretting indeed, all while being everyone’s hero; it’s almost like Potter lives in a parallel universe, where he sees not what others think of him, the Lord of Lords. Merlin, Draco would give his life and more to have that much himself.
. He looked up. The waiter — hm, was he—no, he couldn’t be — looked down, said something that sounded quite a bit like ‘Salazar’ but it obviously couldn’t be. No, that was pretty much impossible since this was a Muggle establishment, so it might have been ‘soz’. Or ‘shite’. In all honesty, Harry quite preferred ‘soz’. It was much better than ‘shite’, he thought, because ‘shite’ might lead onto a fight, especially since it was his own
"I know I did. I just—I never meant any of it, I was so angry that you'd been keeping things from me that I assumed—"
Draco stays quiet, a fake smile plastered on his face. He’s been trying hard to believe his pregnancy is not the whole reason why Harry hasn’t left him yet. Her words though, they seem to imply he might have been quite close to the truth.
Potter's eyes narrow. Draco doesn't actually know who moves first. All he knows is that they're suddenly kissing—
“You know what they say, third time’s lucky…”
Draco nodded slowly, even though he was sure Harry couldn't see it—not in the dark, especially not while not wearing his glasses. "So now you'd like to try something new?"
“I wanted, you know, friends. People who admired me for what I’d done, not because their parents’ told them to. I just wanted… I don’t know, a normal life, kind of.” He doesn’t say,
“Indeed, why would there be?”
Draco laughs a bit hysterically as Harry delves into his mouth, dragging his tongue along Draco's teeth as if trying to taste every available inch of him. Draco's knees feel weak, and his nails are digging into Harry's shoulders, and Harry is moaning into his mouth. They're still in the middle of the bloody Ministry where anyone could walk in on them, and it's all so impossibly
“Can you even get pregnant? Is that even possible?” Potter asks, lets a nervous laugh out, and Draco… Draco feels like laughing too because at least now he knows he’s not the only one at sixes and sevens here. Potter sounds as well. “I honestly thought only women could—”
—and that Potter's mouth is harsh against his own. Ruthless. Draco presses his lips against Potter's even more brutally, and just like that, Potter's lips part for him. Potter's tongue glides forwards, effortlessly into Draco's mouth. It's funny how everything between them keeps turning into a competition. Even now. Even this. It's funny how he's just as determined to win this one as he was all those times before. It's funny how Potter is as well.
Candles would be blown, gifts would be opened, and Draco would wait until the first people started leaving before cornering Harry up against the wall. "I have a present for you as well," he'd murmur into Harry's ear.
“Would you rather be…” his hand goes right through Draco’s hair when he touches it. He bites his lip, shuddering.
"What was it about?" Draco asked. "This film Granger and the Weasel went to, I mean."
. It sits on Draco’s tongue for quite a bit, rumbling around desperately, almost ready to jump out any second now. But in the end Draco turns around, preparing to climb up the stairs. Only, Potter’s hand is clamped around his wrist, all of a sudden, and it shouldn’t be there. It shouldn’t even be touching him. Not after the look Potter gave him, back at the gala. Disgusting was written all over it. He cannot take that back now.
"Listen, about yesterday . . ."
Frankly, he’s not sure why, but he’s not too convinced. That smile looked a bit too sugary, didn’t it? Besides, “Your mum is daft, you often say. It’s not as if you care much what she thinks.”
He stares at the clock. The hand that has Pansy's name on it is pointing towards 'LATE! LATE! LATE!' and he can feel her eyes on him all through it, as if she's trying to puzzle him out. The urge to break down and tell her everything—of baring his and Potter's sordid love story to her—is almost overwhelming for a minute there.
He concentrates hard on the cracked plaster on the wall. He knows the room is hot, uncomfortably hot with so many people, but he feels cold inside, almost as if his heart had been replaced with an icicle. It's a mad thought, but some even crazier corner of his brain suggests it might not be an impossibility, and he wants to—
Either way he’s quite in with that, he likes it too, if only…
“Good,” he says when Draco is done. For a weird moment there, Draco thinks of the sport horses for sale he saw back in Galway, when Father took him there. Oddly enough, he feels quite like one of them right now. Like he’s finally passed a trial of some sort.
“You lot—” A moan. “You have—not a bit of integrity, do you?” There’s a ragged breath behind him. Miller thrusts back in, hard, really hard. It kind of hurts. “Bloody… Malfoy.”
It’s just one of Draco’s typical Saturdays.
“No.” Draco shakes his head. “Not yet.”
Potter snorted. "You keep telling yourself that."
Merlin.
Draco's throat goes tight. He swallows hard. "It just is."
“I’m asking for
Before the world swirls into a muted grey, Draco thinks he can hear Harry say, "Please don't die."
"You have a visitor," his mother tells him a few weeks later, when he returns from his daily wanderings through the town and its outskirts. Draco has met quite a few people in the months he's been there, so when he opens the door to the living room to find Potter standing there, he's understandably surprised.
“For you?” He palms Draco’s cheek, guiding his face to capture his lips again with his own. “Yeah, absolutely. Growing and spreading, I tell you.”
“Yeah, against the wall. It’ll be good. It’ll be great, I swear…”
Potter's jaw tightens. "Right. And I should just believe that, even though I've never actually tried that particular—"
"Really now?" Pansy raises her eyebrows. "And how's that working out for you? Because the Draco I remember from school would never have managed to remain indifferent where Potter was involved."
"You know," Potter is saying, "I did notice you'd put on some weight of late but I just thought—I don't know what I thought, that you still looked good, probably. It didn't even occur to me you could be pregnant."
Who could have erased his mind so he—who would have, indeed?
Much to his dismay, Hermione does take to dragging him out for a pint every Friday evening, and the Weasel trails behind her, dragging along a very disgruntled-looking Harry. Harry looks downright mouthwatering in his torn jeans and green Converse trainers, and Draco's heart stops beating in his chest.
"Because I know how much you like your sweets?"
Potter jumps down from the desk and makes his way over to Draco, slowly.
"Fine, I'll go," Draco said, giving in, and Harry threw his fist into the air. "But you'll owe me for this."
He basically broke her heart. He broke her heart, and he can’t remember it at all. Merlin, he must have been drunk off his arse. “I’m sorry, Pans. I’m so sorry…”
“Well, then I guess we’re having a baby.”
"—sometimes. A no-strings-attached kind of deal."
“That would be great,” Draco says, his lips molding into a tiny smile. And that’s how it all starts. A thoughtful twist on the wheel of fortune, plenty of evasion, and a few fabrications on what’s true and what’s not, partly thanks to Potter, and to hope well-placed this time.
Draco's heart skips a beat.
Draco rolls his eyes. “It’s not that easy.”
For a second there, Draco feels as if he’s being studied. She’s looking at him with very serious eyebrows. He knows the room is quite hot, but he suddenly feels cold inside. Inhospitably cold. Almost as if his heart had been replaced with a chunk of ice. “What did I say, Pans?”
Granger says nothing. Draco can hear Potter's hard breathing through the door.
"What, now?"
"Fine," Draco says tiredly. "Not here though, I'm supposed to be at work."
Sometimes, Draco thinks he knows Harry better than he knows himself.
It all goes well with their fake-slaps, at least until Potter steps between them, the strength of his magic forcing them both into a sort of midair paralysis. Weasel leaves afterwards, not before spitting blood at Draco’s feet—Draco guesses one of his hits did land, and isn’t that wonderful? And Potter…
He knew Harry was as straight as they came—even if the way he behaved around Draco had made him doubt that now and again. He knew that, and he had no idea why he'd even said those words when he knew the answer would just hurt.
"How may I help you?"
. It makes Draco’s eyes stand out. He wants to look good for him, he wants Potter to be impressed, as in truly impressed, fascinated-level impressed. Honestly, he’s been longing for that for quite a while, he’s just missing the
The big issue here is, Draco is not too keen on following his own plan.
“I’m fine, Pans.” Draco looks down into his tea mug. There’s an uneasy swirl in his stomach, pretty much what he keeps feeling these days whenever he thinks about swallowing that bland green foulness. “There’s still one of you and not twenty. See? I’m perfectly fine.”
Potter turns around, strolling towards the chimney. It feels like a punch, like a punch to the gut.
“They took my life away, Potter.” Honestly, guilt is being truly unreasonable here. He shouldn’t feel it now, not when that part is true. “I can’t even find a decent job. I can’t… I have
"Don't touch me!" Draco snaps, and Potter jumps back almost instantly. "Just . . . just don't."
Pansy says, “Oh, but that’s the thing,” and she says that
"You can't leave," Potter explained, "that's part of the problem, actually."
Draco raises an eyebrow.
All of a sudden, Pansy grasped the passport from his hand.
"Oh, that." Draco sighs, letting his eyes fall shut. "I'm going to keep it, obviously," he says, and Pansy's hand goes still—so very still upon his head. Draco blinks up at her.
Draco opens his mouth and goes down, all the way down. There’s a little sound from Potter he thinks he’s heard before, all small and desperate. It’s kind of exciting. Draco can’t remember the last time he listened so hard, or was so keen on others reactions. He never felt like this with his dates, but this is different. This here… this
“Zabini called last night. You have a date at eight.”
It had been true in the past, but right then, it felt like there was some sort of special magic between them. A kind of subtle energy Draco couldn't quite understand, but that kept pushing and pushing under his skin, pushing them closer, making Draco's heart beat faster whenever Potter was in the room—which was to say almost always, except when Potter was in the bathroom next door—and Draco thought . . . well, he didn't think it was the bond. He thought perhaps it had always been there, even before everything went wrong—before they both landed themselves in the Hospital Wing, before their potions accident. Only back then, Potter was never around for long.
It's ridiculous, and quite possibly driving Draco spare, and it seriously doesn't help the lack of control he feels over his life. Or the sense that his heart is going to stop functioning whenever Potter so much as addresses him—and Draco hates that, he hates it with a burning passion, but sadly, that never seems enough to stop Potter.
Merlin. What has he done. Draco thinks about meat wagons, Miller and
, he thinks,
say he was caring.” Potter rubs his neck in a slightly self-conscious gesture. “I should have thought… they sent all Death Eaters to—”
"Let go of my fucking—" Draco starts, but the rest of his sentence is obliterated by Harry's mouth.
“It was dangerous, Draco. There was a war going on.” And now the war is over and it’s all good. He can tell that’s what Potter thinks. But there are different ways of good: there is crazy good and nice good, there’s even weirdly good. And then there’s this here, between them, which is not even
"No." Potter lets out a slow breath. "I mean, yes, of course. But I also wanted to ask you, would you be willing to come back to the UK?"
," he said, emphatically, and Draco rolled his eyes. "It was about a violin, a perfect, red-coloured violin everyone wants to get their hands on. But—" his voice lowered, "—there's a twist."
Especially on days like today.
He can’t risk that. He can’t put his child through that, he just can’t. But he has, and why? All out of love not given back and being way dafter than a cow. And now it’s just waiting until Potter says something. Pack your bags, grab your things, or perhaps this is all mine, you can go elsewhere.
has ever said those things about him.
be around. St Mungo's has several floors and whatnot, and really, what are the chances of Potter constantly showing up at his? So there was that. And then there was the fact that the job seemed like a good opportunity to clear his name.
"We're just going to the new pub across from the Hog's Head, and it'll be just for a while, we're not even going to be there that long . . ."
“Hello to you too,” Draco says, under his breath. He’s a bit annoyed, mostly at himself: annoyed because Pans is not like his johns, annoyed that his first thought upon arriving was
“For Christ’s sake Draco, she’s removed the spell!”
He turns around. Several reporters are approaching him, Skeeter amongst them.
It's really quite a long list: Draco's legs keep cramping, he keeps throwing up, he feels weirdly bloated most of the time—a little like a small whale to be honest, even though the weight he's gained is barely noticeable so far—and then, of course, there's the small matter of being pregnant.
“I am.”
There’s a long pause, quite a bit of glaring involved. But afterwards, Potter says, “I’m sorry. You can have your sunglasses, okay?” and, “Look, why don’t you give your notes to Kreacher. He’ll do the shopping, and I’ll pay for it.”
, while Draco is trying to swim out of half-forgotten recollections. “You
Later, when they're both lying on Draco's bed, legs entwined, Potter's fingers tracing slow circles up the inside of Draco's thigh, he asks, "Doesn't your girlfriend ever wonder where you go at night?" Because he needs to know. Because the question has been eating at him for days.
Draco takes a step back. He's too tired for this. He's so tired of dealing with Harry, and he can always leave through the Floo room in the floor below. When he gets home though, there's a tiny owl waiting by the window; it's carrying one of those small flat disks Muggles make, titled
It's true. Potter has always been, in some way, the focus of Draco's life—an anchor, keeping him grounded. He'd been someone to befriend and then, later, someone to compete against, and eventually Draco had fallen in love with him. It feels as if Draco's whole life revolves around Potter, but perhaps . . . perhaps it doesn't work both ways. Perhaps Potter has been all those things to him, but that doesn't mean Potter has to feel the same way about it.
A lazy smile draws up the corner of Potter’s mouth. “‘You put the boom-boom into my heart’. What can I say, it’s a bit hard not to hear you when you sing to yourself night and day.”
At least until Harry jumps in front of a
“Draco?”
“Merlin, Harry—” Draco jumps up from his chaise longue and glides over towards him. That’s it, yes. You got it. He
(The Dark Lord was right, evil does trump goodness. The Dark Lord was right, he always was: Draco is useless. Useless, worthless and a waste of space. Just as he said when Draco failed, just as he said when Draco ran and ran and couldn’t escape.)
Draco’s jaw tightens. He looks down at the photograph again. Potter, suffering from wet hair—duh, likely he forgot there’s a spell to prevent that—on top of his generally irritable nature. He looks grudgingly grateful at Granger for an instant there, all while he manages to sneak behind her into the magical creatures shelter. Granger stays where she is, her wand pointed at whoever took the picture. Then the photograph restarts. Something aches in Draco’s chest, he’s not sure what. Perhaps he’s coming down with something? He rather hopes it’s that, and not a heart strike.
Silence stretches long in time, scratching onto forever before Draco decides to break it. “Give me my child, Potter.”
to do something, because he feels so fucking drained right now. He feels so wretched, and he's yelling at Potter when all he really wants to do is lie on his couch with his head on Potter's legs, and maybe talk to him about work or something—something dull that won't make Potter rage. And then perhaps Potter could tell him about his teammates, and Draco could nod along, and they could both be amused rather than angry, and wouldn't that be marvellous?
His smile is met with a kiss, Harry’s lips are salty when he tastes them. There’s yet another kiss, and another one and then Harry says, his hands resting on Draco’s shoulders, “Well then, I’m hoping here you also know your life can’t get much more normal than
It all worked fine at first: he made his way to the door, yanked it open and walked a couple of steps down the corridor, but it was right then, as victory was looming just out of reach, when he'd been on the verge of turning back to Potter and snidely saying, 'See? I told you I could leave,' that he felt it. A wall in front of him, a wall he couldn't actually see—transparent, but undeniably there. Hard air, impossible to penetrate.
(According to Potter though, they are done and gone, ever since his little adventure at the Ministry.)
He walks over to stand in front of Potter. Potter, who stares up at him, in confusion.
Are those… bones shattering? Merlin, he really doesn’t want to look, but he sees Fenrir’s eyes fixate on him and…
Pansy raises an eyebrow. "All right," she murmurs, reaching for the bottle of Odgen's Old. "Is this about him being the new Dark Lord? Because I already told you what I thought about that."
Of course it's Potter's baby, only Potter doesn't know that. Draco never told him that he'd slept with no one else these past few months, he never wanted Potter to know just how much this little affair of his meant to Draco. He never wanted him to know it meant
Harry, on the other hand, simply chuckles. “I highly doubt it,” he says. “That’s just Ron being Ron. Plus, he thinks you are.”
“Oh! Don’t worry, I was just talking to myself,” she says, smiling a smile much much faker than the one stuck to Draco’s face all through dinner. “Say, clean plates, where should I place them?”
*   *   *
On his fourth week there, Draco finds a bakery on the way home. Their windows are filled with bread, cakes and pastries, and Draco stares at them pressing his face to the glass, his stomach growling. But he knows he can't buy any of them without Muggle money.
"Harry!" Draco raced all the way to the bed. "Harry, wake up!"
cooks I can’t even swallow.”
And then there’s Walburga’s, on the stairs’ crossing. Potter hid her behind a blanket. It’s sometimes fun to lift a corner just to watch Potter’s jaw drop. She praises Draco for things he’s not, but the face Potter makes is, seriously, priceless.
Harry puts the bottle down. Comes closer, sitting on the edge of the table in front of Draco. “I love you,” he says. One of his hands curls around Draco’s chin, lifting his head up, so there’s eyes on eyes. Draco looks at him for a moment there. Then his gaze shifts away, biting his lip.
Sometimes though, on the rare occasion when Potter looks his way, Draco does think of hexing Potter, of punching his nose in until it breaks all over again—and yet, he never does. But every time, he feels his trousers get a bit too tight below the hips, and he has to excuse himself to pay a visit to the loo.
Draco fell back on the bed. "Merlin," he said, "Merlin . . ."
Draco gapes at his back as he turns to leave.
“Wotcher, Harry,” Fred said. “Off to work?”
show up.”
Draco crumples his nose and concludes, “Yes, well. I don’t think you are there yet.” Maybe at some point Potter will go along with his suggestions and start looking like a normal person. “We might get you there at some point.”
Perhaps it does.
“Harry, come on. You saw him. He was depressed, it’s only understandable that he—”
Sometimes it seems it’s all forgiven now, except for the ginormous lie that started all this.
Pansy answers the Floo call when it comes. "Harry? I thought you didn't have this—" Draco hears her says, and starts making his way to the sitting room, "—sure I'll . . . I'll let him know."
Potter stares down at his feet. "For real this time."
He watches Potter vanish into the Floo.
Draco keeps hoping he’d chosen a different path to get here, wondering how to undo what has been done. It’s rather pointless, because so far his best conclusion is that some things are better done than undone, and that even
Potter walked up to his bed, sitting down next to Draco. "No, I don't think it is," he said wistfully. "I think I'd like to go, someday."
, and left him scarred and broken without even so much as an apology.
"Will you ever tell me his name?"
He frowns. Suddenly his mouth feels dry, despite the water he’s been drinking. His hand feels cold around the glass, colder even than the glass. He thinks about the flashbacks he has at night. About how he messed up that day. He lifts his free hand; it runs shivery over his own face.
Merlin, Potter, swearing on Muggle gods, are you? Draco judges, like the judgy critic he used to be. Only, for a moment he recalls Miller’s stare and shivers, because he’s no longer that, and now he seems closer to be the aim more than the referee.
“Because,” Draco says.
"The twist?"
“Or... oh, I know! Stories. Yes,” she paused, nodding, “that’s it. Stories are sort of a cycle, too. See, to start one, you need to have a premise. All stories start with an exposition where you introduce your main character or characters, their setting, et cetera.”
"What kind of arrangement?"
He really should be working. He needs to finish fixing the Foe-Glass Mr Doge brought in this morning and then get started on the twenty or so Sneakoscopes the Ministry wants back by next week. But he's been in a shit mood all day, ever since he read that same stupid article this morning and . . . and it's so ridiculously hard to concentrate when his mind keeps going off on tangents, thinking about Potter and all the things he might be up to.
He tries to Apparate away, but there are hands on him and pain keeps him still. It’s what Polyjuice does: hurts like hell, feels like a roll of fire burning up his spine and he hates it. “Let me go,” he says, voice cracking high and helpless. “Please, let me…”
. “Does she even know I’m here?”
For a bizarre moment, this whole thing reminds him of the way his first time with Potter went. Fleeting, uncertain but certain, because he knew how all would go before it happened. He even remembers what he thought then, that there was something missing, and he didn’t know what exactly. Potter does matter to him, but sometimes he feels like perhaps he mattered before, too, and that he can’t remember how or why. It’s
"I came over with Pansy." And then she grabbed her camera and disappeared into the crowd. Draco is still wondering where the hell she went; surely she must have taken a million different photographs by now.
Harry nodded. “Off to work indeed.”
Draco watches him. Watches him fill Scorpius’ feeding bottle, watches him shake it, touch one side, grimace slightly. Quite tentatively, he asks, “You know what I really, really wanted, back when I was a child?”
"Earlier?"
Draco throws a cushion at her face, which she somehow manages to avoid even in her slightly buzzed state. He wonders if he should try to explain to Pansy how exactly Potter makes him feel, or if she's just going to laugh it off—and let's face it, she's probably going to laugh it off, but Draco is so desperate by now that he's not even sure he cares.
“Now, you need to be there
Draco spends his first two weeks there feeding them, but when the snow comes and mornings get chillier he takes to the tower. It's a nice place to think, he finds, small enough that his warming charms will hold. He can see the whole town of San Gimignano from up there, and it's really quite beautiful.
"They don't hate you, not really."
Amazingly, after a few, “Oh, you posh little bastard,” Weasel actually takes them, all along with an odd look, and never ever saying thank you. Or even apologising for having been such a wanker.
"I found this in your kitchen last week," Potter says, placing the vial down on the table between them, "right behind your can of Prince of Wales. It was Disillusioned. I would never have found it, except I knocked it over and then heard the noise when it fell off the counter."
me to sign that. If you recall, I didn’t really
"I really am, aren't I?" Draco hesitantly puts his hand on Harry's head. He cards his fingers through Harry's hair, and it's impossibly soft against his skin. Much, much softer than it looks, and Draco really must be off his face on painkiller potions for any of this to seem even remotely normal. "But I still like you a lot."
Draco looks up from where he's lying on their couch. "Why he's such an arse all the time?" At Pansy's nod, he adds, "I'd say that's just who he is now, new Dark Lord and all, but I know you're not a big fan of my theories."
And eventually Harry would catch him at it. Draco's throat would feel parched, but Harry would just wink playfully back at him before mouthing 'later' and go back to work.
Salazar, he really, really hopes Potter doesn’t know. He really hopes he hasn’t noticed yet.
Potter stares at Draco, as if he’s something new, something he wasn’t expecting, something he doesn’t even want to touch. As if he’s icky. As if he’s
"Why would I do that?" Draco asks, puzzled, only just then something clicks in his mind. The realisation feels like a slap to the face: Potter isn't here because he wants him, he's here because he'd like to be present in his child's life. Draco's eyes narrow, and something that might have been hurt curls through his chest. "Is this because I'm pregnant with your child?"
Except Potter does still come often. Only, now he brings beers instead of shopping, and seems slightly put out when Draco won’t even open his. For some odd reason Draco doesn’t quite get, that mere fact seems to press him to offer an explanation: “It’s not that I don’t appreciate the effort, I’m just not all that into beer.”
He pauses by the door to his bedroom, after reading Scorpius to sleep. Touches his lips, thinking of Potter’s. The way his gaze touched his own body, and how it looked different than it did before, it looked better, almost as when he fell for him the first time… It’s just a thought, nothing more. But it does cross his mind for a moment.
, because he used to resent him quite a bit more than he does.
right next to him. Only he's not going to sleep forever. He'll wake up eventually and there'll be questions then, he'll give Draco his best apologetic look, all while trying to explain that this was clearly a mistake, that they'd been drunk out of their wits, that this means nothing.
, his mind insists on Tuesday.
Pansy doesn’t respond right way, fixing Draco with one of her knowing looks. “You know…” She pauses, humming to herself. “I think you should,” she adds, while reaching out to grab the
He’s not too keen on being prey again. It’s too humiliating. He reckons he’s had enough of that up to now. He has the last tiny bits of what he calls his ego, whatever is left of it. Draco’s clutching dearly to them, thank you very much, even if most days it feels a bit like clutching at straws slipping through his fingers. He’s really not looking forward to making himself a victim again, not if it can be avoided, especially considering that to most of the Wizarding World he

anymore.
“I know,” she mumbled. Draco remembers thinking there about the look she gave him, back at the gala. It wasn’t pity what he saw on that glance. It was shame: self-shame, shame over her own acts. “Believe me, now I know. But now it’s too late to change it.” Understanding that much didn’t keep Draco from kicking her out.
I’m sane, Harry thought when Ron joined the bunch of ghosts. “What, you forgot?” Hermione said. “Jesus, Harry, what is
Draco’s eyes fly down to his wrist. Potter’s hand is still around it. It feels damp, pressing into Draco’s skin. His whole body suddenly feels cold, colder than ice mid-winter, colder than he’s ever felt before and he can swear every living cell in him
"Earlier, when you broke off," Draco replies. "What were you actually going to say?"
Draco’s tummy looks quite a bit bigger now. He thinks by now others can
All he knows is Potter is curled up at his feet, bleeding. He knows that, and he knows he's half-hard, and that none of this is anywhere close to normal.
Harry rents a small studio near the Collegiata, but visits Draco everyday. He brings him sweets and flowers and chocolates, and takes Draco out to dinner almost constantly. In some ways, it feels a bit like a dream.
,” Draco snapped, furious. “It’s still not.”
“I’m so flipping sane,” Harry told his mirror self. “There’s not even the slightest bit of wrong in what I’m seeing.” And then came Percy, Seamus, Zabini, Neville...
“Nope.” Pansy smiles sweetly. “Completely alone, I swear on my mum’s life.”
“Number eight. He quite liked the photo I showed him through the Floo.” She holds out a tiny piece of scroll. Doesn’t say what it is, but Draco’s guess is it may be Miller’s address—he has to Floo somewhere after all. He takes it from her on his way to the entry cupboard, where he contemplates the tiny stack of eights piled in there. No more than six.
Draco sneered. "Watch me."
Potter grabs Draco’s arm, shoving him up against the wall.
repeats endlessly in his mind. Anxiety grows stronger, so strong that reaching the other side of it, where things were dandy and fine seems almost an unattainable achievement.
* * *
"Fine." Pansy sighs. "But if he's the new Dark Lord, why would you be asking about him anyway?" she asks, and Draco glares at her.
"When talking to Pansy."
Draco stares at his own face, reflected on Potter’s spectacles. He wants to cry. He wants to laugh. He doesn’t know what he wants.
Like a filthy rat who just crawled out of a sewer, only deserving to be spit on. Stepped on. Not worthy of even a try.
wanted Potter back. "I needed to get away from him."
"I thought—it'd have to be a secret—but I thought we could . . . keep doing this."
"I wouldn't actually need to say anything if he took his work seriously," Potter snaps back. Pansy's hand is gone in an instant.
“Whatever. Look, just leave him be, okay? He’ll get over it soon enough.”
"So you do know this is my house?"
Draco's brain quickly shuts down. He stares out of the window instead, letting their voices blend into one another in the background. On the charmed landscape beyond the glass, autumn is swiftly fading into winter, the snow slowly covering pile after pile of dry leaves upon the ground. The last sparks of colour are being chased away by a heavy white fog.
"If you took things seriously—" Potter's voice cracks near the end. "If you took things seriously, you never would have broken off our bond the way you did, back in eighth year."
That night Potter fucks him hard against the headboard, his teeth digging into Draco’s shoulder until pleasure melds into pain. Draco bites his lip and says nothing, but he curls up under the sheets when Potter’s done. When midnight comes, he’s up again, watching the pink marks on his shoulder in the bathroom’s mirror, keeping
Draco wonders if he should ask now:
"Plus, you said you wanted to move on," Pansy adds softly. "Well, this is your chance. Now do so."
“Yes, I’m sure he does.” She waves her hand in the air in dismissal. The nerve of her! “Especially on all fours, legs open. But he’s a Slytherin, love, and a smart one at that.” One of her eyebrows lifts and she adds, sarcasm implicit in her tone, “Much smarter than
have, if he'd thought this was even remotely possible. It's just male pregnancies are only supposed to happen when there are potions involved, or when a very specific set of circumstances is met—strong magic, intense emotions, a particular alignment of the planets . . .
* * *
But in real life, that's not even remotely close to how it goes.
So Draco talks to Granger instead; she's surprisingly accepting of him.
Harry is just standing there, unmoving, until Draco starts to pull back.
Draco, who was about to have a second sip, pauses abruptly, barely avoiding spitting all over his hand.
"Shh," Harry would hiss anxiously. "Not here."
prejudiced, even back then.”
Harry spins around angrily. "Oh for—What the hell do you want this time?"
*   *   *
“Mercy takes no skill, mercy takes no will,” Draco mutters the mantra to himself, willing himself to stay calm, busying himself with his tea. “Have mercy on her and leave her be…” Does he really have to listen to her hogwash gibberish everyday? Because his mind keeps saying,
For some absurd reason, his mind goes blank when he sees Potter watching him on the mirror. He’s never been this close to him since sixth year, except perhaps those few moments on his broom during seventh…
, he should say, but every once in a while the word drags through his throat and gets stuck, “… gone?”
"This is all your fault. This is all your bloody fault."
"I know," he says. "Potter told me last night."
"Well, she did have a few things to say to me, apparently." Potter pauses in his pacing to look at Draco. "I'm sorry about . . . I shouldn't have said the things I said to you."
“What about it?” Potter asks, looking honestly shocked.
Inside, he's breaking faster than a pane of glass hit by half a dozen
And then, somehow, it all goes wrong.
Draco splutters. "How could you possibly have known that?"
Narcissa sighs, but her lips twitch into a mysterious smile. "And yet that's never stopped you before."
, blast him—shakes his head. “Nothing.”
Draco certainly hopes he will, and deep down, he knows it's not the first time this has happened. But this time, he knows getting over Potter is going to be much, much harder.
Draco looks into his eyes, drowns in the green waters of swamps.
with you?” Three tissues and an incommensurate number of tears later, she finally told him: “Ron died two years ago, one of his new inventions blasted and took him with it.”
“Sure,” Draco answers, having no clue who this Lily person is. It seems Ginevra thinks he knows though, best to let her think he does. “I’ll let him know.”
of all things, his patience, as if he had any—and Draco has been forced to sit through a long sermon on work ethics from his boss, he's finally on the way back to his lab.
"Is that why you're here, then? To apologise?"
Harry’s mind pondered for a moment before deciding that was possibly beyond absurd, but still...
He'd tell him everything. He'd tell him about the dreams and how he'd been in love with him for years. He'd tell him that there was no one else he wanted to spend his life with, that only Harry mattered. He'd confess he'd been far too scared, weighed down by his parents' expectations, by the war, by his own guilt. Far too terrified all along to ever really fight for what he wanted, but he'd be ready to do so then.
“Good. That’s…” Potter says, his eyes pausing minutely at Draco’s lips, with a hint of something that looks a tiny bit like attraction. Could it be? Draco wonders. Is Potter actually attracted to him? “That’s… that’s good.”
“I am his father!”
Even his own trial had been about Potter.
Instead, he picks up his coat and heads towards the Floo.
Except he can’t help wanking like mad that night, after putting Scorpius to bed. He wanks miserably, hopelessly, desperately, all while trying to convince himself that the dark haired lad in his mind is
Pansy snorts. "Healer wannabes, actually, but yeah."
. But when? So he just averts his eyes, lets Pansy look at him until she’s figured out something here, because he can’t. He’s lacking info, too much info that he should have but doesn’t, and that itches the wrong way.
Draco blinked. He pushed himself up on his thighs, moving to straddle Harry. He felt light-headed, so light-headed he could have sworn he was drunk—drunk with the knowledge that he was doing something unbearably stupid, making the one mistake that would condemn him forever. But somehow, Harry wasn't pushing him away. Harry was just holding his waist, rubbing his thumbs along Draco's hipbones.
. What better way to start the day? At least that’s what he thought up until Father’s name first showed in the cover, most often paired with the words ‘Death Eater’. (He’s not even going to mention his days in Azkaban, it’s just much easier to pretend they never happened.)
Hermione blinked. “Yesterday,” she said, extremely slowly, “was Sunday, Harry,” in a voice that kindly said
Outside them, he didn't.
“Definitely. You used to be like this,” she says, holding up her pinky, “and now… what, Potter hasn’t noticed yet?”
But still, Draco never actually planned to sleep with Potter.
“Didn’t I tell you?” Potter grins up at him, the twat. “There’s truth to some clichés.”
"But then there are other times when you do things like my birthday, and they feel so wonderful I just don't know how to—"
“What, already?”
. That’s what he would have said in Potter’s place.
“He did say something, I just can’t recall what… hold on, it has to be around here, somewhere.” Searching through the stack of papers piled in front of her, she comes up with a card. She stares at it, squinting a little to read whatever’s written there. Draco is weirdly amused in his shivery state, he’s been telling her for quite a while she ought to buy a pair of specs, yet she keeps refusing. Last time he brought it up, she looked at him over her shoulder and sneered, “And throw all my glamour down the drain? No, thanks,” uptight like she is, a total berk.
"Malfoy," Granger greets him, "long time no see. I didn't know you'd be here."
Draco licks his lips. “Does it bother you?”
He may have daydreamed about it on occasion, and not even all that often, to be fair. Just on those days when work was particularly slow, or when he walked past one of those huge Firebolt adverts on his way home; the ones with Potter shirtless, a light sheen of sweat making the sides of his neck glow warmly under the flash of the camera as he flew forwards in an infinite loop.
tired of being the one who's only meant to be talked about in whispers, or better yet, not talked about at all.
“I could get a Muggle job if we need the cash. It’s not like they care who I am.”
"I didn't know—you could have told me you were sick, I would have brought—"
,” he corrects. “It’s the tiny book with manky pictures that don’t move.” Not like the videos on YouTube. He wonders how they do that. Muggles seem true masters at living without magic.
“God, yes.” Apparently it was the right response, another point for him in the Get to Know Your Muggle Workmates game. “I called to have it repaired, but the blokes came almost an hour late… flipping disgrace, I tell you. I keep hoping today is over. Tomorrow can’t be this bad, can it?” Then, she asks, “And you? Going home already?”
“My point is you didn’t get one,” Pansy says, “and you can’t live like this forever. You’re taking too much Polyjuice, it’s dangerous! You could…”
"Why have you come back, after the other night?"
to lose
“And he was alone?” He really, really hopes she’s not, or else. “Weasel and the Mud—
“That I am what,” Draco asks, rather suspicious, “exactly?”
"But you can't know that, can you?" Potter's features harden. "You can't know it's mine. It could be anyone's baby in there, and the only reason you're telling me now is because you want something from me. Just like everyone else."
"No, I don't suppose he would, the great Gryffindor prat." She pauses, tapping her fingers against the side of the table before muttering under her breath, "But then again, perhaps he doesn't need to."
"I'd rather not owl the new Dark Lord, thank you very much."
“Yes, just not with…” He makes a gesture, grabs his own wrist. He’s not even sure what he’s trying to imply here, other than anything, but please no ropes involved.
"The baby, of course."
Potter looks up. Says, “Turn around.”
It’s hard work, what they have him doing at the bar. That much is true. So hard indeed Draco’s taken to being really, really grateful for having magic on his side when he goes home. Especially when washing yet another glass might make his fingers drastically fall off, with how jaded they feel all day long. But at least he gets paid, even if not quite as much as before. And anyway—Draco shudders in revulsion—he likes what he’s doing now much, much better than lying back down and spreading his legs for others. This is nowhere near as shameful as that was.
“How?”
“What, again?”
She’s done nothing but what Draco’s done. What he’s doing. All for…
“I feel like the other one would have been for me,” Ron, the ghost, said, and Harry answered, “Indeed. And pay attention to whatever she’s saying because that’s also meant for you.”
“Ooh-kay...” Hermione said, as if everything was just fine and peachy and dandy.
It's as if a spell has been broken.
"Hey," he says softly, bending down to kiss Draco. "Love you."
Potter's eyes flare up in anger. "I am taking it easy."
"I've been thinking I'd like to become a Healer."
"It's madness, that's what it is! It's just—look, all I'm saying is that people don't go from being linked at the hip to hating each other in a matter of seconds."
"I just . . . I don't understand," Potter is saying, "why didn't we use protection if you knew this could happen?"
But by now, Draco is quite used to living with that.
Draco is stunned into silence. He'd always assumed that was what Potter wanted back then, that
“Er, no. No.” Potter holds his hands in front of him as he walks backwards towards the door. “Thanks, but no thanks.”
Done. He’s done, Draco thinks, hopes. Please, let him be done. Please…
“So you keep saying.” Her nose curls up in disgust. “Anyway, the waiters over there knew him,” she goes on. “They called him by his name and all. I really didn’t want Potter to see me, so I left. Plenty of cafés around that street, no need to stay in the one he’s in.”
, but he thinks he should, and
"Funny, I seem to recall you dropping by at two in the morning to tell me you just had," she says, "but I guess I could have imagined that."
And, honestly, he doesn’t think that tiny moment when shame ate him whole, is something he needs to share with Potter. He wouldn’t even be able to tell Pansy, and he trusts her much more than
"You keep saying that, but he's a Healer in training now, Draco. Hardly the right qualifications to become a Dark Lord of any kind."
“You know that,” Harry says, “don’t you?”
He looks miserable, and a small part of Draco wants to feel glad, to gloat about being the one who's put that look there—
"Okay. So it's a potion. That's good though, isn't it? It means we just need a bezoar and then—then we can both walk out of here and go our separate—"
Fuck.
Harry looks up. "You're drugged, Malfoy," he says slowly.
“Bollocks. Let them hold grudges,” Harry whispers, his arms tightening around him. A shudder of want shivers down Draco’s spine. “It’s not like I care,” Potter adds. “You—” he turns Draco’s head towards him, a hand under his chin “—shouldn’t care either. We’re together in this, that’s all that matters, alright?”
He is just going to have to do with that. So he inhales, gets up, and follows Potter to the bathroom.
Though it’s a wonder that his spine is intact…
"What are you going to do?" Pansy asks. She's sitting on Draco's couch with Draco's head resting on her lap—the exact same couch Potter had lounged on all those months ago, when he'd come back after that first one night stand that wasn't really.
“What?”
Eventually, he decided not to. The baby came first. And anyway, Potter was the one who needed to apologise here. Draco had already apologised too much, definitely too often. Obliviating them both wasn’t exactly Draco’s idea, which means Potter here, isn’t exactly quite as guiltless as he has everyone believe he is. Rather the opposite. He might even be the reason Draco ended up as an escort.
Weasel seems to be quite pissed at Potter. Draco has to admit he found it rather entertaining at first, he’d expected himself to be the main aim of Weasel’s comments. Instead, most of Weasel’s jibes tend to be directed at his own best friend, and that’s all right at first: Weasel’s world is one where Draco is not. It would have bothered him any other time, he’s never been a great fan of ignorance towards himself. Now, however, it suits him just fine. It’s not like he’s particularly willing to waste a minute, even a mere second, in chatting up to a carnivorous mammal with brownish fur and tiny legs, especially not when that mammal is Potter’s friend, the one who once laughed at him and then kept calling him ‘Ferret’ all through Hogwarts.
It doesn't matter.
Draco smiles too, quite entertained himself because that’s all it takes to seal the deal. He’s in. Potter, apparently, is too, and perfectly aware of where this is going.
He’d have inherited it, if it weren’t for its last owner changing the will to include Potter. It’s always smelled a bit funny, like stale cloth and dust. He’s always assumed it must have been the emptiness: his first cousin once removed being locked up in Azkaban, the rest of the Blacks who ever lived here, dead, disinherited. Or perhaps like Mother or that mingebag aunt of his, both of them married to someone else. Now though, he’s assuming Potter might be the one at fault: it’s technically his, and it still smells ghastly. In fact, perhaps Draco should have a chat with him—or with his house-elf, whatever it is its called.
"'Seeker Potter to go on week-long holiday to France after Quidditch World Cup, along with his current girlfriend'," she quotes, her polished nails trailing under the headline as she reads. She looks vaguely expectant, as if she thinks Draco must be dying to talk to someone—
Indeed, Draco seems to have a hard time focusing on Potter these days without fixating on his nose. Or his mouth. Or his stupidly green eyes. As Potter chuckles next to him over something that still escapes him, Draco finds himself sliding a hand around his neck and guiding Potter's head closer to his own, until they're both breathing the same air.
“At last!” Pansy says when he gets home, her concerns blatantly evident in her gaze. “What on Earth happened to you?”
"Potions. I've been working on my thesis, so I haven't had much time to go out or—" Draco shrugs, "—socialise, I guess."
Come morning, Draco thinks, he'll hand in his resignation.
comes. Draco has to admit his petty thoughts have turned softer lately. He’s not sure why, but some days he catches himself thinking Potter does have some charm after all, that he may have been drawn in by it. Who knows?
“He really wasn’t caring.
“Are you sure? Doesn’t really look like nothing…”
*   *   *
Harry speaks for him at his trial. He speaks for a very long time, saying things like Draco was brave and had been under duress, that everything he did, he did for his family, that the war couldn't have been won without him.
Good? Not good, amazing. “Merlin, please…”
He catches Pans reading over his shoulder for a moment.
Then, she steals one of his carrot sticks, munching unashamedly in front of him. The massive prat. Draco watches her, eyes narrowed. Is she up to something? Because it seems she is, but he’s not sure what exactly.
“What happened?”
plays on his laptop, and he’s all unwinded and loosed up, not in a hurry at all. There’s no rush, nothing to do today except maybe chill, and perhaps Floo Pansy. He does feel a bit lonely some days, and most weekends Harry doesn’t show. Unless he’s working, but Draco knows he’s not today. Which, he guesses, means the whole day for himself.
Just like that, he feels his hand flying forwards, crashing against Potter's nose in a twisted repeat of the incident near the beginning of their sixth year, the same incident he's been reminiscing about for months whenever Potter got on his wrong side at work. He feels the bones crack against his fist. He sees Potter falling, slowly, a steady stream of blood turning his mouth red, red, red, and Draco doesn't know what to think about this, he has no idea what to do about it, how to fix this, because how is this not messed up?
“My, my. Up the duff, are you?”
It could even be both at the same time, he thinks. Respect
, and keep going.
For the first time in his life, Draco thinks he might even be
, but out of reach. The fact that he’s thinking this now is even odder, because not something, but some
, Draco’s mind says.
“Hell must have frozen over by now,” Draco says, softly. “A hundred times over…”
Not any of them, please. He tries his hardest to crawl out of it, to come back to what’s real and what’s
“No, I’d love to,” Draco says, though he’s not willing to admit how much. He’s not willing to admit he’s bonded. Just as he’s not willing to admit this is everything to him.
"I could ask to have a different potions expert assigned to my orders and that'd be perfectly fine," Potter tells him when he drops by to pick up his potions. He seems so intense as he says it, so focused.
He's got no idea what he wants.
And Draco feels so stranded as he pulls on last night's trousers. The clean shirt he grabs from his wardrobe feels like the last thread connecting him to reality. It's stupid, bordering on unreal—it's absolutely ridiculous—but he still finds himself standing there, clutching the expensive material in his hands so hard there'll probably be wrinkles when he wears it.
Long after she leaves, Draco looks at his own image on the old mirror in his room. Places careful hands on his stomach, their light touch trailing over it until his fingers touch each other in the middle. It can’t be. But it is. When did he bond to Potter?
Granger has a distraught look on her face—she looks like she
"What did you just say?"
“None of them?”
millions, mostly from all the press coverage.
Weird to think that this is the first time he really touches Potter’s cock. Weird how much it suddenly seems to matter. He used to touch men’s pricks every single day, and it has never made him feel like he’s feeling right now, like it means
And Harry thinks, even this moment here is past, because everything, everywhere is past and there’s not even present — present is but an instant, a mere second,
Potter nods. “You looked lost in your thoughts for a moment there.”
“I’ve tried to explain this to her. She just doesn’t get it,” he says.
“No, he can’t,” Draco grumbles. “He’s coming with me.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco says. “I’m really sorry. Please don’t…” …
“Oh, dear. You
Potter is staring at him, and Draco is pacing through the room because he
"I don't know," Draco states, freeing his hand from Potter's grasp. He rises to his feet and starts walking back to the villa—away from Potter—as fast as he can.
Draco can’t help paling upon hearing that comment. Not because of the words per se, but
"We really just sleep together—"
“Pansy,” Hermione said, “Ginny’s girlfriend, died in her sleep, without pain,” while “Lavender and Dean died in a car crash last Friday,” and “McGonagall mistakenly cursed herself, apparently she mistook her image to be that of an intruder. Such a shame, isn’t it?”
So he and Harry start training together—along with Granger and the Weasel—and Draco doesn't talk to him for a whole year. Not even once. He has no idea how to approach him. He has no idea what to say, or if Harry would even
“Anything at all. Whatever you want, it’s yours. But please, come back.”
Potter eyes land on the treacle tart, where it's resting on the table. "I see you've been thinking about me," he says, lacing his fingers with Draco's.
The next day Potter brings a beer for himself, as usual… and a bottle of Vigneto Saetti for Draco.
. “I don’t know. Maybe.” And he knows, he just knows, that his ‘maybe’ here sadly means ‘yes’. “You’re always a good boy anyway,” he says, with a shake of his head before settling back into the couch, next to Harry. He pushes Potter’s fingers off when they start climbing over his thigh, and adds, “At least according to the press.”
“I wasn’t—” Harry swallows. “I’d never say… that.”
“I’ve already apologised for that.”
Merlin, it really was quite hot, wasn’t it? Like
Draco nods, and they both grimace at each other, though in truth behind Draco’s grimace hides the thought of how massively wrong they all are.
Once it’s uncorked, he raises his hand. “Cheers,” he tells his mirror self, and as a toast, he smiles a fake-smile to it. Then, he swallows the concoction with an ick.
Miller seems satisfied enough with his answer, but remains quiet. Draco wonders, for a second, if he’s going to have to do all the work here, at least until he concludes that
, and a measly piece of parchment torn off one of their prescription forms.
Eventually, Potter grows tired of avoiding Draco and goes back to Draco's lab. He sits near the back of the room, talking to himself as Draco works,
His life, for once, seems worth living. Here’s to hoping it will stay this way for a long time.
“My, my,” she says, and maybe it is after all. My, my, release the grudge. Break now, or become stronger.
“I had more important things in mind,” Draco replies curtly. He wasn’t sure if he would live through the ordeal, let alone be set free. The lands and accounts left to him were as good as seized once his father was removed from the picture. Granted, there was enough to pay the settlement, but barely so. “Just to shut your trap,
“... which I’m not. And in all truth I think I do look a bit younger than you do.”
"You know," Draco said, leaning his head against Harry's shoulder, "I've never been to the cinema either."
"I'm not sure that's a good idea," Draco mumbles. But still, Potter looks desperate enough that Draco winds up grabbing a roll of parchment from under the counter. He hastily writes down his address and hands it to Potter, and Potter thanks him before he leaves.
. "Shut the fuck up! You know nothing . . ."
"Piss off, Potter," Draco rasps, pressing his forehead against the cold surface of the toilet. Seriously, of all the inconvenient times to drop by—it's almost as if Potter needed to see him at his most humiliating moments.
“I don’t think we’ve ever used this one before,” he ponders.
"What?"
Draco chews on his lip. Yes, but not tied up. He doesn’t like—doesn’t
Pansy shrugs. "Don't blame me, you're the one who's been acting weirdly. You were even humming some Muggle song earlier, while cooking—I mean, Muggle songs, Draco? For Merlin's sake, you don't even have a radio . . ."
him. He doesn’t want her pity, not now, not ever.
"Shut up!" Draco screams. His breathing is coming hard, sticking in his throat and burning in his lungs, and Potter is so close to him—so close Draco can feel his body heat on his skin, close enough that he can feel Potter's breath against his face,
“Oh, sweet Merlin…” Draco shudders, grips Potter’s forearms. Bites his lip again. Potter really looks quite focussed down there, but focussed in a good way, in a way that’s making Draco shiver all over when Harry licks one of his nipples. “Do that again.”
Harry glances between them, looking for all the world as if he’s missed something relevant here. Draco thinks perhaps he has, being a Gryffindor and all. “What does he mean?”
Draco's hips roll with Potter's thrusts—it feels delicious, and he's pretty sure he won't last much longer—they've both had ages of weird foreplay after all, even if it didn't feel much like foreplay at the time. As Potter's cock keeps nudging Draco's prostate, Draco can feel his eyes slide closed. Potter's hand finally wraps around his cock, pulling on it firmly, and suddenly, Draco is coming all over Potter's hand.
Draco rolled onto his side to look at him full on. It was funny, he thought, he'd had the Dark Lord living in his home for a full year, he'd put up with the Carrows, mad Aunt Bella and that half-breed Fenrir, and one way or another managed to survive them all. But somehow, spending the rest of his life bonded to Harry Potter felt much, much scarier than all that.
Miller leaves his glass on the table. “Strip,” he orders. “I want to see you naked.”
Draco rolls his eyes, but stays there while Potter goes to pick up glasses. He stays there definitely not staring at Potter’s arse as he walks away. Potter brings back one of the bottles he bought for him, ages and ages ago, back when Draco still lived here. Draco’s heart aches with longing, aches with wanting, aches with… all of this. Aches with Potter down on his knees between his legs. Aches with the taste of his come on Potter’s tongue right afterwards.
"Fine, okay, perhaps they used to hate you. Probably," Harry admitted. "But look, it's not like they're going to hex you while I'm there. I'm still bonded to you, it'd be a bother to have to levitate you all the way back to school."
Living days past beyond all measure. Only, they weren’t, aren’t, he didn’t…
"Congratulations, Mr Malfoy," she says, giving Pansy an odd look before continuing. "Of course, we'll need you to come back next week for us to run a few more tests, but it would seem you're six weeks pregnant."
He feels shaky.
Something fragile flutters in his chest, under Potter’s gentle prods, something he’s quite sure is long-term fatal. Draco has never been a risk taker, so he shoves it down and pretends its not there.
And it doesn't last. It doesn't take long for Harry's brain to catch up with him, for Harry to push him back, push Draco off him yet again.

"Variations on potions brewing, particularly when it comes to the use of eel eyes instead of newt's while brewing Dreamless Sleep Potion."
"I'm not Catholic. As far as I know, neither are you."
"I thought—people talk, you know? I overheard the Weasley girl telling Lovegood about you at work, the other day, about how Potter has been spending more and more time at your place these past few months, and they just assumed . . ." She snorts inelegantly, slumping down further into her chair. "Of all things, they thought you two had somehow managed to become friends. Imagine my surprise," she goes on, in a derisive tone offset only by the pleading look in her eyes. "Only they don't know half the story, do they?"
Draco’s heart thumps in his chest. He tries not to trust it too much; this could be heaven, this could also be hell. “And?”
No. No no no. Not Fenrir, please.
And loves him.
"—and I know it's not ideal, but well, maybe—"
“Fine enough,” Harry says.
His whole world moves fast and faster, on a spin forward with no stop. He hears the Dark Lord’s voice in the distance, kill Dumbledore or else… or else Mother, but
Draco doesn’t answer. He just leaves.
"Well, thank fuck for that . . ."
"Leave," he grits out. It was never going to work anyway; he should have seen this sooner.
"What the—"
“Ah. Going Zen on me, I see,” Pansy teases. “You are getting quite good at that. If I recall correctly, it’s been seventeen hours since you turned my burlesque hat into a yellow pickle.”
They fumble with each other's clothes until they're both lying naked on the couch, the hard planes of Potter's body fitting perfectly between Draco's thighs, and Draco has to bite down a gasp as Potter's cock slides against his own. It's shocking how well they still fit together, even after being apart for so long.
. That’s what the Dark Lord’s laugh sounds like. Like squashing your marrow till you bend and bow and say yes yes yes because, “You are mine.” The mark on his skin burns, itches. He yearns to scratch it.
to make this last.
, he thinks. His life, in one of those old poems.
, that’s what he was. And if he was honest, said sycophants were just following the Golden Rule all Death Eater born sprog must abide to: obey their parents’ orders to death, or something of the like. Draco did deviate from that part of the script for as long as he could. At least up until sixth year. Then again, he must have done a crap job of it because, by the time he wanted to back out, he couldn’t. By that time, the Dark Lord and his cronies were already chumming it up back at his parents’ manor, and the consequences for disobedience were too close to ignore, not to mention way too horrifying to risk.
In his mind, his tiny self shakes his head. Mother sits down on a bench nearby, in their rather large garden. “It’s not really a curse, or at least it didn’t start out as a curse,” Mother tells him. “It’s a spell placed on every Malfoy male heir. An old time spell, it comes with your surname…”
"Malfoy—"
, and any second now Draco will be fine too. When he forgets about this, when he stops vainly hoping not to be sick on the floor. It took quite a while to clean up the loo last time, with his spells not working. He read somewhere it’s quite common during pregnancies. But there’s at least a tiny person growing inside him, and he thinks that’s good. Fantastic even, even though the Potter side of it is quite frightening.
He's so bloody anxious all the time—whenever his shoulder brushes against someone else's in the corridors, whenever the door to his lab slides open. He's always terrified he'll turn around to find Potter staring back at him. Those unwavering green eyes are always on him, following his every movement like a Nundu tracking its prey.
He wonders if he'd have gone about things differently, if he'd known back then he'd end up up the duff. He could have cast protection charms, he guesses—and he
"It just is, okay?" Draco snaps, but then he adds hesitantly, "You didn't see what he was like during our eighth year, and what he turned into after . . . you only saw bits of it, but you didn't see him in private—the way he acted around me . . ." He shakes his head. "You couldn't have known."
"I hate you," Draco whispers, "I fucking hate you."

. He swallows, because perhaps a thank you will be worth it in the long run. Even if it’s to Potter, who he’s not too keen on thanking, considering he once slashed his chest open on a whim.
"Oh, look! There he is."
He’s not too sure the old Draco Malfoy could bear it if he knew what fate awaited him after the war. If he’d be able to stomach it. He still cringes at the idea of people seeing how far he’s fallen. If only his customers could see his true face and know exactly who he is as he spreads his legs for them—invitation obvious, provided they’ve paid—Draco doesn’t think he’d be able to live with the shame.
Pansy sits nearby all through it, apparently torn between offering encouraging smiles and trying to pat his knee whenever she can get to him. She looks about as nervous as Draco feels, and under different circumstances, Draco thinks he might have been amused—as it is though, he's mostly just grateful that she's there at all.
“Er…” Potter recoils. “Right, sure…”
"I never did like fame, Malfoy," Potter says, and of course he'd like Draco to believe that. It doesn't matter though, Draco knows better—it's not as if Potter needs to pretend to be all righteous around him.
Draco can’t remember how he got to St. Mungo’s fourth floor. He remembers almost nothing on how Potter got there. Most of what he remembers is the short conversation he half-heard while his stretcher flew through long corridors, and his own eyes swayed between now open, next second shut.
Draco glances down, nerves cracking with unease.
However, he still hasn’t gone beyond touching Potter. He’s not sure if it’s out of respect—which, apparently, he now has, developed at some mysterious point he can’t quite place in time. Or perhaps… perhaps out of shame. Shame of himself. Potter doesn’t know what he is, what he’s done, how many men have had him. He treats him like he’s some poor abused little flower.
It’s just his luck.
s reporters ever found out.
Then again, Draco had also been expecting Weaselette to be mad at him, and yet she doesn’t seem to be. “It was never meant to work,” she tells him when she drops by to leave some of Harry’s clothes. Harry, it seems, left absolutely everything behind. “He wanted a family. If I’m honest, I think I’ve had enough of that to last me several lifetimes.”
"Pilfering my drinks again?"
“Well, yes, Pans. But that gate is no door, it’s just a figurative door.”
“Did you now…” He looks up. Keeps his face in a significantly unimpressed pose, though he really is quite impressed. “Where?”
Muggles, actually. But, er, they didn't like me much."
Some of it must be still running to have even reached this point, where there’s no backwards and no off, only forwards,
"Hello," Draco greets him, pressing his lips together to hold back a smile. He can see Pansy leaning against the kitchen entrance from where he stands, blatantly eavesdropping, not even having the sense to look embarrassed.
Potter ends up rolling his eyes upon Draco’s further complaints, mostly based on Potter’s lack of shopping skills, and sometimes on, “If you’re going to buy donuts, at least you could buy the ones covered in chocolate. They taste better than these ones.”
“I suspected, of course,” he hears Pans’ saying in the background, behind all the noise, the constant buzz in his mind, behind Mother, behind everything. “Not that you ever told me. Once a Slytherin, always a Slytherin, isn’t it?”
But despite that, he does mention Potter—like today, when he comes back home in such a dreadful mood that Pansy actually asks him about it. "Merlin, what's up with you? You've been looking like a crazed Dementor all day, I swear I've been tempted to buy you a black cloak just to complete the look."
“I did. I
Potter's house isn't anything like what Draco had been expecting. It's dark, his shelves are full of old tomes and relics, and the curtains are a heavy green braid. "I wasn't expecting your place to look quite like this," he ends up saying, for lack of anything better to say.
“No, you only get to see him while I’m working and you’re not, and no one else can stay with him. That is the deal, as per the agreement with your signature on it.”
When Draco goes to Potter's house for the first time, Potter opens the door in a tight black t-shirt and a loose pair of grey jeans. "Hey," he says, smiling that smile he smiles for his friends, and Draco feels his insides tying themselves into endless knots.
"I know that, you idiot. We do work in the same building."
"No, I…" Harry pushes him back with so much strength Draco's skull collides painfully with the wall, and for a moment he's almost deafened by the persistent silence of his brain flatlining. He can't let that stop him. "Stop avoiding me," he says.
“Oh.” Yes, well, there’s that. That, and that none of his toiletries smell quite as feminine as Pansy’s, and largely that he should have seen that coming. “Are you…”
But at least they're kind to him, and they don't flinch away when his Dark Mark peeks out from under his sleeve. Draco guesses that's the best he could have hoped for, considering. Even if their speaking in hushed tones over his head is setting him a bit on edge.
"Yes, you were," Draco agrees.
“My, my. You might be turning French.”
Potter takes him to the cinema on the day after Draco's birthday. They watch
"Rub salt in the wound, why don't you?"
"Weirdly Muggle, coming from you," Potter tells him, rather out of the blue. His mouth is twitching at the corners, as if he found this whole thing hilarious for some mad reason Draco can't quite ascertain. "I'd have expected a spell before a punch to the face, to be honest. But then again, it's not like it's the first time you've done this . . ."
"Like you did?"
Draco’s still not sure if it was the nerves or his day or what, but that silly comment had him bursting into laughter.
Eventually, the mediwizards step back. They stare at him from what looks like the borderland between startled and shocked, as if he's grown a second head while they were watching, until one of them—the tall one that looks a bit like McGonagall—clears her throat.
And Draco would talk.
“Or quite a lot, rather…” Draco adds, a filthy smile on his face, and that finally goes through the cover up Potter is trying to keep. At last, Potter cracks a smile. At last, Potter touches him again, remorse left behind with Weasel’s sis and the fight.
He sighs, mumbling, "And I hate looking at him now and knowing what he meant to me back then. I just . . . I hate knowing that he's no longer that, that he'll never be that person again."
“Ugh. With his mom, again?”
“Are you okay?” Potter asks.
"Malfoy," Harry warns him, his voice tight and edgy, "let go."
“Wait.” Draco watched her as she looked through the pages. “There’s people in the background here…” She shook the passport, midair; then, she stared at him, her face a puzzle of confusion. “I don’t get it. How come they won’t move?”
"So does that mean I'm getting that date now?"
"Their art would be painted by Muggles," Draco points out, "they've never been particularly fond of magic."
"Sometimes I get so confused," Draco whispers. "You really—you look so much like you did during our eighth year, only then I remember how you made my life miserable for years and . . . and we wasted so much time . . ." He sits there, toying with his sleeve, feeling mildly terrified as he strips his soul bare. "And all the while we were secretly in love with each other. How is that not stupid?"
"Nothing," she says quickly, "nothing at all." She's quiet for a very long time—long enough that Draco has almost forgotten there was a conversation going on, lost as he was in his own mental replay of the previous night's events—before she speaks again. "It's just . . . he's always been special, hasn't he?"
"Right. Well, I guess that's one less thing we'll have to worry about now," Harry said, but his smile looked a lot like a grimace, and Draco didn't know what to do to make that go away.
The rest of this is, well… what it usually is. He’s done this so much and so often, it hardly matters anymore. Only, Potter feels good like this, and that’s relevant. It’s like their souls are somehow connected, he doesn’t know how, doesn’t know when or why. And whenever Potter makes that thin airless sound—like a gasp strangled, a moan stifled—Draco knows he wants more of it. He wants to hear it again, and louder. He wants Potter to moan, to let go. And Potter… Potter
"Positively terrible. You probably shouldn't try that on anyone else."
Oh, then. “What did I say?”
bedroom.
(On the bright side, he’s now ‘that thing’ and not ‘the Ferret’.)
letting go, he’s letting go fully, and that’s good too. That’s great, Draco thinks, because at last he feels like winning might be possible in this game of theirs, and that his luck is not all lost.
"I knew it! I knew you'd been meeting with Harry!"
He takes a breath, cut off as shallow.
“You are late,” Miller grumbles.
* * *
"I don't know, Draco." Pansy sighs. "Obviously, you must know him better than I do by now, but I keep thinking—I know I told you he'd never leave his girlfriend for you, but don't you think he might now, if only you'd tell him . . ."
Granger smiles at him. "What's it about?" she asks.
to him.”
Harry alternates between grunting and snarling at him, and Draco is afraid he might have torn a permanent gash in his tongue from biting down on it so often. It's frustrating, and from the outside they must look laughable—or pitiable, depending on the day—but still, it works. They're both apparently good enough at this job for communication to become secondary.
“Who knows, I might even take you dancing when we come back!”
Days got shorter. He literally couldn’t remember that last time he slept and, apparently, the amount of ghosts in his house just kept growing and growing.
"Merlin . . ."
He wants to be able to remember this.
“Potter, duh.” Honestly, he doesn’t even need to see her. The sheer tone of her voice is more than enough for Draco to picture her eyes rolling. “Obviously.”
"All right," he says. "Let's talk, but not here."
It goes on and on, until Draco can do nothing but push back against his tongue, because it feels wonderful, and he’s so gone, thoughts are not. All he hears is himself whimpering, needy and wanting, his mind a gale of bliss and wish and
used to have such an ample variety of topics, whereas nowadays, since the Dark Lord’s offed, it’s been drastically reduced to one subject matter:
Confusion.
Zabini, the absolute prick, looks rather pleased with himself.
“They call that the opening scene, you see. It’s the beginning of your tale, that then moves on to the...” Hermione’s hands were moving all over the place, and then something rather odd happened. Harry’s not quite sure what went wrong there. Perhaps he moved too fast, perhaps he moved too slow, but somehow when he tried to pick up his coffee, he ended up waving his arm in the air and going, “Ow!” because for some bizarre reason his Macchiato had spilled all over his hand and —“Bloody hell...”
And in Draco's dreams, he would.
’, which is clearly not ‘I love’.
"Say, what will you do once school is over?"
Potter must have brought him here, when he fell asleep after their talk… he shudders. Then, he sighs. Miller is best left in the box where forgotten memories are kept, along with Crabbe,
Draco, however, still hasn’t forgotten Potter’s anger that night, as he hasn’t forgotten the motive behind it. He’s now turned to option two: if you can’t make them yours, make them at least join you. Pansy once said,
"What's really going on, Draco? Don't think I've forgotten the great mess you managed to make of your life the last time you—"
can see them except me. Jesus.”
"So?"
"To forget?"
He should just blame his nonexistent luck.
“People would know about us.”
“Well, I wasn’t,” Draco snaps. Looking down, Draco places his hands over his growing belly.
Besides, Muggles are actually
It fits perfectly into his hand, full and heavy, and Draco finally looks down.
“No trolls, I swear. Basically cause none of that even happened.”
Draco does try to keep both of them down, but apparently one of his eyebrows has life itself: it seems to rise without previous command. Admittedly, scolding someone for not being on time—even though this one time it’s perhaps warranted—is not the best way to welcome anyone. “My apologies,” Draco says. “I just got the appointment.”
Draco searches for it on Google Maps. He’s become quite a tech-savvy, considering, and no, it’s not the magazine he’s reading. He just (some days) has tons of free time (can’t sleep at all), and this World Wide Web thing Muggles have is really rather interesting. On his screen, it shows a pub in a Muggle part of London. No wonder Draco hasn’t found him yet. He’s been looking in all the wrong places. Turns out Potter wasn’t anywhere around Diagon Alley, after all.
"If you weren't such an arse all the time," Potter muttered, "then maybe I wouldn't have had to—"
But there’s a glimpse of pain in Potter’s eyes. The shattered pieces of Draco’s heart ache burning with longing over the fling they had. They won’t let him do anything else but muttering, “Yes. All right.” After an unending sigh, he adds, “Yes, I’ll bring him back tomorrow.”
“Hm.”
He can still
, but needless to say, he doesn't get that pleasure. As soon as he opens his mouth to speak, he's—again—too busy emptying his stomach down the toilet to try to make words.
Narcissa Floos before the week is over. She talks excitedly about her life in their Tuscany villa before pausing to give Draco a thoughtful look. "So when will the wedding be? I'll be applying for a dispensation to attend, of course. Surely even those vacuous, irredeemably lazy good-for-nothings—"
"Potter." Draco hangs his scarf up on the rack before turning back around to face him. "Is that my alcohol you're drinking?"
"I might have noticed you were much busier than you used to be, so either you'd been meeting with him or you were doing something illegal," Pansy says, and she looks so smug all Draco can do is glare, frozen as he is with a chess piece in his hand. "And by the way," she adds, "if you

"Go away," Draco insists tiredly. "It's probably contagious anyway."
dancing.”
"Shut up, Pans," Draco says wearily, "just shut up."
“Did you know, Potter, that your lovely boyfriend here used to be an escort?”
Miller gives him a long, even look. “Do you?”
He doesn't quite get that. What he does get is Potter coming back a third time and a fourth, and then again and again until Draco finally loses count. Draco tells himself that's good—it
He had to be, Harry thought. He really had to be.
He cringes. Even the thought of Polyjuice makes him dizzy these days. It’s like he’s forgetting who he is, who he was,
him. Merlin, has he been blocked out?
"Yes," Draco says, even though he really means no. So far, he's only managed to decide that the first love is the only one that matters.
Draco blinks. "Well, you're rather shit at asking."
Potter looks at his face then, and they share a small smile about nothing in particular, except perhaps the fact that they’re both out-balanced here, or the fact that he’s just complimented Potter on his job, and where the hell did that come from?
Potter didn't move away.
Obviously, Draco applied. But now he thinks he should have known better.
His mother's frown deepens, and Draco is certain she must have caught on to his last ditch attempt to avoid this conversation. But thankfully, she doesn't ask again.
(It’s not Potter, damn him. He’s not masturbating to Potter. It’s rather weird how that idea just won’t stick to his mind. He thinks for a moment there that he might have been right before, while going Zen on Pans: must buy a new brain soon, the one he owns now seems to be failing miserably. Especially at this whole ‘coping with reality’ part of it.)
He braces himself for a punch that never comes.
He Apparates away.
… Draco shuts it up, shuts it down. He doesn’t yet know how right it is. “Let them dance,” he says, “we’re coming home afterwards.”
When he tries to wank himself to sleep that night, Potter laying naked next to him is all he can picture. "No, no, no," Draco whispers hysterically to himself, "bloody hell, fuck me," because he can see Potter's eyelids drooping as he pulls slowly at his cock. Because it's the memory of Potter's lips against his own what finally pushes Draco over the edge. Because he comes all over his hand while thinking about Potter, who could have had him fired earlier this month. Because, Merlin, he needs help.
“Upstairs, he just fell asleep.” Draco maneuvers around Harry, always standing in his way, the twat. “Could you perhaps not—”
. Fenrir flashes by, Severus Snape—you can’t, you can’t, Merlin, but you want to. You want to be able to do it, to be able to cast the curse, to be able to keep Mother safe for she’s done nothing but…
Once, perhaps, back in first year, when he tried to shake hands with Potter. If he recalls correctly, that didn’t exactly work out well. At least not for Draco.
“I knew it,” he says, a hint of triumph in his voice. Thrusts coming down harder, thick and steady. “I fucking knew it. A Death Eater trying to charge me for… oh God… for shagging him, a fucking Death Eater!”
quiet and definitely not thinking about
Draco mostly thinks he’s a tiny, tiny replica of himself. He didn’t even get Potter’s eyes, or his hair—on one side he’s grateful, as he’s not too sure he’d particularly enjoy the daily reminder of one of his biggest mistakes. Still, he agrees with her.
"Well, then give the boy a break," Pansy tells him, resting a hand on his shoulder. "Come on, let's go get some coffee."
Sometimes he’s afraid that Potter will rethink what they are doing here, starting a family. He’s quite scared he might send him home, carry on with his life alone. It’s pointless, it’s stupid, but Draco’s thoughts often trail over that corner. He can’t help it. He’s hoping not, mostly because he feels complete now, as he’s longed to be for years, and he’s not giving this up again. Not unless he has to.
But in the end all Potter says is, “Wait here.”
at the remains of Draco's work. "Malfoy?" He places a hand on Draco's shoulder, shaking him, not roughly, but insistently. "Draco?"
“No! He’s my son, too. At least admit that much.”
And no one.
“This?” Potter says. Draco nods, madly. He didn’t even
“I want to feel your prick so deep inside me—oh, Merlin.”
And he kept thinking that until he reached the kitchen and saw them.
. “He can’t be forgiven.”
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Are you actually jealous of him, or just trying to wind me up?”
He decides, damn him, that this is not going to affect him, that self-blame is for others and not for him, and he’s not going to blame himself over lying to Potter. Not when Potter deserves every lie Draco can make him swallow, because he’s partly at fault here, though Draco’s not too sure
“You don’t remember?” She shakes her head with a small laugh. “You honestly can’t remember.”
“Wait, does this mean, I mean, what you said before… Are you taking me as—” Draco swallows “—your date? To the gala?”
Zabini is smirking at him, the prat, like he’s the king of kings, like ruining Draco’s life is all he ever lived for. And perhaps it is.
Kreacher would probably never wear it, given what it means. But that doesn’t mean Draco could not try, does it? Not wearing something is not exactly the opposite of wanting to own it, and Kreacher clearly fits there…
"Look," Pansy says, "it's either that or you've fallen in love with cooking, and considering you burnt my omelette again, I have to say that doesn't seem very likely."
Draco's heart aches miserably with the looming threat of estrangement, and this time it's real. And when the girl Weasel slips a hand around Harry's waist, something caustic tries to claw through Draco's chest.
Pansy's head snaps to the clock, her eyes widening. "Shit. Healer Kaur is going to tear me to pieces, I keep being late to our Mind-Healing practices . . ."
Potter. He’s just some random bloke. For some absurd reason, he seems to be trying very, very hard to look just like Potter, up there, not that Draco knows why or anything. But still, he’s definitely, absolutely, categorically not Potter.
He'd walk in on him washing his hands, and Harry would look up, bemused and wary.
It was one thing to hide your plans, your intentions, your
“Thank you for, you know…” Draco pauses, gesturing towards his face, which is now healing but was once broken. He doesn’t want to say
because it's far too embarrassing and far too complicated to discuss. He's not entirely sure what he wants more: to break Potter's ridiculously straight nose, or to throw him down on the ground and have his way with him, until neither of them can do much more than moan into each other's mouths. And it's a mess. It's all a bloody mess, so he never mentions it to Pansy.
past.
It's almost as if time had stopped. Everything seems to have slowed down around them, making the silence in the room feel deafening. It's so quiet Draco can almost hear his own heart thumping away in his chest—too fast, too loud—and he has no idea how to stop this, how to make any of this better.
“The ghosts?” asked Hermione, who was now quite used to Harry talking to himself in the middle of nowhere.
"Is there a problem, Malfoy?" Robards snaps.
"But right now," Potter goes on, looking up at Draco with his lips slightly parted and an intense look in his eyes, "what I'd really like to do right now is bend you over the back of this couch. And then I'd like to fuck you, again. I'd like to—" his fingers slip into the gap between Draco's thighs. Every word out of Potter's mouth seems to drag along Draco's nerve endings, slowly, deliberately, sending warm shivers up his spine, "—make you come so hard and so often that by the end of it my name is all you can breathe—"
“Never mind. Listen, you won’t remember but we talked yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that...”
"It's not the same?"
"I bet your little swimmers could get to the moon if they wanted to," Draco says sarcastically.
Wright. Yes. Potion labeled three, and through the fog that is his mind, he mumbles, “Tell him I’ll go.”
But then again, the old Draco Malfoy stopped existing about six months back, after his release. Now he’s just a pretty face, utterly forgettable, because one too many hits did him in for good.
"Thanks," he manages, but the word burns on the way out.
*   *   *
“I swear, some days,” Pans says seriously, “you are a real blast of fun.”
"Fine," Potter holds his hands up, "fine. I'm sorry for even wondering if you were all right."
But he's never been all that great when it comes to keeping secrets from Potter.
"Well, someone has to." Potter shrugs, but his arms are stiff by his sides, and the look on his face is anything but relaxed. "It's not as if you can drink them, is it?"
“Indeed. When do I have to be there?”
“I, uh…” None of them comes out.
(It’s not like his prick feels raw from all the wanking he’s been doing. It’s not like his forearm hurts so much he’s now wanking with his left hand.)
He remembers every instant leading up to that moment with a blinding clarity, he remembers the exact second he looked into Potter's eyes and could no longer recognise the person behind them. But he doesn't know how long he stood there after Potter shut the door in his face.
“So, what, I only get to see him during the day?”
He’s actually bothered to look good this morning, wore his best clothes and everything. Yes, okay, he’s perfectly aware that it’s not exactly one of those truly expensive suits Muggles watch famous people wearing, on those tee-vee shows they have. He knows that, okay? He also knows Desmond Merrion isn’t amongst the list of designers, that it’s a suit likely made in some lost country off to the East, designed by who-knows-whom up North, and sold for a hundred quid in the nearest H&M. But at least it’s a suit. He looks good in it, and he knows he does, and anyway, it’s not like he could afford better.
"I don't think he's the new Dark Lord," he says at last. "Not really, anyway."
“Yes.”
Harry doesn't touch him.
Dumbledore falls into an unending abyss. Only, it’s not unending, it just seems unending because time has slowed. Stopped. But it has an end, and Draco can see it. He can see the ground down there.
Draco shrugs. "It's not as if you want to be a Mind-Healer though. Technically, you just need to pass."
“The war did play some games with your mind, didn’t it? Either that, or all the booze you’ve been drinking since,” she says sharply. “You’re pregnant. Remember that curse on the Malfoy line?”
“That’s all I get from you—” he shakes his head “—uninterrupted complaints, nothing but…”
Pansy stays behind after he's gone, throwing Draco worried glances until he rolls his eyes and tells her, "I'm fine, really."
. She knows how Potter makes him feel, she knows he's been trying to get over this, but she's still given Potter the chance to drop by Draco's shop whenever he wants to.
Draco shakes his head. No. Not that, not again.
Draco can’t answer that. Inside, he’s panicking slightly. He is already considering it, and that’s not exactly good news. It’s leaving another hole open—a hole his soul could accidentally slip through, a hole far too close to his heart.
"No," Draco interjects. "No, I wasn't the one who ran away. I wasn't the one who went around making promises I couldn't keep, you don't get to blame me for—"
"You don't get to…" He rakes a hand through his hair, leaving it even messier than before. "You can't just do this. I'm not your bloody plaything, Malfoy."
"I never intended to—"
“I wasn’t

"They'll keep trying though, won't they? They won't—they
Potter groans. His lips move sleekly against Draco’s, his mouth parting a bit. Draco follows suit—he wants to feel the wet smoothness of Harry’s tongue touching his—parting his own lips to allow him access. Potter’s hands, previously plastered to the table, rest now on Draco’s hips, a light touch that grows more and more firm as the kiss goes on. Draco’s hands travel up from Potter’s shoulders, into his hair. He’s quite pleased with Potter’s response, moaning his approval into his mouth.
Honestly, that’s what hurts the most. That the apology comes
“I know she
. He could always
He takes a Portkey to Chudley in the morning, to train with his team, and then Apparates to Draco's place to shag him over the sink, like he's so bloody desperate for it he can't even wait until they make it to the bedroom. He travels to France with his girlfriend and then—yet again—to Draco's place to give him a hand job, to watch as Draco's lips tighten when he shudders and as he closes his eyes for the shaky release, spilling all over his chest and into Potter's hand. How has this become his life?
Afterwards, he waits for his body to change shape. It hurts, but he’s sadly used to it. He can deal with it, and that’s that. Plus, if this doesn’t work, if Potter is somehow immune to escorts, principles with a capital P and all, he’d rather not have him knowing what Draco’s been doing these past few months. Spreading his legs for others to poke their tiny pricks in there. A cold shiver coils in his stomach—no, thanks, he’s had enough shame thrown at him so far.
“You need to have one if you want to apply for a job. It just turns out the nice lady doing mine wasn’t, how to say, extremely kind once she’d read my surname.” Yes, his visit to the Muggle’s Paperwork Department in the Ministry of Magic had not been particularly pleasant. With nerves licking his lips, Draco picks his teacup up, again. “A Squib, apparently,” he says, quite sarcastically. Also, quite aware he’s lying about his own feelings regarding Squibs. He’s been prompted to hate them—thanks ever so much, Father. He’s not sure he ever could, at least not since his own brain grew thoughts and tendons, and began walking on his own. He certainly can’t now, considering many of them live better lives than the one left for him: a loser, an underdog. Defeated. Best not to leave him air to breathe. “No wonder her lack of charm.”
—about this by now. Even though Draco really isn't. Because he promised Potter he wouldn't say a word.
Draco gets pushed back, until his knees touch the edge of a couch and they fall backwards. Or rather, he falls backwards, Potter on top of him. It’s turning Draco on quite a bit to figure out this stuff, it’s weird because he thinks he knows it. It feels like this isn’t the first time this happens, but it
"I don't know," Potter said a while later.
Potter huffs then, his face contorting into an ugly grimace before he tears his eyes from Draco's. He bolts from the room. Draco stares at his leaving back before looking down at his own hands. He's trembling. He's not exactly sure what just happened, but he's trembling, alone in his lab, with a massive hard-on. At work. And he's got no idea what to do to keep this from happening again. He's got no idea how to get it to happen again either.
He tries to Floo to Grimmauld himself. Only, the Floo is not taking him anywhere. It doesn’t
“I know.”
eating treacle tart."
They lay together in the foggy aftermath of orgasm, both of them motionless, both of them collapsed on top of Potter's shapeless couch. Draco can feel Potter's cock softening inside him, he can feel Potter's come sliding out of him drip by drip, and it's so close to perfection in every aspect Draco's almost terrified it'll have to end.

“Really?” Washing machine, huh? He’ll have to search Google for that when he gets home, his best guess is that it’s a machine that washes something—what though, he has no clue. “It must have been terrible.” He’s trying here, mostly because her face looks like it was.
Draco never sees it coming.
under her arm. She'd sit down, sipping at her takeaway coffee, and proceed to read yet another article about Perfect Potter's not so perfect love life—loudly, and complete with dramatic hand motions.
“Oh, yes. She definitely has.” But lets not forget here that that spell was cast on Potter’s orders.
, not her.”
It rang true on more levels than one.
When his eyes finally find Draco's, he turns away, shaking his head furiously at whatever the girl Weasel is saying.
Draco bites his lip. He thinks about his family, about Mother, sent to Azkaban after the war. Yes, all right, it’s not what Potter means, but he thinks he quite gets it. Weasel’s sister must as well: she was there too, she fought the Dark Lord’s army during the final battle. “I’m quite sure she cares too.”
Harry—

*   *   *
But whatever, Potter can go on with his eye-rolls.
Harry's cock twitches, hard and hot between his lips, and Draco slips a hand into his own pants. He slides up and down on Harry's cock, all the while grinding hard into his own hand, and doesn't think about how he'd like to do this again and again and again until they simply
The House of Black.
Draco somehow manages to give her a small smile, but still, she doesn't seem entirely convinced he's all right when she leaves, and he's pretty sure he knows why. She's still his flatmate, after all. He knows she's heard him rant about Potter over a dozen times, about how unbearable Potter is at work and how determined Draco is to knock that contemptuous look off Potter's face. She must know Draco is determined to do his job properly. That he's determined to prove that he's better than Potter this time around—better than Potter thinks he is, anyway.
"No, you prat," Draco yells. "You should have just asked me!"
Draco huffs. “Merlin, Potter, I’m trying to be
“To think after all these years, you still can’t keep your eyes off him…” She chanced a grin, at Draco’s expense.
Upon Potter’s clearly audible gibbering, Draco shuts him up with a, “Is it my fault you prefer to remain oblivious to current events?” Mostly because ‘I like to pretend my life is normal’ isn’t something he’d like to share. At least not with Potter.
Draco licks his lips, leaves them half-open because he can, because he wants to see what it does to Potter. Relief rushes through him when Potter swallows and looks away. Perhaps Pans was right about him. Perhaps he is into Draco, perhaps Draco can sway him. Perhaps, just perhaps, Potter is actually interested on that whole swaying thing, as long as Draco is the one doing the swaying. Wouldn’t that be nice? And easy, too; Draco by now knows quite a bit how all that works and whatnot. Plus, he wouldn’t be too opposed.
Draco's mother shakes her head, appalled. "But haven't we had enough of them, dear?"
. “You failed,” the Dark Lord says. His voice echoes in Draco’s mind—haunted, empty, cold, frozen.
"What is that supposed to mean?"
, but he means that. He doesn’t want to say
exactly are they going to solve a case without speaking?
Of course, Draco had known Potter worked at St Mungo's back when he first applied, he just hadn't expected him to

It might help, at least.
“Did it work this time?” Pansy asked when he got home that day. “Did they give you your password?”
“Indeed, as normal as it gets,” Draco answers. Useless left behind, no more failures in his life ever. Sometimes, he can feel the sun guiding their steps—forwards never backwards, forwards is the way to go. It’s just a shame his sun looks exactly like Potter: green as spring fields, pleased like a Quidditch winner and always, always brighter than light itself. But he can totally live with that. More than, even. Life is but a blessing, he’s been thinking lately.
Draco would follow him.
Pansy takes another bite of her peach. "Mm-hmm."
"What kind of—how did you even come up with that?"
But those were child dreams. He’s left childhood behind ages ago. None of what he’s had to do these past few years feels like childhood anymore. So he swallows his heart and the pride he lacks, smiles back at Potter and says, “That’s really nice of you. Thank you.”
The sheets drop off him. Potter is still covered by them. At least he hasn’t woken up, and that’s good. The air smells of morning, clean and normal and
“I should have. I promised him I would, if we won the war. I kept thinking about it, and I was planning to, but then…” She looked down at her hands, her face a dance of grievance. “I
“So, he obviously cares about you, you twat. Granted, in some bizarre manly way that involves massive frowning-slash-staring contests between you two. Still, it doesn’t take a genius to see he’s interested. Honestly, did you sleep through your trial or what?”
Harry would sit across from him, sneaking glances at Draco out of the corner of his eye—probably under the impression that he was the paragon of subtlety. He'd shift uncomfortably in his seat whenever Draco talked, and eventually excuse himself to go to the loo.
. Thinks about what Pansy said.
“Please,” she says. “Am I ever wrong? I’m guessing he’s been quite nice to you so far, taking you there and all…”
"Unlike you?" Draco says at last, and he's caught off guard when Potter laughs and rolls them over on the bed, holding Draco down.
(Yes, with a song. Only this time it’s not some violin virtuoso born in Italy, almost three centuries ago. Muggles tend to call her the Queen of Pop on the Web. He often wonders, does that have anything to do with popcorn?)
"What do you mean?"
. But he’ll get bored of you, and like it or not, he’s your best client.”
"Fair enough," he says eventually. "Though it does make me wonder what you're calling me now."
Potter shrugged again. "I like it. Besides, Winky keeps bringing them up here. I think . . . I think she misses Dobby."
Somehow, his ‘nothing’ prompts Potter to snort. “Right. That must be the reason you wound up here. Because nothing happened, and life’s just peachy.”
“Don’t, please don’t—”
The Muggles talk to him sometimes, and Draco is thankful for the cold. He's glad he can wear his coat everywhere. Disillusionment Charms only go so far, and it's draining to keep them up when his magic is as unreliable as it is these days.

Letting it wait, I reckon.” He seems wary and uncomfortable, but at least he’s here, and he’s talking to Draco, and there’s no raised voices, no threats. No spells have been thrown yet—Draco is quite glad, with the way his magic is working (or rather

"Pans!" Draco stops her. "Just . . . let it go." He sighs, stretching his arms over his head. "That's how it happened, and anyway, it's far too late to change it now."
Potter rolls up his parchment. “I have to go back home.”
Across the room, the girl Weasley would pale in shock and drop the two drinks she'd been holding. Draco would glance over, and find her holding onto a table for support.
“Is that true?” Harry asks Draco. “Is any of what he’s saying even remotely true?”
Harry sits across from him but never looks at Draco, though he does shift uncomfortably whenever Draco talks, and eventually excuses himself to go to the loo.
cross at Potter when he left.
to come back to—"
Hating him and loving him at the same time. Draco is frantic, he’s enraged, he’s agitated. He’s
"And if I say no?"
He's been dozing on and off all night, cuddled up against the cold under his blankets. He wakes up when the morning sun starts drifting through the walls, but decides he's far too tired to get up. That the shop can stay closed for a day. Just one day.
and not
“In a Muggle place?” Malfoy asked, tersely. “They’re much nicer than you lot.”
"Because this will work far better," Draco grits out. He holds his breath, counting to ten in his head as the blood-red veil of anger clouding his vision melts away. "You want it to be perfect, right? Well, this is as perfect as it gets."
The girl Weasel catches Draco staring as she brings back drinks for her friends. She narrows her eyes suspiciously, and leans in close to whisper something in Harry's ear. Harry looks up.
Draco stays silent as well. He can feel Potter's gaze on his back all through it, but he doesn't want to stir up any more trouble. Particularly not at work.
“NO!” Harry shouted. “No, it’s not understandable, it’s not even... look, I saw him two days ago—yesterday, today—whatever. I went to his shop and he was
“Like a hole within a whole,” Fred said. This time though, Harry was too slow, and he only recalled not to snort after he snorted.
Watching Zabini sidelong, Draco’s brows furrow into a frown. He’s the only one who
"Yeah. And healing . . . well, it's a way to restore some of the damage the war has done," Potter replied. "Not that it matters now. I mean, it's not like I could go to training while we're still—" he gestured awkwardly between them, "—you know."
Draco laughs sharply. He feels ridiculous. This whole thing feels ridiculous, and he's not even sure he's making sense. It's only when he looks up and Pansy is just watching him, brows furrowed, that it strikes him he might be making
For a moment there, Potter looks almost as if he'd been hexed, and Draco can't bear the injured look in his eyes, he can't bear being the one who's put it there. He can't bear how much he wants to apologise, as if all of this were his fault, how much he wants to . . . he's not even sure what he wants anymore and he
If only he could turn back time, Draco would curse himself a hundred times that day. He'd delete it from existence. Possibly curse the Firewhisky as well, just to be safe; after all, he's pretty sure that particular revelation would never have made it past his lips without it.
“A bit on the prejudiced side of the fence, isn’t he?” Draco tells Harry one day. Mostly because he’s heard those two last terms used before, usually on him, and he can’t say they came from someone who approved of queerness per se. Or of him. Or of what his job used to be.
"Really? And I suppose you would have told me then what you went to all this trouble to keep from me?"
Ignoring the bright glare coming in through the windows that’s beginning to hurt his eyes, Draco takes a few steps towards Potter. “What do you mean?”
Draco’s mouth curls into a slight grin. “We”—and that ‘we’ there feels like they’ve established something, like they’re a couple now, like Harry
"No," Draco groans, squirming closer to that finger, "
They've met for drinks a few times by now. They've talked about their jobs, Potter's new owl—who's apparently a bit of a menace—and their friends, and it's been shockingly pleasant. Pleasant enough that they've kept agreeing to do this.
“How come?”
"Seriously though, you should owl Harry," Pansy calls back from the fireplace, "he's not nearly as bad as you think."
… just yet. But Draco thinks, slightly maliciously, that he’ll make that smile grow larger in time, have Potter gift his heart to him for he deserves it, as payment for the misery Draco’s life has turned into—which is not truly Potter’s fault, but some parts of it are.
True to her word, Hermione did open the door. At least a tiny little bit. One sleepy eye blinked at him several times from behind the small chain attached to the door frame. “You,” she said. “Again. Jesus, Harry, it’s past midnight...”
Potter, too, looks rather uncomfortable, though not really as much as Draco is currently feeling.
*   *   *
, and he's not exactly sure if today is his lucky day or one of the unluckiest he's ever seen.
to ask that, when his own answer is
"It's not like that." Draco's eyes cut away from hers, resting on his hands instead. "We're not actually together. We merely—we have an arrangement of sorts."
Having made it to the Ministry and back, still in one piece in spite of all the insults thrown his way, Draco leaned back against the door for some reassurance, for some calm. Closing his eyes, he took a few deep breaths, the way Mother always told him to when he was stressed. “It’s really not a password Pans.” One, two… come on, relax already, boy. It’s not like any of them can get you here. “It doesn’t even
Potter's hands move lazily up the back of Draco's legs on the way up. His mouth is barely inches from Draco's crotch. "Because I quite liked you on your back," he says slowly, his breath ghosting hotly over the fabric on Draco's trousers as he speaks. "Because I have a proposal for you."
“Crawl,” Miller demands.
have dosed you with one, which is so far beyond credible—”
Now he's not so sure anymore. For a moment there, he's torn between feeling wrecked and elated, because surely this must mean Potter cared about him back then, that he cared about Draco at least a little—only that was then and . . . this is now, and now Potter is accusing him of breaking things off as if Draco had done that on purpose, as if Draco had
Draco bites his lip and nods. “So, the baby…”
and Draco…
"It's okay, Malfoy. Forgotten, really." Potter had looked down at his shoes then, shrugged lightly before apparently deciding to dig the knife deeper and twist it. "We just did what we had to do, right?"
Harry will lean in to kiss him, and it'll be nothing like the dreams—it'll be awkward, and somewhat uncoordinated, and Harry will laugh at him as their noses bump against each other. But it'll still be sublime.
“Yeah, maybe. Though we don’t really look...”
A shrug. “Not through me.”
Pansy would look dashing in her too short dress, and Longbottom would look… well, some people were just beyond redemption. But Draco wouldn't care, because Harry would sit beside him at the ceremony, and whisper 'so, your place or mine?' as the couple held hands and the high wizard spoke the words of the bond.
"Took you long enough," Harry would say, and he'd smile at him—his real smile, the one that was a bit crooked around the edges and made Draco's insides melt like butter—and Draco would breathe out, and for once welcome the respite of honesty.
he do would have been a much better question; it's not like they'd ever hire him in the Ministry, not after the part he'd played during the war. He might not have done much, and he guessed he could count himself lucky to have had Harry speaking up for him in the trials. And yet, he wasn't convinced that would ever be enough to erase his guilt—it certainly didn't seem enough to those still writing about him in the
for Harry—but he can't seem to find him anywhere.
He’s not too sure he wants to go back there.
"I'll hold you to that."
"It brings bad luck to its owners. The violin . . . it's been varnished with the violinmaker's wife's blood. That's supposed to be the reason it's unlucky, why it brings tragedy into everyone's lives when they own it."
Harry seized his head in both hands and kissed him.
What happens is actually close to his dreams. Williamson lands himself in St Mungo's, and Robards summons Draco in the middle of the night. Harry is right there when he arrives, standing by Robards' desk. He looks tense, and normally they wouldn't send him back into the field, but they're horribly understaffed these days, and Hermione is on maternity leave and…
He’s hoping this one in particular lasts forever.
, a bed. They talk little and shag much. It’s amazing, Draco thinks, because while the sex is breathtaking, he’s not too sure a chat would lead them anywhere useful.
But he didn’t. He didn't, he just sided with Weasel, against him.
"No, I mean, was that long ago?"
"Didn't you know?" Bones tells him eventually. "He's on sick leave. Bad case of Black Cat Flu, apparently." She grimaces. "Will probably be gone for a few days."
They'd be partners after that—both at work and under the secret softness of Draco's silk sheets. They'd work well together. Always. And Draco quite liked it like that.
"Leave, Potter." Draco takes out his wand, pointing it at Potter's chest. "And don't bother coming back, this is . . . we're done. It's over."
“You seem to be putting on weight,” Pansy insinuates, shuffling closer to him on Potter’s rather large sofa. She lies down, her head resting comfortably on Draco’s thighs.
He stares at Draco across the courtroom for a moment too long, and Draco hopes. He hands Draco back his wand with a curt, "Malfoy," and Draco nods, as if he'd been expecting this all along. As if he'd always known Harry would keep his wand for him.
. He wants to say,
"She's my friend, Potter. What did you expect?"
“You look like shit,” Draco says, even though Potter doesn’t. Even being such a mess as he is these days, Draco would still gladly lick his feet and ask for more. He’d facepalm here—over his shame, over his rather stupid feelings that refuse to go away—if it weren’t too obvious a move. He knows he’s only said that because he wants to see pain in Potter’s eyes. He wants Potter to hurt, like Draco did, for
"… am I boring you, Auror Malfoy?"
Draco began dreaming about Harry long before they got their first assignment together.
Draco shrugs. He’s not even sure what Guinness is—not to worry, he’ll search it once Potter’s gone—but it reminds him he needs to be the one in power here. Control. He doesn’t want Potter subjugated exactly, just at his mercy, so he tries, “I like Italian sparkling wine. Lambrusco tastes quite well.”
. “Morals, principles and all that bollocks. I doubt he’d ever let you starve. If only he knew what you’re doing with your life—”
Instead, Draco stands up straighter, and schools his features perfectly blank; Granger looks at him a bit too knowingly, but thankfully doesn't comment.
them.
now, it’s
reporters never rest, do they? “At least he doesn’t require the icky potion.”
Sometimes he wonders if it’s the world, asking him perhaps to choose, to act, to do something here, anything. His mind is all over the place. It’s all a mess. And he’s still not sure of what he’s chosen when he rages into Potter’s house and fucks him over the couch, but dear Merlin, it feels like
“Happy and glad are such blurry concepts.” Potter turns towards the window, arms crossed over his chest. “Maybe she does, sometimes. Maybe I am.”
Draco sits on the couch, reading
her bra, perhaps she’d like that better.
“You need to work less,” she chides him one day. “Too much potion, it will kill you.”
with you?"
"So she can parade me around town and try to marry me off to some rich pureblood or other?" Draco snorts. "I don't think so."
So Draco puts on a burst of speed and tackles him to the ground.
It never seems to matter that this is not why Draco is doing it.
They fall silent again, and the minutes pass, and Draco wonders if he could get away with telling her after all. This is Pansy; she's nothing if not tenacious. She's still glaring daggers at him over her takeaway cup, as though she thinks he's committed some sort of capital offence. Draco guesses Potter's girlfriend might agree with her, if she ever finds out—not that she
Hmm… Well, that last one might be true.
It changes nothing, though somehow it changes everything. When he leaves Scorpius there the next time he does, Potter doesn’t even try to touch him. He doesn’t even try to kiss him. He’s being too nice, too polite, too civil. Draco is missing a bit of the other Potter he’s seen, the one who did things before talking, the one who tried to kiss him out of the blue. He’s kind of wishing it would happen again. Alas, his luck is still missing.
Draco watches through the window as white swallows the roofs, buries the trees outside one by one until they no longer exist. He's always cold these days, despite his magic—cold and lonely; at least the ducks had been company, even if they couldn't talk back. His mother talks to him, but all she has to offer are vacuous statements or questions Draco doesn't want to answer.
"But it's a trap! He's doing all those . . . all those good deeds—kissing babies and learning to mend bones and Merlin knows what else—but it's only so you can't see who he's become inside."
There’s a snort. More thrusting. Draco can’t breathe with his head held down. He can’t do anything, held in place by Miller’s hands holding his own behind his back. But he’s right. Once upon a time, Draco might have said something to uphold his honour, but his honour is gone. He’s nothing but a whore. Nothing is carved in stone, he has no shield against his anger but his own shame and he’s not stupid. He knows he’s just a concept to them—to Miller—and not a person. An idea to condemn. Something to censure. He has the mark on his wrist. Draco hates it too, likely as much as they do; he loathes everything it stands for, everything it involves. If only it could be removed, Merlin, he’d give his whole world for that, but… but they—
“Oh God…” he says, his lips pressing into Draco’s throat. “Please, please keep talking…”
“What?” Harry asks, just as Draco says, “Nothing. He’s kidding, that’s all. He’s just kidding. Aren’t you, Blaise?”
The sad thing is, she’s not too wrong in her assumption. Draco will never be over him. He knows that much, just as she does.
At least not the bit about how badly he wanted to lick them. (And he did want to lick them. Still does.)
Draco nods. He gets with the rhythm there, that’s easy enough. He’s going to let this bloke grope his arse and his back while he’s thrusting away. He’s just going to keep his eyes shut, too, while he tries to get the flipping panic under control, because he’s already had a flashback today and, frankly, he could do without two. He thinks he’s getting there, somewhat nearby quiet and calm, when his whole body starts to hurt like every single bit of him is bruised.
Draco has dinner that night, his body finally remembering about real food, missed lunches taken through spells at St. Mungo’s. Once that’s done, he calls Pansy through the Floo. After serenely—as if—listening to her, “Where the hell are you?” and her over-the-top, gasp included, “I thought you were…”
“What do you know, there’s truth to some clichés,” Potter says. Then, he gives Draco a long look. “What happened to you?”
Harry rang her bell a dozen times. “Open the bloody door!” he yelled, and then rang twice more before shoving his hands under his armpits. Merlin, it was freezing out there, he thought while bouncing on his feet. And anyway, what was up with her neighbour’s flowers? Seriously, those that didn’t look rotten were falling to bits. “Hermione! For fuck’s sake...”
As if, she says. As if. “You vex me.”
—I actually liked that shirt. There was no need for you to—"
"Yes, okay." Draco sighs, looking away. "I guess I did that."
“We have tried to take it back, several times,” Mother said back then. “No one even knows how to…”
“I’m not trying to mess with your mind,” Potter tries to explain, even as Draco is backing up, trying to keep Potter’s hands off him. “I wouldn’t… look, if I could go back I’d change everything, I’d change it all. I’d do it all over again and better, but I can’t.” Of course he can’t. “All we have is now. I mean it, Draco, I really mean it, I still love you.” Draco really doesn’t want to believe that, believe any of Potter’s words. But Potter does look rather desperate, as if he’s the last string of sanity Potter’s trying to grasp, to cling to. “I love you as much as I did before.”
So he tells himself that's far better than nothing. Even if he's not entirely sure he believes it.
bloody
, that’s what Harry thinks, but he wonders, what will it be of Draco once he’s gone? He smiles, sadly. It’s funny: ages ago, they used to be the same age, far before the… accident.
"What, and leave you like this?"
be bought, when he got kicked out for having been bought. “Those days are past, Potter. I’m not your whore.” In fact he’s not anyone’s whore, not anymore.
"I could take you," Harry suggested. "I mean, it'd have to be during one of our Hogsmeade weekends, obviously, but I'm sure we could find a way to sneak out. Even with the bond still keeping us together, I'm sure we could Side-Along . . ."
"Good!" Draco snaps.
"Indeed."
Pansy is sitting next to him on the couch, playing wizard chess as they often do on rainy days, when she mentions—hesitantly—that she'll be hanging out with Potter and a few of their Healer friends the following evening. It's right then when Draco realises he might be keeping far too many secrets from her. He's been seeing Potter for over two months now—and even though he's still being careful, even though they haven't even slept in the same bed so far, there's no way he could deny that that's the way things are heading.
