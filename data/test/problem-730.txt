“Hermione” they both said together and then laughed.  When Harry heard Draco’s laughter he finally started to calm down a bit; that it, until Draco spoke again.
The story talked about how some of their friends fought against their relationship with everything they had while others embraced the men and encouraged them.  It spoke of how they each seemed to take turns fighting against the attraction toward each other – the brunette more so than the blonde.  The author described the attraction as something that was completely beyond either man’s control.  No matter how long and hard they fought it – the two always came back to each other in the end.  They loved each other fiercely – even when neither would admit it to others.  The brunette wanted to keep such things on a low profile.  The fewer people that knew about his feelings toward the blonde the better off he was.
“Draco.” Harry grabbed his boyfriend’s cheeks and leaned up to kiss him. “You’re amazing. And I love you.”
After a moment, a hand gently rested on his arm. Harry opened his eyes and saw Draco, the real  Draco, kneeling in front of him with an expression of blatant fear. “Dr—Draco?” Harry hiccupped. He looked around and saw the entire household was standing around him with matching expressions to Draco’s. “I—you—you were—I—” He took a series of shuddery breaths, and Draco came to sit next to him on the floor. Harry’s hand throbbed, and he pulled it from his hair to look at it. It was bleeding from a large gash on his palm, and small pieces of glass were embedded in his skin. He gasped in pain and Draco cradled the hand in his own, warm palms, and Harry allowed Mrs. Weasley to perform a Healing spell on it. The glass removed itself from his hand and the slice stitched itself back together. It left a thin scar, but Harry didn’t care about that.
“Harry, let me talk,” Draco said softly, cradling Harry's face in his hands and turning it to make Harry look at him. “I chose not to take the Mark because I promised to never hurt you, not because you asked me to not take it. I chose because I'm not going to be on the losing side of a war where the leader wants to kill you. I love you, you blind idiot, and I'm doing this
it was my birthday 2 days ago and I have been very busy, that's why I'm a bit late with an update, but here you go
“How did you learn to do that?” he whispered. Harry rolled his eyes and placed a flat palm on Draco’s lower back, pulling him closer.
Lunch passed normally enough, if just a bit more tense than usual, but Harry suspected that was mostly because the Weasleys didn't know what to talk to Draco about.
“I mean, I definitely could see myself doing so,” he replied honestly. “I haven't said it yet, but… I really want to mean it when I do.” He looked up at Ron from where he sat on the floor by Hermione’s now-wrapped gift. “You have no idea who he really is, Ron.”
“I can feel...more. Just—give me a minute.” His mouth went dry and he pushed himself slightly off, lowering back down. Harry was grateful for the hands that gripped his hips to help him.
Draco smirked. “Are you sure? I would think you’re the one who wants to see me naked most of all, considering that we’re routinely fucking.” Harry felt his cheeks warm.
“You can be vocal, Harry,” Hannah said innocently. He fought to open his eyes and glared at her. Hannah shrugged and mumbled, “or not…”
“Poncy git,” Harry muttered to himself. He scowled at Malfoy and flipped him an annoyed finger one last time before he set the parchment under his untouched plate.
“No, I had no idea!” he replied frantically. “If I did, I would have—” He made a wild gesture towards his lower half. Draco started rambling off in rapid, panicked French that left Harry's head spinning with confusion.
“It’s Christmas! Mum wants pictures, she said to wake you up. I’ve already got ‘Mione up, everyone else is downstairs,” Ron hissed. “Get up.”
“Where are we going?” he asked. Draco bit his lip, still refusing to answer the question. “You know, unless you’re planning on killing me or kidnapping me, I’m not going to run away.”
“Thank you. Mr. Malfoy, please make sure to take Mr. Potter back to the common room and that he gets a warm cup of tea. Winky?” A house elf popped up next to the old man. “Please get Mr. Potter here a tea, and maybe something to balance his blood pressure.”
“Come in,” Harry said, “please?” Draco walked in and stepped toward him. “Draco, I’m so sorry about everything that I said. I heard a lot of half-sentences and I just… filled in the blanks on my own with the worst-case scenario without asking you what any of it meant.” Draco sat on the bed next to him.
“Ooh, I got a possessive one,” Harry hummed. “I like it.” He pecked Draco on the lips. “God, you’re so…” He trailed off and smiled at Draco.
“Pfft. Not now. Ask me after that truth or dare game Davis was telling me about tomorrow.” Harry got up and poked Draco in the chest before walking out into the common room to strike up a conversation about Dung Bombs with George, who was lounging on a couch in front of the fireplace.
“That's true.” Harry sighed when he tucked himself back into Draco's embrace. “How do you think I'd look with longer hair?” Draco looked down at him thoughtfully.
“Do you understand? I don't want him near you,” Draco ordered lowly. Harry swallowed and nodded. Draco dropped a soft kiss against Harry's lips, hands moving back up to cradle his face. Harry grabbed one of Draco's hands and kissed his knuckles, lips brushing the Malfoy crest ring that rested on his left ring finger.
“Two proposals in one day?” he hummed. “That's ambitious of you.” He frowned. “I don't have a chain to put this on.” Draco rolled up his sleeve and unwrapped a thin, long leather cord that was wound around his wrist. He took his ring from Harry, slipping it onto the cord.
“Something like that would be in the Restricted Section,” Harry said. “I can give you my Cloak.” Draco took the parchment off the wall and rolled it up. He stuck it in his bag and kissed Harry firmly.
“I can't kiss my boyfriend when I want to?” Harry countered. Draco sat up on his knees in between Harry's legs.
“Nothing's ever my fault, Harry,” Draco joked, “I'm a Malfoy, and Malfoys are always perfect. And honestly, I was about ready to cry when I landed on the ground. That hurt.”
“We walked to an empty compartment. We weren't gone that long,” Harry replied. “I hate it when you call him that.”
“I've—I've been okay,” she stuttered quietly. “Listen, I'm really—really sorry about my—about how I reacted—when I saw you and—and Malfoy, I was just shocked.”
They set a steady pace, slow and agonizing but still incredible, Harry’s cock slapping lightly against Draco’s belly. Harry kept eye contact the entire time. Draco ran a thumb along Harry’s lower lip and Harry opened his mouth to let it slip in.
“Y—yeah, I’m going to go,” Harry murmured. “I’ll see you both soon.” He walked toward the fireplace and grabbed a handful of Floo powder. “The Weasleys are having a huge dinner on New Years’ Eve. You both should come. Remus, too,” he said before stepping into the fireplace.
“I meant it,” Draco murmured. Harry hummed in curiosity. “When I said… I would go out… with you,” he clarified, cheeks pink. Harry gave him a little smile. “But I didn’t really… ask. I just… sort of… demanded it.”
“That comment didn’t go unnoticed, Harry,” Hermione said, “and actually, I think this could be a good way for the rest of us to get to know Malfoy a bit better.”
“Mm. That I am,” Draco agreed, kissing Harry's cheek. “Come on, let's go back downstairs.” They stood up and walked down the stairs. Harry watched Draco put the Polaroid photo of Harry blushing and turning his head from the camera in his coat pocket.
Sirius jumped up from the couch when Ron stepped through, and Ron startled back at the wand pointed in his face. Sirius sighed and dropped his wand. “What the hell are you doing here, Ron? It’s late.”
Harry turned around and Draco licked him clean, afterward helping pull his trousers up and look at least half-decent. Harry immediately dropped to his knees and urged Draco to stand. He kissed the front of Draco’s trousers before pulling them down.
“You never know, Malfoy,” he mused with a grin. Draco scrunched up his nose and grabbed Harry's hand, pulling him outside and away for a moment. “Draco?”
hahhah sorry y’all i said i’d give this chapter to you guys so long ago but i’ve been procrastinating positing :,) so i’m sorry! and i’m posting it from my phone so if there’s any spelling or other errors i’ll go in and correct em, just drop a comment :) hope you enjoy ! i was on the fence about posting this chapter but i think i like it.
“Prongslet? I'm upstairs! Come on up!” Harry tread up the staircase of Number 12 Grimmauld Place and was met with a bone-crushing hug from Sirius when he turned a corner.
“Happy New Year's, you dork,” Draco murmured. “Love you. Now go to bed.” Harry hummed and returned his head to Draco's neck.
“What happened?” Ron asked. Harry recalled the interaction exactly how it was, crying turned to sobbing at the end. “Harry… every couple fights. You're going to be okay, mate. You just heard some stuff without context, and if I heard what you did I would think the same thing.” Harry nodded. “Just give Malfoy the rest of the day and then maybe write him a letter later tonight.” Harry nodded again. “I'm going to go get you some tea, okay? I'll bring Hermione up here and we'll take your mind off it. Just lie down in bed, yeah?”
Harry kissed him. “I know. Here,” he handed Draco the silver-wrapped package. Draco rose an elegantly groomed eyebrow and opened it slowly, carefully peeling the packaging where it was taped—the Muggle way, something Harry never got out of habit—and unfolding the edges painfully slow. Harry started to get anxious because of it.
“Hey, what's wrong?” Draco called over the wind. He walked toward Harry and wiped Harry's cheeks with warm palms against a wind-frozen face. It was only then that Harry realized he had been crying. Harry fell onto Draco's chest and sniffled. “Harry, what's happened?”
“He said you were dry heaving in your sleep and had been crying all night,” Draco said. “That you felt terrible.” Harry hugged him and buried his face in Draco’s neck.
“You can't control other people, love,” Draco murmured into Harry's hair, arms tightening around his back. “Je promets tout ira bien. I promise everything will be okay.”
“Is there anywhere we can talk privately?” Draco asked. “I need to speak to you alone.” Harry swallowed nervously.
“Harry… fuck, so close,” Draco breathed. “Come for me, baby.” He nipped down Harry's throat and ear. “Come on.”
Harry experimentally kissed the spot right above the start of Draco's collarbone again. Draco let out a shaky breath. “Harry.”
“We'll be there, Prongslet,” Sirius confirmed. Harry smiled at them before throwing the Floo powder down and calling out the name of the Burrow.
“Please, just… prove me wrong. Prove to me that the worst case scenario that is running through my head right now is not what's going on,” Harry pleaded. “Because what I heard makes it sound like you're using me to play some sort of angle. Am I overwhelming to you? Do I… do I stress you out? Did you lie to me when you said you wouldn’t be taking the Dark Mark?”
Draco lifted a shoulder in an elegant shrug before dropping it again. “Maybe. It's just difficult. I've grown up with all of these traditions, and beliefs. To realize that they're wrong, that my whole upbringing has been… medieval, and that what mum and dad said really means nothing, that those laws and beliefs don't apply to the modern world. It's a lot to take in. It's a lot to unlearn everything. And then to relearn it all in another light…”
They fell onto the bed next to each other, breathing heavily and coming down from the post-orgasmic high. Harry felt come running down the curve of his arse and looked over to see Draco handing him his wand. They cast cleaning charms on themselves and Harry undid the locking and silencing charms on the room and bed, afterward setting his wand somewhere on a nightstand. Draco grabbed his chin lightly and turned Harry’s face toward himself. Harry smiled into the offered kiss and felt Draco smile as well.
“Since when do you care?” he asked quietly. Draco walked over to Harry’s bed and stood at the end of it.
Hannah sighed solemnly. “You can stop now, I suppose,” she said. Draco pulled back but didn’t move from Harry’s lap. Harry removed his hands from Draco’s pockets and they pulled their shirts back on.
“So, everyone,” Sirius announced, “we have a bit of news.” Remus grabbed his hand and smiled at the group. “I'm pregnant.”
“Oh, blimey, you do make a tiny noise when you yawn. It’s like a little squeak,” Ron shivered dramatically, and Harry shoved his shoulder.
“You too.” Draco stood and hugged Harry tightly. “Goodnight.” Harry kissed the nearest place he could, and that happened to be Draco's stomach. “Now go.”
“Yes,” he groaned. “Fuck—” He cried in anguish when a hand wrapped around the base of his cock and refused to let him come. “No,” he moaned, “Draco!”
Fred had gotten Hermione a video camera, “to document everything that you want to remember.” In turn, she and Harry had split the cost of one hundred and fifty WWW logo boxes and bags each for the twins' shop. She had surprisingly utilized her old connection with Viktor Krum to call in a favor to cut a deal with a Wizarding logo company. (Also, Hermione might have mentioned Harry's name in conversation and Harry might have faked searching for her and walking inside the store to look for her as proof. But they didn't tell the Weasleys that.)
“I’m not mad, Harry,” Draco assured him. Harry smiled up at his boyfriend. “Can someone tell Mrs. Weasley that I’m putting him in bed?”
After she was gone, Harry set to work wrapping her gift in shiny, holographic wrapping paper with small pictures of Wizarding mistletoe growing from random places.
“This is Malfoy we're talking about! He's too posh to put something like that on his skin!” Ron scoffed.
“It’s just lightning.” He grabbed Draco by the cheeks and pulled him down for a kiss. Draco rested his hands on Harry’s arse, squeezing lightly, and Harry sighed softly into his mouth. Draco started playfully biting Harry’s neck, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist. Harry rolled his head back to laugh and to give Draco more access. He momentarily opened his eyes and froze at the shocked faces of Draco’s parents staring at them from under the covered area of the courtyard. “Draco,” he said, eyes wide. Draco hummed and hugged him tighter. “Draco, your parents are here.”
“I’m glad you’re so eager, Potter,” he hummed in response. “It’s called a secret.” Harry frowned slightly. “And we’re not doing anything, really.”
“Harry, are you drunk?” Draco asked softly. He stood up, catching Harry by the arms when he tried to do the same and fell backward.
“But the palace has no wards… my parents wouldn’t know. Since it’s mostly Muggle and a tourist attraction, there’s no point because they’d be going off constantly,” Draco said reasonably.
“You two will be okay, Harry,” Hermione soothed, “everybody fights. Ron's parents fight, my parents fight, I'm sure your parents fought. No one's perfect.”
He also knew that Draco was very well endowed. Harry had a difficult time taking it into his mouth, he had no idea how he was going to take it up his arse.
Harry moaned at the feeling of Draco’s cock in his mouth, heavy on his tongue, but he refrained from moving. He looked up at Draco expectantly, and when Draco just looked at him with a confused frown, Harry pulled his hips forward before pushing them back again.
He didn’t even feel like reading the book he has brought with him. Instead he just closed his eyes, resting head against the edge of the bath, letting his mind empty and just relax.
“They don’t hate you. No one hates you. They are really nice, good people, and they won’t mind friend of ours coming for dinner and staying over.”
After Harry summoned Kreacher to have him keep an eye on Draco, he left. It was strange to stay in someone else’s house, not exactly sure when they would be back, and knowing you
The evening was cool and nice and the feeling of the cool marble railing under his hands did help a little bit. Draco knew he shouldn’t be so affected by Harry being here, nor Weasleys, but he couldn’t help it. It was still so fresh and painful. Manor, be it prison it was, was his sacred haven, hidden away from anyone. He was safe here. But it was ruined. All the people that wished him the worst, and the person that hurt him the most, were there, ruining it all.
Draco’s head snapped up to him. He looked at him with wide eyes. For a moment he thought he was hearing wrong or that Blaise misspoke. But the other didn’t take it back.
“Shh,” he whispered, kissing Harry’s lips softly. “It doesn’t matter, Harry. We don’t know what will happen in a day, or a week, or a year. As far as I am concerned I may be already disinherited. My mother didn’t send me a shortest note since I came here.”
His voice was trembling terribly, and so were his hands. He could even feel his insides twitching. It was just disastrous. Harry, so close to him, demanding that he read him. As if.
He looked up from his parchment, looking at her for a moment, thinking he heard wrong. But she gave no indignation that she didn’t say exactly what she did. She was looking at him, waiting for an reaction.
Draco took the long bath, in the beautiful bathroom with huge bathtub and enchanted faucet with choice of five different scented and colored waters – he went for cinnamoned apples in pink color. He eventually slipped into his pajamas set, the long-sleeved, flannel ones with turnips on them, that he got from Luna for  his birthday, and he made himself comfortable in the bed with Salem on his side. When he finally finished the book he had picked at what once was a library, he let the fact how weird it all was let sink in. He was in Harry’s house, that was still in construction and he supposed barely anyone was there before him, he took a bath in Harry’s private bathroom and was now laying in his bed, maybe even on his side if he had such, reading book, as if it was nothing.
“Looking for someone?” Blaise’s voice brought him back to earth before he could decide to flee the party. “Come, dance with me.”
Harry walked him all the way to the library, before stealing quick kiss and leaving to the common room.
“She is asking how are you if we could send her a scan photo. And she would like to come for dinner,” Andromeda added, unsure.
Andromeda and Teddy left shortly after lunch, and he got ready to pick up groceries. He got accustomed to the idea that at this point everyone in the village took him for a girl with a strange name. He didn’t mind one bit. The only thing that played on his nerves was pitiful looks and whispers. After all, he was young and alone, living with his aunt, and pregnant on top of that. It added up to a picture worth of gossiping.
was the one to suggest breaking up in first place. And now he is acting as I hurt him, as if I just dumped him out of blue. And it is just so annoying because all of the sudden I don’t have friends. Harry says he wants to stay out of this, but obviously Ron is his best friend and they share a dorm, and it isn’t like Ron did something to him, so it just happens naturally. And Ginny … I don’t think I ever liked her too much, but now she is just acting like Ron. If not worse than him.”
“Of course. I tell you what, we spend at the zoo as much time as you want and if we still have time we will go to the cinema or wherever else, okay?”
“But it does. You know it does. You know how people at school look at me. Besides I know about Ron’s brother. It’s their second Christmas without him, and I don’t think they would be really comfortable with Death Eater’s son at their table. No matter what they said.”
“Can I?” Harry whispered, breaking the kiss. It took him a moment to realize that brown-haired man’s hand was on his shirt, fingers wrapped around the small button.
But Hermione didn’t even heard him. As a last resort the redhead looked at him, a bit hesitant even. They still weren’t on the best terms. They barely ever met, and if, they never talked. Even today, Draco spoke barely few sentences. He knew he was sort of fifth-wheeling in the friends group, so he wanted to keep the low profile.
He opened his mouth to say it was Carrow’s doing, but he quickly closed them, clenching them tightly. He knew it would only get worse if he told anyone, if he made a fuss about it. So, he couldn’t do it. He would rather never leave his room. It wasn’t like he had to bear with it much longer. It was February already. Just few more months and he would be back in the safety of his home.
He would be lying if he said that coming back home wasn’t the most nerve-wracking thing he has done in his life. The emotions that wouldn’t leave him the whole train ride home were just awful. He almost wanted to open the window, and just jump out once the train found its way on the bridge.
Harry moved closer to him and the next moment, their lips were joined together, moving slowly and shily, barely touching in the beginning. Harry’s hand rested on his cheek and his travelled to wrap around Harry’s wrist, as if he could keep it there longer. Draco was never kissed before, but he thought it to be the most amazing and romantic kiss imaginable. It was slow and sweet, lips moving together in sync, brushing against each other with more confidence after few passing moments. He felt closer to Harry than he ever did, in the way he always wanted to. It was like a comfort blanket that  someone laid on him suddenly. He didn’t feel sad or unhappy. In fact, he didn’t feel anything other than excruciating love. His heart was beating fast and he felt the most pleasant sort of warmness in his chest and limbs, rush of blood the audible only thing in his ears.
“That’s a very nice scarf you got,” Harry said, after he spoke the password and they stepped into the staircase.
Guess who decided to show up after weeks? I am not sure if I am back for good because it is tricky to know, but I finally managed to put something up, even though I am not sure how to feel about this chapter. It feels messy and that I could do better and as much as I wanted to wait and rewrite it, possibly, I don't want to wait anymore, because I miss this story. So, here is another chapter with some exciting news and some drama. I hope you liked it!
Harry rolled his eyes at her words before he took to walk down the path, fiercely stuffing hand in his pocket, the other rocking the basket. They both followed him.
“Draco,” Harry started, looking at him carefully. “I’m …. I’m sorry how things have turned out. I really want to … us … crap. All I’m trying to say is…”
Blaise was one of these few people he didn’t want to lie to, but there was no way of telling him the truth. Blaise was an honorable pureblood. He would no doubt turn his back on Draco too, once he knows.
She presented him with an envelope that already has been opened. He took the parchment out of it. It was a very simple invitation. Wedding invitation as he read. To Charlie Weasley and  Blyth Thompson’s, to be exact. It was to be held at the Burrow on 5
He walked to Blaise, meeting him in a midway. He grew shy suddenly, not really sure how to act, but it was quickly dismissed as the other wrapped arms around him in a tight hug.
his father and work some job he loved, like architecture design or whatever else that involved drawing as a job. But one couldn’t have simple pleasure of dreams being fulfilled.
He still acted as if she said something else and he was misunderstanding. But he surely wasn’t. She really said
He could feel the tension in the dining room, maybe see it if he tried hard enough. But nothing happened yet. He was pushing around his eggs on the plate, not feeling one bit hungry, still vividly remembering the morning sickness that woke him up at five, and wouldn’t go away for hours. His mother was sitting on the opposite side of him, drinking her morning tea and looking through the Daily Prophet with such a power that she didn’t need words.
It wasn’t much, nothing at all, as a matter of fact, but he didn’t have anything more. Ignoring Salem, that was asking for his attention, he took a suitcase out of his wardrobe, and started filling it with as many clothes as he could. He tried his best to perform an enlarging spell on his trunk but it only send his clothes flying. When he was all ready, trunk packed, money safely pocketed, he sat for a moment, thinking what exactly was his plan. He considered going with his mother and fleeing when she wasn’t looking, but that meant no clothes and no personal belonging, that he would highly appreciate having.
“You fell down the stairs and hit your head pretty bad. I was meaning to ask you, Mr. Malfoy. Are you sure there was no one else there?”
Draco rested his head against the edge of the bath, closing his eyes and enjoying his moment of rest. He really adored such moments. It was as if everything slowed down, and for once he felt, that he really deserved it.
The way Blaise looked at him so peaceful and unbothered as if he wasn’t just proposing to change their whole lives, almost startled him. Even more than other’s words. He couldn’t imagine it. He liked Blaise, and he knew he didn’t have anything bad on his mind. He wanted to help if anything. And he would reconsider it if it wasn’t for his love towards Harry, and for the need to be independent. He wasn’t going to marry Blaise just because he was offering nice things. Maybe that day when he found out, or when he run away from the house he would just take the offer, not thinking about it, but not anymore. If he and Harry weren’t bound to happen, if they were to go their separate ways, or co-parent (in case he finally got guts to tell Harry), he wasn’t going to jump onto Blaise’s offer. He wanted to be loved and to love. He didn’t want a marriage just because Blaise was a nice man from a good, pureblood family. If he had to, he would be working his ass of himself. Hell, he wanted to do that either way. No matter if he was to marry the love of his life or be all alone with the baby.
Harry smiled as if he was really happy that he was staying. It felt way too nice, thinking that it might be the case.
The look Harry gave him, told him he had overshared and it wasn’t necessary to talk about his father and what controlling freak he was. But it was sort of look that was clear to be of concern and sorrow, that were only proved by a soft hug that he received from Harry.
Another Sunday spent entirely in the library, revising and finishing any leftover homework and extra credits. Nothing new, except for the fact that usually Harry wasn't around. Most of the weekends, save for few picnics and that amazing night few weeks back, Harry was out and about with Weasley and the Weaselette. So, to have him come over this early in the afternoon felt like a treat. Which really shouldn't, but Draco has long come to accepting the little things life allowed him to have. Sharing Harry was one of them.
“You are right. And I will be fine. Although it will be hard. I suppose I will spend more time with you, here. I will be public enemy number one starting today’s evening.”
. And even if he could overcome the stigma of his name, of his family, over the fact that he would be ruining Harry’s life, there was Ginny that made him terrified. He was being a bit unreasonable, looking at how they all were adults, but he didn’t dare take anything for granted. And finally, he had to keep in mind the fact that Harry, well, betrayed him. He had told his girlfriend all about it, and admitted that it was just a bit of an experimentation, just to have some fun, probably.
It was very pleasant day, and the last thing Draco needed was worrying about them. Especially Ginny. He didn't like Hermione bringing them up, but he knew she was oblivious to why he wouldn't like that.
He refused to carry Salem a while ago, and the cat took it surprisingly well, just following him patiently. But as he was about to open the gate to his aunt’s house, Salem meowed loudly and bit on his pant, not letting him go. He couldn’t understand the behavior until his hand inched to the handle and he could just feel the tingles of magic. He figured there was some sort of the ward, and that’s why the cat didn’t let him even touch it.
“One is from Hermione, one is from me. Also, thank you for your present. I wouldn’t think you remembered.”
He laid there for a long time, trying to put his mind in order and overthinking the whole day in and out, before he heard the stairs and then floor outside creaking. Soon the door opened slowly and Harry walked in. He looked tired and his hair were disheveled, eyes brimmed red and sleepy. Draco sat down , suddenly self-conscious and embarrassed that he was caught in Harry’s bed as if it was his own.
He moved closer to where Ron has set the chess board, and they started – him being the black ones as he picked so. He must have admit that he did take Weasley for granted and did not expect that he would be such a good opponent. Not very far in, once it was sure that it would be a long game, Harry lazily moved to his side and lifted to rest on his elbow, to have a better look at the chess board. What made his head and upper body way too close to Draco, and gave him far too good angle to watch his face and curly hair.
“Yes. I know, my house is no huge, fancy mansion or a castle, and I have whole of one room to offer, but it’s a very nice room. Also, I have a nice bathroom, hot water and big bathtub, not to brag. There is plenty of books in one of the rooms too. So, I suppose you have just enough ways to entertain yourself before I’m back. And Kreacher will be at your demand.”
He felt his cheeks heating. He dropped his head, hair covering his face. He forgot to hide his essay. Hermione already knew, but no one else did.
On the Sunday just a week later Hermione dragged him out of the library before the lunchtime, and they met Harry outside the castle. It was another warm day, even warmer that the previous one, though it was for sure one of the last days before heavy rains and storm would hit them.
It was like having someone drill a hole right in the middle of his chest and filled it with black hole of some sort. He was so extremely lonely, sad and lost that it was unspeakable. It was easy to say he never felt this way before. When he was left for his own at the Manor or during the war, he didn’t have such an existential matters on his hands and he didn’t suffer the loss of his loved ones.
Harry shifted, lifting Draco’s chin to look at his face. The expression of deep concern was painted all over his handsome face.
He was in the middle of contemplating what he shall name as to why he couldn’t make it to the dinner, instead of locking himself in the bedroom and pretending he didn’t exist, when the noise of Floo interrupted. He figured it was just Andromeda and Teddy back, and he didn’t make much of it other than starting to put the plates on the round table. It was only when Salem stopped eating to jump off the counter and run to investigate in the alert, that made him think it wasn’t Andromeda. And the only people that all the wards were open to were him and…
Hermione has come with them to have brunch this Saturday noon, but she quickly left, explaining that she haven’t done her homework. Ron and Ginny were having a Quidditch practice, and Luna didn’t want to come, saying she had to write an article on which Neville was helping her.
“Where have you been? I really needed cuddles,” he said quietly, receiving a meow in response. As if he spoke cat.
He found that now it was even harder to form any sort of words. He got better at it when it was Harry around. He didn’t have to try so hard and words were just flowing with some difficulty. But now, as Harry was in somehow close proximity, while he was naked, and presumably so was Harry, made him just speechless.
“So, we thought we could have brunch at the lake. It is the only chance after all. Ron and Ginny will stop fussing eventually.”
He looked down at his plate and started eating, but he couldn’t stop thinking about Harry’s plans. Why was he doing this? Inviting him to Weasley’s was generous enough, and now spending a day together in London? It was another level. And he couldn’t stop wondering why exactly Harry wanted to do it. He could do this with his
Draco laid on his side, eyes fixed on Harry’s face still, Salem moving to sit at the edge of the balcony. It hurt him to see him like that. Harry went through a lot in his life, things that were known by public were harsh enough, not to mention bits and pieces that Draco heard. Harry deserved to be happy. He didn’t deserve some mediocre relationship, didn’t deserve being left alone to struggle in silence.
He didn’t even care for Harry sharing the bath anymore, too taken in by the notes. They were sitting in considerable distance from each other, both knowing it was better this way. Since they first shared a bath, it happened few more times, most of them after they ‘got together’
“We can go. We don’t need to be at the Burrow till four, so we have plenty of times. I was thinking we could go see a movie and then to the zoo? Or maybe oceanarium. Unless you want to do something else. Or just stay here. That’s alright too…” Harry visibly flushed, retreating a bit. If Draco knew better he would think that he got embarrassed for some reason.
His inner turmoil distracted him to the point that chess became secondary task, and he did lose. Not on purpose though.
I love this chapter. But at this point I have been working so many hours straight on it, that it starts to look a bit strange. So, I hope it isn't strange one bit and just as lovely as I think! Now, please enjoy Christmasy chapter at the begining of June!
Somewhere halfway through Hermione’s rant of why it would be beneficial if the law was passed, Ron passed their booth, holding hands with Katie Bell. He didn’t say a word, only sat few tables away, but even Draco could see his ‘sneaky’ glances.
“You will go first, okay? Just so I am sure you said proper place. House Elf know you are coming, so don’t be surprise if Kreacher comes to assault you with tea and refreshments. He is sort of weird. Long story. And let me take your bag and Salem. I will make sure they get there safely.”
“It’s … It’s very sweet, Harry. Very nice thing of you to say, but it’s just how it is. Besides, it isn’t like I have any better options. We already established what people think of me. I will never find a job, I will never be able to support myself, and my parents will cut me off the minute I decide to walk away from the life they prepared for me…”
Draco stood in front of a large mirror, his heart fluttering slightly, as he was taking in his own reflection. The clothes that his mother ordered from the tailor didn’t suit him at all. The pants wouldn’t close all the way up and the thin fabric of white silk was showing off his growing belly more than it was visible when he was naked. There was no way of denying what was going on under these clothes, so there was no way of wearing them.
“I get it, Harry. You don’t have to explain. And I don’t think you should beat yourself up about it. Have you two talked it out eventually?”
“Not really. I had an argue with Ginny, Ron and Hermione were fighting the whole evening and Molly kind of broke down in the end. But I got to see Teddy and spend time with him, so that was nice. Turns out he adores dragons all of the sudden, so your gift was a win. He didn’t even bother opening mine. He fell asleep with the plushy you got him. Well played, Draco, well played. Andromeda sends her regards and wishes Merry Christmas and good New Year and Hermione got you a present.”
He sink deeper in the milky, pink water that smelled of roses and lemons, letting out a heavy sight. He still had to properly thank Hermione for letting him know about this place. It was just splendid, even though he didn’t get to use it too often. It was way too far from the dungeons and the last thing he wanted to do after a long day was to walk kilometers just to get to the bathroom, at risk of getting caught. But it was always so worth the fuss.
“I canceled my lunch plans to come to see you. I know, I know, a perfect gentleman would make an appointment for a lunch date weeks prior, but I hope it isn’t a big bother to you? Otherwise, I shall leave and owl you about the more suitable date.”
His heart squeezed painfully at Harry’s words and his troubled expression. There was also a visible pant in his green eyes.
He felt a wave of white lightheadedness wash over him. If his aunt was out for days, there was no telling when she would be coming back. It could be a day as well as weeks. And he had no other option than this. To that, there was nothing but four Galleons left in his pocket, and sickness mixed with hunger in his stomach. He had no way of contacting Andromeda, as his wand didn’t even work.
Through the rest of the afternoon spent at The Three Broomsticks, he kept stealing glances at Harry, and couple of times their eyes meet, sending a warm sensation into his chest. He tried his best not to be obvious, but he couldn’t help himself. He tried his best to block out the fact that Harry was in the middle of sort-of double date, which he was finding rather hard. The redhead was constantly glued to his side, sometimes even moving almost to lay on him, which he found weird and way too PDA. It sting him very much. He knew he had no rights to be jealous, but he couldn’t stop that burning hurt spreading in his chest.
Harry smiled softly, but sat down without another word. He sat next to him, petting Salem that was still softly rubbing against his face and neck with its small head.
Okay, enough with the rant because I got carried away. I just wanted to say again a big THANK YOU for waiting and sending me good word. Also wanted to brag that I got three tattoos and four plant children while I was gone, which indicates just how much time passed.
He put on some makeup, which he didn’t do too often. Rarely as a matter of fact. But Blaise was right. He looked as if he was sick.
“It’s alright. I came to terms with it, I guess. It’s just … what war is. No matter how stupid and pointless the war might be, it is what it is. It just take people away. And I happened to be one of the main concerns of this war, so it is only natural that all this things happened.”
Luna was quick to start talking about the most intriguing article from her magazine, as Hermione seemed even more ready to drop dead at the spot. Neville, on the other hand, was listening attentively, looking at the blood with love-struck eyes, that Draco found deeply adorable. He knew his cousin was more than oblivious, and it would be beneficial to point that out to her, but he didn’t want to mingle in other people’s affairs.
“It is, because Sirius left me it. But you are a Black, even though partially. And this house lives its own life. If you only knew what it took to get rid of all the awful portraits, especially the one of Sirius’s mother. It’s as if I shouldn’t be living here.”
“Potions, Herbology, Alchemy, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Care for Magical Creatures, Arithmancy and Ancient Runes.”
. That Harry didn’t have to fight his demons alone. That he didn’t have to care about Ginny, about Weasleys. That
There was a heavy silence between them as Harry looked at the tapestry. Then he pointed at burned out place next to his mother and aunt. Andromeda Black.
He took all the potions that were handed to him, and all tasted far worse than he had expected. He felt slightly better almost immediately so he was quick to forget the awful taste.
They lunch lasted for almost two hours, and he spotted that his friends already left, leaving Ginny and Harry alone at the box, sitting very close, Ginny whispering something to Harry’s ear as he had his eyes lowered. He hated the sting of jealousy in his chest he felt when looking at them.
"Aren't you two hungry?" Harry said. "You have been sitting here since the morning and it's almost three."
He snatched the silk blouse that was still hanging on the mirror since last night and turned back to the House-elf.
They were passing the same corridor when something caught his eye through the creak of one of the door. Harry wandered further as he slowly walked into the room, pushing the door opened with a creak. It was like a trespassing, and he had a strong feeling he should have just follow Harry, but couldn’t help himself. Instead he walked into the specious room that was completely empty, floor ripped off, leaving the raw underneath of it. But what interested him the most was the old tapestry of a family tree. His family tree, to an extent.
No matter that it sounded like some ill-fated idea that Harry could come to regret in matter of hours, Draco decided to agree. This day was full of surprises, just so was this term from the beginning. Maybe it was stretching his luck and good fortunes, but looking at how his and Harry’s friendship was bound to end eventually, he decided to take the risk and cherish every moment he could.
you. Giving you a cold shoulder and empty threats was one thing but this … it got me so mad. It shouldn’t be this way. With anyone, violence isn’t an answer. And especially towards you. They had no right. And seeing you like that. Unconscious, bleeding and all beaten …”
He was sitting at the table in the far end of the library, away from his usual spot, franticly looking through the pages of the book in search of one line he needed to copy. He didn’t want to spent more time at the library than necessary, but now, it was inevitable. He had to study all he could in next seven days.
He opened the present, revealing set of books on Herbology. He had read one of them already, having borrowed it from Neville, but others he never heard about. He got the second box that was much lighter, but not much, and bigger. It turned out to be box from polished wood. He could see Harry staring at him intensely as he proceed to open it. Inside he found pieces of fine parchment and many drawing supplies and also small set of watercolors and various brushes. Just a glimpse and he knew how good-quality and price they were. It was from the Owl Post store. He had couple of pencils and pieces of parchment from there, but looking at the price range and how his purchases were strictly followed and arts were frowned upon, he never got a chance to get all the supplies he wanted. But now he did have them all.
Harry didn’t say anything to that for a long moment. He surprised Draco with stepping closer, his warm hands coming to rest on blonde’s red cheeks, lifting his head slightly so he could look into Harry’s sad, green eyes.
“No,” he whispered. “I will not do it. I don’t care what you want. I don’t want to marry someone I don’t love. I don’t care about the marriage of convenience. Father was the one to drag his precious Malfoy name into the mud, and I refuse to pay for that.”
He frowned getting up from the couch and going over to the window. Blaise was standing at the porch, in his very smart black suit and coat. He had no idea how Blaise knew where to find him, or why did he had come.
Why exactly wasn’t he going home? Was it because of his mother visiting Lucius that didn’t want him to come? Or that she was going back to France after that and didn’t want him
He pushed the chair from his desk and got onto it, tip-toeing to get to a well-hidden wooden box from the back of the cabinet, filled with books and miscellaneous items. He opened it, looking through the content. Precisely as he remembered there were six Galleons there, that he gathered throughout the years. It was mainly gold that he found around the house. Be it dropped by his father or guests, or lying under the shelf in the library, or being a bookmark in one of the old books.
Stan gave him a curious look as if he was going to argue, but eventually, he just thanked him and walked away.
It appeared that zoo was much more fun than Draco even thought it would. He figured, at some point, that he was no better than a five-year-old that they met at monkey station. He was erupting with excitement just as much, giving small jumps here and there, not able to contain all the energy that build inside. They were going from place to place, seeing more animals than Draco had knew existed, as Harry was patiently explaining to him where they are from, answering every silly question he got. They made all of one stops to get pretzels and hot chocolate, two of the things that he never tried before, but knew had to have more often because they were simply tastiest things in the world.
It was almost embarrassing, again, as the movie ended and just now he got to see that most watchers were children, but he decided to not care. The Grinch fella movie was the best thing he had ever seen, no matter if it was for kids or not. He had the time of his life, with Harry, and nothing could spoil it.
“You are already up?” Andromeda’s voice came from the entryway. She was already put together, and Draco figured it was something she and his mother had in common. Looking nice and fresh despite the early hour. While he struggled to even get out of bed, not caring how presentable he looked. And he looked exactly how he felt – tired. Happy, but so tired.
Blaise put a silver package on the table and passed it to Draco. He undid the splendid bow ad ripped the paper open, revealing a green, velvet box. He opened t to get a breath knocked out of his lungs at the sight of beautiful black pearls. It was a single string, not too long, ending with few larger orbs in the middle.
Harry too must have sensed how tensed and nerve wrecked he was. He cocked his head, cheek resting on Draco’s leg, and looked at him with the warmest smile he had ever recived, green eyes so kind and caring, looking straight into his.
Draco nodded, hiding a smile. It seemed that perhaps he wasn’t so wrong, and Ron did warm up to him because of his lose.
“Yes, yes. Now you are free. You can do whatever you like. But please, help me. Just get me somewhere away. I need to get a train to Essex.”
It might have been a little bit rich coming from him, looking at how he was snogging Harry, that was in a long-term relationship that he had no intentions of ending – ever. But it was not less true.
He was leaning against the wall next to the portrait of dark woods, hidden in the partial shadow of the hallway that he appeared from. Concern was painting his features, and it didn’t really suit him.
Cat just meowed in response and jumped onto the counter to wait for the tuna. Draco checked on the roast before picking the bowl and can.
Harry looked as if he was thinking hard about something before he spoke again, this time looking at him.
It seemed that the Weaselette was keeping some sort of silent pact with her brother, as she sat there without a word, giving Hermione glances time to time. Which Draco would find hilarious if it wasn’t so pathetic. As if he was one the talk about being pathetic, as always lately.
Soon enough they were sitting at the table, eating and talking about Teddy’s exciting trip to London. The boy wouldn’t close his mouth for more than two seconds, and it was proved hard to get him to eat. After the meal was finished, they moved to the living room where Harry and Teddy started playing right away, uninterested with treacle tart and tea.
He couldn’t wipe off the small smile off his lips as they were laying there, his body pressed against Harry’s, enjoying the closeness. It was as if all his dreams came true at once.
“I’m sorry, Draco. That he isn’t the father you deserve. He shouldn’t force you into fulfilling the ideas of you he had, and plans he created. You are your own person. Amazing, beautiful inside and out. And just because you are such a gentle soul, doesn’t change your worth. If anything, you are worth one hundred of your fathers if not a thousand.”
He followed Harry all the way to the seventh floor, which was more tiring than he liked to admit, and to the empty corridor on the left. He was confused as of why Harry would bring him to the empty corridor but it quickly became more apparent as big, slick door appeared out of nowhere.
with. Hell, his soon-to-be fiancé, as far as Draco was concerned. He wouldn’t be surprised if the two would marry sooner than himself.
The thing was, not for a moment he felt like he was ruining his life. He was turning twenty in matter of weeks. He wasn’t some silly teenager anymore, and he
“You had any idea how worried I was? Madame Pomfrey said you didn’t want to see anyone and then you didn’t show up for classes whole week. What is going on, Draco?”
to have kids. Yes, in ideal world it was after getting married to the man he loved, but he never had it ideal or anything close to it. Having a baby and being a single parent seemed to be the easiest part of it all. The first part felt somehow natural. As shocking as the news were, they brought him some sort of comfort and level of happiness. It was the fact of how uncertain his future was, that scared him and brought everything to ground level.
There was a long moment of silence, that Draco decided to break. He didn’t want to think about anything of his almost pitiful life, things he could and couldn’t do, or the hunting past. He wanted to look at the very few semi-bright sides there was.
After they finished breakfast they agreed to meet at Headmistress’s office in half an hour. Still not believing what was about to happen Draco went back to the Dungeon. He packed his bag, that he had enchanted to hold more that it could. He packed the gifts he had for Hermione, Harry, Ron, Teddy and Mrs. Weasley. It was all beyond awkward but he knew he couldn’t just go there empty handed, so the least he could get was the box of fancy chocolates and caramel liquor his mother fancied. Once he was set to go, packed bag on his shoulder, dressed in his warm coat, hat and new scarf, he left to meet Harry, Salem securely in his hands. He never mentioned he would be taking his cat, but it went without saying.
He shook his head, eyes fixed full of tears fixed on the floor. “N-No. I want to… to be alone. I’m sorry.”
“Good for him, I suppose. Though it is sort of sad that he still thinks he has any sort of upper hand over you. As if you would get hurt by him dating anyone else. It only says about him that he got a girlfriend not long after you broke up.”
He let out the softest moan, even though he tried hard not to, as Harry’s lips slipped past his collarbone and wrapped around his neglected nipple, his tongue doing the most amazing sort of magic.
“Yes, yes.” He kneeled in front of the House-elf, lowering his voice. “I need your help. I need to get out of the house.”
Harry encouraged him to choose the movie based on the colorful posters. He settled on something Christmas themed, as Harry explained, with green monster on the picture. Harry purchased tickets and, once he refused to, chose various snacked for them.
Above anything else I wanted to thank for all of your lovely comments. I want to say that they mean a lot to me, and they all came up in the moments I needed the most. I am here everyday, checking comments, reading stories, re-reading my stories because why not, and I just keep re-reading all the heart-warming things you wrote these past couple of weeks and they really helped me get back on track and uplift my spirits. I won't lie, I want to be a writer, like published author, and I am working towards this goal, and my main goal as an author is to write relatable things, in hope that the readers can feel that their struggles happens to others, to see those things in others lives and possibly give some hope for better future, so to have someone tell me they feel like they relate with my characters here is just priceless.
He didn’t argue and just followed the lady into her pink house with perfectly cut grass and hedge. For the most part, it was the lady that was talking, as she almost forced him to sit at the table in the kitchen and drink tea while she fixed him food. It made him a bit uneasy. He barely ever met strangers, let alone have them be so nice. He was also worried about aunt Andromeda being gone and contacting her. Salem’s presence was helping a bit like the cat laid in his lap, ignorant of the tuna that lady presented him with, and seven curious cats in the house.
“I know,” he sighed. He felt warm lips on his forehead, and he smiled. He could get used to forehead kisses.
Narcissa left the dining table, leaving him shaking with tears running down his face. He had a hard time processing what just happened. He went over many scenarios in his head, but none of them turned out like this. There was a screaming match that ended with kicking him out, but never a thing like this.
wrong. Maybe he could have an hour of rest. The next day it was Saturday anyway. He would spend the whole day learning, and practicing potion making with Slughorn as he has planned anyway.
. I was really hoping for giving you nice Christmas, I suppose. But I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable there.”
“I see. I will be there in a couple of hours, alright? I will pick you up from Mrs. Tilly’s once I’m back.”
Draco nodded, motioning for the guest to sit at the round table. He prepared their coffee and tea and sat own in front of Blaise, not entirely sure how to act or what to say.
“It’s The Room of Requirements. It is whatever you want. I just wished for a nice place to talk with you, but with sort of the window because it gets too suffocating here sometimes.”
Harry didn’t answer. He felt shifting behind and looked there just to find Harry laying on his back, hands under his neck, staring at him.
"No. You two bookworms need some fresh air. You had been here long enough. Come on, pack your things, and lets go."
“Of course, darling,” she said. She presented him with a big cup of tea, and only then she took a better look at him. “Oh dear, why didn’t you say anything? You are pregnant, aren’t you?”
He smiled, shily, as he turned piece of parchment with raw outline of a portrait sketch for him to see. It didn’t look quite as Harry yet but e was getting there.
“There will be time for questions later. You have been out for two days. You hit your head really hard and … oh, well. Drink it.”
He felt the hot tears streaming down his cheeks and he quickly wiped them away. It was so silly of him, letting emotions get top of him. It was a big thing he managed to not stutter while feeling everything that was going on inside of him at the moment. He was positively wrecked. It was the most beautiful day he had ever spent, and nothing could spoil this part, but as they got so close to going to the Weasleys, he knew he couldn’t do it. He was sort of looking forward to it, spending his Christmas with Hermione, his
The prospect of Christmas spent with his friends and Harry seemed so heartwarming. To leave this awful castle for a little bit, see somewhere else that wasn’t the Manor or its grounds or Hogsmeade. But there was no way he would be welcomed there.
“Thank you, Draco. I am so happy to have you as a friend,” she said, as she finally moved away, wiping away her tears.
He was visited by Headmistress, but she didn’t nag him after he said he haven’t seen his attacker. Which was almost suspicious if he gave it more mind.
He scrambled to his feet and run to his room, trying to think rationally. He was scared like he haven’t had in his whole life. He didn’t care about what anyone would say, not even his mother or father, but threatening into getting rid of his baby was another story. What was even more terrifying was the fact that he was closed in this golden cage, and he had to figure out a way of leaving without alerting his mother.
“Mm. The little guy was hungry. Right?” He tickled Teddy’s chin, earning an adorable giggle and nose scrunch. Oh Merlin, how much he couldn’t wait to have that. Not that he minded Teddy any less. He loved the boy with all his heart. But, he couldn’t wait to meet his baby, hold them in his arms, give little kisses and hugs. But he wasn’t due for another eleven weeks.
They moved away and Draco put his gifts safely in his bag as Harry was going through his wardrobe contents. The brown-haired man announced he was going to have a bath before he disappeared in the bathroom. Draco, on the other hand, went back to bed, keeping himself occupied with one of the Herbology books.
He felt the strong urge to lay next to Harr and hug him. The expression on his face made him uneasy. He looked distressed, and as if he was in deep concern, and thinking heatedly on top of that. It was way too much for one human being to do at one.
“It’s okay. I don’t mind. He can stay there as long as he wants, we will leave the door creaked so he can walk around the house when he wants. I will get Kreacher to bring him food …”
As any other day, he was buried deep into his homework and extra credit for few subjects. Lately he didn’t have much time for anything else than essays and whatever else there was. He was spending his days at the library, as usual, but there was no more time for talks with Harry or Hermione, or to read one of the piled up books that were just pleading for him to be read. The fact that ever since the weird situation few weeks back, him and Harry got a little bit awkward around each other, wasn’t helping in the talking part.
“No,” he lied. “We … We agreed that when one of u-us decides it is over … we would just split our separate ways. And I want th-this to be … to be over.”
“I won’t push you to go there, no matter how much I disagree. Keep in mind that no matter what people at school say or what you stubbornly keep telling yourself, who your father is, doesn’t mean it’s who you are. Or that you should be guilty of his doing. Remember that it’s not only you. Andromeda is Bellatrix’s sister. And Bellatrix had taken the only member of family I had left, only person that knew my parents, who was like a brother to my father. But I would never find Andromeda accountable just because Bellatrix was her sister. I suppose many people can’t tell the difference and are choosing to get it out on whoever is available. But maybe you are right. Maybe it’s not the best time
“Hello,” he greeted, sitting in front of her. There wasn’t much space for his things, so he just took out his thick notebook where he had put all of his notes.
“We could have dinner on Sunday. Invite Mother. I will make onion soup, confit de canard and chocolate souffle. It is her favorite.”
He would have to find a solution. But for now, he had to come with terms that he wasn’t alone anymore, and it wasn’t only himself that he was willing to give up on anymore.
He didn’t tell his mother about his condition yet, and it was already the middle of July. The fact that he was pregnant was no longer information he could forget or hide so easily. He started feeling sick not long after coming back home, and he didn’t do much more than napping or just laying in his bed or at the patio. There was also the fact that he quite literally popped. One day he just noticed that his favorite turtleneck was a bit too tight around his middle, and he was now sporting a small belly, that couldn’t be really considered a weight gain. His whole body still looked the same ghostly, sickish way it did before. So, he had to take an extra measure of wearing more baggy clothes, which didn’t go unnoticed by his mother, that said he ought to take better care of himself, not to parade around like a beggar.
He changed into a midnight-blue blouse he had in his closet and black pants that were stretchy enough to fit him. Which he couldn’t say about much of his clothes. His everyday attire could be anything he pleased, but he knew he would be getting an ear-off for dressing into something he had already worn. Better be safe than having his life ruined already.
The man walked inside giving his coat to Draco that just hang it on the old wrack. Blaise was scanning the small house carefully on their way to the kitchen.
Now, the boy he loved, and girl that he considered best friends, were both gone from his life, and he had hard time figuring out how to put together the near future for sake of his baby. It was wearing him off, and he found it difficult to think about anything else. He couldn’t focus on his studying, more often than not just staring at the pages of the book blankly, letting his mind drift away.
He was on his way to the Dungeons when small black splash went almost flying his way on the floor level. Salem started rubbing against his legs, meowing loudly. He picked the cat, stroking its smooth fur and letting it rub head against his face.
He felt quite literally sick. He couldn’t believe that it was his own mother talking about him and his life at the moment.
It was a weird thing, being alone. He got used to that over the years, especially when the war started, and then back at the Manor, following the events. But it was different. Back then he didn’t have so much on his plate, he didn’t … lose so much. He found it hard to wrap his head around the things that happened. He was no longer Hermione’s friend and Harry’s secret lover. Now, he was friendless and soon-to-be a single parent, which didn’t fit in his head at all.
First of all he will have Harry and Hermione to answer to. He would have to break things off. With Harry it was somehow easy, but with Hermione, there was no real reason to it. He figured that even the Weaselette didn’t have other reason than to make sure he suffered enough. Thinking about the redhead girl made him think that, after all, he wasn’t the worst person in this weird love triangle.
He got a bit lightheaded as it really hit him. It was stupid. He let it go way too far. He should have stayed at school, decline Harry’s invitation. Hell, he should have never become friends with Harry in first place. It was getting out of hand and it was pure example. From Harry’s point of view it was all innocence. His nice, insular friend staying over at his place. If anything Draco was a charity case and that’s why Harry was so nice to him, inviting him for Christmas together and then to stay at his house. Be it charity or true friendship – it only made Draco’s heart beating faster and more hopeful no matter how much he told himself it was stupid.
“Oh,” he let out, thoughtfully. He didn’t see that coming. But Harry’s remark still didn’t do much sense.
“Well, you had a glimpse into his amazing self here and there, didn’t you. He was a bit worse than that as a father, I suppose. Very … demanding, and not taking
He reread the letter few more times, smile on his face. He missed Blaise as they haven’t seen each other in a long time. Which he understood. Blaise was tending family business now and he was constantly busy. So, the fact that he was going out of his way to meet him was heartwarming and he wouldn’t miss it for anything.
“Have you thought about what to do after school?” Harry asked, once his homework was done. He was leaning in the chair, watching Draco carefully as he was drawing him.
“She hated my father. She thought he was after her position. Which wasn’t true, because he was very comfortable where he was. And I just asked how we would pass our OWLs if we didn’t know how to cast spells, because even learning in Charms, we would take hours and hours to master easy spells, not talking about things that were more advanced, like everything at Defense Against the Dark Arts. So, I’ve earned two weeks of detention. Then another three some time later. She thought she would get back at my father going after me, but he was mad at me after he knew. That I let myself be treated this way.”
“I am sorry that I came without a word. I got the address from your mother. I am not sure if she told you, but … I know everything. She told me some time ago when I pressured her into giving me a reason of why we aren’t going to get married.”
“You will get rid of it. I will not have some bastard child ruining our family. It would be a final straw-“
“No, of course not,” Harry said, quickly. “It was very considerate, I wasn’t actually expecting that. It’s … it’s very nice of you. Even more than that.”
Her words came so sudden that Draco abruptly stopped, looking at her with startled eyes. He had forgotten that she was even there.
The brown-haired man got a bit shifty, eyes travelling around the bathroom, and Draco could swear that his formerly warmth-induced blush grew deeper.
Draco snored, making himself more comfortable in the corner of the couch, putting some much-needed distance between himself and Blaise. Salem was fast to get back to him, nestling to his stomach and demanding to pet. Silver tray with fine china popped at the table nearby and Blaise stood up to fix them tea.
I don't know what to say, it has been a while since I last posted and I just...I don't know, I don't love this chapter and am second guessing this story, so we will see how it goes.
“I think that’s understatement. She was a bitch. She came over for mother’s tea parties’ and dinners until she died. I was a kid back then but she traumatized me nonetheless.”
“Your friends are waiting outside, but I wanted to talk to you first, before they come in,” Mrs. Pomfrey said.
He felt small blush on his cheeks. He almost forgot about that. Blaise wanted to marry him. It all came out of the blue but was no less real.
“Of course. Ron gives me in-depth stories of their relationship that I never asked for. He has been talking about it for weeks, but he wasn’t sure. I think it is good idea for them both, to breakup. They will be better off as friends. Sometimes t is like this, I guess. You love someone and it doesn’t work out the way you want it.”
It continued on, talking about the passion the two shared and the way that the sex between them was also overflowing with passion.  Whether it was tender or animalistic – it was always passionate.  The two men acted as though they had a constant hunger for each other that would never be satisfied.  No matter how many times they tried to quench their thirst for each other ~ and those attempts were often and described with great detail ~ nothing was ever enough.  It seemed to scare both of them at times.
The brunette did not have much family.  Those he considered family were actually his close friends.  The few blood relatives he had were only family in the genetic sense.  He would never call on them for support of any kind.  The blonde had been surrounded by family until he came out to them.  He lost his father almost immediately and nearly lost his mother.  He would have lost his mother had she not fought against it so hard.
“And I have to agree too. They visibly are mad at you because of the whole break up thing. What makes no sense whatsoever, because it was bound to happen, and Ron has a girlfriend anyway. But they are still mad,” Draco said.
Harry undid the parchment that was addressed to him. After reading, he crumbled it, sticking it inside his trousers pocket. He immediately started packing his things, in rush.
“You are so much more than that, Draco. You are smart, intelligent, talented, so kind and good. You don’t deserve some dull life, being with someone you don’t want, stuck in the life you don’t want, just because your parents are expecting you to do it.”
He could see the point. He really could, but something in him, maybe motherly instincts or whatever, didn’t let him see past it.
He laid in bed that night, trying to think how his future would look like. He was scared, that was obvious, but there was a lot of hope present. He knew that no matter the denial, he was having his baby, there was no questioning it. All it needed was a little bit of time to warm up to the idea and to put things together before they came. Which he found hard to even envision.
Draco looked at the clock that showed five past six, on his way to pick milk and eggs from the fridge. No wonder Aunt A was still asleep. It was still dark outside, mostly due to the clouds, but the sun has barely risen a few minutes back.
Draco looked away, considering whether he should tell or not. Harry didn’t know himself, so it wasn’t fair. But then again, Blaise was so nice to him, wanted to save him, thinking that Draco needed saving.
Harry took two wrapped parcels out of his bag and walked to him. He sat next to Draco and passed the presents to him.
He was sipping on his tea, trying to suppress both the headache and unpleasant news when the shrinking sound of the wards came. Aunt A quickly scrambled to her legs to go see who it was.
Harry’s expression made his smile disappear. He wasn’t in teasing mood anymore and there was no more room for it. Harry visibly regretted that, and was beating himself up as if he did a really bad thing.
Before Harry could say more, he pulled him to the ground, laying next to him. Harry smiled softly, placing the gentlest kiss on his cheek.
First two periods went by smoother than he thought. None of them were with Gryffindors, and none of his friends were in close proximity. Only when he was at the Library during lunch had he run into Hermione.
There was a moment of heavy silence as Harry was staring at him intensely, concern painted on his face.
His head snapped to look right at Harry, his eyes full of hot tears that he desperately fought to not let go. Harry didn’t look his best. His hair was more disheveled than they usually were, even more, grown out now. He had dark circles under his eyes, and his skin looked a bit gloomy, sickish.
“Do we really have to talk about it?” Harry muttered. Draco found it almost adorable how embarrassed Harry got because of the subject. He wasn’t expecting that. He thought he would be the one to shy away from it.
“I did the full body scan in search of your injuries when you were brought here and I found out then. I run another scan to see if everything was alright. But your baby is very strong, and luckily it wasn’t harmed one bit. It appears to be around eight weeks.”
He tried to say something, ask why was he there, but no words came out. His throat felt coarse and closed off.
Thank youf or tuning in, for reading this chapter, and if you made it this far - for reading my rant!
A big part of Draco, that wasn’t overwhelmed with emotions, wanted to tell him that it was alright. That they could be together. That they were going to be a family. That they were having a baby. But nothing came out of his mouth. It just couldn’t. At this point too much had happened, and Draco himself had a lot of thinking to do.
Ana looked around the room, noticing the trunk, and Draco’s distressed face, and he knew she put two and two together.
There was a heavy silence between them, though Draco felt as if he won something. For the second time in his life, he stood up for himself. It would be easy to marry Blaise. So easy. But he didn’t want easy anymore.
Not that Draco minded. If any of them were there, he couldn’t be closer than one feet to Harry. And he really liked the way Harry had his arms wrapped around him, while he leaned against his chest, between his opened legs as he was reading the book.
“I know, Salem, I know,” he muttered to the cat that was rubbing against his legs. “I got you a tuna, so you can just shut up with the judging and stuff your face.”
“Uh, pretty girl! Pretty girl,” a voice called few meters from him, and he ignored it until it called again.
“I saw Hermione leaving. She was thinking so hard that she didn’t even notice me. I suppose she has a lot on her mind.”
