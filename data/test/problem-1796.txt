“He’s still your superior officer, Harry, and he has a lot of influence with the Wizengamot. If he speaks in defense of his men, people will listen.”
“Right. Well, they’re linked by magic. When I trigger the spell, it’ll make a green line in the air, tying me to Papa. So, if he’s in chambers where he’s supposed to be,” Harry twisted around to point at the blank wall to his left, “the line will go that way, through the wall, and into the next building.”
The castle was wrapped in a profound silence, as if every portrait, gargoyle and suit of armor was deeply asleep. Draco had never prowled its hallways this late at night and never under the invisibility cloak. He found it an unnerving, almost surreal experience, as if he’d died in his sleep and come back to haunt the castle as a ghost. When he moved through a swatch of moonlight on the floor and cast no shadow, he shuddered and withdrew into the deepest shadow he could find where he didn’t feel so utterly and horribly
Draco tried to lift his head but couldn't quite manage it, and to his own surprise, Harry slipped a hand behind his neck to help. Malfoy fixed him with dull eyes, too miserable to complain about the despised Harry Potter taking such liberties with his person.
His face was bruised and cut, both eyes blackened, lips spit and bloodied and crusted with substances Harry didn’t want to think about. At the sound of Harry’s voice, his silver-blond lashes twitched up. Harry caught a glimpse of opaque grey eyes looking blind against the purple bruises, then the lashes fell again.
Draco told himself not to betray his pleasure by blushing. He couldn't afford to let his guard down yet and expose himself to Potter's sharp, knowing eyes.
"Yes. Or it might simply vanish, taking all its threads of power with it. The point is that we simply don't know, and I won't risk your life without your full understanding and agreement. And I certainly won't do it, if it isn't necessary, which brings me to the second reason.
Fury, hot and pure, flared up in Harry, and he almost laughed aloud at the sense of power it gave him. "I'm not afraid of you! I stopped your husband without Dumbledore's help, and I'll stop you, too!"
“He can’t. This is a confidential meeting about an ongoing investigation.” Draco cut a sly look at Robards from the corners of his eyes. “And our esteemed Head Auror knows just how much trouble he would be in, if any part of it is leaked to the press before the investigation is closed.”
“We’ll have to check in the attics at Grimmauld Place for more plays. Or suck it up and visit the Manor.”
“Good. We need to get her here—that should be easy enough—and find a way to keep her here. To shut the wards so she can’t disapparate.”
He lifted the bottom of his silk camisole, baring the flat expanse of his belly and the rigid bar of his prick straining against his pink lace panties. Then he dragged a dripping strawberry up his stomach, leaving a stripe of red-streaked cream on his skin. Finally, he took a bite of the berry and sucked the juice from his lower lip.
Harry closed her eyes as she began to work, not wanting to see the hand again until it was whole and praying that the nurse could fix it.
“Me?” Now Draco looked at him, and Harry struggled to interpret what he saw in the other man’s eyes. “You brought
Hagrid crossed to the Conductor in two strides, grabbed him by the front of his purple jacket, and threw him bodily up the steps. "Yeh'll do as yer told, Shunpike, and yeh'll get Harry teh Hogwarts in one piece." He shot one bristling glare at Ernie, and the driver scrambled for the door of the bus without a word.
Dumbledore's reasonable words acted like a tonic on Draco. He listened to them in wonder, feeling the panic in him die and the sickness fade. He was not subject to his father's demands. Dumbledore would not let Lucius take him out of the castle, and the charm was no longer there to force his obedience. The horrible, wrenching illness in him now was a product of his own mind and not of the poisonous charm. When his father spoke again, Draco listened with something approaching calm.
Draco hesitated, then nodded. He wasn’t all right, not really, but he was trying. Dinner with the Weasleys hung over his head like the Sword of Damocles, a constant threat that he knew he had to simply accept. He couldn’t avoid it, couldn’t hide in the cottage any longer, couldn’t come between Harry—his
Harry’s tears quickened. He slipped a hand behind Draco’s head to lift it and cradle it against his shoulder, murmuring damply, “I’ve got you, love. I’m here now and I’ve got you.”
Draco’s last rational thought was that, if he held on any tighter, he’d tear Harry’s robes off his body. Then Harry drove into him, and he forgot to how breathe.
Draco stared at Harry—face pinched, eyes glassy and feverish, fingers pulling unconsciously at the sleeves that hung down over his hands—in taut silence. He frowned in confusion. Then he said, “It is you. I thought I’d dreamed it.”
Dumbledore smiled, some of his old sparkle showing through the worry. "Made him look every inch the fool, my dear Minerva," the smile died and the gleam left his eyes abruptly, "and earned himself an implacable enemy in the process, I'm afraid. But for the present, Harry has more credibility in the eyes of the wizarding world than Fudge, in spite of our esteemed Minister of Magic's attempts to tarnish his reputation, and Narcissa is in no position to challenge him. She was caught today in the company of two escaped prisoners…"
By the time Harry broke the long kiss, allowing the web of power to fade, the two boys lay tangled together on the Slytherin green blanket, their clothing banished and the shimmering bubble of a warming spell enclosing them. He lifted his head to gaze down at the boy pinned beneath him, and his heart swelled in his chest, choking off his breath.
“Just the usual,” Harry said around a mouthful of fries. “The baby’s doing fine, but Draco needs to eat more and sleep more and stop trying to use his magic. He accidentally turned Bulstrode’s quill into a wombat today.”
“I don’t. And you didn’t, until you lost your grip and started obsessing about what the rest of the world thinks. What happened to the Harry Potter I married? The one who scoffed at bad Press and laughed in the face of Basilisks?”
Dumbledore lifted a hand as if to touch Draco's hair, then remembered that he was no more solid than Harry and pulled it back. "With any luck, he'll never know."
Both Ron and Hermione looked startled by his reaction, and Hermione said, "I'm sure he was only trying to smooth things over with Mrs. Weasley."
Draco saw the shock in his mother’s face and felt a little ball of warmth form in the pit of his stomach. She didn’t know.
But Harry did not rise to the bait. He was still focused on their son and his incredible—not to say impossible—feat of magic.
Harry shrugged that off impatiently. “Too many people know the secret, including Kingsley Shacklebolt. And it’s in my Ministry file as my residence, so Robards could find it. Besides, I fucking
“I don’t want to leave Draco like this. He had a rough night and he still looks a bit green around the gills…”
Ron chuckled and tickled the baby’s cheek again. “Like I said, Iffy is better. It’s short for Iphigenia.”
“Hmm? Oh. Well.” He shifted from one foot to the other, then waved a hand at the box. “Just open it, you prat.”
He wanted to get up and pace his cell, to keep his blood circulating, but he had no will to move anymore. The end was coming, very soon, and he would welcome it. He only hoped that it would come quickly for all of them, that Harry and Draco and the others wouldn’t suffer any more than they already had. And that little Iffy would never know what she had missed. Maybe, if she never heard the name Harry Potter, she’d never realize what her life could have been if her father had found her in time. Poor Iffy. Poor Ferret. And poor Harry, to lose them both so soon!
Lucius curled his lip, raked his son with a withering gaze, and drawled, “How nice to see that you take this situation seriously. Is it for my benefit that you’ve painted yourself up like a two-Sickle trollop, or for theirs?” He waved a languid hand toward the packed benches above them.
He felt oddly self-conscious as he stripped off his pajamas. He could feel Harry’s eyes on his back, staring at his ugly scars, counting his ribs through his too-pale skin, and he flushed under their gaze. Folding his pajamas, he laid them neatly to one side. Then he turned to approach the bath.
“Yes. Papa woke up while you were napping, and he wants to see you as soon as his healer is finished. So, will you be a good boy and wait for your tea?”
“Git.” Harry finally opened his eyes and smiled at his scowling husband. “I don’t mind that you woke me up, but I could’ve done without the hex to the ribs. And you might’ve lit the bed on fire by mistake, then where would we be?”
of alarm from Audrey. “That goes for all of you. I had better not hear a single whisper about this at the Ministry or read a line in the papers! Bob is only three years old and can be forgiven a lack of discretion, but you do not have that excuse.”
Draco felt as if the floor were tilting out from under him. How could she say it out loud? How could she strip him bare like that? Expose him to all these scavengers who were just waiting for the chance to pounce? She was supposed to be his friend. Even when they fought and insulted each other, she was supposed to have his back…
“She’s unhappy that we had to throw the party so soon after that business at the Ministry and is worrying about appearances.”
Well, never let it be said that a Gryffindor didn't learn from his mistakes! To hell with caution! Draco was not going to magically turn into a different person to suit Harry. Draco was Draco, and Harry would just have to learn to deal with his perverse nature. Which meant that Harry would have to make things happen himself, rather than waiting around for Draco to take the lead.
Draco grimaced at him. "Of course I bloody well miss her! But it's not like she's on the other side of the world."
Shoving back his chair, Ron got to his feet. Then he paused, one brow raised, to ask, “Coming, Malfoy?”
They halted less than a handspan apart, not touching but so close that Harry fancied he could hear Draco’s heart beating over the frantic racing of his own pulse.
Harry stared down at the bracelet on his wrist, his heart suddenly pounding and his body cold. He cast the charm again and again, with the same shattering result. Felix gazed anxiously up at him. George watched, frowning, from the doorway. But Harry could not look at them or think about their distress. Only one thing mattered now.
“No!” Draco jerked himself out of his confounded state and bristled at her suggestion. “Not a bleeding chance!”
in purple block letters. A drawing beneath this legend showed two stick figures—one pointing a wand at the other and firing a jet of power that made his victim jerk and flail pathetically.
It had faded since Voldemort’s death but it was still painfully clear against his porcelain-white skin. A skull with a snake coiling out of its gaping jaws. Grotesque, even if you didn’t know what it stood for, but of course, everyone in his world knew exactly what it stood for. And they all knew he carried it on his arm, even when they couldn’t see it.
Draco should tell him the truth, but that could get Draco killed. Draco bit his lip, rubbing his palms together. How was he supposed to balance this line between friendship and duty? His stomach dropped at the thought of blurring those lines together. He could hardly tell what was right and what was for survival anymore.
He didn't voice any of these thoughts as class began. Professor's Firenze's voice washed over the class, but Draco couldn't force himself to pay attention.
Draco let the offense roll off of him, not really giving a shit what people thought of his father right now. "I'm just a shithead," he joked to Greyback's huff of laughter.
Draco's hands were shaking, his breathe stuck under the pressure of his chest, his heart straining to beat, his vision blurred, dark at the edges-
Potter's panicked voice echoed against the small lavatory. He was failing against Severus's attack. Draco turned his attention to something else. The dark room was lit by blue torches. Severus's potions and supplies littered the tables closest to the walls. Draco focused on the large bookshelf behind Potter, struggling to read the spines of the books, but needing the distraction. He had taken the seat on one of the stools.
A familiar laugh drew Draco's attention. Potter, laughing at something Weasley had said, Granger next to them with a sly smile on her lips. Potter had taken off his school robe, showing the muggle jeans he wore underneath. The top button of his button shirt was undone, his tie loose against the heat. His sleeves rolled up to his elbows.
"I…" this wasn't how Draco wanted to have this conversation, but when would he have the pair of them in the same room again? He had to take his chance. "Professor," he gathered Dumbledore's attention, "you've trusted me with Potter's mind, correct?"
All of the other dormmates had continued to breakfast. Draco and Blaise were the only ones in the room.
Draco turned, the crowed parted. He had proven his point to Montague, but he needed to make clear where he stood, what he would do if anyone crosses him. "Oh, Montague," his voice chillingly polite as he turned to face the older boy, "before you get any ideas, do remember that that was my first hit. I could do so much more."
"Malfoy," Dumbledore turned his gaze to Draco, his eyes suddenly warm and twinkling, "I know that we are not particularly close, but I was wondering of your, how to put this, your romantic chases?"
He locked himself into a random stall, his hands were shaking. His first sob surprised him, he quickly place a silencing charm around him. He tried to calm his breathing, but he couldn't. Why? Why? Why wasn't he told before about Daphne? How was he expected to do this? This balancing act of appearing to be in the Dark Lord's service when really he could stomach being around him? The man who was playing the Malfoys as if they were his puppets? Daphne. Daphne knew too much, but she didn't understand, not really. She wasn't there, she wasn't there when-
Draco walked towards Potter, interrupting his stammered apology as he wrapped his arms around shaking shoulders.
"Sounds good," Draco smiled, clasping his cloak around him to protect him from the chilly night. He waited for Potter at the door so they could leave together. "You should ask Cho out for Valentine's," Draco prompted, "I'm sure she'd be thrilled."
"What are you doing, Montague?" he asked. He had to know why Montague thought he had a base to challenge Draco's authority.
Pansy walked beside him, allowing him to be silent without question. The two exited the classroom and into the crowed hallway. Students milled around him. They all seemed so young. How many of them didn't know of the dangers that lurked in the shadows? How many of his peers were going to be forced to carry the weight of an early marriage? His marriage was just the beginning; the tip of the iceberg. There was a cliff, he was expected to jump, eyes close.
Draco mocked gasped, "I will have you know, Potter, that I am very humble. In fact, I would say that I am the most humble person I know."
So that was what Granger and Skeeter's meeting was about. Draco bit back his grin. Potter wouldn't tell Draco despite his nagging. Simply shrugging and noting that he didn't want to ruin the surprise.
The tension in his shoulders loosened. Daphne opened her copy of the Daily Profit, content to read silently next to Draco.
Draco continued with the conversation despite the awkwardness from the three adults. "I'm glad," Draco's voice was too cheerful for a funeral. He was being too transparent in his politeness. He couldn't make himself care. "And I'm going to assume that you've made a full recovery?"
Daphne rolled her eyes, "You're no fun," she teased. Draco leaned back against the window. He could see out of the corner of his eye Daphne pull out her cigarettes. She locked the door with a quick, silent flick of her wand. Then, she handed Draco one. Draco took the smoke from her slender fingers, she cupped his face as she lit the cig as Draco held it between his lips.
"Malfoy, if you are too distracted for my class you are welcome to leave," Severus interrupted his thoughts. Pansy tensed beside him, Blaise snorted on the opposite side.
The nothingness of the night reflected the void growing inside of the small boy. He started to shake, he curled into himself, wrapping his arms around his knees. He didn't know what to do. How could he be expected to follow the man who killed his friend, a person he had admired? Cedric is…was, was kind, charming, smart, he could make anyone laugh and everyone liked him because he was always genuinely himself. He didn't deserve to die. Serving the Dark Lord is what Draco was meant to do, what he has been polished to do, following the Dark Lord is what would bring his family respect beyond all glory.
Pink nails tightened over the brightly covered magazine, knuckles turning white as Umbridge continued to read, her face turning the same color as her pink hat. Draco would count that as a pink item. He had made his way into the triple digits now.
A bad taste in his mouth was left as he watched the Weasleys say goodbye to each other. Mrs. Weasley patted Potter on the cheek after wrapping him in a tight hug.
He could barely handle what he was doing now. The nightmares, the constant paranoia, his emotions stretched so thin he could snap at any time. Then, there was the risk. Draco would have to widen his inner circle, but to what? How much was too much?
Draco looked down at his hands. How could he put what he felt for his father, his own actions, into words? Lucius had been arrested, with the care he would receive in Azkaban for his knee, Draco wouldn't be surprised if his father was permanently disabled. He had done that. He had no regrets, or did he? "I'm sorry about him too," Draco settled. No words would ever explain his feelings for his father.
"I'll go on ahead," Blaise sighed, an understanding nod in Draco's direction, no words were needed between them. He left without another glance.
Draco gave Severus a pointed look, but while his relationship with his godfather definitely had gotten more casual, Draco knew better than to give Severus a reason to give him detention. The bastard.
Draco blinked, covering his surprise. What would he do? "I would break your nose, Headmaster. For being such a coward."
"I didn't use my wand," Draco started carefully, "because the result would have been less than satisfactory."
The threads of magic were tangled around the cabinet. The essence of the life of the cabinet was mingled and twisted amongst itself. Pulling at any of the threads could snap the magic with how tight the bonds were.
“You have always been more capable than you think you are,” Draco finally responded, ignoring his instincts. Carefully being vague, but doing his best to offer what little support he can. He continued with, “My mother always says, ‘You will conquer what you have to,’ Blaise, you will get through this because you have to,” Draco finished.
Daphne would be married off to her betrothed when she became of age, probably on her birthday to ensure quick pregnancy to further pure-blooded lineage. She probably wouldn't know who her future husband was to be until the betrothal ceremony. He was probably going to be a much older man, wouldn't be surprising if he already had children.
"Better that you have no thought of it," he dismissed. Better that you don't know where my arrow is coming from.
His surprise was distracted by a loud thud and the sounds of a girl screeching followed by crashing. He turned to see Pansy running at Bulstrode with a spiteful vengeance, even managing to topple the much larger girl in her rage. Pansy was a fury of fist, slaps and scratches as Bulstrode was forced to the floor. Draco could hear the sound of Pansy's fist from across the room where he stood.
"What? Just because he hasn't taken to Occlumency, doesn't mean he is stupid," Draco snapped, "he is making amazing progress given the situation."
Why wasn't Potter responding to Severus's lessons? Draco himself had been taught by his Godfather, his response had been much quicker than the process Potter was making. Draco's eyes dropped in the weight of sleep. Potter was not only not making any progress, but he had been regressing lately. Why? Was Potter not responding because of the teaching style? He could keep up with Draco just weeks ago. Draco's head nestled in his elbow.
“You don’t need their forgiveness. No,” Harry cut in, when Draco opened his mouth to protest, “you don’t. Neither of us do. Now stop working yourself up into a strop and let’s go enjoy our disgustingly expensive bottle of wine.”
“He isn’t that loud,” Harry retorted. “He hasn’t got nearly the lungs that Bob did at his age. And what’s this obsession with your sons wrecking our house, anyway? Does mindless, destructive violence run in your family along with the insanity?”
“I can’t help thinking, sometimes, of all the ways my life has gone wrong,” Draco murmured. “All the hideous things I’ve done or let other people do to me.”
Draco gazed at him for another beat, then flopped onto his back to fix his eyes on the canopy above their heads.
“Okay, mate,” Ron ventured cautiously, “I don’t know what’s got your wand in a knot, but we need to focus on the problem at hand. Just for now. Just ’til we’ve got Ferret safe. Then you can go mental and tear that Boggs into bloody scraps, for all I care.”
When Draco gave him an irritated poke in the ribs, he broke away, laughing. “All right, time to put your anonymous face on, love. We’ll be late for our appointment, if we don’t hurry.”
He staggered under the onslaught, his knees going weak and his vision swimming with spots. Catching at the counter for support, he leaned into Draco, shuddering atop him, gasping for breath. Draco held him with arms and legs, bit at his throat, sucked bruises into his flesh, and whispered fiercely,
Draco turned his blind-looking eyes on Harry for a moment, then reached a hand for the wand. He didn’t quite touch it.
“She said she’d pay a fortune for the evidence that had cleared Malfoy with the Wizengamot. She’d been scrabbling for everything she could get on him, like a Niffler after gold, and that was the one thing she couldn’t find. She didn’t even know what kind of evidence it was or where it had come from.”
Draco did not respond to his bantering tone, only stared at him in growing doubt. "Something's wrong."
“Hoo, that’s rich! When you go prancing out of the common room every night, shaking your pretty arse, and come back the next day looking like you’ve been fucked six ways to Sunday? Who do you think you’re fooling?”
At that point, Montague dropped into step beside Seamus and interjected, “Quit worrying, Thomas. Potter’ll love it. So will Longbottom. I know they’re Aurors, but there’s no law against looking. Not against touching, either, come to think of it,” he added with a wolfish grin.
more desperately than usual, if that were possible. It took all his self-control not to strip him naked right there in the Thestrals’ wood and bugger him silly. And that was a problem.
Draco bowed. He wasn’t quite sure how he managed it, with a Hogwarts carriage under his robes, but he did. He even added a flourish of his hand for good measure. “My apologies, Madam Marchbanks.”
"Not yet. First we will remove it, from his body if not from his mind, and give him some relief from its effects. But soon - very soon - he must make a final choice."
“Okay, so half of my family is ancient wizarding nobility, so what? I’m still just a regular bloke, a half-blood raised by Muggles, with no clue how pureblood society works and, quite frankly, no interest in learning.”
Harry let out a bark of laughter. “No. I can’t see him getting his hands dirty, either. If he wanted to do this, he’d hire a hit-wizard.”
“No, Potter, I could not.” Harry twisted round to see Pomfrey standing in the gap in the screen, looking dour and disapproving. “Not without doing even more damage. You and Weasley need to clear out so I can work.”
“Yes, I sent Dolores Umbridge to secure the child, but she took two healers from St. Mungo’s with her, not violent ruffians. Yes, I took the child from Draco Malfoy, because he is not in any condition to care for himself, much less a child, and because I could not leave You-Know-Who’s offspring in the hands of his most… devious servant.” His lip curled in profound disgust. “I consider that I did my duty, no more, no less. If you don’t agree, then point out to me where I’ve failed you, and I’ll correct it.”
Thank you, thank you, from the bottom of my heart for reading and commenting and sticking with me so long! I hope the ending doesn't disappoint!
The drudge—Jewel, she’d called herself, though anything less like a precious gem would be hard to find—waved one claw-like hand at the hole and said, “Go on, then. Tha’s Col’s room.”
His body liked being this close to Harry’s with nothing but a flimsy layer of sopping-wet cotton between them. The sane corner of his brain informed him, sternly, that he had to break the other man’s hold, keep his distance, let his blood cool a bit, but the lunatic part was in full control now and in no mood for caution. Draping an arm around Harry’s shoulders, he tilted his chin up to meet his eyes and gave him a challenging look.
“Well. If I’d known smutty jokes were all he needed, I’d have started telling them a week ago,” Ron stated.
Draco reached out toward the glittering object, then pulled his hand back without touching it. His face was carefully blank, but Harry could feel a sickening brew of shock, horror, curiosity and fear seething inside him.
“You’re completely mental,” Draco muttered, settling back into his place in Harry’s arms. “Luckily, there is no way you can get me… what was it?
Sadness darkened Harry’s face and started a new ache in Draco’s chest. “That they found out? I assume you mean the Slytherins.”
“I figured.” Harry sank back into his chair, now holding Draco’s hand protectively in both of his own. “That’s why they came after you. They think you’re fair game.”
” Summoning strength he didn’t have, Draco reached out to push himself away from Snape’s chest. “Fighting… I can
"Harry." Dumbledore waited until Harry turned to look at him again. Then he went on, softly, "Look into your heart and tell me, honestly, did you do anything to Draco through the link that changed who he is or how he thinks? Did you do anything to him that he couldn't choose to reject, later?"
Harry, dazed and drained as he was, responded instantly to the pain in his lover’s voice. Sliding half off of Draco’s body to free his cock, he captured his mouth in a searing kiss and wrapped his hand around his pulsing erection. Draco groaned and arched up into his grip, mouth falling open to take Harry’s tongue as deeply as he had his cock.
Draco smirked, slipped a hand through Harry’s arm, and began leading him toward the shelter of the woods.
Heat and wetness flooded him, fused their bodies deliciously together, ran over his skin and smeared when Harry leaned in to capture his lips in a filthy kiss. He whined into his lover’s mouth, already aching for more. Harry grabbed a fistful of his hair, twisted his head to one side, and plunged still more deeply into the kiss, while Draco rutted helplessly against him. Pinned between the wall and Harry’s body, impaled by his cock and his tongue, legs tangled in leather trousers and caught up tight against his own chest, Draco could barely move, much less find the friction he needed for relief. It was torment, but it was sweet. So sweet. And he had tears running down his cheeks by the time Harry broke the long kiss.
Harry groaned again—this time in despair—and propped his head against Draco’s, eyes shut as he fought down his surging lust.
They had not reached the first turning in the corridor when Dumbledore caught them up. He held the box with the Pensieve in one hand and Harry's wand in the other.
Neville looked hard at his partner and saw only honest curiosity in his face. He trusted Anthony with his life. But did he trust him with Harry’s secrets? Harry’s family?
"Oh no! The Dementors!" Hermione suddenly clutched at Ron's arm and began pulling him down the corridor after Crookshanks' slinking form. "Hurry up!" Crabbe followed, and together, the three of them raced after the cat.
He did not let himself remember that Draco might still die when they broke the charm, and if he lived through that, he would be a target for Voldemort just as Harry was. Those things didn't matter, because Harry had sworn that Draco wouldn't die while he was there, and he would die himself before he broke his word.
“All in place,” Hermione assured him. “Your Muggle neighbors may get a bit fuddled if they venture too close, but it won’t hurt them. And no magical person who doesn’t already know the cottage is here will be able to find it.”
“Bloody Hell,” Harry groaned again, letting his head sink into his hands. “Please don’t ever say that in front of Draco!”
A sob shook her little chest. Her tears quickened. She uttered an agonized wail, grabbed her shift in both fists, and ducked her head to bury her face in the damp fabric.
“Yeah.” She smirked knowingly at him, her ugly face full of equal parts affection and derision. “Like you’d know wot t’do wif a
out of you for the rest of the night. If you want me, we do it my way. If not, you can go shag the giant squid for all I care."
Potter was still dressed in a t-shirt and pants. In the bath. He was even wearing socks. Potter had climbed into the bath in his
“You’ll do no such thing.” Harry didn’t sound angry, just certain, which brought Draco’s own fury up in a tide.
Harry just smirked and held out the partially eaten sandwich to him. Draco wiped his eyes on his sleeve, sighed, and took it. For some reason, his throat didn’t feel nearly so tight now. He might even be able to eat.
“Master will let Kreacher spend the night in his Family’s home?” The disbelief and hope were plain in Kreacher’s voice. “With his former mistress?”
“No, but just in case things go tits-up with Robards, I want him to know what kind of danger he’s in.”
Dumbledore retrieved the boxes and returned them to their place beneath his chair. After a moment's consideration, he pulled out his wand and cast a quick binding spell to hold them there.
“We’ll have to check in the attics at Grimmauld Place for more plays. Or suck it up and visit the Manor.”
When they finally returned to the Great Hall, they found the party in its later, more frenzied, more exhausting stages. The orchestra had made way for a four-piece pop band that sounded like alley cats being tortured with a Cruciatus Curse. The dancers—mostly the younger students—had shed their dress robes and were sweating profusely as they careened about the floor. Some guests were lolling at tables, drinks in front of them, while others had withdrawn from the cacophony to converse more privately. A large number seemed to have fled to the magically-warmed garden to do Merlin knew what.
The blank disbelief in Malfoy's face was echoed by a cold horror that ran like dead fingers down Harry's spine. Forcing his own feelings down deep, where they could not show in his face, Harry set a rigid mental guard about the Blood Link. He opened it wider, allowing a strong, steady flow of power to pass into Malfoy's body, but he sent no spark of awareness with it, no guidance or emotion.
At the insistence of both Pomfrey and McGonagall, he stood up and took an unsteady step toward the bed, but there was a terrible pain blossoming in the empty place inside him, expanding with every breath, robbing him of strength. One more step and it would overwhelm him. One more breath and it… Then he remembered.
Harry eyed the Headmaster warily, wondering how much he had overheard. "Malfoy has a headache, Professor. I thought maybe Madam Pomfrey..."
Harry knew precisely what that meant. From the grins on several of the faces nearby, the rest of the audience did, too.
“What is this, Malfoy? Some kind of ploy to insinuate yourself back into wizarding society? To buy yourself a pardon with a bit of land?”
"Professor Snape!" Harry had never been so happy to hear another voice in his life, and he didn't even care that it was Snape's. "Hurry! It's Voldemort... he's got the charm! He's..."
Harry’s magic closed in a fist around MacMillan’s throat, cutting off his flow of words and his flow of oxygen at the same time. He went rigid, scrabbling at his neck but finding nothing to grab. His face turned a shocking shade of red. His eyes widened in panic.
But in the next instant, Hermione’s bubble popped. It wailed and vanished in a curl of smoke, leaving Harry standing there with his wand in his hand, smiling apologetically.
Harry pulled himself up short, horrified by the direction his thoughts were taking. This was exactly the temptation Dumbledore had warned him against, and Harry had almost walked straight into it the moment Malfoy showed a hint of decency. But it was wrong. The worst kind of wrong. A wrong so complete that it would put Harry on the level of Lucius Malfoy and Voldemort himself to do it! He could not tamper with Draco's feelings, subvert his love for his parents or force him to choose a path not his own. He could not, no matter how desperate the ache in his chest when he thought of letting Draco walk out of this castle and home to
"Yes, I admit that, but Dumbledore's given you a better way to find that out. Better than drugging him, when he's in no condition to give his permission."
She washed her hands more anxiously, gazing up at him with huge, tearful eyes, but Draco did not relent. Summoning what dignity he still had, he glared down at her and said, “Find my owl and send it to my window. At once. And bring my supper.”
The Fat Lady gave him a huffy look and pretended to become absorbed in the progress of a fly that had blundered onto her canvas.
That sparked a chorus of protests from all three boys that dragged Harry, once again, over to the table. He had Draco’s wand sticking out of his pocket, but it was the spatula that he brandished as he descended on his shrieking brood.
Dumbledore answered, very clearly, "Break it. Everyone out of the room except Severus and Minerva. Go on, Poppy, there's nothing you can do here. Are there any students still on the ward?"
Harry shot Draco a wry look and moved to sit down. Draco shadowed him, taking the chair to his left, while Narcissa arrayed herself on a small loveseat across the tea table from them. Lissy’s outburst had effectively banished the awkwardness in the room, and Harry felt almost relaxed as he accepted the delicate china plate Narcissa held out to him.
charm seemed to be working. No one commented on his absence, much less on his return, and the name ‘Harry’ did not pass their lips. Gideon even went so far as to ask Harry if he was nervous about the big, family wedding awaiting him on Sunday. Harry laughed it off and ordered himself another drink.
The marble perfection of Narcissa’s face began to crack, as emotion overwhelmed her. She twisted her fingers together, pulling until they went bloodless, and took an unsteady breath. “You’re telling me that you—
The gentle tone squeezed him like a fist, making his throat close up tight and his lungs sob when he tried to draw in a breath. His eyes burned with fresh tears. He turned his face into Harry’s shoulder to hide them.
"How is he, Poppy?" Dumbledore asked, as he moved up beside Harry and bent over the still figure in the bed.
“Easily,” Harry retorted. “I’ve been living with this since I was eleven. Get a grip, Draco, it’s just their usual rubbish. It doesn’t
Harry clapped a hand over his mouth to stifle his own cry and started down the ward after Snape. He had to run to keep up with the Potions Master, and the growing pressure in his chest made it difficult to breathe, but he clutched a fold of Snape's robe in one hand and forced his legs to keep moving. Snape ignored his clinging hand.
“Please.” Draco pushed himself up on his hands. “I don’t have a wand. I can’t apparate without one.”
They entered the Forbidden Forest on a narrow track that appeared to have been made by some kind of animal. A game trail, Harry thought, except that he had never seen any normal sorts of creatures in the forest who might make such a trail. Perhaps the centaurs used it. Or the unicorns. Or the werewolves and giant spiders… Harry shuddered and picked up his pace until he was right on Hagrid's heels.
Many of the Wizengamot wizards were now muttering together, speculating as to what Dumbledore had up his sleeve. Others were frowning at Draco, unhappy with the turn the hearing had taken, while yet others were smiling and nodding, anticipating a good show from the wily old wizard who never let them down. Fudge looked decidedly unsettled.
Harry laughed and started away, but Draco halted him with a final, desperate attempt to free himself of this infernal party. “Don’t we have to get home and feed the menagerie?”
“I almost died because Forbush interfered with the ritual. And because we didn’t know what the labor pains meant. But we know what to expect now.”
“Now talk to me, Dragon,” he said, softly, without loosening his hold on the smaller boy. “What did Dumbledore say about the letter?”
Dumbledore moved to the left of the doorway and turned to face the blank wall. Lifting his wand, he swept it across the stone surface and said, "
“I mean it. Give the man a break, for Merlin’s sake! Show him that there’s one person in his life who won’t use him as a- a
"So that's it," Lucius purred. "The pathetic little half-breed boy hopes to rival the Dark Lord, and you want to establish your place at his side. Well, you picked the wrong master to serve, my boy, and now you will pay for your lack of judgment."
Harry rose to his feet and moved numbly toward the door. He murmured a farewell to Dumbledore, though the words did not penetrate the fog in his own mind so he had no idea what he said. The door opened for him, he heard Fawkes give a musical call, then he stepped into the stairway and let it carry him downward.
“He almost blurted it out today. You should have seen his face when he realized what he was saying. Priceless!”
Marshaling her courage and reminding herself that she was only doing her best to help a fellow Slytherin, she said, "Yes, sir. They've got him in one of the dungeons with Potter. Professor Snape says he was injured the night of... the night you came, sir. And I think it must be true, because Vincent Crabbe saw him and said he looked bad."
“Potter needs to know the truth! Whatever it takes!” MacMillan protested. He was hunched in a chair, clutching his right foot, face red and eyes watering.
The meal passed pleasantly enough, in spite of the din. The kitten provided a handy distraction. She fascinated the children, amused the adults, and gave Draco something to hide behind when he wanted to avoid Granger’s sharp eyes or Weasel’s too-insightful humor (and no, the irony of a concealing his hugely-pregnant self behind a minuscule creature no bigger than the palm of his hand was not lost on him).
Flattening his back to the wall beside the piano, Harry gazed intently at Draco’s face, unable to tear his gaze away.
He crossed his arms and stared hard at his underling. “You may be a celebrity to half the Wizarding world, Potter, but you’re still just a junior Auror and you answer to me. So start answering.”
Even the singing was a reward, of sorts, or that’s how Nero had presented it—a way to sell himself more effectively and raise his prices. Draco had wanted nothing to do with it. He was nervous of crowds, afraid of being recognized, and the thought of getting up in front of all those men and parading himself like an advertisement for sex was appalling. But, as always, Nero had prevailed.
“You’re poking fun, but it does. Only consider how much the man eats! I sacrificed an entire tin of Molly’s lovely ginger biscuits to keep him happy!”
Neville shrugged and risked a glance at Harry. “If you really… you know… care about him, why not just say so?”
After a tense moment, when the only sound in the room was their labored breathing, Harry said, flatly, "I don't want to hear the words
“Fuck!” he snarled, when an entire stack of parchment slid out of a folder and spilled onto the floor. “I don’t have time for this!”
“Cheers,” Harry said, with a smile. Then he wrapped both arms tightly around Draco and disappeared with a crack.
Draco obeyed. He couldn’t help himself. He lay with his head in the hollow of Potter’s shoulder and his arms resting wide on the sides of the bath, while the other man washed his body clean. He was quietly grateful for the fabric barrier between their bodies, but he didn’t fool himself that it meant he was any less Potter’s than if they were tangled naked together in the water. No cloth could disguise the intimacy of his touch, any more than his soft voice and careful requests could mask the possessive power in him.
After a few quiet moments, during which Draco began to realize that he felt almost human, he asked, “Will they leave scars, Lissy?”
“Some of them will be, no doubt, but the one who booked the party specifically asked after you. Wanted to make sure my pretty Colin was performing tonight.”
“I will give it to the Master,” Wormtail whined, cringing away from her. “He put the boy’s capture in my hands, and I will deliver…”
“Shut your filthy gob!” Crabbe growled. He dropped to one knee beside Malfoy and caught his head between his enormous hands. Turning and lifting the smaller boy until he could look into his face, he said, with clumsy gentleness, “Malfoy? Can you hear me?”
Harry laughed, nipped his ear teasingly, then took that marvelous, fascinating, incendiary body in his arms and pulled it tightly against him. For once, he was happy to let Draco have the last word, since all he wanted in this world was to kiss him. To kiss him, and kiss him, and go on kissing him... To make love to him until he set whole constellations burning in those ice-grey eyes...
" But Harry did, and before the shout of protest had left Draco's lips, Harry was gone. Draco took a gasping breath and staggered back against the nearest wall, his legs suddenly unable to support him. Bent nearly double, he wrapped his arms around his midriff and fought down nausea, eyes screwed shut against that lingering image of Harry being swallowed by the yawning mouth of the dungeon.
“What in Merlin’s name would we need that for?” She bustled over to the two men on the floor, looking cross and worried in equal measure. “What trouble could you boys possibly have gotten into apparating from St. Mungo’s to here?”
He turned to gape at her, panic once more rising in him at the realization that she was serious. “You can’t!”
Prewett squirmed uncomfortably, his gaze sliding away. Robards just waited. Let him sweat for a minute.
“I don’t know where he got it, but I caught him with it, out of his cage. He was trying to use it as a wand to free Draco.” Tears spilled from her eyes again, painting bright streaks down her face.
Harry lifted a hand to brush back his hair and cradle his cheek. Against his will, Draco turned into his touch, let his eyes drift closed and his lips part on a soundless moan of longing. Then the other man spoke. “But
“She’s really here.” He suddenly seemed to remember the presence of his love in the bed behind him, and he turned his head in Harry’s direction. “Harry?”
“Consorting with Death Eaters. Oh, not recently,” Harry assured them, when he saw the Headhunters exchanging sceptical glances, “but I have it on good authority that he did business with Lucius Malfoy and made overtures to Voldemort himself.”
The grey eyes widened dramatically. “I didn’t make it up. That’s why McGonagall wanted to see me. Bob was sitting right there in her office, doing his best imitation of an abused puppy while McGonagall positively
For every familiar face in the mob that filled the narrow country lane—Andromeda, Teddy, Hagrid, several Weasleys—he could see a handful of strange ones. And even some of the familiar ones weren’t exactly friendly. George Weasley? The surviving Terrible Twin had never gotten past prickly and snarky with his adoptive brother. Dennis Creevey? He was an ally in the Press, no question, but Draco hadn’t been this close to him since Hogwarts—since he’d stolen his dead brother’s identity and dragged it through the mud of Knockturn Alley—and had no idea how he’d react to finding himself face-to-face with the infamous Draco Malfoy.
“Harry!” he gasped, suddenly shaking on his stool, filled with urgency and pain and the need to leap to his feet, rush out of the room, run to Harry. “Harry…”
Inspiration struck again, and Ron said, lightly, "You should leave off studying and go practice with him. That'll make both of you easier to stand."
Felix wasn’t far wrong. Thanks to George’s willingness to amuse his nephew and his inexhaustible supply of dangerous toys, Harry had not registered the passage of time, but Draco had been gone for nearly two hours. This wasn’t necessarily a problem. Legal consultations could drag on endlessly, as Harry had every reason to know. But Draco wouldn’t forget that his son was waiting for him.
With that, he headed for the door, leaving behind a startled and distinctly unnerved Draco. In the doorway, he hesitated, turned back to his father, and mused, “I hope you pick the baby’s name so she gets the perfect one from the start.”
Harry gaped at Fudge, too shocked even to protest, and for a sickening moment he feared his heart had forgotten how to beat. Then Madam Bones' exasperated voice reached him, and his heart started again with a painful lurch.
“What about you, Harry? Have you seen any sign that the Slytherins, or anyone else, for that matter, has figured it out?”
“But, if I proved I’m competent, if I were a real adult with the rights she talks about—rights of ownership and inheritance—they’d have to give me my parents’ estate, wouldn’t they?”
more desperately than usual, if that were possible. It took all his self-control not to strip him naked right there in the Thestrals’ wood and bugger him silly. And that was a problem.
He’d have to find her. Bring her home again, if only for an hour. Draco needed her, even if he never spoke of her, and Harry was damned well going to make sure he got her.
“I will not,” Draco said. “This is my last clean set of robes that still fits, and I won’t have it crusted with porridge!”
“I want you inside me again, Harry.” Draco slipped his hand behind Harry’s head, pulling him closer, and pressed his cheek to his hair. “Please.”
Harry hesitated for a long moment, then nodded. Sirius tried to smile, but it came out crooked and Harry had to look away to keep from crying even harder.
Harry groaned and plunged into the kiss… into Draco’s mouth… into the giddy delight of claiming his husband in the silent halls of this beloved castle. The castle where he’d first seen Draco Malfoy. Watched him. Wanted him. Loved him, even if he could never say it aloud, even to himself. This place had always been magical to Harry, and all those years watching Draco across classrooms, halls and the Quidditch pitch had only intensified the magic. Made it more special to him.
A long minute passed, then Marchbanks spoke again. “I want the courtroom cleared of spectators and witnesses while we deliberate. In an orderly fashion, please.”
"Gee, maybe I'm a little upset. I got kidnapped by my own father, almost died - again - and had my hand cut off for my own good. It's been kind of a rough night."
“Yeah.” Potter’s cheeks reddened adorably. “I was afraid of that, too. So I kept the glamour on and stayed with you, paying for whatever you were willing to do in public, while trying to figure a way to get you out of that place.”
How was he supposed to respond to this? Did Molly Weasley honestly expect him to sit down to tea with her? What could she possibly have to say to him that wouldn’t fit in a very short letter—or an even shorter curse?
Angry at the noise and frustrated by the lack of progress on the food front, the baby let out a wail. Pain burned through Draco’s chest at the sound, and he came to a snap decision. The boys would have to find out soon enough that their father was turned milch cow, so now seemed as good a time as any.
Once the creature inside him had been a frightened boy, then a tormented ghost, then a man pulled back from the brink of self-destruction and offered a chance at life. Now he was… what?
“Nonsense,” Granger said severely, “I’ve barely scratched the surface. Magical Inheritance is a very complex subject, and the available documentation is mostly too old to be useful. I’ve had to infer quite a lot.”
“The Cruciatus Curse doesn’t take a lot of skill,” Harry pointed out, “just a lot of hate. Bellatrix Lestrange taught me that.”
The Slytherin shrugged and started picking at the edge of his bandage again. “I didn’t fancy being made to feel any more of a prat than I already do.”
“He may pet you and tell you you’re pretty,” Harry went on. “He may take you to bed, himself, and claim he’s giving you a treat. But he’s just doing what your father did, and you don’t have to take it. Not anymore.”
Philippe sat down on the bench and tugged on Draco’s hand, pulling him down to sit on his lap. They were virtually the same height, but the Ravenclaw was broader and sturdier, giving the impression of greater size. Not that it would have mattered to Draco if the other boy were six inches shorter than he was. He wanted to sit on his lap and loop an arm around his neck. He wanted to gaze down into his swimming, brown eyes. He wanted to be cradled in his arms and lean into his body.
There was, in fact, plenty of room on the chaise. Draco had years of practice and plenty of stains on the cushions to prove it. And if he was going to spread his arse for every man who handed over his gold to Nero, he was going to do it on the chaise. Not in his bed. Not as long as he could avoid it.
He honestly didn’t know what to do. It was such a little thing for his husband to ask—just a bath, and what was a bath in the grand scheme of things?—when Draco had already denied him so much. And yet…
Sensing Harry's gaze on him, Draco awoke. His lashes flicked upward, and his eyes – unguarded in that first instant and smoky with remembered passion – met Harry's. Both of them smiled. Then Draco's smile turned to a smirk, and his eyes glittered wickedly.
Dumbledore led him into Draco's room, startling Madam Pomfrey up out of her chair. Draco gave no sign of noticing their entrance. Handing the draped object to Madam Pomfrey, Dumbledore pulled out his wand."
“For you. I brought her for you, Draco.” Harry abruptly sat down beside him on the sofa and reached to stroke the kitten’s head with expert fingers. “Remember what you told me about your first kitten?”
"Now Severus, you know that is an exaggeration. For one thing, young Mr. Malfoy is in no condition to run anywhere. For another, there is no saying how he will react to its call when he awakens."
His eyes tracked around the room—taking in the deep shadows muffling its corners and the still form of Harry snoozing in the rocking chair with a bundle of flannel in his arms—coming to rest on a pale smudge hovering in the dimness beside his bed. Bob’s face above the black of his traveling cloak.
His face brightened dramatically. “Really? Cool! Wait’ll I tell my mum!” Then he waved a farewell and bounced away, once more the bumptious, exuberant Creevey of their Hogwarts days.
Draco knew that Nero was showing his approval by pleasuring him this way. Nero was a busy man with a stable of whores to manage, and even with his favorites, he rarely had the time to waste on this kind of personal attention. But here he was, cuddling Draco on his lap, stroking him, getting him off as if he were a paying customer. As if he mattered.
“No,” Draco gasped, eyes flying open as the guards hauled him to his feet. “Not again! I told… I told you everything…”
Harry shut the door very firmly on his heels, then threw up a Muting charm, just for good measure. He was feeling almost smug as he took the chair to Kingsley’s right, across the table from Robards and the Headhunter. But the fact of Madame Pauncefoot’s presence was ominous, to say the least, and his satisfaction was short-lived.
Draco just nodded and allowed Harry to guide him out of the room with a hand on his back. In his arms, Draco’s son wailed miserably and burrowed his little face into his shoulder. Draco didn’t quite kiss his head—that would be undignified—but he did rest his lips against the silver-gilt down that covered his scalp and inhale his singular baby-scent, silently repeating his promise.
The sound of someone clearing his throat just behind them shattered Harry's golden dream and brought Draco up with a start. Only as the other boy shoved him roughly away did Harry notice that they were lying on the grass, tangled together, with Draco's body beneath his. Draco pushed himself upright and twisted around in alarm, while Harry rolled onto his back and gazed bemusedly up at the intruder.
Mr. Weasley spoke up, talking over his wife’s head. “Fred and George suffered some burns, but nothing serious. And Percy got knocked on the head.”
A shudder went through him, and Harry moved closer, pulling Draco's head against his midriff. When the shuddering did not ease, Harry sent out a tendril of reassurance through the link, wrapping himself around Draco's frightened and pain-wracked mind to calm him. This time, the other boy made no protest.
Was exchanging blow jobs with Marcus Flint such a transcendent experience that it took him to a higher plane of consciousness? Was this the pinnacle of sexual pleasure? Odd thought, that, but then everything about this afternoon had been odd. Delightful, but odd.
For a long, long stretch of time, Draco said nothing. Harry slowly increased the flow through the link, taking more of the other boy's over-stressed emotion into himself as he gave back healing strength and subtly worked to counteract the charm. When Malfoy pushed himself away, Harry immediately let him go. And still they said nothing.
“Oh, Harry, of course I do,” she sighed. Then, her lips tight with distress, her eyes defiant, she bit out, “It’s house-elf magic.”
Ron gnawed his lip, wondering just how much to share, then gave a mental shrug and said, “Okay, I’m working on the theory that the Memory Thief crimes are all linked to one person.”
“Er…” Draco mumbled, flushing at the thought of just how little Lovegood could have seen from the Manor dungeons.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about,” he retorted, a mocking glint in his eye. “I never laid a finger on him.” His laughter abruptly died and his eyes narrowed dangerously. “But make no mistake, Potter. The next time I get my hands on that cunt, I won’t be so gentle.”
Finally, as they hopped over a hedgerow and into the snow-covered spinney, he ventured, “Narcissa is the only link I can find between Andromeda and Lucius’ associates. But I hope neither of them is involved. I hope someone is just using Andromeda’s name and face because it’s convenient.”
Dumbledore paid him no mind. All his attention was on Draco. "I can give you time to think about it, but not a great deal. It would be best to go with the other Slytherins if you plan to go at all."
Draco straightened up and fixed him with a sardonic look. Harry was relieved to see the demon of laughter back in his eyes. “Big D? Seriously?”
“I brought you here from St. Mungo’s.” Harry cocked his head curiously. “Don’t you remember anything?”
He’d also learned—from his own experience over the years—the value of turning his back on the accused when he spoke. It helped him keep his temper. It also helped him avoid feeling sorry for the person chained to that ominous chair. Not that he was likely to feel sorry for Edmund Warwick under any circumstances.
This was a frightening new development. ’Til now, he’d been able to control the pain and the urgency by giving himself this silent pep-talk, reciting all the ways that he was obeying and fulfilling expectations. He had no idea if the words were important—if they actually reached anyone—but at the very least they reassured him and eased his sense of failure. That had been enough. Until tonight.
He let those words lie on the ground before him for a moment, daring anyone to challenge them. Then he went on in a tone that was milder but, for all that, more deadly. “I have no wish to start another war when we have so lately concluded one, but make no mistake, I will if I must. Return the child, Lily Potter Malfoy, to me now. Stay away from Hogwarts unless invited there by me or one of my staff. Release Draco Malfoy from his guardianship and return him to his full rights as an adult wizard of good standing. Make no further move,
Harry could live without burying himself in Draco’s arse. He didn’t expect it. Didn’t need it. And most of the time, didn’t miss it. But every once in a while…
Harry gave himself a handful of seconds to consider this, realizing that Draco was absolutely right and his friends would roast him over a slow fire, if he got married without them there to see it. Then he pulled his wand and cast yet another Patronus.
Harry heard a rushing sound from behind and risked a glance over his shoulder. The Death Eater was gliding up the hill without touching the ground, looking so much like a dementor that the breath caught in his throat at the sight. Would a Patronus stop it? Harry wondered. Then the figure raised it's wand and fired a jet of green fire into the hillside just ahead of Harry's feet. He lurched to a stop and fell back a step, dragging Draco with him. Taking a firm grip on his wand and his courage, he turned.
“Oh, for Fuck’s sake!” Draco huffed, and Harry had the distinct impression that he would have thrown his hands up in disgust, if they weren’t propping him up. “I conjure my Patronus by thinking of Bob, all right?”
“Certainly.” She smiled at him, and if he weren’t so sure that she’d lost the plot, he would have been moved by the affection in her eyes. “Any man who can face down the Wizengamot can keep a NEWT-level class in line. And you have the real-world experience to command their respect.”
“After all these centuries? I would have moved mountains to find it and return it to its true owner.”
Tea fixes everything. That’s what Harry said. But he couldn’t think of Harry now, or he’d burst into tears and humiliate himself in a way that taking it up the arse from Amycus Carrow couldn’t.
“Ask Sirius Black. Or better yet, Ronald Weasley. He unknowingly kept Pettigrew as a pet for years.”
Harry’s arms slipped beneath Draco’s and closed around his ribs. “This is what I dreamed of, every time we bathed together. You naked in my arms, all soft and slippery and beautiful.”
The pity in Dumbledore’s face deepened, making Draco want to squirm. “The Unbreakable Vow is some of our most ancient and powerful magic, as old as Wizarding kind itself. We use it only at the direst need because it cannot be undone by any power known to us. To my knowledge, no wizard has ever dared to twist the Vow in such a way, to force it upon another magical being against his will, but Lord Voldemort has never been constrained by morality, decency or a concern for the consequences of his actions.”
At that moment, a strange little face poked around the door, bat-ears erect and pencil-nose twitching. Viola gave a shriek, then laughed at her own foolishness. "Oh! It's only a house-elf!”
Mustering some vestige of his old snarkiness, Draco lifted an eyebrow at him and took a sip of water.
But Draco did not wait. He worked his way down until he fetched up between Harry’s sprawled legs, crouched on elbows and knees, head bent over his enraged cock. It was gorgeous. And so hungry. He thought of holding it on his tongue and his lips swelled in anticipation.
Thankfully, Harry didn’t have to finish that thought. When he reached the room, he found the door locked, the security spells in place and Draco Malfoy curled up in the middle of the mattress, fast asleep. He still wore his traveling cloak and had a bag of clothing and books beside him, telling Harry that he had not even stopped by the dungeons before coming here. His posture was huddled, defensive, even frightened, but his face looked peaceful in the soft moonlight filtering through the curtains.
“I had her under my desk in the office for nearly a week. Then I thought… well, I thought you two could help each other out.”
Harry understood why Ron had warned him not to show up wearing Harry Potter’s face the instant he flooed into the Ministry. The Atrium was packed with people, all milling about, shouting slogans, waving signs, and waylaying any Ministry official unwary enough venture among them. A group of six or seven pounced on Harry the instant he spun into view, tugged him out of the green flames, and jostled him forward into the general mob.
“Realistically?” She grimaced. “According to that first article, the reporter tried to get a statement from him, so he already knows at least some of the story.”
"Lucius Malfoy." The room fell instantly quiet. "He's dead. Killed with the Avada Kedavra curse. Kingsley was certain of it."
Molly pursed her lips in disapproval, but Draco could see the affection lurking in her eyes. “What about attendants?”
He tried to answer, but his lungs and vocal cords would not work. Nothing worked. His heart was frozen in his chest, his body paralyzed, his mind slipping rapidly away into pain-shot darkness.
He thrust aside the scroll, and Robards snatched it up, clearly not wanting Kingsley to see any more of it or Harry to get his hands on it. Not that Harry wanted to touch the thing. He’d rather eat dragon dung.
Draco swallowed audibly, his eyes sliding sideways to where a knot of witches and wizards stood with their heads together. “They’re staring.”
Harry quickly sat down beside him and slipped an arm around him, rubbing his hand up and down one thin, white arm. “Are you cold? Let me find you some clothes.”
"I think it best if I remain here," Dumbledore said. "If Minerva has things well in hand at Hogwarts, my time can be best spent at the Ministry. Severus, will you please escort Harry back?"
“There’s no proof of that, yet, only some superficial similarities,” MacMillan declared. “And obviously, Robards thought you had enough on your plate.”
After a beat, Draco turned to face the gates and drew his wand. As he swept it in an arc above his head, murmuring a spell, the wrought-iron scrollwork arching over the gates began to curl and writhe, reshaping itself. When it stopped, the words
“I don’t have a lot of friends. I can’t afford to lose one.” His eyes gleamed suspiciously in the half-light, and his voice dropped to a rough whisper. “You only did one thing wrong.”
“He didn’t try.” Snape scowled blackly, remembering yet again what he’d seen in the minds of the boys who had attacked Malfoy. “He was already in the grip of some spell when they reached him and made no attempt to fight back.”
It was too much… Harry seeing his act, seeing through his mask, buying him, wanting him, making Draco want
"No, we can't tell Snape about it," Millicent was saying. "He's too thick with Dumbledore these days."
Draco could tell by the sick, horrified look in his eyes that he'd hurt Harry in some visceral way that he had not intended, but the other boy did not lash out at him, shout denials or rail against him. He only sat there, starting at Draco, with his soul bleeding through his eyes.
The words were coming more easily as he grew used to the sound of his own voice and let some of his brewing resentment come out. "I waited for you to make up your mind, or screw up your courage, or whatever it was that needed doing. I told myself that you knew more about this stuff than I did, that I could trust your instincts better than my own. I waited, Harry, and I waited. Maybe it doesn't feel like very long to you, but it feels like an eternity to me! Every time you kissed me and I
Draco was shaking with a vicious combination of cold and terror, fighting to free himself of Harry’s grasp but unable to stand without his support. He managed to pull away, then staggered and started to fall. Harry caught him in his arms and gathered him up against his chest, gritting his teeth in agony when Draco whimpered, “Please, no. I can’t.
"I'm sorry, Professor! He isn't very good about staying where I put him, especially with so many edible things running around, and in all the confusion I, well, I rather lost track of him."
Draco shook his head and leaned into Harry’s chest once more, letting the other man guide his head down to its proper place. “It’s fine, as long as he doesn’t think this lets him off the hook. I
“It’s not that. I was just wondering… aren’t there spells protecting the island? Anti-Apparition charms, like the ones here?”
His eyes lifted to Draco’s again, and his face softened with adoration. “You’re the heart of this family, Draco. You couldn’t possibly ruin it, especially not by bringing more children into it.”
“Baby.” Another wandless spell warmed the potion. As he resumed work, he said softly, “You’re a bundle of nerves. What are you worried about?”
That heartbreakingly lovely smile spread over Potter’s face again. Pulling a wand from his jeans pocket, he waved it over the bed, and the blankets peeled back from Draco’s shivering body. Another wave, and he went weightless. With a murmured apology, Potter stooped to slip his arms behind his shoulders and knees, then he lifted Draco effortlessly in his arms and carried him into the bathroom.
If he were to think about it, Draco would probably find some reason to distrust Potter's admiration. He would decide that it wasn't genuine delight at all, but pride of ownership. After all, Draco was his trophy, and the more beautiful the prize the more value it held in the eyes of others. If he were to think about it, he would realize that the Ravenclaws were right and he was nothing more than Potter's Plaything. If he were to think about it... which he wouldn't.
“Grave?” Professor Sprout’s usually placid face was red, her hat sitting askew on her flyaway hair, her hands clutching at the upholstered arms of the wingback chair as her outrage boiled over. “
, Papa!” She gave another imperious tug on Draco’s hand. “You’ve done enough wallowing for one night! The least you could do is help me repack the trunk so the broom will fit, since you’re too craven to stand up to Dad and just cast the charm already!”
“Obviously, we have to take that with us.” She clasped his shoulder in a vain attempt at comfort. “You’d better shrink it and get it out of sight before Nero shows up.”
“But there are so many good Roman names,” Harry protested. “And the constellations mostly have Latin names, too. We could choose one like yours—not Draco Junior, that would be cruel, but Scorpius or Cygnus or Pavo. I like Pavo a lot; it means Peacock.”
Draco refused to rise to the bait, though he could practically hear Harry seething beside him. He squeezed the other man’s hand to rein him in and waited for the hum of noise to die down again.
With another throaty, wordless noise of contentment, Draco snuggled his head into Harry's shoulder again and closed his eyes.
Draco could not think of one, single thing to say in response to this bizarre statement, so he resorted to gaping again.
“I don’t know anything, except that you and Potter are both a bit too sure of yourselves. You’re sure Malfoy is guilty. Potter is sure he’s innocent. Neither of you are looking at the evidence objectively.”
Harry felt a creeping dread overtake him. Shooting Ron a half-desperate look from beneath his lashes, he asked, “Are you going?”
Harry shot out a hand to grab the front of his robes and drag him half across the desk. Nose to nose with the loathsome man, he ground out furiously, “I’m Harry Fucking Potter, right? And that
Potter was not jealous of the supposed giver because Potter didn’t care about him. Any suggestion to the contrary was just his mind playing evil tricks on him. And the sooner he got away from those flaming, green eyes, the better for all concerned.
Draco opened and closed his mouth helplessly, thinking of how it felt to have that strange magic possessing him. He had wanted it. Desperately. Even though he had no clue who it belonged to or what it meant to do with him. Was that what it meant to imprint?
“Only, you don’t look it.” She narrowed her eyes at him, telling Harry that she could see right through his husband’s bland, smiling mask. “You’re much too pale and getting thinner by the day.”
Draco twisted his head to gaze down at the other boy. His stomach dropped into his very cold toes. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
He knew that look. He’d seen it often enough during the war and had avoided it since only by hiding his face from a public that despised him and wanted him dead. He hadn’t expected to see it here, in this quiet village, but that just proved what a fool he was.
But Potter was not in any mood to listen to reason. He was suddenly bubbling over with enthusiasm, chattering happily, oblivious to everything but his own inspired idea. And Draco—a treacherous warmth pooling in his guts—could only listen in horrified fascination.
strangers because her sister asks her to—and her connection to Malfoy is even sketchier. There’s no way to prove that she knew anything about him before she read it in the
Harry shrugged. “He’s gone into hiding, is my guess. He panicked when he saw all those Aurors in the club and ran.”
Draco awoke to a wash of morning sunlight and his husband cajoling, “Come on, love, open those beautiful eyes.”
“Yeah, those big white ones that Lucius kept. Seems they don’t like their new master, or maybe they like him a little too much. Anyway, he’s in hospital, being treated for exposure, bird bites, and spell damage. And
With a wrench that seemed to echo down into his soul, Draco turned away from the crowd behind him and back toward the dungeons. He forced his feet to move and his mind to ignore the seductive magic that called to him. He couldn’t go searching for his mate, not with Potter there, watching him, confusing his impulses and overloading his senses. He had to get away, even if that meant walking out on The One.
“Well, now,” Andromeda said, picking up her teacup and glancing between Harry and Ron, her brows lifted in enquiry, “it’s lovely to see you both, but I expect you didn’t come here for tea and gossip.”
"There's no right answer, Draco. Just tell us what you remember." Harry had never heard such a gentle and persuasive note in Dumbledore's voice. "Anything at all."
“The Malfoy boy?” His croaking voice grew louder, his eyes wider and brighter with every passing moment. “The pure-blood great-nephew of my former mistress? The sole surviving heir of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black?”
Professor Firenze gently touched his shoulder before kneeling down in front of him. He held a bowl of water and a towel. He ordered for students to back away, allowing Draco room to breathe. Firenze took Draco's hands gently, dripping them into the warm water. The blood disappeared, turning back into ash in the water. Graying the bowl. Draco wiped his face with the towel, ignoring how his hands were shaking as Professor Firenze stood up. He addressed the class in a steady tone, "Omen Fire shows us our fates, but rarely does the ash give a direct form." There was a thick silence that tickled Draco's spine. "What could be some meanings behind the ash for Mr. Malfoy?" Professor Firenze asked the frozen class.
Bentley decided that he had enough, hurrying up the stairs without so much as a good bye. "Wait," Draco outstretched his hand, "come back."
"It's unfortunate that Parkinson won't be able to return home this holiday," Daphne spoke beside Draco.
"What brings you here?" Narcisa spoked for the first time today. "I didn't know you were close to the Greengrass'."
Potter smiled a gentle smile, one that was kind his pain. Potter was so strong. He was made of iron and steel without shielding his heart. Draco couldn't make himself into iron, but he could twist himself into something dangerous.
The corner of her lip turned upward, "You should have seen my mother yelling, red-faced at the healers about making sure I don't scar."
"You and I both know that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better," Blaise steadied Theo with a glare.
Would Potter still care for him with his hands thick with blood he never wanted to shed? Could Draco support Potter through his grief when his own guilt consumed every action he took?
The stones beneath his feet turned into soft, lush green grass as he entered the Divination classroom. He kept his gaze low to avoid Professor Firenze's eyes. He wondered how much truth he would find in this gaze. Draco just knew that Firenze foretold Daphne was going to die the second her fire went out. Draco could only guess if his Professor knew that he was her killer.
Draco breathed in the smell of the Owlery, or, the smell of bird shit. He didn’t want any further unpleasant situations by following the twins down the long steps of the tower, so he would wait until he was sure they had moved along.
"I'll start cutting the roots, you adjust the temperatures of the cauldron," Pansy instructed, gathering the supplies from Draco's arms. Then cutting the tough roots into even pieces. Draco cast a cooling charm on the cauldron, attempting to find just the right temperature to begin seeping the roots.
"It's not your fault," Potter pulled away from Draco. Meeting his gaze. Potter looked so tired, as if he had aged years in the little time they've been together.
"My apologies, Professor," she continued to seep the root as if she hadn't just cause literal hell for the rest of Draco's life.
No one had whispered a word of the truth of Daphne's death. Her presence was a void in the students of Hogwarts.
Daphne's fight slowly dripped away from her. Her hands grew weak. Her back was wet from her blood that was tight against his chest. Daphne was out of breath. Astoria's screams burned Draco's ears. He held her tight against him. Tears dampened Draco's cheek from Daphne's eyes. He felt her last beats of her heart against his chest, but his own heart was tightly sealed away.
"Ah, yes, ah," Draco started, staying seated, "Snape needs us to… help tutor some of his less successful students."
Theo was most effected, his loyalty of his friendship of Blaise for years now collided with his obedience for his father. Draco knew Mr. Nott to be an unforgiving man, if he was being polite. If he wasn't, Mr. Nott was horrible. Draco had no knowledge of Theo's mother's death, but he wouldn't have been surprised if abuse turned into murder. Theo looked at Draco, begging for guidance. Draco had no pieces of wisdom to give to him.
Crabbe's face lit up in worry, "Is he ok? I only ask because that won't let me see him and he hasn't written to me. I know he isn't one with words you see but-"
Daphne followed him as he crossed the almost empty common room towards the door. "Just think about it," she whispered, squeezing his elbow.
"Well, you're absolutely correct, my inferior intellect detects everything," Draco teased, "that, and, I caught you and Blaise snogging in the Astronomy tower after the Yule Ball."
Severus seemed giant in his anger, this frustration Draco didn't know the source of. Draco didn't know why. Why was Severus gripping the table in such fury that his knuckles were white. His hands were shaking.
Draco was too tired to be angry, his shoulders slumped. He couldn't make mistakes, he knew this, he didn't have that privilege.
He kept his head low as tears boiled behind his eyes. He could feel the shame make his face red. His hands started to shake. Why now? Why was his heart pounding like he had just killed Daphne now and not a week ago? Why were his lungs squeezing the life out of him?
Pansy laid on the couch, taking up the entirety of the furniture with her legs, despite the other students sitting on the floor. No one bothered her,  and Draco didn't blame them Pansy had become a viper ready to strike anyone who set her off.  Pansy stared at the ceiling, her long black hair fanning out across the cushions. She had been there since before dinner, which she probably skipped because Draco hadn't been there to remind her to eat. She was thinning, her uniform already too big for her frame.
“Fuck… fuck, you’re beautiful…” Harry muttered between gasping breaths that shook his entire body. “I fucking love you like this…”
A few of the listeners tittered, and Ron felt a flare of hot anger inside him. They were laughing at his friends, making a game of their suffering and dragging their private lives out for examination. He opened his mouth to protest, but Narcissa got in before him.
Last night, when they had appeared at the gates of the Manor, the first words out of Draco’s mouth were,
“I doubt it.” Forbush rose to his feet and bent over the bed to stare directly into Draco’s eyes. “Hmm. You are reacting very oddly to it. Try to follow my finger.”
Draco blocked out their unwelcome stares, concentrating on the firm pressure of Harry’s hand and the warmth he always drew from his husband’s nearness. He wasn’t ashamed of who or what he was. Wasn’t ashamed to walk hand-in-hand with another man,
In a sudden burst of blind rage, Draco swiped his arm across the tray, sending its contents crashing to the floor in a mess of shattered glass, spilled potions and globs of what looked like shepherd’s pie.
Warmth collected in his chest. Happiness. Gratitude. He was back in a world he knew, a world he loved, that he had thought was lost to him forever.
“That’s not what I meant.” One white hand fluttered up, reaching for him, then fell again. “I was only thinking of the time we’ve lost.”
Hermione takes matters into her own hands and slash ensues (and Ron makes a bet that leaves a bad taste in his mouth).
Back in their office, Harry sat crumpled in his chair, eyes on the desk, going over everything they had learned at the prison. Across from him, Ron was eating stale chips left over from his lunch and drinking cold, tar-black coffee.
investigations are leaked to the Press. I won’t risk that. Not for myself, and not for Draco. My memories of him are extremely personal and would be highly damaging, if made public.”
Draco did not bother to come up with a witty response. Shoving a hand under the pillow, he pulled out the invisibility cloak and let its silver folds spill around him. In a moment, only his head showed above its collar.
“Hogwarts.” Harry turned away to collect the tea things and said, his back to Hermione, “McGonagall summoned him to talk about Felix.”
It wasn’t that the cottage was unsafe—Merlin knew, if Harry’s wards couldn’t keep him safe then nothing could!—or that the house didn’t want him. It was Harry’s house, after all, with Harry’s magic living in the walls. It wanted him the way Harry did. Overwhelmingly.
Draco gave him another steady look, expression guarded, even cautious, then shrugged and headed for the piano that stood to the left of the fireplace. Harry heaved a silent sigh of relief and let himself collapse into the settee cushions.
A shadow suddenly loomed over Draco, and a deep voice said, “This filthy, little wanker giving you trouble, Tom?”
“Candles, mate!” Ron called from somewhere deep inside the branches of the tree. “Don’t think you’re getting out of it!”
Harry, who had stared at him in glum silence through this little exchange, suddenly lurched to his feet. “Of course we are. Just give me a minute.”
He obediently started walking again, pacing up the uneven steps, staggering as Ginny jerked him rudely over the threshold. She shut the door at his back, then turned rueful eyes on him.
Was this how he’d survived bedding half a dozen men or more a night? By walling himself up behind that perfect, porcelain mask? Harry didn’t want to think about it, so he shoved that image away and went back to work.
Draco had gone completely nerveless. He couldn't move, he couldn't think, he couldn't speak. He could only stand there, helpless, as Harry Potter stepped closer to him and brought his mouth down to rest against his. In the instant of that touch, he stopped breathing, perhaps his heart even stopped beating. The world went utterly black, and Draco knew that he had gone finally and irretrievably insane.
Here's a short epilogue for you - a bit of domestic fluff (and a tiny bit of smut) with the Potter family.
Harry glanced back down at the paper, focusing not on the picture this time, but the words beneath it.
“You’re the one who told me to wait,” Warwick pointed out, his voice sly. “You wanted something big enough to break him? Well, you’ve got it. And don’t you worry, I’ll drop that dead pimp on him so hard that it crushes him to powder.”
The Dementor hesitated, confused by the glittering thing that blocked him from his lawful prey, and Voldemort snarled, "Finish it! At once!"
Ron pushed aside a fat roll of parchment and slammed his quill down on the desk. With a groan and a sigh, he stretched his arms over his head until the joints popped, then he thrust his long legs out under the desk and closed his eyes.
“No. By that time, I knew what I’d become and that there was no going back. For awhile, I used Arithmancy equations to block out the worst of it, but that stopped working when Phineas started sharing me with his friends. It was like I was back with my father and the Death Eaters, being passed from hand to hand, but it was
“I am. I haven’t,” Draco grunted, teeth clenched to hold in his cries as Harry worked to open him. It felt glorious, but it also frightened him. The Gryffindor must be as overheated as Draco was himself, because he was barely trying to be gentle.
“Because I’m sick of your excuses and denial. Because I’m disgusted by your Lady of the Manor pose, your fancy fucking tea set, the way you try to make this about me persecuting the poor widow or Draco lying to get back at his father.
The shouts finally penetrated the screams of fury in his head and brought him back to a sense of his surroundings.
Bending down to plant a kiss on Draco’s forehead, Harry murmured, “We’re home, now, love. You can rest.”
"The combined power of the wizards involved and the amount of blood shared. It can be done with only a drop or two, but that creates a weak and temporary link."
"You and Draco both need to become separate people again." Dumbledore said. "I am sorry, Harry, but it is time." He lifted his wand and muttered a spell that Harry could not hear. Then he tapped Draco gently in the center of his chest with the wand. There was a soft popping sound, a brief discharge of scarlet and gold magic, and then nothing.
“No.” Harry’s lips touched his eyelids, then his cheeks, then his mouth. “Because you know that I will always love you and always want you and always,
When he at last came up for air, Harry gazed down at Draco's face and saw that it was flushed and softened, his eyes bright with longing. Harry's own body was in a distressing condition that he knew he would not be able to conceal if he stood or sat up. The realization that he was about a heartbeat away from losing his virginity on the bank of the lake, with the giant squid and half the school likely watching, made his cheeks flame with embarrassment but did nothing to ease the burning in his blood.
Draco, on the other hand, had rolled out of bed and begun his housework without so much as brushing his hair. He looked a fright and knew it. And while some part of him defiantly hoped that his mother recognized to what straits she had reduced her only son with her machinations, most of him was frankly embarrassed to be caught in Muggle joggers and a formula-stained t-shirt by his own mother.
"We need Ron Weasley. He's the only one besides Potter who might be able get through to him in this state."
hot, you git!" Still laughing, he toppled back to lie on the blanket, his body going limp as the last of his tension drained away. "Gryffindors are such babies!"
Duckworth shot Leaming a resigned look, then shrugged and nodded. Leaming pulled his wand, gave it a flick. A pack of cigarettes appeared with a pop and settled onto the table.
Draco took one hitching breath, slipped his arms around Harry’s waist, and began to cry in ugly, tearing, heaving sobs that threatened to rip his body apart.
When Draco gave no answer, just looked from the wand to Potter and back again, he went on, “If the only thing you wanted from me was my protection, then take your wand and go. You don’t need me anymore. But if you want something more… something I can give you… Well, you know how I feel. If I had my way, you’d stay forever...
"See to it, will you please, Minerva? I will talk to Poppy when I can and let you know what we decide to do. But if you will all excuse me," he pushed back his chair and rose to his feet, "I must contact Sirius and tell him to call off the search."
"Hah!" Draco shouted, as he pulled up sharply and rocketed skyward again. Then, to Harry's dismay, he screamed, "
Draco’s hand throbbed angrily, reminding him that his master was listening and didn’t appreciate his defeatist attitude.
Just when the boys think it's all over, Fudge rears his ugly head again. The Ministry goes after Draco for use of illegal magic.
When he had finished with these preliminaries, Fudge dropped the parchment onto the writing desk in front of him and fixed Draco with eyes so full of loathing that Harry flinched at the sight of them.
“Don’t be silly. I don’t hold you or your child in contempt. I only deplore the choices you’ve made and the position you have placed us in. But we can move past all of that, if you will only put aside your anger and remember who you are.”
No one spoke for some time, and Harry wondered just how deep in the forest this glade of the centaurs was. He was getting breathless and tired, and wishing that he had not been so eager to join the expedition, when Firenze came to a halt.
When Draco just looked at him, eyes too large in his pale face, Harry gave him a slight shake. “Right?”
Draco stirred very slightly and, obedient to the pressure of Madam Pomfrey's hand on his shoulder, rolled onto his back. His eyes were open, but they had turned blank and unknowing again and did not focus on any of the faces around him. His face was utterly still, like a marble mask.
“Let me go!” Draco moaned, eyes still shut to block out MacMillan’s looming face and hateful words. “I did what you asked!”
Daphne left quickly, she was already standing when the train stopped. Draco took his time, wanting to stay on the train until it reached the end on the line. He wanted to disappear until he could return to this train, but on the way back to Hogwarts, to Potter. Theo seemed as if he was about to vomit. Blaise couldn't take his eyes off of him.
"Really? Fantastic! We can take our time with the walk then," Potter snapped back, his voice too cheerful.
Weasley had summoned whatever was in the tank into his hands. A brain was now slicing into his flesh with thoughts. Blood pouring out of the gaping wounds.
"Shouldn't you be with the Weasley's? Your shadows will be wondering where you went off to," Draco teased. "Or are they too busy sucking face to notice?"
His father probably seemed ever regal to the outside eye, but Draco knew better. With practiced perfection Lucius had pulled his hair back into a braid, his clothing was perfectly laced and embordered. However, Draco noted that he was leaning more heavily on his cane that he used for his knee. His eyes were dulled and his cheeks had sunken deeper into his face, making his cheekbones almost unnaturally prominent. Do to his carefully tailored robes, the fact that Lucius had lost weight was not hidden. The Dark Lord's presence in Malfoy Manor had taken a toll.
The blood rushed to Draco's head, he couldn't hear his own thoughts. He couldn't put together what his Lord's words meant. Daphne could, and her eyes glazed over as her mind worked through what those words meant.
Mr. Greengrass stared at the floor, his eyes wide and his breath shallow. Daphne's mother started to bawl into her handkerchief. Her husband reached other, taking her hand. Their eyes met, Draco felt conflicted at witnessing such a tender moment between them. They were willing to lay down their lives for their child, finding tranquility in the knowledge of their child living.
"I'll think about it," she sighed, smoke leaving her mouth in one last drag. "Are you going to let me know why you left dinner early?" she asked as she put out her cigarette in the sink behind her.
Theo huffed, but didn't say anything, putting his hand in his hair as he focused on the text. If he started to pull his hair out, Draco wouldn't have been surprised. They had been at this for hours. Draco had been falling behind on his studies because of the late nights spent in Occlumency lessons. He needed help.
His father hadn't known of the warning Draco was given by his mother? What else didn't Lucius know? How many secrets were kept between Draco and his mother without Draco even knowing? Some part of him just assumed that his mother was acting under her husband's agency.
Draco ignored the sights of a family being murdered, the screams echoing within his skull, the blood on his hands. He wrapped and healed Potter's hand as well as he could, but there will be a scar.
He shut his mouth. The time spent in the manor had taught him well. He knew when he was being manipulated. "You don't actually worry about my safety," Draco met their questioning. "Why do you care? Really. We all know I can take care of myself just fine."
He ignored the look Pansy gave him, he also ignored the unsightly gestures she kept making throughout the lecture. His skin was itching to talk to Potter. How was he? Why did he leave Hogwarts early for break? Questions wouldn't leave Draco's thoughts, and he couldn't answer these questions or logically explain them. He was stuck in his own swirl of thoughts and concerns. Draco was forced to pay attention in class. He would compare the experience to pulling his own teeth out with a spoon through his eyes.
But he would. He would because he had to, he didn't have a choice. Draco's feelings slipped away, they were replaced by cold logic. Out of anyone, Daphne would be his first choice for marriage. They were friendly, he had nothing to hide from her. She was attractive, smart and would be a valuable partner. They could make this work. The first child would have to be born within the first year, he could take a job at his father's department at the ministry. Daphne would have to stay home, as was her duty, she would hate it, but perhaps she could take on a career part time to stop the restlessness after the first three were born. How many children were they suspected to have?
Cho had her arms crossed, and was leveling Draco down with a hard stare. He looked away, but he could still feel the heat from her glare. She hated him, that fact was obvious. If she hexed him right now, he wouldn't be surprised.
Draco turned into the direction of the hurried steps that belonged to the annoyance. “What do you want, Potter?” he sneered loudly, while taking notice of the annoying lack of effect it had on the boy in front of him. Potter hurried to catch up with him, his breath quickening. The students within the hall didn't even glance at the pair, who were usually this cordial to each other.
Astoria kept glancing at Draco. He made her uncomfortable, he supposed. She wouldn't enter the compartment, but she wanted something from Daphne. Did Draco's presence stop her? Was she scared of Draco to the point where she couldn't bear to be in the same room as her?
Astoria chunked her goblet at him. Pansy stood and shrieked at her, dripping wet from the splash zone of the tossed goblet. Draco was so thankful for the table between her and Daphne whenever Daphne stood up, followed by her sister. Crabbe started yelling. Everyone using incredibly colorful language, their voices blistering loud.
Draco watched Zabini as he hurried down the hall before turning back to the girl, who was still weeping against the pain. Draco, knowing his reputation, half thought about leaving her, he couldn't have whispers about him around the castle. The sound of a weeping child violated him again, turning his stomach painfully.
Daphne nodded, pulling away from Draco and grabbing her bag. "And I assume Potter knows none of this?" she questioned.
He took a breath, his shoulders relaxed. Daphne's anger had a source, a source which Draco could trace. "Daphne, please, I'm trying my best here," he softened his face, his voice.
The only sound was Draco's spoon scrapping against the bowl. Whenever Draco finally looked up at his silent companion, Potter was just staring at him. Draco suddenly became too aware of their knees brushing together under the table. "You've seen me eat before, I don't know what's the big deal," Draco broke the silence.
Severus was in the back of the class, probably making one of the other students cry. He was out of earshot.
Potter took his seat next to him, still holding his hand. Draco looked at him, Potter was quite stunning. He was almost pretty, with his long dark eyelashes framing his bright green eyes. They were close enough that their shoulders brushed against each other.
Pansy placed her head in her hands, nodding. She was deathly still. Draco rubbed his chin. Mrs. Parkinson certainly worked fast. She must have caught gossip of Draco and Daphne's impending engagement and clawed at the opportuning to rise in society. She would have Pansy marry into a family, or be betrothed, for protection.
"What happened to trust?" Draco questioned, "Let's not play games, we all know that the Dark Lord's connection to Potter goes beyond the bounds of Legilimency."
Draco rubbed the back of his neck, "I'm fucked," he admitted. Theo gave him as sympathetic of a look as he could while eating his toast. "Why didn't you sit with Blaise?" Draco investigated.
Draco sighed, "Potter, you're my best friend." He didn't ask way Potter kissed him. He didn't ask why Potter would act so jealous whenever Draco and Daphne were together. He didn't ask because part of him knew the answer, but he also knew the dangers. Potter only stared at him. "We should work on your technique," Draco stood. "Different methods work for different people, which is why Occlumency isn't taught as a class and Occlumens are so far in between," he lectured, taking his stance. "I want to try a different method for you, when you pushed me from your mind, what did you focus on?" he asked.
To be fair, if Draco had thought about Potter at the wrong time while in the manor, he would be died.
Draco dug the knife into the side of her neck. Her blood was so warm, almost hot has he pulled the knife out. He barely registered the clink as the knife hit the marble floor. Draco held Daphne's wrist so she wouldn't cover the deep slice in her neck.
Pansy would have to appear to be held back by an enviable force, her health perhaps. This was a dangerous line to toe. Whispers are inevitable, but if people suspect Pansy would follow in the pattern set by her father, then the whispers would become gossip, then rumors.  Her health could not suddenly falter without rumors.
"You're the best friend I've ever had," Draco told him, "and I want to help you." Potter swallowed, his breath fanning against Draco's face. Draco leaned in, enough to know that Potter would only look at him, only see him.
"I don't know, he could have you escorted to class, or tell the professors to keep an eye on you or-" Potter stumbled in his ranting. He signed and berried his head in his hands. "Dumbledore stopped our lessons together. I don't know why. I think something is going on and he doesn't trust me to help him handle it-"
"Well…" Theo drew out, "If everyone else is in detention… this is one of the few times we have privacy.."
Pansy stood to collect her supplies, Draco knocked her bookbag to the ground with his elbow. The two bent down to gather Pansy's things that had fallen out of the bag. She didn't say a word to him. Draco tried to ignore how quiet she was being, how scared she seemed.
"Damn it Daphne, this is way we can't have nice things," Draco pretended to scowled her to a classroom full of laughter. The class broke into chatter. Draco looked towards Professor Firenze, who was just staring into the circle of ash. His shoulders slumped, his hands worked together in front of him. He looked twenty years older.
"You did a bit more than punch the boy, Malfoy," Severus noted from the corner in which he leaned against the wall.
"It's not like you can just find someone who is trained in the dark arts and be like, 'Oh, hi! Can you attack me, please?' Where would you even find someone that was trained? The only people I can think of are actual Death Eaters, and I don't see any here," Draco lectured.
Some people believed him. Some people remember how the first war began, the Ministry's concerned with the appearance of control rather than the protection of their citizens. That's how his Mother explained the First War in a hushed voice.
"I can't tonight, Professor, I'm actually booked until May, but I can try to squeeze you in before the end of March."
He entered his shared dorm room, Crabbe and Goyal were sitting together on Goyal's trunk, talking. Theo was reading on his bed. Blaise had already closed his bedcurtains for the night, he was probably asleep. Draco dressed into his sleepwear. He made sure to pull out the note Potter had slipped to him from his uniform robes. Draco turned his back to his dormmates, slipping the note into his locked bedside table where he keeps all of the notes Potter had given him.
Potter huffed, crossing his arms over his chest. That was never a good sign. "Why do you get to tell your friends about us?"
Draco crossed the warm, small room, untying his black cloak and laying the fabric on the cloak rack suddenly provided next to the fireplace. He then place the flat present wrapped in red paper on the low table suppled between the couch and the fireplace.
Do the stars look down on us with more than fascination? If he was a star, if he was destined to look down on earth for eternity, what would make him turn away? The wars? The deaths? The casual cruelty that one could do onto another? Would he turn away from watching children grow up before they should?
Draco turned to him. A painfully fake smile on his lips, "Why? I'm happy for you Potter," he forced.
His breathing was the only sound heard as he walked into a large circular area. Tall ceilings with curved walls made the light from the low torches ribbon across the smooth bricks. Draco's heart clenched. This was what the bottom of the well would look like. He was at the bottom.
Thankfully, they had found each other. Both were being pushed aside by their friends, or having to take on simple abuse. If only there was a way for them to make friends outside of the Slytherin House. Blaise was known for having a sharp personality, and he also had a notorious black widow for a mother. No one was looking to reach out to him for friendship. Bulstrode was just plain aggressive.
Everyone got what they wanted. The Greengrass's were allowed to live, and Draco got to keep a closer eye on Astoria. She had already told her father of his involvement in saving her life, but who else did she tell? Perhaps a well place spell on her memory would help the situation.
A hand ruffled his hair. "You're cute with your hair like that," Potter flattered to Draco's blushing.
"Very good, Mr. Malfoy," a sheer voice broke his thoughts. He looked up at Professor Umbridge, who was standing close to his desk. She was looking over his shoulder at his lines. She was so close that he could smell her sickly sweet perfume. His stomach dropped at her smell, at her smile.
Hermione stared at the blank door, unable to grasp what had just happened. One minute, she and Ron were sitting in the hospital wing, waiting for Harry. The next, they were being hustled out of the room by a frantic McGonagall, Snape was running down the corridor with Draco bundled up in his arms and Harry hanging onto his robe, there was blood everywhere and Harry looked like he'd just been hit in the stomach by the Whomping Willow. Then all three of them had disappeared into the room and the door had slammed in her face.
Ron was disheveled, disgruntled, and thoroughly fed up with Harry’s security measures by the time he reached the cottage. First he had been forced to run the gauntlet of protestors in the Atrium to reach a floo. Then Kreacher had waylaid him the moment he stepped out of the fire in Grimmauld Place, demanding information and reassurance. The poor old elf was in such a state, having heard nothing from either Harry or Draco in days, that Ron actually felt bad for him as he apparated away. Not bad enough to hang around, chatting, but still…
What starts out as a lovely weekend in Hogsmeade goes very wrong, and all Dumbledore's precautions are for naught.
Harry sat slumped in the overstuffed chair, his eyes fixed on the fire, staring blankly at the dancing flames. All around him, the Gryffindors were celebrating the end of term at full tilt, shaking the very stones of the tower with their noise, but Harry did not hear them. He was lost in contemplation of his own stupidity and didn't notice Colin Creevey snapping pictures of Seamus and Lavender snogging, or Neville smoking at the ears from one of Dean's bungled hexes, or Ginny trouncing Dennis so thoroughly at Gobstones that he was soaked from head to foot with foul-smelling goo.
"Was that the Draco Malfoy you know, Severus?" Snape shook his head, his eyes sliding away from Dumbledore's. "I devoutly hope the break is neither complete nor permanent, but we cannot fool ourselves that a good night's sleep and a square meal will cure him."
“That has a nice ring to it.” She slipped an arm through his and gave it a companionable squeeze. “But you’re not a pariah today. After that performance at the gates, you’re a media darling.”
Draco heard footsteps pounding on the floorboards, running toward the kitchen, and came out of his chair just as Harry burst into the room. He didn’t have to ask what had happened. The look of blazing triumph on the other man’s face said it all. Stepping round the table, he moved to meet his husband.
Together, they rifled the drawers, checking every scrap of paper and bit of cloth for anything that might hint at Colin’s identity. Hermione discarded a piece of sticky waxed paper, a bottle of dittany, and a tube of raspberry-flavored lubricant before she located a slender stick of wood at the very bottom of the drawer.
.” Harry caught his hand and squeezed it, then fished an ice cube from the champagne bucket and brought it to Draco’s lips. “Suck on that. It’ll cool you down a little.”
Draco’s smile widened and softened, even as his legs tightened around Harry’s waist. “Just for fun, then?”
He looked up at Hermione, sending a stream of milk onto his left hand when he incautiously moved the pitcher. "Huh?"
Harry’s fingers toyed with his hair, drawing his attention back to his own reflection. He gazed thoughtfully at the fall of silver-gilt around his face, then said, “Maybe I should cut it.”
Potter. The name formed in his fogged and aching head, and Draco wondered idly why it didn't upset him more. Potter. He was lying in bed with Harry Potter, settled comfortably against his back, an arm flung familiarly over him as if his body had known he was there and welcomed him long before his mind figured it out. But now that his mind
Draco did not share his enthusiasm. He burrowed down in the bedclothes and refused to get out until the fire was stoked up and the room a livable temperature. Harry just laughed, kissed him, and bustled over to the nursery to collect the howling Lily. He brought her to the bed and tucked her down in the blankets next to Draco. Then he used a spell to produce a bottle of milk. In moment’s, Lily was slurping happily and Draco’s mood was softening into something like civility.
The sound of the door opening caused Draco to raise his head to catch Potter's expecting eyes. Potter crossed the room to the fireplace, Draco put his book down and stood up, his manners Mother had hammered into his head allowing nothing less. Potter bunched his robe underneath his arm, looking anywhere but Draco. He was dressed in his over-used blue sleepwear. Potter was all bones, his pants only went down to his calves so that his ankles and bare feet poked out. Draco felt awfully overdressed in his school trousers and button-down shirt, his simple black robe hanging over the back of the chair he had been sitting in.
Draco could hear the smirk in her voice, "You mean when you tried to tell me that Quidditch wasn't for pretty girls so I kicked your ass?"
"Don't" Draco snapped. He couldn't be involved, he couldn't be a part of anything that could draw attention to himself. People keep putting the weight of their situations on Draco's shoulders. How long before Draco knelled to the pressure? How was he supposed to care for everyone, when he couldn't even care for himself?
Oh. Of course. Potter only needed him out of necessity, Draco should try harder to remember that. "Of course, what do you need?" Draco agreed easily.
Potter squirmed under Draco's grip, uncomfortable against the wall of the hall. The two boys stared at each other, each waiting to make their move.
Draco turned his focus to Potter and the problem he proposed. What Draco truly did not understand, was Potter’s undying resilience in the face of tragedy. Perhaps, Draco realized as he resumed his walk to class, that was the reason Draco underestimated Potter. True, Potter’s temper snapped more easily than in the past, but he was more observant than ever.
Potter immediately softened his posture, uncrossing his arms, "Sorry…no, I haven't told anyone," he apologized.
"Of course I do," was Potter's response, which Draco only responded with a bored look, Potter wasn't going to get any more information than Draco wasn't ready to give.
Madam Pomphrey was very good at her job, and he should be in full health after a night of rest. Which is why he didn't understand why everyone was fretting over him so.
"Everyone, just calm down," Draco watched has his father raised his hands in a false sign of goodwill. Lucius stepped forward slowly, all while filling Potter's head with lies.
"Goodbye, Montague," he dismissed, "I'll see you in Quidditch practice." Draco turned around, Pansy had collected his bookbag for him. The crowed around him started to dispersed, disappointed.
With his mouth dry, Draco slumped his head into his hands, resting his elbows on his knees. "You're really only observant at the most inconvenient times."
"Draco," Potter gripped Draco's wrist gently, Draco's heart slammed in his chest, "I'm glad you're here."
"Can I help you, Zabini?" Draco warned whenever Blaise took a seat next to him on the couch of the Slytherin common room.
Draco couldn't let him go, his hands still on his face, his thumbs stroking Potter's face. Bile collected at the back of his throat. His eyes started to itch. His chest felt so heavy. Draco wouldn't cry, he wouldn't became another problem for Potter to fix, another burden for him to carry.
His blood ran cold as he began to search for the two initials of the person who was always at the center of trouble.
The class ended too soon and Draco was once again forced to return to the world. He walked with Zabini out of the greenhouse to the castle in their expected silence.
Draco just laid there, blood dripping from his head. His body bruised and sore. The sun was dipping into in the sky when he finally sat up. His head pounded at the movement. The blood was dry on his face. He should make his way back to the manor. He would find his parents then they will be on their way.
"Very well, you may begin," Firenze instructed. Draco had no idea what he was supposed to do. He just stared at the centaur, wishing for death. Professor Firenze raised his eyebrows. Draco slowly shrugged, the class trying to hush their laughter. "Oh, I see," Firenze realized, "The ash will not be hot, you have nothing to worry about."
Draco looked, really looked, at Potter for the first time in months. He hadn’t allowed himself to take in the site of his friend earlier when they had accidentally met a week ago at Borgin and Burkes. He couldn’t risk the danger that would be the consequence of a simple glance. Anything that could give Draco’s feelings for Potter away could have him dead.
"What do you need," she eventually asked with a surprisingly gentle voice, taking a smooth puff. Draco was always amazed at her even temper.
"This is the boy's room," he  pointed out as he turned to her and leaned against the sink next to him.
"No-" she shook her head, stroking her hair, "no, you're not." She rested her chin on the hand, biting her lip. "My mother," she started, shifting in her seat. Pansy wouldn't stop moving, rubbing her chin, biting her nails, messing with her hair, her tie. She was nervously scared. Of Draco?
Draco lifted the table cloth to peak outside and gasped. They were kissing. Potter and Cho, they were kissing. Draco watched as Potter cupped Cho's face.
Harry growled and bent to follow the path of those fingers with his tongue. Draco gasped and arched up toward him. Harry lapped at the head of his cock, tasting the saltiness of his excitement, then took it into his mouth. At the same time, his fingers stroked up Draco’s thighs and over his balls. The smoothness of his skin with no hair on it was enflaming for Harry. Every touch was intensified, every sensation magnified to the threshold of pain. If it was this electric for Harry, he couldn’t imagine how it felt to Draco, who’s every nerve ending was exposed to Harry’s touch.
As he stepped into the entry hall, Minerva McGonagall and Alastor Moody appeared from their places to either side of the front doors. Both held their wands, and McGonagall looked haggard with strain. Moody's face was too heavily scarred to reflect any emotion. Dumbledore gave them a slightly weary smile and headed for the Great Hall.
Dumbledore gave her a swift smile and turned for the door, his hand now holding Narcissa by the elbow. “Come, Iphigenia. We must get back to Hogwarts and begin mustering our forces. Can I rely on you to get word to our supporters here at St. Mungo’s? We need every willing wand we can get.”
Ron’s eyes followed his friends’ shrinking forms. “Better than decent, even after he lost his hand. He and Harry trained for months, until Malfoy was better with three fake fingers than he ever was with his real hand, and he could beat any Seeker in the school except Harry. But he never got the chance to play, because the Slytherins wouldn’t have him.”
“You are so beautiful,” he repeated, stroking Draco’s bruised, sweat-dampened thigh, then reaching up to caress his throat.
“We assault the island in two hours with whatever forces we can muster by then. Our supporters are arriving in Hogsmeade now. I’ve alerted my brother at the Hog’s Head that we’re using it as a command center. It’s more convenient than the castle, with our wards and Anti-Apparition charms in place.”
A ghost of a sneer passed over Lucius’ face, quickly banished. “That boy is family. We care for him. We want to see him thrive and, ultimately, come into his full power. That is not a Pureblood right; it is every wizard’s right.” His eyes cut over to Granger, challenging her. “Is that not why we welcome Half-blood and Muggleborn children into our world? So they can reach their full magical potential and strengthen all of us with their gifts?”
it. But he had fallen off the face of the earth and left Harry to stumble helplessly through his rarified world, looking but never finding, and hurting… always hurting…
He thought about that for a moment, his head down and his face hidden behind a curtain of hair. Then he said, “I want to go home. Alone.” His head came up sharply and he added, “You and me alone, that is.”
Setting aside his tea cup, he slid up tightly against the back of the sofa and patted the wide, satin-covered seat beside him. “Come here, you changeling brat.”
“Tomorrow, you said.” Robards shot him another pointed look, and he added, “’Til I can tell anyone that he’s dead.”
Ignoring Ron, Pigwidgeon, and the chaos they were causing, Harry turned the piece of parchment into the light of the nearest torch and read,
His furious shout echoed through the high-ceilinged room, and they both fell instantly quiet, straining to hear Madam Pomfrey's approaching footsteps. Either the nurse did not hear them, or she decided that they didn't need to be drugged into docility just yet. No one paid them any mind.
“Even if I die at your hand, it will not be you who truly takes my life. It will not be murder.” His eyes pinned Draco with their fierce intensity, while his hand hovered between them. “Do you understand?”
“I know you do.” Ron squeezed his shoulder, then let his hand drop. An awkward flush crept up into his cheeks, clashing dreadfully with his ginger hair and freckles, but his earnest gaze remained fixed on Draco when he said, “I’ll do everything I can to help you get him back here in time, Ferret, but if we can’t… if you need me to… to learn the spells…”
“Go find Teddy. I’m sure he’ll be happy to show you his broomstick. And you’d better leave Mr. Platters with me,” he added, as Bob made to leave. “He’s not interested in brooms.” (Translation: “You’ll lose him in all the excitement, and I’ll have to go crawling under the furniture to find him.”)
because I would miss Malfoy's ferrety face around here if he disappeared again, or because he makes me laugh, or because he annoys the hell out of Seamus, which is a beautiful thing to behold!"
That struck Ron profoundly, as all Harry’s shouting about Malfoy’s disappearance had not. “He’s barefoot?”
Before the footman could lead him into the parlor, another man came mincing through a rear door and crossed the hall toward him, calling, “Mr. Potter! What an honor!”
“I think it’s lovely, dear.” She reached over to pat his hand. “If I’ve told him once, I’ve told him a dozen times, it’s a shame for such a handsome boy to shut himself away out there in that lonely old cottage. I thought my niece might do for him, but I see he had other ideas.”
So many things he could not face. So many questions he could not ask. And always, the yawning hole at his feet, gaping wider with every day that passed, with every scrap of information he gleaned from thoughtless comments dropped in his hearing and the evidence of his sharp eyes. It seemed that the more he learned, the more obvious the hole in his memory became, until he marveled that it did not swallow him up, body and soul.
Draco leaned in to press a kiss to his lips, then, before Harry could say anything, grabbed his wand from the nightstand and hopped off the bed. Harry watched him pad over to the dressing table, his naked body glowing in the half-light of a Summer evening. With a flick of his wand, he lit the lamp standing on the table and sat down in the chair.
Harry felt a momentary impulse to apparate away without removing the spell, thus trapping his in-laws in the room until someone with a little more on the ball showed up to rescue them. But that was petty and beneath him. They hadn’t hurt Draco—this time—and their current plight was grim enough to satisfy even Harry’s sense of justice.
"The library?" she suggested, in a tone of voice that indicated she believed the library to be the solution to every problem.
you again, you have to convince him that he’s wrong. And if you can’t even unlock his door for fear he’ll run away, that’s going to be very hard to do.”
“Okay, you did really well. Kreacher will be pleased.” Potter’s arms didn’t quite close around him, but they slipped beneath Draco’s own to support him, and if a bit of bare skin caressed his under the water… well, neither man said anything. “Just lie quiet, let your body get used to having food in it again, then we’ll wash your hair.”
McGonagall nodded curtly to the remaining Slytherins and stepped through the doors. They watched her go, then looked at each other, all wearing the same half-shocked, half-worried expressions. Finally, they settled down against the wall to wait. None of them followed Gumboil back to the dungeons.
Hermione eyed her fondly. "I don't think you can even carry it, darling. Besides, you'll be too busy settling into Gryffindor Tower to bother with delivering packages."
Draco obediently stripped off his ring and pulled his wand from his pocket, setting them carefully on the table beside him. His fingers were still trembling when he reached for the dragon brooch on his collar, and he had to fumble with it for a moment before he could open the clasp. Then it joined his other belongings on the table. He felt oddly naked, as he let his hands fall to his sides again, in spite of the layers of silk and velvet that covered his body.
The green eyes fastened on her did not waver, but something in them shifted. Closed. Darkened. Then, just as the unusual shadows in her gaze were beginning to trouble her mistress, Lissy nodded and jumped down from the chair. With a click of her fingers, she made the half-eaten sandwiches disappear and started the empty plates drifting into a neat stack.
“We had them in our garden when I was a child,” Draco offered, just to be polite, “but the peacocks always ate them.”
Some of the enthusiasm drained from her face, and she turned pleading eyes on her father. "Why can't you come with me?"
“And he taste-tested it,” Draco said, “to make sure I didn’t accidentally poison all of you.” His voice sounded unnaturally rough to Harry, betraying his nerves, but it was notably missing its habitual aristocratic drawl. “Happy Christmas, Mrs. Weasley.”
Draco looked away, his eyes suddenly hot with tears. He was about to humiliate himself, but he could see no avenue of escape. He was trapped in this chair, under Molly Weasley’s gaze, on the verge of bawling his eyes out over a grudging compliment.
His partner frowned in concern at his outburst. Neville rarely swore, and a weak “Merlin’s beard!” was about as explosive as he ever got. He couldn’t remember the last time an actual curse had passed his lips, but he was rapidly growing desperate. He needed Harry.
“Don’t care…” Draco was having increasing trouble speaking clearly or keeping his thoughts in order. His tongue felt thick and clumsy. “Don’t like your magic. It… feels wrong.”
It came from his heart. He knew that instinctively. He could feel a difference in the way his heart was beating - more slowly and more forcefully - as it pumped his lifeblood and his power out through the walls of his body toward the dying boy who needed them so desperately. When he turned his thoughts in that direction, he found it instantly. A thick, gleaming, blood-red stream flowing out of his chest.
Silence gripped the crowd, as the wizard stared cross-eyed at the point of Harry’s wand leveled at his nose. He gulped. His cheeks paled. His hand opened and closed, as if eager for a wand of its own to grasp. Then he sullenly stepped aside and pulled his wife with him.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Ron grabbed his arm and dragged him unceremoniously into their office, muttering, “He’s a prick. Ignore him.”
The little boy crawled into his arms. Pressed up against his side until he was draped over his tremendous belly. Wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck and burrowed his face into his shoulder. And Draco could breathe at last.
Turning in a swirl of bright robes, he propped himself against Tidsworthy’s desk and struck a casual pose, ankles crossed, hands braced on the desktop. Then he cocked an eyebrow at the confused witch.
Warwick smiled in satisfaction. “You ever work a suspect this way, MacMillan?” he asked, eyes still on Draco. “With sleep deprivation and physical stress?”
A Stinging hex struck him in the back, bringing his head around with a snap to find a ring of startled faces turned on him. Robards stood just inside the ring, wand raised, features hard with fury.
Draco shifted slightly to free his left arm so he could hold the baby in both hands. Then, with Ron’s help, he shifted her up closer to his head and laid her against the pillow. She squirmed and fussed, declaring to the room at large that she was hungry and not at all happy about it, but Draco only smiled at the noise. He cradled her head in his adamant hand, making sure she didn’t roll from the bed in her outrage, and touched her face gently with his flesh-and-blood fingers. His eyes, blind as they were, and dulled by sickness, shone with happiness.
Duckworth was obviously the one in charge. He had a veneer of easy authority and professional courtesy over a deep well of suspicion that seemed to embrace all wizard-kind. Clearly, the man had been doing this job too long. The younger one, Leaming, was merely exhausted and annoyed, wishing he were at home in bed rather than conducting interrogations at this ungodly hour. Neither showed any overt hostility, but Draco was too wise in the ways of Aurors to take this at face value. Hatred and violence could lurk under the most benign exterior.
“Sometime that isn’t tonight.” He glanced down at Draco and smothered a sigh. His dragon looked so pale and ethereal, as if he weren’t entirely there in his oversized, grey-white clothing, bare feet and waist-length curtain of platinum hair. His eyes looked too large for his face and his skin was nearly transparent. In fact, he looked more like a ghost or a Patronus than a living, breathing man.
Both of Draco’s brows rose up nearly to his hairline. “I’ve been hit with the Imperius and Cruciatus Curses many times. The only one I haven’t experienced firsthand—though I’ve seen it used—is the Killing Curse.”
“Of course I did. You don’t think I’d take anything that comes out of the Ministry on faith, do you?”
“Yeah, but it wasn’t you hanging from the ceiling,” Fred protested, as a grudging smile began to twitch at his lips.
“That’s why I wanted to tell you now. I don’t think she’ll say anything, but I wanted you to have all the facts before…”
Draco bit his lip ’til blood filled his mouth but did not vomit. Slowly, he felt heat crawling through his body, thawing his chilled limbs, flushing under his skin, quickening his blood. He blinked, and the room around him solidified. Took on color. He breathed out and felt warmth in the air that passed his lips.
like himself. He took a sip from the pint that Brant conjured for him and leaned back, trying to relax.
Draco's eyes opened again and fixed thoughtfully on Harry's face. Something inside of him had unclenched, a door opened, a wall dropped. And for the moment, his eyes were completely clear. "Of course I do."
"All right." Harry's voice went flat with the effort of controlling himself, and he still could not look at Ron when he said, "Draco's going into the Pensieve."
Draco lifted a tentative hand to touch Harry's face, and the other boy turned to press his lips into his crystalline palm. Draco knew that he had no nerve endings in his hand, but he couldn't control the shiver of pleasure that went through him at Harry's touch or convince himself that he had not felt it.
Answer my questions directly and honestly, without profanity, personal attacks or diversions. I won’t ask a question twice. And I will take a lie as proof of your guilt. Do you understand me?”
Draco handed him the comb, and Harry hopped off the bed to circle around the end of it. When he came to a stop behind Draco and clambered onto the mattress again, the other boy craned his neck to peer over his shoulder and demanded, "What are you doing?"
“It is,” Granger answered, her voice tight with a contempt she would not show openly, “and somehow they all seem to reach that full potential without magical inheritances to bolster their power.”
He took his time getting ready, lingering in the bathroom for far longer than it took to brush his teeth and put on his St. Mungo’s pajamas. Sure as he was that he belonged in that huge tester bed with Harry, he still needed time to screw his courage to the sticking place. Always assuming that he had any courage to screw.
Home. He had once thought of Hogwarts as his true home, but now he knew better. It was not stone walls or talking portraits that held his heart. It was a slender, cold, bright-haired boy whose beauty left him breathless and whose passion sent him reeling. Draco Malfoy was all the home he needed, all the happiness his soul craved. Draco, who never spoke the word
He got his fingers over the lip of the window, but he could not drag himself up to it. He flailed and kicked, tearing his knees on the rough stone, then fell back to the floor, still sobbing and shouting. No one answered him or came to investigate. The dementors were nowhere near and, from the sound of it, all the Death Eaters were busy outside. Now was the time to break out, if there ever was one, but he had no wand with which to spell open the locks. Not even Malfoy’s adamant hand. He was stuck in this foul cell, while Hermione was screaming for help and Ferret was freezing to death, and Harry was…
There it was. The bald truth staring him in the face. He could save Draco from his parents but only by breaking his trust.
The body floated gracefully upward, halting abruptly when Draco's fingers refused to let go of the grass. Harry quickly grabbed his right wrist and pulled, freeing his fingers from their death grip on grass and earth. Then he lifted the arm and crossed it over Malfoy's body. The left hand came away with a tug, but Harry found it strangely heavy, and he dropped it twice before he finally managed to fold it over the right one. He frowned over this but said nothing to Hermione. In a moment, they were hurrying over the grass, their way lit only by the blue glow of the wand fire, the night gibbering with unseen terrors all around them.
Harry felt her lips press to his cheek in a motherly kiss, and he uttered a low, ragged sob. In the next instant, he fastened his arms around her plump waist and buried his face in her neck, hugging her as hard as his arms could manage, while she alternately chuckled and sniffled in his ear.
“Greyback was there, too. He howled and wanked himself and said… said I belonged to him… and my f-fucking father
"I spoke at length with his healer at St. Mungo's," Dumbledore cut in soothingly, "a most sensible woman by the name of Iphigenia Fox and an old friend of mine, as it happens."
Harry glanced around the ward. He saw people lying in a few of the beds - witches and wizards injured in the battle, he supposed - and Madam Pomfrey bending over someone in a bed at the far end of the room. Two other people stood near her, and from the shock of red hair on one of them, Harry gathered that it was Ron. The room was far from empty, but no one was paying any attention to them.
“We can always explain away bruises, but Veritaserum leaves traces we can’t hide. Trust me.” He clapped MacMillan on the shoulder and turned back toward the table. “I know what I’m doing.”
“You were out of your mind,” Harry whispered against his forehead, eyes clenched shut against sudden tears.
Ron edge along the side wall of the central well, trying to get close to Dumbledore and attract his attention, but he needn’t have bothered. Moody stumped right out into the middle of the floor, just in front of the cruel chair, and bellowed, “All present and accounted for, Dumbledore!”
“Come sit down. Share this lovely tea with me. You worked so hard on it, it seems a shame to let it go to waste.”
“No, no, not like that! The little ones go at the top, like that! Honestly, ’Mione, were you raised by wolves?”
“Bloody fucking hell, Ron!” His eyes snapped open to fix accusingly on his partner. “This is Draco, we’re talking about! My husband! How did they think they would get away with
Dumbledore nodded in satisfaction. "He needed to commit himself and to let go for awhile. Just let him rest, for now." Then the old wizard laid a hand on Harry's shoulder and bent close to whisper, "You've done well, Harry. Very well. Thank you."
, since they had such an obsession with the family line staying pure, which is thoroughly disgusting and
"Guess it's none of my business, but the Slytherins aren't gonna like it much. I'll see you around, Malfoy."
Dumbledore spoke up, his voice mild but his face implacable. “Does that sound like the treatment of a willing captive?”
Dead silence met his words. No one moved, until Tidsworthy called, “Go on, then! Don’t make Mr. Potter repeat his instructions!”
They settled down to enjoy themselves, stuffing scones slathered in clotted cream and strawberry preserves into their faces, then washing them down with tea. Draco honestly thought he had never tasted anything better in his life—except maybe for Harry’s lips with cream and strawberries smeared all over them. He privately vowed to drag his husband here at least once a week for an orgy of eating and snogging.
“Was it your idea to let the werewolf who had brutally raped him as a teenager watch while it happened again? Did you think it was
He was still laughing when they reached the master bedroom and he spelled the door shut behind them. Draco was still scowling, but he knew as well as Harry did why he’d followed him up there, and that certainty was already softening the annoyance in his face, filling him with warmth and hunger for something more than pancakes.
“Git,” Harry breathed on a low laugh. Then he closed the distance between them, bringing their mouths together, slipping his tongue between Draco’s lips to claim him with a long, alcohol-flavored kiss.
“Is it all right to let her run around this house unattended?” Granger asked dubiously. “She won’t dig up some Dark artifact and get herself cursed?”
Harry gave a shout of laughter, then sobered when he realized that Draco was serious. “I’m a half-blood, Draco. My mum was Muggle-born.”
Soon, tissue paper, ribbon, glass balls, tiny candles, and scraps of gold foil were scattered all over the rug and settling into the cushions of the chairs. Boxes cluttered the floor and made walking hazardous. Rose was gabbling and grabbing at every shiny object that came under her eye, and Ron was bossing Hermione around in a way that Harry rarely heard.
He glanced around, realized that all the available seats were piled with laundry, and used his wand to lift a stack of neatly-folded shirts from the most comfortable armchair. Andromeda swept over to the chair and placed herself in it with all the aplomb of a visiting monarch. Then she nodded at the bassinet that sat at one end of the sofa.
Mr. Weasley squeezed his arm in a fatherly way and said, "We're grateful you weren't hurt in the ambush, my boy. Dreadful business. Quite appalling. But Narcissa is under lock and key, so she won't be troubling you again."
“I couldn’t go in.” His low voice took Harry by surprise and sent his brows scaling up under his fringe. “I meant to. But when I got here, I just… couldn’t.”
“Felix.” The boy turned his limpid eyes and the full force of his Veela magic on Harry, only to be met by a far more forceful gaze than his three-year-old self could possibly muster—even in full-on Veela Mode. Harry gave him his best stern, fatherly look, completely unmoved by the Allure hanging like heavy perfume in the air, and stated, “You are not to talk Gamma Molly into letting you on a broom, do you hear me? In fact, you are not to
“My point is that there are procedures to follow. One is that they don’t send Aurors to Azkaban until they’ve been convicted of a crime. Another is that they have to find actual
“It’s not complicated, Granger.” His eyes cut over to the reporter. “Or sinister. All of my best memories of childhood are tied up in these grounds. The lake, the woods, the stream that runs through the willow grove. Wildflowers in the tall grass. Frogs croaking in the fountains. Thestrals flying over the trees in the evening.” He smiled fleetingly at Harry. “Snow frosting the grass at Christmas. Those are the things I love about this place. The Malfoys are gone. The Manor is gone. But the gardens are still here and still as beautiful as they ever were. I want to keep them beautiful, keep them growing, and share them with everyone in our world who’s willing to step through these gates.”
Hermione sighed and threw him a faintly embarrassed look. “Ron told me about your request to join the Unmentionables.”
Dumbledore gave Harry a smile that told him the old wizard wasn’t fooled for an instant. He knew that Harry had censored himself. “Be that as it may, he’s Draco’s father. I’m obligated to tell him what happened to his son.”
She had no idea how long she sat there, clutching Crookshanks and waiting for the Dementors to find her. It may have been hours, or it may have been only minutes before warmth and life began to flow through her numb body again. The light from the open doors above was still dim and shrouded, but the air was marginally warmer. The clutch of terror on her eased, and Crookshanks relaxed into a purring, furry donut on her lap. Hermione collapsed back against the wall, breathing in great, shuddering gasps.
“So, get inside me, you prat.” That earned him a groan and an eye-roll. “You walked right into that one,” Draco informed him smugly.
As gently as he could with the deadweight of a fully grown man in his arms, Harry moved up to the side of the antique tester bed that stood opposite the fireplace and lowered Draco down to sit on the mattress. Draco’s legs folded without resistance. His hands fell to the coverlet at his sides, lying with his fingers curled helplessly. Without Harry’s chest to support it, his head drooped forward and his hair fell over his face in a tangled curtain.
when I should have been here with you, I thought we deserved a day together just, you know, doing what we like.”
His dragon looked as if he’d been dying by slow inches for weeks, instead of partying in his parent’s gracious mansion. His skin was grey-tinged and nearly transparent, his bones showing starkly beneath it, his cheeks and temples sunken into purple hollows. A permanent frown pulled down the corners of his mouth and cut new lines into his face. Even his gorgeous, silver-gilt, angel’s hair looked oddly lifeless, as if his dying body were sucking the vitality out of it in a desperate bid to save itself. But worst of all were his eyes. Harry flinched when he looked into them, shocked by the depth of suffering he saw beneath the dulled silver.
Dumbledore rose to his feet with an ease that belied his grey beard and lined features. As he let go of Malfoy's arm, Harry got a quick look at it and felt his stomach turn over. The burns caused by the bracelet were blistered and raw, bloody in places, and Harry fancied he could catch a whiff of cooked flesh in the air.
When Luna started in on healing properties of Moonstone, Draco decided that he’d had quite enough—of Lovegood’s well-intentioned idiocies and of Ginny’s far less innocent ribbing. He politely but firmly detached himself from the two women, soothing his conscience with the certainty that they would amuse each other far more effectively than he could. Then he fled to the lake to visit the Grindylows.
Harry digested this in silence. He recognized the truth of it and couldn’t fault Kingsley for trying. But it didn’t change the essential fact that Draco was in no condition to face the Aurors who had brutalized him or to bare his savaged soul to a hostile Wizengamot. It simply wasn’t possible.
They scattered, pushing through the door, grateful to be spared the Dark Lord’s wrath for the present and anxious to do his bidding. Voldemort strode out last, his snake-like face impassive, but a potent mixture of rage and anticipation rolling off of him in waves. Potter was coming, the stars were aligned, and victory would soon be his.
“Yeah.” Then, on an irrational impulse to defend the beast, simply because it was Snape insulting him, he added, “It was Crookshanks who found Malfoy. He’s very smart for a cat, even if he is kind of a… hideous creature.”
“How is Malfoy?” Ginny asked. She sat across the table from him, with Dean beside her, and at her question, all of the Gryffindors in hearing fell still, listening.
When he returned to the common room, it looked as though no one had moved. He walked over to McGonagall and held out the bundle of silvery fabric, his hands surprisingly steady. She took it with an apologetic look, tucked it under her robe and turned to leave.
The bed was empty. Harry’s gaze swept the room, even as he stepped into it and closed the door gently at his back. He just had time to register a thin, pale figure in oversized pajamas, cloaked in platinum hair, standing in front of the hearth with his back to the door. Then the snick of the latch broke the utter quiet and brought the bright head around with a snap.
Ron strolled into his office, a half-eaten chocolate biscuit in one hand, a paper cup full of milky-sweet tea in the other. He was humming tunelessly, munching on his biscuit, thinking about everything he’d learned at St. Mungo’s that morning, not bothering to look round at his familiar office. The last thing he expected was to be pounced on by an hysterical Neville Longbottom.
Draco was dying for a fag. After more than two hours locked in an ugly, cold, blank-walled room somewhere in the bowels of the Ministry, with nothing to eat or drink, nothing to cover his bare arms, and no hint as to why he was here, his stress was approaching explosive levels. Only the visceral pleasure of putting a cigarette to his lips and drawing its burning smoke into his lungs could possibly relieve that stress, and he would gladly blow half the Auror force to get his hands on one… if only they would give him the chance!
Soon Draco was grunting with every breath, every thrust. He threw his head back, eyes closed and lashes twitching, mouth falling open. Harry took one look at him and felt his heart crack.
