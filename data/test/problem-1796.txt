“What are you talking about? After you’ve made me a father?” Draco asked in a whisper while his grip on her sides tightened ever so slightly, “How could I not?”
Harriet had let go of all the pain and all of the doubt and all of the fear that she had been holding onto as she laid back and enjoyed the gentle affection that her alpha lavished upon her.
Baby Scorpius oohed at the shining object, which caused laughter to erupt around the room.
Thank you so much for choosing to place your baby with our family! Out of all the other couples you could have chosen for your child’s adoption, we are honored that you selected us! While we respect your decision to remain anonymous to our new son or daughter, you are always welcome in our lives anytime! Please look for the official forms in the mail soon!
Using one hand, Draco smoothed out his black silk tie before he very warily knocked on the door.
Draco seemed glad to see his father. Lucius appreciated the way that Draco looked over at him as if he were waiting for his direction, just as he had when he was a small boy.
Draco moved with her and she started to find it irritating, the way he kept his eyes locked worriedly onto her face as if he expected her to fold over on the bed, collapse, and be sick.
They would be even more disappointed in her than they already were.
—————————————————————
The travel planner had sent the Malfoys to Siren’s Slip, a couples-only exclusive resort for the posh and worldly members of the wizarding world. The luxurious escape was built close to but concealed from some of the exclusive, similar muggle destinations in the beautiful Maldives.
She felt like she had come back from some strange, far away place to a foreign body.
“No, I…..I need to be excused. Pardon me.” Draco murmured under his breath as he laid one hand on his chest and rose from his seat.
As time began to pass though and Draco watched his parents start to age, he thought about life more carefully.
Would they be more like her or more like Draco?
While Draco zipped around the stadium, flashing his confidence along with his green and white uniform, Harriet searched and searched.
In fact, Harriet felt so safe and so at ease that her body accelerated its work.
“Hello, Miss Potter? This is Langston Borrow, your attorney?” A voice came from the other end.
Harriet said nothing about wanting another baby, but she welcomed Draco full heartedly as they kissed and touched until he had sheathed himself within her.
Draco had watched her with Rose, she was careful and kind. Harriet didn’t hate children or the idea of a family, but it was a weakness she didn’t want to allow.
Draco’s motions would have felt even lovelier if she had been in her nest instead of on the concrete floor with only a foam practice mat to support her aching body.
The squeezing agony gave Draco her memory back.
Slytherin gained a twenty point lead on Gryffindor.
Draco was frightened he’d angered her by telling her friends they had mated, but that wasn’t what made Harriet weep.
Despite Draco’s valiant attempts at protecting his mate and pup, Harriet hadn’t looked after herself and the baby properly.
Draco counted the days until he got to meet his daughter, but he also agonized that the birth was becoming increasingly nearer.
Draco reeled in his fantasies, although from the way Harriet melted in his arms and happily returned his kiss, it was probable that the omega would have gladly accepted his advances.
When Draco’s child was born, Harriet’s name would go on the Malfoy family tree.
Narcissa didn’t particularly want Hermione in her home but Hermione didn’t care, she had fought beside Harriet for seven long years in grueling battles.
Draco was surprised when Harriet knotted her fingers in his hair and locked him in place as something sweet and thin filled his mouth.
Harriet moaned again less than a minute later and Draco took the silent nod from the midwife as he coaxed Harriet, “Come on, love, push again for us.”
“Oh, yes. H-How are you?” Harriet said dismissively. As she held the phone, she stumbled while blackness edged at the corners of her vision.
The exam room they were shown to didn’t look all that different from one at St. Mungo’s, though there were several pieces of bizarre-looking equipment that Draco had never seen before.
“Correct again, Granger,” Draco drawled mockingly.
Harriet looked at the woman and nodded in understanding. Draco leaned over and squeezed Harriet’s hand bracingly as he watched the muggle doctor coat Harriet’s abdomen in…...whatever that substance was.
Draco imagined Harriet full and round as she carried their little one, needing his help and care…..
Harriet was irreplaceable in her new career.
Ron wore a bright grin and Hermione put her hands on her cheeks as she looked on excitedly.
It was convenient for Draco that he had parents who were so willing to help, because most of his attention had to be focused on Harriet.
Draco scowled at his mate as she sat the letter back down where she had found it and crawled into bed.
“Would you please stop being ridiculous, Malfoy? I’m not going to need it!” Harriet snapped before she disappeared.
Since Draco was directly behind Harriet, she didn’t see him move his arm out to the right during one of the camera’s flashes while the photographer snapped his shots.
Draco Malfoy was always deeply offended when he didn’t get his way, but this was different. This time, his wealth and status didn’t guarantee him a solution. Although Draco’s father had clearly heard about his current plight, nothing had changed.
“All I want to do is protect you both, surely you can’t fault me for that, Potter?” Draco purred as he bent his head and pressed another loving kiss to Harriet’s soft skin.
Harriet jerked away from Draco so hastily that he jumped. He had been so focused on comforting his unborn that he failed to notice the baby’s mother had woken.
Harriet went to walk away from Draco but he quickly moved his hands to hold his wife’s hips firmly but gently in place.
“So is twelve.” Harriet shrugged as the midwife made some notes, “We’re going to be fine, love, don’t worry.”
“........That’s fine.” Harriet said after a long moment of holding her jaw clenched and her eyes closed.
The midwife had told the Malfoys that she could infer the gender of their baby when Harriet was fourteen weeks along.
“.........What are you doing?” Harriet asked nervously.
“Miss Potter?” Harriet heard her attorney ask but the phone fell out of her hand and she didn’t bother to try and grab it.
There was a noise, a loud, irritating noise.
“Love you, Potter.” Draco sighed happily.
————————————————————
Perhaps she should have taken the time to practice like her husband had?
She closed her eyes for a second and wrapped her arms around her little boy as she ran her fingers through his pale hair lovingly before he asked, “You and Dad will write to me when the babies come, won’t you?”
Draco sat on the muggles’ sofa and thought for a moment, with his face puckered as if he were in terrible agony.
Whenever Ron or Hermione mentioned Rose or their new baby, whenever Ron laid his hand on Hermione’s belly, whenever Hermione talked about her pregnancy, Draco had to resist the urge to hex them both out of desperate jealousy.
Softly and sweetly, their kiss continued, apprehensive and surprisingly innocent.
When Draco rolled them both over and took control of his mate, the cries of Harriet’s bliss echoed from his room and carried down the halls of Malfoy manor.
Beaters from both sides were busy trying to keep the bludgers away and the keepers were doing their best to defend their team’s rings.
What better way to get Harriet excited about welcoming their little one?
He respectfully stepped back while Harriet and Draco looked over the images and decided which photographs they most preferred.
Hogwarts cordially invites you both to play in the alumni quidditch game, which will be held on the last weekend of the next month.
Narcissa closed the door as she left and Harriet and Draco stared at each other in dismay for a moment before Harriet laughed and pecked Draco’s lips.
“.......It seems that way.” Draco whispered quietly.
When Draco saw his omega visibly relax under his touch, that made him smirk again.
Just a few days more and she would ask for some time off.
Harriet stared up at him and in return, Draco flashed a wolfish grin that was filled with early triumph.
Harriet didn’t know the intricate details, but she was aware of Caesarean sections and what they involved.
—————————————————————
Draco followed the Auror secretary for what seemed like hours but was in all actuality probably only a moment or two as they dashed down the hallway, rode the lift to another floor, then took a turn and went in the opposite direction down an entirely different corridor.
A baby?
Lucius stood and gazed at his wife for a moment, watching the fire of determination that burned in her icy blue eyes. Over two decades had gone by since their marriage but Narcissa hadn’t dulled a bit over the years, not her beauty, not her flame.
Now that she had revealed the surprise to her husband, she didn’t need to fight against her instincts anymore.
“I’m the mother.” Harriet snapped, snatching the photograph out of Draco’s hands, “It’s my choice, Malfoy.”
Draco would have noticed the way she craved sugar and consumed everything from fruit to chocolate in vast amounts.
Approaching the situation with gentleness hadn’t worked out very well for the Malfoy heir.
Harriet breathed a silent sigh of contentment as she felt the outer echoes of sleep’s peaceful void ebbing at the edges of her closed eyes……
Wordlessly, Draco stomped over and sat at Harriet’s bedside once more.
Fleeting and precious.
Draco sucked in a breath as he gasped, “What do you mean you don-?!?!?!”
A contraction gripped Draco’s middle that was so intense her teeth chattered and she sucked her breath in sharply, abandoning her fight to breathe calmly. When she felt that pain give way to a crushing vice of deep pressure, she opened her mouth and called out for her husband as dampness trickled between her legs.
Draco didn’t know how to answer the doctor’s question and he looked over at Harriet to place the decision in her hands.
The youngest Malfoy was in such a deep sleep he didn’t even notice the creaking sounds that came from his parents’ bed.
Harriet’s cheeks filled out along with the other places in her body that had been impacted by her sudden and rapid weight loss. As her appetite grew, Scorpius began to fill out too, and his parents along with the healer and the midwife were pleased with the baby's steady growth.
The only problem was her stupid, thick bathrobe.
Draco hadn’t given it a second thought since they returned.
It felt good~.
“That’s right, Potter, I’m quite pleased~. You’re even more beautiful than I recall.” Draco smirked as he kissed across her left hip.
He knew he had spoken wisely when Harriet turned her head and shot him a glare.
“They weren’t supposed to be here until this afternoon!” Draco retorted angrily.
“Everyone will see us together...me, like this.” Harriet said, gesturing to her belly.
Draco didn’t know.
By the time she had the baby bundled into a blanket, Draco was waiting anxiously with his arms outstretched.
Draco looked at his reflection in the mirror and sighed to himself while the house elves finished their task of readying him for what was really his second wedding.
They’d have to exchange the dresses and make a few alterations with the nursery, that was true, but those were minor annoyances, that was all.
“You weren’t even in heat!” Draco snapped.
Harriet held onto his arm while she watched her new husband place his signature on the document before he handed it over to her.
“M-May I not stay with her?” Draco asked with a frown.
It really wasn’t that big of a deal.
Harriet had spent most of the duration of Draco and Ron’s conversation explaining to Hermione what had happened and the true, disturbing details of her alpha’s new behaviors.
That first nap that Harriet took after they arrived back at Malfoy manor was splendid.
On the bed, in front of Draco, Harriet groaned quietly while another pain started in the base of her belly. As it grew in intensity, Draco frowned in sympathy while Harriet panted. To try and ease her discomfort, Draco took up massaging her back again.
Harriet said nothing, but she scowled at him angrily.
She woke every two hours and insisted that Draco take her again, whining until he gave her relief.
His grey eyes widened at who he saw in front of him.
“The healer said that making love could start you into labor.” Draco reminded his mate.
Once Draco pulled away from Harriet’s nipples, he covered her head to toe in a barrage of possessive, nipping kisses as he pried her nightdress and panties off despite her previous shyness.
Draco wondered why his mother was so mindful of her grandson with her tone after she had pounded on their door like an interrogation officer from the Ministry.
It was the evening on which Harriet informed her husband that their efforts had once again proven unsuccessful.
It was his first time venturing into the muggle world and so far, it was not at all to his liking.
With Harriet and Draco’s permission, their family portrait, one of the photographs without Draco’s suit jacket open, was published in The Daily Prophet, along with a formal, public statement from the wizarding world’s most unlikely couple.
Draco stared at one photo, then the one underneath that one, and the one underneath that…….
The sneer of irritation on his pale face only grew once he saw who stood on his front step.
When Harriet finally calmed down and her tears turned into happy laughter, Draco smirked victoriously.
“Draco!” Harriet snapped.
Draco vowed to himself that whatever he had to do, it wouldn’t be what happened to Harriet.
Draco tried to keep Harriet on a healthy diet but as her cheeks started to glow and her belly grew rounder with each passing day, he could never refuse her when she asked for a specific treat, no matter its sugar or fat content.
Once mother and baby were cleaned and stable, Harry apparated them to St. Mungo’s for a postpartum exam.
Draco had grown tired of sitting through Lucius’s many lectures about how important it was that the Malfoy-Potter wedding honor the ancestors of both house Malfoy and house Black.
It took every ounce of restraint that Draco had to refuse her advances. Some alphas thought their mates looked so different that they were no longer attractive but Draco didn't understand that mentality at all.
His heart pounded with the terror that Harriet would reject him yet again as he held her close and kissed her lips, whispering, “We’re a family now~. Don’t fight me, you know it’s true.”
Scorpius hadn’t hindered his parents’ intimate life in the least.
“WWWWWWAAAA!”
The resort was truly luxurious.
She could still pursue her dream and Draco could stay home and raise his own. He could even take their baby with him to his office.
Potter,
Her voice cracked with pain as she wailed at her alpha, “Don’t you think that I want to choose some things for the baby?!?!”
—————————————————————
“I…….” Harriet started to speak.
Instead of focusing on the verbal cues or the hushed reactions from the many onlookers, Harriet and Draco stared into each other’s eyes and concentrated on themselves.
Now all he had to do was win her love.
Less than two minutes later, Harriet sat back against a mound of pillows, clutching Draco’s hand in one of her own as she listened to him coach her on her breathing.
Draco didn’t know how long he and the Auror secretary sat on that bench beside each other in a tense silence.
On the last night of their holiday, one of the couple’s lengthy kisses ended with Draco holding Harriet against the wall of the infinity pool while he moved his hips against hers, but it was better then, there was no need to conceive anymore, there was only love.
—————————————————————
Harriet contacted her lawyer and officially submitted her request to retract the adoption. Though processing the paperwork would take some time, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind that Harriet’s request would be granted. The Roberts family harbored no hard feelings towards the young couple and wished them all the best, assuming they were intent on raising their child together.
That letter had been folded in half, with a picture of a lovely muggle couple inside, with two little children in front of them.
Draco himself was battling the urge to weep bitterly as he sat his omega down on a bench outside and let them both collect themselves for a moment.
“It’s dinner time.” Draco informed his wife as Lily raised a chubby fist to her mouth, “Mother, Father, and Scorpius are waiting. Come on, you need to get out of bed and walk for a while. The healer said it would help, remember?”
“I could still conceive.” Harriet replied in a hushed whisper as Draco sat back on his knees and watched her spread her legs to welcome him, even while she feigned apprehension.
In his haste, drunk on his own gains, Draco had neglected to mention in his letter to Lucius and Narcissa the intricacies of his complicated relationship with Harriet.
“Thank you for your help, sir, but I think I can remember it well enough.” Harriet said politely.
“I actually had a good time, shopping with you in the muggle world today.” Draco smirked.
He walked over to Harriet and stood in front of her as she held Rose against her chest.
The Malfoy heir was having trouble dealing with that.
Draco blinked incredulously.
Narcissa was delighted with her grandson and even Lucius took his fair amount of turns holding the latest addition to his prestigious family.
Open surgeries were for the most part, muggle undertakings.
While the reporters stood and blinked in confusion, Draco collected the parchments they had scribbled on and threw them into the flames that were cradled by the heavy, stone fireplace at the front of the room.
Some thought it was scandalous.
It was in the way!
Baby Scorpius didn’t see the way Draco smirked at how his new wife so readily bent over on all fours just for him.
Harriet flipped through a few of them while the elderly woman spoke. She didn’t know what she had been anticipating, but Harriet was amazed at how warm and kind the Malfoy’s midwife seemed to be.
Draco remained sensitive to Harriet’s needs. He always let her lounge about before and after their training periods on class days, but whether or not Harriet continued to allow him into her heart, every day brought Draco closer to fatherhood.
When she looked over at him, she wasn’t sure whether to laugh or cry at the look of grave concern on his face.
The classes had said that nursing helped omegas relax with their babies and would help cultivate a sense of safety and peace, but as he looked on at his omega and their son, the anxiety that was ingrained into Harriet’s features frightened Draco.
He was preparing to ask what she was doing, but then he noticed…….she was waiting.
Draco had no idea what a Caesarean section was…….
Draco’s thoughts were interrupted when a hard, low cramp gripped her abdomen, spreading to wrap around her body.
That scent, so sweet, so intoxicating……..it made his pulse pound and his manhood throb in his trousers.
“.....Well, I have to get ready for work…..so…. I’m afraid you’ll have to let go of me now.” Harriet yawned.
Draco had painstakingly monitored Harriet’s diet and he followed all of the instructions the midwife had given him on how to care for his wife, but it just wasn’t enough.
They whispered greetings to the couple and Draco helped Harriet to sit up with a groan. As she clutched onto him, he gently parted her legs so the two female healthcare workers could perform their exam.
“Give me pups, Potter.” Draco commanded while he panted for breath.
That was no matter, ten points.
Draco was worried that she wasn’t getting proper nutrition but when he consulted the healers he had hired, they didn’t seem too concerned as they exchanged knowing glances with one another.
Ron and Hermione had built a small house adjacent to the Burrow and Draco wrinkled his nose at the sight of the humble dwelling as he stood beside Harriet while she knocked on her friends’ front door.
“That we two might be one.” Echoed Draco.
“There, there, my dear…..It’s alright. You don’t have to be afraid…..I’m here with you. I’m not going to let anything bad happen. I promise to protect you.”
Draco looked surprised.
To Draco’s dismay, Harriet had refused their help.
“Step back! Both of you!” Draco snapped at his mother and Harriet’s best friend as he watched his omega gently lay down on her side.
Harriet watched the expression of genuine joy on her husband’s face as he smiled widely at the baby who cooed up at him in response.
What a hassle Harriet had made of this whole affair!
Her lips threatened to turn into a frown when a painful stab of sadness hit her squarely in the heart during her musings.
While the Malfoys omegas were distracted by Scorpius and the beautiful, warm day, Draco apparated out of the manor and began to complete the list of errands he had devised for himself.
In the fortnight that followed their trip, Draco realized how unreasonable he had become and he sought to restore pleasant normalcy to his and Harriet’s life.
A teddy bear holding a wand, that was the logo from the baby store in Hogsmeade.
“Everything alright, Malfoy?” Ron asked as both alphas stood on the cottage’s small porch and stared out into the distance.
Rest.
“That’s not true at all.” Draco scowled.
—————————————————————
He began to stroke her belly in gentle circles as he coaxed her quietly, “Breathe, love…..let out your breath, there you go, that’s better.”
The healers estimated they had a little over three months before the child arrived.
“I know, Potter, I know.” Draco said quickly, “I’ve heard it before, remember? Regardless of where you stand on the issue though, I still have a nursery to prepare. I thought it may be rather nice if my son or daughter’s mother helped choose the decorations.”
“I’ll shout if I need you.” Harriet nodded.
Draco’s family was one of the wealthiest in the wizarding world, of course the ring he had purchased for Harriet was real.
That was the first time that Draco resented his son’s presence.
“Of course it’s real, Ron!” Hermione exclaimed.
Somewhere she and Draco could do something that Harriet felt like they hadn’t done in a long time……..be with each other.
He shouted so loudly that he startled her and she jumped slightly as her sleepiness faded away.
“You do, indeed, sir, although if your wife doesn’t make some drastic alterations to her lifestyle, I’m not sure how much longer that statement will be truthful.” The healer nodded seriously.
He thought he had it, anyway.
Harriet nodded again and took a breath. Dr. Krause turned the screen of the machine towards the couple and as she moved forward to place the device in her hand on Harriet’s belly, Draco narrowed his eyes to slits and hunched protectively over Harriet, terrified that she was going to be hurt.
“WWWAAAA!”
“Come in!” Draco called irritably.
Scorpius never left his mother’s sight and that did present a bit of difficulty for Draco.
He grit his teeth when he felt the warmth coming from her skin.
—————————————————————
Why had he thought it would be a good idea to try and maintain separate areas with a new baby?
Harriet didn’t say anything in response but she did flash her mate a small smile of acceptance as she turned and added yet another article of Draco’s clothing into her nest.
As Harriet sat at the table, waiting for Draco to come out of the bathroom, she was unmistakable to her friends.
“Ron and I.” Hermione nodded.
“But you take pills?” Draco grunted as Harriet moved around on the bed. His grey stare was transfixed by the way the extra fullness in her breasts increased their jiggling.
To Draco, it happened in slow motion.
“I’m doing well and I hope you are! I’m afraid I have some distressing news. We’ve run into a problem with the adoption.” Langston replied.
His appearance in the shop did raise a few eyebrows.
Draco had arranged a wake up call for them to occur an hour before the sun rose the next morning.
She would think about her ultrasound appointment later.
He knew that Harriet and Draco were one such couple.
“That’ll…..never work…...Malfoy.” Harriet sighed as she picked up her pace. Draco groaned as his mate rode him faster, but Harriet leaned down over top of him and whispered, “Because I am the better flyer~.”
“........I think you’re afraid.” Draco surmised.
Harriet’s walls gripped onto him like a vice. While Draco was drowning in her, Harriet’s eyes were closed as she let herself surrender to the bliss that came with being filled by her alpha after spending the entire day craving Draco.
“You look lovely~.” Draco’s soft whisper cooed in her ear while his nimble hands fastened the buttons from the nape of her neck all the way down to the small of her back.
Besides his annoying tendency to hover, Draco hid his nervousness from his wife rather well.
Once Harriet and Draco were left alone again in their bedroom, Harriet smiled at how focused her husband was as he read over the parchments.
Lucius and Narcissa were away on a business trip, so that gave Draco and Harriet an important amount of privacy in those first few days of their temporary cohabitation.
Thank you very much for your concern and the kind words that you’ve sent. I’m very sorry for everything that’s happened and I look forward to speaking about it with you and Ron soon, if you two can forgive me. I promise that I am not under any sort of coercion (see below) and that I am here, at Malfoy manor with Draco, of my own free will. The Malfoys are treating me well and everything is fine. Can you reply with a time that you and Ron will be free for tea soon? I would invite you here, but I don’t think we’d be able to speak privately.
Underneath the table, his trembling hands removed the ring box from the lower pocket on the inside of his suit jacket and Harriet chuckled as she added, “What are you going to do next? Get down on your knees and ask me to marry you?”
The Malfoy-Potter union was expected to be the biggest social event in recent years.
A dry gasp left Harriet’s throat as she peered down at her tiny, baby boy, who blinked his curious grey eyes up at his mother with a frown.
“We…….we can’t…...do that yet, Malfoy!” Harriet huffed while the skin on her face burned bright red.
“I’m your alpha, Harriet.” Draco reminded her.
“If you smile for your mother, I’ll give you an extra chocolate after dinner…...” Draco offered.
Perhaps not.
Harriet’s eyes snapped wide open and Draco smirked at his shocked wife while he replied, “What's the matter, love? Did you have a date?”
Mr. Roberts thought that the man in front of him was expressing his disappointment, but really Draco was already starting to feel guilty about what he was preparing to do.
Harriet would never admit it, but as the birth grew closer, she doubted her decision more and more with each passing day.
“Get dressed.” Harriet commanded.
She’d explore that later, though.
“-No.” Draco replied with a frown, “I woke with an ache in my back, it feels just like it did with Scorpius….It’ll be hours yet.” Draco complained with a defeated huff, “I’m not in a rush to get in that hard bed at St. Mungo’s before I absolutely must.”
Harriet’s bright green eyes flickered open and she pulled back to stare into Draco’s grey orbs as he repeated, “I’m in love with you………….I have been for some time now. I’m not entirely sure when it started, but I am confident that it will never end.”
As a result of the unbearable hovering that Draco was already showing her he was capable of, Harriet hoped that her pregnancy went quickly.
He didn’t…. have to…. be-
The Malfoy heir hadn’t been so overwhelmed since Lord Voldemort had ordered him to murder his headmaster.
—————————————————————-
“I’ve got a terrible problem that I don’t know how to sort out.” Draco said with a deep sigh as he walked over to the table and sat down.
Inside the cottage, Harriet sat chatting with Hermione while they both drank their last remaining sips of tea.
The uncharacteristic animosity in her voice finally got her alpha’s attention as Draco looked over at her and scowled, “What, Potter?! Can’t you see I’m trying to get this finished?!”
Draco shrugged, “Was I not allowed to?”
Harriet moved as quickly as she could to crawl out of his lap while she scowled and retorted, “I’m not being obstinate! I’m being rational! I told you….I’ve already signed the papers! The adoption has been arranged!”
She assumed that the box was what Draco had referred to, it had to be, it was the only box in the room…….
Immediately, Lucius and Narcissa looked over at their son, frowning when they saw that he was alone.
Forever.
As irritating as it was to Harriet to be gawked at while she was trying to get ready for the day, a part of her was proud that she held Draco’s attention so satisfyingly well.
Six years?
The two women giggled together and the baby let out a happy, little cry at the sound, delighted by the mirthful noise.
Draco didn’t remember the contractions being quite so….bad….with Scorpius at first…….but it had been nearly three years.
Draco heard his wife’s coworkers clapping behind them, but he didn’t care, he didn’t care if they were happy about it or not.
“Have a family with Granger.” Draco hissed.
“My son informed me that he has not yet asked you to marry him.” Lucius snapped as he glared over at Draco before he turned his cold gaze onto Harriet.
Scorpius woke at the sound as well and began to whimper until Harriet stood up, walked over, and plucked her darling baby from his wooden cradle.
Harriet groaned in displeasure and rustled around in the covers for a moment before she cracked her eyes open and blinked at her husband sitting at her side with their two tiny daughters.
Event if Draco obliviated the muggle family and made his escape, there would be others coming after him and his son or daughter due to the intricate complications that Harriet had set in place.
“-Ly in love with you? Yes.” Draco shrugged, “Come on, my darling, we’ll pick up Scorpius so you can nurse him, then we’ll come back.”
Draco’s smirk melted into a soft smile and as he watched his mate stare at their new baby, contentment bloomed in his heart.
Harriet began to relive her entire life from the moment her memories had begun, except, it was all different that time around.
When Draco finally opened his grey eyes, he saw Harriet standing next to him and asked worriedly, “Love……..are you alright? What’s the matter?”
“-But I want to.” Harriet insisted.
“How am I meant to stop her?” Draco scowled.
Thank you for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
What was a Slytherin or a Gryffindor anyway?
Comforting Harriet while she cried was more of a challenge for Draco than holding her over the toilet had been.
“Well, send her in! Hurry up!” Draco hissed.
Surely she was awake?
Harriet shrugged it off.
“The midwife said that lying down for long periods can cause a blood clot.” Draco reminded her sternly, “Come on, Potter, let’s go to dinner. Do you need me to help you up?”
He wrote the omega a letter, which she then received and promptly destroyed.
Under Draco’s watchful eye, Harriet had made wonderful progress. Draco grinned proudly when the healer had commended his efforts on helping the poorly omega and the child she carried regain their health.
Draco rolled over in bed and cradled her belly.
Ahead of them was the golden snitch, twitching this way and that, almost as if it were fearful of the two people ready to reach out and grab it.
Those stupid elves!
Harriet’s dress’s straps hung off her shoulders and left a good amount of her cleavage plainly in Draco’s view. He wasn’t certain which he enjoyed staring at more, that, or the creamy suppleness of her thighs that the hem of her new dress skimmed over.
As Draco gazed at Harriet holding the Weasleys’ daughter on their sofa, his heart started to race and his grey orbs widened.
“Well, I’m trying my best to give you one.” Harriet blinked.
When Hermione’s writings began to take on a frantic tone, Draco sat down one afternoon while Harriet was having one of her many naps, and answered the letter himself.
His father would definitely be hearing about that.
Draco was seized by the mind-numbing fear that Harriet would slap him away or continue her protest, but his shoulders shuddered in relief when Harriet arched her back and pressed her belly into his hands as she lovingly returned his kiss.
Draco blinked.
The knocking became louder as he ran towards the door and threw it open.
Really, she didn’t need him at all.
After Scorpius and the elf had disappeared around the corner, Draco turned and headed in the opposite direction.
Boxes and boxes were stacked here and there and everywhere.
Only a few months old, Rose was still very small.
Somewhere romantic?
“Alright, Potter?” He asked worriedly.
Narcissa seemed taken aback as she stared at Harriet hesitantly, not wanting to overstep her boundaries.
An hour and a half later-
“HHHHHHAAAAAAARRRRYYYY!”
Although Harriet’s dark wedding dress was far from traditional in the muggle world, a group of late night hikers happened by and when they saw the couple kissing and the officiant standing a short distance in front of them, they happily applauded.
“I’m the one that nests!” Harriet insisted with an angry sob.
When she looked over and saw the scowl on Draco’s face, Harriet crossed her arms and asked, “What was I supposed to say, Draco? After they risked their lives for me, multiple times? Tell them ‘no’? ‘Thanks for everything you’ve gone through and given up for me, but my husband and I can’t lol after your little girl for three days’?”
Harriet had no one like that and since she had hidden her pregnancy, she couldn’t even turn to Molly Weasley.
To Harriet, the world was Draco.
Lucius indeed sat at the head of the table with a deep scowl imprinted on his handsome features. It was difficult to determine whom he silently fumed more harshly at, Harriet, or his own son.
Secretly, Draco wanted to smack the thoughtless clerk.
“........I suppose.” Draco replied with a melancholy frown.
He went back to work and loved Harriet and lived his life.
Light was light.
“Then see that you do.” Lucius spat, his breath hitting Draco in the eyes, “I’m warning you, son. No Malfoy’s ever been born a bastard, and I won’t stand to see the first while I’m the head of this family.”
I can’t wait to meet you. It’s going to take me some time to get there, but I just wanted to let you know that I’m here and I love you and Mummy very much.
Harry was strongly against enslaving house elves, but with Draco’s reluctance, Harry had hired Dobby and a few of his friends to work at Malfoy manor as paid employees with full benefits.
The light of the new day was already streaming through the heavy curtains that covered Draco’s windows. Instead of rolling over to see for himself, he stretched a hand out and let it fall through the void of empty air beside him.
Draco’s lips turned into a pout and he shook his head as he spoke, “Well, he’s just been born, Father. We haven’t given him a name yet.”
“Draco……….?” Harriet asked as she recognized the stamped seal on the sides of the boxes.
“Is that a challenge, Malfoy?” Harriet asked coyly.
The midwife answered the lengthy list of questions that Draco had already managed to compile and then she took her leave.
Draco had succeeded in securing his son, Harriet’s heart, and pulling her back from the dangerous edges of despair.
Draco and Harry looked between their two children, then over at each other. Draco blushed softly as Harry leaned over and kissed her lips tenderly.
That was better.
“What’s…...what’s the matter?” Harriet asked in confusion as she looked around.
Harriet felt very loved to have an alpha that didn’t mind the way her hips had spread or the thin, silvery souvenirs towards the bottom of her belly that proudly announced to the world she had carried his child.
Draco’s grey eyes were wide and shimmering with hope as Harriet squeezed his hand and cleared her throat.
“Mr……..Draco Malfoy?” The man asked as Draco walked up with Harriet.
After Draco helped his lover cross over another peak of bliss, as he felt her shudder against his lips, her grip on him relaxed, and he looked up as her legs gently slipped to drape over his shoulders.
Draco deftly rose from the bed and looked down at his mate as he asked, “You’ll shout if you need me?”
Harriet herself laughed at her groom’s eagerness as she placed a hand on his cheek and welcomed his kiss.
“I know you don’t approve, Father.” Draco spoke.
There were no intrusive buildings in sight, only small, wooden bungalows that were built over the water.
Engraved or enchantment laid into the metal?
Every night, Draco slept with a hand protectively laid over his mate’s bump.
Hermione was not going to abandon Harriet in the middle of the omega’s greatest fight since the war.
“Hey, love.” Harriet greeted her alpha with a coy smile as Draco looked at her like he wanted to scream with joy, “Did you get my letter?”
As they stood there, in the middle of their marriage ceremony, with the waterfall gushing behind them, it was a very powerful moment for both Draco and Harriet.
“I’ve thought about it for a while and these past few days…….it's seemed so real. How amazing has it been to have her with us?” Draco asked as he reached out and gently took the small baby from Harriet.
Good~.
“Hello, my princesses.” Draco chuckled as he stepped through the doorway.
Harriet didn’t want to accept Draco’s invitation, but she thought that maybe if she gave in to his demands, sat down with him, and explained the situation, perhaps he would finally leave her in peace.
Draco looked down in the witch’s arms and he noticed she was holding a basket filled with small toys and toiletries for the baby.
Harriet moved her chair up closer to the table so that her abdomen was no longer in Draco’s view.
He blinked and felt his eyelashes scrape against the bandages that were wrapped around his head. In front of his face, he saw a very familiar pair of green eyes staring down at him.
They would have a daughter!
The bed.
“What have you done now, Draco?” Lucius asked dryly.
“You’ll have to forgive the mess.” The muggle man said with a smile to Draco as they sat down on the firm furniture, “We haven’t had a chance to clean today. The children have made this place a wreck! They’ve just been so excited…. It’s not often that we come to our city house.”
“WWWWAAAA!”
Scorpius hugged his mother one last time, briefly embraced his father, and then turned to board the train.
Harriet was used to being in the media’s eye from her previous experiences but she was still shocked that the news about her and Draco had been so eagerly received.
————————————————————
Harriet reached out and grabbed Narcissa’s hand. As the baby inside her womb moved again, Harriet let out a breath and guided Narcissa’s hand to her abdomen, where she laid it to rest gently.
As Harriet let her hired professional lead her, she hoped that her efforts would pay off.
“I’m going to guide you through labor.” Draco said to Harriet as he placed another kiss on her belly, “You won’t have to do anything, love, except hold onto me.”
There were few things that pleased an alpha in love more than caring for their omega and pups, even if the latter hadn’t been born yet.
With a scowl on his face, Draco turned around and blinked as he recognized one of the secretaries from the Auror office standing in front of the doors to the hallway that led away from the emergency department.
Harriet didn’t feel the slightest bit intimidated when she came home each evening to find her husband flying around on his broom in the yard while he trained for the upcoming game.
Draco slid his wand from his pocket and with a single flick, he closed and locked the door behind himself without a second thought. He kept his eyes fixed firmly on Harriet as he stalked towards her predatorily.
“I…….I can’t……..” Harriet gasped dryly as the contraction ended.
He gave a single command and two house elves appeared in their bedroom doorway a moment later. The house elves scurried over and gladly took Lily and Narcissa from Draco’s arms. Both of the elves wore bright smiles as they carried the giggling Malfoy girls off to the dining room.
Narcissa looked up at Harriet anxiously as if she were silently asking for consent, but Harriet smiled proudly down at her belly as Draco’s little one continued to move and stretch.
He happened to glance up to the top of his desk and that was when he saw it………..
When Draco understood that his omega was expressing her need for him, he smirked from ear to ear as he happily obliged and splayed his hands over their unborn child.
One afternoon, while she sat at her desk, tackling a mountain of backlogged paperwork from a recent investigation, Harriet’s head pounded as she signed her name on one document after another with a long, brown quill.
“I wish you’d stop fighting me, Potter.” Draco whispered, “You know I’m going to win one day, why don’t you just give up?”
Being raised as a pampered heir, Draco decided to seek help that night in the best way that he knew how………….from his parents.
“That’s more than apparent, Potter.” Draco hissed. He was so preoccupied drinking in the sight of her body that his eyes never traveled up to her face. Draco was enraptured by how beautiful Harriet looked. Her fair face was framed by her long tresses, all the color of dark, burning embers. Her green eyes glowed at him, along with her cheeks, radiant with the promise of the new life she carried.
That look came back onto Narcissa’s face, that look that Harriet despised, as if the older woman was thinking about eating her.
Others would have called it quaint.
After Harriet nodded slightly, Draco chivalrously carried Harriet’s Honeydukes bag for her.
With his office door firmly locked, Draco watched Harriet’s face in fascination as he made love to her, seated in his office chair, with her widened hips bearing down on him.
Draco rolled onto his back and opened his arms to let Harriet cuddle against him as easily as if it was a natural, automatic motion.
While she stood in the deserted bathroom, Harriet pulled the pouch that held her medication out of her pocket, and looked in the mirror at herself.
The scent hit Draco squarely in the face as soon as he walked through the door. For a moment he was confused and his grey eyes narrowed as he gazed at Harriet in disbelief.
After only a few days of her plight, Harriet’s cheeks had hollowed and what little light that had been left in her eyes was gone.
“Hello in there, little one.” Draco whispered to the soft swell under his wife’s navel, “Mummy and Daddy love you very much.”
Hermione and Harriet looked on fondly as he cuddled the little infant.
If the omega truly didn’t want him involved, then why hadn’t she just obliviated him?
“NNNNGGGGGHHHH!”
It was easy for Draco to convince Harriet to let the photographer come, for Scorpius’s sake…..
Draco’s office at the Malfoy company was large, dark, and elegant, much like his childhood home.
That wasn’t Draco.
The charm Draco had cast earlier had long worn off. His and Harriet’s faces were no longer disguised.
—————————————————————
It all happened so smoothly that Harriet barely had time to notice. Draco’s addictive kiss and his skillful hands as they slipped off of her breasts to travel along her curves were driving her mad.
Little Rose had a rough time during the final night of her stay with the Malfoys’. Draco and Harriet took turns walking the floor with her until dawn while she wailed and wailed, stricken with a bad tummy ache.
“Very well.” Harriet smiled, “I feel much better now.”
“How’ve I done what?” Ron replied.
He had been born a Malfoy and he would be raised as a Malfoy.
“I know you can hear me!” Draco continued, “Come back inside! Now!”
From the sunlight that streamed in through his bedroom’s large window, Draco saw the single tear that slowly trickled down Harriet’s cheek.
The awkwardness that Harriet and Draco had experienced during their visit to the gelato shop was almost comforting in contrast with the frigid unease in the Malfoy dining room as they ate with Draco’s parents an hour after Narcissa’s visit.
Two days before her due date, Harriet’s sharply decreased appetite dwindled to an alarming degree.
She didn’t think that her prejudices ran deep enough to allow her to hate Draco’s child, no matter who the mother was.
They moved towards each other slowly and as their lips met, Draco used his wand to close the nursery door.
Harriet’s skin was hot to the touch for those entire three days and that, along with her body’s unignorable urges, filled Draco with sympathy for his wife.
Harriet eyed her mate cautiously while she moved over to where he had been standing and huffed as she corrected the ruffled edges of the blankets that her clueless alpha had mistakenly disarranged.
“What do you need me to do? What can I bring for you? Get for you?” Harry asked sweetly.
“A baby.” Draco answered honestly, “Or two.”
Harriet was mortifyingly speechless as Draco moved his hand to open the black, velvet ring box while he formally stated his question at last, “Harriet Potter……….will you marry me?”
Narcissa glanced over at Draco and he nodded at his mother.
He stepped in close to Harriet and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear as he gazed at her and whispered, “We deserve this, you and I……..”
“Harriet Potter.” Harriet replied.
“Mummy has to get dressed for work, Daddy.” Harriet reminded her alpha.
“You have to schedule an appointment immediately.” Draco demanded.
Draco sucked in a breath.
He assumed that the wedding officiant had already concluded the ceremony and he chose to end his own frustrating wait to kiss his gorgeous bride.
When Harriet failed to speak, Draco went on, “If you won’t let me have you, will you at least allow me to care for my son or daughter? You can leave the moment they’re born and neither of us will ever contact you again. You have my word. I won’t even tell them about you at all, if you wish. If we pass you on the street, we won’t look your way. ”
“No, Mr. Malfoy, your omega’s not carrying twins.” The midwife answered with a nod as Harriet raised a hand and stroked her baby’s tiny, chubby cheek.
The woman working at the reception desk sniffed at Draco’s threat and combed through her records for a moment before she looked up at Draco and adjusted her glasses.
“Well?” Draco asked hastily, furrowing his brow, “How is she? How is my child?”
Draco was especially glad about that.
Behind her, Draco smiled for a moment before he shook himself out of his thoughts and began to dress himself in his brand new, perfectly sized black suit.
The Malfoys had fallen out of favor with the public but Lucius saw a wonderful opportunity in the form of his son’s…..indiscretion.
Harriet wore a firm pout on her face as she lifted one of the pillows behind her head and used it to playfully smack Draco against his shoulder.
“No.” Harriet replied, “It feels lovely.”
Harriet peered out and noticed a man waiting on the edge of a nearby clearing, but it was the incredible beauty of the landscape which surrounded them that really captured her attention.
“WWWWAAAAA!”
Harriet didn’t realize how upset Draco was becoming until, in the video, the woman reached out and grabbed her alpha’s hand.
Inside Harriet swirled a conflicting mix of rage, fear, and amusement.
“Lily.” Draco chided as he glanced over at the toddler that stood in her bed and looked at him with her emerald eyes, “Narcissa,” Draco added as he turned his gaze on the other small girl who was standing in her own crib, which was directly across from her sister’s, “What have I told you two about holding onto the rails like that? You’re going to slip and pinch your fingers.”
Harriet’s dress had long sleeves of embellished, beaded lace that ran down to her wrists, a sweetheart neckline, and a mermaid-like cut that slipped over Harriet’s svelte figure with its voluminous skirts fanning out onto the floor like a fish’s tail.
Draco nodded as she closed her eyes and took a deep breath while Harry stood from the bed.
They grasped each other’s hands as they both contemplated the midwife’s admission.
Harriet’s green eyes were soft and loving as he took her wailing newborn from his father’s arms, but she became startled and frightened by the way the healer and the midwife took over as soon as she had the baby within her grasp.
“That’s fine, we don’t need to be gone for more than an hour or two.” Draco said contemplatively as he moved up on the bed to sit directly beside Harriet.
After Scorpius and the elf had gone from his sight, Draco turned and headed in the opposite direction.
As Draco moved forward to lean in and kiss Harriet’s lips with his, he failed to hold back the chuckle that escaped his throat.
“Father,” Draco announced, “This is my son.”
Family meal.
Everyone was waiting on Harriet and Harriet was waiting on the baby.
As Draco ordered a coffee and Harriet ordered a hot chocolate, he narrowed his eyes while he started to plan.
From the moment Harriet had agreed to marry him, Lucius and Narcissa had taken over with their ideas, not the betrothed couples’ wants or needs.
Narcissa barely noticed what was happening in the background while she paced around the room, cradling her darling Draco’s little boy.
It bothered him that Harriet refused to speak.
He vowed silently that he would be ten times more loving than his own father had been and ten times more supportive.
“I was disappointed.” Draco revealed, “I thought that you felt the same….spark...that night. I was expecting to wake up beside you and show you what a day being a Malfoy is like, but you were already gone……...Why? You didn’t have to do this on your own, you know.”
Low, deep cramps rolled through her empty womb as she fought back a nauseating urge to construct a safe place in which she could rest.
Narcissa directed where the flowers should be placed while Lucius ordered the house elves to serve the food and set the table.
Draco drew in a breath and looked down at Harriet, who gave him a shrug, and settled back as Dr. Krause discreetly pulled the omega’s shirt up to expose her belly.
Draco approached as warily as if he were walking up to a dragon.
As they began to eat, Draco’s face twisted into a pained scowl.
Although Draco was physically exhausted, he was too exhilarated to sleep.
Their lips connected and Draco tangled his hands into Harriet’s messy, dark hair for a long moment.
Harriet’s green eyes were fixed firmly on Draco’s as she began to breathe slowly through her nose and out of her mouth exactly like they had been instructed in the muggle classes they had taken.
“What’s the best way to get what you want, Draco?” Lucius asked shrewdly.
“.......Harriet?” Narcissa asked as she opened the door cautiously.
Draco let Harriet dictate the speed and intensity of how their lips brushed together, but he did take advantage of the opportunity to lay a hand over her mounded tummy.
When Harriet and Draco walked into the dining room, they found themselves greeted by the happy smiles of their little ones and the gentle welcome of Lucius and Narcissa.
Draco’s mouth fell open when Harriet came gliding into the room.
“Draco.” Harriet whispered.
Finally, Hermione’s lesson was over. Ron was out of breath but he had finished with his task of bringing in his small daughter’s luggage.
Would she be acting the same way if his last name was “Weasley” or “Longbottom”?
“I’m not your mate.” Harriet said quietly.
She saw some things that she liked, and some things that she didn’t. Mostly, though, at that point, Harriet liked sleep, and she was too proud to admit that she wasn’t getting enough.
Draco was frightened that “cold” may mean “unbearably cold”. He was worried that Harriet would be uncomfortable or in pain, but his death grip of reassurance on her hand started to ease when he saw she was completely relaxed as the doctor finished.
“I’m not pregnant. My next heat’s going to come soon, possibly tomorrow, possibly tonight.” Harriet said as she sighed again and looked back over at her husband.
The nursery was to her liking at last, and Harriet was pleased.
“About nine more weeks until you two could become parents. Not terribly long!” The midwife smiled.
Draco was thrown into such a gut-wrenching pit of hopelessness that he didn’t know what to do with himself.
“I don’t know, Scorp. You tell me.” Harry laughed.
“Well….. this may be difficult for you to understand, but this is a restaurant….and we’ve come here to eat. Don’t worry! There’s no reason to be afraid, alright?” Draco asked in a teasing, sarcastic tone.
The midwife stared at Harriet for a long moment and Harriet blinked back at the elderly woman.
Harriet’s happy sighs grew louder when she was able to derive a higher amount of benefit from Draco’s long, skilled fingers as they worked the kinks out of her tense muscles.
“I dunno……” Harriet replied as she shook her head, “I……..That was the first, I think…..it just woke me up out of nowhere.”
Draco looked over at her once he was finished and walked over to join her.
She rubbed her eyes absently while Draco’s gaze followed her as she walked around the room.
She noticed at some point that she was laying on her side. Behind her, she heard Narcissa’s voice and felt the gentleness of Draco’s mother rubbing soft circles into her aching, lower back.
“What?” Harriet blinked.
The cashier rang up the couples’ selection of baby clothes, a few maternity dresses and bras that Harriet had discreetly asked to purchase, and several plush toys that the pair had chosen as well. As the store attendant worked, Draco stood behind Harriet and slipped an arm around her waist to splay his hand protectively over her rounded belly.
She sighed as she pulled herself up, using Draco as a crutch, until she was sitting on her bottom in the middle of the bed…...the bed which served its true purpose to Draco’s omega once more.
Harriet had been right.
Harriet shifted nervously as a new set of footsteps confidently walked down the hall.
Harriet realized she was lying on her side and as she became more awake, she started suddenly when she recognized that something was drifting over her abdomen…...
The Malfoy family healer entered the room along with the midwife.
She would never believe Draco’s innocence in the situation, nor would she ever trust him again.
“You’re imagining it.” Harriet smiled, “You had no idea they existed before you read that letter I sent you.”
Harriet choked hoarsely like a soldier who’d been stabbed as she blindly reached for Draco. Once she found his arm, she clumsily pulled herself into a squat and he firmly held onto her sides so she could brace herself against him.
That was when it occurred to Harriet that she may have started a battle for which she wasn’t properly prepared……..
Harriet frowned. Without her wand, she couldn’t apparate. Muggle taxis didn’t come to Malfoy manor and she was in no condition to walk.
“Will you please come with me and have a chat?” Draco asked.
“I had trouble getting you out of the nest with the girls, too. Perhaps it’s twins again!” Draco mused as he pushed the covers out of the way so that Harriet could have room to stand up.
Immediately upon their arrival, Draco placed Harriet carefully onto his large, soft bed and sent for help.
Scorpius furrowed his tiny brow at the noise and squirmed in her arms before she cradled him against her breasts until he cooed softly and burrowed back down to sleep.
She hadn’t felt well recently but she attributed it all to stress.
A nest!
The candlelight was soft and the food was excellent. While the enamored couple gazed at each other as they ate, they barely noticed the commotion in the background that came from hungry customers dining and chatting, and the service staff bustling about, filling orders and tending tables.
Thank you for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
Lucius Malfoy was a large shareholder in one of St. Mungo’s biggest partner hospitals, on the other side of wizarding Britain.
Draco knew that Harriet wanted to, she just wasn’t letting herself for some reason.
Good.
“I can’t help it! You look like a cat that’s been thrown into water.” Harriet chuckled as she wiped a hand over her face and tried to calm herself. Harriet pushed back another fit of giggles and looked at Draco seriously as the elevator chimed to announce its imminent departure, “You had better step out here if you don’t want to go back down.”
Harriet had been so relaxed and so satisfied during her heat that she hadn’t prepared herself for the onslaught of crushing pressure that came afterwards.
“We’re only trying to assist her, Mr. Malfoy.” The midwife replied.
Snuggly, soft, and sweet, with Draco’s blonde hair and Harriet’s friendly disposition, the secret Malfoy effortlessly charmed his way into the heart of each person that he met.
Draco’s eyes silently darted back and forth between the mother, her child, and Harriet.
Harriet’s fear instantly vanished and her instincts took over.
Across the house, as Draco held Harriet’s hips in his hands and thrust into her like a wild stallion, he imagined her rubbing her swollen belly as she sat in her nest.
“No.” Harriet said with a sniff, “I just want to sleep.”
Scorpius snuffled quietly as he laid a tiny hand against Harriet’s breast and she let her head roll towards Draco, exposing her bare throat while she whispered, “I tried not to wake you.”
It all sounded very complex to Draco.
Every night, Harriet slept cuddled against Draco’s chest. He smiled each morning when he woke with her still laying carelessly against him, trusting him to keep her safe from whatever threat may come.
Outside the window, the soothing roll of the tide splashed against the sand.
“Yes, I am.” Draco replied without hesitation.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Despite the many adventures she had lived through during her life, Harriet hadn’t actually gotten to travel to many different places around the world.
Harriet wondered vaguely what was going to happen for a moment but before she could really ponder the idea, Draco murmured under his breath and they were off……...
Draco wasn’t going to look at the pamphlets form their muggle classes that evening, or the booklets.
All day at work, Harriet was surprised that her mind kept drifting to ponder her unborn child.
The server leading the couple finally arrived at a lonely spot towards the back of the restaurant.
He scowled furiously as he reached a hand out and splayed his fingers over her abdomen.
Careful not to put any weight on her, Draco bent over Harriet and let her lay her forehead against his as she whispered, “I want to have your pup right here, in our nest.”
Draco had to bite his tongue so as not to burst out laughing at his own foolishness.
Draco silently decided that the first and easiest step would be to get Harriet safely out of the press’s way.
How dare she even try!
Harriet was already at work.
She had hoped that her husband would have let the matter about the birth’s location drop.
“WWWWAAA!”
When the time came, he wanted to take Harriet to the hospital to make sure his omega would have everyone and everything that she needed.
To his dismay though, Ron and Hermione’s faces twisted in disgust.
Draco’s official wedding day was lonelier than he had expected it to be.
—————————————————————
Lucius sniffed and rolled back over in bed to continue reading the book in his hands, “Only muggles would attempt something like that. What if that’s harmful to the child?”
“There are, Father! I saw them with my own eyes!” Scorpius insisted as his grey stare bore into Draco’s.
“It’s still too early to make any accurate guesses.” The healer replied with a shrug, “For now, what I’m prescribing is some rest for my patient. She should have loads of nest time over the next few weeks. Let’s see if that won’t bring her around, shall we?”
“Draco, love, what’s wrong? Do you feel alright?” Narcissa asked worriedly when the blonde dropped his fork and by doing so, attracted the attention of everyone at the table, including little Scorpius, who blinked at his father from his ebony high chair.
Draco scrambled over to Harriet and took Narcissa’s place after she knowingly moved out of the way before she was pushed aside by her frantic son.
Harriet gasped as Draco spun her.
“No.” Draco laughed as he glanced over at Harriet, “I want children because I’m an alpha and alphas want pups. Looking after Rose here has only been a grim reminder that I don’t have any of my own. Honestly,” Draco chuckled as he grinned over at Harriet, “Do you expect me to believe that seeing me like this is doing nothing to your ovaries right now, omega?”
“She doesn’t want me involved…..or around at all, I don’t think.” Draco said with a frown.
He smiled softly when he heard her gentle, rhythmic breathing.
No longer encumbered by the stress from work, Harriet could eat whatever she wanted, sleep whenever she wanted, and do both as much as she needed.
Daddy,
Lucius glowered at his son and stepped so close to him that he and Draco were eye to eye. Their slender noses were nearly touching as Lucius hissed warningly to his only offspring, “Our family has been involved in…….perhaps unscrupulous magical practices…..at different times throughout the ages, that’s true, but no Malfoy has ever been a rake. You may have been a coward in the war, Draco, and I suppose I have to accept that, but I will not stand by and allow my son to become a scoundrel.”
She really didn’t have the strength anyway.
Both teams picked up on the tension between the rival seekers when Draco gave Harriet a wicked smirk and asked in an arrogant tone, “Scared, Potter?”
Harriet’s two best friends were already prepared, Ron in his navy suit, and Hermione in her demure, blue dress, while they both attempted to help the bride-to-be get ready for the day.
“Do you know what I want, Potter?” Draco asked.
—————————————————————
Whether Harriet was a better flyer or not, the fact remained…...Draco Malfoy was her alpha and that was something that he was careful not to let his brazen omega forget.
Harriet seemed disheartened for a moment and then Draco watched an uncharacteristic expression of pure dismay cross her face. He frowned as she raised a hand and covered her eyes while she cried out to him, “You just want me to be miserable!”
Harriet hurriedly began to take off her clothes and slip into the new frock that her thoughtful alpha had selected for her.
Once her week-long cycle had passed, the very next morning, Draco already began his campaign.
—————————————————————
Harriet Potter was his omega and Draco knew that she loved him as much as he loved her. If it took the rest of his lifetime to get her to admit that and accept it as fact, then so be it.
—————————————————————
“I’m struggling not to eat you, love~.” Draco replied from the crook of Harriet’s neck.
Lucius Malfoy got his wish, albeit a few months late.
“Um, we…..we did, yes.” Harriet stammered as she looked up at Narcissa.
“Oh…..of course.” Draco nodded.
Birth and death.
With a gentle purr, he lifted the soft blankets of the nest that he and Harriet were enveloped in and he tenderly cuddled against her.
Harriet pressed a hand to the side of her belly and groaned, not only from the pain, but to gain her mate’s attention.
He heard a rustle behind himself and turned over in bed to investigate. His green eyes softened as he watched his beloved wife, Draco Potter, shift around uncomfortably.
Harriet sighed as she felt Draco’s grey eyes bore into her accusingly.
“The Three Broomsticks is right behind you.” Draco nodded.
House elves had many tasks, some more pleasant than others, but transporting laughing babies was always an elf favorite.
Harry kept glancing over at his wife while he dressed for the day. As a well-established healer that worked at St. Mungo’s himself, Harry wasn’t the least bit nervous about the birth of his second child, but he wished Draco would hurry up.
After they arrived back at Malfoy manor, she undressed to go to the shower. When Harriet had to drop their connection though, he stayed beside her and helped her out of her clothes. As she walked into the bathroom, he followed her,  and washed her gently as the warm water ran over them both.
Harriet wasn’t speaking out of bravado or arrogance, she was telling the truth.
Harriet and her mother-in-law insisted on dressing the Malfoy twins in fluffy, frilly outfits, but Draco didn’t mind.
Draco blinked again and slowly became aware that he was lying in Hogwarts’ infirmary.
“I just need you two to sign the license, sir.” The officiant said as he handed Draco a paper and a pen.
There was nothing wrong with Draco, but faking a sour stomach was the best excuse he could come up with to go and deal with the chaos his parents had caused.
Draco Malfoy looked extremely uncomfortable as he walked down a London street one evening.
Draco pitied anyone who tried to take his and Harriet’s happiness away.
Draco and Harriet were having a good time together.
Harriet softly smiled back but the color drained from Draco’s face.
Harriet was still too fatigued and too hungry to satisfy her alpha’s wants.
“This is mine.” Draco added as he held her belly in both his hands.
No more letters, no more hiding.
All of the stress she had experienced wasn’t good for her or their pup, Draco knew that.
The healers said she was doing well and that her prior issues were no longer a concern.
“Scorpius!” Draco shouted as he stood at the back entrance to Malfoy manor and gazed out across the estate’s grand terrace, “I’m not going to call you again! Dinner is ready!”
There wasn’t much more conversation.
What to do?
Draco huffed and closed his eyes miserably as a deep frown contorted his lips.
However, the competition was anything but friendly as Harriet and Draco stared each other down.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
While they tended the pregnancy, spending so much time together left Harriet and Draco plenty of opportunity to talk and chat.
“..........Hmm?” Harriet asked distractedly while Draco poked his tongue out and dared to flick it across her skin.
