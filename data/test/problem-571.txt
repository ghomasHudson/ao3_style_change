It first happens on a perfectly ordinary Tuesday night. Harry is completely unsuspecting and unprepared when he falls asleep. His dreams are usually rather plain bar the occasional war-related nightmare, however he’s been getting less and less of those. The pain and guilt still seem to resurrect themselves during his waking hours though. It’s a little harder to shake those feelings off when you’re walking through the very castle where it happened, where so many people died.
“No,” Harry squeaked. Yes, actually squeaked.
“OUT!”
“Harry,” Draco said Harry’s name, more breath than vocal chords, holding him tighter still. Harry knew exactly how he felt.
“Mate,” Ron intervenes, “What are you going to do? Follow him around the castle all night? Can’t you just watch him on the Marauder’s Map? You can do that from the library.”
“Are you alright with that?”
Professor Varas is right. Malfoy does seem to be the perfect match for Harry. He’s quick. When Harry hesitates, Malfoy is already spells ahead. When Harry pummels him with his full force, Malfoy dodges effortlessly, as if already knowing where Harry will aim. But although Malfoy seems to move at ease, he’s doing quite a bit of it, tiring himself out. Harry knows if he can just keep the duel running for as long as possible, Malfoy will slow down and leave an opening.
“When he left the Manor, I could feel it. Without his thoughts running through my head, I felt lighter. Like I always do the further I am from him.”
“To tell you to stop having your dirty sex gossip with Pansy in earshot of Teddy.”
“Fine,” Draco snapped, turning to his trunk to fetch his uniform, “But I want it back. Cleaned.”
Harry hadn’t meant to get drunk. But he had a habit of drinking nervously just to have something to do with his hands. And the waiter kept filling up his wine glass. So, by dessert, when Pansy laughed – a sound that Harry was growing to hate – at one of Draco’s jokes and placed a hand on his shoulder, Harry didn’t have the control to stop himself from commenting.
Harry keeps moving until he reaches the staircase at the end of the corridor. He’s wondering whether he should continue searching the second floor or head down and start at the bottom when he hears footsteps underneath him. He takes a step back into the corridor and feels around for the invisibility cloak in his – fuck. It’s back at Hogwarts in his own dorm. He had gotten dressed so quickly, he hadn’t even thought about it.
“That was for Mrs Dunberg’s safety,” Hermione fills in.
Draco’s fifteenth patient of the day was Harry Potter. And there was no ward in the hospital appropriate for Potter’s...
Malfoy’s face went bright red. “You – you  - urgh.” He threw his arms up in the air in frustration and continued his stomping.
Malfoy stopped at a shower cubicle and turned to face Harry fully. He had on the same smug grin he’d been wearing when he caught the snitch. “Then what are you doing here, Potter? Why did you follow me into the locker room? Your wand's not out, so you’re not going to curse me. If you wanted to punch me, you would have done it by now. So what
“Draco has a cinnamon allergy,” explained Pansy, clapping her hands together excitedly.
– makes sense.
Movement catches Draco’s eye and he swivels around. A small black cat watches Draco from its position perched above the fridge. Draco looks to Harry for permission but he seems too occupied with dinner. So, Draco approaches, slowly, one arm outstretched, giving the cat plenty of time to run away if it wishes. But it doesn’t.
Either way, the result ended up the same. Every November 3rd, the universe seemed to grant Draco Malfoy a chance with Harry Potter. A chance for what exactly, it wasn’t always clear. But something more than their rivalry. Something more than the empty words they shouted at each other across the schoolyard. Something that grew into a little bit more
Harry walks further towards the light, to the bed. He can’t help it. It is as if he’s being drawn in, beckoned, called to. Who is he to fight such a divine call? But this is where the trouble starts.
“Whatever you want to say, just get it out of your system now so you can stop bothering me.”
Potter ignored that. “What do you want?” He asked again.
“There must be some – “
“Pansy told you?” Draco guesses. He has a suspicion they may just be colluding behind his back.
interested. But I obviously didn't account for your arrogance. It won't happen again.” He turns away, gesturing for Zabini to follow.
choose, Draco, you’re just too scared too.” Hermione stood up and the bed felt too light, empty. “I can’t do all the work for you. Think it over and if you want, I can bring Harry back here in the morning.”
“Do you need someone to come with you?” Pansy asked sweetly.
“Who?”
Harry tightens his grip on his wand and moves through the wall barrier. The inside of the warehouse comes into view, as well as at least one hundred people. Even though he’s under the invisibility cloak, Harry instinctively ducks behind a nearby packing box, running straight into Malfoy.
Harry let his hands drop and sneak up beneath the hem of Draco’s sweater and up past his undershirt to land on the bare skin of Draco’s torso.
“My dirty sex gossip, what are you - “ Draco’s eyes grew wide. “Oh. What did he hear?”
“Don’t think about the day,” Potter interrupted. “Just think about us.” He took Draco’s Champagne glass and placed it on the ground with his own.
Without any other option, Harry ducks into the first room he finds and hovers behind the slightly ajar door, waiting for the footsteps to pass him. Harry listens, holding his breath, as whoever it is climbs the stairs. Just before the footsteps reach him, a familiar female voice whispers, “Incendio,” bathing the corridor in light, and allowing Harry to see clearly a woman with long blonde hair passing by him: Narcissa Malfoy.
And one day soon Harry Potter would give Draco Malfoy the strength, the bravery he needed, to say those words for real.
Malfoy shrugs and moves back to his own cauldron. He won’t meet Harry’s eye. “Believe who you want, Potter. It makes no difference to me. Just leave me alone. “
Potter looked up as they entered. As it turned out, delaying the inevitable was not an option. “Potter’s not my friend,” Draco quickly corrected, before Potter got any ideas.
Harry’s hands rose up and hovered over the scars crisscrossing Draco’s stomach. “Can I?” He asked. His voice was soft, with a gentleness that calmed Draco’s erratic heart. He nodded and lifted his head to watch Harry.
“The way I was talking before?” Potter finished (
A small sad smile appears on Malfoy’s face before it is quickly replaced with something bigger. Could this be a genuine smile from Draco Malfoy? “Are you concerned about me, Harry?’
, crashing down on Harry's again and again.
There’s a scraping of a chair and Harry quickly hurries backwards, pulling out his invisibility cloak as he does. He just manages to cover himself completely when Madam Pomfrey emerges. She strides past him without a glance.
“Then tell me what you’re doing with your other hand right now.”
Slughorn shuffles in his seat uncomfortably before fixing Harry with piercing eyes. “Do I need to remind you that it was
“Lying here,
The waiter looks at him strangely, hesitating by the table. Draco realises his mistake and explains, “I’m waiting for someone.”
“I was thinking,” Potter said, obviously deciding to shake off Draco’s jab, “I could disguise myself as a Slytherin to safely get past the Durmstrang students.”
Draco stiffens. Yes, he knows what he looks like. He’d rather not but it’s not as if he has a choice in the matter. Mirrors are often difficult to avoid. He’s not surprised that Potter finds him as disgusting as he finds himself.
Potter missed a step. “
“How do you – “
“Isn’t there a potion?” Harry asks. He’s sure Ron mentioned something about this last week but he was only half-listening. It had been the day Malfoy flew paper cranes around his head in Potions and earnt them a shared detention, and Harry had been too focused on perfecting his glaring technique.
Harry reaches out in search of Malfoy’s shoulder but doesn’t find it. “Not talking about it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.”
“I thought you’d like that,” Potter said, his voice a little raspier than before. Oh my gosh, was this Potter’s
Okay - his nerves still had a little bit of a say. He didn’t pull his pants down, but he did slip a hand beneath the waistband of his underwear and grip his now ridiculously hard dick. And he definitely didn’t imagine the hitch in Harry’s breathing at the action, despite the fact that Harry couldn’t be getting much of a view at all.
“Yes, you are! He’s chosen you. That’s all true love is, make the choice and magic will bind it. It seems like the cure didn’t work because
“Obviously,” Harry supplied. If confessing his feelings wasn’t enough, the semi hard-on in his pants that Malfoy surely must have noticed by now was another dead giveaway.
“You spend more money on the party than is donated to the cause!” Harry’s voice had started to rise. Despite his genuine anger, he couldn’t deny the excitement of sparring with Draco again.
Unless you’re Draco Malfoy it would seem. “It stimulates me,” he says.
Harry blinked out of his daze and rolled his eyes at Draco, a smirk playing on his lips. “Somebody’s eager.”
Pansy’s face dropped. “Then, what? You’re not being particularly descriptive.”
Harry realised what Malfoy was doing. He wasn’t daring anymore. He was simply asking.
Dearest Potter,
, he had, it certainly wasn’t in a cold sterile hospital room with Draco wearing nothing but a hospital gown and Harry fully clothed.
“And you’re going out for dinner with him again, so soon?” Pansy smiles now, teasing. “Is this a date?”
Harry wants to interrogate the insufferable bastard further. How dare he bring Teddy into this, his own cousin? How dare he sit there smugly, not caring that Harry knows he’s lying? Harry’s ready for a duel, whether it be of words or wands, when a double tap on his shoulder from Hermione changes his course. He steels himself and wraps his questioning up.
“Guess who is here?” Dobby asked without waiting for an answer. Even before they turned the corner - it was obvious who would it would be. “Your friend, Harry Potter.”
“It’s
“What else would it be?”

was something to smile about. And maybe, just maybe, Potter thought the same about a date with Draco Malfoy.
Anxiety takes hold of Harry as he walks forward and he has to stop himself from clutching his stomach. Madam Pomfrey’s presence can’t mean anything good.
She doesn’t turn or answer.
“Right,” Harry managed to nod. “I’ll get the door for you.”
happy, Harry brought his hands back to Draco’s hips. “Okay, we’re dating. Now can we–“
Harry hadn’t intended to start brewing potions in his spare time. It just sort of happened. After the war, he found himself seeking solitude often but not everyone seemed to understand. Hermione and Ron took comfort in being with others, being with each other, but Harry couldn’t. For every smiling face he saw around him, there was another face in the ground motionless. Sometimes it was too much. His excuses for his absences flowed out carelessly and the one that stuck, that most people seemed to believe, was the most absurd of all: he was brewing experimental potions outside of class.
“Stop flirting with Harry,” Ron said behind them.
The wolf smiles, showing off both rows of perfect teeth, and stalks forward.
“Because -“ Draco started, reaching for an excuse. “Because - because that’s unethical,” he landed on. “You’re a patient!”
“No,” Harry answers.
He looks around the room and spots his wand on a small glass coffee table. He grabs it, cleans his hand, and repairs the dittany bottle. He goes to shove it in the pocket of his jeans and in the process brushes his trousers against his sensitive cock. He’s still hard.
Harry waits for further explanation, particularly surrounding the humourous element, but nothing is forthcoming. “And?” he finally prompts.
“Yes, well, I was only thinking of the boy’s education.” Slughorn says sheepishly. “He’s much easier to teach this way. But of course you’re right. We’ll do the testing overnight and administer to Mr. Malfoy in the morning if all goes well.”
“So we go on a few dates and now you think you know everything about me?” Draco asks, forgetting his previous worry of labelling their dinners together. It doesn’t matter now anyway.
Harry dropped his own spoon to the table with a clatter. “He said that to you?”
Turning back to his potion, or what’s left of it, Harry sighs. There’s enough in the cauldron to continue but the portions will be all off and Harry isn’t talented enough to compensate for that on the fly. Regardless, what’s the point? It’s only a matter of time before Malfoy tips it over again, except on purpose.
Don’t forget this is your potion we’re looking into,” She says, hands on her hips.
“Oh right,” Potter says, his tone changing completely. ”Sorry. I didn’t mean it like that, I was just…er…I meant it…um…playfully?”
Harry hesitated. As much as he despised it, there was a certain safety to the pretence. But an unbearable numbness to it as well. He sighed and started small: “I don’t hate you.”
him. Harry lunges for his wand and throws a hasty stunning charm that misses, but he’s already sending a second, a third and a fourth in quick succession. One of them finds their mark and the brute who looked about to bite Malfoy falls to the floor. The remaining attacker keeps hold of Malfoy, holding him between Harry and himself like a barrier. That’s when Harry notices the large tear in Malfoy’s shirt and the blood covering his chest.
Malfoy shrugs. “No, Potter, I’m dead serious,” he says tonelessly. Harry has no idea what to make of it.
“Can I get you a drink?” Draco asked, simply to have something to say (other than
Malfoy had the advantage of the headstart. He was closing in on the snitch and Harry knew if he didn’t do anything the bastard was going to win. So, he acted instinctively. Thinking only of the win, he raised one hand from his broom, stared Malfoy right in the eyes, and blew him a kiss.
It’s not until the itching sensation heightens that it hits Draco. That witch. She’s not turning up. She’s not turning up so Draco’s compulsion charm will activate and he’ll be forced to check himself into hospital. It’s cunning and deceptive and so very Slytherin. Draco should have realised earlier. He stands up abruptly and finally leaves the disgusting pub, taking a turn out into the cold chill. He pulls his coat tighter around him and walks along the street, planning his next move.
“I don’t want– let’s stay.”
“Mr Potter, outside please,” she says quietly once he reaches them.
Guided by his friends, Harry finally heads to class, but his mind wanders. Nott said Malfoy would be out of the hospital. So where is he? Did something else happen? Harry knows he is overthinking but how can he help it? This is all his fault.
Ron and Hermione barely blink as Malfoy sits down at the Gryffindor table. Harry had warned them ahead of time to be respectful but they’re laying it on a bit thick.
But he’s getting ahead of himself. The dream. Yes, the dream. How to describe the dream? At first everything is dark and Harry isn’t paying too much attention, his sleeping mind drifting from one unconscious thought to the next, and then a small light catches Harry’s eye – or his mind’s eye he supposes as this is all happening in his head – so he walks towards it – or mind glides or whatever the equivalent is. Okay, you get it.
Now that was more like it. Harry stepped inside and followed Malfoy into the Sitting Room. He kept his eyes high, trying not to notice how short the robe was from behind. It didn’t appear as if Malfoy was wearing any underwear.
There’s a point when Harry thinks he must be imagining it. That the smallness of Malfoy’s dorm, the smallness of his bed, has made things seem more intimate than they really are and that Harry is just reading into it. Reading into the smiles Malfoy sends him when Harry’s thoughtfully debating his next move in chess (because Merlin, Malfoy is difficult to beat). Reading into the glances Malfoy sends him almost constantly even in class when he probably thinks Harry is not looking (but of course, Harry is always very conscious of Malfoy’s presence at any time). Reading into the compliments Malfoy gives him with increasing frequency and reverence:
to be guilty.
Draco starts moving forward again with slow steps. “Then why haven’t you killed him yet?”
“We’re not fighting,” Harry said again, eyeing Draco for support.
started it.”
Potter’s eyes dart to the plate in front of Draco and then back to his face. “Draco – “
“But you don’t often use them,” Potter countered. Which was untrue of course.
“I don’t agree with that either, obviously,” Hermione says, “but letting Malfoy get to your head is not helping.”
Draco’s words cut off in favour of a deep sob that launched itself from his throat. A new round of tears streamed down his face. He dropped his head, rubbing at his face furiously.
“No need to act so enthused about it, Weasley,” drawled a familiar voice from behind the door. “You’ll embarrass me.”
“There’s nothing else to say! I don’t know. It’s like,” Draco said, feeling more and more foolish with every word he spoke, “it feels almost like it’s
“But if he–”
“GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME,” Malfoy drops the knife from Harry and brings it back up to point at Draco along with his wand. His voice is rising and falling unpredictably. “I don’t need you in my head. I don’t want to feel that way again. You can have fucking Potter, just LEAVE ME ALONE.”
“Somewhere they actually clean the tables between guests.” Potter finally says light-heartedly. Again: so right.
“Waste my time?” Harry interrupted, standing up. “I’m an auror, not a phoney philanthropist.”
“Nice try, Potter. But you are nothing to me. Don’t forget it,” interrupts Malfoy harshly. “Now either you shut up of your own volition or I’ll make you.”
Harry turns around slowly to come face to face with Blaise Zabini. A very angry, very tall, Blaise Zabini.
“Yeah,” Harry said, running a hand through his hair. “I guess it will.”
Harry loosens his own and pulls it over his head, offering it to Malfoy. “Here, you can transfigure the colours.”
There’s a second where Harry thinks Malfoy’s about to agree but then his face shuts down and he stands up, walking away from Harry to the top of the bed.
“For your own conscience,” Malfoy replies, just as cryptically. “And for the Ministry. I know how they do hate complicated moralities.”
Draco snorted. “Don’t be so outlandish. You know that’s not what I meant.”
“Everybody knows that,” Potter replied, just as casually.
“I could ask you anything.”
And Draco thought he had hidden it so well! “I’m

Draco considers this. He wouldn’t have pegged Potter as the fancy restaurant type. Especially not the fancy restaurant that serves a £450 bottle of wine. He wouldn’t have pegged Potter as the going out for dinner type at all. Except maybe to the pub. Urgh. Pansy wants to meet him at a pub tomorrow. Revolting.
When Malfoy places his knife back down after carefully crushing some ginkgo seeds, Harry finally spares another glance at his own cauldron. To his horror, it is releasing a strange purple steam and is definitely not the light cream colour described in their textbooks. He looks over to Ron beside him desperately but Ron just looks at his cauldron perplexed and shrugs. Harry starts to panic. He wouldn’t usually. Potions go wrong all the time, his included, and he would usually shrug it off just like Ron, but this time something doesn’t feel right. His stomach clenches, his throat constricts and his hands are shaking of their own volition.  The room starts to blur and he’s worried he might faint, until a firm hand on his shoulder steadies him and a calm whisper brings him back, “Breathe, Harry, breathe slowly.”
“Actually, Potter, I think you’ll remember the first thing I did was offer you my friendship. Which
Draco didn’t expect Potter to have the same appreciation for astrology as he did but it hadn’t even been a minute. He should have realised Potter had the patience of a toddler.
‘Ron!” Hermione half yells, half whispers. They have moved down to the common room but there is still a chance their voices might carry up to the dormitories. “This is serious. Slughorn said Malfoy was dangerous.”
“Harry, I truly am sorry, but in my defence, you did suggest we ‘hang out for dinner’ and that I could ‘invite anyone I wanted.’”
“I have far more than
like nothing.”
He stepped in close to the waiter as he accepted the glass. “Lose the bowtie,” he whispered.
Pansy jumped up from the bed, a victorious smile on her face. “I knew it! You have a thing for Potter.”
“There is no documented potion that combines both asphodel root and nightshade,” Hermione says impressively as if this is supposed to be a major breakthrough. Except it means absolutely nothing to Harry, and Ron as well it would seem from his clueless expression.
It’s not like Teddy didn’t know what was going on. He was a perceptive kid. The whole situation was ridiculous.
Ron doesn’t reply for a moment. The room is still and Harry starts to think maybe Ron is asleep until: “Why are you worried about him?” Ron asks slowly. His voice is measured and Harry can tell his friend is trying to remain calm for his sake.
“You sound surprised,” Harry replies, not bothering to whisper back. Albus and Scorpius are too far away to hear them, already making their way onto the Hogwarts Express, holding hands as they had been all Summer.
Malfoy leans back on his elbows and looks up at Harry through deliciously long eyelashes. “I thought that was obvious, Gryffindor.”
“Excuse me?” Harry asks, now feeling confused himself.
“He knocked into me. I didn’t–”
Potter didn’t say anything for a moment, but he remained staring at Draco. The silence was more pronounced under the intensity of that gaze. Finally, he smiled. “Well, seeing as I’m your date now, you have plenty of time to get to know me.” He tilted his head. “And plenty of time to reflect on your prejudices.”
“An eating disorder.” Potter repeats.
Everything feels right.
“Malfoy,” Harry interrupted. “You’re not resigning. Sit down.”
Draco led out a shuddering breath and closed his eyes. Potter was going to kiss him. And Draco was going to let him. He could feel Potter leaning in closer; he could feel the magnetic pull between their lips; he could feel the ghost of Potter’s breath before–
Malfoy’s lips are surprisingly soft, but certainly not unwelcomingly so. Wet too. But Harry hardly notices the sharp pelts of rain anymore, his sensations fully focused on Draco Malfoy before him, and more specifically, Draco Malfoy’s delicate lips.
“But…“ Ron begins at Harry’s back and then almost immediately falters.
When Draco finally turns up in first period Potions, Harry moves lightning fast, taking the seat beside him before his Slytherin friends can. He hears the snickers of Parkinson and Nott behind him but he doesn’t care. He’s been losing his mind the last few days without Draco.
“Language, Harry,” Kingsley reprimands.
being the little spoon. So did Harry. But it was his best bargaining tool.
“No need, Potter,” he says again, and his hand lingers for another beat before he turns back. Now, he approaches the bed, his long fingers trailing the edge of a bed post. “Were you looking for a repeat performance?” he asks, back to Harry.
Draco took a slow sip of champagne to hide the colour that he could feel springing to his cheeks.
Draco relaxed as his orgasm subsided but he didn’t take his eyes off Potter. Potter was something else. He really was. He was hot and
Potter apparated them both as soon as they were free of the Ministry wards, and then…it started.
“Haven’t I just done that?” Harry looks back down at Malfoy, but he has already turned away, slumping against the back of the cage.
A question mark? Is the map not sure? The map has never not been sure before. Even when someone is under the effects of polyjuice potion, the map still knows their real name. How can it not know whether this is Draco Malfoy or not?
Oh shit.
What Draco
“Why are you still here, Potter? You’ve clearly been stood up,” Malfoy bit back.
. I might be dead but I still expect a level of respect from students.”
“Yeah, I did.”
Midway through their fifth game of exploding snap, Harry recalls something Malfoy said to Zabini earlier. He pulls his eyes away from the game pile to gauge Malfoy’s reaction. “So, you don’t hate me?”
, he had, it certainly didn’t include Potter sleeping on a bundle of pillows on Draco’s bedroom floor, fully clothed. And Draco tucked up alone in his king bed, also fully clothed.
Potter’s hand drifted up to trace the outline of Draco’s lips. “Then maybe it’s you who’s been missing out.”
Everything was too obvious. Why didn’t people know? Why weren’t they looking? Draco wanted to scream at the top of his lungs:
“So, what’s our next move?” Harry jumps up and begins pacing Kingsley’s office. “Stakeout at Malfoy Manor? Trailing duty?”
“I thought as much.” Draco’s voice says, not as distant as Harry had hoped. “You’ve always been the good one. Even now when…But you’re right. We shouldn’t. It will only confuse things. But-“ Draco’s voice turns into a whisper – “I want you to know
the work – and pulled his hands up onto the table to lift himself up a little. In the process, he accidentally knocked his Potions textbook to the floor with a loud ka-plunk, but he wasn’t particularly concerned; his only thoughts were of Draco and how those lips would feel against his. Would there be sparks? Electricity? Heat? He was feeling all those things in his body just from the anticipation alone so he knew it had to be something more.
Of course, Hermione isn’t too happy when she finds out where Harry has been. He debates not saying anything, but he figures what he’s learned might come in handy. And Hermione really is the brains of their operation after all. The one who can connect all the puzzle pieces together.
“Potter! Please!!” Draco interrupted reflexively. Potter was just so damn straightforward.
Harry thought he understood Malfoy’s meaning quite plainly. “Blaise?”
“I hate to break up this little soiree,” says a smooth cold voice, slipping through the crowd. “But you need to get your grubby hands off my son right now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fine, Healer Malfoy,” Potter agreed with a wave of his hand (that seemed to put him off balance and start him swaying again). “So, is that a yes?”
Draco senses Potter talking to him from where he’s returned to the kitchen, but the sounds are too muffled to hear fully. Instead, Draco focuses on calming his dizzy head. Really. Anyone would think he was a teenager again. This is what Potter reduces him to. No wonder he’s been keeping his distance.
And Draco’s favourite:
Ron didn’t reply which meant yes. In the silence, Draco rehearsed what to say to Potter. He’d start with an anecdote about his father, setting the scene, then he’d explain his reservations about their relationship and finish with his feelings, if only he could work them out by the time they reached his dorm.
Potter smiled - a shy, half smile that made Draco want to forgive him. “Did you wanna go?”
Draco calmly set about mixing his paints. He’d perfected a particular shade of green only the day prior, and he wanted to get it exact. He had plenty of time to get it right before he needed to begin sketching. Quidditch practice didn’t start for another twenty minutes or so.
“Maybe you can warm them up?” Harry suggested with a not-so-subtle raise of his eyebrows, leaning up again.
And he had turned up to find out Draco had invited Pansy and Blaise, thinking it was a group dinner. Harry had had to excuse himself while Draco sorted out their table – “Oh no, the reservation was for six people, wasn’t it Harry? You must have misheard him over the phone” – and call Hermione and Ron to urgently join him.
There was a strange coldness to Draco’s words that Harry couldn’t understand. He’d thought by showing Draco this memory, of his shame and regret, that Draco would see what he’d be hiding all these years. Not deny it.
Harry wakes up in a cold sweat, his breathing labored. He takes a quick look around to make sure he hasn’t woken his dormmates, before settling back into bed, stubbornly ignoring his body’s inappropriate reaction to whatever the fuck that just was.
!” McGonagall’s voice cuts through the crowd and she steps out beside Ron. Dried blood covers her robes but she has no visible wounds. “Look around you.” She gestures at the crumbling walls. “All this is finally over. Don’t extend the misery.”
Shit. Shit.
“I’ll have you next time, Potter, just you wait.”
“You can’t or you won’t?” Harry challenges.
“Oh.” Draco closed the door and turned to Harry, crossing his arms, his demeanour instantly changing. “Then what are you doing here?”
“Harry?” Draco called out softly, bringing Harry back down. He must have been staring too long.
laughing. And it was all a bit unsettling. Potter had never laughed like this around Draco. He had seen Potter laugh with his friends of course, but always from a distance. He’d never been close enough to really hear the sound properly, or see the lines on Potter’s face. And with the vision charm still in effect, he could see every crease line - every ripple across Potter’s face with each bout of laughter. There was something about the way Potter laughed. It was a little too relaxed. A little too free.
Malfoy shrugs. “You saw the tie. You didn’t say anything.”
“Don’t

unwelcoming, and Draco worried even his favourite day wouldn’t be enough to get Potter on side this year.
“Who are you talking about?” Harry tries again, desperate to understand what could have turned Malfoy into this. A small voice in his head reminds Harry that this was him. His potion.
Malfoy laughed and Harry didn’t particularly blame him – Harry was acting like a fumbling fool. He was making this too easy for Malfoy. “I didn’t realise we were in kindergarten. You’re a grown man, Potter. Just accept you lost fair and –
When Malfoy, instead of moving to his standard third from the front, far left desk, takes up residence in the seat beside Harry which he has no place being in because it is in the back row, far right. And next to Harry!
Draco nodded against his will -
Harry recognises Ron’s voice behind him, quickly followed by Hermione’s. His eyes had been so focused on the two Draco Malfoy’s, he hadn’t even noticed that they had disappeared and clearly found their way around the shelving to surprise Malfoy from behind.

every year.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying, Potter.”
Harry took a deep breath and rolled his shoulders back. He could handle a snotty rich kid. He headed over quickly, conscious of the mounting coffee orders.
Potter still hasn’t looked up. He is fumbling around in his pocket his face screwed up in concentration, until he pulls out a set of glasses. Of course! It seems silly now that Draco couldn’t pick it. Who is Harry Potter without his glasses?
Teddy kept giggling, dropping his spoon back into his bowl with a splash.
Dating Draco Malfoy still felt a little unreal to Harry. It seemed as if they went from rivals to lovers with nothing in-between, and Harry hadn’t been given the time to process it all.
“So, fit waiters are okay?” Potter asked, a slight up-tilt returning to his lips.
Potter, of course, wasn’t impressed. “You’re a free elf now, you don’t have to listen to him,” he said to Dobby in a gentle voice before turning to Draco and fixing him with a chilly look.

Harry takes a step back, blinking. What was he just about to do? “Sorry. I didn’t mean to – “

Draco dropped his gaze to take in Potter’s face. It really was a sight when he laughed - full and joyful and pure. Draco never wanted to look away.
Harry’s eyes fall to Malfoy’s lips, so close to his face. Surely, he doesn’t think –
Dobby returned, handing Draco a mug identical to Potter’s. “Your tea.”
Draco didn’t appreciate the implication. “Of course I know what it is.” He paused, taking a sip of his coffee to give himself time to remember the name they had told him in his course and -

“Do you accept?”

Quite expectedly, the note leaves Harry confused. Firstly, why has the note been delivered to him rather than Mrs. Malfoy and secondly, and more terrifyingly, “keep him contained”? What does that mean? It sounds as if they’re treating Draco as an animal rather than a human being. He looks back over to the owl for at least an answer to his first question.
Pansy ignored that. “So what is going on?”
“Are these
“Fine. I’m going to follow Malfoy. But you can’t stop me.”
Of course Draco noticed that and swiveled back around. Teddy quickly changed his face to an innocent smile but he was too late. Draco had caught him.
Draco lifted Harry up so that he was sitting on the desk, his legs wrapped around Draco’s waist. And getting pulled in tighter by Harry Potter’s thighs really was a experience Draco would recommend to everybody if he didn’t intend to keep this man and said thighs all to himself for the rest of forever.
No, not Azkaban. But still somewhere cold. Surrounded by death. Trapped. Indefinitely. “It feels a little bit that way,” Draco admits.
“Yes, but Slughorn might.”
Draco steps back from his mother and turns to Harry. They stare at each other a moment. There are so many things Harry wants to say but he can’t voice a single word. Draco presses his own wand into Harry’s hand and then drops his gaze. He sighs, straightens his shoulders and pivots. He steps around his mother to stand before the cage, hands shaking.
day where any escape seemed futile.
spread to the tips of his ears. The real giveaway came when Malfoy simply gave up. “
Harry’s jaw dropped open. This was ridiculous. Could Malfoy not hear how silly he sounded? This was Draco Malfoy. And he was Harry Potter. And it was the middle of a Quidditch match.
Harry’s senses are overloaded with Draco, fresh spearmint – his breath, dazzling grey – his eyes, heat, electricity, spark – his body so close, all but touching, and absolutely and completely kissable – his lips. Harry tries not to stare at them, he does. Because he already knows he can’t. There’s no temptation strong enough.
Something tells Draco to look up – whether the scent of Potter or the sound of his footsteps, Draco can’t be sure – so he does. And sure enough directly in his line of sight is Harry Potter handing over his coat to the maître de, his lips moving. Draco’s not close enough to hear, and he’s hopeless at reading lips so he fills in the conversation in his head.
,” Potter said as if it were something dirty. “You have to love me for this to work.”
Potter, what have I done wrong this time? Did I
“Harry, you don’t get it because you don’t have a girlfriend.”
“Here, take these,” Draco said, dumping a pair of pyjamas into Potter’s lap - nothing flashy, just the silver, silk ones he’d been gifted last Christmas. “Just so you know I’m
“Are you alright?”
Percy poked his head into the bathroom. “Quiet down, you two. I’ve an appointment with– what on earth did you do to your hair, Harry?”
Malfoy stares at him a little longer before answering. “I’ve always been lonely, but this is worse.” He sits down on the bed and looks up at Harry with hopeful eyes. “Will you reconsider chess?”
There’s plenty of question he wants to ask, but he’s not so sure he’s ready to hear the answers for them yet. So, he starts with something easy.
Harry had iced and decorated all 316 cupcakes with the Slytherin crest – one for each of the Slytherin team in addition to the crowd in attendance. On a whim, he’d made a custom cupcake for Malfoy to really show him up, but he was starting to regret that decision. He’d already levitated the cupcakes out to the crowds and now he hovered high above the pitch, holding tightly onto the remaining cupcake in one hand, waiting.
impressive. And then it hit. “Oh. You’re the jock.”
He returns to the Gryffindor table, ready to set the whole incident from his mind. If Malfoy’s out tomorrow, it can’t be that bad then, can it? Harry simply panicked for no reason. Everything is fine now.
Malfoy’s face is so sincere, Harry wants to believe it. He wants to trust Malfoy. Before he can make up his mind, a familiar feeling in his pocket interrupts his thoughts. The Homenum Revelio charm must still be working.
“I might have been.”
“Harry!”
Draco’s eyes dropped to the mug in Potter’s hand. “Same as you, I guess.”
“A busy day for you, then?” Draco commented politely, a disingenuous smile covering his real face.
“To your own son, Narcissa?” Interrupts Madam Pomfrey, almost dropping the potions as she hastily steps in front of Draco’s mother. “Surely –
“I started being civil,” Harry corrected. “I didn’t turn it into this.”
“And lose all my gold?” Draco half-shouted at Harry’s computer screen. “And items? And stamina points? Are you kidding me?”
The way Draco said it, it was like he
“Your hair’s long,” Potter pointed out with all the conversational skills of a seven year old. Draco was about to tell Potter exactly that when he added, “Just so you can’t call me unobservant again,” with a playful wink.
“No,” Potter said again, his voice prickly, “it’s really not.”
Zabini’s hand snaps up to rest against Harry’s chest, pushing him against the door behind him. Harry’s hand falls from his pocket and with it the hope of retrieving his wand. Perhaps he shouldn’t have spoken so brashly. “Don’t try and turn this around, Potter. You’re the one who turned him into this…this…”
It’s not such a flash set-up, using a Ministry holding cell as a temporary distribution centre but Malfoy looks right at home, bottling several vials of Wolfsbane at a time, even with his wand tucked behind his ear.
Draco ignored Pansy’s taunt and focused on her theory. A threefold twin bond. It sounded ridiculous. But what if she was right? What if the universe kept throwing Potter at him because they were destined to be together, as much as they were destined to be enemies? “So how do you know if you have a threefold twin bond then?”
, at least silenced Potter. His laughter died down and he stared at Draco strangely as if waiting for it to happen again.
favour?” Draco asked, glad Healer Gibbons wasn’t around to hear him speaking to a “patient” with such undisguised frustration.
“I’m not your informant. I told you about Teddy so you would have some compassion for the Dunbergs. That is all. I have nothing more to say to an officer of the law. I suggest you fix your mistake.”
“No,” Potter said, raising his own voice higher still, “it’s not.”
“Oh,” Harry said, a smirk forming on his lips, delectably red from the kiss. “Is
he looked good. But he couldn’t help the doubt from sneaking its way in. What if
Harry dropped the cupcake when he recognised him. “
“Potter,” Malfoy says again, his voice faltering.
And then through the mass of redheads, Draco saw, behind Ron and Hermione, a jet-black head bobbing towards them. He acted instinctively with a wordless
day when it fucking mattered, he’d left the house in a daze, just for a quick, lazy coffee. He’d run a comb through his hair at least, but still! He wasn’t even wearing a collared shirt for fuck’s sake. He looked positively pedestrian.
“NO, IT’S NOT!” Screamed Potter back at him.
“What are you doing here?” Malfoy asked.
Draco turned his head to gauge Potter’s reaction - he was worried he might be mad. But Potter’s eyes were closed, his expression blank. “You have to stay,” he said in his sleep.
had gotten him off.
“We–” Harry starts but Hermione interrupts him.
Potter?” He asks.
That caught Draco off guard. He obeyed but only out of shock.
“Yes, Draco,” Potter answered immediately, his voice louder now, less cold, “because that’s what love is! A potion or a spell can’t tell you what to feel, you have to actually
“I don’t care anymore.”
with his tongue? And oh merlin, yes, this had
“But despite all that,” Ron continues, “you love him and he loves you so there’s no excuse not to try and make it work. He owes you that much.”
Harry isn’t sure who starts it but all at once their kiss speeds up, delicacy lost. Harry’s other hand clings onto Malfoy’s waist, Malfoy’s hands are in Harry’s hair, holding on so tightly it should be painful. And Harry can no longer ignore the pelting rain, instead each drop that bears down them seeming to complement the kiss, heightening every feeling.
Harry gently pushes her hand away. “Don’t force him.”
“You’re distracted,” he pointed out, pulling his lips away from Harry’s neck which he had been showering with kisses. They’d skipped lunch in the Great Hall to sneak into an empty classroom together.
“Yes, Ronald. Yes.”
“Because I’m trying to – merlin, Potter, fine.” Malfoy stomped around Harry and then swivelled around to face him again. “Are you happy now?”
“Fine,” Malfoy snapped. “I’ll tell you, but - “ he looked around again – “can we go somewhere a bit more private?”
Potter’s smirk dropped. “I’m sorry.”
“I shouldn’t have to. The Dunbergs have done nothing wrong. Just leave them alone. It’s me you’re investigating anyway. Arrest me if you need to prove something to your superiors. Take me down to the station and question me. Throw your authority around a little.” Malfoy eyes Harry challengingly. “I know you want to.”
Although they aren’t getting many words out of Mrs Dunberg, Harry isn’t concerned. He doesn’t need them for this next question – any giveaway of the face will be enough. He leans forward. “Do you or your husband know Draco Malfoy?”
Alex looks through her arms at Harry. “You’re him,” she whispers.
“Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. If I’d known you were coming, I wouldn’t have brought– ”
Harry leans up to get a better view of the door and sees a tall shadow approaching. “Ron?’ He whispers.
“I don’t believe you. He’s changed since you spilt that potion on him.”
Malfoy stands up abruptly, the chess board falling back to the bed from where it levitated between them. “You should go now. They’ll be serving dinner.”
“Fine.” Harry triumphs internally. Malfoy takes a few steps backwards. “But tonight. After curfew. I fly better in the dark.”
“Yeah,” Neville adds. “For once in your life, don’t be a coward.” As soon as the words leave his mouth, Neville reddens and shrinks back into the crowd.
“I don’t believe you,” Pansy replies unsurprisingly. “With who?”
A chorus of gasps echoed across the stadium and Harry swivelled around, searching for the source, searching for Malfoy. Down on the grass, a man with bright red hair had walked out from the Slytherin change rooms in full uniform. He held a broom but he made no move to mount it.
So why can he no longer taste his food?
Draco thought to himself in frustration.
Clients? What kind of clients would a werewolf be taking? Harry remains still. Perhaps he should have listened to hypothetical Hermione’s advice.
?” he asked, shaking the impulse from his head.
“Is it” Draco whispered, eyes wide, “under the bed?”
“I’m not trying to prove anything. I’m genuinely worried about you. How can you think I don’t care at all after what happened last–”
Harry can’t look away, hypnotized by Malfoy’s eyes. He swallows. “Who do you think the alpha is now?”
‘Good morning, husband.”
“He’s not stupid, Malfoy. He knows we hate each other. All this pretending is rather silly.”
Harry is glad Malfoy’s eyes aren’t on him as he continues the massage. He’s not sure he could do it under such scrutiny. Malfoy’s shoulder is warm under his touch and pliant like Malfoy is relaxing into it. Too late, he remembers he is supposed to be healing Malfoy as well. He clears his throat and lifts the bottle of dittany again, carefully tapping another drop onto Malfoy’s cut.
didn’t like his dress robes? Perhaps purple had been a bit too exuberant for the affair. Perhaps
Draco gaped back at Potter for a moment. He was in two minds - one was impressed by Potter’s bravado, the other furious that Potter could be so smug - like he was really
Perhaps Harry’s intentions hadn’t been clear enough. Perhaps he should have been more straight forward with Draco. But really, wasn’t it obvious? Did he really have to say it?
to do with Potter. Everything.
Harry hears Draco clear his throat beside him. “I saw your divorce in The Daily Prophet. Did the Weas - did she find her soulmate?”
“Three hundred and–
Draco watches the waiter leave with a nod, and exhales. He looks down at the menu in front of him. It’s fancy. Probably leather bound, with visible stitching at the bind. It’s a far cry from the stained laminates at the diner Goyle had insisted on, but not quite as extravagant as the dragonhide menus from Zabini’s choice of restaurant last night. Draco traces his fingers over the embossed name. He vaguely remembers Potter suggesting it -
Draco’s phone rings again.
Draco blanked. He couldn’t think of a single thing, except the obvious. Which of course he couldn’t tell Potter.
“Harry, will you marry me?”
“Sounds like you care a little bit,” Potter whispered.
“You said Harry,” Harry finished.
“Good Afternoon, Mr. Potter,” Draco said formally, aware of Healer Gibbon’s eyes on him. “Please take a seat.”
on Draco’s lips was swallowed when Potter continued without waiting for an answer.
Harry looks between Zabini’s smirk and Malfoy’s apologetic frown. His insides are squirming uncomfortably. He knows he has no claim over Malfoy at all. But it still feels like a betrayal. Last night he was tossing and turning, all the while Malfoy enjoyed the comforts of someone else. It hurts.
“A-ha! Potter, do you have a little crush on me, do you?” He teases, leaning in to –
So, when Harry’s eyes open, his brain is much further behind. He’s not really seeing Malfoy pacing in front of him, or hearing Malfoy’s current rant, he’s sort of just floating in a very blurry, muted bubble. Until it pops and Harry’s senses are assaulted all at once. Taking in his surroundings once more, and that old burnt smell, it suddenly clicks where they are: The Room of Requirement.
Oh. Potter was
“I’m sorry, I didn’t…” A terrible thought pops into Harry’s mind, bringing the dread up from his stomach with it. “Will you still be able to cure him?”
“You’re the one who answered the door half naked.”
Harry bristles at Malfoy’s bluntness, raising his chin in response. “And I’m supposed to just listen to you even though you won’t explain anything?”
“Please don’t replace one denial with the next. I can’t bear it.” Pansy says flinging her head into her hands dramatically.
Instead of kissing her hand (like any polite society man would know to do), before Draco could stop him, Potter had clasped Pansy’s hand tight. “Harry Potter,” he introduced himself as they shook hands.
“Then why don’t you take your hat off and we’ll compare.”
A snarky
“Well, it’s certainly more cooperative than yours. I’ve brushed your hair fourteen times this morning, and look at it!”
“Okay. So how would you guess it would react with doxy eggs?” Hermione asks, a little too casually. Harry silently prays Slughorn won’t put the pieces together…
This time when Harry approaches the light, Malfoy’s blanket is lying a little lower, just above his hip bones. And Malfoy is shirtless. Good fucking grief, of course he is. Harry’s eyes trail over Malfoy’s pale skin, taking in every line, ever shade, every scar. Because there are several scars crisscrossing over Malfoy’s chest and Harry knows exactly what they are.
“I don’t know, Gin,” George said, “it makes him look a bit washed out.”
Against all Draco’s better judgement, he calls Potter.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “What the fuck– ” she repeated in a whisper– “did you do to your hair?”
“You’re not - are you actually - what are you doing?” He couldn’t tell if Potter was having him on or not.
Harry had regained his stroking, with a tad more enthusiasm that Draco knew he had spurred on (and what a feeling that was), and Draco followed closely, matching the rhythm naturally, his eyes flicking between Harry’s movements and his face. Draco wasn’t sure which sight he enjoyed more. Harry’s dick was wonderful of course, but those eyes,
“Only if you lose,” Harry challenges.
Draco’s mouth was back on Harry’s immediately, helped in part by Harry lifting his neck as far as it would allow, unable to wait for Draco to close the full distance. The kiss was just as hungry as their first, only this time, every time Draco pushed deeper into Harry’s mouth with his tongue, Harry could feel the pressure in the rest of his body as well, including a certain appendage that was no longer
After being introduced to a middle-aged lady who called herself Muriel the second, Draco excused himself into the house. He had to find Harry and tell him he’d had enough. That he was going home.
It comes out of absolutely nowhere. One moment Harry is sitting in Charms class, innocently focusing on the lesson, the next he’s fantasizing in great detail about fucking Draco Malfoy.
, play.
Draco regretted closing his eyes if only so he could roll them at Potter.  “With a brain like that, perhaps you should have been in Ravenclaw.”
“Draco!”
“Try me,” Harry offers.
“How could you possibly– ” Malfoy swivelled around, a light pinkness growing at the edge of his cheeks. “I have no such spot. Perhaps you’re not as clever as you thought.”
“What do you mean?”
“DRACO!”
“Would you mind awfully taking a photo of Philias and I, Draco?”
“Oh right,” Potter says quickly, turning away again, which gives Draco the suspicion he was thinking something else entirely.
holding his body even closer to Harry’s and –
“I’m Harry Potter,” Potter repeated on one note, just as Draco came close enough to see his face properly in the dark corridor. His eyes were closed, and his face looked oddly relaxed, a vacant look that gave Draco the impression Potter’s mind was far from their conversation.
Harry watches as Malfoy’s eyes dart between him and Zabini. He holds himself calmly but Harry suspects he is more nervous than he is letting on. “He can’t help me and I don’t want you to hurt him.”
want me to pretend to be your date to impress that man you clearly used to fuck?”
” she repeats. “What made you change your mind?”
The bed isn’t made, the blinds are hanging diagonally because they jammed when Harry tried an opening charm two months ago, and there are owl feathers scattered all over the carpet. Harry raises his wand to collect the feathers but Malfoy turns back and puts a hand over Harry’s.
Potter rolled his eyes. “I’m glad that I’ve been privy to this insightful analysis of Draco Malfoy.”
Potter - Harry  - blinked back at Draco, his face the depiction of innocence, clearly feigned. “It’s my name.”
Harry knows his face must be red with his anger. He can’t remember the last time he’d been so worked up like this. Not since Draco left. Draco Malfoy always had a way of drawing the uglier emotions out of him.
. “It’s a
“Well, you’re not doing a very good job of it then, are you?” Malfoy bundles up the newspaper and throws it with enough force to hit Harry in the chest. “You need to fix this.”
That was something then - at least he hadn’t been too obvious. Not like Potter, the raging hormonal man. ’Don’t worry, I’ve got you pegged.”
Then comes the waiting game. Draco isn’t usually so eager for dinner. In fact, before his mother’s doctor forced him into this unpleasant schedule, he would do all he could to ignore the clock between the late afternoon and night so as not to be reminded of the impending conventional dinner time. Especially since it was usually the time his mother liked to show up as well. Not anymore. Draco apartment is now magically warded against her. Actually, that’s why she sent over a doctor in her place. And look how that turned out.
“Come on, hurry up,” Ron was saying to the room. “Anybody who’s still here in the next five seconds will be bat-bogey hexed by my sister.”
“Excellent,” Percy said pushing past Harry. “Now we simply must get a move on. Come along, father. I’m sure Mr Malfoy doesn’t want to be late on his first day.”
“Don’t make me regret this.”
‘How is it that you look worse than me, Potter?” Draco asks, although he’s being a little facetious. A sweaty Potter is not necessarily a bad looking Potter. Not at all.
Harry can’t help but a smile a little but stops when he sees Hermione’s expression. “I need to go to Malfoy Manor.” He says, shifting the topic back to Malfoy.
“No,” Draco said, and he was pleased to realise he wasn’t lying. “But,” he added, wrapping his legs around Harry’s and leaning into him, “you might need to make this up to me.”
So focused on sulking, Harry didn’t even bother to search for the snitch. He just hovered over the field, trying not to let his gaze follow any movement, lest he accidentally make eyes with Draco Malfoy. But of course, that proved impossible when Malfoy followed him up and planted his broom directly in front of Harry's. He’d obviously given up on the snitch as well.
“Where
After that, it was back to dares again, which were almost always some variation of kissing someone else in the room, as if there was no other possible dare.
Harry feels some of the weight finally begin to lift.
“Is that a maybe?” Harry hedges. Actually having a real conversation with Draco Malfoy has put him in dangerous territory. Because now Harry’s even more desperate to spend time with him. And if Malfoy says no…
“An erratic heartbeat,” Draco repeated - he was making a habit of doing that. “You’re probably just unfit. It’s not un-“
“–I didn’t mean to–“
“Just go.
“What?” Draco’s voice had lost it’s edge but he hadn’t quite returned to politeness either. There was a softness to it that reminded Harry of Draco’s birthday earlier in the week.
“We all know the rules!” Dean Thomas said.
“I know exactly what he was going to say,” Mrs Weasley said through pursed lips. She looked over at Harry and her face softened immediately. “Go on then, dear,” she encouraged.
,” Draco said in a way he hoped conveyed his disapproval. “But I guess I don’t mind. It’s okay if you want to continue.”
Harry approaches Traver’s desk, one hand in his pocket hovering over the base of his wand.
Slughorn clears his throat. “It’s illegal to perform an unforgiveable curse. It would be my duty to – “
Harry barely manages to escape
Harry wiggles the doorknob slightly, just to see if it will give. It doesn’t. It’s locked. Looks like Harry’s not backing out that way then. If only he can get his wand out without drawing Zabini’s suspicion.
“You’re right, Harry. The source is incredibly biased but not in the way you would expect.” Kingsley delivers the final blow with a heavy voice. “It’s Narcissa Malfoy.”
There was a short silence and then a whisper in Draco’s ear, meaning Potter was a lot closer than Draco realised. “Come with me.”
Harry stared at the ring for a long time, letting the weight of it reach him. He hadn’t realised Draco would propose to him. Even now, when they’d been together almost a year, Draco could still sometimes be quite reserved when talking about his feelings. Harry had always imagined that he would be the one to propose to Draco and he’d been thinking about the right way to do it for some time.
“I’m attracted to you,” Harry blurted out. Definitely not how he’d wanted to put it. But it
“You have a sensitive spot beneath your left ear,” Harry said, and then immediately wished he hadn’t.
“Shut
“You need to make up,” Teddy said, matter of factly, as if it were as simple as shaking hands.
Draco allowed himself a sigh. It was a relief to hear. Even after spending so much time with Harry and his friends, he still often felt out of place, like an outsider.
“What? Why?”
Draco kept his eyes on his knees which he had propped up and crossed over in front of him. He was curious as to who or what Potter would dare, but he knew if he caught Potter’s eye, he’d just start blushing, and that was not something he wanted anyone to see. Not something he wanted
But Harry can’t give the game away that easily. He has to at least TRY and fight for his dignity, even though it has been dragged straight through the mud and then run over by a Thestral. He takes a breath and says in a pitch higher than he’s ever fucking reached before (because of course it would be now that his superior vocal range would be revealed): “What?”
“Fine,” Harry interrupts, stepping around Ron. “You go find Hermione and I’ll head after Malfoy.”
“Harry.”
to make it through. Because Draco Malfoy is a long way from fully recovering. Perhaps he’ll never get there completely. But he’s finally ready to try.
“Did anyone give you trouble at dinner?” he asks.
The wolf wants to growl in response but Harry’s in full control now. He frowns at Hermione instead. “I didn’t hurt him. And if I had, he deserved it.”
Draco relaxes and wraps his arms around his mother in return. He’s not overly keen to admit it but he’s missed her. It’s only been a week. But he has missed her terribly. And it’s all his fault.
Of course, Harry became suspicious. Perhaps he was also hurt that Draco dismissed his attempts at conversation most nights, in favour of sleeping. Regardless, he was probing. And Draco didn’t know how much longer he could keep up the façade.
“It’s not your job to protect people, Malfoy.”
“Have I been - “ Draco starts to repeat and then freezes. His whole face crumples. Sags. Harry recognises the expression - defeat. “You don’t know.”
Potter picked up right away. “Malfoy.”
“We’re not animals. I’m not just going to fuck you because my body feels like it.”
“You’re a prat,” Harry tells him. Malfoy only smiles wider – he must know how infuriating it is.
“Er. No reason. Just something that came to my head,” Hermione lies, very obviously. Even if Harry didn’t know Hermione was lying, he would have picked it. There’s no way Slughorn is going to believe it.
Not rhyming as I have no desire to be on your fridge (Have I not made that clear?),
As the sun rises, Harry sits there, with Draco Malfoy leaning on his shoulder, wondering if he’ll ever be this close to him again. He looks down at Draco and studies his face. Yes, it is identical to the other Malfoy. They’re part of the same person. But he was wrong earlier. There is something visibly different. It’s not their features that set them apart, it’s the way they use them. The way this Draco can look so sad, so vulnerable. And the way he can smile, so sweet, so genuine, exactly as he does now.
“I miss playing Quidditch with you. I’ve never seen anyone fly that well.”
The eighth years weren’t permitted to form part of the house Quidditch teams so they’d made their own. Headmistress McGonagall had permitted the new division under the condition that the games were played with impeccable sportsmanship. And so an unspoken challenge had arisen of which house could display the greatest sportsmanship. Before every game, the captain of each competing team presented the opposing captain with a gift or gesture to show their appreciation of the other’s house.
“And I suppose you’ll also speak at his trial?”
“I didn’t!”
Draco smirked; he couldn’t resist the opportunity: “Actually, my name is Draco.”
Draco turned to find Blaise saddled up next to him. He wasn’t sure what to make of the comment.
Malfoy makes a strangled sound of pain but manages to maintain his posture this time. “More,” he whispers between pants. “Distraction. Please.”
Harry feels Hermione’s hand on his shoulder. If it is meant to calm him, it isn’t working. He shrugs it off. “Do you know who broke in?”
Harry doesn’t know to react so he freezes. He just freezes. For the first time, he doesn’t have his eyes on Malfoy, but only because he’s sitting right fucking next to him and to stare at him from that complete lack of reasonable distance would be so terribly obvious.
However, Malfoy only nods and re-deals the cards. “You’re much better at this than me,” he says, with no hint of resentment, no hint of jealousy.
Potter didn’t look surprised but worse, he just looked unimpressed. He crossed his arms and stared at Draco with that one static look that made Draco want to fall inside himself and disappear. Draco couldn’t move - not even to return his arm back into the sling. Any move he made would be too telling under Potter’s eye. Why couldn’t Potter just stop staring already?
“It looks that way, yes, but–”
Hermione’s voice isn’t cruel, but it is challenging.
Draco, this
“You draw?”
“Charming,” retorted Harry. The offer wasn’t particularly convincing. He had known the text was too good to be true. He made to turn away.
Draco or Malfoy, Harry isn’t sure what to call him anymore, is out of school for two days. Harry searches for him at every meal in the Great Hall, at every shared class. He even visits the dormitory on the fourth floor but the same door no longer leads to that room with the fireplace. It’s just a supply closet now.
“Three weeks.”
It did.
Shit. Shit. Shit. “I do have one symptom.”
Luckily, the waiter didn’t push it any further. She smiled sympathetically and moved to the next table, leaving Harry with just his red face and Draco Malfoy for company.
“It’s our job.”
Harry isn’t really sure what he’s thinking. All he knows is that he doesn’t fully understand. “You said you had theories about Malfoy?” He asks, hoping to lead the conversation back into something more attainable.
But nonetheless, it’s perfect. And really the hospital isn’t all bad. The gown is of course. The gown is all kinds of hideous. But Draco can make it through. No, he’s
Harry points his wand past Malfoy’s head at the attacker, but he isn’t sure of his next move. He’s confident he can cast a strong enough stunning spell to knock them both out with one hit, but not before the intruder snaps Malfoy’s neck, or as the imminent threat of tonight seems to be: bites it.  He is saved from a decision by the spell that hits him from behind, knocking him unconscious.
Harry breathed in, looked into the eyes of Draco Malfoy, and decided it was worth it. That Draco was worth it. He’d finally found the words for what he’d been feeling for so long.
“Hmm,” Travers says, but Harry can tell they’ve already got him. “Tell me your conditions.”
Harry blinked back up at Draco for a moment. He hadn’t noticed from afar how impossibly grey the man’s eyes were.
“You can have your voice back when you stop being immature,” Mrs Weasley said, lowering her wand.
In his post-orgasm state, Draco felt the embarrassment hit him again. His face flushed with the thought of all the ridiculous things he had said to Potter. What were they supposed to say to each other now? His eyes darted over to the clock by his bedroom door - 11.59pm. It was late. Perhaps Draco could pretend he fell asleep and -
There’s something else too. Behind the fresh wounds there are long scars, starting at Malfoy’s neck and criss-crossing all the way down to his navel like someone had cut… A weight sinks in Harry’s gut when he realises what they are.
And so Draco was forced to witness Harry Potter in a fucking beret. Like the green tie hadn’t been enough. Like the execution of wandless, wordless magic hadn’t already blown Draco’s mind. As he finally shooed Harry Potter, his supposed
There’s invisible floo powder here as well. He grasps a handful and gestures to Draco whose eyes alight as the powder comes into view in Harry’s hand. Draco begins to stride towards him and Harry has the alarming thought he is about to be swept up in an embrace and thanked with a myriad of forceful kisses.  But of course the thought remains only a fantasy. Instead, Draco snatches the powder from Harry’s hand and walks straight into the fireplace. Far from a thank you, the only word he says is “Hogwarts” as the flames from the fireplace engulf him.
(See the end of the chapter for

Harry raises it with Ron and Hermione right after class but they don’t think it is as strange as Harry does.
Harry stopped stroking himself immediately and Draco was ready to panic and crawl up into a ball of embarrassment until he saw Harry was just reaching for his glasses.
Potter silently pulled a golden snitch from his pocket and placed it at his feet.
Malfoy laughed, but it was hollow. “Well, it is bad. Tragic, really. But you’ll laugh anyway.”
“Oh, you’re just
“Can I get you another drink?” Potter asked with an irritatingly charming smile as he eyed Draco’s half-finished glass of champagne.
“A lot of things. Many that I definitely won’t be saying without Veritaserum.” Draco dropped his hands and let his eyes fall to the table. There was a slight blush on the edges of his cheekbones that made Harry curious. “There is one thing, though, that I’ve been meaning to…” He trailed off and looked back up at Harry seriously. “I’m sorry,” he said. “For the big things. For the little things. For everything I’ve done that’s made your life harder. For every hex and for every line of ink in this stupid mark on my arm. I’m sorry.”
“Oh, yes. Probably. I mean, almost definitely,” Ron says hurriedly, while Harry tries not think about his earlier suspicions again. “But I’m sure she wouldn’t mind us waking her for this.”
Harry could have laughed. Malfoy’s voice was accusatory as if it were Harry’s fault for rejecting his soulmate so early. As if Malfoy’s attitude hadn’t played a starring role in it.
Professor Slughorn directs them to the recipe in their textbooks – a cooling draught used to cure fevers. It looks complex. Harry feels a little dizzy.
And seeing Malfoy during the day is another challenge. He ignores Harry, which isn’t anything new really. But Harry can’t exactly ignore him. He must look like a fucking stalker, the way his eyes follow every move of Malfoy’s. He tells himself each day that he’ll stop. That it has passed. That he’s over it. And then Malfoy will walk into the room and Harry’s head will turn so fast it gives him whiplash. He wonders if Malfoy notices. Surely, he must.
Potter’s playful tone relaxes Draco. If Pansy had been trying to convince Potter to take him to hospital as Draco suspected, then righteous do-gooder Potter would be far more serious.
Draco dropped his arm. He hadn’t been expecting that. “Why are you telling me this?”
Malfoy seems to be adamant on making Harry think he is ignoring him, without actually properly ignoring him. Harry might usually be an oblivious fool, but since his attention is focused on Malfoy whenever he is within visibility, it’s quite easy to notice the way his eyes drift over to Harry every so often, always disguised with a reason – a turn of his head as he coughs, a roll of his neck as he stretches, a twist of his torso as he itches the middle of his back. They’re all novice moves that Harry is very familiar with.
“He means during Quidditch,” Draco quickly covered up, crossing his legs tighter and internally vowing to destroy Blaise for the most mortifying experience of his life.
She shrugs. “Now there’s an actual reason to.”
Kingsley looks up at Harry. “Why?”
“You’ve just had your turn,” Ron reminded him. “You can’t– ”
Harry’s vaguely aware of someone slipping what must be the Invisibility Cloak over their heads and guiding them from the Great Hall, but he doesn’t break away, he only holds Draco closer, wanting this moment of ‘
“That’s…that’s not…”
Harry looks down at his feet. How could he forget? “No, sir.”
“Every side is your bloody good side,” Draco muttered to himself without thinking. Crap. There’s no way Potter hadn’t heard THAT embarrassing revelation.
Malfoy stepped into Harry and brought his lips to Harry’s ear. “And. What. Are. You. Going. To. Do. About. It?”
“What about work?” Draco asks. Pansy must have been here for a week by now.
“That’s-“
up against him.
Potter ignored that. “Tell me, Malfoy, are you into this? The phone sex I mean?”
So Draco leaned in and kissed Harry Potter again. But this time was different. It wasn’t about a fantasy. It wasn’t about kissing his boss. Or the saviour of the wizarding world. It was about Harry. Just Harry. It was about that moment and that moment only.
Draco’s words dried up in his mouth as Potter stood up, incidentally thrusting his (unfortunately clothed) crotch in Draco’s face. And that wasn’t all. Potter was - Potter was
Potter’s eyes darted over to Healer Gibbons and back to Draco. Then he stood up and walked to Gibbons, beginning a conversation with her in a hushed voice, as if Draco wasn’t even in the room!
Automatically, Harry lifted a hand to his head and pushed back his hair at the mention. Draco’s eyes followed the action. “How is that–“
“Well,” Draco says with a casual shrug, “You interrupted me before I could close them shut again.” He raises his wand and directs it at his own chest, whispering a string of strange spells Harry has never heard before
Zabini’s grip falls away, and Harry collapses onto the floor, his head a little dizzy from being held so tightly. He readjusts his glasses and slowly gets up, trying to put some distance between himself and Zabini. He ends up next to Malfoy.
” Harry continued, seeing Malfoy wasn’t impressed yet, “I iced them all with the Slytherin crest.”
Mr Weasley looked between Harry and Malfoy. “Accidental wandless magic feeds off our emotions. Anxiety feeds off our greatest insecurities. I would suggest that Mr Mal– that one of you is particularly insecure about the other’s opinion of them. That and his hair.”
“Come on, Malfoy,” he said, nudging Draco’s shoulder, “I’ll take you to bed.”
Draco uses the opportunity to look around. The kitchen is large, clearly built for a number of house-elves to work in for their masters, not for a single wizard to be doing all the work. Especially not one rich enough to hire any number of house-elves, now that it’s against the law for them to work for free that is.

There may have been fourteen players on the field but Draco only had eyes for one. Fast, lean, focused, Potter was like a bullet the way he shot across the Quidditch pitch. The other seeker didn't stand a chance.
Harry knew he had heard wrong. “Excuse me?”
Because Malfoy passes by him when Harry enters the Great Hall and whispers “Potter,” in his ear although he doesn’t say it exactly like that, he says it with several more syllables than strictly necessary. Which obviously raises alarm bells alongside Harry’s dick.
“No, I didn't!” Draco crossed his legs nervously. He immediately regretted it when Blaise’s eyes were drawn to the action, widening at the implication.
Harry scrunched up his face in mock confusion. “Who? Do I know him?”
“You won.” Harry stares at the fluttering snitch in Malfoy’s hand in disbelief. He had thought he’d had it. It had been hard to even see the snitch in the dark, but coupled with the pelting rain, it was practically impossible. Somehow, he’d caught a glimpse of tiny golden wings and he immediately sprung his broom to action. But that’s all he caught, a glimpse. Because by the time he’d seen it, he was already too late.
The man’s lip curled. “Malfoy. Draco Malfoy,” he said, still making no move to shake.
“Yes, it
“If it’s not murder, sure.”
“Oh, of course,” Malfoy said, his face softening and the smirk returning. “You’re quite partial to Weasleys, aren’t you? Ginny. Charlie. Or is it just redheads you like? How very Gryffindor of you.”
petty.
almost had me killed.”
“Oh, Draco!” Narcissa says, her eyes dangerously wet as she pulls Draco in for another hug. “Of course, of course.”
Draco jerked a hand up to cover his neck as everyone laughed. He didn’t dare make eye contact with Potter.
a big gesture.”
“Perhaps if I wasn’t so busy chasing this stupid niffler, I’d have the time to come up with something witty enough for you, Potter,” Draco retorted, mentally preparing himself to pull out his wand if Potter made a move - it seemed imminent. “Now if you don’t mind, I prefer it if you wandered somewhere else.”
“I want to kiss you more than anything,” he blurted out. He felt heat creeping up his neck. “But I didn’t want you to know that,” the Veritaserum compelled him to add, although it felt like a silly thing to say. It was too late now. Not only Malfoy but the entire eighth year knew. The whole school would probably find out by Monday.
“I know what Hermione had in mind,” Harry interrupted, pouring his batter into the last cupcake tin he could find. He’d have to do some cleaning before he made another batch. “And it’s not going to work. Malfoy might not be a Death Eater anymore but he’s still a Slytherin. He’s still competition.”
It’s not like he was doing any actual healing yet, just assessing patients with non-urgent conditions and passing them onto the appropriate specialist, but it was a start. And much more than Draco thought an ex Death Eater would ever be entitled to.
It made him wonder what Harry had told them and if he’d mentioned…the incident. Draco had been friends with Harry for most of eighth year, and in love with him for most of his teenage life. And two weeks ago, one of his wildest dreams had come true – Harry had kissed him.
Harry sinks down into a chair and waves his wand lazily. The potion vanishes.
Second year, they’d been having one of their regular arguments when it turned into something else. Draco couldn’t even remember who suggested it when suddenly they were on the Quidditch Pitch, alone, for a match of seeker vs seeker. How it was that nobody followed them, no crowd, nor their friends, could have been chance, but years later Draco would attribute it to the date: November third.
“It’s rude to answer calls at the dinner table,” Draco says with a shrug. Which is true. But also, he’s rather enraptured with Potter and he’s determined to -
“I can give you a tour?” suggests Harry, trying to get ahead of Malfoy, to assess the upcoming damage of other rooms.
“Are you sure you - “ Draco started but faltered when Harry pulled his trousers and pants down and took his dick into his mouth without hesitation. “
Malfoy rolled over to the edge of the bed, his back to Harry. “Get in then.”
“Go on, then,” Harry urged.
“Yes.” Harry said tightly. He wanted to say more to that revealing question but held it back, realising they’d already done enough damage in front of Teddy. “We’re not fighting,” He said instead, addressing Teddy.
“Harry Potter,” he clarifies.
He lets Potter order for the both of them again which is better than straining himself to read the menu or thinking about the awful food they serve in this place. Not that’s he had anything other than their spaghetti and meatballs. But if they can’t get a simple dish like that right, then there’s no hope for anything else on the menu.
.” Draco pushed Harry forward so his legs hit the back of his desk. “We’ve already gone this far.”
Harry laughed and released Draco’s hands. “And yet
That turned out to be impossible of course. Draco should have realised November third was not yet finished. The seat next to him was snatched up, rather boldly, by Harry Potter. Which could really only mean one thing - Potter had questions. Only this time there was no veritaserum to force them out.
Teddy jumped on the bed, eyeing the smoke excitedly - sleep would be well off now. “Did you get it? Did you get it?”
Draco was going to propose at midnight.
“I don’t like you, Potter,” Draco quickly clarified, just to clear up any confusion.
“Don’t scare him,” Harry whispered, moving to stand in front of Draco. He didn’t think humouring Teddy’s fears of the cupboard, which apparently Draco did every night, was the best parenting approach.
Draco gave up on the voice. “I’m not tired.”
Professor Flitwick seemed satisfied with that response (thank Merlin!), leaving Draco to finally appreciate the magic that was happening to his cock. Potter hadn’t even put it in his mouth yet, the fucking tease, he just kept running his tongue up Draco’s length with a torturous flourish when he got to the head.
“It’s not so much the restaurant itself,” Potter continues when Draco doesn’t reply – Zabini told him flat out yesterday he was horrible conversationalist and worse listener. “It’s just that it’s right beside the auror apparition point so I walk past it every day. After we try the food today, you never know, I might come here every night, or never again I suppose. I guess there’s a lot of weight on what I order. What do you think you’ll order?”
There was a loud swoosh behind Harry and when he turned, he saw George on the floor, tears falling down his face in laughter. Except he was completely silent.
Wednesday night is just a surprise as the previous. Harry, honest to Merlin and all that is magical, thought one dream was it. That it was just one strange betrayal of his unconscious mind that would never happen again. But that would be too easy, wouldn’t it?
“Fuck, Potter. Not until you’ve added the Pixie Dust.” Draco pushes Harry’s hand down, away from his cauldron. Harry looks down at Draco’s hand on his – it’s almost as if they’re holding hands. At Harry’s gaze, Draco snatches his hand back and returns to stirring his own potion.
Of course, Draco wouldn’t have minded if Harry threw his weight around a little. The fantasies Draco had of Harry often involved him doing just that - albeit with a few orders that would be highly inappropriate for the workplace. But no matter how obviously Draco pined, Harry still didn’t seem to notice. He really had no idea of his effect on people.
Potter,
The words were Harry’s but they fell from Draco’s mouth.
much better than Draco. Both minds were thrilled at the challenge presented, all the same. “You haven’t beaten me yet,” he reminded Potter, waving the snitch between them, the proof of his win.
Harry said the only thing he could think of. “Happy birthday for tomorrow.”
“I’m serious,” Malfoy said. He passed the firewhisky back to Harry. They’d almost drunk half the bottle. “Sometimes it’s like there’s a ten-foot wand shoved right up your– ”
hands on - “
“I don’t care if you don’t want to hear it. Malfoy confessed to a crime. We have to return and arrest him.”
Potter,

Potter understood regardless and pulled off Draco’s cock just as he began to come. It hit Potter’s lips first - those wonderful fucking lips - and then somehow it was everywhere. Draco Malfoy’s come. Dripping down Harry Potter’s face. Oh, fucking Merlin.
Theodore Nott sets down his knife and fork. “They’re letting him out tomorrow," he says calmly, diplomatically even.
“You’re lying.”
“I’m afraid I don’t. Perhaps you’ll need to spell it out.”
Malfoy looks past Harry’s shoulder, avoiding his eye. “It doesn’t change the fact that you’re in love with someone else. You’re not in love with me. As I really am.” Malfoy takes a shaky breath. “I’m not perfect like
And then Draco climbed up onto the desk, between them, as if he climbed on desks all day. Just jumped straight up as if it were as normal as breathing. Harry found he couldn’t give a thought to the fate of his paperwork, not when Draco was basically crawling over it to him. Merlin. Draco Malfoy was climbing over his desk.
“Because - “ Oh merlin, this was it - “Because I’m hard, okay? And I didn’t want anyone to see.”
Draco understood the implication clearly. There was no need for Potter to be quite so obvious. “By all means, Potter, sit if you must,” he said, making sure Potter knew it was less of an invite and more a resigned agreement.
“That was the idea, yes.”
Harry’s annoyed huff is drowned out by Ron’s chuckles. “Thanks,” he says sarcastically to his best friend before directing his perfected glare at Malfoy. “You’re a complete arse.”
Malfoy jerks his head up to Harry as he sits. Harry meets his eye. “I need to know what’s going on.”
Damn it all. Draco picked up his quill and started to scribble his own response back - bringing up his other hand to  cover the parchment when Potter tried to read over his shoulder.
Potter looked good. No, he looked like he could
Harry hopes in another few years, it may yet heal completely. But, regardless, Harry will spend the rest of his life making it up to Draco Malfoy.
Harry throws his glasses away. “Is my face telling you right now that I’d like nothing more than to kiss you because–”
“A minor disagreement?” Repeated Draco, his voice had returned to a cold politeness for Teddy’s sake, but he fixed Harry with a contrary expression.
that, didn't you?”
Harry blinks back at Malfoy. He cannot believe after a fucking home invasion of all things, Malfoy is flirting with him. And somehow Harry finds himself taking the bait. “I’m not innocent.”

“Aren’t you

“Good,” Draco said. It had been what he’d wanted to hear. So why did it make him feel slightly nauseous? “That’s…good.”

, to hear his pathetic history with Blaise.
“You specifically said it wasn’t a date? Sweet Helga Hufflepuff, it’s a date,” Pansy says, laughing now. For the first time since she saw him tonight she finally looks relaxed. Draco realises it’s his doing. Everyone always gets serious when they see him now. On edge. They treat him as if he is fragile either with overbearing fretting, or worse, cold politeness. It’s incredibly irritating.
But instead of saying any of that he settles on: “I don’t think I ever made up my mind in the first place.”
Malfoy pauses, Floo powder held aloft in his hand, but he doesn’t say anything.
Malfoy screams. Then, he screams some more. There’s no weight or emotion to the sound; it’s clearly not out of agony, or even shock, but for the drama. Harry’s all too familiar with how Draco Malfoy thrives on the drama.
Since it was his birthday, and Harry was clearly his birthday present, Draco allowed himself to stare. That always made Harry nervous. When they were making love, Harry was confident, unashamed, delightfully wild. But in the moments between, in the silence and the stillness, Harry became shy. Those moments were Draco’s favourites.
“When you tell me what to do,” Malfoy finished quietly.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Yes?”
“Did something happen?”
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s Harry’s fault of course.
“Who am I to deny you…” Harry starts conversationally before he realises what he’s saying, but it’s too late. “…stimulation?” He finishes weakly.
Everything had been easy for them from the start. They moved together perfectly as if in a dance. Each step as natural as the first. But this, finally, this, was something difficult. Something that made Harry feel sick at the thought of saying it, at the thought of the consequences if he had misjudged the situation, at the thought of rejection. But even sicker at the thought of not saying it, like if he didn’t let it out, it would come up forcefully all on its own whether Harry was ready or not.
“No, no, stop,” he says, raising a hand between them. “That’s not why I’m saying this, Potter. I don’t want to kiss you again. Ever. I just needed you to know that I truly am sorry.”
His next question came to mind just as easy. “What do you think of me, then?”
Draco shook off his annoyance at the easy win. Even an easy win had to be better than losing. And of course, now he had bragging rights. “Remember the date, Potter. November third. The day I beat you.”
“Isn’t it?” Potter asks, his indignance fading, his tone unsure, his face reddening rather rapidly.
Harry frowns. He has never been fond of secrets. Or people deciding they know what’s best for him without his input. Although, there’s a part of him that wants to trust Malfoy. A bigger part of him doesn’t. “Where are you going?” He asks more aggressively than he intends.
Draco tries to concentrate on the Doctor talking to him but there’s something distracting him. Something he feels like he’s missing. Something he should be doing right now. He checks the time. Just after 7pm. Dinner. He’s missing dinner. And it feels strange.
In Harry’s dreams, Malfoy always called him Harry.
That unbearable hopelessness takes hold of him completely, temporarily drowning out its running mate; jealousy. He lets it turn him around and walk away. He’s had enough of being a puppet.
, Potter,” Malfoy yells. “And for Merlin’s sake, please tell me they taught you something other than Expelliarmus in your Auror training.”
“I–” Harry stops himself from implicating Malfoy. Kingsley’s not unfair but he’s not the type to ignore evidence either.  "I just have a feeling,” Harry finishes, his heart sinking as he says it.
Harry frowned, looking over to Malfoy’s vacant four poster. The sheets were thrown wide, the pillow on the floor beside it. “Why?”
Ron doesn’t join in, or even crack a smile. He’s serious. Harry stops laughing.
“Huh?”
Weasley and Granger had stopped laughing. Everything was silent. Draco kept staring at Potter’s hand. It was shaking a little.
“What about what Harry deserves?” Hagrid suddenly speaks up. He remains at the back of the crowd but he towers over the rest and his voice carries. He peers down at Harry, his face a mix of confusion and fondness. “Is Malfoy really who you want, Harry?”
So, he agrees to Hermione’s reworked plan: Harry will visit the house to question Malfoy with Hermione in tow under the invisibility cloak. While Harry questions Malfoy, Hermione will cast all the monitoring spells within the Manor walls. Then, they will both leave together and go back to the office. No excessive stalking necessary.
