Harry sealed the note in an envelope, carefully printing the address Ron had left on his letters. He quickly wrote out a similar letter to Hermione. His hands shook as he finished stamping them.
“That sounds sick,” Dean responded. “I’m going to be around there for a bit with my family! I reckon if we get the dates right, we should be able to meet up for a few days!”
Draco scowled as he looked up at Potter. He was ready to snap off some quick-witted remark about Potter’s lack of parents when he saw how the other boy looked. Sitting slumped against such a large tree accentuated how small Potter was. The bags under his eyes were deep and he looked like he hadn’t slept in months. Dirt covered his clothes and scratch marks marred the boy’s arms and face, likely caused when he ran off blindly into the forest.
“I can’t believe its already the first day of our Fifth Year!” Hermione was speaking so quickly, it sounded like she was humming. Like she had already drunk three cups of coffee. “Do you know how important our exams are going to be this year? I feel like I’m already behind.”
“Where are you off to?” Sirius asked. He sat across from Professor Lupin, his hands curled around the tea mug.
Then the matter of the custody battle had arose and summer was quickly approaching, Ron and Hermione already planning to leave, and Harry had shut them out. He tried to convince himself it was for their benefit, to protect his friends from the shitfest that was his life, but there was a part of himself that knew otherwise.
When they arrived at the city center, they departed from the bus, Harry thanking the driver as they passed him. Sirius walked with confident steps through the streets. Harry tried to keep up with his quick pace while watching everyone around him, dodging left and right to get out of other’s way.
“It’s fine,” Harry chewed on his lip, thinking over what he had just been told. “I don’t really know what you want me to say.”
Harry woke up on Tuesday morning sweating. His window was open all the way and he had only slept with a sheet, but a mix of the summer heat and nightmares had left his bed shirt soaked. He headed straight to the shower to clean himself, knowing he would have to do a load of washing throughout the day.
By the time he heard Sirius start to descend the stairs, the eggs had finished cooking and Harry was portioning them onto two plates.
“That’s alright, Harry. I don’t mind telling you,” she placed her apple down beside her, picking up her magazine, holding it in her lap, but not opening the front page. “When I was young, my mother died, and I was with her when it happened. I saw the whole accident. It was really quite horrible. For a while after it happened, I was fine… but after a few months I started acting out, refusing to leave the house, hiding underneath my bed. Eventually, my dad made me go see this nice man who told me what I was feeling was completely normal. He told me, despite what had happened, that I was still me.”
“Literally, all I’ve done is sit with you at the movies and whine about my problems. I think you should raise your standards a bit, Luna.”
Harry tilted his head in thought. There had been conversations where Professor Lupin had mentioned his parents, but it had never been any different than Professor McGonagall reminiscing to him.
Sirius looked up from the papers he studied, his expression turning from troubled to joyful as he saw Harry. A smile adorned his lips as he looked at his godson.
Sirius felt a wave of nausea roll over his stomach. He sat up straight as he studied Remus’s panicked face.
He was just beginning to close his eyes, head lolling towards the other boy’s shoulder, when he felt Draco stiffen next to him. Harry’s eyes snapped open.
“If you can’t decide on a movie, I suggest you see that one,” A dreamy voice spoke beside him, causing Harry to jump.
“Pansy and I have been friends since we were toddlers. There’s no way we could ever date. She’s like a sister.”
Harry tried to ignore him, but when he looked up Malfoy and his friends were all looked at him in various states of amusement.
The man looked up from the books he carried. Even though he was far away, Harry could see the smile on his face as he looked to Harry and Sirius. He started to walk towards them.
The soft snores from the class was hidden by the monotone commentary running over whatever documentary was being played.
“Ouch,” Sirius jumped and rubbed his side. “Uh, yeah we’re just out for a walk. Needed to get out of the house.”
“I haven’t told Ron and Hermione because I don’t know how they would react,” Harry picked at the hem of his shirt. “I never even told them about Sirius’s existence.”
So, some of you may have noticed, I am no legal expert, and all knowledge I possess is thanks to google. This is also why everything I write seems American crossed with a bit of uk law. I by no means am writing from experience and so this fic is not realistic by any means. Sorry haha. That being said, I probably wont be able to change anything if it is majorly wrong, so apologies again.
Harry didn’t want to admit that he struggled to read things from afar. The glasses his Aunt had picked up from the store had helped his sight, but he had to sit up the front in most classes if he wanted to be able to read from the board. He wasn’t about to tell Draco that though.
“I know you didn’t mean anything by it, Harry. I felt the same way you did when my dad first took me to see my doctor.”
Reaching into his pocket, Harry pulled out his house keys, trying his hardest to keep them from jingling while he unlocked the door. It wasn’t late, but Harry didn’t know if Sirius would already be asleep. His Uncle had been notorious for sleeping early, waking at the crake of dawn, expecting him to have served breakfast. Harry had gotten good at sneaking around throughout the night.
“Can you promise me?” Harry breathed the question, unable to make his voice go any louder. At Sirius and Malfoys looks he continued. “Can you promise me if I make a statement I won’t have to go back there.”
Draco Malfoy stood at the reception desk wearing a white button up shirt and a pair of slacks. His hair was gelled back in its usual style. Beside him stood a tall woman with hair as blonde as Malfoys. She wore an elegant black dress and a brown fur coat.
She finally looked up at Harry. Her blue eyes sparkled, so like Draco’s and yet, completely different. The kindness she gave away so freely was never something her cousin could replicate. It was unguarded, and fierce.
Vernon looked ready to start screaming again but was held back by Petunia who gripped his arm, digging her sharp nails into his fat.
At the end of the Friday session, Mr. Malfoy collected the files that littered the kitchen table. He chatted to Sirius, scheduling the upcoming week meetings.
“Well, Father cancelled our trip to France because of your case,” He wanted to stop talking and leave it at that, but he could feel Potter wanted more from him, so he continued.
Potter was smirking at him and Draco couldn’t keep the amusement from showing on his own face, even as he tried to remain stoic.
Laughing, the two shucked off the dog. The setting sun left the room a haze of orange. The summer heat though dissipated, was still present. Finally, Harry pulled away from Sirius, scrubbing his hands over his face. The laughter continued to bubble out of his chest, but it wasn’t long before it turned to deep, uncontrollable sobs. Harry pressed the palm of his hands into his eyes, hoping the pressure would ease the stream of tears flooding down his cheeks. He couldn’t stop sobbing.
“Yes,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I am aware of my wife’s relation to you. As disturbing as I find it, I hardly see how it matters. I am not about to help you out of familiar obligations.”
Harry’s heart clenched at the thought of Snuffles losing hope someone would take him away from this place. He thought of his cupboard and how he would be if he were still stuck in that horrendous tight space. Harry wondered if he too would have lost hope.
“Regardless, it is a possibility,” Lucius rubbed at his temple with long, slender fingers. “Honestly, I don’t understand why we couldn’t have just offered a settlement for the child? It is not as though you don’t have the money, considering the fee you are paying for my services.”
Harry leaned against his head rest, knees tucked up to his chest while Malfoy sprawled belly down across his bed.
The three stared at each other, embarrassment clear on the faces of everyone. Remus cleared his throat, breaking the awkward moment.
His godfathers’ eyes were ablaze, and while looking at Harry, he kept the Dursleys within his range of sight. Sirius’s jaw was set. His back straight. He looked like the murderer he had once been convicted as. It was in that moment, that Harry saw the dangerous man Sirius had once been in prison. This was the man he had heard hushed stories about, shared between shocked social workers who couldn’t believe Sirius was the same man they had been warned about. This was the man who survived twelve years in Azkaban, by himself, despite his innocence. Anyone would have been frightened by the murderous glint in the man’s eyes. However, rather than feeling scared by this side of his godfather, Harry felt safe. Protected. It was in that moment, Harry realised Sirius would never let him go back to the Dursleys. Not without a fight.
Draco lowered himself back onto the couch, keeping his eyes lowered on the ground. With a huff, Harry paced over, dropping himself beside the other boy, the expensiveness of the couch completely pushed from his mind. They sat a good distance apart, each on separate ends of the large couch.
The class settled. Harry quietly unpacked his belongings, setting himself up for the class, glancing sideways at Ron who was rolling his eyes. The lesson passed agonisingly slow. Snape lectured the entire time, pausing only once to reprimand Neville for whatever issue he had taken up with the boy that day. Towards the end of the lesson, his eyes strayed over to Harry, and the boy waited for the insults to start. Instead, the man merely narrowed his eyes and continued his talk on modern vaccinations.
“But-” Sirius started, before being silenced by a sharp look from Remus. He sighed. “Fine. You’re right. I’ll walk you to the door.”
“I need custody of my godson. His relatives refuse to sign the paperwork and are taking the matter to court. I need a lawyer that will make sure I win,” Sirius closed his eyes. “Sad as it is for me to admit, you are my best option.”
The Judge took a deep breath. He shuffled through the papers scattered along his desk. The courtroom was silent apart from the rustling of paper and the heavy breaths of Vernon Dursley.
“The Hearing's tomorrow. That’s why we had to get out this morning. Couldn’t sit there thinking about it anymore.”
Harry and Remus bid the boy goodbye. Draco gave Harry a final small smile, before his expression dropped into the indifference mask he usually wore when at school and he exited to castle in the direction of the pickup zone.
Sirius was gearing himself up, ready to tell Malfoy he could shove it, when the man said something truly shocking.
Huh, Sirius thought. He remembered his cousin had been pregnant the same time as Lily, but he never thought much on the subject. For the first time in a long time, he felt hopeful about their situation.
She blinked her large, owlish eyes before looking up at him, quirking her head to the side. She was sitting on a brick wall, facing the courtyard. Behind her was a messy garden and in front of her, an empty silver bench.
“I knew this might be the case. I’m telling you now, so you know what to expect. I’ve got you though, Harry. No matter what, ok?”
“Listen to me, Harry,” Sirius placed his heads on Harry’s cheeks, making the boy raise his head to look at his godfather. “You are not crazy. You are a good person, who has had terrible things happen to him. No one is expecting you to be perfectly fine after all you have been through.”
Malfoy didn’t interrupt after that. Instead he listened with a blank face. His grip on his cane was so tight his hand was pale, and his lips were thinly pressed, but other than that he let no emotions lose.
And if he didn’t already feel like the shittiest person on the planet, those words were like a punch to the gut. Guilt clawed at Harry’s chest. Keeping his eyes averted to the floor, Harry simply nodded a single, slight nod, before grabbing his keys off the counter and walking out the front door.
But then Harry thought of all the things Mr. Malfoy was doing for him, to keep Harry safe and away from the Dursleys. He couldn’t just say no… could he?
Sirius wrapped his arms around Harry the second he was close enough. Harry could feel the tremble in Sirius’s arms matching his own shakiness. Sirius pulled back to look at his face.
“I understand, Malfoy,” Sirius whispered. “Why didn’t you just send them off without you? It isn’t like they need to stay for this.”
The conversation paused. Harry mulled over what the other man had said, biting his nails as he thought.
When the bus arrived, Sirius payed for both his and Harry’s ticket, and ushered Harry to the back seats.
When their laughter finally died out, they sat in silence regaining their breath. Potter was the first to speak.
They fell into silence, each awkwardly sipping their drinks dry. Once again, it was Remus that broke the silence between them, speaking more into his cup than to Sirius.
“Actually, speaking of the Malfoy’s,” Sirius segued the topic. “They have invited us over to dinner Friday night.”
Sorry Wolfstar has been a bit rushed. I am really new to writing it and I just hate when they fight hahaha. I just want them to be a happy family already tbh, but I will stick to it.
Malfoy stilled and for the first time since Sirius had stormed into the room, he saw a crack in Malfoys mask. Malfoy sighed.
“How about this. Whenever you feel comfortable, we can start small. I can come over after school, join you both for afternoon tea, maybe dinner, and we can work our way up to me staying over the night with Sirius. Only once you feel comfortable, of course. How does that sound?”
He ran into his bathroom to check himself out in the mirror. The pants were long, hanging over his feet, and they needed a belt to be held up but overall, they were still better than anything Harry owned. He rolled up the legs, so they stopped above his ankle, then smiled at himself in the mirror.
“Very well,” Mr. Malfoy started. “I am unsure how much your godfather has told you Mr. Potter, but I have reviewed your case and come up with a way that will grant Mr. Black with full custody.”
I know it's been way too long since my last update, and I apologise for making you guys wait. I started full time work at the start of the year and it's been more intense than I anticipated. On top of that, this Virus has been a real shit kicker that hasn't given me any time off whatsoever, and only increased my workload.
Harry was right. Draco’s mother finally looked up from what she was doing. When her eyes caught on her husband and the man next to him, her entire body stilled.
“Then why didn’t you call?” Remus’s voice trembled. “Why didn’t you come and see me after you got out?”
“I believe I have you and Draco in my class first thing tomorrow,” Remus indicated to turn right. “But from what I could see today, I take it you two are keeping your friendship on the down low.”
“Nice car,” Harry said as the driver door groaned shut behind the teacher. A loose spring in the passenger seat dug into his lower back and it stuck of motor oil and petrol.
“Harry’s home!” Sirius shouted from the living room. His shout was soon followed by deep joyous barks.
With another quick goodbye and beautiful smile, Luna walked off, opening the car door and sliding in. The hunk of metal protested with each movement she made, before taking off with a few splutters and croaks. Luna waved them off through the open window.
It was the day before their first court appearance and Harry felt ready to scream. Sirius had secluded himself to his bedroom where Harry knew he was still going over documents for their case. Harry was sitting at the kitchen table listening to the continuous drone of Snuffles deep barks. The dog was playing in the backyard, running around with an abundance of energy that Harry hadn’t been able to replicate. As he played, he barked and barked and barked, and Harry couldn’t help it when the irritation building in his stomach rose up through his chest and bellowed out of his mouth.
When he returned to the lobby, he started to head back to his seat when her heard a voice he would recognize anywhere. An unmistakable drawl that had Harry’s skin crawling.
It seemed that was all it took because Sirius was walking over to him, hurried steps and stiff movements. They stood together, face to face for what felt like minutes. Harry was
“Yeah, Ron, I’ll be fine. Besides, it’s not like I have the money to go overseas. Or even a passport.”
Lucius gave him an unamused look. The room suddenly felt warmer, and Sirius tugged at his shirt sleeves and collar.
“Oh, that’s wonderful, dear. And how are you feeling about tomorrow? I know my Draco has been very worried for you. He got his good suit out today to make sure it still fits.”
“You don’t have to pretend anything Sirius. I let both of you down, and I can’t expect you to forgive me for that.”
“We just wished you had of told us, mate,” Ron picked at the hole ripped in the knees of his pants. They had gathered at the Weasleys for the reunion, sitting under the shade of an old oak tree.
I hope this chapter is alright, I'm a bit new to writing Wolfstar. I hope everything wasn't too rushed.
I am going to apologise for my terrible attempts at writing Fleurs accent, because that shit was hard and inconsistent! But I wanted to put her in there to maybe set up some stuff up for later on.
“Uncle Vernon used to say horrible things all the time, and mostly I didn’t care, but he always used to say bad things about people like you, and how they deserved bad things, and I just used to hate it so much, but I couldn’t say anything because then he might think that I was like that and I was sure he would kill me!” Harry panted. “And I didn’t know you were like that, but now I do, and all I can think about is what he used to say he would do if he ever saw someone like you and I don’t want anyone to hurt you Sirius! I just found you.”
“Harry, you need to get up,” Sirius’s voice broke through the cacoon Harry had built of his blankets. “You’re going to be late.”
“I was doing so well!” Sirius exclaimed. “We were almost there! You’re getting the blame for this, Moony. You got me distracted!”
Despite everything, Harry found himself laughing along to his friends’ complaints. The sun beamed down on them and Ron had long since shed his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and untied his tie. Harry had loosened his own tie and removed his jacked, leaving his sleeves rolled down. Hermione’s uniform was untouched, immaculate as ever. The three of them walked across the grass fields to the bus pick up zones, where most the school was now gathered. The rowdy mood was unmistakable.
Without saying another word, the two boys started walking again, both noticing but neither talking about the spark of warmth they felt as their arms brushed against each other.
“Don’t tell me you’re going to start being fake nice to me just because I have a shitty situation right now, Malfoy.”
She gave in once they were safely in their seats, taking the packet of Oreo’s Harry had stashed in for her. After the movie they had gone home to Ron’s house. They spent the night in a tent they had set up in the field, trying to convince Hermione the stars they saw were the fictional planets shown in the movie.
Harry stuttered, thinking of the excuses and apologies he could give. Of all the things Harry could have said, he was surprised he managed to pick the stupidest.
Though he could never admit it to others, Draco had always been disappointed by Potter’s rejection. It was why when he saw Potter with Weasley and Granger at school Draco didn’t hold back. He sniped at Potter and his friends until the other boy rose to the bait. Draco knew well how to get a rise out of Potter, and he always enjoyed the fight given by the other boy.
“Morning,” Malfoy grumbled. He barely spared a glance Harry’s way, instead throwing disgusted looks around the house.
Sorry for the wait, I suck, I know. I have just been through all my old chapters cleaning things up. I didn't noticed I screwed up some formatting so hopefully that's all been fixed.
“You wouldn’t know it from the way things have been the last few weeks. I mean, Weasley sure has done a great job of being there for you this summer. Granger too. Where was it they both ran off to while you were going through a custody hearing?”
The laughter was back, and Potter had to hold his stomach as he threw his head back. Draco tried not to stare, but he couldn’t help but notice the other boy’s smile, his lips and his exposed neck. Something fluttered inside his chest, but Draco pushed it out of his mind, intent not to focus on his reaction to the other boy. Instead, he laughed along with the other until his stomach muscles ached, and his cheeks hurt from smiling.
“Nothing!” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. Another awkward silenced passed before Harry remembered Mrs. Malfoys words. “Um, your mum said supper is at 7pm and to not be late.”
Harry snorted, before waving a final goodbye and slamming the car door shut. The expensive-looking black car began rolling away as Harry headed up the footpath to his home.
“Harry, don’t you dare say that,” Sirius placed his hands over his shoulders and shrunk down to view Harry’s face. “If something has upset you, it isn’t stupid. Please, I want to know what happened.”
Silence followed those words. Draco couldn’t explain the sharp twinge in his stomach. It felt like he had been tripped, the jolt from missing a step leading his body to believe he would fall.
Harry simply nodded, unsure what else to say. She slowly dropped her hands from her face, looking now to Remus.
“Well, this is something Sirius should be talking to you about, but I feel this is something we should also discuss with one another. Your godfather and me, we were discussing the possibility of me staying over one night,” the car jerked, hopping a few beats before beginning to move again. “Now, I completely understand if that is something you don’t feel comfortable with Harry, especially if you are struggling right now. I just wanted to let you know and keep you in the loop with everything as Sirius and I progress in this relationship. If you don’t feel comfortable with me taking this step, I completely understand…”
Yet, rather than her usual sneer, Petunia Dursley looked at Harry with an expression that almost resembled grief. The expression was so jarring on her, Harry had to pause, quirking his head to the side.
He chatted quietly with Luna as they waited for Draco. Harry no idea what half the things she said were, but he found himself enjoying her company. It was different to hanging out with Ron and Hermione, and even Draco. Unlike the others, Harry never felt any pressure to share with Luna as they talked. She was simply content to discuss whatever interested her, regardless of Harry’s contribution.
“This is nothing. You should have seen my family Manor,” Sirius strode up the stairs without a second thought.
“Oh Harry,” Remus smiled softly. “That’s our job. If your parents were still alive, we would have been right there next to Lily and James, dealing with every nightmare. Don’t you dare feel guilty for things you can’t help.”
“Sirius,” His godfather drew another breath, ready to continue his tirade, but before he could, Harry spoke again. “Pads…”
“What are you on about, Potter? I just met your godfather. I’m pretty sure he would get sent back to jail if he saw me hit you. That man was giving off some serious overprotective vibes.”
“Honestly, I raised you with more patience than that,” she sighed. “Ok, then. It was lovely chatting with you Harry, but Draco is absolutely dying to talk to you, so I best be off.”
Walking down the hallway, Sirius couldn’t deny the unrelenting relief clawing its way through his chest, but there was worry building in him too. He hadn’t let himself think about a life with Harry without any threat of the Dursleys. Now, he was responsible for Lily and James’s son. Fuck, he thought. He knew, without a shadow of a doubt, he would never be enough. He could never care for Harry as well as he knew Lily and James would have.
Sitting at the worn wooden kitchen table sat Sirius Black, his godfather. His hair was pulled back in a messy bun that had strands falling out at various angles. He wore black jeans and a black shirt, his feet bare against the linoleum kitchen floor. His skin was pale. He was biting his lip as he held up a sheet of paper. The table was covered in documents and folders and books, all open at various pages.
The question sounded like something you would ask a child, but Fleur managed to avoid sounding condescending, her tone closer resembling excitement on Harry’s behalf. Harry nodded, this time managing a true smile.
“I’m actually here with my godson, Harry. He was waiting for me over there by the…” Sirius trailed off as he looked over to the couch he had left Harry on, finding no trace of the boy.
They both started to walk away together, glancing back at him from time to time. Harry knew they were talking about him in hushed whispers. It hurt to think about what they were saying.
Sirius’s room was undeniably bigger than Harry’s. The walls were painted darker, a deep maroon coating one wall, while the others were a hazy grey. Harry knew it was from Sirius trying different shades of paint when he first bought the place. His godfathers’ bed was king sized, the header made of wood that had chipped in some places. The doona cover was a simple black and white design. A door leading to an ensuite was slightly open, showing glimpses of a white bathroom.
Potter picked up the lead still attached to Snuffles and together the boys walked back into town. When they reached the beginning of the footpath, Potter asked another question.
“Another thing, Black,” Lucius paused in the doorway, gesturing for Sirius to exit the room. “Narcissa has decided she would like to have you over for dinner, so she can properly meet Mr. Potter. We were thinking Friday night, if that suits you both.”
“Huh,” Sirius laughed. “You actually won’t believe this. Lucius, the git, asked us to dinner Friday night.”
It was a quick walk to the nearest post box. Snuffles trotted alongside Harry as he stepped quickly, two envelopes in hand. The midday sun was out full force, burning the back of his neck as he walked. When he finally reached the box, his hand refused to let go of the letters. With a deep breath, he finally let go, sending the letters tumbling into the post box.
Harry thought no. He had enough of Malfoy at school, he didn’t want to spend any of his holidays with the boy. Surely, one of them would end up with a bloody nose within ten minutes of talking. It wouldn’t be the first time.
“Everybody! Return to your seats please,” The Judge held up his hands, demanding order. “You too, Mrs. Dursley. This hearing is not yet finished.”
It was a simple statement. Bare. There were no extra words to hide the implication of what was said. Harry flinched.
“This conversation isn’t about me, Harry. If you aren’t comfortable with me dating Remus than I will leave it. I understand you just learnt about us and haven’t come to terms with it yet.”
When the door open Harry saw a man sitting inside on a small armchair. Upon hearing the door open, the man jumped to his feet and smoothed his wavy black hair down with his hand. He was dressed in a button up white shirt and a pair of black skinny jeans. He swayed on the spot as he looked at Harry and Melissa, and Harry was unable to read his expression.
When Lucius Malfoy knocked on the door, Sirius all ran down the stairs, opening it after two thumps.
“Oh, of course! I’ve discovered I quite like having people to talk to at lunch,” Luna beamed at the red-haired girl.
“My, that didn’t take long. It’s been, what, a year since you left jail. Already falling back into bad habits, I see.”
Snuffles lifted his head as he heard the fumbling of his metal cage being opened. He looked at Harry and Fleur, and his tail thumped once on the concrete floor. Fleur cooed at him as she reached in to grab his collar. As she tugged gently, Snuffles got to his feet. He hung his neck low and slunk forward out of the cage. Harry stood and noticed Snuffles easily came to his waist in height. Fleur attached Snuffles to a lead and started leading the boys out of the room.
With a soft breath, Harry walked along the path to the front door, reaching into his school bag to acquire keys. The set of three jingled as he put the largest into the red door and turned. The door opened silently.
“I see,” Remus looked at them through his hair, still bent over as he patted Snuffles. “Well, if you aren’t too busy, why don’t we go and get a cup of coffee? I would love to catch up.”
“I’m not some… I’m not a nutter, you know. It’s just a few bad dreams. I don’t know why they’ve been so bad lately, but they’ll go away eventually. So why would he say… I’m not crazy!”
Sirius was a mess. His arms felt itchy, his hands cold despite the heat of the day making his forehead sweat, and his hair tickled his face as it fell from his messy bun. He listened as Harry and Remus made senseless small talk, flittering around any real topic. When the waiter came over, he mindlessly ordered from the menu, uncaring of what would arrive.
“Very well. Now before we continue, I need you to tell me everything your relatives did to you. We will not use all of it, but to represent you to the best of my abilities I need to cover all bases. I can’t do that unless I know all the facts.”
“Relax. It doesn’t come into my room. Apparently, I scare it,” he shoved the cassette player and headphones into his bedside table. “Not my fault I don’t like to be woken up at the crack of dawn on weekends.”
Silence came over the table. Sirius looked into the café, hoping that the waiter would read his mind and would come out with their order at the ready. She didn’t. Instead, he remained without distraction, sitting across from his ex-boyfriend and godson.
Harry felt a twinge of guilt building in his chest. He glanced over to Draco, who’s blonde hair was distinct, making him easy to spot. Almost immediately, Draco’s eyes met his, and the boy gave a subtle shake of his head, indicating that he could hear their conversation, and knew from Harry’s expression he was about to defend the boy.
“It simply must be wonderful for you to a free man, Sirius, and to have Harry all to yourself finally” Mrs. Malfoy led them through a massive, spacious room, fit with a crystal chandelier. If he had to bet, Harry would guess this to be a ballroom. “Heaven knows I never thought I’d see the day you were let out.”
“I know what people call me. Loony Luna,” she smiles tightened slightly, and it was the only giveaway that she wasn’t entirely immune to the horrible name. “It’s alright, though. Because I know, just because I have a therapist, it doesn’t mean I’m crazy. I’m perfectly sane, you know.”
“And Harry, how lovely to see you again,” she moved over to Harry, cupping her hands over his cheeks, raising his head up to look into his eyes.
They sat for a few moments, soaking in each other’s company, before finally climbing out of the car. The humid summer air hit Harry straight away. He could feel beads of sweat form on his forehead.
The lesson crept along. To the others it was probably torturously slow, but for Harry, he was quite content for the lesson to go on forever. The start of summer would mark a long, emotional trip and he was not in any race to face off against this battle. When the bell finally rang, the class speedily packed up. There were shouts of celebration and laughter of relief. Among it all, Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed behind. Harry glum mood was even felt by his two friends who refrained from joining in the celebrations.
Nightmares plagued Harry the whole night. He dreamt of returning to the rancid, decaying house of Number 4 private drive, his Uncle and Aunts zombie figures attacking him as he entered the door, the walls turning to a black empty void, closing in to suffocate him.
Remus walked closer to him. They stood facing each other under the archway connecting the kitchen and living room.
Sirius’s bark of laughter resonated up the street, and soon the two put their heads together, plotting against the Malfoy’s just like when they were children.
Harry thought about leaving now and getting there early, before he looked down at his clothes. He was caked in dirt and dust from walking Snuffles through the park. He thought about how Draco always looked when they met up. Like a model in a magazine, his blonde hair done perfectly, his clothes well fitted. Harry always looked like a mess in comparison. With that thought, he ran upstairs for a shower.
“Basically, this man worked through years’ worth of active homophobia and intolerance just because he really loves his son. Kind of makes you hate your own parents even more really.”
“No, actually,” Potter shook his head. His eyebrows were scrunched. “I think I would like it if you came over again.”
“Bye, Potter,” He mumbled instead. Then he looked to Sirius. “Thank you for having me over, Mr. Black.”
“Alright, Black. Tell me, if I were to take on your case, what makes you think you could win. Who in their right mind would trust you with a child?”
Sirius tilted his head at Harry’s question, finally breaking eye contact with Lupin as he looked to his godson. The look made Harry feel like he had asked a silly question.
“I understand if you don’t want to move in straight away, but I set a room up for you upstairs. Like I said, I know it’s not-”
“We all say things we don’t mean when we are upset, Harry. I suggest, you talk to him, and start with an apology. Most times, when we hurt the people that care about us, it is the best place to start.”
From the fridge he pulled out a carton of milk and eggs. He opened one of the cupboards and pulled a pan out tactfully to avoid making any noise. He had much experience from making breakfast for the Dursleys, who did not appreciate early mornings. Gathering all the equipment, he set about making scrambled eggs.
“No, this year I am off to Australia. Something unexpected, but Mother’s new husband owns a beach house on the coast. I intent to spend most my summer by the shore, see who can catch my eye.”
He took a deep breath before answering, finally making eye contact with Remus. He forgot how much he had missed those amber eyes.
“It wasn’t as bad as you thought it was,” Remus took a sip of water from one of the cups the waiter dropped off.
The court date was issued for the following Thursday. That was six days away. Just under a week. Mr. Malfoy believed he could give them a victory within one week, max. Harry tried to believe him, but exhaustion had settled deep within him. Reality seemed far away these days, and Harry was struggling to stay afloat with the emotions washing through him.
“Listen to me Harry. That is never going to happen. I love you and I love Snuffles, and I am never letting either of you go, alright. I promise you.”
Professor Lupin bent down to pat Snuffles, who was now holding his paw up for the man to shake. Harry waited for Sirius to say more. When he continued staring gaped mouth, Harry sent a sharp jab with his elbow into his godfathers’ side.
Harry nodded. Neither moved. It was another thirty minutes, two chimes, before they moved. Again, at Sirius’s instruction.
“Thank you,” He breathed. “Thank you. I don’t, um, well didn’t have any photos of them. My Aunt and Uncle don’t like to talk about them.”
It was then he knew he wouldn’t stop until Harry was legally allowed to stay with him. He would never let those monsters get away with hurting his godson, and he would die before he let them get their hands on Harry’s money.
“Would you like to know more about them?” Sirius asked. “I’ll tell ya, I have some stories about your father that’ll leave you pissing yourself. Oh, sorry, language.”
His nodded at her words, but his stunned expression gave away his disbelief. When he finally reached his last present, an engraved silver pocketknife from Sirius, Harry was at a loss for words at the pile of things he had accumulated.
“Oh, such a polite boy,” shuffling noises filled his ears as Mrs. Malfoy handed the phone to her son. Before Draco could say hello though, Harry heard the distant voice of his mother again. “He really is a keeper, Draco.”
“Harry, can you go and wait over there for me?” Sirius pointed to a couch by the corner of the room.
Harry couldn’t help the small chuckle escaping him, a dopy smile building on his face. He shook his head, trying to wipe his amusement from his face before he left the classroom.
He missed Ron and Hermione’s frowns. The noise outside the Great Hall was only amplified inside. Harry winced, pain shooting through his temple at the cacophony.
Remus studied Sirius closely, running his eyes over the other mans face, taking in his hunched shoulders and bitter expression. He gently reached a hand across the table, taking hold of calloused fingers.
He stared back at her, unsure what to say. They stood in silence for a few moments before Draco spoke.
Malfoy stood from the bed. He walked over the corner of the room where he had placed his shoes. He picked them up with his back still turned to Harry and started putting them
To the side, Draco heard the rustle of leaves. It sounded like a large creature scuffling along the forest floor and Draco let out a small ‘eep’ as he jumped violently, dropping the rope attaching him to Potter’s dog. Snuffles took that opportunity to sprint in the direction of the noise, leaving Draco behind to the dangers of the imposing forest. Draco couldn’t do more than watch as the beast galloped into the forest out of his view.
Sirius led them over to the two Malfoys. Draco immediately dropped his disinterested gaze when he spotted Harry. He shot to his feet, widened eyes looking over Harry, who was still mulling over this strange urge he had felt.
Harry glanced around the room once more, noticing the golden hew streaming through the open window. It bounced off Draco’s hair like a golden halo.
Once inside, he shut the door behind him and stepped onto the wooden floorboards. He removed his shoes, and gently placed the keys on a small wooden table. With soft footsteps, Harry made his way to the kitchen, where he could here soft muttering and the flipping of paper.
Harry wasn’t expecting this question from Hermione. Despite excelling at logic, Hermione usually lacked in emotional capacity, leaving most of the emotional talks in the group to be conducted by Ron. Trying his best to hide his shock from the question, and the fear and anxiety growing inside him, he strained a smile onto his face.
With that Harry nudged the other boy and climbed over the bed so he was seated back against the bed rest with his legs crossed. He stared intently at the screen and pretended not to notice as Draco resumed his position lying on his stomach.
Even at school when he was being belittled by Draco’s godfather Severus, Potter never looked frightened. There was always an air of defiance about him. There was a fight that shone deep in Potter’s eyes daring someone to try him. And Draco did. He had been fighting with Potter ever since the boy vetoed him over friendship with Weasley. He had rejected Draco’s handshake with a cold sneer and sharp words cementing what would become one of the greatest rivalries of Hogwarts.
Draco crossed his arms. They were standing so close, hiding in the shadows of the corridor, Harry could feel the movement, the other boys’ arms brushing against his chest. Heat rose to his face, and he subtly tried to put some space between them, hyperaware that anyone could walk past them at any moment.
Remus shuffled towards the door, Sirius closely following him. While the two bid goodnight, careful of the boy near them, Harry took his chance to slip up the stairs to his room. He tried to listen carefully but was unable to decipher the whispers shared between the two men as they bid goodnight.
He pointed at Harry, rolled his shoulders, bounced his head. Harry laughed, loud and uncontrollable. Sirius strutted towards him, still singing along. He grabbed Harry’s hands, pulling him into the living room. Sirius twirled around him, still holding the scrubbing brush to his mouth singing the words. It wasn’t long before Harry joined in, singing off key and loudly. They danced and twirled around the living room, Sirius prompting Harry’s movements.
“I heard Malfoy was lying about vacationing in France this summer, the git,” Ron said with a pleased smirk on his face.
“I mean, come on Potter. Weasley and Granger are your friends. As much as it disgusts me, you three are really close. They aren’t about to dump your ass after all the shit they endured with you, just because you got a new family."
“Someone has been positively dying to meet you, Harry,” she said, gesturing for him to follow her. “He has been all sorts of nervous.”
“Do you two have actual brains, or are your heads filled air like Thomas’s pet football?” Draco Malfoy sneered.
It was when Harry opened his mouth to a half formed thought for a sentence that he noticed his godfather had fallen behind a few steps.
“What about that one?” Draco pointed to a poster of a man holding a bunch of balloons. Harry couldn’t read the title.
They hailed the waiter, and both ordered themselves a drink. While waiting, they made mindless small talk, first about the weather, then the walk here, finishing with the people in the streets. When the waiter dropped off their drinks with a final smile, Remus turned to Sirius with a deadpanned expression.
“No, really. I need to head home,” Remus looked to Sirius. “Good luck tomorrow. Call me if you need anything.”
“I don’t know,” Sirius scratched his forehead. “I got so caught up in seeing Harry and then officially getting custody of him. I just kept thinking next week I’ll call Moony, and then that week came and I though next week for sure and… I just couldn’t make that call Remus.”
The walk to school was occupied with thoughts of how badly Harry had screwed up. By the time he set food on school grounds, he had convinced himself that by the time he got home, Sirius would have all his things packed, ready to send him away. Harry continued fixating on the notion, panic clawing at his throat, making him swallow excessively.
“Do you really thing that I would do that?” His voice was quiet. “Draco, you’re my friend. I haven’t been acting for the past few weeks.”
Draco sat directly behind Harry. He was being painfully quiet, and the only reason Harry knew he was there was because he had watched the other boy sit down. Draco was the only one in the room apart from those appearing before The Judge and the security guards standing beside the doors.
Sirius pulled him back into his chest. Then man’s arms were shaking, and Harry could feel his godfather’s breath hitching against his ear.
Harry wondered what Ron and Hermione would think if they knew he was inviting Draco Malfoy to the cinemas with him.
By Saturday, Harry had worn out and irritable. Each night he slept less and less due to nightmares about his Uncle and he had already spent his days cleaning everything in the house that could be cleaned.
There were other times, after that. Each time Ron had begged Harry to go to the police, had taken photos for evidence.
“Exactly,” Draco waved his hands about. “Just because Pansy and I hang out, doesn’t mean we are dating. Boys and girls can be friends, you know.”
“Uh,” Harry cleared his throat. “Yeah, we, I mean he, didn’t think our friends would approve. So, we are just keeping things normal at school.”
“Why would I tell you, Malfoy?” Potter sounded exhausted. “You’re just going to use it against me and tell all your friends. The whole school will be talking about what a pathetic loser I am in no time.”
Harry finally gave up on sleep during the early hours of the morning, his eyes scratchy, his body aching like he hadn’t rested at all. He made his way to the kitchen where Sirius was already sitting at the table. The sky outside was still dark, the faint glow of sunlight peaking just behind the horizon. The kitchen light illuminated the room. Under its glow, Sirius looked gaunt, his cheeks hollow, deep bags forming under his eyes. Snuffles laid by his side, his tail thumping once against the hard floor when he saw Harry enter the room.
Anyway, enough excuses. This chapter is twice the size of my usual update, and I am sorry to say it is the final chapter of this fic! But DONT PANIC! I plan on writing another part to this story, which will involve a time skip to the start of Fifth year which I am super excited to write! I just wanted to wrap up this section of the story before heading into more one-shot style stories. This way you guys wont have to wait for my updates and I wont have the added stress of leaving a story unfinished. I will also hopefully cover all loose ends in my other parts, but I apologise if I have accidentally left anything untouched. I am still so new to writing large stories like this one.
“We aren’t really sure what we are after,” Sirius answered. “But I bet Harry will know when he sees them.”
Exiting a small, weathered book store, was a tall man wearing a patchy knitted jumper. His hair was ruffled by the wind, the brown locks in disarray. In his hands were three books; each varied in size.
The first week Sirius had been understanding. Each night, once it started, his Godfather would run to Harry’s side, waking the screaming teen from his nightmare with a gentle touch and comforting words. When he finally woke, Harry was always the same. Hard faced, unwilling to talk, a mixture of embarrassment and shame washing over him.
Ginny slowly sunk into the seat beside Harry. She continued shooting the two glances, her eyebrows scrunched.
The last time Harry had gone was with Ron and Hermione back in third year. It was one of the best memories he had with his friends. It was summer and the three of them had stocked up on candies and soft drink before heading to the cinema to watch a movie about space. Hermione had been furious at them for making her sneak food into the cinemas.
“It’s against the rules,” She had hissed at them, while Harry and Ron shoved soda cans and lollies into their pockets.
“The circumstances that led to Mr. Potter leaving the care of the Dursleys was detailed in Mr. Black statement, along with a varying assortment of claims and supporting evidence,” a troubled look came over The Judge. “Mr. Dursley, is it true you assaulted the child in question the night he left your care?”
“Mr. Black,” The Judge moved his gaze to Sirius. “Was there an agreement made between yourself and the Dursleys regarding this change in Mr. Potter’s living arrangements?
“Apologise and hear him out. Apologise and hear him out. Apologise and…” the keys jingled against the wooden door as he inserted the house key.
Malfoy threw the remote away from him and the TV settled on something called The Love Hospital. The actors were dressed as doctors and nurses and their acting was dramatically
The humidity in the air was felt by all the students and teachers in the school. The summer sun was out pelting full force leaving everyone sticky with sweat and running with short tempers. All the professors had seemingly given up on teaching, content to simply play whatever video they deemed fit well enough into the class’s curriculum.
“Why not? They deserve to be charged after the shit they put Harry through. Vernon should be in jail!”
The whispered words grounded Harry though. And that was when Harry noticed he was clutching the other boy’s hand. His hand was holding Malfoys. Malfoys hand was holding his. Harry was holding hands with Draco fucking Malfoy. And he wasn’t letting go.
It was Tuesday and the rain outside came down in thick drops. The sky was a hazy grey that showed no hints of clearing. With Sirius help, Harry had hauled the television up to his room. That was where he and Malfoy spent the day, perched on Harry’s bed mindlessly flicking for anything that might catch their attention. However, day time television was a not a formidable opponent for boredom, leaving them with nothing but mindless cooking shows, and soap operas to choose from.
“It just, it feels like I might be,” the words were whispered, like he was struggling to admit it to himself.
“This is new,” He said, pointing to the pin board stuck to the wall covered in photos. The photo Draco pointed to was of him and Harry standing in the backyard in soaking wet clothes, covered in soap after trying to give Snuffles a bath. They were smiling at the camera, Draco trying to act annoyed, his arms crossed, and eyes rolled, but a sure smirk painted his face.
“Just start at the beginning. Tell me when it started, what they would do, anything,” Mr. Malfoy said in what was the most comforting way he possibly could. It still came out stiff.
“I have provided the relevant documents providing information regarding Mr. Black’s mental health assessment. He has been cleared by no less than two therapists,” Mr. Malfoy glanced back at Sirius. “I will argue, he should no longer be punished for a crime he has been acquitted of, Your Honour.”
“You wouldn’t be replacing James, Pads. Just keeping Harry a bit safer. But, if you don’t want to do it, there are other ways we can try.”
For the life of him, Harry had no idea what that meant. Still, he pondered over her question. For some reason, talking to Luna seemed easier than with other people. He never felt judged by her in the few conversations they had, and she seemed to have no interest in gossiping. Nodding to himself, he decided to confide in the weird, friendly girl.
“Yes, thank you, Mr. Malfoy,” The Judge nodded, and Mr. Malfoy returned to his seat beside Harry, unbuttoning his blazer. “Is this true, Mrs. Dursley?”
They were sitting under the shade of a white and red swirled umbrella eating their ice-cream when Harry remembered their earlier interaction with Professor Lupin.
They spent the rest of the afternoon watching crappy kid shows, Harry unashamedly enjoying them, Draco pretending the entire experience was beneath him. Harry knew otherwise though, watching through the corner of his eyes as Draco smiled or gasped whenever something intriguing happened on screen.
Harry knew the second Draco spotted him. His eyes widened and he smiled a small, smug smile that Harry knew he should have despised but instead made his heart skip a beat. Harry tripped. He managed to keep himself from falling completely, but his faltered step was made obvious by the smack his shoes made as he stomped on the pavement. He looked up to check if Draco had noticed. The other boy was laughing, his hand covering his mouth. Harry felt his cheeks heat up as he rushed the last few steps to the cinema.
Harry was sweeping the wooden living room floors in jagged, frantic movements when Sirius came flouncing into the room.
“Very well. We will see you both again tomorrow,” Lucius picked up his brief case and cane. “Draco, say your goodbyes. We’re off.”
It was while these swam through his head, a man approached the table, completely unaware of the inner dilemma playing through the Sirius’s head. It was the sound of the metal chair scraping against the cement ground that drew Sirius from his thoughts, causing him jump. He knocked the table, sending packets of sugar flying everywhere. He quickly scrambled, shoving them back into their allotted spot, hopping he didn’t look like a total loon. A familiar deep chuckle sounded in front of Sirius, and he willed himself to keep from blushing.
Draco rolled his eyes and nodded. Luna handed him back the popcorn, before flouncing off in the direction of the loo.
“It’s simply lovely. I’ve already seen it five times this summer,” she smiled again, the same soft eyes staring at Harry. She held up five fingers for Harry to see.
“And I am pleased to announce, this year’s Gryffindor Prefects are Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasley.”
As he walked up the stairs, Harry thought, if he were to let himself, he would start crying deep ugly tears. But he had never let himself cry because of the Dursleys. Not when he was six and he had spent two days straight in his cupboard. Not when he was eleven, and they had tried to keep him from attending Hogwarts. Harry wouldn’t let himself start crying now because of them.
The words trailed off to a whisper as Harry pondered the horrible things he shouted at his godfather last night. He ran his hands up his arms, digging his nails into his skin, and scratching down in a long, deep drag.
It had been thirty minutes since Sirius had left him, and his bladder was making itself known as full. Harry shifted around in his seat but when it became apparent he would be unable to hold it any longer, he stood. He walked over the receptionist with soft footsteps, hyperaware of the soft clicks his movements made against the marble floor.
Even though Sirius was taller than him, Harry was only slightly skinnier than his godfather. Besides, Harry was sure they would fit better than anything the Dursleys gave him.
An old lady with a fur coat had strutted in, walking up to the receptionist with a rather demanding presence. She started yelling at the poor lady behind the desk the moment she reached it. Harry couldn’t make out the words, but he watched the woman behind the desk floundering for the phone. After her, a man with a large round belly and a handlebar moustache bounced in, his booming footsteps enough to shake the floor. He stopped to talk to a man heading out, his jovial laugh echoing throughout the first floor.
Sirius sight was caught on a small shop across the road. The small parlor was open, and Harry could see inside the shop to its vast array of ice-creams. Sirius’s smile didn’t reach his eyes and when he looked at Harry, he jerked his head in the direction of the shop.
“And Mr. Potter is it true you have been living with your godfather, Mr. Black, for the past four months?”
A pang sparked in Harry’s chest at Sirius’s nickname. He couldn’t tell if it was from sadness, happiness, or a mix of both. He quickly thanked Sirius and left the kitchen, shouting a goodbye to the two men.
“Yeah, I’m pretty sure Ron and Hermione are going to say the same thing. The thing is, I don’t want to go back to us hating each other. I just,” Harry took a deep breath. “I don’t want to tell them just yet. I doubt they are going to understand, especially since the last time they saw you, Ron got detention.”
So, as 10:30 rolled around, Harry was a tight ball of stress and Sirius was no better. The only thing keeping them from both snapping was Snuffles pawing at them for attention. They waited in silence, sitting across from each other at the kitchen table.
“Look, I know you don’t want to talk about it,” Sirius’s words were low, soothing. Harry resented how calm he was trying to appear. “But I need you to promise me you will at least think about what I said.”
“I keep screwing things up with the people I’m meant to care about the most. I never believed you when you said you were innocent. I never noticed anything about Harry’s relatives. I mean, I just thought he liked the Weasleys better. And now I wouldn’t be surprised if you don’t want me in your lives. Either of you,” he finished with a shuttering breath.
Harry was intrigued by the dog’s attitude and walked slowly towards the cage, kneeling to get a better look at the scraggly dog.
So, thank you guys so much for all the support you have offered for my FIRST EVER attempt at writing fanfiction. I fucking loved writing this story and I will definitely be writing more in future. Until then, I hope you enjoy this chapter.
“Wow, Potter, excellent observation,” Draco huffed. “I don’t care. I’d rather not stay here with you.”
“He’s been driving Narcissa up the wall since school ended. I was hoping you wouldn’t mind him coming here with me a few days this week. We think it would be good for him to be around people his own age. Also, it will give Narcissa a break.”
He waited until they were both out of view before slipping into the crowd. He heard buses start to pull out, the heavy engines booming in his ears. Sweat started beading on his forehead as he walked out of the crowd and away from the school.
“Mrs. Figg has also written that she witnessed you throw Mr. Potter from the house that night. There are also details relating to countless other moments where she has seen you physically and verbally assault your nephew,” The judge stared down at the Dursleys. “Is there anything you have to say about that?”
She led them out the back through a small door behind the reception desk. As they walked through the corridor, Fleur chatted about the dogs available for adoption.
“Oh, wow. No,” Draco shook his head. “I mean, they hang around me because of our families, and like, it’s always good to have them for backup in certain situations, but no. They aren’t exactly the best at holding a conversation.”
“Well, being stupid is a skill of yours,” Draco smirked as Harry swatted his arm. “Glad you sorted it out though. What was the fight about anyway?”
“What?” Sirius looked puzzled before a frantic expression overtook him. “No, no, it went perfectly! I have full custody of Harry, and Vernon, the asshat, well he got charged with contempt of court. Harry never has to go back to those people, Remus! Everything worked out so amazingly perfect, you have no idea how thrilled we are.”
“I kind of told him to fuck off. Said he wasn’t there to like…stop it when shit was bad. That’s it’s not his problem, just because he feels bad about it all now. I really didn’t hold back…”
“Well, you are crazy smart,” Harry smiled at her. “Thank you for that. I really needed to hear what you said.”
“Very well. As I was saying, we have matters to discuss, that being, an application for legal custody of Mr. Potter.”
They sat in silence for a few moments. Draco pretended to be watching the television, but Harry knew he wasn’t really interested with what was playing on the screen anymore.
The man hummed in response, surveying the hall in which they stood, like a snake ready to strike its prey.
Harry looked around frantically, and then, without warning, took off sprinting, leaving Malfoy with Snuffles on the side of the road.
Lucius gave him the Malfoy Look, that Sirius was sure sent other running. But Sirius had been impervious to his mothers Look by the time he was nine, and Malfoy’s was child play in comparison. After a few moments, Lucius caved, rolling his eyes.
“Alright,” Harry murmured. “I won’t tell them right away. But I am not keeping this a secret from them forever. There’s also a condition you have to agree to.”
All it lacked was a television. Harry noticed sitting on the small coffee table was a red and gold wrapped box.
“One of my cousins’ husband. He’s one of the best lawyers around. Hopefully I can convince him to take our case.”
“Put down that broom, my dearest godson!” Harry stilled immediately, propping the broom up against the wall.
He flung himself back down on the couch, crossing his arms over his chest. He stared down Harry with a petulant look on his face.
With that, he practically skipped to the front door. Begrudgingly, Harry ran a quick hand through his hair and followed him.
The Judge remained silent while he searched through more papers. Harry thought, if the next question was directed to him, he might start crying.
Draco looked up and down at Sirius, an unamused expression adorning his face. Harry felt his chest start to burn with anger. He clenched his jaw and ground his teeth together. He was so caught up in his anger at his high school arch nemesis, he didn’t hear the groups conversation until his name was being spoken.
“Because, I tell you what, I have had a fantastic day. Snuffles and I, well we went for a walk this morning, then after we came home, I thought I’d give baking a go,” Sirius continued prattling on, bursting around the room as he spoke, moving books from the book shelf and ruffling the throw pillows.
He scouted the space he was in, counting out the doors he passed until he reached the end of the hallway. He remember Mrs. Malfoys words, and finally pinned down the room he was sure was Draco’s. Harry’s stomach with butterflies he couldn’t explain. He stalled outside the door he identified as Draco’s, swaying back and forth as he racked up the courage to knock on the door.
Remus shook his head. He took a sip from his mug to hide his amused smirk. As he sipped, he mulled over the information he had just received, thinking about all the fights he had broken up between Harry and Malfoy.
Harry was about to ask the man a question when he heard Sirius shouting his name from up the street. From the side, Harry was now able to see Sirius in the crowd. His godfather was frantically searching for him, shoving people out of the way as he looked. Harry lifted his arm up, waving slowly for his godfather to see. He could tell the moment Sirius noticed him, relief spreading across the man’s face as he threw his back and ran through the crowd to his godson.
His heart clenched at the words. He couldn’t keep the small gasp slipping from his mouth. Sure enough, on the first page, the book began detailing the history of the Potter family, listing names Harry had never had the privilege of knowing.
“Harry, Draco,” A voice called from the hall, causing the two boys to jump apart. “What are you still doing here?”
“Tell me, how did Weasley take the news? You did tell him we’ve been hanging out this summer, right?”
“I know why he is representing you,” Malfoy finally shot back. “Your godfather is handing over the family mansion as payment. It becomes ours even if you lose. In fact, I doubt my father is even trying to win your case. Why would he bother?”
So, not able to find an excuse to say no, Harry found himself in a dinged-up maroon Volkswagen with two doors and one broken, taped up window. No students loitered on the schoolgrounds, all the buses gone by the time Harry and Remus left the castle and no parents were left to pick up children. All that was left were a few cars in the teachers parking lot, each varying in levels of expense.
Together, Sirius and Harry walked shoulder to shoulder up the large stairs, each step causing the anxiety to build in Harry. His stomach was twisted in knots, and he felt lightheaded. Entering the building eased the heat beating down on Harry, but it did nothing to quell the nausea building in his stomach. He was just about ready to fight his way to the closest bathroom and throw up when Harry caught sight of familiar blonde hair.
Harry had first met Sirius in July when he was 14, just having finished his third year at Hogwarts. Sirius was fresh out of prison and Harry was living with the Dursleys. It was at the end of their first meeting Sirius had asked Harry if he wanted to come live with him.
His words cut off as his throat closed up. Sirius licked his lips and looked away from the man falling apart in front of him.
Sirius wanted to protest. He wanted to take the lead from his godson and walk Snuffles himself, but Harry had already turned away, leaving him alone with Moony.
“I’m looking, Potter,” Malfoy snapped back. “Free television is horrendous. I am trying to find something not completely intolerable.”
Harry reached over to the coffee table, plucking an apple from the fruit display in front of him. He ran it over in his hands, surprised by the rubbery texture and hollow sounds it made. Plastic, he decided.
When Harry and Sirius exited the car, each bid goodbye to the two Malfoy’s. Harry desperately tried to make eye contact with Draco, but his sight was stuck on whatever was outside the window. It was when Harry got to the front door, he realised Draco didn’t even say goodbye.
As soon as he said it, Harry expected a fight. He expected harsh words, screaming, maybe even fists. What he wasn’t expecting, was for Draco to do nothing.
With that, Lucius shut the pale folder in his hands, paced over to Sirius, and handed him the papers. Then, he opened the door and began to stalk out. Sirius scrubbed his face. The idea of adoption hung like a stone in his chest. He didn’t think he could ever forgive himself for replacing James in Harry’s life in such a permanent way. He wasn’t sure James would either.
He spluttered, too shocked at his Godson’s reaction to protest when Harry stood from the couch, ignored Snuffles offended look, and headed straight to the home phone in the corridor. Sirius listened as Harry started dialling and went to inspect what was going on.
“If they have done such a good job, then why did Harry show up on my doorstep covered in bruises. That boy is fucking terrified of that family and the very idea of going to live with them again has sent him into multiple panic attacks. If you really think they could do a better job than me, then I got a full fucking file of photos that proves otherwise.”
Sirius looked to be racking his brains for an excuse out, but before he could think of anything, Harry responded.
“We are not about to go back to the way things were! The fighting and bitching, I’m sick of it. Why are you trying to fight me right now?”
They both stopped talking to let the other go. Harry could feel his cheeks heat up, and he hoped his blush wasn’t obvious to the other boy. When neither of them started talking
Soft breaths were the only noise breaking the silence of the room. Sirius’s eyes searched Harry’s form, his hunched shoulders, creased eyebrows, crossed arms. The sight of his godson’s discomfort made him want to cry.
“Well, bloody hell Hermione. If your behind, then the rest of us are surely fucked. Ain’t that right, Harry?”
Malfoy tweaked his head to the side, still smirking that irritating smirk. How Harry wanted to punch it off his face.
Fleur’s gaze fell on Harry and she gave him a kind smile. He shot back what was meant to be a smile but better resembled a grimace.
When the boys finally returned to Harry’s house, Sirius and Mr. Malfoy were still stuck into paperwork. The clock in the living room read it was 10 past 5 and the afternoon sun soaked the house, the orange light seeping through the living room window. Snuffles collapsed on the living room floor immediately, his tongue lolling out the side of his mouth as he panted. Harry and Draco walked quietly into the kitchen while the two men sitting at the kitchen table continued their discussion.
“I don’t know if you noticed, Potter, but she isn’t exactly normal. No one at Hogwarts is friends with her because she’s weird. That’s why everyone calls her Loony Lovegood.”
“It’s a photo album, from when I was in school with your parents. I found it in storage and thought maybe you might like it.”
“Alright, Potter?” Draco said it in a way that made it seem like he didn’t care, but Harry could tell otherwise, from the way the blondes eyes looked him up and down.
“Ok,” Draco opened the lobby door, letting Luna and Harry walk out before him. “We will walk you to the car.”
“So weird!” Ron exclaimed. “I mean, I can see the resemblance, but for Malfoy to actually admit it. I thought hell had frozen over!”
“No, not at all,” Fleur responded. “That lovely boy is Snuffles. He is beautiful boy but has been here a very long time. One day, he stopped getting up when we brought people in. He lost hope of adoption. It has been very sad.”
“Oh yes. I do enjoy having classes with Ginny. This year in potions she yelled at the boys for teasing me,” Luna frowned. “I wasn’t too bothered by them, but it was certainly nice of her to stand up to them for me. No one has ever done that before.”
Harry awoke to the morning sunlight streaming in through his open window. It was the kind of light that hinted at either an early morning or a rainy day, cloudy and unsure. Harry stretched in the bed, feeling the soft sheets brush against his skin.
“Mate, I flooded the second-floor bathroom in our Second Year after setting off firecrackers as a distraction. Why would you think that?”
Please don't hate me! I wrote this instead of my Sociology final. It's my final week of Uni is and shit is getting hectic lol.
“Mother and Father have made plans for us to travel to France again this Summer. I do love visiting our summer home there,” he said, sticking his chest out as his group gave varying degrees of responses. “What about you Blaise, Berlin again this year?”
“So, where are you off to this holiday, Potter? The Bahama’s, Egypt?” Malfoy mocked; his voice laced with sarcasm.
The floor felt like it had dropped beneath Harry. His cheeks flared with heat and his chest tightened.
“Oh, nothing’s wrong, Harry, promise,” Sirius took a deep breath. “I just wanted to tell you how my chat with Remus went.”
I got your letters. Hermione’s as well. Sounds like you are both having a wonderful time, which I am glad to hear.
She looked ethereal. The cream gown she wore was made of silk. It flowed to the ground, bundling around her heal clad feet. Her blonde hair was curled, falling past her shoulders, framing her sharp cheekbones. There was a grace about the way she held herself. Straight backed, chin high. Yet, three was a glint in her eyes warning one to be cautious.
Professor Lupin laughed softly, holding his hand over his lips. Sirius groaned, smacking his forehead.
“Look, I will tell you about it later,” Harry reached up and placed his hand over Draco’s. “We can talk after the meeting. I’m not about to combust, alright?”
“Right, well. I suppose we better get going Harry,” Sirius’s eyes hadn’t left Professor Lupin, and neither looked ready to say goodbye. “This dog isn’t going to pick itself.”
“Hey Sirius,” Harry’s ice-cream was dripping down its cone towards his hand. “How do you know Professor Lupin?”
“Are you sure you don’t want to tag along, mate?” Ron asked for the hundredth time, his eyes full of sympathy and something to close to pity for Harry’s comfort.
He reached over to his nightstand, brushing his fingers against the round edges of his glasses. Harry picked them up and shoved them onto his face, welcoming his sight.
The three of them sat out the front of a quiet corner café, Sirius and Remus across from each other with Harry between them. Snuffles had flopped to the floor, his tongue lolling outside of his grinning mouth as he sniffed the air around him. The morning had turned overcast, the sky a dull grey that refused to clear or rain. The square table they sat at was wooden, and the cutlery was already set out for them.
A startled laugh escaped Harry and he soon had a lapful of dog as Snuffles buried his nose into Harry’s neck and started sniffing. Harry’s laughter got louder and soon Sirius was joining him with loud joyous barks of his own. His neck felt completely wet as the large dog ran his nose over Harry’s face.
“Today we are doing something special. Today, I have planned one of the greatest surprises and you will ever receive in your life, Harry!”
The look on Harry’s face, this exasperated, fond look, was one that sent a pang to Sirius’s chest. It was the same look James had adorned many times.
“Look, Moony, I understand if you don’t feel the same anymore. I mean, I don’t expect us to fall back together immeadiatly, if at all, but I needed you to know. You don’t have to say anything, I can just go and-”
Yellow light engulfed the room. Somebody let out a yelp which was followed by a gasp. Harry watched as limbs began flailing from behind the couch. A stray shirt was plucked from the floor and thrown through the air. A whispered ‘Fuck!’ was heard. Sirius’s head whipped up from the couch, causing Harry to jump. The mans ruffled hair stood atop his hair in a teased mess, and his cheeks were flushed red.
“Got to love Madonna,” Sirius chuckled. “I used to bust a move to that woman when I was your age, I tell you.”
He looked over to Sirius, who looked as teary eyed as Harry felt. His expression was soft, open, and Harry felt a new wave of tears threaten to fall.
“I don’t believe it. He’s probably just waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Give it a week, he will be back to his usual shit, I bet.”
“Alright, then. Do you want to watch some telly? This bloke isn’t far of winning and I want to see if he gets the money.”
“Harry,” Sirius tone was different to his usual cheery attitude. He leant against the kitchen sink, looking at Harry.
“Remus was invited as well, and he said he could come, but if you don’t want him there, I can call and cancel-”
“I got it real cheap,” Sirius gestured around the room. “I mean, I think I did. The agent said it was a good deal.”
Harry twirled his head around, unable to keep his eyes on any one spot. Their footsteps echoed around the circular walls. Harry noticed he was falling behind and jogged to catch up with the adults before he got completely lost.
Smiling to himself, Harry walked over to the welcoming sight of Luna Lovegood, glad to have found someone to eat with. When he approached her, Harry noticed she was reading a magazine upside down, her sandwich sitting untouched beside her.
I had an awful time trying to figure out how to use italics, so if the formatting is wrong I apologise.
“Uh, yeah. I moved back a couple of years ago,” Professor Lupin answered, rubbing the back of his neck. “I got a job teaching at Hogwarts, actually. It’s how I recognised Harry.”
“Harry,” Sirius smiled at his godson, a sad look in his eyes. “Don’t worry about that. Take your time. Besides, if you end up on the phone with Cissy your going to be a while. Trust me.”
Sirius mulled over Lucius’s words, thinking about the interactions he had with Draco. Then he realised what the other man was implying. He barked out a laugh.
The room was a mix of clean and messy. The floors had clearly been swept, but dog toys were littered through the living room. Smoke was clearing from the kitchen, and the windows had been opened, letting in a cool, end of summer breeze. The furniture was placed in its usual spots, but upon the kitchen table a batch of burnt cookies were resting. It looked like Sirius had rushed from one job to the next without even finishing the first task.
“You didn’t break my nose, Potter. It was just bleeding,” Draco said defensively, tilting his chin up.
Hauling a deep breath, Harry entered the classroom, making a beeline for the backseats with Ron and Hermione. Science remained the sole class Hermione didn’t sit in the front.
“I promise,” Harry said standing straight. He held onto Snuffles lead. “I can even bring him back for visits if you like.”
Petunia was sitting up straight now. Vernon looked like he was in the middle of a heart attack. His face was a mess of red and purple blotches. He sneered at The Judge.
When things had first come out with meeting Sirius, Harry had refrained from telling his friends. There was a barrier in his mind that cut of his words whenever he thought of telling them. Ron and Hermione had faced everything with him. They were the closest people to him and the only people that knew how the Dursleys affected him. He knew he should have told them he was safe with Sirius, had been for the past months, but something stopped him every time. Something inside him thought telling them everything would cause it all to disappear, a jinx, that would break the spell and send him packing back to the Dursleys.
“My problem is,” Draco crossed his arms, his expression growing dangerous and foul. “That’s my cousin your calling insane. If you have a problem with Luna, you got a problem with me, Finnigan. Call her insane again, and I will end you. Got it?”
“You have not yet finished this school year, and until that bell rings and I have dismissed you, I will not here of any plans or conversation regarding the Summer holidays. You are here to learn. Is that understood?”
“That’s not what I meant, Sirius,” his expression was stern, like he was talking to one of his students. “You have Harry now. That means everything comes down to him, and what he is comfortable with. He is the priority right now. Not us or our feelings.”
The night he first met Luna came back to him, and he remembered what Draco had said others called his cousin. Loony Lovegood. He had essentially just called her that to her face. Luna gave him a kind smile, but it did nothing to lessen Harry’s guilt.
After a lengthy sorting ceremony, Dumbledore stood once more to announce the Fifth Year Prefects. By this point in time both Harry and Ron were blissfully tuned out, staring out the window of the hall. That was, until Dumbledore announced the Prefect for Gryffindor.
Sirius rolled his eyes at Lucius choice of words. It had never been a secret Malfoy looked down on Sirius for his attraction to men. When they were kids, nobody ever talked about it. Narcissa refused to openly acknowledge any of the various sign’s her cousin was gay, though Sirius’s attraction to other men was always there when they were young. Lingering eyes struck on other boys. Posters of shirtless men kept in his room. The first ‘girlfriend’ that remained nameless. Still, it had taken a blatant screaming match with his mother, and Sirius yelling the words “I’M FUCKING GAY” at a family dinner before anyone openly acknowledge it.
“Um, never. Ron is just always around to back me up. Plus, you drag him into it by harassing him until he cracks!”
Anyway, I promise there is more wolfstar and some actual drarry to come, its just been hard setting everything up! I promise I will get to it asap!
The heat from the pavement was starting to seep into Draco’s shoes and the beast had been leading him for so long, his legs were starting to tire. They continued along a footpath that ventured away from all manmade buildings and led them into a small forest. The trees were spaced out far enough that Draco could still see around him easily enough, but there was no hint of mankind in the area. Draco could hear the calls of birds flying above and the chirp of crickets around him, but he could not hear the chatter of people, nor the familiar rush of the city.
A hand lightly touched his shoulder causing him to jump. When he looked up, his eyes were still blurry from the excessive pressure he had applied to them.
“While it is true you are now the legal guardian of Mr. Potter, that does not mean Mr. Potter is completely free of the Dursleys. If we aren’t careful, he may end up back in their care.”
Harry thought over what Sirius said. His heart ached for the man in front of him who had to endure so much heartbreak in his life.
The two didn’t speak to each other until they were two streets over. Harry thought things were going quite well, until Malfoy opened his mouth.
Throughout that time Harry had thrown himself into the housework. He had managed to clear most of the backyard by mowing and weeding the extravagant mess. He helped Sirius find furniture for the living room, which they collected from a small op shop not far from their house. They found a nice red couch and comfortable brown armchair that Harry placed near the small fireplace. Sirius had even bought a small television, which they watched together most nights after dinner, flicking through crappy reality shows and overdone soap operas. By the end of the week, Harry had even fixed the hole in the kitchen floor while Sirius was out one day.
Harry watched the whole thing happen from the top of the staircase, which was soon becoming a regular spot for his spying. His heart was pounding, and he wanted to run to his room and barricade the door. He didn’t.
Harry and Sirius passed down the street shoulder to shoulder. Sirius held onto Snuffles leash, who trotted along the pavement with his head high in the air. They walked through into the city, crossing down a small street lined with quaint shops. The midday sun kept most people indoors, leaving just Harry and Sirius to walk along the sidewalk. They had not spoken to each other. They merely walked with sombre expression and slow steps.
Draco opened his mouth, and then shut it. He felt a chill rush over him despite the heat of the day.
“What’s it about, Harry? You need to talk to me here,” Sirius through his hands up, frustration leaking through his words.
When he was released, Harry took in his surroundings. The room was set up like it were a normal living room. Couches and chairs, a table, and toys lining shelves along the walls.
“Have a good holiday, guys. Take lots of photos for me, yeah,” Harry tried to sound as sincere as possible.
“Look, I appreciate you letting Luna tag along with us,” Harry mumbled, keeping a look out in case said girl appeared. “I know what its like not to have any friends and, like… I don’t know, I think this means a lot to her. Next time we can hang out by ourselves. Promise.”
It was a few weeks after his birthday, that Harry was reunited with Ron and Hermione. He was even surprised to find neither of them were overly angry at him for withholding the truth of his summer from them. That wasn’t to say they weren’t hurt.
“The wish of Lily and James Potter for you to have custody over Mr. Potter before you became an ex-convict will hardly hold up in a court of law, Mr. Black,” he raised his chin, looking down his nose at Sirius.
At the kitchen table, Mr. Malfoy rubbed his temples with long slender fingers. His eyes were closed.
“I see. What was it you were talking about just now? It seemed rather serious,” Remus paused. “Don’t tell your godfather I just said that. I never want to hear the Sirius/serious joke ever again.”
“You have made it quite clear throughout the statement your desire is for guardianship to be granted to Mr. Black. Is that still the case?”
Harry nodded. He became aware of how little he was talking and berated himself. Surely Melissa and Sirius must have wondered if something was wrong with him. But as he tried to come up with something to say, he ran blank.
Yet, it didn’t take long for Draco to place his hands in Harry’s, his soft skin touch steady as it brushed against calloused fingers. They held onto each other for longer than both knew socially acceptable, staring at the other with a confusing mix of defiance and trust.
The lobby walls were lined with movie posters. A man and a woman kissed on one poster, and Harry averted his eyes quickly. Another was a classic action movie, a still shot with explosions and cops on the cover. He saw Draco roll his eyes at it, and he knew they wouldn’t be seeing that movie. Harry kept looking.
Harry looked up to see Draco’s silver eyes studying his face. There was no malicious intent in the question.
Still looking unsure, she nodded. The door swung open, and Ron stormed up to them, muttering violently under his breath. They walked to the buses side by side, listening to Ron rant about Snape and his obvious bias.
Sirius stormed up the hallway, refusing to let anyone stop him. A lady called for him to stop but he shook his head and kept travelling. Although he had told Harry about the meeting, Sirius had omitted telling his godson it was not a booked thing. He hadn’t wanted to worry his already anxious godson. Sirius had noticed the deepening bags under his eyes and the vacant stares aimed at nothing.
Harry was struggling to make his next move. He looked over the cages and his heart swelled at the idea of leaving all the animals here. He was shaking his head, eyes wide and searching over the kennels, when he heard a small arwhooph that garnered his attention.
He never believed Harry when he said that, but as far as Ron knew, it really wasn’t that bad. He and Hermione had only ever seen what Harry wanted them to. A split lip here, a black eye there. They didn’t know that was only the surface of it.
“Harry,” Sirius groaned, before crossing the living room to wrap his godson in a tight, warm hug. “You are not crazy, and I would never say that you were. Do you understand me?”
Harry told him all about school, his best friends Hermione and Ron and all the adventure they had. He told Sirius about the time he and Ron had skipped school to visit Hermione when she had been sick in hospital when they were 12. Harry talked about everything, except the Dursleys.
“Boys,” Lucius didn’t even raise his voice. The two stopped talking immediately. “If we want to get any work done today, you need to make yourself scarce. I cannot concentrate with you jabbering at each other all day.”
A girl with the same shade of blonde as Draco’s smiled vacantly at him. Harry noticed she was pointing to a poster full of different fantasy creatures like centaurs, elves and massive spiders standing in a forest. The title read The Forbidden Forest.
Harry kept his eyes on the corn flakes drowning in his bowl. His godfather sighed, exhaustion creeping through.
The stared at each other with fierce, hard faces. Harry could feel the thump of his heart pounding from the adrenaline of being grabbed. He stared petulantly at the other boy. However, it didn’t take long for Draco’s determined eyes and set jaw to win against Harry’s resolve.
He handed out a $50 note to his son. Harry stared wide eyed at the money, but Draco didn’t hesitate to step forward and claim the money. He pocketed the note and quickly strode back through the living room to the front door.
The words were reassuring. Harry subconsciously angled his body towards Draco, brushing their shoulders together. The sweet, homely smell of the blonde hit Harry, and he found himself taking deep, slow breathes, savouring the alluring scent. If Draco noticed Harry’s odd behaviour, he didn’t mention it. Rather, he happily let the oblivious boy brush against him without any comment, trying to hide the sly smirk fighting its way onto his face.
Harry didn’t know how long he was stuck to the footpath. He could feel footsteps walk around and over him. He was unable to move. His legs felt stiff and immovable and his arms were jello. The longer he stayed down, the surer he was that he was going to die, either from the stampede of people who were soon to get sick of stepping over him, or from suffocating.
Each time Sirius patiently explained that no, this wasn’t a joke, yes, he was sure, and yes, they could really get a dog. He even said Harry would be the one to pick it.
Beneath them, Snuffles jumped up, shaking the table, causing cutlery to clatter. He let out a sharp bark in Harry’s direction.
“Honestly? Yes,” He said. “Ever since First Year, all they’ve done is try and kill each other. They’re as bad as you and Snape were.”
That summer had been the best of Harry’s life. For the first time ever, Harry had felt safe. Sirius was the perfect guardian. They ate meals together, watched tv, took Snuffles for walks, and generally Harry felt as though he could talk to his Godfather about everything. On top of that, Draco and he were able to hang out nearly every day, spending their time hanging out at the Manor playing football, or eating ice-cream at the parlour near Harry’s home. Despite his complaining, Harry knew Draco secretly loved leaving the manor to spend the day together.
“Trust me, Harry. It’ll be fine. Just hurry up and tell them before they find out some other way. It’ll be worse if you aren’t the one to tell them.”
Hi! Thank you everyone who has left kudos and comments. I haven't been able to reply to everyone but I want to thank you for all the support you have given my story, I love reading your thoughts!
Harry let out a small laugh and grabbed the box gingerly. He sat down on the couch as he started removing the gold ribbons. Sirius sat with him, far enough away so as not to crowd Harry, but close enough to see the contents of the box when Harry opened the lid.
Hermione nodded her head, her eyes looking at him with pity. She opened her mouth to say something, but Harry cut her off.
“So, it is bad! You would have told them if it wasn’t,” Malfoy looked delighted. “How far off prison are you? Oh, how many years are you going away for?”
After a few moments, Harry finally began his walk down the pristine hallway, pretending the creaks protruding from the house were his cause and his cause only. Never mind the one’s that were definitely coming from the empty bathroom he passed.
“It’s nice to meet you. I’m Melissa. How are you doing today, sweetheart?” She held out her hand to his.
The thoughts that swam through Harry’s head that morning were still there, but he didn’t fixate as he walked up the steps to his front door. He took deep breaths, recounting the mantra he had been saying since chatting with Luna.
“I don’t,” Sirius coughed. “But hopefully we can work something out. This particular cousin is a little more reasonable than the others.”
“Well, he shouldn’t,” Hermione sniffed. “It was bad enough he showed up late to the meeting. He barely apologised, acting like he was doing us a favour by just being there. If I were Dumbledore, I would have given him detention.”
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the shocked, open mouthed expression Parkinson pulled at those words.
“Congratulations, mate,” Harry bumped his shoulder against Ron’s when he sat down. He leaned over the boy. “You too, ‘Mione. Knew you would get it.”
“Mr. Potter,” she called to Harry before he was about to slip from the room. “I understand it is the first day back in session, but please try to focus in my next class. I will not be as lenient as I was today.”
“Oh Harry,” Sirius breathed, his eyes rushing over harry, taking all of him in. “You look just like your father. Except your eyes. You have your mothers’ eyes.”
“Honestly,” Lucius sighed. He reached into his pants pocket and pulled out a black leather wallet. “There was an ice cream shop a few blocks over. Don’t come back for a few hours.”
When Draco walked over to them, he carried two large boxes of popcorn. He still had a sour look on his face.
The two began to bicker, falling into a comfortable pattern they had established throughout the summer break. Time passed quickly, and soon they were called for supper, late by a whole five minutes, much to the dismay of Mrs. Malfoy, who reprimanded her son for such rude behaviour. He merely smirked at Harry before offering his mother an insincere apology.
Harry twisted. With hurried steps, he walked towards the living room. The back of the couch faced him, and the television was too dim for him to see around the room. Feeling along the walls, Harry flicked the light switch on.
Everyone, including Malfoy’s group of Slytherins were staring at the blonde with mouths aghast and eyes wide. Parkinson looked like she was one word away from an aneurism, looking at Draco like he had slaughtered her first born. Seamus stood in shock beside Harry, spluttering for a response.
Harry stood as still as possible. His eyes were wide, and his mouth had fallen open. He was struggling to decide if he should sneak past them and head back to his seat, or to slink back into the bathroom, when he heard the elevator doors ding. From the opening doors emerged Sirius and what looked to be an adult Draco Malfoy. Harry figured it was Draco’s father.
They joined the crowd of students flocking through the opening corridor. Harry noticed Dean and Seamus walking ahead of them but made no move to greet them. Hermione and Ron walked beside him, talking through Harry to argue with one another. He kept an eye out for distinct blonde hair, tyring hard not to make it obvious who he was looking for.
“Fuck,” Harry breathed, before trying to explain what he meant. “First, I was moving in with you, then it was the Hearing against the Dursleys. A month ago, I hated Draco Malfoy, now I’m upset with him for not saying goodbye to me yesterday! And now, you want to start dating my teacher, and I’m trying to be ok with everything that’s happening, but fuck, it’s a lot to take in, Sirius.”
Harry scrambled to retrieve the remaining presents, ignoring the laughter of the adults as he followed Draco inside.
So, yeah, Snuffles is a little homage to Sirius Animagus's form, because how could I not put that in, so I hope you like that.
Hecould only laugh at his friends’ antics. Only Hermione would want to revise for the upcoming school year. He placed the letter on top of Ron’s and moved onto the next.
Harry held up the letters inspecting them. Four in total. Three looked to be sealed, but there was one that had been open. He scanned the writing on the first letter, and saw his name written in what he knew was Ron’s handwriting.
Malfoy stepped into the hallway, his cane thumping against the floor with each step. He looked around the home, sniffing the air.
When they finally left the house at 9:08, they walked side by side to the bus stop. Sirius was dressed much like he had been when Harry had first met him, button up shirt and jeans. He had his hair pulled back into a bun as he usually did, and his face was clean shaven.
Throughout the days Harry was doing the housework, Sirius was meeting with Mr. Malfoy about the upcoming custody hearing. A letter had arrived on the Tuesday, and although Harry hadn’t been allowed to read it, Sirius had told him a court date was set three weeks from now. On the days Sirius met with Mr. Malfoy, he came home with slumped shoulders and takeaway containers, intent to ignore Harry’s insistence that he would cook. During that week, Sirius’s eyes were permanently rimmed red from exhaustion and his hair remained frizzy and ungroomed.
Lucius’s driver waited for them outside the court house, leaning on the slick black car Harry and Sirius had arrived in. They all piled into the car, Lucius taking the front seat, Harry wedged between Sirius and Draco. Light conversation was made, which Harry wouldn’t have minded, except for the fact that Draco never once spoke to him. In fact, the other boy didn’t even look at Harry. He simply stared out the window with a stoic expression, hands clasped tightly in his lap.
Malfoy Manor was the biggest property Harry had ever seen. The driver crept along the road at a slow, steady pace, showing off the property in its entirety. The driveway leading up to the Manor was long and winding, showing of the display of freshly mown green lawns and well nurtured garden beds. Harry was sure he even spotted a peacock rustling around in the bushes, before it escaped his sight.
“There isn’t all that much to do at my house, and because it’s the school holidays there hasn’t been much to keep busy with. I already finished off our library collection and you can only practice so much Football without any opponents.”
Despite the words, neither boy made any indication of moving. They stayed in their corner, Draco still holding onto Harry as the smaller boy wrapped his arms around himself.
“Of course,” Harry said. “It’s your life, Sirius. I don’t want to stop you from seeing him, I just don’t want everything to happen so quickly.”
Their first class of the day was torture. Double history with Professor Binns and the Ravenclaws. Ron and Hermione were flooded with congratulations still, each still riding on the excitement of their new roles. Even Hermione was struggling to pay attention, shifting in her seat and smiling to herself.
In English, Professor Flitwick had played some sort of Shakespeare play which despite its promise of a modern setting and actors, was still just as difficult to follow. Within ten minutes Harry had given up all semblance of understanding and tuned out. Hermione, of course, followed the dialogue perfectly. Harry and Ron both knew unlike the other girls who were simply watching for the eye candy main actor, Hermione knew what was going on. She gasped when the two love interests met and patted her damp eyes when someone was shot. Harry and Ron, as well as most the boys in the class, murmured quietly between themselves, being shushed by the girls whenever they got too loud.
“I’ve been having trouble,” Harry mumbled, turning away from Remus. “Not Sirius. I’m the one keeping him up.”
The hallway was nearly deserted when he stepped out. The cheers of students echoed through the walls from the field outside. Harry tried to keep himself distracted by counting the cracks in the stone floor as he walked, his steps slow and deliberate to buy himself time before reaching the lunch grounds. He had reached a count of 36 when he was startled from his thoughts by a warm hand wrapping itself around his mouth, another gripping his arm, pulling him into an abandoned classroom.
The next morning came, and Harry was a mess of anxious energy. Today was different to the other mornings he had waited around for Mr. Malfoy, because this time, it wasn’t the court case he was worried about. It was Malfoy. The thought that yesterday was a fluke was rushing through Harry’s mind. Just because he and Malfoy had gotten on once didn’t mean it would become a regular thing. Right?
“I have that meeting today,” Sirius said, used to Harry’s non answers. “I’m heading into London around nine if you want to come with.”
Sirius walked over and stood in front of Harry. With gently hands, Sirius began tying Harry’s tie. Once he had achieved the perfect knot, he brushed his hands along Harry’s shoulder, letting them rest there as he looked as his godson with sombre eyes.
The second the words left his mouth, Harry knew he had made a mistake. A flash of hurt crossed over Malfoy, before his face became blank.
The question was answered with silence. Harry knew what Draco was getting at. There was a reason he hadn’t told Ron about them in his letter, and with a glance at Harry’s face, Draco knew Harry hadn’t told him for the very reason he was implying.
