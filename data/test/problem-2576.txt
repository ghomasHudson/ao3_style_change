. They can't. Therefore, you wasted your time, breath, and dignity seeking assistance that will never come."
Cringing, he spoke up. "Not really. My father wouldn't let me go into St. Mungo's if I had what you did. He wouldn't let me check to see how expensive the surgery is."
"Had anything happened before I arrived?" he asked, turning to his friends for answers. It was then that Draco saw Pansy's teary face and Theo's torn one. Blaise appeared indifferent, but Draco knew that he was anything but that. "What did they do? I swear—"
"Nothing."
His mother schooled her facial expression when they reached the Manor's doors, waving a hand and stepping inside without a click of her soles. Draco stared at where she stepped, that uneasy feeling beginning to pool in the bottom of his gut. He took a deep breath and stepped onto the tile silently as well nonetheless. Years of slipping out of uncomfortable birthday celebrations granted him such a skill.
"Albus, you can't just—" Severus fumed.
Draco didn't quite get it— he still thought that Harry pissed at him.
"Where were you?" Luna asked loftily.
Harry nodded. "I'm not going to apologize for that. You insulted Ron."
, she thought to herself.
"Oh." His face reddened considerably.
"Look, Malfoy, about Saturday—"
"I'm here to see if you're alright," Harry repeated. He flexed his fingers. "I really didn't mean to do that, you know? I didn't even know what the— the spell did. Or what it was supposed to do. Or—"
"Not Ron's or Harry's obviously," Pansy humored.
But, Draco sincerely hoped the bloke suffered when Harry tested their perfectly executed Amorentia potion and had an unhealthy (temporary) obsession with Draco. He also hoped Harry and the mystery bloke never get together because of it. This was terrible, terrible thinking, but Draco somehow felt righteous for feeling in such a way. Besides, if anyone had been doing Legilimency and confronted him, Draco could simply say that his flowers have begun messing with his head.
"Because Draco is definitely not going to like this," Ron explained. He sent an empathetic glance towards the blond, who was more interested in the stacks of books that they've brought instead of the conversation. He opened the book, scanning the contents for only two seconds before slamming it shut.
“Well. He’s a gorgeous one, isn’t he?” the man asked with a wink.
So, after he lost patience with the team on Monday, Draco ditched practice to seek them out and apologize for even bringing up the prospect of giving up.
"Yes. What about Mr. Malfoy?"
Draco tossed his head back and laughed. "Of course it did, you berk!"
Draco nodded in agreement. He then, before Harry or Ron or anyone as brash as them decided to break down the entrance, successfully granted them access with the knowledge his father had bestowed to him as a child. They made it through the floors without much resistance as it was well beyond working hours, and slipped into each and every room before settling inside the Time Chamber.
Blaise smirked. "No, I'm not. What, you've got the hots for me again? Sorry, Draco, but that boat has long since set sail for one Ms. Pansy Parkinson. It's never docking at Mr. Draco Malfoy ever again."
"I guess it must've been pretty bad if even you noticed."
Draco froze.
Harry's cheeks flushed. "I just didn't expect her to say that."
"Great, so he probably doesn't even think about me," Harry wails.
Harry's breath hitched. "Malfoy, I have to go. The book might help you. It can fix this."
"Malfoy, wait—"
"What? At the Room of Requirements?" Potter asked.
"Thank you, Dark Lord. Good day."
Friends. That's what Pansy, Blaise, Theo— Vince and Greg had been busy slacking off for the past few months so they obviously weren't in on this— and Idiot Duo Plus... Hermione were. It happened out of nowhere, emerged due to stalker-ish tendencies. And not a single one of them were bothered by it. They seem to have banded against common sense and common decency all for the sake of bothering Draco and—
Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes, hiding a smile behind his hand.
They weren't pissed that he kept it from them (well, Pansy was) and they weren't angry that he tried to deal with it on his own (this time, Blaise was). Nor did they take great interest in his then-erased Dark Mark (well, Theo did this one).
His voice full of raw wonder and hope, and thick emotion that made it sound like this was his most precious secret.
"I have Care for Magical Creatures," Potter said.
"Yes, and I'm very sorry," Harry agreed swiftly. "Now, could you help me vanish everything? I'll start on breakfast for us this time around."
“Gods, you’re perfect.”
"It's rather annoying deal with stalkers." Her right hand rested on her hip. Potter, Weasley, and Granger looked livid. "We always prefer to 'talk, not stalk' so sit down at the very least."
"Mother said he was the most honorable and loyal man she ever had the pleasure of meeting, and she told me how Sirius would never be capable of doing what everyone had accused him of doing."
"But— father—"
He really fucking hated the world.
At that, she leant back, satisfied.
"A few weeks ago when my core was too weak to be stable on its own," Draco deadpanned.
"Oh. Only her?" Potter asked, reminding Draco that he wasn't alone and probably should have remembered that before reminiscing. "Out of all your friends?"
"Things will be okay if you just blame it on Harry," Ron advised.
"No," Harry scoffed, "no, he won't. If there’s something we have in common, it's out stubbornness."
Draco's voice echoed. Harry winced slightly. "Yeah. There's just a lot of blood."
"Harry Potter," Draco stated clearly. "Son of the late James and Lily Potter. I relinquish all claims of the Le Havre estate to him."
"Like you're about to die. Like you have no one else. Like you've given up," Harry said quietly. He dabbed his quill in the inkwell casually but his face gave him all away: Harry was trying to word his next words in a way that would not offend of hurt Draco. It was... unexpectedly appreciated. "Like you don't matter," Harry continued, his voice making the words sound final.
"Cho?" Harry sounded just as surprised and suspicious as Draco was. Harry glanced towards a group of girls who were nearby, nearly all of them giggling and sending not-so-sly looks towards them. Draco narrowed his eyes at them, wondering what the hell Chang, Edgecombe, Abbott, and Turpin were trying to do with Harry. He prepared himself for the worst: homophobic comments. Or... Harry-phobic comments? Draco doesn't think he's ever been attracted to someone other than Harry now that he thought about it. Sure, there were the occasional blokes whom Draco thought was attractive, but his emotions towards them weren't quite as enhanced as they were for Harry. So, Draco supposed, the correct terminology was 'Harry-phobic' then. "What's going on?"
"Remind Granger that she needs to meet me on Saturday night." Potter stared at him for a brief moment, looking away and pretending like he was pissed he'd caught himself bothering Draco. Draco unintentionally ignored it and spared Potter the embarrassment. He added stiffly, "Good day."
Worrying his bottom lips between his teeth, Draco considered his options. The floor, certainly, was not an option and, as much as he hated the thought of sleeping next to another person who had the potential to kill him in his sleep, Draco felt much safer here than exploring the ship and hoping everyone would leave him alone. With a sigh, he gave in and wiggled under the fur next to Harry.
"He threatened me," Harry corrected.
"Nobody should've been able to," Blaise agreed. Then he paused, pushing himself off the wall and sitting down on the end of the bed. "Unless... Lucius still has some ownership over the safehouse. In that case, he'd have access to all the wards and magical influences. He'd have been told of all of our arrivals, which would explain how he followed you and Draco."
Blaise glanced towards him, noticed the nervous fidgeting, and agreed. "Alright. Let's go up to your room."
Draco almost always shouts,
(See the end of the chapter for
Even now he hated to think of those days. It must have something to do with how Draco hadn't known Slytherins were being bullied for their involvement in the first war. Well, not theirs, but their parents and the reputation that they accumulated from many alumnis becoming Death Eaters after graduating. Draco didn't really hear of it until he himself was mocked for being rejected by Harry, and it wasn't as bad as what some people used to do to his friends. The bullying-Slytherins-in-general stopped whenever Draco had Harry insulting or siccing Weasley on him, or whenever Draco made himself a literal walking target.
"Oh, for Merlin's sake!" Draco snapped. he snatched one of them— Wind, if he guessed correctly— and threw it towards them. George caught it easily. "They're affinity-boosting, silver-charged, shield-charmed, light-weighted military cuffs!"
"So you're really close to Pansy? In both height and friendship-wise?"
"How come Hyacinthe doesn't have scenes with other people?" Harry grumbled. He reluctantly took the sandwich one of the house-elves held out for him and took a bite. As they began to move towards Draco's dorm— he'd driven Harry in this direction purposefully so he would be spared a few moments to feed Potter and avoid another temper tantrum— Harry continued talking. "It doesn't make sense that I have to do more work than you."
Harry has no idea why the
"Well, we've never met face-to-face. I can't just call him by his first name. It'll be weird."
Draco stopped pouring their completed potion into vials and stared at him silently. The potion wasn't going to work on him. Draco already loved Harry; Amorentia doesn't work if the drinker was already in love with the potioneer. Well, maybe it'd be a weird turn of events since Draco was the one who technically brewed and stirred it.
"I'm sorry, you want to
"What are you doing?" he hushed. "If Sirius isn't here, then it's obviously a trap. Stop walking into it!"
"Hey! What was all that disappointment for?" Blaise hissed behind them. Draco turned back, a playful smirk painting his lips when he found him sitting next to Longbottom. He instinctively knew he needed to look back when Blaise embarrasses himself so he could place the memory into a pensieve and demand that Pansy exposed their best friend on his wedding night. "I'm no filthy commoner! I am a bloody King, and you know it."
Several counties away, Draco's pretty worried because he knows that his parents will freak out, but Harry's quick to soothe him. Draco tries to explain that Narcissa has no mouth filter whatsoever and that Lucius has always been one for fancy, yet oddly-fitting presents, but Harry refuses to listen. "Everything will be fine, love," he tries to reassure.
"Pretty sure half of us already think you and Harry are dating," Fred easily said. "Cho started talking about you two holding hands last few meetings."
Wait.
He clamped his mouth shut as soon as he realized he was insulting Potter, looking away and praying Potter wouldn't actually take offense to his words. People in power on the other side answered his prayers.
"And you're a git who needs to feed his starving friend," he reminded.
"I'm not saying I'm not surprised but..." Draco waited for the long-awaited 'you could do better than that' or for the very-much-expected 'I bloody knew it!' Instead, Pansy sighed. "I suppose I should've figured out why you were so butthurt about Harry refusing to be your friend. The schemes you pulled were too put together and too focused for your own good. Yes, your crimes for chocolate are heavy, but your crimes against 'Saint Potter' are definitely a close second."
"Potter, I mean. What did you learn about him?"
He hated having his insecurities. If he could simply vanish them away, he would. But he can't.
"Although you are on relatively better terms than you have been these past few years—" Draco snorted at this— "both of you act as though you are romantically involved."
"Don't!" Aunt Petunia warned.
Harry frowned. "None of those are true."
“But… you fought for your pureblood line or something… right?” Harry asked out-loud, wondering if what he assumed was wrong for all these years.
Draco narrowed his eyes again. "I'm not fat."
Harry gently squeezed back. "Going to teach me a bit more about Astronomy I see."
"Malfoy."
"Mhmm. Right," drawled Draco. He twirled his wand around, drying his towel immediately. Then he folded it, placing it on top of his dirty, yet neatly folded, clothes. "And you were the only one who came?"
Her hopeful expression dropped. "I'll be right back, Mr. Malfoy. No getting out of the bed until I say so."
He immediately set that box aside, figuring that his papa would do it for him anyway since the old man liked cleaning things for no reason whatsoever.
Wait.
Harry cleared his throat. "Can we stop talking like I'm not here?"
"Bloody hell, Draco. Couldn't let me gain a single piece of blackmail, huh?" she asked nobody (at least, that was present) in particular.
"How long do you reckon it'll take?" Ron asked.
Draco played with his fingers. "I don't need you, per say..."
"'My Weasley'— you mean
"I see," Draco said simply. He left his quill in the inkwell. "I’m afraid I don’t know any family member with that name. Perhaps you have the last name incorrect, Potter."
Draco only laughed. "No, he's right. Mother helped me collect the feathers. It was just a shame we couldn't clean the blood out of them."
Then, setting the letter beside him gently and turning to Blaise, Draco smirked.
"He's still a git. That hasn't changed," Pansy snickered. "But... he'll definitely be less hostile towards you now. He may even apologize soon. And once he realizes that you all want to help him instead of being threatened or forced to... he'll come around. He always did."
Harry learned then that if he sought any reprieve from his punishments, his following punishment would be much more impossible to live through.
Draco just looked away and kept smiling.
Draco straightened his back, his head tilting to the side. "With? He isn't failing Potions horribly enough for Professor Snape to need me to tutor him. He still hasn’t recovered from that lecture we’d just had— Umbridge is far too harsh for her reputation’s good— and I can’t exactly provide any insights for him as we are on opposite Quidditch teams. Shall I continue with the list?"
However, Draco did know why the script was so difficult for him to go through.
"I rather like muggle music," Draco called.
Harry didn't think he ever staggered away from Draco as quickly as he did once Draco's body became limp once again.
"I definitely won't forget this," he muttered fondly. Then he rolled his sleeves up. "Alright. Let's do this."
Harry nodded, his grip around Draco tightening. "Okay. To the Hospital Wing."
"What is that supposed to mean?"
Draco's name coming from Harry's lips at that very moment didn't sound any different than it did on a regular basis. His emerald eyes weren't glazed over. He wasn't waxing poetry.
"The Death Chamber."
Just do whatever you want or need to do and don't worry about anything or anyone else! I promise that you'll feel just a tiny bit better (and that's what's really important). And, hey, if it doesn't, you'll always have the Harry Potter series to come back to UwU
Draco pouted. "Look, I would have told you myself, but I was in a holding cell at the Ministry so..."
It's a weird situation in which both boys don't know how to act but are loving every second of it anyways. They're both blushing and grinning and scrambling to get the conversation going, but they were both too excited about what's growing between them and too afraid of screwing anything up.
"No, I didn't really get a chance to grab it earlier. After dinner, I was talking with Ron and Hermione and and I lost track of time when Ginny came over and the whole 'let's plan to hurt Draco Malfoy in front of Harry Potter to say a big fuck you to his whole speech about leaving the past in the past'."
He was surprised at how quickly Dumbledore had returned. He thought it would have been much longer than 16 hours for the Wizengamot to let him. After all, they were all too quick to establish Umbridge as the headmistress in the beginning of the school year.
As cheesey as it sounded, 'Harry' became synonymous with 'love' at some point in his life. After they made their relationship official, Draco couldn't stop himself from saying 'love' in place of Harry's name. It just felt so easy to do so.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked.
"Actually, I didn't know that," Harry admitted. "Wait. But, didn't you call Hermione a... er, a..."
"Yeah, no shit," Theo huffed. "We thought something happened to you."
Not that Draco would have responded if they said anything.
"The Dark Lord killed her due to a prophecy."
He did not fancy having an icicle beard. He did not fancy having a beard in general.
"We wouldn't be," Pansy muttered. "If we see you in a comatose state again, Draco, I don't think we would be able to take it anymore. You mean too much for us to gamble with."
Contemplating whether or not to tell Blaise about his inability to actually sleep, Draco shrugged. Blaise folded his arm in a condescending way. Pissed, Draco cut him off with a simple, "Good night, Blaise."
"Well yes," Granger replied easily. "This table has the best lighting and it's close to the window."
Harry doesn't deserve to be loved any less.
help him with the Malfoy situation.
"Well, my mother doesn't really know. Father had asked me to keep it a secret when I turned six and he started training me. He said that I would surprise her one day."
Speaking of Draco... he was named after the dragon one, wasn't he? He was probably dying to talk about it— he'll probably wave his hands around and try to tell Harry about it, staying oblivious to how Harry already knows all about it. He would just let Harry stare at him silently, and he would just let Harry love him silently.
"Afternoon Harry. Weasley. Granger," Draco said anyway. For all he knew, Harry could have had a run-in with one of his many stalkers-slash-fans before lunch. It was the most plausible reason that he could think of, seeing that Potter was in the kitchens for the meal and not in the Great Hall.
The unfamiliar voice groaned. "Alright, whatever you're cheery about, it'll need to wait. Who's with you, pup?"
"No."
"Of beyond the highest. I trust that the goblins will exceed my expectations as well."
“Sorry, I was just thinking. I didn’t mean to worry you.”
Harry laughed wetly, his tears soaking through Draco’s shirt. “I love you. Thank you, Draco.”
"I wasn't going to lecture you," Potter said carefully.
Draco handed the small box to Harry, whose beautiful eyes widened when he saw it. Then, pressing a kiss to Harry's forehead, he retired to bed and sobbed until sunrise.
"Professor Hayes, if I may be honest, I do have an idea. I'm simply not sure if you'd like it. It's a real life account and I only know the bare minimum you see."
"Why do you sound as though you need to use the bathroom?" Hermione inquired.
And Harry wanted to know him in a way he never even bothered to know him before. To know the Draco Malfoy that genuinely smiled and laughed, to know his interests and his passions. He wanted to pass by him in the hallways and not be greeted with a sneer. He wanted to sit by him in the library and hear him throw witty remarks about random passages of the text— Harry had never gotten to hear any of them since he was always too far away.
"I— how do you know that?" Choosing to not take the bait, Draco cleared his throat and managed a straight face. "Even though I have a free period, Blaise still asked to see me after Potions."
"Shacklebolt was really the only one interested in learning what had exactly happened. So when it became clear to him that Regulus was somewhat dormant during the war after Hyacinthe's death, they talked," Blaise continued casually. "I talked to Professor Hayes, she made some changes, and now we have a scene where Shacklebolt talks with the guy."
"'Git,'" Draco snickered, even though he really shouldn't be relieved to read the one-worded note. He glanced at Blaise, who was now glaring into the back of Potter's head. "I never leave anything at the library, you absolute idiot. What were you expecting?"
Draco swallowed thickly, still thinking about the wizard he basically rendered a Squib.
"I— I wanted to see if you were alright," Harry confessed, taking a small step forward and hesitating to take another when he saw Malfoy back away again.
"Harry?" Draco called out.
"Are you sure?" Harry's eyes darkened impossibly. "Because if you don't give Draco the chance to possibly save you, you're practically giving both of those things away."
Draco's head shot up. Of all the things he'd expected from his godfather, an admission of a loss was not one. In fact, he thought Severus had never lost anyone before. In Draco's opinion, he was too incredible (Potioneering-wise) to ever lose anyone. But then again, Draco had thought Harry was too incredible to be treated like a house-elf in the fifteenth century so...
Draco snorted. "You wish. You forget that I know more than you do, and with Hermione on my side, there will an endless number of jinxes we can cast."
Draco shook his head. "He did it to protect me! He did it to make sure that I don't feel anything when I'm bloody kidnapped, tortured for information, and held for ransom! My father knew what he was doing; he knew that it was illegal, but he put himself on the line anyway! It was a necessary sacrifice—"
"I’m here, Draco," Harry whispered.
"The only trouble you're going to get in is with me, and it'll happen if you don't get up from that bed," Draco deadpanned.
"He hates you, you know."
Harry stared at him for several moments. "I haven't seen you smile like that in a while."
"Oh, it was. I'm simply curious."
He didn't even have a set example for him, except for the ones that Pansy reluctantly gave him.
"Did you know Harry's in love with me?" Draco blurted out, eyes widening and cheeks heating when he realized what he'd done.
Thinking back to how easily Potter switched from expressing his favorite color to a mental issue, Draco had an inkling Potter was as messed up in the head as Draco. Well, not as much as him, but almost.
Unless one was sickly in love with Harry Potter, who will be not only the Savior of the Wizarding World but the enemy of all of wizard-kind if they ever got together. It was still a painful type of good feeling, Draco figured.
Draco's normally pure white sheets were a raging red and tainted by not-so-innocent flowers. Draco himself was a worrying pale, and sweat was dripping ever so slowly down Draco's forehead.
But Merlin, it was like Draco was addicted to this type of scandal.
"He asked Dumbledore for information concerning the Malfoy Manor after you came back to Hogwarts looking both 'pale and exhausted'. He went along with your devious schemes and I assume there have been instances where people think you are already romantically involved, correct?"
"Yes, but..." her voice trailed off. "To be honest, I don't trust him."
"See? Then you can't possibly lose any House points since our potion is perfect," Draco replied. "And wouldn't you like to win those ten points back? I'm sure Severus— Professor Snape would gift some to Gryffindor once he sees the perfect effects of our Amorentia potion play out."
"What do you mean 'like this?' Furious that you didn't tell me the moment this started happening?" Draco fumed.
"No."
It was a bit too clear now.
Like a madman, he forced Draco to let go of him and picked it up. Almost immediately, there was a gust of wind. Draco ran towards one of the many great shelves and hid behind it, forgetting to call for the others in his haste. Blaise, however, had been brilliant enough to follow him.
Goldstein and Boot's suggestion to do away with purebloods raised high tension in the classroom. Purebloods and halfbloods shot snide remarks about how Goldstein and Boot should cease to exist instead, and wizards and witches who shared Goldstein and Boot's perspective snapped how they'd been right. Those witches cowered and looked away guiltily when Potter glared at them.
Pansy thought silently. She'd unknowingly compared his appearance, rigidness, and non-routine reaction to Narcissa Malfoy's from two weeks before.
Draco shook his head. "She did, but they were usually forced."
Draco smiled, albeit more melancholy now. "Of course."
But because his boyfriend was off doing something he knew his boyfriend wasn't exactly sure of doing, Blaise would have to blend in with the background and inch out of the room without Harry or Draco noticing.
Harry rolled his eyes and held his arms out for Scorpius. Draco complied, pressing his index finger to his lips as he silently told Scorpius to keep their secret. It was so cute, Harry decided he'd let the subject go.
Silence hung between them.
Blaise removed his arm from Draco's neck. "And know that you're not about to lose us so cool it with... what did you call them— oh right: 'the Idiot Duo Plus Granger'."
"Ron!" Harry gasped. Draco simply smirked, pleased with the turn of events.
Draco cursed, his shoulders tensing even more when he and Harry decided to part from the rest of the group and slide into another, much more dark room. Harry pushed him against the wall, pressing his pointer finger against his own lips. Draco nodded, but still gripped his wand tightly.
First, there was the matter of reputation. But Draco wasn't going to get into that. Nor was he going to point out the obvious: he bullied Granger, Weasley, and Potter for the past several years of their lives.
"I hope your holidays have been well. We have a lot of work to do."
"Oh shut it, Malfoy," Potter huffed, laughing still.
"Wait. You thought he liked me?" Montague snickered.
"So there are sights that you've planned on visiting, Hermione?" Draco asked. Nodding shyly, Hermione smiled before bringing out a large book. "Merlin."
"Wait, that's not right, is it?" Potter asked ineloquently.
At the heart of the village was a long hall. The outside was plain, but inside it was decorated with shields and all manner of weapons. A long fire pit went through its center and the table was set around it. It served as a meeting hall and a communal dining hall— it was always filled with activity and it offered a place to talk or cook with others. Draco didn’t come often as he barely knew anyone and he preferred to try his hand at cooking alone but, today, Pansy wants to teach him how to make lamb stew, Harry’s favorite.
Smiling sadly, Draco hurt for Hyacinthe's sake.
Draco hummed. "Sure... I should've known you'd harbored feelings for Montague. He bakes the best chocolate cake after all. No worries though, Harry. I assure you, we are nothing more than ex-Quidditch teammates."
But how on Earth had he not guessed it? His uncle Regulus and Hyacinthe Potter's more-than-friends relationship?
He knew that he would be killed without hesitation if he did not do the task the Dark Lord asked of him, which was a problem in and of itself. And he knew that the aftershocks of the phantom feeling of the Mark was a given.
Draco's chest no longer felt heavy as he watched Harry smile. He no longer felt emotionless and detached. There wasn't some nagging feeling telling him Harry still held a grudge. Draco felt he was allowed to hold hands with Harry without the fear that Harry was doing it out of pity and stupidity. He was allowed to pull Harry in for a kiss whenever he wanted to.
He sat in his room where Harry used to sit. He wandered into the Room of Requirement and stared longingly at the dark affinity cuffs. He slept at the top of the Astronomy Towers without a jacket. He cried in front of the Gryffindor fireplace. And Draco went to their secret spot in the library and flipped the pages of Harry's family album over and over again whilst looking at the engraved 'Lily and James' of the table.
"Why?" he asked petulantly.
Harry took in a sharp breath. "And you?"
"Harry, you said that last time. I think you already know I'm not going to listen to you," Draco chuckled. He closed the books he's spread out, settling into one of the chairs himself.
"So he's like this all the time?" Ron asked.
Remembering how Harry had kneeled down in the library and scrubbed the floor, Draco pursed his lips and put a reassuring hand on Harry's shoulder. "Don't try to do things on your own, Harry. These house-elves are incredibly powerful, and you will need them by your side. Besides, Dobby is only one elf. You can't rely on him all the time."
He'd always been rather invested in his family's history, and he'd spent years staring at the great tapestry hung in the room beside his, memorizing how each of his family members looked and imagining how those scorned off would have looked. Draco spent countless hours begging his mother to tell him stories about their family members, even more hours than that staying awake at night and wondering if they'd be proud of him if they were still alive.
"Er..." Harry wondered if he'd ever be capable of not talking like some awkward idiot. "Look, if it's about the exams and the grades and everything like that, don't worry. I already talked to our professor about it. You're in the clear."
His village meant safety from Harry and the other Vikings, but it also guaranteed that he’d end up back in Lucius’s clutches and likely in another marriage that, at best, will be loveless and, at worst…
Blaise looked at him. "Of course what?"
He hated that when he found out that Draco took Voldemort's Dark Mark and received an assignment Blaise knew was still weighing on him, Blaise had not been louder in objecting.
"Draco Malfoy's estate in Le Havre, France," Draco stated clearly. The goblin sat up, respect glimmering in his eyes. Draco smiled with satisfaction. Draco's family had always shown respect towards the goblins— speaking on their terms and offering a hefty payment with almost every visit. The goblins, in turn, have shown respect to his family and always put immense care for their dealings. "I offer a thousand galleons for strengthening of ward protection by goblins and transfer of ownership."
"You what?!"
Hermione hysterically laughed, her giggles lifting the whole mood of the table. Even Harry, who Draco thought was going to be sympathetic towards him, snickered. "God, I can't— your password— for
"Amount is acceptable for the deeds. Proof of identity?"
"Expertise? In what?" Draco and Blaise asked at the same time.
Ron's cheeks flushed. "It's Charlie's."
Narcissa bowed her head.
Over the course of the next several weeks, Draco and Potter met sporadically to rehearse their lines. By the time their monthly check-in with the Muggle Theater professor came around, they were done memorizing their lines and cues. Professor Hayes had been exceptionally pleased, urging them to continue with their collaboration and completely forgetting to remind them to tell her one fact about the other person.
Life for them would not be how it was for Draco.
As the other students began to arrive for their first class of the day, Draco made sure to keep his head ducked down, not wanting to draw attention to himself. Not that it did much good. He could feel the questioning stares the Golden Trio was giving him, and the longer it went on, Draco found himself sinking more and more into a hole of shame and regret.
, Draco was more inclined towards blokes than girls.
Draco sighed and complied, waiting for the lecturing to begin as Blaise casted healing spell after healing spell over his face.
Draco turned towards Harry, his smile faltering as he remembered how he'd truly mistaken who it was that Harry loved on Valentine's Day. It truly had hurt him, and it encouraged his tendency to self-loathe. For some reason, Draco knew that if he hadn't been so caught up in feeling sorry for himself, he would've figured it out. Regardless, it had taken him a bit too much time to realize the truth.
Perhaps Draco just had to find the answer on his own.
to return. The Dark Lord branded him, and if he finds out that Harry's taken Draco to whoever-the-hell the Dursleys are, the Dark Lord will track him down. Harry wouldn't be safe if Draco comes with, but he won't give up until Draco comes with either.
But Draco showed Harry this. How different he could be. How
"But nothing. We have to do something," Blaise said, jolting out of his daze as soon as Harry began speaking. "You should tell Draco."
“Lucius— he sent out some men to find his son and bring him back. Not just his regular muscle, but mercenaries. Some of them found him in some village a few days ago. Tried to bring him back, but he didn’t want to come. He killed one of them, injured another, and they didn’t take too kindly to it. They had to rough him up a bit to do it.”
He hoped he wasn't disrespecting his uncle's... enamorment with Hyacinthe by wondering if he should talk to Professor Hayes about this not-really-surprising-anymore revelation. He hoped it wasn't disrespectful to offer a play about them. Then again, Potter had spoken about uncle Regulus first. And his perspective was that uncle Regulus was a silent war hero. Surely, this perspective wouldn’t change if it turned out that Regulus Black had fallen for another wizard.
"Good day," Draco said stiffly. Then, not even glancing towards Pansy and Theo to view their reactions, he turned on his heel and followed Blaise's magical trace.
However much Potter had, Draco still had multiple times as much over him. However much money Potter had been given for winning the war, it was not going to make up an eighth of the money Draco inherited.
As for better… well, his father once stormed off to bed when Scorpius, Larissa, and Hugo wanted to watch the movie his papa wanted to watch and not his choice. His father, on the other hand, always laughed when the opposite was true and played with Scorpius' hair during the movie.
Harry lifted his head, glancing in her direction and scrunching up his nose in disgust when he saw the nasty display of yesterday's lunch and dinner. Cass was clutching his sides, looking just as sick as Harry felt on the inside. "My apologies. I couldn't hold it in again."
Potter watched him carefully. "Malfoy, is that what you think I'm doing here? Trying to save you or something?"
"Go on, Draco. I bet you're simply dying to show off," he encouraged. Then, he added as an afterthought, "You git."
back.
(thanks to their one-spell-only Golden Boy). They quickly moved to free Longbottom and searched for the rest of their friends.
Draco rolled his eyes. "In case you didn't realize, it was a compliment, Potter."
"You-Know-Who..." Blaise began. "It's a trap. He's coming. He's coming for Harry."
"Well, if you don't finish it soon, the treacle tart's going to harden."
"Yes."
Pansy sighed dreamily. "The only game Draco can both lose and win at."
Hesitating for the briefest of moments, Harry shook his head.
Theo nodded. "Well, runes aren't
He’d tell Malfoy that the Hat nearly put him there when they talk later.
The blond faltered in his steps. "What do you want, Potter?"
ing plates and utensils. Harry showed up two minutes later, completely dressed in his favorite pajama pants.
kid with Draco's affections. And to think: all you have to do is tell him."
Harry didn't know what the hell Draco was talking about, but there were an infinite number of ways he could've responded to him.
He gasped. "Don't tell me you introduced Scorp to soap operas!"
"The DA?" Harry squeaked. "Why the DA?"
Harry proceeded to show him pictures of his family, which filled the entire book surprisingly, and Draco made little comments here and there about each picture. When curfew hit, Harry sneaked Draco to the Slytherin dungeons before quickly dashing towards the Gryffindor towers. Draco leaned sideways against one of the pillars, smiling softly to himself.
Draco smirked, that familiar tingle in the air letting him know Harry hated the 'unfairness of it all'.
It was clear to him that the bloke he had spoken to from the beginning of term had changed. It was so subtle, Draco didn't notice it all too much. But now that Harry had actually put it into words and was displaying some sort of confidence Draco was unused to seeing on him, Draco noticed it. And it was unfairly attractive.
"But it doesn't mean he didn't put a different kind of poison in it!"
Draco was slightly uncomfortable with the question.
Draco huffed, promptly muttering a hasty goodbye and storming out of the classroom. Of course he remembered what Severus had stated about the potion. Even before Severus had pulled him aside to tell him that, he knew this piece of information. He didn't wreck havoc through Severus's belongings when he was nine years for absolutely no reason.
He turned away from the bookshelf and sat down at his desk. He stared down at Pansy's letter. He picked up his quill and began writing.
Draco's jaw dropped. "What?"
"Whatever,
He groaned as he pushed himself up on his elbows, squinting his eyes at the bed table to find his glasses. Swiping them, Harry decided that he'd clean himself up first before searching for Draco. Surely, Draco was responsible and mature enough to not get into any trouble on his first day of staying in the Grimmauld Place. Just to be sure, however, Harry hurriedly cleaned his bed and brushed his teeth. Then he rushed out the room, only to be greeted by the most horrific sight he'd seen since May 2nd.
Draco quickly silenced that part of his mind.
It was a predicament Draco definitely should not be in with Potter.
"A lightning tornado?"
"Not true. I've lied loads of times! I don't get caught."
That made sense. But...
(See the end of the chapter for
“He is.” Whatever had passed through Harry’s mind moments ago vanished. It was replaced by an obvious fondness for his pet. “I named the dog after him. He hates it. Worse than that, Remus hates that he loves the thing.” Harry grabbed the dog and pulled him into a hug. Remus barked happily before pushing away and sitting happily at Harry’s feet. “He tried to teach the mutt to be an attack dog and come on raids with me, but it didn’t work out.”
This conversation again.
And, like Harry had said before, Draco's family was sworn allegiance to the Dark Lord. Every time there was a war, his family sided with the Dark Lord of that time, claiming it would provide the most advantages for their kind.
Draco glared at him as much as he could manage before settling Potter down on the bed and tucking him in. Potter, as per usual, protested the nap Draco insisted on him having, but fell asleep quickly.
"What?" Harry sputtered. "I— who told you about Trelawney's ?"
"... No."
"What about?"
"Won't Harry be pissed at you too? Think of him too, Hermione!"
"And Hermione and Ron," Draco added. "If they could all just remove the stick up their arses, that would be perfect."
"My idea."
Although they didn't say it, Pansy knew that Harry, Ron, and Hermione were curious as to why Draco was a completely different person than they were used to. She knew that they'd never seen this side of the blond before and were, by default, dumbstruck by the sight of it.
"Which one's yours?" Harry asked quietly.
"No...?" Draco looked up thoughtfully. "Technically, I've gifted them to you. They're yours now. Besides, I have never come to a DA meeting before. Why would I now?"
She opened her arms and gave Draco a look that told him he needed to hug her. So he did, though it felt a bit awkward. Maybe it was because Draco didn't like her sitting on his bed with her school robes still dirty after sitting in the Slytherin Common Room. He mentally reminded himself to wash the sheets after she left.
“Ray? I don’t think I know anyone named Ray. Had a son named Draco up until a few months ago. The bitch ran away with Viking scum and threw our good name to the dirt. I do have a puppy though. Maybe you mean him?” Lucius reached for a chain at his side and jerked it.
If he remembered correctly, he and Potter had always exchanged mocking, jeering nicknames in each other's directions. Granger and Weasley almost always stepped in (like bloody parents do when their kid is about to get into a fight) and told Draco to shove off, but never before had Granger told him to stop in such a... soft and mundane way.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, you thought wrong." Blaise held out his hands. "Did he attempt the impossible?"
"Breathe, Draco," Pansy cooed. "I'm simply stating my acceptance, alright? This may sound as though you're heterosexual, but this doesn't change anything between us."
Malfoy rolled his eyes, the edges of his lips quirking upwards to express his amusement. "You really are impossible, Potter."
Thanks to the very contradicting opinions, it wasn't until much later did Draco form his own opinion of Sirius Black.
He felt like he was intruding in on Hyacinthe's privacy as he flipped to the first page, but that feeling was immediately replaced with awe because Hyacinthe, as it seemed, was talented as fuck.
Harry drops him off with an awkward hug when they reach the dungeons.
And Draco just hoped that he would live long enough to see it start.
Draco grit his teeth.
Potter nodded slowly. "Yeah. 'Reckless.'"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Me too. I have DADA," Potter said.
"Yes. Of course."
Sirius breathed in deeply. "Harry..."
"Hush, my darling," his father muttered. "When your impossible papa gets here, it'll all be better. I promise."
"What is it?"
There was a large part of him that inwardly crowed that this kiss had nothing to do with who they were portraying in the play and that it was not an accident the way their first one had been. A much smaller, more insignificant part of him was silently taunting Goldstein for being wrong.
at you. He laughed at you and then you— of course you insulted him right back. Oh Jesus, Draco, I'm sorry."
Hermione smiled softly. "Good."
Draco agreed. After his father pushed for him to get the Mark, Draco much rathered to be known as his mother's son. She was always the better person of the two, and she cared for him as a person, not only as the heir. Sometimes, Draco liked to think that he'd always been his mother's son, but his hair and eyes made people believe that he was his father's.
Hermione grinned. "Yes, it is. You read it in
And Narcissa couldn't even bring herself to console him because there was simply no way that she could have thought that it was her home either. Their lavish, yet quiet home was shattered in a mere instant. The inner walls reeked of death and darkness, and shadows lurked in every corner. Meals were accompanied by torture, and the screams of victims echoed in the halls for days on end until they all blended together. Sometime, that victim screaming would be Lucius, and Narcissa tried to shelter her son from it as much as possible— directing Voldemort's and any lurking shadows' attention to herself. She treated herself to lavish garments and remained in the spotlight for as long as she could before breaking down.
But all of their efforts only succeeded in reminding him that Harry wasn't there.
“Dean?” Harry called, not even bothering to glance behind him to make sure he’s ready. “Shoot him.”
Harry was inconsolable for an entire day afterwards. He kept crying, apologizing for being bad and begging for his mama to come back for him.
'This' being their combined efforts of course.
Potter hummed and retrieved the rest of the papers without much difficulty. "Right, and my last name isn't 'Potter'. I heard you, Malfoy."
"That's an unnecessary exaggeration," Draco drawled, but he snatched the plush up and snuggled into him. Feeling loads better already, Draco sat up and peered over his best friend's shoulder. "Are you writing Pansy?"
Draco shrugged.
"I guess what they said about you is true." Draco jumped at that. "Pathetic."
Hell, it was Blaise.
Draco should’ve known each of their insecurities would set off another’s. They’ve always been connected by the hip at Hogwarts.
"She did that? When— oh."
Harry hummed. "So what was up with Snape earlier? He didn't dock points."
I know Trelawney's sacking didn't happen until March and the story is technically still in February, but I've decided to speed things up since I have something planned in the future chapters ;)
He thought Snape was erasing evidence that he'd killed someone— Malfoy was considered to be his rival, but he was still not someone Harry wanted to brutally murder in cold blood.
to help you? Especially for this?"
Eyes widening, Draco was quick to reassure him.
he thought darkly as he stood to head out to the Ministry and start his day.
"Does the question at the end of that indicate you've no clue what's inside the bag or, as I suspect, you've absolutely no idea why you're here?"
"Yes."
"What happened?" Harry asked the reserve Beater, Witt, standing next to him.
Pansy tilted her head and raised her eyebrows in response.
"So I did what any self-respecting, rich wizard would do. I travelled to all the hot-spots across Europe. The ministry had nearly cleared out the Malfoy vaults, but they couldn't touch my mother's Black family vaults – Sirius's excluded – and the ones in other countries. I drank in the most expensive bars and was ran with the richest crowd. Until one day, one of the witches in our group decided to
Harry shook his head, feeling confused and a bit mystified.
That surprised Draco. "Potter, she's twenty-five. How old do you think she should be? As far as that goes, how old were you?"
"Let's pretend for just a moment, you aren't entirely opposed to this plan."
, nestled in below a small theatre marquee. A few spots of rain fell, fat and heavy on the pavement as they approached.
When Draco got home from work the following Thursday, the house felt quiet. Too quiet, in fact. If he had to venture a guess, he'd say it was empty, and he was there alone. Ever since the blow up between Draco and her father, Astoria had been uncharacteristically quiet. He knew she was supposed to see her Healer that afternoon and after this appointment they would be going to two meetings a month until she delivered.
"No, it's okay." Draco curled his fingers around Harry's. He stroked his thumb over Harry's sharp knuckles. "Your crack Auror team apparently hadn't done enough research to know that there was a treatment centre in the basement. The offices and the lab were untouched."
"Hello." He leaned forward and ran his nose along Draco's jawline. "Want me to prove to you how healthy
Harry yawned. "You know five words in and I'd have been falling asleep. I'm useless by Friday afternoon."
Pansy snorted out loud, but Draco's eyes fell open so wide it was almost painful.
where an eerie voice kept calling out from nowhere for them to
"It's okay," Harry said. "I'll make coffee."
"Oh I'm coming over all right, Potter," he muttered. He entered the small lift and pressed the buttons on the Muggle telephone. "I'm coming over and I'm going to yank your wanking arse off your fucking broom! Then I'm going to…"  His tirade was cut short when he reached street level and a loud shock of lightening lit the sky, sizzling against his skin as the bomb-like blast of thunder followed almost immediately. Outside the telephone box, the sky was dark grey and rain poured past the grimy windows, forming into puddles as wind whipped white caps onto the surface of the Thames. Pausing long enough for a quick umbrella charm, Draco looked up down the deserted street before pulling out his wand and disappearing with a crack.
Harry was standing in his kitchen, when a lively little otter came swishing its way in through the window. Harry heard Hermione's voice call out
"Whatever you say, darling." She squeezed his arm, but Draco knew she wasn't fooled. He thought of the red and gold scarf, now tucked safely in a drawer in his new home.
"Okay, there?" Darian asked.
Ludo went utterly still on the floor, tiny eyes popping as wide as they could.
"Astoria Greengrass," he said with as much sincerity as he could muster, "will you consent to taking the name Malfoy as your own?"
Draco scooted his chair over until he was next to Harry, his tone dripping in sarcasm. "Honey, upset is not sobbing as if the world is ending and refusing to let loose of the bowl until your incredibly amazing and loving husband
Draco had been pacing about his sitting room as he spoke. Now he stopped, took the phone from his ear and looked at it before shaking his head and raising it back into place. "She's excited… to see me…" he repeated incredulously.
Gunther stared at him, blinking slowly, as if trying to gather himself. Draco felt a shiver of alarm.
"Now in as Seeker for the Appleby Arrows;" the announcer's voice echoed over the pitch, "Number nine, Harry Potter!"
Harry flipped him his middle finger, then bent again, (ah, that lovely arse) and picked something up off of a small table that sat near an armchair by the fire. When he came back to bed, Draco punched up his pillow and lay on his side, facing Harry and eyeing what he carried with interest. It was a dinner plate; on it there were grapes, sliced brie and saltwater crackers and some of Draco's favourite soft-baked chocolate biscuits.
"Oh, I'm sure she is," Pansy said, her eyes fierce. "Astoria may be an utter idiot, but Simone is not. Oh, I should have hexed her when I had the chance, the vicious old cow."
wave his wand, so I really appreciate your making sure Deon goes back. He'd never admit he's past exhaustion and will soon face-plant onto the road."
"Good night, little love," he whispered, leaving the door opened to a crack.
Beecham raised his wand, pointing it directly at Draco's heart. "Don't play stupid. You know why you're here. Just tell us what we want to know and maybe your skinny arse won't end up in Azkaban, even though that's exactly where it belongs."
"Oi! Shut up, you lot!" He looked directly at Harry. "Before we all go into a post-lunch food coma from Mum's cooking, Harry has some news."
"Simone," he hissed under his breath, "kindly remember this is a Muggle establishment. I've no doubt that Astoria is perfectly capable of walking out the door and into the cab."
"I'm aware. And there's much more you need to know, but I'm so ridiculously knackered." He yawned. "I need some sleep so I can tell you all of it."
She sputtered, but Harry put his hand on her arm and shook his head. "I'm fine," he forced himself to tell Ron stoutly. "Honestly, why should I care?"
"Nothing important. Some crystal that's remarkably similar to Mother's, which will give me a complete set of twelve wine glasses. You know I lost four of them." Harry nodded. "We may never entertain like that again, but I'd like to own them, anyway, just in case we ever do eat anything other than take away pizza or curry."
"Oh tish tosh," she replied smoothly. "I'll give Mimsy some instructions and be over as soon as I'm dressed. She'll prepare something here and pop over to serve it."
"Shut up," he muttered, shooting a dark look towards Pansy. She had crossed her long legs and one of her feet was bouncing in its high heel. He knew if he looked at her face she'd be smirking, so he didn't.
aspects of my career."
One very early Tuesday morning Sophia chose to sleep in, so Draco met Pansy for coffee in their favourite coffee shop, she on her way to work, and he on his way to the university library to get a head start on next semester's readings. Despite the freezing cold morning, Draco ordered an iced coffee, and picked up a plate sized sugar cookie covered in pink icing.
Draco didn't look convinced, so Pansy pulled out her
"I understand."
Draco stood stock still; prick bobbing, its head peeking out from under his mussed button down. Harry could see a drop of moisture ready to fall from the slit. Harry's eyes met Draco's. Draco's pupils were blown wide, his eyes so filled with what could only be desire, that Harry's legs went weak, so he took Draco's waist to steady himself. Holding on, Harry went slowly to his knees, his eyes never leaving Draco's. He brought his mouth to the tip of Draco's cock and licked the drop as it began to fall. He skimmed his hands up and down the backs of Draco's legs, smiling when Draco shivered. Harry thrilled at the sensation of knowing
"No shit," Draco drawled lazily, his eyes glazing over with boredom. On that day, Draco had just heard about Sirius Black, who his mother had been particularly fond of when they were younger. Draco hadn't understood what she meant when she said that Sirius 'was her best friend' so Draco had brought it up with his usual companions. His friends practically shot up with surprise. Pansy, especially, had gone all mother-hen on him and burst into tears as she wailed that she'd thought they were best friends this whole time. "So I suppose that unless that particular person spoke to me of it..."
"About six years, Sirius."
"Sorry mate, but Draco's right. With Hermione on his side, he can't lose. And sure, Blaise is good and all, but compared to Hermione? No offense, but he's not good enough."
Harry had saved him in more ways than one that night.
"Draco..."
Hello again~~ I hope you guys are ready for a bit more action from the incredibly long titled fanfic that I'll most likely change in the future!
And so, that brought along the worries of Christmas presents.
"Yes, my hand. What else was I supposed to do with it?" Draco asked, as though it didn't occur to him to just flip the bottle upside down and wait for the sauce to come out.
"So tell him. Tell him all your pain and let him take it all away. Express your feelings and watch him choose you. Let him know everything and remember this situation as his future continues to include you."
Theo rolled his eyes. "Romantically, git."
"Late?" Potter and Girl Weasley both echoed.
"Just whenever I've nothing else to do," Draco replied.
"Please be mine, please be mind," Blaise chanted.
When Saturday arrived, Draco seated himself on the bleachers and set up his studying station. As his friends began to file into the Quidditch Pitch, Draco was only slightly surprised to see Cassius, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walking alongside them. After all, there would be an uneven number of people if Draco counted the heads correctly. However, he also remembered that Quidditch was supposed to be played with more than three players on each team anyways. With the additional four players, there would be nine players on the Pitch, which would be the perfect game to have one golden snitch and one bludger on.
"We're friends," Harry repeated optimistically. "And he's not a git."
"You really think of me like that?" Harry asked quietly.
he scolded himself.
"Yes."
Sighing, Draco couldn't resist the urge to flip to the next page. And the next. And the next.
When Draco got back to his room, he altered the size of the bed and conjured a large round table. He set the books down, flipping them open mindlessly.
Draco couldn't ignore the way that his heart fluttered at that. Although he wasn't one for theatrics (not that much anyways), Draco felt pleased to hear someone say that to him. He already knew it, obviously, but hearing it from someone was nice. Well, maybe it'd felt nice because it was Harry telling him that. Had it been Boot or someone Draco didn't particularly fancy, their bollocks would've been hexed off.
This wasn’t supposed to happen. He was supposed to entrance Draco, save and ruin him, and then get rid of him. He’d done the entrancing part, but now that he was on the precipice of completely his revenge, Harry hesitates. Like it or not, he cared about Draco. He wasn’t supposed to, but it’d happened anyways.
“I will! I just need to… to… to find a whore to fuck and I’ll be over it.”
Then, without hesitating, Draco turned and handed a vial to Blaise. "Here. You test it."
“You want me to get you one?” Blaise asked him seriously.
going to squish onto one bed tonight," Draco chuckled. He tried to comfort them by patting their backs and nearly had a midlife crisis when realizing he didn't have enough hands. "The three of you were already heavy enough to nearly break my bed."
“I didn’t know you baked your own bread,” Draco said in-between bits. Admittedly, the grain was coarse and got stuck in his teeth, but it’s a very small price to pay for such a delicious treat.
It was certainly an interesting theory.
How scandalous.
Harry's breath hitched. He couldn't agree more. "Did she not do that a lot when you were a kid?"
"Just a bit of blood. It's alright," he assured. Then, feeling Harry's eyes on him, Draco bit the inside of his cheek. "Mine, in case you worried otherwise."
Transfiguration went well, if Draco had any say in it.
"Potter wanted to speak to me about when we were going to meet next to rehearse," Draco replied easily.
Resting his head back against the wall, Draco laughed. "Hogwarts Star Seeker? I think you've mixed me up with Potter."
Draco nodded, hoping he'd be allowed to leave once Potter asked his bloody question..
On the third Thursday of June, Harry woke up alone on his bed. Although this may have been a commonly depressing occurrence for him before, Harry had been fully expecting to kiss his boyfriend good morning that fine day and was therefore very disappointed to have no such thing. Draco Malfoy was not in his bed. Thus, Harry had to begin his day by finding the curious little Slytherin.
But, of course, it'd be a disgrace it he had. His father would never let him hear the end of it, Severus would forever be displeased with him, and his mother would be terribly disappointed. After all, if he failed in one thing, he might as well failed in everything.
"Malfoy?"
Potter was still strangely quiet and docile when they left the office, not even complaining when Draco set him down. He only looked up with sad eyes and nuzzled his nose into Draco's side calf. It was as though he was apologizing for getting Draco in trouble in his own little adorable way. Even though Draco wasn't in trouble— it was still quite difficult for him to comprehend— he knew that if he was, he wouldn't be able to stay angry at Potter for long.
"I can't image Umbridge have a high status with how horribly she teaches," Theo savagely remarked. "Honestly. Magic isn't even about the concept. It's about the skill."
"What?"
"I know, Harry. Calm down."
His first statement immediately made Draco pull him in for a tight hug whilst his second earned him an embarrassed slap on the arm.
"I'd rather help out." Harry shrugged. "Cho's not my type anymore anyways."
The Gryffindor had a wickedly vivid imagination, but Pansy couldn't help but shudder at the imagery.
“You want Ray huh?”
"You know, Malfoy, we already told each other something last week," Potter said, catching up with him quickly. "You didn't have to run up to me before class."
"Well, I think it'd do us both some good," Potter explained. "As far as I know, we're the only two people who have them at all hours. Maybe there's something really wrong with our heads and someone else with the ability to do so can help us figure out what exactly is wrong with us."
"I'll try."
"If," Professor Hayes continued, "at any moment, you have an idea before next class or you feel uncomfortable presenting your idea in front of the class, my door is always open to discuss it."
Not that he would have deserved it though.
Draco grit his teeth, yet kept his mouth shut.
Although Draco agreed with that logic, he knew that he couldn't disagree with what Blaise said next.
It was a risky move, they knew this, especially because Draco's father was close with the Dark Lord. It was dangerous and risky for them to speak with him about this. It could have been considered treason or disloyalty, and both would lead in death. If Draco had 'distracted' the Dark Lord— and how would he have even done that?— Draco himself and his blood family could have been killed.
The thought made his shudder.
"And not to mention the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets," Ron groaned. "That was some nasty stuff."
When he finally left the room, however, that fact dampened his mood tremendously.
"Shame. I know a few witches who would pay thousands of galleons to see a pensieve."
Draco let out a weak chuckle for the conversation's sake. "No, the Mind Healer."
"I have to go. I think there's something in the book I read—"
"It was written by my 'deer' old dad," Harry chuckled.
"What do you mean by that? Do you mean I could have been staying with Sirius this whole time?" Harry asked, wincing upon saying the name but still appeared like he was surprised and curious.
Especially if you're in love with someone on what your parents and ancestors assume to be 'the other side'.
"I'm happy. I know I shouldn't be because... y'know, but I'm really happy."
Blaise wiped a nonexistent tear away. "You're going to help her? Just like that?"
Back then— before Harry outed himself and Draco thoroughly snogged him with Blaise in the background, being salty about being the third-wheel— there had been something that was between them. Something that held back from being completely honest and happy with each other. Something closely related to their feelings with each other.
"Look forward to it then." Ron shrugged. "If she mentioned it, it must be a pretty good place."
Harry shook his head disbelievingly, the small smile on his face bringing Draco a feeling of triumph. "I think if we tell Hermione what we did, she's going to kill us."
Blaise snapped and did his iconic finger guns. "Nice—"
"No. We simply believe that it'd be better if we kept this under a low profile," Pansy replied. "Please refrain from calling St. Mungo's."
"Draco?" Montague's voice was silvery. Draco shook himself of his thoughts, smiling weakly. "Are you feeling faint?"
"R.O.R. Tomorrow evening. DADA planning," Pansy whispered to him quietly. Draco nodded.
"Then?"
Truth be told, no. No he did not.
That's what Draco loves about him.
Draco stopped dead in his tracks.
Many people, like Sirius and Remus, were unhappy to see Draco stroll in and declare that he was helping. That opinion quickly changed when Draco spent hours in the library and realized he knew what one of the many horcruxes were.
He knew he would have to begin by speaking to their professor first and foremost though.
Draco, on the other hand, looked something akin to both stress and nervousness as his eyes darting back towards the people from their school. It makes Harry wonder if he should've warned him that they might be there. But then again, the Three Broomsticks was one of the best establishments Harr's ever known; it is a given that a place like this would be filled with people having something worth celebrating.
"I just needed to," Harry reassured while Ron piped up and said, "Harry had a vision that Sirius was being tortured by Voldemort at the Department of Mysteries during class. He really wanted to go, but Hermione thought it was a trap. So Harry decided he'd use a fireplace to make sure that he was in France."
Severus mindlessly took chocolate out of his pockets and handed it to Harry. He continued to stare at Harry, gesturing for him to ask a question that was already asked. He only realized what had happened when Harry clutched the sides of his stomach and laughed uncontrollably. It helped that Professor Sprout, who sat next to him, muttered 'oh my'. That, and the rumor mill that was suddenly working in a hasty manner.
Snape ignored him. "And do try to not to display your lack of familial affection by begging me for chocolate like a dog barks for attention. I do not fancy being blamed for two chocolate addicts."
Draco nodded again. He slowly let go of Harry, feeling bereft immediately. He covered his mouth and coughed once, twice, and then quickly hid the flower in his pocket. Of course it was a bloody
Granger blinked. "I didn't think you would be one to smell the books, Malfoy."
But, instead of asking and possibly risk getting hexed, Draco made a much wiser choice. He looked away from Potter, taking several steps away from him. Once he was a safe distance away from Potter, Draco began.
"I know it sounds stupid, but... Harry obviously cares a lot about Draco. Not any more than we do, but there's just something different in the way Harry looks at him. There's always been something different. Harry smiles more with Draco, I guess. He looks like he wants to just be with him forever."
And then Draco wondered if Harry even thought someone would love him like Draco did at their young age— willing to sacrifice everything he could and more if Harry ever needed him to.
"Just—" and here it was— "why are you holding hands with Malfoy?"
"Hermione!" Harry hissed.
After letting him know the time and the place they were going to meet, Harry stays in a good mood for the rest of the day.
"...yes."
The goblin nodded and led them to a hidden room behind the counters. Draco unhesitantly sat down in one of the silver chairs and watched the door patiently. Harry took a seat as well, blinking as the goblin then disappeared.
"Private information."
“You’re spoiling me,” Draco whispered under the covers that night.
"And why not?"
“And death?” Harry repeated dumbly.
"Yes, Professor?"
"Exactly! It's been a week! Why are you guys acting up
Draco and Harry left the expanding to their friends, however.
When Blaise shot up from his seat beside Draco and wrestled a few students out of the way, Draco frowned. It worsened when Blaise returned looking like a kicked puppy.
When the door burst open one afternoon, Draco was momentarily shocked and then delighted to see Harry. The Viking was loaded down with loot and Draco helped him take care of it. As soon as his arms were free, Harry scooped Draco in a big hug, spinning him around twice before setting him back down.
"Not that I'm uncomfortable," Harry said slowly, "but I'm still working through the trauma with my Mind Healer. So it's easier for me to get frustrated or angry about it. Not the dying part, obviously. When we covered the war, we talked about my role in it. Everything else though..."
Wondering why the idiotic toerag decided to joke around with him, Draco rolled his eyes. "No. Just for that, we are going to do one more thing to you."
"I'll be alright with just an Acceptable—"
"How many hours did you sleep last night?"
Interesting.
He paid attention to Draco, ignoring his little temper tantrums whenever Harry refused to give him enough alone time to work on the Dark Lord's task.
When school ended in June, everyone left to France.
Harry had been careful to avoid certain words after ward.
"Why?"
Malfoy frowned. “You’re rather good at conversation maneuvering. You’d have made a fine Slytherin.” When Harry scoffed, Malfoy quickly changed his mind. “Never mind. You’d have been ripped apart by the lot of us. You would have cost us half of our house points within the first year alone.”
"That'd be fine by me," Harry said. Draco smiled and, as if she just knew him that well, Vicky popped up without him needing to ask for her. If Pansy was not accustomed to house-elves appearing and disappearing like that, she would've squeaked and jumped away. Much like the reaction that Harry had. "What the— where did you come from?"
"About how I thought all of you were my best friends? Because I've never had any before?"
"Back in first year! 'First time on a broom', my arse! I thought that I was talentless for how you defeated me whilst claiming it was your first time," Draco huffed. "I nearly quit flying because of you!"
Merlin, Draco was such a failure.
"I don't want to try," Draco huffed, folding his arms stubbornly. "I like things the way that they are and I'd—"
"Draco, if you would just quit that stupid 'I'm strong on my goddamn own' mask for a minute!" Blaise snapped. He took a deep breath to calm himself down. That wasn't the point he was trying to make after all. "What I'm trying to say is that you were there for me and you weren't even giving me a chance to do the same for you. And, god, I'm not looking at you with
"I'm here, you know," Harry muttered.
Merlin, if Draco was in love with Harry, he'd be fine in a mere instant. Theo could only hope that it ended up being this remorseful arse all along.
No, his mother would be shaken, but she would never cut ties with him. Draco knew his mother loved him in ways she couldn't quite demonstrate due to her upbringing. She might be against it at first, but she would come around.
Draco kept his mouth shut, nodding.
Harry grimaced, and Draco worried that he wouldn't be welcomed to be so. "I wish a war can be avoided."
"I have to feed Potter," Draco said quietly.
"Potter." Draco struggled to breathe. "I think you were being too expressive. Perhaps calm down a bit and then try it again. Remember that since you will be playing a pureblood, you need to act calm and unaffected."
Harry visibly panicked and Draco internally cheered. "What? No! I mean, I do believe in you, but I don't think we did anything wrong."
Draco arched a brow. "Blood status and inheritance aside, he's a brilliant wizard, amazing Quidditch player, master of the violin, loyal without faults, and honorable when it comes to his word. Are you sure he's not your type?"
Potter may be an idiot, but his observation skills— at least when it came to matters as stupid as he was— were rather exceptional. He must have noticed how some students kept attempting to bother Draco during his classes and when he walked in the corridors, and Potter must have thought his stupid presence would make them stop.
"Snape talked to me about—" Harry harshly cut himself off.
"I already told you why."
with him?
And then someone grabbed his waist from behind and pulled him into a tight embrace.
"Seeker's Game? Best of three?" Harry challenged.
"You really thought I would hit you."
"Nevermind. Let's just start practicing the first few lines. You have your copy, yes?" Draco asked.
He abruptly shut his mouth, his cheeks bright red. Draco both thanked and cursed the mystery bloke in his mind. He was grateful to see Harry's blush, yes, but he was pissed it wasn't because of him. Draco had to force the flowers in his lung to overlook this fact.
"I'd expect to be," Draco replied. "I've got her tact and intellect, not that Father could've given me any of his with how little he has of both."
Montague cursed. "Bloody hell. Did we accidentally drop it?"
Blaise gawked at him. "Don't tell me you don't!"
He had a difficult time feeling horrible about it, however, Hermione arrived to help.
"Make sure you try and not piss them off even more," Blaise reminded.
Hence, Draco now faced a major dilemma.
"It didn't but I'm fine."
Draco rolled his eyes before replying,
"But the deadline's tonight…"
For now, it was just them. And it was enough.
Harry cowered. "I... because I knew you would be like this," he said.
“What?”
"So you didn't tell anyone?"
"The Dursleys."
Suddenly, it was important for Draco to make him understand that Draco would do it a thousand times over if it meant Harry was safe.
"Can we go?" Harry asked Dumbledore.
"I don't know. Their names?" Harry asked, scrunching up his nose. "They're named after flowers."
"Right, er, if it comes out that it's not me," he continued obliviously, "and I ask him to help me... well, you saw what he did for the D.A. I didn't ask him to, and Draco did it anyways."
"Let's meet down in your room in about five minutes. I want to hear everything," Pansy said in a no-nonsense tone. She quickly stood up, patting her skirt and robes down. "Afterwards, I may or may not show you my fifteen scrolls of wedding plans that I formulated a week ago."
When the pile was put into an indestructible room and fiendfyre was conjured, Draco and Harry rejoiced.
"I don't need to. They wouldn't help me even if their pride and ego rested upon it." He was probably bruising his bottom lip with how harshly he was biting it. "They have no reason to, which is why I didn't need you to tell them about it. I don't want— I don't need someone to do it for me out of pity. You three... I know you want me around. For some reason, none of you have harbored any hateful feelings towards me. And I wouldn't ever ask you to lower yourself for someone else for my sake. Besides, Potter, Weasley, and Granger have no reason to help me. They don't care."
"Draco had invited him by the way. Downright insisted, if I recall correctly."
Draco cursed under his breath. It was Potter's fault. Of course Potter bothered him so much, Draco couldn't remember something so major in the only class Draco passively disliked. At least he had a full week to think one up. He's never been so grateful that his Muggle Theatre class met only once a week.
"It's important anyhow," Draco said, redirecting his gaze to Chang. "It'll take no longer than a moment, I'm afraid."
Draco blinked. He felt as though he was missing something incredibly obvious. "What do you mean?"
"Very well. Disssmisssed."
Eyes widening, Draco leaned away from Harry. He mouthed, "Who is that?"
Ron suddenly spoke up. "You know who it is, don't you? The witch you're in love with?"
"Your cheeks are red."
"Yes, many great apologies," his best friend drawled. Then he went back to work, scribbling onto parchment furiously. Casting his own warming charm— doing it purely out of spite— Draco took it as a warning that he should do the same. Without even glancing towards the book, he started writing his essay on the Smokescreen spell for DADA. When he noticed it, Blaise gave him a distasteful look.
"Don't call him that," Granger said, flipping the page almost nonchalantly.
Pansy rolled her eyes, obviously not understanding Draco's reasonable reason for stress. Of course, if she was in Draco's position, she would be thinking the same way he was.
"— with all of you," Draco finished lamely. All of them stopped and looked at him in surprise. "We could fly, go to Hogsmeade, eat lunch by the lake... maybe take a little break from all the research and homework."
Draco thought silently as he awaited Harry's answer.
of hurting Draco was unbearable, never mind living with the consequences. But if he kept Draco and continued to live out this relationship he’d stumbled into…
He was going to hand her the journal anyway. He only read half of it, and it was already driving him crazy. It'd be best to hand it to her and simply wait for the script to arrive. Not that he was looking forward to asking Potter, who was to play his uncle Regulus, to marry him. Merlin, why was he always stuck in the worst situations?
Draco grimaced. "Merlin, Pansy."
"Oh, for heaven's sake, Parkinson," Hermione chided. "I was simply startled when you answered the door. As neither of us has time for games, I'm going to surmise you're aware of the
"Do you remember adjourning to the loo?"
Harry gave Draco a playful shove. "I seriously doubt you were simply healing hangnails. How'd you end up here?"
There were birds chirping outside the windows of his Advanced Taxation classroom and he decided about ten minutes into the day's lecture that they were infinitely more exciting than listening to Professor Fillpot drone on and on about the taxation of mergers and acquisitions. The man reminded Draco very much of Binns, his ghostly Hogwarts History of Magic Professor. If he had to hear about the minutiae of his chosen profession for one more minute, he feared he might just stab his biro into his ear. He scribbled a note on the edge of his binder with it, then stared at it for a long moment. Even after all this time using one instead of a jar of ink and a quill, it still felt odd in his hand, and he found himself still positioning his hand and arm as if to avoid an ink bottle. Funny what habits remained.
He read it over several times, thinking it was so blatantly obvious he might as well have written,
"So, Harry, if you haven't any plans once you're through here, stop by for the best fried trout and chips in four counties, pulled out of the River Eden by our own angling association. You won't find better."
Draco's brow furrowed. "I'm afraid you'll need to be a bit clearer, Scott. Does what bother me?"
Draco rolled his head onto Harry's shoulder. "Thank you for that." He sighed. "You know I went to Christie's for an auction this morning."
Pansy threw up her hands in frustration, then pointed at Draco. "You! Shut the fuck up." Then she pointed at Philippe "You! You arse! Not helping!"
Harry grinned faintly. "Yeah. Apparently he's been feeding Gawain information for months, and Gawain would pay him a cut of his profits. Up until recently, things had been working out quite well for him and Bagman. Bagman would gather his titbits of information, and pass them along to Robards in a "For Your Eyes Only" report. If it wasn't illegal, it would be fairly brilliant."
"Thank you, Narcissa," Harry said, wringing the cloth and hanging it over the side of the sink. He turned to his mother in law, looking a bit chagrined. "I appreciate you... coming to my rescue."
"There's always a choice, Harry," Charlie told him. "You just have to decide what yours is."
"Pans," Draco said, his throat tight with dread. He hurried over and sat next to her, clutching her hand in bloodless fingers. "What's happened? Is Zia Sophia ill?"
"Ask. I know you want to." Hermione gave him a slight smile. "You all but turn yourself inside out every time a blond man walks by; you aren't terribly subtle, Harry." He felt a wave of panic, and he looked quickly towards the men's loo. "Oh, relax, she said, waving a bit expansively with her hands, the only outward indication that she might have had a bit too much to drink, too. "Ron doesn't even think to look for that."
Draco quickly backed up and then moved forward again, hoping it looked as if he'd just arrived home. He got to the door just as Astoria came flouncing out.
"Don't wake her," Draco scolded, coming around the couch. He lifted her gently from Harry's arms, and she seemed to melt into his arms. "There's my princess," he whispered. "Daddy's back." He lifted her and brushed his lips over her forehead. "Did you miss me?"
She sailed out of the room, Walden scuttling to keep up with her.
Draco didn't doubt it for a minute. He felt far more than two years her senior. More like two dozen.
Pansy looked horrified. "That is
Draco slid his hand into Harry's and clasped their finger together. "Let's walk a bit and then we can Apparate to where we can eat. It's still near the water, but not so near where the tourists visit."
Now the tears that had been glistening on Draco's lashes slid freely down his cheeks. "Take the baby, Harry." Draco said, handing Tommy to his other grandfather. He leaned down and kissed them both on the head, in turn. "Why don't you and Scott show that beautiful boy to the rest of the family. You'll be better at keeping them away tonight. And don't let them convince you to pass him around. Tomorrow is soon enough for visitors, in small bunches."
Draco tilted his head and glared. "I'll have you know I now make a quite delicious cheese toastie."
"Kitchen, Pans." Draco turned the page in his book, trying to concentrate on advanced tort reform and finding it almost impossible.
Darian grinned. "You invited me?"
Astoria sniffed, crossing her arms. "I saw my Healer this morning."
"No," Harry replied. "Micah is really good."
Harry laughed. "I see a day in Darian's chair in her future."
Draco gave him a lazy grin back. "So. I'm assuming Ludo is cooling his heels in a holding cell."
motion when he started to interrupt. "When I'm finished you can yell at me."
"We'll discuss this later," Draco said as evenly as he could. He knew he'd need to at least appear interested in this child. "How are you feeling?"
The sound of the door opening caused Draco to whirl around, and it suddenly occurred to him that he and
Pansy fluttered her lashes at him. "Because I'm one of the few people on earth who has never put up with your bullshit."
Harry braced himself for the rest of the article.
this is difficult for me? Tell me, Pans, when you leave here will you use magic to repair those ridiculously expensive shoes? Will you have to try to figure out how you're going to get into town to go to a Muggle market so you can eat for the next week? Or even have to worry about cooking or cleaning up after yourself?"
a message was an understatement. It had been nearly two weeks since he'd somehow fucked up colossally with
"Hullo?"
Harry shook his head. "Like it would have mattered. The last time I saw him, he made it abundantly clear that I could go fuck myself." Harry ran his hand over his face, then up through his hair. "Can we just forget about it now? Please?"
. It had been rather a delight to discover her interest in Muggle literature and it was certainly something that had brought them closer since Lucius had been otherwise occupied.
"Charlie! Merlin! Oh fuck! Weasley get your bloody arse over here. A branch has fallen on Potter." As he hollered for Charlie, he removed his coat and threw it over Harry's leg.
"I suppose I ought to thank you, you know," Harry said aloud. He knew the dragon wasn't listening, and probably didn't care, but that didn't matter to Harry right now. "You are the one who sort of introduced me to Draco again. I mean, if you'd not have sent that flaming tree limb falling – who knows if Draco and I would have even talked. I have a feeling he wasn't planning on coming out of the infirmary while I was here. So, again, thanks for dropping a burning limb on me. But…did you really have to go and burn someone so badly that I don't get to spend my last full day here with him?" He laughed as Zoya appeared to be staring at him. "Anyway, I've really had a good time here and maybe I'll come back one day and see your babies. Try to be good and not cause Healer Malfoy to have to work too hard." He turned to leave and was surprised to see Zoya was still staring at him as if she understood. She raised her head up and down, as if in a salute. Harry decided she had heard him, however she was neither impressed by his sole-bearing nor penitent about the problems he thought she'd caused.
The silver grey eyes came back to Harry's. "Fix what?"
When she leaned back, she gave him an encouraging smile. He popped the cork on the small vial and quickly downed half of it, not giving himself time to think. It tasted awful, but almost immediately his frightened, racing heart began to slow and a gradual growing warmth quelled the nausea roiling in his gut. He sighed softly, his taut muscles slowly relaxing.
Harry shook his head at Deon, but put the bag back in his pocket. "I wish I had your confidence."
Harry arched a brow, but after a moment they exchanged smiles and clinked their glasses together in an unspoken toast.
"I figured." Darian kept walking, pausing when he touched a blank-eyed skull on one branch. "Does this mean they died?"
, but their status had been offline. He regretted not properly exchanging numbers, his messy handwriting be damned. Or maybe he had been a little too harsh with his opening texts.
Harry frowned as he read the engine's reports, unable to find anything that should cause the glitches he'd been experiencing for the last several days. Finally, the words
"How about we just go out for dinner and then you turn in early on a night when you can sleep in?" Darian suggested cheerfully as he sat on Harry's bed and watched him jumping to get into some tight black jeans.
They sat in awkward silence for several seconds, and Potter finally leaned on the table. "So?"
"Ouch. Causing me pain will not help you, you know." She elbowed him sharply in the ribs, and he grunted. "Now, let's stop injuring one another and go see the chaos your pretty other half has created in your absence."
He took a deep breath, trying to hold onto his excitement, not wanting to let her leach it away. He knew she was only concerned about him, but sometimes that concern felt strangling. She had an idea in her head where they should all be, and what they should all be doing, and he'd already denied her that by deciding not to be an Auror. Harry wanted, no
In his bedroom, he saw his favourite photo of his mother. He had been about five when it was taken. Narcissa stood on the path in the midst of her favourite roses at sunset one spring evening. It was rare to see her just standing in her garden. Draco more often remembered her pruning the roses or collecting a basketful to arrange and place around the manor. Lucius never understood why she didn't just send an elf to do the menial tasks, but Draco recalled his mother telling him her roses would whisper to her and remind her of the beauty in the world. The flowers were creamy white with the palest pink centres and she wore robes of the exact blushing pink colour. They floated around her in the soft breeze and she turned towards the camera as the photo looped over and over. Her smile was as brilliant as the sunset behind her. Draco remembered the day as if it were yesterday. He used to believe she was a fairy princess who talked to roses; he still thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world and he missed her terribly.
"Draco, I..." Gunther took a deep breath. "I am sorry, old friend, but 'Blue Dragon Mother with White Baby' was removed from the auction by the family yesterday. They've decided not to have Christie's auction that particular piece with the rest."
Blaise laughed and walked over to Harry’s bed. He put his finger under Harry’s chin and tilted it up, pressing their lips together. “Thought I might have tired you out too much last night, Draco. It was fun though, wasn’t it?”
Draco turned around and nearly jumped out of his skin when he found Harry standing right behind him. “What the fuck, Potter!”
to Zabini to keep him thinking he had done something wrong when he really hadn’t. They hadn’t really talked about it but Draco must have wanted to snog Blaise, right?  “I’m not Draco,” Harry told him. “I’m Harry Potter.”
Harry groaned in frustration. “Well what’s your bright idea then?”
"You –" Harry groaned in frustration and tugged his fingers through his messy hair. "That night after the banquet when you took me back to your hotel room and we snogged. You had no idea what that night meant to me. You were like a God to me and I looked up to you. Then you left me there all alone without saying a word to me, and I realized what a sodding fool I'd been thinking I meant anything to you. It fucked with my head and that's why I missed my jump." Harry glanced up at Draco, tears sliding down his cheeks. He laughed awkwardly and wiped them away with his sleeve, but more fell despite his best efforts. "Your free skate was right after mine so you were standing there waiting to go next. The moment I saw you, I lost my footing and that's why I had my accident. And all this time, not a word from you, but then you show up here and you make me think you care about me again."
"Well yes, but –"
Draco held out his hand and let Harry slide the ring onto his finger. "It almost seems like you're proposing," he managed to tease even though it felt like his heart had relocated to his throat.
Draco pressed his mouth into a thin line. “That would imply you’re staying.”
Draco felt his cheeks heat with embarrassment. He should have cast a silencing charm. If he’d had his wits about him a bit more he would have remembered that. It wasn’t like him to be so careless.
“Don’t be a prat, Malfoy,” Harry said, walking over and standing beside him. “Although for you it’s probably habit by now.”
Harry laughed. “Not in the least, but I want it anyway,” he said, heading up the block as the mob of reporters followed after them.
"I couldn't possibly," Draco said definitively. "That's your free skate and if you have to go first I might miss it. I'll just have to tell her I can't make it."
“Uh, yeah, it’s your name innit?” Ron said with a shrug. “You feeling alright, Harry?”
His declaration was met with a moment of silence before Mrs. Potter cleared her throat. "Well isn't that nice, Harry? You were just saying the other day you were thinking of going in a different direction. You know, since Minerva has so many students and can't really give you the one-on-one training you need."
They made it about halfway through dinner before Ron brought up the owl. Harry was impressed he'd not led with that the moment they stepped out of the Floo.
"Too much arse," Ron said under his breath, and Harry waded up a piece of parchment and tossed it at his head. He batted it aside with a grin.
Pansy's mouth dropped open and she stared.
Returning to sit on the side of the bed, Draco raked his hands through his hair. He longed for a hot shower and some clothes that weren't the rough cotton prison garb he'd been given to wear. He needed to think…what possible reason did the Aurors have for breaking into his home in the middle of the night? There was not a thing he could think of. He'd been sure to pay his taxes on time and nothing about his business was illegal.
"What can I get you?" Potter said. Once again, that new, deeper voice moved along Draco's nervous system. How must it sound in bed, he wondered, then could have kicked himself when his cock sat up and took notice. He was grateful for the long coat.
"Why, the fact you're under suspicion of— how shall I put this? Being a member of the world's oldest profession?"
"Oh, it's repaired. I came here purposely."
"But…" Harry trailed off then paused, watching Draco's eyes move toward Hermione and Ron. "You didn't deserve this," he repeated firmly. He hesitated, then walked off to meet his friends. As he left, Harry's ever-present Gryffindor scarf worked free of his collar and slid unnoticed to the floor.
"You didn't think I wouldn't," Harry said finally, "not honestly."
"Wow."
Draco reached down beside the cushion in the chair he'd sat in and pulled out the tired, worn Gryffindor scarf.
Malfoy bit his lower lip, his nostrils flaring. "Just make sure I'm not late."
He looked at the photograph he had of his mother in her garden, the one that had comforted him through many nights at the beginning of his sentence. He hoped that his daughter inherited some of her strength and grace.
"Wait," Pansy said, jumping up as well. "It might be those Aurors again."
"I understand," she said finally. "Your father did not... care for us as he should have."
Harry patted his chest, and Draco could hear the crackling of paper under his robes. "Can we sit?"
"It wasn't a commitment; we did fuck several times, but it's over."
"The man with Papa's scarf?"
At that, Harry was able to manage a real grin. "She means well."
Pansy rolled her eyes. "And he's back." She gave him a speculative look. "Although I'm not sure I did the world any favours with that."
work. How the hell am I supposed to find a place to live, find these elusive credentials, register for uni," he ticked each item off on his fingers, "and not get tossed into Azkaban in the process?"
"Past tense," he reminded her. "One Saturday, Harry and I had gone to the Muggle supermarket to pick up some things. There were two women in front of us in the check-out lane and one of them was singing the praises of her new masseuse. She was saying how working with him had helped so much after some accident made her unable to raise her one arm. I thought, what would it be like to actually help someone like that? So, I asked Harry to find some information about it."
