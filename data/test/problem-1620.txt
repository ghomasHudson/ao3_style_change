Draco felt it in the back of his neck, in the tips of his fingers first, before he even processed the feeling on his lips - Harry Potter was kissing him. It was a moment before Draco’s body came back into his control, but when it did he took full advantage, first - he pulled Harry’s glasses from his face so he could deepen the kiss, and then his hands were everywhere - feeling all the ridges of Harry’s back, grabbing hold of every strand of hair on Harry’s head, and finally - after months of discussing it with Bones - grabbing hold of Harry Potter’s arse. He’d have to share the details with her later. They’d both been wrong about what it felt like because there was no way they could have ever adequately described the perfection of it.
Draco nods, and at last his usual demeanour returns in the form of a smirk. “It seems I have no choice in the matter. You have far too many friends and fans to run from. Not to mention, I’m not particularly fond of bat bogey hexes.”
“You mistake me, Miss Granger. I don’t mean it as an insult. You have a very intelligent, inquiring logical mind. Asphodel root is rather difficult to grasp for most academics due to its rejection of sound logic. It’s impossible to determine how the root will react with other ingredients without experiment. We can guess, but a mind like yours repels guessing (rightly so in most instances, it’s a useless task), sensibly preferring formulas to reach a conclusion.” He shrugs, “And there is no formula for asphodel root.”
When he fell asleep, he was pleased to return to a journey of space travel with Draco on their magical unicorn.
Draco blanked. He couldn’t think of a single thing, except the obvious. Which of course he couldn’t tell Potter.
She’s reviewing new case files when he comes clean, remaining behind his own desk as a protective barrier.
“Got it!” Draco confirmed, popping up beside Teddy, who was jumping on the bed enthusiastically, clapping his hands at the show. “But now you have to sleep.”
The arousing clean up finished much too quickly, Potter went to take Draco’s cock into his mouth, but Draco stopped him. Draco knew he wasn’t long off now - not after what he’d just witnessed - and he had another thought. Something else he very much wanted to try, but not without Potter’s permission.
Harry must have read it ten times before he finally looked up at Draco - although his vision was a little marred by the wetness in his eyes.
It never comes. But Malfoy does. Especially loud tonight. And Harry suspects Malfoy may have surpassed his personal best on the number of syllables he puts into “Potter.”
“I thought you were supposed to be all noble and good, Potter, but if you’re going to tease me about this, then you’re clearly not as good as you–“
Harry’s confidence falters with the tables turned, but just for a second. “Well, yes, actually, I do.”
Harry replaces his glasses and looks back up at Hermione. “Since we’re the ones working the case, I don’t see why anybody else needs–”
“Draco, dear,” Narcissa Malfoy says. She’s roped up on the Ravenclaw table but in all the commotion has managed to crawl right to the edge by her son. “The manor hasn’t seen a wedding in years. Do your soon-to-be divorcee mother a favour, would you?”
Harry couldn’t stand watching any longer. He walked into the room. “Silence!” He said loudly over the racket.
Draco caught a glimpse of his reflection in the glass of the window beside him. How could he have ever left the house like this? Even his eyes looked tired. It would be
“What?” Potter asked, like he didn’t know. Like he fell through floors all the times. Like it was no big deal.
Harry is out of his bed in less than second, fully dressed (albeit over his pajamas and very haphazardly) in less than a minute and out of the common room in less than another. He runs through the corridors of Hogwarts, with only one thought – to get to Draco. Because he recognises the handwriting.  Despite it being a littler wilder in its execution, he knows it is certainly Draco’s. And he’s answering the call.
Of course, Malfoy doesn’t answer. He turns back around to Harry, searching the air, as if trying to find any trace of the cloak. “Are you going to take that thing off or will I just keep talking to myself?”
Draco laughed - not even bothering to hide it. Stuff pretences. It was November third. “That’s Scorpius.”
Harry froze, the awful blunder hitting his ears just as it came out of his mouth. He could feel himself blushing, his palms getting clammy, his knees weak. Was simply Malfoy’s presence enough to make him come undone these days?
and Harry can’t think of anything else. The words replay over and over in his head, the image of Malfoy’s smile along with them. Harry has seen Malfoy smile before, but not like this. Not
“If I hadn’t already seen the consequence of your attempt last night, I would have stormed out of here already. Just let me have my dramatic moment and go back to sleep while I wait for Hermione to come back. Please.”
His thoughts are interrupted by an imposing creak of the dormitory door and a muttered, “Bloody Hell!”
Draco looked back down at his chest. Small violet flowers grew out from the scars on his stomach, like bright muggle tattoos. Except they were moving, still growing, and expanding upwards, with tall intertwined green stems and vivid leaves.
Harry’s grateful the invisibility cloak is hiding his red face. “No, not that part. Or at least, not the you being in pain part. I didn’t mean–”
It was a game of truth or dare, but, somebody (bloody Pansy) had brought enough veritaserum for everyone. So the stakes were raised.
Malfoy had an erection. Harry could feel it against the side of his thigh. Harry tried to pull away again, this time more urgently. He felt as if he were invading Malfoy’s privacy in some way. Malfoy didn’t know all the thoughts Harry had about him. If he did, he would never have let Harry into bed with him in the first place.
“Of course I am, I’ve been waiting hours for this.” Draco tried to pull Harry in for a kiss but Harry held back.
That got a reaction. The man - Draco - pushed off the counter and stood up straight, staring down at Harry pointedly. “I’m not a moron. I know how to make coffee.”
True – Harry was pleased to wake up to the real Malfoy’s naked chest. But it left him with an inconvenient problem beneath the sheets which he couldn’t really take care of with Malfoy staring down at him like that. Well, actually, that was another fantasy of his, but he expected in this situation, Malfoy would probably just punch him, rather than join in.
And so it finally ends. Thanks for reading. Just a quick note from the author because I don't want anyone stuck in a false fantasy: as I hope this story will be interpreted: romance is NOT a cure, love and support are helpful but professional help is usually the best course of action. Be safe and look after yourself and your friends ❤ xx
“Ah,” Draco laughed - Potter was really quite skilled at getting on his noble bloody high horse. “But you seem to have already made up your mind that I have no decency. So why should I bother?”
Potter handed over the form they made all non-serious patients fill out at reception and Draco skimmed over it quickly. “You haven’t ticked any symptoms,” he observed.
Draco only pulled away when he thought his knees might give up. His light headedness had travelled to the rest of his body and he knew he didn’t have much standing left in him. Not when Potter was doing those things with his tongue.
Harry stays hidden for a cautious moment longer. He listens as Mrs. Malfoy’s footsteps reach the bottom of the stairs and he can just make out her voice as she speaks: “He’s fine, darling. If you’re worried so much, perhaps you should go to – “ Her voice fades away as she disappears further into the Manor. Harry spares a small moment for who Mrs. Malfoy is talking to – Darling? It couldn’t be Lucius out of Azkaban? – before slipping out into the corridor and retracing her footsteps to that door.
Slughorn chuckles. “Frustrating, isn’t it? I’ll give you an example, Miss Granger. Say an ingredient is best known for providing strength. When mixed with Asphodel root and given to a person to drink, what do you think is more likely? That the person will instantly grow muscles? That they will be able to lift heavy objects with no physical change to themselves? That they will be granted a stronger strength of spirit, increasing their bravery? That they will be drawn to  a soulmate that will give them strength?”
“Do you think I’m too soft?” Harry asked, sitting not behind his desk, but on the front of it, with one leg draped up like he was posing for a photo or something.
And then he ran. Which was a little awkward with the hardness in-between his legs. But he had no choice. He had to go into hiding forever. Or at the very least, until his erection died down. Which could be a while. He could still feel the way Potter’s lips, his
Potter laughed, a loud charming sound that brought Draco back to many places at once, many different November thirds. “It’s
“Two minutes?” Draco asked, his head flicking between the screen and Harry’s, as he tried to keep playing.
“Yeah…sure.” Draco watches the Doctor leave. That’s it? A favourite food? He can’t see how that’s going to get him eating again. But if it’s what the doctor orders…
“I should have expected that. And as soon as I felt him escape, I suspected - too late - it might have been you. It took me a while to get back to Hogwarts, with the floo blocked, but as soon as I did, I went to your dorm to check, and ran into Ron and Hermione. They’d noticed you’d been out of bed and thought you might be following me again, which wasn’t too far off, I guess. If Ron hadn’t had your map – which is incredible by the way – I don’t know if I would have found you soon enough.” Draco takes a shuddering breath.
Harry swears he can feel pelts of rain falling down upon his back again, despite the tall Hogwarts ceiling above them. It makes him forget where he really is, makes him forget that anyone could stumble upon them in this corridor. So he allows himself a little recklessness. Allows himself to be lost in his passion for Malfoy. And Malfoy gives as good as he receives.
“So was the Draco Malfoy who tried to kill you. If your boyfriend’s a part of me, then so is he.” Malfoy hard face drops now, the harsh lines giving way to something much sadder.  I’m not the good guy you think I am.”
laughing. And it was all a bit unsettling. Potter had never laughed like this around Draco. He had seen Potter laugh with his friends of course, but always from a distance. He’d never been close enough to really hear the sound properly, or see the lines on Potter’s face. And with the vision charm still in effect, he could see every crease line - every ripple across Potter’s face with each bout of laughter. There was something about the way Potter laughed. It was a little too relaxed. A little too free.
“A flawless plan,” Potter says, his voice one of his sarcasm, but his body language telling a different story. His shoulders have relaxed, and a sly smile has returned to his face.
There was silence for a moment. Draco already knew he didn’t have nearly enough luck for Potter to simply have left, but he had to check all the same. He lifted his head - and was out of his bed in a flash.
Draco pulled out his school jumper and tie and handed them to Potter quickly. The sooner he got away from Potter on this blasted day the better. Although he wouldn’t be surprised if Potter disappeared only to fall from the ceiling again.
“Get stuffed, Potter,” Draco responded without even looking around. “I’m not in the mood to deal with you.” Although he knew that wouldn’t be the end of it. He’d been trashing Potter’s favourite teacher’s house - it was all too likely the encounter would end in a one-handed duel. For the first time, he regretted insisting Madam Pomfrey put his arm in a sling.
“Did Harry get you all hot and bothered?” Pansy teased, such vindictive glee in her voice that Draco wondered what the hell he had ever done to her to deserve such torture.
Malfoy snorted. “You’re so naive, Potter. Voldemort might be dead but the Ministry is still crawling with pureblood influence. They’re hardly going to elect muggleborns as Ministers in the current climate. I’ve obtained the job through my family’s name with the expectation that I share the same pureblood values. I haven’t bothered to correct anyone about my true feelings on the matter and now I have an opportunity to make real change and pave the way for more deserving Ministers.” He crossed his arms. “Have I justified myself enough?”
Harry underestimates the strength of his opponent. He is thrown back to the ground, his head hitting the floor with a violent clunk. He tries to lift himself back up, but strong hands curl up around his neck, pinning him down.
Harry’s eyes flicker up to Malfoy’s face, expecting eye contact again, but Malfoy’s looking down at himself where his hand disappears under the covers. Harry lets his eyes follow Malfoy’s gaze.
Potter’s smile covered a laugh as he followed instruction and sat down - he didn’t look sick at all. “Good Afternoon, Healer Malfoy,” he said in a serious voice that only Draco could tell was mocking.
“Evening.” Draco repeats carefully. He studies Potter’s face. There’s something not quite right about it. Something different. He tries to picture Potter’s face at Hogwarts but comes up blank. What’s missing?
Draco nods and looks back down. “The spell. There’s no cure,” he explains. “They keep reopening. Severus taught me how to stop the bleeding but it’s only ever temporary.”
“An alpha?” Harry repeats. His brain is foggy from suppressing his arousal. “What are you talking about?”
“I’m – “ Harry’s eyes were on Malfoy’s exposed legs – “I’m going to –“” Malfoy wrapped a towel around his waist – “I’m –“ Malfoy reached up under the towel and – “what are you doing?”
Draco sighs. He’s wasting his limited energy deflecting but at least he’s going to make Pansy work for it. “It doesn’t matter. I’m not lying. If you – “
Harry loved it when Draco said his name like that. There was need, appreciation, affection, urgency and patience all in the one word. And Harry was more than happy to deliver. He wanted to give Draco everything, and right now that included the best fucking blowjob he’d ever received.
“You did!” Blaise clapped his hands together. He was enjoying this. “You pervert! Potter's snake tongue has got you all hot and bothered.”
When he turned around, he saw that, despite his rejection of help, the voice – a man of the same age with offensive calves and terrible hair – had followed him into the dormmroom lugging four bags at once.
The crowd blew up immediately, cheering as if the snitch had already been caught. Harry had a brief moment of disappointment when he realised Malfoy had almost certainly outdone him. But he couldn’t hold onto the feeling, not with Malfoy’s lips on his.
And worse now, Harry had convinced him to come to the Weasley’s Christmas party and then had left him alone. It enough to drive anyone up the wall. And Draco wasn’t known for being particularly patient.
Draco realised his terrible mistake. Here, Potter was in front of him, legs spread, and he’d been thinking about the floor and his white pants! What was wrong with him? Although, he did delight in Potter’s impatience. It would have been nice to hear him
Malfoy can’t know he’s here. He must be bluffing. Harry doesn’t reply and tries to remain as still as possible. He can’t do much about his breathing though.
“You have a sensitive spot beneath your left ear,” Harry said, and then immediately wished he hadn’t.
Draco was mortified - absolutely and irrevocably mortified - when his mouth, with no prior warning, moaned around Potter’s cock. Like
“After the whole school watches me destroy you at every Quidditch match this year,” Power elaborated, mimicking Draco’s smirk (except with far less style of course), “do you really think they’re going to believe you could ever beat me?”
“I don’t think the Room of Requirement is the Room of Requirement anymore,” Hermione jumps in to explain, cutting Ron off. “It appears on the map just as this room. I think the fiendfyre destroyed its power.”
Draco hadn’t actually thought that far ahead. He’d imagined that because it was November third, Potter would just be amenable to… Well, he didn’t think he’d have to work for what he was after, is all. “I just called...to check up on you. It’s been a year since your visit to St Mungo’s and protocol requires me to…to make sure you’re…healthy?” Yeah,
Despite the exciting prospect of the activities to follow, Draco was still disappointed when the dance ended. He’d have much rathered they be the last ones to leave the dance floor. But he couldn’t help Potter’s hormones, so he reluctantly (gladly) allowed Potter to lead him from the Ministry, only stopping to exchange various pleasantries with familiar faces. If they thought anything of Draco and Potter’s linked arms, they didn’t show it, which was a relief. Draco really didn’t want to explain they were leaving the ball early to fuck. It really wasn’t proper at this sort of event.
Draco laughed again - Harry seemed to draw it from Draco so easily these days. There was a time not so long ago when Draco had thought he’d never laugh again. And now, everyday Harry Potter made him feel lighter than air, as if some of the weight bearing down on him had disappeared altogether. But he knew it hadn’t. The only difference now was that Harry was sharing the load.
Malfoy smiles softly at the doors. “Draco,” he says. The smile morphs into a smirk as he turns to Harry. “But you can still call me Malfoy.”
“Reacting instinctively hmm?” Blaise repeated, his whole face alight. “That must happen quite a bit huh, Potter?” Blaise said with a painfully obvious wink, nudging Draco as he did.
“For your own conscience,” Malfoy replies, just as cryptically. “And for the Ministry. I know how they do hate complicated moralities.”
Zabini doesn’t move. He looks down at Harry with narrowed eyes. “Why would Draco be interested in a half-blood Gryffindor like you?”
The next thing Harry knows is he’s on the floor. A hard uncomfortable floor. There’s an ache in his neck and all his limps feel stiff. He’s…oh no. He wrenches open his eyes and jerks his head up. He’s still in Malfoy’s room and still no Malfoy but…but Malfoy’s bed has been slept in. Or at least, the exploding snap cards have been removed, and the covers have been thrown back. Goodness, has Harry been here all night
Draco held Harry’s eye the entire time as he slowly dropped to his knee. Right there in the lane. He didn’t even look first to check if the spot might dirty his robes. But Harry was certain he’d complain about a mark later.
Harry watched on, horrified. Not only was he forcing Malfoy to show his Dark Mark, something he had kept hidden so well no one had ever seen it, but he was also forcing him to strip to his underwear in front of the entire eighth year.
Harry lets him go, the image of the scars burnt into his brain. They didn’t seem a year old, they looked almost fresh. But there was no mistaking the pattern. Those scars were Harry’s work.
“And I hate pubs,” Draco reminds her. “Yet here we are.” He lets go of the bar to gesture dramatically with his arms, but has to quickly hold on again when he starts to sway.
Draco hadn’t turned around yet. But he would have seen Harry’s name on the appointment list. He must have known who his next patient was. Harry wondered if Draco felt that same nervous excitement to see him - the clammy palms, the fidgeting, the sweat on the back of the neck and a heart that he could hear pounding in his ears.
Draco felt the soothing tickle of Harry’s fingers skimming with impossible lightness over his stomach. Harry’s face was tightly knit in concentration, treating Draco with the absolute care. Staring at Harry, Draco felt such affection for his boyfriend. He’d never thought he’d find such beauty in the tragic mess the war had left him with. But here Harry was.
Harry sat up quickly, crossing his legs over the semi hard-on he was sporting. It appeared erections were contagious. Malfoy’s eyes followed the action and Harry couldn’t be sure whether he’d noticed or not.
Draco had been turning into a walkway he knew he’d seen before when he spotted a familiar figure shuffling towards him, in an old grey sweatshirt at least four sizes too big, and flannel pants that trailed across the floor. Oddly enough, despite the lack of audience for once, Draco experienced a bit of what could only be described as stage fright, nerves he didn’t recognise settling in his gut. It was a moment before he could work up the strength to speak.
Harry begins to stand up but stumbles over his cloak. One of his legs has manoeuvred itself outside his clock - probably while he slept -  so it takes him a moment to get himself up. He casts a tempus charm. It’s morning. And he’s going to miss breakfast. Fuck. He checks his map to make sure nobody’s outside Malfoy’s room and then goes to slip out. Except something steals his attention. A note stuck to the inside of Malfoy’s door. Harry rubs the sleep out of his eyes and readjusts his glasses so he can read it properly.
Malfoy doesn’t answer. Harry wonders whether Malfoy is still watching him but he’s too scared to check.
“Thanks,” Potter mumbled, clutching at the material loosely. He didn’t seem as aware as he had been earlier.
“No,” Draco said immediately, “that can’t be it. I’ve made every soulmate potion twice over, I’ve wanted him for as long as I can remember. If I could choose him, I would. He’s the one with another soulmate.”
“We’re in the locker room, Potter,” Malfoy said, letting his underwear drop to the floor, the towel thankfully covering everything. “I’m preparing for a shower. I’m rather sweaty after beating you.”
, this was Harry Potter. Harry Potter’s tongue on Draco Malfoy’s dick. After years of fighting and, at least on Draco’s part, pining, they had come to this. And Potter had initiated it. A good deal of Draco’s arousal stemmed from just the thought that Harry Potter
“My roommate, Potter, he’ll be back any moment. He’s a big, buff, scary guy.” (It could’ve been true.) “I think he’s on the football team. I wouldn’t want to cross him.”
For a moment it looks like Potter might still leave, but then his shoulders slump and he finally meets Draco’s eye. “Fine. But you can’t say anything about this. Ever. I’m not going to talk about it.” He returns to his seat, the remnants of a blush still showing on his face.
However, the next time they saw each other, when Draco dropped Teddy back off at Harry’s office Friday afternoon, Harry’s curiosity got the better of him.
“I think they suit you.” Only after he says it does Harry realise his counter sounds like less of a argument and more like–
Draco turned around then, his face showing no surprise at Harry Potter sitting in his Healer’s office. “You accidentally cursed yourself,” he repeated drily.
“Mmmmm.” Potter’s reply wasn’t particularly descriptive but it gave Draco his answer all the same. All at once he realised the power he had.
Malfoy shrugs. “No, Potter, I’m dead serious,” he says tonelessly. Harry has no idea what to make of it.
Draco suddenly understood what Harry meant. He couldn’t answer fast enough. “Yes, I’m into that. Potter, I am
Although when Malfoy excuses himself and strides past Harry to the door, there’s no mistaking the lustful stare directed Harry’s way, or the smell of Malfoy’s arousal. The smell? What the fuck.
Kingsley doesn’t even look up from the file he’s reading. “I couldn’t stop them taking it even if I wanted to.”
It wasn’t until he was halfway up the street that he finally looked down at the coffee. Draco had crafted something into the foam, or at least tried to - it was very shaky artwork, but Harry could tell what it was all the same. There in the centre of Harry’s coffee, Draco had left a tiny heart.
Harry looks back to Malfoy who has lost the advantage with his two opponents. One holds his arms behind his back while the other holds onto his hair, jerking his head to the side and– shit. He’s going to
“Right.” Harry studies the table very closely, every inch of the skin visible on his face and neck a dark red. “Look, Malfoy don’t take this the wrong way because if I’d known it was just dinner, I still would have come, but now that I’ve…well I’m very embarrassed to be honest, so I think I should probably go.” He stands up, eyes still determinedly avoiding Draco.
Hermione makes eye contact with Harry and he tries not to let anything show in his face. “I think he already has.”
But Ron and Hermione aren’t so keen to let him out of their sight after his previous disappearance for an entire night. “I understand you want to find out what’s going on with Malfoy but stalking him again is unhealthy,” Hermione had told him. Ron hadn’t said anything but Harry could tell he silently agreed. But he’s not stalking Malfoy. He’s just searching for the truth, and if the best way is to tail Malfoy…then so be it.
“Sorry...Malfoy. It’s just you weren’t responding when I called you…I didn’t mean to be so loud. I was just asking if you wanted a drink?”
Potter’s smirk finally stretches across his entire face, although perhaps that’s just his smile. It’s quite dazzling when it’s directed right at you, Draco decides. “Malfoy, you wouldn’t be flirting with me, would you?”
Not to mention, the thought of sleeping with – well, sleeping next to – Malfoy was all kinds appealing. Scary, and awkward and embarrassing of course. But very appealing.
Before Draco can continue the imaginary conversation in his head, Potter reaches him at the table. This time Draco recognises Potter is without his glasses. It doesn’t suit him at all.
Harry laughed, surprised that the sound had been elicited by Draco of all people. His once sworn enemy. “If I had Veritaserum, I wouldn’t have to know what I wanted to say, it would just come out.”
Harry wasn’t brave enough to say it, but it’s all he could think of. His mind had been wiped clean of every possible dare under Malfoy’s gaze.
Harry wants to curse but he has no choice but to remain silent. How could he be so stupid as to add asphodel root without knowing what it would do? He had read that it enhanced the properties of other ingredients and didn’t bother to look into it further. If he had, then Malfoy wouldn’t be in this situation.
Draco looked down at his chest. He’d forgotten it said Potter in smaller print on the front too. He scrambled frantically for his next defence. “I was cold?” he tried.
It’s barely past 8pm, but Harry obeys, heading down to the lower levels of cells. Travers is already there, smiling much too widely as he surveils the masterminds behind the conspiracy. They’d intended to use the Wolfsbane to maintain their mental state while in wolf form so they could intentionally attack the Ministry. The other hundred or so werewolves, recruited only in their desperation for Wolfsbane, were offered amnesty – a condition Malfoy carefully devised the wording for to ensure there were no loopholes Travers could exploit.
Harry wasn’t quite sure how to act around Draco anymore. Things had changed between them. Not only did he know that Draco was discussing the thought of having sex with him with Pansy, but he’d also had a taste of their older arguments, and the supercharged feeling that came with them. He wanted more.
Of course, Harry became suspicious. Perhaps he was also hurt that Draco dismissed his attempts at conversation most nights, in favour of sleeping. Regardless, he was probing. And Draco didn’t know how much longer he could keep up the façade.
Draco rolls his eyes. Honestly. This man is supposed to be brave. “We’re happy with the wine,” Draco says to the waiter to be clear. “Thank you.”
One last time, he told himself. But once again, his hands closed over nothing, the wings of the snitch just grazing his fingers, always out of reach.
Harry clears his throat. “It’s…um…healed,” he says to fill the silence, although he wishes he can take the words back when he hears them aloud.
“They might hear,” he whispers through gritted teeth, his eyes flashing wildly. He drops his hand and turns back around, heading for the door from which Harry arrived.
Luck was on Draco’s side it would seem - it was November third after all - as Potter hadn’t moved further than slumping to the floor of the corridor, his head still resting against the wall.
Draco certainly wasn’t the only one in the office charmed by Harry. He’d noticed some of the other aurors staring too - during the rare moments when he could pull his eyes away from Harry. And it wasn’t just Harry’s looks. If it were just that, Draco would have gotten over it years ago. No, Harry had to be brave too. And powerful. And a little wild. And above all, kind.
The loud Weasley chatter around the yard had quieted. Everything was still. It seemed everyone was watching Harry and Draco.
Potter does not seem discouraged by this. If anything, it spurns him on further. “You’re the one who seems to be getting ideas,” he replies. “I’m only planning on cooking you dinner. Just dinner. Playing with your balls is completely optional.”
He looked back up to Malfoy, searching for any sign he might have seen. Nothing. But that hardly meant much. Harry suspected Malfoy’s emotions didn’t play so obviously on his face anymore. He nodded in what he hoped was a professional courteous manner. "Dralfoy."
About today. I didn’t expect to see you in muggle London. Please don’t take my actions as indicative of my feelings. I was just surprised.
By the time Draco found his wand on the bedside table beside him - courtesy of Potter he could only imagine -  and cast a tempus charm, it was already 12.01am. It was November
Draco suddenly worried that perhaps he had been giving off some terrible (even though accurate) signals, by allowing Potter to stargaze with him. It was oddly friendly and even, romantic. And he couldn’t have Potter getting the wrong idea.
Draco scanned the room as an excuse not to meet Potter’s eye. “Well, I certainly hope so. You were on duty this morning. If you were just standing around doing nothing, then I can only imagine the fate of your patients.”
“Potter, do you know how expensive these robes are?” Draco saw Potter start to pull out his wand (his actual wand, no euphemism here). “No magic either. You might ruin the fabric.”
“Your hair’s long,” Potter pointed out with all the conversational skills of a seven year old. Draco was about to tell Potter exactly that when he added, “Just so you can’t call me unobservant again,” with a playful wink.
“Granger, Potter,” Kingsley greets formally as they enter (read: barge into) his office. He gestures to the man standing by his desk. “You know Travers?
Draco jerked his head over to Minister Jones, eyes widening. He had almost ignored the Minister for Magic. “Of course,” he said smoothly, despite the fresh bead of sweat that rolled down the back of his neck, “What a pleasure to meet you, Minister Jones.” He held out Potter’s Champagne glass. “Can I offer you a drink?”
“Take a seat,” Kingsley says. When Harry no longer stands over him and they are at eye level, he continues.  “We don’t know anything yet. We’ve received a tip-off that Mr. Malfoy is conspiring with werewolves to launch a coordinated attack on the Ministry of Magic. I’ve–”
“Not one more word, Potter!” Draco went for his wand instinctively, his arm jerking his sling open as he reached for - the sling! Shit. He froze, realising what he’d done, and looked up to gauge Potter’s reaction.
“Draco Malfoy,” he says loudly in case Draco’s ears are ringing too. “I love you.” And then he kisses him.
“You don’t know what you’re saying, Alex,” she says after a quick drag. “Where else are you going to go? Back to your folks?”
Harry cleared his throat. “You heard the Professor. Pepperup Potion. Get to it.” He made to leave, but Malfoy stopped him, an arm on his elbow.
He opened up his Potions textbook and considered playing noughts and crosses with himself before sighing and flicking over to chapter seventeen to read up on the brewing process of Veritaserum. Apparently, it wasn't enough to make the potion, they had also been assigned to write an entire essay on the method before even attempting it in class. To make the whole thing even more unappealing, they weren’t even allowed to keep the potions once they were completed. Harry could do with some Veritaserum, he thought. He’d chug a whole flask, take a walk around Hogwarts and finally tell everyone what he really thought. “If only,” he whispered to himself.
After dinner, Draco suggested a walk which Harry thought nothing of. It was not long after 10pm. The proposal was still some time off.
“Mr Malfoy, where’s Mr Potter?” Draco, looked up at Professor Flitwick’s voice, his face immediately flushing.
“I thought that’s how you liked it.” Draco countered. Pansy was a bit of a heartbreaker although, to be fair, she always made her intentions clear – dinner and sex, no numbers, no breakfast.
Harry shivered and Draco knew he had won. “Fine, but I’m going to appoint a supervisor to monitor your work so that you no longer report directly to me. And if you ever feel like I’m treating you - “
“I’m not– I don’t hate you,” Harry quickly corrected. He didn’t see how Draco had come to such an absurd, and completely contrary, conclusion from his letter. “Didn’t you read it?”
“Work ran late,” Potter says, running a hand through his damp hair as he walks into the room. “I wanted to get here earlier to see you.”
Draco rolls his eyes. Pansy can be dramatic if she likes. Draco’s only being practical. Potter has a life outside of him. Everybody does. Including Pansy. Actually – “You shouldn’t be flooing so often. Especially all the way to Portugal and back. Too much long distance floo exposure is dangerous.”
An unconscious splutter emerges from Draco’s mouth. He looks up to a smiling Potter and can’t help but smile in return. Which turns into a grin. Which turns into a laugh they both share. Which only gets louder the longer Draco stares at Potter. Potter’s smile, his laugh, is infectious.
“That’s what I would have done,” Harry responded when he realised he’d been staring at Draco for too long.
Malfoy laughed and dropped his hands. “Calm down, Potter. I’m only teasing. Not until the second date, remember? Tonight we talk. And eat. How do you feel about soup? It’s the only thing I can cook.”
Falling back onto a bed sideways mid-kiss was not as glamorous as movies had made it look. The sharp edge of the mattress dug into Harry’s back and Draco’s body hit him in the chest hard enough to wind him momentarily. Even worse, their lips had dislodged during the fall which Harry was not too happy about. He shuffled himself up the bed, righting the angle and bringing Draco with him. Harry kept shuffling until Draco’s body seemed to slip in place on top of him, his legs around Harry’s and – yes, there it was – his erection pressing against Harry’s own.
He moves further along the corridor slowly, unsure of his next move. It would take ages to search the Manor for Draco. The place is huge. Harry racks his brain trying to think of a helpful spell. If only Hermione were here. She’d know the right spell for sure.
Harry drops back against his chair dejected, realising he isn't going to get any information from Slughorn either. “Isn’t there anything I can do to help?” He asks, feeling incredibly helpless.
They’re both breathing heavily, snapping at each other as if it were foreplay. No, Harry has to get a hold of himself. His brain is filling his thoughts with all sorts of arousing images and Malfoy’s proximity is not helping in the slightest. Where had this all come from?
Hermione opens the file. Harry’s already added untidy notes in the margins. She hates when he does that. She keeps reminding him to use sticky notes instead.
Draco panics, unsure how to reply to such a direct request. He wants to say yes, he’d love there to be a next time, but he doesn’t have the courage. So instead: “I’m a terrible cook.”
“I - I didn’t think you’d know,” Draco covered up the tremble in his voice with a quick cough. “I’m not sure actually. I can’t see it tonight.”
A short humourless laugh escapes from Harry’s mouth. Draco was always good at picking fights where there was none. “I believe.”
Harry saw something in Malfoy’s eyes that gave him the confidence to be upfront about it. Playing coy was their teenage game. “Yes,” he said simply.
Harry looked the man up and down. The phrase ‘fish out of water’ came to mind…“He doesn’t look like he needs a job.”
Still, there was a thrill in having an arch rival. Someone to scowl at across the breakfast table. Someone to try out new hexes on. Someone to compete with. And someone to fight.
fault Malfoy and his boyfriend, Zabini, seem to think it’s okay to snog and walk at the same time with their eyes closed. It’s
Draco blinked back at Potter as his hands closed over the pin. He should have been angry at the audacity of Potter to comment on his family, but he couldn’t work up the energy for a fight. So he just took his family crest back from Potter’s hand silently, an automatic thank you dying before it reached his lips.
Potter turned back to Draco and fixed him with a look of determination. It was the same face he wore when duelling and the fact he was wearing it now, to give Draco a hickey, was a little arousing. No, who was Draco kidding? It was incredibly arousing. And still, Potter hadn’t touched him.
Zabini’s grip falls away, and Harry collapses onto the floor, his head a little dizzy from being held so tightly. He readjusts his glasses and slowly gets up, trying to put some distance between himself and Zabini. He ends up next to Malfoy.
Harry was gentle and patient and more likely to start speaking in fluent French than to ever push Draco’s boundaries. The pressure to explain came from Draco’s mind alone.
Potter laughed loudly, his mouth too close to Draco’s ear. “No, of course not.” Potter leaned in closer and Draco made the mistake of looking up. “Malfoy,” Potter said, in an unnecessary whisper, “why are you wearing my jersey?”
Harry’s eyes flicker open, his brain whirls to life. It’s dark. Why is he awake? He hears it again. A soft hooting right at his ear. He jumps up and stares at the small owl by his bed. It hoots again and offers out its leg with a small piece of parchment attached. Harry takes it curiously and reads the note, pausing only to wipe the sleep from his eyes.
Harry stands up, meaning to go after her but before he can, a flying memo enters their office. Harry snatches it from the air before it can land on Hermione’s desk. It struggles in his hand for a moment but gives up easily with its intended destination so close.
. Has Malfoy lost something? A part of himself? But then on top of that: “There’s got to be a reason why he needs to sleep at Malfoy Manor.” Harry voices his thought aloud.
“Oh really?” Potter whispered in Draco’s ear, his hands dropping to Draco’s briefs, toying with the waistband. “Not even these?”
Potter didn’t like that. He pushed his mug away with more force than strictly necessary. “You’re a real asshole, you know?”
Malfoy’s lips twitched. He looked around the room and then returned his eyes to Harry. “Why don’t you want to kiss me?”
“I’m not touching my cock!” Draco yelled out defensively, forgetting he was supposed to be pretending he wasn’t listening. Oh, fuck it all anyway. The bastard knew. He
Everything comes back into focus at once. Potter’s hand resting on his back through the polished wooden slats that make up the chair’s back. Potter’s face in front of his. And Potter’s voice in his ear, urgent and breathy. “Are you alright?”
The Manor’s entrance door opens, and Draco Malfoy strides out, fully dressed as if it were a reasonable hour and not 5am in the morning. There is no sign of a guest. He stops at the entry stairs, looking over the lawn with narrowed eyes, his wand raised.
‘Ron!” Hermione half yells, half whispers. They have moved down to the common room but there is still a chance their voices might carry up to the dormitories. “This is serious. Slughorn said Malfoy was dangerous.”
That night, after dinner in the Great Hall - during which Potter never even looked at him (Draco could tell because he was staring almost the entire time) - Draco figured he’d return to his dormitory to find Potter sitting on his bed or something equally as ridiculous.
“Oh, yes. Probably. I mean, almost definitely,” Ron says hurriedly, while Harry tries not think about his earlier suspicions again. “But I’m sure she wouldn’t mind us waking her for this.”
Ron doesn’t reply for a moment. The room is still and Harry starts to think maybe Ron is asleep until: “Why are you worried about him?” Ron asks slowly. His voice is measured and Harry can tell his friend is trying to remain calm for his sake.
Tonight, the moonlight is so bright, the Black Lake paints a perfect reflection of the sky. Stars frame the moon, muted in its dominating presence. Harry understands the feeling.
Potter was right of course. Draco had only been wearing his briefs when he called but Potter wasn’t supposed to
Malfoy doesn’t answer verbally, but he gives a clear indication of his feelings towards the suggestion, when he pulls Harry in for a frenzied kiss.
Harry presented the coffee to their first customer, a man who showed the signs of creeping impatience. Harry put on his best smile as he handed over the cup. “I’m deeply sorry for the wait, sir. I hope you have a great day.”
Before Harry even adds the next drop of dittany, Malfoy lets out another strangled sound that Harry isn’t convinced is from any pain. Harry runs his hand over the same scar again just so he can hear that noise once more.
“He left one of his - “ Draco felt the coldness of the room as his dick was exposed - “uh-uh-uh books in his dorm, Professor. He’ll be back - “ and there it was, no hesitation, Potter’s tongue - “s-s-s-s-soon.”
He starts to feel an itching in his legs, not the kind you can scratch away, but the kind that makes you fidgety and restless, the kind that causes Draco to cross, uncross and then recross his legs again in an endless pattern. He’s waited long enough.
“So,” Harry started, dropping to a whisper when he sensed company behind him, “you don’t feel the same?”
“Good for you,” Harry says tonelessly, handing over the vials to Travers, and turning to leave. They may have reached an agreement but Harry still can’t stand the bloke.
He’s right. Draco hates pubs. He makes exceptions for Pansy because she’s Pansy. But on any other occasion, he would not be caught dead in a pub. But Draco needs to draw attention away from his slip up of unconcealed desperation so he tries to make Potter sweat. “And what’s my type of place, exactly?” He asks, his tone accusatory.
“Right,” Harry agrees, getting to his feet. He isn’t likely to get anything more off the Professor anyway.  “Can you let me know once you’ve cured him?”
Too late, Harry realised he’d been given the perfect opportunity to escape, but he’d been as enraptured in Draco’s performance as Teddy. “I’m leaving now.”
Malfoy pauses for a moment, staring at Harry, as if he can’t understand the question. He looks back into the fire. “A lot of things,” he says darkly, “but I thought you, of all people, might understand. I thought you knew that the law isn’t always right. That breaking the rules can sometimes be the right thing.”
you?” Hermione’s panicked voice cuts through his temporary peace. He turns to find her and Ron hurrying towards him, wands raised.
Draco knew he didn’t have to seek out Potter - that he would come to him by the end of the day regardless of Draco’s actions. Fourth year had pretty much proved that. But the waiting! It was impossible. And Draco had one terrible thought he didn’t dare let stay in his head for more than one fleeting second at a time. What if Harry Potter was dead?
It was a dream. That’s all it was. But Harry’s body doesn’t seem to understand that. Harry’s body seems to think he and Malfoy’s body have some catching up to do. Which is utterly ridiculous.
“Hmm. Since doxy eggs are utilised for their sense of clarity and often used in potions to improve –“ Slughorn pauses and his eyes dart around the room quickly before returning to Hermione. “Why do you wish to know about this ingredient, Miss Granger?”
Draco doesn’t seem surprised. “Harry Potter, always the noble one,” he says lightly as he wipes the remaining tears from his face. He looks back out across the Great Lake to the light breaching the horizon. He turns to Harry, a small smile growing on his face. “Before I go, perhaps we can watch the sunrise together?”
Harry isn’t fond of waiting. Back at the Ministry of Magic, he paces the office he shares with Hermione, passing his wand from one hand to the other, while Hermione calmly completes paperwork with a steady hand.
Malfoy laughed and Harry didn’t particularly blame him – Harry was acting like a fumbling fool. He was making this too easy for Malfoy. “I didn’t realise we were in kindergarten. You’re a grown man, Potter. Just accept you lost fair and –
With that, Hermione left, her footsteps fading away on the hospital wing floor. Only when her footsteps had completely disappeared did Draco remember to say, “Thank you.”
“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, Narcissa,” McGonagall says coldly. “We were talking about what Harry deserves, not you.”
“My friends kind of paired off and I felt a bit awkward so I left,” Potter said. “Plus the game tomorrow. I probably shouldn’t have drunk at– ”
Draco. Again. Draco wasted no more time reading into it further, and took his opportunity, jumping to his feet and turning around in the same motion to hide his crotch from the room.
Draco slumped back – he had somehow found himself at the very tip of his seat, leaning into the pitch. His heart pounded against his chest, as if it wished to escape.
He picked it up with an irritated sigh (so Potter would know how much of an inconvenience it was for him) and reluctantly read Potter’s scribbled note. He snorted. The note had one word:
The room was silent - for once - as everyone waited to see how Potter would respond. He could always say no. Pansy had made it clear at the start of the game that anyone could, and should feel free to leave at any time without any repercussions. The veritaserum had been optional too, but no one wanted to be the only one who refused -
It’s Pansy Parkinson who replies. “No, of course not! He’s in the Hospital wing thanks to you. He’s going to have to–”
Potter leads him back into the grand dining hall and gestures for Draco to take a seat at the very end of the table. Potter obviously doesn’t understand the significance of this. The ends of the table are reserved for the masters of the house. He is about to point this out until he remembers his silent promise to tread carefully. Lecturing Potter on pureblood table manners probably isn’t the best way to make a friend out of him. So instead he sits quietly, like a courteous guest.
“Fine,” Ron agrees, but he pouts, sullen at the deal. He kicks off the wall and drops his hands in his pockets. “Good luck.”
The combination of the snitch and finding himself alone with Potter, drew up a memory of the previous year, one Draco thought he had successfully erased from his head. But no, the faint sound of Potter’s laughter rang in his ears once more. Draco fought hard not to enjoy it.
“I'll see you tomorrow, then,” Potter said, his face just as aflame as Draco’s. “Our next Quidditch meet,” he explained when Draco remained silent.
“Every side is your bloody good side,” Draco muttered to himself without thinking. Crap. There’s no way Potter hadn’t heard THAT embarrassing revelation.
Draco felt eyes on them as they moved towards the dance floor. Which made sense - they were the two most attractive people in the room of course, what with Draco’s fine robes, and Potter’s - well, Potter’s everything. But self-doubt grew from the back of Draco’s mind - what if people thought he wasn’t good enough for Potter? What if
Harry hesitated, the unexpected words pulling him from his focus, just for a second, but it was enough. The snitch disappeared. His fingers closed, a second too late, over air.
“You want me to keep visiting?” Harry asks, already ignoring the no questions rule. As curious as he finds the mystery of Malfoy’s condition, the thought that Malfoy might enjoy spending time with Harry is even more so.
Harry is thrown. Both by the use of his first name again, and Malfoy’s calm attitude. Malfoy should be angry. He should have his wand out. He should be smirking and insulting Harry. Not this. Anything but this.
Draco scanned the sky, searching for the constellation he had seen so many times before. “Not usually.”
Draco looked up at Harry watching him, and got to his feet a little clumsily, holding onto the bed for support. He smiled lazily. “You’re still here.”
“I don’t think that’s quite what you had in mind though, is it?” Harry said. He spoke cooly, but Draco could sense those eyes burning into Draco’s hands where they fumbled over the buttons in his trousers. He yanked his underpants down alongside his trousers - he wasn’t going to delay any further with a slow strip tease. There were plenty of other opportunities for that.
Malfoy and Zabini leave lunch early for afternoon classes, and Harry is standing up and following them before his brain catches up to what his body is doing.
Draco smiled properly then. It was teasing, but not in a cruel way. It was the kind of way that made Harry feel like he was in on the joke. “You want everyone to know that you
“I thought you’d like that,” Potter said, his voice a little raspier than before. Oh my gosh, was this Potter’s
Harry pulled his hands out, and pretended to start getting up. “Well, if I’m already warmed up, I guess there’s no point - “
. The word rang in Draco’s ears. He couldn’t help his lips from curling into a smile. “I don’t think that would be appropriate at work,” he said, maintaining some of his cool.
Potter dropped his wand and returned to the buttons. “Who knew you were such a muggle,” he said as he worked on Draco’s crotch (the buttons at his crotch, that is).
Potter heard. The bastard actually laughed. Draco was on his knees, giving him a (life-changing) blowjob, and Potter had the audacity to
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco said, placing himself gently on the ground in front of Potter’s chair, thinking the action would do just that - shut him up. It didn’t.
That was something then - at least he hadn’t been too obvious. Not like Potter, the raging hormonal man. ’Don’t worry, I’ve got you pegged.”
Harry’s eyes fell to the letter, remembering its content. None of it could explain Malfoy’s reaction. “No?”
Harry found himself thinking of that now as he stared at Draco sleeping beside him. Only there was no sunlight. There didn’t need to be. Draco radiated a light all on his own. And there was no epiphany for Harry either. No realisation. Only confirmation he had made the right choice.
“He has a soft side too,” Malfoy says, looking up now, his eyes innocent enough to almost convince Harry.
“I’m not leaving without answers,” Harry asserts, although his delivery is a little marred by the fact he can’t even say it to Malfoy’s face. Merlin. What is wrong with him? Why can’t he just lift his head?
Potter. There was a distinct difference. Still, Pansy might be some help if he kept it as vague as possible. “How many times does something need to happen for it not to be coincidence?”
Professor Slughorn’s voice is soft and distant. “You three should get to bed. I’ll let your Professors know you’ve been given the day off. And I’m sure I don’t have to say this, but please keep this to yourselves. It wouldn’t reflect well on the school or…“ Harry looks up at the pause to catch Slughorn’s gaze on him. He clears his throat and continues. “Besides, Mr. Malfoy is cured now so no harm, no foul, right?”
“You don’t need to help me out of any moral obligation. I know you feel bad about the Dunbergs. You don’t need to prove it by becoming my personal defender. Seems like an awful waste of the great Harry Potter’s time.”
Finally able to breathe, Harry focuses on Transfiguration and forgets about Malfoy. He takes his notes as usual, sneaking glances at Hermione’s every so often, and chatting with Ron whenever they can get away with it.
Hermione returned with Ronald and took Potter away, whispers out of reach of Draco’s ears. So much for becoming friends, Draco was sure they’d hate him now for upsetting Potter. Draco hated himself too, the only difference was, it was incredibly hard to avoid one’s self.
Draco takes a bite of the pub’s supposed famous burger and muffles a retch. It’s horrible, but Pansy is watching him closely so he forces himself to swallow. It feels like a bowling ball squeezing its way down his throat. Draco wonders whether it might be worth sacrificing his head instead.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow. “Of course. Verity–” a woman appears at Malfoy’s side immediately “–please take Mr. Potter’s coat and show him to the sitting room.”
“You look wonderful,” Harry chimed in smoothly (stealing Draco’s line). “You have nothing to worry about.”
“He never touched me like this,” Draco said, his voice automatically dropping to a whisper in response. Blaise had been passionate but he was hard and fast. There never seemed to be any time for caresses like this or even just eye contact. Potter’s bright eyes
Draco, staring at him. He can’t bring himself to speak so he nods. No further encouragement needed, and without waiting for Harry, Draco strides off down the corridor, ignoring the other Draco, the other Malfoy, on the floor.
– with his girlfriend and spend the night in her dorm, but he’s worried about his snoring. We– he– I– thought you might be able to brew a potion for it.”
Draco stared at Potter’s sleeping face, enraptured by the peacefulness of it. He couldn’t look away. Potter was wonderful and charming and noble and hot as fucking hell. It was impossible, but Draco wanted to keep him forever.
“She is not!” Harry laughs because the idea is so ridiculous. Ron and Hermione are the most revolting lovey-dovey couple Hogwarts has likely ever seen. They’re always holding hands, even beneath the table during classes, and their public snogs are infamous.
“And I’m sure Narcissa Malfoy will enjoy a visit from the person who put her husband away,” Hermione says.
“I have reason to believe you’re involved in a conspiracy against the Ministry of Magic,” Harry says, trying to maintain a professional tone. He’s not here to get into it with a childhood rival, however much Malfoy’s prickliness provokes him.
Draco fell back into bed. “Fuck you, Potter.” Was November Third here to make him feel like shit? Because if so, it was doing a great job.
And sure enough, when they both started to pant - they weren’t as young as they used to be - Draco slowed down and let Harry catch him, pulling him onto the couch, or perhaps collapsing and rolling onto the couch. Either way, Harry ended up lying on top of Draco, hands sneaking back up his sweater again.
Malfoy dropped his head without another word, and he, Percy, and Mr Weasley quickly exited via the fireplace, leaving a scattering of floo powder behind them. Harry watched as the pieces were picked up by a slight breeze coming in from an open kitchen window.
“I believe that, Potter. I’ll always believe that of your intentions. But it doesn’t change the fact that you’re naïve and you’re wrong.”
Harry looks back up to Malfoy whose eyes are flicking between the bottle and Harry warily. When Harry takes a step forward, Malfoy flinches. He pauses for a moment and moves slowly now, approaching Malfoy as if he were a hippogriff. He walks around to Malfoy’s back (all the while Malfoy’s eyes follow him) and takes in the worst of the damage. The scratches trail all the way down to the small of Malfoy’s back, red and angry and clearly more painful than Malfoy has been letting on.
He flew casually in the direction of the snitch at first so as not to alert Potter, keeping one eye trained on its movements. When he was comfortable with Potter’s distance - which wasn’t until Potter had floated to the complete opposite side of the pitch - Draco sped up to full speed and easily snatched the snitch in a single outstretched hand before Potter could even look up. It was all too easy. Draco felt none of the adrenaline that usually coursed through him after playing Quidditch. He felt nothing at all, really.
Harry knew he shouldn’t, that he was overstepping, but the thought of Draco dating had thrown him and he itched to know more. He hadn’t known Draco to date anyone. Not that he was keeping track. But surely he would have heard.
“Okay,” Harry said simply, and Draco knew he meant it. That Harry would not push the subject ever again out of respect for Draco’s wishes.
“Apparently it’s tricky.” Harry nods at the clear floor as Malfoy’s wand lowers. “You’re good at tricky.”
“Of course, Auror Potter,” Malfoy interrupts, cutting Harry short of yelling. “Forgive me, I was just trying to get a rise out of you.” He smirks. “I succeeded.”
“Yes, and part of the investigative process is to question suspects, so, Malfoy, what are you doing here?”
“We’ve been wandering the fourth floor all afternoon trying to find you mate,” Ron explains, looking sheepish as he lowers his wand.
There’s a scraping of a chair and Harry quickly hurries backwards, pulling out his invisibility cloak as he does. He just manages to cover himself completely when Madam Pomfrey emerges. She strides past him without a glance.
Again?” Malfoy’s face looks a little paler than usual. “Potter, I swear to Merlin, I feel like I might die if you do that one more time.” He eyes the dittany bottle again.
“What?” Zabini asks. Harry quickly slides a hand into the pocket of his robe. In his confusion, Zabini doesn’t seem to notice.
There was something sweet about it. And as red as he was with Potter staring at him for so long, he couldn’t help but revel in the shared look, like it meant more than a look. Like there was something passing between them as they danced. Which was silly. And romantic. And entirely ridiculous. But Draco felt it all the same.
Draco shrugged. “It was just a hypothetical.” He lifted his champagne glass to take a sip nonchalantly before remembering it was still empty and dropping his arm awkwardly.
New heat flooded Harry’s face. He’d made it without thinking – if he’d given any real thought to it, he would never have planned to present Malfoy a cupcake decorated with a green snake coiled around a small red heart. “It’s not– ” he tried to explain– “it doesn’t mean any– ”
Harry didn’t have any time to consider his answer before the Veritaserum was speaking for him. “Because I’m worried you’ll dare me to kiss Malfoy.”
And just when he thought things couldn't get worse, Harry, not quite sure how much longer he’d be able to stand for, slumped back into his seat - or at least attempted to – but misjudged the position and ended up plummeting to the floor instead.
Draco took a step out from the bookshelf and the faintest smile flickered across his face. “Is Harry Potter a liar?” He asked.
Sure enough, someone at Hogwarts, over the years, has stored a sharp butcher’s knife in the Room of Requirement. Harry hears it whizzing towards them before it reaches their corridor and zooms into Malfoy’s hand. There’s a dark stain from the tip to the hilt, and Harry decides not to ponder the substance, lest he feel sicker than he does already.
you,” Draco stumbled over his words, trying to defend himself. The room had suddenly grown very hot. Their dancing had become more of an awkward shuffle that was more standing still than it was movement.
At last he reaches Malfoy’s dorm. The door is locked. Of course. It was never going to be that easy. Harry pulls out his wand and whispers an unenthusiastic “Alohomora”. It works
“Harry, I truly am sorry, but in my defence, you did suggest we ‘hang out for dinner’ and that I could ‘invite anyone I wanted.’”
Although they aren’t getting many words out of Mrs Dunberg, Harry isn’t concerned. He doesn’t need them for this next question – any giveaway of the face will be enough. He leans forward. “Do you or your husband know Draco Malfoy?”
Harry blinked. Saying what they meant was clearly far superior to small talk. Why had they wasted so much time?
At the thought of Potter coming in the position they were in, Draco was reminded of their phone call the previous year. He’d been so humiliated by all the things he had said but here, now, with the same horniness in possession of his mind, Draco thought that perhaps they’d had some great ideas that night. And Draco hadn’t forgotten that Potter had wanted to come on him. That had starred in plenty of following masturbation fantasies. And right now, it seemed like the fantasy might actually come true.
“Or I could stay here all day,” Potter suggested with faux sweetness. He really was more cunning than people gave him credit for.
Potter’s face twitched, a little bit of life streaming back into it. “Enjoy it, because it’s the only day you’ll ever get to say that about.”
“Charming,” retorted Harry. The offer wasn’t particularly convincing. He had known the text was too good to be true. He made to turn away.
Potter sat up straight in his chair, staring up at Draco where he stood, but somehow making Draco feel as if he were the shorter one of the two. “My
Draco wants to roll his eyes. He wants to shrug with a casual air of indifference. He wants to turn back around. But on seeing his mother’s face light up so immediately at his presence at the door, he can’t quite manage it. He lets himself be pulled into a hug with only a “No need to fret, Mother,” in his defence.
Potter didn’t look surprised but worse, he just looked unimpressed. He crossed his arms and stared at Draco with that one static look that made Draco want to fall inside himself and disappear. Draco couldn’t move - not even to return his arm back into the sling. Any move he made would be too telling under Potter’s eye. Why couldn’t Potter just stop staring already?
Potter’s eyebrows have a little party on his face before deciding to drop dangerously close to his eyes. “Why won’t you let me take you to hospital?” He asks, but it’s gentle. Of course it’s gentle. It’s Harry fucking Potter. Saviour of the Wizarding World and now he’s here to save Draco.
Potter blinked back at Draco for a moment. Everyone else was staring at Draco too. He was the first to choose truth. And he knew why. The risk of revealing something humiliating under veritaserum was too high. Truth was
Draco ignored her. “I just need to prove the date has no significance is all. Just one day without contact and then I can put this to bed once and for all.”
Draco looked down where the jersey had landed in his lap, Potter’s name in big capital letters. Only the football players’ partners wore their jerseys. Everyone knew that. They all sat together right behind the players' bench, leaning over the rails to steals kisses at halftime. If Draco turned up to a college game wearing Potter’s jersey, no one would ever believe they were just dormmates. Potter knew that.
But why couldn’t you just let me have this? Just one silly desperate hope to cling onto. That’s all I–“
Before Harry can query this, Malfoy is already striding away, shaking the dried-up mud off his robes.
“I certainly would have dressed differently if I’d known. You wouldn’t see me like this until at least the second date.”
Harry nods. He does respect his boss, undoubtedly, but he’s fond of breaking the rules to suit his own purpose, and he’s used to getting away with it. Kingsley
Still, he didn’t want to lose. His pride was at stake. If he had to play dirty to have any slight chance at winning, then he was very willing to do so. Although he had to be careful. Being caught cheating would be even more humiliating than just losing - Potter would know that Draco thought him to be the better player.
“Mother.” Draco interrupts preparing himself to jump into the fray. It’s now or never. “Will you come with me to the hospital?”
But Malfoy’s quicker. His hands reach out and yank Harry’s head towards him, crashing their mouths together before Harry even knows what’s happening. It’s like the Quidditch pitch all over again, but this time there’s no gentle lead in, just Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy clinging onto each other in wild desperation, lips moving in perfect jagged time.
Pansy mimes banging her head on the table, something she likes to do to show Draco when she thinks he’s being particularly infuriating. “Then
So, Harry devises an airtight plan: Hermione will visit the house to question Malfoy with Harry in tow under the invisibility cloak. This will get them past the magical barriers and inside the Manor. Then, after questioning Malfoy, Hermione will leave to a safe location just outside the barriers of the Manor for back up. And Harry will remain in the Manor following Malfoy all night.
Draco opens his eyes. Or at least he thinks he does. But he can’t see anything. He lifts his hands to his face, searching. His eyelids are open. His eyelids are open but he can’t see anything.
He was making a beeline for his favourite armchair right by the fire - it was always empty, everyone knew it was his - when he heard it. Laughter.
Malfoy smiled. “By all means, join me then.” He weaved himself out of Harry’s grip and restarted his walk to the showers, the snitch following him.
“Curing? How serious is it?” Harry searches Madam Pomfrey’s face, trying to extract an answer in the purse of her lips. He doesn’t like what he sees. “What’s wrong with him?”
My mother insists that I write you to formally thank you for speaking on behalf of us at the Wizengamot. Without your testimony, we most certainly would have faced time in Azkaban.
With his coat carefully hung in the entrance foyer – large enough in itself to be a studio apartment – Harry is lead through the halls of Malfoy Manor. A double tap on his shoulder lets him know Hermione is taking her leave to cast spells around the house. She’ll give the same signal when she’s finished.
“- stating I was perfectly healthy with no symptoms,” Potter finished smugly as if he had planned the -
incredibly frustrating,” Harry said, his voice rising dangerously again. He hoped Teddy’s singing was enough to drown him out. “Why do you have to be so defensive all the time?”
He watched her eyes flicker to Malfoy and back to him and panicked. He knew exactly what her dare would be. He changed his answer at the last second.
Harry watches as the bleeding slowly stops and the scars close up on Draco’s chest. A horrible thought occurs to him. A thought that sinks down into his gut. “Malfoy, have you…have you been
“Of course,” Harry answered automatically. He had trained new staff before. It wasn’t too hard as long as the cafe wasn’t overrun with customers. And it was only a Tuesday. “Are they here yet?”
“Tiny brain?” Harry repeated, trying not to show his thrill at the first insult thrown between them in years. “Is that the only insult you can come up with?” He goaded.
“I can’t think,” Draco says when nothing comes to his head. He can’t recall enjoying food at all, let alone having a favourite. Just thinking about food is repulsive.
Harry didn’t bother to reply. He couldn’t help but think that without their connection of Teddy, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter weren’t anything to each other anymore. Not even enemies.
“Fine.” Harry jumped up and scrambled into the other bed. He retrieved the pillow from the floor, readjusted the sheets and settled in. Haunted or not, Harry could tell he was going to have a good sleep now. The bed smelt like Malfoy. That would complement Harry’s dreams nicely.
Draco nodded a little too enthusiastically once he understood Potter’s meaning, already anticipating the next time he might hear Potter make that hissing sound again. “Yeah, see you tomorrow, Potter.”
“She doesn’t have one,” Harry says stiffly. He’d sometimes been jealous of that. Not having a soulmate might have been easier. Anything would have been easier than having Draco Malfoy as his. “We both wanted children.” He adds by way of explanation. That had been the whole basis of their marriage. Harry had lied to Draco of course. He’d never really moved on.
“Yeah yeah, I know,” Draco interrupted, sparing one hand from the keyboard to wave dismissively at Harry. “Sweets?”
“Draco, are you – “ Harry, having no understanding of boundaries, yanked the curtain back open again.
No matter how many times the question is posed, it still fills Harry with the same dread. He catches Hermione’s eye and quickly looks away. “I had plans.”
Harry gave up on his internal battle and perched himself on the edge of an armchair when they reached the sitting room. He would leave soon.
Malfoy seems to be adamant on making Harry think he is ignoring him, without actually properly ignoring him. Harry might usually be an oblivious fool, but since his attention is focused on Malfoy whenever he is within visibility, it’s quite easy to notice the way his eyes drift over to Harry every so often, always disguised with a reason – a turn of his head as he coughs, a roll of his neck as he stretches, a twist of his torso as he itches the middle of his back. They’re all novice moves that Harry is very familiar with.
Harry pulls off his invisibility cloak and steps in front of her, ignoring Malfoy’s panicked whispers behind him.
Harry yanked the bed curtains back open. He was standing over Draco’s bed. “Stop running away from me. I want to help.”
“I dare you– ” he started again. The room was getting impatient now, but Malfoy’s intensity held. What could he possibly ask?
Instead, Draco stared back at Harry, accepting the challenge, and responded with a simple, “Yes. I was cold.”
“You too?” Draco questioned, his eyes darting back and forth between Harry’s. “Then why are you acting so…so cool about it?”
Malfoy’s eyes flickered open lazily. He stared at Harry vacantly for a moment, the hint of a smile on his lips, before recognition dawned in his eyes and he sprung out of bed.
“You’re right, Harry. The source is incredibly biased but not in the way you would expect.” Kingsley delivers the final blow with a heavy voice. “It’s Narcissa Malfoy.”
There’s a small hint on Malfoy’s face at this and his eyes dart up to Harry, but just for a second, before returning to the floor. “I’ve promised I won’t say anything.”
him. Harry lunges for his wand and throws a hasty stunning charm that misses, but he’s already sending a second, a third and a fourth in quick succession. One of them finds their mark and the brute who looked about to bite Malfoy falls to the floor. The remaining attacker keeps hold of Malfoy, holding him between Harry and himself like a barrier. That’s when Harry notices the large tear in Malfoy’s shirt and the blood covering his chest.
And when Harry pulled himself back up, and started laughing too, Draco found that he couldn’t stop. As much as he still wanted that kiss, he didn’t think there could be anything better than laughing with Harry Potter.
Luckily, Potter didn’t seem too concerned about the champagne either. At least, when Draco pressed up against him, it was clear there were...other thoughts on his mind. Other thoughts that stretched his robe just a little in the front.
So with the next ordinary day fast approaching, Draco abruptly stood up, dusting off the back of his robes. He didn’t look down in Potter’s direction. He couldn’t stand to see whatever expression would be there - surprise, disappointment, confusion, anger? It didn’t matter.
Harry closes his eyes trying not to imagine that tongue…”You’re being purposefully provocative and it’s not helping right now.”
Harry followed Teddy’s eyes to the tall cupboard opposite the bed. It was a needlessly grand thing with embellished edges and a gold rim, that Harry supposed could actually be real, considering the house - no, manor - he was in. More importantly though, it was still.
That unsettled Draco. Potter was supposed to bite back with something witty, something to fuel the fight. Not - do whatever the hell he was doing now. Still, Draco kept his cool.
He was looking down at Harry with such softness, something Harry had never been exposed to. When Draco let his guard down, there was always something harder underneath. But not this time. Not at all.
. And as he touched himself, the material clung even tighter beneath his fingers so that he was basically outlining the shape of his cock for Draco to see. It was BLASPHEMOUS.
And then one day, when Harry really should be expecting it, but his own denial has clouded his mind, Malfoy, or Draco as he insists Harry calls him now, turns everything up a notch.
He let his eyes rove slowly across Harry’s body, so Harry could watch every movement, so he would know exactly when Draco’s eyes fell down to find Harry hard and waiting. Harry appeared to grow harder still beneath Draco’s gaze.
?” His eyes dart down to Harry’s cauldron and he lets out a frustrated sigh. Harry follows his gaze to find his potion fuming, the newt spleen shriveling up and blackening. His head spins.
Potter popped back up into his seat not much longer afterwards, his disillusionment charm removed. Was it Draco’s imagination or did his hair look even
Because Malfoy passes by him when Harry enters the Great Hall and whispers “Potter,” in his ear although he doesn’t say it exactly like that, he says it with several more syllables than strictly necessary. Which obviously raises alarm bells alongside Harry’s dick.
As he made to leave, Draco stopped him. “Wait, Harry, did you want a coffee?” He asked, quietly, holding out a cup.
Draco nodded seriously to Teddy, his eyes darting over to Harry for a second, before he dropped down and rolled underneath. “It’s here, I’ll get it,” Draco called out, out of breath as if in a struggle, “Hold on, Teddy.”
Harry shakes his head. “There’s a couple near his dorm but I’ve been watching them. He never  - “ Harry stops, as a thought comes to him.
With Teddy occupied, Harry should have been able to concentrate, but he hadn’t really anticipated how much Draco’s presence would affect him. He was sitting by the door casting colourful shapes for Teddy to catch . They were both giggling. Clearly a trait inherited from the Black family for both of them then.
Malfoy’s eyes jerk open and he stares back at Harry as he comes undone over Harry’s hand with a final guttural moan. Harry isn’t even sure what expression is on his own face, so consumed is he with Malfoy’s lidded eyes and open mouth. They keep staring at each other long after Malfoy finishes coming, an intensity that Harry has no idea how to break, not that he has any wish to.
Potter cut Draco off with a laugh, but it was nothing like the sound Draco loved. “Did you ever think that perhaps I’ve been waiting for
“Come on, hurry up,” Ron was saying to the room. “Anybody who’s still here in the next five seconds will be bat-bogey hexed by my sister.”
“But despite all that,” Ron continues, “you love him and he loves you so there’s no excuse not to try and make it work. He owes you that much.”
Draco quickly interrupts before Pansy gets any fanciful ideas. “And I’ve only made up my mind today. Please let me have just one more night in my own bed.”
“Alright, keep playing coy then, Malfoy. Don’t worry, I know what you like. I know what you want to talk about. My cock, right? You want to hear how hard I am.”
The wand feels familiar, as if he’s felt its magic before. He pulls it under the cloak to get a better look. He recognises it instantly. “Malfoy?”
bad. He moved back into the kiss as if they’d never stopped, his lips a sin Draco was ready to commit over and over again.
He could hear the stupid creature - it almost sounded like it was laughing at him - but he couldn’t see it. Where was the damn thing? He cast stunning spells around the cabin recklessly, waiting for the stupid noise to stop so he could rescue his pin. But no matter where he cast, the creature’s laughter continued.
Potter had to drop to his knees to meet Draco where he sat cross-legged on the floor. Potter hadn’t even touched him yet, and Draco’s heart was already pounding against his chest. How was he suppose to sit through the whole process of a hickey without giving himself away? Acting disinterested required concentrated effort. And it was hard to concentrate on anything other than Potter’s lips which would soon be -
Malfoy held out his left arm to the room, his face blank, eyes empty. The Dark Mark wasn’t how Harry expected. He had seen it before – he knew Voldemort’s style well. But Malfoy didn’t just have ink on his arm. At the head of the skull was a huge gaping sore, scabbing at the edges. And where the snake coiled out, Malfoy’s skin was grey and bruised. Harry looked up and met Malfoy’s eyes.
Their dinner ends with the promise of tomorrow night, Potter’s address scrawled on a napkin in Draco’s pocket.
“Thank you, Healer Malfoy,” Potter said with far too much formality as he took hold of the drink - not from the stem, but from the bowl, like an amateur. Draco deigned not to comment on that.
“You know that’s Draco Malfoy you were kissing?” Hermione asks gently. Her bushy hair is slicked tight to her scalp with sweat and blood.
Potter to death, can he?” He points his wand straight down the corridor. “Accio knife,” he says with a smile.
, Harry decided. “I was just thinking that it might be nice to be dosed up on Veritaserum so I’d be forced to tell everyone the truth all the time.”
He ducks into a nearby alleyway and braces himself for the hurling sensation when movement in his peripheral vision stops him. He is not alone. Draco looks over to his right to find a woman blinking up at him. Her hair is matted, face dirty, clothes unwashed, and she is surrounded by what might have been warm blankets once but are now thin rags with more holes than actual material.
Harry can’t help but a smile a little but stops when he sees Hermione’s expression. “I need to go to Malfoy Manor.” He says, shifting the topic back to Malfoy.
Harry shuffled up onto chair fully and laid back. He squirmed a little at the cold plastic covering.
Potter leans back and nods in agreement. “What have you been doing since…” Not for the first time tonight, Potter trails off and clearly changes his line of thought. “Since school?” He finishes.
Harry stared at the ring for a long time, letting the weight of it reach him. He hadn’t realised Draco would propose to him. Even now, when they’d been together almost a year, Draco could still sometimes be quite reserved when talking about his feelings. Harry had always imagined that he would be the one to propose to Draco and he’d been thinking about the right way to do it for some time.
Hermione nudged him under the table. Harry paid no mind, and went to take another swig of his wine glass.
‘Then what are you waiting for?” Luna pipes up. “Wrackspurts will infest your brain soon if you keep being unnecessarily stubborn.”
Draco nods, his gaze fixed on the train. “If soulmates are real, so is destiny, or fate, or whatever you want to call it. I know I was meant to have Scorpius. He’s changed me, Harry, he really has. I’m a different person.” He turns to Harry as the train horn sounds. “I think now I could be who you wanted me to be. Who
“Maybe I can teach you?” Yes, Potter, that’s more like it. Teasing Draco can deal with it. Teasing is
Potter laughs and removes his hand, taking the only warmth Draco’s body can feel with it. He places another plate at a position adjacent to Draco and takes a seat. “If you’re so offended by my furniture, perhaps we should eat at your place next time.”
An image of the two of them fucking sprang to Draco’s mind (or making love as Harry called it), with Harry fully nude and confident, and Draco still with his tight black shirt on, the shirt he was never seen without. He knew Harry would never make fun of him for it, would never even consider it to be strange. But the image didn’t sit right with Draco. When they finally got around to fucking or making love or whatever, he wanted to be the confident one like Harry, to have the freedom to lose himself completely in the moment.
Just when Potter looked like he was about to drop his hand, Draco shot out his own and caught it in a firm shake. Potter’s hand was clammy.
Harry watched Draco’s face twist a little to the sour side as he was caught in a lie. Harry didn’t mind - he preferred it to the mask of politeness they usually wore around each other.
Malfoy unhooked the last button and stood up, shrugging the robe from his shoulders. There was too much skin to avoid now. Malfoy didn’t even seem concerned about his near-nudity. All he wore under the robe were black boxer briefs that clung tight to his thighs–
Draco opened the door to invite Potter in, careful not to step outside the boundary of his doorway, lest he violate his house arrest and end up in Azkaban with his father. Potter bounded in, and made his own way to the kitchen. He had become quite familiar with the Manor over the last few weeks, visiting almost daily, despite Draco’s original protests (which had quickly faded).
“I thought as much.” Draco’s voice says, not as distant as Harry had hoped. “You’ve always been the good one. Even now when…But you’re right. We shouldn’t. It will only confuse things. But-“ Draco’s voice turns into a whisper – “I want you to know
“Fine,” Malfoy snaps. “I appreciate your assistance in healing me. It was unconventional but effective. You have my gratitude. Are we done now?”
Merlin, this was embarrassing. He’d wanted this for ages, and now, when it was literally at his fingertips, he couldn’t go through with it. He dropped his head to avoid Harry’s eye. “Sorry, I know I said I wanted to - but I - it’s just - I’m a virgin.”
Harry hears Malfoy shuffling beside him, followed by an unimpressed groan. He turns to see Malfoy raising himself to his feet, looking down at his clothes in his disgust.
“Macho?” He repeated in disbelief, jerking his broomstick away to regain his distance, and turning to face Malfoy.
“He didn’t. Until last week. His parents were just jailed for fraud and embezzlement. They lost everything.”
“Right. Yes. Thank you, Professor,” Hermione says quickly and makes a hasty exit from the classroom. Harry and Ron follow silently.
Before Harry can reject Ron’s shameless grovelling, Malfoy appears at the end of the corridor and stalks towards them with the usual air of arrogance and superiority.
Draco watched her leave and waited until the door was firmly shut behind her before dropping his professionalism. He turned to Potter. “What the fuck did you tell her?”
“Yes, Malfoy, let me hear you. Touch yourself with me. Do you want to know what else I’m doing? I’m running my other hand across my chest, circling around my nipples, teasing but never touching. Do you want me to touch my nipples, Malfoy? I won’t unless you say.”
“But,” Harry continued, causing Draco’s chest to tighten, “I was wondering if - ” Harry paused and coughed unnecessarily. “I was wondering if you might consider - if you’re interested - the possibility of potentially looking into - only if you want - something that could be considered more than a friendship?”
Of course, what happened next was an absolute disaster. Not only did Draco manage to get no coffee at all into the actual cup, he also burnt, spilt and slipped in the milk - only staying upright thanks to Harry’s quick reflexes, and coated his apron and a decent amount of his suit with dark coffee. Harry hadn’t meant to laugh aloud but there was only so much he could hold in.
“When he left the Manor, I could feel it. Without his thoughts running through my head, I felt lighter. Like I always do the further I am from him.”
Harry is quite glad of the blankets, as it least it means he is only imagining what Draco Malfoy’s dick looks like under the covers and isn’t staring point blank at it. Even if it is a dream. But it doesn’t seem like it. The sounds Malfoy is making are much too loud in Harry’s ears. The vision of the er…disturbance through the blanket seems like it really is right in front of Harry’s eyes, close enough to touch. Not that he wants to. He just means he could if he wanted to. Which he doesn’t. Obviously.
Malfoy laughs, the sound so loud in Harry’s ear he knows Malfoy must still be facing him. He keeps his head down. “You’re relentless.”
Harry leans back in his chair, letting his feet rest on his desk. He’s dirtying paperwork but he doesn’t care. His thoughts are on Malfoy. He can’t be a werewolf. Harry would surely have known before now. Unless it’s a recent affliction? Werewolf or not, how can Harry defend a guilty man? Again.
Draco’s chest clenched uncomfortably and there was a tightness at the back of his throat he couldn’t quite shake. “Since when were you the expert on stars?” He retorted as casually as he could manage. He didn’t want Potter to know how much his words had affected him.
Except, shut up in the Shack with boarded windows in the middle of Hogsmeade, Harry will never know if that graceful figure appears on the Black Lake again tonight. He struggles against the temptation to leave his self-imposed prison just for a glimpse. Nothing else has tested his resolve like this.
Potter’s voice has stopped. Draco hears the unmistakeable sound of a dialtone and then the faint voice: “St Mungo’s Emergency. What is your –“
Percy raised his eyebrows conspiratorially and mimed zipping his lips closed before disappearing into the corridor.
“No,” snaps Mrs Dunberg, her voice clear now, “I don’t have time for this. If you’re finished with your questions, I want you both to leave.”
Harry rushes to breakfast. Malfoy will be back today. Once Harry sees him, and confirms he is his usual horrible self, everything can go back to normal. Harry can shake this awful feeling in his gut.
“Somewhere they actually clean the tables between guests.” Potter finally says light-heartedly. Again: so right.
Malfoy waved a hand dismissively beneath the water. “What’s the point of winning if you can’t have fun doing it? I know you had fun too, Potter. You’re not angry you lost, you’re angry because, as much as you’re trying to deny it you can’t help it: you
Only Pansy would arrange gatherings on school nights. She said it was because the teachers would be much less likely to expect students to be partying on Monday nights, so they were less likely to be caught. Which, Draco supposed did have some merit to it. But the main reason was clearly because Pansy didn’t seem to need as much sleep as everyone else, and liked to laud her morning perkiness over the rest of the year as they walked between classes like zombies.
Draco dropped his head down onto the bed, exhausted. His cock may have wanted a round two, but the rest of his body said otherwise. He was spent. And thoroughly satisfied. Harry Potter was...well, there were no words to accurately summarise what Harry Potter was.
But Potter didn’t say anything further. He simply winked at Draco with those devilishly charming eyes (that made Draco’s knees go weak) before mounting his broom and flying off towards the pitch, his shape growing smaller and smaller until he was just a speck in the distance.
Draco ignored Potter’s slip-up. He understood what it was like to carry secrets. And he was relieved Potter didn’t seem to think too poorly of him despite his behaviour. “I actually don’t think it’s allowed here, either,” he pointed out.
He follows them through the castle corridors, not worrying about being caught, not even considering pulling out his invisibility cloak. There’s just something pulling him along, behind Malfoy like a pathetic puppet, and he doesn’t have the strength to cut the string. But Malfoy does.
Harry’s head dropped back down as quickly as it lifted. It wasn’t his soulmate. It was Draco Malfoy.
Thankfully, Potter didn’t have a retort for that. It was better when Draco got the last word. Except right now he didn’t really have the option for a dramatic exit, since he’d committed to tea and also, you know, it was
Startled, Harry looked up quickly and found Draco Malfoy peering around a bookshelf at him. He frowned. This was the first time he had heard Malfoy talk all year. They'd been avoiding each other mostly, looking away when they caught the other staring (which, admittedly, was often) and keeping a wide distance as they passed in the corridors.
“Harry,” Draco said softly after a pause, “Would you like to go out for dinner with me tomorrow night? I promise it’ll just be the two of us. And significantly less wine I hope.”
Zabini cuts Malfoy off, with a smirk in Harry’s direction. “That’s funny, Potter. Because he was certainly hard enough last night when he fucked – “
Hermione fixes them both with a deathly stare that is probably not dissimilar to the one a Basilisk uses to petrify its victims.  “That was before he tried to hurt you both,” she says seriously.
Harry sweats a little under Malfoy’s gaze. If he’d known, maybe he would have tried harder to stop it. But ultimately, he feels like he must defend the Ministry. “We had to raid the place– Mrs Dunberg should have reported– there were scratches on her arms! “
“Because I’m trying to – merlin, Potter, fine.” Malfoy stomped around Harry and then swivelled around to face him again. “Are you happy now?”
The following Monday when Draco picked Teddy up, Harry waited to see how Draco would act first. He was disappointed.
Teddy jumped on the bed, eyeing the smoke excitedly - sleep would be well off now. “Did you get it? Did you get it?”
Harry looks around in confusion and then up at their teacher, Professor Varas. She is smiling at Harry. “Good idea, Mr. Potter. I think the two of you will be well-matched.”
“Malfoy,” Harry corrects himself with a tight jaw. “I know that you might not feel the same about me as when you were split –“
Malfoy’s eyes glinted. “A special one for me? Now I’m really sad you ruined it,” he said, pulling out his wand.
Harry throws his glasses away. “Is my face telling you right now that I’d like nothing more than to kiss you because–”
She casts a drying spell, and another warming spell that by far surpasses Ron’s attempt. Harry instantly feels better. He wishes there was a similar spell for his heart.
Her name is Anne. She’s not at all what Draco expects. Although he supposes it was improper of him to have expectations of a group of people he’s never even spoken to…or even to group people together based on a single similarity. Regardless, Anne is surprising.
“They’re not assumptions. Bones and I talk about you all the time. And Peters, the bastard, was bragging last week because he was alone in the office with you for a full hour on Monday.”
was, should have to wait any longer, so he put the whole fucking (impressive) thing right into his mouth, totally forgetting his pretence of indifference.
Draco stood up, his dick achingly hard within his trousers, hoping Potter might be reminded of his presence and proceed with the expected sexual favours in return. But Potter seemed to have very different expectations. Because as soon as his clothes had been fully righted - he started walking to the door.
Potter rolled his eyes and stood on Draco’s foot again. Draco wondered if perhaps it was deliberate. “I’ve
Harry concedes. As always, Hermione is ten steps ahead, already planning their next move, when Harry’s still stuck in the present. He’s reluctant to leave Mrs Dunberg even for a moment but Hermione’s right. First, they need a plan.
Draco had started with Potter’s eyes and hadn’t got much further. Sketching over them again and again to get the precise shape, the precise look of concentration as Potter scanned the pitch for the snitch. And then came the colouring. What he had gotten wrong originally was trying to find the one right shade of green for Potter’s eyes, because there wasn’t one. There were a number of shades all swimming amongst each other. Vibrant. Ever changing. Alive.
“Shut up, Malfoy.” Harry turns to Hermione. As humiliating as this is, maybe she can help. “He said something about me being an alpha? Have you read – “
Potter didn’t take it. He was leaning against the wall, arms crossed. The sticking charms in his hair had finally given up completely, his hair popping up at all angles. “What do you think?”
And sure enough watching Malfoy come is just, how does Harry describe this? He’s not exactly an erotic writer, so when he sees it (by it, let me explain on behalf of Harry, he means Malfoy finishing all over his own hand with another moan of “Potter”), all he can think is that it’s beautiful. No really, he’s that much of a fucking sap, he just thinks it’s beautiful. Like what people call bloody sunsets. I mean, sure Harry, sure.
a coaster Draco noticed. “I’m not planning my kitchen trips around you,” he said sharply. "If my company bothers you, then you can find somewhere else to get tea.”
already be hard - as he looked up to meet Potter’s eye. “Right now I would,” he said in answer to Potter’s question.
Merlin. Harry took a deep breath, and straightened his posture, looking up at Malfoy intently. “Go to my dormroom. Strip. Leave the door unlocked.”
You don’t need to reprimand me,” Draco interrupted. “Teddy’s not around. No harm done.” He opened the door and put on a smile. “Thanks ever so much for stopping by,
There was a pause then in which Draco’s eyes darted to Teddy, sitting on Harry’s desk. Harry’s own followed. Teddy was staring back at both of them, he’d clearly been paying close attention to every word of their conversation.
Draco smiled in his sleep. It was only small but it was enough to bring a flutter to Harry’s heart. Even after all this time, a smile from Draco was enough to make Harry weak. In the best possible way.
of you.” He drops his voice to a whisper, conscious his voice has been raising with every word. “Let me fall in love with all of you.”
Potter turned back to Draco. This was it. Draco edged his free arm towards the pocket of his robes - towards the safety of his wand. “Hagrid’s a good person, you know.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about?” Harry says, answering Zabini’s question. Maybe if he just keeps him talking, he can somehow distract him enough to escape. Harry’s hand slowly inches behind him to grasp the doorknob at his back.
Malfoy drops his gaze and studies the floor intently. He takes a moment to reply, and when he speaks, it’s so quiet, Harry only just catches it. “It’s better if you don’t know.”
“That’s not me, Potter,” he spits out. “You’re in love with a fantasy. And when I’m whole again, I won’t want anything to do with you.”
. “Fine.” He can’t make sense of what has just happened. Not his own reaction and certainly not Malfoy’s reaction. With his potion playing up, Harry just panicked. He can’t explain it more than that. Brewing potions used to calm him but now, he can barely wait for class to finish, so he never has to look at this one again.
“Obviously,” Harry supplied. If confessing his feelings wasn’t enough, the semi hard-on in his pants that Malfoy surely must have noticed by now was another dead giveaway.
Malfoy’s eyes dart to the knife and back to Draco. “You’re. Not. Affecting. Me,” he says through gritted teeth.
But instead of saying any of that he settles on: “I don’t think I ever made up my mind in the first place.”
Harry opened his eyes for a second. The room was clear except for Ron who was scooping up the belongings people had left behind. Their eyes met and Harry tried to smile – which probably didn’t come across all that clearly with Malfoy’s mouth still covering most of his. Ron mouthed “HOLY FUCK” and gave Harry the thumbs up before running out the door. Harry would have to thank him later.
Malfoy sighs, something sad and breathy, and looks up at Harry. “I’ve never been able to hate you, although certainly not for lack of trying.”
The first November third after Draco Malfoy met Harry Potter was, of course, unexpected. The date had no significance yet. But by this time, within a few short months of meeting each other, Harry Potter had already become Draco Malfoy’s arch rival.
!” McGonagall’s voice cuts through the crowd and she steps out beside Ron. Dried blood covers her robes but she has no visible wounds. “Look around you.” She gestures at the crumbling walls. “All this is finally over. Don’t extend the misery.”
The room was silent as Malfoy worked his way down the buttons that spanned from his neck to where his robes brushed against the floor. Harry hated himself for noticing how delicately Malfoy’s long fingers handled the buttons. But he kept focusing on the hands so he wouldn’t look at the rest of Malfoy’s skin as it was slowly revealed. It was bad enough that Harry caused this humiliation, it wouldn’t be fair for him to take any enjoyment from it.
A formal greeting. Draco might as well have slapped him across the face. Actually, Harry would have preferred that.
“Why did – what – how – you’re cured?” Harry somehow manages to stutter out, his voice weak and croaky from disuse. Just how long was he out of it for?
It’s still raining down hard on them both but neither seek shelter. They’re already soaked from flying. The rain has battered Malfoy’s usually slick and composed hair delightfully, allowing stray wet strands to scatter and frame his face. Harry stares at him, completely and utterly enchanted.
Harry shrugs. “I don’t know. If you’re going to, say, murder someone, it doesn’t seem like a reasonable deal.”
Harry tried to imagine the implications himself but thought better of it when a number of images appeared in his head too inappropriate to entertain in a library. He shuffled in his seat. “I like your cheekbones,” he said.
All at once the realisation hits – the voice must belong to the figure on the lake. They’ve returned. It takes all Harry’s willpower to stop the wolf from bounding through the walls of the Shrieking Shack, sprinting through the underground tunnel and joining them on the Black Lake. Harry’s never had so much trouble with his control before. He’ll have to get Hermione to up his dose of Wolfsbane. For now, he forces the wolf to settle and lets the voice wash over them both. It’s going to be a long night.
Harry wanted to burst into laughter, but it was much more fun to remain composed – that seemed to be the easiest and most effective way of infuriating Malfoy. “Marginally.”
Harry hears Draco clear his throat beside him. “I saw your divorce in The Daily Prophet. Did the Weas - did she find her soulmate?”
Draco reluctantly opened his eyes to a slightly confused looking and very flushed Potter looking down at him. Beads of sweat were sprinkled across his hairline as if he’d been running for some time - and not just falling from ceilings.
Harry wants to tell Draco he’s wrong. Of course, he’s wrong. After all the time they’ve spent together, with everything that Draco has made Harry feel. How can that be nothing? How can
“I don’t mind, you know,” Potter said, sitting on the edge of Draco’s bed. He had never done that before. “I mean, It looks good on you.”
“Why would he want me to have his hair?” Harry asked. He thought back to how precisely Malfoy styled it back at Hogwarts, never a single hair out of place. “I always thought he was rather fond of it.”
Draco flinched at the sound of his name, his first name, coming out of Potter’s mouth. It was strange, but not entirely unwelcome. Except Draco couldn’t even enjoy it properly, because he knew it would never happen again.
“You have a lot of feelings?” Potter suggested, a smile on his face, half smug half playful, and completely endearing.
When Potter finally unbuttoned the last button at Draco’s ankles, Draco took a step back. He couldn’t trust Potter to treat his robes with any form of delicacy, so he shrugged them off his shoulders himself, very aware that he was only wearing underwear and Potter’s eyes were all over his skin. Potter may have seen his cock before, but he’d never seen him completely exposed like this.
Potter’s lips were everything. Soft and hard. Gentle and demanding. Bracing and warm. How had Draco gone this long without kissing Harry Potter? He should have realised from the way Potter’s lips felt on his neck and his cock, that they’d feel this wonderful on his own. And he certainly knew how talented Potter’s tongue could be if it were to make an appear -
Draco watched as Blaise turned on the spot and walked back into the crowd. The tailoring of his suit really was something else – the fabric clung to his body like a second skin, highlighting toned thighs and broad shoulders. Draco wanted to find out the tailor’s name but not enough to give Blaise the satisfaction of asking.
Harry hastily picks up his wand and stumbles to his feet to follow, dashing out of the classroom, hoping he can still catch up.
Okay, Harry should probably be used to dying and rising from the dead by now, but for those who aren’t personally familiar with the feeling, it’s very odd. Not quite like sleeping like they say,
to meet him. That much Harry knew. Harry had received a letter from a Soulmate Finder only a week ago, explaining they had been hired by his soulmate to find him, and that if he should wish to meet them, Harry should be in Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop at 12pm the following Saturday.
Draco ran a hand through his hair nervously. It had grown out a bit since school, and wasn’t slicked back like it usually was. Perhaps Potter wouldn’t recognise him. Perhaps if he just slouched and kept his head down, Potter wouldn’t notice him at all.
When Draco moved his eyes over to Healer Gibbons to assess the damage, he found she was blushing. Oh shit. “Given Mr Potter’s condition is sensitive, I will wait outside. Healer Malfoy, I am sure you can handle this on your own.”
By fourth year, Draco was wary of November third. Potter had a knack of pulling unwanted emotions out of Draco; envy, rage, and exactly a year ago, something else too. And whatever it was, Draco didn’t like it. It messed with the natural order of things. It messed with his straight forward arch-rival status with Potter.
“Oh, but it does,” Malfoy disagreed. He smiled brightly as if an idea had just come to him. “Oh, wouldn’t that be sporting?”
Harry stood up, his stool making an awful scratching sound across the tea shop fall as he did. Malfoy’s eyes followed the sound and he didn’t look back up. He looked so small and vulnerable. So unlike the Malfoy Harry was used to.
After that Harry isn’t surprised anymore when night after night he dreams of Malfoy. It’s always the same as the second night. Malfoy never makes eye contact, but he always says Harry’s last name. It’s getter harder and harder (pun very much intended) to ignore the erections he is consistently waking with.
Harry does know of course. And now he also knows that Draco has been punished far more than any of his crimes have warranted. He repeats Draco’s earlier words, although he can’t quite mimic the same lightness to his tone. “I suppose I have to forgive you now.”
Harry swallows the lump in his throat. He’s faced Voldemort, for Merlin’s sake. This is just a potion affected, teenage Draco Malfoy. Who, true, has tried to kill him twice. But
Despite the coldness of the evening closing in, Harry would have been content to stay in those arms, right where they were forever. But a startled scream from Teddy wrenched Harry’s eyes back open.
Safe to say, Harry is absolutely and completely confused. Of course, he knew there was something up with Draco Malfoy but he had never considered there might be
A shout from behind him finally cuts through the ringing but he ignores it. He stumbles on, picking up speed despite his spent body, the body that already died once tonight.
on me,” in response. Although, it was clear Potter appreciated it from the muffled grunt that came through the phone line.
scary looking.” The man raised his arms and flexed in mock imitation of a bodybuilder. “I’ll take buff though.”
“I don’t see why you would spend a month undercover in Romania, why you would work weekends, why you would take your paperwork home with you, if you only wanted me to fuck you.”
Malfoy’s face sours at the change of tone. “They left of their own accord once they found what they were looking for,” he says slowly.
An uproar from the audience drew Harry’s attention to Malfoy. He had seen the snitch. He was racing toward mid field and there it was, Harry could see it now, the tiny gold fluttering ball. Harry was hurtling forward immediately, approaching the snitch from the opposite direction to Malfoy so that to the untrained eye it might have looked as if they were simply planning on barreling into each other like some sort of magical jousting tournament.
The disappointment in Potter’s voice was heartbreaking. Now he, like Draco, finally knew that they would be stuck like this forever.
For a second, it looked as if Draco might be planning an excuse - but what could he say? He’d been caught out for the sentimental sap he really was - beneath his sometimes cool exterior. And it’s not like Harry didn’t know - it was the reason he fell in love with him after all.
“Actually, Ron,” Hermione interrupted. “It’s Holly. Mistletoe has white berries.” She turned to Draco. “But that hardly matters, does it? Harry likes you, Draco. It’s obvious. He invited you here as his date, you realise?”
“Fine.” Draco huffed - how was it that Potter was always able to make him say the very things he didn’t want to say - despite how true they might be? “I want you too.”
Harry grabs Malfoy and switches their positions, holding him up against the wall once more. “And how long have you been pining after me, Malfoy?”
Draco jumped back on his bed as a body crashed through the ceiling, falling to the floor at the foot of his bed. Draco’s head jerked up automatically to assess the damage - there was none - the ceiling remained intact. But that didn’t explain what, or who had just dropped from it. He crawled forward on his bed to lean his head dover the edge and -
Malfoy looks up and finally holds Harry’s gaze. “It will be soon. For now, you’ll need to trust me.”
“Yes, you are,” Malfoy interrupts. “You think I’m him. And I’m not. I’ll never be. Your pathetic pushover fantasy lover is gone. Show me some fucking respect and stop confusing him with me.”
It could have been a coincidence but Harry already knew It wasn’t. Draco Malfoy was his soulmate. He couldn’t find the words to explain it to Malfoy but it must have been clear in Harry’s face, because the same shock played out on Malfoy’s as the penny dropped.
After a week and a half, the spells on Malfoy Manor have not activated once. Malfoy has no visitors and he never leaves the house.
Potter hissed again, low and breathy. Draco didn’t require a translation to know Potter was swearing.
? There was a shuffling sound on the phone line and then: “I have to thank you for that speakerphone suggestion, Malfoy. It’s so much better when I can use both my hands, although I’d much prefer they were yours of course.”
The students all paused and turned to face him, their demeanor changing instantly. It wasn’t that they were afraid of him. That wasn’t how to teach. It was respect.
“I’m the one who set him free,” Harry realises. If anything, this is all his fault. First the potion, itself. Now this.
Potter certainly wasn’t dressed better. His robes looked like the same tuxedo style knock-off every muggleborn owned - fitting to wear to both Wizarding and muggle events without arousing suspicion. And somehow - Draco suspecting heavy duty sticking charms - Potter had ruined his hair by slicking it back for the event. But despite his poor styling choices, there was something so captivating about Potter’s presence, and Draco could tell it wasn’t his own bias. Everyone was glancing, as they walked by, giving Harry Potter, the boy who lived, the
Draco clutched onto his empty champagne class so tight he was surprised it didn’t shatter. He could feel his face heating up. He didn’t dare look over at Potter. “Fucking Christ,” he cursed a little too loudly – a few heads turned their way. “What is that supposed to mean?” he asked in a quieter voice.
Malfoy jerks his head up to Harry as he sits. Harry meets his eye. “I need to know what’s going on.”
Malfoy turns to face him in the corridor, his face a familiar scowl.  “What did you do that for? You let me win.”
Professor Slughorn looks like he might be about to answer but stops himself, fiddling with the papers on his desk nervously, avoiding eye contact. “I really shouldn’t be telling you anything at all.”
“Is that why you wanted to show me this?” Draco asked. “Did you think I didn’t know you wanted to take it back?” He laughed and it sounded choked. “Potter, you saved my life. You saved the entire wizarding world. You’re the hero. I know.”
“How am I supposed to tell you your dress robes look much better on my bedroom floor if you’re just going to go and do that?”
“Or what? You’ll ask me again? Only this time with a pretty please and sugar on top?” The unhinged Malfoy patronises.
Draco signed loudly, letting the sound echo in the high ceilings of the hospital wing. Hermione was right; Potter had confessed his love and Draco had done nothing. He needed to get to Potter immediately.
Draco supposes he owes it to Potter to at least make him feel comfortable. Just by staying he is helping Draco more than he knows. Draco sighs. There’s only one thing he thinks will help. “I had a crush on you in school.”
Draco had only just left Harry at home, flooed to the Ministry lobby, and taken the lift up to his office. Harry must have been right behind him, must have run through the lobby, must have just managed to catch the lift prior before vanishing his clothes…and sure enough, now that Draco was looking, he could see the beads of sweat running down Harry’s (naked) chest.
“You spend more money on the party than is donated to the cause!” Harry’s voice had started to rise. Despite his genuine anger, he couldn’t deny the excitement of sparring with Draco again.
A small part of Draco was relieved that he didn’t have to call Potter after all but a much larger part was already panicking at the prospect of assessing Potter. How could he remain professional with a patient who had once sucked his - well, he would just have to call on his professionalism training and do his best.
“Oh, good grief, Potter,” Malfoy interrupts, taking a step back. “Get your head out of the fucking gutter. I meant cut out your tongue.”
The walk down to the Slytherin dungeons started quietly. Harry was grateful for some time to think. He needed to land on a reasonable explanation for knowing about Malfoy’s cinnamon allergy in case Malfoy asked him again. He figured “I don’t know” wouldn’t cut it a second time.
Harry knows his face must be red with his anger. He can’t remember the last time he’d been so worked up like this. Not since Draco left. Draco Malfoy always had a way of drawing the uglier emotions out of him.
Harry had iced and decorated all 316 cupcakes with the Slytherin crest – one for each of the Slytherin team in addition to the crowd in attendance. On a whim, he’d made a custom cupcake for Malfoy to really show him up, but he was starting to regret that decision. He’d already levitated the cupcakes out to the crowds and now he hovered high above the pitch, holding tightly onto the remaining cupcake in one hand, waiting.
“I can’t sit with you at dinner tonight,” Harry suddenly realises. Funny how quickly he’d forgotten about the moon when it usually dominates his thoughts.
him,” the hopefully fake (cloned?) Malfoy mocks, his pitch rising as his voice wavers. “Of course. Well, that’ll make all the difference when I kill him. Perhaps you’ll die of a broken heart? Then I can finally be free of you, and your pathetic
November Third. It couldn’t have any significance. Really. That was absurd. It was just Potter. Being his usual do-gooder self, trying to get Draco to
In fact, he doesn’t say anything at all, which is maddening. Harry takes it upon himself to fill the gap.
Sneaking out of the dormitory at midnight felt silly. It was so late, they should’ve been sneaking back
In his post-orgasm state, Draco felt the embarrassment hit him again. His face flushed with the thought of all the ridiculous things he had said to Potter. What were they supposed to say to each other now? His eyes darted over to the clock by his bedroom door - 11.59pm. It was late. Perhaps Draco could pretend he fell asleep and -
Harry didn’t make a fuss the first time they’d bumped into each other at Andromeda’s, even though the last time they’d seen each other had been at Hogwarts, in the middle of a war, on opposite sides. He trusted Andromeda, and if she, as fiercely protective as she was, trusted Draco around Teddy, that was enough for Harry to do the same. Although, he still watched closely, curious to understand Draco’s behaviour.
Right. Fuck. Harry has been seriously underestimating Malfoy. And he’s just starting to realise how much danger he’s actually in. He scans the shelves beside him for something,
Draco made eyes with Healer Gibbons, hoping she might take over, but she just gestured for Draco to continue. “So, what symptoms do you have?” Draco asked.
about, Potter,” Malfoy interrupts will a roll of his eyes. “I can’t bare an arm without offending someone. I can’t leave my house without people suspecting I’m up to something. I’m forever the villain. And now I’m
Harry looked down at his flannel and jeans and then back to Malfoy, taking in his fine black robes and crisp white shirt for the first time. Malfoy’s hair had been styled back with a very slight quiff at the front that would have easily taken some time to complete. He looked as if he might have been going to visit the Queen. He clearly wanted to make an impression on his soulmate. Before he knew it was Harry.
“Well, only when you’re not playing coy with me.” Potter’s playful smirk, was another thing altogether with his head lulled back against the wall as it was.
Potter made a sound that started off as a laugh and evolved into a soft moan. “Remember when you moaned around my cock, Malfoy? That was hot.”
Potter was leaning against the bar, alone, smiling to himself. Draco would have made fun if he hadn’t been doing exactly the same thing too. Well, he could hardly help himself. A date with Harry Potter -
you, and Peters, although being a complete twat about it, is just finding excuses to talk to you because he also wants to
“This–” Hermione gestures towards Harry’s scribbled plan– “is completely unethical. You wanted to take this case so Malfoy would be treated fairly and yet you’re the one more than happy to invade his privacy.”
Then Malfoy’s hands found Harry’s hips and pulled him forward, just as Malfoy’s tongue decided to make the first move. And the kiss didn’t feel so wrong anymore. Now, Harry didn’t hesitate when he felt the urge to run his hands through Malfoy’s hair – he just did it, and enjoyed when Malfoy made a soft sound of approval.
Mr Weasley looked between Harry and Malfoy. “Accidental wandless magic feeds off our emotions. Anxiety feeds off our greatest insecurities. I would suggest that Mr Mal– that one of you is particularly insecure about the other’s opinion of them. That and his hair.”
Harry shrugs, remembering the way he held Theodore Nott upside down by the fire with one hand and growled in his face multiple times. “He probably suspects.”
Potter’s face lit up with a surprised smile - he obviously hadn’t expected Draco to be so agreeable - neither had Draco. “In that case, make sure you capture me from the left. It’s my good side.”
He didn’t have much time. The school year was all but over. If he didn’t fix the vanishing cabinet soon he would be killed. His family would be killed. As Draco had come to know all too well, The Dark Lord was not a patient man.
“And they’re making you write a thesis? You’d think being instrumental in the defeat of He Who Must Not Be Named would be enough to get you in anywhere,” Slughorn chuckles.
do that? We both know you won’t do it. If I can’t cast a killing curse, then there is no way you can. You’re more than welcome to borrow my knife though…after I’m done of course.
“I know how obvious it is, okay?” Draco said, his voice softening again. “I know it’s pathetic and stupid and even selfish to think we could ever…” Draco paused, rubbing at his eyes again. “I
Now in all his readings he couldn’t find an instance of wizards or witches who shared wands having a connection where they watched each other masturbate – those texts might be in the restricted section. But he did find many instances of a wand that remained in allegiance to two people, allowing those people to connect almost spiritually so that they could remain in contact even when apart. And the way it was described, inhabiting a physical body but usually accessed via dreaming, seeming a lot like the way he’s been seeing Malfoy.
Malfoy laughs loudly, twisting around to stare out at the Great Lake “I don’t need to be dating anyone to have sex. Don’t be so traditional, Potter. And I thought
When Draco finally looked up, his reaction wasn’t anything like Harry expected. There was no anger, nor elation, but confusion. And when Draco’s eyes searched the Gryffindor table and locked onto Harry’s, there were tears brimming at the edges of his eyes.
“What a waste of my time,” Malfoy is saying as he continues to pace back and forth in front of Harry. “I can’t even kill you.  It’s
“I bet you are,” Draco said without thinking. Potter was one horny fucking bastard. Not that Draco was complaining.
“They didn’t let you have pyjamas?” Draco repeated. “What are you talking about? You’re speaking nonsense.”
erection), Harry panicked and moved to his final option, the one he’d been hoping to avoid: waking Malfoy up.
Although when Harry leant forward and the hand he was leaning on slipped at the last minute leading to a misplaced kiss on Draco’s chin instead of his lips, Draco found an embarrassing giggle escaping his throat.
After being introduced to a middle-aged lady who called herself Muriel the second, Draco excused himself into the house. He had to find Harry and tell him he’d had enough. That he was going home.
Harry looked back up at Malfoy, waiting for his reaction. Sure, they’d been tricked into it but Malfoy could always storm off without him. It’s not as if their show of being civil to each other throughout the year had fooled anyone.
With a quick glance at Narcissa, Madam Pomfrey hurries forward with the medicine cups. Both Dracos hold out their hands willingly, one hanging loosely, one visibly shaking.
“Why are we – “ starts Zabini before Malfoy pushes him up against a wall and kisses him. Or snogs him, really. It’s heavy and fast and Harry is standing there watching it all, frozen. And Malfoy knows it.
“And now my hair has been magically fixed with the power of your shrug,” Harry said sarcastically. “Thanks.” He stomped out of the bathroom and made his way downstairs.
The directness startled Draco. He found himself tripping over his words which he almost never did. “I–I– fine. Yes, that’s what I meant. I’m sorry. I don’t actually
Potter shakes his head. “That’s not…” He trails off and starts again. “I’ve always wanted to come here.”
Potter dismounted his broom, considerably less gracefully than he flew. “Thanks, Malfoy,” he said, one hand coming up to rub the back of his neck. “I didn't know you were - I mean, did you want to play? Is that why you're here? Because I can – “
Zabini slides in beside Malfoy, throwing an arm over the back of his chair. Malfoy turns, leans up and plants a gentle kiss on his boyfriend’s cheek, all the while smiling pleasantly. Harry cleans his glasses and reassesses the scene. Malfoy’s still smiling. Harry’s never seen him smile before, at least not like this, not like he
This time, Draco did have the pleasure of rolling his eyes. “See that star there,” he pointed, “and the stars that curve around underneath it to the right, like a hook?”
“You need to get to the Ministry. Now,” it says in Hermione’s clear authoritative voice before vanishing.
Mrs Weasley gestured to Harry with a spatula. Mr Weasley turned, following her direction. “Oh,” he said when he saw Harry. He didn’t appear surprised.
Harry blinks back at Malfoy. He cannot believe after a fucking home invasion of all things, Malfoy is flirting with him. And somehow Harry finds himself taking the bait. “I’m not innocent.”
Harry waits for hours. He knows Ron and Hermione will be worried but this is more important. He has to know. He has to know. He’s glad to have his friends help him, he’s so incredibly grateful, but they can’t understand how Harry feels. This is his fault. He did this to Malfoy. As much as he used to hate the git, he would never have wished to really hurt him.
a nice kitchen. Retro baby blue tile with a floor to ceiling window that looks out onto a shared courtyard. Usually Draco’s blinds remain tightly closed but he has opened them today for Potter’s benefit. He should enjoy the full view even if Draco doesn’t.
Automatically, Harry lifted a hand to his head and pushed back his hair at the mention. Draco’s eyes followed the action. “How is that–“
It’s a while before Potter replies. Long enough that Pepper has finished her food and returned to Draco to play with his pant leg, clawing at him in a decidedly affectionate way, at least for a cat.
“I thought I’d try something simpler first.” Malfoy said, pulling his broom in closer, close enough to –
“Then I’m in no position to judge you,” Draco said, his face impassive. It was impossible to understand the tone of the conversation they were having with Draco doing that. Harry was used to identifying Draco’s various scowls and glares but this was devoid of any tell.
He entered the house quietly, determined to catch Draco by surprise just this once - he always seemed to know Harry’s move even before Harry did. Harry tiptoed past the living room, heading for the bedroom - it was late and Harry figured Draco would be in the middle of his nightly read before bed - but a flicker of light caught his eye.
It wasn’t much of a conversation. No barriers had been broken. And at the end of the day, they were still enemies. But Potter hadn’t left yet despite having finished his tea much earlier. And there shouldn’t have been anything significant to read into that, but Draco did anyway. Because all he had was hope. Hope and November third.
Draco paused in the doorway. “Yes?” His voice sounded strained. That was something, at least. Something more than cold politeness.
Draco straightens up as Potter approaches. He moves to stand and greet him as is only polite but his body waivers so he remains seating. It’s only Harry Potter after all.
Since the discovery, Draco had been painfully waiting for November third to swing around again so he could actually use Potter’s number. If he called him on any other day, there was no telling what would happen, but if he called Potter on November third, then it would at least be
Wednesday night is just a surprise as the previous. Harry, honest to Merlin and all that is magical, thought one dream was it. That it was just one strange betrayal of his unconscious mind that would never happen again. But that would be too easy, wouldn’t it?
Draco used the time to take in Potter’s house. Potter had apparated them straight into his bedroom. A brash but certainly not unwelcome move. There were clothes strewn across the floor and even a few on the bed which told Draco a two things - one, that he hadn’t actually thought out what he was wearing for the night until the night itself (How did people
Instead of kissing her hand (like any polite society man would know to do), before Draco could stop him, Potter had clasped Pansy’s hand tight. “Harry Potter,” he introduced himself as they shook hands.
Pansy jumped up from the bed, a victorious smile on her face. “I knew it! You have a thing for Potter.”
Harry doesn’t bother disputing the claim. It’s undeniably true. But, in fairness: “You’ve been doing the same to me.”
Merlin, Harry thinks. He looks so sad and small and not like Malfoy at all. But his words don’t make sense. If Malfoy has never hated him, then why has he antagonized Harry for years? “Then why do you act like you do?”
“Obviously,” Harry repeated, his voice shaking with his laughter. He took a breath and pushed it back down. There were customers watching them now, waiting for their delayed coffees. “Maybe I can fix it?” He suggested as gently as he could.
It’s Malfoy who breaks the silence twenty or so minutes in, scrambling Harry’s repeating inner monologue of
Of course, Hermione isn’t too happy when she finds out where Harry has been. He debates not saying anything, but he figures what he’s learned might come in handy. And Hermione really is the brains of their operation after all. The one who can connect all the puzzle pieces together.
“Step out of my frame and do all the work for you both? Do you two insufferable dunderheads ever think anything through?”
“Bye. And Say bye to Potter for me, you didn’t let me – “ Draco hangs up before Pansy can finish. He’s going to pay for that later. He turns his attention to Potter. “What did she say to you?”
“Of course, I had forgotten you were on the clock. I sincerely hope you aren’t going to get in trouble for taking a break from serving?”
He may have been able to hold back his whimpers - just barely - but Draco couldn’t do anything about his breathing. It had to have been giving him away. What other explanation could there be for why he was
. They didn’t know they’d be meeting Harry Potter. What if he wasn’t what they had in mind? What if they wanted someone who didn’t bite their nails? Who was charming and smooth and so very unlike Harry?
Somehow Draco isn’t mad this time. It could be the gentle smile on Potter’s face, the way he stands close by Draco’s side, almost always near enough to touch, or it could be the fact that he’s actually ready to listen now, really listen. And he’s not altogether unconvinced that Potter has a point.
finishing bringing in all of Draco’s luggage, he didn’t leave. Instead, he had the nerve to sit down on the bed across from Draco. Potter’s bed. “You have way too many clothes,” he commented unnecessarily.
“Malfoy is known to be collaborating with werewolves. One of the Dunbergs was at his house last night. Mrs Dunberg is covered in scratches. Mr Dunberg isn’t available to meet us. Yet we hear a strange noise in the house? It’s obvious. He’s weakening before his transformation. And you want to go barrelling in to investigate without backup?”
Harry had no idea what to do on his turn. It seemed like everyone had already kissed everybody in the room and he couldn’t think of any other interesting dares. He looked around the room trying to find someone who wouldn’t mind him daring them something boring. His eyes passed quickly over Malfoy.
When Harry and Ron entered the common room, a loud cheer rang out around the group. Harry hoped it wasn’t to do with him. He spotted Malfoy immediately, perched on a stool by the fire, smiling along with everyone else but not making any noise, like a kid lip syncing in a choir. He wore black robes with long tight sleeves that appeared to dig into his wrists. Unlike most of the other students in the room, half of whom were dressed in their pyjamas, Malfoy looked completely in his element, as if he were nocturnal. Too late, Harry realised he’d been staring. He looked away.
Did Draco need to remind him that it was Potter who seemed so desperate for a bloody blowjob in the first place? Draco was just here trying to do his job, of the
Malfoy smiles sweet and simple, and Harry can’t remember ever seeing someone so beautiful. He shakes the thought from his head. Despite whatever happened with the dittany the other night, their relationship is still professional.
They visit the library every night after class. Harry would much rather be visiting Malfoy’s dorm every night. Which taken out of context, is a little disturbing. But he has to know if Malfoy actually sleeps there or not, and if not, where he goes at night. The unmade bed Harry witnessed when he woke up in Malfoy’s room last week
“And Malfoy will either curse me on the spot or, worse, agree and laud this over my head for the rest of the school year. No, for the rest of my life!”
, there it was. The first splash of come on Potter’s face and wasn’t that a fucking spectacular sight? The rest came out of Draco in a brilliant high, all the while Potter blinked up at him.
Draco is rewarded with a splutter from Potter and then an awkward: “That’s not what I…I mean…strangers to
“Oh right,” Potter says quickly, turning away again, which gives Draco the suspicion he was thinking something else entirely.
“No,” he said quietly, his face pained. Then his eyes lit up and he started to smile until the Veritaserum made him add, “But I used to.”
After a tentative sniff, Draco’s whole hand is claimed, two little paws pulling it in with just a hint of claw, enough for Draco to wince but not enough to pull away, and the cat’s tongue, like sandpaper attacks Draco’s palm. He smiles.
“Right, I should have realised,” Draco said seriously, clearly not affected by the position in the same way Harry was. “Classic Harry Potter, barging recklessly into sex as he does all his endeavours.”
Potter sighed. “It means I’ll take what I can get, and right now, I’d like to get off. And so would you. Am I right?”
Quite expectedly, the note leaves Harry confused. Firstly, why has the note been delivered to him rather than Mrs. Malfoy and secondly, and more terrifyingly, “keep him contained”? What does that mean? It sounds as if they’re treating Draco as an animal rather than a human being. He looks back over to the owl for at least an answer to his first question.
“STAY BACK,” Malfoy yells, causing Draco to freeze. “Stay away from me or I’ll kill him. I still can. You haven’t affected me so much that I can’t
“The vials for your prisoners,” Malfoy interrupts, hovering a tray of six vials by Harry’s hand. “They’ll need to take it by midnight to be effective so you best be on your way.”
Ron ducks his head, the tips of his ears flushing as they always do at any sign of confrontation. “About that…”
Of course, a wizarding stakeout is a little more difficult than the similar muggle operation. For one, there are magical barriers surrounding Malfoy Manor alerting the occupants to intruders. Secondly, it’s not enough to simply man the gate, as there are many ways for a witch, wizard or werewolf to arrive.
Potter had beaten Draco in the Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match in the morning. Again. Draco had been training constantly - it’s not like he had much else to do, or anyone else to hang out with - and yet he had still been defeated. It was disheartening. He wondered whether he should just give up on Quidditch. Maybe on Hogwarts too. It’s not like anyone wanted him here.
Malfoy’s eyes widen, cheeks reddening (Harry hadn’t meant the innuendo, but he’s pleased with the reaction regardless), and he splutters a moment before trying to respond in a choked voice. “That’s not – what do you – “
As soon as the two women disappear around the corner, Malfoy jumps out from the cloak, heading straight for the disguised wall. He taps his head with his wand and reactivates his disillusionment charm. Harry lunges for Malfoy’s shoulder and grabs it just before it disappears.
The room felt smaller despite the tall heritage ceilings and the air stuffier despite the cool breeze passing through from the nearby window. Draco pulled at his collar – a nervous habit – and took an undignified gulp of his champagne, hoping the bubbles would hit him faster than they usually did. The night had only just begun, and he wasn’t so keen on talking with his ex sober.
Harry took a deep breath and rolled his shoulders back. He could handle a snotty rich kid. He headed over quickly, conscious of the mounting coffee orders.
the only time. All through eighth year, I thought I made it clear. I was dropping hints constantly. And two years ago, I gave you my number. You could have called me any day, Malfoy. I always would have answered. But for some reason, you can’t seem to get over this weird fascination with November third. What’s so special about today, Malfoy?”
Hermione gives Harry a gentle smile, it’s probably supposed to be comforting. “Give him space if you think that’s what he needs, but don’t give up, Harry. We all know Malfoy isn’t the most straightforward person. It’s probably going to take him a little longer to make sense of his own feelings for you.”
Harry smiled, unbridled and deliciously beautiful, and Draco was never more pleased to have his sight back.
one,” he says resentfully. “I’m, well, I don’t know what I am now.” He slumps back up against the wall.
“Better for who? The Dunbergs? For you?” Harry questions, unable to keep the frustration out of his voice. He doesn’t have the patience for Malfoy’s riddles and half-truths.
And now it was the day, and despite his nerves, Draco already wanted his shift to end so he could make the call.
It works. Potter looks guilty, uncomfortable. Caught out. It’s horrible. Great, now Draco feels guilty too.
Harry rolled his eyes as he leant back in for take two. This time, Draco laid another charm on him, but it wasn’t so much magic as it was
Luckily it seems Draco does as well, because he whispers the incantation for Harry to repeat: “Leniret Fumum.” The smoke loosens and unwraps, curling in on itself until it disappears into nothing. Draco wastes no time in getting up and heading to the door. He sticks his head out, obviously surveying the corridor and then motions for Harry to follow him as he sneaks out.
Harry winces. He’s used to Malfoy’s harsh words riling him up but Zabini? His wrath is new. And cruel.
“Don’t scare him,” Harry whispered, moving to stand in front of Draco. He didn’t think humouring Teddy’s fears of the cupboard, which apparently Draco did every night, was the best parenting approach.
Harry senses the finality in Hermione’s voice. He turns away with a shrug. He isn’t sure what to believe. But after so many weeks in the dark, it can’t hurt to have more answers. And if one of the Draco Malfoys is going to explain, then he’s eager to listen. But he can’t promise anything more than that.
Harry only glanced down at the bill as the waiter hurriedly moved to retrieve it, less the rich table who ordered lobster, caviar
Harry can see in Malfoy’s face that he’s right. He takes a step forward wanting to comfort Malfoy, but Malfoy steps back at the same time, quick as he was during the duel.
“Um.” Harry wasn’t quite sure what Draco wanted to hear. “I like you and I want to have sex with you?” he suggested.
How Draco envied Harry’s restraint, almost as much as he hated it. He turned to Harry’s desk, where Harry had taken him so many times before, and bent forward as slowly as his body would allow - he hoped it might thwart Harry’s restraint. He was pleased to hear Harry’s sharp intake of breath behind him although disappointed it didn’t result in him being fucked immediately. He laid his elbows down over Harry’s paperwork, and flinched when his dick made contact with the cold wood. If Harry took much longer, Draco supposed he could just rut himself against the desk for relief instead. Although by this point, he figured all it would take was a single touch from Harry to make him come undone.
“It could be,” Malfoy said, his eyes on his firewhiskey as he swished it around in his glass like it were wine.
dinner,” Draco clarifies. He can’t believe he is having this conversation. In what world would he be asking Harry Potter out on a date? In what world would Harry Potter say yes?
What right did Potter have to be so confident when Draco was scrambling not to make a fool out of himself? This was supposed to be easy. Draco needed to make a dignified exit. “Right, well you seem to be doing just fine. I’ll note that in your report and -“
It explains Hermione’s Patronus. And the hole. He can’t believe the Department of Magical Creatures went ahead with the raid so quickly. “A baby?” He finally manages to choke out. “Why didn’t they regist–”
He is sure his mother is happy to have him every day and practically force feed him as if he is a baby. And for this reason he is not currently on the best terms with her. So of course, Draco is forced to make other arrangements. Yesterday it was Zabini – unfortunately he was only in town for the weekend, the day before it was Goyle – who was an atrocious slob and certainly would not be invited again, tomorrow it will be Pansy – flooing from Portugal especially, and today it is Harry Potter.
Draco felt as if he’d been dosed with veritaserum. He had such a desire to tell Potter exactly what he thought about that smirk. He settled for something a little vaguer, but still more forward than he’d usually allow himself, and honest. Completely honest.
He doesn’t let his eyes stray from Malfoy’s dot, watching it weave in and out of other students, clearly not heading for the Slytherin dormitories, or even the Hospital Wing, but somewhere else entirely.
When they returned to the party much later, with an almost empty bottle of firewhisky, all eyes were on them. Well, on Malfoy actually.
Can I remind you that I did specify it would never happen between us, so fantasising is all you’ll ever be doing?
“Mate,” Ron intervenes, “What are you going to do? Follow him around the castle all night? Can’t you just watch him on the Marauder’s Map? You can do that from the library.”
“Malfoy, are you okay?” Harry asks, because he has to say something. When no answer is forthcoming, Harry tries the next best comment for a recent dumpee: “He’s a jerk.”
Potter was laughing at him. And Draco didn’t even care. Because he was about to have Potter’s tongue on his cock. And even now, he had Potter’s hands working the buttons of his pants, and good grief, he didn’t know how much longer he could wait to -
“I had fun tonight.” Harry takes a step forward, the sight of Malfoy looking so delectable allowing him a little more boldness than usual.
He left Potter slumped up against the wall and hurried back down to the Slytherin dorms. He never realised how far down the dungeons really were until he travelled from the seventh floor to said dorms and back on one single journey. Hogwarts was in dire need of a lift.
letter, fall from Draco’s fingers. But their audience of students did. And soon enough the letter would make its way across the entirety of Hogwarts. But what did Harry care? Draco knew how he felt now. There was no need to hide his feelings any longer.
