As he took a shower, he prayed to Merlin there would soon be a resolution to the hell he found himself in. He almost wished Harry would break up with him. He knew it would hurt, but nothing could hurt more than this. Having him so near and acting so hatefully was worse than not having him at all. Or so he imagined.
________________________________________________________________
He gripped his cock base and squeezed hard. When that didn’t do the trick, he twisted his balls, painfully. It seemed to relent.
When Draco woke up, he was on his side, curled around a body in front of him. His arms were wrapped around Blaise and his body was flush against his. He realized that the thing that woke him was Blaise’s ass, wiggling against his erect cock. Draco cursed his morning wood and tried to pull away.
Harry gripped Draco’s back hard enough to leave nail marks that he would have to heal later. He slammed Draco down hard and released his cum inside with a loud moan, keeping himself fully sheathed.
He threw Blaise, face forward, on the green velvet couch. He tore off his silk robe and pushed his silk pajama bottoms down to his knees in a frenzy, exposing his bare ass to the air.
“Right. What was she doing, again?”
Draco honestly could not handle more, after taking so long to tie him up. He wanted to fuck him again, right now. Blaise’s cock was hanging over the edge of the bed and was half hard already. He slapped his ass, hard.
Draco immediately rushed him and tackled him to the ground, screaming in rage. He punched his chest multiple times, as hard as he could, but it wasn’t enough to cause any damage. It was like punching steel. Harry allowed this for a moment then flipped them over, pinning his hands to the ground.
He reached with his free hand for a glass of water on the nightstand to quench his parched throat when his fingers knocked something sitting in front of it. They were glasses, round glasses. He would know them anywhere.
He backed away and slapped his face again, holding his chin up towards him.
“Oh, there you are.”
Draco was sorely tempted, only partly by lust. He was more interested in whipping him until he screamed. He needed to punish him. He had come to Harry’s house intending to
“You don’t know what you’re talking about, Potter. You know nothing about me or my relationship with Blaise. So shut your fucking mouth.”
He was thinking of how much more he loved Draco with every passing day, when he caught sight of a cloaked figure in his periphery. As he turned his head, the figure drew his wand and he saw a green light forming at the tip of it. It all happened in slow motion.
“Blaise!”
Draco scooted forward and cuddled behind him, taking in his warmth. Harry sighed at the feeling of his arms wrapped around him, finally. They both fell asleep.
“You always say that when there’s roast and potatoes.”
When he was halfway through his fourth drink, there was a knock at the door.
Harry turns slowly and finds both child healers standing by the head of his bed with these proud smiles—because his eyes are just a little open.
When he reached the atrium floor, Harry was waiting for him by the fireplace.
“Three strokes each. Ten strokes total.”
“No, fuck you Malfoy. You’re the selfish prick. Too dumb to realize that he’s manipulating you. Too selfish to cut him loose, the way you ought to. The guy’s in love with you and you keep stringing him along. It’s not fair to him. Are you that insecure, that you need your boy toy simpering after you, pining for you, just waiting for you to throw him a bone?
Worried about the horses, he peeks at the stables and is relieved to see them still standing. Finally, he chances a glance at Harry who’s rolled onto his back, staring at him with a lopsided smile.
He gives him a reassuring smile. “So sure.”
“Thanks. You don’t have to. It just slipped. It’s fine Drake. Just go ahead.”
He knew Blaise could handle far more than this. The sound was for his benefit.
“I like it,” Harry said.
Draco went to his wardrobe and dressed in boxer briefs and a full silk pajama set. He usually slept only in his underwear. He crawled in on the other side of the bed and turned to face the wall, shutting his eyes.
“Blaise, I’m past that. Let’s move on and get back to normal.”
Draco smirked before putting disdain in his voice. It took real effort because he was so giddy.
When Blaise was satisfied by Draco’s hardness, he used his wand to cast cleaning, lubrication, and stretching charms on himself. He thrust his fingers inside his own hole a few times before climbing on top of Draco. Grasping Draco’s cock at the base, he lined it up with his hole, before sinking down on it, all the way to the hilt.
“Sir,” Draco reminded him with a feral grin.
Sleep came swiftly.
“Me? I’m fine. I’ve handled worse from the papers. Besides, now Ginny will be forced into the separation.”
Draco smiled sadly as he sat back down, cradling his firewhiskey.
He pulled back after a few sucks, kissing the head tenderly, and licking the underside of his cock, over and over again, to wet it more. Then he went lower, licking his balls before plopping each one into his mouth.
This is how Draco lived, for most of his adult sex life, a Dominant who’s main concern was the pleasure of his submissive.
Twenty more minutes of silence passed.
When they apparated to Blaise’s bedroom, Draco turned to him with a commanding tone.
But Draco doesn’t want to fuck him harder. He wants to make love to him face to face, so he pulls out and tries to turn Harry around. Harry resists him, throwing him backwards on the bed, and gets up on his hands and knees.
Harry locked eyes with him and saw that Draco’s pupils were completely blown to black. Only a thin sliver of silver surrounded the rim. He looked down and noticed his hard cock was leaking pre-cum already. The sight was too much bare and only caused him pain. He looked away as Draco grabbed his wand from the nightstand, cast preparation charms on himself, and promptly sat down on Harry’s cock, engulfing him to the hilt.
“…I just wanted to say thanks.”
That meant…ignoring his safe word.
The only difference was the lack of preparation this time around. Draco was in too much of a rush and assumed that Blaise would be amply stretched from the weekend before.
Neech came back quickly and placed an ornate gold jewelry box on the table. It looked very old, but still in pristine condition. He opened it and withdrew a solid titanium bracelet that had the Malfoy coat of arms. It had a myriad of protective enchantments that would alert Draco to his location, should he ever be in grave danger. It would also protect him from minor curses. He shimmied it out of its velvet pouch. It would only unclasp at Draco's touch.
“Potter,” he reached out to shake his hand as well, never one to forget his manners.
“After that,” Hermione sends a smile in Draco’s direction, “finally, we got Harry in the shower.”
“You okay, baby?” Draco asks.
Harry was in much better spirits after their office play, and Draco was forced to realize that constant rough sex, though pleasurable, was no match for the joy Harry felt, playing his submissive. He worried it would take over their relationship, but he wanted to give him everything he needed. He also remembered that Harry was practically panting when he put his hands on him in public. He wanted Draco’s public affections, and he wasn’t going to deny him anymore. He felt like he was finally taking care of his boy the way he deserved, and he decided to kick it up a notch. They were just finishing dinner when Draco presented his perfect plan.
They made love twice more that same night, and fell into a peaceful sleep.
“…how can you say that? Love is the only thing that matters.”
He stands in the shower the next morning, thinking. He tries not to think about him, but he couldn’t make a clean break from his mental calendar.
“Because I love you!”
“Watch your mouth, Potter. I refuse to accept your degradation behind closed doors. Maybe, this isn’t going to work, after all.”
It was nothing out of the ordinary, though admittedly, more intense than usual.
It was only then that Draco felt an overwhelming sense of shame at having a failed marriage, for all to see. Half the reason for getting married, in the first place, was to support each other at public functions such as this. He did not expect it to be this painful, without Astoria.
Draco pulled out slightly and pushed
He decided to go home early that day, to regroup. Harry was going to have dinner with his children, then meet him at the manor, later that same night, intending to stay the entire weekend.
He lifted him to stand so he could dry him with the towel himself, but he swayed on his feet and almost fell sideways. Harry caught him, and his frustration was palpable. Draco didn’t know what he was getting so mad about. He must have forgotten he was a wizard and could use a drying charm on him, but Harry hated using magic for mundane tasks.
He stared at Harry, waiting for him to say something, to vouch for him, like he said he would,
“Sure…Nice to have a playmate in Paris.”
When they sat down for breakfast, Harry wouldn’t meet his eye.
“Right as rain. I saw the healer this morning and she went over some exercises with me. One of them will be something I can do if I’m in the fuck position. Over a bottom.”
That struck too close to home. He hoped Blaise’s silencing charms held.
“What’s wrong with your leg?”
He changes into gray sweats and an old, torn, Gryffindor T-shirt and sets up camp on the half-heart couch, pulling out a quidditch magazine to get his mind off him. He doesn’t want to be up in the bedroom, waiting. It makes him think of his blond-haired naked body bathed in moonlight on his duvet. The couch is danger too. Draco’s fucked him on it numerous times. Even the kitchen bothers him. One night, when Harry was getting frazzled over cooking an Alfredo pasta, Draco pulled him down and fucked him right on the kitchen floor. Eased his tension well enough then, but it only makes him think of his limitless libido now.
Harry and Draco were alone together, now.
He knew Harry did not understand what this meant. He thought it was about giving all the power to Draco. He thought it was about taking a beating and feeling the pain, being fucked into oblivion until you cried. Yet, the reality was that all the true power lay in the hands of the submissive who could stop their play at any time, using a safe word. The whippings, floggings, and spankings were meant only as a tool to heighten the pleasure of the submissive, not just to please the master.
“No sir.”
“Such a good boy.”
Astoria began to cry. Tears were always his weak spot. It used to shred his heart watching his father, often, bring his mother to tears.
“I understand you endured a werewolf attack last Friday. You weren’t bitten, and it wasn’t the full moon, so we didn’t feel the need to, immediately, warn you about potential side effects. You left too early for us to council you, fully. Can you tell me what you were doing, before the werewolf attack?”
He takes Blaise to the couch to sit next to him.
Ron steps forward so he can clap Harry on the shoulder. He chuckles. “She’s right, you know. You two are romance goals.”
________________________________________________________________
“How did you even get through the wards?”
“MASTER!” He shouted, “I have to cum, please God, let me cum! This is all you, you did this to me. I have no control, never did, don’t want it! Please, please please!”
“You do?” Draco’s laughing again, because truth—he’s fucking elated.
Draco, not this angry blonde vengeful angel. He felt guilty for making Draco recall the days of his dark childhood, when he did have to bow his head, to the Dark Lord.
The interlude with Blaise left him feeling more frustrated and on the edge than before. He was a ticking time bomb and needed to pull himself together before facing Harry again.
“Are you intending to kill me with sex?”
At the mention of Harry’s perfect family, Draco’s anger reached greater heights.
“In Diagon Alley.”
This scene is heavily influenced by Ella James, especially the second half, from her book Adore. Can't take all the creds on this beautiful smut. Hope you liked it. What do you think of subHarry so far? Is it good? Should I continue? kudos or comment.
They were still fully clothed when Draco felt Harry’s erection jutting against him. He broke the kiss to draw breath, feeling lightheaded, and Harry attacked his neck with loud kisses and began to unbutton his shirt. Draco literally melted into him, powerless.
He flipped them over so that he was on top and kissed his neck in turn before moving down his chest slowly. Harry watched him through hooded eyes.
“Harry?”
Harry was acting like he was starring in his own telenovela.
“Neech is healing it for you, Master.”
“It’s not what it looks like, Potter. That was just a hug between friends. I’ll be leaving now.”
It makes Draco smile, and Harry takes it as encouragement.
Harry’s too in his head to argue. He knows Draco loves his silk comforter.
Of his delicious white knuckles gripping his chair arms as he blows into his mouth— and can’t help needing to suck him again.
, before he returns to his important meeting with the most important people of government, including the minister of magic. He follows him into the men’s room and fucks him hard enough to rattle the stall door off its hinges. It’s almost a sort of self destruction, but he can’t stop.
Harry and Draco went to the parlor. Draco poured them each a night cap and sat down, staring at the fire.
“I went home early, to get some things for Blaise and walked in on her, just seconds after she got rid of a lover.”
your voice is so sexy. I could listen to your sex voice for the rest of my life. Tell me you want me.”
“What does that mean, exactly? Am I going to be your dirty little secret, forever?”
“You still haven’t fucked me properly since those nights in Turkey. Do you think I’ve forgotten?”
“I just want your perfect cock all to myself, but tomorrow night is fine. I’m going to lick…and suck…and kiss every inch of your body,” he said between licks and sucks on his neck.
“Don’t be an idiot, Potter. This Is completely conspicuous. We’ll just apparate and disillusion ourselves like we always do.”
Blaise had the same look in his eyes that the chained man at
He left out the part about offering his support to Blaise. That would be very uncharacteristic of Draco and Astoria would know something was up.
Harry stood up, unsteady on his feet. Draco noticed he was red all over. He looked like he was about to collapse.
Mr Wolfe spoke up, chuckling. “Ah, Monsieur Malfoy, always insisting on a one-man sub. Selfish as always. He belongs to you only and wouldn’t obey anyone else I assume, like your last…But what happened to Blaise? Yours for ten years, if I remember correctly. So lovely, maybe more so than this one. I never saw a sub more enamored with his master.”
Draco decided now was a good time to leave.
Blaise moaned in slight pain at Draco roughly fucking him, hard and fast, now. His flesh was slapping against his loudly. Draco relished the sounds.
Harry gulped for air, trying to calm himself. This is Draco, he reminded himself, whom he’d be able to stop with his safe word.
needed here. Without me watching, no one takes care of the small things.”
Draco narrowed his eyes.
“Get ready to leave in fifteen minutes Auror Malfoy. We have a potential situation in Islington,” he ordered harshly.
Draco let himself be pushed by Neech into the parlor and collapsed in his large brown leather chair. His hand was bleeding copiously, and he did not have the wherewithal to heal it. The cut was very deep. He just watched his hand dripping fat droplets of blood, wondering if he would die if he left it like this, and not finding it in himself to care. The horrors of the last ten minutes washed over him.
Draco throws up his hands, “Is there anything I can do, King Harry?”
for dinner tonight. I still have to pick up a gift.”
Harry inhaled him deeply.
As long as he took his altered wolfsbane potion, these crazed emotions would simmer. He’d see clearly again.
He wiggled his eyebrows and Draco gave him a sly grin that made his heart thump.
“I’m afraid that’s a right of passage for every pureblood marriage. I’m glad to hear you’re enjoying it. I knew you would.”
“What the fuck, Draco. Why do you refuse to do it to me? It never seemed to be a problem to do it to Blaise!”
It’s high cost wasn’t due to just the diamonds and gold, but also the protective enchantments and anti-theft charms placed upon it. It would shield Astoria from most minor curses and would burn hot if anyone but a Malfoy tried to wear it, melting their skin.
The only other solution he could think of was actively being a terrible Dom.
Harry rolls his shoulders, only too keen of that feeling. But Draco is the one who doesn’t understand. He thinks Blaise is only happy pleasing a Dom, but the truth is,
“We have to head up to the mountains today. Are you up for it? I can get someone else on the case…But, I wanted the best.”
They sip their mojitos in silence.
“This conversation is not over.” He turned him around and roughly threw him against the back of the couch.
they were. His buttocks were well-marked with red lines crisscrossing over the muscular globes. Despite that, his eyes were peaceful, almost as if he were on some kind of high.
He smiles as he hears Harry calling him his “handsome prince” in his mind. He makes a split second decision to surprise him at Grimmauld Place, donning a black cloak and disappearing into the floo.
Harry scooted off his chair to kneel in front of him and put both hands on his thighs now, rubbing softly. His head was bowed submissively and he wasn’t meeting Draco’s eyes. It was a good look on him.
“Give it to me..
Most of their time was spent bringing down the wards to the steel door, but eventually they broke through. The door vanished, and they walked through to find themselves in a hallway. The long hallway led to an open atrium where all the potions were being brewed in large vats.
He squeezes them shut, and his chest starts to rise and fall more sharply.
Harry had his arms crossed and a shoulder braced against the window as he looked out over the property. He was very still and relaxed. The light from the window washed over his rumpled hair making him look very young. He appeared lost in thought until he heard Draco enter the room, and then turned to face him in the display position, eyes to the floor.
Draco smiled and hugged her tightly, for much longer than usual. Her long silky blonde hair tickled his hand. She stepped back after a minute and smiled warmly back at him. He saw Scorpius standing behind her, trying to make himself small as if to remain hidden and didn’t move to greet him. He stepped away instead, looking into the parlor.
Draco was slow to collect himself and spilled firewhiskey on the carpet, in his efforts.
“You know exactly what I mean!” his voice rose to a shout and it startled him.
Draco’s halfie bounces as he moves around the kitchen. It occurs to him that he should have thrown some clothes on, but he was worried. When he steps over to the table with two plates on his arm, Draco can’t help smirking. Harry grabs his hip, then his cock.
Draco blushes. He did always like to watch, especially the sight of Blaise on his knees, sucking his cock, his thick black eyelashes fluttering. And
It’s Saturday. Harry should be home. He tries to floo to Grimmauld Place, but his floo is closed. That worries him.
“Technically, he’s still mine. My responsibility. But again, it doesn’t mean anything. He hasn’t even brought it up. It was signed over ten years ago. I’m sure he’s forgotten all about it. It’s nothing to stress over.”
“Don’t speak of things you know nothing about. You’re performance in my room today was appalling. I’m not going to continue with this Harry.”
Suddenly, Ginny ran up to Draco and gave him a bone-crushing hug.
“Fuck me. Master, fuck me hard, make me feel it, take me, have me…ah..yes, yes, yes.”
“Thanks, Drake.”
“Whoa, what crawled up his arse?” Blaise asked.
____________________________________________________________________________
Draco’s resistance was wearing. He had imbibed too much firewhiskey, to be sure, but he held fast, gripping his glass of firewhiskey hard enough to break. It trembled in his hand, the ice clinking, as Blaise tongued his neck.
“I told you that you’ve ruined him for good, and you’re probably going to do the same thing to me because you’re fucked up that way. Thanks for proving me right. You’re a right bastard, Draco.”
“Anything permanent?”
Harry’s eyes dropped, and he said nothing.
Draco removed his finger and dove in with his tongue again, pushing hard. He felt Harry drop down to his elbows, and Harry’s cry was muffled in the pillows. Draco ignored him and kept at it, licking around his hole and then pushing in, his hands spreading Harry’s cheeks wide. Between his own thighs, he could feel himself stiffen, the taste of Harry, the sounds he was filling the room with making Draco’s blood flow faster. He only hoped Harry would hold out long enough for him to actually start fucking him before he blew.
He was always surprised that Harry never recoiled at such sexual acts. There were men who had been gay for years who would never do such a thing, but Harry seemed to crave it all. It only made Draco’s desire for him, that much more unbearable.
“That is what you’re sorry for?” He thinks of the thing he just had to do,
“Harry. If my performance earlier today doesn’t communicate to you what this means to me, then I don’t know what will. I literally got on my knees for you. I told you I won’t fuck Blaise again, and I’m a man of my word.”
He floos into the ministry, trembling. While walking towards the lifts, the security gaurd stops him.
This made Draco’s anger reach its pinnacle. He had told him he loved him and Harry was laughing at him in response. He lay his heart bare and made the most humiliating confessions, yet Harry was humiliating him further. He did not care if he was drunk, that was no excuse for behaving like a bastard. Draco had taken a risk and chanced his most difficult task to date, an admittance of love, and Harry could not care less, let alone return the sentiment.
Draco was dressed in simple but tailored muggle clothing. He wore fitted black jeans with a crisp white tee shirt that hugged his body tightly, hinting at the abs underneath. Looking down further, Harry saw that he wore the classic black and white Van’s sneaker. His hair hung loosely, framing his face, emphasizing his high cheekbones. He looked like a very different man than Harry was used to.
“I shared mine with you. I figure It’s only fair you share in return. That’s how friendships work, Malfoy.”
“I can’t not be.” Harry’s chest starts to pump. His face is twisted in pain. “I can’t start over even if I wanted to. Everywhere I go, people know me. People know my face. When we went to France, to the Louvre, a muggle place, some people recognized me.”
Harry’s brow furrowed as Draco spoke and he took his time answering.
“I’m sorry Draco. I’m still new to this. I’m ready and willing to learn. Don’t give up on me. I need this. I want to please you. Let’s play this out for the rest of the weekend. For real. No breaking the scene. Just show me your true Dom self for two full days, and I’ll prove to you how good of a submissive I can be.”
When this thing with Harry eventually imploded, the way Draco was certain it would, he would be in a terrible predicament. This interlude was hot and heavy now, but it was not stable. He was old enough to know that the hottest fires always burn out the fastest. He would be left with nothing, no Harry and no Blaise.
Draco could not handle all the emotion in them, so he quickly flipped around, laying on his belly, and budged up on his knees so that Harry had easy access to his raised ass. Harry caressed his bottom tenderly, kissing each cheek, then moved to finger him. Draco smacked his fingers away. Couldn’t he tell how desperately he needed him?
It was titled
He feels Harry swallow. His head sort of bows.
He knew it was wrong, but he needed to remind Blaise…of what? He didn’t know, but he needed to do this. He wanted to do this. He planned to keep his promise. He wasn’t going to fuck him, but what was a kiss between friends?
Blaise nodded in return and began to stroll across King’s cross station to the apparition point. With every step he took away from Draco, the longing for him returned and he missed him already. He felt pathetic and a little used, though he could hardly blame Draco for that.
“No more than usual,” he couldn’t meet his eyes.
Draco pulled his pants back up and moved off the bed.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows in confusion. Didn’t Harry know how much he wanted him, how much he loved him?
He moved lower to Draco’s cock to suck on it before putting a finger inside. Draco was stretched with the charm, but Harry’s girth would require more. His pace was erratic at first, finding it difficult to maintain a steady pace with his cock in his mouth and thrust his fingers inside at the same time, but he managed. Soon, Draco was pulling him up to lie back on top of him, and spread his legs wide open.
“Don’t you have to go to work?”
Draco’s eyes starting closing. He felt Harry stroking his cheek, brushing his white blonde hair from his eyes. The last thing he felt before falling into sleep was Harry’s lips softly kissing his forehead.
Draco rose his eyebrows towards Astoria who said,
“When’s the last time you slept? You look awful.”
He slapped his face with his cock a few times, just to degrade him further. Blaise did this for a long while, slapping Draco hard enough with his cock for the sound to reverberate in the room.
“Go ahead and submit your request. I’ll make sure Shacklebolt rejects it.”
“No.”
“But he’s not you, Drake.”
Most of all, he hated himself because he knew he was betraying Harry.
Draco sighed. “I’m not doing this to upset you. You are a very beautiful boy, Harry. If I let you walk in there with no sign that you have an owner, you might not like what would happen next. You won't be hurt, but you might have to fend off a number of offers from some persistent admirers. I’m not going to put you in that position, understand? This way the other Tops will know that you already belong to me.”
Harry reached around to grasp Draco’s cock in his hand and started to stroke. After only half a minute, Draco’s orgasm tore out of him and ropes of cum splattered the ivory couch.
When they arrived at the beach, it was still only 1pm and the sun was high.
His fevered eyes roll towards her. His lips part, and his eyes narrow. Then he swings his gaze to Draco.
“Eyes forward.”
Draco looked into his pleading sub eyes. The man was so beautiful, it was sometimes hard to look at him. He was wearing fitted grey trousers and a thin blue v-neck sweater that outlined his perfectly fit, lithe body. He was sporting his classic handsome movie star grin as his deep blue eyes twinkled, hopefully. He looked like a star on an Italian soap opera. His wavy black hair sat perfectly in place, unlike Harry’s.
His eyes prickled as that fact hit him. The wave of emotion was too much to endure.
He carefully planned in advance what he would be doing with him, especially if it was rope play. That was half the fun.
Harry hesitated pulling back against the leash. “Where exactly are we going…sir?” He remembered to add.
Draco stared at the kneeling figure, considering. He wanted to please him, he said. Could it be possible that Draco could shape him into the perfect submissive? The result would be having the savior of the Wizarding World, himself, on his knees, with a snap of his fingers. He cock began to harden again, just thinking about it.
They eat pancakes in bed, and Harry looks tired.
He moved in to kiss Draco, but at the mention of his wife, Draco held him back, remembering all the things Blaise said.
When he was naked, he knelt to the floor, sitting on his legs, his back straight, his hands clasped behind him, looking at the ground.
“Fuck, I love you. I can’t wait to be your husband.” Draco kisses his lips and slides his ring on.
Draco should have known that his hero-complex would kick in.
Astoria braced herself, wishing this moment never arrived.
He gasped in admiration when Draco reappeared. He was wearing black leather trousers and a black leather shirt, molded tightly to his body, cut in a deep V which showed off his pale chiseled chest. The dark leather enhanced his naturally commanding masculinity and Harry felt his cock swell with desire, trapped as it was in the tight confines of his pants. A strap dangled from Draco’s belt and he held a leash in his gloved hands.
“I requested the criminal we arrested today to be waiting in the interrogation room. Why isn’t he there yet? This was your responsibility.” His tone was brash, loud, and rude. It was clear to everyone who heard him speaking that he detested Draco. He was making a real show of it. He often played up the boss card, these days.
He used the floo in his bedroom to get to Harry’s house, leaving his own ancestral home behind.
Scorpius seemed to remember himself, but he was seething. He was a Malfoy, after all. He still had a temper.
“ I can’t deny I have more than friendly feelings for him. So long a time having sex would do that to anyone, but I’m with you, now.”
“Are you alright, pet?”
“Allow me.”
He had to stroke his own cock to relieve the tension, coating it with lube. He pressed down on his prostate as Draco had done to him earlier, and Draco went wild with lust, moaning loudly. He was going to cum, any second. The build up this morning was too much, but he needed something more than fingers.
“Is that all you got,
“We could do a celebration later.”
“Yes, sir,” Harry said, embarrassed that his cock was already tenting his trousers in the most obvious way. Draco’s lips twitched when he noticed it, but he preserved his severe expression. He grabbed his waistband, sliding his fingers inside, pulling Harry closer to stand at his right.
He immediately filed a report for embezzlement, being as detailed as possible, so that Nott could not escape persecution. He referenced the evidence and made a magical copy of the financial statements, to submit with the report. He mentioned Astoria was helping him, but drew a picture of his wife as being a loving mother with a soft heart, who was hook-winked and pressured by the quidditch star. He was angry with his wife, but still, he did not have the heart to press charges against her and put Scorpius’ mother in Azkaban.
Draco smiled at Harry calling himself that. It pleased him, to no end, that Harry caught onto exactly what Draco liked in a bottom. His only problem was that his cock was painfully hard now, tenting his trousers. He was surprised to see a wet spot already forming. He pushed it down.
He imparts a warning that the plug has a purple dye that will be released if he tries to remove it and doesn’t sleep much that night, thinking about how many times Harry will have to toss off in the night to relieve himself. It will never be enough. He advises him to wear tight boxer briefs and to bring a change of underwear to work.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“And who am I?” Draco teases.
“Sorry Drake. I got stuck with Pansy picking out flowers and centerpieces.”
“Wait, Drake. Don’t go. Please, sit.”
Dinner was dominated by a prattling Scorpius and Albus. Harry was chuckling at both of them, but Draco’s face remained impassive. He was still depressed by his thoughts, from earlier. They were discussing Hogwarts and how they hoped they’d be sorted into the same house so they could be in the same dorm room together. Albus begged Scorpius to teach him to skateboard and Scorpius happily agreed. After dinner, Scorpius insisted on showing Albus his room, before he left. It was getting late. Albus’ bedtime was fast approaching. Harry was reluctant to agree, but ended up caving, in the end.
He hadn’t meant to shout, and Astoria bowed her head in response.
Blaise thrust his cock straight down into his throat and held his face there by his hair, choking Draco. He gagged at the rough treatment, but Blaise held fast and put a hand over his nose so he couldn’t breathe from it. Draco’s eyes started to water, instantly.
“Oh right, right.” Harry’s eye tracked Draco’s movements and he whimpered at the tube of lube. “Stand by, sir”
He was fully hard now, cursing himself. There was nothing for it. He stroked his cock slowly. He closed his eyes, the image of Harry’s hateful defiant glare, right before he threw his gloves off was at the forefront of his mind, as he quickly and quietly brought himself to orgasm, Harry’s name on his lips.
His eyes are closed through his orgasm, and by the time he opens them, Harry’s already huddled up to the edge of the bed, unmoving and silent. He uses his wand to cast a cleaning charm and cuddles behind his lover.
“I wanted to…I wouldn’t want to with anyone else, just you.”
_______________________________________________________________
, but Harry had burned that feeling away, entirely.
Harry had finally stopped laughing and his eyes were shining with emotion. He was still grinning at him. His whole face had changed since Draco first saw him tonight. He looked younger, somehow, eyes bright, cheeks flushed from mirth, and absolutely, devastatingly beautiful.
He took a seat. Draco turned to pour them both a glass a firewhiskey, thinking they would need it. He handed one to Harry and sat opposite him, crossing his legs.
Harry’s eyes widen. Draco’s chest heaves. He shuts his eyes and says the damn words. The ones that bruise his heart. “We both know this can’t go on.”
Ten minutes later, there was a knock on his door.
Draco smiled. He was finally getting under Harry’s skin. He’d never seen the man so nervous and subdued. He only hoped it wouldn’t be too much for him. He slipped a black collar around his neck. Harry’s skin broke out in goosebumps all over. Licking his lips, Draco relished his sensitive response.
he needed a way to relax and the baths of Turkey were legendary.
He came up behind Harry, cast a cleaning charm, and
Besides being physically taxed from the trip, he was emotionally drained, to the point where he felt he might collapse at any moment. This had been the longest week of his life.
Harry positively sizzled with anger. Draco could feel it coming off of him in waves. All the plates and cups in the cabinets started shaking and breaking.
“Seeing you with your son is such a turn on. You’re so good with him…Such a stern dad. Are you going to give me some of that daddy cock?”
He followed Harry towards the sea and they began to walk on the coastline towards the very end of the beach where there was large wall of rocks. They jutted out ten feet into the sea.

would fix them.
He flashed them a warm smile. Some swooned. They ate it up.
“It seems like they’re being manufactured in Turkey and we need to go there to check it out. Be ready to leave in an hour and pack a bag. We might need to be there for a few days.”
Draco embraced him, in turn, burying his face in his shoulder. When he pulled back, Harry began a soft, sensual kiss on his mouth. Draco stroked his arms, lovingly.
He was fairly certain that he would give Harry anything he ever asked for, as long as he continued to put his body on top of his.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
“I’m sorry. It...it still smells like you.”
He rode the horse fast through the Malfoy grounds, far around the property which spanned several miles. Finally, he felt his mind clear. A sense of freedom washed over him as the cool evening air whipped against his face.
“Go, Neech.”
“Talk to me, baby.”
The fact that Blaise never married or seemed to be dating anyone seriously, as of late, sometimes worried Draco. Whenever he brought it up to the blue eyed Italian god, he would shrug it off and change the subject.
“Blimey, no wonder you’re so fucked up, Draco. There’s nothing wrong with liking men. That’s how you were made. It’s not, exactly, something a person can help.”
Harry’s face was drawn in disappointment. He lowered his head and walked out of the bedroom, down the stairs.
Harry was not talking, but something was definitely wrong. It was not often that Harry kept his feelings hidden from him. He was usually an open book. It was one of Draco’s favorite qualities about him, as he, himself, operated so covertly in his life, always hiding behind a mask. He scrambled for something to say, wanting to wipe the sad look off his face. His lover should never leave his presence, looking like this. It meant Draco had failed in some way.
Draco wanted to throw him on the bed and fuck him right now. His cock was straining his leather pants.
The sound of the dark lord’s name still caused a shiver to course through him, so he sits down.
Draco pounced. He curled along Harry’s side, one hand immediately massaging Harry’s cock as he he thrust his tongue into Harry’s mouth in a deep, claiming kiss. He growled for effect and rubbed himself shamelessly on Harry’s leg.
“Why are you bringing up Blaise, all the sudden? You haven’t mentioned him in months. Listen to me, Harry. I never want you to compare yourself to that codswallop. He’s dead to me. You and I are completely different. Can’t you see how much I love you? I never even came close to feeling about him, the way I feel about you. You’re everything to me, everything I could ever want. The sex is wonderful, as is. I don’t want it any other way. Please, let’s not fight about this.”
He should have noticed the minute he fell to his knees. Sometime between the snowy cabin and now—Harry changed.
Draco’s ribs scream and he realizes that he’s kind of halfway panting. His heart races.
Suddenly, Draco realized that he had to be inside him again.
_________________________________________
“Aww, come on dad! Ten feet is nothing. I usually fly way over the roof of the house.”
He dragged Draco back to the bed, to lay on top of him. He was grasping Draco’s face and kissing him for all he was worth. Draco flipped them so Harry was on top. His brain didn’t have the appetite to fuck Harry. He had a monster inside of him that begged for it, but that could wait. It was a dangerous being that needed to be repressed.
__________________________________________________
They finished showering together, both in a giddy mood. The earlier sadness had vanished the way Draco hoped it would. He bathed Harry, for a change, and he found he was enjoying this intimate act, almost as much as he enjoyed fucking him. There was something so satisfying about making him dirty, then cleaning him up, afterward. Plus, it was an excuse to run his hands over every inch of his body.
The submissive pose turned him on more. It would be so easy to turn Blaise around, pull his trousers down, and fuck him against the wall. It could be quick, hard, and fast. He badly wanted to. Blaise was turning him on all night by being aloof and impassive. His cock could cut diamond, at this point, but he could not break his promise.
Draco sat down, trying to take everything in.
“You know what I mean...It’s been ages.” He started circling him in a predatory way. Blaise was trying to follow his gaze.
Of course,
Draco landed yet another punishing blow. Blaise’s ass was blotching an angry red now, all over. He shut his eyes tightly at the pain, but his cock did not waver from full hardness.
Spurred on by this new sexual commanding drawl of Draco’s, Harry quickly corrected his posture. His cock was fully erect, pointing straight out.
“Just feels tight and hot. I think it’s all right.”
He held Harry close, cuddling him through the aftershocks of his orgasm, smiling when his liquid eyes opened, glittering green, full of wonder.
“Ten’s more than a few.” He raises his eyebrows and grins to mask his new sickness.
Harry apparated them directly into the bedroom. He repositioned them so that they lay on their side, legs entangled. Harry was still erect enough so that they hadn’t disconnected yet.
“And I told you that it had nothing to do with the scene. I enjoy being that for you, more than you could possibly understand. I would wear the collar day and night, in front of Shacklebolt himself. I’m not strong enough to deal with the fact that your contract with Blaise is still holding. I want to be the one with the contract. You promised me it would be gone last week, yet here we are two weeks later. You tell me I’m the one you love, yet you deny me this, and now you won’t even play. You spent gallons of galleons on a playroom that you won’t even let us use.”
swirled his tongue around Harry’s nipple and he jumped. It seemed to be a sensitive spot so Draco spent some time sucking and licking both nipples before moving lower.
Harry was shaking by the time he got to his cock. He was many thing, but an unskilled lover was not one of them.
Harry swallows. “It scares me how much.”
Draco blushed at the ground, walking up the stairs, thinking. He could potentially stay here forever, as long as Harry was with him.
“Scorpius, it’s time to go.” he barked, leaving little room for negotiation. Draco got up and abruptly started walking away without saying goodbye, not waiting for Scorpius but knowing he wouldn’t be far behind. Scorpius grudgingly followed, but not before saying a quick, polite goodbye to the both of them.
Harry seemed to not notice and began to move again, inside him, while licking and biting Draco’s neck. The chokehold prevented Draco from moving too much. He knew this submissive position well, though he was usually in Harry’s spot. He enjoyed it more, this way.
Draco expected this, and he was prepared.
He was standing at the door of Draco’s office, not daring to step across the threshold, decked in full Gryffindor-red auror regalia that he filled to the point of bursting, with his broad shoulders, body hard from rigorous auror training. God, he hated him.
Draco immediately spooned behind him, kissing his neck. He forced Harry to turn around so that he could be held. Being the weak slave that he was meant he couldn’t deny him this. Draco kissed him desperately, all over his face and then his lips.
As for losing your would-be lover, I’m assuming that’s me. You haven’t lost me. I’m right here. I’ll always be, right here.”
Harry just stared at him, looking angry. Draco could tell he was trying to decide whether to argue about this or not, to discern if he was lying to him, but Draco lied very smoothly, without hesitation, looking him right in the eye. Plus, arguing with Draco would imply that he cared, making him drop his feigned indifference.
“I would enjoy it more, if I could get what I need, in private.” He looked at him coyly.
Harry chuckles. “I promise, Draco. I’ve never been more sure of anything in my entire life. And you could still spank me, whenever you want.”
“Shut it! The only problem we have is you! So just please. Please release yourself from the contract. Think about it, at least.”
I know I’ve been more reckless than usual. Things at home aren’t going so well…”
wouldn't cut it.
“Not now, Potter. The kids could walk in and see.”
When Harry saw he wasn’t going to be rebuffed, he grew more daring and rubbed higher on his inner thigh.
“Tell me.”
“How are you feeling?”
“Too much for me? This is some proposal.” Draco snorts.
Draco cast a quick glamour on himself before heading to the bathroom. Walking quickly, but not running, he went straight into the toilet and promptly vomited all of his stomach contents, including mainly, Blaise’s cum.
“Are you mental? You think I’m going to fuck you after you almost beat my best friend to death? Blaise is lying in a hospital bed right now over you insane jealousy. You’re completely off your rocker, Potter. You are mentally unstable. To be frank, you reminded me of the Dark Lord, today.”
“Yes?”
Draco’s mouth watered at the sight. He knew he should not do this, but the thought was drowned by the ecstasy promised inside Harry’s raised perfect ass. He had to fuck him. He had no choice. He had not fucked him in months. He was lost in thought for a moment, until Harry arched his back and wiggled, invitingly.
Draco startled out of his daydream and turned around to see Blaise grinning at him.
Blaise kissed him again. “I miss you Drake…Please come back to me. Be with me, for real this time.”
He held him still, down onto his cock for a few seconds then pushed him off roughly. Blaise fell sideways with the force, but quickly righted himself. Draco picked him up by his hair and threw him on the bed. Blaise quickly moved to the center of the bed, with his eyes closed, sure not to display any emotion on his face.
“Black? Blimey, this is my aunt’s ancestral home, from my mother’s side. No wonder it has that pureblood feel. I’ve been here before, as a child. I like this place. How did you get it?”
Blaise always required prep as It was not often that they fucked four days in a row, and therein lies the rub.
I'm cumming."
It’s not a metaphorical one like with Harry, it’s a physical acute pain, like someone’s taking a dagger to his insides. Blaise chants the words in latin louder. His voice is stronger. The tear lengthens more, but it does so slowly, as if the parchment is resisting. All the while, it feels like a muggle surgeon is carefully cutting out one of his ventricles. Draco starts sweating from the pain, clutching his chest, rolling on the ground like he’s having a heart attack. He’s gasping for air, until finally, the parchment rips in two and just like that, Draco’s heart is three chambers, instead of four. He feels for his pulse, and he's surprised it’s still there. There’s a deep ache inside, like a bruise he thinks will never heal.
They both decided to go into work that day, even though it was a Saturday, and dressed accordingly. They were completely behind in all their work as their sexual escapades ate up all their time. When they weren’t having sex, they were thinking about it, which prevented them from working, even while they were apart.
The result was that some cum leaked out of his mouth, down his chin, and some splashed his cheek.
In the weeks that followed Harry’s epiphany, he and Draco’s sex life had immensely suffered. As a result, Draco was plagued with a myriad of racing thoughts.
______________________________________________________
The conjured rope always chaffed. Draco refused to use it on him.
“Whatever you want, baby.”
Draco kept the discovery that Blaise outed him, a secret. He did not want Harry to know it was him because it would force him to explain that he had kept the nature of he and Harry’s relationship, a secret. That would force him to answer a series of uncomfortable questions as to Blaise's motive. Now that he knew he was in love with him, he was desperate for Harry to never find out what occurred with Blaise, only two nights ago.
Adjusting himself, he stared harder at the head snuggled to his chest, and angled himself to get a closer look. He brushed some dark locks aside, and
he let out between short breaths. At the sound of his desperate words and the feeling of Harry’s tight grip on his ass, signifying his end, Draco fell over the edge with him. They came at the same time. It was a rather, short amount of time, but Draco didn’t mind. It was just too fucking good to mind at all, really.
Draco sighs deeply. He couldn’t put this off forever, and he’d be damned if he let this tear them apart.
Draco walks over to help him with the harness, but the first thing he did was slip a black collar around his neck. Harry flushed with heat and goosebumps broke out. It was strange that something so restrictive could make him feel so safe and wonderful. And he gets to wear it for two full days. His cock instantly hardens to full mast. He loved it when Draco slipped on the collar. It was his favorite part. It meant he was
It was late morning by the time they got to the breakfast table. Thankfully, it was all set up already by the house elves. The morning paper was waiting for him, as always, on the side of the table, but Draco ignored it in lieu of going over his case files.
“After the show you put on for me today, I can understand why.”
Harry seemed to think he was in control again, not letting a single moan or gasp escape. He thought he was going to get through this without cumming, but he forgot who he was dealing with. Draco bends his knees and angles his cock directly against his prostate, over and over again, for several minutes. Finally Harry lets out a strangled “Umph,” and a jet of pre-cum spurts onto the sheets.
After lunch, they chatted on the couch. Harry told him about his disturbing childhood and Draco’s heart broke. It was hard to believe that the confident brutish man before him was once a neglected, underfed, and under-loved child who was forced to sleep in a cupboard. It made his heart expand for him, even more.
Blaise wasn’t listening. He strolled behind Draco’s desk and bent down to kiss him, but Draco put a hand on his chest to stop him.
He gasps in anger when he realizes Harry’s already slick with lube. Using his forearm to push the back of his neck into the wooded wall, he twists his right arm behind his back.
“I warned you before this started, Potter, that this was suppose to be casual. Separating from Astoria is not possible. We should end this, now,
He thrust his index finger inside gently. Harry relaxed enough to allow a second finger, then a third.
Draco practically melted at the feeling of his calloused hands caressing his body. Harry pulled him down to kiss him leisurely.
It didn’t take long; Draco stroked himself to a quick release, anxious to see his cream on Harry’s body. When he came in three long spurts, the white fluid covered Harry’s chest, glistening on his smooth skin. Harry gasped at the heat of Draco’s release, leaving a burning trail as it slid down his chest.
Harry quickly paid for the food and went upstairs, back to Draco’s office.
He holds Harry’s hips steadily so that he doesn’t fall back onto the floor. Harry works their cocks together with calloused hands until they’re both hard and groaning. He doesn’t understand how Draco’s dick just works all the time, even after a week of no sleep. The man’s libido is limitless.
Trying hard not to let his anger show, Draco tries to dissuade him from the topic.
mentioned he had such a possession. He was only realizing now that he never mentioned his money, at all. He was shocked as the weight of Draco’s wealth truly hit him, but he tried to play it cool, chuckling when he saw the name splashed in bold letters across the side.
Harry raised his eyebrows. He was very lucky Draco was not his Dom because he would have instantly bent him over his desk and spanked him hard enough for all his subordinates to hear.
Harry shakes his head and turns over, his back to Draco. This is the man Harry loves so fucking much it hurts, the man he wants to marry, the man he lets use his body day and night, yet he still belongs to someone else on paper. Usually he can suppress these feelings, but tonight he can’t.
__________________________________________________________
“You could say that.”
“I apologize for raising my voice. You should know that Scorpius is the nearest thing to my heart. No one will take him away from me.”
After going home for dinner and tucking Scorpius in bed, he decided to take a quick shower to take the edge off. He needed to toss off before meeting Blaise.
Draco looks down and realizes, to his horror, that he’s right.
“You don’t look sick.”
“Talk to me…you know it’s not your fault. People always hated me. I’ve been attacked while out with my family before.”
“You’re right. I’m sorry Draco. You’re the one that’s suppose to decide. I only just realized I’ve been going about this all wrong. I’m ready to submit to you. Please, I want to.”
“I thought you weren’t coming,” he said into his chest, as he embraced him.
He’s flying, feeling lighter. His orgasm gives him temporary reprieve from the weight of his pain. He thinks, in that moment, that he truly is his whore, because if this is all he’s offering…he’ll take it.
“That’s how I defeated Voldemort.”
The record shows
Draco crossed over to the dresser to get him some fresh lounge clothes and fresh boxers.
Blaise never got tired of the image as Draco’s cock was the most beautiful thing that he had ever seen, thick, sizable,
“Come.” Draco leads him up the stairs. Blaise follows two feet behind like the perfect submissive he is. When they’re in his bedroom, Draco strokes his arms lovingly.
“How are you going to keep him happy, exactly? By shoving his dick in your mouth?” He asked angrily.
Harry stayed true to his word. He arrived, within the hour, at the DMLE to help Draco process the werewolves. Draco refused to look at him.
“Tell me I’m your little bitch boy. Tell me I’m your cum slut,” Harry says hatefully.
“Eyes down, pet. You’ll be punished for that.”
“Ready.”
“Oh god, I’m gonna cum.”
“Fine. I’ll talk to Blaise this week, Wednesday, at the country club.”
Draco couldn’t reply as he was having a hard enough time trying to keep his moaning under control.
“I hate when people say that. How could you possibly know that?”
“Can I ask you a question?”
He needed to focus on his family.
When it was over, Harry rolled to lay aside Draco and started giggling madly.
Draco put his hands up to cover his ears to block the sound and closed his eyes.
Draco willed himself not to blush, holding onto his anger instead.
When their eyes connect, Draco yanks his chain to pull him down for a kiss, and it’s so sweet that Harry feels himself tearing up again. He gasps when Draco uses his leverage from his feet on the ground to thrust upwards and control the pace, and the tears vanish to be replaced by pounding pressure. Holding his ass up steadily, Draco drives up into him from below as if he’s punishing him, fast..faster. Harder. Harry strokes his cock desperately, gasping for air, feeling every pounding vibrate through his prostate to the rest of his body. All he could do is brace himself on Draco’s chest with his free hand as his climax rises up and his noises reach a fever pitch. He yells out his orgasm as jets of cum spurt over Draco’s chiseled stomach. Almost immediately, he feels his hole filling up with burning viscous heat, and this. This is his favorite part. Being filled with his hot seed.
It had been a whole day under attack, unbeknownst to Harry. The man had no idea how deeply he affected Draco.
and he feels dead inside.
Draco runs a hand through his soft hair. “You really are an ambivert, aren’t you Harry?”
Harry looked shell shocked. He wasn’t moving or speaking. He looked like someone who had just witnessed a horrific trauma and was going to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder for the rest of his life. Draco had to lead him to his chair so that he could sit down.
Of course, she loves him. Everyone loves Blaise, except for Harry. He had a sexy charisma that Draco has never found in another person. He could convince anyone to do anything.
Harry jumped on top of him and continued to pummel his face with his fists. Blaise was trying to protect himself with his hands, but eventually they fell limp to the ground. If he kept it up, he would end up killing Blaise with his bare hands.
His breaths feel…
Harry huffed, crossing his arms. He was going to lose Draco to Blaise or some other submissive bloke, at this rate. He felt helpless.
“It’s Harry…Admit it. Answer me.” Harry’s lustful demanding tone sent a wave of desire through him that shattered his pride.
“Stay still. I need this, right now.”
Draco wanted to leave his house, badly, but he didn’t have anywhere to go. He felt uncomfortable, being there. He felt like he was crawling out of his skin.
He shakes his head at himself before he walks through the door of his office. When he steps in, the blinds are drawn, plunging his office in darkness. He’s sure he left the shades open when he left. He furrows his brows in confusion and closes the door behind him.
Draco looked away and remained silent for a moment.
Harry smiled at him, supportingly, hoping he would open up, but Draco just shrugged his shoulders.
inside him. He almost wished Harry would just end things and put him out of this misery.
Draco ignores him and continues relentlessly, for a long time, his head buried in Harry's ass, massaging his prostate with his fingers, while licking the rim. He suddenly maneuvers his body to sit at the foot of the cross, between Harry's legs, to swallow his cock down while pushing hard against his prostate. Harry screams.
“Please, don’t tell me you fucked him.”
Draco opted for all black tonight, a fitted black button down and black trousers with black shoes. He left two buttons undone, exposing the inner part of his pale clavicles. He looked regal and foreboding. He knew fashion, and undoubtedly, black always looks best on blondes.
It didn’t mean anything though. Of course, it was on his mind; it had just happened this morning. He would forget all about it in a few days...maybe a few months, the most.
“I have served you honorably and well, sir. I ask for your support in this.”
Draco buried his face in his left hand, praying to all the gods for patience. His free hand was twitching on his wand.
“Let me take you upstairs and make it better, hm?” he said softly.
“You will never speak to me in that disrespectful tone, again. Is that understood?”
Harry drops his gaze away from Draco’s face and Draco takes his hand. “Let’s go upstairs so you can blow me like you promised.”
Blaise shook his head. After a minute, he thrust his ass backwards, yielding to him.
“And I don’t believe that for one second. I know you remember it. Don’t lie to me.”
He turned around, facing away from Harry, trying to gather his bearings. He couldn’t. He had lost control. He felt more unstable, than ever before.
“That’s faulty logic. I’m not as famous as you, but I still draw the crazies too. You can’t pit two potentialities against each other and say one wins. And also let me tell you something.” Harry wipes his face, his nostrils flaring as his jaw tics. “I wasn’t normal, any time we were apart. I couldn’t forget you ever, and I thought I was insane. I wasn’t fulfilled. I wasn’t peaceful. I was missing something, and that something was you. Not in vogue to say that, is it? Makes me sound a little crazy?”
He supposed that the elektra-complex was true, after all. All women just wanted to fuck some version of their father.
Master became slave.
That was all it took. He eased Harry off him gently and guided him to lie flat on his stomach.
Draco rolled his eyes, but it was too dark for Harry to see. Even if that weren't the case, he was too busy unbuckling Malfoy’s trousers, and pulling them down, along with his boxer briefs, to notice.
“No.” he chuckled, then forced himself to sober up. “Don’t go. Please sit.”
“You want to tell me what the hell is going on?”
Draco still wasn’t ready. His body was, but his brain needed to catch up. He held Harry back who frowned at being rebuffed. He needed to check on Blaise, anyway. It would be a perfect excuse to get out and clear his head.
Draco gets on his knees to stroke his thick erection, working him from base to tip, where he finds a slick bead of precum.
“That’s a good look on you. Can’t wait to see it again.” He smirked, cruelly,
“Impressed, yet?”
Harry had used him. Everything he said was a lie. Draco was mistaken to believe him, and he paid the price, not just with blood. The werewolves showing up, right after he was filled with Harry’s cum, was divine intervention. It was swift punishment for his rash mistake, a sign that what they did was wrong, no matter how good it felt at the time.
“Look at you. Preening over getting fucked hard enough to make buildings fall down.”
Draco was making more noise than usual this morning. Quiet gasps began to escape him until he finally shoved into Blaise’s mouth all the way to the hilt and held his cock there as he reached his peak.
I don't know how I missed that! I was too distracted by his clearly Italian name. Why did no one mention this to me in the hundreds of comments? This was a culturally insensitive mistake especially in 2020. Mea culpa.
“What’s the matter?”
Draco’s heart gave a strong thud and he shook his head ruefully. “It’s so true that it’s the Top who’s the slave.”
After they ordered, just coffee for Draco, and the classic full English breakfast for Harry, Draco began to fidget restlessly. Harry wasn’t talking, choosing to read his file instead. When the coffee, tea, and toast arrived, he took a sip of tea before saying,
They managed to slow it down, eventually, and gave him blood replenishing potions. They told Draco the clawed skin would never heal completely. He would bear the scars forever.
“Can I offer you something to drink?”
Unconsciously, he stepped forward to get a closer look and reached up to touch them. When Harry drew in a breath at the feeling of tenderness, he snatched his hand away, as if he had been burned. What was he doing? The firewhiskey had addled his brain. He needed to force himself to put distance between them. Draco stepped away and around the couch, using it as a physical barrier.
“Oh!” Harry jumped, clearly not expecting it, but Draco held him still, relishing how sensitive and responsive he was.
Harry was lost in thought for a moment, “I don’t know what you see in that guy.”
Harry said with anxious resignation.
Draco immediately springs to action. He straddles Harry, caressing his buttocks then leans down to prepare his hole with his tongue and fingers. Harry smacks his head away.
He had become his worst fear, the simpering fool, begging Harry for his affections. It could not be helped.
“Not a full bottle.”
He looked up when Draco came in, briefly, but didn’t stop punching. In fact, he began punching even harder.
Harry’s loud moan sent a vibration throughout his body. He was holding on better than Draco expected, though he was far from composed. He must really want that collar. Harry rocked away from the intrusion of Draco’s finger, presumably to protect his prostate. His panting and the slight sheen across his back and thighs gave him away as his body betrayed him.
“Oh?”
He owed her, this much. Though his baser instincts told him to punish her to the severest degree, she was still a wonderful mother to Scorpius. In the end, his son would suffer for his vengeful impulses.
The concierge told them about a Turkish bath close by that was a must-visit. Draco was pleased as
This is all he really wanted to hear. He needed Blaise to beg him.
Albus chuckled and released his hand. Then, Scorpius stepped closer and embraced him in a tight hug, which was returned. Draco grinned at Harry, behind his son’s back.
“I need to speak with you, now.”
Harry squirmed, feeling both humiliated and excited. Draco had not touched his cock, but when he guided Harry’s body down, he had trapped it with his muscular thighs. The rough tweed of his trousers rubbing his cock as Harry pumped his hips slightly was almost enough to push him over the edge.
Draco feels the tension from Harry ease a bit, but still feels a keen sense of protective possessiveness from Harry. Instead of annoying him, it only makes Draco feel cherished. It’s still slightly jarring to be faced with how much Harry truly loves him. He shows him every day, and Draco feels like he finally has his Harry back. His love is like a palpable forcefield protecting him at all times.
“There’s nothing to forgive. You weren’t yourself.”
“Malfoy, these are all wrong. You spelled the names of the werewolves incorrectly. This is a rookie mistake. We have to redo the entire report now. Do you think I have nothing better to do, than to be stuck in your gods-forsaken office, all afternoon?”
“Harry, did you hear what I said?”
“Am I hurting you?”
He went up the stairs to call it a night, though it was only 9pm. The silence in the manor felt oppressive. He went into his walk-in closet to get changed and conducted his nightly ritual of running his fingers along Harry’s clothes. He still had not picked them up. Draco breathed in his head auror uniform and was assaulted with his oaky scent. Memories plundered his mind and he closed his eyes against them, but they played like a movie, in his head.
Harry did not have a set partner as he was the Head Auror. He was not required to go on field missions, but he would always go for high profile cases, and he would always choose Draco as his partner. As a result, Draco was left without an official partner, but everyone knew that Draco was Harry’s
After scoping the scene, he immediately began to move towards the door with reckless abandon. Draco dragged him back by his robes harshly, but Harry resisted, intending to simply barrel through. Draco had to pin him down to the ground by his wrists, his body flush against him as he spat,
He spends the entire week talking himself into doing the unthinkable to Blaise, until finally Saturday afternoon arrives, and he can’t put it off any longer. Blaise has brought this upon himself, left him no choice. Draco tried everything to convince him, and he refused. Now, he has to pay the price, but Draco knows instinctively, that he’s the one who will pay, in the end.
He knocked softly, and entered. When Harry caught sight of him, his whole body tensed, and he kept his eyes down.
Now, he knew why Blaise always preferred to be the bottom. Draco bowed his head as his legs began to shake. He tried desperately to hold his moans back, but he was mostly failing.
“I have to get back to the manor soon. Scorp is waiting up for me.”
When he arrived at Blaise’s room in St. Mungo’s, he was relieved to find him awake. He looked weak, but he was chatting with Pansy who held his hand, at his bedside. His eye was healed.
They redressed themselves and headed into the dining room for dinner. Steak was on the menu tonight, with numerous sides, and treacle tart for dessert. Draco had the elves make it special for Harry, knowing it was his favorite.
“You want me in you.”
and waves his hand underneath the table to clean the cum off his leg.
Draco shook his head sadly.
Draco tipped him off his lap onto the floor, before pulling Harry up to sit on his knees, his sore bottom hanging safely off his thigh. He wrapped his arms around him.
“You smell like a wild boar.”
“Listen Harry, work is the most important thing in my life right now. I need it to stay constant because I can’t imagine doing anything else. I know, for you, becoming an auror was smooth sailing, but you have no idea how hard I’ve worked to get to this point, how hard I work still, to keep myself here. I’m still hated in the Wizarding world. I know it’s hard for someone like you to understand what that’s like, but this is all I have. I’m not seeing Blaise anymore, but I can’t let anything get in the way of what I have here, which is why we can never repeat what happened in Turkey. I know where this could go, but I’m not you.
They ate in silence for a little while.
It wasn’t too crowded. The sand was soft underneath his feet and he inhaled the fresh air as he looked out at the crystal clear blue waters. He saw land masses in the distance and short mountainous areas lining the far edges of the beach with houses perched atop.
“I’m here, Father!”
His rage was so potent that he took out his wand and pointed it at the breakfast table. All the glasses and plates shattered into hundreds of pieces. The dining room table cracked in two and caved inwards. He pointed his wand at the walls and fired at will, shattering the glass windows. He destroyed everything in sight.
He didn’t take it. Instead, he put a hand on his shoulder.
Draco looked up at Astoria who smiled at this and gave Draco a delicate kiss on the cheek, saying “Welcome home, darling.” Draco hugged her and kissed her cheek in return.
When he exits, he feels an electric shock of paralyzing anguish and his legs won’t hold him. He sinks to the floor against the wall right outside the door. Holds his face in his hands. Tears stream down his face as he listens to Blaise’s screaming sobs. The fact that he’ll only be in there for thirty minutes doesn’t comfort him because Blaise doesn’t know that. He eventually stops calling for him and starts calling for his house elf, Pippy. She doesn’t come. When Blaise starts pleading for his dead mother, Draco realizes he has to get out of there or he risks losing any semblance of sanity.
Instead, he fumed and walked out of the door, slamming it shut behind him.
He washed his face in the sink, bracing himself for what was to come. He did not feel any different, but he knew the potion took time to work. Even if it didn’t work, he seriously doubted he would have an issue fucking Blaise tonight. He was reawakening Draco’s dominant side. Draco had not fully entered his dominant role in quite some time, and he found himself looking forward to it.
“Don’t.” Blaise’s voice cracked.
“Yes, Neech. That will be fine.”
“Monsieur Malfoy. Always so excited,” he teased. Draco drew in a breath when Harry’s warm calloused hand caressed his cock through his briefs.
Draco’s cock hardened to full mast. Blaise always knew just what to say to get the blood pumping south. He brought the whip down with medium strength five times and Blaise didn’t make a sound though the red marks were prominent. He didn’t even flinch.
“Yes, sir.”
“Shut up, Potter, no more talking.”
“You won’t need to. Just going to pop in to take the potion, grab a snack, and come back. You’ll be okay?”
“Because I looked you in the eye, sir.”
Draco had never known anyone so brave and good. He suddenly felt awed by him, remembering his cowardly self at seventeen. He knew why people venerated him wherever he went, but it hit him harder now. Without him, the whole world would be in the hands of a tyrant. Harry was the great liberator of their generation, destined for greatness as only a baby. He was suddenly saddened by the fact that Harry was choosing to spend his time with someone like him. He deserved better, someone good, loyal, and brave, like him. Draco was none of those things.
When he arrived, Harry was preening himself in the parlor mirror. He was beautifully dressed in tight fitting black plaid trousers and a crisp white button-down shirt. Upon closer inspection, Draco realized he used Veela potion on his hair to get it to lie flat in soft waves. He wasn’t wearing his glasses.
Blaise is his best friend, his most trusted and loyal confidant. Out of all of Draco’s friends, Blaise was the only one Draco considered a true equal. He was exceedingly wealthy, good looking, from a great pureblood family, and had a wicked sense of humor that Draco enjoyed very much.
“Good boy. That’s better. The paddle hurts more. Are you ready for it?”
“Would you like something to drink?”
“I need it, every night.”
He did not want to go back to Blaise’s mansion as he would be home by now, and didn’t want to have to explain himself.
Harry sighed and moved. He slid one of his hands down his body and covered Draco’s hand with it, giving it a light squeeze, but his eyes stayed closed and his body pliant as Draco took him.
Harry could tell in Draco's tone that it was anything but wonderful to him.
Harry looks up sharply, but catches himself before he eyes get above Draco’s waist. He could tell he wants to protest, but he just sighs and lowers his eyes to the floor again. He wasn’t relaxed entirely, but he seemed ready to listen.
Anxiety started to swell in his body, but he tried to hold it off. He needed to think of other people’s interests over his own. He had been a selfish prick for too long. How could he possibly deny Blaise a family, when it is what he has been pushing him towards, for over ten years?
“Harry?” His feline grey eyes are wide, his perfect Draco face troubled. “Baby, what’s wrong?”
Draco wakes up before Harry, thankful for the opportunity to study his beautiful face in sleep, one of his favorite hobbies. He takes in his long dark lashes and mess of dark hair on the pillow. He can’t help but stroke his pouty lips. But his face is clenched as if he’s suffering, even in sleep. It’s a new look and Draco knows he hardly slept last night. He stayed awake a long time listening for the sound of his even breathing, but it never came. He wanted to hold him so badly but felt a broodiness from him the entire night. Harry was hiding something from him. He feared that he was overwhelmed with their new arrangement and wanted to give him space to think. Still, his pet deserved a reward for his performance yesterday.
Draco rolled away, panting himself, but one hand was already reaching for the lube.
“I can feel it,” Blaise says wistfully. “As if you could get any sexier. Trying to torture us poor sods?” Grabbing his lower waist tightly, he starts kissing his neck from behind. His hand starts inching down, towards Draco’s cock.
“I can’t do that. I can’t just throw away twenty years of friendship for a hot, secret affair.”
Draco looks at Harry, taking in his worried, vulnerable expression. It takes a minute to understand what it means through his alcohol addled brain, then it dawns on him.
Even today when he told the story of the underwater kiss, his eyes softened at the memory, and it was like taking the
would heal it because it was from a curse, not trauma. They had to shave his head to get the magic to penetrate better, and Harry fears is that he’ll end up like professor Lockhart with no memory of him. Harry can’t stand to rest his eyes on his face, gashed like mad-eye moody, his gorgeous body, propped up in such an odd position, held at the right angles by magic.
“Listen, Draco…”
“You have the most perfect ass and its all mine. I’m the luckiest guy in the world.”
_____________________________________________________________________
Harry buried his fingers in Draco’s hair and guided him gently, to increase the pace. Draco obliged, deep throating him with every gulp and his moans became loader.
Harry finally faces him, hoping his face isn’t betraying too much emotion.
Harry nodded, getting his breathing back under control. “Thank you, Draco.”
Draco could not believe Harry’s brash rudeness. The man had absolutely no tact. This was a delicate matter and his best friend, not Harry’s. It wasn’t for Harry to decide how to break the news. That responsibility fell to Draco, and Draco alone.
“How long is that going to take? You're making last night into more than what it was. I was playing up the sounds, for your benefit. You haven’t cum inside me since those nights in Turkey. That was months ago. I need it. Please, I need to feel you filling me up.”  He begged.
Draco let out a long breath when he left the safe room. He was slipping.
He cast a cleaning charm on himself, pulled up his pants and sat down, facing Harry.
“Of course, I do, but I don’t want you to feel forced.”
He lowered his voice to a near whisper and bent his head conspiratorially so that Draco had to lean in to hear him, their faces almost touching,
“Oh, I plan to,” he grins mischievously.
Are you in?”
“Haven’t. Since the war.”
Draco settled back on the bed next to him and Harry turned his body away, once more. He heard Draco’s breathing even out, indicating that he was asleep. Harry was not so lucky. He stayed awake all night, trying to think of new ways to keep his blond dragon at his side, forever.
Draco didn’t know what to say. His first instinct was to instantly reject him, but he couldn’t do that. What reason would he give? He didn’t want Blaise to know about Harry, after he so recently told him it was over between them. He would look like a liar or worse, weak. Besides, he and Harry were casual, no matter what it felt like when they were together. The terms were set. It wasn’t as if they were an exclusive couple in a relationship. Using Blaise as buffer between them would be good for him. Things were always too intense between them, even with Draco as the top.
“When we get to the table, stand behind my chair, unless I tell you to sit, okay?”
“You can go fuck yourself, Potter. I’m done with you. You’re a pompous prick and a liar. I’m going home. Don’t follow.”
When he heard Harry’s belt clanking, confirming that he was, at least decent, he walked towards the door. It was still locked. He needed to escape. He tried again, but it only rattled on its hinges. He bent his head low, waiting. Nothing happened.
Even though he thinks he’d been with his assistant. Even though he told him not to come near him at the DMLE.
“Fine, then. Fire me.”
Faster and faster Harry drove into him, angling purposely at the place he knew his prostate to be. Draco felt pleasure paralyzing every cell in his body. He was lost in a sea of desire, no longer thinking of anything, only feeling. Little electric shocks made him shake and shiver every time Harry hit his sweet spot. Harry, feeling dangerously close to the edge, already, used one hand to stroke Draco’s cock to completion. It only took ten firm strokes and Draco was shooting his thick load all over his own stomach. Harry moaned at the feeling of those tight inner muscles clenching around him and buried his head in Draco’s armpit as he pounded into him, hard, for another full minute, holding the back of his neck for leverage. He shouted through his own orgasm as it tore out of him and filled Draco to the brim with his cum, pumping in shallow strokes, long after it was over. Finally, he went limp, leaning his whole weight on top Draco, trying to catch his breath. Draco didn’t mind. He could fall asleep with Harry’s cock inside him. That feeling of fullness that Harry gave him, his heavy weight resting on top of him, was the best feeling in the world.
The fire burning in the hearth was heaven to Draco. Their warming charms weren’t enough to stave off the cold.
Draco steps towards the bed and pulls off the sheet to slowly reveal Harry’s naked body, still too skinny and frail.
“Just reading.”
Harry chuckles. “I have been a prat, haven’t I?”
Suddenly, Draco heard the floo activate from the adjacent room across the foyer and Blaise’s voice rang out.
“I’ve known how to get through your wards since I was thirteen years old.”
The weeks that followed were not as bad as Draco expected. He imagined that being made love to by Harry, freely and openly, every night and every morning, made all the difference. Harry slept at the manor every single night, except on the weekends he had Scorpius. He still needed quality time with his son, but planned on integrating Harry into his family life, after some time had passed. He still did not tell him he loved him, but showed him he loved him in the bedroom.
Harry moved forward to kiss him, sensually, and grope his body. He pushed his boxers down and Draco’s cock flopped out. It was completely soft, but he quickly stroked it to hardness.
Harry turned around to lie flat on his back and pulled Draco up to kiss him.
“Absolutely lovely. Now, from here I can play with your ass, your balls…I can spank you, fuck you, flog you. When I say ‘present’ you immediately drop and arrange yourself like this.”
“Fine.”
“What happened?”
He couldn’t get the image of Harry’s face splattered with his cum out of his head. It kept playing on a loop, on repeat in his mind, like a photograph in the Daily Profit.
Harry puts a hand over his face.
“What about this morning?”
On the third night he’s back, Blaise materializes in his floo. He looks…different, older somehow. Looking at Draco with pure loathing, he holds up an old piece of parchment in his hand. The edges are frayed and it’s completely yellowed. Draco realizes it’s the contract. He sets it down on the table without saying a word and pulls his wand out.
“Umph!” Harry exclaims as he lands, waving a hand behind him.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry stopped at the parlor door. He expected to be stopped. He kept his body turned away from Draco.
Neech had already drawn them a bath in the tub and it smelled heavenly in Draco’s bathroom.
Harry lies quickly. “You guys are a bunch of twisted fucks. What’s he need a Dom for that badly anyway?”
Blaise nodded again.
Draco moved to get passed him, but Harry held him back.
“Are you mental? We can’t do this at work.”
“How’s your back baby?”
“I’m afraid I’ve already made my decision.”
Nothing.
Hermione was right this morning when she was talking to Draco in the kitchen. Harry’s not himself. Not during the few hours he goes into the DMLE each day, and not when he’s here with Draco.
Draco turned his head to hide a blush and Harry hesitated.
He respects Harry. His needs should be fulfilled, all of them. He deserves the world, not an ex-deatheater who constantly brings him to tears. He’s Harry and Draco fucking loves him, but this will never work.
Harry released him in pure shock, dumbstruck. He wasn’t expecting him to say yes.
“I can’t. I’m married. Astoria.”
“You’re not in the right emotional state to endure the collar, Harry. For the hundredth time, I’m not comfortable with it after what happened the other night.”
“Yes…there...Crave it all the time…oh. right there….You fill me up so good.”
Harry thought he might pass out from anticipation as warm fingers inserted themselves into the elastic waistband of his boxers, sliding around his waist before pulling the boxers down to his knees.
“We’re taking this for the stake out.”
“Shouldn’t you be tending to your little bitch boy, about now?”
“I’m not fulfilling my contractual obligations. I’ve been a right prick to you. Don’t you think it’s better that you release yourself from the contract so that you’ll be free to choose someone you can actually be with. Someone who could make you happy.”
“You’re stronger than you look.”
Draco’s eyes widened at the motion. This wasn’t his Harry. Something was wrong with him. He squeezed his eyes shut to the horror above him but felt Harry’s copious sweat dripping all over his body as he reamed into his hole.
“That’s wonderful to hear and admirable too. Torture is on the agenda tonight, to be sure.”
By the time Harry gets up, weak and shaking, it’s already
“You’re never late. What kept you?”
Harry doesn’t even try to deny it. “You know what I want.”
Draco pauses. It finally enters his lust hazed mind that this is not good. His cock is aching and leaking, but he knows he needs to stop.
Blaise had to adjust his trousers now, and Draco finally noticed his erection. He cock sprang to full hardness at Draco’s words, and he was trying to hide it. He crossed his legs. He focused on the grandfather clock to his right, as if trying to tell the time.
He stares at Harry’s red-striped back silently willing him to understand how much he loves him and to turn around. When that doesn’t work, he reaches for his wand with the purposes of healing him, thankful that the collar is off and he’s allowed to do so. Waving his wand, he heals him with a nonverbal spell, causing Harry to flip around suddenly and grab his wand wrist, squeezing hard.
That stung his pride. Harry never attacked his work ethic in the past, yet here he was, degrading him in front of some newbie auror, ten years his junior.
It appeared Harry was losing patience, even though his tone was calm. He sounded intimidating and could indeed overcome Draco. Yet, he knew they were empty threats. Harry would never really hurt him.
His rage had boiled over from Blaise’s blasé attitude all night. He didn’t care if he was being crass or offensive. How dare Blaise speak to him, in such a manor? Did he forget who his true master was?
“What the FUCK do you want, Potter?”
“Oh merlin, fucking hell. oh gods, no.” Harry shook and spread his legs a bit further. Draco could feel him try to resist the movement and his grin broadened, his tongue lapping delicately at its goal.
Draco took a swing of his firewhiskey to wash the bad taste out of his mouth.
He did not think it beneath him, rather, he just wasn’t wired that way. Some people were meant to wield the crop and others were born to feel its sharp sting. Blaise was such a person. Draco firmly believed that Harry, most likely, fell in neither of these categories. He was not at the far end of either kinky spectrum, and that was okay. It was not for everyone. He loved him anyway. He believed he could live his entire life sustained on Harry’s love alone. He was used to living a life of control and denying his baser needs.
Draco fucked him in this manner for another hour, straight. He never heard Blaise’s safe word. Instead, he came again, midway through. Draco had cum thrice in this position already and was about to cum a fourth time. Left over cum squeezed out around his cock, flooding the outside of Blaise’s hole, dripping down his balls. It stained the bed beneath them and stuck on his cock as he pulled out and thrust back in. There was cum everywhere.
Draco’s lips curl in a sad smile. “I don’t know. But I can guess.”
______________________________________________________
Harry reared his head back to look at him, surprised by this request.
Harry could apparently sense his anger and didn’t make a reply. Instead, he stood up and embraced him.
It was bad enough being hopelessly in love with the old Draco. The strict auror. The loving father. Lover of horses. The smooth pureblood businessman with all his compassion, charisma, and wit. Harry feels his heart expanding as everything else shrinks inside him. He suddenly regrets bringing forth this dominant Draco because now, he feels like...a slave.
Harry gave him an incredulous smile.
Draco put the whip away and tried to push down his cock which was tenting his trousers. A dark spot had formed, but he was wearing black so it was not noticeable. He came back and stroked his ass again.
“What happened to your wrist Zabini?”
Draco crawled up next to him and forced him on his side. He cast the preparation charms, adding an extra protection spell, and immediately breeched his entrance with his painfully hard cock. He sighed in relief at the tight squeezing feeling, and entered him fully with the first jab. Blaise, involuntarily, tried to eject him.
“How could I forget? 5th year. 90 seconds, personal best…bet we can go for longer, if we try…”
Speaking of, “Blaise, I have to ask a huge favor from you. Is it okay if I stay in your manor for a few days? Something’s come up.”
“Yes, maybe we should talk. Let’s talk about why in the bleeding fuck you were canoodling with Potter over breakfast. Since when are you two so close? I thought you hated him. Tell me now and tell me true. Are you fucking him?”
Blaise winced when his backside touched the sheets and he turned around to lie flat on his stomach instead. His chaffed wrists were resting on the pillow on either side of his head.
“I didn’t know you get migraines.”
He curled up behind him, cradling him against his softening cock. They fit better this way because Draco was much taller than him. It took only minutes for Harry’s breathing to even out into a deep sleep.
He wanted to be home in time to tuck in Scorpius. Besides, he had just fucked Blaise eight ways from Sunday this past weekend and had an interlude with him this morning. Worst of all, his mind was full of Harry.
“Don’t you dare mention my wife! And you think just because Zabini’s out of the picture, I’ll be your bloody experiment!?”
Now was as good a time as any. He hoped Blaise wouldn’t make a scene. He knew better than that.
Harry seemed to understand and got into position. He rubbed his cock teasingly across his hole for a few long moments, then suddenly, flipped Draco around so that he lay on his back, facing him, again. He lay on top of him, caressing his cheek with one hand and kissing him.
Harry has never been away from him this long, and Draco misses him so much that it feels like a physical ache. Without his warmth, Draco hardly sleeps at night. It dawns on him that it’s more than just love, Harry is essential to his survival.
He had not come here for this.
Draco flushed crimson with shame.
Draco was running out of excuses. With Potter so close, his judgement was being clouded. He searched his brain for a legitimate excuse.
“Shacklebolt called me in.”
He grinned at his corny greeting. He heard rushed footsteps and Harry burst through the parlor. His face broke into a large, handsome grin as he embraced Draco, crushing his bones. Draco was instantly assaulted by his familiar oaky scent. He melted against his warmth and his strong arms. He instantly felt better and memories of the weekend quickly quieted, dipping lower to his subconscious where he would not have to think of them again.
“Why are you so good to me, huh?”
“Give it to me. I fuckin’ love feeling your hot cum inside me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco snorts.
It took a few strokes for Draco to bury himself to the hilt. He held still, waiting for him to adjust, focusing
As Draco climbed the stairs, Blaise wrapped his arms around his neck and cooed softly.
While Harry spends the day away, Draco is seized with the desire to visit Blaise to find out how it went with David. No matter his hesitancy, he loves Harry too much to lose him over this. Feeling Harry’s pain keenly last night makes him want the contract gone, once and for all. He floo calls Blaise and is relieved to see him returned from France. He asks after Pansy.
“Does that please you, sir?”
“I just need a shower. I’ll be down in a moment,” he told Harry.
Harry looked up, contemplating Draco’s brooding figure and said, “You’re really great with your son.”
“Go to sleep.”
“Ginny and I are separated, and I…”
. You’re so tight, baby. I missed this.”
“I can’t. I love him.”
“I’ll see you at the office in an hour.”
He felt he deserved this, but couldn’t help begging for him to stop, anyway.
“Or maybe you’ve used up all your cum on Blaise. Is that what this is really about? I saw you two sitting in the alcove for lunch together, the other day, happy as two peas in a pod. I saw you grab his hand. I know what it means, and for the record, I did not say a word to you about it. I just need to know. Do you wish Blaise was sleeping next to you instead?”
He paused.
“Blaise, I didn’t divorce Astoria to be with Potter. Are you mad? She was stealing money from my accounts to sustain a secret lover. I’m not even with him, anymore.”
“ I love how you taste…I can’t get enough…no matter how many times I have you, I want more.”
As their Wednesday evening drinks night wrapped up and it started to get late, Draco got up to wish Blaise farewell.
“Was there something you needed, Potter? We’re kind of in the middle of something.” Blaise asked, in the same brash tone Harry usually used with him.
Harry doesn’t answer, so Draco comes around in front of him. His head is bowed. He moves between him and the shower wall and pulls him against his chest, wraps his arms around him.
“Look at me.”
Draco’s resolve was crumbling, as rapidly as his cock was hardening. He expected Harry to fight him on this.
Harry shakes his head sadly, as if he's the one that's the drunken fool.
He turned on the spot and disapparated them both straight into the bedroom. With a snap of his fingers, their clothes were gone and Harry climbed on top of Draco.
“You really don’t get it, do you? I want you with me, only me, all the time. Did my insane act of jealousy not prove that to you?”
He also brings Hermione and Ron around Draco more, and is surprised that Hermione gets along particularly well with Draco. Her eyes sparkle at him like she admires him. Even Ron isn’t averse to him. He learns later that Draco and Hermione have an owl correspondence and somehow became friends during his stay at St. Mungo’s.
The house elves were falling all over themselves. They usually didn’t like when people entered the kitchens while they they were working, as Scorpius often did, but they were acting as if the Queen of England had arrived.
Draco turns on his back and starts to jerk off, the same way he’s done in the shower for the last week. Harry rolls over to face him. For a second, Draco thinks he’s gotten lucky. Then he gets down off the bed and heads to the closet.
Draco groaned as he got up to open the door and was surprised to see Harry on the other side. He had a coffee in his hand and wore a wide smile that reached his eyes.
“Sir, it’s embarrassing,” Harry said earnestly. He wished he was wearing his collar; it made him feel brave.
“Let me make myself clear. What happened, earlier today, in the parlor will never happen again. I can guarantee to you that we will have another fight, but you can never use sex as a form of punishment. If that ever happens again, we’re done.”
“Such a tease, you’re gonna kill me if you don’t fuck me right now. It could be quick.”
“It’s fine.”
Purposely trying to make Draco miserable. He storms into the parlor, pouring a generous helping of firewhiskey and takes it down like a shot. He pours another and sits down, staring at the fire broodingly.
“I said I’m tired, not dead,” he says with a half smile.
He felt Harry licking and kissing his neck before picking up speed. Draco clutched the back of the couch as hard as he could to brace himself against Harry’s fast punishing strokes.
“Thank you. You can go now. I know you’re needed for the spattergroit crisis.”
Draco knows he should feel freed. But he doesn’t. As the days pass, he finds that he feels…tangled.
“Ask me for what you want.”
Suddenly, Harry moved off him and lay flat on the bed besides him, spreading his legs wide open and pushing up his ass, an invitation to Draco.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco was clutching his heart. Adrenaline was surging through him.
“You were really sick, Harry.”
They decided to go into the Ministry, on a Saturday, because there was still so much work to be done. Harry had managed to change into a different head auror uniform when he returned to the ministry the previous night and used a freshening charm on it, for good measure. Draco’s clothes certainly were not going to fit him.
He forced himself to think of him now, and eventually regained control. This was for Blaise, alone, not for him. He went over to the drawers to retrieve a medium sized flogger. This wouldn’t hurt him or leave a bruise, but it would sting, smartly. He would feel it for a few days.
Moaning throughout, Draco keeps up a litany of “mine, mine, mine.”
He used his wand to light Draco’s letter on fire with an
It was an idle threat. He would only go after Nott. Astoria was still the mother of his child. He could never do that to her.
Harry suddenly stepped forward and knelt at Draco’s feet.
“Yes. That is usually how people communicate.”
Draco looked down at the table.
He merely flipped him over onto his back, and drilled into him from above, holding one leg open. Harry stared into his eyes with permeating power, and he could hardly stand it. He abruptly flipped him over, forcing him up on all fours, and began ramming him from behind. Their thighs smacked loudly together as he increased his pressure and pace. He leaned over to grab him by his hair, forcing his head back, as he delivered brutal deep thrusts.
“You’re pathetic, Draco! You could’ve chosen anyone. You could’ve chosen me, but it just had to be
“Is that thing going to stay in all night? It feels good, but kind of uncomfortable.”
“…but it just happened, and I’m so sorry. This just started between us, and we never had the exclusive talk. I wasn’t thinking, and it didn’t mean anything. You have to believe me when I tell you that you’re all I want. Blaise is threatening to tell the press the truth, and I just didn’t want him so upset. I promise that it will never happen again.”
Harry bites his throat. “Good.”
Draco sighed. He resented the fact that Harry knew about this. Blaise was his secret, and his alone. He managed to keep it under wraps for 15 years and it just had to be
Harry’s first words to him when they entered his bedroom were,
He broke from his grip and began to dress himself. He needed to get out of there.
“Take off your jeans,” Draco commanded.
“You can. So am I. We can keep it casual, just like you and Blaise were. Let me show you how good it could be.”
Harry hugs him from behind and he instantly melts into his touch. It’s enough to vanquish his doubts and worries, and he hates himself for it. His skin burns where Harry’s lips rest on his neck. A few minutes go by with Harry just holding him.
“No, pet,” he scolded. “Not like that.”
it’s like the sound of synchronized bells, just so fucking beautiful. He’s wasted for him. Draco begins to make strides to his door, without so much as a kiss, but before he leaves, Harry has to know.
In the past, his two modes had been to treat Draco like his old chum from school, or to treat Draco like his worst enemy, no better than vermin. He had been opting for the latter in these many weeks, and Draco was reaching his boiling point. This was more or less, typical, of their relationship. They would often go through these waves of hatred. These phases ebbed and flowed like a river.
“Yes what?”
Draco was sorely tempted but held his ground. He promised himself he would not cheat on Harry, even if it was not possible he would ever find out. Draco would know and the guilt would eat him alive. This was Harry’s biggest fear, that Draco would cheat on him with some submissive bloke, and he loved him too much to have that fear realized.
“Oh, I bet nothing happened, you sick, twisted fuck. I bet you didn’t stick your prick into one of those pathetic loser submissives that were drooling all over themselves for you. I saw the way they were looking at you as you led me on your little leash...You have Blaise. You have me. Who knows what other whores you keep? Fuck you,
Draco rocked minutely back and forth, to milk Harry’s every last drop. Harry’s abs trembled with little aftershocks.
At first, Harry doesn’t realize that the clomps he hears are footsteps. Then, Draco’s right in front of him, an apparition, immaculate from head to toe. He looks like he stepped off a runway in France, and Harry can’t stand how beautiful he looks.
Ten minutes later, there was a soft knock and Harry entered, eyes downcast. Draco felt the blanketing of a silence charm and the door lock.He immediately fell to his knees, arms behind his back, eyes to the floor, seemingly waiting for Draco’s orders. Fighting a grin, Draco stood and walked closer to circle him like a predator. Stopping in front of him, he crouched low.
Suddenly, there was a small voice from behind Harry that Draco loathed to hear. A good looking bloke with dirty blonde hair and light brown eyes had joined the Auror forces recently, and Harry was training him, personally. He had come highly recommended, passing all the Auror exams with top marks.
“Yesterday will never happen again, Harry. Not ever. Not even close.”
“Tell me.”
Harry laughs—tries to. “I’m not fucking lying, Draco. I don’t give a shit if we talk at work or not.”
They rutted against each other, hard. Groping each other everywhere, they kissed with pure emotion, but they remained fully clothed. Draco felt mad with lust as their erections pressed against each other through their pants. Neither bothered to remove each other’s clothes. He wondered if they could both cum like this. Their grinding together was an unnaturally pleasant sensation.
He was met with livid storm grey eyes when he turned around. Though he smiled internally, he gave him a wide eyed surprised look, like a deer caught in the headlights.
Draco’s penis shot out a clear stream of pre-cum on Harry’s belly. Harry used one hand to swipe his finger through it and licked it clean.
“Does that mean we’re finally in a relationship?” Harry asked, grinning.
She had come from a very old line of pureblood wizards with immense wealth, old money. Unfortunately, her father was a very foolish man who gambled all their galleons away betting on horse races and quidditch matches. They were left with nothing but a good title and a good name when Draco decided to marry her.
Shacklebolt sat at his desk, reading Draco’s formal request for transfer to Paris.
Draco watched the green flames with a crushing feeling of guilt. That guilt quickly morphed into anger, towards the marked man sitting in his dining room.
When they sat for dinner that night in Draco’s dining room, Harry came down the stairs from his shower to the red collar glittering invitingly in its velvet box. A contract sat next to it with a quill and both their wands lay on the table. The sight thrilled him.
“Fucking hell, yes,” he gasps, squeezing Harry’s bum closer to impale himself. Harry teases his hole more, the tip catching the rim.
After only a couple minutes, Draco was surprised to find that his own orgasm was approaching. Harry seemed to sense this and pushed off abruptly causing Draco to groan in disappointment. He slid up his body to kiss him instead, plundering his mouth with his tongue. He felt Harry’s erection bump his thigh, surprised the man was hard again so soon.
“Oh god…I’m getting close…I’m gonna cum.”
He turned the shower on and got in, making it scorching hot, to burn away his sins.
“That’s Auror Potter, to you,” he spat.
“Lot of cream, lots of sugar, right?"
Draco’s wound up tight when he arrives at Grimmauld Place that night, and Harry’s nowhere in sight. Fear and fury mix as he stalks through the house. When he pushes open the bedroom door and finds it dark, a wall of dread slams into him. Then, he hears the springs creak.
They sat in silence while Draco read. He could feel Harry staring at him, but he wasn’t looking up.
“Listen, I’ve had a lot of time to think, and I realized
“You can always count on daddy to punish his naughty boy.”
“Listen, obviously I haven’t told anyone and never will. You can trust me Draco. Are you two in love?”
“Dinner is served, masters. Shall I call the children?”
He didn’t know what to do about Harry. He did not want him to feel pity towards Draco. Draco’s cock stirred remembering all the many ways they had made love yesterday. It was all so beautiful, until the very end. Only their last encounter was disagreeable to him, but he couldn’t be blamed. It was the poison.
_____________________________________________________________________
He could almost imagine it was Harry himself, as their hair texture and color were similar. He closed his eyes as Blaise brought him to full hardness quickly, deep-throating him, every other suck, stroking his own cock in the process. It felt wonderful but, even this felt wrong somehow. Harry wasn’t this skilled at sucking cock. His fumbling erratic movements were missing.
It’s a beautiful sunny Saturday, and the park is packed full of wizarding families and their children. Draco sets up the blanket for them under an oak tree and sits cross legged as Harry lays his head in his lap, staring up at him. Draco never looks sexier than when he’s reading a book. Birds are chirping in the background as slivers of light stream through the tree leaves catching his golden blonde hair.
“Yeah.”
He smelled delicious tonight. His scent was burned into his hippocampus and it was like a trigger. It was that musky masculine scent, and he was wearing a cologne tonight that seemed to amplify it. Draco’s mouth watered and he swallowed.
His hypocrisy burned when he remembered that he had, just recently, emphasized to Harry that one could never use sex as a form of punishment, yet here they were. Draco had whipped him into a bloody mess and brutally fucked him, with a heart full of vengeance. It would not be something Harry was likely to forget.
Draco’s eyebrows furrow in confusion.
Draco was shocked to hear his surname from his mouth. It sounded so wrong coming from him. It hurt.
“Sure,” he said flatly, not looking up from the report.
Draco feels something cool slip his finger. For the longest second, he can’t take a breath. His vision blurs and he blinks his teary eyes to look at him.
“Don’t forget I listen to begging,” he said with a smile, popping the lid on the lube again and making sure Harry saw it.
“Forget what I said. I apologize. I would just like for things to continue as they are. Please, darling? For Scorpius.”
When he was finished preparing him, he jumped to sit on top of him, straddling his lower back, facing towards his ass. It was raised and spread open completely, cum licking the rim. He squeezed it in his hands, rubbing his left over cum all around the rim and dipping into his hole. His spit on his hole, mixing the spit with his cum and continued to dip inside with his fingers. It was warm and wet. Draco groaned and slapped his ass hard, rocking on top of him. His cock was painfully hard again, but this needed to be done.
Harry’s cheek’s pressed against his shoulder. “It’s okay.”
This gave him pause. Draco was shocked at the information. He felt a weird, unpleasant sensation pass through his body at this news, but he couldn’t quite place it.
__________________________________________________________________
“Where to?”
Harry jolts and his coffee spills all over him, ruining his head auror robes.
In the bedroom, it was pleasurable enough, but in life, it could never work. He would always meet him toe-to-toe on everything, and this would just disintegrate into more fights which, essentially, would lead to another grizzly ending.
Draco’s muscles are all tensed, hunching towards him. It suddenly dawns on him. Harry’s potential discomfort is the cause of his grave face. Draco is worried that this would be too much for him. That it would push him away. Considering his new reality, he manages to stifle a grim laugh at how far away from that he truly is. How strange it is to think that Draco’s always felt like the helpless one, the one that was bending. The one without a choice. He remembers that Draco loves him, too. It wasn’t this sick slavery, but it was something.
Why did you move away from me in the bed?” He slaps and grabs his ass hard enough to hurt. Harry groans.
“Harry…” he warns.
“Bad dream?”
“Harry.”
He cast the lubrication charm on his own cock, spreading it around and threw his wand aside. Without hesitating, he thrust inside all the way to the hilt.
Blaise still had not moved from his uncomfortable position. He winced when Draco gently adjusted his legs to their normal straight posture. They hung lamely off the bed now. Draco lay back on the bed and gently nudged Blaise up so that he lay next to him. His head was turned away. Draco undid his blindfold and stroked his hair, down to his back and up again.
He gets to the door and knocks. There’s no answer. Draco makes a vain attempt to open it. He tries the knob. It turns. It can’t
Draco was frustrated; the connection they had while fucking on his yacht all day seemed to disappear as Harry became speechless and uncomfortable.
He suddenly reared up on his knees and grasped Draco’s ass cheeks for leverage, while he hammered inside. Every molecule in Draco’s body sang with pleasure. He was so close to cumming already, he could hardly believe it. He reached down to stroke his own cock, feeling close to the edge. Harry was brushing his prostate at every other stroke causing an electric shock to pass through his body, every time.
Harry would occasssionally invite him, but Draco would decline, not wanting to endure hateful glares from his colleagues, wondering what the hell he was doing there.
“Thank you, sir, but I want to. More than anything. I didn’t mean to make you doubt me.”
This went against all the rules. Though it was true sometimes a sub would act out purposely to receive punishment, they certainly never ‘demanded’ punishment. Draco had little patience for that. This was another example of topping from the bottom. Harry was forcing Draco, which took the fun right out of it. He was trying to control him.
“Guy deserves to know the truth. He doesn’t deserve your lies.”
Draco just keeps wielding the whip. The flogger’s
At that, Blaise stopped moving.
The glass shattered, pieces flying everywhere as Draco’s eyes shot open in anger.
Harry flexed and cracked his knuckles menacingly, one hand twitching on his wand. Draco would have been touched by his fierce possessiveness if he wasn’t struck with the horror of the sinking truth.
Then he magic proofs the room, so that even if Blaise were to summon his house elf, Pippy, she wouldn’t come. Blaise won’t be able to cast even the most minor spells, wandlessly.
Draco was shocked, dismayed, even. He knew Blaise was gay, despite claiming to be bisexual. He could not remember the last time Blaise told him he had sex with a woman. His previous dates never amounted to anything in the bedroom.
“Oh fuck. You’re gonna make me cum, if you keep doing that.”
“Albus Potter…cool board.”
Draco missed it too. Being crushed by Harry’s body, surrounded by his warmth, breached by his thick cock, was a heady sensation that made his head swim. Harry’s constant kissing only drove him to greater heights as he plunged inside, slowly. When Harry started moving faster, thrusting in and out, he moaned freely, no longer caring how he sounded. There was no shame to be had between them anymore. Draco did not have to hide. He knew Harry loved his noises, having been subjected to his quiet sex habits, in the beginning.
Harry nodded against the pillow, still facing the wall. Draco didn’t mind. He preferred it because he did not want to look into Harry’s eyes. He always hated how he got lost in them. Harry seemed to understand his needs, now, without having to ask.
Draco doesn’t say anything.
“Of course not Harry. You’ve been wanting this for a long time, and I was waiting for you to be ready. I thought it would make you happy. I’m sorry. Just forget the contract, okay?
“Blaise, you deserve to be happy, no matter who it’s with. I reacted badly as first, I admit. I apologize for that. I want you to know that I support you in this.”
“I’m transferring to the DMLE in Paris and could really use your support in this, Harry. It’s what I need to do…Please.”
“I’m very tired. I can’t talk right now. I just want to go home and rest.”
“The red...red collar…forever? Oh yes, sir. I promise that I won’t fail you. I can handle anything, any punishment, any torture.” He squared his shoulders and flexed, as if against an assault.
“Are you ill? You look flushed and you’re whinging.”
“I hope you don’t mind. I used the shower next door…and borrowed some pajamas.”
They used brooms to reach it, casting disillusionment charms on themselves. The landed on the roof first
“Because they were children. Graduated Hogwarts yesterday. They probably didn’t know themselves.”
By the time he woke up again, it was almost dinner time. He showered, dressed, and went downstairs to find Scorpius and Astoria sitting at the dinner table.
His jaw locks defiantly, knowing he’ll be forfeiting if he were to do so.
When he moved out of him, he heard him wince.
charm. They used it frequently to detain criminal suspects.
Blaise was no longer the only man he had ever slept with. It felt horribly uncomfortable to keep this from him.
“I thought I said no talking, Potter. Such a bad pet. You’ll never learn, will you?”
His hard hand swatted Harry’s left cheek firmly, and he watched as the rounded flesh flattened for a moment, before bouncing back into shape. Draco felt his own cock stir. Never daring to take such liberties at work didn’t mean he didn’t think about it. This was even more exciting than he had fantasized it would be, and he wondered why he didn’t do it sooner. The sight of Harry’s incredibly beautiful body squirming over his lap, the head auror insignia on his back, ass reddened with two symmetrical handprints, made him harder than he’d been when he fantasized about it. He must really remember to thank his lover for this exquisite pleasure. Just when he thought his love for him had reached its upper limit, he found the ceiling rising to accommodate more.
Harry squirmed desperately; if he didn’t ask now he might never get the courage to make this leap into being a true submissive, outside the collar.
door is slightly open. He can see its light from twenty yards away because of how the area is laid out; his door is punched into the center of a wall, the head auror door.
“Can’t we just back to the hotel?”
He wondered if this is how Blaise felt with him. It felt awful being on the other side and filled him with great sadness. He thought he saw a flash of Blaise's hair through the curtain opening, but when he pulled it back to check, no one was there. He must have imagined it, thinking of him. He closed the curtain shut, more securely.
“I have to get ready for a date with Pansy. Besides, we just saw each other at the club last night.”
Draco strode out of his office to check on the transfer. He saw Harry and the junior auror standing across the room in front of the lifts to go down. As they waited, the young auror brushed lint off of Harry’s shoulder and then blushed when Harry turned his head at the touch. He didn’t seem pleased about it, at first, until he saw Draco in the distance, and flashed Auror Smith a warm smile. The lifts opened and he guided him in by the small of his back. Before the lifts closed, he saw Harry whisper something into his ear that made him blush harder.
Blaise was already half way out of the door. He practically ran out of the room, closing the door behind him.
_____________________________________________________________________________
He pushed with his fingers, massaged the right spot, and watched as Harry began to cum, with his cock ring on. Some orders he had no issues with at all, apparently.
Draco feels the same way. Even though he was the one who fucked him within an inch of his life, Harry’s somehow won this round. And after treating him like trash in front of his children. Losing control is not part of the job description for a Dom or for a Malfoy. Frustration overtakes him, and he marches up the stairs for a long bath. Sensing he somehow said the wrong thing, Harry doesn’t follow right away.
Blaise rubs his wrist. “Where’s the boyfriend?”
He ran a finger down the crease of Harry’s ass and followed it with his tongue.
It took a few thrusts for Harry to get all the way in and he paused, the same way Draco did for his first time. Draco heard him muttering some nonsense under his breath about quidditch stats, but he focused on his breathing. He remembered that breathing through this always made it easier. After a while, he rocked gently to indicate he was ready for more.
Blaise sighed, already half-knowing the answer. His erection subsided completely at his reply. He often had to sit through Draco complaining about Harry and wondered at the man sitting next to him.
Blaise squared his shoulders, determined to endure this, at whatever cost. At the very least, Blaise was the only one Draco had sex with, as his wife slept in a different wing of the house.
With a sting to his ego, Draco realizes that he intends to treat him as no more than coworker in front of his children. Blaise’s words float back to him, and he’s seized with a sick desire to tell them that their beloved father was begging “Auror Malfoy” to fuck him like a whore, only last night. He doesn’t know what Harry’s playing at as they’re all old enough to understand what’s going on, but he relents. Hoping his face betrays none of the anguish he feels within, he steps back into the floo and vanishes without a word.
Draco was forbidden from speaking about it, and now felt so badly for Harry, that he didn’t want to burden him any further.
Grabbing his wand quickly from the night stand, he cast a cleaning, lubrication, and stretching charm. It wasn’t as fun as using his fingers, but Draco couldn’t wait. There was a time and place for drawing out pleasure, but this wasn’t it.
Draco nodded. He allowed Harry to kiss him again.
“When I see those gashes on you…” Harry’s chest heaves. “All I hear is you choking on all that blood. I don’t even know what I did.” Harry’s words are groans. He moves his hand, and Draco can see his cheeks are streaked with shiny wetness.
When it’s over, Harry is panting and leaking copiously from his cock, his death grip on the cross loosens and he goes limp. Without the restraints holding him up, he would’ve sank into a wasted pile of boneless limbs to the ground. He feels hands stroking his back and ass with cooling gel and sighs in relief. Draco dips a lube-slicked finger inside his hole to stretch him, probing his prostate, and he groans in response.
“Husbands?” Harry asks later, as they drink coffee on the deck.
The end of the week brought another knife to his already broken heart. An announcement on page 6 showed a picture of Blaise kneeling down on one knee in front of Pansy and then Pansy, with tearful eyes, dragging him up to kiss him.
He felt unhinged and unstable, taking it all out on Blaise. He felt like he was unravelling at the seams, and it was all because of Harry.
Draco stands and turns his back to her because he doesn’t want her to see his face.
“Hold my hand.” Harry’s voice shakes.
Harry obliged, closing the door behind him, and rushed over behind Draco’s desk.
“Really great. He made me feel things I’ve never felt before. His methods are…special.”
He wandlessly conjured a comfortable padded sofa.
His tone was more mild now, quieter.
“Make love to me, Harry.”
naked chest to naked chest. Draco felt himself getting hard, but remembered the dull throbbing in his backside. When Harry moved to palm his hardening cock through his joggers, he pulled away.
However, in his dreams after the trip, after finally fucking him, he was often the one taking it hard from Harry instead, his scent surrounding him, his massive body crushing Draco to the bed, filling him with his power.
It spurred him on, and he began placing harsh sucking kisses directly on it. Harry was moaning freely and the sounds were killing him. Eventually, it got too much for the kneeling man in front of him, and his hands fell from behind his back to the mattress, so that he could brace himself against Draco’s delicious onslaught.
Draco bristled and was almost afraid to tell Harry the truth.
“Tell me about it. Any more emotion and I’ll self destruct.” Draco says, covering his eyes with his hands.
Then Blaise is saying words in latin. Working his wand over the paper. It glows and floats off the table. It’s old magic. The bonding spell was looked up in an old Maloy tomb that dated back over a thousand years.
As the adults followed, they brushed hands accidentally. Draco felt a tingle go through his fingers and retreated his hand immediately, crossing his arms; his mood soured further.
“We’re working. Yes, an important case came up. Can I floo you later?”
Harry merely shrugged his shoulders and resumed sucking his cock, as if nothing had happened.
“Thank you,” Harry said faintly, going limp in Draco’s arms.
"I still love you,” he says angrily. “Yeah, I know that’s pathetic, but I’ve loved you for years, probably since Hogwarts. Believe me, I wish I didn’t. Are you so heartless that you won’t let me have this small thing?”
He started at a distance for his seventh blow, swinging his arm for maximum torque and impact.
He pushed Draco against the wall
He savored the Turkish coffee as it warmed his throat and brought him back to life. He made a mental note to pick up some to bring back to his home when they went to the markets today. Thoughts of Harry were buried away.
Draco dresses in tailored black trousers and a fitted black v-neck short sleeved shirt. Nothing overstated. He doesn’t want to dress in leather because he doesn’t want Blaise to see it coming. He wants him to believe it’s spontaneous, that Draco can’t resist him.
Harry did not respond.
“Yee of little faith,” Draco slurred, as he grabbed the bottle from Harry to take another swig.
He stopped in front of him. Blaise had never rejected him before.
I didn’t eat at home today. Come on Malfoy, it’s just breakfast. Don’t be a ponce. Let’s go.”
“It was an accident, Granger. He’s had alcohol with it before. Nothing like this ever happened.”
Blaise put a hand on his chin, pretending to think.
Harry let out a sigh of relief and sat down across from, clutching his hand across the table.
He knew what Blaise was alluding to with that comment. Harry did, indeed, drive him crazy when they traveled together. That’s why the very first thing Draco did the night he came back from a work trip was tuck Scorpius into bed and floo to Blaise’s for an entire evening of fucking. It had become tradition.
Suddenly, she burst out of her bedroom in a state of half-undress, as she tied a robe around herself. Her hair was mussed, and she looked sweaty.
“Excellent work Auror Potter. You managed to complete your mission in two days. Wish I had 10 more like you. Tell Auror Malfoy good job as well. See you tomorrow morning,” and he was gone.
Harry’s kneeling on the floor in from of him. Their eyes catch and hold, and he thinks…he looks sad. Or maybe somber. What he
He moved deeper now adjusting his angle, determined to find the sweet spot. He thrust forward at a slightly awkward angle and Harry yelped and shook.
Harry sits down at the small wooden table in the kitchen, raising his eyebrows because Draco’s never made anything before. He props one arm on the table, resting his cheek on a clenched hand, as Draco makes sandwiches with what he’s got in the fridge.
“There will
Harry continued to grunt and thrust behind him for a few more minutes, until he finally groaned loudly and released his cum deep inside Draco. He shoved him forward hard enough, with his orgasm, that the couch moved forward two feet, clear across the floor.
“I’m not interested Potter. Find someone else.”
With only the ticking of the grandfather clock in the dining room, Draco and Harry had dinner. The silence was oppressive. It was pure agony for Draco, and he simply didn’t understand why Harry continued to see him. It was obvious he had pulled away already, and this was merely his ghost, sticking around to haunt him and taunt him with the thing he had lost. Draco couldn’t sit through dessert and retired to the parlor before it arrived. Harry followed.
Draco wakes up in a fright after only an hour of sleep to a cold, empty bed. It's morning. He searches everywhere in the house for Harry, but he’s gone without so much as a note. It’s the weekend and the wives have the kids so the plan was for Harry to stay at Malfoy Manor. Worry overtakes him as he commences his morning shower.
Draco kissed him hard, to wipe that look off his face. He couldn’t bear to see it, for another moment. Harry stumbled and they fell to the floor.
Harry felt like crying, but he couldn’t shame Draco that way so he blinked rapidly and looked at the floor.
Harry remembers being wheeled down a long hallway. He knew Draco should be with him, but he wasn’t. He kept trying to ask for him, and no one would answer. So he tried to get up and go find him.
“I’m never like this. You just, do something to me. I can’t help it.”
“Come on, babe. Let me get you to the sofa. You need to lie down. You’ll feel better.”
Blaise raised his eyebrows at that and Draco realized his mistake. Being ‘normal’ for them meant having a lot of sex.
“Oh, yes. Yes, sir. Give it to me. Right now.”
this morning, maybe he did love Blaise in return, at least a little bit. Maybe, he was just too stupid to realize it.
“So long since we’ve done this. I can’t wait to please you, sir.”
____________________________________________________________________________
he forgot how much this truly pleased him. Harry was submitting to him and he’d never been more turned on in his entire life. He thought this would be more difficult to do to someone he loved, someone like Harry, but he was wrong.
Meeting Harry's eyes for the first time was a mistake. There was a tenderness there that made his heart clench. His jade orbs sparkled with vulnerability and uncertainty. He had never seen this look on him before. Draco's first instinct was to kiss him, but he quickly suppressed the feeling, disgusted with himself.
“Just fucking? What about all those things you said at Grimmauld, after you fucked Blaise, about wanting me?”
Draco crashed to the ground on his hands and knees, coughing brutally, trying to catch his breath.
_____________________________________
After a few minutes, he was painfully hard. This was not good. He needed to be in control of his desire to properly punish Blaise.
the fucking memories keep breaking through. Not that he’s tempted, but Draco thinks it’s best to maintain distance, so he takes a seat on his green velvet couch. It suddenly dawns on him that he purchased one just like it for his own home, recently. He always loved Blaise’s style.
He practically ran up the stairs to put some distance between them. His sense of calm from the ride earlier had evaporated. What was this feeling? He almost felt sick. His stomach fluttered about and he felt tingly all over. It was borderline, unpleasant, in its intensity. He didn’t know what it was, but he knew Harry was causing it.
Harry sighed, but he wasn’t giving up that easily. He tried again, and Draco grabbed his wrist hard enough to bruise and shucked it away hatefully. Harry threw the covers off him to expose Draco’s perfect nude body.  He spooned behind him and began laying ravenous kisses on his back and neck, groping him everywhere. Draco pushed him off brutally and turned around. He held Harry back at a distance with his outstretched arms to protect himself from the onslaught, but he was unperturbed. He merely smacked his arms out of the way and gripped Draco around his waist to pull him close and kiss him. There was a struggle. They rolled around on the bed, naked, their erect cocks brushing each other.
“That’s amazing Drake. How did you manage that?”
When Draco asked after Pansy, he was pleased to hear that he was still actively dating her, and that it was going very well.
Draco understands now—why they run. Fairy tale princesses. Overwhelmed sensory kids, abused teenagers. Everyone who’s ever seen a horror, heard horrible news. When there’s a deatheater attack,
They returned to England by International portkey Sunday afternoon. When they arrived, Draco gave him a mere nod and said “See you at work.”
“Are you okay?”
Draco kisses carefully along its trek. “How do you feel, baby? What hurts?”
Draco hid in his office for most of the day. He could not bring himself to face Harry yet. He burned with shame at the visions Harry had seen and the things he heard. Blaise was such a smarmy bastard. He wanted to make him pay, but he felt that the only person who was going to pay for this was himself.
“Don’t be ridiculous Potter. It was completely casual. Besides, there’s nothing to tell. Blaise and I ended it this morning.”
Smiling, Draco realized they were starting to reflect each other’s thoughts. Sleep was fast upon him as his travel had drained him of all energy. Though he had grown accustomed to bottoming, it still always hit him with a powerful wave of exhaustion, once it was over. He rested his eyes for a moment and quickly fell asleep.
He knew Harry would be hurt if he ever found out he had come here, but as he was planning to remain completely faithful, he did not see the harm in engaging his retinas with a little domination/submission action. Harry did not need to be exposed to this part of himself. He was too pure for this darker side of Draco.
Draco nods.
He stepped into the fire with his heart breaking, and floo’d away to Malfoy Manor, once more.
Still, one thousand galleons a month, over a five-year period, was sixty-thousand galleons more, than what Draco was willing to part with.
“I can come.” Draco blows his breath out.
Piccadilly Square, in broad daylight. No one would blink an eye. The rest of us aren’t afforded such luxuries.”
“So how was your trip to to Turkey?”
Need you...So much…
“Yes.”
“Dinner with the kids. Sleeping at Grimmauld tonight.”
“Auror Malfoy, did a case come up?”
Draco starts to stroke him. “That’s why I didn’t go to Paris. To make your head so cloudy you can’t think of anything but me.”
After they get him set up, Harry drags his eyes open. He squints down at himself, at all the contraptions attached to his body, and his eyes shine with tears.
Harry turned his pleading eyes to Draco, receiving a little swat as a reminder. “Eyes down. Perhaps you’d better kneel pet,” Draco said under his breath.
Watching Harry from above, Draco felt he had never been more turned on his life. Harry would often look up and lock eyes with him. He grasped his head and thrust forward making him gag, then stroked his hair as if in apology.
They would sometime creep up in his dreams, but he would roll over, cuddle against Harry and forget all about them. The problem with these dreams and fantasies is that they often involved Blaise whom he now hated. Blaise did not deserve to star in his sex dreams after his despicable betrayal. It was only because Blaise had been so often a vital part of his dominant experiences.
Draco’s arms encircle him. “Don’t worry about anything. Just get some sleep.”
Blaise makes them both a fresh mojito, knowing it’s Draco’s preference on Sunday afternoons. Draco gets really close to him, watching him make it with practiced hands. The smell of him, his fresh cologne mixed with his body’s natural clean scent, hits him hard enough to make him feel light headed. He steps back because it causes a flood of memories to break through. Blaise turns his head to look at him, smiling, as if he knows exactly what he’s thinking.
________________________________________________________________________________
They were both breathing harshly, trying to catch their breath. Blaise had his head turned and was looking away, not meeting his eyes, just the way Draco liked a submissive lover to be. Harry was always staring into his soul, and it often made him uncomfortable.
He cast the preparation charms and moved to finger him, but Harry smacked his fingers away.
“You’re despicable. No more than coward. And I promise you…you will pay for what you’ve done.”
___________________________________________________________
He moved up his neck across his cheek, skipping his mouth, to the other cheek, then down to his chest. He got on his knees as he moved his lips down his abs, still not touching, but leaving goosebumps in his wake. Blaise shivered.
Draco glanced down at his pants. They were gathering from being seated and his package was perfectly outlined. He caught Harry following his line of vision to his crotch and thrust his cloak over to hide it, embarrassed.
“Yeah yeah.”
Ten minutes went by quickly and Harry knocked on his door, right on the dot.
His whole life was constantly under a microscope that scanned for errors. Everyone was waiting, with baited breath, to crucify him for the smallest mistake. Shacklebolt fired him, at the drop of hat, for something that was, in no way, his fault. Harry got off scotch-free.
At the sight of his trembling, Draco smiled with glee. He knew exactly what it felt like. Draco waved his wand again, pushing up the intensity and Harry gripped his cock, but his hand was smacked away. He was already leaking copiously.
The letter was from Harry. He could tell by the scratchy writing on the outside:
Draco could not believe Harry’s libido, but could not find it in himself to complain. This would be Harry’s fifth orgasm today.
He reached over his to his wand to cast a cleaning charm to his hole and conjure oil. He spread it all over Harry’s back. He massaged it in deeply, almost lovingly, going up to his trapezius all the way down to his ass, letting his fingers slip between the cleft to stroke his hole.
__________________________________________________________
Draco could not even manage to escape him in his sleep. His hatred for him made his insides clench, and he resented him for invading his dreams, with his stupid bright white smile twinkling in the sun.
wearing black silk pajama bottoms. A matching silk robe, undone, was hanging on his shoulders.
His tone was very soft and dangerous. Draco reminded himself that Blaise was sorted into Slytherin, for a reason, and not to trifle with him, or this could be very dangerous for him. He decided, at least, to stop denying it was him.
Draco pretended not to see him or hear him and continued calling out for him.
Harry looks at her. Draco can barely hear his voice as he half-wheezes, “not so good.”
“How did you sleep?” Draco asked.
Draco didn’t know if he should take this leap so soon. He was drunk and this was definitely not a good idea, but he couldn’t, for the life of him, remember why.
Draco groaned. Blaise was unconscionably tight around his cock, even though they had fucked continuously for 3 days just this past weekend.
“Nothing happened, but it’s something I’ve been thinking about, for a while now. Please Draco. I want you to do it to me, no holding back. I want to see your dominant side. You always hide it from me. I love you and there’s no part of yourself that I wouldn’t accept.”
Blaise knew Draco’s biggest fear was someone, anyone, discovering the truth about his sexual preferences. Now, the entire Wizarding World knew. He could not have destroyed Draco in a more thorough manner. He would never get passed this. He had lost his best friend, forever.
“You rang?” Blaise joked, with a smile.
“Hey. Don’t give me that look. I’m not ‘with’ Potter. Don’t be silly. Why don’t we get together next Wednesday after drinks at the club?”
Draco furrowed his eyebrows, remembering that the ‘something’ that suddenly made him so understanding about Blaise’s rash act, was unforgettable sex with Harry.
“Please…fill me…I need you inside me.”
Because that’s obvious to anyone who’s ever seen you together.”
“How could you possibly know that?”
“Let’s talk more about what you want out of this. So as I understand it, you like to be dominated with rough sex, verbal degradation, rope play. Is there anything else you like?”
It’s hard to explain, so he’s not going to try. For now, no one’s actually said he can take a dick, so it’s normal for him to say he’s waiting until he gets clearance.
Draco’s heart warmed considerably when he read that part. It was always possible that Mr. Jones was using a quick-notes quill that embellished each of Harry’s reactions, like Rita Skeeter’s had done in the past, so he did not get his hopes up. Still, he found himself reading that part over and over again, despite himself.
“Cum for me.”
Draco wanted, so badly, to tell him the truth, but he held back.
“Sorry…habit. You are my concern. You always will be.”
“No robes today, Auror Potter? Your…assets are on display, and so tempting.” he said in his low slow drawl. Harry shivered in response.
“Sure.”
He left the gym to go to the lockers, without looking at Harry, and immediately disrobed to enter the shower.
She was on the board of several charities instead, donating large amounts of the Malfoy fortune, but never without Draco’s consent. It was not enough to really make a dent in their finances, in any case.
He can’t remember ever having cum so hard in his life.
Seeing the marks plunged Draco into memories of their initial couplings, the first time Harry made love to him. A burst of affection swelled inside his heart. He reached up to stroke his back, as Harry had not reacted to Draco’s presence yet. His muscles flexed, in response, and Harry bent his head into the water.
Someone is sobbing.
“And because I’m a merciful Master, I’ll even let you wear a cock ring to help you.”
Harry was already in bed when he stepped out of his bathroom, naked, but for his boxers, he assumed. He couldn’t tell because he was under the covers.
Harry stilled, in complete shock. He must have misheard. He didn’t believe his ears.
Draco enters the shower behind him, stroking his bulging arms.
He held his head down in the toilet for a moment, breathing heard, waiting for his vision to stabilize.
Harry lays his head against his chest like he asks—the first time he’s done since before…what happened. He blows his breath out slowly. Then he works up the courage to kiss his shoulder.
Then, he floo called his private investigator to find out about Nott’s financial transactions over the past five years. He would get to the bottom of this, no matter what it took.
“Thank circe. I’m dying for some coffee, right now,” Draco said with relief.
Draco obliged.
“You still haven’t finished the reports on the werewolves. What the hell is taking so long?”
The next morning, they both woke up to an incessant tapping on his window. It was barely 6am. Who could be owling this early?
Draco observed his handywork. He tied the ropes himself, foregoing his wand, his cock hardening to full mast, again, as he did so. He opened the bedstand drawer for Blaise’s favorite blind fold, black silk, and tied it around his head.
“After you, boss,” Harry replied, in annoyingly high spirits.
Draco was breathing hard from a spike of adrenaline. Of course, Harry would appear right when he was receiving a sexual stimulant potion that he was intending to use on Blaise, that very same night. The fates were always against him. It rankled when he realized that he would never need such a potion to fuck Harry, all night, if he was this horny. He was the reason he had to forego his pride and order this potion, in the first place. He cursed him for having complete control over his libido.
He chooses now, to follow Draco’s advice and get married? When his hands were tied to Harry’s, and he couldn’t do anything to reassure him that this could continue through his marriage to Pansy.
After an hour, Albus still had not come down from Scorpius’ room. Harry did his muggle nanny cam incantation to check on him and realized they were both knocked out cold on Scorpius’ large king bed.
“Yea, you’ve got no answer for that, do you? I only have one question. What in the bleeding fuck are you doing with me?”
Sensing he’s awake, Harry runs his hands down Draco’s abs. “I love you, Draco.” He moves lower. Draco is half hard and growing under his touch. Harry groans. “I’ve missed this.”
Ten minutes later, Harry joined, looking relaxed, eyes down respectfully. The collar looked beautiful underneath the black silk robe he wore.
