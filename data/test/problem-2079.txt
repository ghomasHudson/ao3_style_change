Harry used their joined hands to tug Draco closer until he was leaning against him. In one synchronized movement, Draco tilted his chin and Harry lowered his mouth—and then they were exchanging the softest kisses. Lips brushing, parting, and meeting again. Harry let go of Draco’s hand and used both his arms to drag Draco even closer, one hand wrapping around his waist and resting possessively on Draco’s hip, and the other threading through Draco’s hair. Draco’s own hands lifted unconsciously to tangle in Harry’s inky locks and their kisses deepened. When they paused for breath, Harry buried his face against Draco and sprinkled his neck with more kisses.
“Draco!  Where is he?” Harry interrupted.  Robards tried to ask Harry to calm down, but Harry lost his patience.  “Where is he?  Just fucking tell me!” Harry shouted at the head of MLE.
Draco lay on the exam table, pale and unconscious.  Two Healers were busy casting diagnostic spells, and a third was in the corner testing potions. Harry rushed over to his side and grabbed his hand.  “Baby, what happened?” he whispered.
“You can’t help, Potter,” Draco said lowly, realizing that his mother was dying and he had botched up his only hope. “You already defeated this Death Eater.”
“Fucker!” Draco muttered, his hands clenching and unclenching on the headboard.
“You’ve wrecked me, Draco.  How am I supposed to go into work and get anything done?” Harry smiled and tightened his arms.  “Are you at St Mungo’s or the Ministry today?”
Harry missed rooming with his Gryffindor friends, of course, but this new arrangement was working out better than he could have hoped.  It turned out that Blaise was funny and he treated Harry just like a regular bloke.  Ernie was mostly gone from their room studying, so Harry and Blaise were left to be as ridiculous as they pleased, often accompanied by Ron.  Neville had been nervous to room with Malfoy, but he had relaxed after the first week.  Neville had reported to Harry that Malfoy was surprisingly quiet and tidy, and didn’t seem inclined to bother anyone.
“Fuck!  Fuck yes, baby!” Harry gasped.  “That’s it, ride me!”
More likely, Harry Potter would lock him up if he knew Draco was attempting to summon Voldemort from the dead.
Draco, who had been looking away during Ron’s tale, now pinned him with his steely gaze.  “Truth,” he answered through gritted teeth.
“Tell me about this loophole,” Draco quietly insisted. He used his free hand to tenderly tip Harry’s chin up so that their gazes locked once more.
The elf popped in with a smile on her wrinkled face. “What is Master Draco needing?”
“Draco . . .” Harry started to reach out a hand toward his husband, but let it fall when Draco crossed his arms and gave him a cold look.
All the air rushed out of Harry’s lungs and he couldn’t think straight.  He and Draco had had sex, and he couldn’t remember any of it!
Draco’s hands came back around Harry and started caressing up and down his back, and then both hands went lower, cupping and squeezing his ass.  Harry’s prick was hard and aching, and the feel of Draco’s hands on him as well as rubbing up against Draco’s pajama-clad cock were going to send him over the edge too quickly.  “Oh, Baby!  I missed you so much,” Harry thrust his body against Draco’s and kissed him passionately.
“How the hell would you know, Malfoy?” Harry scoffed.
Draco looked down and Harry followed his gaze, watching as Draco wrapped his hand around both their cocks.  The pressure on his cock was such a relief Harry sagged against the wall.  Draco moved both his legs between Harry’s.  Harry lifted his leg to wrap behind Draco’s leg, securing the other man to him.  Draco’s hand had started to squeeze and pull both dicks.  Pleasure filled every part of Harry’s body, as he thrust into Draco’s hand.  He was close, so very close.
“If you hadn’t grabbed me we wouldn’t be in this mess, Potter,” Malfoy hissed angrily.
The darkness was immediate and Draco’s eyes struggled to make out some faint red lights in the distance. The sounds and smells, however, were overwhelming. Screams, shrieks, and roars echoed all around. As for smells, Draco could definitely smell fire and blood, as well as some more scents he would rather not identify.
“Just wasn’t expecting it,” Harry rasped.  He sat back up and watched as Malfoy took two more drinks.  He handed the bottle back to Harry and this time Harry took a more moderate drink, gasping only a little this time.
“You can remember our sixth year, correct?”  At Draco’s nod, Harry continued, “Well . . . my Draco told me about some very vivid fantasies that he had during his fifth and sixth years.”  Draco did look at Harry then, his panicked grey eyes going wide.  He renewed his efforts to move away from Harry, but Harry couldn’t let this opportunity pass.  “And I was featured in those fantasies,” Harry whispered, bringing his lips next to Draco’s ear.  “So . . . I think you can imagine it,” Harry’s whisper turned into a low growl.  He kissed along Draco’s jaw and heard his breath hitch.  “I think you’re just scared,” he murmured.  Harry moved one hand to cup Draco’s cheek as he brought their lips together in a gentle kiss.
Wearily he made his way to his bed.  He stopped to check on Al and was bemused at the sight that greeted him.  Tiny Hilly was sitting in the rocking chair, cradling a sleeping Al in her arms, singing a soft lullaby.  She looked up when she noticed Harry and gave him an adoring smile, then she went back to singing to the sleeping baby.  Clearly, Harry thought, he would have to rethink his ‘no House Elves will raise his child’ policy.  Hilly was obviously in her element and Al could only benefit by having more people who loved her, in her life.
“Just for a minute?” Ron asked quietly, as he stood solidly behind his friend.
Then it was too late to worry any more.  Draco was entering the garden and moving across to where Harry was standing.  He was wearing dove grey wizarding robes, edged in pale icy blue.  His robes reached mid-calf and underneath he was wearing black Muggle trousers and shoes.
Draco slid into the bed, gingerly, as if afraid to set off an explosion.  They lay there for a minute in silence.  Harry ended his ‘Lumos” charm and plunged them back into darkness.  “I should go,” Draco whispered into the dark.
Malfoy clamped his hand on the back of Harry’s neck and dragged him close.  His lips pressed firmly to Harry’s own.  They were so warm, almost hot, and Harry had not been expecting that.  If he had thought about Malfoy’s lips at all he would have imagined them being cool, as cool as his ice grey eyes and pale moonlight hair.  But they weren’t, they were hot and they ignited Harry.  Malfoy’s mouth moved over Harry’s, his lips firm and soft, pressing and sucking – and fuck, what was happening.
Warning for nonconsensual kissing.  Nothing more than a kiss though.
Draco tried to sit up, but Harry pulled him back down for another kiss.  “I’m only this way with you, love,” Harry whispered in his ear.
“That’s my girl,” Draco said as he gently tickled her cheek with his finger.
Draco opened his mouth to speak but was cut off when Hilly apparated into the room.
“What? No! Of course not. My mother and I got rid of all of that as soon as possible, after the war. We turned it all over to the Ministry,” Draco asserted.
“You daft man,” Draco murmured before pressing his lips against Harry’s.  He brushed them back and forth against Harry’s mouth, and then his tongue swept out and started tracing along the seam of Harry’s lips.
“No! I don’t . . . I can’t,” Draco roughly pushed Harry back and tore himself from his arms.  Draco moved to the other side of the room and stood with his chest heaving and his back to Harry.  “I think you should leave,” he said gruffly.
Hermione bent forward and gripped Ron’s hand, “We need to go.”
“No!  Had you?” Draco snapped back.
Draco was still in shock, not sure how to form a complete sentence, thoughts ricocheting all around his brain, “What… how… why… how…?”
“You’re in no shape to apparate, mate,” Ron pointed out as they moved quickly though the building.  “Let me side-along you.”
“A week… two at the most.” The Healer shifted uncomfortably on their feet.
Every time Harry had thought about asking, his throat had closed up with fear of what he might hear as Draco’s answer.  Draco hadn’t asked any questions either.  Mostly their mouths were too busy to talk.
“Kreacher died quite a while ago,” Harry answered.
The faint red light from further down the passage allowed Draco to just make out Potter’s features. He could feel the hard muscles of Potter’s body pressed all along the length of his own. He knew it was entirely inappropriate for the time and place, maybe being this close to his own mortality had made him foolhardy, but all Draco could think about at that moment was pressing his lips against Potter’s. The other man was always filled with so much emotion and passion that Draco imagined his kisses would be life-altering for a Malfoy. He focused on Potter’s mouth, his lips glowing rosy from the faint red light. Without conscious thought, he pressed himself even closer to Potter and lowered his head until their lips were mere millimeters apart.
“Yes, what, baby?” Harry asked huskily, dropping his mouth until he was barely touching Draco’s mouth.  “What is it you want?”
“Impatient Gryffindor,” Draco said fondly, “you didn’t let me finish.”
“If that is everything, we will return to our room now.” Malfoy’s mouth was pressed into a hard flat line.
“Merlin, Blaise!  What is so damned important?” Draco’s voice rang over the room as he, Pansy and Blaise emerged from the corridor leading to the boys’ dormitories.
Harry felt his knees go weak and tears fill his eyes.  He quickly sat down in an armchair by the window, and the rest of the world fell away.  Tears fell freely while he looked at her sweet round face, which had just a hint of a pointy chin.  Atria Lily had wispy black hair and light grey eyes, eyes that stared steadily into her father’s.  He unwrapped her blanket and quickly counted, and kissed all ten fingers and toes.  Then he wrapped her back up, holding her close.  “Oh, my sweet girl,” he whispered.
“Is that?  Did she just smile?” Draco leaned closer to Al and his shoulder brushed Harry’s.
“Potter-Malfoy,” Draco muttered, but the healer ignored him to continue his debrief.
“I’ll owl her when I return home. We will work on this tomorrow. 8:00 AM?” Potter said before surprising Draco with what he said next. “I assume you prefer to work here at the Manor, to be close at hand to your mother.”
“She’s good.” Draco squeezed back as he answered. “The curse was broken. She’s resting now.”
Harry pulled his wand and closed the bed hangings, warding them shut and put up Silencing Charms.  Then he stuffed the wand under his pillow and turned back to Draco.  “Come here,” he said, pulling Draco into his arms.  He fit perfectly.  The weight of his body pressed Harry’s into the mattress.  Draco propped himself up on his elbows so he could look into Harry’s eyes.  Harry ran his hands over Draco’s shoulders and back, reveling in his ability to touch Draco wherever he wanted.  “I love you.” Harry smiled up at Draco.
The silence that followed her pronouncement was shattered when Dilly popped in. “Master Draco is being needed by the Mistress.” She focused her eyes unblinking on Draco. “Master Draco is needed now.”
He started by unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, placing tantalizing kisses on every inch of skin as it was revealed.  When his shirt was all the way open, Harry went back to his nipples, licking and sucking at them until they were hardened red nubs.  Then he turned his cheek so that his evening stubble was brushing against them causing Draco to cry out and rock his hips some more.  Harry lifted his head and watched Draco squirm beneath him.
Even with all of the company coming and going, when Draco finally opened his eyes, it was only Harry in the room.  Andromeda had taken Narcissa down to get a quick cup of tea and Ron and Hermione had left to have dinner with their children.
In response, Draco gave a small sob and tightened his grip on the bed covers.
“That’s not an answer, Baby,” Harry smirked.  He leaned forward putting his weight on one hand next to Draco’s head.  With his other hand, he used his thumb to trace his lips and pull at his bottom lip.  “Now, do you want a reward?  I’m gonna need a yes or a no on that.”
Harry chuckled lowly and deliberately eased two fingers inside Draco, knowing that he liked a little burn with the stretch.  Draco panted and pushed back on his fingers as Harry slowly opened him up.  When Draco was taking three fingers easily, Harry pulled them free and leaned over to kiss him.  “I want you ride me,” Harry said breathlessly, “Do you think you’re up for that?”
Harry held a sleeping Draco in his arms until the sun had moved well up into the sky.  And while he held him, he thought.  He thought about what it would be like if Draco loved him back, what their life could be like, what a team they would make.
Thropwaite chimed in, “She smuggled the cursed object into my classroom, and performed a Suggestion Charm to get me to deliver it to you.”
“We won’t free you!” Harry interrupted.
“I want a shower!” Harry demanded.  “It’s been almost a week and cleaning charms just aren’t cutting it!”  Harry folded his arms across his bare chest as he stood in front of Draco wearing only his boxers.
“It’s so hard, Narcissa,” Harry’s voice broke too.  “He’s not even trying.  He won’t see me, and he wouldn’t come for his own daughter!”  Harry scrubbed away angry tears.  “Tell him he should have been here!  She needs her Papa too!”
Draco glowered back at him, “I was joking about that, you prat!  Nothing happened last night.  After you stripped off, you passed out on me and snored all night.”  Draco sat up and put as much distance between them as was comfortable.
Draco gave Harry a grateful smile, and accepted a sandwich, “That sounds good, Harry.  All of it.”
Harry continued the movement of his hand, this time going lower to cup the soft skin of Draco’s arse cheek.  It fit perfectly in his palm.  Draco moaned some more and pressed his hardening cock against Harry’s hip.  “You feel so good,” he whispered.  Harry moved his fingers until the brushed along Draco’s crack, slowly, gently, back and forth until Draco whimpered and pushed his arse back toward Harry’s fingers.
“What? What are you talking about?” asked Harry.
“More to the point, are you up to it, Potter?” Draco asked with a smirk at Harry’s tented pajama bottoms.
Draco was torn but he knew Harry would want him to go help his mother, it was why he had made his sacrifice after all. He took Dilly’s extended hand and allowed her to Apparate him directly to his mother’s chamber.
After the first time, it had become a regular thing. Whenever Harry studied in the library he seemed to come across Malfoy, and Malfoy would always make room for him at his table.  Harry had even asked Malfoy the occasional question about their homework and Malfoy had been helpful and hadn’t made fun of Harry even once.
“Harry!” Draco pleaded.  His body twisting restlessly with want.
Draco turned back around to face Harry but his attention was still fully on the baby in his arms.  He began to bounce more in earnest.  Draco cooed at the baby, “Ok, little star, if you tell your daddy I did this I’ll . . . well, I’ll never buy you a pony.”  He smiled down at the baby.  She had stopped crying and was gurgling up at him.  “Oh, you don’t think I mean it, do you?  I’ll have you know I am going to be a very strict father!  And while we’re on the subject, no boyfriends!  Ever!” Draco laughed softly, his eyes shining down at his daughter.
Draco had just left the room when Dilly returned to remove the tray of food. Her attention caught by the book Draco had left open, Dilly went over to see what he had written. Her large eyes widened and she brought a hand to her mouth as she read the words on the parchment. She frowned angrily at the tome on the desk and with a quick wave of her hand she closed it shut. Turning her attention back to the parchment, she waved her hand once more and changed some of the words on the page. When finished, she nodded to herself before picking up the heavy tray and Disapparating away.
Potter let go of Draco abruptly and he stumbled for a moment before catching and steadying himself. “I don’t… there’s not… I mean…” Potter scrubbed his hands through his hair, stirring up the messy black strands. “What am I supposed to do about it?” He looked rapidly from Draco to Dilly and back again.
Draco lifted a hand towards Harry but then dropped it before he touched him. He wasn’t sure if he could trust his eyes or if this was just a manifestation of his longing, come to life? “You’re here?” he whispered.
“Not that easy to get rid of me,” Harry tried to joke.
“Of course, mother,” Draco responded as he moved toward a chair and pulled it out for his mother.  Harry stood there unsure, as usual, about the etiquette required in this situation.  Draco seated himself next to his mother, “Potter, If you are waiting for me to pull out your chair too, you will be standing a very long time.”
“Come for me, Harry,” Draco commanded and that tipped Harry over the edge so that he was coming hard and shooting all over Draco’s hand.  Harry watched while Draco released Harry’s cock and stroked his hand, still covered in Harry’s cum, over his own dick.  Draco leaned in and gave Harry a very messy kiss, more teeth and panting breath than anything else.  “Harry!” Draco moaned and shuddered as he came, shooting all over Harry’s stomach.
“Draco!  I’m sorry, I . . .” Harry started to move to follow Draco but stopped himself.  “I’m sorry, I just . . . I just want my life back,” Harry’s voice broke on the last words.
At first Harry thought Malfoy would just ignore what he had said, but after a long pause he heard a whispered, “You’re welcome.”  They worked silently side by side for nearly three hours.  Harry had expected to feel jumpy and nervous, but he hadn’t.  He had felt comfortable working alongside Malfoy, and he had gotten a lot done.
“Arrogant Slytherin, always trying to torture me,” Harry grumbled, sprinkling Draco’s neck with kisses in between his words.
“Because you want to be?  Or because I’ve pressured you?” Harry tried to clarify.
“Sore all over.  Everything hurts,” Harry whispered.
“Oh, God!  I’m sorry!” Hermione covered her face with her hands.  She pulled her hands away and gave Harry a stricken look, “Harry …”
“I’m not that hungry,” Draco demurred.  “I think I’ll just retire early.”
“Are you calling me Draco now?” Draco’s question came out as a challenge.
Soooo much smut!!! I threw in a little praise kink, just because. It’s a long one, I hope the wait was worth it.  ;)  I have loved writing this story.  Thank you so much to those of you who have followed and commented!  It means more to me than you can ever know.
Everyone had turned to look back at Harry while he spoke, but now they turned back to Draco to await his response.  “Haaarrry,” Draco stretched out his name in a plea.
Dumbledore arrived just as their friends left.  He huddled with Thropwaite, speaking in hushed tones while Madam Pomfrey started in on diagnostic spells.
Harry sheepishly looked down at the ground.  “I may have used our vows from the first time,” he peeked up at Draco to judge his reaction, but Draco was still looking surprised.  “But that doesn’t mean that I don’t mean them!  I do!  All of it!” he rushed to clarify.
“No, that’s quite alright, Dilly. I’m not hungry.” Draco didn’t look up from the book he was currently perusing.
“You are so fucking gorgeous!  Do you have any idea?”  Harry lay back and slid his right hand down to cup his prick through his trousers.  He groaned at the sensation and watched as Draco’s mouth fell open.  It felt good to give his cock some relief, but it wasn’t enough.  He quickly unfastened his flies and thrust his hand inside of his pants.  He groaned again when his fingers closed around his throbbing erection.  Watching Draco as he stroked his prick.
Harry ached, he throbbed, and he needed to come so badly.  He was so hard!  It had been three days of living with Malfoy side by side, and three days of pure torture.  Before being cursed, Harry had lived the life of a normal eighteen year old boy.
“What’s going on?  What do you ... ?” Draco sat up in confusion.  He pushed impatiently at the hair that fell into his face.  “What are you doing, Potter?”
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy,” the Healer rushed to say. “If there is nothing else I will go up to her now.”
“I don’t know . . . she likes it,” Harry said defensively.
Dilly slowly shook her head. “That is being a very bad idea, Master Draco. Dark Arts are being very bad indeed. Master Draco will open doors he can’t close again.”
“No, no, Draco.  I was wrong to ask you,” Draco pulled back as he heard Harry’s words.  “It was wrong of me to try and push you into something you weren’t ready for.  I’m sorry for the things I said.  I was wrong.  You don’t need to change.”
“Harry Potter must be taking Master Draco to the underworld, and they must be finding the one who placed this dark curse!” Dilly said emphatically.
“What’s got you in such a good mood?” Harry grouched, aware that he was being unreasonable but unable to stop himself.  “Happy to find yourself bonded to me, are you?”
Draco hurried to the library, eager to send whoever it was away and get busy researching ways to get back to Harry. He faltered at the entrance and stopped entirely when he saw who was there. “Potter!” he gasped out.
Knowing he wasn’t going to like the answer, Harry asked anyway, “What’s a consummation component?”  He addressed his question to Bill, wanting to hear the answer from a man he trusted.
Harry swallowed hard, he couldn’t remember feeling so unsure of himself, “but . . . but do you want it with me?”
Draco whined a little in his throat and moved to straddle Harry’s lap.  Harry moved his hand from Draco’s waist down to hold the firm curve of Draco’s ass and pull him closer.  The first brush of their hard cocks was almost his undoing.  He and Draco both moaned into their kiss as they rutted together.  Harry moved his hand to start unfastening Draco’s trousers.
“You think?” Draco interrupted.  His lips tightened and his frown deepened.
The silence after Draco’s question seemed to go on forever, grey eyes and green sending silent messages between them. Finally, Harry spoke softly, “I love you.” Draco’s breath hitched and an involuntary sob escaped before he covered his mouth, stopping any more embarrassing sounds from escaping. “What do you think about that?” Harry asked quietly.
------
“Yes!” Draco leaned over even farther.  “Can I . . .?” Draco reached out one hand.
“Yes, yes, oh fuck, yes!” Draco screamed out as he came hard all over Harry’s hand.  The muscles in his ass clenched repeatedly around Harry as Draco shot all over his hand.  This sent Harry tumbling into his own orgasm, waves of sensation flowing over him as he spilled into Draco.
Harry could hear Atria’s small cries as she woke up downstairs.  He knew, from much experience, if he didn’t tend to her soon they would turn into full-blown wails.  He thought he should take Draco with him and start showing him the ropes, so to speak.  He stopped, on his way downstairs, and knocked on Draco’s door.  Draco answered it quickly, and then just stood there waiting for Harry to speak.  Draco had taken off his suit jacket and tie and unbuttoned the top three buttons of his shirt.  Seeing Draco standing there looking so handsome turned Harry’s already tired brain into mush.  “I . . . uh, she’s waking up,” Harry jerked his thumb in the direction of the stairs, “I should, er . . . you know . . . show you what she, uh . . . needs, and stuff.”  Red in the face with embarrassment, Harry turned away and started downstairs without waiting to see if Draco was following.
Draco spoke slowly, exaggerating each word, “The – elves – at – the – hotel – told – me – they – get – paid!”
Draco stiffened his shoulders and turned away from Harry, “What are you talking about?”
“Fine, Dilly,” Draco sighed. “Leave it here and I’ll get to it.”
“Be that as it may, you both need to change and go to the Headmaster’s office.  He is waiting to speak to you,” she informed them.  She brought the screen back over but since the beds were now pushed together, there wasn’t room for it.  She placed it instead, perpendicular to the end of the beds.  Then she levitated their folded clothing and set them at the foot of the bed.
They fell into each other.  Lips pressing, tears mingling, fingers tangling, tongues sliding.  They broke away laughing and panting for breath.  Joy filled the air around them.  “How do you want to celebrate?” Harry asked, clutching Draco to him.
Harry himself did not have too much contact with Draco.  They took turns caring for Al, and Draco was getting quite good with her.  The few times Harry was able to watch them together, unobserved, had swelled his heart with emotion.  Unfortunately, whenever Draco noticed that Harry was there too, he would hand Al over to Harry and leave the room.
Draco couldn’t tear his gaze away as Potter shrugged on the shirt and started to button it up. Why a man putting on clothes was turning him on, Draco couldn’t say. But this was Potter and it was Draco’s shirt that he was now wearing. Draco knew he had it bad when even the fact that the silk shirt clashed atrociously with the casual joggers Potter was wearing, was not enough to cool down his desire.
“I won’t be leaving,” Harry said as he pulled away from the Healer and went back to Draco’s side.  “Ron, can you find me a chair?  And let Narcissa know?”  Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and threaded his fingers through his unresponsive ones.  “I’ll stay until he wakes up!” he added firmly.
“Harry! Please!” Draco thrust his hips up seeking his touch.
Then all was silent except for the sounds of their heavy breaths as they quieted down.  Even as his body wanted to relax into nothingness, Harry’s brain started racing.  What had they just done?  Malfoy had urged him on, and had touched himself too!  Did this mean something?  Did Harry want it to?
“No, we can wait,” Malfoy was quick to answer. “No need to bother them.”
Remembering the dared kiss with Draco, Harry was determined to stay away from dares. “Uh . . . truth?”
“No, no!  We need to do this now.  I need to know.  Is he or she the reason you didn’t want the bond?  Are they the reason you didn’t want me?” Harry struggled to keep the quaver out of his voice.
“I didn’t sleep well,” Harry grumbled defensively.
“No, that’s just babies,” Harry chuckled.  “With each of us taking turns, we should be able to get close to six hours of sleep!”
Draco’s shoulders relaxed infinitesimally, “Ok.”
“Well, that’s what the elves at the hotel said,” Draco defended himself.
Draco just nodded, his eyes wide as he continued to nibble nervously on his bottom lip.
Their other friends came by frequently, bringing food, and magazines for Harry and Narcissa.  Blaise and Ginny were there almost as much as Ron, and Pansy had come by at least once a day.  Andromeda had also come, leaving Teddy with Molly, and spent almost all of the daylight hours supporting her sister.
“You can let go for a minute,” Harry allowed, as he placed his hands over Draco’s and gently pried them from the headboard.  He then pulled the sleeves of Draco’s shirt off his arms.  He took the time to rub and squeeze the muscles of his arms, releasing the tension.  He then took turns with each of his hands massaging them carefully.  Draco was still looking dazed but his breathing had slowed and he had stopped rocking his hips.  “Do you think you can hold on some more?” Harry asked.  Draco took a deep breath and nodded.  Harry once again brought his hands up and curled them around the headboard.  “Good boy,” Harry whispered, eliciting another groan from Draco.
“Are you still planning on separating?” Draco sat very still, his chest hardly rising and falling with his breaths.
“Go back?” Harry’s green eyes reflected his confusion.
They had been holding the bedside vigil for three days.  Narcissa had come over from France immediately.  Neither she nor Harry had left Draco’s bedside for more than a few brief minutes at a time.  They used quick cleaning charms and transfigured their chairs for sleeping.  Hermione and Ron took turns sitting with them, Ron staying the bulk of the time because Hermione tired easily in her ninth month of pregnancy.
“It’s okay. I saw her and Ron. It’s okay, Draco,” he said softly.
Harry was so caught up in his dreams that when Draco finally stirred, he was still a bit disoriented.  Even so, when Draco made a motion to push away from him, Harry tightened his arms and mumbled into his hair, “I like you right here.”  Draco relaxed back into Harry’s embrace and Harry heard him sigh.
“Did you feel anything, when you two touched?” Dumbledore asked them both.  Both boys’ faces turned red this time and they quickly looked away from each other, answering no.  “Alright then, give us a minute to confer.”  He then pulled both Madam Pomfrey and Thropwaite over into a conversation.
“Harry,” Draco gasped, “need more!”
Dilly tugged on her ear and her smile faltered for a moment before she spoke again. “Master Draco and Harry Potter and Harry Potter’s friend have been working in here a long time.”
A huge thank you to all of you have left kudos and such wonderful comments!  I appreciate them more than you can know.  It is the best gift anyone can give me!
“Nothing.  Well, the blue light went away and I tried to cast the Detection Spell a few times, but nothing happened,” Harry said defensively.
Just then the nurse bustled in, “All right, the party’s over.  Mrs. Granger-Weasley needs her rest.  Mr. Weasley and Mr. Potter may stay, but everyone else needs to leave.  Hermione gave the nurse a grateful smile.  Everyone bustled around with hugs and kisses for Harry, Atria, and Hermione.  At last the room was quiet with just the trio of friends, and the baby they all loved, remaining.  “I have a room prepared for you and your baby, Mr. Potter.  It will allow Mrs. Granger-Weasley to rest more easily,” the nurse said.
“Oh Sirs!” she breathed out reverently.  “Little Miss is being the most beautiful witch!”  Hilly gently cradled the baby in her arms and slowly rocked her.  Then she smiled down at Al and wiggled her ears.  This produced another smile from the baby.
Harry was subdued as he washed and changed for bed.  In an effort to feel closer to him, he decided to sleep on Draco’s side of the bed.  Eventually, he fell into a restless sleep.
“Well, well, well,” he oozed. “Look at that. You… wanting my help… well boys”—he gave a self-satisfied smile—“I’m going to want something in return.”
“She’s perfect,” Harry said with wonderment.
“Yes, flying.  Surely you remember how much you love to fly?” Harry responded.  “We have brooms.  In the shed out back.  What do you say?”
------
Draco shifted uneasily before sitting back down on the settee.  He blew out a breath and Harry notice that it ruffled his bangs.  Draco looked down at his hands as began to speak.  “Mother has told me that you . . .” Draco took a deep breath before he continued, “that you defeated the Dark Lord.”  Draco looked up into Harry’s eyes, “That was a good thing.”
Harry had tried talking to him about it.  He tried during the day, but Draco would stiffen up and change the subject or walk out of the room.  He had tried once at night, but Draco had gotten up and left the room and not returned that night.  So Harry had stopped pushing it, thinking that at least he was getting part of Draco having him in his arms at night.  But this situation was slowly tearing him apart.
Harry risked opening his eyes.  Draco was lying next to him propped up on one elbow.  His smirk widened when he noticed Harry was looking at him.  “Maybe next time you should stick to Butterbeer?” Draco chuckled.
Malfoy interrupted the lengthening silence, “How in Merlin’s name did this happen in the first place?”
“Ah, yeah, I uh, er . . . you know, I,” Harry floundered.
Potter’s gaze swung from Dilly to Draco and back again. “I’m sorry about Narcissa, Malfoy… but I’m not a Healer…”
In the intervening years, Draco had occasionally consulted with the Auror department and he and Potter had maintained a cordial civility. During the past year, it had seemed like Potter was there every time he turned around: showing up at Ministry fundraisers and chatting with Draco over drinks, being at the same pubs during his weekly Friday night out with Pansy and Blaise and inviting himself to join them, and then there were the invitations.
Recognizing that he should keep Potter healthy since he needed his help, not because of any unrequited love on his part, Draco acceded to the elf’s request. “That will be fine, Dilly. You can bring the food, but bring the walking stick first.” Dilly popped away and back in a flash and handed the walking stick to Draco. Then she disappeared and again and returned this time with a large tea tray, piled high with sandwiches and pastries. “Thank you, Dilly,” Draco said and the little elf beamed with delight before popping away again. Potter’s stomach growled again and Draco pushed the tray towards him. “Eat up, Potter, before you perish from hunger.”
Hogwarts was different this year, at least for Harry Potter and his friends.  The school had been rebuilt over the summer, and was pretty much back to normal unless you were returning to redo your seventh year.  Only twenty-seven students had chosen to return and retake their seventh year, fourteen boys and thirteen girls.  There was a mix from all four houses.  Because the dormitories had not been built to contain an eighth year class, and the board did not want to mix the ‘eighth years’ in with the regular seventh years, a new common room and dormitories were created for the eighth years.
“Not that kind of weak, idiot.” Malfoy turned and smiled at Harry, taking all of the sting from the insult.  “I had a dream, and I let myself believe it could be true.”  He made a face and grabbed the bottle back from Harry.  “I should have remembered, Malfoys never get what they want.  It’s just the way things are.”
The first few questions seemed very tame and lulled Harry into a false sense of security.  Then it was Hermione’s turn.  “Harry!” She turned to him. “Truth or dare?”
“No!” Draco shouted before taking a breath and continuing in a calmer tone, “Have you been to the afterlife?” Was it possible Potter was actually going to be able to help him?
Draco stumbled to his feet on the other side of the circle.  “You can’t . . . you don’t . . . you don’t know what you’re saying.” Draco spread his hands out.
“No.  Well . . . I mean, I do . . . but only if you want to . . .” Harry trailed off uncertainly.  This was not going how he had imagined while he was trapped.  He had pictured himself apologizing to Draco and Draco throwing himself into his arms.  Then the two of them would kiss and cuddle.  But he didn’t know how to fix things.  The silence grew oppressive again.  “How long have I been here?”
Harry sat cautiously on the very edge of his chair.  He badly wanted to reach out and grab Draco’s hand, but he didn’t think that would go over very well with the other boy and he wasn’t up to a public rejection right now.  Instead, Harry twisted his fingers together and focused on the hard edge of the chair digging into his thighs.
They didn’t stop to speak to any of their friends as they made their way out of the common room.  Before they knew it they were standing in front of the door to Dumbledore’s office.  Harry was frozen.  He didn’t want to pop the bubble of bliss that had surrounded them yesterday.  He didn’t think he wanted to hear what his Headmaster had to say.  He didn’t want his bond with Draco to end, but he also didn’t want the other man staying with him because he was forced to.  There was no way for Harry to win.
“Yes, yes. Dilly, would you see out Auror Potter?” Draco spoke to the house-elf. He turned to the other man. “Thank you, Potter!” Emotion made his voice rougher than normal.
“That’s an awfully big name for a tiny girl.  I think I’ll call her Al!  First of all, Al, you’re gonna love dragons.  They are the coolest.  And wait until you meet Uncle Charlie, he’s the coolest too!” Teddy focused all of his attention on the baby.  Atria looked up at him solemnly, seemingly listening to every word.
“Oh, that” Harry chuckled.  “Well, my right hand and I have become well acquainted over these last weeks.”
“Hardly!” Harry gave a dark laugh, “I had hardly even kissed anyone at that point.  And for several years after that!”
“Good,” Draco said shortly, looking around the disaster of a room.
“Um… er…” Harry broke eye contact and looked away. Red filled his face and he tried to pull his hand away but Draco tightened his own hand to prevent it.
Harry stood up on unsteady legs.  He pulled off his shirt and then shoved his trousers and pants down to his knees, his cock bobbed as it was released.  He was so turned on by Draco watching, that it wasn’t going to take much to make him come.  He sat back down trying to spread his legs as far as he could, even with them still trapped in his clothes.  Draco’s eyes were riveted on Harry’s prick, and his chest was rising and falling rapidly with his breaths.
Harry agreed that this was a good idea.  As he reached the door he heard Draco accuse, “Did you just call Harry Potter, dear?”
He quickly peeked into Al’s room and saw that she was sleeping in her crib and Hilly was napping in the rocking chair.  Harry spent another minute smiling fondly at the two of them before he raced down the stairs.  He went directly to the safe in the study, extracting something and placing it in his pocket. Then he continued his mad dash down the stairs and outside to the back garden.
All was ready for their date.  Molly was thrilled to get Al all to herself for the afternoon.  Harry had gone out to the shed last night and had cleaned and polished their brooms.  Hilly packed them a picnic lunch.  Harry apparated them both out to a meadow in the countryside that they had used for flying before.  It was the perfect late summer day, warm but with a slight breeze.  Harry handed Draco his broom and set down the picnic basket.  He cast the appropriate wards and muggle rappelling charms.  Then he pulled a snitch out of his pocket, “Care for a match?” he asked with a grin.
“Dying,” Potter said flatly. “Dying wasn’t like that.” Potter was looking at his feet and refusing to meet Draco’s stare.
“For as long as you’ll have me,” Harry replied just as quietly, the smile dropping off his face as a serious expression replaced it. He moved forward until he was standing right in front of Draco, crowding his personal space.
The tears were now sliding unchecked into his hair, as Draco made no move to wipe them away.  “It’s only a matter of time you know,” Draco’s voice was a desperate whisper.
“Where’s Father? Am I under arrest?  Why am I not at Hogwarts?” Draco asked all in a rush.  “Is Father at the Manor, with,” he looked pointedly at Harry, “with our guest?”
Reading the room, Bill merely nodded in assent.  If that’s all, I’ll head back to the Ministry?  Headmaster.  Thropwaite.”  Bill nodded at each man.  “Malfoy.” He clapped Draco on the shoulder and gave him a brief squeeze.  Then he moved to Harry and wrapped his arms tightly around the younger man.  “Remember that you are a Gryffindor and be bold,” he whispered into Harry’s ear. “Faint heart never won fair gentleman!”  Then he stepped over to the Floo and was gone.
They broke off the kiss in order to catch their breath.  “Well, you can say it as much as you like because I am never going to sick of hearing it,” Harry smiled adoringly at Draco.
“Can you tell us what’s happening?” Harry called out toward the two wizards.
“Oi, Hermione!  He just had a house fall on him!  You can’t just grab him!” Ron softened his harsh words by wrapping his arms around his wife.
Green eyes sparking, he demanded, “Malfoy?! What the hell is going on?”
Draco’s eyes flickered with emotion, but Harry couldn’t read it.  “This is the third day,” he said simply.
The light at the windows faded and the room slowly darkened, but the two men entwined on the couch noticed none of this. Hours passed as hands gently stroked all exposed skin, lips caressed and teased each other, fingers tenderly carded through tousled hair, and promises of love were whispered. They didn’t even hear the little elf, who popped in to check on them and then left again with a beaming smile filling her face.
“Come on, Harry,” Ron said as he dragged Harry over to sit in the circle. “It's time for Truth or Dare.”  Hermione set the charms so that the hands of anyone who lied would turn bright green for 24 hours.  Several bottles of Firewhisky appeared and Harry looked over toward Blaise, sure he must be behind that detail.
Malfoy released Harry and they all moved to the front of the room and sat down.  “Well,” Bill began, “Here’s what we know so far.  The curse is one that used to be used frequently in arranged wizarding marriages.  It requires proximity of the cursed parties or they will feel pain similar to a
“No, you have to do it again!  Put your hand over your face.  She likes it when she sees you again,” Draco directed.
Finally, when the need to breathe could no longer be ignored, Harry lifted his lips and then quickly buried his head against Draco’s neck.  Mumbling against his neck, Harry said, “Is that a yes then?”
Draco was already shaking his head no when he realized that there was such an item. “My father’s walking stick,” he blurted out. “The Dark Lord took it from him when he took his wand. He used it to… well, he used it.” Draco preferred not to detail just how often Voldemort enjoyed humiliating his father. He clapped his hands. “Dilly!”
It was true that he thought Malfoy was a fit bloke.  “Who wouldn’t?” he thought.  Tall and slim, he had firm muscles without being bulky and pale blond hair that fell perfectly around his face each day.  And speaking of his face, his pointy nose just fit in with the sharp angles of his jaw and cheekbones.  His lips, those surprisingly warm lips, were the softest palest pink and were just this side of too full.  But most captivating of all were his eyes.  His blond lashes, a shade darker than his hair, framed his dark grey eyes.  Grey that reminded Harry of a stormy sea or a thunder cloud.  Not that Harry had spent much time think about Malfoy.  It was just that he was so hard to miss that naturally Harry’s gaze would be drawn to him.  That really wasn’t Harry’s fault.  And now that Malfoy had kissed him, Harry was having a hard time dislodging Malfoy’s image from his brain.  But that was totally normal, right?
Draco pushed Hermione away from him gently, “Merlin’s bones!  Please don’t tell me I’m married to you too!”
Draco shook his head slowly back and forth. “Malfoys never get what they want.”
When Draco broke away, they were both breathing heavily again.  “Before I married you, someone should have warned me that you were insatiable!”
Granger’s frown deepened as she glanced around the room. “Are you sure there’s nothing?  You didn’t keep anything?”
“You were hot for me?” Harry suggested with a grin.
’ and then the tingling sensation swept over him as the sticky mess was removed from his skin and his pajama bottoms.
“Harry,” Harry automatically corrected, “Last night you called me Harry.”
“What?  Why?  Why would . . .” Harry sputtered.
“Just forget it.” Draco turned away.  “Breakfast is soon and we need to get going.”  He slid from the bed, assuming that Harry would follow.
Now, despite recent history seeming to indicate the opposite, Harry tried to be a laid back kind of guy.  You don’t bother me and I won’t bother you.  But on the question of sexuality, Harry was quite passionate.  He had been wrestling with his own sexual identity, for the last few months.  And he firmly believed no one had the right to out anyone else.  And that was what he said.  Before Blaise could utter a single syllable Harry interjected, “That’s not OK!  What kind of a question is that?  You can’t make someone out themselves, Michael!  Blaise you do not have to answer that.”
Draco didn’t answer right away. Instead, he reached over, cupped Harry’s cheek and caressed it with his thumb.  “Because I want to.”
Harr didn’t know how to begin, the weight of all of his emotions was pressing down on him.  “I . . . er, I’m so sorry.  So sorry, Draco,” his gravelly voice roughened even more with emotion.
------
“We looked so happy,” Draco said sadly.
Harry moved until he was standing directly in front of Draco.  He reached out and grabbed hold of Draco’s wrist and felt the pulse fluttering there.  “It’s true though. You did.  And then when I regained my memory, I pretended too.”  Harry looked into the mists of Draco’s eyes and licked his suddenly dry lips.  He took a deep breath, trying to calm his own racing heart.  “Until suddenly, we weren’t pretending anymore . . . we wanted it to be real.”  Harry’s body swayed, leaning toward the man he loved more than anything.
Draco let go of the bedcovers and brought one hand up to hold the back of Harry’s neck and the other to press against his lower back.  He kissed back furiously as he pulled Harry to him tightly.  He broke away from their kiss to gasp, “Harry!”  Harry took the opportunity to leave a trail of kisses across his cheek.  He stopped to tug his earlobe between his teeth and then began nibbling on that spot behind his ear that never failed to turn Draco to mush.  “Harry!  Merlin!  I . . . I want . . . Merlin, I need you!” Draco groaned.  His hand started to frantically push at Harry’s pajamas.
With his daughter fed, burped and in a fresh nappy, he took Draco upstairs and showed him how to settle her in her crib.  “Try to catch her when her eyelids are heavy and mostly closing, just like this,” Harry whispered.  “If she sleeps too long in your arms, she will wake when you go to lay her down,” he continued quietly.  He held his breath when she didn’t protest and fell asleep.  He put his finger to his lips and motioned with his head toward the door.
Draco’s lips parted and his breath caught in his throat.  “Yes, touch me,” he said softly.
“I’ll just be leaving then.” Potter started edging towards the doorway, making Dilly frown at him.
Hoping that Draco was poisoning him, Harry kept his eyes closed but lifted his head just enough to drink the contents of the bottle.  When he finished he thrust the empty bottle back towards Draco and flopped back onto the bed.  After a minute his head eased and his stomach settled.  “Hangover potion?” he spoke with his eyes still closed.
“Forever?” Draco whispered the question.
“Step back,” the professor ordered and both boys moved back.  Thropwaite cast a different spell on the hairbrush but nothing visible happened.  “That is curious,” he mumbled to himself.  “Alright, students,” Thropwaite said in a loud voice.  “I think that is enough for today.  We will continue tomorrow.  Class dismissed.”  He levitated the brush back up to the front of the room.
------
He decided it wasn’t worth the risk and rolled over to Malfoy’s side of the bed to get out.  He paused for a minute with his head on Malfoy’s pillow when the distinctive sharp citrus scent overwhelmed him.  What the hell was happening to him?  Was this part of the curse?  All he wanted to do was lay here surrounded by Malfoy’s scent.  He even felt his cock responding, starting to harden all over again.
“We need to dress.  Let me go, Potter,” Draco said without meeting Harry’s eyes.
Harry lost track of his daughter as she was passed around among family members.  He was standing on the edge of the group when he saw Teddy over by himself.  Harry went to give his godson a hug, but the boy stiffened up.  “What’s wrong, Teddy?  You feeling ok?” Harry asked.
“Hangover potion,” Draco affirmed.
“We’ll let you know when we make some more progress,” Bill assured them.
“Yes,” Bill said softly.  “Her father.”  Bill’s eyes went back and forth between Harry and Draco.  After a quick look at Draco, Harry looked down at his tangled fingers.
“For trusting me,” Harry said, before giving Draco another gentle kiss.  He slowly pulled back releasing Draco’s lips and dropped to one knee.  Still holding his hand, he looked up at the man he loved more than anything.  “Draco Luscious Malfoy, will you marry me?” Harry’s heart beat anxiously as he waited for an answer.
Harry gave a short bark of laughter, “Ha!  Merlin no!  Not even close.”  Harry realized he really didn’t want to say anymore.  He didn’t want to dwell on how the younger Draco had helped the Death Eaters enter the castle and kill his friends.
Harry played another round of the game, this time paying close attention to Al when he lowered his hand.  “Oh!  There!” he crowed when he saw the baby smile.
“Dilly is not being born yesterday. Dilly will watch while Master Draco is eating.” She gave him her sternest look. She poured him a cup of tea adding milk and sugar just as Draco liked, and slid it over next to him.
Harry was not in a mood to cooperate.  He had liked drinking with Draco last night.  They had had fun.  And this morning, Draco had been playful.  But then he had talked about sex, and Harry had kissed him again.  And it was amazing!  But now Draco was acting like an arrogant arsehole again, and Harry didn’t much like that.  He wanted to get a reaction out of Draco.
Blissed out and boneless, Harry collapsed next to Draco and pulled his sweaty, sticky body into his arms.  Before he lost consciousness, Harry cast a cleaning charm and levitated the blankets back over them.  His last thought was how incredibly perfect it felt to have Draco back in his arms again.
“You mean Malfoy and I were cursed on purpose?” Harry’s voice conveyed his anger and shock.  It had been one thing to think that they had made a mistake and unintentionally triggered this curse, but it was something else entirely to know that someone had intended for this to happen to him.  He turned to Bill again. “What happens if you don’t break it?”
Malfoy closed his eyes and clenched his jaw, but his hands started to move, gently mapping the muscles of Harry’s chest.  Harry dropped his forehead and rested it on Malfoy’s shoulder.  His head felt so heavy and the room was still spinning.  He tried to think, he knew there was something important he was missing.  “We should sleep now,” Malfoy whispered in his ear, pulling Harry down onto the bed.  He ended up lying half on top of Malfoy, but was too comfortable to move.  He heard Malfoy cast
But Harry’s favorite room of all was the one just down the hall, that Draco had just finished decorating.  The nursery was finally ready for their baby girl.  Atria Lily would be here in only one more month.  Hermione had offered to be their surrogate, and she was eight months pregnant.  Hugo and Rose were both excited that their “cousin” was growing in their mom’s belly.  Harry and Draco had conceived with a combination of Muggle medicine and Wizarding magic, therefore their daughter would have genes from both of her fathers.  They were both planning to take some time off of work after the birth, and Draco had surprised Harry by deciding that he wanted to be a stay-at-home dad while Atria was young.
Harry opened his eyes to look lovingly down at the tousled blond hair tickling his cheek.  Merlin, he loved this man!  It had been three years since Draco had come into his room at St. Mungo’s and pretended to be his boyfriend, and those had been the happiest years of his life.  When he had temporarily lost his memory, his attraction to Draco had been overwhelming, and it hadn’t taken them long to make the “pretend relationship” a real one.
“So hot!” Harry growled before giving him a deep kiss, plunging his tongue into Draco’s mouth.  Harry pulled his mouth away, “So fucking hot!”  Harry sat back up and looked approvingly at the man lying underneath him.  “Whatever happens, don’t let go until I say so,” he ordered.
“She and her father have been turned over to the Aurors,” Dumbledore added.  They all sat for a minute listening to the clock ticking and letting this information sink in.
Harry had just lifted his hand to knock when the door swung open.  “Going to stand there all day Potter, or were you planning to join us,” Draco said snidely as he stepped back from the door.  Harry’s eyes ate up the sight of Draco.  He was wearing a crisp black shirt with black trousers and a green and black striped tie (not quite his house tie).  He looked amazing.  The dark clothing was a perfect foil for his blond hair and ice grey eyes.  He looked amazing and entirely unapproachable.  Harry’s heart sank.
Harry blasted through whatever wards may have been in place and landed with a loud crack.  He looked around to see a startled Narcissa starting to rise from a chaise lounge, and an angry Draco brandishing his wand.
“We cast the spell correctly, Professor,” Malfoy defended.  “We didn’t touch the object.”
“Harry!” he gasped out. “He stayed… I need to get back… I can’t…” Draco turned to blindly walk back into the Veil but Granger and Weasley pulled him back.
“What is it? What do you not want to tell me?” Draco asked urgently, panicking a bit. What was Harry keeping from him? Was this only temporary? “If you have to go back, I’m going too!” he blurted out.
He lifted a finger to gently push back a lock of hair that had fallen across Draco’s eyes.  Draco murmured something Harry couldn’t understand and moved closer to Harry.  He pushed his face into Harry’s neck, and just seemed to burrow there.  Harry’s heartbeat stuttered before falling back into a normal rhythm.  Was this love?  Harry thought this might be love.  He realized, quite fiercely, that he would do anything to protect the man in his arms.  Anything at all!
The rest of them moved as a group up to the infirmary.  Theo and Blaise still supporting Malfoy, and Ron and Hermione doing the same for Harry.  Thropwaite hurried ahead and when they reached the hospital wing, he was busy conferring with Madame Pomfrey.
“Not in Azkaban, Potter. Not alive.” Draco’s voice clogged up with despair. Potter’s grip on his arms tightened painfully. “It was the Dark Lord.”
Oh, fuck!  This felt good!  He squeezed just right as he moved his hand along his shaft.  Another small moan broke free.  He needed this so badly.  He wanted to speed up, but he kept his hand motions slow, not wanting to jostle the bed.  His thumb swept over the head and pushed around the wet stickiness that was leaking there.  Fuckfuckfuck!
Harry looked over at Draco’s smirking face.  He truly wished he could have the pumpkin juice or a nice ale, but he refused to give Draco the satisfaction of asking for it.  Instead, he held up his glass toward Draco.  “Wine, of course, Draco.”  When his glass was poured, Harry took a sip and struggled to hide his grimace at tasting the tart liquid.
He looked down at the sight in front of him.  Draco’s red lips were parted and he was panting.  His cock was hard and wet, lying against his stomach.  His whole body was tense, poised for Harry’s next move.  Harry moved up on his knees.  He hooked his hands under Draco’s legs and bent his knees, pushing them back and up.  He exposed Draco’s balls and hole to his gaze.  Draco made a soft whining noise and shifted, causing his ass to wiggle enticingly.  “Grab your legs and hold them back,” Harry ordered huskily.  Draco complied with another moan and it left Harry’s hands and mouth free to play.
“Fuck, Draco!  You feel so good!  Oh, fuck!” Harry pushed in this time more forcefully than he had intended.
“Dying?” Draco scoffed. “You haven’t died Potter! I think I would have heard about it if The Savior of the Wizarding World had died.”
Draco’s hand on his hip turned bruising and he slammed their hips together.  Harry whimpered when he felt his hard-on pressing against him, pushing against his own hard and aching cock.  Draco’s grey eyes lit up with desire.  He tightened his grip on Harry making him gasp and traced his tongue along the inside of Harry’s open mouth.  He broke away and rested their foreheads together.  Harry closed his eyes against the powerful wave of want and need that swept over him.  “I want . . . fuck!  I want you inside me!” Draco’s dark voice crashed over Harry, and he moaned with the pleasure it gave him.
It had been about a week since their date and Draco was still not initiating any kisses.  They had, however, progressed to spending more time together, and Draco didn’t automatically leave the room anymore when Harry entered it.  This evening Draco had come and joined Harry on the couch, where he had been playing peek-a-boo with Al.
“Please, please Draco,” Harry begged mindlessly.  He was so primed it wasn’t going to take much to tip him over the edge.  Draco’s fingers finally reached his dick but they only traced over it lightly.  Harry writhed against the cold tile wall, spreading his legs and arching his back.  “Please!”
Draco held himself rigidly.  Even though he was only a foot away from Harry, it felt like miles.  “I wouldn’t want to impose,” he said stiffly.
”Yes?” Draco questioned, not sure where she was going with this.
“Very funny, Potter,” Draco scoffed.  “You know I did no such thing!”
“Oh.” Harry calmed down until he had another thought. “Did I . . . we . . . I, er  . . . do anything else?”
Harry remained stubbornly on one knee, “And as you have pointed out, many times, you have no memory of it!  So . . . Draco . . . will you do me the honor of becoming my husband?  Right here.  Right now.  Just for us!”  Harry held his breath, honestly not sure what Draco would do now?
“Not too much of that, or I won’t last,” Harry warned, as he thrust up into Draco’s hold.
Harry’s panic-stricken eyes met Draco’s across the wide room.  What the hell was happening?  Draco was shaking his head no in slow motion, but that didn’t stop Pansy and Blaise from dragging him into the circle.
“Oh, fuck!” Harry groaned.  Malfoy was wanking too!  Harry resumed the slide of his hand over his aching flesh.  He sped up now that he didn’t have to worry about waking Malfoy.  He pushed his hips into his hand and moaned loudly.  He was going to come quickly.  This was too much after so long.
Harry supposed it shouldn’t have come as a surprise that Malfoy was a homophobe considering his previous prejudice against Muggles, but it made Harry unaccountably angry.  The game moved on and the spotlight was no longer on Blaise and Harry, but every time he gazed in Malfoy’s direction he found him looking right back with a frown on his face.  Harry was pulled from his speculations when he heard Malfoy’s name.
Harry was halfway through his meal, which turned out to be delicious but still unidentifiable, when Draco broke the silence.  “What is it you do exactly?” Draco asked in a polite but remote tone.
He took a deep breath and took both of Draco’s hands in his, softly running his thumbs across the back of them.  “Draco Luscious Malfoy, today I take you for my husband. I believe in you, the person you are and will grow to be, the parents we will be to Al and any other children we may be blessed with, and the family will make together. With my whole heart, I take you as my husband, knowing and accepting your faults and strengths, as you do mine. I promise to love you without reservation, comfort you in times of distress and let you comfort me, encourage you to achieve all of your goals, laugh with you and cry with you, grow with you in mind, and spirit, always be open and honest with you, and cherish you for as long as we both shall live.  You are my love and my life, today and always.”
“Aah,” Draco whined, as he tried to push back into the hand on his ass.  Harry barely dipped his fingers to brush against his pucker.  “Fucking tease, Potter,” he growled pushing up and glaring at Harry.  Draco pushed one leg between Harry’s and pressed against his erection, and rubbed his own cock on Harry’s leg.
Malfoy kicked off his shoes and headed toward their bed. Not really understanding what was going on, Harry followed suit.  When they were both sitting up against the headboard Malfoy opened the whisky, put the bottle to his lips and threw back his head to swallow.  Harry watched with fascination as his Adam’s apple moved when he swallowed.
Harry pulled his fingers free and lifted Draco’s ass to rest against his thighs, tilting it up at a better angle.  He used more lube to slick up his aching prick.  Locking eyes with him again, Harry used one hand to position his own cock and the other to stroke Draco’s.  He placed the tip against Draco and pushed against the resistance, feeling the hot tight channel close around him.
Harry slowly pulled himself together, disappointment crushing him as he came crashing down rudely from his orgasm.  It had felt so good to come with Draco’s touching him.  He had thought they were making progress, but Draco had pulled back again and Harry didn’t know where they stood.
Harry moved through the doorway, bringing himself very close to Draco.  He took a deep breath and clenched his hands to prevent himself from taking the other man into his arms and kissing him senseless.  No matter how strong his desire, he knew Draco would probably just hex him if he tried that.  Instead, when he drew parallel to him, he leaned toward him and whispered, “It’s good to see you Draco.”  Without waiting for a response, Harry continued into the spacious room and toward Narcissa, whom he spotted standing over by the windows.
Harry wanted, he ached, and he needed Draco.  He needed more, but he wasn’t sure what it was.  He twisted himself around, the warm water helping his skin to slide over Draco’s.  Draco’s hands were still on his hips, but this time he was facing him.  Harry rested his hands on Draco’s shoulders to steady himself.
Slowly Draco’s lashes fluttered and sleepy grey eyes were looking back at Harry.  He didn’t seem surprised or upset by how close Harry was lying next to him, just cautious.  He didn’t pull away, so Harry kept stroking his hair.  “Hi,” Harry breathed out.
In Harry’s humble opinion, Saturday had been the best day of his life.  The day had been spent entirely with just the two of them.  They had endlessly explored each other’s bodies.  No square inch had been left untouched, unstroked, unkissed, and unlicked.  Harry had lost count of the number of orgasms he had had, and of the number of times he had watched Draco’s face suffused with his own pleasure.
“That’s not . . . I don’t . . .,” Draco sputtered.  “Our shower is considerably smaller than the Slytherin locker room.  There’s just not room.”
His patience was rewarded when Draco whispered, “Potter,” and leaned forward to brush his lips against Harry’s.  Draco’s hands came up to fist in Harry’s t-shirt and drag him closer.
“No, Granger,” Draco mocked. “Funnily enough we weren’t interested in souvenirs of his time in our home.”
Draco had been in the kitchen making tea and fussing with their Muggle toaster, in a way that never failed to make Harry laugh.  Except it didn’t this morning.  Harry had woken up again alone, bed empty, and tears had filled his eyes.  Was this his life now?  This half empty existence.  He had wearily walked downstairs to the kitchen, and found Draco there, fully dressed, making breakfast.
Harry’s arms tightened around Draco again as he pictured his baby in the arms of his husband.  Draco squirmed against him, causing his hips to rock against him.  Draco was hard, and Harry liked it.  He moved one hand down to his ass to rock him again.  Draco, half-awake now, took up the rhythm and pushed his hard cock against Harry’s hip.  Draco turned his head and mouthed slowly at his neck.  “Harry,” he sighed in a breathy whisper.
“Would you want to show me?” Draco whispered.  When Harry remained silent, Draco looked up at him, biting his lower lip.
“Of course, Hilly.  What can we do for you?” Draco responded, slowly edging away from Harry.
A ghost of a smile crossed Potter’s lips. “Well that should be enough of a lure to get Hermione here. She’s never met a library that she didn’t want to plunder for reading materials.” He made a vague gesture to the doorway. “So I’ll just go then…”
“Did you touch just the wand, or did you touch Mr. Malfoy?” the older wizard continued his questioning.
“M’ hot.” Harry was starting to feel better, but thought he should really get rid of his trousers too.  He reached down and started unfastening the flies.
Draco whirled back around to face him.  “Don’t be obtuse, Potter!  You were there!  You spoke to the doctors.  Do you think I wouldn’t give anything to remember?” Draco defended himself.
“Ok then,” Harry felt oddly deflated.  “Let me cast the baby monitoring charm on your wand.”
“How about we do something fun tomorrow?  I’m sure I can get Molly to watch Al,” Harry smiled, warming up to his impulsive idea.  “We can go flying.”
Draco pulled away, and turned his back on Harry, “I don’t remember any of that.”  He leaned against the mantle and looked down at the carpet.  “I can’t imagine it.  It’s like you are talking about an entirely different person.”

“I’m sorry, Mr. Malfoy, she’s dying.” The private Malfoy Healer put a hand on Draco’s shoulder to comfort him but the weight of the news had Draco sinking to his knees anyway.
“What . . . um . . . what changed?  I mean . . . why you didn’t want to stay before?” he finally asked.  Draco pulled away and flopped onto his back.  Harry knew he was fucking this up and he was afraid of scaring Draco off, but if he was going to fix things he needed to know what had gone wrong.
Harry thought about just going to sleep himself, but his stomach chose that moment to grumble loudly.  He went to the kitchen and quickly assembled his supper of tea and beans on toast.  He sat in the kitchen to eat and regarded the room around him.  It was as messy, if not more, than the rest of the house.  He knew he should probably try and straighten up before Hilly arrived tomorrow, but he was just too exhausted.
Harry was so lost in his appreciation he almost didn’t notice when Malfoy held the bottle out to him.  Without thinking about it he took a mouthful and swallowed, coughing and choking as the fire hit his throat.  He leaned forward trying to catch his breath and Malfoy gave him a few good thumps on his back.  “It figures I’m bonded to a lightweight, Potter,” Malfoy complained.
He went straight to the potions floor, the one where Draco normally worked.  He grabbed the first Mediwitch he saw.  “Cassie, where’s Draco?  Where do they have him?” he asked impatiently.
“But, that’s not, I didn’t, he wouldn’t . . .,” Harry sputtered.
“What the fuck was that?” Malfoy asked his voice raw and rough.
“Time for what?” Harry asked as he turned away from the stove.  He moved over to her side.
“Alright then,” Draco mounted his broom and nodded at the snitch Harry was still holding, “Let’s do it!”
“Lift up then,” Harry directed, as he grasped the waistbands of both the trousers and pants and pulled them down Draco’s legs and then swept them onto the floor.  Harry moved to kneel between his long legs, pushing them apart and relishing the sight of Draco spread out before him.  His stomach muscles were clenched and a pale golden trail led down to his hard cock.  It looked perfect to Harry, longer and thinner than his own, it jutted up eagerly, rosy tip peeking out from the foreskin. Harry ran his hand down Draco’s stomach, feeling the muscles jump beneath his touch.  He toyed with the soft hairs, stroking all around but avoiding his hard prick.
