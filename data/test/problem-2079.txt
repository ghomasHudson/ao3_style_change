The manor that had been in the hands of Vykélari for ages had been build to accommodate their needs or offer certain luxuries that would not be needed by normal wizards. That ranged from frescos which had been worked out with a special kind of paint that showed ultraviolet over wide balconies that would allow a Vykélari to land and start from comfortably even with their huge wingspan, and to walls that had been spelled soundproofed. When Harry asked why anyone would need that, Draco explained that most Vykélari tended to keep their improved visual, acoustic and tactile senses permanently.
“I was asked to come here in order to tend to Potter once they sent him through.” He said. ”They suspected he’d be injured.”
Within Harry, the clouds of magic, the volatile and impermanent mists and sparks that had a tendency to solidify into streams and swirls only sporadically, condensed at once without warning to form sharp, gleaming needles that were pulled faster and faster towards his centre like stars that came too close to a black hole. Harry gasped, sensing the tension, the maleficent intent and excitement that was his own, partly at least, but unchecked – unhindered – by mercy, by understanding and morals. Like an implosion his magic drew together all at once but it wouldn't stop, he could see it clearly: with the incredible acceleration of speed with which his magic was rushing towards its invisible centre, it would pass it and fly in the opposite direction, unleashing its ferocious fury on whatever stood in its way.
His head was still reeling from the implication of that thought when Zabini stepped forward and laid his right hand on Malfoy's shoulder, squeezing slightly. "Listen, Potter, you really need to know about your inheritance, about the laws of our kind. Laws that overrule the laws of the ministry whenever in conflict. Moreover, you need to learn how to control your abilities and how to curb your magic. We can show you how."
"Feels good?" A low, amused whisper against a sensitive ear and predictably Blaise's eyes flashed in indignation and he reached back for his lover and pulled him close by his soft, silken strands; turning, twisting his own upper body to encounter the pale lips with the ferociousness that Draco seemed to be after.
"Severus Snape's spying potion." The portrait said with an air of nonchalance and a fairly intricate hand wave, never leaving him out of his sight.
When the Italian had contacted her the day before and told her about Harry Potter's new status as a Vykélari submissive, she had assumed that they would force him to mate and then keep him on a tight leash. They weren't supposed to give him a choice. They weren't even supposed to grant him so much leeway. Narcissa and Lucius both would be furious if they knew. Amalyne, too, probably; but Pansy didn't know her that well.
A moment later, more of the relaxing warmth seeped from Blaise into Harry's body like a downy blanket, following the tiny sparks that freely flowed between them; slowly, gradually taking effect, prodding, soothing and comforting oh so gently that Harry was none the wiser and he found himself tilting his head, so that his forehead pressed tightly against Blaise's neck and he closed his eyes, his unease and hesitation gradually disintegrating like mist under the warming sun. And his thoughts turned into another direction: if he thought closer about that day, it hadn't felt like a victory at all; rather, he had been so burned out afterwards. Admittedly the last few days had been wonderful in that regard, bringing him back to life in a way he hadn't thought possible. He wanted to stay here, he loved the flying, he loved those connections. God, he even loved having the chance to fight with Draco again. It was just so
Since it seemed to be a rhetoric question anyway and he felt too tired to answer, Harry kept his silence and laid still. Draco was such a drama queen, honestly, thinking Harry would die from that single bout of accidental magic; Harry might have told him that, too, had his skull not felt as if someone as powerful as Dumbledore himself had cast
But Taide only went completely stiff and still beneath him, his narrow lips drawn into a tight line and his eyes clenched shut against the dirt on his face, his expression distorted into a pained grimace.
Even though… if Harry had been in Slytherin, if he had befriended Draco and Pansy and Blaise instead of Granger and Weasley, he would not have lived long enough to see his 222nd full moon. It was the unadorned truth, nothing more and nothing less. And what a humbling, shameful truth it was; one of the sobering few (but considering his blood status surprisingly numerous) reasons of his budding respect for Harry's friends, next to Granger's obvious brilliance and the few glimpses of a tactical, sharp mind Weasley had occasionally shown.
Something in the Italian's expression made Harry wonder if this was more than a simple suggestion, a test maybe. The way Blaise kept looking at him, waiting for an answer as if it would decide all their future dealings…
For a moment, there was silence between them until Draco gave a conceding shrug. What could he say? Blaise was after all right…
“Are they even safely in Italy or was that just a lie to get us to stay away?” She chuckled darkly, a harsh and cynical sound in the crisp silence. ”You certainly made sure to let us know we weren’t welcome.“
He hadn't even reached the stylized tree and the artful painting of the sun-lit, two-storey library which hung at eye level at the only cubic part of the pillar that was carved right into its middle, when the black clad form of his ancestor stepped onto one of the balconies overlooking the reading room beneath.
That seemed to shock Potter into immobility quite effectively: his wings froze in mid-air, fluttering for some seconds before they fell to the ground, all strength drained from them.
"This roof garden has been used by my father's ancestor's for generations to teach newly fledged Vykélari how to fly. I myself learned it here, too. My cousin taught me and he was also the one who guided me through my transformation."
In the remaining limbo, Harry was left trembling, kneeling on the ground with his fingernails clawing into the narrow gaps between small, white and black tessera beneath him, until his knuckles were white and his nails just shy of splintering. His breath didn't come easily for a few moments as he tried to get used to the sensation of his skin being too small for his body, too small to encompass his flesh and bones and magic at the same time.
"Blaise told me what he did..." Draco had said after some moments in a rare show of straight-forwardness and Harry had barely refrained from groaning, suddenly having a rather good – and rather mortifying – idea of what might have happened. So Blaise had told his fiancé that he had kissed another man, which had lead to the two of them screwing each other passionately, madly (and probably silly) for who knew how long? At least it explained why they both had come fresh from a shower. Wonderful. Now Harry also made them behave irrationally when he wasn't even there...
Contacting the floating restaurant of Venice proofed to be a waste of time, since he could not find any proof of the three young Vykélari having been there.
Perhaps, if Severus were a man who cared more for the easily offended sensibilities and often rashly formed opinions of his fellow wizards, he might have chosen a less morbid, and equally less practical method, especially with the boy’s persistent deadly paleness and shallow breathing. But as it was, the potions master cared more for comfort and practicality than irrational feelings, and he didn’t see why he should make this duty any more difficult for himself when he was already unable to use magic to clean the boy or even shift him around.
"Look at you:" he scoffed, "so protective of someone so undeserving! Almost unable to mate another, because your magic is already so used to theirs. And why? Because they helped you through your inheritance when you were at your weakest! Like a hatchling imprinting on the first thing it sees… "
"I hope the two of you know what you are facing." Severus muttered while Lucius frowned next to him.
In any case, Draco had halted in his steps the moment he laid eyes upon him and for a few timeless seconds they had just stared at each other in expectant silence, like two predators about to throw themselves into a territorial fight and Blaise had had the sudden urge to spread his wings and screech a warning at the other dominant to retreat. That same need was reflected in the flexing of Draco's shoulders and the miniscule tightening of his eyes.
Down in the heart of Damask Tower the white-golden light of an early morning filtered through the magical high ceiling windows, throwing long shadows into the room and overpowering the flickering flames of the blazing fireplace and the couple of candelabras that were still burning. The unnatural cold of the cooling charms was still lingering crisp and fresh in the air, making it feel as if it was a winter morning dawning upon an abandoned summer castle where the rooms were too high for even the attempt at keeping them heated throughout the year.
And while Harry was conscious and in full possession of his magic he would cast off almost any spell that attempted to bind him or keep him back or even slow him down.
"And you, Harry? No idea at all?" Blaise asked, gently coaxing. They had asked before but Harry had evaded the question and they had told him of their plans instead. Of course, Harry knew that it would be only polite to reciprocate, but…
"And have you apparate away the second they leave? I think not. And apropos apparition: before you do something rash and get a nasty surprise: do not try and apparate to your friends. We put them on a muggle vehicle traveling through the air. A plane, if I am not mistaken."
“That’s why you love me so much. Besides it was only fair after he teased us the whole time with that body just screaming ‘mark me’.”
Draco disliked store rooms, the inevitable disarray and the mouldy smell of dust; large rooms cluttered with useless clobber that was either too precious to be thrown away but had been replaced by something worthier of the space in one of the actually inhabited rooms of the manor; or they were tokens kept in one's possession out of some sense of indebtedness because they had been tasteless gifts from friends and family. Either way Draco felt that one would be best advised to just sell the stuff and make it to money before it lost all its value.
At least with Hermione and Ron there was trust and honesty and maybe it was naïve of him, but they had faced worse situations in the past and had always come out on top, he just
The worst was, that in the end he couldn't even hear the exact moment their colibrí finally left, the quiet sounds that he made – someone used to walk and move as quietly as an owl on a hunt – were too low even for his ears to pick up, easily getting lost in the noise of the guardia as they fastened bracelets around his and Draco's wrists that would notify them the moment one of them set foot outside of the manor as well as enable them to locate the two of them wherever they went. He strained his ears, attempting to follow Harry for as long as he could but however much he tried, he couldn't identify the moment his uncle and Harry were finally gone.
"We agreed that we'd not force him! Harry isn't ready to mate." Blaise hissed back, aggressively enough that Draco brushed his wrist fleetingly to calm him some. This was not a battlefield where they could afford to let emotions rule their line of attack.
The painted Malfoy leaned forward, his mercilessly blunt speech and piercing eyes boring into Draco, but now his tone changed, the words seemed to drip slowly from his lips, a deadly trap like resin for an insect. "Can your Gryffindor accept the presence of a murderer, a torturer over a polite conversation and a cup of tea? Do you want him to be able to? Will you force him to?"
Draco didn't ask what his ancestor was talking about. It was clear to him that the other man was referring to Ives' opinion of what had become of the Malfoy name. And of course Draco knew that the little anecdotes that the submissives had shared over breakfast were all too true and that there were neither excuses nor explanations that would make the stories any less atrocious. But one didn't speak of the black pages in the family history – which every family had. Shameful secrets should remain just that: secrets. It had been wrong of Ives to use them to entertain Harry. Was Adler so besotted with his red-haired submissive that he would take his side no matter what? Besides: he hadn't come to Adler for another lesson in humility over their family.
It took a moment for him to grasp and understand the image that presented itself to him, but when it did, it appalled and shocked him all the worse: Harry had attacked Draco! He had attacked him and his fiancé was bent forward, curling around some hidden pain, clutching at his stomach with his wings hunched up behind him and Blaise couldn't see his face, couldn't see how bad it was, how badly he might be hurt. His platinum blonde hair fell messily into his brow and eyes and Harry had taken him by the scruff of his neck. By Mordred, he must have kneed him!
A sudden flash of concern permeated through their still active connection as Blaise caught up on his darkening mood and tried to guess what had caused it. Was Harry still nervous about his safety after knowing what a dominant could do to him if he wasn't careful? Blaise couldn't fault him for that, if it was the case. With firm movements he rubbed over Harry's back, trying to ease away the tenseness in his sore muscles and the gloominess he was sending off in rippling waves. "Don't worry, no one knows that you are here, you're absolutely safe."
“That is not true!” Narcissa cried out, enraged, but Severus noticed that she couldn't quite bring herself to meet his eyes.
Of course the last thing she or Lucius could need right now was to have their family name mentioned in association with the abuse of a submissive, especially if that submissive was the acclaimed Boy-Who-Lived-Half-A-Dozen-Times-More-Often-Than-He-Should-Have. Already the mood in the wizarding community was more volatile and far more difficult to handle than an Erumpent-horn. A mere push in the wrong direction and it would all explode into their faces.
And all the while those images and sensations popped up in front of his mind's eye like flashes of a dream.
At those words, Harry's heart made a distinct leap and now he really felt reminded of the day he had first flown on a broom on the grounds of Hogwarts, without any gloomy thoughts of pain remembered; with the transformation now behind him, all he felt was the nervous excitement, the fear of embarrassing himself, of failing, the anticipation of being free of the ground and do something that mankind had always dreamt of: flying.
Silence spread between the three of them, not awkward, nor comfortable, only full of unspoken thoughts and regrets and unsaid apologies.
Harry shook his head, trying to look nonchalant, but quite sure that he wasn’t succeeding with his face heating up like this. Well, biting
All around him bodies crashed into the foliage and dirt, shouts and high squeals of surprise and grunts of pain filling the air before being cut off by gruesome thuds, followed by a few seconds of loud cracking and rustling as his companions, too, came to a rolling stop.
Harry closed his eyes as he felt the dizzying embarrassment of that specific memory rush to his cheeks and huddled closer into the warm comfort of his feathers, feeling them brush softly against his bare torso. How could he have let it happen? How could he have been so helpless? Letting two Slytherins care for him, hold him, direct his magic!
. Nonetheless he murmured a barely discernible "Okay." And hoped that would suffice… Merlin, he had never known Slytherins could be so prone to worrying and protectiveness.
Still Narcissa swallowed down the acidic words. There was no need to voice what both of them knew to be true.
"Why so hostile, Potter?" The darker of the two murmured, his low voice like a caress. "And so silent. Still unable to speak?"
competitions. And why not? He was, after all, to be the dominant in their relationship. Or one of them in any case.
Draco nodded and raised his chin with the air of someone determined to face his fate with dignity. "At least until the school term starts, you should consider moving into a safe house with your family. If you have no suitable place to stay, I could provide one. But it is not exactly a secret that you and Harry are close and now that Harry's status as a submissive is known, you might be targeted."
They had dived a few metres down to a rock formation at the ground of the sea that was overgrown with colourful corals and sponges and it was as if everywhere Harry looked he saw something moving: sea snails in the oddest shapes, jelly fishes that Blaise made him avoid, and a wide variety of other fishes that Harry had never seen before.
It all happened in the blink of an eye and it was simply not enough time to stop it entirely, but Harry set himself against the flood with single-minded, desperate determination, gathering as much of his magic as he could to redirect most of the attack, pushing the pulsing streams into a tight coil that lead back to himself, into a frighteningly energetic maelstrom of magic that raged within his chest, making his heart jump and race, his lungs drawing air until they were close to bursting.
Zabini chuckled warmly as he sat down to Harry's right. "In Lanai Manor. Well, my mother calls it Zabini Manor since I inherited it after my father's death, but the locals still call it Lanai Manor."
It hadn't exactly endeared the girl to him, but nonetheless Blaise felt touched that Astoria was trying to defend them. At least someone was.
If Weasley and Granger died, though, he'd be lucky if the sometimes hot blooded teenager would not enact some form of revenge …
"Fuck you, Valerio! Everything would be better than mating one of your wretched family! Now release my friends!"
Valerio pursed his lips derisively, his long fingers twisting at his side. "Brave words for someone with the reputation of trying everything to not damage his enemies permanently."
Harry whipped his head around and there stood the man it belonged to, only a few meters away from him when ten thousand would have been too close, his wand still raised from binding Harry's magic.
"But of course." The other answered, his thoughtful eyes dancing to the side. "I believe we were talking about 'incentives', were we not? Well, it seems that Ives bought young Harry's cooperation by promising to tell him how to force you and Blaise into giving him a portkey back to London on the 31st of August."
For the sick pleasure and greed of a madman who wanted to enslave him. Tears of rage and grief clouded his eyes and overflowed, pouring down his cheeks and dropping to wet the tiles beneath his head. No, Harry couldn't live like this…
I know, Draco and Blaise are not very likeable right now, but they are going to become nicer, I promise!
Oh, what wouldn’t he have given for James Potter to lie still and helpless before him like this only once. The things he could, would have done to him given that one golden chance...
With a swift movement he exchanged the sponge in his hand for the familiar length of his ebony wand and slipped around the medical table. Almost as an afterthought, Severus directed a towel to cover his young charge from the hip down to preserve what little dignity he had left just as Narcissa reached the bottom of the stairs. Her head swivelled back and forth, searching, until finally she whirled around and her blazing gaze settled on Severus.
"In a land where the ministry can regulate what the press writes, where they … Merlin! You remember Umbridge?" He asked, not waiting for an answer. "She used a Blood Quill on me so often that the scars are going to be with me for the rest of my life. She was going to use the Cruciatus on me! You were there, Draco, you were there! You heard her confess to sending the Dementors after me, to kiss me! What a country is this where such a person is not prosecuted?" Tiredly he looked away from Draco's bowed head and Blaise's anguished face.
"Harry?" He tried to get the other's attention and from the way startled forest-green eyes jumped to his own, he had been deeply in thought, indeed. "Don't let Draco's enthusiasm pressure you into anything. Or my opinion for that matter. I know that you do not like publicity much, everyone knows that. It's just: I think one should only complain about things that can and should be changed and only when willing to invest oneself to achieve those changes."
Gritting his teeth, Blaise waited for the uncomfortable travel to be over and wished it would never end. Because at the end of it there would be Harry, insane and dangerous according to Draco. Or worse: broken or even… dead.
good friends were watching those three officials during their waking hours. That way Lucius, Draco and Narcissa had always known just what line of action would benefit them the most, had known when their house would be searched for dark artefacts and how to avoid suspicion.
Blaise felt his lips part in consternation as he stared at his mother. "You cannot possibly think that you could ever keep something like that a secret."
It galled him how they could appear so easy in their mind about all of this, more than he cared to admit at the moment, and he balled his fists, watching and fuming as Malfoy's pale form shifted forward on his chair until he sat on the very edge. What was he doing…?
"Step behind me and lay your hand on my back, like before. This way you will also be able to see the transformation. If at any point you become too uncomfortable, just break the bodily contact between us and the magical connection should collapse."
For a few moments he remained silent, his one free hand gliding over the luxuriously smooth fabric of the bed cover, before he gave Blaise a long sideway glance out of the corners of his eyes and conceded with a voice far too sober and dry to be mistaken with remorse "maybe I shouldn't have tried to raise your jealousy with Pansy's help in revenge."
They had objectified a great young man as a powerful tool, marginalized him in the worst way possible. The consequences of their actions were equally real as they were tragic and the horrifying sense of rightness suffusing this screwed kind of justice burned hotly through his throat.
But driven by her guilt and the wish to rectify her mistake, Giallina had asked to be allowed to keep at least one eye on their guest whenever her duties allowed it, especially during those times when the Gryffindor was alone. She had therefore been the obvious choice when Blaise had to decide on a House Elf to give to Ives. It relieved her from her usual duties and gave her more time to see to Harry's safety, a task she took very seriously, more so than maybe any other Elf in his employ. Besides, she was of a very gentle nature and he thought both Harry and Ives would be comfortable with her.
And really, he hadn't quite forgiven him for that, though he was inclined to condone it most of the time, seeing how Severus had helped his son during the war and how he had assisted their whole family immediately and without hesitation during the difficult time of the trials.
"I will send you that spying potion also, in case he gets lost." Severus said. With Potter's heightened magical strength he might detect normal tracking charms, but the spying potion was veritably undetectable.
"Anything what? Two months ago you were perfectly fine with giving him over to You-Know-Who. Don't think I forgot that. You know, to me it seems there are dozens of candidates out there - even Vykélari - who are more suitable for Harry than you, especially when it comes to looking after his safety. At least most of them didn't try to kill him! Merlin! You've got some nerves..."
At least this dominant Vykélari might be rational enough to make negotiations possible. Cold enough to consider the consequences of his actions even over the crude, raw threats Harry was about to make.
For a moment, Blaise assessed the number of the small creatures that with their short legs and too long arms seemed so unsuited to take on a young Vykélari. But he had heard the stories of the Battle of Hogwarts from the lips of direct witnesses, had read the gruesome reports and he knew of his servants' worth. A group so large might still not be a match for the average submissive, but with the moment of surprise on their side and with Harry still so painfully untrained and probably not in his right mind, Blaise was confident that they would be able to take him on nonetheless. They had to!
“Couldn’t you send someone? He is growing weaker by the minute. At this rate, he won’t last the night… ”
They spent the rest of the afternoon and most of the evening down at the beach, being served iced tea and later a bake of rice pudding and peaches by the house elves.
Now that really ticked Blaise off! They had refused to let Cowen into the room, because that asshole had tied their Harry down with leather stripes that had chafed open his sensitive skin at the ankles and wrists and had not even treated the wounds; and because he had bound his wings together into an impossible position that had made the muscles cramp painfully... damn it, Harry had been scared to death! Remembering the desperate warning signals the poor submissive had emitted still made his flesh crawl.
"Your magic can't be controlled like that anymore, Harry." Draco shook his head. "If you just tap it a little bit, you can still direct it with a wand just like you used to." Draco proceeded, his voice losing a little bit of the tightness while the blond lost himself in the explanation.  "Most Vykélari choose to do that because focusing your magic otherwise into very specific effects outside of certain ... let's say spatial boundaries, is neigh to impossible for most, and even for those who are able to do it, it is very difficult and demanding. But the whole of your magic will protect you, even from yourself." He thought for a moment, pursing his lips. "Imagine it like the accidental magic of children, just more self-decided and sentient."
Crouching low to the ground in the vague hope of appearing non-threatening, Draco fanned his wings out and did what his instincts told him to: he pushed his magic to the surface of his body, letting it swirl over his feathers, suffusing it with the soothing, calming touch that they had already used on Harry in the hospital on the night of his 222nd full moon.
If only both portkeys had been activated, she wouldn't have worried so much, would simply have assumed that the boys had been faced with some attacker, some vengeful Death Eater on the run, and had to escape from an ugly situation.
Blinking once, twice, Harry tilted his head, frowning at them as if he doubted their intelligence. "I know!"
But the entrapment held and as the pointlessness of fighting against it registered, when he was forced to realise that it was either giving up for now or completely and uselessly exhausting himself, his magic sizzled and vibrated and pushed once more so strongly and furiously that Harry felt the strain of its force against his ribcage, as if he had breathed in too deeply. Then, just as suddenly, it curled back, vibrating with ominous potential like a lion ducking low to the ground, lying in wait for its chance to attack.
After all, the books had also made it clear that sometimes, especially when a submissive wasn't inclined to mate, his closest family or friends were dragged into the mess as blackmail material. Ron knew he had to be careful... especially when dealing with someone sent by Zabini and Malfoy, who Harry certainly wouldn't mate willingly.
"Still," Tassi insisted, "if the submissive had thought him an enemy, he'd have just been another corpse."
And who, by Morgaine's wrath, had had the splendid idea of bringing in McGonagall? Or the Minister? After all it wasn't as if the two of them held dark families in high esteem, not to mention families that had been strongly linked to the dark lord, had belonged to his innermost circle.
And he had no right to do any of those, after all he had done to Harry during their days at Hogwarts.
Yet hate and malicious rage and the unquenchable desire for revenge streamed from the darkly majestic beast in suffocating waves, soaking the very earth and air around it. There was hateful intelligence in the white of its glowing eyes and Taide couldn’t help but shudder and cringe under the force of all that ominous intent.
Immediately his order was implemented, the night swallowing their assembly once more. For a few moments there was nothing but endless blackness that extended in all directions as if nothing else existed but them and the softly blowing wind that rustled through the vine. It was deceptively peaceful. But even before his eyes had the chance to adapt to the pale star light, Blaise noticed a flickering bluish column of light in the distance like a will-o’-the-wisp, right there at the very top of the vineyard.
But nonetheless the thought made him nervous as he acutely felt his wand's absence in his hand - or his pocket for that matter. There were two crazed, armed Slytherins intending to mate with him in the garden he had just left and he had no means to really fight them off. Oh, he knew a little bit wandless magic but he still felt depleted where his magic was concerned and they would still be advantageous to him. Only willing his bloody wings away earlier had left him tired!
Well, that at least was an accusation that was easy to refute, with nothing more than an impartial witness and a bit of veritaserum; after all, he and Draco could honestly claim innocence in that regard... well, maybe the part about the deprivation of liberty was not completely unfounded but really, that was taking it out of context...
This was the critical moment of his plan, the one he didn't know if it would succeed. He needed to get a house elf to send the letter away or give him access to an owl. If it refused, then Malfoy and Zabini would learn of it before he had had the chance to fulfil his plan and the constrictions that had been put upon him would be reinforced and tightened around him until there was no chance of escape. Harry took a deep, steadying breath just as a small house elf appeared in the study with a quiet pop, bowing lowly to him.
Which she did, not even ten seconds later – the longest and most agonizing ten seconds in Blaise's life so far and he couldn't help slumping a bit, as his tensions transformed into sudden relief. Daphne was a powerful ally, her family was, and his spirits lifted with her at their side: they'd get Harry back to Britain and to safety and they'd smash his uncle for what he had done, ruin him until he was either in prison, or shunned by the public, or, if it couldn't be avoided: dead.
"Narcissa," Amalyne said urgently, and with a hint of anger in her usually so soft voice. But a moment later, her features softened and she pulled her friend's hands between hers, despite Narcissa's obvious reluctance to allow it.
Blaise raised one hand in a placating manner. "Don't feel obliged to do so, Harry. But if you have questions you don't feel comfortable asking us, Ives, being a submissive himself, would surely be able to help you."
He nodded curtly to Blaise to let him know that he had understood and taken the warning but as he tore away his gaze from the deadly poisonous talons, his attention was immediately drawn back to his own reflection, visible over the dark Italian's shoulder: from his temples, starting from beyond his hairline, several green lines, varying in their thickness and brightness, flowed over his brow, in swirls and curls along his forehead, eye-lids and cheek-bones, encompassing his wide green eyes like a Victorian filigree mask, never leaving the blurred band of ultraviolet around his eyes that in its brightness drew even more attention to the unusual mask.
His compassion, though, was limited. Frankly, he wasn't interested in the guilt question or in soothing his servants. Not now. Only the information about Harry that she might have was important.
It was to be a full moon that night; the 222nd full moon of Harry Potter’s life and although the young wizard didn’t know it yet, it would mean yet another pivotal turning point in his life.
They had argued over Draco and Blaise… and of course over Potter. The potions master had made no secret of how foolish he thought Lucius' plan to bind the submissive to their family in order to secure their standing and protect himself from prosecution.
That in itself didn't sound so bad at all but Harry really couldn't believe that Draco and Blaise would simply allow him to pursue whatever goal he wished to achieve. It was more likely that they would try to use him for their own interests.
“Giallina,” he addressed the Elf, his voice coming out more harshly than he intended it to, rougher, ”locate Harry!”
Not having anything else to look at, Harry turned to Blaise, who now regarded him once more earnestly and with an almost tender expression. "I am glad that you were able to transform completely. You already went a long way to overcome what you went through that night and I hope the memories won't trouble you further."
Blaise half expected them to fall, it all happened so fast, but before he could really start to fear for their lives, or do anything at all, his fingers started to tingle, becoming warm and warmer as magic pulsed beneath them, no streams, no sparkles, just one powerful entity living within each cell of the body he was holding onto, existing in Harry's mind and spirit if not his very soul. It
If he now thought about it, Harry couldn't really remember what had been so painful because at that moment he simply hadn't known what was happening to him, the pain had simply been there, refusing to be located or fought down, spreading down his back, along every muscle, every nerve. He never would have guessed that he had been growing bloody wings: only now Harry understood why the pain had appeared to originate from somewhere beyond his back but radiated into his torso in streams of liquid fire.
"Engorgio." He voiced, careful to speak clearly and pronounce the spell correctly and minding his wand movement. The mirror was quite valuable, no need to damage it with a poorly casted spell. Immediately the mirror started to grow until it covered the whole side of the room, reflecting the conference table, the ceiling fresco and in front of it all, Draco and Blaise.
Harry reminded himself fiercely, once again angry at his failure to stay objective. Well, he had never been
That Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini had kidnapped Harry could only mean that they intended to mate him. And there was nothing either Hermione or one of the Weasleys could do about it.
"Daphne." He greeted her calmly, watching as she walked towards the arm chair set up in front of the mirror and lowered herself onto it gracefully, her lean fingers curling into the open mouths of the lean, wooden vipers forming the arm rests. A formidable woman like queen Medb on her throne, tall and upright and strong.
Narcissa looked at him full of mistrust and betrayal, as if she had never seen him before, as if his image had just gained a new and darker dimension, a hidden abyss that she had never even believed possible to exist.
Harry tells his friends what happened so far and informs them of the letter. Hermione and Ron confirm that Harry basically has no rights concerning Vykélari courtship and mating. They read an article to him that was published that morning by Sonia Crane: through an interview with a Mediwizard it is described what happened in the hospital. A historian specializing on purebloods and Vykélari (Jennifer Palmer) describes what be happening to Harry now (forced to mate, share his magic, refer to his husbands in matters such as employment, in time birth a heir). The article criticizes the purebloods, the Malfoys (emphasizing their role in the war as Death Eaters) and social structures where there are ministry independent institutions mostly run by purebloods and demands that the ministry interferes.
… like before?" Harry asked hesitantly, just to make sure he hadn't misunderstood and he half expected the Italian to recoil at the idea, or maybe he hoped he would, but Blaise didn't. That black mamba only smiled at him, nodded again and finally relinquished his hold on Harry's arms to grasp his hands instead.
A shadow fell down onto the grass next to his feet and a moment later, Draco stood at his side and gave him an oddly serene smile that had Harry raise one eyebrow in questioning. The only answer he got, though, was a widening of that odd smile, then the blond turned away from him without further ado and let his wand fall into the open palm of his slender hand with a graceful twirl - that Harry might have been envious of had he found pleasure in such pretentiousness - and his wand arm moved in a complicated pattern, fast and sure as if he had done that specific spell million times before, an unintelligible murmur falling from his lips. Once Draco's smooth voice lapsed into silence, a small mirror appeared in front of Harry, gleaming in the light of the sun that still stood low behind them.
For whatever reason the guardia had found their way to his doorstep, he would have to try to placate them, even if that looked like a well-nigh impossible task, what with their grim expressions, the scornful tightening around their lips, the narrowed eyes and the drawn wands, their stances betraying their readiness to launch an attack at a moment's notice.
But there were many ifs and buts in that plan: what if the Elves willingly took the risk of hurting him? What if Zabini or Malfoy had ordered them to do whatever it took to keep him within Lanai Manor? As much as he wanted to escape at the moment, he didn't want to die. He wasn't that desperate yet.
"For now, I don't think that it will be a problem." Draco said thoughtfully. "He seemed to be agreeable to stay at least until he has learned how to control his magic. For once his saviour complex works in our favour: he doesn't want to endanger anyone. Until he has learned how to harness it, he will stay, so we might have two or three weeks."
But the few minutes of connectedness had taught him much about the two other teenagers, not least of all that they were not as cold and guarded and calculating as they purported to be. They were protective and supportive of each other and, oddly enough, of him. He had sensed in some way how angry Blaise had become over Snape, the odd sense of awareness that it concerned his former potions master and a sharp irritation had flashed through his mind like a blade of white hot fire and – he couldn't explain how or why – he had known that it was for his sake. And the gentle coaxing, the patient explanations… Draco's insecurity; no, all of this showed that they were far from being cold.
Finally, Adler spoke, his posture and expression unwavering. "You would really do it, wouldn't you."
Severus did not bother to try and catch the paper, knowing it was the letter he had written the two women earlier that morning. Didn't even allow his gaze to flicker towards it in case the move was meant as a distraction for an attack.
Wearily, Draco folded back the blankets and sat down, but his voice still held a hint of sharpness as he spoke, like the grinding of knives. "I know, Blaise."
"You look wonderful, the two of you. Italy becomes you well, it seems. Maybe I should visit sometime."
Nonetheless these kidnappers had intentionally chosen a plane as a bolthole. But why … why … a plane? Where were they taking them that a portkey couldn't so much faster and more efficiently? Not for a moment Harry believed this to be a coincidence or a simple convenience and not knowing the reason made his stomach clench uncomfortably but before he could figure out the motivations behind this seemingly unreasonable chess move, that soft Italian lilt that Harry started to hate from the bottom of his heart, resounded again in the wide living room.
"He can't hear you, Dragon." And then he curled his lips into that amused half-smile that Draco loved so much and damn, it, did he hate him sometimes.
"No worries..." Harry began, waving the apology away. But his words were distracted at best; there was something in the blonde's steely eyes as they, too, fell onto the article laying to Hermione's feet, something he couldn't quite name but didn't like either way. As if those silver grey orbs were lakes covered with ice and frost, hiding whatever lurked beneath.
”We will have to do the same with your vision. After that, your magic will close itself off and expand your magical core. For this purpose, it will exhaust itself. You will fall unconscious and suffer from magical exhaustion for a few days. That is absolutely normal. When you awake and your magic has replenished itself, you will be able to transform back into your human body. Got that?”
Next to him, Draco grasped his arm and Blaise faced away from the pitiful sight of his servant towards his fiancé. "Adler must have seen Harry leave through the magical windows in the room his portrait is in."
And by now Draco had learned that the only thing to be achieved by running was the turning of one's back to the danger. An unforgivable mistake with potentially fatal consequences.
Intently staring at his lover's tight expression, the dark eyes still turned towards him, pupils blown and full of fire, Draco raised his other hand and sucked two of his fingers into his mouth, teasingly swirling his tongue around the digits, coating them with his saliva. All the while Blaise watched him, lips parting in a silent moan of pleasure both from the show Draco put on for his sake and the unrelenting hand fisting his straining erection fervently.
The elf - Alfar - looked up for a moment, his eyes twinkling with the prospect of serving his master; but neither Blaise nor Draco noticed it for at that very moment emerald green light flared in the room. Potter had thrown the floo powder into the fire…
It was a deeply submissive gesture, one that Harry should be able to instinctively recognize and of course as such nothing that normally would be tolerated in a pureblood society. Instincts were meant to be controlled, not flaunted. As a matter of fact it was only because Vykélari traits were usually so subtle and inconspicuous, their instincts normally easy to contain and not noticeable at all, and because all transformations were purely magical and not physical and lasting like those of Veela, Vampires, Werewolves and other halfbloods, that made Vykélari so accepted in the wizarding world. That and the level of magical power and the fact that most pureblood families had at least a few Vykélari in their lineage.
His whole body tense, Harry obliged the Slytherin and looked back to where the blonde still stood, hip deep in the cerulean sea, frowning at Harry in confusion and irritation, one hand ruffling through his normally impeccable hair in obvious frustration. "What did I say now?"
Birds with far too intelligent eyes stalked slowly out of his way, staring at him, observing him with an intensity that made his skin crawl. They were slowing him down intentionally, Blaise realised, controlling his movements so that he wouldn’t be able to launch a surprise attack.
Draco grinned at the both of them, his pale eyes gleaming again with that half mischievous, half sardonic spark. "Yes, we will. But actually that idea with the portkey is quite ingenious. I'm sorry I didn't think of it earlier. You know, we could use it to go out a bit. We could glamour ourselves and actually leave the Manor..."
Still, that this had happened was Blaise's fault for pressing so resolutely towards this little experiment and he certainly would apologize to Draco once they were alone. For now, he was unsure how composed his fiancé really was after this unexpected experience and how much was acted and so Blaise was infinitely grateful that Harry seemed to be empathetic enough to know when to keep his silence.
Harry's emotions echoed this truth, Draco's own did and Blaise's most likely as well. It was cruel that he should only recognize it only now, and it tautened his whole being until he felt as if he was close to snapping.
Draco had refused, hadn't left his family and after a shouting match of epic dimensions (well, Draco had shouted at least, Blaise had glared and growled, that didn't mean it had been any less impressive) the Italian had decided that someone neutral couldn't be with a proclaimed follower of the Dark Lord. In an act of defiance and stubbornness Draco had started dating Pansy just to make his ex-lover jealous. And Blaise had ignored it. Because they were dickheads like that.
“As a matter of fact, I contacted you because of your position as representative of the Vykélari community in Britain…”
Therefore, Blaise stepped back from their submissive, searching forgiveness from his fiancé with nothing more than a quick glance, relieved that it was granted with a curt nod and a reassuring squeeze to his forearm.
The evening before. Harry stopped short in his movements to fold back his blanket: coming to think about it, how the hell had he ended up in his room? The last thing he could remember was listening to Blaise and -
For a moment he had wanted to ask further, but he actively fought his suspicion down. He didn't want to question their every behaviour. So what if they had been non-committal about the exact date at which they'd let Harry return home? They might have had their reasons. After all the start of the new term was still over one and a half months away and they might have thought that Harry would only be put off by such a long time span. Maybe they hadn't really noticed that it had just caused Harry to believe that they would never let him go.
"Oh." Harry said, feeling a little bit foolish. Of course the other submissive would be rather old, after all hadn't Draco and Blaise told him that the last submissive had lived and died all but two centuries ago? Yet he simply hadn't thought of it...
Abruptly his leg was wrenched down, causing Blaise to be ripped forwards and to the left so that he acted as a weighted pendulum. Already having been brought into a heavy rightwards tilt by their collision, the Gryffindor was whipped around and Blaise's weight, driven by Harry's incredible forward momentum, propelled him into a tumbling, lurching pirouette that made the two Vykélari tense and feint with dizziness.
It was what Narcissa privately called ‘her Arena’, the place where she could show just how gifted a social tactician she was. And indeed, mostly thanks to her the evening had so far been a full success: Narcissa was seemingly everywhere at once, steering conversations away from critical topics while ostensibly highlighting aspects of her guests that other’s would find interesting (which mostly meant profitable) enough to be polite, as well as ensuring that the more difficult personalities did not come into prolonged direct contact with each other. That, coupled with the fact that both families were highly influential in and of themselves, and very much interested in improving their own political and societal standing through each other, made the evening quite productive and enjoyable and both Blaise and Draco were very much relieved that their respective families seemed to get along just fine.
"You are not allowed a wand and you are not to go near the wards." He recited thoughtfully, his voice still a little bit tight: who did that Slytherin think he was, ordering him around like that?
Of course that wasn't everything there was to the story and Harry's nervousness and wariness, his vulnerability towards the influence of his own and Blaise's magic was like a menacing wraith hovering in the back of his mind, stinging his conscience. But it was a topic for later and easily pushed aside as Draco, with the grace of a dancer, or an experienced fighter perhaps, backed him against the corridor's wall, Blaise allowing himself to be lead.
"I'm not… I didn't…" Blaise fell silent when he realised how badly he was stuttering, how at a loss for anything to say he was. The genuine, passionate outrage that had literally exploded into his face had stunned him beyond reason.
"And he blatantly disregards any authoritative figure he comes across. And there are things that all of you dismissed too easily: Mr Potter will be inclined to flee Zabini Manor, merely because he is held captive there in the first place. He has some issues with such things. And he will try to flee
"Ah, here he is." Cowan laid his hand on the door handle, but he hesitated and didn't press it down; instead he looked back at the two young men with a nervous flicker to his eyes that had the two Slytherins pricking up their ears.
“Stop that, idiot!” he hissed as the former Gryffindor began to struggle, pulling with angry determination to free his wrists, putting his whole weight behind it now that he thought to know his enemies’ identity.
Upon the guarded nod and a hesitantly murmured "Yes", Blaise smiled, hiding most of his excitement, before he turned to his fair skinned lover with an air of mischief surrounding him. "Your turn."
Harry shrugged, looking towards the sea helplessly. "It was like a very strong, localized Cruciatus, you know? And I … I just … it took away my magic and my vision and everything else … and I just didn't know what was happening … I thought that maybe I was dead." He muttered at last, somewhat embarrassed.
From Severus' look Draco could tell that he thought the question to be foolish, and that he had expected better of his favourite student, but Draco didn't back down.
And Draco had to admit, that this was even better, seeing that strong jaw tense, those lips open in a silent scream as he pushed in with one quick thrust, gravity and Blaise's weight assisting him in the less than gentle invasion.
Not willing to follow that nauseating thought any further, he whipped his gaze away from the ground and to the endless horizon before him but that didn’t miraculously eradicate his objections.
Draco and Blaise both frowned at the former head of Slytherin house with irritation and, more importantly, confusion: when had they stopped taking pleasure in the derogatory things their former professor never failed to say about the Gryffindor Golden Boy?
"Is that even possible?" Draco asked and he glanced at the portraits behind his parents, seven of which were submissives themselves according to his father. But he couldn't for the life of him understand why someone would even want to reject such a gift, let alone try to actually do it. He was pretty sure they didn't know it either.
That ultimately allowed both him and Blaise to somehow draw back and reign in their emotions. It had come unexpected - all that chaos of each other's sensation - but after a few moments of being exposed to it, they were able to bethink themselves of all those lessons in concentration when performing difficult magic. First Blaise calmed, letting a deep silence permeate into the other two participants of their temporal bond, then Draco followed suit, emptying his thoughts like he had learned under Severus' tutelage in Occlumency. They still shared the awareness of their bodies, of all the strictly physical side of their selves but not their emotions.
Severus froze as he felt the wooden splinter in his pocket vibrate softly and he gripped the sponge more tightly so that several yellowish drops splashed onto Potter’s side.
Frowning, Severus straightened, unfurling from his position hunched over Potter’s still body. In no way was the Malfoy matriarch an opponent to be trifled with, not when she was clear-headed and certainly not when she was this upset. Narcissa might not be powerful enough to go up against him and win, but one well placed curse was enough to cause tremendous damage to him or his charge.
3. I don't intend any bashing. At all. Even though this chapter seems to contain some Weasley-bashing. But it is mostly written from our two Slytherins’ POV and therefore naturally somewhat derogatory in regards to the Weasleys. And if they seem too rash or too rude, then remember that they are worrying over Harry and tired as hell and very frustrated.
This time, Severus did sneer, though he didn't bother with useless swearing, instead holding his charge in place throughout his violent retching and shaking so that the vomit would not end up choking him, all the while wondering what the hell he was supposed to do if Potter was fighting off the magic that he might use to help him.
"I'm sorry he looks so out of place. Ives was most difficult and refused to cooperate." Draco said as he watched Harry.  "I will do something about it if you want."
But in any case, a defiant little voice in his mind piped up, they really had to stop manhandling him when he was fast asleep. That was just downright creepy.
Harry sighed. "And that is me?" he guessed, his stomach clenching tightly. He hadn't thought that Ginny would take this so badly. And it was with a guilty conscience that Harry realised that during the last few days and all his struggles he had never fought to be with Ginny again. He had been afraid of being a creature, of losing control over his life and his freedom and of endangering his friends and any future life partner he might chose for himself if he ignored his status as a Vykélari submissive. He was angry that this unwelcome inheritance was messing up his life, taking away his rights and making people expect him to submit himself to the next best dominant like a good, sweet submissive. He was angry that he wasn't seen as an equal any longer and that he couldn't go back to his friends – to which he counted Ginny. But he hadn't bemoaned the fact that he couldn't be with Ginny any longer. To hear now that his former girlfriend had obviously taken their nonexistent relationship (after all they hadn't gotten back together after the war) much more seriously, had given him so much more feelings and thoughts than he had returned made his stomach churn. It wasn't fair to her...
It started with the dive and how Draco and Blaise had been taken on such activities with their already fledged relatives long before they had gotten their own wings and somehow evolved into Harry telling them some of the minor adventures he had experienced in his early years at Hogwarts, especially those that the Slytherins had played some role in. It soon became rather grotesque because their perceptions of certain events differed so much sometimes Harry had to wonder whether they had lived through different realities that had somehow been merged into one now.
For a moment, Draco was silent, nodding to himself with a tiny smile as if he was thinking of something particularly entertaining, before ending with a nonchalant shrug and a jested "well, at least we won't be bored. But, you know, I would rather stabilize the ministry first and then give it more power rather than giving it all the power and then hoping it will rule fairly, wouldn't you?"
All those years Potter had simply been too similar to his father to feel any different about him. Even now after all the times he had protected him, after all the times he had seen the boy suffer, separating the one Potter from the other didn’t come easily.
"Narcissa…" She said hesitantly, speaking slowly with carefully chosen words, "it might be better if you stayed here and secured Potter for Blaise and Draco. Let me deal with my late husband's family and the guardia."
Harry clenched his jaw so hard it hurt, swallowing the harsh words and curses and threats waiting impatiently at the tip of his tongue.
"Always turn into the headwind!" he said, the huge appendages flapping almost lazily, the muscles flexing with well-practiced ease as he prepared to take off. The fabric of the shirt he still wore and which he had magically cut two slits into to make room for the two new limbs, stretched with every movement, every steady beat of is wings.
For now though, the exact strength for the lightening charm caused Harry enough problems: if he became too light, he had not enough to counter the wind with, and once he started the sudden gust that was supposed to let him reach sufficient "lift", as Draco and Blaise called it, he was simply blown backwards (and Draco really had to catch him the one time or the other); but if his charm was too weak, he was too heavy to get off the ground.
But Amalyne was still the mother that had raised him and had been a major influence throughout his youth and neither Blaise nor his father's relatives would ever forget that little fact.
In a placating gesture, Draco raised his hands, his voice strained as he tried to not let his father see how much that sentence had hurt. "Give me a few days of time, I will do my utmost to keep you out of prison, I swear."
to think about what would have happened to the foolish boy. There were many fireplaces in Italy that one would not want to stumble out of, especially one as naïve and inexperienced as Potter, one who didn't know anything about the local wizarding communities, not to mention the fucking language! One who didn't know how easy it was to make a body vanish silently and without a trace.
"But you said that the special laws of Vykélari were why you brought me here and why … why it was legal that you did. So, since that has nothing to do with mating… it hasn't, has it?"
“I will continue right where I left off, and assist Lucius during the trials.” He tried to reassure her. ”Even if he must go to prison, it won’t be for long and it won’t be like the last time. Narcissa, there are no more dementors to guard the prisoners. He will not suffer like that again. His mind, his sanity won’t suffer. Besides,” he added after a short pause, ”that is something you can ask of Potter as recompense for the life debt: making sure that Lucius isn't subjected to unnecessary cruelty.”
No one would believe them if they said that the submissive had enjoyed their date, had kissed them passionately and of his own free will only half an hour before undertaking a reckless attempt to flee; not when they were the accused. After all he had even shown himself willing to hurt Draco and Blaise.
He pressed forward to deepen their kiss and was greeted by sweetness and the sharp tang of wine coupled with a million other more subtle flavours.
It was a ruse, Harry thought, because someone with such piercing eyes should know that he needed no arms or hands to trap his prey. The brunet couldn’t have looked away if his life depended on it, feeling like the trembling little finch staring at the hawk tumbling through the canopy.
"I guess you noticed that your wings are smaller and sharper tipped than when you first transformed?" Blaise asked and Harry nodded immediately, even though he had only seen his wings once from up close, cocooning him and only for some short minutes, yet the difference was palpable. Literally.
"You should better suppress your misgivings, Harry, or we won't be finished in time." They warned coolly. "You have to wish the bond into existence!"
Narcissa inclined her head in acknowledgement at her son's reminder, but it was Lucius who answered, now calmer once again, sure of the support of his wife and Amalyne and reassured by their confidence in their little plan. "The situation has changed."
Later, Harry would remember the blonde Slytherin Prince proclaiming their supposedly certain victory with a soft laugh, because in the end they didn't win. Not that Harry had been overly surprised.
"We need wands, Blaise. Call whomever you trust and use whatever you need. You know the contents of my vault. Use it all if necessary."
Daphne snarled, her chin raised aggressively, and her hand cut through the air to encompass all their alleged idiocy and depravity. "I still gave you the benefit of a doubt and made sure to verify all the facts. The guardia sent that letter to the Aurors to confirm the magical signatures. There is no doubt about it: Potter wrote it, his magical signature is all over the paper, which bears the heraldic animal of
Harry felt his heart skip a beat, the well-known anticipation of facing off with an enemy pooling in his stomach and laying itself like an armour around him. Careful to not loosen his hold on Taide, or show those fiends any weakness, Harry turned to look over his shoulder, his gaze searching the lean, hawk-faced man who stepped forth from behind the looming shadow of the two-way mirror. Valerio Lanai, tall and upright with pride and malice and confidence even now; and worst of all: unscathed, his clothes still tidy and pristine. Of course the sneaky bastard had hidden away safely while Harry was smashing everything and everyone else.
Not bothering to check his appearance in the large mirror at one side of the bedroom, Harry pushed the curtain to the living area aside and crossed the room swiftly, not even appreciating for a moment the wonderful view of the wide windows, or the warm décor and the furnishings that looked as chic as they seemed comfortable. Not even the fireplace that only held illusionary fire anyway and didn't even possess a floo. He strode right up to the pair of doors on the other side, from which one lead to the bathroom and the other - as Zabini had explained in an embedded sentence - to a study.
"Well, yes. Obviously this was much more intense than a mere temporary magical connection. It should only have allowed you to feel a vague echo of sensations and let you share only those that you concentrated explicitly on to begin with. Maybe it was because of the life debts between you… or the rather … intense relationship you had even before the war."
It wasn't the best plan one might come up with, Harry knew that, of course he knew it, but he had never been a brilliant strategist. That was Ron's metier. No, if there was one thing Harry was good at, it was thinking on his feet, improvising, and it was that ability he would have to rely on…
How proud the Malfoy patriarch had been when telling him and Draco of the artefact’s powers, how weapons like this had been forged by mated Vykélari pairs and used to target the strongest link of another mating.
No, he was completely and utterly at the mercy of Draco bloody Malfoy and that skunk Blaise Zabini (who, after his pretentious performance a few minutes ago, was definitely on his hit list), which just strengthened his resolve: he needed to get out of this manor and away from them before they decided to … to what exactly?
Severus bowed his head in thanks, accepting the compliment for what it was. Really, he did like that portrait.
Blaise halted for a moment, realising the lie that had almost effortlessly rolled off his lips just in time. He had sworn to do right by Harry, and telling the truth about what had happened just a few days ago was just as much a part of that vow, as saving and protecting Harry was at this moment. Moreover he didn't want to lie about their relationship with the Gryffindor; besides, Daphne wouldn't have believed it anyway.
"No!" he shouted back, grinning like a madman, and he wasn't sure if it was the magic intoxicating him or the flying. The wind rushed through his hair, letting the brilliant green feathers flutter violently, it whipped over his face, making his eyes tear up, it flowed over his wings, through the feathers, bending them, curving them. And his magic
"But we won't." Malfoy said insistently. "That should tell you something, Weasley. Instead, in answer to your promise, I in turn vow that I will not force Harry to mate. I can't promise to never go against his wishes or force him to do something he might not like, because sometimes certain situations might force our hands, especially with someone as eager to endanger himself as Harry is. But I promise to try and do right by him to the best of my ability."
And they did. His bones moved oddly against each other, not at all painfully, just in a weird, grating way that was neither pleasant nor really uncomfortable.
But as he glanced at his surroundings once more, taking in the elegant, finely lathed furnishings of dark wood and flowing sand-coloured fabric, he had to admit that Malfoy was right: these were not the rooms of a prisoner.
"The stability of Harry's magic and life will depend on the continued existence of whoever it is." The blonde elaborated, once again looking to that very spot where the guardia and Blaise's uncle had emerged from the darkness, where they had waited to spring their trap.
For a short, horrifying moment Blaise already saw himself plunge to the ground and he heard his lover scream his name in terror and the flash of a levitation charm darted past him without finding its goal. It was only by pure luck that Blaise managed to grasp one of Harry's ankles as his hand swept past the other's legs and instinctively grabbed a hold of him in the last moment and it felt as if his shoulder was being dislocated from the sudden jerk, but he held on tightly nonetheless, ripping at the other's leg and pulling him down with his weight. One of the light shoes fell from the foot he was holding unto, tumbling to the ground with a clearly audible thud like a cruel reminder of what would await the Italian, should he lose his grip.
"I mean since the not-quite-real professor Moody said I'd be a good Auror, I wanted to become just that and I picked my courses just to be able to follow that path. But I'm not so sure anymore. And I'm not so sure if he was right. He was a mad imposter after all and wanted to get me killed." He attempted a weak smile but neither Blaise nor Draco returned it.
Harry's magic erupted out of him, finally escaping his control or, more accurately his control vanishing in the face of the torture of his best friend. It raised and whirled around him, whipping about and cutting through the air in the search for his enemy, beating against the mirror in a useless attempt to get through.
His gaze flitted over the ruins as his mind razed, as if the solution was hidden somewhere in the debris – perhaps something to distract them…
When it was rumoured that the attractive Italian had taken the Malfoy heir to one of his family’s estates in Italy immediately after the trial, obviously having correctly anticipated the results, most of their pureblood relatives and friends were therefore rightfully surprised; more so when Narcissa Malfoy began – just the following day – to extend invitations for her son’s engagement party, to be held in Malfoy Manor.
Immediately Harry slowed a bit and looked down. He was surprised to see the sea roll in waves towards the shore directly beneath them. They glittered in the sunlight like a carpet of gems and crystal. It looked so surreal from this height.
"See?" Blaise asked while he and Draco performed a few turns with the younger man trapped in their hold between them and if his eyes hadn’t outright laughed at Harry, he would have thought that the Italian snake was completely serious with that smug, self-satisfied smirk playing around his lips. "We can dance
Taide called his wings back into his body and jumped up, rushing towards the submissive without a thought, and he honestly didn’t know what he’d do when he reached the boy, he just wished to stop the carnage about to take place. This were his brother-in-law and sister! The brilliantly witty older sister that had always been as much of a nagging nuisance as a reassuring, supportive constant in his life.
A persistent feeling of elation still pulsed through Harry's body like the echo of an electric shock, defying the sudden sense of loss and loneliness and the deep-routing confusion that followed the break of their connection.
At his sides, Harry's hands clenched into tight fists to keep them from trembling. The last time he had gone against this man so openly, Ron had been tortured into a mess of twitching muscles, agony and fear, and the utter helplessness of the experience still lurked darkly at the edges of Harry's consciousness, made him torn between the burning desire to attack that madman, and the need to beg him not to hurt his friends any further, to offer him anything in return.
Draco on the other hand had darkened his hair to a dark gold and looked as if he had spent a few hours in the sun for a change. The slight tan looked good on him but not like Draco anymore and Harry found himself missing the platinum blonde and almost translucent skin.
Nonetheless, Draco determinedly forced the images from his mind and told himself to focus: none of this would or could ever happen, if he didn't find a way to set some boundaries to the mating bond. He couldn't be emotionally and mentally naked in front of Harry, he just couldn't.
The desk stood parallel to the windows, a light table with no ornaments whatsoever. The dark table top was firmly joined with the wall unit at the side of the room and was empty aside from the silver sculpture of a Pegasus and a crystalline ink well and a white quill. It didn't even have any drawers. Harry frowned and walked round it, seating himself into the pale office chair, on which cushioning charms had been casted so skilfully that one had the impression of sinking into clouds.
"Many Slytherins fought on his side during the last stand at Hogwarts, Blaise! If they had known him for years, befriended him… they would have fought with him from much earlier on! It's unfair to judge them like this. It is unfair to judge
"And the Weasley's?" Harry asked, knowing that they must have been the ones to bring him to the wizard hospital. He couldn't for one moment believe that they had just allowed the two Slytherins to just levitate him out like a trunk.
Then he turned, his eyes ominously flying from one House Elf to the other until he found the one little female he was searching. The poor thing cringed as she found herself the sole recipient of her master's dark stare, even if the fury within wasn't directed at her.
Taking a deep breath, Harry threw one short glance at the two Slytherins behind him, to see if they were as apprehensive as he was, but either they weren't or they were better at hiding it. Most likely it was a bit of both. Harry himself felt just more apprehensive now that his worries were breaking through the elation he had felt during their connection, causing it to dissipate like a construct of mist in a sudden breeze and he was slowly beginning to remember his own transformation, the nightmarish hours he had lived through and that were so hard to banish from his memory.
He really couldn't believe the two dominants and Ives didn't at least exaggerate when they talked about what other Vykélari dominants would and could do; well that was a question he could ask Hermione the following day…
Ron had observed all of this with no little amount of surprise. He had only meant to intimidate the two Slytherins somewhat, to make sure they would think twice before mistreating his friend. He had never expected them to be so reasonable let alone so accommodating. Of course, Ron would still be wary - who wouldn't after everything that had happened only two months ago, especially since the promise they had made still granted them a lot of leeway - but at least it was
“And what is your excuse?” She asked him with a chilling voice, bearing accusations like ice crystals in a blizzard.
They shot off into opposite directions as the Slytherins started to pull out of the dive, Blaise with Harry towards the mountains, Draco towards the sea.
“I don't think so, no. He claims that the Dark Lord black-mailed him with threats on his family. The same goes for the younger Malfoy, who has already been acquitted, as you well know.” With that, he glanced up from his dinner towards Harry briefly, his expression carefully blank, before he looked down again.
Agitated, Nascimbeni whirled around as soon as he heard the subtle click of the door closing, and snapped at Comissario Mancini.
Draco gulped and blinked, too much taken aback to do anything but stare at the seething Gryffindor in front of him, watching the way his fists clenched and unclenched in rapid succession at his side. The way the tendons in his throat became visible as he tensed his jaw and how the green eyes seemed so intent on burning him alive. It was painfully obvious that Harry was about to bolt again, not because of fear or insecurity but because of hot, bitter rancour and rage.
Malfoy wore jet-black trousers and a dark blue-grey, tapered vest above a white, simple but elegant shirt. It might have been silk or something else, Harry really couldn't tell; it looked as if Harry would have found the price too ridiculous to pay for a bit of clothing, though. Not that it didn't look stunning on Malfoy's pale, lean muscled form, it really did: tall and proud he projected an aura of confidence and deadly grace like – like someone you really didn't want to mess with.
From their long years of enmity in which they had always watched each other to the point of obsession, Draco knew that the Gryffindor was close to losing it. And at the same moment he realised that while he had the intimate knowledge of what words would be needed to make Harry start to shout and rant and fight his bonds, of how to arouse his fierce anger, he was completely at a loss as to how to
Draco narrowed his own eyes, but he didn't answer. He had heard worse insults during the war and had needed to learn how to deal with them without reverting to violence and insult. Blaise was more reluctant to let it go, it seemed.
"I didn't follow him. I never did. I tried to keep him alive, because he was Lilly's; but that is all I owed her. I only switched sides to begin with because I was trying to keep her safe and once I had done that, I couldn't go back, I was already a traitor to the Dark Lord's cause."
Not that Narcissa seemed to register anything beyond Severus' face through the red haze filling her vision. He could see her lips trembling with each hissing breath she drew, the fingers of both hands clenching around the handles of her basket and wand. Accusations twisted like ball lightning behind the pale blue of her eyes, all those sharp curses that she wished to hit him with. But for some reason she held the words back, merely sharpening them uselessly against her grinding teeth.
With a last exertion of force, Draco shot upwards, and the burning buildings finally revealed the former cloister garden in their middle, laying open the entire extent of destruction wreaked upon them. Smoke enveloped him like a smothering cloak, smelling of fire and death and pain and it had him retching and coughing until a bubble-charm like mask covered his nose and mouth mercifully.
Moments thereafter Blaise saw out of the corner of his immobilized eyes, how the heavily blurred silhouettes of his servants surrounded him protectively, could sense the soft vibrations of their own innate magic pulsing around him and yet he couldn't feel relieved, desperation swelling in his throat accompanied by the taste of bile, so thickly he could barely swallow past it. What was happening to Harry? To Draco?
But he needn't have bothered: the attempt at appearing harmless was rendered useless with his markings still blazing a furious warning signal to anyone insane enough to approach him.
Something about the portrait stroke Harry as odd, something was definitely wrong with him… the way he had looked at Harry after that tiny something had flown into his eye reminded him far too much of a hunter smiling down at a deer caught in a trap: full of dark satisfaction. And Ives being so angry suddenly did nothing to soothe his suspicions.
By Morgaine. This article was not mainly about Harry Potter, even if it tried its best to make it seem so. It was the declaration of a cold war at which end stood a ministry controlling every aspect of their life, leaving single families and individuals little possibilities to significantly influence political events. Crane used Harry Potter, the war hero as an iconic figure, the martyr kindling the people's fighting spirit to try and disempower the gentry that had ruled for centuries. And she was damned successful at that.
Suddenly he found himself able to breathe again, thick, sharp air streaming through his too quickly expanding lungs only to be forced out a moment later, but it was a start. This would keep him function, allow his mind and his body to fall into the deceptive calm he had used when fighting against
They made their way to the top of the tower in heavy silence, heading directly for the single small spot of the platform that was clear of plants. The lush fragrance of Damask Roses greeted them as they drew closer, cloyingly sweet like honey, and thin twigs reached for their bodies like horrible grasping hands, sharp thorns already dripping with sizzling poison in anticipation of a rich meal.
"...these creatures" he finally hissed, more quiet as if the word itself was poisonous and had to be handled with care.
This specific mirror was connected to Draco's home and currently showed a room in Malfoy Manor and with it, a peculiar foursome already waiting for the engaged couple: right in the front, on an arm chair each sat Lucius, Narcissa, Amalyne and, surprisingly enough, Severus. The wall behind them was covered in portraits of, as Draco noticed with a surprised frown, some of his ancestors, all of whom looked at them with an air of dignity and solemnity worth of any Malfoy. It was in all honesty not the sight that Blaise and Draco had expected to see: they had agreed with their parents to meet in the mornings of every second day and keep them informed about the newly fledged Vykélari. They had not expected for Draco's godfather to be there also and neither for all of the portraits. Draco knew very well that those used to hang in the family gallery and so his father or his mother seemed to have deliberately decided for them to join their conversation; for what reason, he couldn't tell.
"You could always transform your eyes back." Blaise spoke up, his black eyes seeming to stare right into Harry. "Not right now after you exhausted yourself like that, but tomorrow morning. You wouldn't need the glasses then."
Harry felt his throat tighten and his hands spasm helplessly at his side, whether to ball into fists, or twitch with the desire to throttle or snap something, or to wring in agitation, Harry was not sure.
"Just like anything else, with will." Draco answered and then went to show Harry the exact wing shape to adapt. Only moments later, the green feathers shifted and grew along with the complete structure of his green wings until Harry stood there with the wings of an eagle raised high above his head.
Taide grew even stiller beneath him, swallowing drily. There was a certainty in the harsh lines of his angular face, in the cold agate of his eyes and Harry absently wondered what it was, even while he let his expression draw into a grimace of hate and anger and he called out again. "VALERIO!"
Maybe the notion of what Blaise and he could want from Harry was finally settling in after all. Though privately, Draco hoped that this wasn't the reason for his nervousness. After all he didn't want the prospect to frighten the young submissive.
Once more he submerged below the water's surface, his hands moving to keep him down. Immediately the water pressed against his ears, filling them with the sound of his own rushing blood, the sound of the water currents moving, the small waves hitting the edge of the pool. He heard Draco's left leg moving in a slow, small circle, disturbing the water's flow, the sound exaggerating the movement because he was so close and because there was barely anything else to hear.
Though now it was the first time that Harry experienced the flood of words without eavesdropping (that time in the Slytherin common room totally counted as eavesdropping, besides they had been only twelve then) or happening upon the blonde and his goons totally by chance and it was astoundingly comfortable to just listen to all the background information to their activities today, mixed with random thoughts and anecdotes and Harry kept on sneaking amused glances towards Blaise who just smiled and winked back, his own silent version of a fond 'he does that' – the words Draco had used that day at the sea when his fiancé had gone ahead and directly flown into the waves without waiting for them.
At that moment a scream ripped through the air, barely perceivable over the ruckus of Harry’s birds, but it made the blood freeze in Draco’s veins.
"You promised to give us  an honest chance." Draco said, lowly, careful that no hint of an accusation tinted his voice; which almost drew a smirk on Blaise's face: sometimes Draco seemed to confuse the Gryffindor with a full-grown Hippogryph that he needed to placate lest he be trampled and hacked to death.
Oddly, his voice didn't match the enraged expression on his handsome face and the feathers in his hair had flattened against his skull, for the first time taming the chaotic black strands into an almost orderly something that one could call a decent hairstyle.
Blaise frowned. That meant that the blackmailers had to have taken Harry's friends only a few short hours before contacting the submissive…
"Harry, what is in that letter?" Ron asked suddenly, his voice calm and demanding, wondering if this might bring him closer to learn if and why Harry might have wanted to ignore what was happening to him.
In many ways it was a rushed, ill-planned rescue mission that the residents of Lanai Manor made to set out on, but there was not much more they could have done: as it was, their only means of transportation beyond the incredibly fast but still too slow brooms were the horde of loyal House Elves, which were also their only weapons of sort. Their lack of wands hopefully wouldn't matter much though, because the moment they apparated into the nightmarish chaos raging at the old country estate of Blaise's family, the guardia would be notified and soon a squad would arrive to drag the fugitives back, armed, well-trained and experienced. But upon witnessing what was actually happening there, they would have no choice but to interfere and assist them. They had to! And to hell with the consequences of transgressing the terms of their house arrest!
"But that is what I mean!" Harry exclaimed, "I don't want to defend the laws of a society where vigilantism is so common that it isn't even punished! Or where it is possible for a single family to play puppet master for the minister…" He said, with a nasty glance at Draco, leaving no doubt as to which family he meant. "… a man so powerful that he can singlehandedly decide over the fate of any wizard without anyone to stop him, without any legal means to defend oneself. Like … like throwing people into Azkaban without trial, or pardoning anyone just because he feels like it!"
Besides, if he had understood it correctly, they were not even legally allowed to protect him from other dominants. So the only thing he would achieve was endangering them with his own wonky magic and forcing them to infringe several laws out of loyalty.
Frustrated with himself, Harry wiped heavy strands of unruly, black hair out of his eyes. "Just stay away until we have our fucking magic under control, Blaise, I mean it!"
"Yes you are!" Blaise said fiercely, moving down from his chair to kneel at Harry's side, forcing the brunet to look at him by grasping his chin between his strong fingers. "I can feel it even now! You have no idea of the effect of your marks! Like an aphrodisiac they are, calling out to a dominant to come and woo you, to court you: a strong and fertile submissive!"
When Harry didn't answer, Ives continued nonetheless, his voice urgent. "Because Blaise and Draco said they would never force you, that they would never mate you if it was against your will."
Had Harry not been so upset and unsettled, had his magic not clouded his mind with anger and the almost unbearable urge to attack, he might have noticed how Valerio's attention shifted for a short moment to a spot behind Harry, exchanging a meaningful glance with someone there, how the man gripped his wand tighter and subtly changed his stance as if readying himself for an attack.
Harry held his breath for the cruel length of the second it took Valerio to answer, surprise and anxiety warring for dominance in his chest.
He settled for glaring at Blaise instead, who was obviously fighting not to laugh, the strain of the effort making his lips twitch (he didn't want to look at Draco right then, as he barely covered his chuckles with suspicious coughing), while he concentrated on human words again. Moments later, Harry transformed his syrinx back into his human voice box, only barely feeling the slight shift in his throat.
No, he was certain that Lily would never know of his treatment of her child, never see… and thus it should be of no consequence whether Severus liked her son or not, whether he was fair to him or taught him to deal with all the cruelty of the world instead. The boy himself probably didn't care much either way and he was still an annoying, thoughtless brat. Rash to act and slow to learn.
Blaise had Alfar apparate him directly onto the porch on the front side of the manor where the sudden darkness enfolded him like a cool velvet cloak and for a moment, the only thing he could say for sure was that Harry, and also Draco, were nowhere on the torch-lit driveway. His heartbeat set out for one excruciatingly long second only to return with a vengeance while his eyes swept restlessly over the neat park, searching frantically for any movement that might betray his lover's or their submissive's whereabouts but coming up dauntingly blank. Had they already come too late?
Outwardly indifferent Severus stared down at Potter's still form, watching the boy hovering four feet above the ground of Damask Tower's Apparition Room where the emergency portkey had deposited him. Still and unmoving he looked like a corpse laid out for the world to bemoan, frozen in time, sickly pale and drenched in blood as he was.
At least none of them were Gryffindors and could lie in wait for Harry in his dorm or common room where neither Blaise nor Draco could protect him.
Or should Severus blame himself and everyone who had added to Potter's torment because they had felt entitled and justified and simply because they could?
“Sshh.” One of them said and fingers stroked through his hair again. Then everything went black for the second time that night.
Recovering his poise almost immediately, Severus bowed lowly, a moment longer than politeness would have demanded of him, but really, he needed the additional moment to mask the amused smirk threatening to spread over his face. Was this Narcissa's way of telling him not to prank his husband anymore?
Once more, Draco's and Blaise's eyes met worriedly after only one glance at the newspaper. This was quickly becoming worse and worse.
One beat of its powerful wings, and the downs on the underside ignited themselves, white and blue flames licking at the gleaming feathers without burning them. It flew as if carried by the fire, a herald of destruction and death.
The way the brunet took a deep breath told Lucius that this was going to be a long monologue full of evasions and unsatisfactory excuses. He almost sighed at the prospect.
! Does that matter, though? He'll still be a submissive in the hands of two dominants. And you really should hurry... shouldn't he have his magic back by now? You know he'll become dangerous then and so much more difficult to control. You have blocked it, haven't you?"
He really should be going, Harry thought idly. He should go on with his plan and search the floo powder that must be somewhere close and flee. But he hesitated for a moment, curiosity getting the better of him - though curiosity about what, Harry really couldn't tell; maybe it was just some kind of sick fascination.
In any case, that was only of minor importance right now, paling in the face of Daphne's scepticism.
He really needed to talk to Adler. Perhaps there was a way of avoiding such a blend of selves between the three of them without having to give up the entire bond. For now, though, there was a submissive to entertain. A too perceptive submissive, who, Draco feared, might balk if he thought them to be indecisive or insincere.
The upwelling blood she smeared onto the curled tongue of the snarling statue, and in the darkness didn't see the similar stain further down its throat.
"Touch yourself!" He demanded, ordered, and though his lover's eyes burnt with indignation at his tone of voice, lust and desire and the intense, burning need to come outbalanced everything else. A hand wormed itself between their bodies and started to move up and down the hard length of Blaise's erection quickly, almost desperately. It didn't take long and Draco felt the strong muscle's around him spasm and tighten, so much it almost bordered on painful and his lover's body trembled and arched helplessly as his come splashed on both of their shirts.
But Blaise wanted Draco to experience what he himself had during Harry's transformation. That uncomfortable feeling of nakedness in the face of pure power, almost like a violation of your magical core, so intimate. But heady and intoxicating in the sense of closeness to someone who was just as helpless to defy that connection; the knowledge that it could also go both ways. For the first time in his life there had neither been a need nor a possibility of hiding.
It was odd, really, that those two Slytherins of all people had been the ones to look at him as if he was beautiful and desirable. Harry had never exactly been the target of someone's desire; he wasn't handsome, not like Cedric had been, not like Zabini and Malfoy were.
Both of his friends immediately understood how dangerous the letter could prove to be and promised to notify Harry at once when it reached them. Hermione especially was rather upset that "you didn't think about it being possibly intercepted, did you?! God, Harry, don't you remember how careful we had to be with the owl post both with Sirius and during the war?"
Calmly Hermione raised her flat hands in a pacifying manner. "Harry, all I want is that you are aware of the problem and that you think honestly on whether or not it is right what you are feeling towards them, whatever that is."
Harry couldn't turn to Ginny either, he had tried so hard to keep her away from dangers and problems that were
Draco wondered, frowning and wishing that he knew more about him, while Blaise went on with his explanation.
Absentmindedly Harry's fingers ghosted over the artfully painted wall - a mixture of different warm shades of terracotta, oranges and gold that had been applied with a palette knife to form an intriguing play of colours and textures - while thinking over his possible lines of action.
Blaise didn't care nor pay attention to it. He pointed towards the wide windows of his study where Potter was just opening his box with floo powder. "Stop Potter!" He ordered, his voice like steel, hard and cold.
Draco gave him a small smile, meaning it to be reassuring. "I am sorry." He murmured, the teasing quality to his voice implying that his apology didn't have to be taken for one, if Harry didn't want to…
"If you hurt them, I'll drive my claws into his throat," he snarled, "see how potent that poison really is. And I'd still have all of you as hostages."
, or the deal with Ives was off. He was not changing himself, not for just anyone and never if he didn't think it justified.
Shrugging once to dislodge the apprehension that had overcome him, Harry gave the blond a curt nod, turning his gaze, though not his full attention, towards his own reflection in the mirror.
"But not you." Blaise said and Harry felt a sharp pang of regret pulsing through the temporary bond before Blaise broke away, his wings shrinking back into his shoulders. Harry watched him warily, unsure if he should feel relieved or not that they were two strictly separate beings once more. It had been a confusing experience and intense, even if not as intense as it had been the first time; but it had also been … rather illuminating.
But the Gryffindor was having none of it, he just wanted to get a safe distance away from the mind control he had just experienced. And god, all that after he had honestly tried giving them a chance at Ives' request as best as he could; and now they threw his trust into the dirt and stomped right over it. He felt betrayed. God, but he should have known that something like this would happen. Conniving, lying, scheming Slytherin bastards.
"Anyway, what are you doing here?" He asked, trying to look around the Italian's broad chest - now that Harry knew how much the other teenager loved swimming, that physique really came as no surprise anymore.
But so far, Adler had proven to be surprisingly helpful and had not really ridiculed him once. He had been relatively forthcoming with information, at least when asked directly, and though Draco secretly thought that the elder Malfoy had incited them to rush into establishing the temporary bond, it had been their own (or rather Blaise's) decision in the end. And he needed those information…
"Weasley." She waited for a moment, and then continued as it became apparent that the red-haired man wouldn't take the initiative, a small tightening of her lips the only indication of her irritation. "Won't you ask me to come in?"
He had not known that the connection would be so intense. It had certainly not been like this in the hospital when it had only been him and the submissive and he could only speculate as to why that was. Maybe it was the fact that Harry's subconsciously steered magic had been much more controlled than the chaos the three of them had fabricated; maybe it was for the simple reason that there were three of them now where there had only been two, or it was because they had consciously witnessed the sensations and emotions of each other when before that, Harry's magic had surveyed Blaise's body without reporting anything back to its owner.
This experience wouldn't prove to be much better. After the colours and lights gave way to the warm glow of numerous candles, before he even had the chance to regain his composure and balance and sense of direction, a feeling of deep-rooting anxiety swept over his skin, cold and sticky but streaked with the thinnest, strongest threads of pure magic. Like a spider web it clung to his body, following each motion. They were wards, his mind provided a moment after the sensation registered, wards that had snapped into place as soon as they had arrived to keep Harry from disapparating and probably from doing a number of other things as well. Now they solidified around him, closing in on him, and he could feel their hold, their power as they pressed down on his body and magic as if they wanted to suffocate him.
"Harry, it would be better if we dropped the subject…" Blaise tried again with as much diplomacy as he was able to, praying the other would listen to the tightness in his voice, but the brunet was having none of it.
Nodding slowly, Draco tried to steer his thoughts away from the looming conflict between his father and his submissive, which was harder than it should be. "Well, Harry…"
Then it had gone downhill from there: The Weasley men had gone berserk, Ginny and Molly had wept and ranted and Hermione had remembered.
He closed his eyes as blessedly cool fingers soothed the heated skin on his forehead, brushing away his unruly fringe. That felt nice.
His face easing into a gentle smile Blaise leaned forward to brush a lock of black silk out of the Gryffindor's eyes, the affectionate expression in the dark eyes causing a tinge of red to colour Harry's cheeks. "You should learn both, Harry. But if you don't want to, why don't you join us on a broom? I have some of the best models here."
There were no warm winds to lift them, no thermals to soar on. Instead, a strong crosswind pressed against their side and the strain of the flight was burning through Blaise’s and Draco’s wing muscles like acid. Perforce they flew close to the ground, Draco quite a bit ahead, following the endless rows of vine towards the beacon that Harry had lit. A beacon that more and more took the form of a madly whirling flock of firebirds, beautiful and terrible to look at as their fiery tails and feathers fused almost seamlessly into that bright column of light that they had seen from afar.
A moment later though, Blaise felt a memory wash away his heady, magic-drunken elation like a tide of ice water. Bewitched. It was something he had heard before from a portray or maybe he had read about it in some tome of his own father, whom he had never known. Something the Malfoy portraits had even hinted at the first time they had spoken with them about Harry and about possible methods to make him stay at the manor: because submissives were magically stronger, because for a dominant to approach one who was well-rested with the intention of mating him was indeed very dangerous in and on itself, nature had gone out of its way to give a trump card to the magically weaker. While all Vykélari were naturally fascinated by magic - there was no denying that - an inexperienced submissive could literally be caught in a trance like state merely by being exposed to well-controlled, powerful magic. Of course he could overcome that addiction if he encountered it often enough in his life, just like a drug that one developed a resistance against. But Harry had never gotten in touch with anything remotely related to Vykélari before and so he was open and vulnerable to the not so subtle influence, more so than any other submissive who was raised amongst other Vykélari. And Blaise's magic had reacted by itself, enfolding Harry so that he would not leave, so that Blaise could reach out, close the submissive's core off, block his magic and thus make him helpless until they mated. And all that before Harry had the chance to react, too entranced with the display of magic.
