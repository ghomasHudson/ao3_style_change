“have you thought any about possible wedding dates?” draco asked lightly. it had been on his mind over the last few weeks and now seemed like the best time to ask. he knew that they had agreed to wait, but the idea of planning his dream wedding alongside harry excited him, even if it was almost a year early.
“dudley,” draco tuts quietly, walking over to him. “hello there.”
the cottage had been an abstract concept up until last year - a pipe dream that had come about a few years ago, during one of the first of many difficult weeks in harry’s term. a bill advocating for the redivision of wizengamot seats had been proposed by a grassroots political organization and had quickly gained support among the general population. many members of the wizengamot, a very large majority of them wealthy, older purebloods with heavily conservative views had taken offense to the apparent usurping and had started a boycott that had lasted nearly three weeks. harry had been on the receiving on of many howlers and angry letters, and legal proceedings had been postponed for days. the ministry had been in complete turmoil, and harry had come home with a migraine each day.
draco smiles and takes a shaky breath - he had always teased harry for his less-than-extensive vocabulary, but had found it endearing, privately.
the next morning, hermione appears through the floo, her eyes puffy and bloodshot red, and her hair fastened into a haphazard bun. when she finds draco curled on the floor of his bedroom, still naked, she bursts into tears again. her maternal instincts seem to take over as she sits draco up and dresses him manually, and then hoists him up and leads him to the floo slowly.
draco bit his lip, staring resolutely out the window and forcing himself to stand still, lest he do something embarrassing, like throw himself into harry’s arms or burst into tears.
petunia cries harder, and draco has to work very hard to bite down a cruel smile. he stands before her, watching her cry and beg for a bit. beside her, dudley whimpers quietly, shaking violently, with his eyes trained on the back of his fathers meaty skull. eventually petunia’s sobs die down into soft sniffles, and draco continues.
“i’m scared of losing you,” draco whispers suddenly, shattering the quiet. behind him, harry sits up and pulls lightly at his shoulder in an attempt to turn his body. draco resists, shaking his head. “no, i - i just have to say this. and i can’t look at you when i do or i’ll lose my nerve.”
the floo roared just as harry took his steak off of the hob, smiling and silently congratulating himself on getting the timing perfect. he scooped a handful of potatoes onto two plates and paired it with some asparagus and a cut of meat and sent both plates to the table with a wave of his hand.
he had always admired his father, in the same way that young children looked up to superheroes or sports stars - the idolization distant and unfamiliar. narcissa, however, had doted on draco his entire life, and sheltered him from the darker parts of the world for as long as she possibly could. the veil had lifted, starting when he was sixteen and given the mark. now, that very same veil was being forcibly ripped from his eyes, exposing draco to the cruel reality of this life, and forcing him to confront the idea of navigating a world without narcissa malfoy in it.
another thing he didn’t understand - pureblood culture.
stupidly, draco steps aside and allows potter to come in. harry looks around, taking in the decor of draco's small cottage with a small smile on his face. draco watches him take it all in, prepared to kick him out or hex him if he dares to make a comment on the decor.
“i love you so much. even more than anyone else,” he whispers, his lips curving down into a frown. “well, except for the kids, of course. but everyone else.”
draco didn’t have to turn his head to know who had sidled up to him. he had been watching potter all night from his safe spot in the back of the ballroom. nobody else had made an attempt to try and talk to him, which he was fine with - he had only come to this ball because his mother had pleaded with him, desperate to restart her social climb. potter, on the other hand, had been in high demand all evening, being dragged from table to table by hermione granger, smiling and shaking hands, but mostly standing awkwardly to the side with his hands shoved in his pockets, like the vagabond he truly was.
when harry didn’t move, draco staggered forward, stopping at his bedside. he reached out to touch harry’s face - that warm, tan skin that he had kissed and stroked just a few hours ago - but recoiled at the inhuman chill there. harry had always radiated warmth, even on his worst days, but now there was no trace of it. tears welled in draco’s eyes as he stared down at harry, seemingly dozing beneath the white sheet.
“oh.” draco says, stupidly. he opens his mouth to say more, but then quickly shuts it again when he realizes that he has no more coherent thoughts.
harry stayed.
“just for us,” draco whispers, his fingers coming up to lace with harry’s. “yeah,”
draco stared up at the slowly changing sky - his mind bouncing sporadically from topic to topic. he pictures himself and harry, standing before their friends and family, their hands intertwined. he knew that harry would prefer a smaller wedding - one with only their closest loved ones. however, draco relished the idea of flaunting their domestic bliss before the entire wizarding world. another image materialized - of them visiting the french cottage, this time with a small bundle tucked in harry’s arms. more scenes flashed by rapidly - birthday parties, lie-in’s, sending off and receiving the hogwarts express - a happy, peaceful life.
he wills himself to stop crying, to stop falling apart like an emotionally underdeveloped teenager - but the grief pulls at him, dragging every part of his mind and body back towards that dark place he had discovered just last night on the floor of his shower. he takes several deep breaths, slow and steady like his mind healer had taught him after the war. he knows he should take a calming draught - maybe go outside and get some fresh air and drink some water. but his eyes don’t stop watering, and his chest doesn’t stop squeezing like every breath might be his last.
draco so upset? “what has potter done now?” pansy tried.
he stands and walks over the large mirror hanging on the wall, turning to the side to examine his new artwork. tears immediately spring to spring to his eyes as he runs his fingers over the ink. the tattoo is long - curving up from his hip and ending in a spiral under the crease of his arm. dozens of light green leaves cover a thin vine, dotted with small springs of wildflowers in lights pinks and purples. other flowers dot the vine as well - narcissus flowers, lilies of the valley, but the obvious main focus remains on the peppermint plant. the contrasting plants shouldn’t fit together - what with their vastly different origins, colors, and patterns - but luna had truly worked her magic, and blended it all together seamlessly. “thank you, luna,” he says softly, blinking away the dampness in the corners of his eyes. he’s not sad - in fact, he’s overwhelmed with joy, and a bittersweet feeling that tugs at his heart, but he won’t cry. not here. “i love it.”
when he had moved in, harry had had only three pathetic plants, each nearly dead and yellowing drastically. it had taken almost a year, but draco had single-handedly transformed their house into something that resembled a greenhouse. plants of all species covered nearly every available surface, leafy and brightly colored, and beautiful. draco liked taking care of them and watching them flourish made him happy. seeing draco happy, in turn, made harry happy - and so, the plants stayed. he watered them by hand, taking the time to speak softly to each about his plans for the day, or his thoughts on the last film he had watched, or what he thought would happen in the next cycle of wizengamot elections.
“harry, baby, you’re saying so many things right now. and i’m sure they’re wonderful things. but, all i can think about right now is your big d -” harry clapped a hand over draco’s mouth, cringing as the couple hurried down the hallway, and away from them.
his friends, his beautiful friends that have remained by his side after all these years, gather around his bedside, smiling down at him and nodding encouragingly. hermione’s eyes swim with tears as she pats kindly at draco’s thigh, no doubt reliving ron’s passing from just two years prior. “are you comfortable, draco?” she asks, and smiles gently when he nods jerkily.
when draco finally managed to peel himself from the ground of the forbidden forest, the sun had almost set completely, and the centaur had disappeared. he could hear the rustle of creatures through the trees, and felt distantly that he was being watched. however, he knew that nothing would touch him.
“i love you so much, draco,” he whispers, stroking the line of draco’s jaw.
, to allow harry to survive the night. he had, and things had gone back to normal, and draco had pretended that he didn’t see that shivering, sickly version of harry each time he looked at him. when he opens his mouth to speak again, the words escape in a broken sob. “i’m so tired, harry. i’m tired, and i’m scared. i’m watching you kill yourself, and it’s killing me.”
“been thinking about you,” potter murmured into draco’s neck, his fingers tearing at draco’s clothes. “want you to fuck me so bad,”
draco turns and takes one last long at his father, before glancing up at harry. his eyes are still  damp, swimming with unshed tears, and his nose and lips are a soft pink. harry pulls him in for a gentle kiss, his palm coming to rest on his cheek. then, draco pulls away and sweeps from the room, pulling the door shut behind him.
at some point, ron came down the steps with a babbling rose in his arms. his eyes were red-rimmed, but it’s obvious that he was attempting to hold it together for the sake of his family. he sat rose down on the ground, where she quickly became fascinated by a few wooden blocks. he sat on the couch beside draco, a tentative hand finding his back and rubbing large, comforting circles. when draco is able to calm himself down a bit, hermione pulled away and goes to sit on the other side of ron. she buried her face in his chest, and his arm went around her shoulder automatically and he began pressing gentle kisses to her temple. in a surprising display of intuition, he wrapped an arm around draco and pulls him close as well.
draco nodded despite himself, using the back of his dirty hand to wipe at his cheeks - he refused to sit here and blubber like a baby in front of this centaur.
“remind me to bring you one of those blueberry muffins harry makes,” draco says to jackson with a sigh. “you’ve certainly earned it.”
later, draco would realize that with every kiss, stroke, and gentle touch, harry had - in his own way - been saying goodbye.
“this isn’t your fault, draco,” harry murmured, pulling draco into his lap. he went easily, burying his face in harry’s shoulder and wrapping his arms around his neck. “you haven’t done anything wrong.”
i’m terrified of you finding someone better for you - someone who really deserves you… because i just love you, so fucking much, it kind of scares me sometimes, and -“
“hmph,” harry says softly, turning and walking slowly towards lucius. “just me and you now, huh, lucius?” he looks down at lucius, who doesn’t speak or move. “i’ve thought a lot about how i want to kill you. not
from this close, he could see the exhaustion written across harry’s face - his eyelids were heavy, and the bags beneath his eyes were slowly becoming more pronounced as each long day passed. his smile, always fixed, seemed forced - even more so than usual. suddenly, draco found himself wishing that granger would wrap everything up and end the event, if only so that he would have an excuse to drag harry home and into bed, where they could curl around each other and pretend as if no one else existed for just a few hours. as hermione continued to speak passionately, harry watched her, smiling indulgently each time she glanced at him, or in the general direction of their table. draco only half-listened - his eyes lingering on the curve of harry’s jaw, exposed by the high neck of his robes.
as if he isn’t getting fucking married.
for now, he sets the phone aside and grabs his wine glass, taking a deep swig. his fingers tremble as he brings the joint to his lips again. a loud sob bursts from his lips, and he doesn’t bother trying to stop himself.
“the usual,” draco murmured, “tending to the gardens, studying, being generally evil. you know how it is.”
that first time, draco had bent harry over the back of the couch and ravished him there - so suddenly desperate for him that he couldn’t be bothered to take potter upstairs, to his bedroom. when they had finally made it to the bedroom, they had fucked for what felt like hours, each orgasm somehow better than the last. finally, they had collapsed beside each other, just barely touching, and breathing heavily. once potter had caught his breath, he had stood from the bed and shot draco a grin before going into the bathroom and taking a shower in draco’s en-suite. draco had layed in bed, slightly dazed and wondering if he had perhaps hallucinated the entire thing, a relic of his hogwarts fantasies playing out years later for some unknown reason.
“that would be brilliant, mother,” draco pressed a kiss to her cheek and held her for a moment longer before letting go. she turns her face away, wiping at the tears in her eyes before he can see them. draco turned towards his father, suddenly unsure of how to proceed. his father had never been one for physical affection towards anyone besides narcissa - but the idea of not seeing his father again for years made him crave something more than a stiff handshake.
about, harry! won’t you even ask? aren’t you the least bit concerned that your mind is so…
“what the fuck, harry!” draco shouted, rising from his seat. “where the hell have you been?”
theodore surely isn’t ugly - with his sharp jaw and brown hair and pale green eyes, he even somewhat favors -
“oh, draco,” pansy stood and rushed around the table, wrapping draco in a hug. for all that she was a slytherin, she had never quite mastered subtlety when it came to her affection for her loved ones. “you won’t lose him. i promise. he worships the ground you walk on. he would never do something to hurt you.”
andrew had been remarkably patient - never pressuring draco into doing anything he didn’t wan to do, and being respectful of his boundaries at all times. they hadn’t even kissed until the end of their fifth date, when draco pulled him close at the end of the night and brushed their lips together lightly, savoring the feeling of fireworks exploding in his chest. it had been so long since he had felt anything of the sort - he had quickly called pansy and screamed to her for nearly an hour about their five second kiss, and ended the call feeling a bit like a ridiculous teenage girl. the first time that they slept together, draco had excused himself to the bathroom afterwards for a very long time, doing his best to stop himself from hyperventilating and nearly being sick everywhere. he had come out of the bathroom to andrew greeting him with a warm blanket and a spread of fruits and cheeses, and his stomach had twisted unfamiliarly.
“like that, do you?” draco murmurs, his warm breath ghosting over harry’s lips.
then, they go home.
“yeah…” harry says softly. “but ‘mione says that before i can do anything i should see a mind healer. i think it’s rubbish. i’m just glad to be out of the war, i’d rather not have to relive it every week.” he snorts, and draco turns in his arms, looking up at him.
“you know, malfoy,” potter said, sidling closer to draco, a grin spread across his face. “you’re kind of funny when you’re not being a prat.”
through it all, draco’s love remained steadfast and unwavering, ready for harry to reach out once more and reconnect with him again.
“whazzat?” he murmured sleepily. “someone get a new bird?”
’s from the room. as they ate, draco was almost able to forget that he was at a ministry event, and not sitting in his own dining room, eating and listening to ron and harry make idiotic jokes while sharing amused looks with hermione from across the table. it was almost as if they were teenagers again - listening to hermione hiss at ron to not scarf his food down so quickly while harry guffawed behind his hand and ate it only a marginally more civilized manner. across the table, ginny had already polished off three glasses of wine and kept tapping the rim of her glass for a refill - her eyes were bright, her cheeks pink, and her smile mischievous. draco estimated that it would only take a few more drinks before she and luna began to twirl through the tables, effectively creating their own dance floor. with each course that appeared before them, the donation board steadily climbed, with hermione doing an excited dance in her seat each time another milestone was crossed. in between dessert and mignardise, draco penned a check for seven hundred and fifty galleons - when the contribution appeared on the board, she reached over and squeezed his arm, her eyes damp and smile brilliant.
they stand in the garden for a long while - holding each other close and occasionally kissing but mostly standing in silence, leaning into each other. draco drinks in the novelty of the moment - belatedly realizing that he hasn’t felt this happy, or this at peace in ages.
a hush falls over the room as harry and draco step up to the staircase - he doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to the way that people seem to momentarily forget how to speak around him. harry can feel every eye in the building trained on himself and draco - draco smiles graciously and looks around the room slowly, while harry awkwardly purses his lips and nods stiffly at the herald.
he knocked twice, pressing his forehead to the door and murmuring a quiet, “harry?”
“nothing,” draco had murmured, collapsing onto the ground beside harry, ignoring the fact that he was going to end up with grass stains all over his trousers and expensive dress robes. he had laced his fingers through harry’s and bought them to his lips, pressing a gentle kiss to his bruised knuckles. “never mind that, now.”
they don’t talk much for the rest of the evening, but ron and hermione both stay through the night, moving from room to room and helping draco pack his things. they inevitably encounter things of harry’s - first, a old tattered sweater that draco holds to his face, inhaling deeply. harry’s familiar scent is gone, but the warmth lingers and provides draco with a semblance of comfort.
“i’m sorry,” harry whispers, “please don’t go.”
as with every dark cloud, there were always silver linings.
when draco had originally began seeing harry, his parents had been extremely reluctant to accept their relationship. there had been multiple long talks on preserving the family name, and following pureblood customs, and other rubbish that draco had dutifully ignored. eventually, they had began to accept their relationship - his mother had simply been pleased that draco had seemingly found his soulmate and was happy. lucius had muttered something about optics and rebranding and had stopped actively picking fights with harry - although his mouth was perpetually twisted into a frown whenever the two were forced to interact. family dinners had been infrequent and tense, and draco had almost always had to make up for them with lots of groveling and kisses afterwards.
as he focuses in on draco’s arse, harry finds himself immediately transfixed. he grabbed at the fleshy globes before him, squeezing and kneading them. since the beginning of their relationship, harry had had a bit of a fixation with draco’s arse - he could (and had) spent hours kisssing, touching, and playing with it, much to the chagrin of his boyfriend.
“you all don’t understand, i - i was practically in shock. i felt like i would be sick, afterwards. at first i thought was sort of erotic, mind you. if that’s what we look like when we’re in the sack, then i’ll stop brewing right now and begin my pornography career. but then it got...emotional. he did the neck thing.” draco sighed, running a hand through his hair. his voice has lost its edge, and he sounds strangely vulnerable. “our neck thing.”
hurting you.” draco threatens. harry opens his mouth to retort, but draco silences him with a look. “i know that you think that you’re invincible because that tosser voldemort couldn’t kill you despite his best efforts, but you are still human, and therefore vulnerable to hypothermia and injuries sustained from falling off of your fucking broom because you tried to fly in less than optimal conditions.”
draco nodded tearfully, unrolling the socks and placing one on each hand, rubbing them across his face with a satisfied sigh.
draco pushes his fingers in completely, feeling for that familiar spot that he knows will push harry over the edge. as he hits it, harry practically shouts, his hips snapping forward and his cock brushing the back of draco’s mouth. as his breaths become rapid and his moans dissolve into whimpers, harry pulls out of draco’s mouth, immediately taking his cock in hand.
“goodnight, draco,” harry murmured, already half asleep and drowsy. he wrapped an arm around draco’s waist and pulled him even closer, breathing deeply into his neck. “mmm, love you so much.”
ring in the air.
it’s harry who initiates the kiss, pulling draco’s chin upwards and connecting their lips slowly, sweetly. the moment is picturesque: the sun setting in the background as they hold each other, the waves crashing around their bare feet - the evidence of their love on the ground beside them.
“he’s obviously a complete dunderhead,” draco inserted, knowing that pansy didn’t truly need his comfort. she was a resilient girl, and would bounce back with another paramour within the next two weeks.
the darkness pools onto the ceiling above draco, forming one long drop that hangs from the ceiling, descending towards him slowly.
“no matter that,” pansy said, waving her hands dismissively. “draco, tell them what you told me.”
he had only needed to brew a few batches of pepper-up potion - a request from one of his most frequent customers in an attempt to combat the upcoming flu season. draco hummed quietly to himself as he crushed the bicorn horn, his mind far away as his hands worked automatically, already very familiar with the process of making this particular potion. his thoughts had wandered, as they tended to do, to harry.
“going somewhere, draco?” ron shouted, catching a pair of loafers that nearly smacked him in the head.
“no.” harry says, pulling draco upright. “at least, not for him.”
“for fucks sake, draco, you can’t even walk,” harry groaned as he pushed draco into the wall and paused to catch his breath.
all eyes in the room shifted to draco as the door burst open, including harry’s. his expression fluttered rapidly through relief, surprise, and excitement, before landing on simple joy. draco doesn’t remember moving, or seeing harry ever change positions, but suddenly they’re in each others arms - grappling at each other desperately.
than vernon, but the sound is satisfying nonetheless. with another flick of his wrist, vernon’s body floats into the air, and draco guides him into the front seat of the car. he takes a moment to amuse himself, placing vernon’s meaty hands on the steering wheel and then laughing when they flop off, into his lap. he looks even larger, stuffed into the tight front seat - a bit like an overstuffed turkey. he does the same for petunia, sitting her up in the passenger seat and crossing her hands tightly in her lap. he snorts as her head lolls dangerously to the side.
the entire table watches him with rapt attention, their faces frozen with shock or disgust.
one night, draco woke to find harry beside him, curled into a tight ball and sobbing silently. his shoulders shook with the force of his grief.
“oh, draco,” pansy sighs, at a total loss for words. she doesn’t try to hug him - a testament to how well she knows him after all these years. instead, she flicks her wand and places a privacy charm around them, giving draco the room to be as loud as he needs without the public eye on him. “i’m sorry, love.”
resolving to take his mind off of the dream with brewing, draco descended into his lab. he set up all of his supplies and subconsciously began working on one of his mail-in orders.
because he does. even after two years, after heartbreak and isolation and despair and grieving someone who was still very much alive, simply out of reach - draco still loves him, and will probably continue to love him, no matter what harry says or does.
“engaged,” he says softly. “drew is good to me.” he adds, letting the unspoken
“draco? what are you doing here?”
“hello?” draco felt a bit proud of himself for figuring out the phone so quickly. he usually fumbled for at least a minute before being able to accept the call.
“of course, draco,” harry interrupts. he’s willing to give draco anything he needs, whether that means carrying him home bridal style right now, or slaughtering every other pureblood in a hundred mile radius. “take anything you need.”
it stumbles from his lips easily, partially pushed out by his alcohol consumption but still whole in its authenticity. he had known that he loved harry for the longest time - for so long that it had begun to feel like second nature, loving harry. he knew that he loved him, just as he knew that the sky was blue and that he was a wizard. but telling harry, even after they had forged a tentative relationship, had been one of the most difficult things that draco had ever done. even after tackling the initial mounting of saying it for the first time, saying it to harry as often as he wanted to proved to be another monster in itself.
” he blinks hard, his chest heaving and his voice wavering. draco opens his arms and harry goes into them easily, pressing his ear into draco’s chest, searching for his heartbeat. he finds it, and he relaxes marginally. “it was so -
as harry presses into draco, a moan falls from his lips, his back arching slightly. harry drills into him unrelentingly, one hand gripping draco’s hip firmly. the hand holds him in place, and keeps him from grinding down onto harry’s hand the way he wants to. the stretch is a blissful pain - it’s only been three days and draco feels as tight as he did the first time they ever fell into bed together.
at least, that’s what the daily prophet had said.
“shut the fuck up, you filthy muggle,”  draco sneers, spinning in his seat. harry had flinched as vernon had started spewing his drivel, and draco suddenly wanted his head on a stick. he pulls out his wand and shoves it towards vernon, savouring the way he flinches. “get out of the car. all of you. now.”
the dursleys amble out of the car clumsily, standing awkwardly in the middle of the road while draco watches, leaning against the side of the car. harry stands further away, his arms crossed in front of his chest. he’s been hesitating all night - as if he wants draco to take the lead. draco accepts the role gladly.
pansy pulled draco into an embrace, continuing to wipe away his never ending flow of tears. they had known that draco was an emotional drunk, but none of the slytherins had expected to have to console a weeping draco for nearly two hours while he listed everything he loved about harry potter.
“he’s sure!” harry calls, grinning. draco pinches harry’s forearm, which is wrapped around his waist, but burrow deeper into his side nonetheless.
“oh, pans... i’m sorry about that,” draco starts, but pansy interrupts him anyways.
draco fished out the box containing the chamomile leaves, sighing deeply when he shook the box and found it much lighter than it should’ve been. he doesn’t bother opening it - instead slamming it on the counter and shutting his eyes tight. he doesn’t want to have to touch the box - this box that had belonged to harry only. he wants to let it sit, and gather dust for years, a small relic of their life together before the fates had torn them apart. but his head aches, and the possible comfort and familiarity that the peppermint tea may bring him lures him back into the cabinet, reaching for the pale green tin.
harry sat in a stunned silence, unsure of what to say. he wanted to reach out and comfort draco, but wasn’t sure how it would be received. suddenly, draco choked out a loud, heart wrenching sob, his fork clattering onto his plate and shattering the quiet. he buried his face in his hands, his shoulders heaving with each sob.
“we have his things,” one of the aurors steps forward. draco thinks that it’s harry’s partner, judging by the dampness in his eyes. “from his desk.”
it was his signature move - after he came, he would bury his face in draco’s neck, leaving gentle kisses on the sensitive skin, and murmuring love declarations. draco knew that harry had been with a few men and women before him, and it was likely that he had done the same to them in the throes of passion. yet, it was something so intimate, and so private that it physically pained him to see it being done with anyone else - more so than anything else that had happened in the dream.
“anyways, on to happier things! where are you now? what’s all that noise? let me guess: morocco? the maldives?”
“proposed to your girlfriend?” draco looks over at harry, unsure if he looks hurt or angry or sad or a strange mix of the three. “bloody hell, harry, you caught me off guard! i thought i was just your little secret… a stress reliever of sorts… and then you were there, telling me that you loved me, and i didn’t know how to react!”
that night, in the bed that he had never gotten the opportunity to share, draco dreams of ocean breeze and open arms.
harry was, without question, the best person that draco had ever met. he was selfless and generous and unfailingly kind to everyone he met. harry deserved to be doted on and looked after by everyone he met, to have the ground he walked on worshipped. he didn’t deserve cupboards, and to be called a freak, and to feel unloved and insecure -
“i’m sorry, baby,” draco whispers, “i should’ve checked with you again before i - did you not want me to…”
,” the chase reaches a culmination as they arrive in the living room, before the same fireplace draco had walked through just a few hours ago, unwittingly into heartbreak. harry crumbles to his knees on the carpet before draco, reaching for him but not quite touching him. his entire body trembles with the force of his cries. draco can’t seem to bring himself to stop staring at harry’s pocket, where a corner of the small green plastic bag sticks out. he swallows. “i can’t believe you’re doing this,” harry cries, “you’re so
draco kisses him back eagerly, melting in harry’s palms like putty. this is what he’s missed for so long - this passion, the fire, the warmth. harry feels alive, pressed close to him. he thinks, for a few long moments, that they can make this work, that harry can truly give up his habit, and that things will return to how they were before all of this. they will return to lying nose-to-nose, tangled together as they further plan their life together. in the future, when they are married and have children with sleek dark hair, or wild blonde hair - they’ll lean into each and smile. these two years, this dark period, will be a small, unremarkable blip on the timeline that is their love. they will look back on this and hold each other close, and whisper quiet things about overcoming, and being stronger for it. they will live clean, and happily, and every moment will feel like this one - scorching and heavy with passion. harry pulls away, and draco looks up at him, grinning like a fool.
“peppermint tea,” harry grinned, looking quite proud of himself. “good for headaches. did you know that peppermint -”
“yes,” draco said simply, swirling his drink in his hand. the ice had long melted, and he had no interest in finishing the low grade alcohol that the ministry had provided. he raised the glass to his lips and took a sip anyways, just to give himself something to do.
pansy slapped blaise across the back of his head, before turning to draco with a wavering smile. “draco, let’s be realistic here. harry’s mad about you. and he’s a gryffindor... he’d never be unfaithful.”
draco had tried to explain parts of it to harry, early on in their relationship, but had quickly given up when harry’s eyes had glazed over and had become more interested in trying to tug off draco’s top. even now, years later, he still didn’t understand.
harry unlocked the door with a wave of his hand, and paused once more in the doorway, peering into the darkness. draco stands beside him, uncharacteristically patient. after a moment, harry moves forward slowly,  stopping once again at the foot of the stairs. he places a shaky hand on the rail, seemingly leaning on it.
draco gasps slightly, the same way he always does. nothing can ever prepare him to hear harry’s voice again - rich and full of life. each time, it feels as if he’s been drenched with a bucket of freezing water.
a witch with a stack of paperwork floating behind her watched him from a safe distance, her eyes wide. draco supposed he looked a bit erratic, what with the way he had begun walking in fast circles and curling and uncurling his fingers.
love came easily to harry, yet he remained patient with draco and his aversion to overt emotional vulnerability.  which, of course, was constant. except for when he had had a few drinks.
harry hums noncommittally in response, his arms pulling draco even closer. a low moan fell from his lips as draco finally pulled his hands from his hair - smoothing it away from his face and planting a soft kiss on harry’s forehead. rather than returning draco’s gentle ministrations, harry - never one for subtlety, bucked his hips shallowly.
pansy had been the first of the slytherin's to heed his complaints of being the only snake in the group, and had eventually begun attending pub nights. and then blaise had followed, and theo and goyle - and suddenly it was a full-fledged hogwarts reunion, every single friday.
“which part?” draco doesn’t look at him, doesn’t trust himself to, so he simply continues staring upwards, nearly going blind.
all things must come to an end.
“die, probably,” harry snorted. draco cocked an eyebrow as he fumbled with his own robes. harry opened his eyes, hazy and unguarded without his glasses. “i don’t know. my social battery is depleted, and i don’t have the energy to flirt with you. i’m sorry.” draco laughs quietly, leaning in close and pressing a fleeting kiss to harry’s lips. harry smiles weakly. “but i love you. you looked amazing tonight.”
and now, he was being forced to watch as his mother became slightly more unrecognizable each day, the cloudiness in her eyes slowly spreading and fogging her mind. he had seen firsthand what had happened to his patients with similar afflictions, and knew what was soon coming directly for his mother and dreading it terribly. the knowledge of what would soon become of her hung over their every interaction like a dark cloud, poisoning even the most innocent of conversations or touches.
tonight was different. draco found himself lost in pleasure as harry kneeled over him, driving into him slowly and making his toes curl. draco wrapped his arms around harry’s neck, sobbing with pleasure into his neck as euphoria washed over him again and again. he lost track of how many times he came apart under harry’s ministrations - swimming in the mindless bliss and bonelessness of multiple orgasms.
he was in the kitchen preparing dinner when the phone rang. he rushes over to it, drying his hands and fumbling with the mobile for a moment before putting it to his ear.
“draco,” pansy said softly, a massive contrast to her tone seconds prior. “you have to talk to harry eventually.”
rolling his eyes, harry pulled draco back, towards his mouth, laving his tongue across his hole without warning. he lapped at draco’s hole with the flat of his tongue, drinking in the familiar, musky taste of draco malfoy. draco moaned gently, canting his hips backwards before dropping his head down once more, swallowing harry again. as harry ate draco with abandon, slowly fucking his tongue into draco and opening him up, draco sucked at his cock with the same fervor, humming and moaning around harry’s member.
for a long while, neither harry nor draco move. harry stares hard at the table, at the small green bag, and draco watches him, watches his shoulder twitch and him wet his lips again and again. finally, harry shakes his head, wiping his hands over his eyes and standing. before draco can process it, harry is standing before him, leaning down to pull his lips into a searing kiss.
he brushes harry’s hair away from his face, still wild and untameable and absolutely breathtaking. he runs his trembling fingers over his eyes, his nose, his lips, his jaw - trying desperately to memorize every curve and bump and line, if only so that he can pretend to hold him close, even after he leaves this room and his time with harry comes to an end forever. he already knows so much of his body, after years of fighting and fucking and kissing and
“it’s amazing,” ron mused quietly - draco turned to him with an arched eyebrow. he was still watching hermione, although his eyes flickered over to harry, at her side. “they both knew nothing about this world, or magic, twenty years ago… and now they navigate it like they’ve been doing it their entire lives. harry’s the bloody minister - still can’t believe that, by the way, and ‘mione… she’s amazing.”
, because he knew that draco wouldn’t do anything about it. this is harry - the reason why he had spent months holed up in ron and hermione’s guest bedroom, trembling with fear and debilitating anxiety. the reason why he had hardly been able to stomach anything of substance without running to the bathroom to be sick, or to break down into tears.
draco felt the sting of a cleaning charm and heard the familiar pop of the plastic cap on their lube bottles, and absently wondered when harry had summoned it. he couldn’t think too critically about it though, because harry was teasing his hole with his thumb, rubbing slow circles around the wrinkled skin. harry’s thumb abruptly disappeared, but is quickly replaced with the cool press of his lube covered fingers.
“it’s harry,” she sobs into his chest, sounding utterly heart-broken on draco’s behalf. it befuddles him, but is still somewhat comforting. however, he knows she’s mostly mourning the loss of her best friend. in seconds, harry had transformed from her best friend, to a faceless, abusive monster. she let out another heart-wrenching cry, and draco felt the strange desire to reach out and comfort her, as if he hadn’t been the one getting strangled. “he’s been hurting him. draco, harry’s been hurting draco. we should’ve seen it, ron, god - all this time. he - he always said that draco was just moody and reclusive but he was just… he was -”
and then they were alone.
as harry finishes with irma higgs and sets his sights on another, equally old, equally boring, and equally loaded donor, draco pulls away.
“did you cheat on him?” theo asked, suddenly seeming more fascinated in the conversation than ever. “are you just projecting onto him?”
at this, harry laughs and pulls draco’s hands from his face, pressing gentle kisses to his palms and fingers. “that won’t be necessary, i hope,” he says with a smile.
“it’s just a kiss,” harry said resolutely, pulling away. he began to undo the remaining buttons on draco’s top - getting almost to the bottom before draco distracted him with another kiss.
“you heard me,” draco says, turning to fix seamus with a steady look. he smiles politely, tilting his head a bit. “potter put a ring on she-weasley’s finger, but he was just grabbing his ankles for me the other night… congratulations on your engagement though, really.”
he just starts talking, as if he had been holding it in for a long time and had been waiting until he was before draco to finally let go. he tells draco about losing granger and all of the weasley’s, about feeling hopeless and terribly alone, about volunteering at charities and guest lecturing at hogwarts whenever headmistress mcgonagall asks him to.
draco stares over at him unabashedly. he had been caught before, embarrassingly enough, staring at harry with clear affection in his eyes by the tabloids. the photos themselves had been gorgeous - harry looking away, draco looking at him, his expression soft and unguarded, his body always leaning forward in his seat, as if drawn to harry by a sort of strange magnetism. however, the headlines that accompanied these photos were always salacious and downright inflammatory - ranging from accusations of love potion usage to fabricated stories about cheating scandals and hard-earned forgiveness. their relationship had been heavily documented and commented on in the press, must to their chagrin. but now, the cameras were trained on hermione, and draco was permitted all of the soft, disgustingly open looks in harry’s direction he could muster. beneath the table, he placed a gentle hand on harry’s knee, his stomach fluttering like that of a teenager when he felt harry’s rough palm move to rest atop his hand.
“i was close,” he whimpers, a hand trailing down to grab at his leaking cock. as expected, harry slaps away draco’s hand, a devilish smirk playing across his lips.
“he’s gone,” draco whispered, partly to himself. his lip trembled as a sob escape his throat, following quickly by another. and then he was crying gently into the floor of the forbidden forest, the centaur watching him with an odd expression.
“if this is what you need to do to feel okay,” ron said, clapping his hands together and spreading his lips into a thin line. “then we’ve got your back completely.”
at the floo, draco would kiss harry deeply his hand disappearing beneath the red auror robe and tracing patterns on his back. harry would lean into this moment, eagerly cupping draco’s face with his hands as he kissed him earnestly. and then, cruelly, draco would shove harry through the floo, often sporting a semi, with a devilish grin painted across his face.
“no, you tosser!” draco snapped, glaring at blaise. “i wasn’t involved in the situation, at all. and if we were going to have a threesome, why not do it in our own bed? they were in his office, in the dark, fully clothed. it was obviously a quickie.”
the night ends, finally, and draco finds himself seated at their kitchen table, nursing a mug of coffee and absently picking at a slice of toast. he had taken only half a bite from it before his stomach had rejected the idea of enjoying a solid breakfast. he sits at their table, staring blankly ahead at harry’s empty seat and sips from his mug, enjoying the bitter sting of the dark coffee down his throat. he usually takes it with heaps of cream and sugar - enough to always make harry wrinkle his nose and shake his head, murmuring slick remarks about how draco was better off drinking a glass of milk. he loves those mornings - when harry fetches draco’s favorite sage green mug and prepares him the perfect coffee before pressing it into his hands with a gentle kiss to the forehead. those moments are warm, and familiar. draco doesn’t want to feel the warmth - he wants to be awake, and alert. he drinks his black coffee from a fire engine red mug.
harry looped an arm around draco’s waist as he half-carried him down the hall - pausing every few seconds to readjust his grip. draco was entirely useless, only using his strength to press sloppy kisses to harry’s cheek and neck.
“will you ever learn how to properly use a floo?” he snarks, taking harry’s hand and lacing their fingers together. already, the other witches and wizards in the atrium begin glancing over at them, talking in hushed whispers and terribly concealed curiosity.
his five o’clock shadow, paired with his long hair piled atop his head cause harry to appear ruggedly handsome. he looks like the man that draco fell in love with, the man that he craves everyday, and misses dearly. his eyes, however, are shifty and never quite meet draco’s, instead fluttering somewhere over his shoulder, as if following an invisible snitch. he sits before draco with a tense smile and takes a large sip of his coffee, sighing contently. draco studies him, his grip on his own mug tight as he watches the carefree way harry moves, as if everything hasn’t changed between them again.
“all of it. the end… you…?”
“merlin’s beard, this is ridiculous.” blaise said, “you couldn’t See your way out of fucking cauldron, malfoy. potter loves you. it’s obvious. why do you insist on torturing us if you wont even give us anything in return? for example, the excellent head you claim to give.”
from there, the night rapidly picks up speed. after a clearly suggestive head jerk from hermione, harry and draco begin circling the room as well, chatting up random ministry workers and ancient purebloods with vaults in gringotts almost the size of draco’s. the conversations are easy, and all follow the same formula. harry smiles politely and exchanges pleasantries, always making sure to include the person's name and something small he remembers. draco had taught him this trick early on in his career - asking after spouses, or kids, or pets, or initiatives is the easiest way to make someone feel important enough to be remembered by harry, thus making them more likely to open their coin purses and throw money at whatever cause harry was supporting. tonight, it was
“‘ve been paged,” harry grunts, tripping into his trousers. “probably a raid,”
once he had finished tending to his plants, draco fed and stroked the cat, also taking time to press gentle kisses to her furry head and asking her politely what she thought about the recent dip in the wizarding stock market. she didn’t respond, as expected, and so he moved on.
“harry must be using the store,” hermione murmured, rubbing a comforting hand in circles on draco’s back. “i wonder if he’s experiencing any difficulties as well,”
“yeah,” draco said softly, folding the sweater carefully and sending it down the stairs with a flick of his wand. “i think i will.”
, draco reassures himself as he is swallowed by the green flames,
“harry,” draco whispers, his voice catching on his name. “harry, harry,
“well,” the healer said, stepping from the elevator. at the end of the hallway, there was a large group of healers surrounding a door. despite the crowd, there was complete silence. “it looks like a suicide attempt,” the healer said quietly, looking over at hermione.
it’s a lesson that draco learned reluctantly from a young age, and had experienced a thousand times over since then. he remembers his mother’s mesmerizing magical light shows, always fading after a few moments, before he could truly appreciate their beauty. christmas evenings at the manor, when his family would abandon their pureblood traditions and laugh openly and loudly together, genuinely appreciating each other’s company, would wind down much too quickly for his liking, leaving him anxious for the next years holiday season.
when harry finally pulls out of draco, he whimpers at the loss, reaching for harry and whining for him to stay, if only for a moment longer. harry detangled himself from draco, covering him with a blanket and placing a gentle but lingering kiss to the corner of his mouth.
last to stumble over to the table were harry and draco, who didn’t even bother trying to sit. now that the music had ceased, draco’s slow, sultry maneuvers looked a lot more like drunken stumbling.
“i love you, too,” draco murmurs, meaning it with more certainty, more intensity than he has ever meant anything. “goodnight, harry.”
and then potter had appeared again, with his hair wild and damp and looking practically edible, and he had leaned over draco and pressed their lips together, his hand coming to rest on draco’s cheek.
“please don’t hate me, draco,” he whispers, shattering draco’s heart one more time, because why not. “i know you did…. do…but, please,”
“draco,” she said softly, maintaining eye contact with him. draco had always had the prettiest eyes, one pale blue and the other a gorgeous silver. how she hated to see them so sad. “my love,
she flushes once more before flapping her hands in the air excitedly and whisking away, her robes fluttering majestically behind her as she sweeps off to drag one politician or the other into a conversation.
“should i order another round?” hermione asked, finishing off her glass of red wine. true to her character, she had been nursing the same glass for nearly the entire time, while everyone else had lapped her at least three times.
“well, i - i tried my best. i did what i could for the boy!” she nods jerkily, as if trying to convince herself of the words coming out of her mouth. “
as the words leave his mouth, draco scans their faces once more, feeling his heart begin to descend as his brain connects the puzzle pieces. there are important ministry men - there’s no reason for them to be standing on the porch of his and harry’s home… unless -
draco straightens his back and glares at the creature, emboldened by his grief. “why didn’t you help him?” his voice is loud and threatening, but the centaur remains unphased. draco had heard from the aurors that it had been a centaur who had relayed the news to hagrid about harry potter’s dead body in the forest. he wasn’t sure which centaur it was, but he didn’t care. as far as he was concerned, they were all equally guilty in failing to protect harry. “you just let him die - he needed help!”
“i hate galas,” harry groans as he pulls off his glasses. he drops them without a care, but a gust of wandless and wordless magic sends them to his bedside table - this particular party trick never failed to make draco marvel silently at harry’s innate power and magical skill. he runs his hands through his hair, releasing the long locks from their modest knot at the base of his neck. “even the ones hosted by my best friend,” his hands go to his tie next, which he struggles with for a moment before draco steps forward, undoing the knot in mere seconds. harry sighs, his eyes fluttering shut. “christ, thank you.”
harry drops to his knees, perfecting the rhythm of his palm and swallowing draco’s nearly fully-erect cock in one go. draco responds immediately, gasping loudly as his fingers come down to grip harry’s head. he takes draco’s length easily - swallowing to the hilt and pausing for a moment to allow himself to adjust.
even in death, harry potter is beautiful.
“my dragon,” she whispered, finally allowing her tears to fall. she reaches up and cups his cheek. her rings press into his skin, a direct contrast to the soft skin of her palm. her touch is comforting and draco finds himself leaning into it. for a moment, he wishes that he was a young boy again, and that it was appropriate for him to bury his face in his mother’s robes and hide from the world until things were less scary. “you’re still so young… too young to have experienced this much pain.”  she pulls him into a hug, and he readily wraps his arms around her, holding her close to his chest.
outside, the world seemed to have been gently wrapped in a soft blanket of white. the snow fell incessantly, coating everything in a fresh layer of snow. it went on for miles - an endless landscape of bright white and not much else.
“touch me, harry,” draco choked out, his riding growing frantic as he chased his release. obediently, harry reached down and stroked draco’s cock - paying special attention to the sensitive head. it was obvious that he was close - his neck was flushed and his fingers had begun grappling for purchase on harry’s shoulders - squeezing him tightly. filled with a renewed sense of passion, harry gripped draco’s hips and took over, fucking up into draco with fervor.
he’s talking in slightly confusing circles now, his hands fluttering through the air as he speaks rapidly. the metaphorical plug that had been stopping him up for however long had been pulled, and now harry was spilling out every part of him, right here at draco’s small kitchen table.
“can we go down to the beach?” he asked, his eyes big and bright. “i want to feel the sand in my toes! and other places…” he giggled to himself, waggling his eyebrows at harry.
she purred softly in response before returning to her grooming, and draco left the kitchen, humming quietly to himself. he goes to call for harry once more, but decides against it. surprising him would be much more gratifying. at the beginning of their relationship, harry had constantly regarded draco with a soft of open-mouthed awe that never failed to make him blush - his eyes twinkling and his lips curled into a wide grin that showed off the whiteness of his teeth. as time had gone on, harry had evidently grown used to whatever it was about draco that had previously enthralled him.
theodore, who had appeared at the bottom of the staircase, was the next to go.
harry registered the exact moment that draco realized - his eyes widened dramatically and a shaky gasp exploded from him, and then he was clutching the letter in his fists, reading it over, and over, and over again. shaking his head no, whimpering softly - again and again
when he finally finished, he glanced around once more, before turning to catch draco’s eye again. instantaneously, his mask melted and his eyes grew fond, and draco’s heart swelled in his chest. when harry turned back to the table, the look was gone. a few of the aurors raised their hands, while others scribbled furiously in their notebooks and legal pads.
“are we supposed to know the significance of this neck thing?” blaise asked quietly, shattering the tension.
at least, that’s what ron weasley whispers to him as he tries to gently pull draco away from harry’s body, rubbing soothing circles into his back and trying to pretend as if he’s not crying too.
draco placed his palms flat on the table, ducking his head between his arms. he let out a loud scream, wrought with frustration, before dropping his supplies and vanishing the cauldron completely. wiping his palms on his joggers, he abandoned his station, slamming the door behind him hard as he left.
potter wraps his arms around draco’s body. for a second, draco thinks that he’s hugging him - that potter is attempting to comfort him. instead, potter turns on his heel and disapparates, tugging draco along with him.
“draco,” harry said softly, sitting beside him and wrapping his arms around his trembling body. “draco, baby -”
on friday evening, draco goes to the manor for dinner with his parents.
they stand and watch the car burn until the very last flame splutters out weakly.
“i don’t expect anything from you.'' harry says, and this wraps around draco tight, and squeezes him. it’s so similar to what harry had said that night ‘i don’t want anything with you’, but then it had been laced with malice and practically cruel. now, draco resists the temptation to purr as harry speaks to him, his words soft and sweet as satin. now, harry wants with dracom this much is obvious. but he doesn’t demand it. draco has the power - the ability to break both of their hearts. “but my god, it was so real. every moment. it was never fake, i was never fake with you.”
“and that’s our cue.” harry says loudly, steering a writhing draco towards the door. “i’m just going to get him to bed. goodnight, all!”
he had just seen harry
“harry,” he says, finally saying his name. it tumbles out of him clumsily - he hasn’t said it in over a year. references to his past are minimal and non-descript. andrew had been adamant about moving forward and not allowing the past to define their future together, and draco had readily accepted this dogma. harry was very rarely mentioned by name, and the impact he had on draco’s daily life was handled with care. “why did you come here?”
he doesn’t know this body - this body that is littered in strange marks, this body that does not move, or breathe, or radiate warmth or comfort, or smile crookedly and offer peppermints. he knows harry - harry potter, who does all of these things and more. but he can’t find harry - not in this body, not in their home, in their bed - not anywhere he should be.
harry had ordered him out of bed this morning and into the shower at almost seven a.m, his eyes bright and his smile mischievous. when draco had stumbled down the stairs an hour later, still half asleep, he had been greeted with a full breakfast spread - including fresh fruit, waffles, eggs, and pastries.
“i’m in love with him,” draco cried, burying his face in pansy’s lap. “but i can’t have him.”
finally, harry closes the gap, pressing their lips and bodies together.
“yea,” he says softly, walking behind dudley. “it’s my biggest regret, ever being like that. i make up for it every single day. you know, i would kill that version of myself if i could. but i can’t, not really. so i suppose you’ll have to do.”
there is no warning before harry delivers the first slap - just a swish of air and then the sound of his hand coming into contact with the flesh of draco’s arse. he yelps in surprise, but finds himself leaning into the contact, his eyes watering with arousal. harry lands several more slaps on his arse, draco moaning softly with each one. this isn’t new, but it had been so long that draco forgot exactly how much he loved being put in his place by harry.
“harry,” he whispers, his voice weak and trembling but still echoing in the otherwise empty room. “my harry,”
he knows that he’s being dramatic. he could’ve moved in with any one of his friends, or bought another apartment or home somewhere in london. but, as he had lain in their bed alone, he had realized that the centaur had only been half-right in his advice. time had passed - it had been almost nine months since harry’s death, and draco still found himself waking some mornings and reaching across the bed for harry - only to be severely disappointed when his hand instead brushed a cool, empty pillow. distance would help him heal. and then, when he finally felt like himself again, he could come back to london and give this life another go.
harry continued to apologize profusely, rubbing draco’s body and pressing gentle kisses to his temple again and again.
“pansy,” draco started, completely skipping all polite greetings. “i have a problem.”
harry grinned and laughed, an awful, fake laugh that made draco cringe. it was too loud and neat, nothing like harry’s real barking laughter that always made him clutch at his sides and blink back tears.” couldn’t have been more than twenty years,” he said with a wink. draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “ now, about spumc… i myself was one of the first supporters -”
“what’s going on?” ron asked, gathering the attention of a few of the healers on the outer fringes. “where’s harry?”
, he realizes belatedly, flicking hurriedly at his own tears. “how could you say that, harry?” he asks quietly, “i’ve stayed. all this time. i was here, and it was
“hello?” he asked, trying (and failing) to keep the annoyance out of his voice.
“not at all,” draco had muttered. and then he had cast a cleaning charm over his mouth and potter’s shoes and leaned in to kiss him again.
“i’m fine,” draco said, standing. his vision doubled, and he lurched as he lost his balance. “nevermind,” he sunk down into his seat again, brushing off the worrying hands of both jackson and hermione.
“draco, this is achilles,” harry grinned, finally pulling the puppy from beneath his jacket. he was small, with a gorgeous golden coat and floppy ears. “he’s a golden retriever!”
“i thought the getting drunk was to not talk about relationships” blaise groaned from the floor, where he was lying facedown. “god, draco, don’t you have any hobbies?”
sometimes, draco would wake up and find the old harry beside him - his eyes clear and bright, a stark contrast to the dark and stormy green they always seemed to be lately. he would smile, and laugh, and press kisses to draco’s cheeks, nose, and neck. they would twirl through the house, wrapped around each other and singing loudly in between brief kisses.
draco smiles appreciatively and stands, hugging his items close to his chest. he looks sad, so sad, and it breaks harry’s heart. he holds out a hand for draco to take, and he does.
“so not all the way then,” harry rolled his eyes, turning away and carefully folding his discarded clothing.
“i know, draco,” harry says, laughing. “i love you too.”
and now, they were trekking over a rocky hill, with harry looking determined and draco whining petulantly.
“no,” draco moaned, still standing in the doorway. “no, no, please, no,”
“good, then?” draco asked, already knowing the answer. he closed his book and put it aside and shifted his position so that he could lean his head on harry’s shoulder while still sipping at his own drink.
“oh, draco, darling,” she says as the connection establishes, and then they fall into conversation as easily as they had all those years ago, back at hogwarts.
for a moment, draco actually feels guilty. weasley will likely never speak to potter again - he’s broken his sister's heart and violated the unspoken gryffindor code of conduct, all in one night. worse still, it was a slytherin - no, it was draco that he chose to fuck around with. if it had been neville longbottom, or one of the patil twins, ron might’ve punched harry and ignored him for a few days, before all would be well again.
“i thought i told you not to tell me what to do,” draco sneers. his lip curls, and harry looks away. he knows he looks every inch the malfoy scion that had haunted the halls of hogwarts years ago. “fuck you, potter.” a dry laugh forces its way from draco, humorless and painful. “fuck you so much,” he says in an undertone, watching potter. “finally been taken down a fucking peg, have you? now you’ll have to slum it like the rest of us.”
with each breath, his lungs rattle, close to giving out but holding on just so that he can spend just a bit more time with the people who care for him. they seem to be staring down at him, waiting for him to say something else, perhaps make a speech about the fleeting nature of life, or the welcoming embrace of death - but he doesn’t have it in him.
“it’s the twenty-first century,” she says lowly, pouring herself another glass. “when will people learn to respect others' sexualities and relationships?”
the next night, they pass through the floo to malfoy manor - draco, with his face set in a grim, determined line. harry, supportive and equally determined, followed close behind him.
“love you,” harry murmurs into draco’s hair. “love you so much.”
“i don’t want anyone else, ever,” draco murmurs, already sounding as if he’s succumbing to sleep. “just you. only you.”
. she sobs and shakes visibly as she casts, but draco can still feel the strength of her magic going up around the house, warding it to the gills. this helps him to relax marginally, but he can still faintly feel the press of harry’s fist around his throat.
he wraps his arms around draco and pulls him close, and kisses him like it’s his sole purpose in life. his tongue presses into draco’s mouth, small whimpers escaping his lips every few moments. their bodies slot together like kismet, every one of draco's sharp edges fitting perfectly with harry’s deep canyons. draco feels like he’s dying, or taking his first breath of air. he can’t remember a time before this, before he did anything other than roll around on his duvet and snog potter. he doesn’t want to remember frankly - there’s nothing more important than this, than the press of their bodies together, than potter’s fingers and lips and knees and elbows everywhere, surrounding draco, pulling him in, finally, pulling him from the ledge that he had been balancing precariously on for so long.
“harry,” he whispers, although it comes out sounding more like a squeak. he doesn’t move - doesn’t do anything but blink up at his lover, drinking in the sight of him once again. “my love. i missed you.”
they had argued up until the very moment that the air around the can began to swirl, at which point harry wrapped an arm around a squirming draco’s waist and promptly vanished them to god-knows-where.
“mmm,” theo hummed, standing up from the table again. he dropped harry’s robes on the ground and draco cringed. “tell us more sex stories. that was fun.”
“yes, draco?” harry looks over at him, raising an eyebrow.
he checked the garden next - he had, on more than one occasion,  found harry lying in the soft grass, surrounded by the flowers and with his face towards the sun, letting it warm his skin. the first time draco had found him this way, with his eyes closed and his body eerily still, he had panicked and dropped to his knees, feeling a lump in his throat grow and grief set into his bones as he grasped at harry’s body. the panic had lasted for a mere second, and then harry had opened one eye and cocked an eyebrow and made draco feel very, very stupid.
“of course not, you arsehole! i don’t want him to break up with me! i fucking love him! i want to spend the rest of my bloody life with him!” he spat. at any other time, draco would’ve been embarrassed by his show of vulnerability, but all of his sensible emotions were overridden by his frustration at zabini. more and more, draco found himself wishing that pansy had come alone.
, and draco’s eyes flutter shut as his soul promptly evacuates his body. harry’s lips are surprisingly pillow soft against draco’s, and he tastes overwhelmingly of peppermint. his strong hands come up to pull draco closer, until he effectively straddles harry’s lap, their chests pressed flush to each other. he whimpers into the kiss, and then feels terribly embarrassed about it, and then harry cups his face delicate and he does it again.
“on a lighter note; like i said, i’ve moved to new york. been here for a little under a year now. i work in a bookstore, and i’ve been making friends. slowly, but i am. i’ve met a few wizards, but i haven’t really started doing magic again. i haven’t been back to london, either, since - yeah. but i try to talk to everyone at least once a month. ron and hermione are doing okay. they miss you, terribly. they don’t say it, but i can tell. i suppose they’d say the same about me. but, as i was saying, ‘mione is pregnant! she should be due sometime next august. they’re ecstatic. i think ron was made to be a dad.
“i think we should get a pet.” harry said, grinning to soften the impact.
, you -“
“hmmm,” harry is quiet for a long while, before sitting up a bit, propping himself up with an elbow. “well… i want to do something with kids. i want to help, as much as possible. maybe become a professor at hogwarts. i could probably teach dada. or even open an orphanage... i’ve got more than enough money.”
and then, the image distorts, and harry disappears as draco is swept away in a flash of green flame.
“luna,” draco says softly, exhaling shakily. he wants to say more, wants to tell her that he loves her and appreciates her positivity, steadfast and constant even up until the last moment, but his breath escapes him as talking and breathing become more difficult.
even now, more than six years later, draco still flinches when andrew raises his voice in an argument, or while on the phone with his colleagues. he knows that andrew wouldn’t dare hurt him - but harry had instilled a fear in draco so deep that he feared he would never be able to have a truly healthy relationship.
draco worries his lip for a moment, breathing deeply and looking away from his friends. they stare at him, attentive.
but harry will do what he can.
up close, the cottage was even more beautiful. it was small and white, with vines growing over the walls and ceiling. harry placed his palm over the door, which creaked open before them. inside, the decor was white and airy - blue and grey furniture, worn by design or through use littered throughout the living room. the kitchen was small, but with the same updated muggle appliances that harry quite liked to use often.
“i don’t really know why,” draco continues. “maybe as a reminder… or a wish. part of me always hoped you would come. that we could talk. that i could tell you -”
harry potter. my name carries a significant amount of weight in most social circles - more than yours does nowadays, at any rate. i know a few people over at the prophet and the quibbler… classmates, friends. i have a feeling that it’ll be up to myself and draco to pick the headline announcing your death. i’m thinking ‘
he had expected as much. when they had been exploring possible marriage bonds, they had encountered many different kinds of bonds for a variety of relationships and situations. the one they had selected had been described as a unification of souls - much like their vaults at gringotts, their magic would pool together in a sort of reservoir, and allow them to draw from each other when necessary. overtime, they would only become stronger. however, the bond needed time to mature in order to reach its full potential. it would take nearly a year for them to begin actually growing stronger. when draco had done more research, he had learned that if they nurtured their bond enough, there was even a possibility of creating a channel between them that would allow them to communicate nonverbally.
“oh, of course,” harry whispered, his eyes rolling back into hi head as draco’s long fingers found his bun. he pulled the elastic out and looped it around his own wrist, before tangling his fingers in harry’s hair, massaging his scalp gently. harry moans softly as draco works his hands over his scalp, shivers running down his spine. “merlin, you have magical hands, draco. i love you.”
draco doesn’t realize that he’s started crying until he feels the tears splash against his open palms in his lap. “harry,” he chokes, suddenly throwing all caution to the wind. “harry,
the warmth that had once flown through him every time he held it was long gone. now, he felt a bit silly, brandishing the practically useless piece of wood. he knew that if he tried - if he reached down far enough into himself that he would probably be able to muster the power to cast a small spell - maybe a
when they had gotten bored of stacking the lube bottles in pyramids, they return to the couch, arranging themselves in a tangle reminiscent of their days in the slytherin common room. when blaise pulls out a small baggie of gillyweed, they cheer happily. after more than a few attempts at rolling a presentable joint - draco lights it with the tip of his wand.
“yes,” pansy says slowly, as if he’s gone mad. “what’s wrong with peppermints?”
“how dare you!” draco shrieked, his finger itching towards his wand. “harry james potter, i swear to merlin if you bring a dog home, i’m leaving. i will pack my bags and you will never see me again. i promise you that much.”
hermione nods jerkily, but doesn’t release her grip on draco. harry notices this and a small crease appears in his forehead - his anger threatening to break through the careful mask he’s put on for hermione’s sake. it scares draco - surely harry wouldn’t dare hurt his friend… right?
as they pass over the crest of the hill, a slight gasp of surprise leaves draco’s lips. there, nestled in a private cove, was a small cottage. he ran down the rest of the way - keeping pace with harry up until the front door.
as he holds the scrap of paper, draco finds himself wishing desperately that, just for once, harry
so if he occasionally cried over a bowl of cereal on his couch before puking it up an hour later, he was bloody allowed to.
harry obeyed, taking a sip. almost instantaneously, his shoulders relaxed and he sat back into the couch, sighing contentedly. he took a few more deep pulls from the mug before pulling it away - whipped cream and cinnamon caught on the hairs of his mustache. before draco could say something, he reached up and wiped it away with a finger and stuck it into his mouth, moaning softly around the digit.
“and what do you keep me around for?” harry asked, tilting his head as draco continued to press kisses down the line of his jaw. “aside from my facial hair and wandless cleaning charms.”
understanding passes over harry, and he nods.
hermione was sat in her office, reading diligently through paperwork and dictating to her quick quotes quill. the minister for magic sign on her door gleamed, and carvings of a witch, wizard, house elf, and other magical creatures greeted him with a wave.
“absolutely not!” draco stood from the couch, affronted. “i was raised in a manor, not a barn, potter. pets are simply unacceptable. merlin knows why you would want some filthy mongrel wandering around your house - tracking dirt and shit all over the place. it’s bad enough you always forget to spell the bottom of your shoes clean after you come inside - how can you expect to keep a clean home with an animal running about? have you gone mad?”
“well,” harry said, sitting beside draco on the bed. he began to fumble with the clip of his chain, slowed by his own alcohol consumption. “you’re wasted. i’m not having sex with you while you’re drunk.”
much smaller than he thought it would be, than it had sounded in harry’s descriptions. he reaches down and yanks it open, peering inside.
harry returned a few moments later, clutching a steaming mug and smiling warmly.
draco roars, shoving harry away and drawing his wand. his voice trembles, but his wand hand remains steady and trained on his father.
draco sighed contently as he relaxed into his lounge chair, savoring the last sip of his drink. harry had scampered off some time ago, and draco had since curled into his own chair and pulled his floppy hat over his eyes. the consistent crashing of the waves, paired with the warm embrace of the sun were quickly lulling him to sleep, and he didn’t bother fighting it.
“get back, lucy,” draco laughs softly as she runs through his legs. “if you trip me, i’ll eat you!” he’s still grinning down at her as he yanks open the door, using one foot to keep her from running out. “
a soft gasp left his lips as he stared at the owl - and harry opened one eye.
potter was, for lack of a better word,
, or even a weak
harry pulled at draco’s pants as he whimpered, stripping him naked and crawling up to straddle him. he pushed their foreheads together, brushing draco’s lips with his own as grey eyes meet green.
this is what draco struggled with the most. he couldn’t understand why harry would continue doing something that he knew was bad for him, why he would risk ruining everything, his friendships, his relationship, his reputation - for a short high. he couldn’t understand it - and, frankly, didn’t want to.
“stop it, malfoy.” harry snaps, snatching the glass from his hands and slamming it down. the drink had been luna’s before being abandoned - the sparkly blue liquid sloshed over the sides and spilled across the tabletop. “just fucking stop it.”
, and harry was doing a surprisingly good job at selling it.
“i messed up. i know i did.” harry’s voice is gentle and apologetic and draco wants to do something stupid like reach across the table and hold his hand. “i fucked up, and i lost you because i was too blind to realize what i was giving up,  too much of a coward to try and go for what i really wanted.”
“the house-elves like her quite a bit more now that she’s stopped trying to free them and instead focuses on their quality of life,” harry responds. it had taken hermione a while to understand some of the intricacies of wizarding culture, such as the existence of house-elves. of course, the abuse that they experience, mostly at the hands of wealthy purebloods, was inexcusable and immoral. what she hadn’t realized was that many families treated their house-elves with respect and fair treatment, or that house-elves required a human or ancestral home to tether their magic and life force to. upon learning this, she had reshaped her passion for equality to focus on the just treatment of all creatures. thus, the society for the protection of underprivileged magical creatures or, alternatively,
harry pulls away first, although he stays close, pressing his forehead to draco’s and staring into his eyes, their breath mingling together in the tiny space between them.
harry cleans them up, vanishing the sweat and come and fluids from their bodies and finally pulling out of draco with a soft squelch. draco still seems dazed - harry knows that his sharp edges will be back in the next few minutes - but for now he enjoys the soft, overly affectionate version of draco.
“oh,” she said, stumbling backwards. “oh, no - harry,”
when draco malfoy showed up on pansy parkinson’s doorstep, drunk and in tears, she didn’t ask any questions. instead, she simply ushered him in, biting back the thousands of questions that were playing on her mind. it wasn’t as if he would be able to coherently answer anything she asked him, anyways - he was rapidly oscillating between deep, gulping sobs, and taking swigs from the bottle of firewhiskey that he had produced seemingly out of nowhere.
“andrew,” draco says shakily, staring at the hand stretched out beside him. ”this is harry.”
they arrived in front of number four fairly quickly, and harry hesitated on the street before the house. draco took charge now, half leading and half pulling harry up the park before either could lose their nerve. or rather, harry would take the moral high ground and guilt draco into returning home with him to drink warm mugs of tea and pretend that they had never thought of this - had never tried to go through with it.
“i do,” draco says softly.
well enough to still want to spend their lives together. his hands tremble as he pulls the box open, equal parts dreading what he knows is inside and needing it desperately. as it flips open, a small piece of paper flutters out and floats delicately to the ground. draco places the ring on the counter and bends, grabbing the paper between two fingers and exhaling as he flips it around. there, in harry’s messy and cramped handwriting, are the words -
but harry was gone, and draco had been transformed into nothing but an unfinished sentence, in one fell swoop.
as draco’s words register, a crestfallen expression passes over his face. his mouth contorts into a grim frown, so disappointed, so angry, so
“are you doing alright?” harry would ask when he would come home from work, bending over draco wherever he was, either in their bed or on the sofa or (one time) on the floor. he would push a strand of hair behind draco’s ear and gently trace his jaw, tipping his chin up for a slow kiss. he would nod most days, but had also, once or twice, shaken his head no and moved aside for harry to climb beneath the sheets with him. harry would hold him, pressing his face into the nape of draco’s neck and inhaling deeply.
“of course, pans,” draco says softly, grinning. “i’ll stay vigilant.”
“draco,” harry said again. his tone was soft, and it made draco look up from his pants. “did i do something wrong?”
he stopped attending his weekly therapy sessions - a fact that he neglected to mention to draco. they had been relaxing on the couch together during a rare moment of rest when the mindhealer had called their home. draco had bounced to the phone, eager for any opportunity to practice with the muggle mechanisms.
pretend like this is okay,
privately, draco felt that there was no other way to describe the intimacy of the moment. after four years together, they had long fallen out of their early habit of having sex nearly every day. once or twice a week, they would reach for each other. the sex was good and consistent and enjoyable for both parties.
“i’ve been thinking about getting one of those muggle telephone devices... many of the older families have started using them. i’ve heard great things from celeste zabini.” narcissa sniffed into draco’s shoulder. he marvels silently at the idea of his mother attempting to use a cell phone - but appreciates the sentiment nonetheless.
they enter the lift, and draco pressed the button for hermione’s floor, before leaning against the railing and closing his eyes. his head is pounding, and he could feel his magic thrashing uncomfortably in his stomach. harry liked to compare draco’s magic to a dragon - powerful, fierce, and calm unless trifled with.
“i can’t,” he cries weakly into ron’s chest, after finally being pulled away from harry and ushered towards the door. “i can’t -”
“i’m sorry, draco,” he says again. “we don’t have to have a relationship or anything like that. i just wanted you to know that i’ve changed. i’m not that person anymore - who hurt you.”
“i am,” draco whispered. “this entire house is covered in memories of him. of us. the garden, the kitchen, the loo -” draco pauses to inhale shakily, his hands trembling in his lap. if ron and hermione notice his fragility, they don’t mention it. “our bed... i can’t do it anymore, i need to be away from this.”
“peppermint,” potter said again, holding it out to draco. draco stood stock still, glancing between potter’s outstretched hand and his face, with that broad grin still spread across his lips. this position so closely mimicked the one they had stood in all those years ago, except this time it was potter extending his hand to draco, the one offering friendship, or at the very least a truce. “do you want it or not?”
this morning, pansy had dragged him out of bed, expressing that she needed his help picking out new dress robes from some high eng store in diagon alley. they both knew that she was simply worried about him, seeing as he hadn’t left his bed in almost three days, and had adopted a sickly pallor.
he slept in pansy’s bed with her for another month, before she had begun urging him politely to begin looking for other arrangements - ones that included a steady job and his own place to stay.
“harry,” draco said, his voice thick with sleep. “harry, what’s wrong, baby?”
for a few moments, he allows himself to sob loudly, his chest heaving and his entire body shaking like a lead with the force of his grief. and then, he rights himself - drying his cheeks with the back of his hand and laughing at himself. if harry were here he’d poke fun at him while simultanously wrapping his arms around draco to comfort him.
,” draco whispers - and the car bursts into flames.
today, he grieves the loss of his mother and the last of his childhood pre-emptively.
and then, things had changed.
this confession had been closely followed by heart wrenching revelations concerning harry’s remaining family and his upbringing - but the singular beacon of light throughout the conversation had been the portrayal of hogwarts as harry’s saving grace. it was there that he had met his best friends, and formed both his best and worst memories. it was there that his life had truly begun.
“right, then.” he turned on his heel and caught draco’s eye again, that familiar affectionate look immediately softening his features. he reached out and took draco’s hand, lacing their fingers together, before pulling him from the room without another glance behind him.
“i don’t want anyone else,” draco cried, sounding a bit petulant, although pansy supposed that he was allowed to do so in the moment.  “i love
draco falls asleep that night, tucked beneath harry potter's arm. he sleeps better than he has in years, soothed by the presence of harry - the constant warmth of his body. he sleeps with a small smile on his lips - unusual, but understandable. here, now, in his little cottage, so far removed from all he once knew and held dear - draco thinks that he has a real chance at happiness.
harry’s cock. lost in the sensation, harry buried his hands in draco’s hair - whimpering all the while.
when harry finally found his glasses - in the guest bedroom closet, tucked into a pair of his bedroom slippers (
they’re like this when the floo roars, spitting out granger, who’s already rambling about something or the other. she freezes as she notices the scene before her, her eyes bulging as she takes in harry’s fist at draco’s throat, and draco’s red, tear stained face, his expression - more sad and resigned rather than scared, and the wand pressed to his forehead, and -
“having fun, are you?” draco asked, pulling away from harry’s cock once more. “it’s not there for you to just stare at.”
for a moment, neither of them move. then, draco’s hand snakes up to harry’s shoulder and over his neck, burying itself in harry’s scalp. in response, harry’s eyes roll back into his head, a low moan escaping his throat.
“he’s not getting away with this,” draco snapped, although it’s intensity was lost with the force of his cry. “he won’t.”
“they’re for harry!” he shouts, his voice breaking on his name and dissolving into a sob. “he, he loved them, and i carried them for him
“i love you, too,” harry laughs softly, and draco relaxes into his arms, sighing contently.
instead, draco has a scrap of paper and an empty bed and an engagement ring with no fiance. there is no one to propose, to drop to their knees and make grandiose declarations of love.
“you,” he said honestly, blushing after the fact. “i mean, you look really good. you’re fit.”
“harry?” draco’s voice is soft and affectionate now, nothing like the cruel, sickly sweet tone he had used with the dursleys. he places a gentle hand on harry’s back, feeling the tension melt away beneath his touch. “are you okay, love?”
“suppose it’s just you and me then,” harry murmured, squatting to ruffle achilles fur. in response, achilles yipped happily.
harry bit his lip in an effort to swallow his mirth. draco’s face was red and he was pointing his finger at harry accusingly. it was a bit reminiscent of the beginning of their relationship, when they had been all pointed edges and kisses full of teeth and blood.
“that’s a good point.” draco said, nodding as if he hadn’t been telling himself this the entire time. “i’m the perfect partner. i’m beautiful, and smart, and difficult enough to challenge him without him completely giving up on me. also, i give what is arguably the best head in the world.”
“i love you.”
he hated feeling this way. they had been together for two years, and not once had draco ever questioned harry’s loyalty. it had taken just one dream - one tiny snippet, to unearth all of the insecurities he had managed to push deep down.
“that you do,”
“oh my god, if we have sex will you stop talking?” harry interrupted draco, throwing his arms up in exasperation.
“you call your cat bitch?” harry laughs, watching as she strolls from the room leisurely, her tail flicking back and forth slowly. draco will have to ply her with treats later to apologize for this slight.
“it should be,” blaise murmured, “if it makes you act like this.”
“thank you,” he whispers again, running another gentle finger over the tattoo - over the permanent representation of harry, right at his side. just as he should be. the tattoo cannot hold him tight, or stroke his hair, or press gentle kisses to his neck in the pale light of an early morning - but draco can still close his eyes and press his hand to his side and pretend as if it does. and for now, until he can finally be reunited with his love - it will simply have to do.
“all mine,” draco whispers, the humiliating words tumbling out before he can stop them.
he’s angry, so angry with himself and with harry. he shouldn’t be able to get through the wards - shouldn’t know how to unlock draco’s door. these are small, intimate gestures, reserved only for those closest to an individual. a wizards’ home is practically an extension of themselves - it’s the place where a person is most vulnerable. giving someone uninhibited access to your home is on par with a serious relationship, or marriage in pureblood culture.
- but he knows that these things are neither true, nor will they matter. he cannot promise draco a life full of happiness and devoid of loss, despite how much he would like to. he can kiss, and hold, and comfort draco as much as he’d like, but his touch will never be the same as that of narcissa.
he ends the call with a click - sending the message flying off to harry’s phone. It’s somewhere in draco’s closet - buried in a bag and purposely tucked away. tomorrow, he’ll call the service provider and shut the line off  - severing one of his last connections to harry.
“draco, that’s what i thought about theo! and we all know how that story ended.” draco winced. since theo had broken her heart nearly five years ago, pansy hadn’t really recovered, and had instead began entertaining a constant stream of failed relationships. “as of now, i’ve been cheated on three times. i know that you and harry are happy, but i’m just saying to keep your eyes open. never get too comfortable.” he could hardly fault her for her cynicism. pansy had been hurt, and was jaded towards men. she simply hadn’t met her harry yet, and was trying to look out for a friend.
“can you come to st. mungo’s?” she asked breathily. immediately, draco’s heart began to race and his throat grew tight. “it’s harry.”
“what would you do without me?” draco hummed quietly, tossing the tie onto their bed.
draco nodded jerkily, but didn’t move from his spot. suddenly, his feet feel impossibly heavy. the idea of going into the hospital room and seeing harry - or rather, not seeing him, makes draco feel nauseous. he doesn’t want to think about how many times he could’ve said something but didn’t - or how many red flags he might’ve missed.
“come and find me,” draco says softly, placing a tentative hand on harry's shaking shoulder. he looks up at him, with wide green eyes, and draco’s breath quickly evacuates his body. “when you’re done.”
“yes,” draco says, finally mustering up the courage to look at harry. “i wrote that the morning after, once i had finally finished throwing up, of course.”
“are you still upset?” draco asked quietly, cringing at how pathetic he sounds as it comes out of his mouth.
“nothing,” draco snapped, irritated at harry’s assumption. harry fixed him with a blank stare, his forehead creasing as he silently told draco that he didn’t believe a word that he had just said. “my head is throbbing,” he admitted after a moment. “and i’ve sold all of my potions, and i don’t feel well enough to brew any.”
“harry,” draco breathed, his eyes darting around as he took everything in. “it’’s… this is perfect,”
emblazoned across the front and a worn pair of muggle denims. he looks comfortable, and at peace, and draco has missed him so much that it physically pains him.
“draco?” hermione asked, “what are you doing?”
“yes,” draco said, his voice small. he looked down at the ground like a scolded child, although he glanced at harry out of the corner of his eye. a small smile spread across his lips.
“hey minnie,” he said quietly, scratching lightly at her head. “guess who got approved?”
“I’d like alcohol too.” blaise added, standing from the table and wandering into the kitchen. he returned a moment later with a bottle of firewhiskey and a sultry grin on his face. “remember when we did fun things, like get sloshed and have group sex and not discuss our feelings for gryffindors?”
draco extends his wand once more, his arm long, straight, and steady. harry watches him - he looks elegant, regal, every inch the pureblood scion that he is,
he doesn’t want to love harry - doesn’t want to be attracted to or to feel something for the man who had almost killed him so many times. harry had claimed to love draco, but had looked him in the eyes and purposefully inflicted as much damage as he could - hitting and punching and bending and breaking, just because he
harry took a breath and steeled himself, instantly schooling his face into a cool, authoritative mask. he pulled away from draco completely now, his fingers lingering on his waist for a split second before harry returned to the head of the table. he looked exponentially better than he had when draco had first arrived. now, he stood up straight and walked slowly before the aurors, speaking firmly as he finished relaying the details of his mission.
he could hear harry waking up slowly, the shuffling of blankets and pillows as he slowly reached full consciousness. the sound of his hands, rough from years of auror work, rubbing across his face, and the subsequent yawn. the charm turned off, and draco heard a flop as harry dropped onto his back, staring at the ceiling.
“to being in committed, faithful relationships” pansy said. she raised her hand, her ring finger sparkling in the light. to this day, draco still isn’t sure how neville managed to wrangle her. nonetheless, draco raised his glass.
harry nods, and draco turns back around, his well-practiced sneer settling back into place.
“malfoy,” harry says, rough and cruel. he's glaring at draco now, as if they’re back at hogwarts and ready to kill each other.
nonetheless, draco felt himself prepared to snap at harry at any given moment, despite knowing that doing so would ruin the positive mood of the day. the last thing he needed was a full-blown argument with harry. those always lasted hours and usually ended in hexes being thrown and doors being slammed.
and it was there that his life had ended.
“i’m ready,” harry murmurs, running another hand through his wild hair. as usual, his efforts were futile, and the curls sprang right back up, falling over his forehead and hanging in his eyes.
pansy breaks away from the group first, her eyes already watering. “oh, draco, i’ll miss you terribly! i’ll come to visit you in new york as soon as i can,” as per usual, pansy is dramatic and demands attention - several muggles turn to peer at her as she throws her arms around draco’s neck, crying loudly. nonetheless, draco appreciates his oldest friend, and wraps his arms around her waist as she sobs into his shoulder.
he liked them and now he - he’s fucking dead and all i have are these fucking stupid peppermints in all of my fucking robes and i
draco couldn’t recall having ever felt this happy, this full of euphoria ever in his life. just thinking about potter made his stomach flutter and his lips spread into a manic grin.
instead, he knotted his hands in a small clump of wildflowers inside harry’s ring, ripping them from the ground with a furious yank. when the sight of newly upturned earth and frayed roots didn’t soothe him, he tried again, yanking up a different patch of grass and weeds. again and again, he tore at the ground until his fingernails were dark with dirt and his forehead beaded with sweat.
as he shovels random articles of clothing into a bag, his vision blurred by tears, draco thinks. he thinks of the fear that had wrapped tight around him last night, suffocating him and holding him frozen in place when he had pushed their bedroom door open and taken in the sight of harry, slumped over and strung out. his experiences with the dementors of azkaban had been limited - he had only visited his father a handful of times while he had been imprisoned - yet draco was familiar with the all-encompassing coldness and despair that had filled him as he had walked down that chilly hallway to lucius’ holding cell. that same sick feeling of emptiness had gripped him last night, knocking the air from his lungs and almost sending him to his knees. draco had stopped visiting his father once his mother had stopped mandating it. and now, draco was making the same decision once more. he couldn’t,
except, harry can’t hurt hermione. she’s a powerful witch, she’s his friend, and she’s not his to hurt. besides, the only person he hates enough to do what he does is draco. he knows that if he refuses, she’ll be suspicious. and so he nods and smiles tightly, shooting draco a look that very clearly means,
he’s ready for this - has been since the day he lost harry, but especially now that he’s lived a long life, full of more triumphs and failures and heartbreak. he’s not afraid of whatever will come next, because, if his wishes are correct, he’ll be able to do it all with harry at his side.
draco doesn’t respond - instead, he flinches backwards and hangs his head, obviously overcome with emotion. unwilling to resist the temptation anymore, harry moved forward to place a gentle hand on the small of his back, glaring at lucius over his shoulder. lucius stares back at him, a terrible smirk on his face.
“oh,” harry says, raising an eyebrow and looking cautious, as if draco was a crazy person. “are you feeling okay, draco?”
tears flood his eyes before he can even pull out the box, already knowing what it is, and what it means.
harry snorts, and draco smiles faintly. he hadn’t had more than a glass of wine since that night - afraid of what being under the influence might reveal of him.
and thus their affair began - groping and grabbing and snogging each other in the seedy bathrooms of the joints they frequented. potter always sought draco out, a familiar glint in his eye that meant that draco had better cast a breath freshening charm because 1) they had both had quite a few drinks, and because 2) potter was about to shove his tongue down draco’s throat, and bad breath was unhygienic and rude.
with that, he quickly turns on his heel and disappears through the double french doors, and into the garden.
“okay then,” she says slowly, turning to face harry. she still looks worried, but does a decent job of masking her blatant fear. “harry, why don’t you go make us some tea, and then we can have a long talk about ways to properly handle our anger.”
the knock sounds from the front door just as draco prepares to descend the stairs into his lab. he freezes, furrowing his eyebrows. any wizard would have simply used the floo, and harry didn’t have any muggle neighbors who might’ve come knocking. he strides to the door quickly, not bothering to peek out of the window as he pulls it open. standing there on the porch, looking distinctly out of place, was kingsley shacklebolt and gawain robards, their mouths pressed into identical grim lines.
he wants potter to leave - to fuck off and allow him to feel all of this terrible anguish so that he can move on with his life and try to put himself back together. he wants potter to feel pain - to experience exactly what it is that he’s doing to draco. he wants him to die. because he hates harry potter. he regrets ever meeting him, ever saying a word to him, ever starting to actually like him, ever fucking him, and ever handing over his heart for potter to keep safe.
“draco!” he calls, turning around. when he spots draco already leaning over the rail, he grins, opening his arms wide to him. “come here!” his excitement is palpable, and reminds draco a bit of an excited crup, or a giggling baby. draco rushes down the steps to the beach, his smile stretching impossibly wide. affection swells in his chest, warm and familiar.
as the smattering of orange and yellow fades to a darker shade, and then eventually black, draco stares blankly ahead. he smokes until the joint fizzles out, and then throws it into the ashtray. the slight buzz from the marijuana dulls the pain a bit, but not enough to quell his tears. draco leans forward in his seat, burying his face in his hands.
“that’s a lie!” draco shouted, already losing his composure. he stalked forward, slamming his palms on the surface of lucius’ oversized wooden desk. “you killed my mother - your wife! how could you?”
“you said… you said you loved me,” draco cries, faintly aware of how pathetic he sounds but not caring very much. “you just said it. you love me, but you choose her - you’re marrying her…you didn’t even tell me. you didn’t say anything! you just showed up with her and that fucking ring!” he moves back now, still close but able to truly look into harry’s eyes. he manages to calm his sobs for a moment, sniffling furiously but mostly intact. “why would you do that? how could you do this to me?”
ron nodded absently, although his eyes were trained on harry’s body. hermione dialed the number to harry and draco’s home phone with trembling fingers and blurry eyes.
“it’s their thing,” pansy provided. “after they’ve gone at it, harry always kisses draco on his neck.”
“draco,” harry says softly, but his voice carries. draco turns around, forcing himself to stay calm. he knows he must look crazed, and that his magic is crackling around him wildly. harry’s voice serves as an anchor, grounding him and reminding him to remain in control.
“harry,” she says, her lips curling into a slight frown as she says his name. she suddenly seems far away - and sad. and then, like it never happened, she’s back. “it’s for him, right? the lily flowers, for his mother of course. and narcissus for yours. i just don’t understand -”
of the trio, ron had, as expected, taken the longest to warm to draco. he had approached hermione first, full of apologies and remorse and speeches about making up for the past without making excuses for it - with pursed lips and an intimidating glare, she had bought him into the fold, pushing him into a seat beside her in the pub and pointedly telling harry and ron that he would be drinking with them and that it was “
draco immediately sat up, turning to hermione. “what charm was that? i feel so much better already.”
and now, potter was standing beside draco, trying to make small talk. wonders never ceased. draco turned to look at him, arching an eyebrow and donning a polite smile. it simply wouldn’t do to spar with potter tonight, whether that be verbally or physically.
“you’re married?” harry asks immediately, looking down at draco’s hand. his eyes trace the modest ring on his finger, simple but sturdy.
“okay,” draco whispers, stroking harry’s wild hair. “that’s okay, harry. i'm sorry.”
there was harry, wearing his red auror robes and looking absolutely kissable. all of draco’s prior negative thoughts melted away as he stared up at harry, wanting him,
“that’s what you always say,” draco murmured against harry’s lips, his fingers toying with the hair at the nape of harry’s neck. “you’re always wrong.”
he hears the darkness slip beneath the crack of the bathroom door - a loud, gnashing sound like two bunches of wire wool being dragged across each other. it fills the bathroom, flooding the floor and crawling up the walls like vines. the light in the bathroom reduces dramatically as the darkness slips into the shower. draco watches as it approaches him, rushing towards him and then stopping right at his pointed big toe.
harry shrugs and leans the rest of the way in, catching draco’s lips in a sweet kiss. it is, as all of their kisses tend to be, earth shattering. for a few long moments, the rest of the world disappears, and it is only them, in this car, pressed together over the console. draco places his palm on harry’s cheek gently, lapping at his bottom lip in an effort to increase the pressure - but their bubble shatters as belligerent spluttering sounds from the backseat. vernon, having seemingly recovered from shock, was practically purple in the face with rage and disgust.
“g'night, draco,” harry had murmured, and then had disappeared through draco’s floo.
“i just want to talk to draco,” harry says earnestly. he looks over andrew’s shoulder, catching draco’s eye - green meets grey, and draco feels his heart begin to pound in his chest, the same way it had all those years ago, when harry had first approached him, when he had began to fall in love. it had been those very same eyes that had pulled him in, kind and bright and alluring. he remembers he way those eyes had looked after each kiss, when harry would stroke his cheek lightly, when they would hold hands, when harry would grab draco, when he would squeezes his wrist, being shoved, being slapped, being choked -
- luna had played a surprisingly large part in the organization of hermione’s initiative, and was apparently very intelligent when she wasn’t discussing things of questionable existence. ginny was here as her date, as were ron and draco. it had been harry’s heavily broadcasted push for magical creature equality, under hermione’s guidance, that had started his political career and legitimized
she immediately doubles over, wrapping her arms around a wheezing draco and entangling their fingers, her grip on his waist so severe that it makes him wince. she’s afraid, that much is obvious in her shaking voice and fingers. draco’s not sure if she fears for her own life or for his, and the thought makes him want to cry again.
after more than a few drinks and some time spent leaning heavily into lovegood, listening to her blather on about a theory that each of the founders of hogwarts were secretly animagi, potter and ginevra stand up, grinning stupidly and clutching each other.
“bugger,” he murmured to himself, standing and wiping his hands on his trousers. his stomach grumbled loudly, and draco remembered that he hadn’t eaten since breakfast. as he made his way into the kitchen, he began to muse over what to prepare. perhaps a steak and kidney pie - one of harry’s favorites.
he wonders if he can just stay here forever, in this cold room with this body that looks like but doesn’t act like his harry, clutching it until he dies and can go to wherever harry has gone. there is nothing for him outside of this room anyway, nothing he cares about more than harry. he would give it all up - the house and the career and the friends and the money - to bring harry back, would live like a pauper and sleep in dark alleys if it meant that he could have harry potter by his side again.
“you haven’t,” draco whispered, his voice as small as he feels. a tear escapes his eye and he quickly wipes it away, looking away from harry.
as with ginny, harry doesn’t respond. he does however, look down at his lap, his fingers curling and uncurling menacingly. hermione gasps wetly and stands as well, her chair dragging equally loudly against the floor. she hurries away, her head down and her steps quick. ron follows her, but not before shooting harry, a truly murderous glare.
from his spot in the middle of the booth, neville glances over at pansy worriedly. although she seems to be significantly better at holding her alcohol than draco, she still has had more drinks than anyone else.
a few of the aurors giggled at that, but harry quickly fixed the room with a glare that silenced everyone.
he stares down at the sweater. it’s a faded burgundy color, with a haphazard snitch emblazoned across the front. the neck and sleeves are stretched and frayed, and there are small holes in the armpits and near the hem. harry had worn this sweater the first time they had ran into each other again - all those years ago. it had quickly become a shared piece of clothing - and they had frequently fought over who would get to wear it. slipping it on felt like a hug - and draco was sure that if he dared to pull it over his head he would instantly dissolve into a blubbering mess.
“can we stop with the pissing match and focus?” pansy groaned, “so, you had this dream last night. what did you say to harry this morning?”
pans, i can’t -”
on their very first night together, draco and pansy had curled in her bed, drinking wine and catching up on their last few years. when he tells her about harry, she pulls him into her arms and doesn’t let go for a very long time. she curses his name, muttering about how she should’ve actually given him up to the dark lord, or should’ve killed him herself when given the opportunity. draco lets her rant, grateful to finally have a friend staunchly on his side, to have someone be openly incensed about harry.
with that, ron picked rose up onto his hip, taking hermione’s hand with his own free one. when they arrived to harry’s floor, hermione pulled him towards the room. the crowd of healers had only grown, yet they still made no noise. an older wizard, wearing white robes instead of lime-green, pushed past the group and into the room, a quiet murmur running through the crowd.
“i think it would make you feel better to talk about it,” she says one morning, folding her hands in front of her on the table. draco had come down from his room for a mug of tea and a slice of toast, but was quickly regretting it. it wasn’t as if he didn’t talk to granger and weasley at all - the topic of conversation just usually revolved around asinine and mundane things, like the weather or a book draco was reading, not about the methods their best friend and draco’s husband had used to beat the shit out of him. “do you think so?”
despite their own grief, his friends seemed to have developed some sort of coalition dedicated solely to making sure that draco didn’t drown in his own sorrow. neville, after dropping by a few weeks ago to find all of draco’s plants dried up and dead, had returned with a small pot of lavender and pushed it into draco’s hands gently, murmuring something about giving him something to look after, and lavender not needing much care. hermione has taken to coming through the floo unannounced almost every other day, and sits with him on the couch and eyes the old sweater that had once belonged to harry that draco had taken to wearing almost constantly. she says things that he knows she read from some psychology textbook about the stages of grief and biopsychosocial influences of grief-fueled depression. when he does encounter ron, he claps him on the back a bit too roughly and smiles awkwardly, always hesitating as if he wants to say something, but is unsure of what. luna always hugs him - long and hard, pressing her face into his neck and matching her breaths to his heartbeat. the method is unusual but has effectively reduced him to tears twice without a single word being uttered between them. blaise, theo, and greg drop by at least once a week, clutching bags full of takeout and cases of beer and bottles of wine. they don’t talk much, but the company is a welcome distraction from the otherwise suffocating silence of the house.
their clothes come off slowly, first, harry’s shirt, if only so that draco can feel the warmth of his skin - can reacquaint himself with the ever-burning inferno that seems to exist beneath potter’s skin. and then draco’s shirt, shucked off so that harry can rub gentle patterns into his back as they kiss, a heart, and a star, and spirals, and circles, but mostly hearts, over and over and over again. harry's pants go as draco kisses down his torso, desperate to mark, to touch every part of harry that he can - from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. his own pants go not too long after that, although in a decidedly less sexy way - he stands to kick them off, shaking with nerves and want, and trips over the leg of his own pants. harry laughs - loud and warm, before sliding down the bed and helping draco to peel off his trousers, pressing gentle kisses to draco’s thin calves as he does. and then they’re naked, and draco can hardly breathe.
hermione looked up then, a curious smile on her face. the bond had always been a point of interest for her, and she never gave up an opportunity to discuss it at length. the magical theory and mechanics behind it seemed to fascinate her - and draco didn’t very much mind being her guinea pig, as long as she consistently allowed him to hide from his on responsibilities in her office.
“thank you, all,” he whispers, his voice hoarse and weak. he can feel his body beginning to give out completely, and inhales shakily as he attempts to gather enough strength to finish his thought. “for loving me. i -” he trails off, a sudden dampness gathering in his eyes. he’s too weak to blink them away, so they fall. “i love you.” it’s specific, but he sees as it passes over each and every person in the room. and then, they’re all talking over each other, as disorganized and chaotic as always, making jokes and crying and touching him. he drinks it in, their love and affection and care, and savors it as his eyes flutter shut for the last time.
“you have no proof,” lucius said wickedly, leaning forward in his seat, as if to taunt draco. “no evidence that i ever raised my wand against narcissa.”
“dead,” hermione whispered. “one of the healers told me they think it was suicide - i tried to tell them it didn’t make sense but - he… i just don’t understand,”
“i fucking hate peppermint,” he gasps, dropping it to the ground as if suddenly realizing that it is hot to the touch. “i hate peppermint so much - it’s not even
having mercy on draco, harry trails a finger from the inside of draco’s thigh - all the way up until they brush against the length of his erect cock. his body reacts immediately - his back arching and a low his escaping his lips. harry wraps his fingers around draco’s cock loosely, but it’s more than enough. he snaps his hips forward and reaches down - closing his hand around harry’s and beginning to fuck into their joined hands.
draco turns to harry slowly, his face hardening as his pleasant tipsy haze fades rapidly.
he gasped appropriately, and pansy continued.
“i’ve written a song for us, would you like to hear it?”
as harry half-drags him from the table, draco cranes his neck backward, shouting to their friends, “i’m not going to bed. i’m going to have unnecessary sex with my boyfriend. ta ta!”
“anything,” harry said lowly, his lips pressed to draco’s neck.
nevertheless, draco clutches the body in the bed. he wraps his arms around it and buries his face in its chest, sobbing so loudly he fears that the aurors outside will come in and drag him away, claiming to be doing so for his own well-being. he kisses the body, on its palms, its shoulder, its neck, on its lips, and forehead, and on that damn scar.
“the dick deputy,” theo cackled.
- he glanced down at his ring, simple and elegant and everything he could ever hope for. harry caught him looking and reached over, squeezing his hand for a short moment before pulling away and joining in on the applause for hermione, who was beaming as she moved back towards their table.
he doesn’t know how many drinks he had last night, or how many terribly embarrassing things he might’ve whispered on the floor of his foyer.
“maybe i should measure how much is inside,” he said, more to himself than anything. “just to be sure.”
draco took the peppermint, trying to keep his hand from trembling as he did so.
“it’s going to be okay, draco,” she whispered, her voice trembling. somehow, despite the tremor in her voice, draco found himself wanting desperately to believe her. he clung to her even as she tried to pull away, grabbing her sweater in tight fists and burying his face in her soft stomach, like a child and their mother.
“what happened?” hermione asked, her voice already thick with emotion. “what was he doing at hogwarts?”
“it was one time,” goyle murmured.
. when i was young she would plant a different color each season. oranges, and reds, and whites, and yellows… she would never tell me which she was going to do. it would be my favorite surprise, waiting to see which color would spring up that year.”
“maybe slow down with the drinks, malfoy,” harry says offhandedly, glancing over at draco while mid conversation with ron and neville.
the air has become chillier, and draco suddenly wants nothing more than to curl beneath his sheets and sleep, with the familiar weight of briseis at his feet. he stands, draining the last of his glass and pocketing his cell phone and wand. as he walks, briseis winds between his legs, her soft fur tickling his ankles. she slips through the glass door first, and draco turns to close it behind him - shutting the door on the city, the noise, and his pain, if only temporarily.
“like a fish, or something?” draco finally asked, his voice sounding comically strangled. in his lap, his hands were squeezing the throw blanket that covered him - his knuckles stark white. his eyes had widened - and he looked a bit deranged. on the other side of the couch, harry scooted a bit closer to the arm, smiling nervously.
draco watches him as he leaves, his shoulders tense and his fists balled menacingly at his side. anger practically radiates off of him, paralyzing draco. he doesn’t want to think about what will happen after this distraction is over - after harry manages to charm granger back through the floo with smiles and promises to do the breathing exercises she was always peddling. he’ll turn to draco, the smile melting off of his face like butter, and throw him to the floor, maybe kicking him in the stomach until he pukes. maybe he’ll step on draco’s ankle and snap it again, before healing it incorrectly. or worse, he’ll do nothing at all, let draco think that hermione’s lessons worked. and then, in the middle of the night, he would drag draco from the bed, shouting and landing punch after punch everywhere he could reach. he wants to turn to granger and tell her to run, to leave before she can make things worse.
“you’ll be missing them by next week,” harry laughed, wrapping his hand around draco’s ankle and squeezing lightly.
the second the floo roared, draco emerged from his study. he ate breakfast alone, not tasting his slice of toast as he forced himself to swallow. one part of draco, the rational and sensible part, reminded him that he was being petulant, and that it had just been a dream. the other part of draco, which was currently dictating his actions, simply reminded him of the way harry’s hands had run over the twinks -
the fire is a slow burn, crackling with tension and growing hotter and wilder as each moment passes. harry watches with slightly parted lips as the flames grow, emanating heat in waves even from across the street. a heavy, acrid scent pours from the car, burning their nostrils. the sounds of glass shattering and plastic crackling rips loudly through the air, and thick spirals of smoke curl into the sky in a lazy spiral.
“well, we haven’t been able to contact anyone yet, mr.potter’s only just been admitted -”
with that, harry swung his legs off of the couch and left the room without another word.
“the anal administratior,” pansy chimed.
when draco came, he buried his face in harry’s neck - loud sobs racking his body. still trapped between them, his cock spilled over both of their fronts, staining their shirts and dracos thighs. harry came soon after - sent over by the sensation of draco’s hole pulsing around him as he came down from his own orgasm. he came deep inside of draco, filing his hole with a mixture of his come and lube.
“don’t you ever worry about this kind of stuff?” pansy asked, sounding just a bit petulant. “harry cheating on you… or finding someone else? what with him being the darling of the wizarding world and all that - i can’t imagine how much attention he must get... how do you handle that?”
“draco,” she cried, pulling away from ron. “we have to tell draco - he doesn’t know,”
“mione, what’s going on?” she rarely called them, and instead preferred to pop through the floo when she needed something.
“harry,” draco says drowsily, his eyes already slipping shut as sleep pulls him over. “stay,”
draco supposed
he bought his knife down again, continuing to slice angrily at the roots. as another tear fell, draco’s vision blurred, and his hand slipped, causing him to nick his thumb.
- and a tattered jumper that definitely belonged to andrew at one point, as they stand in the kitchen together, carefully dipping strawberries into a bowl of melted chocolate so that they can enjoy them together during the movie. draco pushes a toothpick into a particularly plump strawberry and hands it to him just as the sound of the door knocking fills their home.
“harry,” he whispered, tears streaming from his eyes and dripping from his chin onto the pristine sheet. “harry, please, don’t go,”
“she’s right you know.” draco says, staring hard at harry. “leading a war so young… it’s not normal. you should find someone to talk to. it’d be good for you.”
he sleeps on their couch, covered with a warm blanket that molly had knit them a few years ago. he watches rose as she crawls around their living room and holds her to his chest when she seems to have exhausted ron and hermione with her crying. he spends a large majority of his time drifting between sleep and wakefulness, yet is unable to escape the exhaustion that weighs on his shoulders.
pansy allowed draco a few more moments of drama, during which he buried his face in the fabric of her robes and horribly ruined them with tears and snot and other unthinkable fluids. then, she gently pried him off and forced him to look her in the eyes. she cupped his face with her hands, peering into his damp, bloodshot eyes and frowning. overall, this draco looked completely divorced from the polished and stoic draco that she was used to, with his tear-stained cheeks and puffy lips and a red nose.
for a long moment, they’re both silent. draco breathes shallowly, allowing harry’s words to wash over him. emotion swells in his chest - a result of a strange flood of hormones post-orgasm, and his response to harry’s sweet, sweet words. he longed to respond - to be able to pull himself together and make harry feel the same way he did, the way that he always felt in this relationship.
“that’s nice, dear” said a considerably less drunk pansy, patting draco’s hair maternally. “do you feel better now?”
“mmm,” draco mutters, already lying back down. over the three years of their relationship, harry had been called on two other midnight raids before. he had always returned sometime during the afternoon, in need of a bath and a warm cup of tea. “be safe,”
- and genuine, blazing smiles. harry gives a speech as well, although draco hardly listens, his leg bouncing with anticipation and his fingers drumming impatiently atop the table. at some point, pansy and the rest of harry’s auror detail materialize behind him, waiting patiently for the okay to leave. when harry finally reappears at draco’s side, they make short work of saying their goodbyes. draco and ron share a cordial nod, while he and harry hug and pat each other on the back as if they won’t see each other as soon as next week for drinks at the hog's head. hermione and luna give them both kisses on both cheeks, while a subtly intoxicated ginny grins dopily.
“maybe you should take it with you,” hermione said quietly, sitting cross-legged on their bed. draco had sank to the ground, with his nose pressed deeply into the fabric. “something to remember him by.”
” hurt, more so than anger, colors draco’s words as they leave his mouth. he knows that, to harry, he is acting selfishly and abandoning him, and the very idea makes draco’s stomach turn.
there were a great many things that harry did not understand about the wizarding world, like  where food came from when it was summoned, why the money system was so bloody confusing, where things went when they were banished. he didn’t understand why wizards insisted on wearing horribly old-fashioned robes, even in the dead of summer, and why there wasn’t some sort of support system for muggle-borns being integrated into wizarding culture.
“i don’t bloody well know, what’s it to -”
he tries desperately to remember what the last thing he had said to harry was, if he had told him that he loved him, that he didn’t want to exist in a world without him, that even being apart for a day was too much to bear, that he didn’t know how to continue going on knowing that harry’s race had already ended.
the next morning, he woke to an empty bed.
“harry potter, if you even touch that broom you wont have to worry about the
“yes,” draco murmurs, pulling harry into a kiss. he holds harry’s face, delicately, pressing gentle kisses across his forehead, nose, cheeks, and eyes. “so good, harry.”
- bringing more freaks into my home. i ought to - ”
it happens on movie night.
it had been about a month prior - harry had requested that draco meet him in some large field, miles away from everything else. there, he had pulled draco onto a broom  with him, with harry steering and draco clutching his torso, his face buried in the crook of harry’s neck. it had been so reminiscent of the first and last time he had been on a broom with harry - fiendfyre licking at the soles of their shoes and terror gripping both of them. this was different in every possible way. harry flew slowly at first, talking gently to draco all the while as he flew them over the countryside. eventually, draco had been able to open his eyes and enjoy the view, and stop chewing on his lip long enough to actually hold a conversation with potter. he had kept his nose buried in harry’s shoulder, though, savouring his scent, and the way that it felt like home.
“no! no, i would never! this is just… it’s just a fear of mine. i don’t want to lose him.” he bit out, ignoring the flush rising in his neck. “and i’m afraid of him finding someone better than me.”
harry was going to propose, and he had been hiding the ring in a box filled with peppermint tea bags, knowing that draco would never look in there. he had specifically chosen this spot because he knew of draco’s general dislike for peppermint, and knew his mannerisms, and knew
harry doesn’t move. doesn’t speak. doesn’t even acknowledge the conversation happening around him. he simply sits there, staring at draco, hating everything about him.
they land at the very end of privet drive with a quiet pop, their fingers still laced together.
he’s baring his soul to harry, and the idea of it terrifies him.
the cellphone slipped from his fingers - crashing to the ground and shattering into a thousand tiny pieces.
“harry!” she shouts, rushing forward and shoving him away from draco. draco doubles over, attempting to catch his breath in deep, heart wrenching sobs. “harry, what are you doing?”
why was he sitting on harry’s doorstep? surely he wasn’t going to…
harry comes back later that night, at nearly one in the morning. draco is sat on the couch, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders and his face set in a grim line. for the last few hours, he had fumed silently, preparing a dressing down for harry the second he crossed the threshold.
his eyes didn't flutter open - bottle green and full of life. his pink, plump lips didn’t part to release a laugh, or to frame his perfect, white smile. he remained cold, and stiff.
harry pastes on a smile that he knows falls flat and waves quickly as he stands still for a moment, allowing the applause to quiet a bit before he begins his descent. draco maintains his sparkling grin, all the while leaning close and murmuring through his teeth, “why’ve they always got to put your bloody name first? you can’t possibly be that important,” harry’s false smile makes way for a real one as he chortles quietly at draco’s quip, squeezing draco’s hand tightly just as they reach the foot of the stairs. for just a moment, they remain close together, before draco pulls away with a quiet sigh.
“harry,” draco says, his voice breaking. he looks up at harry, who still refuses to meet his eyes. “harry.”
it had taken a long time for draco to get used to the idea of andrew genuinely wanting him, and not to simply use as a punching bag. he had been heavily urged on by pansy and hermione, who encouraged the idea of draco
“look, malfoy. i don’t want anything with you. i just made a suggestion.”
him,” hermione sobbed. “his body... he - i… he’s gone. harry’s gone.”
there’s a silence, and he takes it as the green light to continue.
“will you tell me where we’re going now?” draco asked, looking around impatiently.
vernon and dudley nod stupidly, their identical faces stricken with fear, while petunia looks over at harry imploringly.
“you,
as they swept away from the couple, the enchanted counter at the top of the steps increased by another twenty thousand galleons - draco whistled lowly under his breath.
draco had distanced himself from the group, understanding that he wouldn’t be welcomed back after his stunt. the other slytherin’s had continued to go, and had updated draco on the awkwardness of it all. granger and both weasley’s had simply stopped showing up, as had lavender and hannah and the patil’s. longbottom and lovegood seemed to have avoiding taking sides, while thomas and finnegan seemed to be in support of potter, citing feeling sympathetic towards him for having to hide his apparent homosexuality. nobody spoke about draco, or ginny, or anything negative. draco's outburst and potter’s infidelity had, apparently, been grouped with the war and the hogwarts-era bullying under the category of things not to be spoken about at pub nights. things had been awkward at first, but a few rounds in had them all forgetting about what had occurred at other nights like those.
and then, finally - they’re free.
“you ought to nothing,” draco sneers, storming forward and snatching the blankets off of petunia and vernon. “you rotund waste of space - get out of the fucking bed,
“are you ready to go, harry?” pansy asked politely. this would be the last bit of friendliness between them for the remainder of the night. in front of her subordinates, harry was minister, and there would be no casual conversation between the two.
“it’s a peppermint,” he chokes, finally looking up at pansy. his face crumbles as he gestures with his cupped palm. “it’s - this is a peppermint,”
“oh, don’t tell me you didn’t all know,” draco says, looking around at each of them. “you heard it here first, i suppose. the savior, boy wonder himself, is bent. gets on his knees quite a bit too. that one was a bit of a surprise for me, i have to say. when potter propositioned me, i expected to be manhandled and pampered… imagine my shock when potter wants me to bend him over and -”
harry’s lips found draco’s neck at some point, pulling his loose sweater down over his shoulder and giving harry full access to the smooth skin there. he bit down lightly as draco fucked himseld on his cock - suddenly more focused on chasing his own orgasm. with each movement of his hips, harry’s cock was brushing his prostate - and he could feel the familiar pressure building in his stomach and balls that told him he wouldn’t last long.
“we should go,” draco murmured, his fingers brushing at the neck of harry’s robes. “not a good look for the minister to be late,”
while she tattoo’s draco, luna hums softly to herself - a song completely different from the one playing on the speakers throughout the shop. draco remains quiet as she works, only occasionally humming softly when she asks if he’s feeling okay, or if he’s in any pain, or if he’s spoken with any “humans” with tails recently.
when he finished his breakfast, he made easy work of finishing up the household chores. he charmed the dishes to do themselves, and polished the floors and carpets with a swipe of his wand - but decided to fold the laundry by hand. the charms always left terrible wrinkles in his clothes that seemed to be heavily resistant to ironing charms. once he had finished, and magicked the piles of clothing into their respective wardrobes, he set about watering all of their plants.
when draco is finally able to turn back to harry, he finds himself staring into harry’s eyes - silver meeting green, just like they have thousands of times before. but now, harry’s eyes are different. harry’s pupils are pinprick small, revealing almost the entirety of his iris. the green of harry’s eyes have always been draco’s favorite. the color is brilliant and jarring and never fails to fill draco’s stomach with a herd of butterflies. he would cover the world with that particular shade and be satisfied. it’s a color that he could never tire of, and will always want to wrap himself in. now, draco despises the color. it makes him cringe, makes him feel sick to his stomach, makes him want to turn and run screaming from this home and to never return. he hates it, and doesn’t ever want to see it again if
lucius stills as draco stops, gasping for breath and glaring over at both of them, the disgust and hatred clear on his face.
“as you know and loathe,” harry continues, leaning over lucius and dropping his voice to a whisper. “i
“yes,” he says instead, his voice hoarse, like it always is after a good strangling. “we got caught up in our anger.” he stands upright and pulls his hand from hermione’s, doing his best to look as if he’s not shaking like a leaf.
“hey there, stranger,” he says quietly, a smile spreading across his soft pink lips. years have passed, and it feels as if there have been lifetimes since draco had last kissed harry, but he still remembers clearly how it feels to have those lips ghost across his own. harry holds out his hand, soft and smooth and holding something. draco doesn’t have to move his eyes from harry’s face and glance down at his hand to know what he’s holding, what he’s offering to draco.
“harry potter was in great pain when he came into our forest. my brothers and i made to warn him - but even we could feel his sorrow as he found rest. there was nothing to be done, except to bring him as much peace as we could in the moment,” the centaur gestured to the mostly trampled patch, and a flood of guilt pulled draco under.
when he can no longer delude himself, draco pulls away and gently lies harry in bed, resting his head on his pillow and throwing a blanket over his body, so that he looks almost as if he is simply asleep.
draco swallows and moves a bit closer to harry, their fingers brushing in the small space between them.
“fuck you,” draco whimpers, looking up at harry through blurred eyes. “i hate you so much. so so much.”
he could hear harry moving behind him - and could feel his eyes on draco’s more private areas. it’s a testament to their relationship that draco doesn’t feel embarrassed or nervous about finding himself in such a prone position - rather, he feels more aroused than ever, and anxiously anticipates harry’s next movements.
“long neck on this one,” draco mutters, glancing over at harry. he pantomimes choking her, and for the first time all evening, harry laughs. it dies quickly when he looks over at dudley, who seems to be frozen in shock.
potter was rooting through his robe pockets, patting at his chest and thighs before seemingly finding what he was looking for. he pulled out a small peppermint candy, encased in a clear plastic wrapper.
when he has has all of the dursleys in a line, whimpering and clutching each other, draco forces them down the steps, pushing them not-quite-delicately. they pause at the front door as harry disappears into the kitchen, before reappearing with a pair of keys on his finger. he tosses them to draco seamlessly as draco turns to address the muggles.
as he stepped from the lift, draco caught sight of ron and hermione. they stood at the end of the hallway - well, ron stood, rocking rosie in his arms while hermione sat on a chair, her head in her hands. he could hear her sobs as he stepped closer, and each cry made his heart clench more. ron also seemed to be in tears, although it was a lot more discreet. baby rose seemed blissfully oblivious to it all.
“yes. i do.”
“i’m sure you were, baby,” draco cooed, squeezing harry’s thigh gently. he leaned forward, grabbing harry’s mug and pushing it into his hand. the whipped cream had already begun melting into a lump. “drink.”
dead.
“petunia,” he says sweetly, tipping her chin up with the end of his wand. “is there anything you’d like to say to harry?”
but he will have to.
this didn’t strike draco as unusual - harry often woke before him and was out of the house before draco could throw the covers off of himself. he continued on as normal, making breakfast for himself and eating it at their small dining room table, his eyes scanning the prophet as he absently wondered where harry had gotten to.
this time, the power had been in harry’s hands completely.
draco sobs, over and over again,
“draco,” pansy says softly from beside him. her sharp nails dig into his thigh beneath the table. she’s the only one at this table who knows everything - who is fully aware of the fact that she is about to watch something terrible happen. draco pushes her hand away and shifts in his seat, angling his body towards potter. he crosses his ankles and sits up straight, knowing that he looks completely and totally punchable right now.
finally, after nearly three hours, she pulls away, smiling happily.
from there, the night wraps up quickly, which draco is grateful for. hermione gives another speech, this one short and gratifying - chock-full of phrases like “
“it’s okay not to be okay, you know,” harry said around a mouthful of food.
harry flicks his wand and lucius rises into the air, his body hanging limply. a part of harry wants to play with lucius, to toss him about the room and perhaps smack him into some furniture - but harry hadn’t been joking. draco would need his comfort tonight - it wouldn’t do to spend hours teasing lucius. he sets him onto the bed and checks that he’s immobilised - strengthening the spells just in case, before hopping onto the bed himself, crawling over lucius and straddling him.
“do you think you can duel me, boy?” lucius goads, finishing off his drink and rising from his seat slowly, also drawing his wand. “and win? i guess you’ve taken more than one thing from potter… this gryffindorian recklessness. you’ll soon realize that not everyone has the same astronomical luck as your
“i mean like… ginny weasley,”
“has healing qualities?” draco finished, leaning forward to press his lips to harry’s. “i did know that, actually.”
“fine,” he wheezes into harry’s neck, his warm breath ghosting across harry’s skin. “i’m fine.”
as they kiss, one of draco’s hands trail down harry’s body - rubbing gentle patters on his hips and torso. as his fingers find harry’s once again erect cock, they wrap delicately around him - immediately beginning to stroke slowly. harry groans softly into draco’s mouth, thrusting shallowly into his fist, his eyes fluttering shut with pleasure.
“oh, harry -” he pants, his entire body practically vibrating. he wants to pull harry close again, to kiss him again and again until he makes up for each cold night spent alone on his side of the bed. draco stares up at harry, and harry avoids his eyes.
“i’ve done a fair bit of research on this, i hope you don’t mind if i ramble a bit. you won’t die immediately - it’ll take about five to six minutes for you to actually start dying, but every moment before that will be spent in excruciating pain and panic. i won’t be undoing your spells, either, so you won’t be able to move or speak, or really do much of anything at all. every part of your body will be on fire - starting with your throat and your chest, and then eventually spreading to each limb. the lack of oxygen in your brain might cause a seizure, coma, unconsciousness, along with a handful of other side-effects, but, you musn’t worry about any of that. so, i think this is what we’ll be going with today. the last thing you’ll see, other than my wonderful mug, of course, will be the white of your thousand thread count pillowcases. bit sad, isn’t it?
as she entered the room with ron and rose, she took a deep breath, attempting to calm herself. as soon as ron looked up at her, he saw through it.
“draco,” harry sobs, loudly and horrifically. “draco,
harry doesn’t look at ginny. he stares directly at draco, and if looks could kill, draco would be dead. his jaw jumps and his hands curl and the vein in his neck pops out. he's angry - so angry that his magic is jumping and popping around him, making the air crackle with electricity. draco watches him, absently wishing that he had savored the last time they had fucked. he's never going to come back from this - that much is true. he takes a sip from his drink, partly for confidence and partly for dramatic effect.
“not important,” he breathes, pulling harry down onto the bed with him. they bounce a bit and roll, but draco keeps his arm around harry's waist, close to him. “kiss me,”
“harry,” draco whispers, his voice shaking only a bit. “what... why are you telling me all of this? why are you here?”
when he stops crying enough to effectively communicate with the aurors, they express their sincerest condolences, again and again, making comments about how harry was such an asset to their team, and how they truly mourn the loss of such a powerful wizard. draco wants to sneer and tell them to go fuck themselves, that he’s trying to figure out how to navigate life without his partner while they will simply fill harry’s spot with some wet-behind-the-ears junior auror, but he bites his tongue.
lucius simply cocked an eyebrow and stared over at them with general disgust.
“draco,” harry murmurs, his head dropping in pleasure. his eyes screw shut as his thrusts become more erratic - obviously approaching his second orgasm of the night. “‘m close,”
stand here and listen to harry accuse him of every doing anything other than loving him wholeheartedly. “please, just stop,”
when the darkness would inevitably return, draco would hold on to these memories with a vice-like grip. every time harry would pull away from his touch, or disappear for hours on end, or be caught staring out the window, unseeing -- he would think about the stroke of harry’s thumb against his jaw, or the press of his lips to draco’s temple.
he realizes that something is amiss as soon as he picks up the tin - almost triple the weight of what it should be even when completely full. he pulls it out slowly, his brow furrowing as he does so. when he gives the box a shake, he hears the loud thud of something inside, something that definitely isn’t a tea bag, and so he pulls the lid off, suddenly overwhelmingly curious.
“harry potter,” draco spat, his voice thick with virtriol. “harry fucking potter is what is wrong. with me, with the world, with everything.”
“i’m sorry, i lost track of time.” he apologized, avoiding their eyes.
“shut up, blaise,” goyle said, turning back to draco with large, attentive eyes. “go on, malfoy.”
finally, draco gives in to his inner impulsive gryffindor, rushing over to his stores and picking out everything he needs.
it’s a bit ironic that she caught him with harry’s fist around his throat, draco thinks. harry didn’t often strangle him, but it had been the method that he had used the first time he had ever lain a finger on draco. but he knows hermione, her tenacity, can feel the strength of the wards going up around him right now. he won’t see harry again. not if she has something to say about it.
“i can’t believe they - you lived in there…. there’s hardly any space -” he scrambles for words but finds them hard to reach.
“hi harry,” goyle said as he lumbered past. harry shot him a tight smile. “bye, malfoy. bye, harry.”
“oh?” harry raised an eyebrow. usually, days spent with narcissa were thick with tension and silence - actual conversation was a rare treat. she was often quiet and contemplative, and seemed to think very heavily before she said anything, as if afraid of saying the wrong thing. “is that bad?”
gives your case a second glance. you will die irrelevant, and be quickly forgotten, just as you should be. i’ll make sure that people know narcissa’s name, and that you killed her, and then yourself a week later out of guilt. but not before pledging a few million galleons to muggle-born charities. to atone for some of your sins, i think,” harry laughs to himself lightly, reveling in the genuine panic in lucius’ eyes. “maybe
draco pat her arm, smiling tightly and swallowing down the lump in his throat.
“yes, i am.” draco says, sitting up as well. their stance is familiar - a throwback to their hogwarts days. “he’s wonderful, as a matter of fact. he helps me alot with my anxiety attacks and nightmares.”
”. draco would go into his arms easily, laughing and crying and absolutely thrilled to be by harry’s side again. they would sit together beneath the tree until it was dark and cold, and then they would go home together, hand in hand.
“you doing okay?” he asked, sitting across from draco and looking over at him. draco looked exhausted - his shoulders were tense with stress and his eyes lacked their familiar brightness.
miles below him, the sounds of new york city filled the air - faint honking, sirens, and shouting that seemed to never cease. he stares out at the skyline, admiring the view for the thousandth time. he’s seen it every single day since his move to new york, and still found himself breathless at the sight.
when draco had finally caught his breath, he had turned to his side to stare over at harry. he was an attractive man - especially in the years since hogwarts, when he had thrown himself into quidditch training and exercise. but here, in the moonlight, he looked downright angelic. there was a subtle spattering of freckles on his cheeks and across the bridge of his nose. they were nearly the same color of his skin, and could only be truly seen if one stood (or laid) very, very closely. his lips were full, pink, and plump - draco had spent many long moments with his own pressed against them, lapping at harry’s mouth hungrily.
“his hair smells nice. you wouldn’t think so, because it looks like a birds nest, but it smells like… fruits, and vanilla, and fresh cleaning charms. and pretty much every nice thing in the world. i think he’s the best thing in the entire world,” draco gulped deeply, feeling a new onslaught of tears. “he’s very kind. he likes to feed the ducks and also he lets me put my feet on him when they’re cold even though he hates it. he also eats my arse on occasion. it’s very polite of him.”
draco stood at the sink, manually cracking eggs into a bowl, while harry had leaned heavily onto the counter and tried not to fall back asleep. draco hummed to himself softly as he vanished the egg shells until something outside of the window caught his eye. he squinted as the owl came closer, his eyebrows furrowed curiously. draco opened the window just as the large bird came to a rest on the sill, blinking patiently at them. its body was covered in black and grey feathers, and it’s beak was a bright yellow.
