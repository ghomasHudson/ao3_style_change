‘This must have taken years to set up,’ Harry grunted, shaking a dart loose from the heavily spelled knee of his jeans. And being really bloody grateful it hadn’t gotten any closer to his balls – even if the spells covered all the fabric of his jeans, he didn’t like the thought of what that dart might do.
It might have been ridiculous but after a good few gentle strokes around what Draco supposed one could consider its muzzle, the trap opened wide, releasing his foot and a rusty substance that Draco tried very hard not to call drool. Stepping very carefully out of the things mouth Draco cast a marker to hover over the thing and he and Harry took careful steps away.
‘We love you far too much to leave you in Azkaban, Draco Malfoy,’ Luna declared, throwing her arms around his middle and attempting to squeeze the life out of him. ‘Oh, I think I’m drunk.’
With his eyes closed, Harry couldn’t see Draco’s face as he scrunched his nose and his mouth twisted. It
Harry rolled his eyes, but again, couldn’t help agreeing. He crawled back onto the bed, hovering over Draco so he could place soft teasing kisses across his chest, up the smooth pale column of his throat and along the rough side of his jaw before capturing his lips.
Harry snorted at the underhanded move but didn’t question why Andromeda would be the one presenting the proposal before the Wizengamot. ‘How many votes does that guarantee you?’ he asked.
Intrigued, Draco sat up a little, dislodging Harry so that he could turn and get a better look at the runes which were clearly still painted against Harry’s neck. Although, upon closer inspection, they were no longer red and glistening. Instead they’d become a soft earthy brown, just a few shades darker than Harry’s own tanned skin. Even as he watched, they faded until it was as though they’d never been there. Stroking them with soft fingers didn’t bring them back.
It was her father who had published the photo in an article about putting the war behind them and making positive steps to rebuild what was lost (“see above the wonderful balance of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Slytherin, in a true show of setting aside the rivalries that characterised the war”).
The look that came over Ron then was startlingly vulnerable. ‘What if she realises I’m not good enough for her?’ His voice was soft, nervous – Harry might have called it scared. ‘What if we do this and then she realises she can do better and we can’t go back?’
Hermione rolled her eyes at the lot of them but took the plastic container Harry handed her with a smile. ‘Oh, this smells amazing,’ she moaned appreciatively, cracking the lid to peek inside.
Harry nodded. He wished he’d been there. Wished he’d been there to curse those idiots right back. He wished he’d been the one to sit by Draco’s bedside. He knew Luna wouldn’t let anyone hurt Draco, she’d told him she’d sat awake for almost the whole night with him, but still, Harry should have been there.
He’d never had to
‘She’s Kate,’ he told Harry, ‘She’s seven but she doesn’t like talking to strangers.’
And he could. It was strange, stepping back out onto the street and then inside the muggle off license knowing that he knew what he was looking for and even how to go about paying with the strange muggle money. And it was also strange to think that now that he knew how it all worked that he actually preferred muggle money. It was so much easier carrying around a few folded pieces of paper than a heavy bag of gold. You had to spell a bag of galleons not to ruin the line of an outfit, but you could jam a few “pounds” into the pocket of a pair of jeans and be done with it.
When Draco had set out to reclaim some of Harry’s past for him, he’d had no idea what he would find. He’d gotten on Pansy’s last nerve dragging her through every bit of parchment he could find in their vaults and he’d even dragged her to the ruins of the house in Godric’s Hollow. He’d expected to put together a family tree, small anecdotes taken from history books or older witches and wizards who had known the Potters. He’d expected to find paperwork about their arrival in Britain, intermarrying with the Peverell family and all about the tradition of wayward hair and the creation of the best-selling hair potion on the market.
Harry winces but Ginny’s glare wilts almost immediately.
Hermione nodded. She wiped her eyes, requested Harry not kill Weasley and then swept out of the room. Draco could have left it at that, he could have followed after her without a single word of explanation but if Harry continued to fight with Weasley and make things worse, then he would regret it and while old Draco would have taken great pleasure in widening the rift between the two, the Draco who had been through a war and was tired of it all (and loved Harry) thought it best to say something explanatory before he left.
He felt his anger and annoyance deflate and he sighed tiredly. ‘Sorry,’ he told her, scrubbing a hand over his face.
By the time he realised that Voldemort didn’t care about blood, only power, he’d already lost his faith and one more thing against Voldemort barely registered.
Of course, Draco knew what happened to Harry when he was near dementors. She’d had him wondering if anyone else knew, truly knew, what it was like now that the piece of Voldemort’s soul wasn’t living in Harry. If they knew what it was like now, after he’d died.
Pansy shrugged. ‘I got over it once I got old enough to really understand pureblood society.’
Harry nodded and fled, Ron’s shouts following him out of the room as he snarled harsh words at Harry’s retreating back. He bumped into Hannah on the stairs who took one look at his face and her own crumpled.
It was, Draco had come to discover, surprisingly hard to make a surprised “huh” sound in Parseltongue but he thought Harry grasped what the sound he issued was meant to be. ‘That, I was not expecting.’
‘Give me back my wand, Death Eater!’ the midgety fourth year demanded.
‘Yes, yes, I played a part in that,’ Draco acknowledged. ‘This is the first year we’ve had a Defence teacher actually qualified to teach and I don’t know if he’s going to last – the only students here who don’t have more firsthand experience with Dark Arts than Joseph are the first years.’
So far, they hadn’t noticed any shared magical talents, but Draco couldn’t help but wonder if they would notice. He suspected the changes would come so naturally to the both of them that it would take someone observing to notice. And that would be dependent on who was paying close enough attention to notice and whether they’d pick up on the significance of what they were seeing.
It was why the relief he felt when they reached the gargoyle and found Katarina Winthrop and old Abe Mendenhall waiting for them had him almost wilting. Winthrop was young but competent, she’d come through training with Tonks and although she’d never been part of Dumbledore’s Order, she was one of the good ones. She always treated him fairly, being of the belief that he’d done his time and that someone like Harry Potter wouldn’t have spoken up for him if he wasn’t somewhat deserving of a second chance.
Definitely not if Harry was finally ready to have the
Robards was definitely concerned. Harry had come to know the gruff head Auror well enough in the last five months to read that into what he was saying. He felt a little bad for all the shouting he’d done but not bad enough to go so far as to apologise – it had needed to be said.
Harry squeezed him. ‘I’m sorry I never noticed you were broken.’
They’d talked about it before, without this kind of certainty, and without ever really saying the words. Draco thought it was something Harry had started to consider over the summer when his life didn’t stop just because Hermione and Weasley were on the other side of the world, but not something he’d really stopped to think about until now when he was faced with a future without his childhood best friend.
He didn’t.
He’d spent so much time trying to make the Ministry better. So much time working with Kingsley and Robards, even Arthur and Percy, to try and cleanse the Ministry of the corruption Voldemort had only
Harry looked back to Draco to find him looking at him. When he saw he had Harry’s attention he beckoned him over. Harry shared a glance with Bill, shrugged, and went to find out what Draco wanted.
‘It’s a stupid subject,’ Draco put in. ‘I’ve seen some of the homework Harry handed in for top marks, it was ridiculous.’
‘He had to write it all out, but he finally just told me I was being stupid to believe you’d really changed, and that Harry was an idiot for thinking you wanted him for anything other than a way to fix your reputation.’
The Ministry’s head curse breaker did not look surprised, merely resigned. ‘How much can you sweep in a single spell?’
‘It may have escaped your notice, all these years, but I am an excellent student.’
Hermione looked horrified, even Ron looked taken aback, possibly by the anger in Harry’s voice as he didn’t expect him to be concerned for Draco. Neither of them even knew just how bad it could get, but Harry was sure that was something else Draco didn’t want getting out. He didn’t like it, hated it even, that the Ministry could use him in such a way, but Draco still felt so guilty. He still had so much he wanted to make up for and he saw this as one opportunity to help erase some of the darkness Voldemort had put out there. Some of the darkness he felt he’d put out there.
‘Bill called in a team from the Ministry overnight,’ Harry explained. ‘They cleared set pathways between classrooms and highly frequented places like the library and the Great Hall. McGonagall has the prefects escorting the younger years to and from their classes – it’s like being back in second year with the basilisk on the loose.’
Draco didn’t get a chance to answer her because the fourth year seemed to have finally worked up the courage to confront Draco again, as he stomped up to the table, this time accompanied by just three friends, to stand behind Weasley to glare across the table at him.
Harry turned to look at Draco and felt Hermione lean around him to get a look too, trying to figure out why Ron was asking. It took Harry a moment to work it out because he’d seen Draco dressed that way almost every morning on their runs. He was wearing muggle joggers that were on the slim side and what looked to be about three different layers. Harry suspected he had a thermal under his t-shirt and jumper, all on under a muggle windbreaker with his bracers and shin guards strapped over the top. Harry was pretty sure when he got him alone later and had some fun stripping him off that Draco would be wearing long johns under those joggers. He figured Ginny was dressed about the same and that it was an honest miracle their noses weren’t sporting frostbite.
Draco isn’t a problem to be fixed.
In the dark, it took Draco a few moments to realise what had woken him, but the soft whimpering was heartbreakingly familiar. He rolled quickly onto his side facing Harry and pressed up close against him. Reaching out, he started to run soft fingers through Harry’s hair, humming soft nonsense words to form a soothing calm that would bring Harry out of his nightmare as gently as possible. It didn’t always work, and it had taken him more than a few attempts before he found what did work, but the soft soothing sound and motion were best. Jerking Harry awake tended the give the nightmare time to linger.
He got up awkwardly, passing Teddy to Andromeda before he stuck his hands under the tree and dragged a box out from the very back of its branches. He’d made the choice not to wrap it, choosing instead to put a bow on top with a small note. It wasn’t a small box, something around twenty inches wide and perhaps twenty-five long and another twenty deep again. It was a little on the heavy side. Harry eyed it curiously as Draco slid it across the floor to him, then reached out slow hesitant hands to take the note from atop.
be wrong?
‘Seriously?’ Hermione rolled her eyes. ‘That’s all you’re going to say? “Ah”?’
Which wasn’t something to be thinking about just now. Draco focused back on the here and now and said, ‘I didn’t recognise either of them.’
After that, well, it had just seemed silly to move back. But now Rose was ready to start school and they’d talked and talked about it but in the end, it had come down to the simple fact that when they’d thought about having children, those children were always going to Hogwarts.
The original plan had called for Harry to be gone just twenty-six hours. They spent the extra forty-two reassuring each other they were alive and well.
‘Look,’ Harry sighed, scrubbing a hand through his hair. ‘It’s not like I thought about you and just didn’t invite you, we were at Gringotts looking through the Lestrange vaults and then we went to find something in one of the Potter vaults and Draco found the deed to the house in Godric’s Hollow and it just sort of happened.’
‘I assured him he would be safe here,’ she’d snapped at Madam Pomfrey as she’d ushered them out of the Hospital Wing and Hermione hadn’t missed the fury in Madam Pomfrey’s eyes either.
‘I’m getting there,’ Harry told him with a soft laugh. ‘What if you hadn’t been such a git in Madam Malkin’s?’
The first day he’d come back they’d asked so many questions and he’d only been able to answer some of them. The easy ones. He’d told them they were friends, that they were trying to put the past behind them. Not forget – never forget – but they weren’t kids anymore and the war had shown them exactly the kind of people they were. Draco wasn’t a Death Eater; he didn’t want to be the kind of man his father had become and Harry – Harry didn’t want to be the Saviour or Chosen One when he could just be Harry.
Harry wandered back over and sat down, slightly closer to Draco this time. ‘I’ve known about magic for more than seven years now, I like to think I’m harder to surprise but then stuff like that,’ he motioned out into the darkness and, as if on cue, the thumping came again, ‘happens and I still feel like I’m learning about it for the first time.’ He looked at Draco, eating calmly and at Luna who was now edging toward the windows looking fascinated. ‘You’re both mental.’
Draco had come to hate these particular wards. They were the main reason he’d become so useful to the Ministry.
She watched, detached, as Harry looked to Malfoy and then rolled his eyes. ‘You didn’t tell her.’
or Granger would be all that happy. Kingsley hadn’t exactly been happy but the beauty of being forced to work for the Ministry as an ex-Death Eater was that when it inevitably blew up in their faces he would be safely out of the way. He’d make damn sure Harry didn’t get caught up in the fallout as well.
‘She hasn’t seemed worried so far.’
‘Can you bring it down?’
Pansy frowned. ‘That’s hard to imagine.’
‘I’m not unaware of the nature of your relationship with Mister Malfoy,’ Robards’ tone was gruff, annoyed, but there was no hint he was disgusted by Harry’s relationship – beyond the fact that it had prevented Harry from doing the job he’d promised to do. Homosexuality was still frowned upon by a large chunk of the wizarding world and Robards’ straight forward acknowledgement tried to thaw Harry’s attitude. Although he wondered how far that acceptance went and if he could bandy the words queer or bi around too.
He’d found himself wanting to stay, to talk some more to this version of his father that he hadn’t seen in so long, but they were out of time and honestly, his father had looked exhausted just from their short exchange. He’d walked away from his father’s cell wondering how much longer the man could survive in there. At least he’d walked away with the knowledge that his father didn’t disapprove of his choice of partner. Although he still didn’t know if his father approved or was just resigned to the fact that this was the way things would be.
Honestly, telling Molly, the only mother he’d ever really known, had been so much easier. Although, that might have had something to do with the fact that he hadn’t been planning on saying anything, it had just burst out of him over a strange lazy breakfast at the Burrow.
Harry thought he was overreacting which just guaranteed that when Athena did bring something home Harry would be the one to deal with it.
‘Do you know why you said it?’ she asked. She’d heard things from Charlie, from Ginny and even George, but she needed to hear it from Ron for it to mean anything.
Harry nodded. ‘We don’t always have training or jobs when we leave the castle and we were home for two weeks over Christmas, remember? We even made the papers at Halloween.’
‘I hope they’ll know a Hogwarts that’s never been tainted by war.’
Draco pulled a face. ‘With my parents? Nope. Next.’
Taken aback, Pansy laughed. ‘Sweet Merlin, Draco, you have to know you were obsessed with him too.’
At least not when he was awake.
‘Hold on,’ he said, tone incredulous, ‘you think I fancy Pansy?’
What followed was fast. It was dirty. They traded spells back and forth faster than anyone watching could properly keep track of. They danced around each other, never staying still. Dodging and weaving as much as they used shield charms. Draco took a weakened cutting curse to the face that split open his right cheek. Harry took a scorching hex to the leg that burned a nasty flare up his leg before he managed to put it out.
‘Yeah,’ Ron grumbled. ‘Missed four months of you visiting Malfoy every bloody day in Azkaban.’
‘Focus!’ he ordered himself. He snapped his wand in a complicated spiral, casting the rough kind of stasis spell hated by proper healers but taught to every auror because it was the one thing that might keep them alive long enough to get proper help.
‘What is it?’ Mendenhall gruffly demanded.
‘There was a note,’ Remus told him, voice gentle even when he looked as though he wanted to wail and shout. ‘He doesn’t want us to worry. Not anymore.’
When he released her, he took a step back and got a good look at her.
Pansy waited him out, it wasn’t something she’d have ever done before. She’d have gotten bored or annoyed and deemed his silence not worth her time. Now she sat with him in silence and waited for him to marshal his thoughts, waited for him to give her some sign that she wasn’t wasting her time.
Telling anyone other than Draco and Luna how he was really feeling was still a struggle. Draco made it easy, stupidly easy, if Harry were honest (which was how they got into this in the first place), and it was certainly how the bond between them had formed. Instead of letting Draco see only his anger and his frustration when they were fighting, he found it ridiculously easy to let him see everything else as well. He could tell Draco anything and he knew Draco would understand or if he didn’t, he’d try. He asked questions and offered comfort or distraction and he was always exactly what Harry needed at any given moment and it was all Harry could do not to wonder how he’d gone so long without Draco in his life.
‘I fucking hate this,’ Harry snarled. ‘I hate that they did this to him and that they’ll keep doing this to him and there’s nothing I can do about it.’
They went their separate ways once they reached the Entrance Hall, Draco went back into the Great Hall in the hopes of finishing his breakfast while Ginny made for the quidditch pitch and what was sure to be a gruelling training session. Quite unfortunately for Draco, Granger and Weasley were still seated at the table with Harry. His boyfriend had the strangest look on his face, one that seemed to be part amusement, part horror, with a healthy dose of incredulity.
He’d helped her come to terms with the fact that she’d never have her parents back. He’d sat there across the table from her in the kitchens and offered her words that gave her comfort. Gave her a reason to believe that even if her choices had been selfish in the beginning, that what she’d given her parents could one day (maybe) outweigh what she’d taken from them. It was never going to be okay that she’d wiped her parents’ memories, never going to be okay that she’d erased key parts of themselves – that she’d erased years of moments and memories and defining events just to protect them from Voldemort.
Draco could acknowledge the role they’d played in shaping the Harry of before the war, they’d healed pieces of him then, but they’d only patched over gaping wounds and he couldn’t fault them for that. He couldn’t fault them for all they’d managed as children but that still begged the question now.
Draco pulled a face, but Harry grinned. ‘You know, this is the second time I’m hearing about these fantasies,’ he teased.
Draco might have come a long way from the arrogant prat he’d been before the war but that didn’t mean he didn’t relish an opportunity to be the one Harry chose. He might be becoming a better person, but he still had a long way to go before he stopped taking advantage of something like that. He wasn’t sure he’d ever have it in him. Especially when it came to Harry. He’d spent years watching the way Harry was with his friends, he’d worried for weeks over whether or not Harry would change his mind about him once confronted with his friends’ disapproval.
The date was awkward. It was always going to be. It didn’t help that she had Draco’s words stuck in her head. It didn’t help that they went to the Three Broomsticks. It was something they’d done a dozen times before and, honestly, she wasn’t sure she wanted to do anything else when things between them were so awkward but that didn’t stop Draco’s words from cycling through her head.
‘Talk to Draco like that again and it’ll be a hundred times worse.’
‘I always sort of knew there’d be people I went to school with I’d lose touch with,’ Draco told Harry, not sure if Harry was following his meaning because he really was only just now noticing that for all the distance they’d apparently travelled, they hadn’t travelled any at all.
Harry sighed, looking around at his beloved castle as though mourning what it had once been. ‘Probably not.’
Not that he seemed to have managed that even now. And he didn’t think he’d be wrong to think Hermione hadn’t actually met any of Ron’s needs either. That conversation Ron had started with him before all this had happened suggested there was still a lack of communication and confidence in the relationship that his sudden turn at homophobia had brought to light.
At least that part of their relationship should be familiar to Hermione, Harry couldn’t help thinking wryly.
‘I’ll need you to translate what you hear,’ Draco warned and then he began to cast.
Harry frowned and gave him a hard look.
‘Nah,’ he replied, ‘maybe some other time.’
For some reason, it had not actually occurred to Harry until that moment that Draco Malfoy was a
Harry had problems. He could only imagine the look on Ron’s face if he… But he wouldn’t see the look on Ron’s face if he found out anything about the stupid things about Draco Harry found attractive because the arsehole had walked out of his life leaving a trail of slurs in his wake and Harry would not ruin a wonderful evening thinking about his former best friend. Even if he had learned just that morning from Ginny that Molly had removed her curse and he’d been talking to Charlie and a mind healer.
Draco scoffed. ‘I was raised to appreciate beautiful things.’
‘Not a chance.’
made another comment.
The coin in his pocket burned hot and he knew he was out of time.
Harry nodded before he looked down at Draco. ‘Run?’
He figured it would be awkward, but he was looking forward to it.
It was in the quiet moments when Draco knew he and Harry had a future. They might not talk about marriage and kids, not exactly, but the times they’d skirted around the idea of their future it had been unspoken between them. Draco wanted the husband and the kids. He might not have brought it up since he and Harry started dating but he knew he’d brought it up before, back in Azkaban during one of his bad days when all he could think about was how he wouldn’t survive. He could remember huddling in the corner of his cell, on the bed for once and not the floor, seeking warmth from Harry’s touch even if at the time they were still pretending those moments cuddled together meant nothing.
Harry pulled a face but took the potion bottle from Draco so he could dry himself properly while Harry put it away. ‘Why did I think this was a good idea?’
‘You’re going in first,’ Mendenhall informed Draco, as if he could possibly have thought otherwise.
Pansy smiled at Draco. It was a soft expression he’d never seen directed at him before, but she turned her attention to Harry first. ‘Do I need to apologise for trying to hand you over to the Dark Lord?’ she bluntly asked.
And it wouldn’t be, Draco would like to point out, because he was the Boy Who Lived, Slayer of Voldemort.
The war had broken them but, in the aftermath, they’d pieced each other back together, sharing all those broken parts and learning how they fit together to make a stronger whole. Draco knew and understood Harry in ways Hermione and Ron would never be able to. In a way Harry was beginning to realise, he didn’t want to them to.
,’ Harry managed to channel all of the disrespect he’d once aimed at Snape into that single word. ‘If I have to, I’ll take him away somewhere you’ll never find him and we’ll sit back and watch the whole fucking wizarding world crumble down around this shambles you call a Ministry.’
Well this one's a little different...
In which Hermione finds out.
Draco wasn’t in Azkaban. That was behind him. This was Hogwarts.
‘Bye, Granger.’ Draco made sure he locked eyes with her before he left, he wanted her to see the silly mistake she was making. He wanted to enjoy the look on her face when she realised that she’d hurt her friend, that she’d shown him she didn’t trust him to make his own (sensible) decisions.
Ginny wrapped an arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulled him tight against her side. ‘I know.’ Ginny was quiet for a moment, just holding him and then she said, ‘You need to shower. You’re a mess.’
‘Well, we didn’t trigger it – I don’t think.’
Then he killed him.
‘I’m going to need Fleur,’ he said, instead of addressing Harry’s worry.
‘Of course,’ Draco confirmed, didn’t Harry already know that? Draco was sure they’d had a conversation about the standard issue cuffs that most aurors used. They were a step up from the binding wards they used to use but not much of one when you were trying to contain a curse breaker – especially one who was both Ministry trained and self-educated.
He was still watching her with bemusement when his daughter reached them, and she immediately pressed herself against Malfoy’s legs and buried her face in his middle. Her voice was muffled but still clearly understood and Hermione found herself further at a loss as to what to even say because Draco Malfoy was standing on the platform where he’d just seen off two of his kids to Hogwarts and a third was pressed up against him and he looked happy and fit and – and muggle!
The empty mug bounces off his head and for a moment he’s seeing stars.
‘Alert the Ministry.’
He didn’t fancy spending a few nights in the hospital wing having his leg regrown, but he’d certainly be spending a few hours having some bones and muscles mended.
Draco scoffed at that, rinsing himself off one last time before he turned off the taps and tugged the curtain back. Harry handed him a towel and then went back to rifling through the cabinet, looking for his potion. Draco took the towel and then stepped out of the bath onto the mat, swatting Harry’s hand out of the way before he reached past him to grab the correct potion. Still dripping water everywhere, he motioned for Harry to sit on the edge of the tub and tilt his head back. Harry did so without complaint and allowed Draco to carefully drop two drops of the potion into each eye.
Ginny was already on her feet and she took the bag Harry handed her and mirrored Draco’s path along the other side of the table until they met near the doors. Without saying a word she followed him all the way up to Ravenclaw Tower. The question to get in stumped them for a moment until Ginny remembered a conversation she’d had with Luna and the statue let them pass. It didn’t seem to matter they were a Slytherin and a Gryffindor, just that they were bringing a Ravenclaw – an obviously exhausted Ravenclaw – back to her bed.
Ron, at the same time, muttered, ‘He really spent three months in Azkaban?’
And then an alarm started blaring, a sure sign something bad was happening somewhere the department was monitoring, and Harry dropped his head back with an exasperated sigh. When he looked over at Ron, though, he didn’t seem annoyed, there was a grin on his face and he said, ‘Better make it dinner. Friday?’
‘Don’t die,’ Luna ordered him firmly. ‘I’d miss you terribly.’
‘And you think it’s because of the bond?’
It would take some adjusting, learning to share Harry when he’d never had to before. He couldn’t keep Harry from Granger and Weasley and even if he could he didn’t really want to. Keeping Harry from his friends would only drive him away in the end and Draco had no intention of ever letting Harry go.
His hesitation seems to annoy Ginny because she snaps. ‘I need an answer. You’ve stolen my husband; do you want my baby too?’
Bloody hell, he hoped this conversation was just as awkward for Ron as it was for Harry. Why couldn’t they have been having this conversation about Lavender in sixth year? It would be so much easier if Harry was trying to dispense advice without both of them being forcibly reminded that Harry’s first experience was with Ron’s sister.
The first step.
Other than an exceptionally fit body.
That was somewhat a relief. ‘Who’s on the floor below?’ Draco questioned.
He made sure the Harry in his sketch was shirtless, pushed the covers down low on his waist to tease at hips and the curve of his arse. Pansy would appreciate the hint of a view that Draco could see any time. The mussed hair, the lightning bolt scar, they gave away the man’s identity. The soft look on his face in sleep gave away the comfort and ease with which he slept beside Draco. He
The spells fired by Death Eaters weren’t typically the easy kind that could be fixed with a simple
In that moment, her cheeks flushed with anger, Harry had been reminded that Hermione had not welcomed Ron back with open arms during the horcrux hunt. She’d forgiven him, possibly quicker than she would have normally done, but she had not just accepted his platitudes and sudden gung-ho attitude as though it erased all the words and the hurt they inspired. The locket didn’t work like that, it didn’t create thoughts and feelings, it pulled out your darkest fears and brought them forward. All the things Ron had shouted while wearing the locket were thoughts and fears weighing on him already and a few quick words of apology and a little lifesaving didn’t make those fears just magically go away.
‘I thought it would hurt more.’
Instead, Draco spun, and two more curses felled the Snatchers holding Ron and Hermione. Harry didn’t even flinch at the green light snapping toward his friends. He was too busy shaking the spell from his features as he wrestled with the Snatcher holding his shoulders.
It was the same reason he always pushed Harry to leave after his allotted hour. Being the Boy Who Lived may have given Harry the pull to visit Azkaban daily when even the most influential family members were allowed only monthly visits, but Draco hated that he had to experience Azkaban even for that hour.
‘I have no love for the Ministry, Robards, no respect, but I love Draco more than anything and he
Eventually, when she calms down, she shoves him away. It’s not gentle and he staggers back and lands on his ass, but she doesn’t apologise, and he isn’t looking for it. He’d let her do a lot worse right now.
Harry was sort of glad he’d never had to sit through Percy trying to explain sex and the different spells you needed to know to have it safely. Judging from the expression on Hermione’s face, she was less horrified at the idea of sitting through a lecture hosted by Percy than she was at the notion she’d failed at one of her prefect duties. Once he’d assured her it was true and wasn’t at all her fault, she got to her feet and swept out of the room in search of the current Gryffindor prefects and possibly Professor McGonagall.
In the end, he didn’t see the spell that killed him, either.
He didn’t know how to tell Hermione that he could tell Draco all of this.
Last year, he’d been nervous and excited, so full of hope for what magic could bring into his life. Sure, there’d been that thing with Voldemort and Quirrell but there’d been classes and quidditch and Ron and Hermione.
‘Yeah.’
They’d started, of course, with clearing the mess created by Harry’s horcrux hunt and didn’t honestly get much beyond that. The goblins could provide Draco with a total of the money stashed away in the vault but they couldn’t give even an estimate of the worth of the magical items Bella had stored in there or the precious stones. Most of their time, Draco knew, would be taken up clearing out and having the items valued. They were definitely (unfortunately) looking at months of work and Draco had a feeling he knew exactly how he’d be spending whatever time he wasn’t working with the Ministry or readying the Manor to become the Charity Burbage School for Young Witches and Wizards – definitely sticking with Burbage Hall for short.
Pomfrey used a spell to clear away the blood, another to seal the wound and applied some dittany to ease the inflammation and scarring. When she stepped back Luna sighed sadly, fingers reaching out to trace over the tattoo now that there wasn’t a chunk of glass in the way.
‘Ugh, you were horribly obsessed with him for years,’ Ron moaned. ‘I’m just realising how much easier my life would have been back then if you’d just started shagging.’ He turned to look at Hermione. ‘How much more sleep do you think I’d have gotten sixth year if Harry could have been looking at Malfoy instead of his bloody dot on the map?’
They were already making use of him and he had no choice, it was court mandated, not to mention there were plenty of people at the Ministry happy to see him being used in such a way, they were even happier to know he was being hurt in the process. Giving him additional training didn’t mesh with the idea this was all part of his punishment for each and every one of his poor choices and Harry said as much to Robards.
‘I’ve got it all planned out,’ Harry promised, pushing back up until he was straddling Draco’s thighs, hands resting on the smooth sculpted skin of Draco’s stomach. He traced idle patterns and enjoyed the way the muscles twitched beneath his fingers.
Knowing there wasn’t a chance those words were about the new line of moon phases Harry had only that day had tattooed down his ribs, Draco (on the verge of sleep) forced his eyes open in the darkness to frown at Harry. He’d only just resigned himself to being used by Athena as a source of heat and didn’t much fancy waking enough to have a proper conversation. With Athena draped along the length of his back like a furry living cape, he squinted through the darkness at Harry.
Draco snorted. ‘Even Harry can’t fix my reputation.’
‘Muffling charm in the alcove,’ Harry noted. ‘Yeah, it was the first time I ever really thought about magical children, why?’
‘A mushroom cloud of magical death,’ Harry deadpanned, seeming rather bemused by the whole thing as opposed to the quietly terrified atmosphere leaching out of the other members of the MLE behind them.
‘I think I’ll see if Pansy and Blaise want to donate to Hogwarts,’ Draco murmured.
Harry’s expression lost the tenderness and he pulled his hands away from hers abruptly. ‘I have no secrets from Draco,’ he stated, reiterating with that one sentence how much he trusted Draco. As though he hadn’t spent the last two weeks alternating between dodging his friend and stubbornly stating the same fact over and over again just in case the next time he said it, she actually believed him.
Harry was just Harry; horrible hair, hideous glasses and finger smudged wand. He’d long stopped caring that Harry was famous, long stopped believing what being friends with the Boy Who Lived could do for him. That appeal had worn off with a spurned gesture of friendship.
Yeah, this was a conversation better suited to Draco or even Narcissa and certainly not one he wanted to have with either of his friends then and there.
It was cold in the Chamber of Secrets. The basilisk was dead but the venom spreading through Harry was powerful, he wouldn’t survive this. He’d lost this fight and Ginny would be consumed by Riddle until there was nothing left of her and Voldemort would be young and powerful again, free to hunt down the piece of himself that lived out in the world and do – what? Harry didn’t know, but he wouldn’t be around to see it. He and Ginny would die down in the Chamber, and once Riddle was strong, once he’d taken proper form, he would leave the Chamber. He’d find Ron first and he’d kill him, him and Lockhart and then it would be a matter of time before everyone else in the castle died.
He looked up just in time to see Hermione’s lips twitch in amusement, Weasley looked repulsed and Harry was rolling his eyes in exasperation. ‘That’s not news,’ Harry informed him.
He hadn’t thought about the song in years, but recently, the more time he spent with Teddy, the more he found himself humming the tune. It was a lullaby, something soft and old his mother used to sing to him of a night before bed. In French. He’d long forgotten most of the words, but he still faithfully remembered the tune and so, feeling like a complete idiot, he stood there, hand on a cabinet full of boggart and he hummed.
Joseph moved back to join the other students and offered one final instruction, ‘Don’t kill each other.’
Draco looked up at him and simply said, ‘No.’
‘Harry,’ he whimpered, slumping against Harry’s side as he slid one of Draco arms over his shoulders to help prop him up.
There’d been real anger in Harry’s voice the night before when he talked about the way Weasley spoke of Draco and how Ron’s own refusal to accept that Draco was changing had been the drive Harry needed to confront his best friend with the truth. Lying on Hannah’s bed, there’d been nothing but pain and hurt and a bewildered sense of betrayal that Harry’s best friend could say such hateful things.
He wasn’t really sure how else to comfort the man you love after he’s just killed you.
Hermione’s expression, which Draco thought might have fallen in the face of his thorough research, instead twisted into something that looked satisfied. She nodded. ‘It’s one Bill sent me. He had the appropriate passages translated.’
The students would be served breakfast in their common rooms for the weekend while Hogwarts was to be swept for any lingering curses, any newly laid traps. It would be long and tedious work and if not for the fact the building being swept was Hogwarts herself, Draco would have been delighted by the opportunity to do some real proper curse breaking.
‘I suppose I best give you your final present then.’ Although, Draco had no idea how he was supposed to top the precious gift Harry had given him. A pair of ancient Black family rings, imbued with centuries of family magic and made for long lasting love. The kind of love that ran warm and long, always simmering even when passion came and went.
Mendenhall on the other hand, was old, scarred and had been through both wars and, in his opinion, Draco made for a pathetic Death Eater. He could have been like so many other aurors, painting Draco with the same brush as his father but he wasn’t and that meant that Draco stood a chance of coming out of this alive and maybe even unharmed.
Ron snorted dismissively. ‘Pomfrey fixed that in a second.’
‘Do you think they’re happy now?’ Harry asked Granger, once more reaching out for her hand to give it a reassuring squeeze.
For just a moment Harry could see Draco thinking – worrying – this time would be just like all the others over the last four days, with Harry ignoring what Draco had to say and stubbornly holding onto the hope that everything was the same if only they gave it some time, but this time – whether it was Draco’s tone or the change of scenery, or just the sheer lack of sleep – Harry broke. He’d collapsed forward into Draco and sobbed, and all Draco had been able to do was wrap his arms around him and hold him while he cried tears for a man who had called him disgusting and wrong and a whole bunch of words that Harry had honestly never expected to hear from Ron Weasley.
The shrug Harry gave was intentionally vague. ‘They worked together over the summer at the Manor.’ His words were the complete truth if a little light on the details. Bill
over you. I chose our best friend, who you hurt really badly.’
When Pansy arrived, he and Harry were curled up in one of the grubby booths that optimistically offered a view of the quiet street – out of an incredibly dirty window. The dim sunlight that did make it through the grime on the window worked with the low torches to create an effect that in a restaurant (or any other bar) one might have called romantic. In the Hog’s Head it just leant an air of shadow and concealment that let most of the patrons go about their business without fear of being watched too closely.
She studied him while he tugged on his t-shirt and jumper but didn’t say a word until he’d pulled on his boots (Pomfrey, thankfully, had simply removed them the day before, rather than vanish them), propping a foot on the chair by the bed to do up the laces.
He rolled up his sleeve to show the scar from the basilisk fang which was all that remained after Fawkes had healed him. Then he tugged down his jumper to show what remained of the mark from the horcrux. It had faded some, with diligent work from Madam Pomfrey and even a salve Narcissa had given him but he would always have the scar. Just like Draco would always bear the scars from the bathroom in sixth year. And the hippogriff in third.
‘Right,’ Harry agreed. He grunted and his hands shifted as he tried to keep a grip on the cabinet between them.
‘Should I go tell her again?’ he wondered.
‘No.’ Bill shook his head. ‘It’s not keyed to the Dark Mark; we don’t know what it’s keyed to and that’s the problem. Even if we get enough curse breakers to perform a controlled break, the backlash from the spell releasing could wipe everything out for miles.’
‘And he’s still a git,’ Harry murmured.
‘I know I’m not a sadistic psychopath but – I mean – why?’ Harry muttered as he tried another spell with similar results. ‘Oh, shut up, would you?’ Harry grumped at it.
No one spoke and the temperature in the corridor spiked sharply as Harry shoved Chris in the chest.
He didn’t tell his friends that, though, what he said instead was, ‘He’s got permanent nerve damage down his right leg from being held under
‘I need help with Potions and Transfiguration. Professor - Professor McGonagall said you might be able to help.’
Granger’s eyes narrowed as she looked between them before she huffed out an exasperated breath. ‘You’re not going to listen to anything I have to say about this, are you?’
Getting his pants off was going to be painful as fuck and he really wanted to be able to cry and wring some sympathy kisses out of Draco when he wriggled out of his jeans and not have to put on a brave face because Ron thought now was a good time to talk.
A part of him thought it would have been so much easier to ignore Draco that first day, to ignore Slughorn’s obvious disdain for him and to join Ron and Hermione instead in Potions. He and Draco could have made a show, then, of putting the past behind them, of forming a tentative friendship that would happen in the open for everyone to see. They’d question it, question them, but it would have had a transparency that no one could argue with.
Draco hummed to show he was listening, kept up the soothing trace of fingers on bare skin.
‘If only,’ Turpin grumbled with a roll of her eyes. ‘It’s worse, they’re all shy and smitten and working up to it.’
‘You made my life hell.’
She shrugged, gaze a little distant. ‘I think I already knew most of that. I watched him too, remember?’
was the one being hurt but he cared that the Ministry could do this to anyone. And Harry could work with that.
‘Draco!’
Who was looking mighty amused. Although his expression did sour a bit at Harry’s words.
Draco sniggered, enjoying the outraged sputtering from the fourth year. It was slightly delayed as though it had taken him a moment to realise Harry hadn’t been talking about the wand at all.
Flitwick jerked back with a startled squeak and then they all heard him issuing orders for students to stand back before his small head appeared again and he reported, ‘I’ve sent Miss Goshawk along to the Hospital Wing, she should be just fine.’
Draco breathed deeply and let his magic swell away from him, triggering the detection spells and pushing them as far out as he could manage, pushing beyond the line of their designated search zone in the hopes of finding something that might have been the cause.
‘Now you’re getting it,’ Harry sounded cheerful.
‘Yes,’ Draco agreed.
Harry had come to him and kept coming despite what others might have thought, and Draco had been (eventually) grateful for his stubbornness, but he would have given Harry up in a heartbeat if he thought the Weasleys would turn their back on him. He’d have hated it and it would have broken him more than those three months in Azkaban or the entire year he’d spent living with Death Eaters, but he’d have done it for Harry.
Harry froze, stunned. It was a long moment before he managed to say, ‘You could do that?’
‘I can’t do this without you,’ Harry whispered, pleaded.
She needed to hate him because if she didn’t then she would need to properly acknowledge the bond.
He wouldn’t be telling Hermione that, though, and he sure as hell would never tell Ron. He could just imagine how insecure that would make his best friend. Ron would probably spend a good few days brooding over the idea that Harry regretted not taking Draco’s hand that day on the train, that he regretted not choosing Draco over Ron back when they were eleven. Which was ridiculous because Harry loved Ron, treasured the friendship they’d built over the last seven years.
Draco was not. ‘Why is Thomas handing out photos of me and Harry?’
Harry didn’t bother to fold his robes, tossing them aside until he was left wearing the same blue jeans and grey t-shirt Draco had watched him pull on just an hour before. Draco scrunched up his nose at the trainers on Harry’s feet but made no comment about his treatment of his robes. He too had a leather wand holster strapped to his right forearm. Stripping off his robes also revealed the large grim tattooed on his left forearm, Harry’s own tribute to someone who meant a great deal to him – Sirius Black.
Instead she said, ‘I wanted to marry you when we were five.’
She called him Draco and she played at being friendly because she didn’t want to lose Harry and she feared that Harry’s stubbornness would drive him away but she tried so hard to make him see that Malfoy was dangerous – that blood magic was so dangerous and he’d just let Malfoy paint him in blood and it had been captured for the whole world to see, but Harry just shook his head, annoyed and told her he trusted
‘Oh. Well I suppose I got to be the one to surprise Hermione.’ Malfoy sounded slightly disappointed. He laid the phone on the table and Ron glanced down to see it wasn’t a muggle phone after all but one of the very expensive new wizarding models that were starting to become popular.
He woke up to the distinctly unpleasant sight of Weasley.
Snape remained a spy. Draco became a Death Eater. A killer.
It was a nice memory to cling to when they returned to the stress of their final year at Hogwarts.
But there were moments. Tiny little moments in fifth year, thoughts had on the very verge of sleep and actions that didn’t quite make sense that suggested something wasn’t right. Cedric Diggory was a pureblood. There was too much death and chaos – his insane Aunt Bellatrix, broken out of Azkaban and waiting at home when he returned for Easter holidays. More hushed exchanges and an almost fearful undercurrent in the Manor.
Luna and Draco followed a moment later (Draco also with a soft pop, though Luna managed near silence), arriving in a surprisingly clean ally down the street from the takeaway Pansy had recommended. He debated for a moment going and seeing if she was home and wanted to join them but then he remembered she was working and wouldn’t be home until late. He’d make it up to her later.
Harry could only look away from him and when his gaze had flickered back there were tears in his eyes. He’d blinked rapidly, working to stop them from falling but he knew Draco didn’t care if he cried, Draco had just wanted him to do something. Anything. He’d been wanting him to yell and shout and be angry. He just wanted Harry to do something other than pretend that everything was fine and normal and that his oldest friend hadn’t just walked away from him after one of the hardest conversations of Harry’s life.
‘You were this ridiculously handsome boy in fancy robes who spoke eloquently and only ever seemed to be around for fancy balls and garden parties,’ Pansy told him. ‘You were like something out of a fairy tale and my parents used to talk about yours in hushed whispers like you were some big elegant secret. You’d come to those things and you’d talk to us and play with us but you never really seemed to be one of us and for so long I just thought that was because you were this dashing fairy tale prince and I told Mother I was going to marry you and live in your castle.’
‘I can’t,’ the junior auror repeated. This time he said it with an apologetic shake as he tried to stare down the famous Boy Who Lived and found himself wondering if he was about to be cursed. Or die. Harry’s expression was rapidly traveling from anger to rage and while Draco wasn’t surprised when the streetlight above them blew in a shower of sparks and glass, he did wish Harry could have kept better control of his temper.
They’d reached the castle gates now and as they stepped through, they separated for apparation. Harry had the strength to take all three of them but not the skill to make their arrival as a group unnoticed in a muggle area.
He maybe wasn’t worth standing in a field in the middle of February, knee deep in snow before the sun had even properly risen.
…actually, that probably wasn’t a bad idea. He’d already thought about asking her for help with reforming Azkaban because Salazar knew that coming from him it would be seen as nothing more than an ex-Death Eater trying to protect the rest of those remaining from Voldemort’s little army. He’d experienced Azkaban for himself, seen what it had done to his aunt (he was sure she hadn’t always been
‘I don’t want to look up at you,’ she snaps, pointing her finger sharply at the other side of the table.
‘I honestly didn’t care about most of the other students,’ Pansy told them with a shrug.
when he was locked away, miserable and alone. It made Draco’s chest ache to think about what Harry had been through – all because he was told by Dumbledore that he needed to be at the Dursley’s to keep him safe. To protect him from Voldemort. Never mind the fact that Harry had wandered the neighbourhood simply to escape the horror that was the Dursleys, never mind that when he’d chosen to go after Harry it had been perfectly simple to find him.
But Dumbledore hadn’t.
‘Goodbye, Tom.’
Draco glanced over to see him striding across the room looking annoyed. His hair was still damp – because he never bothered to do anything more than run a towel through it – and he’d put on a fresh set of joggers and a quidditch jersey that Draco thought he’d lost to Luna over the summer (proving his favourite Ravenclaw had much better taste than he’d given her credit for). Hermione was right behind him, fresh out of class and looking exasperated.
Harry snorted a laugh.
If Draco were the sort of person likely to sit down and discuss the brain and learning with Hermione, the difficulties Harry had with certain concepts and the ways in which he learned would probably be an all-day conversation. He’d had it with Harry before, they’d talked over the trouble he had with certain subjects and his complete loathing for essay writing despite finding the subjects fascinating. What was fascinating now was how much easier Harry found certain things without the piece of Voldemort lodged in him. Mind magic was still a struggle, but Draco’s mother had remarked that he was a fast learner when he connected with a subject.
‘Hi,’ Draco greeted softly.
There was hate in her words.
Draco bit his lip to hide a grin. That had been a bad day for both of them, but it was hilarious looking back at it now. Harry had been a wreck that afternoon when he’d come down to Draco’s holding cell. The shadows under his eyes were enormous, something Draco had taken great pleasure in pointing out. He’d also taken joy in pointing out Harry’s clothes were a mess, his skin horribly pale and that, frankly, his hair had reached all new levels of unmanageable and that he’d be better off shaving it than attempting to fix whatever madness had occurred.
Which wasn’t at all what he needed to be focusing on. He tugged down the sleeve of his jumper – Harry’s jumper, he realised belatedly, as he used it to wipe more blood from his eye. The idea that he’d been wandering around with a bunch of Slytherins wearing a Gryffindor jumper caused a twinge of amusement, but he forced his thoughts to focus, even as he felt them slipping and sliding as his body tried to shut down and his mind tried to hide away from what was happening.
‘I’m sorry, you know,’ Ron said once they were seated at a table in the corner of the room, drinks on the table and food ordered. ‘I should never have said all that.’
She’d chosen having Harry in her life over removing Draco from Harry’s and that made all the difference in the world to Harry. Hermione would rather have Harry in her life and put up with Draco than not have him at all and all that did was show Harry that Hermione had always chosen him.
And it was deeply satisfying to see the look on Ginny Potter’s face as her husband raised his hands and shoved her forcefully from the circle just a moment before the final ward snapped into place closing himself and Draco in a tight circle of magic that couldn’t be stopped.
He couldn’t go to Ron and Hermione; they were still in Australia. He couldn’t go to the Burrow. He loved the Weasley’s dearly, but they’d kept so many truths from him on Dumbledore’s orders. He wouldn’t burden Luna with this, not when she and her father were still recovering. Everyone he might have gone to was dead. Sirius and Remus, his parents. Even Snape.
Hermione looked intrigued and opened her mouth to ask questions, but McGonagall spoke first. ‘It’s not that easy, Mister Malfoy.’
‘You think it was one of the Unspeakables he had working for him that did this?’ Harry asked, hopefully starting to understand what Draco was getting at.
The cold look the portrait managed to convey when glaring at the smiling foolish face of Dumbledore settled something inside Draco. He’d once greatly respected Snape and although the events of sixth year and the war had tarnished that respect, some of it had been gained back when he learned how long Snape had been working to protect Harry. Though Draco did not think that weeping over the corpse of Lily Potter and saving her son’s life excused the fact that he did not do more to protect Lily or Harry once he knew what was about to happen.
Both times, Harry had been with a more experienced partner. Ginny had taken control the first time and Draco had done much the same their first time too. That had taken some of the pressure off Harry – some but not all. Merlin, the first time he’d fucked Draco could have been a disaster, but it had been almost reassuring knowing that if Harry was doing a shite job of making Draco feel good that his boyfriend was perfectly willing – and capable – of rolling him over and just showing him exactly what he wanted.
or trashy magazines like
‘Yeah.’
‘There’s no spell,’ Harry said, and he was quite happy with how calm and reassuring he sounded.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Do you want me to turn out the light?’ Draco asked.
The tiny gap seemed to suck out what little warmth his cell managed to hold onto and if the wind was just right it was also big enough to fill up with wet salty spray from raging waves crashing into the side of the island.
‘You still own twenty percent of Sleekeasy’s,’ Draco informed him. ‘I don’t know that even that could…’ he trailed off when he realised Harry was staring back at him blankly.
‘That doesn’t mean they couldn’t have been the ones to call.’
‘I really don’t care that Harry likes men,’ he assured her.
‘I think it’s a brilliant idea,’ Harry promised. ‘You should really talk to Hermione about it.’
‘Draco…’ Harry had trailed off not seeming to know how to finish that sentence. He’d stared at Draco with a soft confused look and all at once he seemed to collapse in on himself. Shoulders curling protectively inward, hands grabbing hold of the sofa cushion beneath him.
‘Should we go for a run?’ Draco asked after they’d snuggled in silence for a while.
I hope this hit the right note. I do want to point out that just because Hermione knows and supports it, that doesn't mean its going to be a bump free journey to full blown acceptance. Please let me know how you thought and felt about this finally happening, I'd love to hear from you!
He sniffed. Realised with some horror that he was crying. Not big ugly tears, but quiet weepy ones for lost chances and the boy he could have been.
‘Not intentionally,’ Harry assured him, but he dug around in the plastic takeaway bag until he produced a receipt with what Draco eventually recognised as a telephone number written on it.
‘Under the circumstances, I believe you would be unsuited to this,’ she informed him. ‘That is, I assume you are still speaking only in parseltongue, Mister Malfoy?’
It had been alarming, if Draco was honest. If his father hadn’t spoke up again, eyes rolling as though he’d expected exactly the exchange they were having, Draco might have feared his father was getting ready to end it all, the nice throwback to the man he’d admired a complicated form of goodbye.
‘Nope,’ Harry replied. ‘I told the guy behind the counter to choose something he thought I’d like.’
He had to swallow around a sudden lump in his throat. No, despite his attempts to remember the positive outcomes of the summer, today was not going to be a good day for him. He thought he might just spend the day out in the grounds. He couldn’t stomach the thought of locking himself away in his room again this weekend. Even being in the Great Hall was causing a tightness in his chest.
Hermione hadn’t, she still wasn’t sure she understood, because the bond Draco and Harry had formed wasn’t something you could do with a spell or an enchanted object like she’d been hoping. There wasn’t anything she could point to and say “this is the reason, this is why you like Draco” and break the charm or the spell and have everything return to normal.
‘What the fuck was that?’ Mendenhall demanded, stepping up as close to Harry as he could comfortably get without knocking his rising star auror right across the boundary and into the mushroom cloud of magical death.
‘That’s not a no,’ Harry murmured against his lips.
The man nodded, gave them a thoughtful look and then seemed to realise that they were standing around his stall and not buying anything and that needed to be remedied immediately. ‘Can I interest you in a custom cutting board? They’re muggle-made to cut down on spell interference in potion making. They take a little more maintenance than your average board, but you don’t have to worry so much about cross-contamination – if you clean and care for them properly.’
He didn’t find any. Not on his first check anyway, but the second series of spells he ran through flared an alarming purple and he fought the instinct to leap backward for the relative safety of the damaged Muggle Studies classroom.
And alright, maybe he was still angrier than he wanted to admit but he was perfectly within his rights to be and Draco certainly wasn’t going to tell him not to be. Ginny had even told him he should be angry for as long as he wanted and then a bit longer just to let Ron suffer. She might have been willing to talk to him and help him work through his own problems but that didn’t mean she didn’t want to punish him.
‘Come with me,’ he asked.
‘My magical education has been very different to yours, Granger,’ Draco stated plainly, attempting to keep his mind on the here and now. ‘Not just because you’re muggleborn,’ he clarified and then paused to consider the implications of being raised as a muggle until the age of eleven. ‘No, I gather some of it is because of that.’ She shot him a watery glare which he ignored, they’d talked about this before and her glare had had a lot more force then. ‘Purebloods have traditions and a good deal of them, like blood magic, are considered Dark now. Perhaps one day, we’ll show you our library and you’ll begin to understand.’
Most importantly, Harry would be able to cross the wards in a heartbeat to help Draco if something went wrong but until then, he could go back to dealing with the aurors and the witches incapacitated on the lawn. Keeping the muggles from figuring out what was happening was, thankfully, not Draco’s problem, either. He could see some of the neighbours starting to poke out of their homes now that the fighting was done. He blocked out all of that and with a deep, calming breath, he set about identifying and pulling down the first of the wards.
Trying (and failing) to contain his amusement, Ron said, ‘You weren’t kidding about the goblins.’
‘You know how it is,’ he shrugged, mischievous grin making Ron frown warily. ‘Four kids, it’s not exactly easy to get out for a date.’
Harry followed him easily into the house, Winthrop and Mendenhall were much slower and a lot more cautious. Both had their wands in hand and shields at the ready. They stepped where Harry or Draco stepped and kept their pace slow and steady to match his. It seemed they were finally learning. Perhaps he could look forward to a future in which they didn’t just let him go about getting himself killed for them. He wondered if this meant that he’d earned their respect. Just because Winthrop had broached the idea of him working for the Ministry didn’t mean she respected him as a wizard or a curse breaker, it just meant she knew how much easier it would be to make use of him if he became compliant.
And wasn’t that perhaps a huge oversight on Dumbledore’s part?
There was never going to be the perfect time to have this conversation with Ron but the longer he put it off the harder it was going to be because Ron, like Hermione, would feel hurt that Harry hadn’t felt he could come to him with the truth. Harry had been right, in the beginning, wanting to give Ron and Hermione the chance to see that Draco had changed. He’d been right to give them time to get to know Draco properly and to see that he was someone worthy of Harry’s friendship. But they’d had that time and still he’d put off telling them. He’d put it off so long that even if Ron reacted well, even if he didn’t walk away in disgust, his best friend was still going to be hurt that Harry had hidden the truth from him for so long.
Draco had been terribly amused but now, looking at what Harry had done to Bella’s vault, he couldn’t help feeling his boyfriend had gotten off easy. ‘This is going to take more than one or two visits.’
‘You are not helping, Draco,’ she said sharply.
‘I don’t know,’ Harry admitted. ‘I think if I’d realised how much you weren’t playing up your injuries, I might have better understood everything that came after.’
Draco wanted him to acknowledge the words Ron had shouted at him when Harry tried to talk to him the next morning before they left Hogwarts.
‘The point is,’ Draco said with a wink at Harry, ‘that I have told Ginny to go talk to Madam Pomfrey about devising some sort of plan to help her strengthen certain muscles to help her play.’ He speared a piece of gnocchi on his fork and pointed at her. ‘You’re scary good but I think if you talk to Pomfrey you’ll be bloody terrifying. There’s no way those scouts will be able to ignore you.’
He could lie in Harry’s arms and talk in broken whispers about the terror of hiding behind wards in his own bedroom because the house was full of Death Eaters.
‘I was planning to,’ Harry said crisply, well he’d been aiming for crisp, but he thought he might have hit petulant instead, judging from the look Robards gave him.
‘No.’ He didn’t feel the need to elaborate but the way Granger’s eyes darted quickly over to Harry made him think she suspected as such and even thought she knew why.
And that didn’t even factor in that last they’d heard from Bill, the dragon hadn’t been doing well at all. There simply hadn’t been enough supplies on hand to properly tend to the dragon and though they were doing their best, Bill had passed on the warning that without finding the curses and bringing the wards down there was a very real chance they would have to put the beast down rather than allow it to live in such agonised misery much longer.
She hammered her fist on the door of Draco and Harry’s room and then hammered again when her first knock went unanswered. She was about to try for a third when the door was yanked open and she found herself looking at a very dishevelled Harry.
He’d always assumed Hermione understood the isolation Harry experienced every summer, especially after he’d returned fifth year an angry teenage mess. Though perhaps she’d assumed his time was more like her own, spent in study and exploration of the magical world even if it was done in secret – after all, it was to be expected given his relatives hate of magic.
‘That was a bit mean,’ Harry informed him lightly, but Draco noticed he wasn’t doing anything to break from his hold, nor to prevent Draco from locking the door on his friend.
‘Bugger off.’
Harry rolled his eyes and kicked him under the table. ‘What are we making anyway?’
Draco forced down the fresh anger wanting to surge through him. Dumbledore was dead. Snape was dead, and Harry would never have to see Petunia or her family again. It would take time for him to see it, but Harry did have adults in his life who he could trust to share his problems with and seek advice from. Hadn’t Molly and Arthur proved that time and again over the summer? Hadn’t his own mother in her patient teaching – and he was sure there’d been some sort of emotional breakdown early in the summer. Something about collapsing in a fit of tears into his mother’s arms? Draco had never gotten the full story about that one, but he did hope that his mother’s reaction had helped Harry to see he did have people he could talk to. Certainly, that there was no need to be embarrassed about it.
Draco played his role perfectly. So did Harry. Harry went with Dumbledore, Draco let the Death Eaters in. Harry arrived on the tower. Dumbledore immobilised him.
‘I’m honestly beginning to wonder how Arthur has any limbs left,’ Draco admitted. ‘All my mockery over his job when I was a kid seems really pathetic right now when I think about all the junk he had to deal with.’
Until they decided Harry was allowed to set foot in their bank again, he was relying on Draco fetching him gold when he needed it and any big purchases that might normally have been deducted directly from his vault were, for the time being, coming out of Draco’s because the goblins refused to process any request with his name on it. They were, for all intents and purposes, holding his gold hostage until they came to some sort of agreement. Harry had no idea what they wanted from him and from what Draco had managed to work out of them, the goblins were just enjoying watching Harry suffer. It had been a problem in the beginning but now he’d just continue to use Draco’s money until he and the goblins came to some sort of understanding and he could pay Draco back.
‘Definitely not,’ Draco assured him, that would hardly serve to make Weasley regret the way he was shaming a teenage girl. ‘I’ll talk to your mother.’
‘I hope you know what you’re doing, Harry,’ were her parting words.
Joseph cleared his throat.  ‘Who’s next?’
fought on the wrong side of the war.’
Harry frowned at him. ‘Why are you looking so amused?’
Confused at this sudden change in behaviour, Harry frowned at his friend. By all accounts, Granger had been doing her best to be friendly and accepting of Draco since she’d realised Harry was serious about giving him a chance. Draco didn’t understand why now was any different to all the other times Harry had stood by him when everyone else was calling him Death Eater and accusing him of enchanting the Chosen One.
Because that’s what it was, a nightmare based on a memory, on the endless days he’d spent locked away, lost and afraid. Afraid that he would never get out, afraid that if – when – he did that there would be nothing left of him. In the quiet and the cold, the warmth of Harry’s touch was nothing but a phantom longing. The peace that the stag shaped patronus bought was little more than wistfulness.
‘You two are more familiar with the castle,’ Mustafa pointed out to Draco and Harry. ‘Start with the fifth and sixth floors. We won’t get it all done today. We’ll worry about the seventh floor and towers tomorrow.’
The aftermath.
‘Do you think we’ll ever recover from the war?’
Kate, on the other hand, wasn’t put off by the potential of talking to a former Death Eater because her startled response to Draco’s arrival was a breathy, ‘You look like a prince!’
Wizards, Draco was coming to understand, were not at all a practical lot.
It made him wonder if they’d ever noticed the little things he did for Draco or the ones Draco did in return. He thought Hermione must have, for her to be as unsurprised by their relationship as she had been. Although she’d still been quite surprised to learn he and Draco were together but that was mostly because she’d assumed he was an oblivious idiot. Which, fair enough, but she still must have watched all the little things? Draco fussed like a mother hen half the time, worrying over Harry’s clothes and his hair. Behind closed doors, perhaps, but he was just as openly bad about Harry’s homework. He bought tea when Harry was too tired to move, got him food when he was late back from auror training. Well, he called on Kreacher to arrange food, but it was the thought that counted. He’d even owl ordered half a dozen self-inking quills because he’d seen how much Harry still struggled after seven years of writing with the bloody things, and had Andromeda collect some ordinary muggle notebooks so he could easily take notes during his auror training.
It occurred to Harry then that he had never seen any small romantic gestures between Ron and Hermione. He’d never seen Ron buy flowers just because he could or fetch her tea when she was too deep in an essay to remember to eat or drink. Admittedly he hadn’t been spending as much time with them as he used to and he assumed they spent plenty of time together when he wasn’t around, but he didn’t know that he’d ever witnessed that kind of moment between his friends.
None of them showed any signs of going off to bed. It seemed even Luna and Ginny were settling in to wait with him as long as it took.
But it had been almost twenty years. So much had changed. He was, he was –
Sometimes he got a little distracted by how fucking fit Draco was when he was acting the stiff aristocrat – and honestly that probably said a few concerning things about Harry and his antagonistic history with Draco that even his mind healer hadn’t been ready to touch with a ten-foot broom.
Draco nodded. ‘Fancy dinner, muggle cinema. Lunch, breakfast, ice skating.’
He wanted to focus on what Fleur was doing. She’d promised to teach him what she knew about blood curses when he’d finished working with Bill but every time he blinked it seemed as though minutes were passing and not just seconds and then Harry was there, lifting him gently into his arms with an arm beneath his knees and another supporting his back and Draco draped his arms automatically around his neck.
Draco thought that was hilarious, but his attention was drawn away from Weasley when he felt Granger’s eyes burning holes into him. He met her gaze and raised a brow, wordlessly issuing her a challenge. He knew what he was saying with his look, he knew he was daring her to make a thing of it, but he wasn’t sure she understood the full implications of the challenge he was issuing.
Draco had never seen McGonagall so furious, he suspected even Harry had never managed to garner this level of fury from the woman. They walked her through what they’d discovered and then set about freeing the rest of the portraits while she slowly made her way along the corridor speaking with each of the portrait’s occupants until the picture she’d gathered had her almost shaking in her rage.
‘Right.’
‘Do I need to be awake for this conversation?’ Draco asked, his voice muffled by the crook of Harry’s neck.
‘Seventh year Ravenclaw,’ Draco supplied, which didn’t clear up Harry’s confusion at all.
Draco had never had friendship like that. Luna was the first person he’d ever stepped up and helped even when it could have gotten him killed.  Weasley wouldn’t have (and hadn’t) thought twice about doing those same things for Harry. Draco was confident he would step up now, that he wouldn’t hesitate to help Harry or Luna if the situation called for it, but he would never have helped Crabbe or Goyle that way. He would only have stepped in to help Pansy or Blaise if he’d seen some way for it to benefit himself. Until Harry and Luna, he’d only ever read about the kind of friendship that would inspire that level of loyalty. The relationship Harry had with Granger and Weasley wasn’t something he understood. He’d watched them over the years and been jealous and envious but at the same time he’d scoffed and mocked them for daring to have something he so desperately wanted.
‘Granger,’ he greeted in return. He was perfectly civil, though not what anyone would call friendly, when he offered her the tea pot. ‘Tea?’
‘Oh.’
Harry rolled his eyes. If Harry – who had been given special instruction on how to observe his surroundings as part of his auror training because he’d been so spectacularly bad at it – had noticed, then there wasn’t a chance in hell Draco hadn’t noticed the way Hermione had been carefully avoiding them for the last two days. Even in classes she’d somehow managed to work with them without actually looking either of them in the eye.
Harry had always seen the way Ron had his back, how he’d stood beside him when confronted with Draco and his cronies or when he’d commiserated about Snape treating him badly. He’d been right there when they went through the trapdoor and down into the Chamber. Ron had been by Harry’s side for almost all his silly misadventures and that meant the world to Harry.
That might have been an understatement. Now that she and Draco were trying to build an honest friendship, he (and Draco) were discovering that Pansy Parkinson was, frankly, amazing. She was sharp and scathing when she wanted to be, but she was also loving and supportive and she was so happy to be able to share her new experiences in the muggle world. More often than not, her letters to Draco had bits in them meant for Harry, witty commentary on her new life, scathing remarks about her old. She might have a dark sense of humour but she could be light and cheerful and she was good for Draco.
But it was a lie.
‘Oh, yes,’ agreed his grandfather when Harry finally made it back to their room and brought the topic up with him. ‘James used to hate sitting those extra lessons in the summers.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry got to his feet. ‘He can’t have Ras – I’ve got him babysitting a muggleborn at St Mungo’s. He can have Mickey – he likes her.’ He turned to Ron. ‘Drinks tonight?’ Harry asked.
‘Not about me,’ Harry croaked the reminder to himself. He coughed, shook his head once more and stared pointedly at Granger. ‘Right. Sorry. Er…’
‘I did say yes when he asked,’ Hermione admitted, looking terribly guilty. ‘Oh Harry, I know he said some really awful things to you, but he apologised to me and he explained some of the things he’s been feeling – and you know Ron, he’s never been very good at dealing with this sort of thing. I’m honestly impressed he’s even admitted to enough for the mind healer to start working with him.’
Ginny was right, this thing between Harry and Draco had started long before Harry went down to find him near-dead in his Ministry cell and it made it so hard to continue hating Draco when he was trying so hard – so recklessly hard – to make up for his past. Still, there were moments when she looked at him and all she could see was the boy who hadn’t cared who he hurt as long as it got him what he wanted. She looked at him and saw the boy who had let Greyback into the castle and was the reason Bill had scars on his face.
Draco didn’t know that his own fascination with the bonds creation and its limits could withstand Hermione’s deep scrutiny, however. He loved Harry. He was bonded to Harry by soul and magic and the pureblood he’d been raised to be accepted the magic without needing to analyse it to death. Raw magic, which was what he was beginning to suspect had brought this bond about, wasn’t easily studied or quantified and while he could accept that, while Harry could accept that, Hermione was taking a very muggle scientific approach to something that wasn’t scientific at all.
‘Floo him,’ she says again, slowly, carefully, enunciating each word as though he was an idiot for not understanding the first time. ‘Let’s talk about this.’
Ron was fifteen again. In the blink of an eye he was all insecurities and awkward words and frankly he bloody hated it.
Draco snorted, the “probably” was telling. He bet he could amuse himself and Ginny for ages getting Harry to admit that it didn’t much matter which way he swung if his entire focus always had, and likely always would be, on Draco. Although, he supposed, for clarity, it wasn’t a bad thing if Harry felt the need to label himself – Draco never normally did.
Harry didn’t open his eyes. ‘I thought they’d faded yesterday.’
‘It’s a good look on you,’ Granger spoke suddenly, voice soft but serious. ‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen you this happy and relaxed.’
‘Because he’s an idiot,’ Draco had answered sharply. ‘I’m tired and I’m well aware how moody I’m being – it’s horrible – but he won’t fucking take the dreamless sleep and if the sleep deprivation doesn’t kill him I certainly will.’
Harry tried not to let the fear of Draco’s never waking up consume him. He tried not to let his rage at the Ministry take over.
He watched the way her eyes flitted aside to study Harry, who had turned at her arrival and was now facing her, giving her his own once over. He kept his arm along the back of the bench, his fingers still threaded in Draco’s hair. Draco knew he looked good. He’d made a point of handing him clothes he knew would impress Pansy that morning (after their highly enjoyable shower). He looked like Harry Potter, but with clothes that fit, in colours that brought out his eyes and the soft golden colour of his skin.
‘It’s always about Harry,’ Draco offered dryly, thinking back on all the other times Weasley had walked away and the tenuous reasoning behind each and every occasion.
‘Yeah,’ Harry agreed slowly, not sure where this was going.
No, Draco knew a bit about blood magic and protection, he’d read up on it, marked Harry with a type of it. He didn’t believe Dumbledore’s claims and he wasn’t sure Harry did now either. Harry’s trust and belief in Dumbledore had been shaken over the last year and a half. Too many truths had come to light, too many questions he now had to consider that had answers he didn’t trust or like. Harry would never be able to ask Dumbledore the questions he’d like to, he’d never be able to get the closure he needed, and, in that absence, he was drawing his own conclusions and those weren’t painting Dumbledore in the best light.
Harry pressed warm lips against Draco’s collarbone in silent agreement. ‘What if I’d come to apologise after I nearly killed you in sixth year,’ Harry whispered softly, ‘do you think that would have changed things?’
Draco considered this. Yes, Voldemort was dead, and the war was over but that didn’t erase the reasons Granger had chosen to obliviate her parents. Magic was dangerous and they had no way of protecting themselves, but erasing their memories didn’t erase the danger, it just erased their knowledge of the danger. Moving them to Australia had been the main reason they were safe during the war. Voldemort’s reach didn’t extend that far.
Draco turned to look at him, his eyes were unfocused and there was blood dribbling from his nose and his ears. He opened his mouth to speak but instead gave a wet cough. Something thick and warm splattered across Harry’s face and neck and Ginny let out an impressive snarl of profanity. Draco coughed again, more blood bubbling up to spill down his chin, some of it spattered Harry’s jumper.
Draco pointed to himself. ‘Black heir.’ He motioned around to the house. ‘Black ancestral home.’ He made an exaggerated patting motion on the floor. ‘Lots and lots of family magic.’
The fact he expected anything at all from her annoyed him greatly. He shouldn’t have expected any different, she hated him as much, if not more, than all the other students. But despite all that, he’d still expected to hear her, at least once, correct the assumptions the other students had made about the fight that had landed him in the Hospital Wing. He didn’t even have a single detention and yet the three students he’d apparently attacked had each been given two-months’ worth and an official write up from the Ministry for assault. When he’d learned that fact was being so easily ignored by the students, he’d snorted derisively which had earned him a sad smile and a hug from Luna.
Draco doesn’t hesitate to rise from the chair, but he does pause at the fireplace and the look he gives Ginny is one Harry is sure he has only ever seen. It’s gentle and filled with awe and his words are so soft and almost reverent when he says, ‘Thank you.’
Hermione couldn’t help but stare at him then, eyes wide with surprise – and more than a little guilt. How had she never realised how trapped Ron felt in Harry’s shadow? She’d made mention of it before, touched on how jealous he could be of Harry’s fame and fortune, but it had never really occurred to her how hard it must be for Ron. Ron who was the youngest son, constantly overshadowed by his brothers (and, when it came to quidditch, his younger sister) and always living in the wake of the Boy Who Lived rather than by his side as a separate person, looked up to and admired for what he brought to the table – or more accurately the war.
Harry looked to Draco for an explanation, but Draco just shook his head, not wanting to get into the ridiculousness of Weasley attempting to defend Hermione’s honour. He didn’t think it was worth pointing out that he’d done it out of love for her because Hermione was not receptive to kind words about Weasley at the moment. He’d said some horrible things to her when she broke up with him that he would need to do some serious grovelling to make up for.
‘He was a bloody useless Death Eater,’ Robards acknowledged. ‘I was part of the Greengrass girls’ rescue.’ They both winced. ‘I saw that firsthand. But he’s not stupid. He knows more about the Dark Arts than some of my best Aurors.’
‘We can’t get it down,’ Bill said. ‘There’s something in that last ward that’s preventing us from even properly identifying it.’
Sort of.
If you are one of those lucky people who could pull off a Hogwarts robe with confidence and the self-esteem to know your worth, I love you and appreciate you, because going through my teen years in a Hogwarts robe probably would have broken me.
Well, that sorted Harry’s Christmas present then. Draco knew a lot about the old wizarding family’s, even those who didn’t make it into the Sacred Twenty-Eight. He was sure he could put some of that knowledge to use to help Harry reclaim his past.
Draco restored the fire in the grate with a quick twitch of his fingers and settled onto the couch as close to the fire as they could get, pulling Harry down with him until they were stretched out together, Draco on his back, Harry wedged half on him, between him and the back of the couch. With arms wrapped tight around Harry, Draco asked about the dream.
The vicious smile on Joseph’s face faltered imperceptibly as he beckoned Harry to the front of the classroom. Draco exchanged a wry look with Harry as he started toward the front of the classroom. Poor Joseph had really chosen the wrong student and the wrong class to try and make his point.
A perk of being so thoroughly hated by the entire student body, was the way they left a good chunk of space around him at the table, no one willing to sit close to him. It afforded him the privacy he needed to peek into the envelope and pull out the single sheet of parchment folded in half.
Draco shook his head. ‘I don’t know. Merlin, I hope it’s not Filch.’
Harry’s watery smile widened, and although he didn’t know it in that moment, later, Draco would learn that it was the easy acceptance his grandfather’s portrait had shown of his relationship with Draco that had brought so much joy to Harry. But he wouldn’t know that until much later because now that Harry was looking at the portrait of his grandfather there wasn’t much chance of pulling him away.
‘Yes, it is,’ he agreed without even a hint of arrogance because it really was a good idea.
‘Luna did,’ Draco repeated dubiously.
Harry was normally terrible at charm-speaking (it involved a certain subtlety and finesse he frankly lacked) and they probably should have switched roles, but Harry was the official auror – sort of – and Draco was merely an ex-Death Eater forced to work out his crimes as the Ministry’s spell fodder. It went without saying that it was better he handle the magical people than be seen to be manipulating muggles. Although his ex-Death Eater status probably meant he shouldn’t be touching their captives either, but he’d rather get reprimanded for removing objects from the pair than risk an emergency illegal portkey or one of them getting their hands on a wand.
The nursemaid seemed startled but rather than reply, she stuck her arm out of frame and seemed surprised when it left the confines of her portrait. She promptly burst into tears.
‘I have to go,’ he choked out, not seeing any other way to stop the summons.
He watched Hermione hesitate for another moment before she took Ron’s hand and together, they started for the door. Before they could leave Luna returned. She had a strange look on her face, worried but determined. Somehow managing to look sad and distraught while her mind was set on something. She’d changed into clean clothes and her long blond hair hung loose and damp down the back of her dress. She smiled distractedly at Ron and Hermione but didn’t pay them any more attention as she walked steadily back to Draco’s bed.
‘She thinks it’ll only last a week,’ Draco said, and his words were the hisses of snake language rather than English and he looked to Harry with exasperation. Harry, as he’d been doing since Draco had accidentally picked up the language from him that morning in the Carrow’s back field, translated his words.
It was strange, knowing that the relationship he had with his childhood rival was more stable and healthier than the one two best friends had embarked on. He didn’t fancy Hermione’s reaction if he actually said that, though. This was one of those times where he could only offer bits of advice when asked and mostly, he just needed to be a friendly shoulder.
‘The next one is going to talk about the restructure of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, with follow ups to cover the legal changes and eventual restructure of the entire Ministry of Magic in the wake of Voldemort’s rather telling take over,’ Granger paraphrased drawing Draco out of his thoughts.
‘I hate you,’ he told Harry when just opening the door of Bella’s vault had resulted in a cascade of ugly magical knockoffs that almost knocked their goblin escort clean off his feet.
‘Tea, please, Kreacher, just for now,’ Draco requested, tugging his gloves off and tucking them into the pocket of his jacket. He was once again wearing muggle clothing, but he could hardly argue they didn’t make more appropriate clothing for exercise. The wizarding world was truly lacking in certain areas. Mostly common sense, Draco was coming to see.
‘My father owned half the Wizengamot before Voldemort came back. Also, and please don’t hex me for this, could you please take a moment to consider exactly who is Minister right now and how he came to be there. Also, you may want to think about how exactly it is Kingsley is working to fix this problem of corruption.’
Draco sat pressed back against the cracked leather, head tilted back to rest on Harry’s outstretched arm, enjoying the way calloused fingers stroked slowly through his hair. Harry had his back to most of the bar patrons (what few there were), curled inward, almost protectively around Draco. Their legs were pressed together and the hand that wasn’t threading through Draco’s hair had a steadying grip on Draco’s free hand. Draco’s other hand was occupied with a tumbler of firewhiskey.
Draco felt his lips twitch in a reluctant smile. ‘We’d have had angry sex for months,’ he said.
Hope this one satisfies! Please leave me a comment so I know your take on this chapter and the things it revealed.
Imploringly he’d said, ‘He doesn’t see Harry Potter, the Chosen One, Saviour of the Wizarding World, he just sees Harry.’ He’d looked helplessly at Molly then and he’d been so startled by the tears forming in her eyes that he’d flinched back from the table.
‘He’ll be here when we get home, Potter,’ he promised, tone light with exasperation.
‘They’re going to let Draco sit the curse breaker exams?’ Hermione looked surprised but happily so.
Harry would have liked nothing more than to shed his clothes and go another round. But they were running out of time. Draco was supposed to be in London taking part in a raid and Harry was supposed to be at Hogwarts planning their next counterattack.
‘Take off your clothes,’ Draco snapped, just to be contrary. ‘And get on your knees.’
That he’d been one of the ones driving their behaviour.
Why she had a muggle pen in her handbag, but no paper or parchment was a strange contradiction he’d not expected from Hermione.
, was what he didn’t say, and Draco realised, rather stupidly, that the thought had never occurred to him. He and Harry didn’t need to be touching to draw on each other, they just sort of hovered at the edge of each other’s awareness, always there, always waiting for the connection to be pulled or pushed in a certain direction. It had never occurred to him to draw on that magic and even if it had of occurred to Harry, Draco still would have needed to shape the magic Harry pushed his way.
Jealousy? Had Ron seen the potential for this in their every exchange and feared it? But no, that was giving him too much credit. Hermione might have picked up on that – Ginny definitely would have (probably had) – but Ron really hadn’t been any better at understanding his own emotions and feelings than Harry.
‘You’re an idiot,’ he told him as he followed him into their room and shut the door.
‘How can I even have this baby if I don’t want it?’
‘Eight,’ Draco repeated, lifting his head enough to stare at her incredulously. ‘In the morning?’ he asked, seeking clarification because that seemed horrendously early to be barging into someone’s bedroom and for Salazar’s sake, Ginny had been there long enough to build a five-story card masterpiece that he was impressed hadn’t already exploded in her face.
He didn’t know how to talk about the truth of Dumbledore’s plans, not the full extent of them. How did he talk about the way his life had been carefully planned out from the very beginning? How did he talk about Dumbledore’s plans without the bitterness he now felt? When he still didn’t know how to properly connect the man he thought he’d known with the cold man who had planned out his own death – and Harry’s too?
‘Can you see the others?’
As if she could read his thoughts – and he might be the (somewhat) accomplished legilimens between them but he wouldn’t put it passed Luna to have something like that up her sleeve and just not have thought it worth mentioning – Luna peered down at his leg and hummed happily.
him in his life, he could sort of appreciate that Ron had (and was) taking steps to overcome his insecurities and what he saw as his own shortcomings and that he might one day be an alright sort of bloke who didn’t lash out at the people who loved him with the worst words he could think of just because he didn’t like something and didn’t understand his own emotions well enough to work through them properly and without inflicting hurt on others. But Harry wasn’t there yet, and he might never be and that was okay, because that was Harry’s choice and nobody else’s.
And Merlin bless Luna for being completely unaffected by the revealing tattoo (she’d been there when he’d gotten it done) or his Dark Mark (she’d seen that many times before – he’d never felt the need to hide it from her like he did others).
But there were those ifs again. Draco couldn’t change the past. Even if someone handed him the most powerful time turner in existence and offered him the chance to go back and change his own choices, he wouldn’t take those choices back. All the bad things in his past shaped him into the man he’d become. They’d shaped him into the man who could understand Harry, who could understand his dark days and his good ones. Those choices had shown him just how important the decisions he made were.
He did, thank Merlin. Harry nodded once, sharply, and with a snap of his fingers summoned Draco’s coat along with his own. He helped Draco into the garment, gently easing the fabric over Draco’s aching arm with Molly’s help. Then he was hastily tugging on his own coat, gently urging Molly to step back, to step away from what was about to happen. Once she was at a safe distance, Harry spun, putting his back to Draco and dropped into a crouch, wand slipping into his hand. Despite the burning pain, Draco dropped his left hand to rest on Harry’s shoulder. Harry raised a hand to briefly squeeze the hand reassuringly before he spoke a sharp command to the Weasleys.
‘Of course, of course, off you go.’
While he’d been assessing the situation, Mendenhall and Winthrop had too, the older auror appeared to be even more annoyed now, whereas Winthrop had a calm expression on her face. Draco had seen that look on her once before, she’d sunk into the same calm right before she’d launched a counterattack against a supporter who had been hiding in the last house Draco had been sent to clear of Voldemort’s wards. Of course, he also knew how that ended so he wasn’t all that confident in her calm demeanour.
‘Oh, get back here,’ he snapped. Once the girl had spun back around with a startled “eep” and taken a few steps back toward Draco and the table, he said, ‘What’s your name?’
He chanced a glance down and saw that she was right, the freshly healed skin was clear of one moon phase, the full moon slipping directly into a crescent moon as it cycled across his skin. He’d have to have the missing piece replaced to restore the cycle. It didn’t look like any of the narcissus had been destroyed by the glass at least, but the stag over his left pectoral had definitely lost the tip of an antler. The loss of the moon phase annoyed him the most, the stag just looked like it had fought and won a fight.
He’d likely never be able to look Hannah in the eye again, but he just didn’t understand.
Ron, who had no idea what Malfoy had to do with anything – he didn’t work for the aurors, Ron knew that much – was taken aback by the easy way Harry rolled his eyes and dropped his feet to the floor as though he was going to get up and give this more attention than it needed. Ron also had no idea who Rasika was or why Malfoy – he was assuming it was Draco Malfoy they were talking about – would think it was okay to use him as spell fodder at something called the Galahad Estate.
Harry quirked a brow but then answered his own question with, ‘Merlin, your dad wanted you to go to a different school because this one is terrible and nearly got you killed.’ He seemed to sink in on himself. ‘Having an adult perspective sucks,’ he told Draco glumly. ‘Hogwarts was the first home I ever had.’
Harry eyed him knowingly. ‘Don’t think I don’t know how much you want to study whatever those spells turn out to be.’
Draco circled his jaw to try and relieve some of the ache, gingerly probing it with fingers to check the extent of the damage. He could taste blood, so he knew he’d cut his cheek on his teeth but other than what was sure to be an impressive bruise given his complexion, he didn’t think Weasley had done much damage.
and which could be found in the library) so as to prepare the students for their OWLs and NEWTs. No one had failed yet, so they were considering the tactic a win.
Opening all the windows in his room to allow the soft warm breeze to fill his room wasn’t quite the same but he didn’t want to brave the lake and McGonagall had done the best she could in making sure his room was open and light – a far cry from his Azkaban cell. She’d created the safest space she could for him and he was immensely grateful. It was still uncomfortable for him to spend so much time in one room but knowing he could step outside whenever he wanted eased the pressure that threatened to suck him under and trap him in a panic attack.
‘I love you. I’m here. You’re safe. I love you. I love you.’
Draco shook his head.
Draco sniggered. ‘We should ask Ginny for the memory.’
‘What do you mean “if”? I thought Kingsley already signed off on it?’
‘Yes, he is,’ he replied gently, wondering if he was going to find himself trying to explain to a six-year-old that it was perfectly okay for boys to like other boys.
‘No,’ Draco assured him. ‘I think it was a goat.’
Ginny gave him a look, shot another at Harry and Luna seated at the Slytherin table before pointedly casting her eyes to Ron sat with her at the Gryffindor table and then back in his direction to Bill and Fleur stood beside him. When her eyes flicked back to Draco, she raised her eyebrow as though to say, ‘You’re all here, where the fuck else would I be?’
‘Do you think we should head back?’ Harry wondered, lifting up an arm to check the time on the watch he’d gotten from the Weasleys when he’d turned seventeen.
Harry didn’t know exactly what Draco had said to Hermione over breakfast, but he thought she understood now that even if Ron apologised, there was no quick and easy fix this time. This time, if Ron wanted back in Harry’s life, he needed to show that he was willing to wait, that he was willing to work through his own issues before they could try and rebuild what Ron had thoroughly broken.
McGonagall gave him what honestly looked to Harry like an amused smile. ‘How unfortunate. Did Mrs Weasley have any idea when you’d start speaking English again – or perhaps at this point even French would be welcome.’
It was weird that he was okay dealing with Ron in this respect. He didn’t like him at the moment, but he could be objective about his relationship with Hermione. Or more accurately, Hermione’s relationship with him. Likely, the ease came from the vindictive knowledge that Ron was doing a decent job of ruining his chance of happiness.
Because that hadn’t created a panic at all. Bloody Pansy. The worst part was he knew she was being truthful. Whatever Draco got him was bound to be amazing and was likely to put every other gift to shame and so Harry was scrambling to put together something that might vaguely measure up. Because they might not be rivals anymore but they hadn’t left their competitive natures behind.
She smiled kindly and the girl. ‘Hello.’
Although, dead might be preferable to all the questions Harry would be left answering.
Honestly, sometimes Harry wished Draco still had the pain tolerance of his thirteen-year-old self, at least then Harry would know when he was hurt the moment it happened and not have to worry that he was hiding the true extent of injuries out of guilt and a need to make amends. Or worse, some sense that the punishment was deserved.
He looked around at the busy street, searching for some way to ease the mood and his eyes locked on a small narrow shop squeezed between a second-hand bookshop and a milliner’s. He’d never been in there before, but he knew what he’d find when he went in. Perhaps it was time he paid the shop a visit instead of expecting Ezekiel to come to him? He did have some time before he absolutely had to be at the Ministry.
Draco nodded before turning to Granger. ‘You’ll tell Harry where I am?’ he asked of her. Harry hadn’t returned from his early morning auror training yet and Draco had been having a surprisingly comfortable morning at the Ravenclaw table without him. Chatting away with Granger with occasional asides from a grumpy Weasley and a thoughtful Luna, hadn’t turned out nearly as painful as he’d been expecting.
Having said his piece, Harry got to his feet, snatching another two pieces of toast and bacon off his plate as he did. He offered his friend a tight smile and told her she should think on what he’d said before he squeezed Draco’s shoulder.
‘Where’s Luna?’ he asked.
Draco shrugs. ‘You never stopped hating me.’
Hermione may not understand his relationship with Harry, why Harry would want anything to do with him or even why he’d been able to forgive Draco all his past sins, but she understood that she didn’t need to understand it to know that they were good for each other. Draco also thought she was looking back on their time at Hogwarts in a new light and finding certain interactions suddenly questionable and most definitely full of subtext.
‘It did,’ the goblin declared in a short snap. ‘Not our job to deal with the aftermath.’
‘Life’s been good,’ he answered, with another of those grins. ‘Really good.’
The bond had been formed naturally through love and friendship, a literal baring of their souls. They’d come together by shedding prejudice and old hatreds and, even in the middle of Azkaban, surrounded by dementors and despair, they had created something strong and so achingly beautiful that Molly had cried when they told her about it. So had his mother.
Which wasn’t really Harry’s point, but he tended to get a little distracted when thinking about Draco. Besides, even if Draco had ways of making it very (very) enjoyable to complete his homework in a timely fashion, there were still times when facing down an essay had him regretting his choice to come back for NEWTs. Even then, he did have to acknowledge that getting it over and done with made it go a lot faster than a week’s worth of procrastinating ever did. Plus, it didn’t hurt that Draco’s pleasure in learning new things was almost infectious. Harry had never appreciated what it meant to study and learn before, it wasn’t something he’d ever gotten from just sitting around doing homework with Hermione, and certainly not something he could have garnered from any time spent with Ron, but watching Draco get invested in what he was studying never failed to make Harry go all soft and gooey.
Draco tossed a flirty winked at Harry.
. Draco’s old prefect was doing a remarkable job of painting them as a dark magic fighting team and Harry was not above dragging Draco places just to take advantage of the way he kept
‘Only for you,’ Harry assured him.
If she was to be swayed at all.
‘Merlin,’ Harry shook his head. ‘And you’re still alive?’
‘Out. Now,’ he snapped, the idea he might just have lost Harry hadn’t taken root yet, he’d be appropriately terrified later, at home, when they were both safe and cuddled up close in bed with as much skin-on-skin contact as possible as a deliciously warm reminder that he hadn’t almost gotten Harry killed the first time they were in the field working together.
This was, for all of them, the real sticking point. Not one of them would have held it against him if he went off on Harry for loving a Death Eater or Draco Malfoy but to target the fact that Draco was a man…
Harry rolled his eyes but couldn’t help leaning in to give Kate a whispered, ‘He is very pretty, isn’t he?’
Draco motioned out through the glass into the dark.
‘Sweet Salazar, no,’ Draco answered quickly. ‘Absolutely not.’ He shuddered. ‘I couldn’t think of anything worse.’
The pain was excruciating. The shouting of Order members looking for a desperate way to end a ritual that could not be stopped, drowned out by the sound of blood pounding in his ears.
Harry rolled his eyes. ‘Cast the detection charms, Malfoy.’
‘Of course, sir.’
Weasley tried to defend himself but gave it up as a lost cause. Which was definitely for the best, Draco was in no mood to entertain Weasley extending an olive branch. His head still hurt far too much for that sort of change to the status quo.
Would he still have spoken up at Draco’s trial if they’d been there? He liked to think he would have. But he doubted he’d have become the source of strength and support that Draco had needed if Ron and Hermione were there questioning him every step of the way.
Harry smiled, charmed by the soft words and the obvious love even if Draco sounded exasperated.
Ron and Hermione stopped their retreat to look worriedly after her. Ginny stood quickly, freeing her chair for Luna but Luna waved her away and climbed onto the bed settling by Draco’s feet. As they watched, she kicked off her shoes and brought her feet up to tuck beneath her. She had her wand in hand, twirled it in steady patterns as she studied Draco. She was looking at him with a frown as though trying to puzzle something out.
Ron nodded, doing a lot of looking about to avoid eye contact and having to acknowledge that any part of their conversation included his sister. He didn’t say anything and Harry was left trying to pick up the conversation without stepping on one of those mines.
‘Me,’ Ginny’s voice called up at him. When he looked down between his feet, he saw her moving cautiously through the rubble below, still in her quidditch leathers, wet from the rain. ‘Demelza is turning people back,’ she called up to him. ‘No one down here was hurt.’ She had her broom over her shoulder. ‘Want me to come get you?’
Harry nodded.
Draco’s most vivid memory of the day he properly met Harry Potter is of crying himself to sleep.
Draco sniggered at that; he could perfectly picture the arched brow of their late Potions professor. The snide look he’d have given her after discovering Pansy sat alone in some bushes. He much preferred that than Snape stumbling across him with his hand down some boy’s pants. Although the sour expression on his face might have been worth it.
He didn’t recognise any of the witches on the lawn but that didn’t mean they weren’t some of Voldemort’s followers. It just meant they weren’t part of his inner circle. Draco was familiar with all of those faces. They’d certainly paraded through his home often enough over that last year of Voldemort’s reign of terror.
‘I love you,’ he reminded Draco. ‘I’ll do a lot worse than a stinging hex to anyone who tries to hurt you.’
Honestly, he had been expecting it to be a stag when the creature finally emerged, but Draco thought he liked the shape that did emerge more. It was a giant dog. The kind that Harry had tattooed up his left wrist to represent his godfather. He’d been surprised – as had Harry – but his mother had cried, startling them both. She’d been the one to explain what it meant, what it represented. Sirius had done what Draco wished he’d done. When the time came, and the choice had to be made, Sirius had turned his back on the Black family, on his own family, and sought refuge with the Potters. He was the child of a pureblood family in support of Voldemort who had made the right choices, all the choices Draco wished he’d been strong enough to make.
Ron, who until then had been lounged across Lisa Turpin’s recently abandoned bed, shot up in horror. ‘He’s what?’ he sputtered.
Draco nodded and Harry, after eyeing Pansy carefully, slipped out of the booth. He and Pansy remained quiet for a moment, both watching Harry’s path across the pub and out the door – he didn’t pause to look back, the trust he had in Draco implicit in the sureness of his steps.
‘Settle down, settle down,’ Slughorn called, trying for calm and failing to achieve it.
Harry had spent hours on what should have been his day off, working to interview muggles, taking their statements before sending them on to the obliviators. He’d done a few rounds of knocking on doors and checking the closed-up businesses for people hiding from it all. Every muggle found needed to be interviewed and sent on to obliviators who erased any memory of the terrifying end their nice little Christmas festival had met. They’d no doubt replaced it with a warm fuzzy feeling and the implication the day had bled into night and it had all been a wonderful time.
Harry, Luna and Ginny all nodded. Though, again, Ginny was the one to say, ‘It wasn’t part of the war reparations like the
Ginny laughs and it might not reach her eyes, not yet, but it is a real laugh. ‘I’m so mad at you.’
It took a moment for Harry to understand what Kingsley was saying. Even then, even once the words had trickled through Harry’s brain and some sort of connection had been made, he didn’t want to understand, he couldn’t because there was no sense to take from his words.
‘What a pretty lie.’
‘Instagram,’ Hermione corrected, a little guiltily. ‘And I know,’ she agreed. ‘It’s ridiculous! What right does he have to be so fit?’
‘Fleur?’ McGonagall’s lips pursed. ‘Not Bill?’
She nodded sharply and a moment later her patronus was darting off through the wall of the castle.
But he’d been in too much pain to realise the connection – the help – was even there.
He’d used Pansy in so many different ways and he’d never realised. He’d assumed that she understood what he was doing and that she was doing the same in return. Harry and Luna had taught him what real friendship looked like and they’d been able because he’d been willing to listen, open to tearing apart his past and his behaviour with the knowledge that so many things he’d been taught and trained to do were wrong. He could look back now and see that while he’d been encouraged to manipulate and hold himself above his peers, Pansy and so many of his housemates hadn’t been – not to the same extent.
Joseph’s expression hardened. ‘Given your history, Mister Malfoy, and the reason you are back at this school, I would have thought you would be taking your studies more seriously.’
Harry sniggered.
‘The castle didn’t even have plumbing a thousand years ago,’ Hermione had pointed out. ‘I think there’s probably a lot of things about the castle that have been changed over the centuries and I don’t think it was all harmless.’
Draco nodded thoughtfully, sipping on some water. He and Pansy were taking a break from the firewhiskey. Despite Pansy’s suggestion they consume the whole bottle, there were some things Draco wanted to be sober for when he talked about them.
Draco calmly raised his hand. He wasn’t the only one. Every eighth-year student raised their hand as did a good portion of the seventh years.
Harry shut the door behind him softly, slamming it seemed like something moody fifteen-year-old Harry would do. Besides, as he walked away the paint on the walls bubbled and blistered in his wake causing a number of people to leap aside. Only when he was in the lift – alone because no one had been game to join him – did he even try to rein his power back in. He slumped back against the wall of the lift and tried not to shake in the wake of his display of power. He’d never done something like that before, never even considered using his own power like that.
‘Because you weren’t Potter?’
Draco was self-aware enough to know that he’d always found Harry attractive. Fifth year was probably when he’d truly become aware of it, but he’d been wrapped up in exploring his sexuality, in trysts with Pansy and Daphne, with exploring Blaise and stolen blow jobs from Theo in dark corners. He’d really hit his teenage stride in fifth year and realising he was attracted to the skinny spectacled git had just been interesting wank fodder and nothing more.
Harry bumped shoulders with him gently. ‘You good?’
Well, everyone but Fleur. She’d given Draco an approving look he didn’t know what to do with.
Harry shrugged. ‘I didn’t wash them off.’
Granger ignored Weasley, instead addressing her next words to both Draco and Harry. ‘If you’re up to it,’ she spoke calmly, as though she wasn’t desperately curious, ‘I’d like to hear about your summer.’
He nodded his head because that did seem like a good idea. What did not seem like a good idea was ignoring the potion Madam Pomfrey bustled out of her office to give him once she noticed he was awake. It tasted like piss and knocked him back into sleep before he’d even had time to complain about the taste.
‘We promised each other no secrets.’
‘He took up a lot of my time,’ Harry had said, and Hermione thought that might be an understatement now that she was aware of their relationship, of how it had formed. Of the little pieces of Draco that Harry had been accumulating for years.
Harry laughed. ‘That’s confidence, I think,’ he tried to explain. ‘It was sort of a shock to know that I could touch Ginny and I’d only really started to get comfortable reaching for her when I broke things off. Draco needs the reassurance,’ he stated. ‘He needs the reminder I’m here that he’s not alone in Azkaban anymore or struggling with Voldemort and what it means to be a Death Eater.’
The article printed in the day’s
. Something he would absolutely never be telling Granger.
He would gladly spend decades earning the warmth Molly shared with her hugs and the faith Arthur had that he had changed and would continue to care for Harry. He would spend the rest of his life working to show his mother she wasn’t failing him anymore, that she had given him the strength when needed and stood with him when the time came, in turning her back on Voldemort.
Draco could admit it was one of his favourite things about their relationship.
The same Bill who was working on his own time to come up to the castle to train Draco to be a curse breaker.
‘Were we ever friends?’ he wondered, turning away from the window to look at her. He wasn’t being mean, wasn’t trying to hurt her, he just genuinely didn’t know the answer to that question. Knowing what he knew now about friendship thanks to Luna, thanks to actually spending time with Harry around his friends, he didn’t think he could call what he’d had with any of the Slytherins friendship, not really. He was interested to hear how Pansy thought about their past.
Draco had no doubts that, as happy as his father was to go along with Draco’s relationship with Harry, there would not have been such a relaxed and warm atmosphere had he been present. He certainly didn’t imagine Andromeda would have come along with Teddy – let alone spent the night as she had done.
Ron, he didn’t want him (he
‘I’m getting terribly fond of her,’ Draco murmured later, after they’d dumped Luna into her bed in Ravenclaw tower and were on their way back to the eighth-year dormitories.
‘Ow!’
Harry offered up his hand without question and Draco easily laced their fingers together. He closed his eyes for a moment, tried to think about the connection he had with Harry. It didn’t suddenly flare into being, it didn’t suddenly make itself known as a pulsing entity tying them together. It was so much subtler than that. Even knowing it was there Draco could only feel the warm wash of it on the edge of his awareness. It wasn’t something he could point to and identify, it was just there, a part of him and a part of Harry all tied together.
Draco was unrepentant when he conceded, ‘Well, thirty.’
was what set the tone for the next seven years.
He could see the way Ron and Hermione were waiting for it too and that threatened to tip his anger into rage. His words, when he spoke, were sharp, dripping with power. ‘Say that again.’
If only Draco had known then what the war would force him to become. If only then, he’d known just how much worse it would become. If only he’d known that night on the Astronomy Tower what it would mean for Voldemort to truly have power over him and not just the threat of death hanging over his parents. If only he’d known then what he was truly capable of.
Well, Ron had. Hermione had that look on her face that said she was letting him put her off for now, but they would be talking about it later.
Professor Joseph may have missed the war, but he hadn’t missed the rumours and the stories about Harry Potter. It was obvious Harry’s response had swung Joseph’s opinion of Harry firmly into the negative. It was easy to take Harry’s attitude and words and assume (if you didn’t know him) that he was arrogant, stuck up and relishing his fame. Draco knew how easy it was to believe that, he’d been one of those people for years and while Harry wasn’t exactly giving the best first impression, Draco had watched Joseph slowly starting to alter his opinion of him thanks to the rumours and tales of his exploits with the Death Eaters during the war. It didn’t surprise him in the least that he was quick to form an opinion of Harry. It wouldn’t surprise him if he was just as quick to change that opinion either.
Draco waved his hand dismissively, ignoring Hermione’s startled gasp. ‘It was fine.’
Dumbledore had known from the very beginning what Draco had been tasked with. He’d arranged it with Snape to finish the task so that Draco wouldn’t have to. Once, the knowledge that Dumbledore had asked Snape to kill him so Draco wouldn’t have to, had been enough. It wasn’t now. Now he saw the damage that year had done to Draco. Now he saw how a year under pressure from Voldemort had broken something in Draco. Now he could see how alone Draco had been, how scared, how hopeless. He saw that boy in the bathroom and compared him to the same excited (arogant) boy he’d met all those years ago in Madam Malkins’ and Harry cried.
‘I know.’
Not with Ginny.
Along the way, Harry would come to learn he’d chosen wrong and maybe, when that time came, Draco would accept his apologies and they would develop the sort of reciprocal relationship that two wealthy influential people should have.
Draco slumped against his pillows in relief and then made a face that had Harry rolling his eyes and summoning more pillows from the next bed. He poked and prodded them into position behind Draco until they were perfect and then settled back down at the end of the bed, this time taking both feet into his lap. The way they were sticking out from the blankets suggested Madam Pomfrey had left them uncovered for observation.
‘Uh – yes. Yes, I’ll – Harry and I – we’ll take the baby,’ Draco manages to say.
Ron or Hermione to understand him.
‘Oh, shut up,’ Harry snapped lightly. ‘Once we put Sesha’s tail out and rescued the pygmy puffs we had to go and put the house out.’ Harry was starting to sound less annoyed the more he talked and more amused.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up; he’d not heard
‘You have blood runes permanently spelled into your skin!’ Hermione had hissed back.
mad) and what it was doing now to his father, not to mention what Harry had said about Sirius’ experience. He didn’t think that keeping Azkaban as it was fit with the changes the wizarding world needed to make in order to properly bring it away from the atmosphere that had created room for Voldemort in the first place.
Awkward silence fell over the breakfast table which Luna broke when she sat gracefully down on Draco’s other side and leant her head against his arm – she was just a bit short to flop it dramatically onto Draco’s shoulder as Harry had done. Glancing down at her, Draco could see she was exhausted, he didn’t need the enormous yawn to tell him, the dark circles under her eyes were a dead giveaway.
‘Just a bit,’ Draco agreed.
Draco could only nod. He didn’t know how or why or, Salazar, even who, but someone had put wand to Dark Mark and the call was burning through Draco with a pain he had never before felt from the Mark. He could feel it tugging at him as it had once done, urging him to disappear from the warmth and welcome of the Burrow and reappear somewhere else, but never had it burned with such a ferocity that Draco feared his arm would soon catch fire, muscle and bone blackening to a charred mess.
Ron looked exceedingly uncomfortable, gaze averted so as not to witness the tender moment between Harry and Draco. He was leaning his side against the ward McGonagall had placed on Draco’s door, still clearly a sign he wasn’t welcome. He couldn’t come in without an invite or a key to the wards and rather than leaving like Harry had expected him to do (would have preferred him to do) when he’d dismissed him earlier, it looked like Ron had stood there, patiently waiting for them to get clean.
He woke to blistering warmth, layers of warm blankets and the presence of a solid male body wrapped around his own. When he opened his eyes the soft sunlight didn’t burn, it didn’t come through a tiny window by the floor but a series of windows taking up two walls and the clear sight of sky and forest.
‘I don’t think any of us do,’ Draco whispered into Harry’s hair. ‘We all expected him to be angry about it being me, but he loves you – his brother is bloody gay!’
It certainly helped that the shrewd look she was now giving Harry suggested she was realising there were things she didn’t know about her friend that Draco did. She was studying Harry as she might have studied an interesting problem in Ancient Runes. She didn’t like that Draco was forcing her to consider her own actions and she didn’t like that she was hearing evidence that Harry and Draco talked about everything – how else could he have known about the Polyjuice incident? – and she’d had no idea that their relationship, whatever she’d thought it had been, was something she hadn’t seen or understood.
Draco sighed tiredly, it had already been a long day and looked to be getting only longer. ‘Don’t worry about dinner, we’ll sort it out when you get home.’
As he chewed, he was studying Draco with a frown, eventually blurting out, ‘What are you wearing?’
Draco shrugged off the blanket and darted on quick toes across the icy floor. He paused to call back over his shoulder, ‘I’m sure we can get another workout in while we shower.’
‘I’m not under a spell,’ Harry snapped.
Draco would, and he could not stress this enough, tear the world apart to protect Harry, he didn’t understand how Snape hadn’t done the same for Lily.
‘What, all of it?’ Ron had a look of complete bewilderment on his face as though he’d never heard anything stranger.
‘Good at what?’ Draco asked, glancing at her distractedly. Working with Astoria had taken up more time than he would have liked and now he was running late to meet with Harry and Luna for dinner. Such a shame he’d run out of time to drag out his Arithmancy homework. Not that the two of them wouldn’t understand, but he’d skipped lunch in favour of completing his Ancient Runes homework (he’d eaten a sandwich tucked away in the library to avoid Madam Pomfrey’s wrath and Pince’s should she have found him), he wasn’t about to skip out on dinner too, especially when they were heading out of the castle for once, rather than hiding away in the kitchens or taking up a corner of the Slytherin or Ravenclaw tables.
Draco rolled his eyes, ignoring the way Harry was trying to supress a laugh and failing miserably. ‘You knew that already.’
‘I’m going to get us captured. You need to put up a fight, make it look good but do not – absolutely do not – get away.’
Draco wondered how he would have felt about it. He’d made no secret of his feelings for Harry over the years, the truth of his feelings that is, once he and Harry had truly begun to get along. He might have thought he was a power-hungry, attention-starved, fame-seeker once upon a time but the impression had been born from hurt and arrogance. He hadn’t much believed his own words by third year but by then it was the only way he knew to get Harry’s attention and he’d always liked having Harry’s attention.
If Draco ever met the Dursleys he was sure he’d curse them bad enough to land himself back in Azkaban. It might be worth it. Of course, some of the blame – perhaps a lot of the blame – with the loneliness and despair of Harry’s childhood could be placed in Dumbledore’s hands. The old man was someone else Draco wished he could curse. Some days, listening to the things Harry had to put up with because of the old man’s plots and schemes, Draco seriously regretted not killing him on the Astronomy Tower. It wouldn’t change things for Harry, couldn’t change the way he grew up a pawn in Dumbledore’s long and protracted war against Voldemort, but for that fleeting moment as he imagined the satisfaction of ending a life that had caused Harry so much pain, it was almost worth it.
‘The one of you licking Harry’s neck is still my favourite,’ Ginny grinned.
‘Anything I can do to help?’
As he tilted one of the rings this way and that to read the inscription in full, he realised the rings were old, very old. And familiar. He had to dig back through four years of Ancient Runes to translate the markings but when he did, he gasped, their meaning connecting to a story he’d heard his mother tell him as a child.
Harry huffed but went on as though he hadn’t just been insulted. ‘We’re set to do the ritual on Friday at Hogwarts,’ Harry informed him. ‘You need to take the cloak. I can switch out most of the spell components without anyone noticing but you’ll need to take Ginny’s place at the last moment for this to work.’
‘The incantation is simple enough,’ Joseph began. He demonstrated to the class the basic wand movement and correct pronunciation. Draco was sure he was the only one who caught the narrowing of Joseph’s eyes when he realised Harry wasn’t paying any attention to him, rather he was rubbing at a smudge on his wand with the pad of his thumb.
By the time Ron was done filling out his paper and had wandered over to fetch Harry, he’d been ready to thump his friend. The glare their goblin escort kept shooting back at him over his shoulder didn’t help improve his mood. They seemed to think because he wasn’t with Draco, he was there to cause trouble. Oh, they were still letting Ron act as his escort, but they were making clear they weren’t happy to have Harry wandering around the depths of their bank no matter how much gold he banked with them – or how much influence he had over Draco.
Hermione nodded in understanding. ‘I’m still not telling Ron, that’s something you’re going to have to do.’ She pondered his words a little more before she added, ‘He’s going to need more time.’
The day had been going wrong from the very beginning. She and Ron had only been back in England for three days – cutting it fine – and it was as though one thing after another had conspired to make this the most difficult move they’d ever experienced. Although she did suppose it was the only one. The first move to Australia to be with her parents had been almost accidental. They’d gone to see what could be done and then things had been hard and gotten harder and suddenly four years had gone by and they had a life in Australia.
Harry looked up at that and frowned. Draco too looked at her, realising she had a point. As it stood, the houses didn’t have the room to house the retuning eighth years, how would they make room for hundreds more students?
and he wanted to remember what they had become in spite of all they’d been through. It was
Draco was the one to break the kiss, slumping into Harry as he did so until his forehead rested on Harry’s shoulder. ‘I need to sleep. Preferably for a week.’
‘Yes,’ agreed Harry (and Pomfrey). ‘Can you get Harriet out?’
hate me,’ Draco repeated. ‘She
Harry was still poking through a drawer full of rings (none of them the pair he was looking for) so he didn’t see the strange look come over Ron and therefore didn’t quite grasp his meaning when he said, ‘You like her.’
Somehow, in realising his feelings for Harry, Draco had failed to remember that while Harry had been steadily helping Draco put himself back together, he’d been doing the same for Harry. While Draco had struggled to come back from Azkaban and the things he’d done in the war, Harry was drowning in loss and guilt for things he had no control over. While Harry taught Draco how to be a better man, strengthening the traits Luna had witnessed in the Manor’s dungeon, while he helped Draco build back the strength needed to stand on his own two feet, he’d been offering Harry something just as valuable in return.
It wasn’t and Draco had been wondering the same thing. It was one thing to send him the numbers so he and his mother and aunt could make appropriate changes to their plans for Burbage Hall, but it was another thing entirely to expect him to swoop in and fix Hogwarts.
‘Do what?’ he asked, glancing between them. ‘What are you talking about?’
Longbottom might have developed some confidence since killing Nagini with the Sword of Gryffindor, but he seemed to have reverted back to the nervous round kid, Draco had so much fun tormenting.
It had been the first time they’d had sex in months, the last time in – he wracks his brains – another two. Sex has become such a distant part of his relationship with Ginny and at first, before Draco (was that a thing? Harry wasn’t sure there was a before, Draco was just – he was the biggest a part of Harry’s life and had been for so long) it had been because she was away for work and if she wasn’t then he was – pulling surveillance duty or the overnight shift. They’d both become ships passing in the night, surviving on notes and half-asleep murmurings and empty assurances that things would settle again, and they’d find the time.
‘Hold on, does this mean you’re not going to be going through training with me come August?’ he asked, frowning at Harry.
He went down to breakfast with his mood lighter than it had been in weeks, not even disappointed when he glanced over at the Gryffindor table to see no sign of Harry. McGonagall wasn’t at the staff table either and Draco assumed (correctly) that the two were up in her office.
‘I don’t see why not. There are plenty of muggleborns and even magical students who don’t have the best homes and just as many families who would happily take in those students. You never had to live the way you did Harry; I hope you know that Dumbledore was wrong to leave you there and a lot of other people were wrong for standing back and letting it happen.’
‘He’s a Death Eater,’ the junior auror replied in a tone that suggested he was stating the obvious.
Draco had laughed then in the library and now he took her affection with good humour, not even feeling remotely disturbed to realise he was happy to return her affection. He liked Ginny, had watched her enough over the years as she hovered on the periphery of the Golden Trio that, now that he was with Harry, he could view those moments of observation objectively to see how strong Ginny was. Who else could have fought off Voldemort at the tender age of eleven?
‘I heard he’s got an interesting story about shapeshifting serpents.’
Maybe he and Ron would be friends again someday, Harry didn’t know and wasn’t going to say it may never happen, because Ron had been a massive part of his life and still was in that he was a Weasley and the Weasleys were Harry’s family. But he didn’t need Ron and he understood that if that were ever to happen then it wasn’t him who had to change, it wasn’t about him accepting apologies and welcoming Ron back.
His pride and his arrogance and his truly (he saw it now) abhorrent beliefs carried him right through until the summer before fourth year when things began to change. Not a lot, little things really – a hushed conversation between his parents that changed the mood in the Manor. Strange visitors after the World Cup and longer absences, missed dinners and furtive conversations with people Father would never normally associate with but could be relied upon (for the right price) to provide the kind of information necessary to maintain one’s position and get ahead. Absolutely nothing happened that changed the way Draco felt about his father and his family and his place in the wizarding world.
Thankfully, before either of them did something they’d rather not do in public (Draco felt like his list of these things was ever shrinking, especially when Harry was looking at him like that), Longbottom broke the silence.
In response, Granger let out a sound that was somewhere between a laugh and a sob and Harry was by her side in an instant wrapping his arms around her and drawing her close. He made soothing noises, nonsense tumbling from his mouth as he tried – and seemingly failed – to calm her down.
Please let me know your thoughts!
He’d experienced the muggle world. Spent three days with Harry exploring muggle London, learning things he’d never considered before, all in the name of fixing Harry’s wardrobe and showing the Ministry he was willing to change. He’d enjoyed the ability to walk around without being spat on or without fear of being cursed but it hadn’t been the same. It really was just running away, and Draco refused to be the kind of man who ran from his problems.
And it was horrible that the return of his best friends had taken that feeling from him.
‘You’re exaggerating,’ Hermione said. ‘But not by much,’ she added. ‘I’ve looked but there don’t seem to be any proper wizarding universities in Britain.’
‘You wouldn’t have left me,’ Harry informed him, which Draco thought was terrible naïve of Harry. Eleven-year-old Draco would absolutely have left Harry. ‘You are braver than you give yourself credit for,’ Harry loyally defended.
‘So Scorp set the house on fire,’ Harry stated drawing Ron’s attention. Though only briefly. Because. Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.
‘You’re doing so much,’ Hermione pointed out. ‘You’ve got private auror training, actual raids, you’ve got all your homework done, flown with Draco, you’re taking WSL lessons with Luna and I know you and Draco are trading auror and curse breaker spells – when do you sleep?’
They’d been arguing about it all week, Draco had made his opinion known, he didn’t want Harry throwing away his future over something Draco deserved. Harry had pointed out Draco was his future and that had softened Draco enough to end the argument that time. This time, that argument wouldn’t work. Especially not with Ron and Hermione looking between them, waiting for someone to start explaining Draco’s vehemence against the idea of Harry helping with interhouse unity.
That had lasted about an hour.
Kreacher pushed the hovering tray of food toward them and Draco dutifully set aside the papers he was reading so that Kreacher could rest it in his lap. After a moment of disapproving scowling, Hermione did the same. She glanced warily at Kreacher after looking at the contents of her tray and frowned, tilting her head to the side to study the elf as he set Harry’s dinner tray on the bed, waggling his fingers over it until a dome of warming magic settled over the plate and smacking a paw that shot out from beneath the duvet in hopes of snagging some of Harry’s dinner.
Longbottom grinned. ‘Don’t die,’ he offered cheerfully before he started off across the Entrance Hall.
‘Are you fucking serious right now?’
‘How can you stay in a world full of magic and wonder and never be able to experience it truly?’ Harry put to her softly. ‘How do you look at something so wonderful and know of its existence but never truly get to experience it? How do you let something like that go? How do you watch as the children you grew up with – your friends – go off to Hogwarts and learn magic while you have to go off and live in the muggle world?’
Draco had been keeping a list of the weird ways his and Harry’s magic interacted, starting with the way they could switch wands at a whim building up to the way Harry’s accidental magic could shield him and now it would need to include the way his magic latched on to Harry’s, was welcomed by Harry’s, until it could exist with his in such a way as the runes on his neck.
Draco grinned. ‘Oh, are you finally growing up?’ he teased.
He’d almost finished his little speech, only had the last bit about assignments to go, when his eyes skimmed over a head of dark messy hair. He clocked the hair as belonging to the auror he’d seen shirtless putting some recruits through their paces, and his eyes moved on.
The interesting bits were three pages dedicated to Draco’s wardrobe.
‘Tiny lenses you put on your eyes instead of wearing glasses,’ Hermione explained.
Those sixty-eight hours could have been when it all started.
‘No, I don’t,’ Harry countered, crossing his arms. ‘I’ve got the time.’ And Hermione had a good point about interhouse unity and erasing prejudice.
Harry grinned. ‘He said something about Italian.’
‘That encompasses all of us?’ That was thirty people, fifteen pairs all line up evenly spaced along the furthest boundary of the Carrow property.
‘Oh, for the love of Merlin,’ Draco muttered. ‘Granger, please do tell us what had you so upset so we can go upstairs and have sex before breakfast.’
Draco drew the wand out of his pocket and showed it to Harry, wrinkling his nose at it in distaste. ‘It’s hardly worth keeping.’
Ordinarily, that would be the only thing those tattoos would mean but now, tracing the dragon of stars and thinking about the runes on Harry’s neck, Draco was starting to think there was a lot more between them than either of them had realised. Instead of the magic running out and the blood flaking, Harry’s own magic seemed to be powering the runes. His magic had accepted Draco’s, welcomed it even, to the point where it was working to power the marks Draco had placed on Harry’s skin with his blood – a possibly permanent protection against certain wards.
‘Harry and I talked about getting married the other day,’ he told her quietly, thoughtfully.
He didn’t have any expectations for how she’d react – anger probably – and she is angry, he can see that but her first response is to laugh. He only sees the anger, reads the bitterness in her eyes when she turns to look at him and says, ‘I’m pregnant.’
‘There’s been a complication.’
Bill had once described the way he experienced wards as a spiderweb of spellwork that he needed to carefully disassemble. It wasn’t tangible to him, not really, a ward for Bill was just a feeling, the web a way for his mind to interpret the magic he was working with. Draco wasn’t so lucky. His newly developed sensitivity to magic (prolonged torture had such
And, ugh, the idea that he’d just thought the words “safe” and “Weasley” in the same sentence was almost as horrifying as the man’s face.
Draco walked impassively over to his aunt’s lifeless body and snatched away the wands she had on her. He tossed Harry’s back to him – who caught it easily – as he made his way toward his mother.
He frowned at Harry and tilted his head – Harry took that to be about the choice of breakfast location – and Harry shrugged. The wrinkle of Ron’s nose that followed was definitely directed at Harry’s and Draco’s attire (which was directly linked to the eating at the Hufflepuff table, not that Ron needed to know Draco had pushed himself too far on his first run since he’d been injured and so they’d both just dropped down at the nearest table).
Merlin, he really hoped Ron did some of those things for Hermione, hoped she did them in return. He wanted his friends’ relationship to last, he didn’t want it to implode over something so small and stupid as taking each other for granted. His thoughts merged with Ron’s own concerns from just the day before about sex and Hermione finding someone better and Harry couldn’t help feeling that Ron and Hermione were in for some shaky times if they didn’t start talking about these things.
‘Someone triggered one of the wards around the Galahad Estate, Potter,’ she informed Harry. ‘Malfoy’s on his way but he says, and I quote, “if this is that same arsehole kid again I’m going to string him up by his ankles and gut him” but he also said it’s a bit early for the McClean boy to be out of bed so could you send Rasika along if you’re done with the kid because,’ this part she said with a distinct roll of her eyes, ‘he could use the spell fodder.’
Arthur Weasley was waiting for him. He offered Harry a cheerful smile which turned to a chuckle when he noticed Harry’s expression. ‘Ah. Well, Draco did say he’d trick you if he had to.’ Arthur sounded wholly unperturbed that Draco Malfoy had tricked Harry Potter into wearing a portkey which told Harry several things, most of which just made him more annoyed.
Draco, despite how nice it was to know they cared, did not think this justified taking up residence in his bed before eight o’clock in the bloody morning. ‘Where’s Harry?’ he asked instead of pointing that out because he knew exactly how far that would get him with Ginny Weasley.
‘You know that’s not always possible.’
Harry snorted into his pillow and shifted around to get more comfortable. A sudden soft thump at the foot of the bed announced Athena had decided to join them for the night. For something so small she certainly weighed enough, as she stalked across Draco’s feet to squish herself into the small gap between them. Being only half kneazle didn’t seem to be slowing down her growth and Draco expected that, given time, she’d grow to be just as big – if not bigger – than Granger’s grumpy looking mess of fur. Merlin knew what kind of pedigree Crookshanks had but Athena came from a proper breeder and a lineage to be proud of.
He would choose Draco over just about anyone and he wasn’t sure how to explain that to a Hermione and Ron who hadn’t seen what he’d seen. How did he explain it to friends who hadn’t been there to witness it?
Honestly, how was anyone supposed to top that?
This was going to take a lot of research and for just a moment Draco wished he was still the self-absorbed arrogant and entitled prick who didn’t much care about anything that didn’t directly affect him. Life was much simpler. For the three years he’d lived that way. The war had truly been eye opening and dear Merlin, he’d been such a snotty brat. But caring about things had brought him Harry and Luna and allowed him the chance to get to know Aunt Andromeda and Teddy and if that meant he lost another hour of sleep a night until this was done then that was a price Draco was willing to pay.
‘It’s my faut you’re not getting any sleep!’
‘I didn’t. Draco kept stealing my glasses during practice duels, said if he could do it while I was expecting it anyone could when I wasn’t. I’ve been taking this eyesight potion every day to correct my vision.’
The look of compassionate understanding in Molly’s eyes spoke volumes and he got the feeling she knew more about what was between him and Draco than she let on, long before she knew the truth. Harry had clearly underestimated Ginny (wouldn’t be the first time) because she frowned once Ron had finished his explanation and said, ‘I thought they weren’t allowed to start this until he’d finished at Hogwarts?’
If the potion hadn’t claimed him then he might have been offended by the way she patted his head and smiled. He might have been annoyed by her eye roll and exasperated huff. He might even have caught the same eye roll from McGonagall and the confused look on Granger’s face (Weasley was still staring angrily at his tattoos).
Draco sniggered again, moving back properly onto the bed and shoving the pillow under his head. He turned so he could watch Harry limp around as he felt around for the duvet, suddenly all too aware that the late October air was more than just a bit chilly even with the fire crackling gently away and filling the room with soft a soft amber glow.
He liked her boots.
And then she learned what it was Draco had been doing while she and Ron had been in Australia. Three months in Azkaban. How he’d nearly died in a holding cell at the Ministry at the hands of aurors. How Harry had been to visit him every single day he was in Azkaban and spent time with him when he was out.
It was enough for Draco to realise she didn’t. Not really. Not like everyone else had. It was why there’d been no emotional response to it, why she continued to research it when the rest of them had just accepted it. The bond was based on something she couldn’t quantify and created from a magic she didn’t understand that she was still trying to research and make sense of – but that she would never be able to make sense of and she’d certainly never be able to pin it down to explain it away in the scientific manner she desperately needed to.
Draco blinked at him for a moment in incomprehension, simply staring at him and trying to make sense of what the man with the dragonhide protective clothing was trying to tell him. Fleur was dressed for work too, although she looked as though she’d slipped her heavily warded work jacket on over a set of boring cotton pyjamas.
No. He wouldn’t let that happen.
and finally set things right with Pansy (and Blaise and Theo and Daphne even) and learn WSL just to talk with Astoria to be there for her when he’d failed so spectacularly before. He could work with the Ministry and build a school and repair Hogwarts and love Harry.
‘It’s not a yes,’ Draco snapped.
‘I was!’ Draco complained. ‘Fuck, put some socks on, your feet are like ice!’
The vault was quiet while Ron mulled this over and then he surprised Harry by saying, ‘And now you like Pansy.’
‘You know,’ Hermione told him, somewhat wryly, ‘this new you is a lot more aware of his own emotions.’
Longbottom opened and closed his mouth a few times, still seeming unable to actually voice the words he’d planned to say. ‘Rebecca Kemp,’ he eventually blurted out, cheeks such a deep shade of red they were verging on purple.
He’d only been called on three times in the two months since Azkaban but each time he’d returned weak, shaky and twice with curse injuries Madam Pomfrey had struggled to heal.
‘Not now, Ron,’ he snapped, and, in his frustration, it was a lot less sharp than he would have been if he’d been wholly focused on his ex-best friend and not the potential for Draco to burst into flames. His magic popped ahead of him to open their bedroom door because his hands were scrambling to undress Draco as he pushed him inside.
‘I don’t want to do the paperwork,’ Draco informed him.
In all honestly, coming out to the Weasleys had been easy. They’d been supportive, loving, and most importantly, they’d been around for it. They’d been there when he raged about the unfairness of the Death Eaters not receiving proper trials. They’d been around to watch Harry disappear off to Azkaban every day and they’d seen him testify for Draco and Narcissa. They might not have known what was happening at first but once he’d laid it out for them, they’d understood (mostly) and been very accepting.
And that wasn’t from a place of muggle-hating pureblood bullshit.
‘Potter!’
‘I got a rough idea,’ Harry replied. He shot a spell into the air and Draco watched as it sped toward the sky only to smack directly into an unseen force and dissipate against it.
Harry nodded, as though he’d suspected as much. ‘Fair enough. Do you care about Draco?’
The smallest bedroom at Number 4 Privet Drive looked the same as it always did in the summer. The small bed shoved in amongst Dudley’s broken toys, the wardrobe that contained the small amount of clothing Harry owned – none of which was in his size. It was hot and stuffy in the room, little breeze coming in through the window he’d pushed open a fraction. Harry lay on his bed, wondering what tomorrow would bring.
‘No,’ Harry agreed. ‘But I can make them think twice about hurting you.’
‘There are things you need to know, things I think we need to talk about,’ he begins. ‘I need to say this, and I hope you understand why when I’m done – but Gin, I need you to hear me out and then I promise I’ll listen to whatever you want to tell me.’
Charlie made a keening sound of devastation deep in his throat and beside him the witch – Marigold, she’d introduced herself – let rip a string of Tamil that Harry didn’t need to understand to recognise as emphatic profanity.
‘I know what it cost him,’ Draco had told her quietly, no trace of anger in his tone. He had allowed a little of the awe he felt to creep in, he’d thought she’d appreciate seeing that he did understand and appreciate just what those visits cost Harry.
The cleansing of the Ministry had eliminated quite a few people sympathetic to Voldemort and even more who thought their pureblood ideals should continue the plan to remove muggleborns. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement had survived the cleansing with half-bloods, returned muggleborns and the sort of purebloods who wouldn’t turn up on a list of acceptable visitors in a home owned and cared for by the Carrows.
They were the first to arrive and were directed to a nice well-lit booth toward the back. it wasn’t the sort of place Ron would have picked, more pub than restaurant the more he looked about, although the fancy upscale kind you had to book for – apparently.
He’d always known more about Harry’s family than Harry had – years and years of learning pureblood ties and histories had left him with a firm understanding of who was who in the wizarding world, but he’d gotten even more of an understanding since he’d started digging about for information for Harry and he’d known at once who he was looking at, even before he saw the tiny inscription on the back.
Draco’s teaching style involved doing the complete opposite of what his Aunt Bella had done and it seemed to be working out just fine. He did the same when he was tutoring students. He started patiently with the basics, made sure everyone had a firm grasp on them and then slowly showed why those skills were necessary and how they translated to Potions or Transfiguration – or in the case of Astoria, Charms. Essentially, he did the complete opposite of how Snape had taught them too, it seemed to be working out alright. No one had complained yet and they all seemed to be picking things up relatively quickly.
‘Oh, I’m definitely getting special treatment.’ Draco let those words lie for a moment before he said, ‘I didn’t mean for that to sound suggestive.’
You’re not going to let Harry donate all his money, are you?’ she checked with him, breaking the comfortable silence.
Released from the spell keeping him frozen and concealed, Harry tossed aside the cloak, grabbed Draco by the front of his robes and pressed an urgent, fierce, kiss to his lips.
And Draco laughed, the sound warm and soft and not at all mocking as he dropped a kiss on Harry’s nose and replied, ‘You’re alright, I suppose.’
Draco sighed with exaggerated dreaminess. ‘So much gold,’ he murmured. ‘So very many shiny things.’
‘What?!’ Ron’s eyes bugged out and he started sputtering, holding his sides in a wheezing laugh. ‘What?’
‘That’s not – I didn’t mean,’ Weasley sputtered.
Draco thought he might have broken Hermione.
‘I am genuinely impressed,’ he admitted.
‘Can we access the other floors?’ Sinistra questioned, peering up at the floor above only to be met with Flitwick peering down at her. ‘Hello, Filius,’ she called up quietly, ‘please be wary of the blood curse.’
After all this time, after so much pain and destruction, the death of Tom Riddle was a bit anticlimactic.
‘Are we?’ Harry countered.
‘There really isn’t a lot you can do in a cell in Azkaban and so we talked – about everything. Draco and I have always known a lot of things about each other – all those stupid things you can’t help learning about someone when you spend all of your time staring at them.’ He ignored Hermione’s amused laugh and carried on talking. ‘But there was a lot we didn’t know and so much I wanted to know. I don’t know how it started exactly but once we started talking it was really hard to stop. Like I wanted to know everything about Draco – and he wanted to know everything about me.
‘Fuck sorry,’ Ginny says and despite the fact that she just threw a mug at his head she does actually sound sorry. ‘It was a reflex.’
Draco nodded slowly, thoughtfully. ‘That makes sense. As much as anything Luna says can.’
Harry never even noticed. He simply went where Draco went and was perfectly content for that to be first in the line of fire.
Hermione looked absolutely delighted by the prospect and hurried to put together a sandwich she could take with her before she skuttled off with McGonagall to make the necessary arrangements. While she waited for Hermione, the headmistress bestowed an apologetic look on Draco.
‘He’s got skills and he’s smart, with some proper training he might survive and prove himself useful.’
Bewildered, Hermione asked, ‘Why?’
‘That’s when we gave up on you, you know.’ Pansy said it bluntly, as though that would somehow take the edge of hurt off the revelation. Not that it was much of a revelation.
‘I thought we had a no legilimency rule for the breakfast table?’ Although the words had come from Luna, they sounded so eerily like his mother that both he and Harry could only stare at her.
‘This whole thing is fascinating,’ Hermione agreed. ‘I can’t find anything in any of the books I’ve read that talks about a bond like this.’
Mostly.
The people still working on the castle now were all Ministry employed or contracted and had been through vigorous checks before they’d been allowed to continue working with students around. They might have been house elves with how little Draco had seen of the final restoration team. Actually, there was a good chance some of them
Draco shrugged.
He didn’t think the room he and Harry shared was much bigger, but it probably looked it given there was only one bed and that Draco had crammed one wall full of bookshelves that he and Harry had steadily been filling over the last few months. They had a full-sized fireplace as well which, together with the rug Draco had taken from Grimmauld and had restored, made the room look cosy and inviting and hardly like a school dormitory at all. Which made sense given that this had once been a suite for married teachers. It certainly looked like the suite of a couple. His and Harry’s clothes hung together in the wardrobe, there was only one trunk stood at the foot of the bed – Draco’s much larger one which was filled with extra blankets, random things that didn’t have a home elsewhere and all that remained of Harry’s life before the war.
‘Yeah but Draco brewed it, so I didn’t have to do more than supply the ingredients.’
Which, okay, he probably shouldn’t have said, but he’d wanted Hermione to understand that he was okay, that he was surrounded by people who loved him and that meant that watching Ron walk out of his life hurt but it didn’t leave a gaping tear in his heart like it had every other time he’d left.
‘Of course, Mister Malfoy.’ The goblin bowed and stepped back toward the cart to make it happen.
‘Yeah,’ Harry drawled, ‘I’m not touching on that one.’ He shook his head, apparently marvelling at Draco’s nerve, before he turned his attention to Longbottom who seemed to have lost some of his nerves in the face of his and Harry’s (admittedly) pointless squabbling. ‘Also, bi. Probably.’
He couldn’t say all that in front of Granger though, it wasn’t his place to question just why none of them had thought to question the years of abuse and neglect Harry had suffered. It was his place to make sure Harry knew he was loved and that nothing like that would ever happen to him again.
Draco looked up at Harry and for a moment he looked fine, tired and sore but fine, and then his expression crumpled and he started to cry. Harry wriggled up the bed a bit until he could wrap Draco in his arms and simply held him, whispering nonsense words and stroking his hair, offering what comfort he could.
Weasley made a sound of disbelief. ‘You could have fooled me,’ he said. ‘You’re always hugging her and kissing her.’
It was thoughts like that, though, that underlined to Harry how uncomfortable he’d been sharing his thoughts and feelings with Hermione and Ron. How he’d always felt the need to be brave and strong and how he’d struggled just to make sense of what he was thinking and feeling. Hermione had once told Ron he had the emotional range of a teaspoon all while she’d had to explain how Cho was feeling because Harry just didn’t understand. It had taken him a long time to realise he didn’t understand because he didn’t care enough to try and even if he had, he’d have had to understand his own feelings first long before he could try and make sense of Cho’s.
There was an upside, however. The presence of the Mark on the arm of a free Death Eater gave the recovering Ministry the chance to properly rid the world of all the threats Voldemort and his followers left behind. Oh, the Ministry’s curse breakers may have been able to break through eventually but doing so would likely have destroyed any evidence left behind. Draco provided a unique opportunity, and, in his position, he couldn’t say no.
He remembered shouting for Kreacher. Remembered demanding he get help, remembered the sharp crack of Kreacher leaving and the soft cry Madam Pomfrey gave that somehow sounded louder in the cell than the return crack of Kreacher’s apparation.
‘Andy,’ Harry confirmed when he asked. ‘I don’t even know how we ended up talking about it.’ He sounded embarrassed now. As though talking about his feelings with someone who considered him family was something he should be ashamed of.
he jumped in front of Draco and shoved him aside. Harry kissed him gently (reassuringly) in response. They were okay, they were both okay, a few burns here and there but nothing that a little bit of George’s burn paste wouldn’t fix – and he knew Madam Pomfrey had a skin graft lotion that would help ease whatever trauma he’d caused his legs.
Draco pulled a face that definitely did not match Weasley’s. ‘No. You’re dismissed. Run along.’
Harry’s blood protection leftover from his mother’s sacrifice might have been something else they had to conceal but after talking it through with Harry, Draco wasn’t sure it had ever existed outside of that first encounter with a possessed Quirrell. Dumbledore’s insistence that Lily Potter’s sacrifice was tied to her blood didn’t really hold with the fact that the moment Harry left the Dursley’s, that first September, he’d stopped considering Privet Drive home. Petunia Dursley had never sheltered Harry with love, she’d never given Harry a safe and nurturing home. Why shouldn’t Harry have turned that feeling on Hogwarts itself and then later on the Burrow where the Weasley’s cared for and loved him as one of their own?
Almost ruining the mood entirely, Harry started with, ‘I had a weird dream after Fred’s funeral about marrying Ginny.’
The words were wrong and strange coming from the snarling face of sixteen-year-old Draco, but they were soft and familiar, and they tugged at a part of Harry, pulling on a piece of his very soul until Malfoy was Draco and the figure hovering above him was crouching now and soft fingers were threading through Harry’s hair as whispered words of love and comfort dragged him out of –
It didn’t last, of course it couldn’t, but for that brief moment before he’d opened his mouth and let his pride get in the way, he’d felt properly safe for the first time in such a long time.
Hermione had sorted that one out and Sprout, who had witnessed the clean-up, suggested in a friendly tone that perhaps they shouldn’t be gossiping about things they didn’t understand. She’d patted Harry on the shoulder and told him Draco would be just fine, leaving him feeling rather fond of her but Ron rather confused.
‘I still own everything my parents had,’ Harry admitted. ‘It’s going to take months just to sort it all out.’
Yet somehow it was worse that Granger
He’d always wanted to be the one.
‘No, you can’t,’ Harry reminded him gently. ‘Come on, lets dry off and go to bed.’
Draco wasn’t sure he liked being spoken of as though he wasn’t even there, but he let it go in the interest of keeping the peace. Besides, he always liked to hear how Harry answered the question. It seemed to vary depending on who they were talking to. When his mother had asked the question of Harry, she’d given him such a stern look Harry had alarmingly stuttered out a declaration of love. When he’d had a rather ill-timed encounter with Bill (sans clothing, with a plate stacked high with food), he’d turned so red Draco had been regaled with a delightful description that had included various fruits and the phrase “love of my life”.
Ron paled beneath his freckles as Harry’s eyes locked on his before they flicked back to Draco. He didn’t have the energy to keep arguing, he just wanted Draco to be okay. It had been petty to throw Ron’s own words back at him and it didn’t make Harry feel better, but he wanted Ron to understand. He wanted his oldest friend to realise that he was wrong and that those words he’d said after Harry’s first lesson back had a real impact. That they were more than just words being bandied about because there were people out there with the influence to give a throwaway comment like Ron’s real and devastating power.
Harry smiled tenderly, reaching past Draco to tough the gauntlet, right where Draco had been moments before. ‘This feeling? You make me feel more than that just sitting next to me in class taking notes. This spell could not make
For Ron and Hermione, who had been on the other side of the world, the war had ended with the death of Voldemort and the funerals to lay their loved ones to rest. But, for Harry and the rest who had been here, who had been dealing with the aftermath, the war dragged on longer. There were trials and repairs, there was a school to rebuild and a Ministry to clean up. There were Death Eaters to still hunt down and people who needed healing. There were broken people and pieces that needed to be picked up and sometimes it was dark and painful and other times it was beautiful – like new growth in spring.
Although, not having it out could lead to Draco not having to share Harry with his friends and that was hardly an unpleasant concept. He really had liked having Harry mostly to himself over the summer. Luna was easy to share him with, she seemed to understand Draco was selfish and possessive and never got in the way. Given Harry could be just as possessive and selfish in return she’d gotten very good at working with the both of them and letting them be just as possessive as needed.
The two of them had talked plenty about Draco’s year spent living amongst Death Eaters both at the Manor and Hogwarts, but he wasn’t sure Harry understood the full implication of hosting the Dark Lord. He wasn’t sure that even the glimpses Harry had gotten inside Voldemort’s head when he was holding court over the dining table were enough to fully grasp what it was that Malfoy Manor had become under Voldemort’s control.
Harry nods. ‘It went about as well as you can expect, he said something, I said something, pretty sure the only reason it didn’t come to blows was that we were in a muggle area.’
‘Hermione, please,’ Harry begged but Hermione had said her piece and she was done trying to explain herself, she just gave Harry one last look and apparated away with a very emotional crack.
Harry laughed softly. ‘I think she’s probably got the right idea about that.’
He sighed. ‘Do you need me to leave?’ he asked, hoping the answer was no because it was bloody fucking cold and he wasn’t wearing much of anything but he asked all the same because he could be understanding on occasion and whatever Longbottom had come to say he was obviously struggling to get it out and if slipping at high speed into the bathroom and a scolding hot shower could speed the process along then Draco was willing to make the sacrifice.
‘I – you’re married to Malfoy,’ she managed to stutter out.
Draco sniggered. ‘Because I kept stealing your glasses when we duelled.’
‘Yeah,’ Longbottom sighed heavily, shifting uncomfortably in the chair. ‘Me too.’
In retrospect, Draco was genuinely surprised the photo on the front page of the
‘Oh, shut up,’ Harry snapped but it was half-hearted. ‘There’s my first what-if, really, what if my parents had lived and it looks a lot like that weird dream I had about mine and Ginny’s future.’
Draco on the other hand, was confused. ‘I’m sorry, isn’t this a good thing? You didn’t want them to know about our world because it was dangerous.’
‘And the second?’ Draco asked but he could already guess. ‘Why weren’t we affected?’
He sighed. Well, if he was going to do this, he was going to do it properly. ‘How much do you know about Harry’s time with the Dursleys?’
Harry took a step closer to the door, put his back to Robards finally, as though he’d said his piece. As though he didn’t have anything to worry about, turning his back on a man people considered quite powerful and adept in the field. He had one last thing to say as he passed through the door though.
‘Potter-Malfoy,’ he whispered. ‘We’re definitely hyphenating.’
Their last seekers game, just as an example, had been brutal.
‘When did you ever talk to Hannah Abbott?’ Weasley demanded.
Possibly (probably) to protect herself.
Like this ward. He might not know exactly which one it was but he recognised the style and purpose. The fact the witches – and possibly the two wizards – had been in and out of the house told Draco there was a way to key the wards to certain people (like those with Voldemort’s Mark) but he didn’t know how, and he didn’t have time to figure it out, he’d like to at least attempt to make it to some of his classes for the day and he felt that if he kept the Ministry waiting too long they would send for one of their curse breakers and then people would end up dead.
