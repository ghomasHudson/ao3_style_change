But Narcissa’s voice broke the last tethers of Harry’s control—urgent and steady, the same voice which had asked Harry if her son still lived, which had called to Draco across a field of enemies.
Harry only half-listened to Bill make pleasant, mostly one-sided conversation as they made their way to the Leaky Cauldron. The night was warm and Harry had his coat and robes bundled up under his arm, but he still felt a lingering chill at the back of his neck, like someone was watching him. Or like he was aware of the Ministry he’d left behind, the building itself like a crouching dragon, waiting to swallow him if he ever went back.
A dark figure appeared beside him so close he flinched. A knuckle brushed softly against his cheek, a perversion of the same gesture which used to bring him comfort, make him feel safe and loved when it came from— But coming from—
Of course, if they were in a position to tell him what they thought, he wouldn’t have gone through a war and learned exactly what it felt like when your protectors failed you.
A few murmurs swept through the crowd, packed with wizards and witches in thick black and dark navy robes. Some sounded impressed, approving, some frustrated.
“I don’t want to do this with you. I don’t—want to fight. Not with you, or with Ron. But I can’t—” His voice broke and he blinked more tears from his eyes. “It’s really hard to look at you right now, and I don’t want to be around you while I’m… While I feel like—”
“Of course I bloody knew,” Ron spat, offended. “You pop off for a month to the coast and Ginny spends all her time flying and visiting friends and being anywhere except with
Proulx arched his brow, made a small scoffing noise which reminded Harry too much of Umbridge’s cough. “You’ve known him for seven years and you can’t—”
They didn’t ask about the kids in Azkaban or the girl they’d killed. Presumably, this Yeats woman wasn’t going to change her mind anytime soon about their sentencing. He’d nearly brought it up himself after two hours, but he stopped himself. He was here to help. They wanted him to help. Harry could do that.
Ron knew what it was to fight, but he didn’t know what it was to fight knowing he would die. That if he didn’t let himself be killed, he’d be responsible for the lives of everyone he’d ever cared about. That if he failed, people he didn’t even know would die by the hundreds, the thousands.
“It’s not. I was an ass. I should never have doubted—” He cleared his throat, face going red and splotchy. “I’ve always known you to be an honorable chap, with a good heart. Now I know you’re more than that. You’re a bloody hero. I know my brother Ron is alive because of you and I can only guess what might have happened to the rest of my family had you not—”
“If you take issue with the laws in place in this country, I’m afraid this trial is not the place to—”
It took longer for the blood to catch this time. Harry felt the slight tug too, where he’d been too startled to feel it before. It was like a string attached to his…everything, or his mind, the sensation of himself as a thing separate from the rest of the world—it was drawing out something inside of him, and he could sense that he
“You’re the one who made it about me,” Malfoy said harshly. “If your little light show hadn’t worked, what then? He would have come after
It was nice too, well-kept with a lot of light, a window seat in the kitchen, a clawfoot tub, pleasantly scuffed wooden floors the color of caramel. It was small but once upon a time it would have been unthinkable to the little boy who had been locked in a cupboard with only spiders for company. It creaked in a homey way. There were little sanded-down ticks on the corner of the hallway wall, measurements of the children who had lived here before him. He even had a walk-out which was apparently weather-proofed for anything barring large hail or hurricane-force winds. The agent had told him it was a good place for a plant. If he fancied himself a hobby.
Dust and smoke still rose up in the air like specters of the people they’d lost, painting the dawn and the morning hazy and soft, growing dull and yellowed by noon. A little after, Luna covering for him when no one was watching, he slipped on the invisibility cloak—and walked out into the grounds on his own.
“I know,” Harry sighed, leaning back in his chair, “I know, and I’m grateful, really, but you can’t expect me to eat all this. This is enough for ten people. It’s amazing, really, I’m—this is beyond what I’d ever ask of you, but I can’t eat anymore. I’ll get sick.”
The word blew through on the wind with an ash-filled voice colored in the fire-bright leaves around him. His hands searched blindly over the ground for his wand. The thing coiling around his leg moved up, tracing his calf almost softly. Another joined it soon over his other ankle and they were circling up his thighs, between his legs, around his waist. His eyes threatened to close despite the panic beating a tattoo inside his chest. Fatigue curled up his spine and from his lips broke a gasp of mist, the first bite of frost chilling the air.
Goyle was crying, his scarred face horrible and pained. He was crying and he was choking Harry, and Harry was digging into Goyle’s hand with his nails, panicking as Goyle’s fingers slipped over the edge of his wand. A jolt of fresh panic went through him as he felt Goyle tug, try to pry open his fingers with his free hand.
When Kingsley spoke, his voice vibrated it was so low. “It’s not your fault, Harry. Gregory Goyle’s death was an accident.”
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. The same anger and defiance Harry had seen in Malfoy Manor flickered to life when he’d realized Malfoy knew exactly who Harry was. His left hand moved. His long fingers brushed the end of his sleeve.
“I just meant he wasn’t supposed to be talking to anyone, especially not you.” The auror leaned in like Malfoy wasn’t even there and whispered, “This here’s Draco Malfoy, you know, son of—”
Between the two of them, the second felt darker, or at least less bright and safe than the greenwood book. And if he was going to do something stupid, he might as well be smart about it.
“Okay,” he murmured, the sound of his voice creating an echo inside his mind, “so they just decided one day to… I just…I still don’t know
Leaning over with his elbows on his knees, Malfoy was frozen. Staring into space with vacant, unmoving eyes. His long body folded over, almost hunched. The same hollow, lost look when he had walked down to Voldemort in the courtyard.
“I don’t know, Minister,” Harry said quietly, the beating of his heart like a war drum in his chest. “If Voldemort couldn’t kill me, I’m not sure anything can.”
traitor! Undeserving piece of trash—how you could stand there and face me when you couldn’t even—” She broke off as a spell whipped by her face, slashing her cheek. Bellatrix’s eyes were gleaming now, mania taking over and pulling her mouth into a terrible smile. “You weak, disgusting,
They had gone slow when they were dating in school, so slow one might say that they went nowhere at all, Ginny only being fifteen when they got together, and Harry having about as much sexual experience as a turnip—bit of over the clothes groping, some quickly-stifled heat when Ginny shifted on his lap and his cock decided to get up and cheer for her. At the time it had felt like they were building up to something, increasing the anticipation with every kiss by the lake or brush of her hand against his.
His fingers clenched around the gnarled back. There was something sweet smelling about the tree. He imagined he could hear the sap being made, sugar dripping down the insides of the tree.
“Percy,” Harry said firmly, not sure if he was moved or just embarrassed, “it’s all right. We all make mistakes. People can change, can’t they? And you did it all on your own, so you don’t have to apologize to me. Only thing we can do is try to learn from our mistakes so we don’t make them again.”
But he kept going, flipping through the thin wooden sheets, getting an impression of distinct workings of magic. There weren’t many, maybe eleven that he could differentiate between with any confidence. The first seemed to be the easiest, though, because he started seeing the same positions and movements mirrored in later sections, added to other forms and complicated.
“Bout the same,” Bill said after a while. “Maybe a little better. Hard to tell with Harry. Sometimes I think he’s fine and then…” He trailed off. In what was left unsaid, Harry found himself filling in the blanks.
“I do, and I will.” Harry felt a surge of pity for this man who still thought he could win. Who would not admit, even at the end, that he had failed. “I do know. Your horcruxes are gone.”
“Patrick!” The old woman frowned, as if simply repeating the bloke’s name would jog Harry’s memory. “Patrick Van Buren!”
“Master should be having this, then,” he said quietly, holding out his hand as a shimmer of gold appeared in his palm.
Maybe he’d come to be fond of Harry. Harry didn’t think Dumbledore was callous or cruel to his core, not intentionally. He may have even believed in what he’d said.
For a moment something caged and haunted flashed over Bill’s face, but then he dropped to his knees, panic slotted efficiently away as he started murmuring healing spells under his breath. The hot brand around his throat released and Harry coughed. “Stabbed,” he managed. He tried to gesture to his side, but moving sent another wave of dizzying pain through him. His vision blacked out and for a moment he went under.
Ron caught himself before he could fall and straightened up, face red as he pushed past Harry into the hallway. He opened his mouth but was cut off by Walburga Black’s shrieking voice.
their school. So I have to say something, because no one else will. You’re using these kids, the ones you’ve got upstairs in another courtroom with bombs on their legs, to scare this country into falling in line. You can say it’s out of caution, but it’s cruel. That’s all. You don’t care about them. You don’t care what they went through. Well
Harry felt his stomach drop. Until that moment, he’d been able to convince some part of him that Malfoy had been lying, playing it up, trying to mess with Harry’s head—but he saw it in Bill’s eyes. He saw the flicker of shame, the same discomfort Harry felt in the twist of his mouth. It was all true. And Bill knew how wrong it was.
“I don’t see why not,” he said, “though I’m not sure you’ll find any answers in there. Our consultant was very thorough.”
He frowned, checking his appearance in the mirror of a bathroom which had only appeared two days ago on the ground floor—he was averaging two or three new rooms a day, which was both disconcerting and strangely comforting. Grimmauld Place didn’t know who it was supposed to be either.
Harry caught Bill’s movements out of the corner of his eye. He tried to speak, but only managed a rough, “An-dromeda—”
He hadn’t seen his wand break in Bathilda Bagshot’s house, but he remembered the feeling. Like some string in his mind was cut, a discordant shriek vibrating in his teeth and up his arm.
The connection formed. Harry braced for the force bearing down on him. His center of gravity shifted, his attention focused on the gold bead in front of him. He pushed, pouring his will into moving forward, relentless and constant and unforgiving. He felt Voldemort’s first flinch of weakness, his first reaction to Harry’s conviction. Harry focused his eyes on the bead of golden light, giving everything he had into pushing,
Ron and Hermione were too busy to answer their floo, doing something he tried hard not to think about. George was working and Harry couldn’t even pop down and help because every time he so much as offered, the mannequins started lopping him over the head with umbrellas. Everyone else was due to arrive in the next few days for preliminary questioning. He was the only one called in for the full week before the trials started.
“Like Snape reminded me every time he saw me I was talentless and stupid because he hated my dad so much and was obsessed with my mum and looking at me was a reminder of her?
Harry didn’t know where to look as he waited, eyes wandering over the members of the Wizengamot absently, avoiding the area where he could still feel Hermione staring at him, like she was shouting and he was the only one who could hear her.
The other book was heavier, the wood strips of dark gold alternating with cool brown in neat, regimented sections. The lines were precise, firm, and this writing had been burned, or soldered into the wood with an impressively clean stroke. As Harry left his hand on this one, he felt again that warmth emanating from it, but now that he was focusing, he could also feel…solidity. A hardness to the warmth that felt steadier than the breathy fresh scent of the greenwood book. A kind of security and ownership.
Because he wasn’t one more mourner. He was still Harry Potter. People still looked at him like he was their savior. He had hoped it would stop once Voldemort died but the divide remained. If anything it felt worse now.
Malfoy’s gaze flickered over Voldemort’s shoulder, then back to Harry, and then with purpose he released Harry.
Voldemort tilted his head, one waxy hand rising to tip Malfoy’s chin up. “You have.” His long, sharp nails pressed into Malfoy’s ash-streaked face. “Most egregiously. I could take your life right now and be done with you. Or perhaps you need more effective incentives,” he added this last so quietly that Harry shouldn’t have been able to hear him, not over the distance between them. But he heard it like it was brushed against his own cheek. Like he was there in Malfoy’s place with Voldemort so horribly close.
His steadiness faded, leaving behind only the raw place where his anger sat these days. “It’s not fine. Not to me,” he said quietly. “I’m not okay with this, Hermione.”
Harry blinked, realizing he was no longer in the bathroom, but sitting on a bed in a small room—Teddy’s room, he realized with a jolt. He knew there were only two bedrooms in the little cottage, but the knowledge that he was sitting so close to Teddy after he’d… He looked down and saw he was wearing a faded blue t-shirt and a pair of overlarge cotton trousers. On his lap was a striped pink and green fleece blanket. His right hand was wrapped up, and he only then remembered Andromeda telling him they’d wait on the Skele-Gro until later. Wouldn’t do to be fighting back a scream the whole time he was…questioned? Presumably Bill was bringing an auror back with him, or maybe he’d come and fetch Harry and they’d—
“Be quiet.” Her eyes flicked to his and held, a small, horrible flash of fear reaching out to him before she regained her steely composure. “Most of the bones in your right hand are shattered. You have two fractures in your ribs and a puncture wound to your stomach, which nearly caught your lung, and another cut to the back of your knee that grazed a ligament.”
wand—digging into the small of his back where it stuck out from his pocket. If he could get away from Hagrid, he could put on the cloak and get clear. Maybe he could draw Voldemort off…
There was writing on the page. He blinked, startled, slid his glasses back on—and it was gone again. Confused, he tipped his glasses up, and there it was. Faint, just like the carvings on the top of the green box, more the impression of invisible words than true lettering. He chewed on his thumb for a while, leg jostling.
“I don’t know. I would have said from one of their families but all three homes were raided within days of the last battle. Something that dark would have been spotted, even if it was hidden.”
“Yeah, they, er,” Harry said, feeling strangely conflicted, “they brought me in for informal questioning. Today was all Hogwarts students.”
All the grief and rage and disappointment flooded in as he remembered watching Dumbledore thrown back into the air. Snape’s expression of guilt and mingled loathing. Malfoy’s trembling hand, lowering the same hawthorn wand Harry had just thrown back at him. Malfoy’s wide, desperate eyes.
His stomach dropped a few more miles down into the ground. “St. Andrews,” Harry repeated, not even surprised, really.
I've been having a bit of a time of things the past few months. I live in the US and everything is currently on fire. It's been a bit of a struggle to find time to write and my energy has gotten sucked into other things like figuring out how to make money now lol.
The need to talk to her should feel more urgent, shouldn’t it? Shouldn’t he want to hug her, touch her, make sure she was all right? Ron and Hermione hadn’t let go of each other’s hand for hours. Harry should want the same. He
“If you do ever need to get out,” he started, feeling a little awkward, “I’m sure Fleur would love to have you.”
“Hold on,” Harry said, a memory springing up out of nowhere, “was Van Buren the first year who got his nose stuck in a Christmas popper? Walked around for a week before the holidays shooting out confetti when he sneezed?”
Except…that was wrong, wasn’t it? The door to the Chamber of Secrets had looked a bit like this. Where the box was decorated in roots and branches and leaves, the door had been entirely covered with snakes. But the way it opened was…similar, for some reason. A coppery taste filled his mouth as his tongue seemed to want to form words in Parseltongue, even though there was no snake to talk to.
Harry jolted as a jarring sensation filtered through his chest. Fear and disgust so strong it made him stumble backwards. He looked up, eyes going immediately to the other figure standing in the open circle.
Harry couldn’t help but notice that Charlie looked even more fit than the last time he’d seen him. Really, most of the Weasleys were thin and lanky while Charlie looked like he might still keep up with his Quidditch training. Maybe he even lifted weights. Or…other things fit people did to get muscles like that. He’d seen first hand what regular exercise could do to a bloke—and Dudley’d been carrying enough body weight for a small nuclear family.
“No one besides the people who were in this room when we last spoke know of the events which occurred last week involving you, Harry, but we have formally charged Millicent Bulstrode with destruction of public property, intent to commit harm, and a breach of the International Statute of Secrecy, while Gregory Goyle’s case has been closed, as we’ve determined he did in fact kill the muggles for which he was charged by the Wizengamot. Millicent, in her current state, will likely be sentenced to hospice care for the rest of her life, as there is little chance of her recovering enough to function on her own.”
The sky was grey, but not gloomily so. The clouds were thin and high and they roamed over the long green expanse of fields beside Andromeda’s home. She lived on the western edge of Oxford, situated at the end of a humble dirt road. If he strained himself, he could hear cars in the distance, the sounds of a city waking up, but it was quiet out here.
her. I cracked it, yeah, because it was pretty fucking obvious you’d ditched her and didn’t want to talk about it. I was going to bring it up after the trials were over, because I guessed even then that you were gearing up to go mental.”
Kamau drew in a small breath as she looked at Harry, brow furrowing in alarm. Robards was as stoic as Harry had ever seen him, though there was a distinct air of grim calm to his person that hadn’t been there during his questioning. The young woman’s eyes widened behind her glasses, and she muttered something under her breath.
“Let’s begin with a summary of your testimony you have already given to Ministry officials,” she said after a while, settling back into her chair and look down at him from the bridge of her nose.
And how had Goyle thought Malfoy was somehow working with Harry? Because he’d turned against the death eaters in the final moments of the battle? Because he chose to surrender after instead of run? That had nothing to do with Harry.
Ron and Hermione were there too, just like Ginny and Luna and Neville, the Weasleys—all of them showed up and died. Molly’s boggart had showed her the deaths of all her family members, flipping through them one by one.
The day before the trials started Harry got a television, because he couldn’t think what else to do.
A small green box sat under the window, about the size of a large book. Harry got closer and saw a simple but fine gold locking mechanism holding it shut, a bit of embellishment painted on the sides and top to resemble vines. It was very pretty, and looked remarkably well kept. He reached out to pick it up, only belatedly having the thought that it was probably enchanted to resist the normal wear of age and perhaps he should have remembered this house had a history of keeping things which liked to bite anyone who touched them—when something stabbed into his middle finger.
Flipping through the other books Regulus had collected, he saw some of the same theory popping up around the art of dueling and defense, of warding oneself against outside interference or attack. They were all old, at least five hundred years, so Harry assumed the school of thought had gone out of style. He couldn’t exactly deny that giving a bunch of eleven-year-olds the instruction to cut themselves and direct the magic in their blood might be somewhat jarring. Not to mention alarming to their parents. And it seemed like easy magic to get wrong if you didn’t do it confidently. Easy magic to abuse, too.
fault you went and blew your own life up! You lose it in front of the whole fucking Wizengamot, then you shut yourself in here so you don’t have to deal with the fallout, because apparently you’re too much of a pansy to face up to the fact that you just
He squinted at the small writing, summoning his glasses so he could actually see. In scratchy, compact writing, it said,
Ron was standing there, fists clenched at his sides, looking livid, like he was ready for a fight. Harry recognized this look well. He’d seen it more than a few times in his life, the last being in a cold tent right before Ron ditched him and Hermione.
Harry stood in the center of the parlor which now seemed dark compared to the brilliance of only a moment before. He was breathing hard. His mind felt a bit like someone had reached in and scrambled all his thoughts around—but then it settled. And there it was—the secret sitting there in the back of his mind. Innocuous. Quiet. For some odd reason it reminded him of the winged key he’d needed to catch in first year to get to Quirrell.
“No, I…” Harry smiled, feeling the urge to brag a bit. It was an odd sensation, one which sat a little uncomfortably in his chest. “Did you not hear about Gringotts?”
His eyes caught on a piece of paper sticking out of one of the books. The handwriting was…familiar. Part of it, anyway.
After what felt like an hour, the green-gold dust disappeared, shimmering over stalk and leaf and petal like fresh morning mist. Harry twisted his hands again, this time bringing his right thumb to his left palm, performing a series of contortions with the fingers of his left hand until he felt something connect like a key into a lock. He turned his right hand, and the disc of blood rippled into a steady stream, pouring down onto the plant like water from a can.
It was heartbreaking, the first few times, to look down into Teddy’s eyes and see Remus staring back up at him. It helped that the boy’s hair kept changing color and length every hour, shooting down to his knees as he crawled across Andromeda’s worn plaid rug, only to reverse back up into his head when he sat down.
Charlie took a long drink, shooting Harry another oddly furtive look. “You thinking about it, though?”
Back, before the end, he’d thought one day he might have time to think about it. To go through all the normal teenage phases of life after he’d done what he was supposed to do and he was free to grow up like everyone else.
His voice was still unnaturally smooth. It sounded horrible, but she was looking at him like he wasn’t the boy she’d been friends with for seven years. The boy she’d fought a
Harry went very still. The last time he’d heard that phrase he’d been hundreds of miles away in a cold, dark tent with Hermione, going over the possible ways they could destroy horcruxes for the hundredth time, retreading ground rather than sitting in silence. One more in a list of increasingly horrible and improbable ways to damage something so thoroughly nothing could fix it.
He looked down, filled with an uncanny sense of backwards deja vu—it took him twice as long to see what he was supposed to see, like he caught the flash of a camera and had to wait until his sight returned to see who’d taken the picture.
“Yes, I would mean it. I do mean it. I’m sorry. That wasn’t…” Kingsley shook his head. “I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, Harry. I never meant to put you through that. I’m sorry.”
He shouldn’t be able to feel this. How many times had Dumbledore told him he was good and pure and fucking
Harry rounded on him, eyes flicking from him to Ron and Hermione, all of them wearing similar expressions of startled concern. It pushed him over the last cliff into the anger simmering so close to the surface since Malfoy’d showed him the cuff. Since he’d had to sit in a chair in the same place Sirius had died and answer questions about the war he’d been fighting since he was a baby.
Malfoy straightened up. The knot in his throat bobbed as he swallowed. He was taller than Voldemort but he still managed to look properly subservient. He bowed his head. He held Harry’s gaze as he murmured, “I have failed you, my lord.”
Harry’s eyes burned with unshed tears, anger creeping up his throat like a serpent and coiling, tightening, strangling.
Also, he suspected they weren’t too happy with him right now in any case. He’d asked Hermione for time. Maybe they needed time too.
“I know I don’t.” Gently, she turned him around with a soft push. “I’ll put something together for you.”
The last finally roused him from his place on the floor. He shoved a hand under his chest, shaking as he levered himself a few inches off the ground. Gasping for breath, he clenched his jaw against another scream, and managed to flip himself over.
that if he’s cooperating, he’s genuinely cooperating. If it means protecting his parents, he’s not bluffing. He was never very good at it, anyway. If he didn’t want to work with you lot, he wouldn’t. He’d find a way out or he’d go to Azkaban. Assuming you’re not coercing him.”
He woke shaking, the dream slipping quickly away as if someone ripped it from his still semiconscious mind.
He rubbed his eyes, wincing as tension began to tighten at his temples. His mind seemed to throb in fatigue, shutting down before he could overthink himself. He felt wrung out and tired.
He’d looked into it himself, managing to convince a bright-eyed and overeager receptionist who clearly wanted to do nothing more than help Harry however he could to let him into the Ministry records, and he’d been right about the severity of the punishment. While there were no laws in place that prohibited this kind of deterrent with this level of severity, it’d been struck from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement’s policies over a century ago. More than one Head Auror had seemed to find punishing children distasteful in their written files surrounding the change.
He shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans, feeling like he was about to jump out of his own skin. He felt like there was too much space around him, which was mad because he had only ever felt like he needed more space to breathe—one of the charming perks of living in a five by three foot room for the first eleven years of his life. His chest was so tight he thought he was about to snap in two.
“Because your lunatic aunt—” He faltered at Malfoy’s flinch, swallowed a knot of guilt. “Because she was torturing my friend and Voldemort was about to come find me and kill me,” Harry said slowly, still through gritted teeth. “Or did you forget that part? So yeah, I fucking took your wand. And now I’m giving it back. Because what am I supposed to do with your cast off?”
Andromeda sent her keen gaze over him, dark eyes growing tight as she no doubt saw the strain of his isolation, the barely concealed anxiety which was so close to the surface of Harry’s thoughts now.
Andromeda’s mouth went thin, anxiety in her gaze as she looked one more time at Harry. Her voice firm, she said, “When you’re done, come get me. I’ll be waiting.”
“I’m serious.” Kingsley’s voice went hard, the look in his eyes almost urgent, imploring. “I’ve spent my whole adult life fighting dark wizards. I know what it’s like to go through hell. You don’t get through it on your own. All it does is sit and fester, and you might think you can handle it now, but you can’t in the long run. Take the advice. Seek help. Professional, if you don’t think your friends can do that for you. But if you do nothing with that anger and pain it’s going to eat you alive. I’ve seen it happen. One day, it will kill you.”
But Dumbledore hadn’t told him. Like he hadn’t told Harry about Godric’s Hollow, or Grindelwald, or his sister. The Hallows. He hadn’t told Harry anything. He had let Harry believe he was looking out for him, showing him how to save the people he loved, how to be better and succeed where all others had failed, protecting him, guiding him. Guiding him into the fucking grave.
“Yeah.” Harry was caught off guard. “Thought I’d give the Magical Pest Advisory Board a spin. Maybe try my hand at wrangling feral brownies or redcaps.”
He understood now why wands had become the standard, at least in Britain. It was bloody hard to rely on your fingers.
“What about—” His voice broke. Teddy looked up at him, a solemn furrow in his brow as he gummed at the bracelet. “What about their families? I know Goyle’s dad was killed in the war, but…”
When they were all gone, and it was just Harry, Bill, and Andromeda, Harry felt a little like all the strings holding him up had been cut. He sat down heavily, swallowing a grunt of pain. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Andromeda approach, Bill take a few paces away from him before he turned back.
He’d seen Millicent that morning. She’d glared at him from the group of Slytherin girls, tall and imposing and stone-faced. He’d given her five seconds of thought, maybe. How had he missed her intention to…
Now that he felt a bit more like a person, he was realizing quickly that he’d landed himself back in Grimmauld Place, alone with nothing to do but think and drive himself crazy. The desire to crawl back into bed, to lay down and close his eyes and just stop trying to be all right when he wasn’t and never would be was so strong he felt gravity increase around him, pressing him down into the chair.
Her husband, however, looked like a stiff breeze would send him sprawling. Lucius Malfoy used to be nothing but unctuous charm and easy, confident superiority—something his son had never managed to achieve, despite his attempts. Not anymore, though. Lucius was nearly unrecognizable. His whole demeanor had changed. Actually, Lucius reminded Harry of Wormtail in the Shrieking Shack moments after he had been forced back into his human form. He had the same panicked light to his eyes, the same pallid sheen, white hair wispy and disheveled twitchiness—all his class and smiling cruelty gone now his master was dead. He was just a scared old man who had been forced out into the light.
A tiny vibration went through his palm, a little bead of warmth, like a dog pressing its nose into his hand.
It’s not like he’d ever decided on hard and fast rules for himself as to who he liked to look at. He’d liked Cho, but thinking back—it’d been her flying that caught his eye first, not so much her looks, though she had been very pretty. Ginny’d been a fixture in his life for a while before his body decided to go postal over watching her snog Dean, so it was never a conscious choice, was it? And, again, he’d fancied Fleur in the same way he fancied ice cream, because who the fuck didn’t fancy ice cream? So theoretically he liked girls who could fly, girls who were fit and—tall?
His hands lingered in the air, the emptiness in them so, so much worse than it had been only a few moments ago. The numbness filtered slowly back into him, soothing his ragged edges and dulling the pain of whatever, whoever, had just cut into his dream and took something out of him. A sharp, silver thief and a soft, broken voice.
Kids were forced to torture their friends, to watch as death eaters destroyed their home and killed their families, and you wonder why they decided not to act? I saw what happened to those who fought back. How
But he knew the look in her eyes. Desperate and scared, relieved someone else knew and was trying to help.
He glanced at Narcissa but her pursed lips betrayed nothing. Lucius, Harry saw with a small twist of satisfaction, was avoiding his gaze and looked ready to bolt.
Dumbledore had armed him with love and the crafted certainty of a pure, unbroken soul and sent him off to do the one thing which would damn him forever. To rip his own purity apart.
He walked quickly away down the length of the Great Hall and out the broken doors through the groups of people he’d saved and fought the urge to sprint. He didn’t know where he was going but he knew he needed to get out. Maybe he’d go find his old room in Gryffindor Tower. Maybe it had survived most of the—
Charlie grinned. “Well, if you ever need a bit of a break, you’re always welcome to visit. Romania is very beautiful. Mountains, forests, lakes—and your favorite Weasley.” He gave Harry a small wink. “Plus, I already know you’re good with dragons.”
Once, it might have stopped Harry, but he might as well have been speaking to a specter. Harry wasn’t here anymore. He was burning in the ruins of all the homes he never had. He was choking on the black water rising up over his head, pulled down by cold hands locked around his ankles.
The auror’s face hardened as he took a step back. Harry was filled with a fierce sense of vindication at seeing the hero worship leak out of his eyes. Well fuck. Maybe he should be an arsehole more often. To some people, maybe.
Malfoy looked away after a while, tension in the way he held his arms, crossed stiffly over his chest. His fingers clenched under sleek black leather gloves. All the tension in his eyes seemed to drain away until Malfoy looked—tired. Just like Harry. Until he looked like he was trying to go somewhere else, be somewhere far distant from this place.
Harry kept staring down at the rug, a horrible, gnawing emptiness slipping down the cavity of his chest and settling at the bottom of his stomach like sediment in a dark body of water. Tugging him down with a heavy, horrible weight.
“Good!” Ron reached over and clapped him on the shoulder. “There’s your career sorted, then. Hermione, how does it feel to be the one who isn’t prepared for once?”
The feeling in the room shifted slightly as a few people frowned. Yeats seemed to disregard her former dismissal as she said, “Mr. Potter, the witch and wizards being sentenced here today were of age when the Battle of Hogwarts took place.”
“I can see why you might need outside help,” Harry said, frowning as they walked past the fountain. There was no statue now. Maybe they had realized that anything they could come up with would be offensive to somebody. Harry privately agreed but it did make the atrium look bare and bigger.
It took him a long time to calm down, left hand pressed to his forehead just in case it started pulsing. It reminded him of the moment after the splitting pain of a headache had faded, when you could feel the phantom sensation lingering behind your eyes and in your temples, braced for it to assault you again. He was so focused on his scar, in fact, that he almost missed the state of his right hand.
“When you’re feeling better, floo me. If it’s been more than three days and I still haven’t heard from you, I will find out where you’re staying and I will come myself.” She studied his face, something like fear tightening the fine lines around her eyes. “I mean it, Harry. I understand why you feel the need to leave and I won’t keep you here, but I—” She exhaled softly. “I’ll feel better if I know you’re healing properly.”
Ron, who had grown up with parents who loved him, with a home and a family and a place to fall back on, a place he belonged just because of who he was, who hadn’t been shut away in a cupboard because he was so unwanted, who had never spent countless nights listening to the sound of his mother dying, who had never lost every person who’d ever been close to something like a parent, who had never been betrayed by the person he’d thought was his best and last protector.
Guilt reached into him and grabbed. His chest grew tight as he tried to breathe. Now that he didn’t feel like he was slowly exploding from the inside out, Harry realized the gravity of the situation. How much he’d put both Andromeda and Bill through. “I’m sorry. Bill, I’m—”
Slowly, Andromeda helped him into her small bathroom. He sat on the toilet while she gently peeled off his clothes, methodically cleaning and then healing his remaining wounds. Harry sat in a detached kind of horror, unable to do more than move when she asked and hold back sounds of pain when some other injury made itself known. He couldn’t even remember how he’d gotten most of them. As the minutes dragged on he tried to think back to the fight, but there were gaps. He was propped against the tree and then he was on the ground. He was screaming as Goyle broke his hand and then he was exploding with fear.
He’d found this spot two weeks before he’d gone in for questioning, a little hidden patch of grass in the center of Richmond Park on one of his early days of wandering London, trying to fill the time. Caged in on three sides by a hedge, it reminded him of the maze at the end of the Triwizard Tournament. It shouldn’t have been comfortable, but it was, weirdly, covered in shadow and cool even during the day. The air smelled older here—a small pocket of London hidden away from the noise and the chaos of people swarming through it. The world felt like it was perched on the edge of autumn here in the dim light, the last summer warmth trailing up toward the sky in waving fingers.
“This room is being hidden by Kreacher after Master Sirius returned.” Kreacher’s voice was low, though he didn’t sound at all ashamed. More like he didn’t want to make Harry angry by outright insulting Sirius. “When Kreacher is learning that Master Sirius was wanting to purge this noble and ancient house of all things reminding him of his family, Kreacher is wanting to protect some things. The house is asking Kreacher to hide them.”
“You know who else expected blind faith and cooperation, who hated dissent and punished those who dared to question what he was doing?
Heart beating fast, Harry looked back to the book and this time he could clearly see all the writing even with his glasses. On a hunch, he flipped back a bit, noticing details he hadn’t before, connecting diagrams with symbols and text, patterns where there had only been confusion. It was as if those three words had been a cipher, and now that he had the secret he could begin to understand the rest of the book.
If the weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts were a series of clipped images, people and places blurring past Harry like he was peering out the window of a train, June felt like flying into the Whomping Willow, only it didn’t incite the thrill of being nearly smashed to paste.
was being subtle, near the end. They’re worried. Why do you think we’ve got outside officials coming in to babysit and make sure we’re being properly punitive? I’m sure Shacklebolt wants to reassure the rest of the Wizarding World that they’re taking the problem seriously.”
The world was breaking all around him, and all he could hear was the sound of his own ragged breath.
“What did I miss?” Ron asked with a frown, holding Hermione’s drink away when she tried to take it. “Did you make a joke about me while I was
Kreacher’s eyes glowed in the dim light, like a cat’s. In the shadows, he almost looked like something else, a being older and sharper and more strange than the world around them. Like he was smaller and…
Sharp, running footsteps caught up to him in the Entrance Hall. He gritted his teeth, ready to tell Hermione and Ron that he was fine, he just needed some air, but it wasn’t them.
Her eyes narrowed at him, and he had the uncanny feeling that she didn’t believe any of this. “How odd.”
“Yeah, well, I do.” Harry’s jaw clenched. “So I guess they know it’s wrong or else they’d be shouting it from the rooftops, yeah? It’d be on the front of the Prophet like the rest of the trials. But maybe they think eleven-year-olds getting punished because of their parents wouldn’t sit well with their readers.”
Harry was trying to scream, but he had no breath, he couldn’t breathe. His legs kicked uselessly. Another knee to his thigh. Goyle let out a choked growl and slammed his right hand down again and again, breaking bones. It sounded like glass shattering. Like Dumbledore’s fragile instruments tumbling to the floor—
Harry took his time to raise his eyes. He exhaled and unclenched his hands, rolled his shoulders back, and made sure his body was under control by the time he met Kingsley’s steady, impenetrable gaze. A gaze which reminded Harry terribly of Dumbledore’s after Sirius’s death, when he had watched Harry destroy his office, impassive and distant. He’d expected to feel guilty when he finally faced the Minister, but all he could feel was a kind of barely-controlled anticipation. A mounting tension.
Malfoy’s nostrils flared. He looked like he was trying to control his temper. Which was, frankly, confusing, seeing as how he’d never bothered before. Quite the opposite. He muttered, “You understand nothing, Potter.”
Harry watched him take a few more aimless steps, brush a bit of what looked like ash from his shirt. In fact, Ron looked a bit charred, some of his hair still smoking where it stuck up in the back. Apparently the house had tried to repel him a few times.
His gaze fell first on Parkinson. Face pinched and slightly pinked, the bags under her eyes were so prominent her make-up couldn’t hide them. She’d lost a lot of weight, and her face was now sharp where she’d only ever been round before. She had her hand in her mouth, biting her nails, eyes flicking nervously around the room. It looked like she was bouncing her leg up and down.
A thread of warmth blossomed in his chest. He couldn’t help but smile. “I’ll try that, thanks. Unless—is this tea…er, safe?”
He smiled down at Teddy, who seemed determined to entirely soak the stuffed elephant Harry had bought for him with his own saliva. “I keep thinking he’s gonna grow another arm or something.”
marking oneself with runes to shield against possession by malevolent spirits, though Regulus seemed to think it more a binding of your soul to your body in an attempt to strengthen the bond between the two, a kind of enchantment placed permanently on your body to allow a witch or wizard better protection against malevolent forces. Here, Harry got caught again, because in the margins Regulus had written,
“It’s not charity, Malfoy, I’m just—” Harry balled his hands into fists, fighting the rising anger in his throat. “I took your wand. Now I’m giving it back.”
He set the darker book aside for the time being and opened the greenwood book. The pages inside weren’t pages at all, but more thin sheets of the same buttery wood. Looking closer, he could see faint metal bindings along the spine, holding it all together like a spiral notebook. And on the pages he found what looked to him like incantations.
something but he couldn’t tell which. Dark, arresting eyes—red eyes. Alabaster skin—waxy, scaled skin. He searched for the connection, as if he could figure out when the monster had consumed the man. The more he sat with it, the more ludicrous the idea seemed to him that Riddle’s birth, loveless and horrible as it was, had sapped him of the ability to love, and this made him somehow irredeemable. Yes, he’d become a monster who deserved to die but he hadn’t started out that way. The more Harry thought about it, the more he hated that easy answer.
Slowly, his blood spread like a shadow across the sheet. He pulled his finger away when he thought he’d held it there long enough, watching with a mixture of apprehension and awe when three words appeared above a symbol—a simplified version of the symbol on the front cover.
He felt suddenly cold where his anger was normally hot and burning. It was like he’d sunk so far down into himself he’d let the embers go dark and all that was left was this frigid, churning mass of disdain. He was untouchable down here. Frozen. Dead to the world. It was still hell, but he couldn’t pretend he cared much about anything else.
stop it, if he wanted, and that it might be unpleasant but not deadly. He didn’t feel like he was losing anything, anyway. More like he was exchanging—a tiny bit of blood for whatever was hidden on the sheet.
of them weren’t death eaters, but their kids are still being treated like war criminals. Proulx suggested it, I think, but the new Head of Magical Law Enforcement agreed. She was the one who made sure Hogwarts closed. So it’s not even from the outside. It’s our own people putting those bleeding cuffs on those kids. Treating them like—”
Mercifully, Bill tugged Percy gently into the lift, still smiling. Percy recovered impressively and started listing out the topics Harry might expect to be asked about with a zeal that seemed disproportionate to the subject matter.
When Andromeda and Teddy were gone and Bill had taken a seat on the couch beside Harry, Robards set his tea down and leaned forward, folding his hands together with his thumbs steepled up. All at once the somber old man regained the steely demeanor of the Head Auror. He took out a sharp black quill and a pad of paper, and set it down. It was a quick quotes quill.
He’d been given so many signs, from Dumbledore’s unreliable and fickle confidences to his willingness to trust a man who would have been happy to watch Harry die a long, painful death, from the past he’d kept secret so Harry didn’t know he had a history of viewing people as objects, as pawns, to the moment his own brother told Harry that Dumbledore didn’t give a rat’s ass about his life. Albus Dumbledore, the greatest wizard of his generation, of the last century, was first and foremost a clever, clever man. He had to know what he was doing. He
A small, painful knot squeezed in Harry’s stomach. He remembered their frustration and anger when they found out Kreacher had taken something and hidden it, how he’d believed Sirius when he said that Kreacher was a mean, spiteful thing who only wanted Sirius to go away and serve his dead mistress.
It took him a moment to realize someone was saying his name. He looked up, saw everyone in the room staring at him with various levels of concern or fear.
“I was younger than that the first time I fought him.” His voice came out hard, the words said before he realized what they must sound like. “He didn’t much care, funnily enough.”
But she didn’t, because the worst part of all of this was he hadn’t told her he was a horcrux. He hadn’t told her or Ron what kind of dark, horrible magic had always been inside him. He hadn’t told them that he’d left behind a piece of his soul when he dodged whatever had happened to him when Voldemort sent his Killing Curse.
The small gesture did something odd to Harry’s chest. It was something he might have done for Hermione, were things easy like they used to be.
It wasn’t easy to keep the soul on this plane, however. Its natural inclination seemed to be to leave and disappear, and while there were many ways to split one’s soul or duplicate it in the case of sympathetic bonds between two willing people, to force it to remain, to manipulate it, you had to corrupt its very essence and master your own soul. In turning it immortal, you changed it, so while you would live as long as that piece of your soul remained safe, you’d never again be a true, normal person. You would be something else.
Harry stared down at his hands. His right was still wrapped in linen, numb and swollen. His left was trembling. He felt Andromeda’s stare but he couldn’t look up. He couldn’t see the fear in her eyes, fear
One of the other Slytherin girls had joined her, speaking softly. Harry recognized her at once. Daphne Greengrass’s hand hovered over Edlefina’s shoulder as she gave Harry a small, tight smile. Her auburn hair was tucked up into a neat bun, her robes austere and fine. She looked far older than she had the last time Harry’d seen her.
“No, we didn’t,” Harry said harshly, realizing with horrible clarity how thoroughly Ron could never understand. His anger shifted into something sharp and pointed, and he didn’t want to make excuses. He didn’t want to care about Ron’s feelings or his own guilt. He was angry. He was broken. Might as well just lean in.
The notes flew into the green fire, swallowed up neatly with two small pops of embers. Harry stood there for a while, not expecting answers right away but unable to move. He’d done it. He should feel happy.
It tread very close to what Dumbledore had believed about Harry’s power over Voldemort. How his love for the people in his life was what kept his soul whole. How it made him stronger, better than Voldemort, whose soul had been broken and splintered into different vessels and whom Dumbledore believed was incapable of love.
“He was lowering his wand,” Harry said quietly. “When Snape and the other death eaters came up to the Astronomy Tower. He was lowering his wand. He seemed—afraid. I’m not saying he’s not guilty of trying, but I don’t think he wanted to kill Dumbledore. Dumbledore didn’t think so, at any rate.”
Usually, though, it only happened when you were trying to cast. Not so usually when you didn’t even have a wand in your hand.
The man to her left apparently did not agree, because he didn’t even rise to shake Harry’s hand. “Jean Chastel Proulx, Mr. Potter, from the French Ministry.”
“I know. I’ll be fine. Just,” he sighed, hands shoved into his pockets, “don’t have the best memories of this place.”
After a while, he let his hands drop. He turned back to the ocean. Tried to find again that sense of quiet.
They were standing in a room which might have been an attic once, though it was hard to tell because every single inch of it was crowded with boxes. Not just boxes, Harry saw with a grimace, but large cabinets and chests, a few bookcases shoved to the point of bursting with books and parchment and scrolls. It looked, oddly enough, like the Room of Requirement. There were fewer busts of old wizards and piles of discarded treasure, but it carried the same sense of immense, chaotic knowledge which had built over hundreds of years.
He rolled himself out of bed, toeing off his shoes and discarding clothes as he trudged his way upstairs to the bathroom—not the bathroom on his floor, because the pipes in the third floor bathroom liked to smack him in the head sometimes if he took too long. As he passed, though, he felt a weird tingle on the back of his neck. Out of the corner of his eye, he…
There was probably an important distinction there but he didn’t want to try too hard to figure it out.
Should he go to the Ministry? Could he even get up and walk, in this state? He wouldn’t be able to apparate. He wouldn’t even be able to heal himself.
It was nicer. Harry couldn’t deny that. But he also couldn’t deny that without the shroud of darkness this house had lived under for lifetimes, without the ominous presence—it felt more like a house. Just a house. A house who still seemed to be perfectly capable of some degree of sentience, but it was still unfamiliar. At least the house in which Sirius had lived and died a little every day until his true, final death had held something of those he’d lost. Like the two-way mirror. Even shattered, it reminded him of Sirius. It might have been broken but there were still traces of his godfather in the cracks.
He had his hood up, his shoulders slouched, and as he walked past he threw a glance over his shoulder, like he was checking to see that no one was following him. The headline was something about him disappearing from Wizarding Society after the war, dated over a month ago, before the start of the trials. Beneath the first page they were more, clippings of him or stories about him, speculating on where he was, what he was doing, who he was seeing, what his plans were, if he was hiding something, et cetera.
“The look of the future is sleek and simple, and the New Millenium will be christened with chrome.” Harry snorted. “Must have gotten that out of a brochure. There was also something about the silver balls balancing out the energy but I stopped listening at that point because otherwise I wouldn’t have gotten out alive.”
Harry looked again at Kingsley, urging him to speak, feeling a hint of the desperation he’d felt when Dumbledore had come to his defense in this very room only to ignore him, to distance himself. To ignore him for a year until he was forced to come in and
It wasn’t until he started looking through the books himself, following Regulus’s process as he tried to understand what Voldemort was doing, that he started to learn how a horcrux was formed.
A flash of white at the far edge of the room caught his eye—the shape indistinct but tall and thin, a person, maybe—but when he turned to look it was gone.
He’d just killed someone’d he’d gone to school with and he was worried about whether or not he fancied blokes? The fuck was wrong with him?
Of course, I don’t expect you to care whether or not I get killed because someone didn’t like my playing the properly cowed and obliging former war criminal. You’d probably think it deserved.” His rancor flickered, a dark note dropping into his voice. “It wouldn’t be the first time, would it?”
Not the version Harry was working from, anyway. He’d looked through the library upstairs to try and find any newer spellbooks just to compare, but the latest one he’d come across was
With that, he turned and joined Zabini and Nott, leaving Harry to stare at his artfully flaring robes and the tight span of his back.
He made it to the apparition point in the alley out back, grateful there wasn’t queue. The wards on his new flat gave him a bit of trouble—one of the
“All right,” Andromeda murmured, “try to relax, Harry. This will work easier if you aren’t fighting it.”
“The only offensive thing I can see right now is that suit. Did you fish it out of a bin on your way here, or did you just grab some old curtains and beat them to death?”
Harry took his reassurances with a tight smile, well aware that Robards thought he was telling the truth. But when he saw Malfoy walk in every night, passing Harry on his way out, sometimes followed by other Slytherins, some from his year, even—Daphne Greengrass, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott—he wanted to march up to the Aurors’ Office and shout Robards down, to find this Yeats woman and ask her how the hell she thought this was all right.
More footsteps came from the Great Hall. He didn’t want anyone to offer him comfort. He didn’t want anyone to talk him through the hole opening up in his chest. He needed to get somewhere he could—
had been the perfect way to make sure that Harry believed wholeheartedly that he was the right person to do it, to take up Dumbledore’s crusade. He’d further isolated Harry, telling him to keep his mission secret, to ignore the help offered to him by older, much more experienced wizards. But he couldn’t have told anyone else, could he? Because if Harry had told Molly or McGonagall or Remus, they would have objected right away to Dumbledore’s sending three
“Doesn’t matter. I’ve seen you fly. You’re brilliant.” Charlie waved a hand at Bill. “Plus, I’ve heard about how good you are for seven bleeding years from
The reassurance was enough to get him through his fireplace and into the Ministry of Magic, and after, well—he had plenty of practice being the center of unpleasant attention.
With every ring activated, the others grew brighter—white light threaded through with spring green, bringing a scent of trees and open air, a potential, a kind of ecstatic violence. It made his brown skin look almost gold in the light.
A cry of fury ripped his calm apart. Harry was pulled forcibly back to the fight. Voldemort had seen him. He dropped back into the battle with a piercing regret and faced his last task.
Robards closed his eyes with a heavy sigh. “I will have to eventually, yes.” When he looked at Harry again, he could see conflict in the old man. So it wasn’t just Kingsley who’d found what was going on distasteful. It seemed a lot of people were opposed, actually.
“Of course. I’m not the first muggleborn to think about it. It’s a bit complicated, but there’s a small wizarding society in the city and they apparently do this quite often.” She smiled. “I have to say, it’d be interesting to see what it’s like. I used to dream about going to university as a child, where I would apply.”
Kreacher looked at Harry’s hand, and then back at his face. His eyes narrowed, still a bit shiny. “Master is not spending much time here in the noble House of Black since he inherited. Kreacher is thinking Master doesn’t like the house. Like Master Sirius.”
Her face twisted in what looked like a forced smile, her eyes still shiny. “Thank you, Harry.” She patted him on the cheek, the gesture so motherly it twisted something deep and long-neglected inside him. “And while I know it’s not for me, having you around the house this week has been—well, it’s been wonderful to have someone else to talk to, frankly.”
As the crowd churned and people reached out to touch him, to make sure he was alive and whole, to grab onto a piece of him and pull, Harry’s eyes shifted as if by compulsion to a gap between the many, many heads.
Anger flickered up like a candle’s flame stirred by a breeze. “But I… It doesn’t matter what I meant—”
“Surely he can tell you once he’s rested,” Andromeda said in alarm as she came back into the sitting room. “He needs—”
Robards said, “I’ve already informed the Minister, and he’s elected to allow me to conduct this investigation in secret, for now.”
Panic shot through him like fire and he jerked in the crushing grip. He was dying. He was letting himself be killed. He couldn’t, not after everything he’d gone through—he’d
To create a horcrux, you needed an empty vessel, an empty body. The body was empty only when the soul had been severed, separated. Only when the person was dead.
He must have, or Voldemort couldn’t have made him into a horcrux. And whatever magic had been wrought when his mum died for him, it had brought him back. It, and the shard of Voldemort’s soul, reanimating him. Before Voldemort reclaimed his body he could have possessed as many people as he liked, but he shouldn’t have been able to after… And yet Voldemort
“Outside of all this,” Bill pulled his other hand out of his pocket and gestured, “are you doing okay? I realize this is a bloody nightmare but I haven’t heard much from you since you left Shell Cottage. Settling into London all right? I know Ron kicked you out, the little bastard.”
Harry and Ron stood there staring at each other, both of them breathing hard, making the silence all the more horrible. That same gulf he’d felt between him and Hermione in the atrium bathroom had opened up between him and Ron, and he felt all at once a stranger. Ron had no idea,
Had it been real? Or was it just Dumbledore making him think it was better for him to be an emotional wreck, better to be an open wound? Maybe he thought letting Harry get himself killed would be a blessing. Maybe he thought, if he could push Harry so far to the edge that he was barely hanging on, Harry would want to die. Maybe Dumbledore thought he was doing Harry a favor by telling him he had no choice but to accept that his life was nothing but a series of stabs through his broken, tainted heart.
A senior Ministry official. Bill had said Kingsley had managed to convince the Wizengamot to keep these kids out of Azkaban long enough to give them a fair trial, but he’d wanted to do more. He’d argued against Hogwarts’s closing. He’d thought Yeats was going too far, but he couldn’t outright object, or he’d lose support, and he’d be forced out of office.
In a moment of self pity, he wondered what his parents would have thought of him turning on the Ministry. The only first hand experience he’d had of his parents was filtered through Snape’s memories, and they weren’t even in the same country as impartial. He had stories from their friends, sure, and everyone who’d known them thought they were good people, moral, brave people, who didn’t deserve what happened to them. Maybe they’d understand.
Harry frowned at her before returning to his methodical tracing of one water droplet down the handle of the glass. “No, Robards did. Bill too. Malfoy got kind of pissy when I mentioned it, actually. Like he didn’t want to talk about it. Bill said he was being really cooperative. I even saw him offer to help, like he’s done it before.”
A silver-blue specter of a stag appeared out of his wand. It seemed to look back at him for a moment, and Harry felt a snap of horrible, clawing shame at the knowing, unyielding look of those depthless eyes, before it fled into the night.
With a growing sense of apprehension, Harry began. Regulus’s handwriting was small and compact, neat and sparing. He recognized it from the scrap of paper in the fake locket. There was no obvious organization to them, just lines and lines of cramped script interrupted at times by lists. He saw with a frown that much of it was written in other languages. French, he could recognize, and German, he guessed, but there were a few more he had no idea about. He thought he saw a bit of Russian, maybe. Or it might be Polish, he couldn’t be sure.
“Patrick.” She looked up at him expectantly, as if Harry was supposed to have exclaimed out loud. “Oh, but you know Patrick!”
A few days into the unofficial project he stumbled on a new section of the attic, or he thought it’d been a few days—he’d taken to sleeping on a cot he’d conjured rather than make the trip downstairs every night and back up every morning, and Kreacher was delivering his meals up here now rather than down in the kitchen. Really, this house was far bigger than he remembered it being. Even the ceilings seemed to be taller, the halls wider. Maybe he was just getting used to it, but the claustrophobia he always used to feel in Grimmauld Place was ebbing ever so slightly.
But he wasn’t just blindly following someone else’s words, not like with Snape’s potions book or Riddle’s diary. He understood the magic he was performing. He might not understand
“You know,” Luna continued, looking far too earnest and just a bit concerned, “sex? I’m talking about—”
Cedric had looked the same. His large frame spread out over the ground with an unnatural stillness. Eyes dark and wide. All the tiny signs of life severed. Dumbledore, Fred, Colin, Remus, Tonks—they all had the same unreality. Like time had frozen around them as the rest of the world kept turning.
After the second, more insistent tap of the owl, he moved to the window. With a small pang of heartache he fished a treat out of the little jar he kept there, stroking the bird’s head as it munched happily and gave him a soft hoot of thanks. It’d been over a year now since Hedwig’s death. He still didn’t know if he wanted to get another owl. Every time he really thought about it, it made him feel horrible. Like it was an insult to her memory.
Harry startled, getting ketchup on his t-shirt when he bumped his plate and one of the sausages made a break for freedom. He shook his head, trying to think of nothing at all. “Ah. No. Sorry, Kreacher, I think I’m full.”
Tears fell down Hermione’s face as she listened, frozen in horror, and he hated it. He hated this. He felt like he was being ripped apart. All the frustration and listlessness of the last three months were torn to shreds and the only thing left was this white-hot kernel of pain where his heart was supposed to be. He didn’t know what he was saying, but he couldn’t stop.
He looked smaller now. More normal. Like all the other seventeen-year-old kids who had gone through a war. Seventeen. Bloody hell, they were all
The entity—which now had the vague outline of a person, a body, at least—sank lower until it was almost kneeling in front of him. Something brushed his cheek. An old, horribly tired sigh broke the silence.
A wry, pained smile pulled at Kingsley’s mouth. “Before you get started, you should know that it has always been my intention to minimize the amount of chaos the war left in its wake. Letting the public know that two Slytherin students attempted to kill someone the country thinks of as their hero would just fan the flames.” Even as Harry opened his mouth, Kingsley continued implacably, “I’m going to insist on this, Harry. For your safety and for the safety of the students you rightly championed in the trials.”
more like—up to Harry, his eyes sizing up the old woman like she was a piece of furniture at an auction he found wanting. Apparently he judged the combination of colors on her person just as offensive as Harry had, because his expression twisted into one of such bored distaste he had to have practiced it in the mirror for hours when he was younger. No one just
His vision blurred with tears. He tried to hold them in, but he didn’t seem to have any control over himself anymore. He was shaking, and he was cold, and he’d— He’d—
“You know exactly what it means!” Ron’s voice raised until the whole hallway was filled with it. “You just gave an interview to the fucking Quibbler about how the poor purebloods are being unfairly punished and then you lay into Hermione like it’s
It took them two weeks just to let me leave the house alone. It’s perfectly reasonable for me to take a few months off and spend time with my
He pushed his hair off his face, dirt and sweat and blood coating his palm, getting stuck in his hair. He took another few steps up the staircase.
“By terrifying children?” he practically shouted. A few people gave him startled looks as his voice rang through the atrium.
He should go back and apologize. He knew he should. Hermione meant well. Of course she did. They could talk about this and… Fuck, he didn’t know. But whatever it was would probably be better than him sulking by himself in a park at night.
Robards produced a small box from his pocket and placed it on the table, murmuring a spell and expanding it until it was the size of an average suitcase. “I’ve had a few people working on this. Felicity Burbage you’ll remember, as well as a private consultant more familiar with—this kind of thing. He’s been working with us for a while, so we know his information is good.” Nothing about his voice changed, but Harry caught the small flick of his eyes toward Bill, Bill’s slight shift and the momentary tightening of his hand.
Malfoy’s jaw worked as they stared at each other but if he intended to say anything, it wasn’t coming out. Harry looked down into those pale grey eyes and saw every bit of Malfoy’s fear screaming up at him. Every bit of helplessness. Everything he had witnessed through Voldemort’s eyes when he’d forced Malfoy to torture Rowle and watch as Nagini desecrated the corpse of Charity Burbage. Harry hated how he understood everything Malfoy wasn’t speaking aloud. He fucking
“If there is one thing at which my family excels,” Malfoy said in clipped, flat tones, “it is survival. I’m no use to them locked up on a rock in the middle of the sea.” The muscle in his jaw feathered. “You saw what the Manor had become near the end. I didn’t fancy living in that kind of filth the rest of my life. Thought I’d divest myself of some of it.” A tremor ran across his face. He added, almost as if he couldn’t help it, “One year was enough.”
Harry blinked. He certainly seemed to be feeling worse than normal, but Harry’s normal wasn’t exactly healthy either.
Robards’s frown had softened, almost like he was confused. “In his own testimony, Draco Malfoy didn’t specify if he had been coerced to follow Voldemort’s orders or if he followed them willingly. He simply confessed. You seem to think it was the former. If you had to guess, why do you think he didn’t defend himself?”
, he knew that, and some part of his body bristled as he tried to recall. It was strange—he usually remembered his dreams. They were vivid to the point of prophetic, but he couldn’t…
He’d never given much thought to the house system before. It had made sense, putting people who were similar together, judging people by their values and their morals.
He snatched off his glasses and pressed the heels of his palms to his eyes, pain-prick lights erupting against the black of his eyelids. He clenched his jaw to stop what little there was left inside him from spilling out and setting the floor, the mirror, himself on fire. Setting it all on fire.
went through, or Hermione or any of the other kids who spent the last year of their lives in hell! But you want to use me to boost your propoganda, to make you all feel better about yourselves? You want
Ron nearly face planted when Harry opened the door. It was dark outside, the light from the street lamps soft and orange.
Tom’s smile was a drug, a lovely, wonderful drug and Harry wanted to drown in it. It was darkness and desire and every ounce of furious longing Harry had been holding inside himself for years. An offer to let go. To just…stop fighting. To give it all up and let someone else look after him. He was so tired of being angry, of being alone, he was so
He breathed deeply and slowly until his hands stopped shaking. The spell itself was as simple as the one he’d used to Cleanse the plant, but it was going to draw a lot more from him than a small bead of blood. He didn’t know how much, though. Enough to overpower this thing, the dark presence which had lingered in this house since the moment he walked in the door. Probably since Sirius was young as well, maybe even longer. It felt old, whatever it was. It’d had plenty of time to grow mad and desperate.
Kreacher nodded, humming in a gravely voice. “Yes, Kreacher is thinking of something Master Harry could do. Something important.” Kreacher eyed him warily again, as if he too were reconsidering. “Yes, yes, all right, master is wanting to be helpful, to
did it have to be Malfoy who’d told him in the first place and forced him to face what he’d already known in his heart? Anyone else would have been better than him, and the worst part was Harry didn’t even regret what he’d said in Mafloy’s favor. It would have been easier if he did, but Draco Malfoy wasn’t the problem here. Not anymore.
That he didn’t even want to try made him want to curl into a ball and never speak to anyone again. It made him feel like the biggest git on this planet. Like the lowest, foulest idiot. He was broken. This was his fault. It had to be.
“None of this has anything to do with you,” Harry said loudly, forgetting to keep his voice down. He didn’t want anyone else coming out here to check on him, not when
“Thank you again, Andromeda,” Robards said quietly, his stoic expression creasing into something like a smile as he dipped his head. The imposing man turned back to Harry. He met Harry’s gaze with a frank sigh. “I realize we’ve gotten off on the wrong foot, Mr. Potter, but you should know that my offer stands, should you ever decide you want to become an auror. What you did in the Wizengamot was brave. Brash and explosive, but…” He trailed off, sharing a solemn look with Kingsley. “Well. I think we could all benefit from a little more courage. I know I could.”
It took him a solid five minutes to walk about thirty feet, but he got out without incident, managing to keep his mouth shut as the reporters hurled increasingly wild speculations at him. As soon as he stepped out of the throng and down the steps to the atrium, he spotted Hermione—waiting for him with her arms crossed, a badly crumpled copy of the Quibbler in her hand, and the kind of anger in her eyes Harry had long ago learned to fear.
“I know. It’s—it’s fine. They asked me about him earlier so I guess I just wasn’t expecting him.” He finished his drink to give him time to relax. It worked a bit. His hands weren’t shaking anymore as he wiped them off with a napkin Hermione offered him. “You know he has to check in everyday?” His voice sounded off to his own ears, higher and clipped, overprecise. “Him and all the other Slytherins. There’s a list and everything. Their wands are monitored, too.”
A symbol flashed before his eyes—an inverse of the symbol on the other wooden book sitting safely upstairs. It rang with a gong’s strength and cracked something inside of Harry, broke out of his chest in a violent cry. He didn’t even have time to be alarmed, though, before the symbol morphed, shifted into the other, familiar one. It was steady and solid and for a moment he felt the jagged edges where whatever magic had punched out of himself lingered, splintered and raw. But the feeling vanished and the cracks resealed, tightened, bound themselves in metal and blood. The seventh barrier fell softly into place.
Harry had nothing. Becoming an auror had been his path, he’d never thought about anything else. He didn’t think he was good for anything else besides fighting dark wizards and helping people. That’s all he was, really.
He waited for the tears to come like they had when he’d set Dobby down in his little grave. Like they had right before he’d killed Voldemort. He almost wanted them to overflow and overtake him. He stood by the lake and the little copse of evergreens, waiting for catharsis or release, until the sun began to fall again through the sky, cutting down through the clouds.
“Five days,” Ron started, voice unsteady with the anger Harry knew was ready to burst out of him. “Five
“Harry, steady,” Bill said, face a mixture of anger and worry, “you’re not going anywhere. You can’t even manage to stay on your feet.” He stood and braced Harry when he swayed, a fit of nausea making him dizzy. “You can’t just rush out and—”
Harry’s breath was coming fast and sharp, his mouth locked shut in case he decided to start screaming.
It was over as quickly as Hermione’s. Harry stood there while Madam Yeats called for further questions from the Wizengamot. Kingsley had refrained from speaking, but Harry hadn’t expected him to. He was well known to have been part of the Order of the Phoenix. People would think he was playing favorites if he interfered. He had to distance himself to protect his job.
The entity rippled beyond his sight, the darkness shifting until Harry felt eyes on his sweating face. Quite a few, actually. Definitely more than two.
It was like his whole chest had been wrenched pleasantly around. It was the longest he’d gone without seeing Teddy since meeting him, and it was almost painful, the flaring of joy he felt.
He couldn’t help but picture Sirius doing the same, drifting through the halls of his childhood home, hating every room with its moldy plaster and peeling wallpaper, wanting nothing more than to get out of this mausoleum and fight. Wanting it so badly he’d left to save Harry.
Their laugh gusted out into the air. Harry nearly reached out for it, wanting to hold it and listen to it again and again. It was so soft, surprised. Like a white feather.
Later, when he was helping wash up and Teddy had finally deigned to lay down for a nap, he felt Andromeda’s gaze on his cheek. He let it go for a while, sensing it was the kind of look that came with a heavy conversation, but he couldn’t hold out forever. When he finally did look, the expression on her face made him stop cold.
Robards waited, but Harry kept his mouth shut, his jaw clenched tight against the chaos of thoughts battling it out in his own head.
because it meant she had done this with some other bloke. He had a history of being wildly jealous of other blokes being within five feet of Ginny—but he just felt guilty. He felt bad that this was probably disappointing for her, because while he enjoyed the act itself after he figured out what the fuck he was doing, it wasn’t special. Even he could tell that it was pretty underwhelming. It was just…nice. He liked Ginny. He was attracted to Ginny. He liked sex, which was actually quite a relief to know for sure now, but there was nothing else there. It was just sex, when it should have been the first night of the rest of his life.
, and it filled him with panic at the idea that he was so woefully unworthy of the job of protecting him.
The plant shook and collapsed. Its leaves and petals crumpled and withered until it was no more than a pot of potpourri.
he said harshly at Hermione’s confusion, “I saw his memories in Dumbledore’s pensieve after he died. That’s what he gave me. He was in love with my mum his whole life and when she picked my dad over him, he lost his mind. He treated me like I was worthless for six years because she didn’t fancy him, and he was supposed to be Dumbledore’s man.
“Ah, but the ‘nearly’ bit makes all the difference.” Charlie cocked his head. “Wait, you’re not talking about Norberta, right? She was just a baby. Not that she wasn’t up to it, but I got the impression she took most of her love out on Hagrid.”
“They shouldn’t be hard to find if you can get your hands on a Welsh dragon scale or tongue. You might even be all right with an Irish Kettle Roc. When you do get the bones, you could try soaking them in Pome’s Tears for a few days. Might help when you try to shatter the curse. Trallod Du tend to explode violently and embed themselves in the eyes of anyone present.”
“Key word being ‘nearly,’ yeah. He survived, didn’t he? How do we know that wasn’t his plan all along? He could have turned hours before but he waited until the last second.”
