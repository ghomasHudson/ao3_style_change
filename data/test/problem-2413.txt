There wasn’t even any disgruntled Auror who had been reassigned from Azkaban to question – a fact that still nagged at Harry every day. If Lucius Malfoy had somehow slipped several letters past the prison’s security system, shouldn’t someone have been made to answer for that somehow? But no – from the outside, absolutely nothing had changed. Not even Ron, an Auror himself, could get a decent answer.
It took Harry a full minute to realize what he had just said, and to whom. When he looked back at Malfoy, the other man was staring at the floor, his shoulders hunched and his hands shoved into the pockets of his robes.
It had begun innocuously enough, with the usual morning meeting running long (they never could seem to get through all of the new Death Eater cells in only an hour) and Ron walking him back to his office as they went over logistics for a raid next week. Ron had made a wry joke about needing more pumpkin juice and Harry had laughed. Then Ron had made a more serious comment about Draco Malfoy’s potential involvement with the latest underground Dark Magic network, and Harry had not laughed.
The words had lost their initial power under the wear of repeated readings. Still, Draco felt his breath hitch, his cheeks burning. The words themselves looked kindly on paper; in his father’s voice, he knew, they would sting with scorn.
She trailed off again, but Malfoy smirked. “An exiled Death Eater who may or may not be going to Azkaban for the rest of his life? Yes, Granger, I’m aware that I’m hardly the ideal parenting candidate.”
“We kissed,” Draco began. “When you found me, and it was – gods, Potter, it was really good. A lot of this has been really good, actually, but –”
“I really do, you idiot,” he said, and then he kissed Draco.
“And how much is a promise to a Death Eater worth, hm?” Harry snapped. “I’d watch your tone with me, Malfoy, if you know what’s good for you.”
And to tell Malfoy that Viola was doing well. He had stopped by Ron and Hermione’s last night for dinner, and had made a point to talk to Viola and let her show him her new bed, the books on the shelf by her small table, and Theodore, her stuffed plush dragon. He thought Malfoy would especially enjoy that last part.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. “In a manner of speaking.” He tilted his head. “Why do you ask?”
. He supposed that was why thestrals were usually used in these sorts of moments, and wondered why they weren’t using thestrals today. Then he realized it was very likely that far, far more wizards could see thestrals now, after Voldemort’s rise to power and hard-won fall, and stopped thinking altogether.
“I guess I did, yeah,” Harry said slowly. “I wonder if I still would.”
Draco sighed and put down his chopsticks. “Listen, Potter,” he said, smirking when Harry’s head shot up at the use of his last name. “We need to talk about...about our –” He motioned at the air between them. “...Whatever this is.”
“I have something,” she said without preamble as she gestured with her wand. The bag of groceries landed gracefully on the kitchen counter, but Ron didn’t even peek inside to see what they were. He, like Harry and everyone else in the room, had their eyes fixed on Luna.
"He's allergic to raspberries."
“Harry?” Just like before, Harry hummed to show he was listening but didn’t take his focus off of Draco’s hand. “I… Thank you.” Harry just nodded, still smiling.
Now that he’d survived and made it into his third year at Hogwarts, Harry enjoyed speaking Parseltongue. He'd been scared of it at first because of the way everyone had reacted but, when Draco came back for their third year and hissed at him, Harry was delighted. It became a secret, sort of, and he and Draco spoke solely in it. At first it had been insults—the same ones Draco said in English, usually—but when none of the goons or bystanders understood Draco quickly stopped. If he wanted to insult him, he would do it in English. But, slowly, that stopped too. Until, one day, he'd been sitting in History of Magic and faint little hissing sound had tickled his ear.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” He blushed unconsciously, but refused to be embarrassed by this.
“I'm so proud of you, Draco.’ Draco's heart stopped. He’d heard wrong, right? He had to have heard the boy wrong because there was no way he’d said
"Did you ask Snape about the anaphylactic stimulant?" Again, Hermione frowned but Harry didn't bother reading that one. She knew that he suspected Snape, and she was not prepared to make such a heavy allegation against such a powerful man without evidence. Still, even if he hadn't done it himself, he might know who would have had the opportunity to.
“You sure? I hear I’m pretty irresistible.” They were teasing, and Harry might have even called it friendly banter or flirting. With Draco’s palms on his chest, though, he didn’t care what they called it as long as they didn’t stop because this felt so horribly familiar…
you two? Not like anything dirty, of course, but there's a lot that he hides from us, I think, because we're still set in the dynamics we established in First Year. What's he like outside of that?" Draco shrugged. He honestly wasn't sure how he was supposed to answer that, but clearly Hermione had something in mind. Something they wouldn't know about Harry…
Harry tried not to feel the rush of warmth beneath his skin because he didn’t want Draco to be hurting but it felt good to comfort him like this. It was a good, cathartic kind of breakdown. He knew this better than he knew himself, and the way that Draco fit against his chest never failed to make it feel like he was coming home. God, he’d missed this more than he’d realized.
"I'm sure it is, Mrs. Dursley." The tension was thick in the air but, for once, Harry didn't really want to hide from it. That instinct was still there, of course, and simmering in his gut like a bad potion but it wasn't strong enough to actually make him move, which was progress. Instead, he merely stood and watched the two.
"Mr. Malfoy, you cast an Unforgivable Curse today and, in doing so, killed your own father. What do you have to say for yourself?" Draco prayed that Harry would stick to the plan. He had to, right? There was no way that Harry would pull any of that hero bullshit at a time like this, not when there was so much at stake. Right?
” Harry had gone quiet and slightly pale, though, and Draco squeezed his hand because now he was worried. Why wouldn’t Harry tell? If McGonagall got that protective over Draco, someone she didn’t even care about, then clearly Harry had to know she would spare no expense to protect him. Besides, if one secret was out and they were already facing the consequences… Might as well get it over with, right?
“You doing okay, Draco?” He nodded to Pansy but immediately turned to Blaise.
“You are the love of my life, Draco, and you’ve always known that. I know we broke up for a reason—for a lot of reasons—but that doesn’t mean I gave up on us. We both needed space, and we both needed time to figure out our own issues before trying to deal with each other’s and I get that. But I miss you so much. Yes, it hurts, but I don’t care because it’s worth it, to me.
“I—my sincere apologies,” Draco finally said, his voice low. “I had not thought to ask how you want to handle money. That—I’m sorry,” he finished. He sounded almost desperate. “Whatever you want to do, however you want to proceed, is fine—”
“Of course,” Kingsley said graciously, moving back towards the door. “Rest well, Mr. Malfoy, and please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.” He paused at the door. Smiled again. “I seem to be in your debt.” Then he was gone.
“Good choice,” he said. Then: “
Before Harry could say anything, Draco stepped out from behind him. He had stopped shaking, but his eyes were fixed on the floor.
“If I say no, sir?” Draco asked quietly. “What happens then?”
He was making up for it now. As he and Ron began investigations into the Viola Hathaway missing child case, Harry found himself thinking about Malfoy quite a bit: where he could possibly be, what he had been doing for the past six years, why he had kidnapped this girl. What he was like now.
He did. Draco could see it in Shaver’s eyes: a taunting knowledge that Draco was, again, completely in his power.
“Do you want to start cutting up some bananas?” Harry asked. When Malfoy nodded, he passed the other man three bananas, a knife, and a cutting board. They worked for a few moments, the silence broken only by the clip clip of Malfoy’s knife against the cutting board and the sound of Harry’s whisk against the mixing bowl.
“There’s no one here,” Harry whispered, moving away from the last window. “Do you think we came to the wrong place? Shouldn’t Fairchild be here, if no one else?”
Harry felt as if someone had thrown a bucket of icy water over his head. He had been expecting this – had been trying to prepare himself for it – but nothing could have prepared him for having Draco alive and whole before him telling him that their marriage wouldn’t work. He swallowed hard himself.
“It…good…it was good,” Draco replied hastily, looking like a deer in Muggle headlights. He shot a quick glance at the people beside them, who turned away hurriedly and pretended they had never stopped to stare. All except for a rather rotund man of middling height who pushed through the crowd of shoppers toward them.
“Tell me, Mr. Malfoy: how old were you when you voluntarily joined the Death Eaters?”
“Harry! Please lie down!” It was Hermione, her concerned eyes huge in the lamplight. “You were injured, you’re here at St. Mungo’s, you’ll be alright but you have to remain still and calm.”
“I heard what he was saying,” he said excitedly. “‘To the house of the lord.’ I think it’s the key that unlocks...whatever this is.” He waved a hand at the pavement before them, where Fairchild had disappeared. “Let’s go!”
When he got home that night, the flat’s living room was dark. He saw, gratefully, that Draco had left some soup on the range. He ladled some into a bowl, trying to move quietly so as not to disturb Draco in the bedroom. The door opened anyway, and Draco stepped out. He was dressed in creamy white flannel pajama pants and a dark blue shirt that hugged his chest. His blond hair was slightly tousled, as if he had been sitting up against the wall behind the bed.
After a surprisingly smooth ride across the ocean waters surrounding Azkaban, they Apparated directly into what looked like a dressing room, the man holding onto Draco’s arm a bit harder than seemed strictly necessary. Two more Ministry employees were waiting there, although these seemed to be more in the class of “make a man who has been in Azkaban for four years look healthy and happy again.” They washed and combed his hair, brought him new clothes, and one of the men even waved his wand in a practiced manner in front of Draco’s face. When he turned to look in the mirror, he recognized himself, which was startling. The dark circles under his eyes, stark against his pale face, had disappeared, and there even seemed to be some color in his cheeks. The man noticed him looking and smiled smugly.
He was looking at a white wall. A single window looked back at him. It was dark out. The light was coming from several lit lamps on either side of the window.
Her voice was soothing. Carefully, he lay back down until he was looking up at her.
“Please,” he said again. “You have to believe me.”
They sat together in the darkness, the silence broken by small waves lapping at the lake’s shore.
The wizard behind the desk was older than Draco remembered him, but still very recognizable as the man who had rented him and his mother horses all those years ago. The man looked up with an absent smile when they entered, then focused on Draco. His eyes widened.
“Yes,” he said.
Kingsley was nodding in a satisfied way. “Well said, Mr. Malfoy,” he remarked. Turning back to Harry, he spread his hands. “I’m sorry to ask this of you, Harry,” he said with a small sigh. “In some ways, fighting Voldemort was far easier than playing these political games. At least then, we knew exactly what we were dealing with.”
Wooooow thank y'all for your patience! Here's two chapters to make up for my loooooong silence.
“I do know you,” Draco sobbed, clutching at Harry as much as he could with the manacles in the way. “I know you are incredible, and brave, and idiotic, and this is exactly the kind of fucking hairbrained thing you
“Yes,” Harry shot back. “He’s worried sick about his daughter, and if you don’t give her to us right the fuck now —”
Draco didn’t answer.
Levering himself out of bed, Harry grabbed his glasses from the small table he had conjured to sit near his newly-conjured bed and shoved them onto his nose. He shuffled down the hall, his socks sliding along the familiar boards until he reached the kitchen. As he passed it, he noticed the bedroom door was still closed. He wondered how late Malfoy usually slept.
“Just making a mess of my life and hurting those around me, as usual,” he said with a grim attempt at humor. Neville didn’t smile.
“Yeah,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck, amused. “How about that.”
For now, they were moving in together, and that was more than enough. It had been four years since their divorce, and all was very, very well.
“Maybe you should talk to him,” he said, and Harry could only nod. Could only reach over and clasp Neville’s shoulder and hope that the other man understood.
Draco spent the remainder of the weekend wondering if he should tell Harry about his father’s letter.
, Harry, he let Death Eaters into
Harry followed her. He knew it was foolish, that his 20 minutes were passing quickly, but she might know something about Draco. He had to try.
“Maybe he doesn’t want your help,” Neville said slowly. “Maybe he wants to feel like he can help himself.” He was silent for a moment. “Have you asked him what he wants? How he feels?”
Lancelot was happily munching on the thick summer grass and Potter—heels floating up nearly out of the stirrups, shoulders slumped forward over the reins—was laughing uproariously. Draco found himself torn between annoyance and hilarity. The sun was warm on his shoulders, peeking out from behind the clouds, and he suddenly felt like moving fast. Lady must have sensed his eagerness. She whinnied and flicked her ears back, listening to him.
“Anyone in our circle who stayed out of the war left England long ago,” Malfoy responded grimly. “Even if I could get in touch with them, I doubt they’d be open to taking Viola, even if she’s only half Malfoy.” He grimaced, shooting a glance at Hermione from under heavy lids. “That kind of compassion is really more your side’s thing.”
“...what he wants to do with the prisoners,” one voice was saying. It sounded like a man’s voice, deep and rumbling.
“Throw that thing away,” he said for the hundredth time, and plucked the wand out of Draco’s hand. “You can do it wandlessly, I know you can.” Suddenly serious, he placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders and took an exaggeratedly deep breath in. Seething, Draco did the same.
“But you’re getting there, and you’re doing well, right?” Harry pressed on determinedly. Draco nodded hesitantly, as if unsure what he was agreeing to. “And I really like not feeling stressed all the time. I think we should celebrate.”
Harry was baffled. “Forgot your place? What…what do you mean?”
There were several questions like this, all so that she could pinpoint the exact location of his injury. After a few moments, she took a deep breath and raised her wand.
“You kept this from me? For months?” He only realized he was striding forward when Draco took several steps back. “I mean, I can understand the first little while, you thought I was plotting against you, but now? Still?”
his chest would seize, and that he would forget he was the one suffocating himself from the inside out. They'd done this so many times…
“Because you look like home.” Draco paled, letting his hand shake as he fingered the material of the sweats that neither of them would claim ownership of, but he didn’t run. That was progress, right? He took a step closer, testing the limits, but Draco shook his head almost instantly. It was the blond who moved closer, who closed the distance between them, and who eased his robes off of his shoulders. He would have gladly left them on the floor, but Draco spelled them over neatly into the closet.
Draco steeled himself when he heard Hermione’s telltale voice coming towards them in the hallway, but she merely fell into step with a smile.
"Hey, mind if I join you?" Draco jolted, more than shocked to see bushy hair and Gryffindor-red robes standing in the break in the curtain. Why was Hermione here? Part of him couldn't help wondering if she'd been sent by the Ministry or one of the Aurors to play good-interrogator. But, it was Hermione reaching out so he nodded, taking the risk. She sat beside his bed with a little sympathetic smile.
"I did not." The Ministry official scowled as he wrote that down, but Harry forced himself to stay calm. Short of Veritaserum, which was illegal to use, they were completely dependent on him and Draco to know what had happened.
not Harry’s and, as far as he was concerned, Draco had as much right to everything in it as he did. He didn’t say any of that, though. Instead, he merely nodded and stood, letting Draco get up on his own and follow when he was ready.
"Mr. Potter, how are you feeling?" He hadn't even opened his eyes or stopped to process the killer headache that was pounding inside his skull but he knew that voice.
“He doesn’t like that name.” Surprisingly, McGonagall didn’t argue or even question it she just turned back to Draco as Harry hid his face in the blond’s hair.
Thanks so much for reading!! Any feedback/comments are greatly appreciated and I hope to update soon!
"Mr. Potter, this is not a joking matter." No shit, they were potentially both going to Azkaban if they didn't follow their plan to the letter.
AN I don't own HP or any of the characters!
"They weren't. A lot of people are still looking into it but the theory that's gaining the most traction is boggarts. It seems unlikely, I know, but if he could have somehow gotten a boggart in front of someone that he knew it would take the form of a Death Eater for, he could have theoretically duplicated it to make it seem like… You get the idea. I don't know how true it is but that's what they're guessing right now. No one was hurt, and that's one of the reasons that they think it was an ultimately harmless creature or a duplicated illusion." Draco nodded like that made sense, but his mind was reeling.
love you, was what he should have said. Because they weren’t getting back together and they didn’t live together or love each other anymore. That last part was what always tripped Harry up, though.
"It's
“Be careful, Draco.” Luna stood and moved to the door but didn’t take her eyes off of him. “You have fragile skin and humans were never meant to have scales.”
"Hey, breathe. It's okay, babe, I get it." And Draco did get it, at least as much as anyone else could understand something he didn't understand himself. Harry, of all people, knew that. He'd been the one to stand beside Draco as they watched his father's execution and he'd been the one to hold the blond's hand as Lucius was buried. Draco had cried with
"I can't answer that." She didn't have to, though, because he'd known her for years and he could read her like a book. So someone had tried to poison him after all… He'd been hearing rumors of anaphylactic agents being added in as well, which made sense given that his usual reaction to raspberries was breaking out in hives, not losing the ability to breathe. Who would even have access to that kind of ingredient, though?
It sounded so intense and so sincere, but Hermione was looking directly at him now. She looked slightly nervous, or a little uncertain, but she was confident in her words like always and Draco could appreciate that. He nodded to her, trying to remember the words so he could process them later when he wasn't so out of it.
The press circled them like vultures. He had no doubt that the front page tomorrow would be covered in pictures of him and Draco, each standing on opposite ends of the same grave. It would be easy, with the angles, to cut out Narcissa and Pansy. Rumors would start, but the distance between them would ultimately keep them from spreading very far. Reporters approached and crowded each of them but, while Harry answered curtly and politely the way he’d been trained, Draco merely stared at the slow-filling hole in front of him.
“They’re all very worried about you, you know.”
It was later that day, in their hidden hospital room, that Blaise and Pansy came to see him. Harry was still there, refusing to leave his side, and Draco squeezed his hand as they approached to get him to be nice. Both looked disgusted that Harry was even touching him at all. But as they got closer, they grew emotionless.
“He really fucked you up, didn’t he?” Draco didn’t have to nod, he didn’t think he could given their current situation, because it wasn’t really a question. Harry squeezed his hand again.
to one another during hard times? Like, oh I don't know, a funeral? Call me unobservant, but you don't seem very supportive." The room was silent now, listening to the blond because he'd put on his Malfoy voice and it was impossible not to give him your full attention. Harry knew from experience. But, Draco was far from done.
"I did not."
"Yeah, but he's like that with us, or at least in front of us, too. What about when it's
“I’m sure you have a weakness.” Pale eyebrows rose in his direction, but Harry didn’t back down. Draco had come to him, Draco had started this conversation, Draco had put them in this position, and Harry was not going to stop it. The blond smirked, but eased himself back a bit.
. He tried desperately to focus on that sweet hissing sound as it brushed against his eardrums. Deep breaths, in and out, and soon enough this would all be over. He just had to remember the plan.
Harry couldn't really say he was surprised when he got the letter in the mail announcing Vernon Dursley's death. Since before he could even remember, his uncle had been the walking epitome of health issues and, between his horrid obesity and his staunch refusal to so much as go for a checkup, Harry wasn't shocked to read the frilly, romanticized cause of death.
It was Harry's turn to bite his tongue. He wanted to go off on her about how stupid it was to involve an outsider like Malfoy, let alone to do it without consulting the Aurors on her case. This was his job, though, not a bar fight so he merely forced a smile.
“Who?” Instantly, those grey eyes flicked to the ground. Draco took another deep breath. God, Harry wanted to just take a step closer and wrap the man in his arms until he lost that hollow weight in his expression. He wanted to hold the man who, against all odds, he still loved until he stopped trembling with every breath. His body knew better, though, so he stayed where he was.
but he couldn't be sure. For now, he didn't mind it, though. He let all thoughts of the funeral or his relatives leave his mind as he dragged his boyfriend back into their bedroom and snuggled into their bed. Finally, just the quiet morning he'd been hoping for.
Prew huffed, but seemed to ultimately decide that he'd dealt with enough childish behavior for one day. He stood, and beckoned Miss Le'Galle after him like some kind of secretary. She followed, looking bored. Pierre remained and was shuffling through paperwork like he was preparing himself to read it aloud, but Draco gagged at the thought of spending another second in the company of strange lawyers.
"That's the thing… They weren't Death Eaters."
That was utter bullshit. Uncle Vernon had gone on and on about his parents whenever he drank. They'd come over to the house while Harry had still been living there, and he could say with utmost certainty that the apple did not fall far from the tree and that Vernon Dursley was not even slightly devastated by his father's death. Still, Harry found himself tensing as he skimmed over the information for the memorial service.
“Mr. Potter, are you even listening?”
“Poppy, I want complete medical scans and physical examinations of each boy done as quickly as possible. If what they’re saying is true, this will go to the high court as early as tomorrow.” Draco didn’t bother to protest, even if that churned in his gut like acid, because he knew the school would take legal action. His father would be furious, but now that Harry was being protected he could face his father. He could disappear into himself and let the pain take him away, he could live in the basement of the Manor for the rest of his life and let his father do whatever he wanted. He could live with nothing but agony, as long as Harry was being protected.
"And passive aggressive, but we'd be foolish to expect anything less. If I did go, would you go with me?" Instantly, Draco's arms tightened in a gentle sort of half hug from behind.
“You’ve never hated me.” Draco just sighed against his chest. “I’ll tell you that I hate you too if that makes this easier for you.” The blond’s eyes were closed and Harry didn’t have to look to feel the glare, but he held his ground. They lay there in silence for far too long. Harry was sure that Draco would stand as soon as he was steady enough and Apparate away without a word of goodbye. He wanted to tighten his grip until the blond couldn’t even shift, but he didn’t. Forcing Draco to stay wouldn’t do any good.
Truly, that woman had been a ray of sunshine.
"No, just lay with me, mkay?" Draco kissed his forehead before spelling the curtains closed.
Draco knew his body. He alternated between massaging different muscle groups and teasing Harry’s stronger erogenous zones. Harry was hard, and about thirty seconds from humping the mattress, when Draco ground against him again. This time, though, he was much more direct. The blond knew his body, for better or for worse, and managed to grind the entirety of his erection into Harry’s prostate through the sweats. Harry spasmed on the bed, earning a low chuckle.
As always, I don't own HP or any of the characters! Confrontation chapter!
"Hey, baby, are you with me?" Instantly, Harry shot up off the bed. When had they gone to bed? It didn't matter, Draco only ever called him baby when something was very wrong and he was instantly on full alert. Had someone been chasing them? Was someone at the funeral from the Ministry? Was Draco hurt? Merlin, if he was—
"There was raspberry in the oatmeal, wasn't there?" Hermione frowned.
just like them goddammit—was a step too far.
Harry was very, very stupid. Evidently, Draco knew this because there was homemade mac and cheese steaming on the table and an offering of hard vodka beside it. Predictably, he'd let work overtake his life for the twelve hours that he was on the clock, and he was only just now pausing to remember the decision he was supposed to have made. Dammit.
Harry couldn't say for sure, but he was fairly certain that Malfoy still had the same snobby, aristocratic grace that he had when they were children. The blond had always bled good etiquette and carried himself like a prince. Nothing could change Malfoy's arrogance—Harry was sure of that.
"Okay, um… He sleeps on his stomach? He's really protective physically, like putting himself between me and other people. He's funny, I think, and really sarcastic. He swears all the fucking time but does it in Parseltongue so everyone thinks he's an angel. Um… He isn't ticklish. He likes to cook, but he doesn't do it very often. " She nodded, soaking that answer in, and Draco tried to focus on how neutral her body language was. Maybe it was intentional, or maybe Harry had coached her before all of this had happened, but he appreciated it immensely.
One step, two steps, three steps… Harry could have run to him—and he wanted to, more than anything—but Draco’s head snapped up and he froze. Slowly, Draco’s expression relaxed a little and he bit his lip. Was that permission? Before Harry could even start to take another step, though, the blond gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head and looked back to the grave.
"Slow down." Harry didn't question it, and immediately put the bottle back in the center of the table. Draco was calmly eating his mac and cheese, watching him with mild interest, but Harry knew better by now. He knew that the blond was very carefully monitoring his every move. Between the two of them, Draco was the expert on alcohol so Harry never argued whenever Draco told him to slow down, or even to stop. His goal wasn't to keep Harry sober, after all, it was just to keep him alive.
They ate the rest of the pancakes in fairly companionable silence. Harry kept trying to think of good topics of conversation, but too many of them included things that had happened while Malfoy was in Azkaban, or people Malfoy either wouldn’t know or had tortured at one time or another. Even Harry’s job was off-limits, he realized. How could you talk to a former Death Eater about hunting down former Death Eaters?
Or rather, less a chamber and more a…well,
After another moment, the words faded once more, leaving Draco standing in the bathroom holding a blank piece of parchment, his wand shaking and his breath coming in erratic gasps.
Malfoy nodded, his eyes still that soft gray that Harry thought was actually quite beautiful. “Thank you, Potter,” he said sincerely. “I – am very grateful for this.”
Harry groaned and sank onto the sofa. “This is bad, right?” he said quietly. “I don’t – I don’t know what to do. I mean, we could publish a rebuttal, but they’re – they’re not entirely wrong about some of it…”
sorry,” Draco said forcefully, then seemed to collect himself. “My past is not your concern,” he said, more quietly this time. “I know that. If you’ll excuse me.” He rose to his feet. “I am quite tired.”
Riley said nothing in response, but met Draco’s eyes. With a smooth motion that belied his years, he pulled up the left sleeve of his robe.
And now he was preparing to go horseback riding with Harry Potter, of all people. Draco was still half-expecting a punchline, some mocking joke or other that would leave him looking like a fool, with no options for retaliation without the threat of Potter reporting him to Warden. But so far, the other man had just asked him several questions about appropriate riding gear. Draco felt a little like he was dreaming.
“I have been in Azkaban, yes,” Lucius responded, his voice rumbling in Draco’s chest. “Some friends helped me escape. And they have helped me do other things too...”
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and fixed his eyes on Draco’s grainy black-and-white image, walking behind Kingsley with his head held high, jaw clenched.
“Hey,” he said, and waited until Harry looked at him to continue. “I know missing children cases are hard for you, and this one’s going to be even harder. I mean –” he gestured helplessly. “It’s fucking Malfoy, isn’t it? The git disappears for six years and then pops back up, a kidnapper.”
Beside him, Potter was already eating, his own glass of dark red wine already half empty. As if he felt Draco’s eyes upon him, he glanced up with a crooked smile in between bites of his steak and leaned over.
"It doesn't matter, just keep an eye on him if you can. How's the case looking?"
Thanks so much for reading! I know I've been MIA for a while but I am making a solid attempt to return with some regularity!
“You kept them.” Harry just nodded, ignoring the awe in Draco’s voice. “Why?”
spelled vertically down the left leg. His Quidditch sweats. Draco had always loved them—said they smelled like him, and that the material reminded him of when they’d first gotten together because Harry had worn them constantly. Harry had always loved seeing the Slytherin with his name quite literally on him.
"Oh come on, Harry, don't be daft. You know exactly what it's got to do with this. The Ministry would be insane to try to go after you, especially for the murder of a Death Eater, and they know it. Already, people are praising your name for ridding the Wizarding World of such a tyrant. But Draco, he's…"
Draco didn’t totally understand but Harry was warm so he curled into the slightly taller boy and nuzzled his chest. Harry laughed, shaking him with each breath, but Draco didn’t mind. It felt good, strangely. Finally, though, finally he was warm and the cold from the nightmare or the darkness couldn’t get to him and he felt Harry’s heartbeat against his cheek, reassuring him that Harry was there and that they were safe, and he was so warm… He fell asleep without even realizing what he was doing.
Hiring outside help was something they honestly should have expected. Harry had thought of it in a fleeting, apathetic way and if he'd bothered to consider it he might have even expected Malfoy to be her choice. He hadn't, though, so he was entirely caught off guard when he walked into the now familiar parlor and saw a man with platinum blond hair sitting beside the woman.
“What are you doing here?” It was choked and the words were heavy with tears but Harry heard them nevertheless. He’d gotten good at understanding Draco when he was like this.
"They're talking to Harry now, running tests on his wand and such. All they can get, though, is the shield spell he used for you guys, so I doubt anything will come of it. How are you holding up?" Draco could not believe his ears. Hermione Granger, of all people, was sitting beside him, inquiring about his health and updating him on Harry. Since when were they friends? He appreciated it, of course, and the company was a nice reprieve from his anxious wondering, but he couldn't help being surprised.
. He could just see Draco caving, trying to defend him or saying too much in his post-trauma state. Harry would kill him if he even thought about it.
"So, Harry," Petunia finally tried, turning away from Draco without making a decision. "You're an adult now. I trust you've graduated?"
"And I'll remind
“Yes, that’s perfect. Thank you, Prof- Minnie.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Harry interrupted the professor, though, with a choked little voice.
-lover, he corrected.
“Why are you…?” Draco wanted to ask a million questions but they all blurred together until they became one. “Just… why?” Harry smiled again, softly as he touched Draco’s cheek. He couldn’t remember the golden boy being so gentle or affectionate with anyone before, not even the rest of the trio. Was he dying, or something? But Harry just smiled at him, tracing his face.
Harry just cried and held him tight, occasionally shaking his head, but it was enough. Even if Harry never forgave him now Draco could at least die knowing he would be protected, that he would be safe. He risked a glance at McGonagall and Pomfrey, where they hadn’t moved. The head of Gryffindor house looked like she was seconds from passing out, and Draco watched her chest stutter over each breath as if she was struggling to comprehend anything at all, least of all what he’d said. Pomfrey was red in the face and shaking.
” Draco nodded, letting his head fall to Harry’s shoulder as he positioned himself to listen. He wasn’t upset. Just curious, honestly, because he couldn’t understand why anything would get the witch so worked up.
“I wouldn’t have come here if I didn’t trust your intentions.” Wait, what? Harry reeled, but those grey eyes were just resting calmly, staring back into his own without an ounce of hesitation or fear. Was that… permission? He tried to test the waters a bit by bringing one hand up to cup Draco’s cheek. Instantly, those gorgeous eyes fluttered closed and Draco leaned into his palm. God, that surrender… It was so much like old times and Harry really just wanted to kiss the life out of him but he didn’t want to scare Draco away.
“Sure,” he said with a smile that probably looked as false as it felt. “Sleep well.”
The woman – Elena – laughed and disappeared into the kitchen. She reappeared shortly with two glasses of water and a small plate of biscuits, which she set on the rickety coffee table by their knees.
“Ah, ah, ah,” Lucius said softly. “I think it’s better if you don’t talk. Harry probably won’t want to hear what you have to say, once he knows you’ve betrayed him.”
Harry quickly dropped Malfoy’s hands and stepped back, spreading his arms out wide and giving the other man a self-deprecating half-bow.
He was looking at Draco: at the man who had been so comfortable talking with Luna a few moments before, loose-limbed and bright-eyed. Now he was standing as stiff as a rod, his hands clasped in front of him and his eyes fixed on the floor by his feet. It was such a flashback to the Draco of several weeks ago that Harry had a terrible moment of déjà vu.
The element of surprise was not enough, though. Lucius waved his own wand and Harry felt himself flying back. He crashed into the crowd of Imperiused wizards, taking a few down with him, but didn’t hit his head or go unconscious this time.
Suddenly, claws were raking through his head. Draco, gasping in shock and pain, instinctively tried to erect his occlumency shields – the ones he had honed throughout that long year when Voldemort had lived at the Manor. He was out of practice, he knew that, but Lucius’s spell tossed the shields aside as if they were children’s blocks before a battering ram. He was raking through everything: Draco’s horror and fear during sixth year; his sickening remorse for the part he had played in the war; his disbelief and wariness at his and Harry’s wedding. Their fragile, blossoming friendship. The way his own feelings toward Harry had deepened, even though he had thought there was no chance. His happiness, their love. And then that last, terrible night – Harry flying through the air –
“Where did he take him?” he asked the group at large. Ron spoke up first.
He trailed to a stop as the fireplace behind Hermione and Ron suddenly roared to life. They both stepped back quickly, and a moment later the face of Kingsley Shacklebolt himself had pushed through the embers, now glowing green.
“See you later, then,” he said, standing up and clapping Ron on the shoulder. “Rain check on the dinner?”
Malfoy’s face flushed and he looked down, gripping the counter behind him until his knuckles turned white.
,” he snarled. “I thought that we were partners, I thought that you wouldn’t keep something like this from me.” He took another step forward and realized that he had drawn his wand. Draco was looking at it with pure terror on his face.
“Bye, Potter,” he said, moving back until he was sitting fully on the cot.
“That’s not usual,” he said seriously. “I mean, you’re pretty oblivious sometimes,” he amended, as if it were obvious. “But you don’t make a mess of your life.”
“You do know that you’re under arrest, right?” Ron said. Malfoy looked at him.
“Did you watch them?” His voice was cold but his eyes were narrow and desperate.
“So good to meet you, so good of Harry Potter,” she purred, and Draco, swallowing down equal measures of bitterness, rage, and fear that his face would betray him and he would be back in Azkaban before the day was done, nodded and smiled and nodded again.
Draco’s face went even paler than usual, and his eyes widened as he went from looking furious to terrified in a single breath.
Harry took one step forward, then another.
It was impossible, and yet...it seemed to be happening.
“Oh,” he said. “Is this – was that your choice?” He flushed and looked down. “Sorry if that’s a personal question, I just –”
Finally, they were ready. Malfoy embraced Elena and she hugged him back tightly murmuring in his ear. Then she bent and swept Viola into her arms.
“He’s a git, isn’t he, but he’s our git,” said Ron sheepishly when Harry looked at him in amazement, and the others laughed, gathering around Harry’s bed. The St. Mungo’s nurses glanced over at them disapprovingly, but didn’t say anything. He was Harry Potter, after all.
“Because you have been selected as one party in this union, Mr. Malfoy. Your behavior here over the past few years, coupled with the fact that you were, in fact, quite young when you fought for Voldemort, means that the wizarding world could very easily see you as a redeemable figure, which would not be the case for many of your former comrades.” He cleared his throat again. “That, along with the fact that you are already acquainted with the other party, sets you up quite nicely.”
“Watch it, Malfoy,” Harry growled, pulling out his wand and pushing down the uncomfortable feeling in his gut that Malfoy’s words had provoked. “I might be on your side when it comes to Viola, but you’re still a fucking criminal and I’m an Auror, so –”
“Oh,” Harry nodded and kept talking as he walked down the hall. “I don’t know the name, but I’m sure he’s good.” Draco made an affirmative noise from the kitchen. Harry reemerged, his work robes changed for casual Muggle clothes, to find Draco bent over a scroll, his quill scratching across the parchment like he was thinking about stabbing someone with it.
“Hello, Potter,” he said with a broad smile. “I wondered when you’d make your move. My servants have been abuzz with news of you.” He gestured at the dementors, shifting ominously around him. “Very kind of you to finally show up.”
“That’s how restorative justice works,” Hermione had insisted to Kingsley. “It’s based on trust. And a sponsor to check in with him on a regular basis for the first year, to make sure everything’s going well.”
Draco looked around and quickly spotted a chestnut head sticking over a stall door, seemingly drawn by all the commotion. He nodded toward the head with a grin.
“That’s good to hear, Mr. Malfoy.” He clapped his hands together and looked back at Harry with a smile. “Now that’s out of the way, we can focus on how to get out of this mess.”
Draco’s terrified face, his shaking voice, the way he had flinched back from Harry’s anger -
"Of course, whatever you feel is best. Although, I must tell you that if Mr. Malfoy interferes with the investigation we are conducting, I am afraid that will likely result in criminal charges for obstruction of justice. I'm sure Mr. Malfoy is already well aware of that, though, isn't he?" Malfoy merely blinked, regarding him impassively, but Harry had already gathered his briefcase and was halfway out the door. "Oh, and it's Auror Potter, Mrs. Magnolis. I'll send someone in shortly to take your statement."
"While we're at it,
could be heard from inside.
"Ah, yes. My apologies for what I'm sure seems excessive. You've proven to be quite dangerous under the right circumstances, though, and, at the very least, we can't have you running off or trying to hurt yourself again, now can we?" Again? If Prew was referring to the thick cast currently encasing his left hand, Draco was going to start hexing everyone he could reach—wand or no wand. Did they really think that he'd hurt himself on purpose? Or to get some kind of special treatment?
“I will
"I think we should go." Harry watched, waiting for that statement to have some sort of impact, but Draco just nodded.
"When is it?" Draco's voice snapped him back. His breath was warm again Harry's jaw and it smelled like freshly roasted coffee beans. Morning Draco was one of his favorite versions of his boyfriend, and he was missing it because of this stupid letter.
. They’d spent at least a hundred nights like this, after Harry had had a particularly hard day or if Draco had been particularly needy, and Draco had long ago memorized his anatomy. He knew every muscle, including which ones Harry overworked, and he knew exactly how to relax them. The blond worked slowly, leisurely, drawing it out as if they had all the time in the world. In that moment, they did.
"Yeah, we'll see. Is it okay if I think about it and let you know tonight? I don't want to waste any more of our morning on this." Draco sighed and, for a second Harry thought he might argue. But he just nodded and stepped back.
"Mr. Malfoy," The voice—hard, and male, and much too loud in such a small space—forced him to look up. "So glad you're with us once again. Gave us all a bit of a scare there, for a while. My name is Pierre Sinnett and I'm here as a representative of our Ministry's legal team to stand in the place of your guardian during questioning." The man looked like a shrub that someone had tried to trim in all the wrong places. Draco merely stared at him. His face was flat, his limbs were disproportionate, and his clothes did not make him look like he lived on a lawyer's salary.
He felt Draco tense minutely beside him and hoped that Hermione had also gotten his signal. He couldn’t do anything else – they would just have to hope.
Harry sighed as well. “Yeah, ok.” He shook his head mutinously. “This isn’t going to become a regular thing – but we’ll host a party. And invite reporters.” He reached down and clasped Draco’s hand. It was cool and dry in his own. He smiled grimly. “And we’ll show them just how happy we can be.”
Or Kingsley. Or the warden of Azkaban. He wasn’t sure who, but somebody needed to be hit.
“No,” Draco said firmly. “You’re not getting rid of me that easily. We’re getting out of here together or not at all.”
“Yes,” he agreed when he could talk again. “They really do.”
“The only thing I regret,” he said finally, “is how long it took us to have this conversation.”
But Azkaban had apparently pushed his father over the edge. All the contradictions were gone, replaced with a single goal, a single purpose: to finish the job Voldemort had begun and take over the entire world. Lucius would succeed where his master had failed. Like his master, he would start with England. Unlike his master, though, he would not move forward until Harry Potter was finally dead.
Harry felt himself deflate. She was so young. It was so difficult.
“See?” Ron cut in, furious, but Hermione shushed him. Harry kept his eyes fixed on Draco.
It was no choice at all. Draco nodded.
“She wanted to say hello,” Draco replied carefully. “You don’t like that, do you?”
Of course, Draco reminded himself, it was mainly to do with the idea that someone could be happy to see him – could want to touch him, or want to be near him – and not anything to do with Harry himself doing those things. Aside from how inappropriate that would be, Draco knew for a fact that it was all for show. He had learned at their wedding dinner that Harry was quite a good actor when he needed to be.
“Not your fault, either,” Harry said with a small chuckle. “At least, nothing you’re doing now. Ron’s just—”
“Yeah,” Harry said quickly. “New robes, new books, everything.” He took another bite of soup. “Well, I could certainly use a trip to Diagon Alley – mind if I tag along?”
Malfoy stepped forward tentatively until he could grab the sandwich from Harry’s hand. He inspected it carefully, turning it over in his hands before unwrapping it, then peering between the slices of bread.
“I haven’t talked to anyone besides Harry in weeks,” he said quietly. “And before that, I think he was with me any time I spoke with someone else.” He seemed to be thinking hard. “Of course, if anyone were to ask me about the marriage, I would confirm our mutual happiness.” He folded his hands carefully in his lap. “My interactions with Hogwarts professors have been short and focused entirely on my studies.”
He glanced around, but no one was even looking at him. Kingsley Shacklebolt was deep in conversation with several reporters. Draco caught the words “election” and “triumph.”
Bracing himself, Harry opened his eyes again and groaned. “Careful, Harry,” a familiar voice said gently from beside his head. “I’ve stabilized you, but I need you to be conscious for the next spell. Don’t you dare faint on me again.”
“No, sir, thank you,” Harry said quickly. “It’s just –” He glanced at the calendar on his desk: May 2. “That’s almost two months away. Are they offering parole?”
Harry snorted and bumped Torey’s/Hermione’s arm. “Ready?” he asked. Torey/Hermione nodded.
“Of course he is, this is his house,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. Harry grinned at him – he couldn’t help it. He had missed Draco so much.
The next day, Harry found himself heading down to the holding cells at 1 p.m. sharp. He had half an hour before his next meeting, and had packed himself two ham sandwiches by accident, distracted as he was by the intricacies of the potions smuggling case. It made perfect sense to see if Malfoy wanted one, Harry told himself. Sharing food with a prisoner was certainly not usual, but it wasn’t against any explicit regulations. Besides, Harry reasoned, he wouldn’t stay long. Just long enough to see if Malfoy wanted the sandwich, and to assure himself that the other man was being taken care of appropriately.
,” he whispered, pointing his wand at Lucius’s hand. There was a bang, a flash, and a puff of smoke. Torey/Hermione jumped and looked around wildly, but Lucius chuckled: a warm, low sound.
It also seemed to indicate that their semi-private life would not last much longer. Harry had started dropping hints that suggested Kingsley’s last few missives had included invitations to social events, or encouragements to host their own gatherings. Logically, Draco saw the importance of being seen in public together, especially at high-society gatherings, in front of photographers. That was the whole point of the marriage, after all: for him to be seen as a reformed Death Eater, atoning for the sins of his family, back in the regular world. Building bridges and all that.
He walked out from behind his desk, and Draco tried very hard to sit tall and straight and still. “This will be a bit different from my last position –” his glittering eyes flicked to Draco, then away again, “—but I hope that I can share with you a small fraction of the skills I have gained in my many assignments as a Ministry Auror.”
With a cry, Draco urged Lady back into a gallop. Riley was hobbling across the grass more quickly than before, also heading to where Potter lay. “Get a healer,” Draco yelled as he threw himself off Lady and knelt at Potter’s side. Frantically, he felt for a pulse. Potter’s eyes were closed, but—
It was a photograph from their wedding that Harry had not yet seen: Harry himself was grinning out at the audience, his hand clasped in Draco’s. It was clearly taken just after their rings had appeared, as they were starting to make their way out of the Grove. But Draco’s expression was strange. He was watching Harry warily, a smile on his face that looked half genuine, half questioning. His other hand was raised, waving toward the crowd, but as the photograph looped, he glanced again and again at Harry’s face. Harry himself never looked back at all.
They drove the pickup truck down winding country lanes, and Harry was reluctantly impressed by Malfoy’s easy handling of the car. His long legs shifted as he tapped the clutch or break, and he kept a pale hand resting on the manual gear shift, occasionally changing gears with a fluid grace. Harry caught himself staring and looked away quickly. Malfoy didn’t look at or speak to him the entire time.
They were going to throw another party: a Christmas party that would celebrate the season, Harry’s new job, and Draco’s successful completion of a semester. It had been Kingsley’s idea, of course, but it didn’t seem as terrible an idea as the first one had. Draco didn’t feel his stomach shrivel up at the idea of being on display for both Harry
For a long moment, nothing seemed to happen. Then Lucius whirled back to the crowd of wizards, his eyes going wide and panicked as he raised his wand, and the hands of the Imperiused wizards holding Harry down suddenly loosened.
“How are you feeling?”
“Look,” he said quietly, looking at Hermione but speaking to them both. “I know you don’t understand why I’m doing this. Honestly, I don’t either.” He spread his hands helplessly. “But can you understand that it’s something I have to do? Like fighting Voldemort, or helping your mom clean up after dinner, Ron. It will help people. And I…I want to help people.”
Now, Harry stopped outside Malfoy’s cell to again see Malfoy curled on the cot, facing the wall. This time, when Malfoy didn’t react right away, Harry cleared his throat.
“Shit, Potter, that was out of line, I’m sorry—”
” Harry said again. He buried his face in his hands. “I guess –”
The pale skin of his forearm was marred by a dark snake bursting from a skull’s mouth.
Kingsley laughed, a loud, booming sound of delight. “I thought you might,” he said, grinning now as he withdrew a rolled piece of parchment from the folds of his cloak. He passed it to Draco, who unrolled it slowly, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.
There was a long moment of silence. Then Draco sat up quickly.
. He wasn’t quite sure how he felt about that. But first, he had to get on a broomstick for the first time since the Battle of Hogwarts.
Harry laughed. “Lead on, mate.” He slung his bag over his shoulder and followed Ron out the door.
“I…I know I am not an equal member of this union. I accept that, and I am sorry I forgot how to act like it.” He took another deep breath. “I will accept any punishment you deem appropriate. If you do not send me back, I will do better. I swear, Harry –” His voice rose and he cut himself short. Curled his hands together in his lap. Waited.
“To a convicted Death Eater? You’re hilarious, Potter,” Robards said, already turning to go back into his office. The door shut with a final
“No, you’re not,” Harry said, annoyance rising. “And I’m going to prove it to you. We’re getting out of here. Together.”
“I must be dead,” Draco said. He wouldn’t look Harry in the eye. “Maybe this is my brain firing a few last synapses before it all goes dark. Well, it’s a very nice last thing to have. Nicer than I deserve, I think.”
“Did a lot of cleaning, did you Potter?” Malfoy asked drily, but his eyebrow quirked in what seemed like genuine interest. So Harry told him: about the chores he had to do before he could eat dinner; about vacuuming Dudley’s room and having to move all Dudley’s toys, which he was never allowed to play with, to be able to get into the corners; about the cupboard under the stairs. Draco listened soberly, nodding once or twice when something resonated. When Harry finished, he took a deep breath, seemingly gearing up to say something profound.
The stench that hit him on the other side was so strong that he had to work not to gag aloud. Unwashed bodies, piss, and vomit lay over another stench: the smell of fear.
“Ah, Harry. Good, Mr. Malfoy was correct. I’m afraid I need to ask you to come home. I am here in your flat, and need to speak with both you and Mr. Malfoy immediately.” He seemed to notice Ron and Hermione for the first time. “My apologies, you two. I’ll try not to keep him too long.” The smile was so undoubtedly Kingsley’s, even through the embers, that Harry felt himself relaxing. Everything would be alright. Kingsley would know what to do.
Malfoy was curled up on the cot, his face to the wall. Harry hesitated, feeling a strange unwillingness to wake him up, but a moment later Malfoy stirred.
“That’s actually also kind of what I wanted to talk about too,” he said, turning and grabbing a handful of banana pieces. “We’re in a strange situation, technically, but it doesn’t have to be hard. For all intents and purposes, we can just be roommates who sometimes go to Ministry functions and pretend to be a happily-married couple.”
Harry followed Ron’s gaze to where a small girl – she looked to be about five years old – was peeking out of the kitchen, not wearing any shoes. Her eyes – pale gray, just like Malfoy’s – were wide and curious.
“‘Purity will always conquer,’” she whispered fiercely. “The Malfoy family motto. I had a hunch.”
He walked until he didn’t recognize where he was anymore, until he was so far outside Hogsmeade that he couldn’t even see lights in the distance. It was starting to get dark, one of those early, rainy evenings that seep into your bones. He kept thinking that he should go check on Draco – should go find Draco – but every time he thought of the other man, the student’s soft voice rang in his ears.
“Yes, sir,” he said quietly, and walked out of the classroom without a backward glance.
Draco felt the last threads of tension drain away as they entered the stall: the squat building next to the office smelled of manure, leather, and horses, and nearly-forgotten sounds of whickering and equine chewing filled the air. Draco went right to a stall holding a sweet-faced gray mare: the name “Lady” was written above the door in cursive script. He wondered if she remembered him; she certainly sidled right up to the stall door and pushed her nose into his hand readily enough.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Malfoy,” the Minister said crisply. “Warden tells me you have been a model prisoner.”
“Where is Malfoy, anyway? Shouldn’t he have been by my side, as my worried husba—”
“She’s my whole world,” the man wept. “I miss her so much. I have to get her back.”
Draco did his best not to laugh in her face, but it was difficult. Who would ever hire him, with or without a diploma? But McGonagall was still talking.
He was thinking that, in fact, when Kingsley entered. The tall man poked his head around the doorframe hesitantly, as if unsure of his welcome, but Draco gestured him in.
“If you promised to watch the memories before sending her back to Miles, does that mean she has to stay with one of us tonight?” Ron asked, slightly dubious, a few minutes after Malfoy left. Harry bit his lip. He hadn’t thought this through.
The door farthest from the entrance hall, however, was different. Low voices peaked Harry’s interest, different as they were from the loud, laughing conversations elsewhere in the house. He strained to hear, not wanting to risk an eavesdropping spell.
Malfoy pursed his lips, nodded once. “He —”
“I’ll be lucky to have them,” Neville said, smiling back. He seemed to be glowing, even though it was nearly pitch dark now. “Teaching is – well, it’s the best, Harry, but you already know that, don’t you?”
“I’ll be there,” he said, and Harry was taken aback by the gratitude in his voice. “Thank you.”
With a start, Draco realized that the low hum of students on the other side of the Great Hall doors was getting louder. Breakfast must have finished. He suddenly very much did not want to be framed in the doorway when it opened for the entire student body to see.
Draco took a deep breath. Immediately, images flooded his brain: Harry advancing on him, face twisted with anger and betrayal; his own frantic grasp for something, anything, to protect himself; the surge of magic bursting out of him, so strong –
“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. Turned back to their table and drained his firewhiskey. Put several Sickles down on the stained wood. “Have a round on me.”
“Let’s go find us a Death Eater,” he said quietly, and Harry clenched his fists and nodded again.
Harry could feel rage burning in his chest, but he breathed deeply.
“No promises,” said Harry, winking. Draco shoved his shoulder, then kissed him again.
Harry felt something inside him loosen – he smiled back, full and genuine. “Nope – and I’m starved. Where to?”
“You’re quite right, Harry. I apologize, I overstepped.” He nodded towards Draco. “Of course, Mr. Malfoy, Harry is correct. But it’s very possible that you spoke with someone unknowingly who would see this as an opportunity for some quick money. Have you spoken with anyone about your relationship with Harry recently?”
What a supremely odd thing.
The wry comment died on his lips as they entered the living room to find Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy sitting on the couch together. Well, “together” was a bit of a misnomer. They were sitting on the same couch, but Malfoy was pressed so tightly against the far armrest he seemed to be trying to become one with the furniture. Ron was staring daggers at the other man and turning his wand over and over in his hands in a distinctly threatening manner. Malfoy’s eyes were fixed on the floor in front of him, his shoulders hunched and tense, and his hands were clenched together so tightly that the knuckles shone white. It was such a far cry from the joyous, relaxed Malfoy of their horseback ride that Harry felt something twist in his gut.
Then his eyes fell on Lucius and he leapt up, drawing his wand.
It looked just as he remembered: the sea stretched out before them, gray and smooth beneath the clouds. The stable sat a few meters away, and the smell of horses mingled with the salt in the air. There were a few horses grazing in a fenced-in paddock behind the stable, and a small structure that Draco remembered as the proprietor’s office sat near the road. With a grin, he set off toward the office and Potter, impossibly, followed him.
Draco snorted quietly into his wine and Harry flashed him a grin. He opened his mouth to say something else, but another voice cut in.
Draco Malfoy was walking towards him down the aisle. The other man was dressed in dark green robes that made his blond hair gleam like sunlight on dark water. His head was up, gaze fixed on a point just over Harry’s head, and his thin lips were set in a straight, tense line. He was walking slowly, with the easy grace Harry remembered of him from their last few years at Hogwarts, and Harry suddenly caught sight of Ginny Weasley’s face, her eyes fixed on Malfoy in a look of pure hatred. Harry hoped that Luna, sitting beside her, was holding Ginny’s hand. It had taken Luna years to help her beloved overcome the trauma of being possessed by Voldemort at the hand of Lucius Malfoy. He knew this couldn’t be easy for either of them.
“Yeah. Good. That is – I’m glad –” Harry grimaced. “I’m rubbish at this, aren’t I?”
The two women came to a stop before each other and clasped hands. Everyone sat down as Pansy and Mrs. Weasley stood up behind Ginny – and there was a friendship Draco had not seen coming, but it had blossomed, sure and quick and deep – and Xenophilius and Neville stood behind Luna, both looking handsomely disheveled and incredibly happy.
“I’m sorry,” he said quietly, his hands folded together on the table.
“I don’t know…” Harry read the letter over again. Written in the Minister’s precise cursive, it was maddeningly brief.
Draco wished that he could close his eyes against the disappointed disgust in his father’s gaze, but he could not. All he could do was watch as Lucius summoned the slender wizard again, who Levitated Draco – still immobilized – back out into the hall. Through another hall, down a winding set of stairs, coming at last to a metal door set into the stone, which the wizard opened, then flung Draco inside. The spell holding him still broke as he crashed to the stone floor, and he curled into a ball, squeezing his eyes shut as, behind him, the heavy door closed with a final, resounding
The woman nodded vigorous understanding. “Pues, entrad! Bienvenidos,” she continued, stepping back and ushering them into the farmhouse. With a bemused look at Ron, Harry followed her, with Ron close behind him.
Several reporters were circulating among the guests, quills floating along beside them scribbling notes on pieces of parchment. Draco suddenly realized that he recognized one of them: the round man in sleek green robes who had come up to them in Diagon Alley the evening they had gone to get Draco’s school books. Harold…something?
His own thoughts of a few moments before were like a mockery. Of course he hadn’t stumbled into his own past, when he had been a beloved son and a celebrated student.
“Not for that,” Draco interrupted, then looked down. “I mean, yes for that. But also—I think—I might be making things difficult between you and Weasley?” His voice lilted up at the end, making it a question. Although of course it wasn’t.
“Well, Draco? What do you think?”
“Wait—really? Ride horses?” Harry asked, unable to keep quiet any longer. “I didn’t know you liked riding horses.”
“Of course,” Malfoy answered instantly. “I didn’t mean to pester you. I am at your disposal.”
They were also alone for the first time that day.
Lucius Malfoy was sitting behind a shining wooden desk, watching Draco with a smile. His gray eyes were gleaming. As Draco stared, he rose from his seat and came around the desk, opening his arms.
“Yes,” the first voice agreed, sounding hesitant. “You know his lordship has his own plans, though. They may not make sense to us, but they must be in our best interest.”
“Um…thank you,” Draco said, dropping his eyes. When he didn’t say anything else, Harry drank a sip of water and put down his glass.
“Harry.” Draco’s quiet voice cut through Harry’s fury and he quickly looked back down. Draco swallowed hard. Harry could see his Adam’s apple bob up and down. “The Minister of Magic has a point. Reporters always need a new story. If we give them a story on our own terms, we’ll be able to control what they print.” He swallowed again and looked back down quickly. “Of course, I’ll do whatever you think is best.”
“Having a hard time seeing past the bloke who mercilessly taunted his family for years, repeatedly attacked his best friend, and started a war?” Draco’s mouth quirked in something that was not a smile. “I get that, I really do.” His voice grew earnest. “And he can hate me all he wants, but I really don’t want this…um…marriage to mess up any of your—"
Harry caught up to Draco outside the Ministry. The blond man seemed dazed, and he startled slightly when Harry came up to him. Without thinking too much about it, Harry wrapped him in a hug.
She leaned forward and patted his arm comfortingly. “You can keep getting better,” she said firmly. “And try not to worry too much. I’m sure we’ll get this sorted in no time."
Malfoy stepped carefully out from behind the table. His eyes were fixed on Harry’s face, and bright spots of color had appeared high up on his cheeks. He was breathing so heavily, Harry could see his chest rising and falling.
Harry sighed. “I didn’t like her, much, in school,” he said. “But I like that she makes you happy, when she shows up.” He took a bite of curry and ignored Draco’s snort. “She did try to turn me over to Voldemort before the Battle, but water under the bridge and all that.”
“Do you like pancakes?”
Harry felt his face flush. Malfoy snapped his head back toward Harry, suddenly smiling flirtatiously. “Why, Potter, you want a turn with me?”
“Maybe you have to be holding something?” Hermione offered, at the same time Luna said:
“It’s not an intern,” Harry said, reading the memo and feeling something like excitement blossom in his gut. “Ron – Ron!” He quickly passed the other man the piece of paper, his hands actually shaking.
“It was fine,” Draco said quickly – too quickly? Harry made a mental note to ask him again later, when Harry himself wasn’t in such an odd headspace. “Some new professors. I don’t want to keep you from dinner,” he added. “I can tell you more later, if you’re interested.”
Which Potter had then asked about.
“Warden told me,” Draco said slowly, searching Harry’s face. “Before I left, she told me that she would be watching me. Kingsley too.” He squeezed his eyes shut. “They told me that I had to make you happy or else you would send me back to Azkaban. They’ve been keeping tabs on me, I know they have, the two of them and Shaver, and you’ve been corresponding with them.” His eyes flew open again, panicked. “Was I not supposed to know? I won’t say anything about it again, of course it’s your choice.” He shook his head sharply. “I know I haven’t made you happy, I know I can’t make you happy, but please, Harry, I’ll do anything you want if you –”
, he thought, following Malfoy back down the hall.
Draco nodded, but Riley was already making his way back behind his desk. Draco could almost feel Potter’s eyes burning into his back, and concentrated on not turning around. He did not want to see what Potter thought about an old man complimenting Narcissa Malfoy without so much as looking at the great Harry Potter.
“We are so glad you could join us,” Harry replied smoothly. “Always a pleasure to share our own happiness with our friends.”
Harry bit back his own retort and watched Draco take in Kingsley’s words.
“And how do we know he’s a former Death Eater, anyway?” Ron cut in. “How do we know he’s not agreeing to marry you so he can escape Azkaban and kill you and bring the Death Eaters back?”
Draco Malfoy re-entered Hogwarts with his arms full of lilies-of-the-valley and leafy oak boughs. Beside him, Hagrid was grinning. Draco felt the old defensiveness flare, then dissipate. Tentatively, he smiled back.
Harry didn’t remember carriages being so damned
“This soup is a big help,” Harry responded gratefully. “How was your day?”
Draco couldn’t quite believe what was happening.
“Wonderful!” Shaver said when the last sixth-year Ravenclaw had given her name – Eileen Caraway – and what she was excited to learn: occlumency. “We will begin with some review.”
“I can just imagine their faces,” he gasped, wiping his eyes. “Oh, Potter. Always such a do-gooder. ‘Brazil, here I come.’ Oh!” And he was off again, holding his stomach and chortling in glee.
“A funeral.” Harry’s stomach dropped. They’d gone to so many funerals after the war, and even more so after the trials… Who was even left to bury?
not what they'd wanted to have happen.
With that, he excused himself into the nearby kitchen where he found the Auror base that had been set up. Crosby was sitting at the small table meant for preparing ingredients and, since it was sized for a house elf, looked quite ridiculous. Even that wasn't enough to lift Harry's mood, though.
“No, I’m not. I had my fair share of hookups before we got together and I knew no one would ever compare after we broke up. Because I trust you, Drake, and I can let go with you. I’ve never been able to do that with anyone else.” Tears hit his back, but he didn’t comment on them. It was enough to know that Draco was crying and trying silently to control his voice before responding.
“Of course. Turns out we’re not so different after all, huh Malfoy?” Draco stiffened at the last name—that was his father’s name, not his because he wasn’t his father and—
“Mr. Malfoy, what do you mean?” Now or never, right? He could feel Harry moving closer, acting like he was going to stop him or intervene somehow, so Draco just blurted the first thing that came to his mind.
“Because we broke up for a reason, Harry, because it hurts and because I miss you and because you talk about me like I’m the love of your life when we haven’t spoken in months. You can’t fucking—” Harry twisted and caught Draco’s wrists before he could start beating Harry’s chest. He held, even as Draco struggled, but then the blond collapsed onto his chest and smeared tears across his skin as if they might soak in and heal their hearts. Draco was shaking terribly again, but Harry just hugged him.
“Please, call me Minnie boys. There’s no wizard equivalent of CPS—I’m sure you know what that is, Harry—but due to present circumstances Hogwarts will be taking temporary custody of you, and I volunteered. I hope that’s alright with you?” Harry nodded, speaking for both of them, and Draco took that as his signal that Harry was okay enough to take back control of the situation. He buried his face in Harry’s chest and let his lion do the talking.
"Mr. Malfoy," The mouth breather finally began, stepping into view. "My name is Mr. Prew, and this is my associate Miss Le'Galle. It's a pleasure to meet you." Draco narrowed his eyes a bit, sizing up every detail he could find from the cat hair on the man's suit to his peculiarly small feet.
"Yeah, I think you are," His entire body just collapsed. "You're weirdly good at Quidditch, at least, and you somehow made it through school despite never paying attention or doing any of the work. You managed to be the only person in history who is a murderer, and
"Yes," he mumbled, forcing the syllable through gritted teeth. There was no need to go into the war, or eighth year, or even anything about Hogwarts. Petunia didn't care, and he would only hurt himself by trying—and he knew that, really, he did—but that didn't stop the urge. She would only throw it back in his face if she knew, though.
"Aunt Petunia, this is Draco Malfoy." Immediately, his aunt turned up her nose at what must have sounded like a Wizarding name—which it was. Draco's shoulders tensed, but he said nothing.
"What's he like? Obviously, we know him but there's a side to him that only you see. What's he like with just you?" It took Draco a solid thirty seconds to understand that she meant Harry. Hermione was asking him about Harry. Not his father, not the abuse, not their disappearance or the battle in the Great Hall—Harry. He could talk about his lion, right?
"You want tea? Or some food, maybe?" Harry smiled a bit, even if he kept it hidden, because feeding him was Draco's way of being a mother hen. He shook his head, though, and found one pale hand with his own.
And Draco knew his. As the tears slowed, Harry felt two hands skim up his chest and settle on either side of his neck. Draco dug his fingers in, palming and massaging the muscles that Harry always tensed whenever he was anxious. Immediately, Harry relaxed. He let his hands roam mindlessly, reacquainting himself with the body of the man he’d loved for so many years. This wasn’t sexual—and it didn’t need to be—but he still found himself tracing scars as if they might have changed and counting moles the way most people counted sheep.
“No, he condoned and initiated it but it’s his cousin who does it.” Even if Draco was normally the submissive one in their relationship, he found himself tangling his hand in Harry’s hair and soothing him the way his lion always did when he had panic attacks. It helped, thankfully, even though Harry wasn’t panicking. McGonagall watched them with her lips pressed into a very thin, very angry line.
"Actually…" No. There was no possible way, right? Was he actually spreading lies like that to the rest of the school, to the
“Why?” he finally managed to ask, shaking slightly in disbelief. But Harry just smiled at him.
“You want me to go with you?” Draco took a deep breath. By now, Harry recognized the gesture for what it was—the blond, trying to stop an anxiety attack before it happened—but he didn’t let himself reach out. Even if his whole body ached to comfort the man in front of him, he knew Draco wouldn’t allow it.
Instinctively, Harry turned away just as Draco pulled off his undershirt. The blond laughed. God, Harry had missed that sound so much… It was light, and happy, and one of the purest things he’d ever heard. For years, he’d
"Am I a freak?" For the first time in his life, no one jumped to reassure him and correct him at that question. Draco lay quietly for a moment, then kissed his forehead, and then continued to stroke his hair. Harry thought he hadn't heard, at first, but then he took a deep breath.
“It’s okay, really. You know I would tell you if I was uncomfortable with it.” He did know that, but he still just nodded. “Besides, I think I can control myself around you for one night.” Harry recoiled, searching for any kind of bitterness in Draco’s face, but the blond was smirking. They were… teasing each other.
But Petra fucking Magnolis had just had to have someone she considered 'competent' work on the case. She was a grieving mother, which Harry constantly had to remind himself, and she was entitled to her concerns but she didn't have to go on about how stupid they all were and how the entire Ministry was colluding to sweep her son's death under the rug. She definitely didn't have to scream it at them while they were just trying to conduct an investigation.
"Try again, Mr. Malfoy." Prew, in all his mouth breathing glory, looked as tired and bored of this as Draco felt. Four over three hours, now, they'd sat here questioning him. His supposed 'guardian' hadn't said a word in his defense or stopped any of the questions, which only showed that he'd been handpicked for the job by the wrong side, and Draco had grudgingly acted as his own defense.
"Good, I'd be disappointed if you did. Besides, baby," Again that 'baby' that said Draco's light, playful tone did not mean that he wasn't taking it seriously. "You've known me for over a decade. Have you ever once seen me with someone 'normal'?" He shook his head, burying his face back into Draco's chest in lieu of answering out loud. Of course it helped—Draco always helped. He wasn't cured, and he was by no means steady or secure in himself, but he was better.
AN I don't own HP or any of the characters! Thank you so much to everyone who's commented/reviewed!!! Please no flames!
“Luna,” Draco tried again. He stopped when he realized he still had no idea what to say to her. It’d been months since he’d talked to another Hogwarts student without Harry there to guide the conversation and all he could think was Looney Lovegood. That wasn’t nice or helpful, though, so he tried for something more neutral. Lovegood was here. Yes, that was a true thing that had no negative adjectives attached to it. Lovegood was here. Why?
He'd started drinking at eight years old. Even now, Harry still choked whenever he thought about that fact and he had to focus extra hard on swallowing the clump of noodles in his mouth. Eight years old… With enough funerals and enough rough nights, Harry had gathered up little snippets of stories and little pieces of memories like some kind of historian until he felt he could piece the whole picture together.
"Pretty please?" He turned, snuggling his face into Draco's T-shirt as if he were about to cry. Maybe it wasn't completely true, but Harry couldn't deny that he felt unsettled and, besides, he was not going to pass up an opportunity for cuddles.
to yell and play the victim in front of large crowds. I happen to care very deeply about your nephew, and we are here as a
The priest said a few words that Harry didn’t listen to. He knew that the Malfoys weren’t religious—that most of the Wizarding World wasn’t religious, actually—and that the priest was probably included or just conveniently around at the right time. His attention, instead, went to Draco.
"Of course, Granger. You'd be lost without me, I suspect."
"Harry, so glad you found time in your busy schedule to come show your support. And you brought a guest, I see." Harry stiffened, half waiting for the pinch of Uncle Vernon's grip on his arm or to be hauled off to his cupboard. Neither came, though, and he felt a subtle, direct warming charm hit his side. Draco's way of comforting him without touching him.
“No, I like Aurors better when their feet aren’t on the floor.” The guard’s brow furrowed, but he evidently decided not to ask and merely pulled the door closed behind her.
“No, don’t stop.” It didn’t hit him how uncharacteristic that was of him to say until he saw Harry’s surprised expression but he didn’t let himself shrink in on himself. Not this time. Not when Harry had been so supportive and protective and comforting. Harry relaxed a little at the squeeze and a hint of his smile returned. Good, Draco couldn’t help thinking. He liked the smile.
“Ah, Ms. Le’Galle thank you for joining us. Let’s move on to the main topic of concern, shall we?”
“Draco, I cannot stress enough how it important it is that we be completely clear on what you’re saying. You’re telling me that Vernon Dursley has sexually assaulted Harry?” His lion stiffened, but Draco was more than prepared to take the questioning as he was sure Harry had done for him because they leaned on each other. It was what they did.
Draco stiffened under the gaze of the Minister, but Minnie held his right hand and he tried to breathe.
used… he's dead. I thought that might make you feel better, in a weird sort of way." And it did, honestly. He could breathe a little easier knowing that his father hadn't been saved by some miracle potion and that Harry didn't have a giant target on his back.
” Harry was taken aback. Just for a second, Draco could swear he saw pain in those emerald eyes as if Draco was betraying him somehow by threatening to tell.
“I think it’s time you considered your circumstances. And perhaps, it may be time to
"Are you going to testify if they ask you to?" That wasn't the question he'd meant to ask, but the words slipped out nevertheless. Hermione didn't even stiffen.
He woke up in a hospital bed, the sheets strewn around him and drenched with sweat. He thrashed, already trying to fight the fear that bubbled in his chest and trembled out into his hands from the nightmare, but a hand stopped him. It was warm, he realized, and gentle.
for that sound.
"Of course they were! I heard Bella's voice and—" Quickly, the Gryffindor lay a hand on his arm. His voice had risen in volume and he realized suddenly that she probably wasn't supposed to be with him, let alone feeding him information. He closed his mouth with a sharp
“Draco, you’re telling us that Dudley Dursley has sexually assaulted Harry?” He nodded. “And that your father, Lucius Malfoy, has sexually assaulted you?” That one took Draco longer to respond. Old fear boiled up and screamed at him to lie, to make excuses, to do anything to save the story he’d spent so many years spinning, but Harry squeezed his hand. Draco nodded.
“Right,” Harry agreed, trying to convince himself. Draco nodded and looked down. His hands rested on the table, still and neat.
He pulled out every bad choice Malfoy had ever made, every snide comment that had ever been overheard by someone, and turned them over and over until they glinted in the light and the jury couldn’t help but look at them. Hoker even brought up Dumbledore’s death at one point, and Harry saw red.
his head. It was difficult not to jerk away or fidget, but Harry had experience with this sort of thing. This was not the first time he had been treated for a head injury.
She gave him a long-suffering look. “I didn’t hear anything, Harry. I saw something. Just as I was finishing my delicious sandwich – avocado and hummus, just lovely – I saw Colin Fairchild walk by. You know – Kingsley’s assistant?”
He decided to take it as such.
“You can see why it looks bad for Kingsley, Harry,” Ron said quickly. “Especially after his big speech a few days ago, and with the election coming up…”
“Riley was a Death Eater and I had no idea,” Malfoy continued miserably. “He…he made that explosion on purpose, to scare your horse and make you fall, and he wasn’t going to call a healer, just let you die, so I stupefied him and brought you back here and I didn’t know who else to call…”
Draco huffed a laugh. “Yes, well,” he said with a hint of his old edge. “We’ve never been the best at talking, have we?”
“How was your day, love?” Harry asked as they pulled apart, very conscious of several people around them who had stopped to take this in.
Not exactly a recipe for healthy rest.
Malfoy turned to Harry. “Well Potter, let’s get on with it,” he said irritably. “Or is my punishment to stand here all night next to your labored mouth breathing?”
“Delightful.” She popped a miniature quiche in her mouth and winked at Draco. “I do so appreciate a good spread – and the tiddlywamps couldn’t be happier.”
“So,” he began casually, sitting back from a plate scraped clean of the last syrupy bite. “Who’s good this season?”
