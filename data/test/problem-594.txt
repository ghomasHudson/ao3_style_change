Eventually they all settle down, Draco still a giggly mess as Potter and Max talk more calmly. Max apologizes constantly, but there really aren’t any hard feelings. It’s a funny story, for the most part, and by the end of their conversation Max is more comfortable with the idea of glasses and how to manage them.
“You’re gonna hate it!” Draco calls to his housemates, who shoot him unimpressed glares, but he sees Granger nodding along in agreement.
“Harry is fine, remember?” Eve says lowly, squeezing his arm until it hurts, and she doesn’t let up until he’s breathing deeply and ducking his head. He felt exhausted, utterly drained, and he hated it. He needed to be strong. He needed to be better than this and go find his heroic, idiot boyfriend. He had to SEE that Harry was okay.
Until Krum pulls out a familiar, if slightly different, book from his bag to study. Draco’s eyes widen and he scrambles and snatches the book out of Krum’s hands, ignoring his startled protests, and reads the front.
The stand they find is dark in color but lit up by the sheer mass of glowing GalaxTeas. The drink consists of a cup of black tea, spiked with something a bit stronger, with what appears to be a miniature galaxy spiraling above the top. A simple but beautiful charm.
Now, she hands them both a small bowl of chocolate and vanilla soft serve and keeps the third for herself.
“I’ll head to the infirmary. Act like I’ve been there a while,” Draco decides. He can’t join in. He can’t make an appearance or be seen by Umbridge. He has to give himself an alibi and he needs to do it now.
The situation is fine for Draco. Sometimes, engrossed in the files, he even has the house elf Kreacher bring his meals up to him. The grouchy elf is especially eager to serve him, too, saying he’s honored to serve a proper member of the House of Black once more.
“Neither of us are Beaters, you do know!” Draco calls, scowling, but Harry is laughing and flying back out, swinging at the Bludger-Acting ball. Draco, sighing desperately, flies out as well.
“Are they?”
“I didn’t realize you said ‘knob’ in America.”
It makes Draco…
“Maybe they don’t want to,” Tracey begins, pausing to toss some of her meat slabs to the thestrals keeping their distance. “So, they need to be tricked into learning. That’s how my daddy taught me vegetables are good for you. He’d sneak them into my food.”
~ ~ ~
“Oh, okay, you’re just a dweeb.”
“What?!” Potter looks stricken and shocked, his green eyes widening into saucers, “Why would I want to hang out with you?!”
They turn to the Muggleborn in unison, the girl’s shoulders rising defensively at the angry looks they’re giving her. “What? I didn’t do anything! I grabbed it and when I jiggled the handle it didn’t budge,” she snaps, then motions to all the other doors that have locked on them, “Then that happened!”
“They can in the magical realm,” Harry mumbles, finally finding his voice.
Draco admits his family does not own a car, although these are one Muggle invention that the Wizarding World has a slightly better knowledge of than, say, television. Max comments that the Malfoy’s probably have a carriage, then when Draco doesn’t respond they whisper, “You do, don’t you?”
Draco has Herbology first thing when classes begin, which really isn’t all that important, followed by his first Defense Against the Dark Arts, which everyone has been waiting for.
“What? You’re not going to take me to them yourself?” Harry questions, brow lowering suspiciously. Despite everything, they still couldn’t know if they could trust Duke entirely.
“Oh, no, me sitting here wasn’t an invitation for you to--”
“The swamp or getting rid of it?” Draco questions, smiling cheekily, and Sinistra glances at him. The corner of her lips twitch upward, just for a millisecond, and then she’s looking back at the swamp monument.
He is either incredibly lucky or his timing is impeccable, because Draco has just managed to school his features when Umbridge throws the door open, face set in livid fury. “What is all that nois—Oh! Mr. Malfoy? What is going on here?” The second Umbridge sees the Slytherin her entire tune changes. Still angry, based on the way her face is puffed up in fury, but definitely not expecting to see her “favorite” student.
“We need you and your camera,” the raven-haired boy says and Draco freezes and gets a proper look at his face. His eyes are wide and
Draco stares at the girl for a moment, and from the empty air at his side he hears Longbottom mumble, “What does tha’ eben mean…?” Draco wonders, with a passing realization, if maybe this is how expert legilimens think. He’d never really understood the practice, and he didn’t understand Tracey, so maybe they coexisted?
He thinks Eve and Granger’s baffled expressions are hilarious, but he’s especially drawn to the way the color dances over Harry’s face and makes his glasses glow.
I do this with all my other stories so I'm gonna do it here too. Chapter song! Sometimes it'll play into the theme of the chapter, other times it is what I was listening to while writing, or maybe it's just something I wanted to share with y'all!
Again, as Draco predicted, Harry was first to jump at him, declaring he would go… except Draco had to turn him down, too.
“You look like my grandma,” Theodore comments as he passes by.
“In a sense. Am I not allowed, Weasley? I did not realize such affairs were left only to the dreck of society. I will have to remember that for next time.”
And what a word it was…
All of them save Draco, of course, who was safe in the hospital wing for the night.
“You hardly did, either,” Draco retorts, voice controlled despite his expression. He was ready to spring at his housemate and make her regret messing with them, but he was scrawnier than her and he didn’t want to cause a scene right outside a classroom. Not a scene where he could be blamed, anyway. Right now, if they were caught, all fingers could be pointed at Millicent.
“Yes. Adults can be frightened,” Narcissa finally says, voice calm. So, Max’s mother had been right. Draco doubted she knew everything like Narcissa did, but it was good to know that there was at least
” he holds a hand to his heart in mock hurt, “I will have you know I have great muscle definition.”
“Of course I did,” Draco says, affronted. “I put together quite the blackmail packages on Ludo Bagman for two of his main enemies, I managed to strike a few suspects off my list, I got Sirius a copy of Bertha Jorkins’s files since he’s looking into her, and I’ve begun looking into a particularly curious lead.”
Perhaps because they were warm and friendly to Draco in a way he was unfamiliar with…
“I don’t know…” Longbottom finally cuts in and Draco looks over. The tall boy doesn’t look as curiously thoughtful as he usually does, though. Instead, he’s staring at a pot he’s prepping for a new plant, but not really looking at it. “Sometimes what doesn’t kill you just…hurts.”
Edgecombe is facing away, towards the door she just shut, and visibly takes a deep breath. “Professor Umbridge…” the girl gulps, takes one more breath, then swings around and says swiftly and urgently, “I have information on a secret organization of students in the castle!”
When he asks about potions McGonagall pauses, looking thoughtful, before replying, “Our potions master has said on multiple occasions that it is like Chemistry with magic.”
When Draco wakes back up the sun is setting and the crowd of Gryffindors around Potter’s bed is dissipating. The sound of rain still murmurs outside the hospital wing, giving the room a quiet, relaxed atmosphere that wasn’t present last time he was conscious.
“This was not some flippant prank, or even some scandalous plan to make Hogwarts look bad. Someone did everything they could to ensure you were picked by the Goblet, without a shadow of a doubt. Harry Potter, I do believe someone is attempting to kill you.”
“Quirrel?” Harry repeats, flabbergasted, his eyes widening to saucers.
“Oh…”
“And finally,” Dumbledore pauses like he’s making sure everyone is listening. He need not worry, he has everyone’s rapt attention. “I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.”
He died a year later, as Sirius had said, due to “severe stress.” Apparently, he was buried nearly the same day of his death, no autopsy performed or mediwitch present to determine his true cause of death.
“No! No, that’s not it at all!” Potter quickly jumps in, eyes watching Draco as he seethes, before widening. The Gryffindor extracts one of his hands from Draco’s with some effort, then reaches up and lays it on the back of Draco’s neck, fingers brushing through buzzed strands at the base of Draco’s head. “Malfoy. Breathe.”
“This feels like a good one,” the old wizard says with the next wand, looking cheerful, and hands over the next wand. “Hawthorn, unicorn hair, 10 inches,” he says and Draco takes it. It does feel promising, but when he waves it the store’s front window blows out with a bang. Draco jumps back in alarm and even McGonagall has stood up. “Nope,” Ollivander says tightly and snatches the wand away while McGonagall begins mending the window with slow motions of her own wand. Draco glances down at the floor and sees Tootsie staring at him, looking unimpressed.
“Yeah, just… let me look into it a bit more, first. I’d hate to start any rumors or get your hopes up,” Draco looks down at Harry with a pleading look in his eyes, hoping he won’t push the issue. Thankfully Harry is not as immune to the look as the Nubbles had been and the boy sighs and nods. “Let’s head back to bed, then… We have classes tomorrow morning.”
Draco’s other brow pops up in surprise, before he’s smirking through a blush and chuckling. “This is just for my own benefit, is it?” he questions coyly, Potter’s shoulder’s stiffening and the other boy quickly turns to look at a far wall.
Draco sighs deeply and sets down his quill, homework set to the side at what is sure to be an eventful interaction. “What do you two want?”
invented spells before?” Eve sneers, Granger beside her, both of them looking at Draco judgmentally.
“I dunno,
“Just clean it up, already,” a familiar voice says and Draco is startled to find Minister Fudge facing off with a stern-looking Auror. “We don’t need this here, worrying anyone else.”
“Stop that…”
“Help me find a booth, Draco?” Max’s mother speaks lowly, “Let Max order for you.”
“Check where you usually sit or rest. Anything there?” Harry prods, forcing a little hopefulness into his tone even though his eyes look disbelieving.
Except Blaise is the one to refuse Draco, pulling back the invisibility cloak and holding up a hand. “No, you need to keep being our scout. Being invisible is great, but if someone runs right into us, especially while we’re split up and vulnerable, we’re screwed.”
“It’s Sirius, isn’t it?” Ginny abruptly speaks up, setting down her book as everyone turns to her. Harry, looking back up, looks startled. “I’ve been thinking about it for a while now, but… you haven’t been able to contact Sirius since everything went down, right?”
“So, is this a thing now?” Theodore questions, standing up straight and crossing his arms.
“Now, now, it’s all just procedure. I can’t let you continue as a guest without a name.”
“Oh, certainly, Mr. Malfoy,” the official chirps, summoning a little clipboard and using her wand to fill out a form in a matter of two seconds. She pauses and looks down at Sirius, eying the vest with raised brows. “I was not aware you had a service dog, Mr. Malfoy,” she says in wonder, but marks it down on the form with little question. She then removes the paper and hands it to Draco. “That will have the elevator go straight up to his office, dear,” and finally the official vanishes like a flash.
Draco is struck with curiosity of what the merman’s actual name might be, but decides not to ask. Maybe, if they can talk again, he’ll bring it up. ‘Augi,’ he signs, speaking it aloud at the same time, and Augi nods once. His serene expression seems strange for his wild appearance, Draco thinks, but he thinks he likes it. ‘I’m Draco… Why talk to me now?’
Draco sees a very distinct tangle of bushy hair atop one of the figures’ heads and he scowls. “Doubtful. I’ll talk to you later.”
“Practice was how many purebloods learned,” Draco advises and Potter is suddenly looking back at him like he’s said Voldemort was a nice guy. Draco arches a brow and looks back at him in silent question.
His shadowy arctic fox leaps out, landing a few paces in front of the white figure, and his brilliant thestral trots right up to the black figure. He doesn’t have to make any verbal commands, they can sense his desires on their own, but as he gives the command to attack and get rid of the figures his animals simply… don’t.
~ ~ ~
Draco had left feeling a bit dejected and tried to distract himself with his colorful Wand-Lighting practice until he came upon the Potter’s in the Entrance Hall. Ron was there, too, and Draco ended up standing beside him as they watched, both boys grinning whenever Harry shot them a despairing look.
Sensing Draco is no longer needed for this conversation, he instead moves around the herd, snapping pictures and moving towards Theodore and Lucky.
There were still plenty of times where their respective walls had gone up and touching was a no-go, but they were fewer and farther between. They hardly ran at each other and hugged every time they saw the other - and wasn’t that a disturbing image? - but there was a comfortability in contact now that hadn’t been there before.
Draco had gotten his play-by-play at that point, relaxing finally, and had asked Sirius to pass on a message for him to Potter.
A hand on his jaw has him looking up to meet Harry’s eyes. His glasses are crooked and Draco absently fixes them with one hand.
“It’s his snow leopard blood,” Harry says confidently.
He’d already had similar instances with Max over the year, but this is the first time Harry’s dealt with it.
“You’re European,” Harry deadpans.
“The article,” Draco says quietly, gulping, “We can’t say we got all this information from you. The hope is that it will cause a stir, but if the Ministry knows the interviewed Lung Dragon was the one they keep imprisoned…”
Half way over a presence pops up at his side and he gulps down his startled shriek. Harry looks hesitant and keeps glancing at Draco and the Slytherin table nervously.
“Just… Just hold on!” Harry calls, flying beneath him.
The shadow of the dragon’s head tilts and Draco gets the distinct feeling they are being laughed at. “I shall,” the dragon finally agrees, and the shadow begins to move in. Clouds curve around the body of the dragon as he emerges, curling around him leisurely, the storm properly subsiding as the giant creatures makes his appearance.
while Draco really wanted to start experimenting with both his magic and potions. Draco had quickly begun wondering what the limitations of magic may be, beyond just Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration, and he couldn’t wait to test said limitations.
When the dust settles, Umbridge stands with her Inquisitorial Squad, a sweet, awful smile on her face, and her wand held loosely in her hands. They look like an invading army.
“That’s a Muggle book.”
“What if she’s going to the toad’s office?” Fred whispers urgently as they maneuver through the halls, the two Gryffindors flanking Draco to keep him out of sight of curious eyes, making it just seem like the twins were walking the halls, and Draco keeps his heightened senses trained on the Ravenclaw’s jittery footsteps.
He removes the top, tossing it aside, then pulls out his wand and sets the end to his chest, over his heart. “
The blonde arches a brow at her before leaning towards her, just a little. “Do you know a Slytherin by the name of Travis Davis? I think you may have been separated at birth…”
moment where we feel powerful. Do you recall what a Militus represents?”
Such students tended to get a nasty hex thrown their way by a very furious blonde.
“They…” Draco begins, but stops when he isn’t sure what he actually wants to say.
Granger gasps, abruptly, and the room glances to her. “The Galleon!” she says in realization and Draco nods.
Here Ada’s smirk turns into a grin. “He took a shower and it turned blue!” she laughs loudly and Draco looks back at her, panic building in his gut. What? It had gotten WORSE? “Oh, relax, you big worry wart. It faded after that.” One of the reasons Ada was Draco’s least disliked was her complete disregard for these unexplainable events. Where the Nubbles and Frederick demanded answers and got frustrated when he had none, Ada thought it was all rather wicked and funny.
The adults will protect you, I promise.”
In the end Draco decides to grab the Turbo XX from his room and head outside to practice. Harry called him a natural on the broom, but Draco knew he still had plenty of work to do.
She also had tried to put the fear of Salazar into all of them, declaring that no one outside of Slytherin had managed to get into their common room for hundreds of years. Draco had thought that something to be proud of… until second year when he’d been made aware that Harry and Weasley would be sneaking into his common room polyjuiced as Crabbe and Goyle. Or, in fourth year, when Eve had blatantly dragged Hermione around in Slytherin dorms right before the Yule Ball. It made him think of how unlikely it actually was for no one to have gotten into their common room in such a long time.
“I didn’t--” Draco snarls, but looks away, glaring up at where the wall meets the ceiling. He runs a hand through his hair, messing up the part straight down the middle, and takes a growling breath. “I did not mean to snap,” he finally says through gritted teeth, looking back down at Tana. “That was unnecessary.”
“Speak for yourself,” Eve snorts, sitting in a chair with Leandra perched on her legs. The Hufflepuff girl still looks flustered about that, which clearly makes Eve exceptionally pleased.
“You don’t honestly believe that,” Draco says sternly but receives no immediate response. “We don’t even know what’s wrong with Sirius right now, but they very well might have the answers when he goes to St. Mungo's. It hasn’t even been twenty-four hours.”
“We need to get it away,” Draco says too quickly, stepping out into the corridor. The troll doesn’t spot him. “He can’t go in there. We… we need to…” He can’t think, panic setting in and keeping him from thinking of a good plan. He just needed to get that monster away from his friend, if she even was still in there.
Draco is quick to slip out of the Records Department, shrinking down his copy of the file and slipping it into one of his many pockets. He heads back up to the Auror offices, intent on getting back to work.
They fall into silence, basking in the morning air, listening to the world as it comes alive, uncaring for the drama they’ve lived through only two nights ago.
“Draco?!” The blonde cringes, feeling a headache coming on, and looks up to snap at whoever it might be to just leave him alone already, but then promptly trips over his own feet when he sees who it is.
He appreciates that. He appreciates everything his mother is doing. Despite hardly running into his father, Draco and Narcissa still plan excuses ahead of time before he heads off to ensure Lucius does not grow suspicious.
“Can you cast it?” he asks, and Sinistra tilts her head. She considers something for a moment, then nods again and waves her hand. The furniture and items and decorations covering the center of her office all begin to move, settling themselves neatly against the walls, and leaving plenty of room in the very middle. “Didn’t realize you had a carpet…” Draco mumbles, eying the gaudy, faded, rainbow carpet.
Umbridge won’t allow them to use any of the spells she is meant to be teaching, only letting them read theory in a clearly outdated book and… what?
Draco lets out a small noise of shock, knees feeling like Jell-O as he sways towards the vault. He looks around, not sure where to even begin. His eyes stray to a black cane leaning against a table nearby with a silver snake head at the top before his eyes continue to wander.
Harry shifts where he’s rested his head against Draco’s shoulder, eying the radio in bafflement. “Why… did you do that?”
“You’re doing quite well, but you will be staying here for the rest of the weekend to properly recover. The first few days are always the most vital.”
Draco, the odd Slytherin out, gets the honor of working with BOTH of the Weasley twins. They actually approach him when they begin, both grinning wickedly, and in between their attempts the three of them end up talking about invention ideas for their joke shop.
Beside him Harry has gone wide-eyed and is looking between the two friends, baffled at Hermione’s ceaseless questions and demands. Draco, on the other hand, waits through it with practiced familiarity before going over what she’d said in order. “How dare you insinuate I cannot make friends without you. Yes, I slept quite well. It is cool and the windows look out under the lake. I am incredibly excited, much as you are. And, yes, I would like that. Could Harry join us at your table?”
They lapse into silence, animosity deteriorating into awkward contemplation. It appeared mutual confusion was a good way to diffuse a conflict.
Right, his letter to Sirius. He had written over twenty drafts by then but had grown so stressed from it all he’d started avoiding the subject. What was he supposed to say? “Hey, I’m your cousin and also famous. Why did you abandon me?” Not even Draco thought that would be fair. He didn’t have all the facts, of course he didn’t, so he didn’t want to start pointing fingers… yet.
“Or when Becky Barron invited everyone else to her birthday party last year except me because I was ‘weird,’ and you said they ‘all deserved a hex to the face’?”
“I think…” Krum begins, holding out his hands expectantly, and Draco is unceremoniously deposited into them. He squeaks, indignant at being passed around, but Krum seems to be trying to help so he keeps his squirming to a minimum. “You can nod and shake your head, yes?”
“I told you I almost was. Back during out sorting.”
“That is a rumor,” Sinistra says without pause, blinks once, and adds, “But it is also true.”
~ ~ ~
Rita Skeeter was a boon for Draco’s investigations. Someone who had built her career on getting information, with something so simple to hold over her, seemed almost too good to be true, even if she was a tacky wench.
Apparently, America and Japan were especially unhappy with each other because Japan had attacked Hawaii while America had been minding their own business. Or something like that.
“I am
The wizard glances back at McGonagall for help, expression verging on panicked. “Listen, that owl… she has a bad habit of biting and sneaking out of her cage. We had to put a lock on her door…” Draco blinks then looks at the cage door. Sure enough, the eagle owl has a little lock on it where all the other cages do not. The blonde frowns at the sight then looks back at McGonagall, pleading for help.
tell, anyway.”
And then the pain begins. A cold, agonizing pain shoots through his chest, gripping around the left side of his ribcage, centered under his scar. Draco quickly grasps it, squeezing his robes and pressing his palm into the source of the pain. It took his breath away and he couldn’t even utter a sound save for a weak gasp.
Theodore takes in a sharp breath and, without looking back, Draco smacks a hand over his mouth to keep him from yelling. The giant beast is staring right at them, but that’s all. Just staring. Yelling could very easily set it off.
And sometimes it was entirely Max’s own fault.
“I guess…” Max mumbles, a pout in their voice, “But who am I even supposed to connect with? I’m serious about there being no one like me on TV! So how many people could really be out in the world?”
He had not mentioned it, but he
“Man, you guys went deep with yours,” Weasley suddenly whines, pouting up a storm as he pours the remainder of one tea into the other so he doesn’t have to hold two cups. Potter immediately starts laughing again while Draco arches a brow and Granger sighs.
In the end, Eve had sent a Howler to Draco to yell at him for worrying too much and they’d decided to just play it by ear.
“The Ministry and the mediwitches will keep researching this new and fascinating phenomenon, because that’s what they do, and maybe one day we’ll be able to wake Sirius back up. None of this is ideal, Harry… but at least this way you’ve given Sirius a chance.”
His mask is gone and Draco thinks he recognizes him as a wizard named Macnair, but he doesn’t have much time to consider it as he’s barreling into Harry. Draco snarls, ready to leap at him, but Sirius is already turning to stun him and kick him off his godson, a frightening scowl on his face.
“You are very nice, Draco. Far nicer than everyone believes,” Lovegood - Luna. She preferred Luna - says one time when they bump into each other outside the library. She is holding a book about magical beast hybrids and Eve, who had walked up with Draco, snickers.
“Oh, look. Are we showing off personal spells?” Luna’s voice cuts in as she and Tracey wander over. Draco, grudgingly, cancels out his spell and turns to them.
Finally, the Hufflepuffs arrive, looking like they’d all sprinted up here as fast as they could, and Draco wonders why. He has no time to ask any questions, however, because only a moment later Professor Sinistra is gliding into the space. She is wearing a different set of robes than at the Welcoming Feast, but they are still dark with stars along the hems, her pointed hat the same color and covered in constellations. They seem to twinkle as if they had been plucked from the sky themselves.
“Thank you, Harry,” Granger says in relief as Draco offers a small, pleased smile, and then they are hurrying off to get to Potions before they all get into trouble with Snape.
Draco stares at the other boy for a long, quiet moment before he throws back his head and guffaws, unable to stop the hysterical laughter as the whole scene puts itself together. Potter is looking at him like he’s lost his mind, and perhaps he has. “You, Potter, are unbelievable! Quite the Slytherin streak you’ve got going there!” Potter looks distinctly unhappy now, face twisting into a scowl.
“It wasn’t about being clever. It was about pissing you off… which it did,” Draco hums, flicking his hair as he speaks. For nearly the whole year he’d kept his hair greased back or parted, looking very pureblood-y, but now he’d finally had the chance to style it again into something  purposefully messy and in his face.
“You heard me,” Draco nods.
“What are you doing out here? Did any of the houses not make it back?” Draco whispers, moving them both up to a wall so they don’t run the risk of getting run over in the middle of a corridor.
Draco nods and shows her his bundle of clothes made just for him. She nods after looking them over and then seems to conjure out of thin air a set of glass phials, brass scales, and a simple, yet elegant, telescope. They bundle all the bulkier things together as best they can and McGonagall shrinks them down to fit into her palm then sets them in a pocket of Draco’s backpack.
“Did I mention Sirius removed the wall with his mother’s portrait on it?” Potter says conversationally as he, Draco, and Eve walk down the streets of London. It’s their third time out during the summer of 1995 and they decided wandering and looking for random, strange things to do would be a good idea.
No, this couldn’t be happening. This could NOT be happening!
And they were in a damn hurry, too! They couldn’t be trapped here!
“If the only people capable of retrieving a prophecy record are the people that a prophecy is about… then that means the only other person who could retrieve the prophecy is You-Know-Who,” Granger sorts out quickly, her eyes widening.
Draco pauses and peaks up at Granger, one brow arched, and she gives a small shrug, saying, “Darry was always my favorite character. What about you?”
Umbridge has snapped. That’s the only way Draco can explain it, watching as she raises her wand at them, her eyes wide, hair wild, and a deranged smile beginning to yank at her mouth.
“Why not? I did with you,” she replies and Draco’s mouth falls open, eyes bugging out.
He feels disconcerted as he always does becoming a human again, but with everything that has happened he hardly pays attention to it.
Draco is far too comfortable to feel embarrassed by this update, just content to hold onto Harry as long as he’s allowed.
“Yeah! ‘Cause we already told her!”
The first was another book, but this one was wizarding in nature.
“You know, you’re no help if you don’t actually, y’know, speak Spanish back,” Max grumbles at him, cheerfulness quickly replaced by frustration.
“We don’t use it anymore…”
“And you… want us to try out?” Draco questions, connecting the dots the best he can.
They keep moving closer to the massive structure until the boats are rolling underneath the castle to a hidden dock where they all clamber out, a new excitement rolling through the group. “Alrigh’, calm down the lot o’ yeh,” Hagrid collects their attention, but he seems mostly amused by the young witches and wizards and their boundless energy. He leads them up to a large door that creaks when he pulls it open to reveal Professor McGonagall in all her stern, composed glory. “Here’s the firs’ years for yeh, Professor,” Hagrid says, his chest puffed out, and the woman nods once at him.
Today, since Granger got there first, the windows show a massive field of flowers “outside” that
“Forever?”
He also begins wondering what the Marauders must have gone through as Animagus. Or even Rita Skeeter.
It was a curious thought, but unimportant at the moment.
“They’re probably off doing something stupid or dangerous,” Eve mumbles when Draco comments on this.
When Draco looks back Harry is glaring at the bathroom door, his displeasure at Theodore palpable, but then he’s smiling reassuringly at Draco, squeezing his shoulder. “It’ll be fine,” he whispers and finally Draco lets out a breath, allowing himself to believe the boy.
He goes back to his book, shoulders tense.
Quidditch practices start up the following week and Draco thinks it is the best and worst thing to happen to him, ever. On the one hand he absolutely adores being in the air, flying around and doing tricks and feeling free. He’s
With Vincent and Greg properly distracted Hermione and Draco began going over some of their other books and talking about their plans for school. Hermione was excited to see everything she had read about in
Draco keeps his head ducked, staring at his tea, and hiding the smirk that has begun playing on his lips. So ironic she would bring up trust and betrayal in this situation.
Not all of the perches and holds along his path are free of gargoyles, getting rid of them all would have actually been suspicious, so he has to clamber over a few after a well-aimed jump, watching for when there is a pause in the flow of students below.
Hope you all enjoyed! I also wanted to say everyones kind comments since my loss have really been a great help and make me happy anytime I read them. Thank you all so much and I hope you are all having a marvelous day!
“Everyone’s fine. I don’t think Cho will be coming back, though…” Harry sighs, resting his cheek against the top of Draco’s head. “She thinks Edgecombe’s treatment was too rough…”
Draco never wants to let go.
Did the boy ever take a break from the Greenhouse? It felt like any time Draco came down Longbottom was already there or would end up showing up a few minutes later.
“No one is breaking the law any further!” she snaps and a few of them cackle.
He can feel Harry nod against him, slow and shaky. “Okay… Okay…” he mumbles, then even more quietly, “Thank you, Draco.”
“An astute observation, Granger. Tell me, have you noticed the sky is blue again today? Apologies if that blows your mind.”
“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” the redhead sounded frustrated for some reason and Draco glances at him. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling with a troll.” That has Harry snorting, obviously finding that funny, and Draco wonders who Fred is.
“SLYTHERIN!”
after all, and everyone knows Muggle technology goes haywire within a magical environment.
“You were keeping Theo from falling into a coma and Weasley from killing himself,” Draco says back.
Draco sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose.
“Are these… different departments? Oh…” Theodore moves to open a door and immediately leans away, cringing at the sight of the Brain Room in all its disturbing glory. He shuts the door slowly, cringing.
“I’ve never gotten mail before,” Draco whispers eventually, his voice small and sad. Ada puts her hand back on his shoulder, comforting, while Frederick sighs and reaches out, gripping the opposite shoulder and squeezing.
“This sounds wicked,” Ada says and Draco looks over. Frederick is reading over her shoulder, looking stunned and amazed. “What’re you going to do though, Draco?”
Right this second, he’s flipping through the photo album he keeps stashed away with his radio and camera. Tana had been just about the only good thing to come out of the summer, Draco grudgingly had to accept. The little house elf was more than happy to help Draco slip a few items past his parents here and there, so long as neither Lucius nor Narcissa asked directly what she was doing. It seemed Tana did not strive for freedom like Dobby had, but she also seemed more than comfortable exploiting loopholes.
Barty Crouch? That wasn’t possible. That couldn’t be possible. Barty Crouch was meant to be so ill he couldn’t show up. That’s why Percy Weasley had shown up in his place. Granger had said so, and Granger made it an obnoxious point to always be right.

Potter takes a deep, shaking breath, bracing himself, then turns onto his side to fully face Draco, the two boys not saying a word as they just stare at each other, both trying to understand what this all means for them. Draco, absently, rubs circles into Potter’s palm with his thumb, and eventually the deep sound of Sirius’s breath indicates he’s fallen asleep before them.
“He’s… fine,” Harry says hesitantly, flinching at his own tone.’’
“Time is a human construct, mom. Don’t let it confine you,” Eric says in reply, looking far too serious.
“Why, now that you mention it,” Sirius says through the door, sounding flippant, “No. I don’t.”
“Why would you ever be a danger to the Order?” Eve asks, head tilted in confusion as she leans against the table.
“He was like a furry noodle,” Potter snickers, offering no help at all, but Draco has to be at least a little bit grateful he didn’t go blabbing about what Draco had seen. Not even to his two, closest friends.
“She probably insulted them before asking for an interview,” Eve sighs with a roll of her eyes. Draco grunts an unfortunate agreement before finally sliding the paper back to Harry. “So, what creature is your ringer?” Eve asks, taking a sip of her coffee.
Draco wants to say that nothing has frightened him, but that isn’t true. Something has certainly shaken him, at the very least, and it is the very same thing that Max suspects Lucius of fearing.
“I’m sorry, what do you mean you already have an invisibility cloak?” Draco demands, sitting on the Hogwarts Express, on his way back home from the most eventful school year of his life. Eve, as usual, is sitting in the farthest seat from him, quietly reading, with Granger beside her. Beside Draco is Potter, and beside Potter is Weasley.
Ever since he could remember Draco was good with animals, but especially snakes. They always calmed down in his presence, slithering around his feet and even letting him scratch their heads. When he had begun to play and take care of the snakes in the garden his foster parents, Mr and Mrs Nubble, had been concerned, but upon realizing he could manage them and they were beneficial for ridding their gardens of vermin they had allowed him to continue.
“Please stop. This is painful to watch,” Draco groans, cringing at the boy, who sags.
“Oh my god,” Eve whimpers and Draco takes a deep, shaky breath. He then leans down, picks up Eve’s wand, and hands it back to her.
“Do you doubt it?” Draco questions, surprised. As frustrating as it was to hear about all these incidents Max had to deal with, hadn’t they grown up with all of this? Didn’t their parents want them to embrace this?
He’d been having so much fun, lost in the humdrum of the crowd, happy even though he’d probably never admit it out loud. Not to the company that had put him in the mood and certainly not to his parents.
“I have always been very, very awful at countering the Imperius, even though mommy tried to teach me,” Tracey explains airily.
“Lucky for me,” Eve says blandly, discreetly removing her wand from her sleeve, “I have no intention of going to any event with a potato like you.” She then, quickly, throws the Earworm Jinx at Blaise, which Draco has realized is becoming something of an epidemic as of late.
“It’s part of my job description,” Draco replies haughtily. “If you want me to stop, then you need to stop playing damsel in distress.”
She didn’t do a house call for Slytherin, though.
Dang it.
“If you wouldn’t mind,” Hermione eventually decides for them and moves herself and the blonde out of the way. The two boys lift up the trunk no issue and get it up into the compartment, accidentally jostling Tootsie’s cage a little but not enough to make her too upset. “Thank you…” Hermione says, voice tapering off as if like a question, and the taller boy straightens up. He was… quite tall. Was he an older student?
“Have you ever seen an alligator?” Potter asks. Hedwig is perched on his bent knee, puffing up happily when her owner runs his fingers through the soft feathers on her chest, and nibbling playfully at the digits when they get within reach. “I’ve heard alligators live in American swamps.”
“Yeah!” Eric manages, “They would have died a NATURAL death in the wild! But- But not little Jay…”
“Why would she want to kill you, though?” Harry demands, sounding more worried than he ever had before.
“I doubt she’d pull anything in broad daylight,” Draco eventually attempts to reason with the panic that hangs over them both. “I’m not sure what she wants to talk about… but there are students walking all over the place. She’d never get away with it.”
The dust immediately makes Draco scrunch up his nose and suppress a sneeze.
“Malfoy…” Potter says again, voice just as quiet, and he takes a tentative step forward.
“They’re lessons would be far too long if they attempted to use every method for every lesson,” Draco had argued, perfectly reasonable, but Harry had kept frowning.
“We already did, though,” Ginny  says cheerfully, immediately getting hit by a Granger-glare next.
“You…”
~ ~ ~
“I still think anyone calling him ‘Uncle Severus’ is weird,” Harry mumbles, half to himself.
“I want them to be acting normally, not paying attention to me. Do you not know what ‘candid’ means?” he says with a huff, then scowls and flaps his hand at Potter, “And sit down, already! You’re making me anxious.”
“She’ll be a menace,” McGonagall sighs, stepping over and using the back of her knuckles to pet the eagle owl’s head. The owl seems just as happy with her as she does with Draco, pressing into the petting before returning her attentions to her new owner.
“I hardly think that necessary,” Draco scoffs and the official pouts. Did she think she was dealing with a small child?
“Linner?” Draco repeats, confused, but thankful to be talking about something else.
“Not many people do,” Duke smiles softly at Harry. “I know my opinion will mean little to you, we just met, but I wanted to tell you that I am proud of you, Mr. Potter. You have stuck with your convictions through all of the ridicule and cruelty, and that takes a strong kind of soul.”
It apparently
Not that they did anything special, but they knew.
“No, no, I wanted to apologize that now you know the only way you can beat me to the Snitch is if I’m unconscious.”
And then they met Neville Longbottom.
Problem was, sometimes Eve disappeared. Not for long, but the girl liked her space and it was near impossible to find her when she did not want to be found. He’d looked around her usual spots in the castle, then down in Slytherin, and finally found himself in front of the fourth year girls’ dormitory. He’d already checked with Eve’s dormmates, but they were clueless too.
“You can borrow my copy of
When everyone dissipates to begin practicing the spell, Harry’s smile has slipped a little.
“He used it to save me from Crouch,” the boy whispers, turning his face up towards Draco. He’s not smiling, he’s clearly too wiped for that, but he looks a little serene. “Saving me all over again, Prince Charming?”
“Lies,” Draco snaps, and Potter just shrugs, clearly not having a defense for that.
The thing is, though, he doesn’t even try to connect with the other Slytherins. Draco can’t blame him for Theodore, Millicent, and Pansy, but everyone else seems fine in their year. Every meal the boy drags Draco over to the Gryffindor table, looking frantic until they sit down and he’s talking to Ron. Draco certainly doesn’t mind talking to Hermione, but he doesn’t think they should be avoiding their own house’s table so much. Judging by the looks he gets from Percy - that’s the prefect Weasley - and some of their own house Draco suspects he’s not the only one.
“Your wording is perfect,” Sinistra says, praising in her own, emotionless way, and Draco looks up at her. She tilts her head, staring back at him, and repeats, “Think about what you fight for. Think very hard. Reconsider your memory. Try again.”
“Everyone’s afraid of something. My mama told me so.” That draws Draco up short. Max’s mother? Muggle or not, a mother was a mother, and they knew far more than anyone could ever fathom. Draco’s own mother had proven that. “Maybe your dad is scared of everything changing, like with those traditions and junk. Maybe that’s why he’s trying to get rid of them.”
Hermione was a witch. She was magical just like he was. It made so much sense, yet so little as well. How had no one ever heard of this? How was this such a massive secret to the rest of the world? McGonagall had said the “wizarding world,” which insinuated it had to be big, but somehow it had remained a complete secret.
That wasn’t normal, even for wizarding kind.
“Oh, come on, Malfoy, none of us looked very hard for it, either,” Weasley’s voice cuts in, not sounding all that soft or reassuring, but Draco thinks that’s pretty appropriate for their interactions.
“You have a problem with Gryffindor?” Draco immediately demands, hackles rising.
“No, no, I just have to get used to it,” Draco waves him off, then proceeds to start saying “boyfriends” over and over again in varying tones and pitches.
When Harry ducks his head in embarrassment Draco moves to follow him, bending forwards so he can get back into Harry’s line of sight. “I’m serious. You have a talent and drive to help others that sometimes greatly concerns me.”
Sinistra inclines her head in another nod. “She should be in her office right now,” she says with a knowing glint in her eye.
Umbridge taps her fingers against her desk in consideration, circling around it slowly to take a quiet, measured seat into her desk chair. She leans back, eyes narrowed, as she observes the fuming, shaking Harry, snarling at her like a caged beast.
The comment doesn’t garner a laugh, no one is really in the mood for jokes, but it makes some of the tension in Potter’s shoulders begin to lessen.
“You look chipper today, Potter!” Draco calls over the roar of wind and rain. He floats as casually as one can when soaked to the bone and constantly having to slick his hair out of his eyes. The storm isn’t enough to stop the first Quidditch game of the season, but it certainly drenches everyone’s moods.
“Does any of that help?” Max asks after a few more beats of contemplation.
It won’t be until many months later that Draco gets this particular roll developed, thanking Tana as she hands him all of the glossy photos. It isn’t hard to find Eve’s stunt with the camera, the pictures starting off far shakier than Draco’s and including their aquarium visit.
“Who knows what I’ll discover by accident! Maybe I’ll even discover world peace!”
The first voice he hears, however, isn’t from in front of him, but from the radio in his hand, and it isn’t Max’s.
At least with the DA, or anyone who knew about the warded library table - the Room of Requirement was locked off by Umbridge - they could plan some incidents. Similar to how Draco had “fought” with the Golden Trio over the year, the good half of the Inquisitorial Squad could stage attacks on willing participants.
“What’s wrong with my family’s name?” Draco demands, hackles rising in a sudden surge of protective indignation. He didn’t know anything about his family, didn’t know if he had any remaining relatives or family friends. He knew nothing about his parents save they had been in Slytherin and were rich. But he also knows that they loved him so much they would die for him, and that is enough for him to feel protective over anything anyone would say about them.
Draco stares back at it, though, and feels a connection to the creature. He can tell, without it doing a thing, that it’s a mischievous thing, and when Draco reaches out to it, it leans its head forward so he can pet it.
“Can you two be weird when I’m not around? Both of you together is exhausting,” Draco scowls, earning a pair of wide-eyed stares a moment later. It made him want to shudder.
“I thought Gryffindors were meant to be courageous,” Draco growls, looking over his shoulder at Weasley, who gives him a rather dismissive shrug.
“There’s also an Outsiders film, y’know,” Hushburn had informed him once he had calmed down. Thankfully, only because of Max, he already knew what a film was.
A new wave of horror and misery crashes over Draco at the reminder. They were alone, but it wouldn’t last. Death Eaters would be coming and going from his childhood home, soon.
Draco doesn’t even realize he’s moving until after he’s already rushing back to Potter’s side, reaching frantically into his robes, and yanking out his camera. Potter doesn’t seem to realize he’s there, instead crying out and grasping at his head as Draco flicks a switch on his camera and raises it.
Draco tilts his head, eying the frustrated boy with an arched brow. “I suspect it has something to do with the Black Family home,” he says, Potter looking up at him slowly. “I attempted to remember the address some time ago, but could not. I suspect a new Fidelius Charm has been placed on it.”
as well and he was beginning to wonder if Muggles were… okay. Did they need help? Was a mass group therapy session in order?
Alright, I hope you all enjoyed! If you made it through it all...
“Muggles don’t even know this place exists, though,” Draco argues. It was hard to compare their knowledge of one another when one party wasn’t even privy to the other’s existence.
Draco swallows, immediately not liking where his mind is taking him, and he forces down all the sickening feelings that are building up inside him. He couldn’t address this now, couldn’t think about it. He and Weasley were on the clock and they couldn’t dilly-dally anymore.
“Isn’t your mom the puriest-pureblood to ever pureblood?” Eve questions in disbelief.
“It’s pretty cool, right? Never even thought about what they’re daily lives must be like,” Theodore says, taking back the paper when Draco passes it over.
“He could just as easily lie to us, if he wants,” Draco says, growing more and more frustrated. “He’s crafty, innocent or guilty.”
“Uh, yeah. I’ll do my best.”
“Good,” Snape lowers the spoon then turns back to his cauldron, back fully to his godson, but he continues to speak in a clipped tone. “Your father is uneasy with the idea of traditions changing.” Draco suspects Snape means “afraid” instead of “uneasy,” but he dares not say it aloud. “Do I believe Muggleborns might change our society? Yes.”
“No! Turn it off! I am not having that stuck in my head, you hear me?” Hermione demands, but Draco moves the CD player out of her reach before she can snatch it. He’s grinning now, the song going on. “Malfoy, I’m serious, stop it!”
“What do you do in space camp?”
lose it and he wasn’t going to take the chance.
“Keep moving! Keep moving!” Harry is yelling in his ear, dragging him frantically. His cloak is gone, it and Draco’s invisibility cloak bundled up and stuffed under Tracey’s arm. The girl is dragging Weasley towards the door while Harry and Longbottom throw spells back on an advancing Bellatrix and some other Death Eaters.
“Millicent… Bulstrode?” Lee questions, face pinched and confused.
“What did I miss?” Draco says, walking up to the Trio. Granger stops pacing and looks at him, opening her mouth, then biting her lip and glancing at Potter. Draco, thoroughly confused, looks to Potter as well.
“You mean you will hear from me,” Draco corrects blandly, but Max waves him off.
“To my knowledge he was actually disowned,” Harry offers weakly, looking apologetic and concerned at once. “He, uh, didn’t care for his family’s traditions and rebelled. Ended up in Gryffindor with my dad, too.”
To his side Potter says softly enough that Draco doesn’t immediately notice it, “
And then they don’t really pull away. They stop laughing but keep swaying to the distant beat of the Yule Ball, Potter’s face hidden in Draco’s shoulder, and Draco staring off into the middle distance. It strangely doesn’t feel awkward anymore, instead that familiar, comfortable silence washing over them.
Draco, left alone, attempts to go back to his photography, but he can’t help the nervous twisting in his gut at what is to come.
was wrong but no one knew what. He wouldn’t wake up despite appearing fine on a surface level. He’d likely need special care beyond anything Draco could imagine.
“I copied documents from the Records Department. How many times do I have to say it?” Draco snaps, slowly lowering his hands when he thinks Granger is done screaming. The best way, he found, to deal with his crippling fears, was snark.
“I know what I saw and I know what I heard! Kreacher is happy about something and you know how much he hates Sirius!” Harry roars and, grudgingly, Draco takes a step back to give him his space.
“Duke or Cecil is fine when I’m off the clock,” he says, then looks to Ms. Hushburn and smiles. “I owe you thanks…”
“Aye, Draco Malfoy,” Hagrid says, turning and smiling at Draco in a way it makes the boy’s shoulders relax. “You’ve been creatin’ quite the stir, ain’ ye? Good ter see someone lookin’ out fer THAT one,” Hagrid makes a motion towards Harry with his head and the boy flushes. Draco glances over at him thoughtfully, before shrugging and smiling back at Hagrid.
“A punk…?” Draco repeats quietly, not sure if Eric is being serious or picking on him. Usually, when Draco heard someone was being a punk, it wasn’t considered a good thing.
“I have to become an Animagus.”
~ ~ ~
“That could be quite helpful,” Draco observes, being honest, but scowls the moment the ginger looks at him with his stupid grin.
“No…” the beast’s voice echoes, no longer a painful boom, but still deep and powerful. He sounds almost aristocratic, if Draco’s being honest. “You are merely here to manipulate your government. Typical humans… Constantly fighting each other.” The shadow shifts and begins to fly circles around the stone structure, staying hidden in the clouds, but still speaking. “It is because of your endless fighting that they forgot why I was originally here. They forgot, and thus assumed. They assumed I was a threat. They built new governments atop my head and believed they kept themselves safe keeping me locked away down here.”
hates you, actually. I have no doubts that whoever put your name in the Goblet of Fire despises you and wants you dead.” Or could benefit off Potter’s involvement. Draco thinks of Bagman and his obsession with placing bets. There may be a connection there…
At least, that’s what it was beginning to feel like. After spotting them so often over the tops of the Forbidden Forest, or running into them while Luna and Tracey fed them, or spotting them occasionally while taking a run through the forest, now they were the main subject for Hagrid’s first Care of Magical Creatures class after returning.
“Why didn’t it unlock when me and Malfoy went down there, though? When we interviewed Huang-Jun? If it was about Gryffindors and Slytherins or whatever bullshit you came up with, why not then?” Weasley whines, because he can’t let this go, apparently, and Draco sneers.
“Draco? What--”
“No kidding. I hate these stupid parties. There’s nothing to do!”
Dobby, looking properly shaken, does as ordered and looks underneath the bed, then stands back up again. “Dobby sees nothing, Young Master, but that is because the Mistress ordered it so…”
“And a little disappointed you didn’t assume I was repeating my father again.”
“Ron and Hermione know.”
“If they are Native American, why did you bring them up?” Draco asks, confused, and the following silence makes him feel nervous. Had he just asked something odd? How much did these totems play a part in Muggle culture? He’d gotten so good at keeping up with Muggle culture!
“Who wouldn’t? Just because you all have been desensitized…” he trails off, letting his meaning go unsaid but understood.
you go with?” Harry had snapped, doing a valent effort of ignoring Granger to keep from blowing up at her and her babying.
What would Eve be writing him for so suddenly? They’d only just started their break. Maybe she’d misplaced something and thought Draco knew?
“I was actually wondering what you all thought of a skeleton key,” Draco suggests, and the twins brighten up immediately at the prospect of new ideas.
“Check.”
Look at all this stuff… He thought a fortune would just be money, but no, this was so much more. Heirlooms, maybe? Was that what all the objects were? And look at those books. He would absolutely need to bring Hermione here some time.
“Yeah, maybe. I’d just hate to dig up stuff that my Mama and Papa have tried to put behind them.”
Draco snorts at that, in clear agreement. It seemed the only people who liked Umbridge were the people who got something out of her. Which meant only the most stereotypically Slytherin Slytherins could stand her. Unfortunately, these were also the most vocal Slytherins…
“Are you done?” he growls
Snape’s robes very nearly crack like a whip as he swings around, pointing the spoon he had been using directly at Draco, a very cold fury deep in his eyes. “You will not use that word around me again,” he says, his voice far too controlled for the look on his face. It sends dangerous chills up Draco’s spine and he stiffens, eyes widening in shock. “Do you understand, Draco Malfoy?”
Except when Draco stands and pushes at the door, the magically induced lock keeps it from opening fully. It budges a little, wood scraping against stone on the side where the hinges had been detached, but doesn’t fall away.
“I have Ptolemy,” Draco cuts in, sounding cheerful, and Ron looks over at him immediately. Draco then picks up his backpack, which he’d only brought along originally to help out Hermione on her toad hunt, and pulls out a couple of cards held together by a rubber band. He undoes the band and shows Ron his Ptolemy card. The portrait is also currently occupied by said wizard, who is looking at Ron skeptically, like he isn’t a fan of being traded.
“Except that would have cost more than the entire United States budget, let alone NASA’s Apollo project.”
So I intended to get all of book 4 into this chapter, but now that Draco has a more prominent roll there's so much more to write! It got so long I had to split it up, otherwise the flow would have been ruined, and I didn't want y'all waiting forever!
They don’t even have time to
He gets sent to his room after that, where he locks the door and hardly comes out for the rest of the holidays. Luckily, to better his mood, Tana brings him a package from Max and their family. There is a Christmas gift from each of the Muggles.
“I was thinking I’d tell her I broke up with you.”
“Why not tonight?” Draco suggests, “We need to spread the word about ‘Sinistra’s Uagadou-Level Wandless Tutoring Club.’ We can pass on the specifics to the DA while we do that.”
“His reasonings are surely profound… But, I am uncertain. He simply is very vocal about his distaste for him.” Draco shrugs, despite Max being unable to see him, and he leans back in the tub. He had begun bringing blankets in to pile into the tub whenever he planned on having longer chats with Max.
Draco could groan. If anyone could beat Max in shear, rambling capabilities, it was their father. “Nothing you need concern yourself with, old man,” Draco snaps, not in the mood for this either, and he moves to shut off his radio.
“We’ll be fine,” Blaise adds on, in a rare instance of sincerity, and his hand grabs for Draco’s invisible shoulder. It’s just a quick squeeze of reassurance, but something solid and begrudging settles in Draco’s stomach.
They don’t linger, though, because there’s something about this situation that makes Draco think they might be on the clock. Why else would the Gryffindors have run off so suddenly without preamble? Without waiting for Draco?
Draco proceeds to pull out a crystal phial from his satchel, a bluish-purple liquid held within, and stands. He hadn’t just come up to the Astronomy Tower this evening to talk and do homework. Oh no, tonight he finally has the opportunity to finish his Animagus Potion.
“I don’t think I can do it,” he says quickly, shoulders sagging, and Draco’s lips twist downward. When Longbottom looks up at him, however, his eyes are shockingly hopeful. “But… maybe tomorrow?”
.oOo.
Ah, so Cho Chang had come to greet Potter, and Weasley had accidentally run her off with his big mouth. Judging by the severe blush on Potter’s face he’s completely mortified by the encounter, attempting to hide further and further into Draco’s side, like he can fuse with his robes and disappear forever.
“Offer?” Draco squeaks. He still felt horribly panicky, but this meeting was not going at all like he had expected.
He forces himself to breathe, breath coming in through a mouth with larger teeth than he is used to, and a set of nostrils that feel too big. It is disorienting and shocking and he doesn’t feel right, except he’s never felt more right in his life.
“What are you doing?” Longbottom hisses as Draco waits for Eric to come on. The Slytherin arches one, thin eyebrow.
“The day after?” Draco’s brows furrow as he begins to walk again, but doesn’t go back to his pictures.
The night prior he and Harry hadn’t managed to get much talking done after kissing for… a long amount of time. They were both exhausted from a long day and had instead fallen asleep curled up close to each other on the narrow couch. Despite the discomfort of the furniture, Draco had slept peacefully.
“I don’t… really believe you’re an afterthought,” Draco finds himself admitting in the silent atmosphere of Potter’s bedroom, and Potter’s green eyes widen in surprise and shock. He stares a while longer, searching Draco, before something seems to break in his eyes and he leans into Draco so urgently it feels like Draco might be the only thing keeping him together.
“I wish we could use your documents from the Records Department to help you.”
“Not allowed to leave at night save for Astronomy class,” Draco sighs, ignoring the stab of guilt when he remembers last night, standing and brushing off some of the grass on his pants. He doesn’t offer to help as Vivian begins collecting all her supplies and she doesn’t ask.
He finds out that Bagman had been entangled with the law a few times in the past. He once played professional Quidditch, which Draco already knew, but had also been put on trial after the First Wizarding War for passing on information to the Death Eater Augustus Rookwood, but had claimed he had not known of Rookwood’s position.
Draco, in a moment of horrifying clarity, realizes that this isn’t a Muggle fantasy after all.
Longbottom looks baffled as he numbly takes the cloak from Blaise, clearly having not expected this. “Me?!” he squeaks, which sounds terrible around his broken nose.
Draco nods slowly then looks back at Vincent, curious what this reason for not speaking could be, but not even he’s that blunt. “How DO you talk, then?” he asks and Vincent immediately raises his pudgy hands and makes a series of complex movements.
Skeeter glares daggers at Draco, fist clenching so tightly around her sugar quill the stick snaps in half. Draco just keeps smirking, waiting, until she releases a long, angry breath.
Apparently the two were working on a joke shop with the money Potter had given them from his Triwizard Tournament winnings. Draco, seeing no issue with it, had given them permission to develop more of the magical radios and see if they sold. They promised Draco a cut, about 25%, and Draco had said he would accept it but only if they did well.
“Why do you two look like drowned cats?”
They fall into awkward silence, previous animosity dwindling. Draco still was anxious as to why Potter had come up here, or how he’d known to do so, but the other boy’s actions were… well, it still made Draco anxious, but now for an unknown reason.
First Muggle book I ever read. You can borrow it if you like, and return it when you’re done.”
“Have I ever told you how jealous I am that you don’t have Religion class at your school?” Max asks one rainy day in the April of Draco’s third year, the raindrops making tinging, rhythmic noises on the roof of the Hogwarts greenhouses.
“Ge’ him free! Quick!” Longbottom’s voice is saying quickly, trying to stay a whisper despite Weasley’s pained squeals, and Harry’s already hurling spells at the brain and its tentacles, but nothing is working. Desperate, Draco runs forward, biting down on a tentacle, but it immediately flings him off like he’s nothing.
“Then, after you finally got some rest, you ended up hating everything you’d been so excited about before.”
“No! No, someone attacked her when we weren’t looking,” Harry quickly says, setting both his Nimbus 2000 and Draco’s Turbo XX to the side before he crouches beside the shaking blonde and sets an arm around his shoulders.
“Now you be nice, little cousin,” Sirius says, wagging his finger at the glaring blonde, “Harry hasn’t had fleas since Christmas.” Potter quickly jabs his godfather in the ribs with his elbow for that comment, but Sirius just grins through it and chuckles.
“Sorry,” Potter mumbles after one such moment, his brow damp from sweat and Draco’s arm loosely curled around his shoulders, keeping him steady and upright.
Then, Tracey’s head is ducking down and she’s giving the brain a look that, while unchanged, feels sadder than before. “This brain has Muggle thoughts…” she whispers as Harry is throwing his cloak properly around himself and Weasley again.
. They just,” Draco wiggles his fingers like that means something, “fly.”
“You’re always starving,” Harry grins and Ron pouts but then they’re splitting up and beginning to head in the directions of their common rooms.
“Yes… yes it did,” she says softly, sliding her hand off Draco’s shoulder and crouching down to be closer to his level.
There are no bells or jingles to announce their arrival, probably so as to keep the owls relaxed, but there is a front desk only a few feet away with a tired looking wizard sitting behind it. The place is dark and cramped, full of cages and shelves pushing in from every direction. Bird droppings litter the floor and the occasional noise of an owl hooting or ruffling its feathers fills Draco’s ears.
for a week. I know you said you were interested in creating new spells, so perhaps this could help,” Hermione offers, accustomed by now to having to make deals with her friend. It was never over anything serious, but Draco loved seeing her get frustrated with him.
The blonde boy deflates and has the decency to look sheepish, glancing away. He was so used to having to defend his friends from Theodore and Millicent that he was naturally snappish to anyone who brought them up out of nowhere. “Oh.”
“It is a good subject. Misunderstood,” Krum says, nodding in approval as he is given his own book back. “Are you knowing of the vand light varning?” he asks.
“We aren’t done with the museum, yet, Max!” Max’s father calls from across the room, clearly frazzled, but Max keeps pulling at Draco, unaware of the conversation they’ve interrupted.
“Oh, what a sweet gesture,” the official coo’s, “Could I get a name so I can put you into our visitor records?”
He’s like a spider monkey, clinging onto the nearest source of warmth. Despite the warming days, Grimmauld Place could still get drafty, and it seemed Draco’s blanket simply hadn’t been enough.
If possible, Potter turns an even deeper shade of red, a shiver running up his back, before swatting at Draco, making the blonde laugh again. “Oh, shut up and get that ridiculous sign down,” he snaps and Draco makes a show of bowing to him, before shifting into a snow leopard and climbing easily into the rafters. He unhooks the sign that reads “Have a Harry Christmas” with his claws before leaping back down, shifting, and folding it up.
“Really! We just want to talk!” he tries again. Rain has begun to fall, splattering his face like knives, and he squints against the onslaught.
“What do you mean?” Weasley questions suspiciously, leaning back like he expects Draco to say something so insulting it might cause him physical harm. If only…
“Or maybe it is because the only reason your ‘people’ have been successful is because you have used the suppression of these minorities as stepping stones to the top and they’re sick of it! If they actually DID go about stealing your jobs, then all they’d be doing is following your lead!”
At this point, angry and frazzled, he was ready for anything.
He had been driving his foster family up the wall with it, too. He still did his chores, but it took him longer with his daydreaming. He had learned not to let Tootsie loose in the house early on after Mrs. Nubble had nearly ripped him apart with her furious screeching. He kept leaving a mess of his books everywhere and wouldn’t shut up about every little thing he read.
“He should hurry up before someone else does,” Draco hums noncommittedly.
He expects her to continue on her own, but when she doesn’t he sighs and asks in clear, fake interest, “What have you been curious about, Eve?”
“Well… Show us, then!” Granger demands, looking back at Draco with her arms crossed and toe tapping. The Slytherin’s brows rise, before he shrugs and holds his wand vertically.
Draco, only six, doesn’t see why he shouldn’t. He knows his parents wouldn’t be happy, so he slips the radio into a deep pocket on his robes, hidden away. Max smiles at this, looking incredibly happy and thankful, and Draco smiles back.
“I need this to work already,” Draco growls, glaring down at the glass phial in his hands. “The final task is in three days and I need everything ready by then. It is the perfect opportunity to sneak in, but I need this trump card or…”

“You’d do well as an Animagus. Someone like you would probably be something small and cowardly. Plus, you wouldn’t have to depend on me.”
“Do I think what is weird?”
“He asked Luna to keep feeding them on occasion,” Tracey replies, blinking out at what she sees as empty space. “I invited Theodore because he secretly likes the thestrals now and I wanted him to meet them.”
The second he’s crouched in front of the door, wand out, Draco utters a sharp, “
“So? We saw plenty of records shatter. None of them caused that kind of reaction,” Ginny says, one of her brows arched. She looks a little pale and sweat is beading on her brow. She must be in a lot of pain and, after sitting around for so long, the adrenaline might be wearing off. This could be helpful for slow, stealthy movement later, but definitely not for dealing with her injuries.
“Maybe we can run,” Harry hisses as they march to what could very well be their doom. “Flee the country. Attend Beauxbaton, maybe.”
“We’ll get back to you when we have the radios,” George says, also standing, and then both boys are turning and hurrying out of the library, whispering quickly to each other as they go.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You saw something?” Draco questions, turning back to Potter.
“… I don’t hate Johnny.”

Then, like a switch has been flipped, everything feels heavy when he spots someone else approaching Potter from the side. Cho Chang is making her way towards Potter, looking sheepish, and just beyond her Draco can see Granger nudging Weasley giddily.
“What’s wrong with Hermione?” Tracey asks, flitting over to Longbottom and stepping on the petrified Death Eater in the process.
The Order was likely panicking up a storm with Potter gone. He might as well calm them down… He would tell them where Potter was
He snaps his finger loudly. “I got it!” he exclaims excitedly and Umbridge looks back at him, her expression wild and furious. “I may not have proof on who might be running the club, but I bet I know where they’re meeting.”
Quickly the ghosts float closer and begin chatting with them. Some of the students seem wary, inching away, but some seem perfectly at home with the spirits. Spirits of
“I do, don’t I?” Draco smirks, ruffling up his hair with his fingers before continuing. “I require your cooperation in a little investigation I’m doing. You would be perfect in finding out juicy information. I may even let you print some of it if it is substantial enough.”
Draco could understand that.
“Wouldn’t dream of it, Weasley,” Draco shrugs. Potter sidles up next to him, then, the two watching as Weasley fumbles to get the candy open, Granger assisting and pouring handfuls of the candy into both of their hands.
Somehow, in a daze of confusion and pain, he manages to get them away from the encircling dementors still above them and down to the pitch. He is having trouble concentrating on the cries around him and about a foot from the ground he drops both himself and Potter to the wet grass.
Sirius looks between the two boys with a raised brow, confused, but doesn’t push the subject. They end up wishing Draco farewell a moment later, hurrying off to meet up with the Weasley’s for Potter’s big day. Draco, alone once more, goes back to taking photos of some of the decorative statues and gargoyles, enjoying the calm before the storm.
“You get down here this instant!” Umbridge is shrieking, her wand brandished as Fred and George whoop and holler on their brooms in the air. The Inquisitorial Squad is also there, some trying to shoot down the twins while others are trying not to trip in the mud. “You think this is funny, do you?!” Umbridgee continues to holler, her face blotchy and red.
He sees a sweets shop, which he thinks would make a good place to get Ada her souvenirs, as well as book stores, clothing stores, and… was that store selling brooms? That was an odd thing to specialize in. Unless…
At one point he nudges Blaise to get his attention, however, and takes off one of his shiny rings. He wears one on each hand, usually; one with the Malfoy “M” on it and the other with the Slytherin emblem.
“The people you’ve wronged? The people our families have stepped on? They’ve asked, screamed, pleaded for help, and they’ve been ignored, so now? Now, they’re fed up and they’re furious and they, rightfully, want
“Could you have fucked it up?”
Neville Longbottom stands at the front of the greenhouse, door shut behind him, and a concerned expression on his face. He’s wearing his dragonhide gloves already along with casual clothes and an apron. He looks like he’s prepared to be in the greenhouse for a long while.
like a good idea at the time, but you’ll seriously regret it when you forget about those gummy bears and now you have a sticky cast!”
“Probably…” Potter sighs, still looking at the animal. He looks kind of nervous, but not so much that anyone would be concerned.
“Oh,” both twins mumble, no longer finding this all that funny.
“Are you good at potions because it’s tradition?” Draco asks, rolling around the smooth sphere, watching how the faint torchlight makes it look like maple syrup.
It is clear, the moment the Slytherins walk in, that the other houses aren’t too excited they’re there. They keep their distance, ostracizing the serpents to a far corner, and Smith even makes a rude comment. The walking example that not all Hufflepuffs are friendly is shut down a moment later by the Weasley twins, thankfully, which keeps the mean comments to a minimum.
It leaves Draco slowly becoming more aware that, at some point in the night, he has become the Boy-Who-Lived’s personal hugging pillow. It isn’t graceful at all, Potter’s arms tightly around his torso and one leg tangled with Draco’s own while the other is thrown hazardously over Draco’s hip. He’s being squeezed by all the Gryffindor’s might and Potter has completely hidden his face away in the crook of Draco’s neck.
Draco is incredibly disappointed, but not at all surprised by the outcome.

“Because I am ambitious, resourceful, and cunning. Why else?” the blonde snaps, but then tries to pull himself together and reign in his anger. He straightens his back and eyes Ron down coolly, “Well… that and I look spectacular in green.”
gone. The moment the floo fire had faded to embers, the moment the laughter had disappeared, Draco had rushed upstairs and straight for his room, scrambling until he could burst in.
“Hush, you, you know what I mean. You didn’t even like twinkies!”
“What are you talking about?” Eve, just behind Draco, coos. Both she and Draco are smirking at Skeeter, who has a horrendous level of mud all over her tacky robes. “I think the centaurs absolutely LOVED you.”
“If you want to show someone what a thestral looks like, you will need to draw them,” Luna says, voice as airy and light as usual, “They only appear to those who have seen death. Including in pictures.”
“I’m… I’m very confused…” Eve admits, looking between her girlfriend, Draco, and Weasley.
Draco stiffens, hands tightening around the radio and eyes widening. “N-nothing is… wrong with me! What’s wrong with you?”
“Yeah… I guess so,” Draco sighs miserably, finally picking up his copy of
But Draco’s attention quickly focuses back on the game. He feels the wind whip through his hair as he races after the grouping of Chasers vying for the Quaffle. Johnson maneuvers through the air like a fish in water, fluid and graceful. Adrian Pucey dives for her side, hand snatching for the Quaffle, but Johnson does a trick flip that sends the Slyhterin Chaser spiraling out of control.
“I think that was ‘good night,’” Harry guesses, still looking rather pale. Draco nods, then looks at Hermione pleadingly. Before he can ask if there is any way they can stay the night someone else speaks up from behind them.
Weasley looks back at Draco with a smarmy smirk on his face and Draco can feel an argument mounting. Like a storm. “Good luck with that. You do know ‘Malfoy’ means ‘bad,’ right?”
Draco swallows and raises his wand, forcing his body to remain firm. “
“What?” he snaps, pointedly rubbing his ear when the girl finally looks up. She still doesn’t look apologetic.
At one of the last dinners of the holiday, in a surprise show of bluntness, his mother asks if Draco has considered any of the students at Hogwarts like she’d asked him to do. Reciprocating that bluntness, he replies, “Penelope Clearwater,” who is an older half-blood girl. This obviously doesn’t please his parents, so he pushes his luck. “Well, it was either her or Evangeline Hushburn or Hermione Granger.” Both Muggleborns.
“I am not doing that,” Potter says quickly and Draco cackles at him. “Oi! Excuse me for not wanting needles jabbing holes in me.”
“Uh, he said that I have… Hypo-- shit, no. Uh, hyper… hyper-something.”
So, all in all, Draco had gotten no help in his decision from Max. He still had plenty of time to consider his options, and technically none of his choices would lock him into any path, but it was still something that worried him.
“Hermione Granger,” he says more confidently, looking up at the woman, doing his best to meet her eyes. “She has mysterious things happen to her too, things we could never explain, and I recently learned she was preparing to go to a new boarding school. That was you all, wasn’t it?” He jabs a finger at the woman and Mr Nubble swats at him to not be rude, so he quickly pulls his hand back to his lap.
That still meant there was someone throwing the worst Unforgiveable around.
“Harry… kissed me a few days back,” he ignores the loud squeal Max lets out when he says that, instead continuing on. “He kissed me, then ran away, and then he went missing because Mr. Weasley got hurt.”
“The Allied Forces were responding to a great, great evil, Draco. No one is in disagreement there,” Max’s father suddenly speaks up. Apparently, he had been listening the whole time while he had rambled to his two children. It would have been impressive if it didn’t unnerve Draco so much. “But a lot of awful, terrible things happened on both sides of the war.”
“You do play Gryffindor first,” Hermione says, speaking up for the first time since Ron snapped at her. Draco eyes Hermione and Ron suspiciously, unhappy that his friend would feel the need to remain quiet like that. “Having a few extra brooms in the air would be a big help.”
“Yeah! Doesn’t feel great being out of the loop, does it?!”
McGonagall’s brows have risen, the wrinkles on her face more prominent as they scrunch up, but then she’s offering that tiny, slightly reassuring smile and Draco releases a held breath. “You are quite clever. I wonder if you will be a Ravenclaw with that wit.” Draco had no idea what a Ravenclaw was. “Yes, Miss Granger is a witch. A muggleborn, specifically. Professor Flitwick, Hogwarts’s Charms teacher, assisted her and her family not too long ago, if I am remembering correctly.”
What was Sinistra’s game? Of course Harry and Draco had left differently, they’d flown to Gryffindor tower, but she shouldn’t seem so surprised if she had been the one to attack them. Draco glances at Harry and, judging by the other boy’s pinched look, he was thinking along the same lines.
Hope you liked what you read! We're finally making some progress with these boys! Oh, and also the story. Progress in that too. There's just so much that happens in this year, it's tough to get so much in to a satisfactory level.
would be coming and going from his childhood home.
“I suppose… a short debate on the subject would not hurt,” Granger says slowly and Draco smiles triumphantly. “But only a short one!”
“She’s muggleborn, right?” the girl continues and Theodore snickers. Draco’s hold on his cutlery tightens.
“It is their job, is what you are saying,” Draco reiterates, rolling his quill between his fingers.
He’s ready to head back to the dorms, but he takes a moment to enjoy the scene and even snap a few pictures.
“Don’t call yourself that…”
“Alphabetizing, young master!” Tana chirps, nods at her work, then steps away. The books HAD always been in alphabetic order, now that he thought about it, but he’d never been the one to put them that way, which had him thinking…
The twins fall silent, glancing at each other, and Draco can’t help but arch a brow as they wait. He knew the twins were pranksters, everyone knew that, but Ron had mentioned a few times that they were quite clever too. They simply took things less seriously than others.
Good. The twins had gotten here ahead of him to warn everybody.
The trip goes well enough, buying sweets and talking and finding the best possible table at the Three Broomsticks to sit at, scaring off the kids that were already sitting there. He even swears he sees Potter’s mangled hair bouncing around through the crowds at one point, but chalks it up to his imagination. The boy still didn’t have a signed permission slip.
“You ever wonder what the meaning of life is?” Max questions a few days after they turn thirteen. “I’m a teenager now! I should be thinking about these deeper things, y’know?”
“Of course I am. You're the Slytherin that turned all goody-goody, not me,” Theodore huffs, but Draco doesn’t comment any further. They both know that isn’t entirely true. Perhaps Draco had embraced his new lifestyle more fully than others, but it was clear Slytherin house was getting a wake up call beyond himself.
When Draco dislocates his arm in third year he doesn’t expect Max to become so frantic. He’s never injured himself to this degree before, only the occasional bump and bruise from his Quidditch practice, and he’s never had to consider all the things one must do while recovering.
“Mr. Potter, I offered you a chance to tell me freely. You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Draco!” Umbridge suddenly turns to the blond and he hates how she says his first name. He hates it. Like they’re fucking friends. “Fetch Professor Snape.”
Draco blinks slowly over at the boy as he continues to ramble. He’d been doing a relatively good job keeping up until that last bit. Now he was more confused than before. “Hey, uh, you mind if I’m honest with you real quick?”
“I won’t do it for free. You understand, yes?” Draco says with an arched brow.
so much he’d demanded the continuation, which he only knew existed thanks to Max.
Sitting alone with Hermione felt familiar. This was usually how they spent their time, although it normally was at the Granger’s residence instead. It hardly made a difference, though, with how excited they both were.
“Did you get those files on Bagman, Draco?” twin two asks, smile as obnoxious as his brother’s.
“Ah, yes. Bartemius Crouch Junior,” Umbridge takes a sip of her tea, her eyes narrowing at some place beyond Draco. “To think that raving lunatic was anywhere near our youth for so long.”
“Among other things,” Draco tacks on, then looks to Eve, “Did you get any spoons?”
“Can I tell Ron and Hermione about Max?” Potter asks, voice deceptively calm that it takes a moment for Draco to realize what he’s asked.
“Easily. The Trace detects magic that occurs around the underage witch or wizard, not just the magic done by them.”
“The only hack reporter I can think of lurking around here is that Rita Skeeter chick,” Theodore pipes in, eying Pansy as Daphne picks up the Witch Weekly addition that had been abandoned.
” Potter makes the strangest, vaguest motions with his free hand, before pointing specifically at their hooked arms. “This! All of this. Just… We started off
Instead he stares at his feet, waiting for the Entrance Chamber to settle, tense from the atmosphere that still swirls around much like the walls. Draco can only think of one way to break it…
The hat is removed from Draco’s head and he is greeted by a very interesting response. The green table is clapping, louder than with all the other students that had been sorted into them, a few of the older students whooping like the Gryffindor table had done.
But how much would that matter when he couldn’t figure out where to go? What if he couldn’t find it? Would he not get to go to Hogwarts? Would his journey end so quickly because he had been too stubborn to ask for help?
“I’m being ridiculous? Oh, that’s rich, coming from the complete idiot that
“Excuse me?” Draco questions, not understanding the request or the reason behind Potter’s current presentation.
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
Hermione had also begun researching more advanced spells and potions. She loved getting ahead and was probably the brightest person Draco knew, so he wasn’t surprised. She didn’t cast anything, she would never while they were in the library, but she did wave her wand a couple times and mutter to herself. She took particular interest today in potions that took the place of complex spells.
