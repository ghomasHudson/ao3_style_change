Draco’s throat had dried up once more, words caught somewhere behind his tongue.  The man before him looked half-crazed, panting with emotion, and just watching him made Draco’s breathing speed up too.
Harry shook his head, as if that would make everything clear.  “Wait,” he said distractedly, “come in.  I have to….”
When they entered, Rosmerta was behind the counter, serving a very old man in bedraggled clothing.  Draco went up to greet her, and Rosmerta beamed as she caught sight of him.
“Fond memories, I’m sure.”  He didn’t even try to keep the bitterness from his voice.  All Harry ever talked about was the past, the one place Draco never wanted to think about.  Harry didn’t respond to that; he merely went back to frowning.
Draco stopped in his tracks to face Potter, crossing his arms again.  “How dare you assume I’m insulting my friend,” he snapped, as Potter stared at him in bewilderment.  “I say he should’ve been in Hufflepuff because he’s as loyal as they come, and he isn’t opposed to hard work.  Slytherin is for those ambitious and cunning enough to avoid ever working harder than absolutely necessary.  Even in our friendships.”  Draco shifted on his feet, suddenly uneasy with Potter’s all-too-knowing gaze.  “And he deserved better than us.”
“Time to go,” Parkinson insisted, waving her hand toward the far wall, which held a small fireplace.  “You’re welcome to use the Floo.”
The other man looked rather taken aback by Draco’s harsh tone.  “Er,” he said, ducking his head a bit, “Where am I, exactly?”
Harry shook his head as they walked toward the door.  “I don’t think it would look good to apologize with a drink in my hand.”
“I suppose you’re going to obsess over Blaise now,” Draco said conversationally, wincing as he thought about how Blaise would react to such a breach of decorum.
Something about Draco had changed, a release of tension somewhere, a loss of aggression making him look more vulnerable.  Whatever it was, Harry loved it.
Bulstrode’s eyes were so narrowed, Harry could hardly see them at all.  If she glared any harder, Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if they disappeared into her head.
And then Harry Potter had come back and saved him.  He could still feel Harry’s back against his own heaving chest, Draco’s thighs pressed tight to Harry’s own, the warm skin of Harry’s neck as Draco hid his face in it, thinking any second would be their last.
Harry wasn’t entirely sure why he was so unnerved by this development, but he didn’t bother to think about it too hard.  He had more important things to worry about, such as Draco and his apparent decline in health.  Or happiness, perhaps.  Either way, Harry had to fix it.  “I have to get going,” Harry told his friends, standing hastily as he gathered his coat.  “Work,” he added in way of explanation, and his friends nodded understandingly as he went.
“It’s not about dark wizards, Potter!” Draco exploded, only lowering his voice to a hiss when he saw people looking.  “It’s about belief,” he went on vehemently.  “Do you really think only ‘evil’ people believed in magical superiority?  Do you really think it’s that black and white?  Where do these ideas stem from, do you think?”  Draco’s eyes were dark and dangerous, and he was leaning toward Harry now, which was severely impacting Harry’s ability to concentrate on the other boy’s words.  “They come from places like Hogwarts.  Or your precious Ministry of Magic.”
Draco looked into his drink before Connor could catch him staring.  He couldn’t do it.  Not with Harry’s face burned into his retinas.
Draco narrowed his eyes at Potter’s expectant face.  “If I do,” he started cautiously, “will you leave me alone — for real this time?”
“Get out,” Parkinson demanded, not unkindly.  She still hadn’t moved from her place on the couch.  “Blaise is expecting you anyway.”
“It seems to me,” Connor ventured at last, “that you’re feeling super guilty about something you didn’t really have control over.”
does!  Sometimes I wonder how he’s even a wizard — he looks at maps instead of casting directional spells, and makes promises the muggle way that aren’t magically binding so he can go and break them without a second thought!  He makes you think you mean something to him for some reason, but then once you let your guard down for a
Connor, bless him, let that slide, and having paid for his book, brushed past Potter without looking at him.  “See you later, Draco,” he farewelled, shooting Draco his famous grin before exiting the shop.
“Aunt Petunia,” he blurted out, trying to keep any bitterness from his voice, “you need to take your family and leave now.  There’s no time to pack anything, just drive away as fast as you can and don’t come back.  There are wizards coming to kill us all.”
Ron had begun desperately scraping at his plate with his fork so as not to let any food go to waste, and the scratching was getting on Harry’s nerves.  Hermione waved her wand without looking away from Harry, and the sound was instantly muted.
Malfoy’s head snapped up, surprise written across his features, but he didn’t question Harry’s decision.  “Less than fifteen minutes, I’d wager,” he breathed.
“Alright, alright, laugh it up,” Potter sighed, and Draco was surprised at how lighthearted he sounded.  If they were back in school, this exchange would’ve been enough to start a fight.  With a start, Draco realized just how long it had been since they’d last seen each other.  It had been a little over three years since Draco’s trial, where Potter had spoken in his defense and was instrumental in getting Draco and his mother greatly reduced sentences.  He only had to serve one year’s house arrest — which turned into eight months for good behavior — and his mother had only served two years house arrest — surprisingly without good behavior.  Mother was always used to having her way, and it seemed house arrest didn’t suit her very well.  Draco was only glad she didn’t get a worse punishment for trying to leave the manor grounds as much as she did.
Harry shook his head, becoming more concerned by the second.  “Is he ill?” he demanded, leaning towards Parkinson as if that would provide him the answer.  “Is he taking care of himself?  Is he eating?”
Potter smiled big, and Draco scowled at him.  “Yes,” Potter confirmed.  “That would be lovely, thank you.”
“I’m helping with the Hogwarts Unity event this year,” he said, trying to mask his besotted tone.  “I think you’d be a great speaker there.”
“‘And but one word with one of us?’” Draco muttered.  “‘Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.’”
Those couldn’t be the last words Draco Malfoy ever said to him.  They kept ringing in Harry’s ears, a chorus of “you failed” repeating over and over.  What had he done wrong?  Harry had been careful to make it more personal this time, more obviously about Malfoy and not about him.  And maybe he’d screwed that up a bit, with bringing up things Malfoy didn’t want to think about, but then he’d apologized again and even made Malfoy laugh.  For a while, it was almost like talking with a friend.  Until Malfoy flat-out refused to accept Harry’s apology.  Harry had to try again.
Harry rolled his eyes, not letting Draco’s lack of enthusiasm diminish his good mood.  “I survived Flint,” he said dismissively.  “I’m sure I can handle a bit of foul language.”
“Daphne Greengrass,” Draco announced decisively when Harry took too long to answer, and grabbed Potter’s arm to apparate them.  Draco wasn’t exactly thrilled to see the Greengrasses again, but they were surprisingly nice and welcoming to their guests, and from the look on Harry’s face after their encounter with the Flints, Draco decided he needed that.
“Bye, Blaise Zabini,” Harry mumbled, still sitting, and Blaise smiled indulgently at him before slipping silently from the room.
Millicent Bulstrode hadn’t been in very high spirits when Harry had ambushed her at her job in an unassuming muggle pub.  “Do all your mates work at pubs?” Harry had asked Draco, who had scoffed but not bothered to answer.  He’d almost asked if all Draco’s mates liked muggles now, but the question seemed insensitive, so he kept his mouth shut.  He didn’t fancy Draco storming off on him again.  It’d been hard enough to get him to tolerate Harry for
Draco tried not to feel too pleased at Harry’s reaction, but there it was in his chest, like a smug cat, only rivaled by the horror that Harry might think Draco agreed with her twisted views.
Norwood Road was home to a number of quaint shops and restaurants, and Harry idly wondered which ones, if any, Malfoy visited.  If he squinted into all the windows, would he see that white-blonde hair peeking over a shelf or from behind a menu?
Harry shrugged, rubbing his forehead with his hand to relieve some stress.  “I don’t know,” he admitted.  “He’d said in a few days.”
Harry didn’t think those were the most accurate descriptors, seeing as before Crabbe had died, he’d quarreled with Draco about killing Harry and cast Fiendfyre in spite of Draco’s orders, but he supposed for most of Crabbe’s life he had been loyal to his friends.  Don’t speak ill of the dead, and all.  Besides, judging Crabbe’s character wasn’t why Harry had come.
“Well,” Harry said uncertainly, “alright, I guess. Er, well, you know Draco?” he started and immediately wanted to ht hiimself in the head.
“Greg,” Draco announced, and his friend jumped, straightening up to face him.  “I’m sorry to bother you at work.”
“Great,” Draco went on.  “You owe me.”  The moment those words left Draco’s mouth he regretted them fiercely.  No one owed Draco anything, not after the war.  Especially not the savior of the wizarding world, who had saved him from fiendfyre, and a life in azkaban.  This man, whom Draco had tormented all growing up, owed him nothing.  If anything, Draco should be begging forgiveness at his feet.
rather pathetic,” Pansy allowed, daintily sipping from her teacup.  Tiny blue-painted birds flew across the ceramic as she set it down.  “But sweet, too.”
“I knew it!” Ron crowed, earning some stares from the other customers.  “That slimy git, what did he say — ow!”  He abruptly turned to Hermione to give her a sour look and it was clear that Hermione had kicked him under the table.
To prevent further rudeness, Draco opted to speak for him.  “Do we have any maps, Doctor?  Potter has somehow lost his way.”
Draco stopped walking and faced Harry, dropping his arm.  Harry missed the warmth of his hand.  “What?” Draco said.
Malfoy swiveled on his heel and marched off down the street.  Harry knew better than to chase after him again, but he still felt the need to explain himself.  This was going all wrong.  “I didn’t mean it like that!” he shouted, hoping to get through to the Slytherin.  “It
While most of the other portraits were either bored or asleep, Snape was watching Harry back inscrutably. Dumbledore’s portrait however was currently blank. He must be in his portrait at the ministry, or at Aberforth’s pub. Harry sorely wished he would return, if only to nod hello. Something churned in Harry’s belly, some need for wisdom that only Dumbledore could ever provide. What would he say about Draco? Would he approve?
“Yeah, but,” Ron replied, sounding resigned but woeful, “there’s loads of blokes who’d be into Harry.  Charlie’s gay, what about him?”
Ros began wiping at the counter with a rag that looked like it was dirtier than what it was supposed to be cleaning.  “That’s because you don’t usually look quite so murderous.”
Draco rolled his eyes, something only Draco could pull off with poise.  “Scared, Potter?” he taunted, but his tone was light.  “I’ll be right behind you,” he added in what was almost a reassuring voice if it weren’t for the mocking smirk, his hand ghosting over Harry’s lower back as he urged him forward.  Even through the material of his shirt, Harry’s skin prickled where Draco’s hand came near.
Harry beamed, then bit his lips like he was trying not to smile but the smiling was winning out anyway.  “Anything you need,” he said, and he backed up a few paces, leaving room for Draco to pass him.  “I’ll see you around, Draco.”  He said Draco’s name like a promise.  Like an unbreakable vow.
myself from the wizarding community — and expect me to welcome you with open arms after your neat little apology that, in your own words, had nothing to do with
The truth dawned on his face slowly, like a sun rising over the horizon and pouring light across the landscape.  Potter looked petrified.  It was spectacular.  “Oh Merlin, I didn’t realize – how can I – is there anything I can — ”
Draco watched his throat swallowing it down with disinterest.  A week ago that might have been attractive but now he felt too distanced.  “I don’t know.  I shouldn’t.  He’s a tosser.”
“How wonderful,” Draco bit out, tempted to slam his book about shamans down on Dr. Finch’s desk.  As it was, he just set it down gently.  Even as furious as he felt, Draco was loathe to harm a book.  Dr. Finch shot him a look over her reading glasses as if he had.
There was some movement within the flat, and a couple unintelligible voices, before the door was flung open and Pansy Parkinson stood in its place, appraising Harry with raised brows.  Harry couldn’t tell if she was surprised or bored.
Draco turned back to his strange, tipsy companion.  “It’s late,” Draco declared, crossing his arms just so he had something to do with his hands.  “I’m not taking you to anyone else tonight.”
,” she told him, somewhat defensively.  “Just a little bummed out.”  She glanced at Hermione next to her, who gave her a sympathetic smile.
Vernon huffed in his unhappy way, and Harry heard the tell-tale signs of him struggling to get up from his couch seat.
“Draco,” Dr. Finch called after a moment, and his stomach dropped.  “Could you help this young man find what he’s looking for?”
It's been a while…. Sorry! I'm still aiming to give this the ending it deserves. Life gets in the way sometimes. Enjoy. :)
Blaise nodded graciously, turning to lead them out into the hall, occasionally smiling at someone or other as they vacated the main room.  Out of the corner of Draco’s eye, he could see Harry looking askance at him, a puzzled expression on his face.  Was it just Potter, or were all Gryffindors that rubbish at hiding their emotions?
But what could he do?  He was barely sixteen, he had no access to the wizarding world’s news, and Dumbledore had made him promise to stay put with his horrible aunt and uncle.  If he couldn’t trust Dumbledore’s judgement, who
Maybe Draco should just snog Connor and get it over with.  It was perfect; Connor wouldn’t be sticking around anyway.
When McGonagall finished speaking she looked at Harry closely, awaiting his response. Harry swallowed, conflicted. “Why…why didn’t I know about her?” he asked at last.
Only slightly panicked, Draco skittered back to Dr. Finch, and gestured that Connor was her problem now, but before he could turn tail and flee from this mess of a situation, Connor stopped him with a light touch on his elbow.  Swallowing, Draco faced him again.
“Adventure?” Draco suggested as he halted before the classics section.  “Historical?  Science fiction?  Romance?”
“No,” Harry rushed, “no, of course not.”  He frowned again, which then somehow morphed into a smile.  “It’s just, you act different around him.  Like the Malfoys I remember.”
Potter blinked a few times behind his round glasses, looking even more like an idiot than usual.  “Malfoy,” he repeated stupidly, “Why are you here?”
Dr. Finch’s eyes sparkled at the praise as she held her hand out.  Potter took her hand and shook it, though he looked mildly mortified by the comment about his wizard robes.  “Pleasure to meet you,” Dr. Finch said politely.
“I’m alright,” Draco replied, attempting to smooth out his expression.  From the concerned look on Connor’s face, it wasn’t working.  “I just….”
“Scotland,” Draco answered shortly.  It was too much effort to be nice to Potter for long, and Draco found himself gradually slipping back into his usual disinterested demeanor.
Draco let out a chuckle, imagining how Mill would take it if Harry apologized to her while seemingly drunk.  She’d probably break the bottle over his head.
“You always say that,” Draco replied, trying valiantly to soften his expression for her, “but you never do.”
“Er,” Harry replied, wracking his brains for anything he’d done that might have led to this situation.
“Well, I’m – I’m sorry for all the animosity between our Houses,” Harry managed to stutter out.  “I hope there’s no bad blood between us.”
leading either of them on — but Connor swooped in to save him from replying.  “We’ll see you later, Dr. Finch,” he said genially, holding the door open.
Giving Dr. Finch a withering look, Draco turned and stomped over to the second row of shelves, Potter following along behind him.  “This is the section on health.  I trust you can browse on your own.”  Draco made to leave, but Potter blocked his path.
There wasn’t a headstone for Tom Riddle.  Perhaps if Dumbledore had still been alive, there would’ve been, but out of the few people who still remembered the boy separate from the monster he had become, none had asked for a gravestone.  Voldemort would be remembered in the pages of history, but he no longer had a place on this earth.
Draco felt somewhat offended for a moment, until Connor waggled his eyebrows comically.  “Of course he is, what do you take me for?” Draco said, acting appalled.  But then he felt like he was coming off wrong.  “But really, that’s not why I… like him.”  It was too weird to say the word ‘love’ out loud.  Even to this guy who Draco would never talk to again.
Draco stared at Harry for a long moment.  That was not the sort of insightful comment he expected to come from Potter’s mouth.  He hadn’t even realized Harry had noticed Greg at all in school.  It wasn’t like they’d even spoken to each other before.  But there was something in Harry’s eyes now that was far too understanding of Draco’s insecurities, and Draco had to break eye contact with him and resume their walk to the pub.
Dr. Finch lifted her gaze from her Latin text and studied his face.  “Take the day off, dear,” she said.  “You needn’t be overhasty.”
Blaise, chivalrous as he was, didn’t argue with Harry’s assessment.  “It’s very kind of you to go out of your way to tell me all that,” he commended.  “I appreciate your time.”  Blaise always was the most diplomatic of Draco’s friends.
Draco flipped the card over.  It was presumably Connor’s number, and Draco blushed thinking how a few years ago he wouldn’t have known how to operate a telephone.  “I’ll check my schedule,” Draco replied, giving Connor a wink of his own.
Snape had his eyes on him again, that penetrating gaze staring right through him. Harry repressed a shiver. Snape may still be a bit creepy, but he was a good man.
With a last lingering look at Draco, who appeared terribly bored, Harry approached the heavyset man sweeping the floors.  “Nott,” Harry began hesitantly, stopping in front of him, “I’d like to apologize.”
Draco shook his head adamantly.  “No, I’m coming back, I most certainly am not wasting my day with that abominable wiz—
“As am I,” Draco replied.  It was true: talking with Connor had definitely cleared things up in his mind.  “Have a good flight.”
“Harry here was just asking where he could find you,” Dr. Finch said, either not noticing that Draco was upset with her or not caring.  Knowing Dr. Finch, it was probably the latter.
Dr. Finch snorted, startling Draco from his thoughts.  “You’re worse than I was at your age,” she told him, looking amused.
“Well,” Hermione went on carefully like she was trying not to startle him, “maybe he’s been waiting for you to contact him.”
Filch glanced at Harry with immense distain before seemingly deciding to ignore him and turning to face McGonagall. “Headmistress,” he croaked, “there are third-year students duelling in the 5th floor corridor.”
“Correct,” Draco agreed brusquely.  “Now, for the most part — excepting the Lovegoods probably — no one considers animals to be on the same level as humans.  The same sort of ideology exists when we study muggles.  It’s all about how much
“What does that mean?” Harry asked, bewildered.  “I’m an auror, I know there are still dark wizards, but – ”
“I hope so,” Harry said, and with that he pushed past his uncle and slid his wand back into his pocket.  Behind him, he could hear the huffing of his uncle as he returned to the living room.  He couldn’t be bothered by his extended family however, not when Ron was at the door waiting to take him back to the wizarding world, hopefully for good.
“Potter?” Malfoy questioned perplexedly.  He brought a hand to smooth over his hair, as if a strand were out of place, and then elegantly placed both hands into his pockets.  “Whatever are you doing here?”
,” she hissed, aghast, no longer smiling as she clutched her champagne glass tightly.  It was a good look on her: bitter and disgusted.
ridiculous!  Dumbledore had done everything he could to protect muggles from people like Voldemort.  How could Malfoy say all that with a straight face?  “You’re one to talk,” Harry spat.  “You never did anything except what your father told you.”
smarter than he is — because animals can sense danger and Potter bloody well can’t.  Most people, as you previously suggested, would run when they see me glaring daggers at them — but
tell her what he really thought about Potter, because maybe then he wouldn’t keep thinking about the prat.
After a moment, she sighed and nodded, patting his hand before they both leaned back in their seats to continue their dinner.
“You’re taking him home with you?” Lavender giggled, her and Parkinson smirking at each other.  Harry made a valiant effort to remain unfazed.
Hermione sighed, looking at Ron for help.  “Mate,” Ron cut in as Harry frowned at them, “you kind of have a habit of bothering Malfoy.”
Draco couldn’t listen to anymore of this, so he loudly stomped over to them.  Rosmerta was unflappable as usual but Harry started guiltily, and tried to pretend they had been discussing various weather patterns.  “Greg will be out in a moment,” Draco informed him curtly.
Beyond the gate was a mile-long dirt driveway that led up to a mansion which, if possible for a mansion, looked rather quaint.  The mansion was a soft cream-yellow color, like diffused sunlight, with sky blue highlights along the edges that wavered like a mirage.  It made the whole building appear to shimmer like an illusion on the perfectly manicured grass.  The sun was quite warm here, with no clouds in sight, and the entire estate was exceedingly welcoming.  Without them even having to knock or otherwise announce their presence, the gates parted to let them in.  Draco wasn’t sure if they’d been manually allowed in by the sisters, or if the wards were set to always let him in.  Astoria could be sweet, and luckily much less exuberant when it came to Daphne’s ideals, but both sisters put Draco on edge.  Possibly because they were constantly trying to seduce him.
“You’ve changed a lot since school,” was what Harry said in his defense.  “I want to know who you are
Draco struggled not to roll his eyes at the obvious statement.  “Then why are you bothering me at work again, Potter?” he growled instead.  “I thought I made myself clear.”
Mock-pouting, Lavender obliged, and left them to themselves as she went off to the kitchen.  Parkinson gestured to a comfortable-looking chair across from a couch, and he gladly took a seat.  It was cozy and the flat was wonderfully warm, so Harry gratefully shucked his coat.
, we don’t have time for this.  They’re coming.”  The blonde was frantic, eyes flitting around like he expected someone to apparate here and grab him.  Now that Harry got a good look at him, he could see that Malfoy’s skin was paler than normal, a sort of sickly green hue tinting his face.  His hands were quaking at his sides.  And his eyes.  Those silvery eyes were so afraid.  Malfoy had never been a good actor.  He couldn’t fake that.
“Pansy, let me in,” Draco’s voice filtered in through the door, but he didn’t sound too hopeful, and Parkinson ignored him, turning instead to usher Harry further into the flat.  Being alone with Parkinson was suddenly making Harry much more anxious than when he knew Draco was there next to him.
Not the least of which with Draco himself, who seemed to be getting colder by the minute, his frown cutting into that seraphic face of his.  Harry desperately wanted to smooth it out with his fingers.  He didn’t dare.
And yet… he kept agreeing to see Harry.  He came on this last minute date with him — well, not a date, just a… truce.  He could’ve stormed out the minute things got heated.  Why didn’t he?
He looked at the names as he passed, trying to remember who they were.  Tarquin Travers, one of them read.  Augustine Selwyn, another.  These names meant nothing to him.  No face came to mind, nothing but indistinct sneers.  He went through each row, all of them dull and undistinguished.  There was no indication of rank or wealth.  No family plots or extravagant arrangements.  At last, he passed one he did recognize: Bellatrix Lestrange.
“We really haven’t,” Draco told him earnestly, and nearly said “Harry” at the end of that, but snapped his mouth shut just in time.
Malfoy let out a growl of frustration, and for a moment, Harry thought Malfoy had lost all patience — he was going to punch him, or drag him outside,
Anything except the fact that he’d been apparating into muggle London for the last week trying to catch a glimpse of blonde hair through a bookshop window while hiding under his invisibility cloak.
Nothing was wrong.  He had no idea what his best friends were talking about.  Everything would go on like normal.
Potter wiped his expression clean as he faced Draco, stuffing his hands in his pockets.  “Alright, well,” he started hesitantly, “I know I said things all wrong last time.  So I’m sorry for that.”  Potter paused and bit his lip.
They were both staring at him determinedly and Harry frowned.  “You two aren’t going to let this go, are you?”
Draco whimpered in response, hugging Harry tighter with his right arm and nestling his face into the crook of Harry’s neck.  It made Harry so scared.  He would give anything for a biting remark or recycled insult.  Anything to prove Draco was alright, that he was back to his old self.  Suddenly, Draco’s right arm loosened, his body going slack, and Harry could feel him sliding sideways off the broom.  Before he could fall completely, Harry twisted around and clutched the front of Draco’s robes in his fist, yanking him around to the front of Harry’s body.  Wrapping an arm around Draco’s limp form, he steadied the broom with the other.
“Forgive me,” Draco said, shoving the note into his pocket and straightening up to a dignified height.  “I have to go meet that boy I was telling you about.”
Huffing in exasperation, Parkinson sat down next to Hermione, forcing Ron and Hermione to squeeze to the other end of the bench, even though there was more room beside Harry.  “I don’t know why you’re friends with such an idiot, Granger,” she remarked dryly, snagging a chip off Harry’s plate.
,” Harry said, trying to lighten the mood, but that just caused all three of the others to give him disappointed looks.
,” Draco groused, feeling like a child, but too miserable to care.  “I’d rather shag Voldemort than spend another
With a parting grin, Connor left the shop, the bell on the door ringing behind him as it closed.  Draco smiled after him, feeling lighter for having unloaded his boy troubles onto the surprisingly understanding American, and especially after that night at the bar with Harry.  As disastrous as it had seemed, he hadn’t wanted to go home at the end of the night.  At least not without Harry coming with him.
Harry met Draco’s slightly startled gaze, feeling rather pleased with his response.  After a quiet moment, Draco prompted lazily, “Yes, go on.”
“I mean,” Hermione said suddenly, and Harry looked up to see her worried expression was back in place, “it really isn’t that funny.  If you say he’s changed, Harry, we believe you.”
It was dim and dusty inside the shop, and there was a single customer in the back corner being tended to by the presumable Mr. Batworthy.  Harry couldn’t tell if the customer was even human or not; there was so much thick black hair coming out of its head, it was impossible to see if the thing had limbs or humanoid body parts at all.  For all he could tell, the creature was all hair.  The only way he could surmise it was actually a customer, and not some creepy wig statue, was the fact that it was swaying back and forth and babbling on in some lyrical foreign language.
Glancing around, Harry popped open his mostly packed trunk and tossed in a couple textbooks he’d been leafing through, and his favorite quill and ink, before snapping it closed again and setting it beside his bunk.  He hardly unpacked while staying at number four, Privet Drive, and so there wasn’t much to prepare.  Presumably, Ron would come up and help him carry everything, since neither of them could use magic yet, so Harry left it all there and bounded down out of his room and down the stairs, eager to see his best mate again.
Dr. Finch would’ve saved that woman too.  How could he stand here and pretend he was worthy of these heroes?  He wasn’t like them.  He was just a boy without a spine.  If he couldn’t stand up for what was right back then when it had mattered, how could he claim to have changed now the danger was passed?  If Dr. Finch knew him back then, would she be talking to him today?  He’d never wanted to reveal the wizarding world to her so badly as he did right then, when the words to explain his predicament failed him.
Draco froze, gaze fixed on a battered dart board across from them.  Harry had never been that direct before.  Neither of them had.  It was like a soft, soothing melody curling up in Draco’s ears.  It was dangerous.
He rushed back to where he’d left Malfoy in the hall.  The other boy seemed even more agitated inside; he was hugging his arms loosely, and his eyes kept darting to the windows and door.  His lower lip was trapped between his teeth.
The other man looked impatient with Harry’s slow response.  “First Greg, now Pansy?” he clarified grumpily.  “What’s going on here?”
The air was chilling in Hogsmeade, having less shelter than the London streets they’d come from, and Harry longed to be indoors by a fireside, perhaps with a cup of hot tea and a temperamental blonde beside him.  “I would like to apologize to Pansy, if you would kindly escort me to her door,” Harry told Draco earnestly, watching as the other man’s brow furrowed even more, and his crossed arms tightened.
“Maybe,” Hermione began in a tone that suggested she was about to provide an obvious and fool-proof solution to all their problems, “you should owl him, Harry, and ask him if he wants to meet you?”
“I don’t know what sort of pureblood game you’re playing at,” Harry spat out, clearly no longer impressed by Daphne or her enchanted home, “but Draco isn’t your plaything.  So stop harassing him, and — you know what? — apology retracted.  You’re as bad as I
“You’re mad,” the blonde replied, and Harry didn’t miss the way his eyes followed one of the droplets of ale down Harry’s chin before waving his wand to dry Harry off.
“Thank you,” Draco said politely.  He glanced around the tiny shop, and chose an aisle at random, walking down it in wonder.  There were so many books, old books, just sitting there around him — so many words, so much knowledge — and the realization of that filled him with awe.  He could learn so much, about muggle culture, muggle religion, muggle everything, and it could push out all the unwanted thoughts, the dark memories that he tried so hard to suppress.  Draco walked back to the woman’s desk, knowing he would have to leave soon anyway.  She was still there, inspecting a giant encyclopedia from the 1800s.  It was in French.
“Potter,” Draco started, an almost-concerned expression on his face, “perhaps you should reconsider.”
“I could do with a romance,” Connor said quietly, then stepped back to give Draco space.  “What’s your pick?”
As soon as the word was out of Harry’s mouth, the woman — Davis? Tracey Davis? — began guffawing along with Flint, nearly falling over but steadying herself on Flint’s shoulder.  “What a ponce!” she cried, as they laughed against each other.
Not that Draco ever wanted Potter to follow him.  Certainly not the last time they met and Draco had stormed off only to realize Potter hadn’t tried to chase after him and apologize again.  That was preposterous.  Draco had more self-respect than that.
, he could — if he just closed the space between them.  Maybe dragged his fingers over those sharp cheekbones.  Caressed his jaw.
“Give me a happy ending,” Connor said seductively, and Draco almost stumbled over his words as he agreed.
“Up yours,” was all Nott said in reply.  The words were laced with venom, and Nott’s movements were stiff, but he didn’t seem to be overly aggressive.  Harry’s mischievous side was starting to show.
This whole conversation was making Draco feel awkward and unbalanced.  And it didn’t help that images of Potter kept popping into his head, and that he kept worrying Potter might stop by while he was out.  Would he wait around for Draco, or would he give up and leave?  Did Draco even want to see him?
“Yes, there is something you could do,” Draco interrupted coldly.  “You can leave me alone and never bother me again and live with the knowledge that I will never forgive you.”
“I still wish Harry had chosen someone other than Malfoy,” Ron was saying, presumably around a bite of food due to the muffling of his words.
“It’s not about the same thing so it doesn’t count,” Harry cut him off hastily.  “I’m just sorry that I didn’t get back to you sooner.  I wasn’t sure how much space you needed so I opted for longer.”
“Thanks,” Potter mumbled, following Draco down the street to The Dragon’s Lair.  When they reached the bookstore, Potter — predictably — snorted.  “You have a —?”
It wasn’t fair.  Draco hadn’t asked for this.  He’d done his time, he’d moved away to the muggle world to do something harmless, and this is what he got.  Shame crept in and pressed down on him like the rotting hands of dementors.  “Leave me alone, Potter,” he tried to growl, but it came out closer to a whimper.  He turned back the way they’d come.
Bloody Potter.  With his stupid bloody scar, and his ridiculously unkempt hair, and his bloody awful glasses.  What a prat.  Always expecting everything in life to be handed to him, even forgiveness.  It was such bullocks.
“She was brilliant,” Dr. Finch went on, ignoring Draco’s comment.  “And gorgeous, of course.  She had this insanely curly black hair that she wore in dreadlocks, and black-framed glasses.  Her eyes were the color of coffee — not quite black, but almost there.”  Dr. Finch sighed dreamily, and it was a side of her that Draco had never seen before.  “She had a PhD in astrophysics.  She had to work so much harder than any white man to get it, too.  Moved to the U.S. to work for NASA.”
Draco huffed a laugh, a grating, humourless sound that resembled a sob more than mirth.  “If you think that, you’re delusional.  The only difference between now and then is that now everything’s invisible, just under the surface, waiting for an opportunity to rise up again.”
“Yes,” Draco rushed to say before Harry could respond, “and you’re an elitist snob with no friends.”  Arguably not the best comeback for a twenty-one year old, but at least Harry would know where he stood.
,” Daphne suggested, her voice dropping to a lower volume.  She brushed her fingers against his wrist as he tried to skirt around her.  “Merlin knows we can’t waste
Dr. Finch smiled back with what would have been a sympathetic expression if not for the mischievous glint in her eye.  “Harry,” she greeted, “I’m certainly glad to see you again.”
Harry stared at her, mouth hanging open.  “Oh Hermione, you’re brilliant!” he cried, leaping up from his seat and leaning across the table to give her a sort of half-hug.
“Fine, you uncouth gorilla,” Draco snapped, stopping in his tracks and turning to face the other man.  “Sober up and apologize.”
“Well,” Ron said casually, as if they weren’t discussing his least favorite person in the world.  “You apologized then.  How did it go?”
“With Draco?” Parkinson asked incredulously.  “Of course not.  Lavender?” she called, and Harry startled as Lavender Brown strolled into the room.
“There’s open rooms upstairs if you need,” Greg offered solemnly, and Draco’s cheeks flamed at the implication.  Ros chuckled from across the room, and Greg preened at her attention.  Draco was going to murder him later.
in his eyes?  Draco felt anger boiling up inside him as he ripped the map open and jabbed his finger at a spot on Norwood Road.  “We’re here,” he forced out through gritted teeth, and jabbed his finger at a different spot.  “This is the closest entrance to the Ministry.  Now go.”
“Of course it’s about you,” Harry muttered to the empty air, and then shook his head like that would rid his brain of stupidity.  He hadn’t even apologized for the
Parkinson sat back in consideration, popping the chip into her mouth.  “You really don’t know, do you?” she said thoughtfully as she chewed.
Ron grabbed his plate, shoving past Harry on his way to the sink.  Once the plate was added to the set of self-washing dishes, he turned back to face Harry, slightly more composed.  “You’re better than him, Harry,” he said, sounding disappointed.  “You don’t have to apologize to him for anything.”
Ron snorted again, reminding everyone of his presence, and muttered, “I’d say he’s more than fond of you, mate,” before Hermione elbowed him harshly in the side.  Ron exclaimed in pain as Parkinson looked on with a faintly amused smile.
Blaise considered him for a moment, and it seemed like he was taking Harry seriously for the first time.  “Have you apologized to Draco?”
name — it had just slipped out in his anger — but at least Harry hadn’t seemed to notice.  Harry would’ve never let
“Still discussing Harry, are we?” Lavender ventured, taking Pansy’s hand in her own and twining their fingers together.
Draco’s tongue flicked out, just for a second, and wet his bottom lip.  His eyes were still closed.  Draco swallowed, and Harry’s eyes followed the motion all the way down his throat before jumping back up to his lips.  Without really thinking about it, Harry took a small step forward, so that Draco was only about a foot away.  Draco looked so vulnerable, leaned up against the brick wall of the alley, and Harry wanted nothing more than to keep him safe, to wrap him up in his arms, and to brush his hair from his face and to —
Harry couldn’t let Malfoy die for him.  It wasn’t right.  They were enemies, they were supposed to fight each other not die for each other.  It was ridiculous, nonsensical.
They ended up going to a pub a few blocks away that Draco had never been to before.  It was fairly clean, and not many people were there, but enough to have company.  Draco was glad for that; he was worried they would go somewhere close-quartered and intimate.  The only person he wanted to be close to and intimate with was Harry Potter — and that wasn’t about to happen any time soon.  Or ever.
“Potter was praising my abilities in charms,” Parkinson went on, a twinkle in her eye as she flashed a smile at Harry.  He returned it warily.
“Oh, come on, Draco,” Parkinson drawled.  “There’s plenty of room.”  She seemed to be gesturing towards the seat Harry was currently on, a chair with decidedly no room for more than one person, unless Draco were to sit on Harry’s lap.  The thought was hurriedly dismissed, but not before Harry considered what Draco’s face might look like if he unexpectedly yanked him down onto his lap right then.  And how it would feel to support Draco’s lean frame, Harry’s arms wrapped securely around Draco’s narrow hips.
Inside, Dr. Finch sat behind her desk as usual, eyeglasses on as she surveyed an old Greek text.  Dr. Finch was a linguist, and she was fluent in eight different spoken languages, as well as several dead languages, including Greek.  She looked up as they came in.  “Draco,” she said warmly, “you’ve brought a friend.”
“Wait, if this is a muggle street,” Potter said loudly, rudely interrupting Draco’s thoughts, “what are you doing here?”
“I’m glad we could help, Harry. We’ll be here,” Dumbledore added cheekily, “if you need us. Now go, I believe you have plans to make.”
Smoothing out his shirt and hair, Draco straightened up and made his way to the front, heart beating out of his chest.  His palms were incurably sweaty, and he kept having to wipe them surreptitiously on his trousers.  He hoped he didn’t look as keyed up as he felt.  Draco took a deep breath, shaking his head at the stupidity of it all.  There was no need for all this anxiety; it was only Potter.
All three of them jumped, Ron letting out a startled “Merlin!” before turning to gape at Parkinson.  The woman in question was glaring right at Harry.
, Potter,” Draco grumbled after his scowls and eye rolls didn’t do the trick.  “You asked to come here, don’t blame me.”
Swallowing, Draco struggled to find his voice.  “But not Blaise’s?” he asked.  He sounded rough and scratchy, and he willed his voice to be stronger.  “He doesn’t matter?”  That was better, more authority.
Harry shook his head to clear his thoughts.  Malfoy wasn’t his problem anymore.  It was Voldemort he had to worry about now.  After the death of his godfather, Harry wasn’t willing to lose anyone else to the machinations of Tom Riddle.  He couldn’t wait out the summer like this again, just sitting for months while Voldemort was out there.  He needed to act.
Draco nudged him, and Harry looked up to see that Draco was making an impatient gesture towards the other side of the shop.  Sure enough, Theodore Nott was there, sweeping up loose hairs into small piles.  The more he swept, the more dirt and hair he seemed to find.  Not to mention that Mr. Batworthy’s current client was shedding copiously — and yet still so ensconced in the wiry hair that Harry would be shocked if it was human.  Even as Mr. Batworthy cut off locks of the stuff, it seemed to grow back instantly to the same length.  The two seemed unperturbed by this detail, as Batworthy continued trimming and the creature continued burbling away in his melodic tongue.  Harry briefly wondered if Batworthy could understand the odd language — it was definitely not a human one — but then Draco nudged him again, and Harry refocused on the task at hand.
“Yeah,” Draco said, hating how weak he sounded.  “Yes,” he said again, trying to regain some level of dignity, “but not tonight.  And not tomorrow.  Give me a break.  I do have a job, you know.”
Harry forced himself not to keep talking, even as the dragging silence strained his patience.  He kept meeting Malfoy’s dark gaze then glancing away, as if he might find an answer written there but was too embarrassed to look for long.  A thousand ideas bubbled to the front of his mind about what to say, but Harry clamped his mouth shut, determined to let Malfoy have the next word.  The blonde before him could be a statue but for the light breeze shifting the pale strands of his hair.  Harry was biting his tongue, dying to ask what the other boy was thinking, when Malfoy suddenly raised an eyebrow, and just like that he was a living person again, chest rising and falling with each breath, posture shifting as he put his weight on one leg then the other.
Parkinson’s eyes were becoming less and less friendly with each passing second, and Harry got to his feet, feeling increasingly out of place.  “You’re sure?” he asked, taking a step toward the fireplace.
Malfoy stiffened, stopping in his tracks and whirling on Harry.  The glare Malfoy gave him could kill.  “
Hermione sighed.  “And Charlie is wonderful, but he spends all his time with dragons.  I don’t think Harry’s particularly fond of those since fourth year.  Even the Gringrotts one made him jumpy.”
“One minute,” Harry insisted, clutching onto Malfoy’s cloak in turn and dragging him into the house, Aunt Petunia’s hardwood floors be damned.
Heaving a great sigh, Draco turned to the entrance of the shop and braced himself to deal with Harry Potter.  The drizzle had petered out, to Draco’s relief, but the air was still chilly, and Draco crossed his arms to keep warm.  Potter was standing to the side of the door, and he grinned at Draco as he stepped up beside him.
“Harry?” she asked, grinning unrestrainedly.  She jogged over and swept Harry up in a hug, which he returned.  “Why are you here?” she asked amiably.  “Draco isn’t around.”
Harry crossed his arms on the threshold, unsure what was happening but not willing to go along without an explanation.  “I’m not going anywhere with you,
Harry stopped with the aimless twirling and gripped the handle, pointing it in his uncle’s ugly mug.  “I think I’ll say what I want.  Wouldn’t you agree?”
“Hello, Millicent,” he began, and the girl was definitely not pleased by the use of her first name.  The hand not holding a platter of drinks was in a fist against her waist.  Her pitch black hair that that was pulled up in a loose bun looked about as desperate to run away from her as Harry was in that instant.
Draco groaned and broke off his stare with the gorgeous Connor to glare at the horrible Potter.  “What now, you prat?” he growled, supremely embarrassed that Connor had to witness this scene.
He was still there, staring at Harry with a coalescence of frustration and sympathy on his face.  He hastily schooled his features when he saw Harry watching.  “I see,” he said blandly.  Neither made a move for a tense moment.  Draco’s fingers twitched, like he wanted to reach out to Harry.  Harry hoped he did.  “I didn’t finish my drink,” Draco said instead, with a cool look at Harry.
Draco looked ethereal in the dim lighting at their booth, all white-gold skin and carefully styled hair in a striking emerald button-up.  The only thing marring him was the sneer he wore on his face, and even that seemed lovely somehow.
Harry narrowed his eyes at them, but they both just waited for him to answer, so Harry assumed they must have discussed being more careful about the topic of Malfoy around him.  “I did.  It went…about as bad as is to be expected.”
“So I apologized again,” Harry went on cautiously, “but he keeps getting pissed that I’m apologizing at all.”
Draco’s gaze slid back to his, and Harry had to repress a shiver.  His sneer was back in place.  “I’m not interested in discussing the mental capacity of your… best mate.”
Ron and Hermione shared a look.  “Well, normally it is,” Hermione hedged, “but is that really why you’re doing this?”
“Good, you seem to be more emotionally invested than that,” she said, getting to her feet with the silent grace of a cat.
Dr. Finch let out a snort.  “Only for a little while,” she told him, eyes twinkling.  “I fell in love after that, never felt the same about a girl again.”
“And you’re cold,” Harry said pointedly, not bothering to argue.  Draco’s coat was thinner than Harry’s, and he desperately wanted to drape his around the other’s shoulders, but no-doubt that would be taken as an attack of some sort.
Rosmerta gave him a stern look, completely ignoring his famous companion, which made Draco even more fond of her.  “You’re not going to cause a scene in my pub, are you, Draco?”
Draco gawked at him.  “Do you hear yourself, Potter?” he asked incredulously.  “That’s precisely what you did to me!”
When Draco was released, his mother insisted he get a position at the Ministry, but Draco knew that wasn’t going to happen.  For one, no sane person in the magical community would hire an ex-Death Eater.  But for another, Draco didn’t want to go back to how things were before, where the Malfoys were both feared and hated, and only a very few members of society thought them respectable.  He wanted to be invisible, as if he was wearing Potter’s famous cloak, and he wanted to do something quiet, peaceful.  It was pure luck he found The Dragon’s Lair on a rainy day about a month after his release.  He’d been wondering muggle streets, looking for something to catch his eye.  The name made him pause.  It was almost dusk, and he’d promised to have dinner with mother, but he couldn’t resist walking into the shop.  It was a dimly-lit bookstore, with dust on every surface, and a tiny old woman sitting behind her desk.
“Merlin,” Draco swore under his breath, then pointed to the left.  “It’s just a few blocks that way, you dolt.”
“Do you mind if I fetch Greg from wherever he’s working?” Draco cut in, hoping to warn his friend before the inevitable Potter onslaught.
Ron looked decidedly uncomfortable, but Hermione just rolled her eyes.  “If it’s to do with Draco, I’m sure you did
The day had been stifling, even with how gloomy and cloudy it was outside.  No breeze had found its way through Privet Drive, no matter how much Harry’d wished for one.  But with nightfall came a torrent of rainwater and stormy weather, and even the miserable wailing of the wind couldn’t shake Harry’s relief at the heat’s respite.  He laid on his back on his small bed, trying to make time go faster by reciting spells in his head.
It had been five days since Potter’s botched attempt at an apology, and Draco’s bad mood still hadn’t gone away.  Not that he’d been counting.  The sky was unobscured by clouds for once, and the sun hung lazily in the middle of it, warming the air.  Children were playing tag around the legs of their mothers, and the mothers were chatting amongst themselves contentedly and bribing their kids with ice cream.  Dog-walkers came in hoards.
name, and his friends’.  It wasn’t about right or wrong, it was about who won.  And that didn’t say anything about the individuals.  Harry only ever knew one side of them, the side that was ruthless and hellbent on killing him.  But he knew they couldn’t have all been purely evil.  They stuck together, were loyal to their families and friends.  They loved, and were loved.  Didn’t that mean something?
Harry stared at him a few seconds longer than necessary.  Even forced, his smile was charming.  “I think I’m done for today.”
Draco smiled fondly at Greg’s unsubtle infatuation with the landlady, and headed back out to the front.  Just as he was about to rejoin Potter and Rosmerta, he heard his name mentioned, and out of habit he hung back out of sight to listen.
Just to be an arse, Harry beamed at Draco as he grabbed a fistful of Floo powder from a pot above the fireplace and stepped in.  “Zabini Mansion,” he declared as he threw down the powder, and the last thing he saw of Parkinson’s flat was Draco’s answering glare.  Somehow, Harry had come to prefer that glare to any smile.
Snape snorted. Dumbledore gave a soft smile. “Well, Harry, sometimes lending your voice to others is more significant than saying the words yourself.”
Draco bristled at the use of his first name, but there was something undeniably captivating about how those syllables sounded coming from Potter’s mouth.  It was intimate in a way that Potter and Draco weren’t supposed to be.
“Oh,” Dr. Finch said, waving her other hand as she pushed a map toward them across her desk, “on the house, of course.  A friend of Draco’s is a friend of mine.”
Potter looked down at his shoes for a moment, and then, as if that gave him courage, he returned Draco’s stare and said, “If there’s anything I remember of Gregory from school, it’s that he was always at your side, for better or for worse.  You don’t stick by someone like that if you don’t feel like they want you there.  He knows you valued him.”
Draco wasn’t sure when he’d accepted his terribly inappropriate feelings towards the Golden Boy.  It was less of a sudden realization, and more of a gradual lessening of denial.  It was difficult to pretend he didn’t care when Harry stared at him like he did.  With his frustratingly green eyes, and wild black hair that simply
Before he could reach the bottom step however, Vernon Dursley was there blocking his path, his lumpy face set in its usual grimace.
The portrait had stared back at them in silence, eyes searching.  None of the paintings in the Zabini household spoke.  Draco wondered if Ms. Zabini had spelled them that way so they couldn’t accuse her of foul play or if something about this place made them want to keep their voices down.  Draco could understand that compulsion; the Mansion echoed in a way that shamed you into staying quiet.  It felt like a place of worship, though it was far from it.
Draco gave her an indignant look, but Dr. Finch barked a laugh and he decided to go along with it.  “I doubt that,” he chuckled.  “I bet you were all sorts of trouble.”
“You’re up to something, Potter,” Draco muttered at last, looking far from pleased.  The irony of this statement wasn’t lost on Harry; it was what Harry had been saying about Malfoy all through school.
Draco was too startled to stop him.  Daphne put her hand to her chest, like she was terribly offended, even though Harry hadn’t even insulted her.
Potter quickened his pace so that he was walking beside Draco.  “Why?” he asked, scrunching up his face like he was trying to figure out the meaning of life.
“Yes,” Draco answered, though it pained him to say such easily deduced facts aloud.  “Greg lives and works in the Three Broomsticks.”
Hermione’s eyes went wide.  “No, Harry, it doesn’t matter, we don’t care that you’re dating Draco, we’re still your friends!”
“Millicent,” Harry tried again with a burst of confidence, “you deserve more than how us Gryffindors treated you, and — ”
“Are we in Hogsmeade?” Potter asked in surprise, but Draco didn’t bother stating the obvious, even for someone as clueless as the savior of the wizarding world.  “He lives in the Three Broomsticks?” Potter went on as Draco led him to the familiar inn.
“Well,” Potter said, ducking his head a bit and running a hand through his incurably disheveled hair, “I was hoping you could introduce me to Goyle — Gregory Goyle, that is.”
Marcus Flint was the next on Harry’s list — a list he was trying to form as Draco stood in front of him tapping his foot impatiently, which didn’t help at all because Draco’s presence was far too distracting — and so Draco took him to Flint’s doorstep.  Draco failed to mention that Flint lived in France before taking them there, and when Harry realized this, he turned into a bit of a Hermione, lecturing Draco for several minutes on the illegality of transnational apparition.
Connor held out a sun-tanned hand, and Draco took it, relishing in how warm Connor’s skin was.  “Nice to meet you,” he said with a wink.  If he was surprised at Draco’s name, he didn’t show it.
Harry looked up at him with tired green eyes, and it was very hard to think anything at all while he was doing that.  Draco looked away.
Harry visibly looked around in disbelief, taking in the two customers present.  “I’ll try not to, Madam Rosmerta.”
“Fine,” Draco grumbled, glaring at him again.  “Wait for me outside.  I have to tell Dr. Finch that I’m taking a
“Why are you smiling, Potter?” Draco grumbled, staring him down.  If Draco was uncomfortable being around this man then damn him if he wasn’t going to try to make Potter uncomfortable too.
Dr. Finch shook her head as though in disapproval.  “Well, at least my girlfriends knew about each other.
Draco cut him off with an exasperated sigh.  “I’m not saying they are,” he said tiredly.  “I’m just explaining how it works.  It’s not hate.  That’s why so many normal people can feel superior without wanting to hurt anyone.  I feel superior to cats, but that doesn’t mean I want to hurt them.”  He sighed again, looking very worn out.  “This war you think you’ve won, it will never be over.  The magical world will always hold disdain for the non-magical one.  Parents will continue to pass down their beliefs, however benign, however subtle, and every once in a while, those beliefs will culminate in someone who
“Um, I like anything,” he answered casually.  Draco glanced over his shoulder to see Connor running his fingers over the spines of the books, just as Draco loved to do.  It made him smile fondly.
“Well, do it quick,” Parkinson demanded, standing and smoothing out her blouse.  “I can’t stand it when he sulks.”  She turned to Hermione and Ron, apparently done with Harry.  “It was a pleasure to meet you on friendly terms.  I hope to see you both again.”  She leaned down and kissed Hermione on the cheek and then turned on her heel to stride out of the restaurant.
When he reached the door — Vernon had closed it on their visitor, forcing him to wait out in the rain — Harry swung it open, his mouth forming an apology and a greeting at once, but all sound vanished from his throat as he took in the person standing before him.
Parkinson blinked at him like he was an idiot, which was entirely unfair considering the stressful interrogation she had just put him through.  “Of course, darling,” she said, and she began to walk away, but then turned to face him when she reached the doorway.  “I’m sorry too, for trying to give you up to the Dark Lord,” she added, sounding positively disinterested with the whole conversation.
…unlike Draco’s platinum blonde, that caught in the light like reflections in the water. Or like the shimmer of a snitch, but more silver. Harry briefly thought of Fleur’s flowing hair and charm and wandered if Draco had some Veela in him.
was the one touching Harry’s arm and making his heart race.  Until Harry slid his hand up to meet Daphne’s and brought her hand to his lips for a flirtatious kiss.  Draco had to bite his lip hard not to intervene.  Daphne was shameless.  But then her eyes slid to Draco’s and she winked.  It was still all for Draco’s benefit then.  Wonderful.  At least Potter wasn’t at risk.
Lavender snorted in response and Pansy beamed at her, leaning over to give her a peck on her cheek, right on one of her scars.  The left side of Lavender’s face and neck were marred with three deep gashes, the longest of which went from the top of her scalp to the edge of her collar bone.  Long since healed, they stood out as shiny pink reminders of a time before, when the Dark Lord and his followers were terrorizing Hogwarts.  Lavender wasn’t ashamed of her scars; she showed them off like medals.  She’d shaved half her head to make them more visible and Draco had to admit that the undercut suited her.  Pansy was head over heels for her little werewolf war hero.  She had even mastered the wolfsbane potion, even though Pansy hated potion-making.
The bell on the door of The Dragon’s Lair rang to announce a customer, and Draco immediately stiffened.  Was it Harry?  So soon?  Didn’t he have a
“Come in,” McGonagall called, and the stone staircase spiralled open to reveal Argus Filch, scowling and brandishing a dusty broom, with cat Mrs. Norris in tow.  “What is it now, Argus?” she asked, looking displeased.
Draco sighed, dropping his head onto the counter in defeat.  “He’s the worst person I’ve ever met,” he groaned, staring at the wood that was far too close to his eyes to see clearly.
“I think he was my father,” Blaise had said once when they were younger, eleven or twelve, one summer, as he stood in front of the portrait of Ms. Zabini’s third husband.  He had the same sharp features as Blaise, but his eyes were blue and pouchy, making him look weak and helpless.  Blaise was fiercer than anyone else Draco knew, even at that age.
“Of course, he’s just in the storeroom,” Ros told him, shooing him away with a flick of her wrist while keeping her eyes locked on the Boy Who Lived.
Harry’s mirth vanished rather abruptly but he forced himself to keep laughing until his friends were catching their breaths.  There was no reason to be upset.  He wasn’t upset.
has changed,” Harry insisted, wishing he could say the right thing to make Draco less defensive, the magic words to make him understand.
“Er, yes,” Harry replied, glancing at Flint, who was still laughing away.  “I’ve come to apologize — ”
“Er….”  Harry racked his brain for any memories he had of Parkinson in school.  There was the time when she’d draped herself all over Draco in the Hogwarts Express.  Harry’s insides churned at the reminder.  And then the times she teased Hermione.  Or when she tried to give Harry up to Voldemort.  No, she must’ve done something else….  Suddenly, Harry remembered a day in charms class in fifth year when Pansy Parkinson cast a perfect silencing charm in Professor Flitwick’s class on her first try, though Hermione had been working on hers for weeks.  Flitwick had given Slytherin ten points for that.  “Charms!” Harry exclaimed in his excitement, then flushed when he realized how loud he’d been.  “You’re brilliant at charms,” he reiterated at a normal volume.
Draco rolled his eyes, a terrible habit that was only exacerbated by his proximity to Potter.  “Because Greg was never an ambitious soul, and he always had an enormous crush on Rosmerta.  It’s a wonder he was in Slytherin, the great oaf is more of a Hufflepuff than anything.”
“I never knew you had a mean streak, Potter,” Draco commented dryly when he saw Harry looking.  He was still smiling, like he couldn’t hold it back for the life of him.
Harry leant forward, resting his arms on the table between them, not breaking his staring match with the blonde.  “What
Harry strode in first, looking much more confident than when they’d first arrived (maybe it’d been the crowds that had bothered him; Draco could relate to that), and Draco followed after, with Blaise bringing up the rear and closing the door behind the three of them.  Harry lingered in the middle of the room, looking unsure what to do with himself, so Draco set the example by sitting on one side of the couch, and Harry gratefully followed his lead, plopping down next to him.  Blaise filled three glasses with the aforementioned firewhiskey, and handed them off, sipping at his own tactfully as he took a seat in an adjacent chair.
McGonagall scrutinised him for a moment as Harry held his breath. “Potter,” she said finally, “are you familiar with Edwina Runcorn?”
Harry walked back through the rows of headstones until he reached the dirt road on the other side, where he could apparate away.  He had to find Draco Malfoy.
“Yes,” Hermione agreed, as if Parkinson had made a brilliant point.  “And maybe it would ease some of his… stress, if you talked to him.”
, all lean muscles and obvious abs under his thin grey t-shirt.  He had curly golden-brown locks that fell to his shoulders, and made Draco’s hair look pale and dank in comparison.  His warm brown eyes shone brightly in the dim shop, and Draco couldn’t look away for the life of him.  “You’re American?” he asked, trying desperately to sound normal.
, Draco knew.  He’d seen Harry enough times with his friends, and his girlfriends in the past, to know that he didn’t look at anyone like that.  Only Draco.
Harry licked his lips nervously, and Draco glanced down at them so quickly Harry wasn’t sure if he imagined it or not.  “Ron says the Chudley Cannons are going to win this season.”
“Harry Potter,” Draco began with a passion, raising his head off the wood to meet Rosmerta’s amused eyes, “is the most self-righteous, entitled, idiotic wizard alive.  I’ve met
Malfoy was glowering at him, but there was something else in that look.  A terror that he couldn’t quite mask.  “Don’t be stupid, Potter,” he scoffed mirthlessly.  “If you don’t run I’ll be killed for nothing.  At least give me an honorable death, will you?”
“Nothing!” Harry cried, flabbergasted by the whole ordeal.  “Why does everyone assume I did something wrong?”
“She can seem kind of intimidating at first,” Lavender said as she delivered his tea, voice pitched low so the other two wouldn’t hear.  “But the Slytherins are all sweethearts underneath.  You just have to wear them down.”  She winked at him as if she’d just done him a huge favor, and Harry wondered if she had.  Perhaps all he needed to do with Draco was wear down his defenses.  Spend more time getting to know him.  It wasn’t all that bad of an idea.
“Er,” Potter stalled, and it was written all over his face that he was struggling to think of any muggle topic that might be in a book.  “Something on… medicine?”
“And it matters,” Harry said quietly, almost pleading.  There was only a couple feet between them.  “Your forgiveness, it matters to me.”
Blaise set his glass down, and made a show of leaning forward in interest as he waited for Potter to get on with it.  Underneath all the courteous manners, Blaise really wasn’t a patient man.
“Now, Potter,” McGonagall said suddenly, startling Harry from his reverie. “This is the third anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, and the first one I’ve convinced you to be apart of. I hope you’ve considered what you want to say for your speech?”
