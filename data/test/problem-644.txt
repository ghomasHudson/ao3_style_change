“Deal, Malfoy?” he asks. “Six months in Italy, six months in India, a year together?” He slides his hand across the table, expression expectant. Draco stares at it, registering distantly that he’s supposed to be shaking it.
Voldemort, Voldemort, Voldemort. He would whisper it, trembling, tears streaming down his face, his heartbeat ricocheting off the walls of his frail, frail body. The name held power, tasting like bile on his tongue, his meagre dinner already in his throat.
Draco sighs. This is the Potter he’s used to, confused and a little Stupefied. Not the one he’s been faced with for the past month, in the courtroom or Knockturn or the Muggle pub or here. It does little to comfort him.
Harry bows his head and his next words are so delicately soft that they’re almost inaudible. “I think I’m falling in love with you, Draco Malfoy.”
Draco had been feeding Scorpius chocolate pudding while telling him a story from work (most of those weren’t child friendly, but the ones that were, endlessly entertained Scorpius who would often ask a couple days later about what happened to Daedalus Diggory after he filed a case against a goose), and Scorpius’ eyes had been sparkling so bright that Harry had known this was a moment he needed to keep preserved forever.
“No,” Harry cuts him off before he can even finish. “You ought to know and I ought to say.” He jerkily turns around and when Draco reaches up to touch his shoulders, he finds them stiff as a board.
“When the culture of a place as small as this is bifurcated between Muggle and wizarding, sometimes it gets hard to differentiate,” he says by way of explanation. “Some of the Muggle history involves wizarding facts that they explain away and some of the wizarding history is heavily influenced by the actions of the Muggles.”
He sits down, keeping his eyes on Weasley and Potter, both of whom are tracking his movements with their eyes. When the oppressive silence and staring gets far too much to bear, Draco bursts out, “What?!”
The pain comes back with the third one but there’s more pleasure than Draco could have thought possible before this. He gasps and moans and arches and squirms until Harry takes his other hand and holds his hip firmly in place. “You’re going to stop moving if you want me to not hurt you,” he says in warning.
It gets significantly harder to ignore Malfoy’s unveiled desire to share Harry’s cup when a long, pale finger makes its way into Harry’s line of sight, dips its condescending way into his cup, swirls itself around and draws back.
“The Christmas Ball, Draco. The one in three weeks, the one McGonagall has continuously been talking about. Who are you taking?”
Harry obliges him, sliding the tip of his finger into Draco’s clenching hole. The intrusion burns something fierce, but it’s the sort of burn Draco enjoys with every fibre of his being. Every cell of him screams for more and every heartbeat rings true to the rhythm of Harry’s name.
He’s seen it before, Lovegood’s face at the Ministry events where Harry appears with Ginevra on his arm and the photographers swarm them like bees. He’s suspicious his own face resembles that melancholy, resigned set more than he’s comfortable acknowledging.
He should get out of bed and eat something, Hermione tells him every day. Talk to Ron. Firecall the Weasleys. Visit Teddy. Visit Andromeda.
Sleep was either elusive or continuous. Either he slept for half an hour and woke up panting with his wand in his hand and visions of Fiendfyre behind his eyes or he slept for a day straight and woke up to Hermione’s panicked screaming for him to wake up.
“That is your father, is it not?” A voice murmurs from the chair he had assumed Harry was sitting in.
“No one likes to be exposed as the other woman, now do they?” he drawls. It’s a weak rejoinder, weaker than anything Draco has ever thrown at Potter, a barb directed more towards himself if anything, but it makes Potter flinch.
“Okay,” Draco says, and he still sounds a little unconvinced but it’s a few steps in the direction of progress from the standpoint of absolute denial so Harry counts it as a victory.
They spend their days exploring Florence, the unknown parts, the seedier back alleys, the cobblestones stained with memory and history.
Through the dances, Draco keeps up a running commentary on the couples, their robes, other things that strike him. Sometimes its snarky, sometimes its admiring. Harry laughs often and Draco feels like the centre of the universe with Harry’s entire focus on him.
The stream of expletives falling from his lips are nothing to him but a string of distant words that have ceased to make any sense. He’s perceiving the world through the fog of the pleasurable pain and everything else seems so far-removed that he cannot be bothered by it.
So he does the best he can with Kingsley’s heavy eyes fixed on him, and bows his aching head in the one thing he finds hopelessly unfamiliar—respect. Respect for a man who appointed him a defence, respect for the man who took the broken reins of the broken world, respect for the man who refuses to let a Marked Death Eater be swallowed by the yawning maw of Azkaban’s black mouth without a trial as fair as one can be for a man like him.
Harry gets up, stretches his legs, raises his arms above his head and swings them around before clutching at his arse and wincing slightly. His tailbone is sore from sitting in one position for quite so long and he can’t feel his thighs. Just as he grips his arse tighter, trying to relieve some of the soreness, the conversation stops and Harry looks down to see both Malfoy and Hermione staring at him.
“That’s the plan is it? Hole yourself up on some hill in a garden full of roses and come back a year later, all posh and sneery when faced with us common folk?”
Malfoy’s eyes are so grey. Overcast skies and the sound of rain, Harry’s favourite jumper and the comfort of winter sunshine. It’s thrilling in ways irises should not be.
Harry doesn’t have the brainpower to figure out the intricacies of why Draco chose to fixate on the fact that Harry is calling him Malfoy. The memory of Draco’s smile when Harry had called him by his name the first few times flutters to the fore of his thoughts and the pain in his heart twists and pulls on every heartstring. There is no melody to the sound Harry’s soul is making, no more melody than there is in a glass sculpture shattering on the floor.
Draco had dropped his forehead onto Harry’s shoulder, chuckled softly and had moved away to fetch a washcloth to wipe away the chocolate Scorpius was tangling into his blond hair.
He sees Granger’s head droop before she jerks herself awake and widens her eyes to keep them from falling shut and frowns.
Rome is a king, and Draco is a prince, and Harry is a happy voyeur watching a kingdom thrive before his eyes.
There had been falling. What’s more, Harry is still falling and he finds himself a little surprised by how unfazed he is at the possibility of striking the ground at some point—hard.
Malfoy looks startled, then angry for a second and then resigned. His eyes on Harry are steady, the grey of them unbearable.
“I’m always right,” Draco informs Blaise, waving the whisky in his general direction. “And I never wanted to
“I’m sorry—” he begins, turning towards Harry but Harry cuts him off with a kiss. It’s been burning through his veins all day, watching Draco in his comfort zone, leaned against the backrest of their restaurant booth, exchanging jibes and insight on their friends with Parkinson. They don’t talk about their friends the way Harry would about his, but there’s an odd fondness in their insults and mockery, an affection that asserts itself in vicious slander and the assurance that it’s allowed. It’s irrationally attractive—Draco’s carefree smile curving his lips, his grey eyes flickering with mirth.
“But then again, what’s the point of all that potential either if you’re going to waste it holed up in a villa?”
He draws in a deep breath and rubs a hand across his face and that’s when it hits him, the realisation that the Glamour has collapsed. He gasps and drags his finger over the bleeding cut on his lip and stares at it when it comes away smeared with blood.
He reckons they aren’t. It’s a freeing thought. There are no expectations tying him down for this. He can just be and Draco will let him fall. Draco will catch him and if he can’t, they will fall together into whatever awaits.
Draco brings the glass of smoking Firewhisky to his lips, and stares at the carpet. It needs a few cleaning spells, he thinks, staring at the dark hairs caught in the fur.
“Tell me how to make it up to you,” he beseeches when they’ve pulled apart finally, simply looking at each other.
Draco’s eyes are still sharp but the edges around them soften. The thin line of his mouth looks less cruel. He pulls Harry in for a gentle kiss, all winter warmth and hearth fire comfort, insistent and grounding. Harry melts into it, lets Draco lead the dance of it, revelling in the knowledge that someone knows him well enough to put the exact right amount of pressure to make him yield to their touch.
“Harry,” he finally sighs. “We’ve all made mistakes. You just have a reminder of yours staring you in the face right now.”
. So Ron, even with his nightmares and his occasional bouts of crippling misery decided to go and help George out in the shop.
“Can you believe she told me she knows what it must be like to be married to a celebrity?” he had asked Harry, with his arms around Harry’s bare waist as bacon sizzled in the pan. “Just because she’s trying to divorce Anthony Filibuster doesn’t mean everyone is!”
“I’ll go,” Draco mumbles, loosening his grip around Harry’s wrist when the silence between them has stretched for a little too long. He stands up and looks back towards Harry before turning away and laughing into his hands. It’s a broken, bitter sound, one Harry wants to crush until it dies, until Draco never thinks of making a sound like that again. “Now you have a real reason to leave,” he says and heads for the door.
Before he can groan in pleasure, Draco moves away lightning fast, one hand clenched tight in Harry’s hair, the other slapped over Harry’s mouth. “Thin walls,” he whispers and Harry groans anyway.
“I know,” Harry says, because there’s nothing else to be said at this point, really. “I’m intimately familiar with his… preferences.”
He reaches out to trace the carved work when he hears a throat being cleared and jerks back with such alarming speed that a shock travel up his upper arm from his elbow.
On Fridays and Wednesdays, Harry turns up at the Manor, usually with a lunchbox packed by Ron who has taken to cooking enough food for four. Malfoy opens the door everyday, sometimes immediately and sometimes ten minutes after Harry has knocked and announced his presence several times by shouting, conjuring flying birds and then simply sitting down and waiting.
Hermione gives him a look that causes him to pause in the stroking of her hair. “For someone who wanted Malfoy thrown out of the house less than a week ago, you sure are pretty insistent on me meeting him.”
“He—” Fire and heat flash behind his eyes. The scent of burning books, burning hair, Crabbe’s burning flesh. Potter’s voice, sharp and clear, his waist firm beneath Draco’s quivering hands. Potter’s eyes, dismissive and vague outside the burning Room of Hidden Things. Goyle telling Draco in a wet undertone,
He knows he’s attracted to Potter. It’s a fact, an awareness at the back of his brain, a sensitivity that Draco on his worst days thinks of as humiliating weakness and on his best thinks of as a possibility for something more. But his attraction has hinged on Potter’s intensity—the world of emotions hiding behind the verdant gaze, the scar running down the side of his forehead, stretching almost imperceptibly onto the top of his right eyebrow. He’s attracted to the way Potter holds a conversation, with full focus and unexpected charisma. He’s attracted to who he sees Potter to be.
He looks around, aware that he’s still in the rose garden, standing in the middle of it, where he’d been when he’d drunk the poison before crawling over to the rose bushes that had petalled their wedding in their blooms.
He sobs and he wonders why he isn’t recoiling from it, gasping from it, pushing Ginevra away. He wonders why Harry is eating into everything, consuming every part of him, consuming every waking thought until he can’t think any longer as he spirals into an echoing cry within the confines of his mind– a constant, throbbing echo of
‘Alright,’ Draco murmurs, stilling his movements. ‘Just know that it’s okay to withdraw consent at any point. Use the safe word if you need to and everything stops.’
The utter confusion at seeing Draco’s eyes widen in horror, his own horror when he realises that Draco probably hadn’t done this because he wanted to, had only kissed him because he had ended up being too obvious about his attraction and Draco, out of obligation had kissed him. And immediately after, regretted it.
Draco smiles, his heartbreaking smile, all angles softened by it. “Give me a minute,” Harry says, staring at it, unable to look away. He wants that smile to fall apart under his ministrations, segueing into an expression of open-mouthed pleasure. He wants to see how many of Draco’s angles soften with orgasm and how many of his muscles clench. He wants to count the stars that appear in Draco’s eyes when he looks at Harry in the aftermath, constellations worthy of a man named after the skies. “I want to learn to suck you off.”
Harry picks it up, slides it on and abruptly walks away, leaving Draco standing in the kitchen, newspaper forgotten and face pale.
He lies back, the sheets cool against his overheated body, still staring up at Draco who looks like all his dreams are coming true. Harry swallows.
“So where–” Harry begins, cutting himself off, when he doesn’t understand how to phrase his question better.
He cuts himself off, remembering Dobby before he vanished with Potter and Granger and Weasley and the other prisoners, eyes wide with Bellatrix’ blade lodged in his heart, his little nursemaid elf killed by Dolohov for simply bringing in the wrong dish, the Hogwarts elves shaking in fear when Amycus and Alecto made examples of them at the dinner table.
That happened sometime around the Court Case That Sent Everything To Living Hell. A little before it, perhaps. Definitely not after. The morning they both dressed in their formal robes to go into the Wizengamot meeting, staring into separate mirrors, kissing Scorpius on the head without looking each other in the eye and going over their respective case files, Harry knows for certain they did not sit down to eat together.
On some mornings, they choose to stay in bed, just talking. Draco finds out about the parts of Granger that are not stuffy and boring. He discovers that Weasley is apparently some sort of Chess Master, a fact Harry is endlessly bitter about. He learns that Ginevra and Harry fell out before Harry disappeared for their seventh year and that after, they never managed to pick back up. He learns that Harry did not just leave friends behind in Britain, but his family.
Well. Harry doesn’t really have an answer to that. He’s glad she didn’t point out the obvious—that it makes more sense for her to be here than Harry. If she did, Harry isn’t sure he could stomach the humiliation.
Harry begins to press open mouthed kisses to Draco’s straining cock through the thin material of his pants and Draco almost sobs with the urgency thrumming through his veins. His fingertips crackle with latent magic, and one of Harry’s hands leaves his hips to palm at his own cock, which Draco realises is just as hard in the confines of his comparatively loose, and yet woefully ill equipped jeans.
He’s standing at the window, watching the lights of Camden flicker and dim and flare, the cigarette smoke curling from his lips into the night sky. There are no stars tonight, their fires shrouded in the a cotton candy graveyard of clouds.
Pausing in his act of gently tracing Draco’s dick through his briefs, Harry leans down so his lips brush Draco’s earlobe, “If you’re quite done talking, I’d like to tell you I’m done taking it slow.” Immediately after he says that, he leans back up, sitting straight, a frown on his face, “Unless of course you don’t want to–”
After a few more moments of Harry’s fingers stroking the insides of Draco’s arse, he hits something that sends sparks up his spine and he gasps loudly, startled.
When Harry’s hands finally come to rest on the hem of Draco’s shirt, it doesn’t feel like a perversion of something Draco wants but can’t have, doesn’t feel like another aggressive attempt on Harry’s part to get through his life without breaking into a million shards. It feels natural, and it feels like home, and Draco feels a pressure behind his eyelids that he blinks away rapidly.
“Of course,” he says, and backs away from the doorway. Scorpius shuts his eyes, and when he opens them, the door is closing, Draco’s pale hand disappearing into darkness.
Draco almost slumps over but Harry still hasn’t come so he keeps his eyes fixed on Draco and swipes his tongue over his lips, tasting the salty bitterness there. Deliberately he thrusts up, barely moving, only shifting gently deep inside him and Draco closes his eyes and sobs.
She barks out a laugh. “I assure you, I’m not. I think I’d go stark raving mad if I had to be cooped up in Grimmauld all day, everyday. No, I’ve been helping George out at the shop, learning to cook from Mum, this and that, you know.”
He was placed under house arrest with Ministry protection, and Scorpius had later discovered that when Harry Potter had been a Junior Auror, he’d been placed as Selwyn’s guard for his first mission.
Harry blankly stares at photo albums of Scorpius and Draco for hours, shut up in his bedroom. He traces the lines of Draco’s smiles and exasperated eye rolls just as frequently as he kisses Scorpius’ chubby cheeks in the pictures.
what he’d planned on doing. And now that Potter says it, in that derisive, slightly mocking tone, with a small smirk curling his full lips, it seems foolish and selfish in a way that indicates he has learned nothing.
They lie in bed, tracing absent patterns on each other’s arms and chests. Occasionally they talk. They skirt the heavier topics, the War, Voldemort, the Manor, dead relatives. But they’re not avoiding them. A day will come soon, Draco knows, when they will get to understand each other’s pasts better, but today, while they lie in bed together and Draco conjures the night sky with his wand to teach Harry constellations, is not that day.
Potter’s curls are swaying with every gust of wind and Draco notices that his hair is noticeably longer down his back than it appears from the front. He should probably think about tying it back if it gets any longer, he thinks abstractly.
yet. He wants to feel Harry’s skin, experiment with his sensitivities, seek out what makes him keen and arch and moan. He’s not sure he wants to shove his dick anywhere and be done with it.
It’s one of the happiest memories Scorpius has. One of the reasons (besides avoiding the uncomfortable head-turning that would have come with any other position) that Scorpius had asked Harry to put the chairs this way in this room. Something had briefly flickered in those green eyes then, and Harry had spent a little too long perfecting the position of what was to be Draco’s chair.
Even through the haze in his mind, Draco can see Granger’s expression shifting. He didn’t know what it had been and he didn’t know what it is now but the frown between her eyes is prominent enough for him to notice through the cloud of fog in his head. She places the tray in her arms on the couch and sits in front of him on her haunches on the rug, her steps slow, her movements careful.
He doesn’t think he could admit to the fact that Harry’s proximity sends fever sharp chills down his spine. Doesn’t think Harry would stay if he did.
Malfoy shrugs. “My father didn’t believe Muggles did justice to anything. But mainly because many wizarding artists lived in Florence and the Muggles never took those buildings and made them into museums or even bothered to preserve them as historically valuable.”
He always looks at Draco with those stupid green eyes, like he’s looking for an answer in Draco’s face contorted on the throes of orgasm and Draco always has to close his eyes on Tuesday evenings to keep himself from facing the inevitable disappointment on Harry’s face.
The colour, Harry thinks, love coursing through his veins for the man standing before him, looking for all the world like he has won the lottery at the prospect of teaching hundreds of Muggle-born children, does indeed bring out his eyes.
He almost spins on his heel and leaves but both Potter’s green gaze and Granger’s pleading one are fixed upon him already so all he can do is awkwardly fidget, unsure if he’s welcome.
“Did the blood you shed not appeal to that posh palate?” someone asks. Draco looks up and Ginevra Weasley is fixing him with a cold, dead-eyed look.
“There’s a difference between tolerance and acceptance,” Potter says and the words stop Draco short. “And I saw you when you entered this place. You looked… surprised. That a Muggle place wasn’t whatever you imagined it to be, overrun with filth and dogs and falling to pieces.”
Harry takes him, down to the root, slow and careful. This isn’t something they do often, usually Harry fucks him and leaves. Sometimes there’s blowjobs, sometimes there’s handjobs, on one memorable occasion there was rimming. But this technique is something Harry has learnt relatively recently and it’s testament to his prowess at learning on his feet that within ten seconds, Draco’s toes are curling.
He looks around, taking note of the way the bed is still mostly done, as though Harry has spent the night here, but has not bothered to rest.
He has the upper hand of knowledge, so when he wraps his fingers around the leaking head of his dick and rubs himself fast and hard, he knows to be silent, he knows to sink his teeth into the pillow, into the meat of his palm instead of letting the sounds escape. It’s one thing to listen to Harry wank. It’s quite another to make Harry listen to him doing the same to the soundtrack of Harry’s pleasure.
Malfoy starts laughing. It’s a full belly laugh tinged with hysteria, something frightened and excited and a little out of control and Harry’s alarm ratchets higher. The other patrons are looking at them with thinly veiled distaste and in desperation, Harry reaches across the table to grab his arm.
“Yes,” Harry says, voice breathy and hoarse and he almost loses it when Draco’s long fingers fall from his chest down to his button and fly, pulling down, down, down, until Harry is naked.
“Did I do something?” And that voice, the lost, yearning edge of it, the tilt of a hesitant question has Harry’s confidence in his decision sprawling to the very precipice. This is not the voice of a man who wants Harry gone, it’s the voice of one trying to cling to him.
Immediately Harry knows something is wrong. Malfoy is always in the damn kitchen. He checks the rooms, casting charms to reveal human presence and when he finds nothing, he is almost willing to believe Malfoy has left the house to go somewhere. He is about to leave when a faint memory of walking through these halls quietly, silently, in the dead of the night niggles at the back of his brain.
Malfoy’s villa is… exactly what Harry envisioned it to be when Malfoy had first taken it upon himself to mention having property in Italy. It’s imposing in the way Harry suspects all Malfoy properties are, an isolated structure rendered in stone, untouchable and proud.
“We will not dance,” Harry tells Draco, hands on his hips. His hair is falling into his eyes, he’s got a five-o-clock shadow and an exasperated expression Draco would love to kiss right off.
“I had sex with people at funerals. Especially the Muggle-Born ones. They had all these distant relatives coming in, all these people who barely knew the dead body in a coffin but still felt obligated to come and say goodbye. I felt something similar. You’d be surprised to know how many people are willing to have sex in graveyards.”
They stare at each other. Draco’s sure he looks like a blinking fool, with his confusion evident all over his face. Potter looks strangely upset.
There’s an uncomfortable lull. She cracks her knuckles and he taps a Celestina Warbeck tune on the wood of the chair.
Harry would teasingly raise his eyebrows, sipping his coffee slowly. His schedule wasn’t in tandem with Draco’s, and he had a six year old son whom he exploited mercilessly as an excuse for the days he was late to the office. It gave him the time to watch Draco in his element– coming down harsh upon the evils of Wizarding society in unparliamentary language which he later filtered in court to be scathing checks on the perpetrator of the day.
is standing out stark and pale against his skin under the table—the Malfoy who stomped on his nose, the Malfoy who dressed up as a Dementor and sent Harry plummeting to the ground, the Malfoy who—the Malfoy who—
Harry feels the abrupt need to glare. “Stop looking at me like that,” he hisses. “Like I’m some specimen in a—in a gay history zoo!”
The word is a shuddering bird in this courtroom of hostile predators, cracked down the middle and dead before it hits the ground. The word is a broken remnant of what Draco’s words were once, haughty and accented and sharp to a fault.
He looks up once more and yet again, their eyes meet. Draco can’t help but wonder how, through the sea of yellow and blue, they always manage to find each other so effortlessly. There’s movement towards Draco’s right, startling him out of his reverie and he jerks his head sharply, but it’s just a house-elf cleaning up spilled juice from a First Year’s lap. When he looks back, Potter’s seat at the Gryffindor table is empty. Draco turns around, surprised, and is just in time to see the doors of the Hall close shut.
Harry mixes in his sugar, and adds cream to Draco’s (Scorpius is surprised by how well Harry remembers the way Draco takes his coffee), humming a jaunty tune under his breath. He leans against the counter, closing his eyes and sighing gently at the first sip of what has to be burning liquid.
But Harry’s memories of the Manor are tainted in grey and black, in Hermione’s screams and Voldemort’s cold smile and red eyes. Every time Harry thinks of the Manor, rain drowns his memory of it in a fevered deluge, falling in heavy sheets, obscuring all but the forbidding iron wrought gates that led to the gravel driveway.
By the time he tugs Draco’s T-shirt off his shoulders, Draco’s hands have come up to grip his. “Can I?” he asks, an each of Harry’s words from earlier, reverent and wondering, and Harry gasps his assent. Draco goes faster than he did, undoing the buttons with efficiency, but the moment Harry’s shirt falls away to reveal his chest, Draco’s hands slow their movements to a snail’s pace, exploratory fingers running over the curves of his ribs, the muscles of his abdomen.
He drags a fingernail over the most curious of all of Harry’s scars, hex damage spreading over the centre of his chest, like bolts of lightning in the night sky.
“You must be joking. This is some cruel joke and I shall not stand for it, I will probably be carted back in—”
He could walk into any room and everyone would look at him like he’s the fucking sun after days of incessant rain. And Draco understands because he would do the exact same. Maybe not this obviously, maybe not with all his emotions writ plain on his face.
“You can’t know whether I have time or not,” Draco had muttered and Granger had merely shaken her head with a smile.
There’s a hot, wide, wet tongue swiping over the sensitive skin of his balls and Harry actually begins to cry, his tears running down the sides of his cheeks, falling onto the cotton sheets below. Draco doesn’t seem to care as he flicks at Harry’s balls with his tongue and then proceeds to press open mouthed kisses all over them.
There’s a fire, but it’s not wild. There’s passion but it doesn’t drown. If this is what letting go feels like, Draco will fall forever.
“Are you fucking with me?” Draco asks, voice raspy, pulling Harry down and wrapping his arms around his neck. “It’s all I’ve wanted since the first time you lost your shit in that kitchen.”
“You realise there is a lot of work to be done?” she asks him eventually, breaking them both out of the hush. “No matter how much you pay me, or how many contracts you have me sign informing me I must be available at any time I am not seeing another patient, this will not be a functional relationship unless you do at least some introspection. Unless you’re
The Stone had required another special Hogwarts sanction granted to him immediately. He knows quite well what Neville had thought when he had accompanied Harry into the clearing in the Forbidden Forest.
“You do know that more likely than not, the meeting, if it happens will be held in Grimmauld Place, don’t you?” She asks, voice tinged with concern. “You’ll be up to facing Malfoy, won’t you?”
“Lovegood?” Malfoy says. “Are you quite insane? She was imprisoned in the Manor’s cellars for so long I lost track. I’ll be lucky if she doesn’t hex me six ways from Sunday the minute she sees me.”
“I have your wand,” Potter says, looking at him. He has a habit of making full eye contact when he speaks and it unsettles Draco who’s only used to Slytherin tactics of eye-contact. There are rules for this sort of thing, he thinks indignantly. One never makes eye-contact when making semi-monumental statements. This is the time for a flickering gaze- a split second of full eye contact, a moment spent looking away, things like that. But Potter clearly isn’t intimate with eye etiquette.
Almost reflexively, Harry tightens his grip around Draco’s arm. It must have been tighter than he had intended it to be because the next thing he knows, Draco is sitting up ramrod straight in bed and checking his temperature.
Just like always, this time too was entirely futile, Draco’s stubbornness, abrupt subject changes and blank stare winning out over her persistence.
“Mione, I–” His voice breaks. He doesn’t know how to say this without sounding ridiculously pathetic but he tries anyway. “Don’t leave me.”
The familiar roil of panic surges through him, churning ominously in his stomach. His brain is going foggy and Draco has one moment of blinding, devastating panic and he thinks not right now, not again, not here-
It’s dark and filled with screams and forgotten echoes of forgotten people and their forgotten pain, but above everything else, it is freezing.
During the next week Harry spends his afternoons at his desk, hesitating before every swish of his wand that sends some files flying into a pile marked, ‘To be delegated’. There’s another, significantly smaller pile that says, ‘For the Head Auror’ and only case files that are top priority, national security or high risk are in it alongside all communication with the Minister.
“There are Healer oaths, Malfoy,” Hermione says, not looking at the Mark but instead at his face. “They can’t refuse to treat you. You’ve been acquitted.”
Hermione sits up straight. “That shouldn’t be a problem. There are Healers at Mungo’s willing to be discreet–”
He’s holding a washcloth which he presses to the nape of Harry’s neck and the relief he feels is so pleasurable and instantaneous that he sighs softly, letting his stiff muscles relax. Before he knows what’s happening, Draco has pulled his head into his lap and is carding his fingers gently, softly, through Harry’s hair, pressing his nails slightly against his scalp. His matted, knotted hair which he realises from the contact has become sweaty and disgusting.
He can’t gauge the time but figures it must not be too late if no one is yet banging on his door and bursting through. When he casts a Tempus, it shows it’s close to noon. He’s confused and disoriented but drags himself out of bed anyway. Standing in the middle of the room for a few moments, unsure of what he is supposed to do, he decides to change out of the damp, ratty clothes he has worn for almost a… week.
With a small sigh, Harry holds out a hand which Draco takes in his own, gripping a little too tight. Harry pulls him closer and Draco follows, without hesitation.
“Bastard,” he says, and grins, his dimples pools of shadow in the warm curves of his cheeks. Draco pulls him down and presses a soft kiss to the left one, letting it linger. His heart races as he wonders if it’s been too revealing, too emotional and if Harry will finally draw away, but Harry’s breath hitches and his grip tightens on Draco’s arms.
The idea of a shower holds definite appeal. Cool hair, cleanliness, maybe some soap. But the effort it will take for him to stand… Harry doesn’t want to bother.
With one hand, Harry pushes Draco back down on the bed, raises himself and crawls back up Draco’s torso, hands mapping the areas which lips had claimed moments ago. For a minute he thinks Harry will lean in for a kiss and prepares himself for it, smiling sultrily at Harry, wanting to feel those soft, dry lips against his own. But instead, Harry reaches down unexpectedly and sucks viciously on his right nipple and Draco sees stars.
He turns, ignoring Harry’s demands to wait and Hermione’s cry of Draco, what’s wrong? and steps into the Floo. The last thing he sees before the flames obscure Grimmauld Place is Harry standing in the middle of the staircase looking like someone just shifted the ground out from underneath him.
Scorpius who spends the nights pestering Death for slideshows of the people they are, startles when Harry clatters down the stairs, bleary eyed and yawning.
The table is quiet. Hermione seems to be holding her breath, Harry isn’t sure how to continue this conversation and Malfoy seems to be struggling to say something and is suffering at the hands of some merciless internal conflict. Eventually he settles on whispering, “Did you get my letters?”
They sit in uncomfortable silence for a few more moments before Potter speaks. His voice is raspy, like he hasn’t used it in days. Maybe he smokes, a distant part of Draco’s brain supplies. Another part immediately visualises a corresponding image of Potter standing on the shore of the lake, a stream of smoke curling around his mouth, a grey halo in the dying light of dusk. Draco shifts slightly.
“I have encountered the accused’s bigotry at the age of eleven. No child of eleven is capable of forming bigoted, prejudiced views about an entire class of people by themselves. It is more than obvious that the mentalities Mr Malfoy has been exposed to throughout his childhood have gone a long way in shaping his bigotry which played a part in his misguided decisions.
He reaches the top and the grounds of Hogwarts stretch out before him, the Forbidden Forest an ominous black mass in the distance. There’s light coming from Hagrid’s hut and some errant children are hidden in his pumpkin patch, the tops of their ginger and blonde heads visible only from the bird’s eye view he seems to have.
“He found the place in ruins. Absolutely massacred, rubble everywhere. Some portions were preserved, quite intact, but most of it was in shambles. So he bought the property back from the wizarding state and redid the villa in the exact image of what it had once been with provisions for modern facilities. Which is why it has—”
Draco in turn takes Harry’s hand in his own and squeezes. It is a warm, reassuring press of skin against his, knowledge that Draco will be there till he sleeps so he doesn’t have to be alone. When he opens his eyes which are too heavy to keep open for too long to take one look to know Draco’s real before he sleeps, he finds him sitting on the bed, staring at him with an expression so intense that Harry feels consumed in a fire he didn’t even know was burning.
“Maybe if you bothered to be a better person, I would believe that,” Harry says, uncharitably. The fact that he’s spending his evening, and has signed up to spend the rest of the year in this git’s company seems to wash over him all of a sudden. His stomach has turned to ice. These lips twisted into a cruel sneer, calling Hermione a filthy Mudblood and Ron a Weasel is an image that keeps rising to the fore every time he can bring himself to look at Malfoy.
But for Harry and Draco, that sort of schedule doesn’t work. There’s no routine. That would require the couple (the couple!) to be in sync. The last time Scorpius can remember them having been in sync was three years ago, when they had their last fight in the kitchen, throwing well timed barbs at each other, baring their teeth and saying exactly the things they knew to be shards of a poisoned dagger slicing through each other’s hearts.
“What you are,” says Granger, punctuated her words with distinct chops with her knife and an air of finality, “is my friend.”
being paid rather handsomely to put up with this and anything else he can come up with. It’s an effective way of draining vaults that do not have to pay for a child’s education anymore.
That is of course until Hermione bursts in, saying, “Hey, Draco, so I was thinking…” She stops when she sees the pair on the bed, eyes widening fractionally as her mouth closes around the words that got abruptly cut off.
“No.” Malfoy shakes his head vigorously. “No, no, no. I should never have let you talk me into dinner or whatever it is that you planned on doing here. I should have just left. I should have just left.”
Malfoy is suited to flattery just as much as flattery is suited to him, and even nature seems to understand.
The change washing over her face is instantaneous. Her jaw clenches, her eyes harden. She looks away, then looks to the mantel and looks down. Looks at the cup of tea Draco is holding. Eventually she looks at him and her shoulders slump ever so slightly. Draco feels guiltier than he is comfortable to admit.
The pressure building in his belly reaches a fever pitch, and Draco knows he’s going to combust if Harry keeps this up. “I’m… close,” he manages around the brutal thrusts of Harry’s skilled fingers. “Too close.”
Something pained and nauseated flickers in Draco’s grey eyes, before they fall right back into a cool mask. His fingers stop twitching.
But if that Potter becomes Harry there will be an edge of intimacy to it that will be a fatal hope, a desire that will have to die a thousand deaths every time Draco reminds himself that such dreams are fool’s gold.
Draco’s cool mask has been jarred off his face. The sharp angles and slopes of it are twisted in wide-eyed panic and surprise, as though he’s seeing Harry for the first time.
On Mondays and Thursdays, Hermione drags Malfoy into Muggle cafés and museums, holing him up in libraries and exhibitions. She comes back home bright eyed and talks about whatever she’s seen and the headway they have made on educating each other as their first projects. Maybe their only projects if the proposal doesn’t go through but Hermione had been determined to make some actual progress while they figured out the technicalities of their paperwork. Even if it turned out to be unofficial progress.
But Scorpius only remembers affectionate touches and endearments fading away into a deathly silence that combusted occasionally into vitriol and red hot anger. In a few years’ time, that too petered out and their palatial house was the haunt of a ghost of love, mouth open in a soundless scream.
Potter turns, his torso twisting, showing off the lines of his criminally trim waist and the way the jumper hugs his sides. “Nothing,” he says, turning back. “Probably an elf.”
Draco doesn’t respond to that. There’s no point lying to Blaise after all. He can lie to himself all he likes, but Blaise will shoot him an unimpressed look and tell him to pull his head out of his arse with no preamble. It’s one of the reasons he likes talking to Blaise more than Pansy or Daphne or Theo. They always entertain his bullshit, clucking sympathetically like mother hens, but Blaise… Blaise doesn’t have time for his delusions.
“Oh seriously!” Scorpius says, throwing his hands up. “He opens his buttons! He keeps offering her a damn drink like she’s some bird in a bar! He wears his wedding ring, like a temptation of some illicit affair. He’s being all Slytherin about it, but he’s my goddamn father, and I know
Granger nods and yawns again. Potter looks up from his perusal of Granger’s notes. “You need to go for dinner and then get some sleep, Mione.”
“You’re not getting out that easy,” whispers the roughened voice he’s accustomed to by now, barked orders and spewed insults blurring into each other as the overwhelming grey of his cell threatens to breach the carefully constructed barriers of his mind. “There’s more you need to suffer for.”
“That was… probably worrying. And completely uncalled for. And I couldn’t warn you, it happened so suddenly—”
Draco’s hand curls around Harry’s cock, and he realises that somewhere, Draco had slicked it with lube. It’s probably Conjured because it doesn’t smell like anything at all, but the slide of it is exquisite along the length of Harry’s dick. Harry’s eyes roll back a little as frissons of pleasure tingle across his spine, down his abdomen, raising the short hairs along the nape of his neck. He goes slow at first, long, tight slides of his soft palm. When he can’t take the slow-burning pleasure of it any longer, he bites into Draco’s shoulder, the easiest accessible part of Draco and moans.
It’s large—every room of this villa is large and spacious, uncluttered by furniture or vanity—and the honey-gold of the sunlight poured into it lingers long into the evening. It gets its name from the large curtains hanging from the pelmets of the gorgeous floor-to-ceiling windows, embroidered by a Malfoy ancestor’s painstaking hand.
When he’s somewhat presentable, he opens the door with the intention of going to the toilet for a slash and to brush his teeth– his mouth tastes like sandpaper– and stops short immediately. The voices he had heard below are much clearer now and while he had been right in guessing Hermione was talking at her usual speed, the other voice comes as a nasty surprise. He would know that particular posh, aristocratic drawl anywhere in a crowd, he could pick it out from ten voices and would turn the other way and walk away as soon as he did.
“Someone like me and think what, Potter?” He asks, trying to sound indifferent and failing miserably. The words come out choked and harsh and far too expressive for the situation at hand. “That I might deserve something that isn’t you fucking brutalising my arse on the daily–“
“These are good people, Malfoy,” she says quietly. “And I don’t say that because they saved the world. I say that because Harry was my friend when everyone called me Loony Lovegood and stole my things and made fun of the Quibbler. Because Ron pushed me to join Healing School when I needed something, anything to tide me over the death of my friends. Because Hermione taught me charms that kept out strangers from my drawers and strange boys from my bed. These are good people.” She gives him a long, hard stare. “But you? You’ve given me pain. You started calling me Loony Lovegood, you gave Hyacinth Dartmouth the idea of taking my things, the oddities I like to collect and put them out of my reach where the whole school would see them and laugh at them. You sent hate mail to the Quibbler office. I owe you nothing at all but I am telling you, I am advising you to go see someone because I can see you need it.”
“She’s going out with Seamus but then Seamus is clearly not into it because he’s had a crush on Dean since Second Year, which Ginny knows about, hell, everyone knows about, but Ginny says she doesn’t care, she’s just in it for a spot of fun–”
Harry’s eyes brighten and his expression goes from disappointed to surprised to ridiculously pleased as the light drifts into his eyes indicating he’s figured it out.
Kingsley nods, and Dench waves a Sonorus Charm at Draco’s thought. Despite it, his voice comes out feeble, starved, thready like a fading pulse.
They sit in silence for a few minutes, and Scorpius wonders if he should try to cry and get this pressure off his chest. He doesn’t exactly know how crying would help him to come to terms with his fathers having to die for him to gain eternal peace, but at this point, he’s willing to try anything.
Harry laughs, and fuck, that laugh with the grating edge of his sore throat sounds huskier and lovelier than it has any right to.
If he’s being honest with himself (which he very rarely is), Granger’s idea is intriguing. Everything he had believed in had been shattered to pieces and his foundations shaken to the core. He might as well give Muggles a chance and see where it got him. The idea of doing something, anything to redeem himself that isn’t saying a stuttered I don’t know, I can’t be sure is unhealthily appealing these days. Something… something that will make not going to Azkaban worth it.
Draco draws out a chair, the noise of creaking wood loud in the otherwise silent library. He pulls out his Transfiguration notes when suddenly Granger exclaims, “I forgot! We were supposed to refer to that book McGonagall mentioned in class- Dark Transfigurations. I think there is a copy somewhere, I’ll get it.”
Malfoy drops his fork instead. He’s pale in the face and shaking a little, and Harry refuses to feel bad. All of a sudden, this Malfoy isn’t the one who thanked everyone in front of a packed Wizengamot or the one who refused to identify him at the Manor or the one who lowered his wand on the Astronomy Tower. This is the one who called Hermione a Mudblood from second year, this is the Malfoy who joined the Inquisitorial Squad—Harry’s hand flexes, and he knows the scar screaming
“You seemed to know what to do about it, don’t you know what it is?” He knows, he knows he is being a bastard, a right ungrateful, poncey one at that but he can’t help himself. The shame prickles under his skin, on the back of his neck, behind his eyelids.
The drink almost comes back up, but Potter’s expression smooths over before the mood can sour further. “You will have to come back to Britain,” he says, voice giving away none of his true thoughts on the subject of Draco’s Mark though Draco is certain any of his harsher guesses will land close enough. “People will care here.”
Draco protected all of them yesterday, Draco held together what he considers his family. And Luna, Luna had faced him even after everything he had done, told him the truths and helped him face them. And after that, if there is anywhere they belong, it is here.
“Draco, just, please, just this once, take me at my word instead of dredging up double meanings. I’m not giving you permission, just asking you to consider.”
“He’s Harry Potter. Don’t you think that’s going to hold up better against a hostile Wizengamot instead of two personally invested individuals?”
Malfoy laughs, cruel and bitter. “They won’t let her out of the house,” he says, voice hoarse. “They won’t even let her step onto the grounds. She wrote to me—she’s allowed to write once a month, and she wrote to me saying she’s asked some Auror to water her roses—”
Potter shrugs. There’s light coming from somewhere and his lenses are reflecting it, making his glasses look thicker than they are, obscuring his eyes. “It always looks the same to me.”
The look she sends his way is so grateful that Draco feels slightly embarrassed. “Can you please Floo Ron’s healer and ask her to come over? Tell her it’s an emergency. Healer Choudhury at Mungo’s Mental Maladies.”
. You think you’re the only one who understands those things? You think anyone is fucking fine after the damn War?”
There was a war and they were both soldiers. There is an aftermath and they’re both boys, trying to find their place in the world.
Draco scowls because Potter always knows how to hit the nail on the head even when he doesn’t know he’s holding a hammer. “We have villas,” he says. “One in France, another in Italy. We have some property down in South Africa too—”
Harry’s eyes dart back to him for a split second and Draco doesn’t know if it’s a trick of the light or his yearning, useless imagination that paints those expressive verdant windows in emotions– longing, desperation, hope.
Draco walks around the edge of the bed and stares down at Harry for a second before summoning a length of rope into his hands. When he reaches down to take one of Harry’s wrists in his own, the question is clear in his eyes.
But now the voice isn’t telling him to breathe. The voice is counting, a soft and steady chant of familiar words and numbers… two… three… four… five… There’s a lulling quality to it, and Harry’s brain is still screaming, but not quite as loud as before. The numbers are taking over, weaving into the confusion and smoothing out the edges of his convoluted thoughts carefully, delicately. He’s aware of his eyes and how tightly he’s squinting them, and it doesn’t feel comfortable at all, so he closes them instead.
Whatever he’s expected Potter to say, it had not been that. But then again, his current crisis is centred around Potter basically disregarding all expectations and being someone Draco can’t reconcile with his memories of his schoolyard nemesis, so he gives in and gestures in acceptance.
She nods slightly. Then without any warning at all, she sags in his arms and collapses against his chest. Surprised and almost on the verge of panicking himself, he makes strange motions with his hands behind her back, not quite knowing what to do with them when he realises his shirt is wet.
But Harry doesn’t leave. Doesn’t pull on his clothes or shut Draco down, or say in those closed, clipped Auror tones that he must leave now for personal reasons.
Draco has a mad urge to find Harry’s Muggles, hex them into oblivion, make them remember again and then slowly, torturously, kill them until their remains were unworthy of even being scavenged. He says as much and Harry shakes his head with a slight laugh. It’s strained but genuine.
It had taken Harry a minute to realise that the nervousness stemmed from the man’s possible awe of being in his presence. Familiar stirrings of anger frothed in his mind.
“I saved you,” Potter says bluntly. “Over and over. The flames. Begging all those corresponding testimonies off of Hermione and Ron and Ginny. Dean and Luna were more than willing, but some of the people whose memories are included in your Pensieve were less than willing to help a bloke who called them names all throughout school, hexed them in the hallways, turned them over to Umbridge. My testimony itself, though more than one person objected to me standing up for you.”
He looks at Potter and he knows his voice is shaking because the words come out strangled, “I–I can’t.”
He’s alive until he’s not, he’s breathing until he’s not, lungs burning, eyes stinging, mouth open as he tries to draw in air that won’t enter, his hands stretching into the emptiness of his surroundings, trying to find an anchor that isn’t there.
He’s being selfish, he knows, by not handing Harry the papers. He should set Harry free. He should let Harry leave his memories of a dead son and a dead love behind, move on and fall in love again.
‘I went with Bill,’ Harry says and immediately Draco looks reassured. In the years that Draco and Harry have been together, the Weasley sibling Draco gets along best with is Bill. They talk for ages about curses and potions and magical theory, all of which almost everyone except for Hermione finds as dull as a rusty knife. Draco trusts Bill’s knowledge and opinion on these things.
Taking the tea and cupping his trembling palms around the warmth of it, he turns his head away from Granger who has moved on to the couch to sit beside him. Draco can’t bring himself to meet her eyes
He stands in the doorway for a long minute, surveying the room. Without warning or explanation, he violently lurches and stumbles in. The swinging door crashes shut. If Draco’s still in the house, there’s no possible way he didn’t hear that noise.
“I don’t know,” Harry says. He cringes when his voice comes out scratchy and hoarse, rough around the consonants, breaking on the low sounds of the vowels. “It happens.”
On the 2nd of January, Harry drags Draco to the Portkey Office and books two to Mumbai, India for March.
“If you’re still talking, I clearly have a long way to go,” Harry responds and before Draco can really process it, he’s the one flat on his back with Harry straddling his waist, intently facing him.
Harry’s blown pupils darken and his teeth come out to sink into the soft flesh of his full lower lip. On anyone else, the act would seem cheaply coy, but Harry does it so instinctively that the ache in Draco’s balls tightens.
“I did all that?” He finally manages, clenching his eyes shut, powering through the pain in his skull.
The pounding on the door gets louder with every passing second, and when stuffing his head under the pillow to block it out does not help, Draco’s resolve breaks.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, and though Harry has heard him say those words before, they still sound so unfamiliar. A path overgrown with woods, never treaded, being forcefully cleared to make way for Draco’s determination. “I’m sorry, please don’t leave.”
She cuts herself off, and the look on her face claws at Draco’s heartstrings. He waits, and she doesn’t disappoint, taking a deep breath to continue, “I always thought he’d end up being… unfaithful. Do you know what it’s like, being dubbed the Golden Couple? Expectations, the madness of the press, the events and the constant stalking– I knew it would come, but I wanted him anyway.”
They had discussed it at length after Draco had gotten over his shock. It had been a pleasant if somewhat stilted discussion, given that they had skirted the War and Voldemort and Potter right up until…
“This place looks like something out of a history book,” Draco hears behind him. Potter’s voice is a little awe-struck and a little delighted and Draco rejoices internally. Moreover, Potter’s not wrong. There are plenty of towns like this smattered all over Europe, but this little one, poised at a height, overlooking the gentle simplicity of the Tuscan countryside, seems to retain some of the old-world nostalgia of its genesis.
—he wants to be buried in the soft grey of a graveyard on a winter morning, held in place by Draco’s eyes, bid farewell by the comforting scent of Hermione’s hair and Ron’s coffee.
The Great Hall has been decorated the way it had been for the Yule Ball in Fourth Year. There is fake snow underfoot that feels soft and powdery, the candles are bobbing gleefully overhead and the starry sky visible has occasional shooting stars. It isn’t Christmas yet but the air is full of Christmas spirit, laughter and the smell of mulled wine.
Malfoy clenches his jaw. Looks away, looks back down at his hands. “I was merely curious about whether you might have changed your mind.”
“What–“ He cuts himself off before he can ask. He doesn’t think he could handle an answer. Worse still, the lack of one.
August passes in a haze of summer sunshine and Harry’s brown skin turning gold in it. They find new cafes to love and new waitresses who speak broken and accented English. The receptionist at their little motel is now a regular fixture of their mornings and they’ve both taken to wishing her a very good morning when they leave the keys to their room with her for safekeeping.
It was undeniably true that even after the heavy War Guilt fines and the many restrictions on the Malfoy vaults, Draco had enough gold for three generations to live comfortably without working. However, this wasn’t a prospect he particularly cherished– socialite life of leisure and gossip had seemed akin to suicide at the time and he had desperately sought opportunities to rebuild his life.
“Would you like to sit?” He asks awkwardly, gesturing to the other armchair by the fire. She moves over, silently and gracefully and sits down.
“I have something to ask you,” Harry tells him, when they’re back at the hotel room, lying side by side on the upturned duvet.
“All of this,” Draco tries to explain. “Coming over with the food, telling me you’ll help. Rescuing me.”
“So after I dropped you off, I came back and he there another fit so I told him that Ron and I were leaving because we… because we couldn’t live with a ghost anymore. He was a ghost! He was nothing but a ghost with all his dead drifting around him, lurking in the shadows. He was becoming a shadow himself! And I love him, I love him so much I couldn’t watch it anymore. So I told him, I told him we would leave. I told him we would leave.” She chokes on her sobs and gasps and coughs a few times before starting to cry.
When he looks up to stretch his neck, he almost screams. In the doorway, the pale figure of Luna Lovegood has silently appeared and has been watching him for Merlin knows how long.
“I’m in love,” he whispers into the leather of the beanbag. “He’s married, planning for a family, and I’m in love with him.”
So when he finds himself climbing the spiral staircase with tears spilling down his cheeks, he knows its probably one of the worst ideas he’s had in a while.
When Harry wakes up again, the sluggishness has receded, as has the headache. His throat is still parched but there is a glass of water on the bedside table to fix that up. He looks around to realise they put him up in a guest bedroom, one of the only ones fixed up to house a guest. Unable to adjust to the feeling of being a guest in his own home, he gets up, stretches his legs and finds his way out onto the landing.
“Did you tell him you wanted it?” She asks this time, no doubt trying to solve the puzzle, answer the question, balance the equation. That’s what she does.
He’s been having quite a few bad days as of late, though, so he thinks about it quite often. The court case. Breakfast. Draco. His wedding ring.
Luna’s face breaks out into a radiant smile and Harry feels the remaining pieces of his heart break further into fragments so small he doubts he can ever be whole again.
Draco stands there, unmoving and steady, cool eyes surveying the room. Scorpius tries to perceive it from Draco’s perspective and winces. What had once been a bright and cheery bedroom looks more like a private hospital room that’s recently been cleared out. The bed is pristine with white sheets. The curtains are drawn. There’s nothing personal in any part of it. Someone’s been here and cleaned it up to remove all discernible traces of Scorpius. He suspects it was Rose.
“Okay,” Draco says after a few minutes of silence. That’s a common word in his repertoire now, a filler for the times when Harry’s grace leaves him speechless and spellbound. “Okay.”
Theodore Nott had been another underage Death-Eater, similarly acquitted of war crimes by Neville and Luna for participating in the Final Battle against the Death-Eaters. He had gone to Mungo’s a month after the War, complaining of severe chest pain but had been sent home with medication. Two weeks later he had been found dead in his bedroom.
He does not want to tell Harry about Voldemort’s time in the Manor. Maybe someday, but the wounds are still fresh and on Draco’s worst days, when nothing makes sense and he misses home, they bleed him dry.
“We had a long time to get used to it,” Draco murmurs eventually, and though his voice sounds confident, his eyes are lost at sea. If a sailor losing control of his ship were to catch sight of gathering storm clouds on the horizon, the look Draco has on his fine-boned face would not be out of place. Scorpius realises that whatever has stopped within him might as well have stopped within Draco too. He seems just as empty.
He turns back around in Draco’s arms and presses a sweet, soft kiss to his lips. “Can we be done for today?” He entreats. Draco nods immediately.
Scorpius remembers the cold feeling that had grasped him when he was seven, looking at his parents retire to separate bedrooms after dinner.
Usually, the direction of his thoughts seem to run in a hotter, heavier slide, towards more passionate activities, towards more touch and less gentleness. But this—
“I need to pack,” Harry says, pointedly, and oh, oh, now Draco jerks away from him as though he’s been burned, as though he’s been slapped, as though his world has shifted out from beneath his feet.
Draco’s hands fly up to claw at his throat, but Harry’s rough magic is unrelenting. He feels the air burn in his lungs. It’s a struggle, one rougher than any Draco’s used to, just to breathe.
Eventually, they both nod in acquiescence. Harry gives Scorpius a watery smile, presses a kiss to his forehead and leaves, shutting the door softly behind him. Draco waits for his steps to fade down the hallway before sinking back down and letting his head drop onto the bed. His shoulders shake, his hands clench in the bedsheets. Scorpius lets him cry uninterrupted.
What he hadn’t expected however, was a flustered Potter asking him while walking out of Defence a couple of days later, “Will you go to the Ball with me, Malfoy? Hermione insists that I have to go and she won't agree to me going without someone, something about Wizarding etiquette that I know nothing about and honestly, the first person I thought of was you. Of course it's alright if you already have a date..."
“It’s good to know, Draco,” is all she says though he knows by now that she probably has far more to actually tell him.
Parkinson breaks the silence. “If I’d known this was what you meant when you said you had matters keeping you busy, I would not have come.”
Harry holds up a hand to stop Malfoy’s rushed word vomit. “She’s not my girlfriend,” he says. “She hasn’t been, since I left—for, for seventh year.”
‘I could never, um, ask you for it. So I left it here and thought I’d forget about it.’ He sighs. ‘It’s not like our sex life was ever missing anything so I, um, didn’t even think about it all that much,’ he hastens to clarify.
You… you’re you and your friends are supposed to be noble and good and Gryffindor and I…” he trails off.
Draco stays with Granger late into the night. She sits on the bed in the room Weasley is sleeping in and he sits in an armchair by the fire. Harry is with Lovegood in another room and Lovegood has sent a Patronus saying Harry woke up for a while and in conversation consented to therapy as long as the Mind Healers were discreet and didn’t give him special treatment simply because he was the Saviour. And then, he had gone back to sleep.
Draco also knows he’s on his way from ‘mildly tipsy’ to ‘absolutely sloshed’ because that is about the time when he starts making observations about things like Blaise’s fingers and his wants and desires and maybe the cut of his jeans and the fit of them on his unfairly toned arse.
“You don’t have to be an Auror right away,” Hermione says. “You could take a year off, figure things out for yourself, get your head on straight.”
But on other days, the guilt morphs into frustrated anger laced with learning, still strangling but somewhat sweeter because Potter’s patient explanations wring it out of him. It’s proof that Potter talks to him enough for Draco to now understand what merits guilt and somehow the warm weight of Potter’s regard and unrelenting faith is heavier than the wince of shame as he takes in his inherited surroundings.
For almost a decade, Scorpius has told himself they fell out of love when Draco told a jury that Harry Potter’s personal obsession with Gregor Selwyn’s case had led to a misconception and a baseless arrest. That they fell out of love when the furious witness Harry Potter had told the Chief Warlock that Gregor Selwyn’s personal ties to the Malfoy family were blurring his understanding of the law.
Harry starts laughing again. “If I tell you when I had the time, I think you might get up and walk away.”
Scorpius buries his face in his hands and groans. “Do you have any idea how bloody awful it is to die and still not know what happens after Death?”
He subsides, because he’s exhausted himself of words though he still has too much to say. So much that it’s whirlpooling in his brain.
Sometimes when he was alone with Scorpius, his son would look at him, dead in the eyes and say in a tone so matter of fact that Draco would be torn between laughter and desperation, “You need to get out more, Father. Meet other people. You can’t kiss a file, and though I’m sure nothing would please you better, you can’t make love to the law.”
No one had been willing to go against Harry Potter’s testimony in court. No lawyer worth his salt wanted to tarnish the reputation of the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
‘Tell Terry to hold down the fort for me, will you?’ He tells her. ‘Deputy Head and he still acts like he hasn’t stepped out of the bullpen.’
“But she named me Draco because she wanted her child to be as tied to the Blacks as the Malfoys. And no Malfoy would object to a name as odd and pretentious as Draco. For a man named Abraxas, a grandson named Draco was the pride and joy of the family.
It is soundless and she is barely moving but her entire body is trembling and where her face is pressed against his chest, there is a growing wet spot of tears. Awkwardly he rubs her back, hoping it helps, praying she recovers soon enough to do something about the other two thirds of the trio and so worried about her that he can barely think straight. If a few months ago someone had told him he would have a sobbing Granger cradled against his chest, a stunned Potter and a catatonic Weasley in the same room and he would be more worried about them than his own wellbeing, he would have hexed them hard enough to land them in a different continent. But right now, he can’t help but be grateful that he stepped in when he did.
There’s a charged second of silence after which Draco says, “What about my wand?” and Potter says at the same time, “Will you show me sometime?”
Down the long, ugly Sectumsempra scar, there are hickeys lined up, red bruises and purpling skin and it is so unbelievably hot that his cock grows impossibly harder. Harry feels the change and gives an amused hum against the skin of his hipbone before pinching it with his teeth and gently nipping, causing Draco to almost arch straight off the bed at the assault of conflicting pleasure and pain on his nerves.
“Would you mind if I partnered with you today?” she asks, speaking so quickly that Draco thinks she’s speaking another language initially. “Harry isn’t coming to class and I don’t think we can brew Trisstesia by ourselves. It’s the sort of thing that needs a partner.”
There is legacy in every step of the city and with the rest of their lives stretching out before them, who Harry and Draco are here is a legacy in itself.
She’d died three days later, his secrets twined with hers in the cavern of her thin, frail chest and he had kissed her cold hand farewell before drawing the white shroud over her heart and his confessions.
He thinks back to the last two days, Malfoy’s careful lack of antagonism, his most offensive behaviours being astonishment at the upkeep of a Muggle establishment and his lack of understanding of Muggle money.
smirks the way his left arm has been tied down—the inner forearm exposed to every voyeuristic eye taking pleasure in what this prince has been reduced to.
Malfoy bypasses him with a graceful tilt of his sloping shoulders to avoid bumping into Harry again. Harry doesn’t know what propels him to say the next words, but they come out anyway, lingering in the musty air of Knockturn.
“Justice,” Draco says, the word coming out twisted and wrong. As though it’s a foreign language his mouth is not accustomed to speaking. “Justice for a Marked Death Eater.”
A dam bursts within Parkinson. She looks up, jaw clenched, bobbed hair swinging, lower lip wobbling dangerously and says in a harsh, grating whisper, “I’m sorry, alright? For—for what I said. In the battle. I’m sorry. I thought he would win and I thought it was our only hope to stay alive and you were just seventeen and hiding behind your Gryffindors and I thought—” A solitary tear escapes and she wipes it away violently. “I’m sorry. And I didn’t want him to win, I just thought he would. All I wanted was to stay alive.”
Granger sounds apologetic,  “I’m his best friend. He won’t tell another soul but he isn’t too great at keeping things from us.” She pauses before adding, “I can see the edges of the charm. If I concentrate.” She looks at him out of the corner of her eye. “I’m not concentrating.”
Sunday roasts remind him of Harry on Tuesday evenings with his flashing eyes and aggressive thrusts and his cruel, cutting words that Draco never remembers through the fog of lust and pleasure and agony. Sunday roasts remind him of everything he’s lost, of everything he never had in the first place.
Draco has often wondered how Harry’s collection of friends turned out to be so charming. His friends are a motley lot– Pansy’s hard to like on her best days and Blaise is far too self centred to give a damn about anyone’s opinions. Theo’s– well, Theo’s dead, but even when he had been alive, it had been a difficult pursuit to wipe the perpetual sneer of his face and after Crabbe’s death, Goyle swam into a vat of vodka and never emerged.
Blaise sees, of course he does. There’s no way to not see what Potter– even his name– does to Draco.
When Draco stirs and curls in on himself slightly with a shiver, Harry heaves a sigh and stoops down to pick him up. Draco is definitely heavier now than he was at eighteen, or even twenty five but years of Auror training have increased Harry’s strength enough to be able to lift Draco with ease.
. At forty two, as a man, he’s sharper, greyer and taller, but at the end of the day, it all boils down to being a Malfoy left with no choice.
And Draco can’t hold back anymore. He surges up to drag Harry into a breathless, open mouthed kiss and thrusts his hips up until his cock comes in contact with Harry’s rock hard one.
Harry’s eyes flicker briefly over to Ron’s, heart pounding with gratitude. Trust his best friends to know what he’s terrified of. Trust them to reach into the aching parts of him and draw away the doubts.
They have vaults in France too, but Draco can’t access them yet because his father still hasn’t signed the necessary papers or died for Draco to have unfettered access.
The little half-smirk Potter sends his way is enough to kick his heart into overdrive. When Potter says, “I’ll find you anyway,” Draco turns away and tries not to blush.
Potter groans, long and loud, and Draco is convinced that even if the walls hadn’t been criminally thin, he’d have heard that particular expression of ecstasy. As it is, he’s certain the whole motel’s already heard it. It’s embarrassing in a deliciously crude way, and as his cheeks flame hot, his hand grows more insistent against his erection until he can’t convince himself any longer that he’s trying to will it away and not wank it away.
,” Draco had said, wiping off the flecks of blood from Scorpius’ chin and neck without flinching. “Lest you come back to haunt me.”
“Granger, can you please Apparate me out of here?” Before Hermione can even open her mouth to respond, Harry beats her to it.
All the fight seems to go out of the woman. Her whole face just droops and she closes her eyes and says, “Yes. I guessed.”
The woman—Anita Cosgrove—stands up and clears her throat. It’s rather obvious she isn’t entirely sure what to say. Not for lack of confidence or competence—Dench had buried his face in his hands when he’d heard she would be representing the Ministry—but because countering Harry Potter has become exponentially more daunting ever since the Order of Merlin, First Class has been added beside his name.
“‘M hair,” he mumbles, trying to warn Draco, sure that he doesn’t want three days worth of gunk on his nails. Draco simply shushes him and keeps doing what he’s doing and the protest dies on Harry’s lips. It feels too good to give up.
When he wakes up again, he notices Hermione’s head is resting against the headboard and her eyes are closed. The even, steady breathing indicates she has gone to sleep too and it is only then that Harry notices the weight on his stomach. He cranes his neck carefully to avoid too much jostling and can’t help but smile fondly at the sight before him. Ron’s head is on his stomach, one hand splayed across Harry’s leg and the other on his own chest. His mouth is open and he is mumbling something under his breath incomprehensibly. But the air is peaceful and quiet and Harry, even though not particularly sleepy anymore, closes his eyes and thanks Merlin for the fact that Ron and Hermione are the ones he chose. It’s in moments like these he understands how important it was that they chose him right back.
Potter raises his beer mug and an eyebrow. “A year isn’t a trifle, Malfoy. You can’t just wander off beyond the border without a plan and blink at the sun.”
And then, Harry’s hands are on his zipper, and Harry’s fucking eyes are still on him, and Draco is lost.
Potter laughs, a low and rich sound, different from the previous evening’s mildly tipsy mirth but thrilling nevertheless. After a few seconds, which is nowhere near enough time for Draco to revel in the overwhelming warmth of it, he cuts himself off. Draco turns to see him standing in the middle of the street looking positively mortified. “Sorry,” he says, eyes wide, lower lip caught between his white teeth. “You told me that and I started laughing, that’s so insensitive—”
‘I just want you back.’ This time, Draco’s voice breaks over the words and a lone tear slides down his cheek.
After a few charged seconds of tense staring, Hermione spins on her heel and walks out of the kitchen without another word. Her fists are clenched and Harry isn’t used to her being this way, losing her patience, getting angry with him. They never do, Ron and Hermione. They're always patient, always calm, always rational.
“Learn,” he says, finally. Draco finds himself the startled recipient of the full weight of Potter’s stare. “Change, grow, whatever. Rehabilitate. Not be… who you were.”
He steps into the dark hallway, passes the living room, steps into the kitchen. There is no one in the kitchen.
Granger continues, “And there’s always the bit where Ginny and Dean went out for a while and now it’s all so awkward that no one can figure out whom to approach.”
Even when everyone else makes an active effort to not acknowledge his admittedly rather forgettable presence (something Draco is thankful for, given his current… circumstances), Potter seems to not take the hint, focusing only on Draco regardless of what else is going on. He wonders if Potter does it only to be contrary.
He can barely think under the onslaught of Draco’s teasing yet relentless ministrations but eventually comes up with a breathless ‘Auror.’
Hermione laughs lightly and Harry wants to comment, well we could small talk, hey Malfoy, how’re your parents? but holds himself back. Something tells him it won’t sit well with either Hermione or Malfoy. And after today, seeing him talk passionately about a project with Hermione on a level neither Harry nor Ron can indulge, he inexplicably doesn’t want to make the prat’s life more miserable. The insults… well, they’ll probably never stop occurring to him. It is Malfoy at the end of the day.
“Once a swot, always a swot,” Draco had said, and first Granger’s eyes had flashed fire before she’d realised he was joking.
“You got the hots for me when I was in the kitchen with a wand in your face, shouting about your dad? Draco, we really need to talk,” he manages between gasps and deep breaths before busting into laughter again.
Draco chooses not to comment on Harry’s tone or his choice of words. It’s the right decision apparently because Harry sags a little and brings his own hands to rest on top of Draco’s. “I’m sorry,” he says. “I just, I don’t know how to talk about this but I think I have to. I know I don’t have to but I much rather would. I know it doesn’t seem that way but I…” he flounders but stops stuttering over his words at Draco’s reassuring squeeze.
These are the things people think when they’re dying, Scorpius wonders into the dusky darkness of the room.
“I have evidence that Mr Malfoy regretted most of the decisions he was coerced into through loyalty to his family—a sentiment hopefully most of us sympathise with—and the Dark Lord’s manipulations. He was tasked with letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts at the risk of the Dark Lord killing his family should he fail. He was sixteen, and searching for a chink in the armoured chainmail of Hogwarts’ defences.
P.S. Harry and Ron really did send their regards in the morning but right now there’s just Harry and he made a face.
“What?” Scorpius asks, unnerved when the unblinking stare has been directed at him for far too long. Sometimes they seem more snake than person. They’re neither, but it’s eerie either way to never know what precisely it is you’re looking at. Scorpius had always thought a face was a face, even under glamour charms or Polyjuice. It was still something underneath it all. This seems to genuinely be an unsettling mirage without any underlying reality. “Did I say something wrong?”
Undressing a partner has always been something intimate and glorious for Draco. It is no different this time as he unbuttons Harry’s black cotton shirt, each fastening falling open to reveal inch by glorious inch of brown skin that makes Draco’s mouth water. There’s the smell of the cologne Harry uses, strong and heady, filling Draco’s senses and his mouth falls open, lips parting subconsciously as his tongue flicks out to wet his lips.
“Hermione is alright. Distraught, anxious but comparatively alright. Ron is sleeping but it’s natural sleep. And you have Draco Malfoy to thank for all of that.”
“Art in general,” Draco says, closing his eyes and thinking of the way even a walk in an innocuous side street seems to brim with artistry and elegance in Florence. “But yeah, Michelangelo.”
“Potter!” Draco exclaims, scandalised. Then as an afterthought he adds, “I believe I was talking about preference.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco says. And it’s a half truth, because while Draco knows what Potter might be suggesting– why the emotion? Why the sounds? Why the words and the comfort and the– but he doesn’t know why Potter’s asking him. He didn’t initiate this strange, slow pace, didn’t ask for Harry to treat him like a lover.
“I didn’t forget, Malfoy.” Her smile had turned positively mischievous. “If you agree, we’ll be each other’s first project.”
She stops moving. It hits him for the first time she probably hadn’t known he was there. When she walks over to stand above him, he peers at her sheepishly through his eyelashes with an expression he sincerely hopes conveys his desire to be forgiven for what he said to her. She merely waits, hands on her hips, eyes focused on him.
“Yes,” Hermione says solemnly. “I wrote back to you. We spoke about the day we met in Diagon, remember?”
Potter nods again. His expression is blank, the soft lights in the library reflecting off the glass of his spectacles.
“Tell me if this is real or not, Gianni,” Malfoy says, wild laughter curled into the spaces between his words.
He knows it would be a waste to leave Ron anything. It would never be touched, only cried over. He knows better than to try and leave Hugo anything– he doesn’t want Draco to hate him even more in death by trying to take over his godson. Ginny probably wouldn’t even get the owl letting her know of what she’s inherited, and even if she did, she wouldn’t know what to do with it in the Amazon rainforests.
“Everyone saw it coming,” Harry says. Draco isn’t surprised. “Luna apparently keeps up with Gin, calls her all the time, Ron has been waiting for me to say something, Hermione just shrugged and said it had to happen at some point.”
“I need to see a Healer regularly. A Mind Healer,” Draco says after a while. “And I’d like you to come with me for some sessions so you know what to do if things get out of control.”
Harry pulls out his finger and pushes in again, burying himself a little further and Draco’s hands fly forward, digging into Harry’s smooth, taut shoulders with an iron grip. He can feel the muscles bunch and flex, parts of a well oiled machine. There’s magic roiling and surging under those smooth expanses of skin and it flows to pool around Draco’s hands with easy familiarity.
“No, you haven’t. I’m here, I’m real and I understand why you would think I’m not but I am.” Potter says these words and Draco realises he must have spoken out loud. He doesn’t even have control over his speech now. Brilliant.
When Draco finds the coffee cup and the newspaper, he stubs his toe on the edge of the table in his surprised distraction. Fairly certain that Harry would not poison him, he takes a sip. The taste throws him back seven years when they were still going strong, still so desperately in love, still sleeping in each other’s arms.
They don’t acknowledge it, but when Harry pulls away his pupils are blown dark. “Lie back,” he says, and the dangerous undercurrent to his words send shivers sparking down Draco’s body and gooseflesh rises on his arms. “Hands behind your head, and
“Next Christmas won’t be so lonely for either of you,” Harry vows. Draco turns towards him in surprise.
Draco can’t help the involuntary smile creeping onto his face. He isn’t sure he wants to. Dead or not, Scorpius is his pride and joy. Dead or not, he’s still a father. There are some things that
Potter smiles, that charming, genuine thing that has Draco a little breathless and a little dazed. “Don’t worry Malfoy,” he says. “Neither am I.”
Lovegood arrives by their table, a serene smile in place, blonde hair twisted up on her head, the edges of the owl feather earrings she’s wearing brushing her bare shoulders.
“Compassion,” Harry interrupts. “That’s what Voldemort didn’t have. He had everything else. Devotion, loyalty, hell—
Hermione looks to be at a complete loss. It is such an unexpected and unfamiliar expression on her face that Harry feels helplessness tugging at him. “It, it wasn’t okay. And I know I should be happy or maybe at least satisfied that he’s, he’s suffering, it’s what I thought I wanted to see but…” he trails off, unsure of how he feels about the situation. Dismay, regret, anger, frustration. Guilt. No joy. No satisfaction.
“Dad’s looking likelier by the minute,” Scorpius says, looking down at his hands. “Father looks like he could do with twelve more bottles of that stuff, some vodka and a few tough cases against the American legal system. I don’t see
The lump in Draco’s throat is so large that he can’t do more than hum without fearing his voice breaking into sobs midway. He needs to stop. Needs to stop thinking about the green eyes and the wide smile, the wild magic cracking in the air like wind before a thunderstorm. Needs to stop thinking about Harry or Potter or his dick or his arse or his long, curling eyelashes.
They sit in silence for a few minutes. She sips her tea and Draco stares dispassionately at his hot chocolate. The mere thought of putting it to his lips makes him nauseous.
The minute Harry steps back to let Draco through, he steps in and uses his slight height advantage to grab Harry’s face entirely by surprise. His eyes widen fractionally before Draco is brushing his lips across Harry’s, gently, tenderly, completely at odds with the bruising force with which he keeps ahold of his jaw. After one second of frozen surprise, Harry sighs just slightly against his lips before parting his lips delicately to let Draco’s tongue slip through. They push and pull against each other, Harry’s arms coming up to twine together at the nape of Draco’s neck and Draco’s grip loosening on Harry’s jaw but remaining possessively there none the less as his other hand brushes long fingers through Harry’s tangled hair.
When Draco stumbles in through the Manor’s Floo, his forehead is beaded with sweat and his hands are trembling violently, jerking in the uncontrollable fashion that usually signifies he has gone far too long without a Calming Draught.
“…we need concrete plans before we present anything to the Council!” He is saying, voice rising slightly. Harry hasn’t registered what he was saying before that, having tuned out thinking of Malfoy but it sounds like Hermione and him are arguing.
It is agonising but when he is finally used to the feeling of three thick fingers inside him, he raises his head and says, “Please. I’m ready now. Please?”
He swivels his head at the painful, stretched angle required to look at Potter the best he can with his feet still shackled to the poles of the chair and says, “I would like to apologise to Harry Potter for having been a… bully and a bigot. Alongside him, I would like to extend the same apology to countless others who have been subjected to the whims and fancies and privileged rages and outright bullying of a boy who thought he owned the world. And last, but not least, I would like to… thank Harry Potter. And Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas and Ginevra Weasley and all the others who have submitted their memories and testimonies speaking for me. I… did not… that is to say I… thank them. For it all. And regardless of the respected Wizengamot’s decision, both my apology and my gratitude stand.”
It hits the wall and the sound of shattering glass fills the emptiness of the flat and for a brief, blissful moment, the pounding stops.
As for the armchairs– only Scorpius and his fathers know with certainty the strategy behind the way they have been stationed in the room– one close enough for his hair to be caressed, the other for his hand to be held.
Whatever Harry had expected of Malfoy, it hadn’t been what he immediately proceeds to do, which is smile bright enough to rival the sun at its best and bend down to lift the squawking elf into his arms and spin him around.
“That timeline doesn’t have to be within my exile if you don’t want it to be,” Draco says. Harry still holds his breath when the word comes up in conversation—
He nods. He understands the importance of taking up any job available to fill up time that would otherwise be spent spiralling down the murky alley of dangerous thoughts and rabid memories.
“Well—” begins the man—Barrister Dench, Harry notes—“Testifying for my client is a bit of a risk to one’s reputation as an upstanding man of wizarding society.”
When Weasley turns up at his door looking furious and ready to use a Killing Curse, Draco knows he is in for it. He opens the door and braces himself for a Stinging Hex or a Mutilation Spell or an exploding potion being thrown in his face but instead receives a strong sock to his jaw that makes him crash to the floor, hit his head and see stars. Weasley crouches down, heals his jaw with a rapid Healing spell, waits a few seconds for it to set and then without warning, socks him in the jaw again.
‘There’s a cabin I have up in Scotland. Quite close to Hogwarts, actually. Lots of fresh air, pine trees and chirping birds- I think you’ll like it.’
This time, Draco gasps, and though he instinctively tries to bite down on it, Harry grips his jaw in the nick of time and brushes his thumb across Draco’s parted lips. It’s so intimate, the gesture so pure and unriddled with history or anxiety or any of the usual fears and fantasies plaguing Draco to death, that his throat grows hot and tight and the tide within him transforms into something like a bottomless reservoir of want and need and
In an instant, he is up and heading for the door, paying no heed to Hermione’s Draco, wait! When Harry rushes out into the living room, he is just in time to say the tail end of Malfoy’s blue robes disappearing into the green flames of the Floo fire.
He can’t meet Harry’s eyes, so he keeps his head turned away, trying his damnedest to not let more embarrassing tears slip.
‘About that,’ Harry begins and hesitates. Draco’s eyes narrow. ‘I might have made arrangements for tomorrow.’
Without really thinking it through, his Malfoy manners hidden in some corner of his addled brain, Draco gets up and walks in the direction Granger had disappeared in. He remembers the way to the kitchen and when he reaches, she is standing before a boiling kettle, tapping her foot.
If his magic worked anymore, he would have looked up the Transfiguration charms himself, but it doesn’t, so that’s pointless. He’s been meaning to ask Aunt Hermione discreetly when she comes to visit next– he’s forgotten the last few times.
He doesn’t want to be alone but he has absolutely no one to turn to right now. Hermione shouldn’t have to deal with his guilt over his own faults that had led to Dumbledore’s death. His friends… the full weight of their absence comes crashing down on him.
Harry had not prepared himself for the man he’s faced with, nothing abstract about the sharp lines of his stomach or the sharp slant of his smile or the crooked twist of his eyebrows. Harry is falling, fast and hard and irrevocably in love.
Draco nods and tries to steer clear of the line of his thought that seems to fixate on the combination of Potter and eating in the same sentence.
When Harry opens his eyes with open hunger and longing plain in them, he thinks Harry understands him. He hopes he isn’t wrong because if he is, it would bring him to his knees but he thinks Harry feels the same way.
In his dreams, Draco still talks about Anthony Filibuster and Florentina Fortescue’s endeavours to make her father’s recipes public which are being thwarted by Florian II. They talk while Scorpius plays with his toy broomstick in the garden and they talk while Scorpius attempts to climb Harry’s foot like a tree.
“I don’t want to,” Potter says, the first words he’s spoken since he decided to tell Draco his perfectly reasonable argument downstairs was unwarranted. “I like being here.”
Harry shakes his head, grin widening. “Any more of those and the blueberry muffins I brought are going back to Grimmauld with me.”
Friendship to him has always been something either to be approved or disapproved of so this easy relationship with her is both novel and strangely satisfying. It's so
It was a terrible analogy, Draco isn’t sure why Dench is a practicing barrister if his grip of the language is the way that it is, but he understood the point being made well enough. No testimony in the wizarding world could be better for one’s trial than the Saviour’s. Except perhaps Albus Dumbledore’s, but since Draco is almost single-handedly responsible for that particular individual’s death, it definitely isn’t one he’s getting. He doubts Dumbledore would testify either way if he were alive. Crafty old man with his crafty blue eyes and his crafty spells. Sometimes Draco wants to dig him out of his white grave and shake his skeletal shoulders and ask him why he didn’t save Draco though he knew.
Harry is numb. Frozen in shock. He had stopped feeling the jolts of shock when she mentioned triggering Ron and Hermione and had entered into a feeling of total, freezing, continued numbness.
“You’re a hallucination,” Draco tells Potter firmly. “Even if you aren’t blurry around the edges, even if you seem as real as you did three days ago, you’re definitely not real. You’re not standing in front of me right now.”
It is at this moment that Draco’s resolve breaks. He had wanted to keep his distance, let none of his desire show through, let none of his wanting push Harry away from him. If he couldn’t have him the way he wanted him, he could at least have him as a friend. But when Harry smiles at him so openly, so beautifully, like something out of a perfect daydream, Draco can’t hold himself back.
He tells her as much when the time comes and she looks surprised at first but then a little pleased.
Harry is a whirlwind. He is twirling about the room, a maniacal glint in his eye. One lens of his spectacles has a crack running down I, making him look broken in a strange way but what is truly terrifying is the smile on his face. It is a grim, determined smile and as he aims his wand at a wall, the plaster comes flying off and hits Weasley in the side. He falls to the floor, still blank, still murmuring and Granger only shrieks louder but Harry is completely deaf to everything else. He keeps aiming at different parts of the room, twisting and turning this way and that.
‘I want,’ says Harry, pushing his voice an octave lower, ‘to taste you on my lips, in my mouth. I want to feel you against my cheek.’
Without knowing how to stop himself, he pulls Harry closer until they’re pressed bodily against each other, skin pressed tantalisingly against skin. Draco’s shirt is still hanging off his shoulders and Harry has lost his T-shirt at some point during the process and Draco can’t help but lean in to kiss Harry senseless.
“Nor do we, mate,” Scorpius says, gloomily. “For instance, Father knows she wants to shag him, and that she’s probably a shit therapist, and he also knows he won’t ever sleep with her, but he’s flirting anyway.”
There are small titters of reluctant but genuine laughter. Draco wonders who wrote this speech for him. Not Granger, she would never be anything but clinically factual. Not Weasley, he wouldn’t know how to frame half the sentences Potter is speaking. Potter himself looks likelier and likelier, but Draco is loathe to contemplate that somewhere along the way, Potter became eloquently funny.
“All of my love,” Harry has written in a shaky, unsure hand. The ink has spread slightly, as though blurred by fallen tears. Draco can’t hold in the gasp.
And when their eyes meet, there’s something there so full of pain and aching and longing that Draco couldn’t stay away if he wanted to. He recalls Lovegood’s body bending towards Ginevra’s in the coffee shop, his father’s hands seeking out his mother’s waist even in the darkness. He inches closer. Their mouths are a hair’s breadth apart. When Draco speaks, his breath ghosts Harry’s parted lips.
“No. But please, please don’t disregard what Hermione was telling you just because I said what I did.” Then he seems to rethink his words before he asks, “What was she talking about anyway?”
Harry’s tired. He doesn’t know what happened to him but he knows it sunk the weight of his burdens into his bones. “Back to Britain,” he says. “Don’t worry Malfoy, I know when I’m not wanted.”
The last time he had gone to sleep for more than half the day, he had woken up to a living nightmare.
“How do we know he isn’t doing it simply for personal gain?” A wizard with a hooked nose asks. He was one of those sceptical from the start to the finish.
Potter traces the rim of his mug with a finger. Draco chokes back the thoughts of him using his pointer finger in that detached, exploratory expression on other—
For a second, they lie that way, Draco vulnerable and staring as Harry’s thumb gently traces the shape of Draco’s lips– the arch of his cupid’s bow, the fullness of the parts he bites at all the time, the chapped crevices.
“If you, if you have any intention of bringing harm to the House of Malfoy, to me, it, it shouldn’t let you in. It, it isn’t like other Malfoy curses or hexes. It’s simple… just a little charm to keep out unwelcome intruders.” He drags his gaze up and down, his eyes almost blank but with something flickering underneath, “Which I would have thought the Manor would think you are.” He pauses for a minute and gets a faraway look in his eye. “Unless my magic’s failing. Do you think my magic’s failing?”
Draco’s breath catches. When Harry turns to look at him, he finds the grey eyes fixed on him, a strange uncertainty in them.
Draco’s heart clenches so painfully that he thinks it will be shrivelled forever. “Harry,” he says. “I came back.”
“Potter,” Draco says, because even when Harry has hurt him, in ways that have nothing to do with pulling a magical noose around his neck tight, he can’t bear to watch Harry hurt himself. “Potter, look at me. I’m fine.”
Harry slides out of the chair and kneels, moving closer to the bed. He rests his chin on the edge of it, looking up at Scorpius. Scorpius’ weak heart spasms at the empty smile Harry shoots him. It’s laced with an unfathomable sadness that he knows Harry is trying to hide, and probably isn’t even conscious of revealing. His eyes are dry, but there’s a strange look in them– a fierce, protectiveness juxtaposed against the helplessness of the situation.
“But to the respected witches and wizards of the Wizengamot, I have to say that any trial that does not take into account either the accused’s age or his familial background is not as fair as the Honourable Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, would like it to be.
She lets out a breath. “Keeping busy sounds good,” she says, almost mournfully. “Since I’ve been benched, I’ve been feeling jittery and out of sorts all the time.”
After he’s done bathing (which he decides was one of Draco’s better ideas because he feels much better) and gets under the covers of the freshly made bed, Draco who’s been hovering to ensure Harry doesn’t pass out or hit his head against something says, “I’m going to go downstairs for a bit. Do you mind?”
He doesn’t know why she’s treating him like a friend. They aren’t friends. They’re tentative acquaintances who know each other through Harry Potter and Hermione Granger and make small talk at social gatherings but otherwise stay out of each other’s hair.
This is one of those bizarre moments when Draco likes to pinch himself discreetly to check if he’s dreaming or not. When a sharp tug to his thigh causes only pain and no jolt into reality, Draco is forced to believe this is happening. Potter and him are shaking hands and giving each other permission to use first names. His life has changed so drastically in three weeks that Draco sometimes feels like he is walking around, half asleep, unaware of the changes that are taking place until he comes face to face with them.
He doesn’t try to keep the mask up anymore. There’s no point. “She said she saw it coming,” he says and cringes when his polished voice sounds broken.
Father would never let himself cry over me in public if I died, Draco thinks absently, before shaking his head free of the thought. He isn’t dead, and his father is sitting in a cell somewhere, probably thinking up strategies to get himself out of there as soon as possible.
Granger sighs. She stays quiet for a few minutes and Draco can hear a clock ticking somewhere. Then she straightens and with her usual determination, says, “Your mental health isn’t why I initially wanted to contact you.”
Hermione has her back turned and she seems to be cooking– it’s lunch, he thinks absently– and she throws her hand up in the air with periodic exclamations. Malfoy is sitting at the table, upright and attentive, listening to whatever she’s saying and occasionally throwing in a couple sentences himself.
“The world has seen extensive damage and there are open wounds that require healing. The Muggle World, though not entirely aware of the inflicted damage must be given an opportunity to understand what their children are entering into before their children are taken away for the year to an institution half of them do not believe in. Unless we begin the introduction early, the barriers of prejudice will remain unchanged and we will only live to see the rise of yet another fanatic,” Kingsley is saying, his deep baritone resounding in the silent, circular hall.
After his treatment, he was lying exhausted and depleted on the narrow hospital bed, understanding with slow dawning horror that his Ravenclaw curiosity to understand what its like to live through a war– a real war!– was about to be met in the only way it could be at an unprecedented time of peace in the Wizarding World. That’s when she’s walked in again. Both Harry and Draco were asleep on either side of him, Draco’s monitoring charms still beeping faintly and Harry’s wand clutched in his loose grasp. Even in sleep they looked protective, ready to wake up and fight whatever demons were besieging Scorpius’ rest.
Harry inhales again. One does not learn to covet breath until the air is cut from one’s lungs. Harry wonders how many rich men choking on their wealth would have emptied their vaults for a breath of fresh air. Perhaps many, perhaps none.
“I’ll never love anyone as much as I love him,” Draco had said, and Harry had tensed up immediately. “No, Harry, not like that, I’m so sorry, my love–”
“A good bond then?” she asks instead. Her dark eyes are oddly perceptive while being almost guileless. It’s a little unnerving, looking into them. “Between you and your son? Open?
“India,” Harry clarifies. “We said before we came that we’d spend six months here and six months there. But I… am not ready. And if I don’t give myself a timeline, I doubt I ever will.”
Kingsley is brusque as ever. “Because punishment must fit the crime and your faults seem to be a sequence of terrible decisions made with the intention of sparing your family the Dark Lord’s heavy hand. I understand that your perspective on judgement is skewed”— he casts a significant look towards Draco’s covered left arm—“but we have made it a point to construct our systems on justice.”
She doesn’t know what to do. Harry can tell from the way her forehead is crinkled, her fingers are drumming against her thighs, the way she’s blinking much too fast. To be honest, he doesn’t blame her. He wants to tell her she doesn’t need to figure it out, that he will be fine but what comes out instead is, “I want to be alone.”
“Okay,” Harry says, immediately soothing and comforting. “That’s okay. Can you move your head? Even a little?”
But none of that compares to Potter asking him to call him Harry and him responding by asking Po-Harry to call him Draco. That is on a separate plane of impossible, unthinkable, something out of his teenage jealous dreams. Except in those, Potter would leave Granger and Weasley after insulting them thoroughly, apologise profusely to Draco for the years he spent insulting him and throwing hexes, and then grovel till Draco allowed him to be his friend.
Harry sits at the table, cheek resting on his palm, eyes hooded and glasses a little askew. He looks rumpled and accessible and Draco can’t help but veer closer towards him until their thighs are touching and their pinky fingers are linked under the table.
“Because you’re taking it out on her and the only universe in which she deserves that from you, from anybody, is in the one where she is the direct cause of it. If she isn’t, you have to come up with a better explanation.”
“We’ll make arrangements,” Draco says, nodding affirmatively. He looks rather like the barrister who ensures the best for his high profile clients. “No one’s too busy, darling. They’ll all come, I promise you.”
“Guess that’s my call then, mate,” Weasley says, grinning at Harry before rushing up the stairs after his girlfriend.
When at last they’re bored of dancing and they look around to see Harry’s friends all caught up in each other’s eyes, they look towards each other and by mutual, silent agreement, leave the Hall as surreptitiously as possible.
‘Hey,’ Harry says, when their chests are almost touching, pushing all the earnestness he feels into his words, hoping his eyes show Draco the love he feels, the way his heart is breaking open at the look on Draco’s face. ‘You’re the only one. You’ve always been the only one.’
“We discussed this,” he says, aiming to reassure. Apparently he fucks up because Malfoy’s face goes all complicated.
She laughs. It’s a broken, horrifying sound, like a nightingale singing in a graveyard. Out of place. Wrong. “Killing Tom Riddle is the first thing Harry has done that he
“Would you like me to explain why I think I am here?” Death asks, breaking him out of his pensive thoughts and Scorpius looks up startled.
He arches when Harry’s fingers cup his balls and roll them together and Harry murmurs, “Do you have an answer?”
His touch almost makes it… eager. It's pulsing softly against his hand and Draco thinks, distantly amused that his wand is acting rather like a Kneazle meeting its master after a month.
Instead, Granger, Potter and Weasley are sitting in three separate chairs, each one of them staring right at him. Granger is sitting with a mildly amused expression on her face, Weasley just looks confused and slightly bored and Potter… Potter is staring at him intensely, the flames of the fire flickering in his eyes, making the vibrant green an eerie shade of yellow. If he hadn’t been on the Draught, now would be when he would be spiralling straight into one of those moments where his thoughts take over, jamming his brain, making everything inside twenty times louder and muting the outside, moments which usually end up in him blacking out and waking up disoriented and confused. But the Draught keeps his heart from racing and he does his best to reign his thoughts in. Instead of blacking out, he swallows twice, focuses on Granger and says “Thank you for inviting me.” He swallows a couple more time before nodding to Potter and Weasley.
It’s a tall order of hope, but Harry isn’t blind enough to hold it against Narcissa Malfoy. Love makes fools of us all.
Draco lets his head thud back against the wall. He stares at the ceiling and fervently wishes, time and time again, completely and utterly uselessly, he had died rather than letting that damn Mark be branded onto his pale forearm. The delicate Malfoy complexion, the aristocratic look that he had once been so proud of makes it stand out darker, starker against alabaster skin. What he wouldn’t give he thinks to himself with a small, bitter smile, to have the skin Potter does, the darkened skin and calloused arms that Draco himself has mocked for years on end.
“Where’s Dad?” Scorpius asks, when no answer seems to be forthcoming. He’s confused, but the part of him that is supposed to feel confusion is distant, like a voice trying to reach him underwater. “It’s his day off. He’s supposed to be where you are.”
“Already told you. India. I’ve been looking and Delhi, maybe. Mumbai. A place called Calcutta in the East. More, if time permits.”
But in the few seconds of wakefulness before one slips into sleep, the moments in retrospect that seem indiscernible from dreams, Scorpius hears the stranger speak, the accent of the words sharpening.
“My back—there’s… blood pouring from it. I can feel it, it’s sticky and it’s getting all over her hair. Her hair really is ridiculously long. She promised to teach me how to cut it after…”
He’d called out to Scorpius, pressing down on the shutter at the precise moment Scorpius had turned, charming grin place. The picture had been delightful, the lighting perfect, the grin heartbreaking in its resemblance to Draco’s genuine smiles.
Harry’s face is unreadable and the familiar fear and heartache intensify. This will be the moment Harry leaves, he thinks, and digs his nails into his palms. This will be the moment he loses his only shot at heaven.
The press fabricates stories of the infamous family feud and Aunt Hermione is always going to be sceptical and Uncle Blaise will always avoid the armchairs and sit on Scorpius’ bed during his visits.
Harry swallows again before boldly reaching out and grasping Draco’s left wrist. He exposes the Mark, the grotesque skull’s eyes dead and dull now with no one to cast Morsmordre. “Just like this one.”
When long minutes have passed and he hears nothing but her breathing and the soft footfalls are she walks, Harry dares to venture a tentative, “Hermione?”
He turns to face Harry whose pupils look a bit blown, probably because of the strange lighting. “Satisfactory, Potter?”
“This branch of the family had an obsession with exotic birds,” Draco says by way of explanation for what Potter must have found in his room. “Hence, the…”
There’s a sound outside. The warden perhaps—his empty stomach tightens and his brain prepares for the inevitable onslaught. But then the round face of his barrister is visible through the bars of his cell. He’s standing inside a protective bubble full of the light and warmth of a non-corporeal Patronus and if Draco’s envy could manifest, it would choke the man on its poisoned vines.
He hears the click of the latch, and the door squeaks gently, letting in a burst of cold air into the room. Draco’s Warming Charms are excellent, but the slight draft provides him with an opening to shiver without arousing curiosity.
There’s a warm hand covering his mouth, stopping the ensuing barrage of words and he wonders why it’s there. Something wet and warm slides down his cheek and it takes him a few inordinately long moments to realise he’s crying.
Potter’s silent for a while. Behind his spectacles, his eyes are unreadable. After quiet moments, he raises his mug in a toast and says, “More in common than I thought at first.”
“The bathroom has soap embossed with a quail motif,” Potter says and Draco is startled yet again, this time into laughter.
He meant it as a joke but both Kingsley and Hermione nod seriously. “Look nice, Harry. Draco, you’ll help him, won’t you?”
Seemingly noticing her for the first time, Draco eventually turns to Hermione still standing in the doorway. “Something you wanted?”
“You could travel,” she says after a moment. “Not to Australia,” she clarifies, before Harry can open his mouth. “Somewhere else. There’s a whole world out there and you have the vaults to make it possible. Where outside of Britain have you been?”
Some of the frowns are turning considering and Draco’s amazement skyrockets. When he looks back at Potter, the green gaze as unbearable and alluring as staring into the sun strikes Draco in the face.
“I missed you,” Harry says, because he did. Because after a month of sleeping curled into Draco’s warmth in his bed, his own had felt so cold, so numb, so unbearable. Because Draco’s silence on the other side had been terrifying enough that Harry had almost burst in a couple of times but didn’t, digging half moons into his palms before biting off the nails.
The day Harry haltingly tells him about his Muggle relatives, Draco asks, voice harsh and words cutting, why, precisely, Harry doesn’t agree with Draco’s established notion that Muggles are filthy dogs. Which leads to a disappointed glare from Harry who reminds him that Hermione’s parents, who gifted him books and vouchers are also Muggle, and that his grandparents had been Muggles and the receptionist who gave them a discount on the price of their room is also a Muggle.
Harry visibly steels himself. “I survived the curse because I was a Horcrux. The part of Riddle’s soul in my body was what died when I got hit in the chest. In a way, he killed himself.”
He almost has another one, stopped only in time by Potter adding, “Didn’t know her knowing was that much of a fear for you.”
“I did,” she says, addressing Lovegood. “And he’s… there, more. But only in person. It’s like his mind is somewhere else.”
A couple more letters back and forth and Hermione tells him Malfoy agreed to come by today. So Harry smiles, says, “That’s fantastic!” and pretends to not be losing his goddamn mind at the thought of facing Malfoy after the last time they saw each other.  Malfoy was a man looking like a ghost and to the best of his knowledge, Harry had been an elaborate hallucination. Today evening, Harry thinks with a sigh, will be absolutely fantastic.
“Just, just wait for a minute,” Draco winces through gritted teeth. “Just wait. Don’t… pull out. Wait.”
By the time he’s loosened Harry’s jeans enough to slide them off his narrow hips, Draco is losing patience like a malfunctioning clock loses time. In one swift jerk, he pushes Harry’s jeans and pants down to mid thigh. Harry catches on, reaching down and pushing them as far they’ll go in this position and then proceeding to kick them off the last few inches until he’s looming over Draco, naked and gorgeous and glorious.
“I have no Muggle money on me,” Malfoy says, a little redundantly, because Harry wasn’t intending to let him spend it even if he did have it on his person. Harry takes a step away from him in the direction of the doorway that leads to Muggle London, unwilling to spend longer standing about in Knockturn.
And that was how he’d been roped into donating large sums of money to a research facility working with Wolfsbane, another fund for War orphans and investing in Lavender Brown’s up and coming skincare line for witches of colour.
“No,” Draco rushes to assure. “I liked it.” He pretends he isn’t blushing and adds, “A little too much.”
“This is where you… died, did you, mate?” Neville had asked, his sympathy rolling off him in waves. Harry had inclined his head curtly.
Harry looks down again, at the mess of brown curls strewn across Parvati’s lap, the puddle of blood forming around her shoes. Rivulets of it trickle down the steps, the rhythmic plops audible in the comparative stillness of this part of the castle.
As Draco falls back into the chair, a whisky bottle whizzes past Scorpius’ head into his outstretched hand.
He had been held up by a flurry of irrelevant interdepartmental memos that had flown in just when he had finally decided to head home and being the Head Auror, it simply wasn’t done to sign off on documents he hadn’t gone through himself. He doesn’t have a lot of active fieldwork duty anymore and so he makes up for the feeling of churning inadequacy in his gut every time other Aurors come in with flushed faces and bound criminals by diligently working through every sheet of paperwork that hits his desk.
Draco had bent to kiss the top of her head. “We’re Malfoys, mother. You know how much of an impossibility that is.”
Footsteps thunder up the stairs, the hum of voices, the frantic buzz of spells and incantations. A soft and soothing voice in Harry’s ear says, “Harry, Harry, it’s going to be okay, Harry, hey, Harry, please, look at me…”
Death says nothing. It’s a familiar response. When Scorpius looks at them, they appear contemplative.
“Sorry,” he says, as gracefully as he can. His voice breaks on the word. “I was distracted. I thought I saw something behind you.”
“A coffee couldn’t hurt,” he allows. Though he envies her, though he almost begrudges her the married bliss she enjoys with Harry, he doesn’t, he can’t hate her. Ginny Weasley is much too charming, much too forthright and much too witty to be hated by anyone.
“Because I need you to understand what you are to the world and how different it is from what you are to Granger. You’re not her saviour, Potter. You’re supposed to be her best friend. She doesn’t perceive you the way the rest of the world does. Maybe you should try not treating her the way you’re treating the rest of the world.”
It feels like a sin to admit this to anyone before Harry. His nod sends chills of damnation down his shivering spine. If she wasn’t sure before, she is now.
An hour after she sends out the letter, a huge eagle owl swoops in through the open window and sits on the mantelpiece. Harry recognises it as Malfoy’s owl, the one that arrived every morning in Hogwarts with parcels and packages for the prat. Archimedes, he recalls. A pretentious name for a pretentious owl belonging to a pretentious bastard from a pretentious family living in a pretentious Manor. Fitting indeed.
It’s unexpected when Harry kisses him. It’s close mouthed and chaste, just a brush, but it sends shockwaves across Draco’s skin, and something rattles somewhere in the room when Draco’s accidental magic shudders in the air like a flickering candle.
He remembers Scorpius asking for notebooks when he still had the capability to write. Remembers tying feet after feet of parchment to the legs of myriad owls. Owls who returned with smaller missives that Scorpius would tuck away under his pillow.
Scorpius tries not to cry. It is his death (his death!) that finally gets his dad to consider himself and Father a unit. It’s bittersweet.
When on one particularly hard hit, he winces pathetically, Weasley pulls him away from the wall. “How is that helping?” He demands to know. “Because while you’re here, damaging whatever is left of your brains, my best friend is drowning in alcohol. I had one brother recover from that shit, I won’t have another going down the same path. Go to him and apologise. He’s Harry, if you have a good enough reason, he’ll give you the benefit of the doubt.”
Malfoy seems to pick up on his odd mood and the direction of his thoughts because the next words out of his mouth are, “And Granger? Where is she?”
The shame those words are drenched in is a force in itself, the one keeping Draco’s eyes down, the one making his shoulders shake, the one that had him shy away from Harry for a week. Harry licks his own lips and wonders what power he has that is stronger than that shame because Draco should not look this broken for something Harry finds no sin in.
“Yes,” he’d said, and that had been that. She’d even donated one of her vintage eagle feathers to be auctioned for a fundraising event, and that silent show of support had screamed louder than any words.
There’s a tightness in Draco’s throat and a tell-tale wetness on his lashes, but he finds himself unable to even lift a hand to wipe it off. Instead his hands drift to the bruises on his lips, on the sides of his neck, on his thighs, and press in, a reminder of what Draco had and lost.
“When we went on the run, it was just Ron, Hermione and me in a tent. I got used to falling asleep to just two sets of breaths. When I wake up in the dorm, if I have a silencing charm on, I hear nothing and I panic because I think they’re gone. If I don’t have a silencing charm on, I hear all those other breaths and I panic because I think it could be anyone,” Potter says. His voice is soft, almost soothing. It’s lost its sandpaper quality and Draco can only hope that’s because he’s talking more.
“He’s making sure no one else ever claims mastery,” he whispers. “That’s the only way to nullify the wand, right? If the owner dies without ownership of it being transferred? If the Master dies the Master?”
“Speaking of pricks,” Harry teases and unexpectedly his hands, his wonderful, warm hands are pressing on Draco’s cock, through the cotton of his pants. It feels so unbelievably good, just the palm of Harry’s hand sensuously rubbing along his length, the added friction of the clothing on his over-sensitised flesh adding to the feeling of being driven straight over the edge. Just as he begins to arch into the touch, his cock straining against the fabric and creating a gigantic wet spot on the black cotton, Harry moves his hand away.
The rage itself sharpens itself to points inside him and he has never experienced something this acutely frustrating and painful. At one point he could have blamed the rage within him, the irrationality and the intrusive thoughts on Voldemort. But now Voldemort is dead, gone, not even a shred of him is left for Harry to lay the blame on.
It isn’t long before Harry is throwing his head back, grunting and groaning and Draco feels warmth spread in his arse. Draco clenches his muscles around Harry’s dick throughout his orgasm and from the tightening of Harry’s hand on his, Draco is certain it has the desired effect.
Draco hums softly as he moves lower, down Harry’s chest. He raises a hand and pinches one of Harry’s nipples, which leaves him arching and moaning beneath Draco. When Harry’s eyes open, he sees Draco smirking slightly.
This time, Harry screams himself hoarse as Draco’s tongue traces a broad swipe down his balls to his hole, which makes Harry realise how Draco had tied him– to keep him exposed, open.
The rope goes around his wrist, secure, though not uncomfortable and very soon Harry finds his right hand bound to the headboard. He tests the bond by tugging on it and it barely gives. From years of wandless, wordless magic usage on the field, Harry knows he could snap out of the ropes with just a little concentration but through the pleasant fog enveloping his mind, he’s surprised and delighted by how little he wants to.
“I’m not a good man,” he tells Potter, because Potter needs to know that before bestowing too much faith in him.
She shakes her head fondly at him and he marvels at his choice in friends, even at eleven. This is his family. This is who he has left, even after everyone’s gone. The thought fuels him with a rush of warm affection that diffuses some of the tension he hadn’t even known he’d been carrying in his body.
Draco blinks at the mingled, mumbled syllables that have merged together to form one long string of unintelligible sounds. “I beg your pardon?”
The tip of a thick finger slides into his hole gently. It hurts like hell, burns like it too and Draco gasps at the strange, foreign sensation.
Harry almost swallows his tongue in surprise. And chokes. And bursts into a coughing fit. When he looks back up at Malfoy, it is to find him glaring. “What?” He demands.
But right now, under the presumable and questionable care of Granger, Potter and Weasley, the only clean space appears to be the three couches in front of the fireplace where he assumes Granger had instructed him to sit. Moving over, he gingerly sits, still not entirely sure this isn’t an elaborate trap to capture him, turn him into a singing canary and let him loose in the wilderness of Muggle London.
Potter stops, and the courtroom is silent. Nobody had known what to expect of Potter’s testimony, but no stretch of the imagination seemed to have prepared anyone, including Draco, for
“If you’ve always wanted to go, you should,” Ron says. “Take a year, hell, take more off and just. I don’t know, what do people do when they go back to their country?”
He doesn’t know how to put it into words—the dual battle in his head, a war of attrition between the urge to simply do what he knows he needs to and to give himself time to get used to the ideas of it.
She shrugs one shoulder, effortlessly. “You drove him away, Potter, you’re going to have to go find out yourself.”
The pain at hearing him apologise, call it a mistake. Tell him he shouldn’t have gone along with it. Tell him it was okay to say no as though Harry could even imagine saying no to such spectacular kissing, not to mention he had been wanting it for weeks.
“No,” she says, and looks down at the table. “Of course not. And until I am, I wouldn’t like to cast aspersions.”
“Exactly!” Draco had said, throwing his arms up, and Harry had begun to laugh, pulling Draco down by the collar of his shirt into a messy kiss.
Harry shifts and lines up and Draco feels a blunt head poking at his entrance. He takes a deep breath and nods again and Harry gradually, painstakingly gradually pushes in past the tight ring of muscle.
He looks around, noticing the layer of dust on the surface of the bookshelf, the untouched quality of the air around the cabinets. It’s as though Harry doesn’t live here, only pays occasional visits.
“Gianni, this is Harry Potter,” Malfoy says, smoothly stepping over the threshold. “We’ll be staying here for a while, now.”
Harry doesn’t think it should but that one statement makes having said all of those things he couldn’t say to his best friends worth it.
He’s barely eating, fiddling instead with his fork while his hair flies into his eyes repeatedly. Granger bumps him in the arm accidentally while gesturing and immediately turns to him to apologise but he waves her off and begins to trace patterns on his plate. Draco doesn’t miss the concerned look Granger shoots him but she visibly steels herself before turning back to Ginevra and somewhat forcibly resuming their conversation. Potter, sitting right beside her, remains oblivious.
Scorpius follows him up, taking the stairs two at a time. He reaches the door to Harry’s bedroom, peeps in through the crack. Harry’s on his knees in front of the wardrobe, gathering up the cloak and what Scorpius assumes are the wand and the stone wrapped up in it. He’s folding them into a leather pouch that by no means should be able to fit anything larger than a stone without Extendable Charms.
Right now, there is nothing flattering about the look he has on his face. It’s dark and it’s ugly and it’s brimming with the sort of cavernous self-hatred that Harry knows all too well from what he’s seen in the mirror on his worst days.
When he has the presence of mind to race up the stairs to the bedroom she shares with Ron, he finds her pushing a Weasley jumper into the beaded purse from which the expanding charm was never removed.
“Because you’re sitting across from me, trying to engage in completely pointless small talk. I’d much rather give you something to actually talk about.”
It’s almost all overwhelmed by black as his vision tunnels further and then it turns abruptly grey. If he weren’t in limbo between where he was and where he is, the grey would be soothing. It’s beautiful, the colour of storm clouds on a day made for staying indoors, the colour of Hermione’s soft sweatpants and Ron’s favourite coffee cup.
“Lavender’s dead,” Harry says, the words weighted and heavy on his uncooperative tongue. Parvati blinks.
Draco gasps when he does it, whether in surprise or in pleasure, Harry can’t be arsed to care. But Draco starts going just a little faster, enough for the buildup to happen in a curling roll of pleasure rising from the very tip of Harry’s toes, gaining traction in his stomach as he arches his back from the touch, becoming almost unbearable as it tightens his balls and spills from his cock onto Draco’s hand.
“What?” Harry says, dumbfounded and floundering in the face of a Malfoy who has reacted to the situation so contrarily from what Harry had expected of him that it’s laughably ridiculous. “No, why would you—
For the first time in many years, Draco and Harry’s eyes meet over their son’s deathbed. They have one of those silent conversations they used to be catcalled for at parties when they couldn’t take their eyes off each other. For one split, surreal second, there’s no court case, no slander, no Prophet publications.
Their lips fit against each other and the last coherent thought Draco is capable of is a fervent thanks to Salazar that Harry didn’t wear his fucking spectacles today before he’s overwhelmed by
“Your PTSD requires extensive psychotherapy and you are definitely showing symptoms of chronic depression and anxiety, but there’s nothing I have found that renders you mentally incapacitated or intellectually disadvantaged.”
‘Are you kidding?’ Harry asks, opening one eye with effort. Draco is looking down at him uncertainly. ‘I’m taking a weekend off every month just to come here with you.’
“You’re very interested in my friends all of a sudden,” Harry says, a little petulantly. “Why should I tell you about them?”
Draco materialises behind Parkinson, shirtless and doing up his belt and Harry’s eyes widen. Parkinson turns to look over her shoulder and seeing Draco in his state of undress, widens her eyes too, and when Draco looks up to see them staring at him, he turns a little pink and stammers out a curse and they’re three awkward idiots standing in the doorway of an Italian hotel, staring at each other.
‘Then I give you what I want,’ Draco says and Harry cries in earnest this time, hearing the teasing lilt in Draco’s voice.
Was it the Dark Mark, Draco muses, watching the way a Wizengamot member’s eyes slide away from his the moment he chances to look upon her, that kept Dumbledore from saving him? Couldn’t be, Snape had a Mark too. But Snape was a spy, ambiguous loyalties cut into every line of age-old grief on his face. The sly smirk of his lips spoke of a man worthy of the Dark Lord’s inner circle, the wrinkle between his brows of a man with misery tainting his murky soul black with the shattered remnants of hope.
“It would be so easy,” she had said, looking at them– heads turned away from each other, sitting two chairs apart across the room. “So easy to hate them. Why don’t you?
Something undetectable passes over Ginevra’s features. He’d have missed it if he weren’t so attuned to everything Harry, everything even remotely related to Harry, everything like the smell of treacle tarts on a summer morning as he passes by a bakery–
His other wrist is soon secured and Harry finds his arms stretched out over his head, unmoving, secured to the sturdy teak of the headboard.
But then Harry had stepped into the room with a smile, a book and a look in his eyes so lost that Scorpius had known that he might be stoic in the face of this– he might have been trained to be stoic under pressure– but he wasn’t, by any means, okay.
“No, no, no, no…” he’s murmuring under his breath and Harry, Ron and Hermione look at each other in consternation.
He’s married to his work and his husband, but his work can’t kiss him back and his husband probably won’t.
Draco breaks anything he touches and even though his hands itch to reach out for Harry, he keeps them clenched in his lap.
Draco pants, whining slightly at the loss of contact, but within seconds, Harry’s lube slicked cock is pressing against his entrance, warm and thick and heavy and complaint dies on his lips like a budding rose in a thunderstorm.
She has the presence of mind to not ask after his friends- she knows none of them came back. He has the presence of mind to not ask about Potter- he doesn’t know if he
“Malfoy, you–” Weasley breaks off, gathers his thoughts with conscious effort and tries again. “What exactly do you think you need to apologise for?”
Harry says nothing for a brief moment. When he speaks, he appears more composed that he has in the past few minutes. “When?”
He’s painfully hard in his pyjama bottoms and just to relieve the pressure of it, Draco slides his hand into his pants and presses the heel of it to the junction of his cock and his balls. His cock twitches, interested and alert against his warm palm and Draco has to bite his own frantic groan into the pillow which he hastily retrieves with one flailing hand.
In any other scenario, he would have headed into another panic attack at that question. But with Granger, things are... oddly comfortable. More than they have been with another individual for a while now. He can
Draco trips on his own feet and his satchel empties its contents all across the floor and when both him and Potter bend down to pick up the large quill lying at their feet, their foreheads bump hard.
“If this isn’t a good time,” she says, frustratingly calm, “then you can Floo me when you think it is. I will be, as you well know,
It is Saturday evening, six weeks into the planning of Granger’s project. The proposal is almost complete, just some finishing touches to be added. Harry has spoken to Kingsley, giving him a vague idea of the project and when the Minister agrees to hear out your ‘innovative and interesting plan’ there is very little you feel you cannot accomplish. So Draco takes the Floo to Grimmauld Place in high spirits, a spring in his step, expecting to add the final details in by today so they are ready in time for next week for the Minister.
Before Draco knows it, he’s reaching out to grip Potter’s wrist before he slips back under his Cloak.
Draco shrugs a little, a drop of water sliding off the edge of his shoulder onto the bedsheets. “I woke up and I couldn’t move. I didn’t plan it.”
When they pull apart, Harry looks slightly dazed but so pleased that Draco could perhaps replace the sun with the smile on Harry’s face. But soon enough the expression turns slightly serious and Harry asks, “Do you want to go on about the scars?”
“No,” Draco tells him, unsure why he feels he owes explanations to a hallucination. Maybe he’s hallucinating because he needs to explain these things, say them out loud before they fester within him and kill him slowly from the inside with the pressure of not being able to get out. “I can’t sit in those rooms. They’re places where Vol-Voldemort or Bellatrix did and I can’t sit there. I can clean, I can perform magic, I can throw out furniture or try to get rid of Dark Magic but I can’t, I can’t sit there. Spend time there. If you want to, go ahead, but you’ll be alone.”
“The Malfoy answer is that in the post war climate I would be best benefited to agree to whatever you might see fit to propose. The Malfoy answer agrees to funding whatever you have in mind, agrees to help you with social influence. Agrees to be... associated.” He pauses to take a breath.
When Harry reaches Grimmauld, his mind is whirling. He knows more about Malfoy in the fifteen minutes he spent talking to him sitting on the floor of his kitchen than he did in the entirety of the past seven years that he has known the prat. Despite that, Harry has no idea what to make of what he knows. Malfoy looked so, so… broken. He looks the way Harry feels all the time, as though someone has taken a chisel and carved out the will to live from his body and left behind an empty shell. It angers him, it frustrates him, looking in a mirror and not seeing himself. Not seeing the boy who fought for the good of the world but instead seeing the man broken by a War against a raving lunatic. But Malfoy doesn’t seem to have even have the anger left in him.
It had come to him in the form of one of his father’s old acquaintances, Archibald Scrivenshaft. He’d shown up at the gates of the Manor one Sunday morning, almost a year after the War to inform Lucius Malfoy, one of the largest investors in Scrivenshaft’s, that sales were dropping and the shop stood on the verge of total bankruptcy.
“Arguably, that is precisely the job description,” they say, and Scorpius can’t help the laugh that bubbles up.
Choudhury looks over to where a stunned Harry is still lying on the ground. “Am I right in guessing this is his doing?”
‘Cast a cleaning charm, will you?’ Draco asks, his voice hoarse from screaming, crying and loud, wanton moaning.
Scorpius blinks, and it’s not Sirius anymore, but instead Grandpa Arthur, looking every bit the jovial, happy man who had shown Scorpius the wonders of teddy bears and muggle taps.
“We have to dance!” Draco responds, throwing his hands up. “It’s a Ball, Potter! People go there to dance.”
The pressure eases. When Draco’s eyes focus on his surroundings again, he sees Harry hovering by the bed, rage and guilt chasing each other across his features.
“Fair enough,” she admits and hesitates. “Truth is, you’re the only one who has any actual interest in Potions. And Tristessia isn’t something I want to brew with someone prone to setting the cauldron aflame.”
The marks on his back which Draco has seen only once before for a split second are much more prominent than he remembers. They’re raised, thin lines criss crossing over Harry’s back. There are the scars Harry has all over himself, the other ones from nicks, cuts, scrapes and bruises that never healed right. These are… different. These are purposefully inflicted scars that were never even allowed to heal right.
“I had those done every time I got a new blanket because the house elves always confused mine with father’s. And for some reason they used something that made those covers smell like fucking burnt hair and it was so awful that I threw a tantrum just to avoid that,” he tells her between bouts of laughter.
“I don’t think I feel much about them anymore.” He pauses with a grimace. “To be honest, I thought they were… animals before." He winces at how that comes out but soldiers on through the truth,"They were inferior, lesser beings. Like House Elves and Goblins. But now, after the Muggles in our cellar, after I heard them talk among themselves… they were just like us. They were terrified and they were scared of magic but they-” He doesn’t know how to say it. “There was a Muggle family in our cellar for a few weeks. Parents and their five year old daughter. He killed them of course, in time. But when I took them food and water at night, the father, he… he would whisper stories to the girl. He would talk about strange Muggle fairytales, sweet ones and he would comfort her every time she cried.” He stops, the words tangling in his throat. He remembers standing outside the cell, quietly, listening to the story himself. It was a winding tale about a princess who went to sleep for a hundred years. He remembers crying, trying to be as soundless as possible as the man told the child her mother had gone to sleep for a while.
He doesn’t realise what Draco is doing until those long, deft fingers have reached over to undo the button of his trousers with no warning whatsoever. He turns to look at Draco who has a faint blush on his cheekbones and who is determinedly not looking his way.
“Save it,” he tells Potter, the bitter edge to his own voice making him cringe. He didn’t mean to sound quite so hurt. “You came by, unexpected and without warning. Do let me know the next time you’re going to pop by to say hello, I’ll fix up the parlour.”
“Move back, Harry.” Hermione’s voice is cold, ice cold. It drenches Harry in reality and he opens his mouth in shock and stumbles back hurriedly, the apology ready on his lips. He doesn’t know how he could have said any of that to her, demeaning her, when he knows, he knows what she has gone through, what she still goes through far too frequently.
He just wants to be left alone. When he sleeps, if he eats, when he does nothing but stare at the ceiling.
They’re lying side by side, not quite touching, but Draco’s playing with Harry’s hair and Harry’s hands are on Draco’s exposed hipbone.
By the time both the barristers have concluded their arguments and Draco is released from his bonds and made to stand, Kingsley’s eyes find Draco’s again. “Before the court adjourns for today, would the accused like a word?”
Weasley grumbles unintelligibly under his breath, something that sounds like And there’s the difference between your kind and mine.
Draco blushes right up to the tips of his elf-like, pointy ears. “It’s not like, um, that I haven’t, um,” he stutters rather adorably, “done anything at all. Slytherin boys dorms were saintly places but the Quidditch locker rooms were a whole different story altogether and I’ve done… things. Some things. Most things. Just not…” he makes a clarifying motion with his hands and Harry bursts out laughing. When he finally reigns himself in, Draco is glaring at him through narrowed grey eyes.
He screams again, when Harry brings the hand holding his hip down to fondle his balls. He cradles them and strokes them, gentle and firm in alternating brushes of his skilful fingers. “It’s like stroking a clit, a bit,” Harry had admitted once. Even that memory isn’t strong enough to remotely diminish the heights of pleasure he’s reaching right now.
His eyes fall to the bedside table where an envelope rests, thick and heavy. Harry’s familiar chicken scrawl has etched a few words across the front of it. Draco stoops to take a closer look and his heart stops in his throat.
But right now, with the memories of the war so raw, with the nightmares of empty tents and cold pools with a necklace stringing him to death, Ron lying broken and bloody in the middle of a forest, the mere thought of going on a trip with them fills Harry with nervous anxiety.
He knows he should leave with her, he knows he shouldn’t sign up for something that will probably leave his self-worth splintered into fragments but instead he says, “Why don’t you go on? I’ll catch up.”
‘Harry, please, I have to know. I won’t stoop so low as to spy on you or ask your coworkers or even your friends but Harry–’ he hesitates. ‘I have to know.’
“There was– there was a woman, once. I was away for a game, and Harry hadn’t called in days, and I was fucking furious, and she was there, and she was beautiful and I– I made a decision I couldn’t take back. One I had to live with, bury deep within myself, one I had to face in the mirror every day after that. I couldn’t look Harry in the eye for months.”
Oh the burning, burning shame. The shame of not being desirable, not being wanted, not being enough.
Draco has been avoiding him for a week, in the weird, condescendingly polite way Harry has only ever experienced firsthand from his uncle’s boss who once came over to Privet Drive and looked at him as though he were a potted plant instead of a human being.
He turns and finds Blaise watching him with sorrowful eyes. For once, sorrow does not feel like pity. He looks into Blaise’s eyes, and with his heart in his throat asks in a hoarse whisper, “What do I do now, Blaise? He’s married, and he’s Harry fucking Potter and I am Draco Malfoy, but I–
He watches the bob of Draco’s Adam’s apple as he swallows. Watches the flutter of his eyelashes as they sweep the delicate skin beneath his eyes. “Because I can’t do this without you.”
“Alright, alright” Potter says, lifting his hands in a gesture of surrender. His palms are broad, Draco notices. He’s wearing a slightly clunky watch around his right wrist and his heart line is particularly deep, visible clearly all the way across the table. “I want to come because I don’t know where I’m supposed to be going and I’m scared that I’m going to find out my drive to leave this place only lasts fifteen minutes because the rest of the world is too big and I’ve never been…” he shrugs, “Anywhere, really. If you let me come, it would help keep us both on track.”
A bottle of whisky would be good but there are already two of those in his room so he shakes his head.
“No!” Draco says, eyes wide again. “No, I—I didn’t mean to offend, I didn’t mean to imply you should stay just to save me, I—” He cuts himself off and draws in a deep breath. “I’m learning,” he says eventually. “I’m trying. And I didn’t mean to push you away. I did something I couldn’t forgive myself for and I took it out on you.”
Malfoy looks… haggard. His blond hair is matted, almost brown, his skin is sallow and the bruises beneath his eyes are purple. There are mottled green and blue bruises blooming across his bare forearms and he watches the thin line of Dench’s lips when he takes them in. Malfoy’s eyes flicker with fear and cowardice mingled with something of better mettle, something stronger, something fiercer that Harry has never seen on those features before.
But mainly, it just jars Harry to see Draco Malfoy not throw Galleons at whatever he wants, whenever he wants. Harry picks up the slack a little, buying Draco some of the more expensive things, gifting them with a shrug and a light blush.
he thinks, the word floating through his senses. It sounds mechanical when the voices in his ears whisper it, the grating harmony of the syllables unfamiliar. It feels like the moment when the shackles had been lifted from his hands, the weight of the surly guard’s justified anger cutting into him instead.
“No,” Harry cuts her off, knowing she is going to completely misconstrue the situation if he lets her go on. “I apologised. I told him to keep working with you if he wanted to. It’s just…”
Potter cocks a brow and Draco flushes. “Do you have family there?” The attempt to make up for the insensitivity of his comment falls a little flat but Potter takes it at face value and shrugs again.
Gianni’s concern is morphing into wide eyed terror and his small hands are coming up to tug at his massive ears and he’s muttering in Italian under his breath. Draco’s Italian is formal, he doesn’t understand the garbled, mangled colloquialisms or the elvish grammar, but he picks up on the words
When he’s done, Harry’s mouth slides off in an exquisite pull and staring up at Draco through hooded eyes that used to be green but have now become a blown shade of brownish black outlined with a circle of forest green, he wipes away a stray dribble of come from the side of his face with the back of his hand.
“It’s your wand,” Potter says and there’s conviction in his voice that Draco can’t feel in his clenching, erratically beating heart. “Malfoy, it’s your wand.”
“Yes.” She hasn’t looked up yet. At this point, she’s shoving things in blindly. Harry’s sure she’s going to tug the bedsheets off and put them in too if he doesn’t stop her.
“I- um- I Apparated,” he says, gesturing to the gate. Malfoy shakes his head and murmurs, “The gate has an intention charm on it. It’s not supposed to let in– I put it there. Is my magic failing?”
“I hope Padma still has her box. She has Ma’s favourite pair in it, the pretty glass bangles with the gold leaves. I wore those to the Yule Ball with you. Lavender said I looked like a princess.”
With nothing holding his hips down, he bucks and arches into Draco’s mouth and the finger wetly gliding in his hole strokes against his prostate and the world explodes in white and then fades to black as Harry’s orgasm bursts out of him.
, falling from his lips like offerings and Harry accepts it with caresses and warm touches and more questions and quiet smiles like the god he is.
“You were a coward,” Harry says, the words slipping out. He doesn’t mean them hurtfully but instead truthfully. Malfoy nods.
“If you’d asked, I would have slammed my door on your face,” Harry says without hesitation. He would never, not in a million years, speak for Lucius Malfoy and spare him the well deserved hell of Azkaban.
“All the spinning around on the front steps, all the careful avoidance of ever saying blood slurs in front of me when they’re probably playing on loop inside that sick head of yours, all the pretences. You can drop it.”
‘You’re late,’ Draco yawns. ‘I knew you would be, so I kept dinner under a stasis charm in the kitchen.’
The sound of heavy breathing reaches his ears so he turns, surprised, and what he sees makes pain bloom down his chest.
He’s probably supposed to be offended by the words. But the delivery of them, light and tinged with humour makes it impossible to hold a grudge. He’s unwilling to let himself contemplate how many of the ones he’d held at Hogwarts would have evaporated if Potter had shown him this side of him, had aimed this laughter at
He must have heard something because Malfoy begins to drag in deep lungfuls of air. After a minute, he seems to have calmed down. At least, comparatively. He sits at the table, his head in his hands and says nothing for a long time.
Harry expects barbs, insults, pointed words. He expects rage and accusations and he steels himself for it.
He recounts the tale from the moment he had entered the living room to find it in a mess to the point where him and Hermione had firecalled her to come and at least try to talk Harry into getting help.
“I’m not worried about my secrets,” Malfoy says, raising his head from his arms, eyes blazing. “I’m worried about this!”
“We’re listening,” Harry says, putting a broad hand on his shoulder, gently pushing him down onto the bed. His tense back muscles relax as best as they can, and Scorpius tries to take comfort in the warmth of Harry’s hand spreading across his chest through his bedclothes. “It’s okay, yeah?”
Harry whispers a Vanishing spell and the constricting sensation of the trousers around Draco’s knees disappears. He immediately spreads them wider. With another flick of Harry’s fingers, Draco’s boxers disappear and Draco is naked and vulnerable under Harry’s sharp gaze.
Rome is magnificence unparallelled. San Gimignano had been a watercolour painting, all soft edges and smiling people, pretty street corners and trellised windows. Florence had been a sculpture, lifelike and gorgeous, artistic and fascinating.
Dating seems… inadequate, if he’s being honest. Dating is weekly coffee shops and a kiss against a lamppost, dating is shy smiles and playing footsie under the table, dating is chocolates and taking someone home after enough good evenings spent in their company to spend a better night. Dating is everything delicate and frivolous and happy that Draco can’t imagine for himself anymore.
Draco hadn’t known what to do, but an uncomfortable tightness had wormed its way into his chest and had expanded into a writhing beast since.
Hermione Granger had shown up at Scrivenshaft’s one day, with an uncertain edge to her demeanour and a small smile. Draco had been inside at the time, perusing the fountain pens, and she’d walked in, looked around with fascination writ plain across her face and when she’d spotted him, her face had fallen and she’d turned to leave.
His head thuds back against the kitchen cabinets, a pose he has perfected in the months he has spent sitting in his kitchen, either too exhausted to work or too relaxed from the Calming Draughts to stand and not fall on his face. He knows from experience that a Calming Draught does not act as a numbing charm and the pain felt when on it is still very, very real. That’s when he hears Potter’s breath hitch.
Draco throws his hands up in the air and disappears back into the room, hopefully to put on a shirt. Within seconds, he’s back, a black T-shirt creased at the hem just enough to make him appear artfully tousled. Harry and Parkinson stare at each other awkwardly as Draco does his buttons up.
He looks around, and for a split second thinks his heart is going to stop before he remembers it already has.
It’s Harry who moves first. He heaves a sigh that echoes through the empty room, raises a hand as though to touch Draco before he thinks better of it. Abruptly, he turns on his heel and stomps away down the corridor, his boots thudding on the wooden floor.
“Come on, Malfoy,” Harry pleads. He isn’t sure why he’s here, pleading with Malfoy to join him for a drink. If it weren’t so absurd, it would probably be a little pathetic. But absurd is better than the predictable routines Harry is trying his best to avoid, and if Malfoy is the ticket to an interesting evening, Harry will take it. At fifteen, Harry would have scoffed at the idea of spending anything remotely close to a ‘pleasant evening’ with Malfoy. At seventeen, the prospect is almost mellow. “I’ve been making impulsive decisions all week. What’s one more?”
“I understand it too,” Harry says. “Sometimes I—Sometimes I miss my mother and I didn’t even know her.”
He opens his eyes and meets Harry’s and sees them widen in realisation and shock. “Are you saying what I think you’re saying?”
“It’s been a long time coming,” she says, and Draco’s eyebrows rise in surprise. Potter and him haven’t been falling into bed for a long time, after all. Long enough for him to sink the claws of emotions into Harry’s unavailability, but not long considering the bigger picture. He wonders how many men there have been before him. He barely holds in the shudder.
She shakes her head. “Believe it or not, I didn’t leave the house to accost you on Diagon.” She smiles. “Happy coincidence, eh?”
Scorpius draws himself together and looks around, searching, as though trying to find someone. Harry watches him, confused.
Eventually something softens in Harry’s rigid stance, and Draco releases the breath he’d been holding, afraid to even move wrong.
“Gianni is welcoming young master and young master’s friend to the House of Malfoy,” he says. “It is being an honour.”
He coughs lightly, knowing from years of experience it is absolutely wasted on Hermione and sees for himself that Malfoy, no matter what he has been maintaining strictly for the past seven years is cut from the exact same cloth. Paying him no mind at all, they continue to debate the effectiveness of metal weapons against wands. Surprisingly enough, Malfoy is advocating for the weapons and Hermione for magic.
Potter had asked. Draco doesn’t think he can bring himself to fully acknowledge just how much he wants to.
At first glance, Lavender appears unconscious. Now, with the eerie stillness of her body bent at odd angles on the stone steps, Harry registers in the more rational part of his mind that isn’t screaming with exhaustion or numb from shock that she’s dead. The back of her white shirt is tattered and bloody from the unmistakable slash of a werewolf’s claws.
Draco was so focused on the images and their connotations that he almost missed the words. When he finally catches on to them, he feels his eyes widen against his own volition as he squeaks out a, “Beg your pardon?”
“You know what I mean,” he says. Draco is silent, but when their eyes meet, the understanding could not be clearer between them.
Harry shoves his trousers down to his knees, and Draco wants him to shove it off entirely so he can spread his legs for Harry as far as he wants to, but he’s too incoherent with lust and love and desperation to be making pleas for anything but Harry’s hands on his cock, right this moment.
He reaches up and brushes warm fingers against Draco’s Adam’s apple, watching hungrily as it bobs when Draco swallows. In one move, his face is buried in the curve of Draco’s throat, the hollow of his collarbone, tracing a path of open mouthed kisses up the column of exposed skin Draco bares for him.
A week into classes where the teachers say little to him and he works alone most of the time, Draco walks out of the hall and heads to Potions only to find Granger waiting for him outside the dungeons.
It had been the first time Harry had willingly crawled into his cupboard, unwilling to let Petunia or Vernon or fucking Dudley see his tears.
He doesn’t really know why he’s here except that he had found one of his diaries from sixth year where he had detailed in almost clinical terms the numerous ways in which he had failed to fix the Vanishing Cabinet. The flashes of white light, the dead animals, the strange sounds. The Room Of Hidden Things threatening to bury him alive, under the weight of towers of long-forgotten things. He had become one of those Hidden Things that year. The journal had taken him back and now… he can’t think of anything else.
Reaching up to cover Harry’s hand with his own where it rests against his cheek, Draco murmurs in a raspy voice, “Hey, Potter?”
Draco arches to meet Harry’s motions, too far gone in the rush of pleasure to give half a fuck about the words and sounds spilling from his mouth. He could be proclaiming Harry the Queen and he wouldn’t know, he could be spilling every last dirty secret and he wouldn’t know.
Harry remembers leaving it with Draco when he went on his more dangerous missions, and Draco placing it reverentially before him when he returned. He remembers picking it up while looking Draco in the eyes, charged and heated looks passing between them. He remembers slipping it on, feeling complete after days, sometimes weeks of feeling like a part of him was missing.
“And I thought– I always thought you were a spectacularly bad one, one I needed to break, one that brought me nothing but agony.”
“You don’t do well with names, you deal in faces,” Scorpius says automatically, mind wandering back to that evening, and the strange conversation. “And that you know Harry Potter by another name.”
“More,” he begs, and keens when Harry buries his finger fully in Draco’s arse, its path slicked by lube and Draco’s wanton writhing. He leaves it in and stars burst behind Draco’s eyes with the force of the feeling of fullness. “Move,” Draco says, and thrashes when Harry acquiesces, warm, broad palm a gentle pressure against Draco’s arse cheeks.
Granger looks up from her Potions book, a surprised expression on her face. “Harry? No! Harry and Ginny, they broke up before the War, actually.”
Draco sits up. His bones complain at the movement, creaking like an arthritis patient’s swollen joints. It’s demeaning, the pain of it—no Malfoy has learned to starve in the cold of prison—but Draco couldn’t care less about indignity in the face of the thin ray of light that Dench is pouring into his cramped cell. There’s pain permeating through the frosty numbness of his lower body and the radiating pounding of his headache almost sends him crashing back to the floor, but he remains upright through sheer force of will and the last vestiges of his fading strength channeled into the clench of his knuckles on the stone floor.
Well, to be technical, that is how everyone measures time, but everyone else also checks their watch to see if it is five am or five pm or perhaps one pm when they can take their break finally, stretching limbs over their heads. Harry measures time in whether it is dark outside or still sunny when he wakes up, and how long he needs to be awake for his body to accept the need to sleep again.
“Did you cast a spell on me, Malfoy?” Harry growls. “Did you somehow, I don’t fucking know with Death Eaters anymore, did you somehow feed me a love potion or something?”
“No, she’s trying to have fun, but what she’s doing isn’t good for anybody involved and I can’t do a damn thing about it.”
Behind closed doors, there were no words exchanged, no explanations provided. What used to be a happy and carefree space created by two men in love for their little family quickly became a dilapidated ruin of memories and faint echoes of laughter.
“Don’t you miss Parkinson?” he asks instead, remembering Malfoy lounging in her lap on the train in sixth year, her hands carding through his hair.
He groans and tosses in his bed, flinging the pillow up over his head, hoping it will drown out the sounds and his sinful thoughts.
His immediate instinct is to deny. To say he’s alright, he’s just been tired, to lash out and say he’s entitled to being tired at the very least. It is what he has done in the past but the moment those words rise to his mouth, unbidden and automatic, he tamps down on them. He thinks of Draco laying himself open and vulnerable, saying things that must have hurt him to even think about.
He hadn’t realised how painfully hard he’d gotten, too caught up in the emotions of it all. But he is hard as a rock in his pants, sweating and squirming and desperate to relieve the pressure and he almost untrapped one of his hands only for Harry to look up at him sharply, eyes brimming with warning. The frustrated groan had seemingly delighted Harry whose movements acquired a renewed fervour.
He nears the table and notices Draco’s knee give an involuntary twitch. The newspaper slides a little before Draco rights it and clears his throat, and Harry feels weak.
Potter nods in acknowledgement. Granger gets up. “I’ll get us some tea, sit down and when I’m back, we’ll go over the outlines.”
“Were you?” Draco asks, expression suddenly sober and serious. He doesn’t look upset, but he looks… determined.
Draco throws his hands up because there seems to be no other expression that fits the reality he must have slipped into when he wasn’t looking. “I don’t! I don’t know what I have in mind, I just said that because—because—because that’s probably what Gryffindors do.”
Perhaps it is privilege, perhaps it is brattiness, perhaps it is entitlement—but Draco has always found a certain amount of solace in blaming the universe for his circumstances.
Now, despite the ragged smock and the greasy, stringy hair and the slight limp to his gait, Malfoy looks every bit the little prince. Harry can almost imagine the caustic words lurking behind the firm set of his lips, the snarl of his mouth as he tells the guards he’ll be
Yesterday evening he met with a solicitor to draw up a will. He’s left half the Black vaults to Hermione’s charitable organisations. He’s left the other half to Rose, his goddaughter for her to do with as she pleases. She’s the sort of person money will never be wasted on, only allowed to grow into a thriving, useful network helping more people.
The dynamic shifts between Potter and him in that night. He doesn’t have a name for it but he thinks that that line of ‘not-quite-friends’ has officially been crossed. They don’t talk much but when they do, the discomfort all but disappears.
He didn’t want to refuse her. She had been kind- extraordinarily so, kinder than he ever expected her to be, kinder than he deserved. But Potter, Potter with his explosive rage, his dangerous, fiery eyes, his accidental magic washing over Draco’s skin… it was too much. His fingers shake as he pulls open drawers full of medicinal potions, searching for the blue ones that always make his heartbeat settle down to a more manageable rhythm. Potter’s words still rattle around in his brain, casual words he threw around effortlessly like Azkaban and Daddy Malfoy and Aurors and Fiendfyre. Draco couldn’t imagine uttering them casually anymore. Every time they touched his tongue, every time they fell from his lips, they had to mean something, had to be worth something. Names held power, he had realised during the Dark Lord’s reign of terror.
“Malfoy,” he says instead. “Missing your mother isn’t reason enough to bring up that word. Or rail at your elves.”
He moves towards them, hesitant and unsure. It seems unlikely that they can see him, given their lack of reaction, but he doesn’t know how they would react to his touch. Whether it would be some phantom cold sensation churning their stomachs like the touch of Hogwarts ghosts. Whether his hand would pass right through them. But even as he reaches out, and very gently and delicately strokes his father’s week old beard, Draco doesn’t react.
“I’m so sorry,” he murmurs, trying his best to be soothing, dragging his fingers down the nape of Harry’s neck. “I should have warned you.”
“We’re going to pretend you didn’t say that while I have divorce papers in my hand. I am going to leave them on your sofa for now, and we’re going to go to the kitchen and I am going to make you eggs, and you will complain about how I make them runnier than you like them. Then, I will come back, ignore the divorce papers on your sofa while we fuck in your bedroom, and in the evening you will take me somewhere to have dinner. And when we come back here, I will put those divorce papers on your coffee table, possibly have a breakdown, which you will hold me through and then I will sign them. And then we’ll fuck again.”
Hermione is on the couch reading as usual. She raises her eyebrows when she sees him and teases, “A day early, Draco. The final review dinner is tomorrow, you know.”
“Like shit,” Scorpius says, wheezing a laugh that transforms into a cough quickly. “What did you think?”
Without a word, Draco stands up. Harry expects him to leave, but he doesn’t. Instead, in one move, he leans over the table and picks up the ring Harry has left on the table.
They’d struck up a tentative friendship, one based on book recommendations and supplies, until Granger had come in one day, frazzled and tired, with dark circles under her eyes so deep that Draco had wondered if she’d slept at all.
Draco wishes he had the patience to savour the exposed skin with touch and tongue, but he doesn’t. He needs Harry around him, within him, on him
When their eyes meet, Scorpius shoots her a wan smile he doesn’t expect her to return. Behind the apology in her eyes, there’s a familiar frustration, one Scorpius knows intimately. He feels an uncomfortable solidarity with her anguish over the utter inability to fix the situation like she does everything else– the sheer desperation of watching what had once been beautiful collapse in on itself.
The Curtained Room had been one of Draco’s favourite places to loiter in as a child. When he’d been here as a child, he’d slept in the adjoining child’s nursery as his parents had shared the large, downy mattress of the Blue Room’s opulent bed. But the Curtained Room had been the one he’d played in all day when they weren’t traipsing through the streets of San Gimignano to visit the vineyards on the outskirts.
“Which one would I like, do you think?” Draco asks and cringes immediately. It sounds like he’s asking for a book recommendation, or… or… an ice cream order or something.
Granger gives him a pointed once over and he is suddenly aware of the way his breath is shallow, his fists are clenched and his eyes are burning. Talking about Potter fucking always does this to him.
Harry laughs lightly and keeping his eyes on Draco’s, reaches under and circles a finger around his hole. He pushes and then pulls back, brushes lightly and then deepens the touch. He keeps alternating until the skin around Draco’s hole is moist with lube.
“Granger, right?” Draco continues. “She just wants you to come for fucking dinner. If you think I don’t understand that’s too much sometimes, you’re dafter than I thought you were. But if you would just tell her that, explain it instead of being some sort of elusive ghost who only shows up in the common room after everyone has gone to sleep, she wouldn’t keep asking. She isn’t worried because you aren’t doing anything Potter, she’s worried because you’re shutting all your avenues to ever do anything. She’s worried because you’re giving up.”
“It’s me. It’s Draco. You’re at 12, Grimmauld Place, the War is over. It is 5th December, 1998, the War is over. You’re safe in your home, you’re safe, the War is over. It is over, you’re safe, you’re alright.”
He blinks and he’s back in the motel, lying under a heavy duvet, still unable to move. Harry is hovering over him, face scrunched into an expression of such acute worry that Draco wants to pull him closer, wants to smooth it out, wants to wipe it clean.
Draco hadn’t known what to say so he had mutely nodded. Granger’s smile had widened as she said, “Good.”
It’s a complete disaster and Draco shoots a glare at Potter who looks absolutely mortified but oddly determined.
At this, Draco cracks a smile. He raises a hand and pushes it into Scorpius’ hair. It’s one of the things the Curse hasn’t taken– his hair. Like father, like son, he thinks wryly, immensely thankful for this one small exemption the Curse seems to have made. He doesn’t mind dying as much as he probably should, but he minds dying ugly far more than one in his position ought to. The Curse has wrecked a body that used to be muscled from Quidditch, but at least his face still remains acceptable, framed by the characteristic Malfoy blonde hair. Draco pretends to despair over the curly, untameable quality it seems to possess, but it’s often put upon– a little exaggerated. Scorpius knows that his hair, or the ruffled, messy nest it often transforms into, is a part of Harry that Draco can caress without having to examine feelings, animosity and a failed marriage up close.
Harry nods in acknowledgement. They both have people they love to tell, but not everyone is in a place to know.
Granger looks as though she doesn’t believe him and his heart clenches because there are reasons he can’t bring himself to call her… anything else. Reasons he doesn’t think he can intimate to Granger anytime soon. The way the Carrows laughed about the ‘Weaslette’, telling him how he ought never touch her with his bare hands lest his blood become tainted from contact. The discovery of what his father had done to her and how when Draco had confronted him, he’d merely said, she’s dispensable. He can’t tell her about those things, not yet, possibly not ever. He can’t explain how calling her Ginevra is his way of paying respect to her.
Red eyes. Red lights. Red, thick blood pooling around the raised lines of the Dark Mark. Red pride and red passion, whirling, whirling, whirling into red shame.
, the voices say, whispering in the silence of his mind. Nothing else matters, just this, just the here and now, just them in a dimly lit room of a Camden bar, trying to find salvation in a situation that has already damned them.
It had taken Hermione half an hour to calm herself while Harry had stared in shock from the other end of the kitchen table, not daring to leave her alone or go nearer. She had somehow managed to Floo Ron’s Healer after, and when she came in, Harry had fixed her a glass of water and a calming draught. Neither of them spoke much till the Healer came back down and said Ron would be alright, he had gone to sleep for now.
Draco simply lies there on the bed panting and trying to catch his breath. “No,” he says eventually, when he can trust his voice to not crack and his brain to not allow him to blurt out just how close he is to coming in those few words. “Absolutely not. In fact, quite the opposite. If we want to take this slow, you can’t go beyond that. That was…”
