His stomach rumbled ominously.  But as he'd planned to lunch with Draco as usual, Harry had declined Kreacher's daily offer of a packed lunch.
Draco looked shocked.  Which considering his exceptional ability to mask his feelings, was incredibly telling.  He nodded.  "Thank you.  That would be good."
"I don't understand," Draco says finally, his lips close enough that Harry feels the warm breath on his neck. "Why now?"
Harry slumped, once again, against the rough, stone wall of the house, and banged his head against it slowly.  "I still do," he said softly, before swallowing hard.
Before Draco had time to process, wonder at, or even question Potter's actions, he felt the gentle swipe of a thumb along his bottom lip – not even McGonagall
Potter a little too much.  And whilst the thought of Professor McGonagall's tartan bloomers could usually be relied upon to induce the taste of bile in his mouth, it was also a particularly effective way of lessening the tightness of his trousers.
"I remember this place," Malfoy comments as Harry pushes open the front door.  He peers inside.  "Looks a lot different now, though."
"What is it?"  Draco sounds concerned, but Harry can't tell for certain as his gaze is currently fixed on the table top.
It was on the tip of Harry's tongue to ask about Draco's other friends. He knew about Crabbe, obviously, but what about Nott or Goyle? He had no idea what had happened to them after the war, if Draco still saw them, or if he really was alone apart from Pansy. But Draco had already started to look uncomfortable so Harry decided that was a question for another day.
As much as he longed to roll back over and resume his dream, his bladder was rather persistently demanding his attention.  Flinging back his duvet, Harry stumbled to his feet and headed to his en suite bathroom.  It was at this point that he realised two things.  One, he was completely naked, and two, he had no recollection of going to bed the night before.
Harry laughed.  "Fair enough," he said.  "Think he'll be okay?"  he asked, with a nod towards the main doors.
"Good luck," she said as Harry stepped towards the grate. "And Harry, about that thing that we're not talking about any more – you should at least think about asking Blaise.  He'd know."
Hermione fixed him with a glare, and if the wince on his face was anything to go by, there'd been swift kick under the table as well. But Blaise just inclined his head in acknowledgement.
"Malfoy, we heard you.  It's nothing to be ashamed of."  The irony of him saying these words, when only a few weeks before he was wrestling with the same dilemma himself was not lost on Harry.
Draco turned his head and gazed down at her.  "Big day?" he asked, and massaged his temples with the fingers of his free hand.
Overwhelmed by confusion, Harry did as he was bidden. Now, camera in hand, he examined the box. "You bought me a camera," he repeated. "A really good
Draco remained silent for what felt like a long time and watched Harry thoughtfully. He lifted up his glass and took a sip, eyes still fixed on Harry over the rim. "You might be right, Harry," he said eventually. "Of course, if you tell anyone that I said that, I'll be forced to kill you."
Harry nodded, chewing furiously.  "I did.  I just don't know, though.  There were bits I liked about all of them, but there was always something that put me off."  He sighed and raked one hand through his already unruly hair.  "I just wish I knew what I was looking for."
"Don't patronise," Pansy snapped.  "It's not funny.  This morning it was sick in my knicker drawer!"
Ten minutes later, the conversation had warmed up, and Harry found himself surprised at just what easy company Malfoy was.  There had been the first signs of change in his character during the trials, but the man in front of Harry now bore little resemblance, other than visual, to the spoilt bully he had once despised.
Pansy's eyes widened in surprise and Harry almost fell out of his chair. "Just the three of us? That'll be cosy."
“If there is, Draco can’t find it.  And believe me, he’s tried.  If he keeps this up, I’ll end up having to hire one of those damn snow machines.”
Fortunately seeing it for the joke it was, Draco laughed in return. "Harry Potter has a sense of humour. Who knew?"
Narcissa nodded, and then turned her attention back to her shopping.  Draco just stared at her in amazement.  He couldn't believe it had been that easy.  Something that had kept him up at night since he was a teenager, that had twisted his insides into knots until he wanted to vomit, and she just accepted it
Letter finished, Pansy sank down onto the nearest bed and slowly raised her wand to cast the counter charm.  Before Draco could voice his anger at the perceived violation, she looked up at him, sadness evident in her eyes.  "You're not seriously considering this?"
“So what happened anyway?  Was he cheating on her?”  Harry wasn’t usually one for gossip, but this was the first time he had been alone with Draco all day and he wanted to prolong the moment.
Harry sighed quietly.  He hated disappointing Draco like this.  Draco was trying so hard, was spending his Sunday dragging Harry to numerous houses across the county, and all Harry could do was find fault with them.
He watched with a sinking heart as Harry headed towards one of the armchairs placed as far away from the sofa as possible.  "Sit here, please?" There was a time Draco would have been mortified at just how close to pleading his voice sounded, but right now he didn't care.
"I appreciate that this house is becoming more delightful by the day, but you need to get out occasionally." Malfoy paused for a sip of coffee, before adding, "People will start to think I've got you locked up in the cellar."
Before Harry could do more than nod in understanding, Malfoy seemed to stiffen in front of his eyes – almost as if he realised he had shared too much, and with Harry of all people.  He gave himself a visible shake, muttered something about an appointment with a Goblin and then headed towards the door with the briefest of goodbyes.
Girl or not, Harry stretched out his foot with the intent of kicking her, but Hermione was far too quick. She reached out and pinched a few more of his chips and sat back in amusement as she ate them.
Two hours later saw Harry pushing his way through the Leaky Cauldron’s doors. He scanned the room for a familiar shock of blond hair, and then headed to the bar when it became clear he’d arrived first.
Leaning forward and pressing an oh-so gentle kiss to the tip of Harry’s nose, Draco made a silent promise to himself, and to Harry, that he would never ever let go again.
In reply, Pansy got a cushion in the face.  "Fuck off," Draco replied, as good-naturedly as he could manage considering the stinking hangover he had.
“There are spells for this, you know?”  Draco’s hands fell to his sides and Harry missed the touch.  He didn’t, however, miss the slight pink flush dusting Draco’s cheeks.
Potter looked up – the shock Draco had anticipated written all over his face.  "Draco," he repeated slowly, almost as if the words felt foreign to him.
Something truly strange was happening – Draco was convinced of it.  Because instead of the scowl he'd fully expected to receive, Potter just wore a rueful grin and gave a shake of those damnable shaggy locks.
"Unlike some people, I have more sense than to bore my work colleagues with the minutiae of my life.  It's a policy you'd do well to adopt."
Draco flopped down, his head now cradled by Pansy's thighs.  "I don't want to talk about it."  He closed his eyes and allowed the touch of Pansy's hand on his hair to lull him into a more relaxed state.  However, it didn't help remove the rather horrific images of Blaise and Harry that had been tormenting him ever since breakfast.
Realising that this was the best he was going to get, Draco relented with a nod.  He watched for a moment as their friends trooped from the room, levitating a variety of boxes in front of them, and then turned back to Harry.  "Right then, Potter, let's get you to work."
Money wasn't the issue though. "It doesn't feel right to replace it," Harry admitted. He knew it was as silly as it sounded, but it was also the truth.
Harry knew Ginny well enough to know that she was playing her brother like a finely tuned instrument.  Ron, it seemed, was not so attuned to his sister's wiles.
Harry smiled to himself now as he slid under the bubbles, recalling Draco’s excitement at the suggestion that they live together.  Everyone else had thought that Harry was crazy, but three years on they had proved all doubters wrong.  He couldn’t imagine living anywhere else, or indeed
“Fuck off!” Dean was lucky he was out of reach, because right then Harry was very tempted to smack him in his smug face.
look.  "What do you want?" he asked tiredly – it really had been a long day, after all, and Blaise never troubled to get to the point unless prodded in that direction rather heavily.
Ginny, as always, was unfazed.  "I need you to come and help me chose Mum's Christmas present.  You are still going in on it with me, aren't you?"
the fact that most of his alternative remarks were likely to see him on the wrong end of a hex.  And then, because it occurred to him that after only a couple of minutes in Potter's company he had become as, if not more, inarticulate, Draco forced himself to continue.
Malfoy looked up and met his gaze now, expression somewhat rueful.  "Maybe.  But I'm not sure I actually meant it at the time."
"I'm not saying some of it wasn't deserved, or that they were the only ones, but they were still children. And with most of the Death Eaters killed or locked up in Azkaban, they bore the brunt of a lot of people's anger." Blaise paused then and took a sip of the tea Hermione offered him. "I think if it was just Pansy, that she'd brazen it out. She's got more balls than most blokes, that one."
Blaise had been something of a surprise to Harry. Silent, aloof – a snob, Hermione had called him once – but the warmth of his smile when it was bestowed on you was something else entirely. They'd become good friends during his time with Draco, and he'd helped soften the edges of Pansy's sudden presence in Harry's life. But they haven't spoken in weeks, not since Draco, and Harry has actually missed him.
Harry hadn't realised how quickly the time had passed.  He quickly drank the remainder of his coffee and then got to his feet.  When they had exited the cafe he turned to his friend and found himself pulled into another hug.
Draco suspected that was a lie but didn't quite feel confident enough to call him on it. "And what about now?"  He shifted an inch or two closer. "What do you think about it now?"
"If we are to work together," Malfoy said, clutching his books to the tense lines of his body. "I believe it would be advisable to avoid that topic altogether. Don't you agree?"
With each step, Harry's feet felt heavier.  He spotted a familiar red phone box looming in the distance, and just for a moment was tempted to slip inside and
Hermione was unfazed. "So, Ron, have you actually managed to ask her out, or is this going to be another seven-year-long courtship like we were?"
Standing up, Harry stretched and yawned expansively.  A quick glance at his alarm told him it was only 8 o'clock – far too early to be out of bed.    Were it not for how cute his friend looked rumpled from sleep, Harry would seriously have to rethink the offer of a spare room he'd made to Draco.
"That depends on how much you want him back," Pansy said, eyeing him steadily. "Draco's hard work; we both know that. You broke his trust as well as his heart – it won't be easy. But if you can stick around long enough to show that you mean it, then yes, I think it will work."
In the three hours since he'd been gone, Harry's home had been reduced to a shell – walls and floor stripped, and curtains pulled down. A quick glance at the dismantled fire place in the front room made the reason for Harry's extended journey apparent, and to top it all off, his house appeared to have been overrun by house-elves. What seemed like dozens of the little creatures were scurrying about wreaking more devastation as they went. When they started to pull the plaster down in the hall, Harry could watch no more.
The way Draco said it, and the look in his eyes, caused a shiver to course through Harry's body.  But he gave himself a shake – Diagon Alley, in broad daylight, was hardly the place.  "I can't believe you even have to ask that."  Harry gave his best pout – the one he'd learnt from Draco himself.
Ron shook his head quickly.  “No, I don’t think that - I know this is the first real home you’ve ever had.  But you have to make some kind of effort to get over him; otherwise it’s going to get to the point where the only solution is for one of you to leave.”
Against his better judgement, Harry lifted his head up off the bar and out of his hands – he'd buried it there after Blaise had actually groped the last bloke that caught his eye, only to lay the blame firmly at Harry's feet.  "Where?" he asked, regretting it the instant the words left his mouth.
Draco took this as a good sign and moved slightly closer towards him.  Not enough to startle, but just enough to feel like progress.  "Mother cancelled it.  She's informed the Greengrasses that the betrothal is over,
Draco backed out of his wardrobe, still on all fours, and turned to face the wide-eyed house-elf.  "No, thank you, Twinkie, I think I can manage."
They settle, in the end, for the TV, and Harry introduces Malfoy to the wonders of Netflix.  He was familiar with the concept of TV – few in the wizarding world escape without some Muggle influences now – but the concept of marathoning an entire TV show was still a mystery.
Harry grinned for a moment and then his face froze.  Draco chuckled to himself.  "Not the sort of mental image you want, is it?  Well it's ten times worse for me."
"And naturally she'll need some help to carry something of that size," Malfoy quipped, and then leant back in his seat with an air of smugness.
Hermione's smiling as he approaches, warm and approving. She also doesn't beat around the bush. "Well? How did it go?"
At that, Hermione beamed, but also flushed slightly.  She cleared her throat.  “We were wondering whether you would have room for two more on Christmas Day?”
Harry flushed.  He couldn’t help it.  And caught between a rock and a rather hard place, he turned his attention back to Ron.  Swallowing hard, he gave a shrug.  "War's over," he muttered.  "And we're not kids anymore."
Harry joined him. There was something freeing about admitting the truth out loud. And Malfoy was far enough removed from the situation as to make it easy.
Draco suddenly became incredibly interested in the table cloth.  "I'm sorry," he said softly.  "I didn't mean to lie, it was just—"
Harry glanced quickly in the direction of the door, and then turned back with a frown marring his brow.  "Really?  Like what?"
Harry turned and poked his tongue out briefly before turning his attention back to Neville.  "You'll be fine, mate.  He's in the hallway, and we can always draw the curtains on him if needs be"
Draco had to admit that the circles of evergreens, berries, and winter flowers did look rather attractive.  "Maybe he could do one for the Manor," Draco mused.  "It would have to be bigger, though.    Those would be a bit small to hang on the front door."
Ron just shook his head in amusement – he was much harder to provoke these days. "Where is my wife anyway?  You don't normally slum it on the pro-bono cases."
"Honestly," Hermione huffed.  "School's been over for years, Ron.  Besides," a sly grin crossed her face, "it's no more surprising than your regular night-time encounters with Pansy Parkinson, or the way Harry ogles Malfoy's arse every time he takes off his robes."
Even though he must have been expecting it, Malfoy still looked surprised by the question.  "You were there, Potter.  Surely I don't have to explain it to you."
Grabbing the first umbrella that came to hand, Draco opened it with a flourish and quickly raised it over his head.  "There, you evil creature," he declared triumphantly, as Hedwig's beat futilely against its surface.  Balked of her prey, she set to screeching in a most alarming manner.
Ron’s friendship with Viktor Krum had been another surprising post-war development.  Once the barrier of Hermione was removed, the two men had become surprisingly close.  Viktor had given Ron his first contract when he set up his own security company, and Ron happily took full credit for introducing Viktor to his now-wife - Lavender Brown.
Draco takes a step back then, but Harry's not willing to let go now. Not until he's cleared this up. Explained. "I miss you," he says again, and he's willing to go on saying it until Draco believes him. "I never wanted you to leave."
look.   It was remarkably similar to the one Harry wore whenever he came within ten feet of Ron and Pansy.
"How's she doing?"  Harry struck up a strange kind of friendship with Narcissa Malfoy after the war, something he can only hope to achieve with Draco.
Draco's face brightens as the topic takes this turn – no one who knew him would doubt his love for his family.  "She'll be back on form in no time.  You should visit," he says.  "She gets lonely sometimes, cooped up with only the elves for company.  And I believe she'd like to see you."
He looks tired, too. Harry can see the shadows under Draco's eyes as he closes the remaining distance, and suddenly the words he'd planned so carefully in his head aren't important. He just wants to
Draco shook his head.  "Hardly.  We kissed a few times in sixth year, then he left, and I've seen him a handful of times since."
Astoria picked up a pile of papers from the desk and shuffled them into order against its surface.  "Oh, he Floo-called earlier to set up appointment."
"Harry." Hermione's tone is careful and sympathetic and full of so much concern that it fills Harry with love and irritation all at the same time.
Harry made a non-committal grunting sort of a noise in response, and was gratified when he turned back to Malfoy to see that his wasn't the only face currently awash with heat.
Harry thought he'd have to be crazy to say no, but then it occurred to him that to leave they'd have to let go of each other, and after waiting so long to have Draco in his arms, that was something he was incredibly loath to do.
"But I don't have a small army of house-elves," Harry pointed out.  "And Kreacher's far too old to do it alone."
Harry did know that. Ron had never treated him any differently after he'd come out – apart from that awkward week he'd spent trying to fix Harry up with Charlie. Sometimes, though, he wished his friend would think a little before he spoke. Twelve years of friendship said that was very unlikely.
"They are, aren't they," Harry agreed, before pressing a gentle kiss to  Draco's temple.  "Will you come with me?"
Malfoy frowned a little as he flipped through the diary in front of him.  "We'll just have to do it outside of office hours then, won't we?"  He paused then, frown deepening.  "If that's all right with you, that is?"
of the day, Harry really hadn't been keeping track of time.  A quick glance at his watch explained why his stomach felt empty.
Harry knocked and what sounded like a muffled acknowledgment followed. Given their recent détente, he decided to risk entering.
All those years Hermione had been telling him to study harder, Harry had never dreamt it would lead to this.
Draco shook his head even as that thought occurred to him.  It was ridiculous.  He was completely and irrefutably gay – something both his mother and Astoria knew, yet chose to ignore.  Draco might not have draped himself in a rainbow flag and marched through the streets, but by the same token he'd never made any secret of his preferences.  One day he knew he'd have to ruffle their feathers substantially, but right now he preferred to take the path of least resistance – at least till he had someone worthwhile enduring all that fuss over.
"It's okay," Narcissa replied, before taking a delicate sip of her own drink.  "I know all about it.  I had the most informative letter from your friend Pansy – and a Weasley, believe it or not."
"Draco will see you now," she said pleasantly.  "Can I get you anything before you go in?  Tea? Coffee?"
Many times during their friendship Draco had been torn between the urge to kill or kiss his best friend, and now was no exception. Potter just looked rather confused by the encounter.
Draco's problem was irretrievable now.  He was hard enough to hammer nails, and there was no conceivable way he could move from his seat without the evidence being clearly visible to its cause.    And whilst Draco might have begun harbouring thoughts of a more impure nature about Potter, he had no intention of letting
"It looks worse than it is," Malfoy replied finally, as he stepped away from Harry and over to the table.  "You're going to be late for work," he added, not quite meeting Harry's gaze.
"I'm just saying what I see." Hermione sipped her wine slowly, dark eyes watching Harry carefully over the rim. "Blaise says he talks about you at work. A lot."
Apparently satisfied with this, Malfoy took out his wand and, with an extravagant flourish, resized the box. It wasn't wrapped so its contents were immediately apparent. Harry stared in stunned silence.
"I don't!" Sure, Harry had sneaked a few glances, but he was only human, and Malfoy was always…stretching.
Annoyed now, both at Malfoy for his impertinence, and at himself for having such ridiculous thoughts, Harry scowled. "Go where, exactly? All my friends are at work."
Ron sat back in his chair, faint smile still on his face. "Of course you do, mate," he agreed easily. "Just like you hate Malfoy, right?"
Harry shook his head before remembering Malfoy couldn't see. "No," he said. "I'm just looking round."
"Okay."  Harry nodded his agreement and struggled to stop his mind conjuring images at the thought of Malfoy's grasping him firmly.  "Only, I'm working days for the next couple of weeks, so it might be difficult."
"Fine."  Harry huffed, snatching the packets and stuffing them back in the bags.  "I'll make them.  But you're helping."
Harry got up and pointedly slid another couple of slices in the toaster.  “What?” he asked finally, taking pity on his friend who was clearly about to burst.
His smile is so bright, so wonderfully happy, that Harry completely forgets himself.  "Oh, Draco, that's wonderful news." And with that, Harry tugs him into a bone crushing hug.
"Men."  Hermione huffed.  "Did you at least talk?  Or were your mouths otherwise engaged all night?"
"Surprised to see you here," Blaise comments, tone casual as he swirls the ice in his glass, but it's a loaded comment and Harry knows it.
Harry was knackered.  He hadn't been sleeping well these last few nights.  Memories and demons that he'd thought long since buried had resurfaced to plague his rest.  Plus, a day spent tending a shop filled with excited children, all exclaiming loudly over the latest WWW invention, hadn't helped.  There'd been an unfortunate incident involving Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, a new shipment of Pygmy Puffs, and a wilful four year old by the name of Rex.
Draco opened his mouth to reply, but whatever he had planned to say was lost in the noisy clatter that sounded from their living room.
"Her?" Draco scoffed, but no one was listening to him.  Harry was already clambering into the driver's seat with Lucius at his side.
Part of Harry relished the fact he could read the paper without having to wrest it from anyone else first, but the other, more prominent part of him was too busy noticing how big and empty the old house felt now he was on his own once more.
Breakfast was quiet affair – it always was lately – heavy with Ron's absence and Kreacher's disapproval.  At least the elf had thought to put a warming charm on Harry's porridge – usually a sign he would be forgiven by evening.
“Harry!  You came!”  Small arms gripped tightly around Harry’s legs as he steadied the squirming boy. “We thought you wasn’t comin.”
Of course it would be. It was bad enough that Malfoy and his cronies had tormented Harry throughout school, tried to kill him during the war, now he was trying to steal Harry’s friends, his family.  But Hermione looked hopeful and he hated to disappoint her, so Harry gave the barest hint of a smile and said, “I suppose not.”
“Because I didn’t tell him when we were together before.  That there was this huge part of my life that I kept secret from him.  And the fact that Hermione knew didn’t help either.”
Clearly Potter was not troubled by the same distractions.  "Huh?"  He looked up, apparently reluctantly, from his parchment and frowned at Draco.
Ron's words more than echoed Harry's sentiments at the sight of Malfoy kissing Astoria Greengrass right in front of him.  Harry felt an old familiar clawing sensation fill his chest, and had to resist the urge to tear them apart and claim Malfoy as his own.  Which was ridiculous, Harry admitted to himself, because Malfoy
Harry flushed a little – that had been one of the reasons for his choice.  Not because he was embarrassed as such, but he’d never hear the end of it if Hermione got wind of this meeting.  That, and the fact the wizarding world was still entirely too interested in what Harry Potter was getting up to.
Hermione nodded, and then began digging in her handbag.  “I almost forgot,” she said, handing over a piece of parchment.
Draco squirmed and tried to escape before irreparable damage was done to his hair, and definitely did not think about how nice Harry's touch felt.  "It's not funny.  I could be traumatised for life."
Draco frowned, tiny wrinkles creasing his usually smooth brow – Harry's fingers definitely did not itch to smooth them away.  "But he owled.  Asked me to bring this over."  Draco gestured with the buff folder in his hand.
Harry winced and crossed his legs at the implication – threatened by two Slytherins in one day. Although, he suspected Pansy meant it rather more than Draco had.
Malfoy let out a sharp laugh in response and shook his head.  "I didn't think so."  He paused, and glanced nervously round the room before continuing.  "Look, Potter, you spent a couple of hours in my home last year, when our
"Draco."  Neville's been sounding progressively more exasperated every time the subject comes up lately.  "Just ask him out."
"It isn't…"  Harry shook his head. Malfoy annoyed the crap out of him at times, but it wasn't as bad as all that. "That's not true," he settled on finally. Not the greatest rebuttal, but the best he could manage on short notice.
Draco flipped a golden omelette out of the pan and onto a nearby plate.  He brought it over to the table and settled it in front of Harry.  "Here, that should help settle your stomach."
However, it all made sense when Malfoy pushed open the second door and flicked on the light. A soft red glow bathed the room, allowing Harry to see the counters built in around the edges. Their surfaces were littered with various sized trays, and lines were strung across the room, high on the walls – pegs in place ready to do their job.
"A little late for social calls, isn't it, Blaise?"  Draco dusted nonexistent soot off his sleeves and affected his best nonchalant manner.
Harry barked out a laugh at this despite himself.  “He’s really not.”  He paused for a moment, allowing a thought to form.  “It’s weird, hearing you talk about him like you’re friends.”
Draco stares, silent and intense, for what feels like the longest time, but finally gives the slightest nod and allows himself to be led to the centre of the room.
Draco’s chair scraped loudly in the silence that followed.  “I need to get back,” he said. “There are several press releases that need to go out this afternoon, and I can’t trust my halfwit assistant to deal with them.”
Harry turns and deposits his empty glass on a passing waiter's tray. He needs to look anywhere but at the truth in Ginny's eyes. "Why are you saying this now?" The
"Stop complaining."  Draco flopped onto the sofa with a brief smile at Hermione who was already seated there.  "One thing you had to carry.  Anyone would think I'd asked you to give Hagrid a piggyback ride."
Draco got to his feet and retreated to the other side of the room before replying.  “Sorry, but you’re not my type,” he replied.  “I don’t do Weasels, or any other rodent for that matter.”
rubbing against Harry as they had their goodnight snog on the sofa – but the more reasonable part of his brain pointed out that as they'd just visited his boyfriend's parents' graves, maybe it wasn't the best time to do it.
Harry leant against the wall of his friends' house and watched as his breath emerged in cloud-like puffs.  It was dark outside – only the muted glow from the kitchen window and the lone string of fairy lights around the door illuminated the gloomy garden.
"Silly," Hermione replied, smiling widely.  "I just wanted to see if you were free to have lunch with me.  We don't see nearly enough of each other nowadays."
Harry heaved an exaggerated sigh and turned his attention to the task at hand.  "These are lovely," he commented a moment later.  "Are they new?"
And for the first time since their arrival earlier that night, Draco took notice of the view outside.  He'd visited Paris so many times since he was a child that he had become somewhat blasé about it – but now, his arms wrapped around his boyfriend's warm body, hearing the awe in his voice, Draco saw the city through Harry's eyes.  "It really is," he agreed softly.
"Are you taking anything for that?" Harry asked when Malfoy finally sat back in his chair, eyes glassy with unshed tears.
Draco's eyes were still closed as he approached, and the way his neck arched, bare and vulnerable, made Harry long to run his tongue over every inch of pale skin.
Pansy relaxed and eased back into her chair. Ron was still watching Harry carefully. "You okay, mate?"
Potter's face broke into a broad grin.  "We can't have that, can we?"  He gave a brief chuckle, a sound which was both foreign and pleasing to Draco's ears.  "I'll see you tomorrow, Malfoy."
"And that's good." Hermione smiled tentatively. "You'd be a good friend for him to have. He'd be happy with that.
Blaise held up his hands in a placating fashion.  "I don't want to argue," he said.  "I'm just saying that if you got yourself a proper bed, then your back probably wouldn't feel like a troll had been tap dancing on it."
Pansy laughed at this.  "Don't worry, no one saw.  You're cold, heartless bastard reputation is safe for now."
“Apparently the wards over the Manor have some kind of weather control charm woven into them.  Between that and Hogwarts, Draco’s never had a snow-free Christmas.”
Harry took him at his word, but it didn't stop him mentally cursing his stupidity all the way to the bar.  Nor did it make him watch where he was going.
Yet whilst Potter seemed instantly to lose himself in his work, Draco's mind seemed unable to focus on anything other than his
"Imagine being a grandmother at my age."  She let out a tinkling laugh that warmed Draco's heart.  "Makes one sound so dreadfully old, don't you think?"
When Neville didn’t reply, Harry turned his attention to him and found his friend looking uncomfortable.
Harry was so interested in Blaise's return, and Draco's plans for him.  "No," he said firmly.  "Blaise is a little too narcissistic for my liking."
"It's fine," Draco replied; the lie tasted like ash in his mouth.  "It was just a spur of the moment decision."
"Right." Draco picked up his pen and scratched a few more notes on the napkin.  It wasn't much, but at least they were making some progress.  "Now, how about the bathroom?  Are you a bath or a shower person?"
in response and slid another hook in place. "So do you have plans in general? Or have you abandoned your Auror career so you can mooch about this house watching me?"
Harry walked into the living room towards Hermione and spotted an overnight bag by her feet. "Sorry I'm late." He frowned then, eyes on the bag. "Are you going somewhere?"
Harry pauses, drink halfway to his mouth, then gestures it in a kind of salute at his companion.  "So you do," he agrees.  The panic from earlier seems much more distant through the comforting haze of alcohol.  Or rather, it does until Malfoy's next words.
what you're worried about?"  Ron's tone was softer but was still laced with incredulity.  "How about you start checking him for mind control spells?"
Harry had thought Hermione was glowing before, but it was nothing compared to the expression on Draco's face as they locked gazes.  Suddenly the short space between them seemed like a yawning chasm; Harry could bear it no longer.  Heedless of their audience – and Harry suspected it would come as less of a shock to their friends than it should – he stepped closer.
Harry watched him go for a moment, before the empty glass in his hand reminded him of his original intent.
Blaise gestured vaguely with his hand, causing amber liquid to slosh dangerously close to the rim of the glass he held.  He paid no heed and continued to smile at Harry in the manner of one who had already imbibed a fair few drinks previously.
Blaise didn't wait around to see whether Harry kept the card or not.  With a quick farewell, he grabbed his coat and headed out of the locker room.  Harry remained where he was for a long moment, staring down at the business card in his hand.  If he hadn't been so exhausted he would have laughed at the irony of Blaise's parting words – because, based on what he'd observed recently, Harry would very much like for Draco Malfoy to
"I can't take all the credit," Draco replied.  "Pansy helped out a lot in the beginning.  And her investment meant I didn't have to ask my parents for money."
Draco just shrugged dismissively and intentionally missed the hidden meaning in both Pansy's words and her tone.  "Blaise is a self-centred, self-involved, manipulative, narcissistic tosser.  And he uses people, too."
For all that he coveted quiet, country living, Harry couldn't deny that the city held a certain charm at this time of year.  The crunch of thick snow underfoot, the bustle of excited shoppers, the lights of busy taxis as they hurried past – but Harry's favourite part was the small glimpses of Christmas he got through every passing window.
Harry laughed.  "Oh no.  There's not a chance of that.  You'd better tell your mother to get used to it."
"You might enjoy thoughts of Ron getting a large portion, Malfoy."  Harry's eyes glinted with amusement as his sipped from his glass. "I'd prefer to be able to sleep tonight."
Potter smiled then.  That beautiful, heart-stopping smile that just recently caused Draco's stomach to swoop every time he saw it.  "If there's one thing I've learnt over the last few years, it's that life's too short."
With a Herculean effort Draco held back every sarcastic comment or smutty innuendo that immediately sprang to mind.  It was a terrible shame he mused, because some of them were really rather good, but it hardly seemed the way to show his gratitude.  So instead he turned his attention to the newly-healed skin, which shone pink against the otherwise pale backdrop of his hand.
"I'm not even sure we're friends," Harry continued, and it was more like he was thinking out loud now, rather than simply trying to convince Hermione.  "Acquaintances, maybe."
Ron didn't say anything for a moment, he just watched Harry with one eyebrow raised in question.  Then he gave himself a visible shake.  "Didn't you hear what Parkinson said about him not getting it up?"
The outer office was empty when he arrived. Not that surprising though, given the reports Harry had heard of Malfoy's latest assistant fleeing in tears earlier in the week. Really, anyone with sense would make thick skin a prerequisite for that job.
Ron gazed at him thoughtfully and then got to his feet.  "I think I'll leave you to get on with it.  I was never very good with numbers."
It was more than Draco could bear.  He scoffed as convincingly as he could manage considering the bile rising in his throat.  "Whatever gave you that ridiculous idea?"
"However," he continued, "they live much closer to the Diagon Alley entrance.  The one I want to show you is here."  He swept his hand in the direction of the building behind with a flourish.
"Okay," Draco admitted reluctantly.  "So maybe they did the manual labour, but I was the one who told them where to put everything."
"Of course he's not, are you, Ron?"  Hermione said, as she shifted Hugo from one shoulder to the other.  "Not if he knows what's good for him," she added, and shared a conspiratorial grin with Harry.
"And they have one to you."  Pansy got to her feet and placed a hand firmly on Draco's shoulder, turning him.  "You've spent the last few years miserable and scared because of family expectations, and now you're going to let them ruin the rest of your life."
“Not sure,” Draco replied honestly.  “Something woke me.”  He tried his hardest not to focus on the feel of Harry’s breath ghosting over his skin.
No sooner had he sank onto the bench at Hermione's side, than she batted his hands away.  "Let me," she replied tersely, and then promptly slid the knot into place with just a little more force than Harry felt was necessary.
Harry grinned and Draco tried his hardest not to notice the way his eyes crinkled up at the corners.  "How about I rustle up some lunch for us – will you forgive me then?"
"Please."  Draco's voice was hoarse, and his hips bucked off the wall, pushing firmly into Harry's grip.  "I need—"
fault," Harry said, and then, before Ron could protest, he continued, "Draco told me what you and Pansy did, and I really am grateful for it. He also taught me a really interesting Impotence Hex, and if you don't want to become intimately acquainted with it, then for the love of Merlin, next time use a bloody Silencing Charm."
“You look beautiful.” And she really did.  The elegant ivory dress was nothing like Harry would have imagined she’d choose but it suited her perfectly.  He suspected Draco’d had a hand in the decision making.
Draco watched as Harry rolled his shoulders, evidently trying to work out some knots.  Draco's fingers itched to help him with that, but he was fairly sure they weren't at
"Yeah, well, some of them aren't so bad.  I mean, Theo's all right, if you like the bookish sort."  He let out a yelp and shifted suddenly.  "Ow!" He glared at Hermione.  "What was that for?  I was being nice."
Draco slipped out of his cloak and draped it carefully over the back of a nearby chair. "I know how he feels."  Then he spotted the glass of wine in Harry's hand.  "Is there one of those for me?"
The garden was covered by a thick blanket of snow, and in pride of place, in what once was the lawn, was a fat, jolly-looking snowman.  And Harry arrived just in time to see Hermione push a large carrot into place for a nose, while little Rose Weasley clapped excitedly by her mother's feet.
"Don't be shy, Potter."  Pansy leant forward a little in Harry's direction. "Someone should appreciate them, and they're clearly wasted on Weasley if he's conducting a torrid affair with Draco."
“I’ve got one last present to give you,” Harry admitted, enjoying Draco’s delight that showed plainly on his face.  “But I need you to put this on.”  He held out something in his hand and Draco looked at it askance.
“But for your own sake, if no one else’s, you need to let it go.  I realise friends might be asking too much.” Hermione gave a wry smile here.  “But would civility really be that hard?”
“You’re not going to believe what’s happened,” Ron declared, taking a seat at the table and casually snagging a piece of toast off Harry’s plate.
One thing Harry had to admit was that Draco had opened his eyes to new experiences, things he would have never considered doing before.  A prime example of this was the last outing they went on before Christmas – a classical music concert.
!!)  I had the outline of this story in my head from the moment I saw your sign up and it wouldn't let me rest!!  I've tried to get in as many of your requests as possible – it's possibly not quite as porny as you requested, but I hope you enjoy nonetheless!    Consider yourself glomped ♥
Ron flashed a quick look of betrayal at his partner, but given that the delay really was Ron's fault, Harry felt not the slightest hint of guilt. "I'm almost done, sir," Ron added. "I just have to check it through and sign it off. It'll be on your desk in fifteen minutes."
"I'm not ashamed," Draco protested.  But then he saw his mother's raised eyebrow, and added, "Anymore."
Harry sat back in his chair and ran his eye over the assembled guests at his table as they slowly picked over the cheese board that Draco had insisted on.   This was a collection of people he had never thought to see in a room together, much less on Christmas Day.  People who, a few short years ago, could have been counted upon to hex each other on sight, were now laughing and joking, as they pulled crackers and wishbones.
“I’m blue!” Teddy snatched the aforementioned train and sank down to the floor, chubby fingers immediately slotting the track together.
“You’re exaggerating.” Harry reached for his drink only to find the glass empty.  “You don’t think it’s a bit odd, him being a bridesmaid?”
There was something about the way he said it, or the slight curve of Malfoy’s lips that made Harry want to put him in his place.  “Yes. Just trying to imagine you in your bridesmaid dress.”
Harry started in surprise.  "What?"  He turned his head to face Draco, eyes wide and gleaming in the moonlight.  "Oh... no, not at all."  He shook his head earnestly.
From the lines of his body, Draco could see some of the tension slip away from Potter – or at least it seemed that way – so he ploughed onwards, allowing hope to flicker to life within his chest.
"Did you want something, Gin?"  Harry could already see that Malfoy had tensed up slightly, and his ex-girlfriend's presence had formed no part of his plans.
"He's doing a convincing job of it," Harry mutters bitterly. Because he's looked a few times – he's had to – and Draco's smiling at Astoria the way he used to smile at him.
Ron's laughter only irritated Harry further. He grabbed the nearest document and glared as if to burn a hole in it. "I'll fill this out then, shall I?"
"Of course."  Draco nodded.  "I'll see you soon.  And Harry, I'll see you for lunch on Monday as usual."
“I don’t know if she’ll expect it, but—Hang on!” Harry’s glass banged onto the table.  “Did you just say you’d asked Malfoy?
"It's very pretty," he said.  And with its thatched room and rambling roses over the whitewashed walls, that was something of an understatement.
And with those words, Harry's hopes of not having his life even further intertwined with a group of ex-Slytherins faded even more. Hermione had started it, and even though Harry had come to consider Blaise a good friend, he really didn't want to expand their group further. Nights down the pub with Goyle and Nott and, Merlin forbid, Malfoy, were really not how Harry envisaged his social life going.
"There were a couple of attempts to initiate intimacy on Mr Zabini's part, all of which were rebuffed by Potter.  Nothing happened between them."
If Harry had ever harboured concerns about Hermione's relationship with Blaise, it was moments like this, and the bright smile on her face that quieted them. It was a pairing he would never have imagined in his wildest dreams, but there was no arguing that it worked.
"To discuss business.  It was the only time I was free last week with my shifts the way they are. And since when have you and Pansy Parkinson been friends?"
Harry reached up and stroked Hedwig lightly.  "Sorry about that.  She gets a bit...territorial of me sometimes.  She gave Blaise a right good nip."  Harry turned to head back into the kitchen, pausing in the doorway to add, "I've never seen her react quite
"I know." Harry hopped up on the counter and watched as she pulled a roasting tin from the oven. "I'm sorry I turned you down so many times."
. He bit his lip to stop the word from escaping. It was futile though, because Hermione grinned broadly at Ron, ignored Harry's warning glare, and said, "You, actually. You and Pansy Parkinson more specifically."
"Muggle nonsense," Draco muttered disparagingly, but nonetheless did as requested.  As he closed the fridge door shut behind him, Draco stilled for a moment, to all appearances lost in thought.
"It keeps me pretty busy." Harry trailed one finger through the condensation on the side of his glass as he pondered his reply. "We've had a few big cases on recently, and we're not as well staffed as we could be. People aren't as keen to sign up as they once were."
The stare Hermione gave him was piercing, and Draco felt as if she were peeling away the layers of his emotions in an attempt to lay the truth bare.
“Well, I do.”  Luna smiled dreamily and allowed Harry to guide her in a turn.  “And Draco noticed too.”
"You come and see me after you've done a fifteen-hour shift, been puked on by no less than three patients, and groped by a rather frisky old woman, and then we'll see who looks like shit."  Harry tugged a clean T-shirt over his head and then eyeballed his friend.  "Tough day pushing pencils in the office, was it?"
Harry grinned again and turned to walk into the living room.  He stopped in the doorway and turned, an almost uncertain look on his face.  "I'll see you later, right?"
"Look, don't get—" Draco stopped and ran one hand distractedly through his hair.  "I've just come from the Ministry," he said finally.  "And I can assure you that Weasley is not there."
"People you're close to, yes."  Hermione gave his hand a meaningful squeeze.  "But it took a long time for you to get to that stage, and you
The sun was already well-established in the sky by the time Harry woke. Work on his bedroom had ceased while Malfoy made the final decision on the 'perfect colour palette', so Harry had made the most of the opportunity. Doing nothing was a lot more tiring than he'd expected.
"I suspect the only mind-controlling substance at work in this has already worked its way out of Harry's system.  Especially if his hangover is anything to go by."
as it was the Head Boy himself.  But Draco was fairly certain that to mention either now would be a sure fire way to end this unexpected détente.
Ron opened his mouth, seemingly to protest, just as Ginny played her ace.  "It's been a crap year for all of us, but Mum in particular.  The last thing I want to do is spoil her Christmas with a present she doesn't like.  You have to come and help me choose it."
"He's out there right now?"  Draco asked, somewhat redundantly given that he already knew the answer.
With Ginny's words still fresh in his ears, wreaking havoc with everything he'd through to be true, Harry feels like he's waking from a very long sleep. He wants,
"I said he was turning into a Muggle, which he is."  Draco slumped into a vacant chair.  "Is there any coffee?"
Eventually Draco got up.  Stretching his aching muscles, he let out a groan as they protested the motion vociferously.
"Then lead on."  Harry placed his hand on Draco's arm and braced himself for the squeeze of apparition.
Harry couldn’t help but smile in return. He remembered only too well some of Malfoy's more spectacular 'emotional' outbursts, and as far as he was concerned, it was better that Malfoy be like that than end up like either of his parents.
Malfoy looked up from his crouched position, stray strands of hair falling into his eyes. "You mean I don't look like the type to get my hands dirty."
"Hmm.  There's another lesson you need to learn."  Draco placed a steaming cup of coffee down on the bedside table.  "You're lucky a sore head is all you woke up with this morning."
Harry smiled.  That soft, indulgent sort of a smile that made Draco want to wrap him up tightly and keep him forever.  "Sorry."  Harry raised one hand and gently tucked a wayward strand of hair behind Draco's ear.  "I just didn't think that...well, she doesn't know about us yet, does she?"
"Shower?" Harry prompts – and he means both of them this time.  No point being shy when they've both just made each other come in their pants, is there?
"Hi," Harry said softly.  He'd played this moment over in his mind countless times throughout the day, and he was still no closer to knowing how it would go.
"Another time maybe."  Harry slides a package of daisy roots into the bag and rings the price into the till.  "That's thirteen Sickles and three Knuts altogether."
"I didn't think she was your type," Pansy commented, her tone held a lightness that Draco was not remotely fooled by.
"Thanks for the tip."  Draco eyed the food on offer warily, before following suit and selecting a sandwich – he figured they would present the least potential danger.
Pansy could have announced she was marrying a Muggle and it would have caused less shock.  With the notable exception of Ginny, all other occupants of the table simply
"Of course."  Harry might still be second-guessing his decision, but he'd made a commitment to Malfoy and had no intention of going back on it.  "There's some tea in the kitchen when you're ready.  Apparently you're a big fan of ginger cake?"
They smile at each other for a few moments, before Hermione makes a shooing motion at him. "Off you go then."
Pansy didn't speak for a moment – she just glared pointedly at Draco's hand still gripping her arm until he took the hint and relinquished his hold.  Then she turned to face him – her expression making it clear she was not fazed in the slightest by his actions.
Harry felt his eyebrows rise in surprise.  "He's causing trouble?"  He glanced over his shoulder at the door Malfoy had just left through.  "He doesn't look like he has it in him anymore."
, Potter," Malfoy repeated.  "It shouldn't have happened, and it won't again.  Let's just leave it at that."
Draco might not have planned to bring this up so soon, but he was never one to miss an opportunity when presented.
Malfoy made what sounded like a shushing noise and followed it with a dismissive wave of his hand. But he never raised his eyes from the parchment, clutched in long, slender fingers.
"Buying a house is a lot like falling in love," Draco said after a moment.  "You just know when you find the right one.  So don't apologise, or feel guilty, or whatever silly emotion your currently indulging it.  We'll find you somewhere to live."
Potter made eye contact this time – his gaze filled with a new steely determination.  "I'm not joining the Aurors."  His words were barely more audible this time, but they resonated loud and clear with Draco.
He raised his hand to his mouth, but before the first coppery tang hit his taste buds, Potter had reached out and taken hold of it with his own.
Harry was too busy muttering under his breath to pay it much heed.  Getting his feet in his trainers without actually undoing them first was proving to be more challenging than he had the energy to deal with right at that moment.  In the end he was forced to bend down and leverage the squashed heel from under his foot, or face hobbling home.  Though, judging from the twinge of protest his back gave when he finally straightened up, that was still a distinct possibility.
The ice cold water from the old pipes helped him to feel a little more alive, but the reflection staring back at him when he finally got his glasses settled, looked tired, old even.  The dark circles were the result of restless – and limited – sleep, and the look in his eyes, though indefinable, was something Harry was becoming all too familiar with.
"So, Hogsmeade next weekend," he said causally.  "Are you going?" And then because he realised with horror that it sounded almost like he was planning to ask Potter on a date, Draco added hurriedly, "I have to put up with Pansy nagging at me all day about Millicent – no one else will put up with her."  It was a little uncharitable – if not untrue – and Draco sent a silent apology to his best friend for the remark.
for some Tortellini.  Harry's tummy gave a rumble at the thought, and he looked up to find Hermione grinning back at him.
"What do you want from me?" Harry demanded as quietly as he could.  "One minute you and Ron are having a go at me for not getting out there, and now that I am, you're giving me the third degree.  Maybe I just want to have a little fun with no strings attached – what's wrong with that?"  He then sat back in his chair, arms folded defensively across his chest.
"Draco!  You in?  Have you seen this morning's paper? It's..." Harry entered the kitchen and immediately spotted their guest.  "Oh, hi, Blaise," he said awkwardly.
Harry smiled wearily at her and held up one hand.  “Don’t, please.  I’ve just woken up and my head is killing me.”
Added to that, Ron and Hermione had decided to get engaged.  Which was great. He was happy for his friends, truly.  But it had just led to a round of parties and celebrations that he really didn't want to go to – they were little more than opportunities for him to feel alone in a crowd, and reinforce how very much he was being  outgrown.
Harry had just begun counting again when the store room door opened with a loud creak.  "Sorry to disturb you."
"Well, apparently he got fed up with you moping and pining."  Draco paused here as he noted the expression on Potter's face – he held up his hands in a placating fashion.  "His words, not mine."  And when Potter nodded in acceptance of this face, Draco went on with his explanation.  "He persuaded Pansy – although  I have my doubts as to just how much persuasion was actually required – that they should write a little to my mother, basically telling her how barbaric it was to make me get married because I'm gay and…and because I have the hots for you."  Draco could feel embarrassment heat up his cheeks at those last words – he could only hope that the light was sufficiently dim that Potter would not notice.
“You’ve got to admit it’s a bit out there.” Ron reached over and began to refill Harry’s wineglass.  “Even by Luna’s standards.”
"Because it can't happen," Malfoy replied simply.  "It's not that I don't want to, but I'm getting married next year, and I…"
Hermione appeared at that moment, and the wildness of her hair tested Draco's tongue-biting to the extreme – but he managed it.
“Be sure to let me know if that changes,” Harry said, and leant forward until his lips almost brushed Draco’s skin.
Of course, the fact that it was Draco Malfoy did change things a little – Harry wasn't stupid enough to forget that – but school had finished a long time ago and they had both grown up since then, so Harry really didn't see why it should be an issue.  Ron would very likely think otherwise, Harry was certain of that.  But he was also equally certain that Hermione would take care of any temper tantrums that arose in that area.
“I was thinking that maybe I could invite you to the Manor for Christmas,” Draco said, sounding more than a little dubious.
Wanting something more, Draco's hands made short work of the buttons on Potter's shirt.  He took a moment then to slide his hands down the warm skin of Potter's back, before tracking their way slowly up his chest.
"You have no idea."  There's an awkward moment's pause then, where they both realise the potential implication of Draco's words.  "I didn't mean…" he starts, more than a little flustered.  "I just—"
“Imagine that,” Pansy commented causally.  “Obsessing over someone for so long.  You’d think people would have the sense to know when to give up, wouldn’t you?”
Hermione wanted to eat in one of the small cafe's that now littered Diagon Alley, and as Harry really had no preference, he agreed easily enough.  They grabbed a small table for two, right by the window, and Harry couldn't help but smile as he noticed Draco walk by – no doubt on his way to
Malfoy didn't answer straight away.  He held Harry's gaze steadily, eyes wide with something indefinable.  They were having what Hermione would have called
disapprovingly but didn't probe further.  "I do hope you didn't keep Astoria there until this hour?  Not tonight of all nights."
Only he wasn't gone, and Draco was surprised at just how happy he was to be proved wrong. Sure, Potter wasn't the chattiest of dinner guests, but Hermione and Pansy had monopolised the conversation with shop talk until Ron complained vociferously. And he couldn't remember Potter every being particularly talkative anyway.
"oh, we know," she says. "Especially now we have Rose."  Hermione turns then and glances at the clock on the wall.  "Speaking of which, we really should get going and relieve the babysitter."
It's hard to say who's more surprised by the words – Harry certainly hadn't intended to say them. But he's not taking them back. Not when they're already three years too late.
"So, why don't we start by getting an idea of what it is you're looking for?"  Malfoy smiled expectantly as he looked at Harry.
"I see more than Draco does. He's so caught up in loving you that he forgets you're only human sometimes, and that you can't read his mind. You messed up. You
Harry nodded absently.  "Okay."  But he didn't look at Ron at all, he was too busy staring at the gently steaming bag by his side.
Draco looked over at his friend thoughtfully for a moment before turning to face Harry. "I'm just glad she has something else to focus on. Gives me some peace."
He waited a few moments at the bar to be served, and was just about to place his order when a sharp dig to his ribs had him yelping in pain.  He turned around ready to give short shrift to his assailant, only to be confronted by the piercing gaze of Pansy Parkinson.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Harry managed to say once he’d unstuck his tongue from the roof of his mouth.  But he really wasn’t fine, because the image of Malfoy’s pale collarbone was burned into his brain, and, Merlin help him, he wanted to taste.
Draco resisted the very real temptation to kick Blaise under the table.  He settled, instead, for praying the insinuation in his friend's tone had gone over Harry's head.
"That's easy for you to say, Parkinson.  It's not your house he's hanging in."  Harry turned to Draco, an almost pleading expression on his face.  "Are you sure you can't keep him at the Manor?  It won't be for long."
Harry sat back in his chair now, hands gripped firmly on the arms.  "No," he said.  "I'm not... I don't want anyone messing around in my head."
"How did you know my address?"  Draco peered around the room in surprise, as if he'd expected Harry to take him elsewhere.
, Harry couldn't help but wonder what the hell he was doing there.  He'd withstood criticism of his living arrangements for years, and honestly, although an actual bed would be nice after a long shift at St Mungo's, Harry genuinely didn't mind his flat.  Yes, it was compact, a little on the basic side, but it had everything he needed – room for the aforementioned bed notwithstanding.
Harry nodded his agreement.  In fact, ever since Hermione had announced her engagement he'd been thinking over how little he currently saw of his best friends.  He gave a quick glance at the clock.  "I just need to owl Draco," he said, grabbing a nearby quill.
Whatever Draco might have said in response died on his lips at the sound of the front door opening, followed by Harry's voice.
Harry shrugged, feigning an apathy that really wasn't there. "I didn't have time for it. I was so busy with Auror training, and there was Ginny at the time. She didn't like me wasting time on this instead of spending it with her, so it was just easier to stop."
"Hmm, I suppose," Hermione replied, not sounding terribly convinced.  "Blaise seems nice, don't you think?"
Though he hadn't meant to say it, that seemed to be the spark that broke the tension. Because the look of mild alarm left Harry's face and he let out a laugh.
Ron twisted in his seat so that he was fully facing his friend.  “Harry, I’m just suggesting you give them a chance - go on a date, have a few drinks, get to know them a little - not bond to them for all eternity.”  He paused and took a swig of his drink.  “It’s got to stop, mate,” he said finally.  “It’s not healthy.”
Both Ron and Pansy were too busy trying to fight their blushes to pay heed to his use of surname, so Draco turned his attention back to the conversation and looked expectantly at Harry for a response.
"Ah, Malfoy."  George seemed completely unabashed by his current attire.  "How nice  of you to drop by."
Blaise chewed his way through the next mouthful, a thoughtful expression on his face.  "Shame, that," he mused.  "You look good together."
"I just don't want him to feel he can't talk to us."  Molly huffed slightly at her husband, who just beamed back at her.
Draco nodded, and Harry hurried from the room, wondering if Hermione would mind him using an ever-so-gentle Body Bind on her daughter, given the circumstances.
"And we will," he said. "But not right now.  I'm talking to Blaise and..." Malfoy paused then for a moment and frowned a little.  "My apologies," he said after a moment.  "Potter, I don't believe you've been introduced to Astoria Greengrass – her elder sister, Daphne, was in our year at Hogwarts."
Draco felt the heat rise in his cheeks at the memory of that particular evening – Harry's hands smoothing cream all over his naked...Draco brought that line of thought to a halt immediately.  A hard on at the dinner table was hardly appropriate.
The walk to the dance floor seemed endless; feet seemed like miles. And yet, despite that, Harry arrived at his destination far too quickly for his liking.  His instincts were screaming at him to run, to head back to the bar and get extremely drunk, but one look in that direction showed Pansy was watching him with a terrifying glint in her eyes, so Harry coughed instead.
"If it was anyone else, maybe.  But when have you ever known Blaise not get his hands on what he wants?"
Then Harry's tongue found that spot, the one just behind Draco's left ear that turned him into the horniest of Hufflepuffs, and Draco's patience came to a crashing halt.
He watched with anticipation as Draco opened his eyes, discovering that it wasn’t rain landing on his skin, but the softest, whitest snowflakes ever.  He stood there for a few moments in silence, arms outstretched, a look of wonder on his face.  Harry thought he’d never seen Draco look more beautiful than at that moment, but seconds later, he found himself with an armful of snow-covered blond, and the ability to think was swiftly lost.
"Then bring a date," Blaise says, like it's something incredibly simple, and not at all designed to make Harry's head explode with potential jealous rage.
"I know, Mr Grinch."  Hermione gave him a playful nudge.  "Come on, I need this done for tomorrow night, and you're not working today.
The faint smile became a full one now. "Okay, so not the best choice of words. But I'm a Black as much as I am Malfoy, and I'd be honoured to take on this project. If you'll let me."
Harry shrugged awkwardly – this wasn't a conversation he really wanted to be having with anyone, and certainly not Ron of all people.  "I dunno.  He'd already gone when I woke up this morning."
Malfoy seemed aware of this because he shifted awkwardly, his eyes warily taking in their observers.  "Look, Potter," he began, and then cleared his throat before continuing.  "I'm not sure I ever properly thanked you for what you did for my mother.  And for me, too."
Hermione didn’t reply though.  She turned back to Harry with a determined expression in place.  “School’s over.  We’re not going back to Hogwarts, and frankly, I wouldn’t want to.  You need to start looking forward and stop living in the past.”
"It can be both," Malfoy insisted.  "My parents had an arranged marriage, and whatever else they may be, they do love each other."
"No, no," Harry said hurriedly, for fear of causing offence, and also because a large part of him was still that little boy in a cupboard who was never given anything.  "I want it.  Please."
With a flick of his wand and a few murmured words, Malfoy conjured a small ball of light that cast a soft glow around the enclosed bed.  Harry wasn't sure that he didn't prefer the darkness – it was going to be
Harry eagerly grabbed the supplied cutlery and dug in.  As the first bite hit his tongue, he let out a groan of satisfaction.  "You keep serving me food like this and I might just have to keep you."
If there was one thing his experiences during the war had taught Draco, it was to pick his battles wisely.  Giving in gracefully still posed something of a challenge, though.
"I don’t know why you felt the need to keep it a secret from us," Molly continued.  "Did you think we wouldn't be happy for you?"
The guilt in Harry's belly twisted painfully at her words and at the return to surnames. "I never meant to hurt him."
Surprisingly, Malfoy had been open and receptive to Harry’s overtures, and before too long a fledgling friendship had sprung up between them.  What started out as brief chats over a mid-morning tea break progressed to a standing lunch date in the Ministry canteen, and ended up as regular nights in the pub, interspersed with the odd Quidditch game.
Malfoy raised one eyebrow in interest. "SPEW?" he repeated, then turned to Hermione. "Is he going to vomit or something?"
Harry took a long swallow of his pint before responding.  It was probably a fair point, and he didn’t want to snap at Hannah.  “We’re definitely not mates, no.  But I’d like to think we’ve both grown up a little since Hogwarts.”
It wasn't so much guilt that compelled him to attend now, as it was Hermione.  She had made some long, passioned speech – which Harry had only partly listened to – about how he was still a beacon of hope for many, especially as the post-war world had failed to herald the brave new order most had hoped for.  Harry rather thought that working eighty-hour weeks at St Mungo's was him doing more than his part for the wizarding world – Hermione, apparently, begged to differ.
Parkinson just nodded.  "Okay.  Well, you can go through then."  She gestured in the direction of the office door with a wave of her hand and then settled herself behind the vacant desk and watched him.
Draco shifted in his seat and mentally cursed that summer's growth spurt which had left his trousers with little or no room to spare.  "I never knew you were such a budding Healer, Potter."
Malfoy grabbed his arm and dragged him inside. "You can do that in here." He gestured at the house around them before returning his gaze to Harry. "So, what do you think?"
Draco squirmed slightly in his seat – a mixture of discomfort at his wound and at the knowledge that not even McGonagall's underwear could help him this time.
Harry knew a thing or two about guilt himself so he wisely didn’t comment on that.  “Still, it’s really good of him,” he said instead.
Harry's owl – Hedwig, Draco recalled – was perched on the end of the banister, eyeing him suspiciously.  Draco'd never had much to do with the owl in the past, beyond retrieving the odd letter.  But as they were going to be living in the same house, he felt some kind of effort was necessary.
"You're taking an awful long time about it."  Potter grinned and Draco found himself forced to reconsider everything he'd thought he knew about the Boy Who Lived.
Conscience satisfied, Harry set about relieving himself, musing over the previous night as he did so.  If he was honest, Harry had to admit it hadn’t been as bad as feared.  In fact, after an incredibly frustrating day spent Christmas tree shopping with an increasingly snarky Draco, it had actually been quite a pleasant change.
And that settled that, Harry told himself.  At least now he knew how things stood with Malfoy, and he could focus on finding himself a house rather than a boyfriend.  At least he'd have his godchildren for company occasionally.
.  "Can we stop this, please?  I do not fancy Draco."  Then, before Ginny could dispute this, as her expression clearly said she was about to, Harry added, "He has a girlfriend.  They're on the verge of living together, by all accounts.  Besides, you're on the verge of giving your brother a stroke."
“I was talking to Weasley earlier.  It seems he’s trying to pair Potter off with some bloke who works for him.”
"That's the first time you've ever called me that."  Malfoy's eyes were wide with surprise and just the faintest hint of a smile curved his lips.
It took Draco a moment to realise that Potter was prompting him.  In his defence, he had been exceedingly distracted by the way Potter's tongue flicked out to wet his lips.  "So," Draco repeated, buying himself a moment to get his brain under control.  He settled the menu on the table in front of him and then leant forward.  "I'm curious, Potter.  What prompted you to become a Healer?  I always had you pegged as an Auror."
Hermione nodded.  "That's understandable.  You must have a lot to sort out, and Draco will have quite a bit of explaining to do."
A few short minutes in the ladies lingerie department, and Draco couldn't have been happier that he was gay.  The sheer volume of the selection just boggled his mind.  Different colours, styles, fabrics – he wouldn't have had the first clue where to begin.  Pansy, on the other hand, did.
"Close your mouth, Harry," Draco chided.  He reached out and tipped a finger under Harry's chin.  "It's not a good look on you."
Someone was calling his name. A rather irritated someone by the sound of it, and it brought Harry back to the present. He'd been staring blankly at Malfoy for some time now and had yet to speak. With a vague hope that this was some kind of a dream, Harry blinked rapidly. To no avail. Draco Malfoy was very definitely on his doorstep. And he looked almost concerned.
“Second date?”  Draco’s brows rose slightly.  “That’s little presumptuous, don’t you think?”  But the warmth in his eyes told the truth.
But right then he just didn't care.  Ron's words had set his mind working overtime, and Harry was busy reanalysing his every interaction with Draco over the last few months.  He wasn't completely clueless, despite what Ron thought.  Harry was more than self-aware enough to understand his own feelings for Draco had long since passed the friendship stage.  But the idea of reciprocation was definitely new.  Draco had never given any indication that he wanted more – had he?
Potter's expression went through a myriad of emotions in the shortest of time, ranging from disbelief, to hope, before finally settling on one that resembled happiness.  "I
The horror in Draco's eyes was only a little bit faked.  "Potter, I suggest you leave now before I am forced to kick you again."
"Potter." Draco started slowly, unable to believe the words that were about to leave his mouth.  "Are you trying to flirt with me?
“Why the fuck is Malfoy owling me?” He might have been Draco under Teddy’s watchful eye, but it would be a long time before Harry thought of him that way.
"No."  Hermione blinked furiously and then scowled.  "And never mind about me, what about you?  When are you going to start telling people? Draco's made the first move; it's your turn now."
"Wonderful." The relief was visible on Malfoy's sharp features. "Now, why don't you invite me inside and we can talk about what it is you're looking for. I was given to believe that a complete overhaul was needed."
The change in Hermione's demeanour was noticeable, as she shifted into business mode. "Aurors Weasley and Potter have detained a client of ours in a recent potions raid," she said, and slid a parchment over the desk.
His name was called just as Harry's hand came to rest on the door handle.  He paused and turned to face the source of it.  "Yes?"
In response, Harry reached up and removed the blindfold.  “Happy Christmas, Draco,” he said softly, and then stood back to await the response.
"That's how you give presents?" Harry shook his head, a smile on his face. "You must be a joy to be around at Christmas."
Narcissa took her leave then, only to come to a halt at the foot of the stairs.  "And don't hurry home on my account."
"Thank you for your help.  Both of you."  Draco suspected there were generations of Malfoys turning over in their graves at those words.  But times had changed, and considering he was now living with Harry Potter, so had he.  "You'll have to come round for dinner soon."
Draco's eyes widened as he inspected the bags contents again.  Sure enough there was the exact same jumper, only in grey, and in purple.
Pansy shrugged lightly and snagged the open catalogue off Draco's lap.  "It wasn't so obvious when there were four of us.  But now Tracey and Daphne are gone, it's just so...in my face!"  Pansy began rapidly flipping through the catalogue, her fingers snapping at the pages, while she paid no heed to their contents.  "And that damn cat of hers!  She lets it sleep on the bed.
After she'd saved his life, Harry had struck up an acquaintance with Narcissa Malfoy that most, himself included on more trying days, found difficult to understand.  On the surface they had absolutely nothing in common, but Harry had, over the years, developed a grudging respect for the woman who had risked everything to protect her family.
It's a fair point, Harry thinks.  He has definitely plans to avoid Hermione for the next three days.  Ron will be easier – he's got his own shadow to deal with.
That was where it all started, and Harry reserved the right to blame Hermione for everything that followed.
"Can't," Draco said, then turned to flick his wand at the stove before the bubbling pan there boiled over.
"Really?"  Draco felt slightly uneasy at the knowing look his mother sent him.  "So you weren't planning to marry a girl you don't love to placate your father and avoid telling us both that you're gay."
"What... did you...?"  Harry shook his head in an effort to clear his thoughts.  But all he could manage to say was the one phrase that was echoing loudly in his brain.
Draco's expression remains neutral. "Is this some ridiculous jealousy thing, Potter? Because Astoria is—"
With his original plan now seeming unlikely, he went for the next best option – caffeine. And hopefully some time to calm down before he set off in search of Malfoy.
"The bonds will allow for the removal of clothes," Auror Kettlewell continues, and ignores the various sniggers this produces.
Harry sat bolt upright at this piece of news.  "You're calling the wedding off?" he asked worriedly.
Harry almost chokes on his tongue when he hears this, and if she weren't out of reach, he would be kicking Hermione right now.  Draco doesn't seem particularly phased though.
Hermione smiled at his reaction.  "Next month."  Then she leaned over the table slightly.  "We just found out that I'm pregnant."
Hermione laughed and Harry made a mental note to check himself for mind-altering hexes later. He was either in some kind of alternate reality, or this was one very convincing hallucination.
The journey was made in silence and it was possibly the most uncomfortable few minutes of Harry's life – every moment spent waiting to be rebuked for his actions. By the time they arrived at the main doors, none had come, and Harry was perplexed by the whole situation.
"Really?" Ron quirked an eyebrow in question.  "Because that's not what he's been saying.  Not according to Pansy, anyway."
"I don't mean that you'd do it deliberately. I know you wouldn't do that. But, Harry, you don't always think first, and Draco's…well, he's been hurt a lot already. Blaise and I, we're just worried about how he'd react if he found out why you're doing this."
“We don’t have time,” Draco said, resisting.  “Dinner’s ready, and Mother doesn’t like to be kept waiting.”
Potter gave a sheepish smile, which really didn't help matters, and inspected his thumb.  "You had a bit of blood there," he said, and his words were swiftly followed by a gentle flush of pink across his cheeks.
“You may have mentioned it once or twice, but it always bears repeating.”  She grinned.  “That ought to win you a few brownie points,” she teased, glancing over to where Draco was hauling an uncooperative Pansy to her feet.  “Not that you need the help judging from tonight.”
“Probably best that you don’t touch, then, Weasley.”  Malfoy had approached without them even noticing.  “Harry,” he said.  “Good to see you again.”
"That's not true," Harry replied defensively, but the words rang a little truer than he felt comfortable with, and even the pointed look he gave at her hand on his didn't eradicate the feeling.
Draco didn’t seem to see anything out of the ordinary, though.  He sat back in his chair and chewed thoughtfully.  Harry, meanwhile, could still feel the ghost of Draco’s touch on his hand.
There was no mistaking the voice that time.  Even with the surprising affection in the tone.  Harry smiled sleepily and opened his eyes.  In the dim light of his bedroom he could make out Malfoy's face, mere inches from his own.  And the concern writ there was obvious.
Which was rather a worrying challenge, but Harry was fairly confident that Hermione was unlikely to poison him – not intentionally, at any rate. "That's not bad," he said, before going back for another sip.
work wear is still very much on the smart side of the spectrum – Harry is a big fan of those tailored trousers.  "Is that for me?"
Before the silence became awkward, Harry nodded.  “Okay, as long as you keep your cold feet off me.”
Harry isn't particularly vain, but after a morning's manual labour he knows he must look a fright.  And now Draco seems to be a permanent fixture once again, Harry's work wear has had to return to the more practical of his clothes out of necessity.  He is wearing the jeans that Hermione said made his arse look good, though, so with a deep breath he heads across the yard.
Ron sat back against his pillows apparently satisfied with this answer – Harry only wished he could convince himself so easily.
Harry watched as the Malfoy and the tailor began to gather armfuls of robes.  “This must be costing you a fortune,” he said, with a wince at the thought of it.
"But you said yourself how much she was looking forward to it."  Narcissa stopped then, in a dramatic fashion Draco recognised all too well.  She gave a shake of her head, followed by a pained wince, and Draco knew all was lost.  "No," she continued, "I just can't bear to think of that dear girl let down so.  I shall take a potion and hope for the best.  I should still be able to get ready in time if I hurry."
"Do you want your calves to look fat," was all Draco said by way of explanation, before selecting a different outfit and placing it in her hand.  "Try that one."
"Would Master Harry like his coffee now?" Kreacher was entirely too smug about his permission to use
"Exactly."  Ron grinned smugly.  "You eat lunch with him every day, and when you can't, he does this."  Ron gestured to the nearby bag of food.  "And people say
Ron's expression spoke volumes about the possibility of that happening.  Harry wasn't even sure he and Malfoy got along yet, and there were generations of feuding Weasleys and Malfoys to overcome.
Ron nodded, but his expression said he had about as much idea of where Blaise was going with this as Harry did.
Showing he had lost none of his old Seeker skills, Draco’s hand shot out and intercepted the drink, much to Harry’s dismay.
As it transpired, this was one of those occasions where he wasn't hiding his feelings nearly as well as he thought he was.  After hanging a particularly ancient-looking frying pan from the rack, Harry turned to face him with a rueful smile.
Draco spun round with such alacrity that he set a pile of booklets tumbling to the floor off his desk.  Astoria dropped to her knees immediately and began gathering them.  Draco, however, was too busy staring at the new arrival to pay it any heed.
"It better be." Robards was fair as bosses went, but Ron and Harry both knew better than to cross him. "It's already a day late. Any longer, Weasley, and you'll be spending the weekend on stakeout with Dawlish."
"No, Potter."  This time Malfoy did smile just a little – it was an expression Harry was certain had never been directed at him before.  "I don't think we're quite at best friends yet, but I no longer consider you an enemy."
“No, it’ll be great,” Harry enthused.  “We won’t have to pretend to like sprouts, or cranberry sauce, or play parlour games because Percy sulks if we don’t.  We can have pizza, and beer, and watch football.  We don’t even have to change out of our pyjamas if we don’t want to.”
"And yet you managed to find the words to tell Ginny quite easily.  And I wouldn't mind betting that Hermione knows."
Potter just sat back in his chair and smiled, clearly not fazed by Draco's remark.  "So what about you?" he asked.  "I'm pretty sure you didn't want to be an Estate Agent in school."
"Hermione," was the only explanation that Harry offered. Apparently it was sufficient because Malfoy's expression relaxed notably.
But subtlety was still not Harry's strong point, even after four years in the Aurors, and it wasn't long before Draco caught him in the act.
Harry's cheeks flushed at the implications of that.  "Behave," he muttered, before digging deep into his robe pocket.  A moment later he produced a crumpled slip of paper and thrust it at Draco.  "There you go."
the look on her face told Harry he was being manipulated, but Hermione was an expert in her field and he was sucked in nonetheless.  "Nothing's going on."
Secretly Harry was a big fan of the uniforms – it made getting ready for work so much easier in the morning. And truth be told, it had never hurt when it came to attracting a little wanted attention. Not that he was going to confess that now. "It's not so bad," was all he said, before adding brightly, "and we do get discount in the Ministry canteen."
.”  Hermione’s tone raised a notch and sounded most put out.  “Don’t I?” She turned to her husband for support.
Harry makes a noise of displeasure when Draco pulls back, even if it is the shortest of distances.  And he settles his hands firmly on Draco's hips, determined he will go no further.  "Well," he murmurs, nosing his way along Draco's jaw.  "The hat did want to put me in Slytherin."
“It’s empty right now.”  Harry took a deep breath, prayed he wasn’t about to make a fool of himself, and held his hand out.
Draco tried very hard not to think about the level of thought Pansy clearly gave to his sex life, and instead addressed another problem with her statement.  "I think your more Potter's type than I am."
The awkwardness that followed was less than pleasant, and Harry cursed Ron afresh for his current attire – no doubt it looked like glory-hunting to Malfoy.
Auror Kettlewell's definitely fighting a grin this time, and not very successfully.  But Harry's more distracted by the feel of Malfoy's breath on his neck as he murmurs, "Which one d'you think we'll be?"
"To see your parents?  Oh, Harry, that's lovely."  Hermione squeezed his hand tightly, and her eyes had a suspiciously glassy sheen.
Hermione didn't answer straight away. She retrieved two mugs from a nearby cupboard and set them down on the counter, before reaching for the coffee.
later, and Draco was forced to watch, frozen by both magic and horror, as his best friend read all about the one thing he had hoped to keep hidden from her for as long as humanly possible.
Harry handed his money over the counter to the waiting assistant.  "He never said.  George, I mean."
Harry sighed with relief.  Even though there was nothing between Draco and him, he couldn’t bear to think he had cheapened his feelings with a drunken one-night stand.
Again Potter displayed none of the rancour that Draco had come to associate with these kinds of interactions.  Instead, he appeared rather uncertain.  Nervous even, if the way his fingers were twitching his quill was anything to go by.
Harry gave a weak smile and turned his attention back to his fingers, which were mindlessly plucking the label from his beer bottle.
Draco marvelled at his own behaviour.  Although he always acted in the best interests of his clients, he was usually ruthless when persuading them to sign on to an investment that he believed was worthwhile.  The commission alone was enough to keep him in fine wine and fancy new robes; his wages went, untouched, straight into his personal vault.
"That would be great, Kreacher.  Thank you."  Harry shook his head slowly as the elf left the room – Malfoy had only been in the house five minutes and already he had their house-elf running round after him.
Harry's heart sank, and he was just about to bemoan his fate when a waitress wandered over to clear their table.  He decided it probably wasn't the best time to start complaining about magical portraits of dead people that spoke and acted just as unpleasantly as they had when they were alive.
"I should have known." Harry wasn't remotely surprised. If he hadn't been so caught up in Draco this evening, he would have known this was coming. Hermione never could stand to be outside the loop in anything. "I'll put the kettle on, shall i?"
It was only when Draco began to twist that Harry realised what he meant to do.  The familiar sensation of Apparition squeezed every part of Harry's body, but in a matter of seconds they landed with a bump.
“No,” Harry said hurriedly.  “I know you are.  I just meant, it’s weird, you know?  In school, you two were all—”
It was a valid point well made, and Harry felt the moral high ground shift from under his feet.  "I told you where I was going though."  He finally dropped to the mattress at her side.  "What did you actually expect to catch me doing in the library of all places?"
Harry made a mental note to probe Blaise further about that when they were alone – Blaise was possibly the biggest gossip he knew and, with a few more drinks inside him, Harry knew he'd get his answers in no time.  So instead, he said, "Give her my regards." Malfoy agreed that he would, and just like that Harry found himself exchanging pleasantries with Draco Malfoy.
"No."  Draco carefully tugged off his gloves as he spoke.  "I have a matter of business to discuss with him.  I was given to understand he was due for a break shortly."
Harry ignored the portrait, turning instead to his friend.  "Are you sure we can't stick him up in the library."
Harry couldn't help the answering smile that curved his lips. "Absolutely. It's a lovely house," he added, with some vague idea of being courteous and trying desperately not to think of the last time he had been there.
Harry couldn't help but wonder what had happened to the previous occupants of those houses – he had a fleeting vision of Malfoy, wand in hand, chasing them off the premises.
For all that Draco Malfoy had been a constant blight on Harry’s life at Hogwarts, after the war he seemed to become invisible.  There was the occasional mention let slip by one of his friends – Hermione, he knew, had become far too forgiving during her eighth year, and Luna, who seemed to have taken leave of the rest of her senses, had worked past her captivity to become actual friends with the little ferret.  But, for the most part, Malfoy had become nothing more than a distant memory.
Pansy ignored Malfoy's spluttering and Ron's laughter.  Nor did she notice the speculative glance that Ron shot in her direction – Harry did though, and made a mental note to question that when there were less spectators.  Nor did he miss the sly wink that Ginny tipped at him – clearly the whole thing had been planned, but what baffled Harry was how in the name of Merlin she'd managed to convince Pansy Parkinson, of all people, to go along with it.,
Harry could see the reluctance in Draco's eyes, the idea of spending more time with people other than Pansy was clearly not something he wanted to do. But the lure of Quidditch won out. "Okay." He gave a small smile. "Sounds like fun."
Draco smiled in return and Harry couldn't help the feeling of warmth that rose in his chest at that smile.  He loved Friday nights, when all his friends came round for a beer, to chat, to just generally catch up now that their busy lives keep them apart more.  But this is the part of the evening he cherishes most.  That first hour when Draco arrives far earlier than anyone else, always bearing an offering of sorts, and rolls up his sleeves to help.  Harry tries not to read too much into it, really he does, but sometimes it's incredibly hard.
“Potter.  Dance with me.”  And rather than wait for agreement, she took hold of him firmly.  The glint in her eyes threatened pain if he refused and Harry was no fool. So he placed his hand lightly on her waist and began to lead her carefully around the floor.
"There's no need to do that, surely?"  Narcissa turned to face him, eyes wide with an innocence Draco knew had no place on her face at that moment.  "I wouldn't want you to miss all the fun on my account."
"Like you did with Hannah?"  Harry straightens up, ready to turn the tables on his friend.  "How long did it take you to ask her out?"
When Malfoy was finally upright again, he wiped at his teary eyes, and smiled wanly at Harry. "Come on then, Auror Potter, take me to bed."
"I don't see what the problem is?"  Pansy whisked back the curtain and stepped outside in the first of the chosen outfits.  "I thought you and Blaise used to be close."
"Portrait?" Malfoy looked around the room as he spoke. Harry couldn't help but notice that the 'nose-wrinkle' was back – though he would have to Obliviate the thought of how cute it was later.
Stepping closer, Harry placed his hands on Draco's waist.  His skin was warm and slightly damp, and the most wonderful thing Harry had ever felt.
"I just thought… you know…"  Ron gestured vaguely in the direction of where Malfoy and Astoria were now standing close, holding hands.
"I doubt that," Neville says, a soft smile tugging the corners of his mouth.  "Not when it was his idea to hire you in the first place."
Even Harry, despite the simmering irritation under his skin, couldn’t help a chuckle at this.  Hermione, meanwhile, looked at her boyfriend in surprise.
Harry could sense the shift in Malfoy's tone and it was plain he had been offended by the refusal.  "I'm sorry," Harry said, raking one hand through his hair in his unease.  "It's nothing personal, I promise you.  But I'm just not comfortable with doing that."
Potter was silent for a moment, and just stared at Draco as if he didn't quite believe what he'd heard.  "Wow," he said finally.  "That’s…what changed?"
Draco raised his wand with a shaking hand and levelled it on Harry. "Come to tell me you love me, have you?" he asked bitterly.
"You two spend a lot of time together," Hermione commented.  But before Harry had chance to reply, she continued.  "I certainly didn't realise you had a standing lunch date."
Fortunately, Hermione took the broad hint well, and after a quick peck to each of their cheeks, she headed off to the Floo.
Ron shook his head and then swallowed heavily.  "After I helped you out with…" Ron gestured vaguely in the direction of the Slytherin table and gave a mock-shudder as he said "Malfoy.  Is that any way to show your gratitude?"
Harry turns his head then and meets Draco's gaze full on.  The truth is pretty obvious now, but there's a part of him that just needs to hear it.  "Does this mean that you—"
Harry kept watching Malfoy as he replied.  “Yeah, he’s not quite as much of a git as he used to be.”
“Ow!”  A painful throb centered on Harry’s left foot.  His eyes widened as he stared at Pansy.  She smiled the fakest sweet smile in return.  “Um, you’re on my foot.”  Which of course she knew, but Harry felt it worth pointing out as she showed no sign of moving.
, Draco thought to himself, but all he said out loud was "Maybe.  I do have a standing invitation if needs be."
Draco shrugged as nonchalantly as he could manage given the butterflies currently inhabiting his belly.  "It's not a bad picture."
"I know, Ron.  But he's not so bad."  Harry winced internally even as he said the words and braced himself for the ensuing explosion.  Newly-crowned war hero or not, Neville had already slid several feet down the bench to avoid being caught in the blast.
Harry heard a huff, followed by indecipherable muttering.  But just as sleep claimed him, he felt the definite shifting of the mattress and the weight of a head on the pillow next to him.
Draco turned round quickly enough to catch the flash of anger in Harry Potter's eyes, but before he had chance to even think, Harry was gone.  Only the echoing slam of the door remained.
"Don't I always?"  Harry couldn't help ask wryly. Then hurried to his feet when Malfoy seemed to sway on his.  "Come on, I'll walk you down."
The fact that Malfoy was looking almost everywhere but at his face only served to irritate Harry further.  "Look" he said, voice low but hard.  "Either you come with me now, or I can follow you over to the Slytherin table and we'll have the discussion there.  You chose?"
The door opened then and Malfoy strode into the kitchen. He'd been busy all morning and had firmly refused all offers of assistance or company from Harry – not that this was the cause of Harry's bad mood at all. He nodded in Harry's direction before heading across the room out of view. Now bored of the day's news, Harry closed the paper and sat back in his seat – his mind now focussed on the search for a suitable conversation starter.
been discussed, so Narcissa need never know.  At least, she wouldn't if the breath-freshening charm that Draco had employed earlier did its job.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry replied stiltedly, clearly wishing the conversation were over.
Narcissa nodded; she was too busy rifling through her purchases to pay much heed.  "Yes, your Aunt Andromeda took me.  It was wonderful – all lit up with pretty lights."  She stilled then and turned to her son.  "Don't tell your father I said that, though.  You know how he gets."
Just the thought of Ron's expression when he discovered that not only was Harry backing out on their childhood plan, but that he'd told Malfoy of all people about it first.  Harry wasn't sure which he dreaded most – the initial expression of gut-wrenching betrayal, or the fiery explosion that would follow.  Neither were particularly appealing a prospect, and with Ron already annoyed with the world in general, it was bound to heighten his reaction.
As she watched her best friend make his way purposefully across the Ministry canteen, Pansy let her head rest lightly on Blaise’s shoulder.  “Well, that went well, don’t you think?”
He felt a cool hand press against his forehead, pushing damp hair back from his face, as he struggled to open his eyes.
"Yup.  It's soft and squishy, and I bet you can't guess what it is."  Ron's smirk was full blown now.
Malfoy gave a quick shake of his head. "Not me." Then he gestured at the worktop where a big shiny coffee machine now stood in the spot that Harry's kettle had once occupied. "Bertha did."
The door clanged shut and Ron turned to leave, but not before muttering, "Or at least he can if you don't piss Malfoy off again."
Draco saw the moment her gaze fell on him, how her words dried up and her eyes narrowed slightly.  It was swiftly followed by a dull red flush that crept its way up her neck as she stared unashamedly at Draco's fingers wrapped around Potter's bare wrist.
But the room, when he entered it, bore little resemblance to the room he'd seen less than twenty-four hours before. The back wall, where the kitchen units had once stood, was no more. And in its place, a wooden conservatory-like structure stretched out into the garden beyond. A quick look upwards showed a pitched glass roof that promised wonderful views of the night-time sky beyond.
Draco carefully avoided eye contact - they were both more than aware that he was the guilty party, as always.  Saturday nights, without fail, would see Draco return home completely sozzled, before making random, drunken Floo calls to his friends - some of whom were more receptive to Draco than others.
Harry swallows down the moan that Malfoy lets out in response.  He has his hand under Malfoy's sweatshirt now, blunt nails scraping against the soft skin of his back.  Malfoy pulls away for a moment and a strangled, "Fuck!" escapes his swollen lips, before he turns his attention to Harry's neck.  He licks a warm stripe over the skin before following up with open-mouthed kisses.
"But why?"  Harry couldn't ever imagine the Weasleys turning on him, and this was surely the same thing.  When there was no reply, he turned to Malfoy and found him draining the last of his drink.
.  It was especially unfair considering Slughorn was his own Head of House – but in his more honest moments, Draco was prepared to admit that it was probably just desserts for all the years the other houses had suffered under Snape.
The smirk that followed caused a flush to creep up Harry's neck. Hermione took pity on him, despite her giggle at Malfoy's words. She took hold of his arm. "Come on, I've got Neville and Ginny coming around later for a takeaway. It'll be nice for us all to catch up."
It was all too much.  Draco's head tipped forward, face now buried in the crook of Harry's neck, his breaths came in short, shallow pants.  He gave a few final strokes, each more forceful than the last, and with a muffled shout felt his own release overwhelm him.
"Yes." Harry paused and did his best to ignore the smile Malfoy wasn't trying to hide. "No. Just stop avoiding the question."
The smile appeared to freeze on Malfoy's face.  "She's over there somewhere," he said, and gave a negligent wave of his hand in the direction of the dance floor.  "Last time I saw her she was discussing wedding dress styles with Daphne, so I made a hasty exit."
Draco nodded his head in agreement. "That I can well believe. But in the interests of keeping the conversation light, tell me, do you still keep up with Quidditch?"
Draco had many years experience in knowing how to smell a rat, and the stench now was overwhelming, but for the moment he decided to play along – at least until he had figured out just what his mother was up to.
Malfoy smiled.  “Mrs Longbottom was most insistent that I not let Neville choose the wedding robes.”
True to Malfoy's wishes, he had spent most of the last three days out of the house snapping pictures of anything and everything he could. The beauty of Apparition meant that he had pictures from locations all over the British Isles. He'd even paid a surprise visit to Hogwarts, much to the surprise of Hagrid, who'd been only too happy to pose as required. Professor McGonagall had not been so receptive, but Harry still had high hopes for the pictures when he eventually managed to get them developed.
Pansy curled up on the sofa next to him and laid her head on his shoulder.  "No.  He left earlier – big day ahead."
Pansy gave Draco a look that told him the discussion was not over by a long shot, but she allowed the change of conversation nonetheless.  "I'd have thought you'd be a bit busy with your new beau to have time matchmaking for me."
them," Draco replied, a smile curving his lips now.  "I don't think I've ever seen her lost for words before."
liked Draco, not really. He sips his drink to buy a moment. "There's nothing to be said," he replies finally, voice as steady as his emotions will allow.
Malfoy laughed. "Potter, you look like a man going to the gallows. You don't have to prove anything to me."
be big news.  True, they weren't quite the arch-nemesis's they once were, but still...  Was it too much to expect the odd expression of shock or outrage?
Draco grinned and shook his head.  "We've already talked about this; he likes it down here.  You just have to learn to ignore him."
"It's not." Harry shakes his head emphatically. Yes, the sight of Draco with Astoria had twisted his insides in a way he never wants to experience again. But that's not what this is about. "I just want to dance with you. Is that so strange?"
"Don't get excited, it's just glasses and stuff for the party."  Then, seeing her puzzled expression, he explained, "I stopped by the Leaky earlier.  Hannah asked me to drop them off."
“Something like this.”  Blaise grinned broadly, before grabbing the edge of the table, throwing his head back and moaning (a little too loudly), “
"It's part of a promotion George has planned for the shop on Christmas Eve.  I think the idea is that if you find one of these in the shop, you get some sort of prize."  Harry shrugged.  "He did explain, but I wasn't really paying attention."
"Then neither of them should be surprised in the slightest," Pansy cut in.  "Considering you've already made your preference for blowing things explicitly clear to both of them, I'm not sure what the problem is."
"No, Ron, he hasn't.  And swallow before speaking, will you?"  Hermione rolls her eyes and returns her focus to Harry.  "Neville tells me he's back at work full time now."
It occurred to Harry that he wouldn't mind doing this again, and he made a mental note to suggest that Blaise brought Malfoy along with him on their next night out.  After all, if he'd managed to become good friends with one ex-Slytherin, why should it be such a surprise that he might possibly do it with another?
"Shh," Harry said, his eyes drifting closed again.  "Sleep."  And to further indicate what he meant, he patted his hand on the mattress at his side.
"It's not so much what she's saying," Draco said as he opened the box in front of him with a flick of his wand. "It's the way she
Harry couldn’t help but smile, despite his own concerns.  "Go on," he said, giving Ron a slight nudge.
"Believe me, I know how that goes," Malfoy said, as he leant forward, hands clasped in front of him on the desk.  "There's no one more skilled in the art of
By the time the cup was empty, Harry realised that he hadn't long left.  He didn't really think that Draco
"Properties I went to look at earlier," Draco explained, as he poked warily at his sandwich.  "I haven't had time to get the details made up yet, but I wanted you to have a look at them first.  See if anything grabs your fancy."  Draco dragged his attention away from his food and finished up with a smile at Harry.  "You have your own Pensieve, don't you?"
Normally Harry dreaded shopping at Christmas more than any other time, simply because he could never think what to get Draco.  His flatmate had just about everything he could possibly want, and enough money to buy the rest.  For someone with Harry's limited present-buying skills, this usually presented something of a problem.  This year Harry was feeling slightly smug, however.  Draco's present was already bought, wrapped, and hidden away at Hermione's house where Draco's
Only apparently it was just Harry who felt the awkwardness of the moment, because while he held his breath from the tension, she just smiled brightly, issued a cheerful "Morning, Potter" and disappeared into the office beyond.
Hermione looked up, the corners of her lips tilted in the smallest of smiles.  "Don't worry, Ginny lured Ron off with the promise of Quidditch practice."  She paused here and eyed Harry speculatively.  "She seemed most concerned that he didn't bother you."
Harry huffed, but didn't comment on it further.  "I just don't think it's right for me," he said finally.  "I'm sorry."
of a bad idea this conversation was, but he was already on the slippery path, and Draco had every intention of seeing it through to the end.
