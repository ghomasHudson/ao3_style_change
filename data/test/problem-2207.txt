He wasn't. Not anymore. The insult washed over him and barely touched him.
"No, I fucking don't," Harry replied, voice rising and hitching. "So explain it to me."
"Real?"
It was strange, but somehow, in a short time, Harry had become the bridge between his friends' floundering. He wasn't sure if he particularly enjoyed his newfound duty. It was far easier to let them flail and either sink or swim. Besides, he had other places he could be. Other places he wanted to be.
"Can't believe you can just say shit like that," Harry muttered, turning away as he felt heat flood his cheeks. "It's so sappy."
The line between Draco's eyebrows seemed to have become all but permanently settled. His jaw had been locked for so many hours that evening that it was probably aching. Disregarding that he might be seen, what Su Li at the table behind them might think if she happened to glance up, Harry reached for Draco's face and prodded his chin. As thought released like a clasp, Draco's lips parted around a sigh.
"Of your acoustics? Can you hear yourself?"
Jill glanced between them both, frowning slightly through her smile. "Right," she said slowly.
Harry gestured over his shoulder. "We're going to head out for lunch. Did you want to come?"
Harry didn't know how long he'd been sitting on the floor, arms locked and gaze vague, before the sounds of slumber were interrupted. Not fiercely, and barely noticeably, but in the quietude that thrummed like a sound of its own, the slight scuffle of feet was as loud as stomping steps.

"Draco, that's a bloody castle right there."
"About me? And my family?"
"Oh, fuck off. It's not that bad."
"You mean you…? God help us all."
"You've got to be kidding me," Harry said, rolling his eyes as she dragged him to the opposite end of the hall. "You're completely ignoring everything that Ron and Hermione just said."
Like a reflex, Harry flinched backwards. He was three buildings from
"Yeah," Harry said heavily. "I think I do."
Watching. Just watching. Not with lust or open desire, nor flooded with questions or demands. Not even with the clinical air of a professional eyeing their subject as Harry had seen him regard the models over the previous few days. This was different. This was softer, somehow, almost gentle. Before he'd worked with him on his own shoot, Harry doubted he would have thought it possible for Draco Malfoy to appear so human. Now, he couldn't imagine an expression more suited to him
Sparing a glance down at the stack of Polaroids in his hands, Draco flicked through them briefly before pausing upon one in particular. Costa Rica had been an experience, and beautiful at that, but the part that stood out to Draco the most was the way Harry had thrown a glance over his shoulder, grinning so widely he seemed to shine like his own personal sun. That picture, the spray of the waterfall out of view but his hair bedraggled, clothes sodden, and caught in pure joy, was one of Draco's favourite pictures.
And then beyond once more.
"Or Hufflepuff," Hannah said, so quietly it was almost a whisper.
No, what really unsettled him, what really knocked him from his stable footing, was…
felt too much like tempting fate into proving him wrong.
"Here," he said, shaking it slightly. "Eat it."
Did Harry want that? He wasn't sure. He didn't really care at that moment either, because Ginny was presenting herself as the steadfast friend that she'd always been, a pillar of sincerity offering herself to Harry as a supportive crutch.
"- after what happened in school between them, I would have thought that at least would have pissed him off a little. I mean, it's Malfoy. The fact that he exists at all is objectionable, let alone that he was a photographer at your bloody shoot."
Draco's stream of mental curses screeched to a halt. It was all he could do to keep his blank mask firmly affixed to his face. To look at Pansy would have shattered it, so he stared at Picard instead. Stared without seeing, because –
Draco blinked. His mouth opened then closed. He seemed at a momentary loss for words, which Harry silently congratulated himself for. Even better that his muteness didn't seem to be driven by disgruntlement but rather confusion. That was a very good thing. Harry had never been particularly good at keeping his thoughts to himself; blurting them out at inopportune moments had gotten him into a fix more than once. It was a good thing that Draco at least knew how he felt about him.
It took a moment, but Draco's eyes eventually flicked up to him. His usual expression – or at least the usual for the past few months that was so vastly different to the sneering, the lip-curling, the scowling – was as firmly affixed as ever. He blinked in blank reply.
"You don't fight anymore, do you?"
Harry shrugged. "I'm going to run to school."
Ginny nodded slowly, then with more commitment. "Yeah. Yeah, you'd better." Then she leaned forwards and, before Harry could even think to step away from her, wrapped him in a tight embrace that all but crushed his spine into his stomach. Harry was rendered breathless, and not only because his lungs felt pinched to two sizes smaller than they should be.
Had Harry not already been smiling, he wouldn't have been able to stop himself from doing so. As it was, he felt his smile unfold into a grin. There was something so profoundly wonderful about the meaning behind Draco's words.
"James, really," Lily said, but the faintness of her voice bellied her own supposed composure. Harry's glance in her direction found her straightened in her chair, hands flopped to the table, and staring at Harry in a mixture of surprise, wonder, and concern. "I'm sure he's a lovely boy if Harry has decided to date him."
His friends were staring at him. Staring, silent and all but unresponsive, as he approached them once more. Ron looked little constipated again, Hermione was regarding Harry thoughtfully, and Ginny was darting her gaze between Harry and Draco so quickly she must have been giving herself a headache. It was she who spoke first.
They didn't speak much beyond that. Harry couldn't bring himself to study, couldn't find the urge to even with his newfound decision of that year to properly commit himself. Hermione scratched away at her parchment and Ron muttered under his breath as he read – or pretended to read – from his textbook, but Harry remained as he had been. Slumped forwards on top of the desk, cheek pressed into his forearms, he stared vaguely out across the room and thought.
It wasn't direct permission, but it was enough for Harry. Turning, he picked up his pace and fall into step at Draco's side, squeezing his hand as much in agreement as to assure himself that he was still holding it as they dove into the semi-darkness.
Draco could almost feel Pansy smirking at his side. He pointedly ignored her, just as he ignored the urge to swing a kick at her ankle. "What do you project is the likely duration of this endeavour?" he asked instead.
"He's
Hands bunching even more tightly, Jackie's jaw worked for a moment before she managed to speak again. "So, you can do magic," she said.
Ron had shaken his head, frowning with a tinge of horror colouring the edges of it. "Weird."
"I wasn't insinuating that –"
"Which I've told you is a pity for the modelling world. You should join me sometime."
He said it like a question, but the explosive response made it a direct confirmation. Sirius burst from James' hold, though it was just as likely that James released him as he straightened, eyes nearly as wide and round as his glasses. Sirius lurched to his feet, eyes just as wide. PJ sprang about a foot in the air as both Sirius and James both all but flung themselves around the table towards Harry.
Harry shook his head. "No, I distinctly remember the instigation coming from you."
Draco had put away whatever he'd been writing. In the quietude, the otherwise emptiness of the Dragon's Nest common room, the only disturbance was the crackle and splutter of the fire as it chewed through the burnt husk of a log. Malfoy –
and have a chat to Stuart."
Harry swallowed again.
"Because the untouched original will always be better."
It was largely empty. Chairs were spaced throughout, a few tables pushed to the walls, and the whiteboard that Jackie had abducted at one point weeks before – not to brainstorm ideas but to teach Pansy a warped version of Hangman – stood before the low stage. In the far corner, the Slytherins was sprawled with the kind of elegance that shouldn't be possible for teenagers, but Harry was coming to learn was typical of his friends and boyfriend. Somehow, even the way that Greg sat reversed on his chair with arms slung over the back, looked less lazy and more like postured positioning.

"Well, I guess in fifth year, when Hermione, Ron, and I started up a club of sorts – yeah, that was probably the first time I really got a chance to meet most of the people outside of my dormitory."
"You were no help at all," Harry muttered in reply. "Useless boyfriend."
It was one wave after another; incomprehension and misunderstanding, confusion and ridiculousness, that struck Harry with such overwhelming force that he hadn't the time to recover before the next bout struck. Jacob. The fence. Draco appearing, and then - what, magic? And now this?
"Really?" he asked, volume rising with more enthusiasm than Harry's words should have incited.
"Not for me. I don't think mercy or joining his ranks would have been a viable option. I'm fairly sure that Riddle wanted me dead no matter what."
"It's not necessary for you to know," James interrupted, voice raised.
"Is that going to be a problem?" he asked calmly, quietly. Then, "Harry?"
Another wave of her wand, and a tray appeared, clattering onto the floor before him and spilling the contents of a mug of water, dampening the chunk of bread that sat alongside it.
Not that Harry minded. It made for a bit of a shaky start when he ran to his bus stop in the morning, but it wasn't so bad.
"Tell me to stop if it's too much," he said, and waited long enough for Harry's nod. Then he began to move.
To think that Pansy had someone managed to scoop herself a spot for an article in its pages as Draco was rapidly becoming aware she had - it was incredible.
Harry blinked. Was Draco teasing him? Or was this more of the embarrassment he'd seen earlier? "If you didn't realise that from the moment I caught up to you in the alley, Draco, then –"
"Too true," Dimitri said, a touch of satisfaction colouring his small smile this time. Gesturing with a nod, he pointed them towards the second door before leading the way. "If you'll follow me. I take it you've an interest in the industry, then, Draco?"
Typically, Dot didn't acknowledge Von. Instead, she immediately planted herself at Harry's side and, without ceremony, handed him a sheaf of papers. "Read this by Thursday," she said. "I trust I don't need to put a pen in your hand to have you sign it."
"Mum, it's fine," Harry said. "Really, I'm sorry. I just forgot, and I was driving –"
"You're too nice to him."
He didn't. Harry had to give him that. "But you – you never said –"
He should have just left, should have just accepted that Harry and Ipetsky had too, but a part of him didn't want to. He couldn't, because that part knew where they would have retreated to and he didn't want that. Abruptly, with the force of a colliding truck, it hit Draco that he didn't want Harry to go home with Ipetsky at all.
He hadn't eaten in a while, didn't know how long but knew it was a good long while, and that was terrifying in a different way. The kind of way his stomach told him that was
"No, he does. So – I mean, even if I did fancy him, he'd never like me in return."
Maybe Harry's friends weren't so oblivious after all. Certainly not Jill.
Ironically, the club
Harry tucking his jacket around himself a little tighter, folding it across himself with one hand as the other dug in his pocket for his gloves. It was particularly cold that day, unseasonably so, and Harry left only a thumb free as he extracted his phone out and dialled a number from memory.
"What's this?" he asked, glancing up at the calligraphic text written in gold paint above the door. He started slightly as he read it properly. "Is this -?"
"Sure," Sirius said. "Study mate." It came out as more of a grunt as James gave him another squeeze.
Just that. Just a simple word, and almost as tentative as Harry's. And yet it rung on echoing repeat in Harry's ear and he clung to it fiercely.
"I'm sold."
"In privacy," Draco clarified. His eyes flickered over Harry's shoulder. "Away from listening ears."
'You haven't told them?" Lily asked. "Why not?"
"That's a matter of perspective, Jackie," Jill said.
"Yeah," Harry whispered. "I take it you're not just sleep walking?"
"Hey Bambi, come take a look at what Sirius brought home from the station. It's hilarious; you should see PJ with it."
Draco raised his gaze from his cup slowly. The heaviness in his eyes had grown without Harry's notice, and whether from drunkenness or pain he wasn't sure.
"What, because you're so bad at them?"
Harry's eyes flicked from Draco's quill to his face. It hadn't shifted, hadn't risen, yet the corner of Draco's eye was visibly trained upon him. Harry felt his heartbeat give an anxious quiver, and his arms tightened over his chest just a little.
"To Hades," Clio corrected absently.
That fear didn't stop him from rising at a frankly ludicrous hour on Wednesday morning. It didn't stop him from dressing himself far too heavily for the weather, planting a hat low onto his head and slipping a pair of sunglasses on before he'd even stepped out the door. Which he didn't do. Frowning to himself for a moment, Draco contemplated with his hand on the doorknob before stepping backwards. He drew his wand instead and Apparated on the spot.
Harry's stilted laugh was little more than another sigh, edged with hysteria and not really amused. It didn't really matter. Nothing did but Draco's hold around him, that he maintained that hold and somehow manoeuvred them to the nearest chair. The easy familiarity of following Draco's unspoken suggestion, climbing into his lap and hooking his legs on either side of Draco's, was so soothing, such a constant, that the stuttering hitch of Harry's heartbeat, the short sharpness of his breaths, abruptly eased.
Taking a slow glance about the room, Draco ran his gaze over every inch of space that breathed of Madame Clementine. She had a style that he'd seen many a time in the work attached to her name, and even if she wasn't the one directly behind the camera, nor the one who crafted the garments her models wore or the one who held the brush and applied the makeup, her presence pervaded nonetheless.
"I'm not shooting immediately?" Draco had asked as he'd followed Pansy from Building Eight.
For whatever reason, it felt more comfortable than the bed, even if it was something of a tight fit for the both of them. Extended across all three of the cushions, Draco lay half on top and to the side of Harry, slightly wedged against the back. His legs tangled with Harry's own, his arms firmly and instinctively wrapped, and even if his head was at a bit of an awkward angle between the cushion and Harry's shoulder, he looked comfortable. Certainly more comfortable than he'd been before the NEWTs.
Draco had said, and the light of his want swum into his gaze. For a moment, Harry had been rendered mute, crushed beneath a wave of disappointment and helplessness. Even Draco. Even from Draco, it was all that was ever asked for. All that was ever wanted.
Glancing sidelong, Draco couldn't help but watch as Harry took half a step towards the wall of window on display across the breadth of the room. His eyes were wide behind his glasses, his eyebrows raised and his mouth slightly ajar, and in all honesty, Draco couldn't blame him for his stupefaction. Still, despite the view, he found himself almost as transfixed by Harry and his open wonder as he was what lay beyond the window itself.
"I'll have you know, you're doing remarkably well. Most people vomit the first time."
It was darker the deeper he went. Darker, briefly, and then lighter as the glow of a glass-bound lamp peeked around the aisles and through the lines of shelving. Pausing just beyond it, Harry peered into the pool of light that spilled over the table. The light that encompassed Draco in his ring of books and quills, inkwells and parchment sheets, that so often decorated the table in their study sessions. For once, Harry considered him with a new light that had nothing to do with the orange glow from the flickering candle.
"Because they're from bloody
When Draco peered at the young model through the lens of his camera, the natural light playing through her hair and captured by the lines of her dress far too cold for the season, he knew she was beautiful. It didn't mean that he was any less aware that there was a distance between them that he wouldn't cross, a distance that had absolutely nothing to do with the stretch of pebbled shoreline extending towards where the model posed on shoes too high and far too impractical for the setting. Draco had never understood how some photographers could think that appreciating beauty entailed the right to touch it.
"Draco?" Harry asked. "What's going on?"
"I call bullshit on that, too."
school, you mean." Then he tugged on Harry's hand and all but dragged him in motion towards the looming mass of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry could only follow, stumbling slightly in the wake of everything,
Had Draco Malfoy changed? Harry supposed he had, but then who of them hadn't? Pansy had, too, and Harry had mentioned just as much to Hermione, which seemed enough of a distraction for her as she'd diverged into a spiel of, "I've read a whole heap of her articles, you know, and they're actually not bad."
"A couple of weeks," he replied. "You?"
"And keep me updated as well. I don't need to know where you're going or where you've been because I don't really care. Just make sure you're safe. And avoid publicity stunts. And don't act in any way that might reflect poorly upon the agency."
"Wandless -?" Harry flicked his gaze between the rod and Draco, back and forth. "What are you talking about? Magic is – Draco, we've talked about this, so many fucking times, I don't even know how to…" He cut himself off and squeezed his eyes shut. It had turned into a bad day. A very bad, very confusing day. "I don't know what you're talking about and to be honest, at the moment, I'm kind of having a bit of a mental breakdown after being chased by the arseholes who've terrorised me for most of my life, so I'd appreciate it if you made a little bit of sense. Please."
"Alright, hold your horses," Harry said.
"Really? Because –"
"Like yourself?"
"It's against Wizarding law."
hissed shrilly in Harry's head on repeat.
Pansy snorted nearly silently, but Draco ignored her. Dimitri stared at him with curiosity, but Draco ignored him, too. He couldn't quite help but reach, nearly touching the image pinned to the wall and so ethereal that it could have been actual magic.
Harry opened his mouth, paused, and considered. He supposed… yes, Draco was right. Though it made him feel a little like a childish fool, he was indeed fascinated. And yes, it was somewhat amusing, their seeming reversal of roles. Harry found himself smiling. "We're coming full circle."
Jackie, on the other hand, was striding ahead with her head held high, elbows protruded from where her hands were shoved in her pockets, and seeming to mark her passage with every step she took. Jackie was a loud person and seemed to thrive in similar loudness.
"You didn't have to step in," he said.
Pansy's voice called him from his reverie and, with a brief moment to close his eyes, Draco set about gathering the prints. "Yes?"
"Draco?" Harry asked.
"That's a little bit sad, Draco."
Because he was. He was Draco's boyfriend, and Draco was his. Harry had decided he didn't care who in the world knew it because so long as Draco was okay with it, he'd readily shout it to the world just to revel in the truth of it. If nothing else, the past week had ground decisiveness into him.
Draco hummed neutrally. "Is that a problem?"
Jackie was like that. Objectionable was practically her middle name. She was the one who always spoke up in class, questioning the teachers, and incited hatred as much as love from those very teachers with her left-of-centre opinions. She back-chatted fools who thought to undermine her with slurs flung in the corridors, and in their younger years had made a point of ignoring the bullying that left its marks physically as much as emotionally. The one time their classmates had doused her with a tomato-sauce bottle of diluted food dye had changed her forever.
"Yeah," Ron said. "And stop comparing, Ginny. You're making me feel fat in comparison."
like to?"
Sitting alongside Draco as he crossed his ankles, eyebrow twitching a little higher, Harry sighed heavily once more. It was mostly a façade; he was a little exasperated by Draco's theatrics, but didn't mind quite so much as he pretended to. Besides, Harry had loved the attention his own brand of magical drama had gotten him once upon a time. Loved it until it had become a detriment. What struck him the most was how Draco seemed to brighten slightly when they had a disagreement, as though he delighted in defending his own opinions. As if it were a game, even.
Harry had to briefly close his eyes. He hadn't wanted Draco to find out. Not like this. Something like this, like Harry choosing to come out when and to whom, should have been his decision. His.
Crawling on hands and knees, Harry ducked under his bed for one of the storage boxes packed beneath. He flipped open the lid, emptying the contents into a heap on the floor, and extracted the bundle of silken cloth that he always stowed at the very bottom, out of sight and hopefully away from curious eyes. Harry wouldn't have put it past Sirius to rummage through his belongings in an attempt to uncover a secret porn collection or something to tease him with. At that moment, the thought was hated rather than amusing.
The pop of Apparition was louder than expected. Harry's street was a quiet one – which was one of the reasons Draco never Apparated directly onto it – and in the frozen cold of winter's emptiness it seemed even louder. Harry was grateful, then, that Draco had made an exception by arriving so closely. Even more grateful that he'd been so fast, which would explain the loudness of the crack. Turning, already moving before he'd properly caught sight of Draco, Harry broke into a run.
The explosion when he'd slipped up about his death. The calamity about the accidental revelation of Voldemort's Horcruxes. About reconsidering joining the Aurors, or hunting down any remaining Death Eaters, or joining the Ministry as the representative of the people that he already was.
With only a flicker of his eyes, Harry darted a glance towards Draco. How his stare could be so wide, so unwavering, so stupefying even sidelong, Draco didn't know, but he'd already accepted the fact that it was. He'd accepted it years ago, and likely even before anyone else had noticed.
Only to have his arm grabbed to jerk him to a stop. "Wait," Draco said. "Just
That moment had stung and was at least half of the reason Jackie made a point of hating the Physical Education department at the school. Harry had confidence in his skills as a footballer; he just didn't think he could manage if even the coach didn't want him on the team.
"Do you mean the fact that you're sitting in my lap or that the chair will be slightly more uncomfortable than it already is?" When Harry didn't reply, Draco nudged him with his knee again, more insistently this time. "Come on. You're sitting there quietly depressed, and it's making me even more stressed than I already am. Don't do this to my blood pressure, Harry."
She stalked into the room in a sweep of ragged skirts. Harry shrunk away from her, but it wasn't like he could go far. There was nowhere to retreat to. Terror like a wave crashed over him.
"So, don't do that. You have to eat, dumbass."
Draco was slightly tense beneath him, but a glance his way found him unconcerned. Sincerely unconcerned, that was, not simply hiding his discomfort behind blank-faced aloofness. It took that glimpse to notice that, by and large, Harry felt the same. Suspended in a state of exhaustion, no longer nauseous and horrified himself, not struggling for breath and fighting the urge to tear his eyes out but wrung dry nonetheless, he didn't really care. He cared even less when Ron's shrug caught his attention again.
"What about the powder that you threw at that prat, then?"
Draco either ignored or didn't hear the sarcasm in his voice. He nodded again. "Certainly. At least for the moment I'll ruminate on this experience to deduce how I feel about the situation."
"Aren't you?" Gertrude's voice was a comfortable hum. "You mean that you don't feel like a dingy that has been cut loose from a pier?"
Draco snorted again and, just as he had each other time that night, instinctively touched his nose as though the gesture had pained him. He otherwise showed no apparent discomfort. "Of course not," he said. "I've had my fair share of disaster already without inducing it myself."
"I don't know," Harry said, swallowing thickly. "Are you at home? Sirius – he made sure you –"
"Unique?"
The door clattered. As soon as it opened, the sound that had been muffled by magic shattered alongside it in an explosive introduction of his invaders.
In an instant, the two requested students appeared as though they'd teleported to the front of the crowd. A fuzzy haired girl with slightly overlarge front teeth and a ridiculously tall, gangly boy with a smattering of freckles across his nose.
"He's got a history with Christine," Harry explained.
From the voice – unfamiliar and youthful – it was likely an intern given the regrettable duty of contacting him. Draco had been made a full and independent employee of the company months ago, a position he was already considering dropping in pursuit of freelancing, but even with only months under his belt, he knew he had a reputation for one-track-mindedness. Dimitri made a running joke of it.
"No, but a name is."
"Nothing important," Hermione said, frown deepening, but Ron spoke over the top of her. "Just that you're zoning out again. You've been doing that a lot lately, but even more the past couple of days. Are you sleeping badly again?"
For Draco, it was the same. Notoriety meant casting his name out into the world so that, when the initial heat and anger died, those curious yet noteworthy few who saw and appreciated his work would approach him. Draco was good. He knew he was good, knew he was skilled at what he did, and simply needed the jobs. Pansy, too, though to a lesser degree; she was already established as a cutthroat journalist and interviewer, and though some weren't partial to such an approach, others deliberately sought it from her.
"I don't have a crush," Harry blurted out.
"Not in the least," Draco replied, scrunching his nose in an expression that, months before, Harry would have thought incapable of marring his sculpted features. He knew better now. Far better, because Draco smiled, and scowled, and sometimes, if only briefly, even laughed. Harry didn't think he'd ever seen something more beautiful; Draco wasn't necessarily pretty, and his laugh wasn't spectacular. If anything, the slight snort and deep chuckle was funny in itself, but because it came from Draco, Harry thought it was damn near incredible.
Harry snorted. "What, you'd prefer I poked shit at you?"
Stepping away from his prints, Draco peeled his gloves off with a snap. He tossed them towards the bin in the corner of the room with pin-point accuracy as he extracted out his phone. Flipping it open, he grunted his annoyance. "What do you want?"
The waiting room on the tail end of the exams was almost identical to that at the beginning. It was provide to 'preserve academic integrity', the examiners had told the attendees on the first day, as though any of them cared enough about formalities to question the logistics of the process. Or at least Harry didn't.
"Are you going to go to sleep at all?"
Draco made a noise. It was somewhere between a grunt and a squeak, a sound Harry had never heard from him before, and he might have been surprised enough to comment upon it had he not felt so utterly defeated.
Did he want to keep playing quidditch? Yes. Of course he did. There were few things he loved more in the world than flying, and the game added an extra layer of excitement and competitiveness that Harry had never experienced in a sport before. And yet, after everything, coming back to Hogwarts and resuming the position and status he'd once held… Somehow, it didn't feel right.
"Go to hell."
"If you'll all find your groups, we can make a start," Mrs. Joyce announced brightly. Or tried to announce; her voice had never been particularly loud, and with the chatter bouncing through the hall she didn't have much of a hope of succeeding that day.
At his side, Jackie speared Pansy in particular with a fierce glare for a long moment in the wake of her words. Chatter still rung through the hall, and Harry could hear Mrs. Joyce's bubbling voice from the far corner, but in their little circle it was distinctly silent.
"Just so we're clear," Harry said. Which they were. Harry didn't need to remind Draco to research what he considered 'real' magic. The history of paganism, for one, and how it affected modern magic shows, despite that modern magic was far from the witchery and enchantments of centuries before. Harry still hadn't been able to convince Draco that 'real' magic wasn't actually real, but it didn't matter so much anymore. Not when Draco looked at him like he was truly interested when Harry showed him tricks and sleight of hand.
"Well, I'm not entirely altruistic in my acceptance of your offer."
"Yeah," he murmured, and silence fell between them.
More explosions. More exclamations. More headlines printed in bold capitalisation. Ginny received Howler after Howler, accusing her of 'driving Harry away', the papers were rife with accusations that she was 'putting her love life on the line for her career' and demanding to know 'how could she do this to the Saviour Harry Potter?' It was as though his words had been spoken in misery and regret rather than tinged with the fondness that was the truth of their persisting friendship.
"They're just around the corner," Picard said, settling the phone down on its hook.
Harry didn't pause to check. He didn't stop to make sure. He hadn't stopped from the moment he'd crashed into wherever he'd landed, slammed to the ground with the force of a giant's hand pinning him down. It had been a struggle, had taken a nearly insurmountable effort, but he'd pushed himself to his feet.
What was strange was that the studio in Lucerne was no different to those that Harry had worked in countless times before. Each agency, each photographer, each office building with its towering heights and panoramic views or low-lying building with studio buried in its lower levels – they all had their own distinct style. Their own layout. Their own choice of props, and equipment, and brand of that equipment.
"What's that, hon?"
"Yes, I have noticed that about you. Have you ever thought that -?" He paused at the feeling of glasses sliding onto his nose. "Von. I can put on my own glasses."
"Is a screwdriver, no' shit."
He left even earlier than usual as a result, all but fleeing out the door of his own flat. Even so, even at such an early hour, the traffic was horrendous, and Draco cursed that he hadn't simply Apparated. To hell with all the Muggles who would 'potentially question' his lack of visible use of transport should he deny catching the bus. To hell with the
"Do you think you've taken it yet?"
Ron switched his attention from a chiding Hermione towards him. "You know we had a Transfiguration essay due this afternoon."
The owl was a bit of a mangy creature, grey feathers tufted at odd angles about its head, and Draco regarded it with distaste as it hopped and fluttered towards the table, nearly face-planting as it made the leap from the window sill. He picked up his plate and raised it out of reach of feather lice as it approached him, and, with his wand rather than his fingers, untied the letter from its ankle. As soon as it was freed, the owl turned and, in another spray of downy feathers, it was gone.
"Hogwarts?"
"So bloody nosy," Jackie muttered.
long.
, Harry?" Draco murmured, the corners of his lips quivering ever so slightly. "Amidst all these Muggles? How daring of you."
Harry snorted, but he couldn't help but cling to the thought. They really hadn't been together for that long; a couple of months which paradoxically felt like both longer and shorter than that time. Harry found he couldn't imagine
"Don't worry about it," Harry said. "I'm sure he's not that bad. Your teacher said you were a prefect or something, right?"
Pansy blinked. Blaise eyed her sidelong. Harry only spared Blaise himself a momentary glance, focusing upon Pansy. If she knew about Draco's feelings then Blaise most likely did too, but she was the only one Harry was certain knew of his and Draco's arrangement. Their arrangement that hadn't felt quite so strange for a long time but abruptly seemed more than a little absurd – and a little obvious – when Harry viewed it through either hers or Draco's lens.
"Now, don't get the wrong impression," Jackie said, pausing in nibbling her apple core. "Harry's not a spoilt rich kid who gets every new gadget on the market."
It begged the answer of yet more questions, and Harry had to ask.
The instinct to deny the need for such an offer welled immediately, because of course Harry would do what he was told. He was a model, and Draco was his photographer. What kind of model would he be if he didn't do what was directed of him?
"I won't take pictures of him to use against him outside of the studio," Draco said. "It's not right."
"Oh, well spotted," Harry said, hanging a left in the direction Jill pointed him. "I hardly even saw the sign."
What afflicted the senior students bore a remarkable resemblance to the adjustment of unnerved and yet blessedly relieved survivors of war. A resemblance, but without the added weight of grief. Seamus' laughter rung through the Dragon's Nest whenever he was in the common room like a sporadic yet frequent tune. Susan had established a morning tea gathering of sorts in the Great Hall for anyone who chose to join. Neville had taken to wearing dirt-smeared slacks and boots, carrying a pair of gardening gloves wherever he went, as he dove into Professor Sprouts Herbology labs to tinker with the greenery within as a near-constant pastime.
Draco loved it. He never would have thought it possible to become partial to something so completely Muggle in nature but he loved it. Chemicals and chemistry wasn't potions, but it was close enough and unexpectedly nostalgic. Never was Draco more content than when he worked in the dark room that felt more and more like his, despite being in a building hosting experts in the field.
"Definitely."
"What do you dream about? Your worst dreams?"
, started up the industrial steps with sluggish efficiency.
Draco couldn't look at her. It wasn't really a secret – or it was, but one they shared. Draco couldn't hide that, since the moment he'd first stepped into Dimitri Nilsson's office, from the second he'd seen Potter's picture and even before he'd realised who he was, he'd wanted to photograph him. That almost-perfect shot was the closest to absolute perfection that Draco had ever seen.
Following in their wake, Harry dropped his books onto the desk and glanced briefly around the room. It was already half-full, and Slughorn sat on his usual perch at the front desk, leaning back in his chair with hands clasped across his belly and fingers tapping one another. When Harry met his gaze, he smiled placidly and tipped his head towards him in a slight bow as he did every time they saw one another.
"Music? Really? What do you play?"
Pansy fell silent. She lowered her gaze to where she still tapped the back of Draco's hand, the pressure of her finger barely felt as it made little divots in his skin. She opened and closed her mouth twice before speaking. "People won't forget."
Harry managed a chuckle. "Fair enough. Don't tell anyone else though. It really is supposed to be a secret."
"Remus is going with him," Jill said. "He'll rein him in."
Draco took another step towards him until he was only just out of PJ's lunging distance. "Yes. About magic."
"Okay then, what about that girl you kissed last Easter? I only found out about it because your mum blabbed. Being embarrassed doesn't mean you shouldn't have told me too."
His flat wasn't even brightening with the glow of daylight yet. The white walls, box-like and just a little too tight for his liking, were dampened to grey. Pansy had told him once that his objection to what he deemed the small size of his living quarters had more to do with the fact that he was accustomed to manor living standards, and that he should suck it up and get used to it.
"And triple the cost for insinuating that my son's tarting around."
He didn't. Shouldn't. Never had. Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter didn't care for one another. Or they weren't supposed to. That was always the way, had always been and always would be. Draco would announce it to the papers himself if he thought it would do any good in solidifying the fact. It might even manage to diffuse some of the rearing hatred being heaped upon him.
"Go figure," Jackie muttered before leaning into Pansy's side to relay that very message.
Harry nodded slowly, ignoring Pansy's sighing "shut the fuck up, Zabini, honestly". "You two spent the Christmas break with him, then?"
The words filtered into Harry's dozing mind, weaving into the vague dream shrouding him. A part of him knew that they weren't really of his own making, that the words themselves came from somewhere else, but he was simply so relaxed. Warm, comfortable, and nothing if not disinclined to climb out of his languid stasis.
"Yeah, I would."
Glancing over his shoulder once more, Draco turned towards Harry. He was seated much as he had been in the alcove, his knees drawn up before him and propped against the table. Except that instead of his phone in his hands, he'd picked up Draco's favourite camera from the table.
Harry grinned. "Welcome to the world of McDonalds, Draco."
Harry listened as she continued – he did, truly – but a glance back towards Draco had him more than a little distracted. It wasn't as though it had been more than a day since he'd seen him, or that there was anything particular exceptional about him that day. Except for the fact that he was there. In company. And Harry really, really wanted to kiss him, or hold his hand or – or anything. But he couldn't. He just… couldn't.
"When did you become such an animal?"
It wasn't because Harry had the seemingly naïve ability to draw the eye of everyone in the room either, though he did that, too. Whether for how he stood, or smiled, or simply because of who he was to so many of the Wizarding world, he captured attention like a spotlight was trained upon him.
"No shit."
He wouldn't do that to them. Not now, when they were both so fumbling and awkwardly struggling to cleave together without tripping over their own feet.
Only for him to grind to a halt as a familiar figure stepped out before him. Harry rolled his eyes with a sigh. "Bloody hell, Draco, are you going to start making a habit of this?"
Harry allowed himself a small smile. "I used to practice a lot, you know. I'm pretty sure I've got it covered."
"It's nice to meet you," Jill said, stepping towards the two Hogwarts students before Jackie could retort further – which she would. Jackie always had something to say. Harry turned back towards them a moment later to find Ron smirking and Hermione's eyebrows risen, a slight smile playing across her lips.
"Oi," James said, swatting at him. "Don't eat the crunchy ones. They're the best ones!"
"Seven? Bloody oath." Blaise shook his head slowly. "Can I come and watch?"
"Well, I wouldn't say decided. That's a bit of a final word."
"Wait, so Hogwarts is a magic school? The only one in Britain? And it's all the way up in Scotland?"
Draco nodded again. "Certainly. You're full of surprises, Harry. It's nothing short of fascinating."
A strangled whimper made its way through the roaring in his ears, and Harry knew detachedly that it came from himself. He didn't care. He didn't care that it was pathetic, that it may seem weak, that those around him would have likely been more than a little stunned to hear it. Just as he didn't care that he was very likely being watched as he crashed into Draco and clung to him, arms locking around him crushingly tight and face seeking the solace of his shoulder. Eyes closing, struggling for breath, Harry held Draco like it was the only thing keeping him upright. It probably was.
"You can complain and send written letters of such complaints as much as you want, Pansy," Draco said, rolling his eyes as he draped his arms around Harry's shoulders. It had become his customary position and Harry was more than satisfied with the fact. "It's not going to get you a gourmet lunch."
Ginny, in the throes of professing how much she liked the "quaint little café" and it's "kitschy décor", twisted in her seat towards the waiter. "That'll be me," she said, plucking it from his hands. "And the bread and soup – here, Hermione. Sorry, sir, did you have any butter for the bread – oh, sorry, I didn't even see it there. Oops."
His warm chest rose and fell, pushing against Harry's own.
Ron nodded. "Talk to us, okay? If you're bothered about something –"
Harry almost laughed. Eyeing Draco, he raised his eyebrows pointedly. Draco might have been wearing nothing but a smoothly composed mask earlier, but it wasn't enough to hide the shadows under his eyes. "About as well as you are, I'm guessing."
And maybe he was regretting not getting a wand of his own when he'd had the chance. Maybe just a little bit.
London hadn't changed. Not really. And yet, as Harry trekked the distance through the streets, it felt different. He wasn't oblivious enough to overlook the reason for that; he knew he'd changed since he'd last set foot in the city, for better or worse. It no longer seemed quite so big as it once had. Not quite so overwhelmingly important, either.
Turning from the elevator, he took himself instead to the narrow doorway leading to the fire escape and, closing the door behind him with a hollow
. Harry's throat tightened.
Harry grinned. He cast a hand up himself in a sweeping gesture. "I'm all yours," he said, realising only belatedly just how that would sound. At Draco's smirk, he felt his cheeks flush. "Shut up."
, Harry thought.
"Definitely failed."
"Jackie did, but yeah."
Draco was pleased for that fact because he'd chosen the coat, and because it did look good on him. The colour, the cut, that somehow he managed to make the hood actually fashionable when he bothered to pull it up – all of it. What he didn't like, however, was that Harry had just accepted it. He'd just taken the suggestion as though it was an order and followed it.
When Draco stumbled to a halt, he was breathing heavily. There was a desperate cast to his expression, an edge that Harry had never seen before. It wasn't angry. It wasn't quite terrified, either, or at least not the kind of terror that Harry had seen before – in Draco, in his friends, or in every other person who'd been at the Battle of Hogwarts. This was something else, something more complicated, and Harry didn't know what to do. He didn't know what to say.
He started towards Draco, heavy boots strangely silent on the cement.
"The world, then," Hermione said. "We're a part of your story, so why shouldn't we make a show?"
"Hey, Harry," Ginny called from the kitchen. "Are you eating this beef-salad thing?"
If only things were that simple. If only
Harry shook his head as he led the way from the library. His friends… 'Jack and Jill', his father had once quipped, grinning proudly at his own cleverness, but he couldn't be further from the truth. Far be it from being similar, or perhaps even romantically inclined, as the traditional rhyme suggested, Jackie and Jillian were opposites. Black and white, or 'good and evil' as Jackie claimed, they couldn't be more different.
at the moment.
"Yeah, well, I think the Dursley's might be a little bit less than 'okay with it'," Harry said.
No. Surely not. Not like that. But he'd said he did. They might tease and taunt one another, but there had never been a prank like this before. Not when they were younger and certainly not now. And Pansy… what Pansy had said… Harry found himself glancing towards the point she'd vacated. It kind of fit. He'd just –
"I think that would just make it messy."
Ron groaned. He raised a hand to his brow as though it pained him, shaking his head, before turning his melancholic attention back to his appropriated dinner.
"Every so often? I've seen you every week."
"Trying to –"
"I'll be keeping you guys company for the next few weeks twenty-four seven anyway, just in case," Sirius had added, because of course he would.
All but whimpering to himself, Harry raised his head from his knees. His fingers fought to remain clamped shut, but with an effort he pried them apart to peer at the tall woman's portrait. He blinked at the sight of not one face but all five of the painted women crammed into the frame. "I said no," Harry repeated.
The problem was so multifaceted that the one element that wasn't problematic at all was almost laughable in being brought up. Harry shook his head, though it was a little stilted. He felt a flush of heat rise into his cheeks; it was strange, because usually Ron was the one to become easily flustered. How he stayed so serious and composed, so sincere, was a mystery. Had Ron always been like that, or was that something new? Something discovered, as Harry had made so many discoveries in the past year.
"Ew, Ron, that's disgusting," Hermione said as, with a violent, underhanded jab from Ginny, most of his mouthful spurted onto the couch. "Close your mouth when you're eating."
In an instant, the moment shattered. As one, the entire table and Jacob's group swung towards the intruding voice.
Draco stood in casual wait, looking like a bloody Levi model in his jeans and thick jacket. Harry swallowed. It still rocked him that Draco -
"Mm."
Draco shifted beneath him. Harry suspected he reached for his nightstand, then was sure of it when the faint glow of a
"You fucking scum," he growled, spittle spraying. "You think you're so high and mighty now that you've got this job? Just you wait; whatever protection you think you have – it'll be gone the second your assumed reign ends."
"Costumes, then? Curtains, candles, a blood-red table cloth and –"
Harry shrugged, his own eyes lowered this time to stare at where his fingers fiddled. "I've seen it before. A lot. Most models do, you know, even if it's not entirely warranted. I think the idea of a model is as appealing as the actual product itself."
Hermione sighed again. Then she shook her head firmly and visibly shrugged the thought aside. "Anyway. So. The tension was so thick you could carve it, and then Ginny comes charging in waving that fangled new phone around and shoving pictures in my face."
Any further teasing was lost in effect when Harry raised a hand to Draco's face and drew a feather-light finger across his cheek, up to his brow to flick aside his fringe with a gentle swipe. Draco leant into the touch, couldn't help but close his eyes against briefly simply to revel in the feeling of it. When Harry grazed his fingers along the side of his head, Draco turned his face into his palm and brushed his lips across the soft, warm skin that was offered to him. Given. That touched because Harry wanted to touch.
Harry rolled his eyes. "There's nothing wrong with my ideas."
Teeth sinking into his lip, Harry held his tongue. It wasn't that he hated himself necessarily, and he'd stood tall and proud for years, defiant in the face of name-calling and outright aggression. It was horrible, somehow humiliating, to realise that, when faced with acting upon what he stood for, Harry crumbled. Self-hatred might be a bit of a strong term, but it felt a little bit like it sometimes.
He glanced towards Harry. Harry stared back. Draco blinked. "What? I'm not heartless, you know."
"He's never forgiven you for that," Harry said, kicking his feet out before him.
"It's not a lie, and stop joking about that. I'm serious."
"Can we help?" Harry asked.
Harry smothered a snort. It didn't entirely erase his momentary flush of embarrassment, but it helped to instil a little sensibility in him. Shaking his head, he glanced briefly towards Draco. "I've got to take off. See you next week."
Harry frowned. "Aren't I? Am I not allowed to?"
Harry shrugged, watching as the tour guide caught the dove and began an spiel of the nature and apparent uniqueness of his particular feathery companion. "Yeah, well, maybe you've changed my mind a bit. It's still real to me, but not, you know…"
Ipetsky didn't turn towards him immediately. When he did, with a slow, deliberate motion, Draco saw the moment recognition settled. He saw the instant Ipetsky's disregard of him as a side-lined audience member morphed into consideration and then repulsion as so often happened. Draco had never met the man before and hadn't really wanted to for reasons aside from his social ostracism, but the reaction wasn't surprising.
Ron nodded. Harry caught the gesture only from his periphery. "That's… I guess not good, but not so bad either, at least from my perspective. But then – when you like someone?"
Harry grinned, turning back to the street. "Bloody brilliant. Can you show me?"
"Are we allowed to work in groups of three?" Ron asked.
"What the fuck?"
The sidelong glance she shot Harry said the words she didn't speak, and Harry found himself wincing in combined embarrassment and amusement. He supposed he was obvious too, especially given that he could feel himself flaring as brightly as a red traffic light. Maybe admitting the truth Jill wouldn't be much of a revelation.
Draco didn't need him to explain what he was talking about. Not when, after the first day, he'd 'left' him something each time they parted. It was almost strange how quickly and easily they slipped into habits that felt like traditions.
Flinching slightly, shaking himself from his thoughts, Draco snapped his gaze towards the voice above him. Appearing seemingly out of nowhere, an older man with a younger woman at his side stood across the table from him. They looked nothing alike but seemed like two peas in a pod for the way they both stared down their noses, eyes narrowed, and lips drawn downwards in disgust.
It was a sign of Lily's understanding and gentle consideration that she didn't pull him up on his muttered resentment. If anything, her frown and the audible kick under the table was reserved for James.
It wasn't the first time Harry had found himself watching Malfoy from across the room. In the Great Hall, across the Dragon's Nest common room, in class – he didn't know why, but curiosity niggled at him. Malfoy was a mystery, and not only because he was different to how he'd been months before. There was the fact that he only really spoke to his fellow ex-Slytherins unless someone spoke to him first, but in those instances he always replied neutrally enough, if with as few words as possible. That he didn't seem too fond of picking fights anymore – or at all, as it were, which Harry was silently grateful for. He didn't know if he'd be up to maintaining that level of animosity either.
"I dunno," Harry muttered, tweaking the corner of the page. "I just wanted to check."
"What a way to start." Granger shook her head, turning back to Harry as they began to climb the shallow steps to the second floor. "Sorry about that. I hope you don't think we're all crass."
Jackie grumbled under her breath as she headed for the bathroom. As soon as the door swung shut, he slipped down the corridor on silent feet towards the Hogwarts students.
"Except in sixth year."
"A prophecy, Dad? What the fuck?"
His shoulders shook with laughter as she sang along to Aerosmith's powerful climax, gesticulating wildly and nearly whacking him over the head as she did so.
Draco nodded again slowly, considering. "It's a shame, really," he murmured, resting his head back onto his hand. "Already being in Switzerland, it's a real shame that you couldn't go around and properly sightsee."
Lowering his gaze to his toes, Harry pursed his lips. "You don't have to if you don't want to. Or if it's not allowed that you teach me or whatever. Is it forbidden? Because that's fine if you have to have a proper teacher or something, especially since, you know, magic does seem like it can be sort of dangerous. But I was thinking, seeing as somewhere along the way I missed my letter to go to your school – you said you got a letter, right? When you were eleven? I was thinking that I could, even for maybe just a few things, try to –"
"That cursing is for magic spells, not imprecations?" he replied.
Shoving the pain aside, Draco turned on the spot. He pulled Harry after him in a swirl of Apparition, and Harry didn't resist the pull. In a way, Draco almost wished he had.
"But you…"
Glancing between each of his friends in turn, Harry nodded slowly. Only Ginny seemed particularly excited, but then, she was enthusiastic for just about anything these days. Harry wouldn't put it past either Ron or Hermione – though especially Ron – making a break for the exit as soon as he took his eyes off them. He couldn't even blame them; he didn't think he'd ever seen a better illustration of 'a fish out of water' than he did in Ron at that moment.
"Let's not –"
"Incentive? Really? What kind, exactly?"
A momentary lull met his words, and once more Harry's friends glanced back across the room. Seated before the fireplace, a parchment and quill in hand, Malfoy was alone within the half-circle of couches. With head bowed, wearing the blank expression that he seemed to always bear these days, and utterly isolated, he didn't look much like the prat of a rival he'd once been to Harry.
"Wartime efforts?" Jackie muttered into Harry's ear not quite loudly enough to override the guide.
"As it happens," Draco continued further, "I have something of an interest in this project you have proposed, and shall endeavour to participate in pursuing it."
Harry stared. His breath came raggedly, gasping, and all he could do was stare at the thin line of light under the door. A scuffle of feet, the click of a lock, and then… nothing.
"You fucked him!"
"You said you use owls specifically for mail delivery, don't you?" At Draco's nod, Harry shrugged. "Well, we've got those mirrors you gave me, so we wouldn't really need that. I'd probably get a dove or something."
"Huh. Well, they definitely weren't."
They'd come this far. A magical school and a magical boyfriend? It was everything Harry hadn't known he wanted, and he'd be damned if he would give it up.
"That's what you were writing?" Ron asked, eyebrows snapping upwards, even as Hermione clicked her tongue and chided him in turn.
"Clearly."
"Well, not everyone –"
He didn't look back as he sped down the corridor. A shout, a cry, a bark of inarticulate words, chased after him, but he didn't slow. Skidding around the corner on squeaky vinyl floors, the echoing "Get the bloody arsehole!" only drove him faster.
Another shiver. It didn't feel nearly so discomforting this time, and though a twist feeling still coiled Harry's gut, the thoughts
The thought that the Scottish Highlands, that Hogwarts itself, could be considered exotic was a little horrifying to Draco. He grappled with the thought, with his contrasting disbelief and pity of
Pansy stared at him unwaveringly for a long moment. Then she clicked her tongue sharply and drew her gaze sideways in a glare. "Bloody hell, Draco. You've fallen deep."
All the same, the writer had still clearly written to attack. That much was apparent. They'd simply done it a little bit smarter than Draco was used to.
"Can't," Harry said, slinging his bag onto his shoulder. "I have to walk PJ then actually study this afternoon, which you suck at, so unless you'd like to come for a run…?"
"Not really."
Lily was seated in the kitchen when Harry entered. She glanced up from the papers she'd spread across the table, a distinctly professional air that always shrouded her when she was working hanging over her, but she smiled as Harry entered.
"We were just having a difference of opinions," Billy ground out, jaw clenched.
Pansy hummed affirmation. "A number of times, and again only quite recently, so I'm still fresh in his mind. He's a casting director by trade, a photographer when he has the time."
"Please, you can't, I'll do anything, I'll –"
Draco leant towards him slightly, his eyes narrowing in something that wasn't a glare. "You did magic intentionally as a child?"
The urge to reach out a hand and touch his shoulder was almost impossible to resist. Just to be sure that Harry was there. That he was with him. That he'd decided to accompany Draco, not because Draco wanted it and had demanded it of him but because Harry wanted to be there. He
Pausing for a moment on the threshold, Harry brushed his fingers across his lips. He was smiling again, he realised. It happened quite often of late, and quite without Harry's direct consent. He found he didn't mind quite as much as he once had. He didn't even mind that the previous day Jackie had given him a disconcerted sidelong glances when she noticed, or that Jill seemed strangely knowing for someone who shouldn't know anything at all. Regardless of how much he loved them, Harry wasn't sure how to broach the subject of his dating Draco. They would be supportive, he knew, and Abel likely would be as well, but for some reason, the time just hadn't been right. Not yet.
"I think I was probably born into the wrong family," Harry said quietly, pursing his lips and lowering his gaze to the slick pavement. "Don't get me wrong, I love my mum and dad, but if I'm magical, and gay, and your world completely accepts both of those things, it seems kind of… unfair to not be a part of it."
Bambi, his parents called him. No, Harry wasn't a Bambi. Not then.
Draco, adjusting the camera he always carried on its strap around his neck, cocked his head. "Even after so many years?"
"Call me cameraman again," Draco muttered, obligingly turning to follow her, "and I swear you'll regret it."
For a moment, Harry could only stare at him. Stare and wonder. Draco Malfoy was good-looking. He had almost unnaturally blond hair and features so sharp they looked almost carved from stone. Even when his eyes were hooded and clearly condescending, Harry could just make out their dark greyness; it was kind of pretty.
He knew he was gone.
Starting, Harry glanced towards the dark corner where Ron's bed was wedged. Ron was propped up on his elbows, the oval of his face pale and visibly squinting, frowning just a little. Harry smiled, shrugging in the face of Ron's concern. "Nah. Not tonight."
"Four books, and you haven't written down a single note."
There were a number of aspects of that statement that Draco could have objected to. That Madame Clementine often sought less known photographers in what many saw as a pity party but what she claimed was an exploration of undiscovered talent. That Draco had never been 'pig-headed', even if he had admittedly held an excess of confidence back in the day that had since been undermined, and that Harry was certainly one to talk. But in spite of the arguments he could have presented, all he could think of was –
"Mm," Harry hummed, small and short.
The woman at her side stared at Draco with a scowl rapidly growing upon her face. The man alongside her glanced at her sidelong before eyeing Draco with thinly veiled contempt. In all likelihood, Draco was assuming the degree of their hatred for him – he was fairly sure that first woman was a Muggle, anyway – but he abruptly decided he'd had enough. Not today. He couldn't face it today.
"Concerning," James said a moment later.
He wanted to see his friends. He wanted to talk more to his parents, to Sirius and Remus, and to pick their brains for an explanation. Most of all, however, he wanted to be sure that Bellatrix, wherever she was, whatever she was doing, wouldn't come for him again.
"Wow. Well, you're a better man than I, bub. I wouldn't be able to even look at the pair of them straight, and definitely not if I were in your shoes."
Harry stared across the table at Draco, his cup all but forgotten in his hand. He knew he looked a fool, knew he sat in a wide-eyed stupor that could be perceived as nothing short of objectionable, but he didn't care. All that was important at that moment was the words that Draco uttered so offhandedly.
"Of course I know that," Draco said, a slightly condescending edge to his words. It was enough that Harry found himself unable to withhold a small smile that would have once been a scowl. "I'm a photographer, Harry. My work would be very pathetic indeed if I only captured what was beautiful on the surface."
Draco stared at him for a silent moment. Then he shook himself as though to clear it. "I wanted to talk to you," he said.
And Draco. He had no idea where he'd be if it wasn't for Draco.
It would be a scolding. Or a questioning. Or something of the sort, though Harry didn't know which. Rarely did he get truly reprimanded, and James and Lily weren't the kind to ground him like Jackie's parents did. Rather, they had always deemed him worthy of being responsible for his actions. Which, unfortunately, meant that he would have a bit of explaining to do should a situation arise.
"What did you turn up in the textbook?"
"I'll bring him back," she said feverishly. "I will. I'll find a way, my Lord. I'll bring you back, bring you back, you know I will. I'll find a way, I'll do it, me, your most faithful…"
"I hate that people see yours and don't see you at all."
Draco needed to go outside. He was just a little scared to do so.
Drawing his phone from his pocket as he strode into the blessed isolation of the office's back rooms, Harry pulled his phone from his pocket again and dialled a number by heart. Ron picked up on the second ring.
The possibility was too terrifying to find out.
He sat back in his chair, posture still rigid but slightly less than it had been. The hand not still holding his quill rose to his face to knead the bridge of his nose, and the crease between his brows easing slightly.
This time, Draco seemed to be shaken back from his reminiscing. When Harry lifted his gaze again, the glassiness had retreated from his eyes to he replaced by the smallest of frowns that didn't even touch his eyebrows. "You're not?"
Liberation really was addictive. Not only to Harry, either. He didn't have to look far to see what such freedom from a choking leash could enable. Only to the hand clasped in his own, in fact.
Couple that with exam fever, and Harry was left suspended in a particularly sorry mood. The feeling was rife throughout the seventh and eighth years, building increasingly in the weeks approaching the NEWTs. That night, the night before the first of the examinations, the Dragon's Nest was humming with it. Even at nearly eleven o'clock when most of them had forced themselves to seek their beds, it was as though the walls still quivered with unease.
Surprisingly, however, as the conversation progressed, Harry found himself the focus of Draco's unwavering attention. Regardless of where it drifted and if Draco actually contributed or not, Draco would rarely settle his gaze anywhere but on his own plate or Harry.
was as close to a real welcome as Dot ever came. Begrudging, almost chiding, but genuine nonetheless. Harry had never had the sort of relationship with Dot that it would be allowed, but he abruptly felt the need to hug her.
"I'll be including a sequence of behind-the-scenes footage that will be released in increments after the primary installments," he said. "So long as you've got no objections?"
Ron said something else, and Hermione replied with a touch of bright enthusiasm, but Harry barely heard them. He might not know his own thoughts or feelings, or what he was going to tell Draco on the other side of Christmas, but he felt better with a hint of direction. Steadied, like a boat in a tumultuous sea abruptly lent a beaming light from a lighthouse.
But Draco. Harry watched Draco, and he didn't hate him, and didn't resent him as he stared at him. He just watched.
Harry stared at her blankly for a moment. Then realisation dawned and suddenly it all clicked into place. "Oh! You're from the exchange school." Then he bit his tongue and winced. His dad always told him he had a penchant for being too enthusiastic upon meeting people, though he'd never hinted that it was a problem. He didn't need to; Harry knew many didn't take to such an approach.
"I know it's not unexpected." Harry pressed his fingers into his other eye, and it helped a little, but they still stung. "I mean, no one with a grain of awareness can really overlook that a good chunk of photographers and stylists sleep with their models, but…"
"In a good way, or a bad way?"
Hermione blinked, frowned, then gave an awkward shrug. "Probably eating."
"So it seems," Pansy said with a humming chuckle. Turning, she beckoned Draco with a flick of her finger. "Come along, then, cameraman. I'll treat you to lunch before we head over there."
"Please, call me Harry," Harry said, trying and failing to smoother his discomfort.
," a voice said, interrupting Draco's thoughts and staring.
This time, Draco's frown returned and stayed. "What do you mean?"
Draco's lips thinned. He did that, Harry had noticed. It always seemed to happen when he was angry, or disapproving, or not quite satisfied with how a shot had turned out. Harry had seen it a number of times when he'd caught sight of Draco studying his prints spread on the table alongside the dressing room, bowing over them with hands steepled on either side of the spread and utterly focused.
He was still a prat, Harry thought, for he often seemed to look down his nose at most of his classmates. "Gryffindors are all crass and ridiculously exuberant with barely an ounce of wit between them," he'd said of what Harry had come to know as the red and gold dormitory house. Or, "History of Magic is naturally an unutterably dull subject, but this Muggle literature is surprisingly enlightening," to which Jackie actually unearthed from her conversation with Pansy for long enough to give him a tongue-lashing.
They were at that. Harry remembered something of the kind; some excuse, an explanation, for why going to the museum and spending so much time there was a good thing. Originally, it had been solely for their C&C project, but Harry was finding that project was growing significantly less important the more time he spent with Draco.
"I know I'm not exactly model material," he said, gaze still downcast and fixed upon his absently twirling fork. "I know that. But I was – I
Jill never seemed wobbly, despite her claims. Harry doubted it, knew Jill was simply like that, but maybe it was at least partially because of the support. She'd mustered the courage to tell her mother, who had responded with seamless positivity that Harry doubted few enough parents could manage in their day and age. Harry himself was lucky that his own parents had been supportive of him when he'd come out; if anything, they'd been singularly unremarkable.
"A bodyguard?" Pansy glanced briefly towards Von. "You have two?"
"Boarding school," Harry said shortly. "Get your facts straight before you speak, Jacob, or you sound like even more of an idiot than you are."
"I pretty much lost all right to dignity when I gave it to Sammy. Again."
Draco nodded.
Draco clicked his tongue. "Liar. You said you couldn't remember doing that specifically either."
," Draco said again.
Harry stuttered to a halt at Draco's blunt interruption. Lowering his own fork, Harry dropped his gaze down towards the bowl before him. Why? Why did he do what he did? Why had be become a model when he would readily agree that it was about as far removed from any kind of route he'd felt he should have taken, from anything he'd felt competent enough to pursue?
"Oh, a siren's call, is it?" Sirius smirked, poking his tongue out. "I like it."
Giving a mental nod, Harry fell into step with his friends as, following a distant professor's instruction, the tide of students began to peel through the doorway. If nothing else, he would have a lot to think about that Christmas.
"Nutters," Harry muttered.
"And make sure you send me owls every evening," she blurted out an instant later.
"I know it wasn't."
Conspiratorial. Just like Gertrude's smile.
James' resigned chuckle was smothered, but leaning against him, Lily felt it nonetheless. "Kill Sirius, not me. He's the one who buys them for him."
Harry shifted uncomfortably. He shrugged a shoulder. "Yeah. Mum and Dad got it for me a year ago."
"But mostly myself."
The silence stretched to the brink of awkwardness before Ginny interrupted it. "Really? How come?" She turned to Harry. "Are they bad?"
When Harry slicked himself up, when he grasped Draco's arousal and pumped him twice with a fistful of lube, Draco was a lost cause. He hooked his hands up around Harry's hips instead, blood and lust and want thundering in his ears as a rising pace, and only had the headspace to as a short, "May I?" before intelligibility abandoned him.
Fuck. Jesus-bloody-fuck.
"I take it he didn't tell you?"
The sheer condescension in Draco words was beautiful, and at any other time Harry would have bathed in the snarky retort. But not then. Especially not when Leonard snorted loudly enough to echo through the now-empty corridor. "Having a little lover's chat with the fairy of Potting Point, eh, Prep Boy? Watch out, 'cause if he gets his teeth into you he might just –"
Draco frowned, lips thinning as he pressed them together. Harry was growing to recognise that expression as the "you clearly don't know what you're talking about, so don't undermine my belief system" look. Harry almost sighed at Draco's retreat into Stuffy Git. Jackie's parents were religious, but they certainly had nothing on the demanding enforcement of their beliefs as Draco appeared to. What were the odds that Draco would be so taken with magic? And clearly the supposedly 'real' magic, too, rather than the tricks and sleight of hand the Harry practiced.
Harry didn't glance over his shoulder at the noise. Not until it approached and stopped at his side. Even then, he only drew his gaze sidelong, a heavy glance weighted with weariness yet unable to sleep.
"Boytoy?"
The mattress wasn't particularly soft, not plush and flexible like his bed, but it was miles better than a wooden floor. The pillow, too. He could give or take the smell of antiseptic, the cloying aroma as thick as if a wad of sterile Vaseline was smeared under his nose, and the rhythmic noises, the muted
His chest seized, squeezing and convulsing, even as his hand released its grip on his wand. He was only distantly aware of the sound of it clattering to the ground at his side. Of greater importance was the thundering of his heartbeat in his ears, his tightened throat, the fading blurriness of vision reminiscent of seeing without his glasses but darker, darkening, juxtaposing sharp flares of too bright and too fuzzy.
"I won't be gone long, I shouldn't think."
For all that they might have to keep their magic a secret, now that Harry knew the reason for their disconcertion, it became something amusing. Thrilling. The frowns upon hearing everyday comments, and the wariness of anything even vaguely technological, made sense. That was to say nothing of showing them all the wonders of the non-magical world magic that Harry had been a part of since he could barely talk.
"It's Pansy. Of course I should. Besides, can you honestly claim you don't do the same?"
No one spoke. Not a word for a long, long moment. It abruptly made Harry terribly angry.
"I couldn't," Harry said. At Draco's slight, questioning frown, he smiled ruefully. "I don't know if I could just up and leave my duties behind. Baby steps, Draco. I couldn't leave just because I wanted to."
Lily was stone-faced and unblinking. Remus' forehead was contorted into a mess of wrinkles, his gaze switching between everyone in the room from where he sat in the corner armchair, elbows on his knees. Sirius paced lengthways across the room, a back and forth prowl at odds with the James' erratic steps, and the two of them only seemed to feed off one another.
Frown deepening, Harry pushed himself up from his seat and folded his arms instead across his chest. Malfoy might be correct in saying that, but it was still a little vexing to hear the assumption made. Even more so when Harry had decided that, for the first time in his student life, he was actually going to make an attempt to study properly.
"I said it's nothing, Pansy. Definitely not what you're thinking."
Draco paused with his hands still under the tap. "What is it?" he asked lowly.
"Which is only a single day out of that whole month."
"I didn't insinuate tarting. You're putting words in my mouth. Besides, there's nothing wrong with a little bit of fun if you're doing it safely."
"It would be funny, though, to watch him try. He'd do it if you dared him, too."
His bowed head as he read something on his phone, fringe falling into his face.
Harry ran – but he wasn't fast enough.
"Busted," Jackie said. She grinned at Pansy, frowning in confusion as she was. "Harry's mum is the ultimate helicopter parent."
"I sincerely doubt that Harry is pursuing either such endeavours," Remus said mildly, speaking through the rapid exchange that James and Sirius were continuing to volley to the exclusion of the rest of them. He met Harry's gaze with a silent query. "Unless you have a roaring social life filled with glamour and frivolousness that we don't know about, Harry."
"I'm not your gaoler, Harry. Neither am I your mother, or your caretaker. You're a grown adult who has had little enough time to properly live in your life. Don't paint me as a more heartless person than I am."
Harry's brief laugh sounded strangled. "Yeah, probably. But mostly…"
Abruptly, Pansy's composure became tinged by an edge of solemnity once more. Reaching towards him, she tapped a long nail upon the back of where Draco's hand had lowered to res on the tablet. "What are you going to do with yourself now, Draco?"
And Harry thought he was kind of hot. Maybe just a little. If he wasn't clearly a prat, Harry would even admit that yes, he was kind of hot. In that regard, he was almost as bad as Jackie; Harry almost,
Harry shook his head. "I try not to," he said. The Wizarding world… Harry was still a part of it. The fame of his name, his status, his role as the Saviour of their lifestyle and defeater of Voldemort, was still an attachment that clung to his name regardless of the position he now assumed. If anything, being a model and character of magazines and billboards seemed to enhance it, just as Gertrude had once speculated that it would.
"- then you'll be married. No doubt. And yes, killed one another. If you'll recall, you used to be at one another's throats back in our school days, and not in the kinky way."
"I think you mean burned and hanged," Harry said.
"Hm?" Harry had all but forgotten what he'd asked. He didn't really care, after all.
Draco thought as he eyed the man tripping over his tongue in an effort to find coherence.
He didn't want to.
"Does it take a good shot?"
Harry froze once more. He almost didn't dare to lift his gaze towards Malfoy and could only manage as much as flicking his eyes up towards him. Any thought of understanding and comprehending his mixed feelings dissolved beneath the weight of a greater concern. "What… are you doing?"
"House arrest isn't quite incarceration."
"I don't mind," Harry said. "Dinner, maybe? I can pick something up if you'd like and drop by."
Harry used to have that. Or he used to have something like that. It had always been a little different, though. Always a little less impassioned. When he was a kid, his every move was guided by the Dursleys. When he'd gone to school, the teachers had laid down further restrictions, and Hogwarts was no different. Dumbledore just added another layer, and Voldemort unwittingly with his maddened pursuit of Harry's life.
"I…" Harry reattempted. His head shook slightly, not in denial but confusion. "I don't."
Jill's smile widened as she glanced between them both. "Sure. I'll come. I don't think I'll ask Abel to sniff them out for you, though, if it's all the same."
"Why not? Slacker."
Harry shrugged. He hadn't really expected Draco to agree to change entirely. "I'll settle for just me and my friends to start with, then."
Harry flickered a glance down at his salad. A bubble of distaste fizzled in his belly. "And you," he said quietly, "have to cover up your bruises so that people won't see what they don't want to be blamed for."
Pausing, straining his ears, Draco listened for bathroom attendees. When nothing but the hum of electrical lighting and the crackling flickers of that overhead light replied, he released his pent breath and slipped silently through the door. A flick of his wand locked the door behind him once more, and he was shouldering through the heavy door and striding from the distinctly grimy room without a backwards glance.
"I'm easy," the dark boy said.
Inconceivable.
Draco opened his mouth but closed it again a moment later. What could he say to that? It was, regrettably, somewhat true. Draco didn't favour admitting his own incompetency. He was, if nothing else, a pursuer of perfection.
Muggles employees was still a necessary part of the contract he had to fulfil. Only for one more day, but even so. Lost in his thoughts as he was, Draco didn't even realise he was being followed until his shoulder was grabbed and he was hauled into a side alley that was barely more than a crevasse between office buildings.
"A meeting?"
It wasn't late when they finished. It wasn't particularly cold when they left. It wasn't crowded on the footpath just outside of the restaurant, and Draco led the way to an Apparition point that wasn't too far away. Yet to Harry, it all felt wrong. Too short. Too easy. Too… final. The first time they'd actually spent time together outside of work solely in one another's company and it would be the last time. Harry knew it would be.
Harry didn't quite have that. His was a little different. But, mock as Ron might, and tease as Ginny would that he 'had somehow gained a better fashion sense than all of them combined', and confused though Hermione was whenever he mentioned work – because modelling was a trivial pursuit, wasn't it? It wasn't really a proper job – he needed it. Harry needed it, and he needed to be wanted for what he could do.
"You're –?"
Harry accepted the offer and wordlessly stripped himself of the skin-tight shirt and slacks he'd worn for the shoot. Naturally, Von stepped forward to assist him – he could never help himself from becoming involved in the simple routine, even when it was unnecessary – and Harry didn't mind. Whatever modesty he'd once possessed was by and large abandoned years before.
Harry hadn't realised his hands were shaking until his cup nearly slipped from his fingers. Catching himself, he swallowed thickly, reached for the jug and filled it once more as he knew he probably shouldn't – he had a shoot tomorrow, he knew he wasn't good with alcohol, and he didn't even like it that much – but he did. Harry drained half of it in one mouthful as Draco continued before dragging his attention back towards him.
"Sure. Whatever. Which we're going to remedy." Harry shook the thought aside for the moment, meeting Draco and Pansy's stares of what he could only assume was wariness once more. "Call us whatever you'd like, but magic? I've been doing that shit since I was a kid. Don't presume to take it away from me with your sense of entitlement."
Feigning nonchalance, Draco shrugged. He glanced briefly down at the stack of pictures in his hands. "That depends."
But he couldn't. Or not yet, anyway. Not while the interviews were being released, and rage and hatred was thick. Harry had attempted in those interviews to paint them in the better light that they deserved, but it was the decision of the world whether or not they'd take the direction he offered them. He couldn't force it upon them.
- more than a little… confused. Harry frowned. "What?"
Hermione nodded slowly at first, then with more vigour. "Yes. Exactly."
"Shut the fuck up, Jackie," Harry said. He hoped the warmth that swept up his throat into his cheeks was only felt rather than seen.
"I have a good reason," he said as Jackie harrumphed, wriggling in the bed beside him and shuffling a little closer. He'd said the same thing numerous times before but this time… "I promise, I do."
"Shut your trap, kid," Jacob snapped at him, not even sparing him a glance from where he met Harry's eyes with a narrowed stare. "This is Potting Point business."
"I need them more than you do. My education is important."
"To what situation?" Draco asked, readjusting his arms around Harry.
"You're welcome. I've thought as much for some time, now. Do you know what else I've realised?"
Dropping his forehead onto his knees, Harry wrapped his arms around his legs and buried his face into them. His breaths came in harsh pants, shaking and heavy, and he focused as much of his attention as he could muster upon slowing them. It was better to try that, to think about that, then to consider his parents downstairs. Better than to imagine what they could be saying to one another, what they could be planning on saying to him, what truths to tell and what ones they would keep hidden. How much didn't he know? It turned his gut, flooded the back of his throat with the sharp taste of acid.
"Can I get you a top-up?" he asked of Ginny instead.
He'd forgotten that they wouldn't be in their uniforms. How had he forgotten? How could he not have predicted that if Draco was good looking in uniform, he would be all the more so in casual slacks, boots, and a fitted jacket?
How quickly sheer joy and intimate privacy could be shattered. Harry had barely a second to share a glance with Draco before they simultaneously threw themselves into motion, all but tumbling onto the floor in their haste. A flurry of scrambling, of straightening clothes and hair and buckling belts; Harry almost fell off his bed for a second time in the process. Straightening, he had barely a second to throw another harried glance towards Draco, to whisper a harsh "It's okay, I promise" before the door was flung open.
"I won't be long, though. I promise. Then we'll go… somewhere. I don't know where, but we'll get out of here. And I'll tell you everything I can."
Walking in between Jackie and Jill, he headed towards where Abel had already taken up residence in the back corner of the scattering of chairs. Or he tried to head there; enthusiasm and excitement didn't entirely distract his classmates from their usual antics.
"I think you might be getting confused."
"I didn't destroy it though, did I?"
The best looking – which Pansy had once agreed with in awe and then with increasing derision – and the smartest. The best, most reputable at school, too, which he'd managed with the exception of a single infuriating Muggleborn that planted herself firmly in his way.
"Oh. Still, we could make a day trip of it."
"Maybe we could come again on the weekend?" Hermione suggested. "There's a sign on the counter that says they have a two-for-one special on Sunday morning."
Harry cringed. "N-no, it's not, it's –"
A hint of warmth pooled in Harry's cheeks, but he ignored it. It wasn't like Malfoy had said anything about it anyway. Once, maybe, he might have ensured that Harry never heard the end of it. Once, he probably would have kicked up a fuss and practically thrown Harry across the room if he'd so much as bumped into him, let alone tripped and fallen into his lap.
"I'm happy to just get a couple of pizzas to share," he said to the rest of his friends.
, and –
"For real? There's charms for that"
"They've got magic, Draco."
It was a question but redundant. Draco's voice was low, little more than a whisper, and Harry shivered again. His boyfriend. Here. In the same bed as him. It seemed such an impossibility, despite that they'd been dating for weeks.
There were the moments when he seemed to lose track of time. Countless nights when he didn't sleep quite as well as he used to – or had he ever really slept well? Harry didn't know. Maybe he'd just never noticed he hadn't.
"I won't."
A school that was a castle.
"Dumbass."
It was before that, in Diagon Alley, when Draco had been in Madam Malkin's being fitted for his robe. The frustratingly necessary fitting had been interrupted by a boy in oversized, patchy clothes, alone and peering into the shop with wide eyes and a mixture of fascination and wariness. That Harry had been nervous. He'd been tentative, if brave enough to step forward, even alone as he was. He'd been skinny and pale, and had breathed of the independence that Draco had only been able to recognise because he'd seen just such an attitude in his friend Blaise.
A/N: Bloody hell, I didn't realise the length of the preamble of this story until going over it and editing the chapters. I apologise for what might seem like somewhat extensive preliminaries. I promise what is essentially the 'meat' of the story is just around the corner. Please do your best to stick with me till then! Have a long chapter as compensation.
Harry shrugged awkwardly. "I don't want to make things uncomfortable."
Harry blinked. "What?"
"After seeing it enough times, you sort of get used to it." Harry's tone became a little rueful. "It becomes almost easy to pick up on sometimes. A lot of people only want one thing. Not all of them, but the way even those people stare? It's the same."
"Harry," the man said, attention swinging towards where Harry had appeared at Draco's side. "This? Oh, ah – nothing. Nothing at all. Malfoy was just being a mouthy git, as ever."
"She's not that bad," Harry said, though he scrambled to retrieve his phone.
Harry nodded, and that was enough for Ipetsky. Offering a brief, communal farewell to the room in the form of a lazy wave, he sauntered out as though he owned the place. The static silence that arose in his absence was likely ominous only to Draco.
Harry thought it was a bit of a leap for Jackie to have made, but he supposed she would know. Jackie's own parents had raised her in a staunchly Christian household, and it was, to his understanding, a contributing factor to their reluctance to accept her sexuality. They'd overcome it because they were inevitably good people, but some things still seemed to linger.
"Well, I only recently found out," Harry began.
"Tell me about it."
"Harry?" someone asked, and
The shift didn't go unnoticed. Glancing back towards Jacob and his friends, Harry saw Keith take an unconscious step backwards. Bruce shifted between his feet, eyeing each of the Hogwarts students in turn. Even Jacob, always so full of hot air, was shunted from from his posturing. He stared at Draco unblinkingly, and though his sneer was still fixed, it appeared more affixed by a change in the wind than for with actual ferocity. His audible swallow only enhanced the effects.
Iron-hard, but not tight. Firm, but somehow it hadn't been demanding. It hadn't been confining and restrictive. Harry couldn't feel intimidated or dominated in Draco's grasp, not when his fingers trembled just noticeably.
"Did you have plans? Being a journalist seems to suit you so well, Pansy. You've got a knack for it, you know. I sure as hell wouldn't be able to do what you do."
"Can we not talk about this?" he said quietly.
Draco smiled softy. He could do that when Pansy was only on the other end of the phoneline; she couldn't poke fun at him if she didn't know he did it. "Thanks. Maybe you should take a trip too?"
How his lip curled in a shadowed impression of his old sneer when he came across a fact, an explanation, an error that didn't sit right.
"Alright, then," she said, scratching out a few words. "I figure today we'll just have a bit of a rundown of what we'll be doing, brainstorm the potential routes we want to take, and work from there. Yes?"
"Okay, Mum."
Harry nodded again.
He should – Pansy said he should –
Draco poked his knee with a toe, invoking the same fluttering warmth spreading from the point of contact. "No, Harry. As I've told you, I'm not confusing real magic with 'the occult'."
"… have to make the usual rounds," Ipetsky was saying with a sigh. The long-suffering tinge was wiped aside by his smirk that arose a moment later. "Consider me proud when I heard how many people are talking about you. And not just because of the interviews, mind."
Except that a fair portion of them wore robes.
"I'm comfortable enough," Draco said, as though he'd heard Harry's thoughts. When Harry glanced up at him, he shrugged. "You make a fairly functional blanket."
But Harry didn't have a wand, and he wasn't even sure his own magic, what little he had, would work. That he couldn't use it, that it hadn't already acted for him, was nothing if not undermining of what little confidence in his abilities he'd had. Draco had said he'd Apparated on the day that he'd first been told about real magic. That time, he'd been desperate. So, why couldn't he do it again?
Harry learned that the divisions between the houses, the stark lines that had once defined them, seemed to have become blurred. Those that remained in Slytherin house still bore a distinct quietness, something that resonated with pain and even a little guilt, but they weren't hated. Harry suspected that maybe they were the ones that hated themselves the most. It was a strange possibility, but more apparent by the day.
"Please. Stop."
"Which one was it? Was it the -?"
"Hello?" he asked of an unknown number.
By three weeks into term, routine had firmly settled. It was no less manic, and Harry was realising more and more each day just what an impact a year of listless hiding and running did to his education. He'd never really cared about his grades, but that was before. That was when fighting, defeating, and surviving Voldemort came first and school second. He hadn't realised just how firmly he'd subconsciously placed everything else on the sidelines until it was pushed to the forefront.
But Harry couldn't spare Draco much more thought than that as he made for the high fence surrounding the school.
"Why won't it work?!"
Harry didn't know what direction the voice had come from, so he didn't bother replying. Closing his eyes briefly, squeezing them shut as his head pounded like a drum for reasons he couldn't quite pinpoint, he took a moment to stand and gather his bearings. Was he still holding his cup? He thought he was. Yes, that was definitely a cup still in his hand. That was good. For some reason, Harry decided that was a very, very good thing.
Harry couldn't help but think as, leaning against the back wall and deafening himself to the murmurs and snapped directions of the photography crew that flowed around him, he observed through the passing morning.
Harry shook his head again, turning his face into Draco's jacket. "I'd like to, Draco. I really would. But… maybe not. Or at least, not yet."
Harry knew he was interpreting it the wrong way. He knew that it was for study, or for the strange obsession that Draco had with his magic tricks. Each and every time they met at the library he requested one or two demonstrations, despite exhausting Harry's inventory. He had specifics that he would ask for a repeat performance of, and Harry…
"You don't say."
Draco didn't let Pansy's words get to him. He was rather good at denying them access after a lifelong friendship, and they slid off of him without leaving a stain. "What about it?"
The Dragon's Nest was an old building refurbished for the short, express purpose of housing the returning eighteen-year-olds whose final year of education had been crushed by the weight of Voldemort's war. Surprisingly – or perhaps not surprisingly at all – there were only a handful of students in Harry's year who didn't return. When the feast in the Great Hall drew to a close, when the eighth years wandered in a slow but constant stream towards their new dormitories, he saw the familiar faces of many that he almost expected never to see again.
"It wasn't meant to be my responsibility. It just happened that way."
"We didn't –"
"Aren't you in your final year?" Draco repeated.
For a second, Harry couldn't breathe. All that hung in fractured statements in his mind was "Photographer?" and "but Draco's my photographer". Until it registered that Draco wasn't talking about himself at all.
He was pulling out his psychology textbook and scribbled notes moments later, questioning for the umpteenth time just why on earth he'd decided to take the subject at all. Thoughts of C&C, of snotty and slightly strange boarding school kids, and of magical superstitions, left his mind within moments. This group project was a long-term endeavour. Or would be for at least the next few months. He didn't need to worry about it right now.
Ron could never pass up a bit of gossip. He was funny like that. The sound of a tool being placed down on a table clanked on the edges of Harry's hearing. "Something good?"
"Are you kidding?" Jackie said. "Harry has better taste than that."
"Do I get a contract? What's the duration like? How many hands will I have to help -?"
The only thing Harry really cared about was that he was content. Unexpectedly content – or unexpectedly to some Wizarding interviewers that still shook their heads as they called him a 'darling Saviour'. Fashion, photographs, his name in gossip magazines more often than tagged to news headlines… It wasn't necessarily what he'd wanted, but Harry was busying himself and that was satisfying enough.
"Devastating attractiveness?" More self-deprecation, if brightened somewhat by his smile. "Well, I wouldn't go that far. I think the world just finds it difficult to have the image of an idol or hero or whatever without also having them as suitably handsome. Let's face it, we all know that's most of the reason I managed to get into modeling anyway."
"Draco?"
Harry sighed. Throughout the room, the wealth of chatter and bubbling laughter was thicker than what usually infected the hall. Their final class before the Christmas break found many with itchy feet and drifting attention, eager for freedom.
Harry almost wished he hadn't seen it at all.
"Do you think I care?" Draco said.
"Then you're lovers?"
It hadn't been a problem in Diagon Alley. The sharp contrast to the rest of London, however, made it that much harder to ignore. That much harder to pretend, and infinitely harder to enjoy.
Draco shook his head. Would he ever object to Harry's presence? "Not in the least. Provided he doesn't make a scene of himself."
"I'm not looking down on you," Draco said after a long pause.
"Nope," Ginny interrupted him. "No way, Harry. We're your friends, and this is important to you."
Draco shrugged, casting a glance over his shoulder. "Probably."
"With him?" Pansy rolled her eyes in direct contrast to Blaise's abruptly wide grin.
"Well, not all the time –"
"You too, then, Dean?" Harry asked, glancing towards Dean. He couldn't quite help but tease just a little. "It's Dean, right? Convenient that it's the same model. That makes it so much easier to learn how to use it. I was shit at working it all out, to be honest. Had to ask my uncle to help, which is kind of pathetic."
"This is the first time I've heard of Potting Point participating in an exchange program. I wonder why they've decided to do it?"
It was a little sad, when Harry thought about it. Draco was changing, and Blaise was changing. Everyone in the rest of their year group was growing and climbing the impossible mountain towards some thin promise of recovery. Even Harry, though he wasn't quite sure what 'recovery' looked like. He didn't think he needed to know, or at least not yet; he could dawdle, and in dawdling he could revel in sharing Draco's company and absorbing the comfort of that company that had grown to mean so much to him in the past year.
"Good morning, Jacob. Are you alright? You're looking a little peaky."
Sirius?
Harry didn't know how long he would have to wait. He had faith that Draco would meet him with the utmost promptness, but he still might have to wait. Harry wouldn't go far, just out of sight of his house, then he would call for Draco through the mirror again. He wouldn't – couldn't conceive having to spend any longer alone beneath the smothering weight that had fallen upon him.
"I didn't steal the dog, I found it."
Draco cast a glance over his shoulder. Their wall. The wall for both of them, of both of them. Gaze drifting over the images – mostly of Harry, some few of himself, and a scattering of them both when Draco had charmed the camera to take it of them – Draco smiled.
Not that Draco cared. Or Pansy. Or Harry, for that matter.
Stepping up to Draco's chair, Harry turned his gaze properly upon him. It was strange to be positioned that much higher than him, above him, with Draco's face upturned and as splintered and open as a shattered window. Strange, but not entirely unfamiliar. How many times had Harry sat in his lap, glanced at his face sidelong, clambered over him and off of him with increasing ease and casualness?
At the sight of the crowd of whispering onlookers, however, a growing crowd that rapidly began pointing and exclaiming aloud more than whispering, Harry knew his anonymous return to London rapidly dissolve before the weight of recognition. Slipping the newspaper back onto its stand, he leaned towards where Draco had very deliberately planted himself between him and the crowd.
and turned onto the street towards the bus stop. He didn't want to, not really, but such a performance for the sake of the
"No boyfriend tonight?" James had asked the previous evening.
Glancing around his room, Harry stumbled to his feet and snatched up the shoes he'd discarded upon entering with Draco what felt like so long ago. He stepped into them, grabbed his similarly discarded jacket, and slung it over his shoulders before carefully rewrapping the two-way mirror and slipping it into his pocket. With another glance around the room, he paused long enough to rifle through his bag and stuff his wallet into his back pocket before turning towards the door. Only to disregard it a moment later and head for the window.
It wasn't like this. Nothing like this. Harry hadn't asked for it, wasn't even sure he wanted to hear it, but –
"- and you don't think that has a whole lot to do with it?" At the lull that met her words, Thalia clicked her tongue again. "To hell with you all, then."
"Become a model." Shaking his head slowly, Draco lowered his fork with the faintest
Harry squeezed his eyes shut.
"And maybe the Glacier Garden?" Harry suggested. At Draco's quizzical glance, he waved his free hand vaguely. "Josef, the receptionist – he mentioned them the other day. When Madame Clementine met you in the foyer, remember?" At Draco's nod and shrug, he added, "He said they were a bit of a hit for tourists or whatever."
The comfortable exchange, a backdrop to Draco's setting up and Dawley and Yu's murmured conversation, was nothing if not familiar. It had become so over the past weeks. Regardless of the fact that it had only occurred twice before, it felt somehow natural. When Von arrived, which he would at any moment, it would be just the five of them. Just the five in their small space, an isolated bubble in the midst of
"Don't kill anyone, Jackie," Harry said. Despite his sudden disappointment in the Hogwarts prefects he'd previously thought were kind of lright, he didn't want any bloodshed.
As if it could ever be damaging. Harry didn't think that Draco's company could be considered 'bad', even if he failed his A-levels because of it. He might be getting ahead of himself, but Draco felt like the best thing to come out of his school experience. Like, ever.
"You handled it perfectly fine yourself."
"Isn't that what your stylist is for?"
"Only because you wouldn't let me," Jackie retorted. She was already making her way down the pavement, and Harry and Jill hasten their steps to catch up. "I would have done it."
Harry found, quite unexpectedly, that he could watch Draco unendingly and not grow tired of it. There were little things, little features and little twitches, that he'd never noticed before. Things that had never mattered but now felt utterly integral in compiling who Draco was.
"I'm serious," Draco said, voice rising slightly.
"What?" Harry glanced up at him. "You mean with real…?"
Not the way that, as that figure writhed as though truly burning, convulsing before slumping to the floor, its face morphed again into something else. Someone else. Someone recognised on sight, and someone he knew all too well.
Draco paused, his lips still parted. "What I'm doing?"
If anything, it had gotten worse. So much worse, and mounting with every renewed bout of exhausted fear.
Shaking his head, Harry fell into step alongside Draco as they followed in Jackie's wake. He glanced at him sidelong, caught his eyes, and tucked his chin to hide a smile that mirrored the one Draco wore. It was faintly conspiratorial, faintly teasing, and entirely something that only they shared.
Then nothing.
Harry hadn't climbed from his window in a long time. Not since Jackie had fallen when they were kids and his parents – well, they hadn't expressly forbidden him, but they were both made acutely aware that if they were ever caught again there would be hell to pay. As Harry wedged the window open as far as it could go, he briefly ducked back from the blast of cold that immediately struck him before slinging a leg over the sill. He couldn't help but feel a touch of perverse pleasure from the notion that he was going against his parent's will.
"Well, when you nearly get blasted to pieces in your first round of a tournament, it sort of sets you up for failure."
, he thought but didn't say, because it wouldn't make a difference to Jackie. He'd never been a fan of group work, and that reason stemmed from the fact that Jackie contributed so little. It was alright when he worked with Jill as well given that she at least tried, and Abel did his part, but just Jackie?
"I'm not – it's not that I –" Harry cut himself off, pursed his lips, and frowned. He drew his gaze sidelong, aware but not quite able to stop himself from easing from his rigidity into the comfort Draco's lap. "Last I checked, we didn't like each other. Do we?"
"You know," he said slowly, tipping his head once more, "a magician never reveals their tricks."
"I know," Draco said harshly. He gave a sharp shake of his head, lowering his gaze. "And neither do I, because I can't help feeling utterly stupid things, and you can't help that you don't."
Picard grunted lowly again. Despite her diminutive stature, it didn't seem strange coming from her. "I think 'meet-and-greet' is an improper use of terms."
"Are you still studying, Harry?"
Why Draco felt the need to protest, he didn't know. It could have been that Pansy was right and that it wasn't the life he'd wanted for himself – but then neither had being a Death Eater, or being incarcerated for two years. It could have been because he truly didn't like being incompetent at something and he would have to start from step one if he were to be a photographer – but then, every skill had to be started for the first time once. He chewed the inside of his cheek for a moment, frowning, until –
Huffing with laughter more at himself than anything in particular, Harry gave up trying to push himself upright. Malfoy's lap-chair was surprisingly comfortable, though maybe that was just compared to the floor?
"Hardly." Draco couldn't quite keep the disgruntlement from his voice. It didn't matter that he'd had no prior interest in photography; he disliked admitting his ineptitude in any area.
"Was that Pansy?"
Truth be told, Harry didn't know why Draco had decided to be his boyfriend. He hadn't seemed the type, and Harry thought he'd become rather adept at discerning those sort of 'types' over the past few years. It wasn't hard to tell when a boy looked at him whether they were just looking or really
The unfinished threat was understood despite its incompleteness. Draco had no intention of acting up. Despite the crowds, the potential for ostracism if not outright acts of hatred, there was something comforting about being back in his own country again. Even if his parents weren't with him this time, and even if unfavourable memories did wash up a little more frequently. Draco was relieved to be home.
So simple. Maybe too simple. But it felt, sounded, tasted so perfect as Harry's breath touched Draco's lips that he wouldn't have it any other way. Draco lost himself in Harry's kisses, his arms, and the warmth of him as he pressed against him in return with a sore and desperate need.
Jackie smirked. "Bullshit."
Jill smiled, eyes bright even in the evening gloom and dimples flashing. Blaise grinned and waggled his eyebrows. Pansy huddled in her coat, cursing under her breath at the pedestrians that passed alongside them and huffing in a cloud of smoke and shook her head. And Jackie –
"It's not like it's hard," Harry said. "You just… learn. And practise."
Except that it felt like it was. It felt like something. Harry didn't quite know what that something was, but he'd been feeling it since a handful of weeks before when Draco seemed to finally grasp the nature of their topic of choice.
"What?" Ron asked, shifting his attention towards her.
Harry was one of them. A cluster of ex-Gryffindors was still loosely scattered around him, but the continuity of whatever conversation they'd been having had long since broken. Harry couldn't even remember what they'd been talking about. He sat between Ron and Hermione, as he so often found himself – or he'd thought he did. He hadn't noticed either of them move, but when he lifted his surprisingly heavy head from where he gazed into the dregs of his cup, only Hermione remained at his side. A bottle was still clasped in her hands, though upon squinting at it, Harry was fairly sure it was empty.
"In the fridge?"
"Of course not. You'd surely think up something far more prestigious and less… pun-ey."
"Don't pretend you don't love it," Harry said, smiling for an entirely different reason this time.
"Hi, Mum."
He hadn't intended to use the powder in his pocket for a distraction against bullies. Truth be told, he hadn't even remembered putting it in there, had only considered doing so days before, and definitely not to use it as he did. For a show, maybe, but for Draco, not a bunch of thick-skulled arseholes with a vendetta against him. It was luck more than anything that he hadn't had a chance to use it that day. Luck, or maybe fate. He certainly hadn't planned a trick with the glittery dust that day.
"We've got to head into hair and makeup, if that's okay," he said, deliberately diverting the conversation. "It'll only take about an hour, and Von will likely already have your outfits ready, so…"
It wasn't the movement that was disconcerting, however. It was the stark, printed words WARNING and DEATH EATERS in block letters. It was the faces themselves, thin and gaunt yet more often than not twisted into a sneer, a scowl, a cruel smile or bared teeth. One woman even seemed to peer down at the words beneath her and harrumph with contempt before tossing her head and sweeping her manacled arms across her chest.
And Harry sat. He sat quietly in the comfortable presence of his friends, the company that him every other night more often than not, and returned his attention to his magazine. He liked the laughter, the voices, the half-questions flung towards him without really expecting a reply, but he didn't necessarily feel the need to participate. He loved his friends, but sometimes…
Dot's grasp upon her papers radiated creases from the points her fingers grasped. "I don't suppose you've read much of the
For they were Muggles, Draco realised. Muggles in a Muggle club. He didn't care, and would probably even prefer a Muggle establishment if he actually had any preference at all, but he had to wonder.
"Yeah, but still."
Except at that moment. Right then, Draco sorely wished that it wasn't Harry standing before him.
"Fine. You're not getting a present this year, then."
"No," Harry said quietly. "It wasn't."
"I didn't say I have a problem."
"Yesterday?" Harry frowned, scratching his memory to recall what she was referring to. His mind conjured a text Ginny had sent him days before. "Wasn't Gin doing a shoot for the end of the season?"
Harry turned slowly back to the store. There was so much wrong with that suggestion that he didn't even know where to begin. The money, for one. Draco had already bought him an exorbitantly expensive outfit that day, as well as a number of knick-knacks that he'd purchased before Harry had even been aware of what he was doing. He might not know the ins and outs of the unusual gold, silver, and bronze coins that Draco palmed to the cashiers, but it couldn't have been a cheap day all up.
"I'm coming back, you know," he said for what must have been the thousandth time that evening. "Literally as much as I can."
Even so, standing in the brisk cold outside a museum of magic, his friends just out of earshot, and enduring Lily's worrying was a trial. After a long drive of listening to music too loud and Jackie's off-key sing-a-long, Harry was beginning to feel the telltale signs of a headache coming on.
Harry believed them. He did. But he couldn't shake the feeling that 'something' would regardless.
"I'll do it." Draco reached for his wand without shifting his gaze from Harry even slightly. As he did, his other hand slid along Harry's thigh until it was cupping his arse with that same, slightly grasping hold. Harry bit back a shiver. They were doing it. They were actually going to go through with this. All those talks in third and fourth year from long-suffering Heads of Houses, all the clinical precautioning of diseases and 'safe sex' from a surprisingly proficient Madam Pomfrey, seemed so removed from the real thing. Even the past half an hour Harry had spent in the bathroom, putting into dubious practice the once-confounding yet now entirely reasonable descriptions he'd read, felt somehow distant.
"Like Pansy." Dimitri folded his arms as he too turned his appreciative gaze upon his wall. "She's told me only a little about it."
"But it's good. Right?"
Only to glance up reflexively as Harry entered the room.
Harry smiled. "Then we'll go into the town. Maybe to more than just a restaurant?"
Jackie's nod was vehement. "Good.
The kettle whistled.
He hadn't known how bloody good it could be, either.
"It hit you, didn't it?"
!" Ron all but shouted. "Come on, please? It's not fair that you'd get to poke around HQ for – for whatever it was you were shooting for."
Fiddling up his tumbler, Harry only shrugged again. He wouldn't call their Monday afternoon confrontation an argument. Not really. As Harry had also gradually realised, if he decided it wasn't, most of the time it really wasn't. Arguments – or fights – tended to develop on the basis that both parties expected them to proceed. Harry had learnt that it was almost easy to dodge or deflect a challenge when he denied participation in them.
"As a matter of fact," Draco said, uncrossing his legs and straightening in his seat, "Harry and I have been most efficient. I daresay that we should finish any remaining leads in our research in the next few sessions and shall be able to produce the end product weeks in advance for the presentation."
"I thought you went out to a club."
"Don't worry about it." Harry piled his discarded books together and slung his bag over his shoulder. He spared them both a smile. "Catch you after class, 'kay?"
Harry Potter had lost his anger, and with it, Draco had assumed he'd lost his voice. He'd assumed that, like so many models he'd come across, he had retreated into being a voiceless, obliging doll before the camera, malleable and obedient, with little tendency towards more active responses when away from the limelight, too. From what Draco had seen, he'd appeared to be just that.
"They find him," Gertrude emphasised, as though that meant something. "What do you think?"
Draco shook his head and raised a hand to his head. As if he'd automatically felt its disorderliness, he pressed upon the slight mess of his hair, erasing it in an instant. "No," he said, his voice thick and a little hoarse with sleep. "I was already waking up."
"You're annoying," Ron said. "And getting worse in your old age."
"It is somewhat delicate," Pansy said, nodding.
Harry opened his mouth to reply, then paused. He'd never really thought about it. Not ever. It had always been one restriction after the other placed upon him, one barrier to even considering it following the last. Living with the Dursleys, school at Hogwarts, the war, and then after that the interviews, the fame he'd never wanted, the job that had been handed to him yet somehow seemed to cocoon him in tangling, clinging shrouds more tightly than any of those constraints preceding it.
"Don't apologise to me. Apologise to him."
Harry raised a shoulder. "Well, I've got to keep you on your toes."
"Boring?" Seamus offered.
Picking up his pace slightly, Harry manage to skirt around Draco to plant himself in front of him mid-step. Draco nearly barrelled through him, catching himself only at the last moment to avoid a collision.
Harry offered her another tokenistic smile in return. This kind of small talk - he hated it. He'd always hated it, had never seen the need for speaking when there was nothing important or enjoyment to talk about, and that dislike hadn't faded over time as he'd become desensitised to the rest of the frivolous proceedings. If anything, he thought his distaste had grown with frequent exposure. The only difference was that he was more adept at reciprocating in kind.
It was like watching a fish swim. Pansy was in her element, in the refined context of
Draco finally turned towards him. The ghost of a smile touched his lips, though it didn't seem all that amused. "Magic," he said simply.
"The world is a cesspool of unfairness, Harry."
"Draco?"
"Doing my best," Harry said, managing a smile that felt more than a little shy. He couldn't remember the last time he'd been properly bashful. "Bear with me."
"Are you not cleaning yours off, Ginny?"
"Yeah. Right."
Harry slowed to a stop, his own gloved hands slipping from his pockets. He stared at the back of Draco's retreating back until Draco realised he'd left him behind. When he turned, it was with an expectant and expected touch of a smirk to his lips. "What?"

' reception room. He nodded briefly at Meghan, gestured indicatively towards the hallway and back room it entailed, and pretended he didn't notice the way her lips thinned and a frown touched her brow.
, he thought idly, watching as a pair of young women latched onto one another, the shorter stretching on her toes to plant a sloppy kiss on the corner of the taller one's mouth.
"But true. Serves her right. Honestly, did you see her spread last issue? Who decided it was alright to let her loose with frills
"The body rebelling against you," Blaise said, nodding solemnly. "How tragic."
He gave a mental shake of his head, settled himself a little more comfortably in his seat that Malfoy hadn't yet tossed him off, and readjusted his hold on the microscope. Only to freeze at the unexpected warmth of Malfoy's chest as it brushed against his back, the hyperawareness of his arm reaching around Harry with probe extended to prod at the smear.
"The Leaky Cauldron?" Harry asked casually, though he was all-too aware of their clasped hands. Why it bothered him so much more that day than usual he didn't quite know; maybe it was because they'd been in Muggle London and he was made even more aware of potentially watchful eyes, of the judgment that those eyes could hold. Somehow, it was infinitely easier to be loudly proud of himself and his sexuality when he didn't have to consider a second person.
Why the hell are we still talking about birds? Harry wondered, though he only smiled at Draco. "Yeah, maybe a good idea."
He was still watching as she and her horde drew into the arms of the gate and stared up at the school. A few of the kids glanced towards Harry, and Harry stared unabashedly back at them. No, definitely no recognition, which was unlikely of city residents his age. Even the kids from the other two high schools in the city were all familiar faces. It was only when the woman turned towards him that he was able to drag his attention from them.
Draco's hand was all but immobile in his own, but that was okay. Harry guided his arousal towards him, easing himself backwards at the same time. His own breath caught at the moment they touched, but he forced himself to relax, to inhale –
Drawing his gaze over the masses, Harry took a slow step through the opening in the wall. He was barely aware of the hand Draco still held. He stared at the people, so many witches and wizards that couldn't be mistaken as anything else, and shook his head slowly. So many. So many magical people, people like him – or so Draco claimed. Somehow, seeing the people, catching a glimpse into their world, made all the difference.
When Harry thought, however, it wasn't about his own death. It wasn't about the things he'd noticed of himself and what niggled and gnawed like a starving dog with a decrepit bone – or at least not entirely. Staring down at Draco, Harry was brought back to their Potions class, their casual exchange, the digs that were barbed but weren't really cruel. That Harry had sat on Draco's knees as he had before, but deliberately. He'd thought about that a whole lot, actually.
They weren't the only one, on both ends of the spectrum. Harry watched with silent curiosity as his classmates, people he had known for nearly half his life, shifted and shuffled, adjusting into the newfound liberty they abruptly found themselves in. Some left the school immediately, returning to their families as was permitted of them, or leaping upon the opportunity to seek a vacation. Parvati and Padma had disappeared almost the hour after their final examination, and many had followed shortly afterwards.
"You know," he said, taking a bite thickly lathered in peanut butter.
"No. Not to me."
"It would make sense I suppose, given you're studying communication," Jill said.
"You don't believe me?"
"Ha. Yeah. I guess you could say it's inherited? Even living without being exposed to it – I guess it's in my blood."
"Sick crap?" Draco all but hissed.
"Yeah, I saw that too." The kid tipped his head as he beeped a block of cheese past the scanner. "Are you as much of an asshole as everyone says you are? 'Cause, you know, I've read some pretty serious shit, and if you're really that much of an asshole then –"
"I do," Draco said, sharper than he'd intended. "I want – I want to –"
Instead, he offered Draco's hand back to him, folded his arms on the desk before him, and dropped his head down on top of them. Facing his direction, he watched as Draco regarded him in return, frowning slightly, before slowly picking up his quill once more. He didn't start writing again, though.
"Still, this is just…"
"I will," Draco said. He stared at Harry for a long moment, his eyes seeming to speak words that Harry could almost hear – reassurance, and comfort, and sincere care – before he nodded and the image flickered out. Harry was left staring at his own reflection once more, only detachedly registering that he looked on the verge of tears.
He should have been the one standing before the camera. Or he should be even just once. Harry was unexpectedly saddened that, despite his presence and what he could do and be, the Wizarding world would never allow someone like Draco stand in the limelight for appreciation and recognition. Even behind the camera he was all but openly shunned, and sometimes it wasn't even hidden.
Then the next magazine:
Harry shrugged. "No. Not really."
To the company of only his own footsteps, Harry slipped through that silence. It was a little jarring, if comfortably so, after the vibrancy of his fellow eighth years. He would hazard a guess that Draco had likely appreciated it in much the same way as he was. If nothing else, that isolation, the quietude it entailed, was something they shared. Something that Harry had realised was one of several commonalities. Commonalities and… liking?
"I can't believe you're pinning this on me!" Harry exclaimed. Then he dissolved into laughter and, if it was louder than the situation warranted, he didn't really care.
"Don't."
"Besides, what's yours is mine, effectively."
Modelling hadn't fit him at first. It wasn't something he'd ever considered for himself. But it surprisingly fit more than being an Auror had.
"She's had a lot less on her plate these days since you've been gone," Meghan said, recapturing Harry's attention. "She's picked up a few other pet projects, but both of the models are…" She trailed off as she scanned the page. She nodded decisively a second later, glancing back up to Harry. "She's got an opening until nine-thirty. Shall I…?"
Harry frowned. He felt his hackles rise slightly and had to deliberately smooth them down. "Why?" he asked. "Because Muggles aren't worthy of knowing?"
Which he was. Would be. Would hopefully be for a long, long time. Cancelling his lease was the first step in sealing that deal, and though an unexpected twinge of sadness had welled within Draco as he'd handed over the keys to his old flat, the doors that opened as the others closed were worth the pain a hundred times over.
"It'll probably only take until lunch time for your part," Harry said to his friends, just as he had several times that morning already. "I promise, I won't use up your whole day."
"She's less elitist in her choice of restaurants than she once was. I believe she did an editorial on the hidden gems of London's culinary world in her early years."
"I apologies," Draco abruptly blurted out. "I didn't mean to wrongfully intrude upon your home, Mr. Evans." Stepping around Harry, his motions still rigid, he extended a hand towards James. "Please, let me introduce myself. My name is Draco, sir. Draco Malfoy. It's very good to meet you."
McGonagall didn't even try to hide her satisfaction this time. "That she would. I'm glad we're on the same page."
How Gertrude had swept him into her clutches at all was a situation that Harry still wasn't quite sure he knew the nature of. In one moment, he'd been deliberately withdrawing from her and the offer she'd presented, but in the next, it was as though the world had been tipped on its head. He was joining her in her car. He was travelling alongside her to an unremarkable building in upper-middle class London that she only called
"So," he said, brushing off the thought. "Group work. Collaboration. Because everyone knows that working in groups is the best idea any teacher has ever come up with."
Draco's fault. Because Draco was the one that provoked it.
A handful of idlers, of tourists wandered in off the street, were scattered about the foyer, conversing in muttered exchanges befitting the grandiose ambiance. A stunted line snaked to an ornate little window in one wall, the calligraphic word'tickets' painted overhead on a gold-plated board reminiscent of a booth at a carnival. The young woman at the counter murmured in a humming tone that similarly fit the atmosphere of the room as much as her heavy, dark makeup and puffy hair did.
"It wouldn't have killed you to miss the news once in a while," Ron said with a heartfelt sigh.
"You're free."
When the elevator pinged and the doors slid smoothly open, Draco all but elbowed his fellow passengers out of the way to climb out. Huffing to himself, he absently straightened his shirt, swept a hand down his buttoned vest, and adjusted his tie before striding down the stupidly narrow hallways in the direction of studio eleven.
"Shut up, Zabini," Parkinson said, and the sound of a thud gave Harry the startling impression that she'd kicked him under the table. Zabini's shit-eating grin, a little tamer than those he might have once worn but sincere nonetheless, only added to the impression.
purchase the wand that Draco had offered to outfit him with what felt like so long ago was unnerving, though more because Harry's entire family, uncles included, saw it as an opportunity to educate him on a part of the Wizarding world he'd already seen.
"I didn't say I'd take you up on your offer if it really was one, Ron."
"And me."
"It's not a hangover," Von said through a yawn.
"But I'm –"
Alone with his thoughts, Draco couldn't help but wonder. Why was it, exactly, that he'd suddenly decided to care so much?
Or, perhaps the worst of the lot, "Were you talking to Weasley earlier? Why on earth would you interact with such a distasteful person? The lower rungs of society, as it were."
Smitten. Yes, Harry decided Ron was a little bit smitten. It was at least half the reason Harry sought out solitary study.
Draco blinked. For a moment, he was duly grateful that he was already leaning against the doorframe for support. He almost couldn't believe his ears, and Dimitri's words took a moment to properly make sense.
Of all the people in the world, Harry wasn't someone that Draco would have ever considered to be a model. Not even close. It wasn't because of how he looked, but how he held himself. How he walked. His confidence in all the wrong areas, his disregard for frivolities and even greater disregard for actually looking presentable.
"I finished early. Called in a favour to get the job done a bit faster, which was all but impossible, but – I guess you can say I missed home? Berlin's not quite like London, you know."
part all that much, and the Wizarding world had been nothing but blatantly accepting of such skews from the Muggle norm, but… but to admit it…
"Probably a metaphor," Harry said.
As it turned out, Draco Malfoy had never been to McDonalds before.
"Magic?" she repeated, her voice a little louder. "You talk about
Or, more correctly, he didn't like most people. Generally, his dislike arose from the fact that they didn't like him first. Witches and wizards seemed to smell his Malfoy heritage upon any encounter, lips curling and noses wrinkling before they more often than not spat in disgust, or loathing, or the shadow of prolonged grief that had no other target. He'd been a Death Eater, and no amount of concealment charms over the Dark Mark on his forearm could erase the darkness of his past.
Harry stared at him. For a moment, he wasn't entirely sure he wasn't seeing things. But no, it was definitely Draco standing before him, staring at him with such keen-eyed attentiveness that it was impossible to look away from him. How he'd gotten there, Harry didn't know. It wasn't possible; Harry had been tearing at breakneck speed across the school and had apparently all but flown over a fence, regardless of if he could remember that flight. There was no way Draco could be standing there before him.
Harry glanced back towards her. He frowned. Her face had paled, and Ron's had grown so wan himself that his freckles stood out in stark relief. It wasn't a good look for him, even if Harry had found him attractive in the first place. "What?"
Smirking at Jackie's words – he couldn't help but wonder what Draco would think of being called such a thing – Harry shrugged. Why was he so invested in the presentation for that year? And the presentation specifically, not the entirety of C&C. After all, the project they'd been assigned to share with the Hogwarts students was far from being the only work they had on their agendas. It just happened to be the most interesting.
Almost against his will, Harry glanced back towards the Little Head Table. His gaze drew unerringly towards Malfoy's white-blond head, caught for a moment, then detached as he shook his own head. The ex-Slytherins were a little confusing, to say the least, with not a single one of them so much as raising their hackles at a passing comment that would have once started a fight. Granted, few muttered such imprecations and accusations even under their breaths anymore, with almost unanimous consensus holding fast to group support and a recovery mentality even for those once excluded, but even so. It was a little unexpected. More than a little.
Harry drew himself upright in his seat so that he both extracted his legs from Hermione's weight and sat nearly straight. He tucked his magazine into the cushion behind him. "Visiting for dinner?"
, glaringly obvious at the front of the stand but likely magically hidden from wandering Muggle eyes. It was a little hard not to notice when his own face was staring back at him; after seeing little enough of his published pictures of late, the picture was a shock in itself. That there was an actual article of him…
He should take a picture –
Had Harry not been frozen before, he would have stilled into the semblance of a statue. As it was, he found himself almost unable to breathe. He wanted to dart a glance towards the crewman, towards one of the directors, one of his managers, who could surely diffuse the unexpected confrontation with a woman who seemed nothing if not a shark on the prowl, trailing a bloody scent. But he couldn't. He couldn't look away from Gertrude's dark, intelligent eyes.
"A ballpark would be good enough. Just a vague direction so we can work out it we need to do a Lunar Analysis for the higher-grade potions and have to time it, or…"
Sighing, Harry's shoulders slumped. "It's not like I actually wanted to hide anything from you. It just happened."
Harry cradled the mug in his hands. It nearly burned his skin, but not in a bad way. The coils of steam curled gently into the air of the dimly lit living room, the tea as of yet untasted, but Harry didn't mind. Simply holding the warmth felt good, in a way, even if it also felt a little painful. He was colder than he'd realised, though the weight of the faux minx blanket around his shoulders, the Warming Charm that he could feel working its magic, eased it a little bit.
Still in Jill's unwavering hold, Harry reached for and tugged Jackie into an embrace of her own. She wasn't one for sentimental hugs, but he knew she appreciated them when she truly needed them. Given the speed her arms latched around him in return, Harry knew it was one of those moments.
A tickle of warmth. The brush of contact, reminiscent of when Hermione attempted her awkward affection, or Ron clapped him on the shoulder, but not quite. Not the same, because Harry froze but didn't feel the instant, flinching instinct to retreat. To pull away, because it was probably an accident, that contact, and it hadn't been meant to happen. And if it hadn't been intentional, then that meant that it was unwanted. And if it was unwanted, then it was unsavoury, and whoever touched, however accidentally, might be angered, or upset, or –
"Why, thank you."
"I'm leaving," Harry said overloudly.
Harry's head throbbed. His forearm ached. His knees wobbled, knocking against one another with every step. He nearly tripped over his own toes as his feet dragged across the ground, but –
"Hi, Professor," he said by way of greeting.
Harry blinked. Or worse. The string of thoughts, continuing without him, rung loud and clear, and he hadn't ever heard them before. Not in such fluency and lucidity. Yet, despite that, it felt familiar.
Ron and Ginny's arguing wasn't unfamiliar. If anything, that they stepped into Harry's flat in the throes of one such argument was typical of them these days. Harry didn't spare them a glance as they continued with their verbal battle.
"They're not listening," Harry said, though he lowered his voice further. "I was wondering, though, if you were maybe free this afternoon?"
"There has to be a reason," Draco said. "There must be. With you, and who you are, who your family is – there must have been some reason."
"Tell him?"
Besides that, Harry had felt the direct effects. Like when Draco had 'healed' the graze he'd unwittingly acquired in his flight from Jacob and his friends. Like the Warming Charm that had driven away the chill of winter crawling into Harry's bones when they'd lost track of time one evening walking through the local park. Or the loose thread he'd fixed on Harry's jumper, or the stain he'd removed from his trainers, or the fogging-repelling charm he'd affixed to Harry's glasses.
"Come on, he kind of is."
So he did know. Harry wasn't even faintly surprised. "Where'd he go?"
He did see when the body when flying past him, however. He saw it soar through the air as though kicked by a pegasus.
"Why do you do that, by the way?" he asked. "You must have heaps by now, and they're surely not particularly appealing. Most of them I'm not even properly posing for."
"Fixin' my hair."
he growled to himself. Then he set his jaw.
"He's just asleep, James," Lily said. Tears burned in her eyes, blurring her vision, and frantic blinks couldn't disperse them. Her fingers clawed around Harry's swaddling, desperate, pleading, and she couldn't look away from her baby. "He's just – he's just asleep, isn't he, James? He's just…"
The voice came from his shoulder. That was all Draco registered. From his periphery, he got the barest impression of the man who had approached him – broad, square chinned, with a dark shirt that seemed to drink what little light struck him from the dancing strobes – but disregarded him instantly. With barely a shake of his head, Draco started down the short flight of stairs from the entrance into the club proper.
"Which you shouldn't have done."
A/N: Thank you to the lovely people keeping up with this story. I hope you enjoyed the chapter. Please let me know what you think if you get the chance. I'd absolutely love to hear from you! And, as always, thank you to the lovely Krakhot for your comments; you are an absolute wonder in your support xx
There was definite approval in Clementine's smile this time, and that, alongside her entire lack of disagreement, condescension, or hatred that so often splashed across the faces of those who had employed Draco in the past, left a tightness in his chest to the point that he had to swallow thickly to attempt to rid himself of it.
He could just make out the words through the hollow
"Too stupid?" Jackie ground out as though the words hurt her to speak.
"Don't apologise. You haven't done anything wrong."
Malfoy's words were quiet, expressionless, and Harry couldn't get any more of a read on him for it than he could from his blank face. Not even when Malfoy took a step forwards, sweeping silently across the short grass towards Harry and his fountain with its buck-naked statue.
He couldn't help but smile, if a little bashfully. It was one thing to be noticed by people in England, both Wizarding and Muggle, but in Switzerland? Admittedly, Harry knew his share of models from abroad, from Helena Christensen to Jason Lewis, but then who didn't? To think that he might be known in such a way… He wasn't sure whether being recognised for modelling or for the war was better. Or worse, as it may be.
Swallowing a sigh that was only half genuine, Draco glanced over his shoulder once more. Harry had lowered his phone from his ear, pressing the speaker to his chest, and regarded Draco with his head tipped and expression open and questioning. With his long hair half falling from its tie, his glasses on, the neck of his baggy t-shirt pulled to the side, he looked incredibly young. Even more nostalgic still for the accidental parting of his fringe around his scar, left unveiled and open as he'd taken to doing more and more often of late.
This was Draco's Harry. His Harry that the world didn't see, with his messy hair and glasses, his scar showing and his oversized clothes that somehow actually looked good on him, his cheeks still a little flushed from sleep despite rising nearly an hour before. Draco's Harry wasn't as sleek and groomed as a model, but he was perfect in every other way. Definitely perfect enough for Draco's lens. His fingers itched to reach for his camera.
"Of course not. I'm hardly the kind of person to request the attendance of a worker that I know nothing of."
It wasn't an easy climb. The winter snow hadn't quite lifted, and with evening all but fallen and bringing the rapid chill with it, the barely-melted frost on the front lawn was already beginning to reharden. The bricks that Harry shimmied down were painfully frozen, all but burning his hands, and he landed with a heavy thud and a hoarse puff of fog on the ground.
Harry watched and couldn't quite bring himself to look away. Draco was… different, yes. Very different to the person he'd known from their school days, but it was made only more apparent when out of a working context. More than acting different, however, he felt different. Harry felt it in how he watched Draco and struggled to swallow down the lump that grew in his throat when the hint of a satisfied smile touched Draco's lips, or when he absently flicked escaped tendrils of his fringe behind his ear.
He'd expected it. Draco had expected the hatred that was to come with being Harry Potter's photographer. He knew Pansy had, too, and knew she also accepted the backlash in the face of what was offered to act as a counter-weight. That weight was notoriety.
"Both of you, mouthy cameraman and Pretty Face, can leave the room if you would be quiet," Pansy said pleasantly. She smiled at Harry. "What do you think?"
No sleep tonight. Definitely not.
The man regarded him. He didn't move. His cowled head was cocked, as though contemplating the fragility of the child before him. And then his hand twitched and the wand rose just a little higher.
"You don't feel as though you have no direction? As though you don't know what to do with yourself at the end of it all?"
Ron didn't get a chance to answer before she was upon him. Harry only just leant out of their way in time for Ginny to attack him, and the studio was abruptly echoing with Ron's bellows of "stop!", Ginny's maddened cackles, and Hermione's snickers that she couldn't quite hide behind a raised hand.
"We don't –"
Harry silently agreed, and Jill's lack of protest was telling enough. They didn't speak of it further, however. It wasn't worth the effort, not when there were more interesting things to consider.
Harry didn't know, and he hadn't asked Draco at the time. He wasn't about to then either as Draco led the way from the Apparition room through a door and down a short flight of stairs. Spilling out onto a sedate room cast in a post-lunch lethargy, it looked like any other pub with its smattering of diners prodding at their meals and sipping from mugs.
"Not just mine," Harry said, though it wasn't entirely true. Von had been culling other jobs and offers increasingly over the years. He was in Harry's company exclusively these days, and spent most of his time with Harry himself. "But even if he wasn't, I think he's too competitive not to care."
"Or you don't think highly enough." Harry took a step backwards, his fingers dropping from Draco's shoulder, and Draco tried not to regret his slight retreat either. "She must think something of you since she called you out specifically. Where's that pig-headed confidence I used to hate you for so much?"
"Draco."
A touch of renewed warmth rose in Harry's cheeks, and he switched his glance towards Parkinson across from him, to Zabini at his other side. Zabini gave a small smirk. "Don't worry," he said. "We already knew about it."
Harry gave a mental shake of his head. Pansy was definitely a bitch. And Draco was definitely hot, but clearly also both a bitch and out of Harry's league. Harry knew when to smother his pining. He'd had more than one experience with stamping out crushes that had turned out less than ideal when he'd acted upon them. Rumours didn't always start from nothing. Sometimes they were the twisted adaptations of truths.
The cosy lunchroom air seemed to chill. Draco's words seemed to switch off every heat source in the room. Jacob snapped his gaze towards him, Keith and Bruce a moment later, and even Harry couldn't help but glance up at him. Draco didn't return his stare. His smooth face, narrowed eyes and thinned lips, was turned upon Harry's classmates and could have rivalled a marble statue's for how hard it seemed.
Harry fought the hunching of his shoulders. There was nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing at all. "Yeah."
"Exactly my response," Draco said, the top foot of his crossed legs shifting slightly to poke Harry in the knee. "See? I'm not alone in my scepticism."
"Our compulsory course," Pansy said. "Obviously."
"How do you know who Draco is? And about his family, and the war."
They splayed across the table. He knew he should pack them away, should stow them for when he would inevitably return from his trip, but Draco had been staring at them for over an hour and couldn't draw himself away. His Portkey was set to leave that afternoon, and he anticipated hype at the terminal simply for being there – but he couldn't turn away from the images. He'd already pushed back his departure unnecessarily once – but he almost couldn't bring himself to leave.
"Of a sort," Pansy replied. "Though I find myself swayed by suggestion, as it were."
was one of the first Muggle-Wizard collaboration companies to step into the modern media industry. There had been others, smaller and less successful, but this was different. This was bigger. This was impressive.
Picard nodded curtly. "Nonetheless, it's appreciated. This situation…
When he considered it, properly thinking about it, Harry supposed he might. He might like to, even if it felt a little wrong. Wrong to leave, to all but abandon the Wizarding world and his responsibility to it, to disappear and inevitably cause upheaval just as the few times he'd had to lie low in the past years had proved always happened.
When they stopped, it was sooner than Draco expected. He wavered on his hands and knees, blinking aside the blurriness clouding his vision, the continued ringing in his head, and swallowing convulsively in a struggle to suppress the urge to vomit. His gut roiled. His fingers stung from where a foot had stomped downwards upon them, grinding them into the ground. His chin felt all but out of dislocated, and the warmth dribbling from his nose stood as testament to the knee he'd taken to his face. Draco heard voices, but in his dizziness he could only cling to the ground to keep himself from falling further. Attempting to discern what they said was beyond him.
The shop attendant barely seemed to hear him. His finger switched back to Harry, his eyes drawn alongside it. "You – you up and disappeared," he said. "You just vanished, just like that, and no one knew –"
"When did I ever give any indication that I didn't want to hang out with you?"
Draco didn't question it anymore. After barely a handful of weeks, he'd learnt to take what Harry gave him without comment. Or at least when he did say something, it was as trivial as asking if Harry had made the heinous mistake of thinking eggs belonged in a sandwich.
Harry all but ignored Draco and Pansy regarding them from behind the two empty chairs. Or at least he did until Jackie turned towards them and waved a hand grandly. "Sit, Your Majesties. Your whole looming act isn't impressing anyone."
The sentence was a jumbled mess, funny to Harry's ears until it made sense, and then it was just unexpectedly relieving. "Oh. Um. Thanks." He wasn't sure about finding his feet, especially seeing as he wasn't even sure where his hands were anymore. "Are you drunk too? I think it would be good if you were. I think – yeah, I think that would be good."
and could be
Hermione shrugged. "More that it hasn't changed. They still won't abide by supposed 'choice', you know?" She sighed. "You know, Harry, I don't envy your situation or anything, but it would almost be nice not to have to…"
"Delving into the Muggle pool of unlikely potentials."
Harry couldn't help himself, though. Not when it came to Jill. Neither could Jackie.
To the infuriating performance of Kurt, Jacob, and Leonard muttering amongst themselves and shooting derisive scowls towards them, Jill stepped between Harry and Jackie. She linked their arms together, and without a word all but dragged them towards Abel's seat. She didn't look back and the comfortable smile that naturally regrew on her face was enough for Harry to similarly ignore the slight.
"It is." Draco took himself towards the sink and absently turned the tap on, wedging his phone between his shoulder ad his ear. "What do you want?"
Pansy jerked back from him slightly, and Draco scowled, firmly wrapping a mental shroud around his anger in an attempt to smother it. His efforts didn't really work, and Pansy likely noticed for the calmness of her following words.
He didn't really need to find Ron. He wasn't hungry, either. And yet, after a moment of slow-minded contemplation, Harry was hauling himself to his feet in search of his friend. Only to pause momentarily as the room seemed to flip upside down.
Ginny fawned over him like a lovable sister in a way that made him infinitely happy that they'd never actually consummated their relationship. If anything, since he'd come out they seemed to have grown only closer, if in a different way. Closer – but they were still markedly different.
Dot was still rail-thin. She still wore her hair in its topknot, severely tight. Her rectangular glasses, the high neck of her modest dress, the short, filed lines of her fingernails – it was all the same. Even the way she glanced towards the door with a frown already forming at the interruption to her phone conversation was so typically Dot.
"Not hardly."
The bass boomed behind Draco as Harry was pinned against the wall. The shouts, the echoes, the bellows of laughter dribbled into his ears as the fucking spikey-haired prat latched his lips onto Harry's neck. As he pressed himself against Harry, his hips canting forwards and fingers tightening, and thrust with a solid slap.
"Very," Ron said with an emphatic stab of his fork.
Draco shook his hand with the same efficiency Dimitri had opened the door. "Pleasure," he murmured.
"I've noticed," Harry said after another moment, "that there appears to be a pretty distinct lack of pictures of you."
"Vernon. And Petunia. And my cousin, Dudley."
"Just not enough to take the class herself," Jackie said. She still looked a little glassy-eyed but had managed to look away from Pansy for a few seconds to assess Blaise. "She's helping Abel out. He's hopeless without her."
Harry shrugged. "To be honest, I don't even know myself. Just that – I dunno, I don't really feel ready for that just yet. It seems to big, like stepping over a line into a place that I can't come back from." A beat of silence passed between them, and he murmured a guilty "sorry," into Draco's shoulder.
, he thought to himself, and ignored that his urge to laugh had just the slightest hysterical edge to it.
"Yes."
was about as gentle as they came. It held nothing on the '
"You told Hermione?" Harry couldn't help but wince.
Pursing his lips once more, Harry lowered his fork to the table. He'd had barely a mouthful, but the thought of eating more clenched his already tightened belly. Modelling was a career he'd pursued and being a model was what he'd become. Harry was proud of that in a way he hadn't thought was possible. And yet, in the face of explaining it all, of turning aside from a life as an Auror where he was fighting, and defending, and standing up for the minority and the victimised…
Years later, and Draco was still caught. As soon as Potter turned his brief glance from Pansy onto him, Draco was captured.
Harry was halfway through answering Ron's text when the cry reached him. Pausing mid-step, he glanced down the footpath he was headed and through the thin foot traffic to its source. A man. And a woman. And maybe a handful of other men and women, headed straight for him with steps so fast they were nearly running.
"I don't really want anything," Harry called after her. Then he turned his attention back towards Ron. "Hey, mate. How've you been?"
"They're not –"
"You can't be serious," Harry said, glancing between Lily and James where they sat on the carriage, peering through the doorway at him with all the nervousness of the overprotective parents they were.
Skirting the table, Harry sidled past his mother to stick his head into the pantry. His riffling was distraction enough for Lily to drop her plate onto the counter and turn towards him.
"That's a narrow-minded way of looking at it," Draco muttered.
Taking a step towards Draco, Harry planted himself so they were nearly nose to nose. Or nose to chin, because Draco was decidedly taller than Harry and he decided he hated that fact.
"I know."
He'd unwittingly made it his mission. Unfortunately, Pansy knew that.
"Live a little, Harry," Jackie had continued. "I dare you to take up the challenge. Go on, do it. You might find a wizard master you can apprentice to or something."

"Shy, or just a blank slate?"
Different and better.
"Blimey," Ron said again as soon as they were shunted from the dressing rooms. "You do that every day, Harry? You actually – you mean you actually –?"
Harry thought blankly.
"Pathetic, that you need to be protected by a girl, Evans," Bruce said with a snicker.
Something in Harry's chest squeezed. He swallowed thickly. When Jackie called again, followed by a similar demand from Blaise, he barely heard them. Standing beside Draco, meeting him eye to eye, it was as though any semblance of hesitancy had been stripped from him and torn to shreds.
When Draco's face appeared almost immediately, the relief that washed over Harry almost overwhelmed his anger. He grasped the mirror with both hands and sunk his teeth into his lip to stop it from trembling. Draco looked no less pale than he had been when Harry last saw him, but at least the horror was alleviated. He looked just a little more like himself, and Harry needed that right now.
It was one of the most awkward interviews he'd ever had, and that was including the many 'talks' on utterly embarrassing subjects with his parents. It wasn't only because he had to cut and paste around the many instances of magic. Not only that Harry found the questions sickening, turning his gut, or that he couldn't help but cringe as he described the room, described how he'd gotten the cut now wrapped beneath bandages. It was more than that.
"Yeah, good." Glancing to the professor's side, Harry spared a smile for where Hermione stood, turning from a discussion she appeared to be having with a handful of her friends. With another nod for the professor, he stepped aside to allow her to pass.
But what was truly captivating to watch was Draco.
Draco didn't have much interest in photography. Not really. But being in the midst of what lay behind the images in magazines and still-frames, the election of the perfect model in a refined selection process, certainly piqued his interest.
"I've got to take this," he said, stepping around Draco and making for the door. "I'll see you later, Draco. If you're interested, I've heard the coffee's better at the place across the road than down on the ground floor."
"Thanks," was all he murmured.
Draco bit back another snort A mistake? Unlikely. "I'm sure. You're paying tonight."

"Is it, though?" Harry wondered aloud, and Ron's glance towards him, wide-eyed but also a little considering, and Hermione's small smile, was nothing if not validating. Was it so hard? Was it so… impossible?
"With no strings attached?"
"I want to put out there the real story of Tom Riddle and how he got to be who he was. It was a problem, a real problem of both the Wizarding world and the Muggle one, that a kid was mistreated and grew into something that was barely human because of neglect, and misjudgement, and sometimes outright cruelty. I'm not saying that's the only reason he did what he did, but it was a big part of it."
"Oh. Yes, that."
"It's not –"
"Yes, it's –" Harry paused, pursed his lips, then tucked his face back into Draco's shoulder. "It's not quite the same."
"Can we please talk about something else?" Harry asked. "This is bad dinner conversation."
That was it. The briefest question, the barest consideration, and the last of Harry's walls crumbled. It was safe in his home, in his room, and he had everything he wanted at that moment right before him.
"I was thinking of going to the library," Harry said. "I've got to do some reading for Transfiguration."
Draco nearly flinched as he was tugged from his silent staring. Folding his arms slowly, as much to give time to gather himself, he raised an eyebrow that Harry likely didn't see. "Are you gussying up?"
"It would never work," Harry found himself saying.
Conversation at the table immediately died. Jackie glanced up sharply, hair all but standing on end as her hackles visibly rose, and Pansy's hooded regard wasn't much different. Blaise slowed in his chewing, Vince and Greg glanced up from their meals, and even Theodore seemed to gather himself from his persistent nonchalance to turn their way.
"Because of the people my parents worked with, yes."
"It's popular," Draco replied smoothly. "I would be foolish to not be interested in it, especially with how rapidly its growing. I'm not so satisfied in my position here that I'd not grasp any employment opportunity at
"A favourite? God, I don't think so. There were so many places, and all of them incredible for different reasons."
"Huh."
Draco grunted.
"Yeah, I feel that. I'm not a morning person either."
"How do you do it?" Pansy asked.
Harry pulled a face. Friendly?
A strangled whimper spilled from Harry's mouth before he could stop himself. If he could stop himself. If he'd wanted to. He didn't know if he could, couldn't think, and could only stare down at Draco with blurring eyes. His wavering hand unerringly reached for Draco's head, his legs trembled, and the thick, heavy waves of pleasure radiating from his groin with every slide of Draco's tongue, every stroke of his lips, his hand, was almost too much to bear. It was all Harry could do to withhold the urge to buck his hips, chasing the pleasure, and force himself to suffer the ecstasy of Draco's ministrations.
At that, Draco's expression shifted. He didn't smile, and the solemnity didn't leave him, but it retreated just a little. "I am. Thank you."
, Harry thought. The idea was dampening, but it was true. Utterly, completely true.
"Don't ignore me, you prat."
"How did you make me do that?" Jackie had all but shouted after he'd coaxed her into attempting the 'floating arm' trick.
"Please, just call me Harry."
"She says she has to be, you know." Harry paused alongside the door that had been allocated for him as Von jimmied the lock and led the way inside. "Apparently it's a cutthroat business."
"Is that the problem, then?"
"Bullshit. You've just had to accept it because you can't –"
"Draco?"
Harry shook his head again.
Pansy seemed not in the least deterred by his blatant hostility. She propped an elbow onto the arm of her chair, her chin resting in her cupped hand. "Oh, I doubt that. Surely you've heard the stories of him. I've not doubt you've even deliberately sought them out."
"Thanks," Harry said, and Von only nodded in acknowledgement of his gratitude. He crossed the small room and, without pause to flick through the articles of clothing, drew a shirt and jeans from the rack just alongside the vanity. He held them towards Harry with an indicative tilt of his head.
"People like me?"
a clipped, female voice replied
"I know."
Even so, Harry wasn't sure how he felt about it. Shame and regret welled within him once more at the very thought, and he sunk a little further into his chair in a fruitless effort to escape from it. He didn't know what Draco had been doing at
"Do you think we could ask to be transferred back to the Basement?" Susan said, and though Harry saw a smile touch her lips, it was nowhere near as vibrant as those he'd seen her wear in the past.
Harry stared at her, at a momentary loss. Rocking between her feet, tweaking the end of her braid and regarding him with such open honesty that Harry couldn't begin to think she was teasing him, she was a wonder. Still, even when they'd broken up, he could appreciate that she was gorgeous, and genuine, and the kind of appealing that had as much to do with the personality she wore in every expression as her physical features. If Harry could do it again, they might very well have stayed together. He might have even wanted them to. But now –
"This is a brilliant plan. Don't tell me it's not."
Harry stared at him silently. The shame was still there, the regret as thick as ever, and the urge to apologise once more welled in the back of Harry's throat like a choking weight. But he didn't speak, and when Draco finally turned back towards him, it was a struggle to hold his gaze.
"They're all low-life bottom feeders anyway," she'd said more times than Harry had bothered to count. "Why would I care what they think of me? If anything, I'm flattered they dislike me. If they liked me, I'd be concerned about what aspect of my behaviour they found appealing."
, Draco thought, and he wanted to grab Harry by his chin and drag his face up to look him directly, to declare loudly and proudly and unwaveringly that it wasn't the same for him. That he knew Harry was attractive, but he'd known that for years. That he wasn't just a model, or the Saviour, but a person, and it was that person beneath it all that Draco found himself caring for so much more deeply than he'd let himself consider. Beneath the makeup and the charms that weren't love potions or spells as some models and actors used but something else – beneath all of that, Draco cared for
"Draco, could you just stop?" he asked, voice rising to chase after Draco's retreating back.
The debilitating feeling loss, the loss of something he'd never really had to begin with, had lasted only long enough for Harry to steady himself like a sailor balancing on the railing of a stormbound ship. Jumping off the edge to escape it all had momentarily felt so tempting, but he'd withheld. Instead, he'd reached for the thin, feeble rope that had been offered to him as his only lifeline. How long that rope would survive before snapping in half, he didn't know, but he'd take it. He'd take what Draco offered, give him what he asked for, because something was better than nothing – right?
"Will it help you?" Draco asked. "Will it make you feel any better?"
"It's really just sleight of hand," Harry said, holding the penny in his palm.
The wall had opened. A wall of fused, aged bricks the likes that Harry knew shouldn't budge so easily. But what lay beyond that opening was even more incredible.
Jacob gasped, spat, and barked an inarticulate cry. His hand loosened as he stumbled backwards. Like dominoes, Keith crashed into the wall as Jacob tripped into him, Bruce lurched out of the way, and then Leonard was falling head over arse as Harry shoulder-charged him.
Harry glanced back towards him to find Draco was slowing in step. He stared at Harry, his face fallen into unexpected blankness, but that stare held a weight and a thousand questions that Harry couldn't even begin to interpret.
"Yes, and I'm your sister," Ginny replied.
There was the picture reminiscent of wear and tear, of exhaustion and near defeat that he'd somehow pulled through, that Von had managed to encapsulate perfectly with more of his makeup artistry. The one that was supposed to be from the war but was more correctly a snapshot reminder of the aftermath of the night Harry had slept at Draco's flat. Even with the circumstances that had forced him there, Draco found himself thinking more of the night after the club than of Sammy-fucking-Ipetsky and what he'd seen. He didn't want to think of that, and looking at Harry, at the head shot of his profile and where he stared into the distance, it was easy enough to do.
Harry didn't know what that touch meant. Just as he didn't know what Draco meant in that he 'made it harder' for him. He didn't quite understand why Draco had spoken as he had, or laughed without humour the way he did, or why he proceeded to make up his own bed and gesture Harry into it before Transfiguring his couch into a pseudo mimic and climbing into it himself.
"Not a monster," Draco said. "Just doing what everyone else would."
Harry thought as he passed into the hollow depths of the library that resounded with echoes of silence,
"Is that everyone?"
"Excuse me?" the girl said.
"Of course," Gertrude said with another chuckle, stepping towards and sinking into the seat opposite Harry's. "But you're the guest, and an honoured one at that. You're the linchpin."
Lily laughed. "Alright, alright. I won't pry. Go and have fun with your friends."
Harry hummed again. "In a little bit. I'll see you up there."
"You should ask Jill," Jackie was saying, licking her fingers clean. "She'll get Abel to find them for you. Or for her, more specifically."
It was just in time to see Draco's eyes rolled to the ceiling, his lips murmuring inaudibly as though in a plea to the heavens, before he dropped his attention back to the camera before him. Behind him, the two crewmen were muttering between themselves, shaking their heads slightly, but Harry barely noticed them. Not when Draco flickered his gaze up to meet his own and just slightly raised an eyebrow.
"… time do you finish up today?" Ipetsky was saying, his hand rising to rest comfortably on Harry's shoulder heavily enough to jostle him.
him. There was surely nothing more wondrous than that. Draco sunk into everything that Harry offered and would have been content to never untangle himself again.
Harry nodded.
"Jackie, the directions are on the packet," Harry attempted to explain once more, glancing up from the doodles in the margin of his page.
Su, eyes heavy.
Sweeping across a wide, yawning bridge that Jackie claimed 'rocked when that bloody bus crossed, I kid you not', Harry pulled up at what must have been the hundredth traffic light since they'd entered the city proper. He glanced over his shoulder to Jill. "How far have we got?"
Hermione, too. They'd always been leagues apart in personality, with Hermione headstrong and verbally explosive when it came to her opinions and embodying that even more completely as she dove onto the political scene. It didn't matter that they shared a commonality in their realised sexualities; they were too different for there to be much other common ground between them, and with her not-quite-hidden ambivalence for the modelling industry in spite of her open support of Harry…
For that matter, Harry didn't seem to care all that much either. Poking himself absently in the cheek, still frowning, he didn't quite turn to Draco when he spoke. "Can I help you with something?"
Only when he hooked it around Harry's waist instead.
He still wasn't scowling, still wasn't sneering, and Harry supposed that was a good thing. It certainly made it easier to continue with the tentative hope that Draco wouldn't take his words too personally. "I've never really had much time for people like you," he said.
Harry was good at Defence magic but he discovered that he didn't like to do it so much anymore.
"And risk being eaten by that bear you call a dog?' Jackie grinned despite his words. It was no secret she was at least as smitten with PJ as he was with her. "Nah, I'm gonna head home, then. I have a date with procrastination."
Only the distant hum of the occasional passing car accompanied Harry's jog towards the bus stop. He was definitely running late, but turning the corner at the end of the road, could he really be blamed for stopping at the fence of number eleven? The lumbering labrador, tail thumping in greeting as it did every morning, was a greeting Harry couldn't bypass, even at the risk of missing the bus entirely.
"Luna's playing quidditch?" Harry asked.
"Which you won't," Harry said, propping an elbow onto the arm of his hair and resting his cheek in his hand his hand. He smiled. "I've heard you're pretty good."
