“I choose Molly.” Molly looked up from her place on the floor her hand paused in drawing the circle.
“Should be, the goblins said they would connect it back up with the system when I got my family rings.”
The next hour or two was spent with him and Neville talking about the different plants in their garden, the different amounts of care and the mis-adventures with weeding and de-knoming.
“Get up, boy!” She hissed through the door, she dared not to wake up her precious duddykins.
Sidra bopped her head up and down,
“I highly doubt it.”
Sirius, as snuffles, nudged at Harry’s hand and he smiled down at Sirius and knelt onto the pavement.
His heart ached in the best way possible.
on that wall to reinforce all that damage is fucking insane.” He lamented, but it wasn’t very loud. It was depressed and resigned.
She hissed as Harry walked closer to take in the contents ontop of the desk and sure enough there was a wand, it was almost as long as Harry’s holly wand but it looked more elegant, it had a handle that looked carved specifically to hold and at the based appeared to be a stone embedded in the base of the handle. Sidra crawled off of harry and onto the desk circled the wand, flicking her tongue.
“Dobby?” Harry asks aloud to the room, and with a soft crack there was the elf in his mitch matched socks.
my fault so they kicked me out. I found a safe place to stay.”
Harry’s face heated and he reached up and touched his lightning bolt scar. “Untreated?”
Harry hummed and gathered up the wand. And headed for the main room of the house. A table should be safe if it goes wrong, right? Harry hummed rolling the wand back and forth in his hand.
“That means the wards accepted you in not as a guest, but as family.”
It screeched again and was pushed back again. The pursuit didn’t stop until the dementor was running with the stag closely behind.
“Yes, in ancient times, the Potter family were Lords over many farms. There are three to signify the unity with their land. If you also notice the lion is not centered. They valued themselves to be a family of the people.”
“Gaunt and Potter.” He said into the space and a ring and keys popped into existence on the bottom portion of the new hole in the water.
Aunt Petunia was already finishing up making pancake mix and the eggs were already out as was the bacon so Harry grabbed a pan and started cooking. It was a familiar habit and routine that was easy enough to zone out in. He would like cooking more if not for the fact that he never got to enjoy what he made.
“Oh right uh, what’s his kid’s name? He’s the dad of uh- Nick, Niel-“
And here we have the next chapter! This one is a real doozy that I had fun crafting.
Whatever good mood he had evaporated, “
Neville cackled, “I would’ve loved to see that!”
But all that came out was a wet huff of air. He nodded instead and tried to force himself large calming breaths focusing on her twinkling scale and breathing body. She settled herself on his lap after Harry untangled the sheets from his legs and straightened them out.
“Watch it, Potter.” He warned.
“Merlin’s tits! What the bloody hell happened?” She asked squeezing her nose shut and branished her wand with a choked cleaning spell.
know why this place doesn’t have the fidelius on it anymore.”
That was a good point.
Harry chuckled, “
Sirius rose his eyebrows and looked Harry up and down and his head tilted with his eyebrows raised like he was actually seeing
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded and took a little longer to eat his breakfast. His things were already downstairs so there was nothing to fuss over anyway.
“What kinds of creature are these? Are they cousins to the pegasus?” Harry asked walking to the front of the carriage to look at one of these creatures a little better.
The snake finished after what felt like an hour. During that time harry had practiced a couple of other spells. Levitating a branch, making his palm glow with a Lumos. It was like having a part of himself back that had been locked away for too long.
Sidra asked relaxing and crawling up Harry’s arm.
The eye's glimmeres with the yellow light of the spell and it reset it jaw with a wide yawn.
He forced himself out of bed and shuffled his way to the kitchen. He grabbed a slice of bread, poured some orange juice, and through the power of wheat and calories he tried to make himself less tired. He didn’t have time to lay around all day and wait for the sensation to pass.  He had to feed his chickens, pick whatever mystery fruits that had grown last night.
Sirius grinned, “Can’t wait to hear them!”
The goblin looked him over and looked slightly interested, “And do you have a particular family in mind you are wishing to confirm? Because you are mister Harry Potter, no? Have you lost…access to your vaults?”
“Horribly.” Harry grumbled, “I woke up from a nightmare with a blinding migraine.”
one specifically.
But they didn’t come back.
“Because the emergency spells were never activated. However, Gringotts is certain the ring is on a black property.”
Leana Gaunt Potter
“Your shirt is nearly falling off of you, Harry.”
The days past by a little more peacefully with Sidra, a person to speak quietly with when he woke from having nightmares. Someone to vent too when he was allowed out of the house. He practiced the moon-magic thing but it was getting harder to feel the magic at his fingertips.
“This is it.” Mrs. Weasley said and took a deep breath, she looked around for other muggles watching or possibly snooping magical folk but found none. (thanks to Harry’s spell of course.)
Harry chuckles, “I’ll have to check in with Neville and see if his dad remembers. Hey- maybe if his dad is like, not a ministry crony we could arrange for you two to meet-“
Harry got closer and like an automatic door the snake neck moved when he got within a closer distance.
There was a soft hissing in front of Harry and something just…
Harry was going to say something more, but Hermione gasped, starring at her watch, “Oh no! We’re almost late to getting to the Prefect meeting! Sorry Harry, I wish we could talk more but-“
the first time he was hugging his god father before going to school.
“I’ll send an owl every week. Promise me you’ll do the same, yeah?”
Sidra suggested and Harry hummed, but it was so hot he wasn’t sure he could concentrate.
Two wands who accepted him and one of them wasn’t attached to a homicidal maniac! Instead it was attached to someone Sidra cared about deeply. And they were in his house. A house that…had let him in because his magic tasted like ‘founders magic’.
From the front doorway, there was a
Harry shifted on the bed, fingering his pocket, “But I know why.”
for the first time. “Sounds like a hell of a guy. But doesn’t he have children or something to give clothes to?”
Harry looked at the door for a couple of seconds before looking at the room in front on him. It wasn’t a very large room. It had even tan tiles lining the floor leading up to a short table and two chairs. One was large enough for Harry to sit in and the other was a much smaller chair, most likely goblin size. Both are made from brown worn cloth but they didn’t look uncomfortable so Harry took a seat.
Harry watched while a non-observant Ron prattles along discussing a chess game he had against Hermione like it was an epic battle to be heralded. Too bad Harry still didn’t understand a lick of chess to follow it without the board in front of him.
“Damn! What I would give to get away from this place.” Sirius professed, “I hate this place. It’s cramped, dark, and damp. So
He looked over the list. Bread meat and some apples he could eat for a few days no problem. But he didn’t know where Dobby might go to get food. He's only left dobby instructions to get other items like milk eggs, flour, and butter if and only if Harry had enough left in his money stash. It wasn’t frivolous but it would keep him from going hungry it would give Harry enough time to figure out how to get more money. His vault? A job? Maybe he should ask Dobby to buy him rice instead of bread...it was looking more and more like he was going to have to go to Gringotts sooner rather than later...but he didn't have his
Harry chuckled,
I am going to-“
money! He has lots to spare!”
The next few days were quite peaceful. He told Sirius about the Chicken’s routine and talking with Adafrid about the house, or listening to him and Sidra reminisce on some old memories they had.
“Yeah, found her in this little nook in Surrey. She was hunting for mice and it uh, had been a long time since she had been around a wizard. Let alone a partsle tongue.
He took a closer look and was met with the familiar sight of a cherub holding a snake etched onto a silver pendant. It’s magic pusled for a moment before calming down and settling into a small hum. It was about the size of a galleon and was attached to an equally silver chain.
He grinned to himself and went shopping.
“Huh, alright, but let’s give it a test first.”
Neither Ron nor Hermione had responded to any of his letters. So, sending any more wouldn’t be worth it. Not that he had Hedwig anyway.
The snake slithered even closer and lifted the front of her body to look closer at Harry.
Sidra bobbed her head sadly and placed her head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry smiled at her, and gently pet her. “
rather, a vehicle to give her better transportation and once she had situated herself onto Harry’s shoulders she moved her head into view of his face and looked him squarely in the eye.
he was reading whatever was there.
“According to Adafrid, you’ll have to register your magic at the wards.”
Sidra asked and Harry tried to get a lung full of air to tell her he was okay but he couldn’t get enough air in his lungs to assure her.
“It means that an orphan has the right to know where he comes from. Goblin kind never leaves one another on the street penniless if they can help it. It’s who they are.”
Harry made a heafty withdrawal and was now looking forward to having something other than eggs and jerky with different fruits to go with it. He could buy
Having good days was nice, and he had been having really nice days with Sidra around. But no matter how much magic you had or what friends you could confide in nightmares still came.
Harry had known about talking portraits but for some reason it felt more than a little unnerving knowing that the actual person of Adafrid was dead and this was some sort of magical reflection. He was currently in the house of a dead man. But weirder thing had happened hadn't it?
Harry hugged Sirius like his life depended on it and Sirius didn’t try to pull away. It was stupid and immature, but it
Neville, who wasn’t as enchanted, smiled politely at Harry, “She seems really taken with you.”
Jortook nodded, “Oh yes, quite a shame really. But when you’re raised with the idea that your boogeyman of the afterlife can possess any animal to sway your soul to damnation I can’t say I blame them.”
Wait. He
Harry snorted, “Mouldy butt?”

away from Neville’s stink plant.”
“Dobby?” Harry squeaked out, “What. What did you BUY?”
“Hello Dobby.” Harry greeted accepting the engulfing hug the excitable elf had wrapped around his legs. “I was wondering if you could do something for me?”
Get the floo dust, toss it in, say the name. If it lights up, Good! Nothing: Bad. He could do this. It wasn’t like he was being asked to walk
Okay, so it was probably a snake of some sort. The hiss was a higher pitch when translated in Harry's ear. It was very different from the lower tones of the snake from the zoo, and a much gentler hiss compared to the starving basilisk from the second year.
“Oi, you think you can talk to us like that Potter? Dudley here’s been the wrestling champ of Smelting’s two years running. I would watch your tone.”
Sidra pointed with her head and Harry nodded.
Harry nodded,
But he couldn’t afford to be angry. He rubbed at his face and his fingers itched along with his thighs.
Harry sighed when at least two minutes passed and she didn’t stop, and Harry rubbed his forehead and pulled out his rings, and he pressed them close to her eyes for her to see, startled she stopped her wailing and looked at the rings. She sniffed and wrinkled her nose.
Harry snorted, Sirius, tilts his head, “So what did this little viper want to do for stakes as the wizard's oath?”
Near some houses that were evicted for one reason or another and hadn’t been sold yet. He rifled through his trunk for his change bag that had his leftover wizarding money in it. He closed everything up when he had it. Harry took a deep breath and with his wand cast a Lumos swiping up. No muggle around to see this.
“Mrs. Figg?” He asked and she tottered forward her buckled flats clicking onto the pavement as she walked closer.
Harry tried to shout a warning this time but the Dementor had found its target and rushed forward, all 10 feet of it pushed Harry to the side and grabbed Dudley by the throat pinning him to the stone wall of the tunnel.
“It will be a minute before Hendret will arrive, please be patient. If you need to leave the premises quickly please knock on this door four-time succinctly and it will send for an attendant to escort you back out.”
Harry nodded, if only making bread out of grass was as simple as during a matchstick into a needle.
Adafrid nodded, “I am.”
“Alright then, see you tomorrow Hedwig.”
done. But it wasn't like he could send Hedwig or Sidra out to do it. And he couldn't just snap his fingers to summon food either.
Sidra was wrapped around his shoulders and Sirius was stretching. “I’m going to have to go through in my animagus form, but it shouldn’t look too odd. As long as your familiar stays hidden that is.”
Ron nodded, “You look good mate. Mum’s always shoving me in the sweaters she makes. No time for me to dress up in the nicer stuff with all the work we’ve been getting up to, I suppose.”
That is, until someone bumped into him. Harry tripped over his own feet and he braced himself to fall onto the pavement, but no contact came. Harry opened his eyes and he looked up into the eyes of- of-
“It’s connected. We can wait a few more minutes then, but we don’t want it to get too crowded.”
He should have bought coffee. Does the wizarding market, Alley Branch, even get coffee?
to see you Safe Harry! All of us were so worried when we didn’t find you with your relatives!”
But this time it was Harry doing it all to himself; it wasn’t a spell making him do it he wanted this. He washed his hands and used toilet paper to clean up his thighs. He looked at the time and saw that it was just passed midnight. He could hear Dudley in his bedroom and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to be asleep. Which was unusual but suited Harry just fine. He quietly walked down the stairs and towards the front door.
“Thanks.” He said and followed Jortook who walked off to one side, and Harry followed. She took him to the entrance to the deeper sections of the bank, but instead of going deep she took a left to a door. Interestingly enough there wasn’t a doorknob, but there was a keyhole. Jortook pulled a key out from one of her vest pockets and inserted the key. The door split open from the center and the Goblin stepped through and Harry followed.
Ginny cooed and Sidra preened.
He whispers and Sidra bobs her head in agreement.
Harry reaches castle Arundel, and makes his way to Adafri'd old home!
to those laughing at him for not understanding his miss-steps. His life was basically the punchline to a terrible joke.
Harry had no idea how he was going to sneak a snake into the Dursley household. The sun was close to rising and he needed to get back before anyone woke up.
Harry was busy inside dusting and cleaning everything inside and cleaning his bedroom. The master Bedroom to be exact. Which freaked Harry out to no end but Adafrid was insistent.
“If Mister Harry Potter needs assistance with
familiar sarcastic gruff voice, “Somehow she’s even more annoying dead than she was breathing.”
So what does everyone think so far? Let me hear your thoughts below! Short long, emoji's it doesn't matter! See you in the next chapter! :D
Harry smiled and pet Sidra,
The heat was absolutely retched, even as the sun was setting. All the little kids on the playground had gone home already, so a swing was open for him to get even a hint of a breeze. Occasionally he would curse the heat when he touched any of the metal he hadn't managed to shelter.
Harry whirled around with a giant grin on his face, “SIRIUS!” He cried and pushed past the others in the hall to allow himself to be swept up in a hug.
“They don’t exactly teach wizarding culture or etiquette.”
“Dudley get out of here!” He shouted, scrambling to his feet.
Hendret nodded and went to one of the walls, He pressed his hand into one of the bricks and it pressed in and a larger part of the wall opened.
“I was asking him about high society wizard stuff. I got magically emancipated by the tournament and now I have all sort of responsibilities connected with the family rings.”
I stan good Godfather Sirius who treats harry like an actual son rather than him acting like the fun uncle all the time. So what're your thoughts? Long, short, or emoji's it doesn't matter all of it makes my day just a little brighter! See you all next time. :)
This information didn’t comfort Hermione, “I don’t understand did we learn this in history? Did I miss this information?”
“Okay…I need you to take my money pouch and buy some groceries. Bread, meat, cheese. Maybe flour milk and eggs? Not too much just enough to get by- shoot. I should probably make a list. I don’t even know if I have enough.”
Soooo did it bother anyone else how they would mention certain spells and then wouldn't explain how they worked like with the fidellus? Or how it seemed that the Unbreakable Vow was just plum...ineffective? So- I expanded on two other concepts!
He put the basket on the dinning table and
Harry gulped and gingerly turned away from anything too breakable. Having a little light couldn’t be to destructive could it?
His breath caught in his throat. Sirius liked that Harry had a place to stay, got along with Harry’s chickens, and Sirius wanted Harry to be able to come
He asked her, stroking his hand down her body.
“All necessities for Mister Harry Potter! Chicken for laying eggs, a self-building coop for the chickens! Grow Fast fruit tree seeds! Oh oh oh and the most wonderful! A Forever Cooling Box!!”
He watched her breath, relaxing and feeling the tingle of the magic gather on his fingertips. He took another deep breath  and magic curled a little more around his fingers. With each deep breath magic curcled around his fingers.
Sidra hissed from her place on Harry’s shoulders.
“Right. Cool.”
Harry looked at Sidra how was he supposed to respond? Sidra looked at him, and she curled her way up his arm. Oh. Oh
Harry smiled,
Harry’s chest got tight,
The rock turned from white smooth stone into a squirmy white furry mouse and Sirius held it up like a prize. The snake nodded and swallowed the mouse.
It was the night before when he was packing up his things that he realized that he…was actually going to miss being here. He had double checked all of his summer homework to be sure it was in his trunk, he had packed up his clothes and none of it was ragged or faded.
“How so?”
“I think a hardy stew should do it, no?” She said to no one in particular and Harry smiled. He could stay for another hour or so, to rest up a little and get his fill of stew. Then he could go home and sleep, and he had to prepare Adafrid for their guest in a couple of days, because he was
“I know why he doesn’t have any kids, well, direct kids.”
“We got attacked by a Dementor! I managed to-“
“Yeah, not the prettiest of sights. The black family made it a point of either honor or fear for our elves. The longer the life the more ‘status’ they had. When the blacks had multiple elves this was used as a manner of…motivation. Don’t disappoint us and you’ll live longer than some. If you notice, the longer-lived elves are marked with gold, the shorter ones with black, and average with bronze. As soon as we’re done cleaning up the room
“Oh, I’m sure you would. Speaking of pets where’s trevor?”
“All we have to do is put up some wards and have a chat, then you can go about your way, dear.” Mrs. Weasley assured and all of them headed out to the muggle side of the leaky cauldron to get on the knight bus. Mrs. Weasley gave Stan (was there seriously only one Knight Bus?) An address to drive to, and it was some café.

a wizard’s oath?”
I would really like to hear your thoughts down in the comments long, short, or just full of emojis it all makes my day that much brighter! See you all in the next one! :D
Of course, occasionally, when Uncle Vernon needed to get a deal locked down, they would go to church on Sundays for about a month and a half but that’s as religious as things got.
“Tell that to your dead parents and boyfriend.”
Adafrid sat up just a little straighter, “Dementors? I hope you two weren’t footling about near Azkaban. Dementors are supremely territorial. However, I suppose no one is quite sure how they reproduce-“
Sidra hissed,
Hermione rolled her eyes and hugged him around his waist instead, “Why am I specifically not hugging your neck?”
Harry took a deep breath. It was time to turn a house into a home.
“Harry she is so…
Harry smiled and pet Sidra’s back, “Yeah, probably going to meet up with some friends after.”
“It’ll be the first time seeing my friends in quite some time.”
” He hissed to Sidra who had crawled into the grass for a moment to herself.
“SIRIUS.” Scolded Molly, “You know we have important business! The wards need to be strengthened-“
When he woke, he didn’t feel like he had slept at all.
“Cedric.” Harry warned looking around the graveyard, but he was too far away.
Sidra crawled up Harry and around left hand, his cast hand.
“I don’t understand.” Harry stood up, “I have my own money, I don’t need yours.”
“Well, if he went to south France then I’m sure he had a good turnout. Not very strong potions makers.”
“Oh, uh, at least until the term at Hogwarts starts. It’s a little less than a month. I can clean up this place, manage the yard that sort of stuff to earn my keep here.”
It was now Harry’s turn to look a little pensive, “I don’t know Hermione, I’ve really enjoyed the time I’ve had to myself. And I just made some delivery purchases, wouldn’t want them to get rained on or something.”
Harry shrugged, “Yeah, Sidra let me in.”
Harry kept cleaning and caring for the trees and chickens and life was honestly very peaceful. Adafrid was very helpful with homework and filling in the theory and explaining certain magical concepts.
than happy to assist. Insisting that since Hogwarts was closed for the summer he had nothing more important to look forward to.
“Either way I can’t use it to get food.”
Sidra hissed softly.
“Why did you bring it along? Are you doing a private lesson with Professor Sprout?”
“Dumbledore sent me to keep an eye on you. Make sure you were safe. Now off you go!”
Mrs. Weasley reached their table and she looked them all over and she sighed with relief, “Oh thank
His summer certainly had taken a turn from chores for a home he didn’t care about full of people who didn’t care about him to having to do chores for himself so the house that he lives in isn’t in such a bad state.
Harry chuckled, “No..I don’t think they would. In fact, I know from personal experience that dust bunnies are awful conversationalists.”
“He’s
“How is it that you came upon my house young intruder? And with my familiar no less?”
Sirius nodded, and he took a breath to speak. The words caught in his throat and he looked from Harry to Sidra and back again and he rubbed his face.
Sidra hissed softly and Harry pressed his lips together. Harry reached up and pet Sidra so she went ahead and dropped her illusion and
Adafrid nodded, “Good, now put it on your dominant hand’s index finger. It should resize to your hand.
Sure enough, In a blur the Knight Bus appeared. Seeing it in the light the paint on it looked a bit fresh and just as purple as the light time. Stanley was waiting and he droned off his spiel welcoming the witch or wizard in need and Harry stood their patiently.
The way Neville talked about this was sweet, he was gently tapping on the pot of the Mimbulus and shyly looking at Harry every once in a while.
“Is that all?”
He went to his room to grab his wand. Harry hadn’t used his holly wand once since he had gotten this one from Adafrid…what was he going to do when he got to Hogwarts?
Sirius had a brother? Harry would have to ask Sirius about that.
“Such a sweet girl, you’ll behave while I’m gone, right?” She clucked at him and tottled away.
“I’m coming Aunt Petunia!” He called back in an appropriate level.
“Hey Sirius!”
He hissed as quietly as he could but the tunnel took that sound and amped it up to 11.
Like Filch. He almost felt pity. Mrs. Figg wasn't the most pleasnt around with all her pets and smelly house but she at least was more decent a person than Filch.
Time felt like it was flying after that, Sirius and Adafrid spoke quietly to each other as they prepared for the portkey.
Dudley was screaming and the Dementor leaning in, soaking up the fear, drowning out any happiness in his cousin. Harry’s heart was pounding and needed to act NOW. But he didn’t have his wand, he couldn’t even cast a Patronus!
His heart was positively pounding and there was a rushing in his ears and he made his way back to his own compartment and he say down and Ginny had brought a blond Ravenclaw in her year. Lena? Luna?
“According to your file,” Hendret said, flipping papers and scanning the words, “On October 31
“It’s your portkey.” Sirius supplied and pulled on a chain pulling his own pendant out, “Adafrid let me make two of them. To activate you grasp the pendant so all of it is covered from the light and recit: Cedo nulli. It’s Adafrid’s Latin motto, it means ‘I yield to no one’ pretty fitting if you ask me.”
Harry wrinkled his nose at the smell and looked around and felt his lunch fight back. Lining the walls of the stairs leading up to the second level was plaque after plaque of heads, and there were
The snake hissed with pride, slithering up Harry and curling the upper half around his neck and curling the lower half around his arm.
Harry protested the snake huffed.
Despite Harry’s initial aversion the wand was quite friendly to hold, and patient as well. After Harry casting the Lumos it wasn’t too excited and didn’t seem insulted when Harry had tried to back away from it. It was like it was waiting.
Adafrid looked Harry over. And shook his head, “This is no way for a guest in my home to dress! My Grandmother is probably rolling in her grave. Please, have a look at my things in the storeroom. There should be a chest near a standing mirror with some of my other lounging clothes and shoes.”
It wasn’t a very long form, and it wasn’t too awful to figure out what it was about. It was partly a waver disclosure saying that if anything bad happened to anything or anyone on the property got hurt it wasn’t their fault. But that fidelius was probably old and surely Sirius would tell him if he were staying there…
The ride was quiet but not uncomfortable, and when they got off Harry got a look at the café. It didn’t look corporate, and there were a couple people talking over their coffee outside its doors. Harry almost wanted to take a look inside, but when the bus was out of sight Mrs. Weasley turned a little more serious and any thought of exploring flew out the window.
“I’ve been great! I’ll tell you all about it upstairs.”
Harry was going to get
Harry smiled and he changed into another set of clothes before heading down.
Harry chuckled and sat back down. “Well, we’re alone now. Want to play some exploding snap?”
This one goes from one end of the bar to the other! I hope you enjoy all the shenanigans I've laced in here.
“Right,” and he set her down and made his exit.
He fled No.4  before Vernon even made his way back down. He ran to the small forest Vernon wouldn’t look for him there.
Sirius looked away from sizing up the stone snake that was sizing him up and looked over at Harry. He grinned.

And that’s what broke the illusion. That’s what took Malfoy away from him. But it never could have lasted right? They would have had to separate for summer anyway. He probably would’ve died. There’s no way his parents would’ve let him over to their place or vice versa.
Ginny’s eyes were wide, but not in a way people usually react to snakes. One time Aunt Petunia had seen a garden snake and she had nearly fainted from fright. Her eyes were wide and bugged out of her head so much Harry thought that they might pop. Ginny’s eyes, instead, were wide in a way that he’d seen Aunt Petunia look at Dudley (such as the time when Dudley was Nine and was forced to wear a sailor suit for a photo session).
He stepped around the paper and quietly walked back up the stairs to his bedroom and laid in his bed to nap for however long he had left until Petunia ‘woke’ him up. It was the weekend so maybe she wouldn’t come get him until , and it was 6 ish.
He asked and Sidra looked up at him.
Which was mostly the problem. He would be having a much easier time navigating the wizarding world if there had been
Harry unlatched the two pieces holding it closed and he lifted the lid. There was no smell of anything rotting or damp, nor did he get another strong wiff of dust. He took a better look inside and saw a few sets of clothing. Linen shirts on one side waist coats in the middle and trousers on the other side. Harry picked up the linen shirts and they felt…good. Not course and in far better condition than his own clothing.
“Is this another part of the tournament?” He asked, but the fear in his voice said otherwise.
Harry needed to sit down for a minute.
Harry chuckled, “I’ll see if I can get the others at school to start that up again.”
“Okay, thanks!” Harry nodded. Jortook nodded and stepped back into the hall, the door closing behind her.
Sidra hissed agreeably and Harry set to work to inform his friends that Yes, he was safe but he felt like he needed some alone time and that later in the summer he would reach out again about meeting up at Diagon Alley. He added in his response to Ron that Harry’s own ‘secret get-away’ still had plenty of chores due to unforeseen circumstances, but he would definitely help Ron on the train with his homework since he had decided to get that done early.

Harry swallowed thickly and tried to keep moving forward and be unnoticed; however, he seemed to be a magnet for trouble today, because Malfoy
“You think the wand would accept you?”
Ron nodded and rubbed the back of his neck, “But now I have to follow all of these
Harry hummed in agreements and closed his eyes, and he didn’t see the shinning magic that made a thread between himself and Sidra. The moon seemed to glow a little brighter for just a moment, but it was about to set anyway…so maybe that had something to do with it.
“Now, place the ring, seal side down, on your thumb print. If there is a genetic match, then the proper name or names will glow gold.”
“Dudley? That was a dementor; we need to get you home and some chocolate in you. I’m sorry you had to deal with that, but you’ll be okay.” He hoped so anyway. Dudley was a muggle, and he didn’t know what exactly happened when a dementor leached off of a muggle, but it couldn’t be good. By the distant look in Dudley’s eyes and his slack jaw with his mouth mouthing words that didn’t make sense.
“Mr. Potter?” Hendret asked looking up from a file he was holding and Harry nodded.
“Sidra wants you to know you’re very wise.”
Harry nodded and mumbled a thank you. He sat in the chair that wasn’t the red armchair in the painting but it was a simpler style but seemed very comfortable.
“But where would I go? Dumbledore-“
There was a chime and Harry frowned, looking towards the sound and one of the side windows opened and in came- Hedwig?
Sirius smiled, “Maybe next time I should just swallow my pride and use my dad’s wand.”
The script was crisp and cultured and Harry felt bile in the back of his throat. Of course, he hadn’t read that dumb letter! Fresh off a True Love curse with days of no contact? There was no way in

“I see fancy prefect badges. I hadn’t even known that you two were being considered.”
He pointed out and she bobbed her head in agreement.
Harry nodded curtly and Draco sneered and turned around with a flourish and heading back down the train.
“Wheat?”
She settled down on Harry and just laid there. The weight of Sidra was soothing.
Harry nodded and he looked around the house. It was very dirty. He sighed and headed back to the library.
What was Harry going to do when school got started?
Ron turned right back around his face flaming red and he pointed a finger at harry and jabbed it in his direction, “Don’t. Start.” Before deflating and turning around, “This is going to be the worst year yet.”
Sidra didn’t seem convinced and the ride continued. Stanley did come by with some bottled water and crumpled muggle crisps. Harry did pay for them (not too badly price either to his surprise) and he started sipping and nibbling. Not too much because this was genuinely like sitting on a roller coaster and actually eating food under these conditions could possibly spell disaster that he definitely wanted to avoid.
“He’s dead.” He said, his hands itch to do something, anything.
“It is of no trouble Mr. Potter. According to the request you wish to see your lineage?”
Neville chuckled, “Agreed, but apparently they taste better than they smell. I don’t want to disturb anyone, I just don’t know how else to transport it.”
but I managed to chase it off before it could hurt Dudley-“
He noticed the chickens as he passed and one of them came up to him, he smiled and pet her.
Dobby noded eagerly his ears flapping wildly, “Yes mister potter, yes! All have been gotten and more! A much-needed house warming gift for Mister Harry Potter in Mister Harry Potter’s new home! A very clever place. Very well hidden! Dobby will help put these things away!”
“It’s a
“Thanks for cooking, Sirius.”
“I even tried it twice.”
“Yeah! I’m not sorry. Got to prank Frank really good on the final night of third year, and Mother was
Harry is not amused,
Harry helped when he could and with the two of them they got the smell under control in just a couple of minute.
Sirius laughed a hearty laugh and shook his head, “Elves, such strange creatures.”
Sirius blinked a couple of times his mouth a little slack, but eventually, it got through and he nodded and let out an impressed chuckle, “Sounds like you’ve been
The hallway had three doors, two at the front and one at the back of the hall. With a deep breath he walks down the hall and the door at the back the door was ornate and taller than the others. There were carvings in the door and the handle was a lever type handle that had filigree on it and unlike the rest of the house, there was no dust.
Harry comes back to the room with aching thighs and his breathing even. He puts the cleaned razor away and he gently got into bed. Sidra crawled onto him. He adjusted himself on his back and Sidra watched him with her large unblinking eyes.
“Greetings.” Said the cherub, its voice light and gently, it held out a hand, “Please, place your hand atop mine so I may register your magic.”
“Somehow? No research was put in place to find out what shielded you?”
the words there wasn’t anything he could do to fix it. He was alone with an extended family that hated him with locks on his doors and a cat flap to feed him.
Mrs. Weasley obviously wanted to say no, judging by the defiant shine in her eye, and Harry honestly understood her feelings, but he wanted to keep what he had gained for himself.
Sidra teased softly and Harry approached the head teller. He looked unhappy staring at his paperwork as he did the last time he was here. Harry approach none-the-less.
He hissed and Sidra rubbed her head against his face.
Why was he so surprised by this?
Oh she is not going to like this, “I was told by the Goblins I’ve inherited the Black family ring.”
Sidra hissed softly and rewrapped herself around Harry’s shoulders tucking her head against his throat.
Sidra cursed softly and Harry smiled.
Harry gulped and gingerly set the wand back down. The memories of second year crawling under his skin.
Hey! It's the second installment! And only two weeks until spooky day!!
His breath caught in his throat and Sidra hissed, but it was low, and soothing and she bobbed her head.
They kept bantering back and forth and Harry sent Neville a look and he smiled and shrugged, keeping a potted plant on his lap trying to keep it upright as the train started moving.
So...thoughts? Yeah, a bit cliche type ending but I love that kind of stuff! Leave a comment long short or just emojis to let me know your thoughts! I'll see ya'll next time! :)
she has a perfectly acceptable recreation of that damn thing in her painting! SHE ISN’T GOING TO MISS IT!” He shouted and the elf looked sourly back at Sirius.
against his shoulder making both of them stumble and Malfoy directed a glare at him.
Harry gulped, “Well. I uh, I don’t know a lot about *how* Voldemort came to power. I just know that he did. He also believed in divination, and there was a prophecy made about a child that could defeat him. He decided that was me.”
What was the point of living a life if everything was only going to be taken away from him? But they couldn’t take away this. The pain that he could feel that reminded him that he wasn’t as dead as he felt.
…” Kreature muttered and slinked away. Sirius sighed.
It was two stories as far as harry could tell, and it had one round tower on the side. The grass and trees around the house had grown out of control, the entrance had been taken over by tall weeds and grass.
Harry nodded and walked to the door, opening it with little difficulty and pushed it open to reveal the contents within. Two candles lit the room nicely and Sidra hissed.
“Harry? What is it?” Mrs. Weasley cried coming over and steadying him. Harry shook his head and covered one of his eyes pressing the palm into the socket.
The hall went silent, and Harry looked everyone in the eye and he took a deep breath.
Harry smiled in return, thankful that Sirius was glad he had a place. He was worried he was going to say something about ‘dangerous times’ and ‘blood wards’ it was honestly so much better.
Number 4 came into view and he looked back at the moon, the crescent shining in the cloudless sky. He nodded in its direction in thanks and headed inside readying himself for whatever was going to happen.
Harry rolled his eyes, “He was a potions maker. Sidra says he was popular in France.”
Harry went to bed before Sirius came out of the library.
Something like this felt forbidden, reaching for the doorknob and turning it, opening up the house to the darkness outside. It was cooler that night, and there were no clouds to cover the stars or the moon. It was nice. He took a deep breath and stepped out, closing the door behind him. He could’ve turned to cross Ms. Figg’s house but he didn’t feel like going deeper into the suburb. So he turned the other way to the sparse forest on the edge.
Sidra hissed softly with pleasure and slithered her way onto his arm, and she did that thing that made his magic just sing and he took a deep breath in and smelled the hot concrete and car fumes from the road. He felt the sun on the back of his neck, and he visualized a little bubble around the four of them. A walking little cloud of ‘notice me not’ and the magic easily gathered, and with a small shake of his hand he released the magic with a mutter of the confundus spell and the bubble snapped into place and the people around then naturally avoided them their gazes drifting away.
Harry was not unfamiliar with food markets he wasn’t even unfamiliar with going food shopping in general but there were so many vendors and the
“Right.” Sirius interrupted Harry’s train of thought, “An Unbreakable Vow is making a promise. Like killing an enemy or protecting an ally…keeping a secret. If you break that vow, you die. So, let’s say I made a vow to you to keep a secret, if I broke that vow- I would die. Hey- I know that look let me continue.
Sidra reared up,
“It is done, you now have full access to number 12 Grimmauld place. Is there anything else?”
Not that bad of an idea, but not that alluring of an idea considering Tom Riddle.
His voice was soft and cultured. Like something out of a period film. However, unlike actors pretending authenticity. This was entirely authentic.
Partway through, Sidra got tired and Harry picked her up. He looked over at the main keep of the castle. The stone setup of the building made him a little wistful for Hogwarts. The structures had similar drum towers that Hogwarts had and honestly Harry hadn’t ever been to a proper castle before then. Harry wondered how much work actually went into upkeeping this place, especially with no magic.  This would make for a great Muggle Studies field trip. He might suggest it to the professor when he got back in September.
“Indeed. So, Mr. Potter. Do you intend to stay here long?”
Harry turned around to leave, but Sidra didn’t climb onto him, she was twisted in an aggressive S shape starring at him from beside the wand.
” Harry reached out and pet Sidra’s body,
“Yeah, I- I found her over the summer. She seemed to like me well enough and thanks to her uh, ‘blending in’ ability having her around my relatives wasn’t an issue.”
“That’s great Neville!” Harry praised, “I bet you’ll be one of the best herbologists out there when we get out of school.”
The room was wide and longer than he thought the room should be and on the right side of the room there was a ladder, and Harry looked up and this room was much, much taller than he thought a place like think should be.
“There is a needle next to the cloth tapestry.” Hendret pointed out and Harry took a closer look and there was indeed a needle glittering in the lamplight. “Prick the needle into the thumb of your dominant hand and press it into the arithmancy circle on the bottom right of the tapestry.”
Harry was going to ask for more, but the other side of the chamber opened up to reveal another Goblin. Harry immediately stood up.
Sirius turned to Harry with a proud smile, “Just learned about Oath and already you’re thinking out of the box!”
Ron fist bumped Harry and the three of them continued to talk. The afternoon was becoming quite enjoyable, that is, until Mrs. Weasley bustled in with panic in her eyes scanning everyone inside. When she caught sight of them her shoulders dipped with relief and she quickly made her way over, weaving her way through the patrons like a champion.
Eventually the path lead to a gate, the front gate presumably not too large but all enough to deter anyone from climbing over. However behind the gate there only seemed to be a further expanse of forest. Probably more protective magic, similar to Hogwarts. Magical pressure weighed on Harry more and more as he walked closer to the gate. Like TV static but with more fire behind it than pixels on the screen, the coil of magic was large light a looming storm on the horizon. Harry reached out in front of him and gently placed his palm on the metal.
Harry laughed genuinely because, of course, Ron wouldn’t have known. He wouldn’t make a big deal out of it.
Harry chuckled at himself, at least his anxiety had done the job of waking him up.
ring. The one connected to my name and vaults. I would like you to have access to it.”
The snake hissed, pointing it’s carved head to Sidra.
Harry took a sharp inhale of breath. He squeezed his eyes shut when they started to burn. He Took a deeper breath and let it out slow. When Harry opened his eyes, Sidra was looking at him, expectantly but with no judgment.
“I’m sorry.” Adafrid held up his hand, “I believe those two pieces of information could fill up a book alone. Actually, I think we’ll have to put this conversation on pause because I’m certain you need tea and perhaps some food to nosh on. Did you happen to bring anything with you? I’m afraid what remains in my cupboards is nothing but dust.”
Adafrid stopped pacing, “What dark times are these where dementors are allowed to attack children with no repercussions?”
“Anything!”
Of all the things to have gone turtle; it being the floo honestly wasn’t even on the list let alone the worst thing to have happened. Worst come to worst he’ll have to take the hike back out to Arundel and summon the Knight Bus but that was a lot of spent galleons and no way to replenish it.
“A toad causes chaos
Sirius grinned, “I look forward to seeing the results. Now, I would love to stay here and chat but I have a potion brewing in the Library and Adafrid said he would watch it but he tends to get wrapped up in his book sooo.”
The further into the forest they walked the more Harry saw the cherub snake statues. None of them asked for an offering and none of them spoke to Harry. Which was fine with him, talking to more stone snakes wasn’t on his to do list and he didn’t want to be slowed down by talking to all of the statues.
Harry went to close the door behind him, unfortunately the door by itself made a slamming noise and everyone in front of him whirled around. He wasn’t sure what all the fuss was about, that is, until he heard the screaming.
“I mean, I don’t see why not-“
Harry nodded and he helped Dudley up and they limped their way back to number 4.
Harry grunted and held out his hand and Hendret took his and gently and examine the small wound and then muttered a spell, but the syllables weren’t the one he remembered for the usual healing spell, but it seemed to work the same regardless because his thumb was didn’t radiate pain from the pinpoint prick and Hendret brought out a handkerchief and wiped the excess blood away.
“Oh Merlin’s tits.”
Harry thought about the sun beating down on his neck, about the rush of freedom at being away from the Dursleys and he wanted to make a light, a small light that would be comforting. He felt the magic curling and simmering in his hand and he closed his fist.
“Cool..but why have the other rings if the more important one is the Potter ring?”
“Uh- I, I don’t really get along with a powerful wizard, and a bad one at that, and he…might have sent it?”
“To HELL with that freak! Dudley had gone through SHOCK. The doctors are keeping him another night just to make sure he won’t hurt himself! I have had enough of you this summer! Hissing when no one is there, freaky magic, you ruining EVERYTHING for my family!” Veron got closer and crowded up into Harry’s face. “You will LEAVE and I don’t want to see your freakish face until next summer boy!”
seen him.
He really really was!
“Right, but I didn’t think Goblins do ‘free’.”
The inside of Adafrid’s home was warm, but no fire was lit and nothing seemed to be broken or moved but there was a light layer of dust over most of the surfaces. It was sensibly decorated, no garish colors, there were bookshelves of books and the occasional treasure of personal desire. An ornate set of candles, a grandfather clock by the fireplace.
When he finished, he put on his clothes and was toweling off his hair on his way back downstairs Sidra was comfortably wrapped around his shoulders.  Harry took in the warm sweet smell of pancakes being cooked.
“It isn’t a secret anyway- What I told the painting is true. I’m here for the Black family ring! I own this place and in order for the ownership to be passed to me I had to get that stupid charm off of it in order to claim-“
“The ring? Why wouldn’t Dumbledore just give it to me?”
“Who’s Cedric then, eh? You’re boyfriend?”
“I understand, Hermione.” Harry placated, “You two go and catch up. Plan detentions and point systems. You’ll have a great time.”
Harry sighed. “Alright, time to get up.”
His thighs itched but not in a way that he wanted to hurt, and he couldn’t help himself because before now he couldn’t help but wish that Sirius was being genuine, and he
Sidra looked at the Paper, and looked back at him,
the way he thought a hug from your dad might feel sturdy, sure, and with care.
The food finished heating and he grabbed a fork and ate. It wasn’t nearly as good as it being fresh but something was better than nothing. He cleaned his plate and hand-washed the dishes then dried them before putting them back exactly where he found them. That was a good meal and now he could go to his room and relax for once.
They discussed the details and how the Fidelus was going to work, and really It was all simple. They stood inside the circle, and they each recited their part of the spell, and a circle started to glow, and then when each of them finished their part of the spell, Molly would cast a deosil circle to symbolize and activate sun magic to protect the house from view, and since Harry was stronger with the moon so he cast widdershins to invoke the moon and use the rays of the moon to cast a ‘shadow’ upon the house to conceal it from prying eyes.
“But how do you-“
He didn’t have to purchase much food, in fact, he was pretty much covered on the fruit side of things. Minus bananas.
Gracefully she made her way down.
“I’ll ask Adafrid about it when I get back to the mansion.”
“They’ll need proof. And they should give you a free blood reading of your family tree and see if you are in direct line for my vaults.”
Sidra postures.
“That’s even worse, Hermione!” Ron scolded and Hermione rolled her eyes, but there wasn’t really much malice.
“It accepts you as the head of the Black family. If it hadn’t it would’ve thrown itself across the room. The one thing you’ll learn about the Blacks is that we’re pretentious and tradition is more important than sense, the good thing is that most of the family is now driving the afterlife insane.”
“I cast a wandless light spell, and it made an orb of light. The snake swallowed it whole.”
“This is a little too public to talk about. Why not come back with us? Mrs. Weasley knows the way, and she’s almost done with the shopping.”
He hissed and the magic on his fingers dispersed. The forest floor had a nice fat mouse groggy from the summoning and the snake hissed in pleasure, darting for its meal. Harry looked away.
He let her soak in there for a minute or two before pulling her out and drying her off. Hopefully, by the time he got back, things would be much better and no Mimbulus mania to worry over.
Sidra did not look convinced and Sirius made a choking sound from across the room. Harry looked over and Sirius looked pale.
Harry and Sirius hashed out further details and eventually, they came to a good ‘contract’ for the oath.
Luckily, that night didn’t have any weird dreams and Sirius had cooked omelets for breakfast with some pancakes on the side. They talked lightly about one thing or the other and it honestly felt like he was part of a real family.
“Fascinating. Jortook!” He snapped his fingers and another Goblin appeared, this goblin was wearing more light greens than the other browns of the Goblin’s dress. “Are you familiar with the protocols of section 6 B of the Treasury Charters?”
“Yeah.”
“Now. I think it’s time for supper.” Molly said and started waving her wand around pots and pans flying about and the stove popping on.
Harry grinned and tugged Sirius in a little further, “Wait till you meet the hens!”
they had fish stands! He Grabbed three potatoes at one stand, oil at another. He bought half a pound of ground poultry some rice, and even grabbed some extra butter.
Neville grinned, “I owled her about my gift and it’s properties. She says that I can start working on an OWLs project in place of the herbology exam. I’m going to propagate a couple of the leaves in different types of nutrient soil to see if the sap changes properties. Then I get to write an essay on my method and findings and can submit it to the OWL proctors for grading!”
The dementor screeched and attempted to stand its ground but it was pushed aside by the Patronus. Dudley slumped to the ground in a mumbling heap.
She slithered into place and they headed out. The chickens clucked contented to roam about the yard. Harry walked over to the chicken feed and threw out a few hand fulls over the grass for them to find.
Adafrid frowned, "This is my home, it is improper to force you to do such menial tasks.”
The Mimbulus.
Adafrid looked up from his book and furrowed his brow. “Of course, There’s a closet just down the hall. But why use rags when you could banish the dust?”
“Learning from past mistakes.” Harry corrected softly, “I don’t want what happened to me and my parents to happen ever again.”
.” Came a
Harry hummed and he looked at the wand and he looked at the crytal embedded in the wood.
Harry laughed and waved him off, “Go on I’ll be here.”
It was the same format as the one Sirius had spoken. Minus the name, she gave her own name and Harry accepted her oath, and they completed everything. Molly didn’t look nearly as exhausted as Harry felt. He wanted to go to bed and not get out for at least 12 hours.
The place was still covered in dust, but the lights helped. Harry took a deep breath and he reached up to grab the silver lidded pot that was on the far left. Beside some photographs and other trinkets.
“As it should be, for the both of you. Ever since the Christianization of wizard society with the ever-increasing Muggle population, familiars fell into decline.”
Harry sighed.
“WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?” He shouted lifting up his fists like he could punch it to death.
“Do you accept the oath of keeping the secret I have confided in you?”
He purchased his school supplies first and even paid for
“How may I be of assistance?” His voice graveled out.
Harry got back to Gaunt Mansion later that night, getting close to midnight. He gave his girls a late feed and bid Adafrid goodnight.
“Hello Harry, it’s pleasant to see you- oh dear boy, what are you wearing?”
Sirius nodded and disappeared into the library. It had only just occurred to Harry the possible dangers of an open flame in a library, but Sidra would’ve told him if there was danger and the wards seemed pretty calm in the back of his mind so he was sure everything was going to be okay.
And he grabbed one of his razors from his nightstand and his only set of pajamas (which were really just an old top and shorts from Dudley that were too small for him from a birthday many years ago).
Harry didn’t fully believe in murphy’s law. But Neville had a sort of bad luck around him that seemed to tempt fate.
Kreature?” Sirius shouted at possibly the oldest thing Harry had ever seen. He was wearing a thin flour sack, there were hanging stretches of skin coming off his bones and one of his ears looked like someone had constantly used it for stabbing practice.
his godfather.
Hello! I've got another chapter! Hope you all enjoy! :D
Harry’s heart pounded and his eyes burned. He tried to find Draco in the crowd but it was no use, he was gone. As usual. He sighed and turned back around. His friends were waiting for him.
Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were sitting in the living room and they didn’t look happy. Aunt Petunia’s face was pinched in a way that Harry knew wasn’t about him, and Uncle Vernon looked uninterested in general and was probably only awake for Petunia.
“It’s okay Sirius. She’s a friend.”
When he used magic without a wand. When he found Sidra, when he used magic
Luna smiled and looked directly at Sidra, “Why thank you, you’re a very complimentary individual yourself.”
“Hey there, Prongslett! How is this morning treating you?”
And by girls he meant his chickens. They were free-range, sure, but they still needed a nutrition supplement every other day or so.
The older goblin nodded, “It is appreciated. Mister Potter, please accompany Jortook and she will take care of your lineage tracking.”
“You speaking in tongues, freak? Finally, lost it have you? You gonna use your magic on me? We both know what’ll happen if you do that why I-“
“In South Down's?” Stanley clarified already booking a ticket.
“There we go, now. The ancestry tapestry.” Both of them turned to face it and harry found his name at the bottom. Above his name was his parents name. Lilly Evans Potter and James Potter.
“Harry.” Someone said to him and someone sat next to him and placed a hand on his, “Harry, I see you have a new familiar. Is she shy? Is that why she’s hiding?”
Harry reached out and gently grasped the white and grey stripped wood. And warmth travelled up his arm, it kept going but stopped at his shoulder and Harry wide-eyed stood still.
Harry let out a sigh, attacking one particularly nasty weed.
Dobby grinned from ear to ear and Harry was..he honestly didn’t know what to do about this.
Covered his face with a hand trying to ground himself.
year so it should be fine.
Everyone headed into the apartment, Harry walking behind them. It seemed that the hallway they were walking into was long and dark, like there wasn’t many light sources to make it brighter, or something was soaking up the light too fast for it to properly light the area.
He wasn’t sure how he to release the magic, but if it was a kind of physical force…. He imagined his magic like a cannon of air, pulling back and loading the weapon, and pretended that his magic was the bearing ball, what came was a gust, the trees swayed and his hair got into his eyes. Sidra was cackling head up in the air feeling the wind across her…sclaes?
Harry chuckled and reached his arm out for her to climb up.
The snake hissed in encouragement. Bumping her head against his cheek.
“I have to say,” Jortook spoke up, “It has been quite some time since I’ve seen a wizard or witch with such a strong bond with a familiar.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He tried to move past them but Dudley pushed him back, “Oi! Don’t you try and piss around and slink out of the way- you’ve been acting freakish. Crying about at night at all hours. ‘Cedric not Cedric’” Dudley whimpered contorting his face into a frown and fake crying with snivelling noises. Wipping away fake tears.
He nodded and Hendret nodded back and snapped his fingers and items appeared in a small flourish of gold sparks.
“Alright Hedwig I’ll write up my responses. Don’t bother the hens okay? I don’t think they’ve forgiven me for the last time.”
Diets and exercises have made Dudley mad with superiority, he’s gathered a group of cronies from practically three neighborhoods over in a gang, but at the center, it was Dudley and Piers wasn’t it? Couldn’t ever resist a game of
all three of you all right. Harry stood up and Mrs. Weasley took the chance to hug him, he redirected her arms away from his neck so she wouldn’t hurt Sidra but other than that it was warm and nice and very much welcome.
Dudley’s distant expression sharpened just a hair like his brain cells were trying to work, but the heat was cooking them faster than he could use them; however, Piers was able to pick up the slack.
“Uh, Harry-“
The word was stuck in the back of his throat. A place without the Durlsey’s. A place where he could cook for himself. A place he didn’t feel the need to share with
Harry shrugged while rolling his eyes,
“And the ring isn’t here because…?”
to their position. When they turn 17 the law recognizes their position as an adult. There was a whole thing that happened a couple of centuries ago with an old blood family was like, a 12-year-old tried to vote for something and it causes d a lot of trouble.”
“I unlocked the cupboard. You have 10 minutes to get out!” And he marched back upstairs to the bedroom and slammed the door.
Afraid nodded, “I understand that, but I believe that there should be no trouble. You remember the wards?”
“Is that the ‘adult business’ that Mrs. Weasley wanted to leave me out of?”
Ron laughed, “Nah, they don’t teach it in History. Mum likes to gossip with her friends and discuss stuff with Bill about ‘all he needs to know’ and never really know when I’m listening in. I pick up on stuff too.”
Oh. Right. “
“Thanks.
“-so we will take you where you need to go!” He looked up and his red rimmed eyes blinked taking in the sighy of harry. Stanley’s hat still didn’t fit properly light the rest of his baggy clothes but he had haven recently at least.
Sidra demanded and Harry raised his eyebrows at her.
“Molly right now is working on the Arithmancy circle. Now, ideally, we would use the same secret keeper to add a little short cut but Dumbledore hasn’t responded to any of our ways to contact him and we have to fix this as soon as we can. So, since you’re the owner of Grimmauld now. You must choose who you want the secret keeper to be.”
He deflects. Picking her up and wrapping her around his shoulder, “
“Yeah, I’ll sign the form.”
First his father’s name glowed, and then his grandmother and great grandfather leading and up and up until there was just one name left.
He moved his hand in the familiar shape, “Scourgify.” He incanted and a flash of yellow popped from his wand and spread out over the table in a line of yellow the dust was being eaten away by the spell. In less than a few seconds the wood, which had been caked in dust, shined with a new polish. Harry was a little slack-jawed and where there was a bit of a knot of anxiety, that he hadn’t he known he had, that loosened.
Sidra hummed and lifted her head from her coils looking him over and she bobbed her head in approval.
She hissed in a way that sounded like he was thinking,
“But it’s okay, I went to the bank and they told me I was magically emancipated because of the Tournament last year. Seriously, I’m okay-“
Harry held his breath for as long as he could waiting for the other shoe to drop. Aunt Petunia to come in and smack him with a frying pan or Vernon to come in and as a practice dummy for boxing.
Harry got up from the swing, “I wasn’t talking to you, that’s for sure.”
He hissed and the Stag came to life at the entrance of the tunnel. The light coming from the stag paired with the moon tight it almost looked full.
Harry nodded and slid it onto his right hand, placing it on his pinky. The ring pulsed with magic and settled down. Sirius gave an audible sigh.
Harry’s quickly strode up the stairs and he started collecting his things as quickly as he could. The things in his floorboard the little amounts of muggle clothes he had. His wand. He had everything he needed and he skipped steps on the way down to gather his trunk and owl cage for Hedwig.
Harry smiled wryly, “The place I have isn’t without its own ghosts, well, metaphorically. The owner of the house had a painting of himself set up. He isn’t loud or particularly harsh. He’s actually quite…nice. If not for him I would still be wearing oversized rags.”
Ron nodded and swallowed his own mouthful of food, “Bill won’t get the family ring till Dad’s ready to step away from that stuff. It can be more than a little annoying with all the politics. When you become of age in 7
Hendret grunted and exaimed the results himself, “The tapestry was treated with a potion designed to find lineages with traces of magic. Was your mother a New Blood?”
“Fantastic.” Sirius grinned, “Haven’t had to do something that stuffy in quite some time! This should be fun.”
“I do actually, I need to know a few things about this place, cause taking the Knight bus isn’t really safe, and if it’s as unplottable as I think…then I think I can make you a port key if you’re ever in danger.”
Harry shrugged, “Apparently one of my ancestors married into the Potter family, so…it survived, in a way.”
“You would be willing to help with them? What about-“
Harry looked at the plant, it looked like round lumps ontop of round lumps, like graps but a sickening shade of green with red spot that had white heads on them. Like acene ready to explode.
“Since I’m one of the Slytherin prefects I’ll let you off with a warning.” He got up close to Harry’s face, “But next time I’ll dock points for inconsiderate space use.” Draco’s cloak was blocking most of Harry’s form from the others, he reached out and slipped a note into the pocket of Harry’s waist coat.
“Go wash up.” Ginny waved him off, “I’m gong to see if we can get this…plant in a stable position away from trouble.”
And waiting they were at one of the booths, leaning over the table whispering to each other.
at Hogwarts anymore?”
from Dudley you- FREAK!” And he pushed Harry aside and they bumbled into the car and closed the door behind them leaving Harry behind.
She nosed into his hand and he smiled a little at the sureness of her voice.
“Uh- some wards recognized me as a family member. However, I don’t have anyone living to confirm my vault claim? I was told I could get a test done to trace back my lineage?”
Harry chuckled and pulled his other two rings, “The Potter ring isn’t the only thing I got from the Goblins. I have a grandmother going back a few lines who married
Harry agreed and just let himself be soothed to sleep with the feeling of Sidra’s weight and the pulsing marks on his legs.
Adafrid’s shoulders relaxed and he bowed his thanks to Harry and Harry made his exit with a heavy sigh. It would be rude to not at least look at what Adafrid had to offer. He headed upstairs to the storeroom. (TK check house dimensions) From the outside you would never guess this place had an upstairs but there was magic
Harry asked, patiently waiting as she thought.
“My family ring, well,
Which was probably the case.
Harry sighed and got up, “I don’t want to deal with this. I’m going back, Aunt Petunia wanted me to cook supper.”
“They’re called Thestrals.” Luna supplies and also reaches up and starts to pet the creature, “They’re only visible to those who have witnessed death.” Her tone was light and wistful, but considering that Luna was younger than Harry he was certain his heart shattered.
Sidra rearranged herself on Harry,
Neville grinned, straightening up a little, “I hope so. With a background of herbology I can go to university and learn magical medicine and start my own apothecary.”
closed up the house. It hadn’t been quite 10 minutes yet, so everything was probably fine. He walked a little faster just in case.
“Hello, Harry. Notice anything new?”
and be
“Would you like a ‘perish not’ box sir? To put all your things in while you do your other shopping?” The dairy stall asked and he said
Sidra drawled and Harry smiled.
Sidra didn’t relax, '
“The fuck?” Someone in the back cursed and Harry shrugged.
“The Order of the Phoenix? They’re still getting their footing back after 14 years of doing nothing and Dumbledore doesn’t want me leaving the base too much,  so I’m not really of much use aside from sniffing out trails or stalking people. But there are other more accomplished wizards able to do that.”
Harry took a deep breath and waved the new wand gently, “Lumos.” And balls of light popped out of the end of the wand! They just floated and glowed happily like they were always meant to be there.
“I know Molly, but I need to get Harry something
Harry nodded.
Adafrid smiled gently, “It’s of no trouble to me Mr. Potter. I’ve been alone here with my books and an empty house for many years. Having a guest is a much-needed reprieve. Dust bunnies do not make good conversationalists.”
Harry furrowed his brow, Luna only continued to smile patiently and gestured to his shoulders.
“You were up there for a while, what were you talking about?” Hermione asked and Harry sat down next to her, across from Ron, he grabbed a chocolate biscuit to nibble on.
Harry and Sirius catch up, and some spells are cast for saftey's sake. Sidra is also a very sassy snake.
“I have some spare if you like. Linen shirts and waist coats alike.”
“Considering he’s also looking pleased as punch I think he
He washed his dishes and managed to put them up before Vernon came lumbering down and he helped his Aunt set the table.
Harry walked to a deserted section of the neighborhood by the road as Sidra filled him in with the location of where to go. A castle in South Downs National park had a trail nearby that would lead him on the right path to the cottage
Harry kept an eye out and eventually found the statue that Sidra had mentioned. The cherub was holding a snake in its hand, and the snake looked like it was keeping careful watch for something. The muggles didn’t seem to be too concerned with it, passing it by as though…they didn’t even see it at all.
material discussing any of these details. It almost felt like one fool wrote the bare bones of the culture and didn’t think that maybe, just maybe, making a system to teach him how the culture works his life might be a little easier. But no, he had to play the dumb kid trying to figure life out through trial and error. And if he died? Who cares! At least it would be
Sirius, who didn’t speak parstletongue, looked at Harry with a questioning tilt of his head.
An she settled further and Harry felt the familiar flutter of her magic helping Harry funnel his, but instead of funneling it to use, it was opening up a part of himself that felt too vulnerable to have in the open.
The waistcoats on the top of its stack had silver buttons on it, and Harry looked it over before picking up the trousers. The pair on top was black and smooth to the touch. They seemed a bit looser than he figured they would be. However, the fashion sense seemed to be more in line with what people wore in Diagon Alley.
Sidra look at Sirius with a more curious expression and seemed more than a little impressed.
Sidra was curled pleasantly around Harry. She brought her head up next to Harry's cheek and flicked her tongue out to smell him,
“Sorry I don’t have any treats for you right now, they’re in my trunk and there’s no food here.”
At this point in the story, I have a VERY good idea of where it's going and how it's going to end, so I hope you all stick around to see it! Let me hear your thoughts in the comment section. It can be long, short, or just made up of emojis! Seeing them really makes my day!
Sirius pet each of the girls and despite Sirius being a dog animagus (or maybe that was a point in his favor) they all flocked around him for attention.
“Uh… no, not really.”
“Yeah, when the defensive mechanism is activated, it spews a horribly smelling sap to fend off animals that would wand to eat it.”
That was a thought for a different time because the clock in the hallway started to gently announce it was 10 o’clock with the ringing of a bell and harry grinned, Sirius should be at the entrance with the statue soon!
Harry looked down and, yeah. He was wearing one of his older shirts. One where it was a 5xl, and it definitely looked like it was wanting to fall off at any moment.
Good to know, so he kept pushing one leg in front of the other. At some point, everyone else was going to give up but Dudley was much more stubborn, and he had Piers to act as moral support and an ego booster. It was rapidly getting darker and he was getting further away from the suburb.
the Potter family. Through her, I got the Gaunt Ring. The wards protecting the house let me in on the president of me being family member and heir to the house and its assets.”
“Sure,” Ginny says, “As long as Trevor stays
All of them looked old, but none of them moved. There was Adafrid, of course, and two women. Well, one women and one girl. He frowned as he took the pot down, and took the lid off, grabbing a decent amount of the powder.
Sidra asked from her basking place and Harry nodded.
Sidra praises and Harry smiles.
“Uh- yeah, that would be great, but why do I have access to the Black vault?”
He called back
Snuffles yipped and Harry hugged the dog. It wasn’t the same as hugging Sirius himself, but this
when I unpacked my trunk!”
“Sorry about
” Sirius praised looking at the different pieces of furniture, “This guy must have had a hell of a fortune or a hell of a job to pay for all of this.”
Harry took a deep breath standing just outside the door of the bank. He slipped inside when a small family excited and the first thing he noticed was his leather shoes were quiet against the marble stone floor. There were many tellers and even more tellers. There were chandeliers hanging and the lights glittered and Harry made his way towards the back of the building.
“And why, exactly, is a Patriarch for the potter and
Sidra hissed in reluctant agreement and they continued down their way. Dudley kept mumbling and Harry assured him it was going to be fine. He had to keep up the charade that he knew that everything was going to be okay because if it dropped for even a moment his Aunt and Uncle were going to
He closed the bathroom door behind him. Someone laughed a little ways down the corridor and Harry’s blood went cold. There was only one person who laughed like that. Malfoy looked just as tall as he had in Diagon Alley, but he was in his school cloak this time and he was wearing an ugly smile. On his cloak was a prefect badge.
“Are you sure Harry?”
Gringotts was always a strange place to Harry, the Goblins, the people talking and whispering quietly or nervously. The vast space inside and how footsteps echoed almost endlessly.
(See the end of the chapter for
So what did you all think? Leave a comment! You can leave a long thesis, short comment, an emoji, or a STRING of emoji's!! It's all welcome here! See you all next time!
“What?” Harry asked and she smiled.
It was a few minutes before the blood clotted and he sighed getting up and going to the bathroom across the hall to clean up. He glanced over at the mirror knowing that a shadow would only remain. It was like Draco looked after because of the spell. Punished for being separated and rewarded for being close.
“Vernon
“No.” Harry shook his head, “Just my babysitter, who happens to be a squip. I thought she had been a muggle for most of my life.”
"I'm Harry Potter, sir."
he cast and open his hand and inside was a soft glowing ball of magic. He held his palm up to the snake and it opened his maw and swallowed the ball whole.
Harry looked at Sidra, and Sidra nodded back. “I think that’s all. Now uh, I think I need to make a withdrawl. From my trust fund.”
“I, Sirius Black, solemnly swear to keep the secret you have given. I swear to never divulge the name of the location you have shared with me to others without magical permission. I will not divulge the location via word of mouth, written letter, pensive memory, or placing it on a map. If I break this oath, willingly or through coercion all memory I have will of this secret fade into nothingness. Do you accept my word?”
Sirius nodded and took a bite out of his sandwich. “Yes. It’s a group Dumbledore built to fight back against the Death Eaters that Mouldy Butt made to carry out his evil deeds.”
Harry’s lungs were burning and he was looking around for Sidra but he couldn’t see her,
An oath, on the other hand, is less deadly. You state the stakes. I don’t keep your secret and I lose my voice, my sight, a sum of galleons, the rights to my firstborn. That sort of stuff.”
Sidra hissed and looked around.
Sidra hissed happily,
“Madame Black adored the brackled yew vanity, and it is GONE from her room!” The greying elf wailed and Sirius sighed.
But it was too late, a being clothed in raged torn clothes flew into view, obscuring the view behind it. Harry tried to keep his breathing even, it fed on fear. He had faced worse before he could do this. Harry barely turned his face to Dudley and tried to convey ‘stay calm’ to him but Dudley either didn’t see or didn’t care, he was white as a hospital sheet and sweating like a pig trembling from head toe.
Soon enough, Harry received a letter from McGonagall with the list for his new books and supplies for the new school year.
Sidra hissed with amusement as they walked further out of the forest.
Hendret rose an eyebrow, “On larger contracts such as marriage contracts and birth certificates for your brood it will require the marks of all your rings for there to be full magical validity.”
So, Dumbledore was the secret keeper of this place before. Harry felt a spike of animosity towards yet another secret, but he pushed it back. He had to think about the now.
Harry always found it difficult to rely on his magic at the best of times, and for once by using the moon (however that worked) magic was easier. It was practically impossible to use the moon magic during the day so he was sulking under a tree in the small forest away from everyone else.
“Hm?”
“Hendret…” Harry asked frowning when there were no names above his mum’s. “Why’s this side blank?”
“Uh. No. If they do, they haven’t told me. Which honestly the theme of my life.”
Those were words whispered to him and he had to remind himself that despite
Adafrid looked apprehensive, “I was speaking to Sidra about that. And she mentioned that there was no exchange of magic at the wards. When I designed my home I made sure to have two lines of defense. First, the guardian to accept a magical offering. Which is a loose contract of civility. Next, is registering an unfamiliar magical signature. But all you did was touch the wards.”
