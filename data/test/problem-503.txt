Harry looked to Hermione, who let out a resigned sigh and said, “Well, I suppose it could be worse. See you in a bit, Harry.”
Harry grinned, warmed that Draco would think to ask Hermione, of all people, for advice. With a sudden burst of courage, he leaned over and pressed a gentle kiss to Draco’s forehead.
Harry let out a small whimper as Malfoy ground down on his erection, and his hips bucked upwards in urgency again as he tightly gripped the sheets on either side of him. “Fuck, Malfoy, please—”
“Yeah,” Harry said, smiling at different memories from the past few days, “he’s … well, he’s Draco.”
Andromeda snorted as she stood up, gathering her things. “I have a strong suspicion that Aunt Narcissa will have put out a sweet or two.”
An all-too-familiar glint appeared in Malfoy’s eyes, and he smirked as he lugged Harry’s trunk inside, gestured for Harry to follow, and then closed and locked the door behind them. “We’ll make time.”
“Good,” Draco huffed, leaning forward to pick up the takeaway menu from the coffee table before leaning back into the couch. “Now, let’s order some food to celebrate my win, shall we?”
After a moment of silence, an abrupt bark of laughter caused him to look up. Draco was laughing so hard that his entire upper body was rippling, and there were tears in his eyes. Eventually, Harry couldn’t help but join in, his stomach hurting from a combination of deep giggling and violent waves of butterflies at the sight of seeing Draco so relaxed.
Harry hadn’t expected a note. He hadn’t expected a goodbye, either, for that matter. He’d figured that Malfoy would be in a rush to board the Hogwarts Express and get home to his mother for the Christmas holidays, and he’d accepted that. Besides, it wasn’t like they were anything serious—a few fucks here and there, and nothing more. They never spoke nor interacted outside of their professorly duties, and that was fine.
There, he set Stockinette on the counter and then dug a piece of parchment, an ink pot, and a quill out from one of the drawers.
“Ha-ha,” Harry said dryly as he briefly wandered into the kitchen, only to return a moment later with a takeaway menu in hand. “Listen, you only won because I haven’t been on a broom in forever.”
It wasn’t until halfway through the large group of students that the bell above the door chimed, and in walked Draco. Harry couldn’t help but notice the way his plaid chinos hugged his long legs and how perfectly his light blue jumper fell over his slender frame.
When Harry woke, the world was silent, the earth covered in a fresh layer of snow. Pale overcast light fell in through the crack in his curtains, highlighting small particles of dust floating through the still air. A blanket of coldness hung over the bedroom, sinking into Harry’s hands and seeping into his spine, and he burrowed further under the covers.
They moved at a steady pace, eventually making their way down the grand staircase. Turning left, they headed into the dining room. Ron had taken a seat in one of the ornately carved chairs, and his face lit up as soon as he saw the two of them walk into the room. Harry couldn’t help but smile back.
“Very interesting,” Andromeda said softly, leaning into the back of the couch. “Merlin, I haven’t seen Draco in years ― not since he was four or five, I suppose. What’s he like?”
warn you. Now, would you rather work on the toy train that needs to go in the front window or the tree that’s to go near the back? I don’t mind.”
A thick silence fell over the room, and Harry watched as Draco ducked his head, absently picking at a dropped stitch. He could see the shame in Draco’s face, his cheeks blotchy from embarrassment.
Background chatter filled the air around him, people of all ages arranging themselves at the long wooden table Harry had transfigured in the middle of the shop. While he always enjoyed hosting the beginners workshop every other month, there was a small part of him that couldn’t shake the disappointment of Draco not showing up.
“It’s beautiful,” Draco agreed as he followed Harry to the check-out counter. “Has it been hand dyed?”
“Oh, I suppose one of us should ask the other person out,” Malfoy said. “Although that’s completely optional. We could always stick to snogging under trees and secret rendezvous, if you’d like.”
After a minute or two, Harry pulled back, panting, and looked up at Draco, his heart pounding in his chest. “We’ve got some time before we’ve got to get to the Manor. Want to go back to mine?”
“How did you even know about the Tower of London Ice Rink? That’s where we’re going, isn’t it ―?” Harry asked.
,” Draco began, a violent blush rising to his cheeks as he looked at everyone on the porch, “what’s this?”
Teddy nodded eagerly in response as his hands began to make a grabby motion in the direction of the dinner rolls.
Draco raised his wand, a soft white glow forming at the tip as all of the snow flurries in the air were sucked back into it, leaving the shop pristine and snowflake-free.
As they stood surrounded in a whirl of white, Harry swore he could feel his heartbeat everywhere, thudding heavily from his eardrums to the tips of his fingers. And, for the first time, he didn’t quite hate that Draco was so much taller than him ― something that had always bothered him during their days at Hogwarts. In fact, it was nice being able to look up into his stone colored eyes, which Harry couldn’t manage to stop staring into. Only a few centimeters closer, and they would be kissing ―
Draco sighed. “My family isn’t like yours, Potter. We ordinarily don’t get to choose who we marry. My father had arranged the whole ordeal right before the battle, wanting to ensure that I would lead a good, noble life. My parents were lucky when they were engaged, as they happened to actually love one another. Astoria and I, though … we were a different story. There was a fierce friendship between us, but nothing more. Besides, she was in love with someone else.”
Harry sighed, crouching so that he was eye-level with Teddy. “That’s true. Has Granny told you about them?”
Before he knew it, he was stumbling onto the wet ground. Draco landed on top of him, knocking all air out of his lungs.
Harry spent the next several minutes pulling the jumper onto Teddy and then helping him with his socks and shoes. As soon as Teddy was fully dressed, he darted off of his bed and planted himself in front of the mirror hanging from the back of his door. There, he began testing out different hair colors, eventually landing on mint green.
“I don’t know, Pans.” Draco sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Sure, he’s friendly towards me, although I suppose he has to be. I threatened to decorate his living room in taxidermied deer heads the other day because he was chewing his sandwich too loudly.”
Once the cereal box was upright on the coffee table, Harry wandered towards the hallway. Poking his head down it, he could hear Teddy blowing raspberries from the direction of his bedroom and Andromeda sighing in what could only be described as a horrible cocktail of exhaustion and stress.
Draco offered her a hesitant smile, warming Harry’s heart. Although he’d forgiven Draco the moment he’d walked into the shop, there had been a part of him worrying about how Ron and Hermione would react.
As the late morning slowly inched towards midday, Harry found himself glancing in Draco’s general direction several times, each sending a violent wave of butterflies through his stomach. Draco was still struggling, dropping stitches left and right, and the beginning of his scarf looked more like a lopsided potholder than anything else. Meanwhile, everyone else was continuing to move along just fine, and Harry wasn’t worried about them getting the hang of knitting in the slightest. In fact, the only person he was concerned about was Draco.
“Alright, everyone! Amazing work. You’ve all done a great job and should be very proud of yourselves. Thank you so much for coming, and please don’t hesitate to pop into the shop if you need any help with your projects,” Harry said, grinning.
After coming to terms with the fact that continuing to poke and prod at his hair was only making things worse, Harry set down his comb and wandered into the living room. There, he spotted Stockinette in a loaf position on the coffee table, her legs politely tucked underneath her body. She stared at him, her head cocked slightly to the left as if to insinuate that Harry was moving far too slowly this morning.
Draco sodding Malfoy. He looked better than he had the last time Harry had seen him, which had been at his trial seven years ago. Malfoy had looked worn then, his skin sallow and taut and a dull look in his pewter colored eyes. Now, though, there was a light about him, as though someone had flipped a switch. His soft, ashy blond hair was cropped just above his ears, shorter than it had been, and the frown lines that had riddled his face were now faded.
Just as he finished attaching the other end of the streamers to the top of the wall, Harry heard a soft rapping sound. Turning on the ladder in the direction of the sound, he saw a petite snowy owl waiting patiently outside the front of the shop, her large black eyes looking glassy through the window pane.
He didn’t even have a significant other to confide in. He and Ginny hadn’t lasted long after the war had ended, both deciding that they worked better as friends. A few months after their breakup, news had traveled that Ginny and Luna had begun dating. Now, a year and a half later, they were still together. And Harry was happy for them ― he was ― however, although he was no longer romantically interested in Ginny, he couldn’t help but think about the fact that he could’ve been her love in another life. One where he was attracted to her, and she was attracted to him.
And so, for the past two years, he’d been stuck living one room away from his childhood enemy who, truth be told, wasn’t quite as awful as he’d expected.
“Everything is pretty good. The shop is incredibly popular at the moment, so business is booming. Actually, though, something interesting has happened lately. Draco has been coming around the shop, and I’ve begun teaching him how to knit,” Harry said.
After they ordered, Amelia having been nothing but pleasant towards a disguised Draco, they received their drinks and then headed back into the numbing afternoon. Harry wrapped his shawl tighter around his exposed neck, desperate for some semblance of warmth. Luckily, the hot chocolate was charmed to remain at the perfect temperature, warming his insides without being too hot.
They spent thirty more minutes browsing the shelves of Flourish and Blotts before Harry landed on four books for Hermione. Surprisingly, Draco picked up a book of his own,
Harry nodded in agreement. “I was thinking the same thing. I’ve got to admit that I’m also eyeing the lemon tart.”
“Okay,” Draco said, casting a lubrication spell on his right fingers as he knelt in between Harry’s thighs. “I’ll let you know when I’m about to do something, alright?”
Draco shifted forward, one hand moving to Harry’s chest and the other to the nape of Harry’s neck. “Well, that’s awfully convenient.”
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just anxious to get there,” Harry lied as he began to pick up his knitting again. “I’m really excited to see
Teddy nodded enthusiastically as Harry headed over to his closet and began to comb through the various shirts and jumpers hanging up. Halfway through the rack, Harry landed on a jumper he’d made Teddy for his sixth birthday. It had been knitted out of light brown alpaca and mohair, and Harry had embroidered a black colored dog, not unlike Sirius’ Animagus, onto the front. He unhooked the jumper’s hanger from the rack and faced Teddy, holding it up with a smile.
With a heavy sigh, Harry wandered to the back room, grabbing a ladder before setting it up against the right wall of the shop and beginning to string white and red streamers across the ceiling. Once he had tacked one side up, he moved to the opposite wall, the bright colors standing out against the dark wooden beams.
When Harry woke the following morning, he found his mouth full of fur. After taking a moment to gather his surroundings, he realized that Stockinette had spread out on the pillow next to him, her tail lounging across Harry’s lips. He sat up, aggressively combing his tongue with his fingers in an attempt to free it of any rogue hairs. He had little luck.
After ten minutes of polite chatter passed, the risotto had finished cooking, and Harry led Draco to the dining table. Stockinette decided to join them as they took their seats, circling around Draco’s chair and eventually curling up at his feet.
He sat in a stupor and drank coffee while the porridge cooked, occasionally casting a glance at the clock hanging on the wall to make sure that he was alright for time. By nine o’clock, he’d chucked on his coat and a matching set of a grey scarf, gloves, and a beanie that Molly had knitted for him several years ago. Then, stuffing his keys and wallet into his satchel, he headed out the door of his flat, down the stairs of the building, and out into the brisk morning.
Harry walked quickly to the front of the shop, letting down the blinds and locking the door before lifting his wand into the air and turning off the train and Christmas tree lights with one smooth flick. Then, once he had scooped Stockinette into his arms and beckoned for Draco to follow him, he headed into the back room and up the stairs, unlocking the door to his flat.
Harry reluctantly dragged himself over to where Malfoy was, although he made sure to stand a good few meters away. Even so, he could smell Malfoy’s aftershave — orange and pine — and he tried to reassure himself that it was normal to feel enraptured by the way his childhood enemy smelled.
He’d paired the jumper with a pair of simple, form fitting black jeans and brown oxfords, not knowing just how formal he was supposed to look. However, he figured it would be better to be overdressed in front of Narcissa Malfoy instead of underdressed.
“Me too,” Draco said, briefly lifting Stockinette off his lap so he could readjust his position. “It was my nickname as a child. I think it reminds her of happier times.”
“Oh, sweetheart,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hands in his own, “of course. Thank you so much for making it for me.”
“Yeah,” Ron said, standing up from the couch. “I took the liberty of giving Stockinette a small snack while you were getting changed.”
Then, he handed Harry a much smaller present. Harry took it, feeling its surprising weight in the palm of his hand. As he unwrapped it, he racked his brain for what it could be, but it wasn’t until he pulled the amber colored glass Snitch out that he put two and two together.
McWeenie pulled a crumpled sheet of parchment from his pocket and held it up. “Here we are! Quiet, now! I’m going to begin reading the pairs off. Penelope Clearwater and Marina Sanchez! Rowan Khanna and Chester Davies! Hermione Granger and Susan Bones!”
They made their way out of the alley and onto Grafton Street, which was filled with shoppers, street musicians singing Christmas carols, and flower vendors. The air was heavy with rain, although it had stopped lashing for the time being, and a strong wind was rolling over the city. Glittering lights hung above the street from buildings on either side, and the words
As she took a seat in the armchair to the left of the couch, she said, “please, call me Hermione. And of course, Draco. Anyone who’s a friend of Harry’s is a friend of ours.”
is a pretty popular brand, so I have to collect inventory from them relatively often. I usually have it sent to the shop, but Laoise invited me to see their new merino sheep. I’ve never been, so it’ll be interesting to see what the farm looks like,” Harry said.
Once Harry and Draco had shrunken their bags down to a far more reasonable size and stuffed them into Hermione’s handbag when she wasn’t looking, they began their venture back to Harry’s flat.
As Hermione raised her wand, Harry felt a cool sensation roll over his body. He ran his fingers through his hair, which wasn’t nearly as greasy as it had been before, and he let out a heavy sigh.
Teddy pointed to a heap on the ground, which Harry quickly recognized as a stiff collared shirt. He didn’t blame Teddy for not wanting to wear it, although he could also understand why Andromeda wanted Teddy to look particularly nice. It was a big night, after all.
Walking into the shop, he was immediately hit with the sweet, aromatic smell of roses. The right wall was made up of a refrigerator, which was filled to the brim with a variety of flowers. Harry recognized a few, such as baby’s breath, gardenias, and lilies. The rest of the shop was filled with premade floral arrangements and bouquet accessories, all looking rather attractive in the silver light that fell through the broad front window.
Harry and Draco were led into a relatively small room in the back of the house, which was filled to the brim with large cardboard boxes. Laoise pulled down two boxes from the top of a stack in the right corner of the room, plopping them down in front of Harry and opening the flaps. Inside were several dye lots of different colored fingering yarn. All of the skeins were rich in color, ranging from deep forest green to a light seafoam, and they contained white and grey speckles. Another color that jumped out at him was a burnt orange, its smokiness making it pop against the rest of the skeins.
He’d been fine before. Successful, comfortable, content. Now, though, having gone a full twenty-five days with Draco back in his life, he couldn’t remember a time when he’d been happier. This wasn’t to say that his joy depended on Draco, because it certainly didn’t ― he couldn’t just discount the shop, Stockinette, Ron, Hermione, the rest of the Weasleys, Andromeda and Teddy, as well as all of the progress he’d made over the years. However, it was worth noting that life had far more color nowadays, and Harry knew it was all thanks to Draco.
Draco nodded. “Yes. I’m truly surprised that no one in the workshop said anything to me. I suppose it was because they were all so invested in their work.”
Harry glared at his cat, who was in the midst of climbing into an empty cardboard box that had been full of new knitting books. She glowered at him in return before promptly hopping inside.
Several minutes passed before Harry, who realized his watch had vanished with his clothes, spoke. “Do you know the time?”
As he rode Potter, thrusting himself down on his cock as deeply as possible, Draco reached down to wrap his hand around his own length. He began to pump his hand, adjusting his movements so that it was in time with Potter’s movements.
Pansy snorted before taking a long sip of her lavender latte. “Whatever you need to tell yourself, love.”
And maybe that was enough. Maybe it was alright that these moments were as close to a relationship as Harry was going to get. Maybe he didn’t want fine dining, or movie nights, or just sitting together while they graded their students’ essays. Maybe being nearly there was all he could afford to have.
. Please, just let me teach you how to do it. Then, after a few goes, you can decide whether you like it or not. If you hate it, I won’t push you.”
The day was warm and sticky as mid-morning light fell over the wide meadow. Harry dabbed at the large beads of sweat that were rolling down the back of his neck, and Hermione took a long swig of water from her flask. They, along with the rest of the Ministry office heads, had been roped into a mandatory weekend retreat that was supposed to focus on unity, team building, and interpersonal relationships. However obvious it was that
Rolling his eyes, Harry turned back to his task at hand ― decorating the shop. He had closed up an hour ago, and while there was nowhere he’d rather be than in his bed, he needed to get the holiday decorations done.
“Oh, good! I love Cauldron Cakes!” Teddy said before turning to Draco. “Do you like Cauldron Cakes?”
Draco’s cheeks warmed, and he let out a huff of nervous laughter. “Yeah, well, I think the Felix Felicius is beginning to wear off …”
Harry and Hermione exchanged a look, both of them knowing that Draco did, indeed, need help if he had any hope of finishing his scarf.
After hopping on his train, he arrived at his stop thirty minutes later. Weaving his way in between clusters of people on the platform, he made his way up the stairs and onto the street, turning right. Down the road a little ways, he could make out a wooden sign jutting out from one of the shops up ahead, reading
And, instantaneously, Harry knew that none of this had been a sudden, spur-of-the-moment development. He’d been, in fact, falling in love with Draco Malfoy for years. One of his most painful memories, that of the Astronomy Tower all those years ago, crossed his mind, and he realized that he’d seen then the same version of Draco that he was seeing now; scared, and with a lot to lose.
“I’m fine,” Harry said nonchalantly, although he knew the slight chattering of his teeth easily gave him away.
Scooping Stockinette into his arms, Harry carried her out into the living room and plopped down on the couch. She quickly wriggled her way out of his arms, making a beeline for the back of the couch. There, her lanky silver body spread out, and she silently fell asleep.
Without pausing, Harry said, “Of course I do. Listen, you were a shithead in school, and you made some fucked up decisions, but I’ve also realized that you were a kid when the war happened, just like me. You were only doing what was asked of you by your parents and by Voldemort ―”
“Yeah, actually. How would you feel about coming over on the 20th to help us put together some arrangements?” Draco asked.
Draco complied, his hips snapping deeper and faster. Harry let out a whine as Draco’s cock hit a certain spot inside him, sending sharp tendrils of pleasure throughout his body.
An hour passed before Draco showed up, politely knocking on the door and then stepping inside. Harry nearly fell off of the ladder, staring so intently at the way Draco’s crisp collared shirt was tucked neatly into his form-fitting trousers that he lost balance, only barely managing to right himself again.
“Alright, salmon should be done. You can tell me more about this mystery man over dinner. Now, come help me set the table, you two.”
It wasn’t until the Hogwarts Expresses’ horn blew clear and loud that they pulled back, looking at each other. Malfoy’s cheeks were flushed pink and his chest rapidly rising and falling, and he carefully brushed a curl away from Harry’s face.
Hermione lifted up a deep purple hat. “Ron’s Christmas present. I made him promise he’d pretend to be surprised.”
“Settle down, you two,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes as she knelt down and stroked Stockinette. “So, where are we headed to for dinner?”
They eventually made their way through the meadow and onto the forest trail, which was surrounded by tall oak trees and long, sun-kissed grass. Harry spotted a small creek shimmering in the distance, and the soft sounds of birds tweeting and deer running across the underbrush filled the sweet summer air.
Oh! And a little surprise for anyone who's interested in knitting: the hat that Harry is going to knit Draco for Christmas will be coming to life! I’m designing it, and my wife Emma will be making it and then publishing the pattern on Ravelry at some point in the near-ish future!
Malfoy let out a long exhale as he settled into the grass next to him. The silence that fell between them was heavy and tense, and Harry’s stomach lurched as he continued to stare out at the stream, hoping that he wasn’t about to make a further fool out of himself.
Harry let out an embarrassed laugh. “You’re one to talk, Laoise. You and Oisín have been in business for what, two years? And you’ve already gathered a huge following. You’re easily one of the most popular yarn brands out there.”
Andromeda grabbed a tissue from the box on the coffee table, dabbing at the tears streaming down her face as she said, “it’s not that, Harry. They’re beyond worth it, which is why I’m too scared to reach out. I don’t want to feel the loss all over again. I’ve worked too many years to stuff it down.”
Standing up again, he slowly approached Curry. She wearily eyed him as he began to hold out the grass before deciding that hunger won out over suspicious strangers. She took a few steps forward and started eating the grass, her lips tickling against the palm of Harry’s hand.
Wandering into the kitchen, which was only separated from the living room by a marble island, Harry set the wine down on the counter. Then, he settled onto the couch and waited.
“We have,” Harry said, glancing down at his wrist watch, “thirty minutes until we have to open the shop back up.”
“I’ve ruled out the possibility, Harry,” Andromeda said, her voice breaking as tears threatened to spill over. “I doubt Cissy wants to see me, especially after everything that’s happened, and I don’t want to pressure her into healing wounds that she isn’t ready to. Plus, too much time has passed for us to ever reconcile, and I’ve accepted that. I’ve got Teddy now ― and you of course, love ― and that’s all that matters.”
Harry leaned forward, their foreheads pressed together, and let out a soft breath. “May I kiss you?”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut and took a deep breath, willing the stirring in his trousers to die down. After a moment, he opened his eyes again and checked his wristwatch, which read five past ten. Only fifty-five minutes until the train disembarked from the station, and he had a decision to make.
“Things are busy, but good. My customers seem to really be enjoying all of the decorations we put up. I get comments everyday on the toy train you set out,” Harry said, grinning at the memory before turning more solemn. “I’ve missed you being there, though.”
Wind rushed up below him as he hurtled to the fast approaching ground. Halfway down, he managed to shove his broom beneath him and pull out of the dive, swiftly coming to a stop next to Draco.
As Draco stepped out of the Floo, Harry did a double take. Draco wasn’t wearing his usual smart jumper and tight trousers, but was instead clad in an outfit rather similar to Harry’s. He had on a wooly jumper that had patches on the elbows and classy black joggers that must have cost him at least thirteen Galleons. However, in his right hand was his old, familiar Nimbus 2001.
“Sounds good to me. How about you, Andromeda, and Teddy come over to The Manor at around five? We can have dinner together,” Draco said.
Their ice skating date was a disaster ― a true, magnificent disaster that resulted in what would likely be many bruises and a slightly deflated ego for Draco, who fell more times than Harry could count. Harry, however, wasn’t much better, and while he happily would’ve accepted help from a penguin skating aid, Draco outright refused to sink to that level, claiming that he “certainly did not need something meant for children.”
“I guess?” Draco said. “I’ve got a career, and friends, and a nice place to live — although my flatmate can sometimes be a bit of a prat—”
Draco snorted. “Ah yes, says the same man who accused me of being the heir to Slytherin without waiting to find any actual proof.”
Oisín nodded. “Yeah, they do. The orange is Laoch, the green is Eachtránaí, the light blue is Claíomh …”
No one noticed, nor questioned, when they both stood up from the couch and wandered out into the back garden, taking a seat on the marble bench in the reeds. Draco cast a Heating Charm, as well as a charm to deflect the snow, which was coming down in velvety bouts.
“Alright,” Draco said hesitantly. “Well, I wasn’t doing much for about the first year, to be honest ― mostly just putting about the Manor, I suppose. In spring of ‘99 I found a job at Borgin and Burkes, but that only lasted so long. Too many memories.
Harry squeezed Draco’s arm. “Well, I’m glad we did. I don’t know what I would do without you. I mean, who else would be willing to go to London Zoo with me every other weekend?”
Draco’s eyes flicked upwards, catching Harry’s. “Yes, I know the feeling. Who are you winding with?”
“Get on your knees, then, and turn around. It’s a good position to use during your first time,” Draco instructed.
Oisín nodded, pointing to a particular sheep that was milling nearby. “Yep. See that one? Her name is Curry, and she’s one of our oldest Shetland sheep. We’ve still got around ten of them left.”
“So, Harry,” Hermione began, setting her book down. “Are things still going well between you and Draco? I feel like we didn’t get a chance to speak properly last night.”
“You’re too kind,” Laoise said, gesturing for them to take a seat at the table. “I was just about to put the kettle on. Do either of you want tea or coffee?”
The note wasn’t exactly enough to answer Harry’s questions, leaving him with the predicament of deciding whether he should go see what the bloody fuck was so important that it needed to be given right before he left, or if he should simply ignore it until he, as well as the rest of the Hogwarts faculty and students, returned after New Year’s.
The rest of their walk was quiet, and Harry led them to Bewley’s, a cafe and company known for their teas. Inside was warm, and Harry could feel his fingers beginning to thaw out as they wandered up to the host.
Harry watched as Draco’s slender fingers deftly unwrapped the package, revealing a medium sized box. Draco looked up, arching an eyebrow out of curiosity, before continuing to unwrap, working his way through the Spellotape. Then, as soon as Draco folded back the box flaps, Draco let out a bark of laughter, pulling out the cauldron with a dragon painted on its side that they’d spotted at the craft fair.
“Fuck, Malfoy. Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Potter murmured, his hips buckling upwards to meet Draco’s thrusts. Draco let out a loud gasp as the tip of Potter’s cock hit his prostate, sending sharp, overwhelming waves of pleasure to his fingertips and toes. Draco couldn’t see, couldn’t breathe; the only thing that mattered was the feeling of pure, unadulterated rapture that was spreading through him as Potter thrust harder and deeper.
Malfoy pulled back, and they looked at each other. There was something indescribable behind Malfoy’s eyes, like a light that Harry hadn’t noticed before, and it was enough to fill his chest with a strange, unrecognizable warmth. And, as Malfoy began to move, thrusting hard and deliberately, Harry expected the feeling in his chest to dissipate, but it didn’t. Instead, it only grew stronger with each motion.
.” Draco sucked in a sharp breath at the feeling of cold air meeting his now naked body. Potter shifted forward, going in for another kiss, but Draco paused. Slowly, his eyes made their way down to Potter’s long, thick cock, which was laying heavily against his stomach and leaking precome onto his skin. Draco bit his lip to stop himself from letting out an audible groan at the sight.
“Merlin, you’re a sight for sore eyes. We’ve missed you around here,” Andromeda said, the wrinkles around her eyes crinkling as she smiled warmly.
“Morning, Stocky,” Harry said softly, scratching her quickly behind the ear before turning back to his bare parchment.
“Oh,” Draco said, frowning. “Well, my mother started a floral arrangement company three years ago, and I help her with that.”
Harry sucked in a sharp breath, his eyes tracing Draco’s words over at least three times before setting the letter beside him on the duvet. Looking up, he saw that Colette was blinking at him with bright, hopeful eyes, somewhat reflective of how his mood had shifted since reading the letter. Draco’s words had managed to be a great comfort, although there was a lingering question that needed to be addressed.
After stepping through the front door and into the heavy downpour of rain, Harry hastily took out his keys and locked the door behind them. When he glanced up, Draco was giving him a funny look.
Harry, once again being the last to use the Floo, fell stumbling into his living room and directly into Draco’s back. Harry did his best to right himself as quickly as possible, but the damage was done. Draco turned around, eyebrows quirked.
After walking past Eyelops Owl Emporium, briefly pausing to take a look through the frosty window, they entered Broomstix. Harry let out a sigh of relief, the warmth of the shop pricking at his half-numb extremities.
“Long story short, Draco came into the shop on Saturday while you two were busy with customers. He was looking for yarn for Narcissa, and since then I’ve begun teaching him how to knit. I was … well … I was wondering if he could come over for dinner as well, and we could do some knitting afterwards while we discussed the shop,” Harry said.
Before he knew it, he had slipped into the brink of sleep, flashes of blonde hair and pale skin appearing behind his eyelids.
TW - smut! Easily skippable and towards the end of the chapter! Also, very mild angst! But like, VERY mild! No fretting is needed!
Andromeda gave a small laugh, and she mussed his hair. “No, sweetheart, Granny doesn’t have an ouchie.”
filling the air. Draco, of course, managed to make several comments saying that The Weird Sisters’ Christmas album was far superior, resulting in many eye rolls and rude gestures from Harry.
As Fridays were the one day a week where the Whomping Willow Woolery was closed, Harry spent the morning unpacking several shipments of wool, skein winders, pattern books, and handy bits and bobs that made knitting just a little easier. It took him an hour to go through the first large cardboard box, getting lost in Fariza Hatterman’s new shawl book. The patterns were stunning, mosaic patterns craftily wound into crescent, square, triangle, and circle segment shapes, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from daydreaming of making them. However, reality hit like a freight train as he abruptly remembered the sheer amount of projects he had currently going on, causing him to begrudgingly close the book and move onto the next cardboard box.
Just as he had moved from the first wall of cubby holes to the second, Harry heard the bell above the door go off. Confused as to who would be coming by mere moments before closing, he looked up and was met with a sight he hadn’t expected.
After the last customer, a middle-aged man who was a regular shopper, left, Harry checked his watch, which read five minutes until closing time. With a sigh, he reluctantly gave up on the idea that he would see Draco and forced his thoughts to move on, concentrating on neatening up the cubby holes that were dwindling concerningly low. He made a mental note to order more yarn, specifically merino wool from a small indie brand named Babbity Rabbity’s Ravelry.
As soon as Draco lowered his mouth onto the head of Harry’s penis, Harry knew he wasn’t going to last long. Draco slowly began to bob his head up and down the length of Harry’s prick, his hand moving in unison. Harry could feel the fire that had started to spread in his abdomen rapidly building, and the muscles in his thighs were tightening. It was as though there were a thousand currents running through him, sparks pooling in the tips of his fingers and his toes.
Harry reached across the table, pointing to the dessert section. As he was pulling his hand away, his fingers brushed with Draco’s, and a wave of warmth rushed over him. He reluctantly moved his fingers away, stuffing them in his lap in an attempt to drown out the urge to hold Draco’s hand.
By the time Draco had reached the end of his sentence, fits of giggles were escaping from his mouth, and his cheeks were a bright red. Looking at him, Harry wished he could freeze the moment in time, capturing it with a thousand photographs. There was a light to Draco’s eyes that he’d found comfort in, and seeing it now gave him a similar feeling to that of coming home after a long day.
After a minute of tense silence, Hermione rounded the corner, dressed in fitted jeans and a burnt orange jumper that Harry had knit for her a while back.
Reluctantly leaving the bathroom, Harry wasted the next five minutes kissing a squirming Stockinette, channeling all of his nervous energy into telling her what a good girl she was.
Harry, with his eyebrows raised, confusedly began to open the package, quickly pulling out the very last thing he’d expected. In his hands was a hat, which looked more like a …
As soon as Andromeda had slung her handbag full of coloring books, crayons, and odd dolls, the three of them wandered towards the fireplace. Harry hung back, expecting Andromeda and Teddy to go first, but Andromeda simply stared.
Harry glanced down at his wrist watch, which read 3:57, and winced. Draco would be arriving any minute, and the sheer knowledge of that sent a wave of anxiety through him. Not sure if Draco was going to be wearing something casual for flying or actual Quidditch gear didn’t help Harry’s fears either, especially as he’d gone on to dress only in a yellow hoodie, grey joggers, and ratty trainers that had seen better days.
Harry was taken aback at his bluntness, and he recoiled slightly. “That makes sense. Do you … like flowers?”
After locking up the shop, Harry looked towards the sky, which was threatening to unload a heavy wave of rain. The day was cold and wet, and the bitter wind blowing from the north bit at Harry’s skin. Frowning at the chill in the air, he led Draco in the direction of Florean Fortescue’s Ice-Cream Parlor.
Glancing at one of the cubby holes filled with fingering yarn, he stood up and wandered over to it. He’d seen a new beanie pattern floating around the knitting community that he was dying to try out. It was called Grá, and it was made of stranded colorwork, creating rows of flowers, leaves, and diamonds around the beanie. He knew he’d need three skeins for it, so he began to poke and prod his way through the neatly stacked skeins, searching for colors that would suit Draco.
Draco could feel himself growing close—could feel himself coming undone as he looked into Potter’s green eyes. He quickened his hand’s pace, and after a few more rough strokes, he was coming, ribbons of pearly semen spilling over his fist.
He turned the glass over in his hands, cool and smooth compared to his roughness of his fingertips. Ridges had been blown in the glass to replicate the geometric design that donned the body of each Snitch, and the iridescent whiteness of the wings glowed in the honey colored light coming from the lanterns.
Draco let out a bark of dry laughter. “What, are you suggesting that I spill all of my dark secrets to you, my knitting instructor?”
“Um, well, we decided that it would be best to go to the source, so Hermione brewed Polyjuice Potion and then Ron and I disguised ourselves as Crabbe and Goyle and snuck into the Slytherin common room,” Harry said meekly, staring at the wool in his hands.
“Look,” Malfoy began, letting out a weary sigh. “I don’t know how to do feelings. I don’t know how to be romantic, or make you feel special, or show you that I care—”
After giving her a quick kiss on the head, Harry threw on a cardigan he’d knit out of worsted grey wool a few years back over his maroon reindeer pajamas. Then, once he’d shuffled into his slippers, he lifted his wand from the nightstand and went about sending Draco a Patronus message.
Ron snorted, shifting towards Hermione. “Merlin, at the rate you, Mum, and Harry are working, my wardrobe is going to be entirely made up of knitwear by the end of the year.”
Roughly clearing his throat, he set the magazine down on the table before turning his attention to his appallingly expensive cappuccino and croissant. “I don’t drool.”
Draco shook his head. “No, we’ll have plenty. December is always our busiest month, with the Winter Ball, business parties, get-togethers. We’re always worn out by the time New Year’s comes around.”
A large, pale moon sat flushed against the wine colored sky, casting deep shadows across the night as they made their way down the street. Harry huddled into his shawl, desperate to get some semblance of relief from the strong gusts of northern wind.
,” Draco laughed incredulously as he pulled the beanie onto his head, a look of disbelief crossing his face. “You, the loveliest, most attractive man in the entire world, has knit me a hat, and you’re asking if it’s
A loud poof coming from the direction of the living room alerted him that he was no longer alone with his thoughts.
After propping the window open, Draco climbed through it and sat with his bum on the ledge as he held his broom out underneath him. Before Harry could ask if he was all set, he pushed himself off of the ledge, dropping out of sight.
Harry raised his eyebrows, surprised at the question. Although he’d been very open with Andromeda about his interest in both men and women, he wasn’t exactly comfortable telling her about the fact that he fancied her nephew. Not yet, anyway.
, though?” Draco whispered through gritted teeth. “What the fuck were you thinking? Where did you even
Harry did just that, tucking himself under one of Molly’s various knitted blankets. “I take it no one else is awake?”
Harry let out a courteous laugh. “Well, thank you for putting together such an amazing evening. I’m sure I’ll see you around.”
By the time he Apparated to Potter’s, a warmth had spread rapidly through his body, and there was a loud, persistent buzzing in his chest. He felt loose, and calm, and
They continued to chat and knit for another hour and a half, Draco occasionally taking a break to scratch Stockinette, who had hopped onto the couch and settled in at his side. All the while, Harry couldn’t help but churn the idea of domesticity over in his mind. Despite Draco having only come over to Harry’s flat a few times, it already felt like a comfortable routine that he didn’t want to end.
McWeenie, who had been making his rounds, eventually wandered over to their area. His face was an unattractive shade of pink and he was wearing his bright, artificial smile as he approached, causing Harry’s stomach to drop.
He felt a surge of serotonin as soon as the pads of his fingers graced over the soft, forest green and cream colored cashmere wool of the left glove. Like many of his projects, the gloves were mosaic, rectangular patterns rippling across the body of them. Although he had more projects going on than he cared to admit, several of them sitting in time-out at the back of his knitting closet due to frustration, gloves were an easy, mindless project that he found to be extremely helpful after a full day of work. When he had more energy, he tended to focus on his mustard yellow jumper, working from the top down. The yoke of the jumper, a robin blue leaf pattern stemming from the cusp of the neckline and stopping at the bottom of the chest, required a bit more attention and brainwork, although he didn’t mind. He hadn’t yet reached the sleeves of the jumper, which he was grateful for, as they were known among the knitting world for being some of the longest, most boring knitting work one could do. In fact, Harry often referred to it as Sleeve Island, desperate to become unstranded from rows upon rows of the same stitch.
Harry looked down at the letter in his trembling hands, and a weary sigh escaped his lips. Before he could lose his nerve, he peeled open the envelope and pulled out the letter.
Their Chinese food arrived via owl an hour later, which Harry was eternally grateful for given how hungry he was. After retrieving plates from the kitchen and sinking back into the couch, Harry began to split their shared sesame chicken, steamed rice, and spring rolls. Stockinette, becoming rather curious herself, nimbly hopped from Draco’s lap to the coffee table, where she proceeded to delicately sniff the food being served.
“Harry! It’s so good to see you again,” Laoise said, pulling Harry in for a brief hug before turning her attention to Draco. “And you must be Draco, Harry’s friend. He wrote us last night saying you were tagging along. Why don’t you two come on in? You must be freezing out here.”
Also, still SOBBING over the love and support this has been shown so far. Thank you all so, so much for taking the time to read, comment, and leave kudos <3
’ new collection, which is called Cróga ― Irish for brave. It’s fingering weight and should be amazing for mosaic work. The owners are a couple, Oisín and Laoise. Just a heads up that Oisín is agender and uses the pronouns they/them.”
Harry recoiled at the venom in his voice before steadying himself. “That’s not true, Malfoy. I can see that you’re doing everything you can to move on from who you were as a child, and I know that you wish you could undo things. I saw you apologize to Hermione and Ron, remember? If you hadn’t changed, you wouldn’t have explained to them how sorry you are.”
The familiar fierceness that had always lingered behind Draco’s eyes in their days at Hogwarts returned, and Harry swore he could see the hint of a smile.
Harry frowned, not sure what to say due to both the heartache Draco must’ve felt and his own irrational jealousy.
“She’s pretty happy. I’ve woken up to her sleeping on Draco’s chest for the last three days ―” Harry started before cutting himself off as Hermione arched an eyebrow and Ron opened his eyes.
Harry paused, also setting down his plate before looking intently at Draco. He was struck by the vulnerability in Draco’s voice, and there was something akin to fear lingering in his words that caused Harry’s own heart to break in two.
Molly rolled her eyes, shifting a tin of Christmas biscuits the size of a medium tire from one hip to the other as she turned to Harry. “Darling, you really don’t think Mal ―
Harry waved a hand dismissively in the air. “Nonsense. Listen, it’s been years since the war. It might take a little getting used to, but I’ve no doubt that Ron and Hermione will warm up to you. I can ask them through the Floo if it’s alright. Come on, follow me.”
As he contemplated the horrid concept of moving from his warm, luscious bed, he heard a small pitter coming from the direction of the hallway. Smiling, he clicked his tongue.
Harry closed the shop up at 3:30 before heading up to his flat with Ron and Hermione. The late afternoon was misty and cold, silver shadows falling over the city of London. From Harry’s living room window, he could see wixens milling about Diagon Alley, many of them heading in the direction of Fortescue’s. He didn’t blame them ― the cold seeping through the walls of his flat was nearly enough to send him off in search of a steaming mug of hot chocolate, but he consoled himself by saying that he would have plenty of opportunities to get something warm to drink at the craft fair.
Just as Harry was about to head towards the room to the right, which appeared to be the dining room, he heard footsteps approaching against the walnut floors. His head snapping up, Harry saw Draco wandering towards him with an easy smile on his face.
Malfoy leaned forward, his hand tentatively reaching up to cup Harry’s cheek. Harry could feel his breath, warm and steady as their lips brushed together. It didn’t feel like fireworks, as Muggle movies so often depicted; instead, it reminded Harry of what it felt like to come home after a long day — a quiet comfortableness that settled into his bones as he climbed into bed, knowing that everything would be okay.
By the time the workshop ended at noon, most people had managed to make a decent amount of progress in their scarves, and Harry felt a rush of both excitement and proudness. Teaching this workshop was one of the biggest highlights of running the shop, and he always left it feeling much better than he had going in.
As he and Draco wandered down the steps that led into the back garden, both of their wands alight, he looked around in awe. In the near left corner sat several of what could only be described as enormous Venus flytraps. Their stalks towered at least two feet taller than Harry, and their light green heads were dotted with large purple spots. They were bumping into each other in the bitterly cold wind, causing them to snap at each other upon every impact.
“Well, I suppose we shouldn’t get into it now, but she saved me that night in the Forbidden Forest. If not for her, I wouldn’t be alive,” Harry said.
Without hesitating, Harry walked down the hall and knocked on the door before opening it. There, he found Teddy jumping on his bed and out of Andromeda’s reach, his hair color changing with each bounce.
“Well, I donated Grimmauld Place, Sirius’ childhood home, to charity a few years ago. A painter named Amber Zhao is in charge of running the home and keeping it in shape for various charity functions, so she came up with the idea of holding a Christmas craft fair there. The ticket proceeds go to several wizarding charities, and all money from art purchases go directly to the artists themselves. It’s been running for about four years now, and it’s incredible. There’s every type of craft imaginable: paintings, photography, sculptures, pottery, jewelry, artisan soaps, blown glass, and the list goes on. The fair starts tomorrow and goes until Monday. I’m going with Ron and Hermione, but I’d love it if you could join us, and I’m sure they’d feel the same way,” Harry said.
They stayed like that for a while, savouring each other as the sky faded from lilac to a powdery blue. By the time they broke apart, clusters of twinkling stars had appeared and the cool breeze had developed a nip to it. They took their time getting back into the car and turning on the engine. The headlights cut through the night as Harry navigated them back onto the road; all the while, one hand clasped Draco’s.
Harry nodded. “Did you know that I was there that night? On the Astronomy Tower. I saw everything. It was the first time I saw fear in you, and I think it was then that I began to realize you didn’t want any of it. You were stuck and had no way out.”
Harry watched as Draco’s face paled, knowing that they were skirting around the edges of dangerous territory: house arrest meant war crimes, war crimes meant loyalty to Voldemort, and loyalty to Voldemort meant prejudices that were nearly impossible to forgive.
between you two, so I’d like you to look at this as an opportunity to leave your past relationship behind you.”
,” Hermione said, looking intently at Ron, “know how much Draco means to you, and we’d be happy to get to know him better. Plus, it’s difficult to ignore the fact that he’s the first person you’ve taken an interest in since Ginny. He must be rather special.”
“Eager, are we?” Malfoy slid off of him, and Harry whined at the loss of contact as Malfoy settled on his knees in between Harry’s legs, propping them up. As Malfoy muttered cleaning, protection, and lubrication spells, Harry closed his eyes and reached a hand down to his cock, which was weeping precome onto his abdomen. He gripped it loosely, gritting his teeth as he tugged his length up and down.
, after all, and still very much the same snarky arsehole that he had attended Hogwarts with. Although Malfoy’s personality certainly hadn’t changed over the years, it was evident that his beliefs and the way he carried himself had. He’d issued in-person apologies to everyone he’d hurt while at Hogwarts and with his participation in the war — Harry included — a year after the Battle of Hogwarts had ended, and he was now an incredibly beloved Ministry employee who strongly  encouraged the understanding of Muggles and advocated for Muggle-borns and half-bloods.
As Harry wandered over, Draco glanced up, and a hesitant smile bloomed across his face. Harry, taking the chair that was located on the opposite side of the table, dragged it next to Draco and took a seat.
. He’s currently obsessed with dolls and coloring books, and he’s a ball of energy. He’s a Metamorphmagus, just like Tonks, so his hair is frequently changing color, although he’s recently been sticking with blues and greens.”
Content, Harry quickly tied the letter to Colette’s ankle before sending her back into the cold drizzle. Stockinette looked up, cocking her head to watch Colette fly off before stretching and then resettling onto Harry’s lap.
The scar that cracked across his forehead, raised white lines that stood out against his golden brown skin and ran from his right temple to his left cheekbone, had faded drastically since the defeat of Voldemort. The jagged cuts no longer looked angry, but instead as though they were finally beginning to soften into the background. And while Harry wasn’t ashamed of his scar ― he couldn’t possibly forget all that it meant ― he had found that keeping his black curls slightly longer, his fringe grazing just above his eyebrows, helped to diminish unwanted stares from strangers. Plus, a Disillusionment Charm on his scar never hurt.
He let out a weary sigh, folding the note and stuffing it into his trouser pocket before surveying his own living quarters, which looked rather clean in comparison to their usual state. He’d spent the past week slowly packing for the much-needed Christmas holidays, which he would be spending blissed out at the Burrow, eating rich foods and power-napping multiple times a day. Yet, as he thought about leaving, a sullen, melancholy feeling draped over him. Although it was his first year as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, he felt like he’d settled so readily into his role. The idea of leaving this—the castle, the students, the staff—behind for two weeks made his stomach knot more than it should have.
Rounding the corner, he paused in his tracks. There he saw Draco petting Stockinette, who was sprawled across his lap, with great pleasure. Stockinette looked to be having the time of her life, eyes closed and deep purrs emitting from her throat.
Oisín let out a bark of laughter, and they patted Draco reassuringly on the back. “Don’t worry, there’s no pressure to say hi to her. Harry, do you want to grab a handful of grass and feed it to her?”
This trick proved to be especially useful when people watching, which was a common practice on Friday afternoons. There was something oddly calming about watching passersby wander through Diagon Alley, occasionally pointing towards the Whomping Willow Woolery with bright grins on their faces.
He wandered for a while, eventually hitting a clearing that edged up against a stream. He took a seat in the long grass, leaning against the trunk of an old tree, and watched the water run swiftly over stones. Yellow wildflowers that dotted the clearing swayed gently in the wind as the evening’s last hour of light fell over the forest, blanketing the world in a soft twilight.
― Narcissa would look. Being able to physically see the years that we spent apart is more difficult than I’d imagined, and knowing that she’s lost so much time with Teddy is heartbreaking.”
“Yes?” Harry said awkwardly, feeling his cheeks warm with embarrassment. “What are you doing here? I haven’t seen you since ―”
“Wow. I didn’t realize how new the shop is. Well, seems you’ve done pretty well for yourself,” Draco said.
The crunching of twigs interrupted his thoughts. He expected to see Hermione as he glanced over his shoulder, but he couldn’t have been more wrong.
“I’m in the same boat. I haven’t seen anyone since my last boyfriend, who I dated for a few months three years ago. He was my one and only relationship after Astoria died.”
Draco turned to him, his eyes solemn, and gave him a weak smile. “Well, thankfully it’s all in the past. Now, how about we start our game?”
Harry looked to his right and saw Narcissa coming through the doorway, stopping in her tracks as soon as she saw Andromeda and Teddy. The dish towel she was holding dropped limply to the floor.
,” Draco began, his cheeks going the color of his shirt, “red does still equal Gryffindor. However, I’m trying to branch out.”
As they entered the back of the shop, a sharp chill ran through Harry’s lean body, and after setting Stockinette down and flicking on the lights, he immediately turned on the radiator and cast a Warming Charm.
They passed by an ice cream shop named Gino’s, and the air surrounding it was sweet with the rich smell of chocolate, cream, and fresh waffles. Continuing up the street, Harry noticed that Draco was unusually quiet.
Draco gave him a soft smile in return. “I have too. Mother’s been busy getting things ready for the Christmas Ball, so I’ve been helping her out with the planning portion of the order. Kingsley is convinced that this is going to be the best ball yet, so we’re really having to go all out this year. My mother hasn’t been this stressed in years.”
Harry and Draco followed Laoise into the house, and Harry nearly sighed in relief as warmth from the radiators and fire in the hearth began to seep into his numb fingertips.
At this, a crimson flush bloomed across Draco’s cheeks, and he waved a hand dismissively in the air. “Oh, for like a month. Just long enough for her to be my date to the Yule Ball.”
After a few moments, Laoise opened the door. She looked the same as she always did: strawberry blonde hair pulled up in a messy knot, beautiful vintage clothes hanging off of her large frame, and a wide smile that reached her rich brown eyes.
Harry let out a sigh of relief as he set the letter down on the checkout counter. Looking up, he saw Ron and Hermione staring at him expectantly.
“I agree to disagree,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow. “You know I’m never going to let you live this down, right?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Things don’t have to have a purpose in order for them to be useful. These cauldrons are art, just like a painting or a sculpture.”
“Yes, it is. I wrote to Hermione saying I wanted to surprise you with something fun, and she suggested going ice skating here. I’ll admit, I don’t know the first thing about ice skating,” Draco said, laughing.
Harry, caught off guard by his humor, let out a bark of laughter. “Listen, my knitting looked the same way when I first started. If you wanted, I’d be really happy to keep teaching you one-on-one. You wouldn’t have to pay for these lessons. We could just sit. And knit.”
Before Ron could protest, Hermione interjected with light laughter. “I suppose he’s got a point, Ron.”
Stockinette promptly stretched further, taking up a seemingly impossible amount of room for such a petite cat.
, and not like the Saviour that the public desperately wanted him to be — but they were also the most painful. Loving Harry hurt; it was a dull ache that never seemed to resolve itself, even after years of assuring himself that his love would always be unrequited.
Draco sighed, finally breaking eye contact with the broom. “Some days more than others, but yes. There was nothing quite like playing a Quidditch match at Hogwarts.”
He wove his way through the crowd of customers, approaching Draco, who had his back to him, at a rapid pace. Once behind him, Harry cleared his throat.
“I almost forgot,” he began, bringing them to a halt. “Andromeda wrote me back. She says she’d love to have us arrange a reunion.”
“I’m fond of that one,” Draco said, pointing to a cauldron that had a large dragon painted on the outside.
It took them a good two hours to finish, even with magic, and by the time they were done, Harry felt absolutely knackered. As they stood together in the center of the shop, their eyes taking in the glow of decorations, Harry couldn’t help but concentrate on the heat coming from Draco’s body, which was alarmingly close. Only six centimeters, and their hands would be touching.
Harry looked down, realizing what he was talking about. “Oh! That’s called ribbing, and it’s a technique that’s used for things like necklines, hat brims, and sleeve cuffs. You know how you’re making your scarf using the basic knit stitch?”
,” Harry said, knowing very well that he would be telling Ron and Hermione the next time he saw them. “Are you ready to order?”
“Okay, let’s start with the basics. This,” she said, gesturing to the ball of yarn, “is called a skein of yarn, or simply a skein for short. Skeins tend to get tangled if you don’t wind them into a ball before knitting. However, because this particular brand of yarn came from a craft shop and is on the cheaper end, it’s come prewound. If you were to get, say, a £25 skein of yarn from an established fiber arts shop, you would either need to ask someone at the shop to wind it for you, or you would need to wind it by hand ― which I would not recommend, by the way. Now, yarn comes in a variety of different sizes, textures, and what we call weights. This particular yarn is worsted, which is a medium weight, and it’s made out of wool. Go ahead, pick it up. Tell me how it feels.”
Draco was crouching beside the coffee table, running his hand along Stockinette’s spine. His navy blue and white checkered trousers fit slimly against his figure, and a well suited brown jumper clung tightly to his torso. His winter coat, as well as a dark burgundy scarf, black beanie, and black gloves had been flung onto the back of the couch, causing Harry to smile to himself.
Harry blushed further, warmth coursing through his body at the sound of his name on Draco’s tongue. Looking at him, Harry couldn’t help but long for lazy mornings in bed with him, saying his name over and over again until it no longer sounded like a word.
I can't get over how much love TWWW is getting. Thank you all so much for taking time out of your day to read, comment, and leave kudos ❤
,” Draco said softly. “Watching you … it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Even my mother isn’t as good as you, and she’s been knitting for thirty-five years.”
Not a second later, a sleek grey cat leapt onto the bed, her soft blue eyes staring intently at him. He watched as she looked around the bed, trying to decide where to settle. Eventually, she crept onto Harry’s pillow, curling herself around the crown of his head.
As his stag disappeared through the wall, Harry opened Ginny’s door and made his way downstairs. Pale, pre-dawn light fell through the windows that lined the stairwell, and Harry could make out the soft shapes of snow falling against the pewter colored sky.
He and Malfoy picked a vacant space near where the cluster of tents began. As Harry watched the other groups begin their exercise, he coolly folded his arms over his chest and said, “Right, well. I don’t want to do this with you.”
They entered the kitchen, where Oisín was seated at a small, round table. Their curly, caramel colored hair was shorter than the last time Harry had seen them, and they had a new tattoo on the side of their neck. Harry watched the tattoo as it came to life, a hippogriff spreading its sterling wings.
Once the clock on the kitchen wall struck 7:45, Harry placed his dishes in the sink before wandering back to his bedroom. There, he exchanged his pajamas for a maroon cable jumper with flecks of cream and eggplant in the wool ― handmade, of course ― and well-fitted jeans. Once dressed, he headed to the bathroom, taking a good look at himself in the mirror.
The four of them wandered over to the fireplace. Hermione was the first to pick up Floo powder and step inside, saying, “Twelve Grimmauld Place” before disappearing in a burst of green flames. Ron went next, leaving only Harry and Draco.
Hermione rolled her eyes, although she managed a bright smile. “By the way, Harry, I’m proud of you for telling everyone about you and Draco last night. How did it feel to finally get it out?”
In many ways, he wished he couldn’t pin-point the exact moment in which everything had changed, all light in his life dissolving into darkness. Perhaps it would have been easier knowing that things hadn’t become so completely different the moment he walked through the threshold of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place on the 3rd of May. The house had been stuffy and humid, and there was a thin layer of dust on every surface. Kreacher had begrudgingly welcomed Harry home, showing him up to Sirius’ old room. Harry had tried to settle into the house ― he really had ― but the feeling of ease never came.
“Right,” Harry said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. “Um, well, no. I’m single, although I wouldn’t mind a partner. How about you?”
Harry took it with a burst of nervousness, wondering what Narcissa would say to the idea of meeting up with Andromeda and Teddy.
“Thanks,” Harry said as he reached into his project bag and began to straighten out his needles. “So, is it strange seeing Andy?”
A moment later, something cool and slick circled his hole as one of his legs was lifted higher. He opened his eyes and saw that Malfoy was propping his right leg upon his shoulders, exposing him.
“Yeah, we should. I’d ideally like to be back here around 1:30. Let me just grab my stuff. I’ll be right back,” Harry said before darting back to the check-out counter.
Andromeda let out a soft laugh, wiping her falling tears on the back of her hands as she silently mouthed “thank you” before heading in the direction of the kitchen.
“I came out to my friends pretty soon after the war, and everyone was really kind about it. Hermione immediately bought me a bunch of books on being LGBT, which I still have yet to read. It wasn’t that big of a deal, though, since my mental health was declining fairly quickly at that point. Everyone had bigger things to worry about, I guess. What’s your experience been like?” Harry asked.
Harry shook his head, ushering her in the direction of the door. “We’ll be fine, Andy. Go drink a big glass of water.”
Draco leaned in, looping his arms around Harry’s waist as he pressed their noses together. “Thank you for coming, Harry ― and thank you for being mine.”
“Seems as though an affinity for Cauldron Cakes runs in the family,” Narcissa joked, her eyes meeting Andromeda’s.
Harry had been sleeping when Ron and Hermione had let themselves into the house. He had cracked his eyes open as Walburga’s portrait screamed profanities, warning him that his friends had arrived. After a second or two, her shrieking came to a halt, and Harry knew that Hermione had cast a Silencing Charm.
The cuckoo clock shoved into the back left corner of the store began to chime obnoxiously, disrupting Harry’s train of thoughts. He looked towards it, realizing that it was already nine o’clock.
“My mother is looking into getting a pet,” Draco explained. “She thinks it might help keep her occupied.”
“How does a Quidditch match sound? Just you and me, a week from tomorrow evening,” Harry said, smirking.
Just before Harry was about to look away, Draco glanced up, catching his eye. Harry watched as Draco’s pale face grew crimson in color, and he shifted away, looking flustered.
Potter let out a shuddery breath, and Draco could feel his heart hammering against his chest. “Oh God, Malfoy.
After several minutes of sifting through ideas, he finally settled on something that would be both productive and fun.
After a gentle lull had occurred in the conversation, Harry decided to bring up a subject that was entering dangerous territory.
That is, until he remembered that it was New Year’s Day, and New Year’s Day meant going over to the Burrow for a grand lunch that Molly had poured her blood, sweat, and tears into.
“Fuck me,” Harry muttered through soft pants as he peered down at Malfoy. “Please. I need you inside me.”
Draco’s cock pushed inside, ripping a low moan from Harry’s throat. The stretch he’d felt from Draco’s fingers was nothing compared to his cock. It took what felt like hours before Draco was fully inside of him, remaining stationary in order to let Harry adjust to the fullness. However, after a minute, Harry began to grow impatient, his own cock weeping with need.
“I imagine running the company is a good distraction for Narcissa, given her house arrest,” Hermione said.
However, this made sleeping over at the Burrow all the more difficult. While trying to fall asleep, he’d found himself staring absently at the ceiling, longing for Draco’s gangly limbs to be sprawled across him.
Draco mustered up a tight-lipped smile. “So, I hear you work for the Ministry now? Which department?”
Because although they hardly talked, or knew each other as adults, or interacted in any significant way, Harry still cared for the arse — even if it was from afar.
Draco looked up, blinking steadily before he offered Harry a soft smile. “Don’t worry. We can go slow.”
“For about four years now, although only the people I’m closest to know. What about you? Have you had an accepting experience?”
Harry swallowed thickly, guilt bubbling up inside his chest as memories of the Forbidden Forest flooded his mind: laying still on the cold dirt, Narcissa’s rose perfume consuming him as she had leaned down, the words,
This is the second to last update! I'm absolutely dreading Wednesday, but I'm also super excited for you all to read the ending! Thank you so much for continuing on this fluffy journey with me <3
Laoise turned around, leaning against the kitchen counter. “Since he first opened The Whomping Willow Woolery. We knew Harry was going to be successful from the start. There’s just something special about him.”
“Yeah,” Draco said, letting out a soft laugh, “things are much better. She’s become very enthusiastic about trying to match me up with men.”
As soon as the waiter left, Draco opened the folder and absently fished out five Galleons and three Knuts out of his satchel, placing them on top of the check. Then, after closing the folder, he resumed staring at the cappuccino, his mind churning with confusion.
Harry nodded. “Yeah. In fact, you were the one who led us into the common room after we had a run in with Percy Weasley as Crabbe and Goyle. You told us that you wished you knew who the heir was, so we figured we could rule you out then.”
“I’ll send a letter your way with the dinner details,” Harry said, his stomach a mess of nerves and excitement as he wandered towards the door. “Happy New Year’s, by the way.”
“No worries, Harry,” Hermione said, crouching down in the doorway as Stockinette wandered over to her.
Draco closed his eyes, wearily rubbing them before looking back up. “Are you sure? I don’t want to impose.”
“Right,” Harry said nervously, looking anywhere but at Malfoy. “Well, I’d like to buy a bouquet of flowers.”
Harry glanced down, embarrassment rising in his chest as he let go of Draco’s hand. “Well, I don’t know. I thought we were maybe becoming friends.”
With one final thrust, Potter came, releasing hot semen into Draco’s arsehole. Draco rocked his hips until Potter placed his hands on Draco’s chest, signaling for him to stop. Draco winced as he gingerly lifted himself off of Potter’s cock and collapsed next to him on the couch, their heavy breaths echoing against the walls. The air was thick with the smell of sex, and Draco lazily wiped away beads of sweat that had collected on his upper lip with the back of his hand. Next to him, Potter was panting, his chest rapidly rising and falling as he stared absently at the television in front of them. A comfortable silence fell between them.
He turned off the car before opening his door and sliding out. With a sigh, Draco reluctantly followed. Once they were both outside, Harry made a show of easing himself onto the car’s roof; legs dangling over the side as he faced the field.
As Harry resumed his fiddling with one of the paper snowflakes that Hermione had cut out for him, it swiftly levitated out of his grasp, the end of its twine attaching itself to the ceiling so that it neatly dangled. Startled, Harry looked down only to see Draco smirking at him, wand in the air.
“Malfoy, would you mind staying after for a minute? I’d like to talk to you,” Harry said, anxiously picking at a hangnail.
Harry instinctively rushed to the window, although his fears were immediately rectified. Draco shot up out of the fall with a gust of speed and leveled himself with the window. Harry stood, breathless, as Draco hovered in front of him. He looked so similar to the boy Harry had grown up with, and yet he was, at the same time, an entirely different person. Gone was the slicked hair and pointy sneer, replaced by a soft, lopsided smile and bright eyes that twinkled with excitement.
Draco nodded. “I’d be open to meeting with her and Teddy, although I think Mother would take it best hearing it from you. Would you be up for writing her a letter explaining the situation?”
Draco nodded. “Yes. Merlin, I spent so much time here as a child. It was the one place where I could lose myself. Did you have somewhere like that?”
Potter nodded, and Draco sat up. Wandlessly, Potter murmured familiar cleaning, protection, and prepping spells, and Draco gasped at the cool sensation of lubrication that was now ringed around his arsehole, which felt open and stretched. Potter looked at him, as though asking his permission, and Draco nodded, shifting forward and hovering so that Potter could align himself with Draco’s hole. After a moment of fumbling, Draco could feel Potter’s cock pressed against him, slowly breaching his tight ring of muscles. As he cautiously sank down onto Potter’s length, he panted through the overwhelming burning sensation, knowing that he’d never been stretched this much. He felt achingly full, pushed to his very limits as Potter’s cock became fully seated inside of him.
“Before we go, you should read this,” Draco said, reaching into his coat pocket and pulling out an envelope.
Harry nodded, his mind churning with ideas. “Okay. I’ve got the pattern for a shawl that I think would really suit her. It’ll require three skeins, and the book that has the pattern would need to be purchased.”
“Alright, everyone. Well, welcome to the beginners workshop! As you can see, we’ve got everything you’ll need on the table: knitting needles, yarn, stitch markers, and the list goes on. However, if you find yourself needing something else, please don’t hesitate to let me know.
Instinctively, Harry took both of Draco’s cold hands in his own and immediately began sinking into the sensation of skin on skin. “Draco … you’ve somehow become one of the most important people in my life over the past fifteen days, and, quite frankly, I feel like Christmas wouldn’t
There was something so different about him, and yet things were still familiar. He seemed to have mellowed a bit since the war, and it no longer appeared like he was an arsehole for the fun of it. For some reason, the changes in Draco had sparked a curiosity in Harry, who wanted nothing more than to get to know who he was now, after all this time.
“Well,” Harry began. “I’m hosting a beginner’s workshop here tomorrow morning, and there are still a few spaces available.”
Draco arched an eyebrow as he crossed his arms. “You’re meaning to tell me that you’re the owner of the Whomping Willow Woolery?”
Harry shrugged, stealing Hermione’s abandoned cup of tea that was sitting on the coffee table and taking a sip. “I am.”
“Would you mind if I put some eucalyptus and baby’s breath in the bouquet? Just to break up the dahlias and zinnias,” Malfoy asked.
They still had a while until they reached home, although Draco’s heart hurt more with every landmark they passed. Going home meant having to face the fact that they were nothing but roommates, and he didn’t know if that was enough anymore.
Harry answered by meeting their lips together, tentative at first and then steadily more sure. His lips were warm and soft, and he tasted like the chocolate soufflé that Ron had made for dessert.
“Okay, how in the hell did you purchase this? I didn’t see you go back to buy it at the fair,” Draco asked.
So, for any of you who don't know, Stockinette's name comes from one of the most basic stitches in knitting - the stockinette stitch! Also, thank you all so much for the comments, kudos, and subscriptions I've received so far. It means the world to me ❤
Draco cautiously worked in the rest of his index finger, followed by another digit. By the time his third finger had entered Harry’s hole, Harry was writhing with want. The burning sensation had lessened, and all he could concentrate on was the steady thrust of Draco’s fingers inside of him, twisting in a way that shot sparks through Harry’s veins.
were spelled out in golden letters. The outside of Brown Thomas, a nice department store, was covered in a thick blanket of green leaves that were studded with Christmas lights. Its windows were lit up with Christmas displays, and a small crowd had stopped to admire them.
Because I'm an absolute nitwit, I totally forgot to wish you all a happy Hanukkah last update!! I hope everyone who is celebrating has been having a wonderful (and safe) time filled with love and lots of good food.
“It’s fine, Potter,” Draco snapped before sighing, pinching the bridge of his nose. “We just come from two very different worlds, is all.”
“Fine,” Hermione snapped. “This is just completely ridiculous. I’m the first one to advocate for strong relationships between departments, but a
Harry led him through the maze of customers and towards the right side of the store, stopping in front of a long, sweeping shawl that was turning slowly in the air. Harry had a particular fondness for this shawl, the yellow, turquoise, and light blue rectangular pattern making it pop.
“Why not? Might as well get caught up, especially if you expect me to divulge all of my top secret knitting hacks,” Harry said, grinning.
In all honesty, he knew knitting was to be mostly credited for his recovery. If Hermione hadn’t brought that cheap skein of yarn over that fateful night, he never would have learned how to move on from the war. It was as though each stitch had healed him in some way, scabbing over wounds that had been open for years one project at a time.
After they paid for their books, they wandered back out into the glacial afternoon. Diagon Alley was more crowded than it had been when they’d first begun their roaming, the street bustling with magical folk anxious to get into the warmth of the shops.
,” Harry said, finally gathering his thoughts. “In fact, I’ve been told I’m an excellent chef. Also, I didn’t know you wore red.”
As Harry took in his surroundings, he couldn’t help but shake the feeling that he’d been here all too recently. Stuffing the waves of broken memories from Easter Break of ‘98 as far down as possible, he inhaled deeply.
Staring at Draco, whose pale skin was flushed in the dim amber glow coming from the living room lamp, Harry felt a wave of courage coursing through him, and he realized that if he didn’t say something right here, right now, then he never would.
“Well,” Harry began, pulling a chair up next to where the two of them were seated in the middle of the store, “Andy doesn’t seem
Draco loudly cleared his throat, sending Harry shooting back to reality. He took an abrupt step back, mortified. Draco, on the other hand, looked awkward but relatively collected, the tips of his pale ears a soft pink.
Something shifted in Malfoy’s face, as though the conversation had suddenly become far less amusing, and he cleared his throat. “Well, I think we’re done here. See you around, Potter.”
“Well, it’s not like you’re any better. You shit yourself anytime you’re in the same room as Granger—which is
After a moment of being consumed in heat, the world stopped spinning, and Harry found himself stepping into Ron and Hermione’s spacious living room. The mouth-watering smell of soy sauce and sautéed vegetables filled the air, causing Harry’s stomach to rumble.
Harry frowned but said nothing else. After Amelia handed them their drinks, Harry spotted a secluded booth in the back and led Draco to it. As they settled in, sitting across from one another, Harry could smell the rich peppermint coming from his hot chocolate, cream melting over the sides. Draco’s butterbeer didn’t look too bad, either, a warm butterscotch scent coming from its direction.
Draco shrugged. “I did. I was engaged to Astoria Greengrass right after the war. She died a year later.”
Draco’s hand slowly made its way down to Potter’s cock, barely able to wrap around its length. It felt thick and heavy in his hands, and as he gave an experimental pump upwards, Potter gripped the hair at the nape of his neck and let out a breathy sigh.
“I lived in France when I was younger, so I went to Beauxbatons. Laoise is a Squib, so she was homeschooled,” Oisín said.
Ron nodded. “Listen, mate, it’s going to seem barmy at first. Give a listen to Hermione, though. She might be onto something.”
Harry took a look at the board, his eyes immediately zeroing in on the hot chocolate section. There were several flavors available, and while he could attest that the orange, raspberry, and caramel hot chocolates were excellent, he was rather curious about the peppermint flavor.
With a half-escaped moan, Harry came, his orgasm ripping through his body. Winded, he stood motionless. It wasn’t until Draco’s mouth popped off of the tip and he stood up that Harry opened his eyes, well aware that his cheeks were burning with both lust and embarrassment.
“Oh, don’t be, darling. You must be swamped with the shop. Now, I just need to check on the salmon. Be right back,” Andromeda said before heading into the kitchen.
Harry let out a soft pitter of laughter. “Of course I mean it. In case you haven’t noticed, I’ve been trying to find every excuse to hang out with you. I just can’t stop thinking about all of the years we wasted hating each other.”
Because if it weren’t for him, Draco wouldn’t be a lovesick mess who was unable to concentrate on anything else but the smell of his eucalyptus and spearmint shampoo, or the way the corner of his eyes crinkled when he smiled —
“Ronald, you sound like a child in a toyshop,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. “So, Harry, how about we have some dinner?”
Malfoy leaned down, placing a small kiss on his forehead before grabbing his trunk and opening the door. “We beg McGonagall to let us use her Floo.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Ron insisted that we buy a magical kitchen mixer. I’m not quite sure why, as the charmed KitchenAid we have at home is
“Actually yeah,” Harry said, handing him the liquid glass measuring cup. “Could you reheat the chicken stock in the microwave for a minute?”
Draco waved a hand nonchalantly through the air. “Oh, don’t be. It was a long time ago, and there’s no use dwelling on it now. Plus, I wasn’t entirely innocent.”
“Stop talking rubbish, Potter,” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. “Surprisingly, I’m not here to ridicule you.”
Draco continued to pump himself through the flood of ecstasy until his cock was sore and softening. Beneath him, Potter’s thighs were beginning to tremble, and his thrusts grew more rapid.
With a sigh, he turned out of his bedroom and down the hallway. As soon as he caught sight of Draco, he let out a breath that he didn’t know he’d been holding.
“I asked Amber, the woman who runs the fair, for the cauldron stall’s contact information. From there, it was only a matter of describing the one I wanted. Miraculously, they hadn’t managed to sell the dragon one,” Harry said, grinning as he watched Draco admire the ceramic cauldron, its deep silver glaze sitting stark against the blinding white of the snow falling around them. “I hope it’s an alright present. I know you said you’re not a huge fan of cauldron art as a whole, but you did say that you liked the dragon one, and I thought ―”
After a moment, Potter opened the door. He looked just as ravishable as he always did, with loose, slightly tousled curls that fell to the tips of his ears, golden brown skin, a tight white T-shirt, and grey joggers that had no business being so clingy. Draco didn’t even bother hiding the fact that his gaze immediately fell to Potter’s crouch, hungrily intaking the barely-there outline of his cock.
“Merlin,” Harry said, “that’s a heavy question. Well, Christmases with my aunt and uncle weren’t exactly … happy. The only presents I’d get were a few pairs of my cousin’s old socks and a ratty tee shirt if I was lucky. While my aunt, uncle, and cousin ate dinner, I was always sent to clean the kitchen. And once I was done with that, I would be told to go back to my cupboard under the stairs. When I got to Hogwarts, I realized that I didn’t have to go back for Christmas, and that was the end of that. I always either spent the Christmas holiday at school or with the Weasleys. It’s pretty much the same now. I’ll go over to The Burrow on Christmas Eve and spend the night, and then I’ll go back to my flat on the 27th. Hermione, her parents, Andromeda, and Teddy always join us, and it’s just … well, it’s really nice.”
Draco shrugged. “Don’t be. I don’t blame them. I made some really poor choices when I was younger that I deeply regret, and if hating me makes people feel better, then so be it.”
Then, there was the constant guilt nesting in Harry’s chest. It had been him that Voldemort was after at the Battle of Hogwarts. So many lives had been lost that night, and for nothing. In the darkest moments of everyday, Harry found himself wishing that it had been him who had died that fateful night ― not Fred, or Remus, or Tonks, or Colin Creevey, or the countless others who had sacrificed themselves for the sake of Harry’s life.
There stood Draco Malfoy, several years older and looking like a cat caught in the rain. His hair, ashy blond, was longer than it had been when Harry had seen him at his trial a month after the war had ended, falling in gentle waves to the tips of his ears. He wasn’t as skeletal either, the hollows in his cheeks and under his eyes having been filled nicely.
“Yep,” Harry said, holding up the toy giraffe, which looked like it had seen better days, before turning to Stockinette. “Stocky, Uncle Draco and I’ve got to run an errand. We’ll be back this evening. Uncle Ron will be over to feed you lunch and dinner in case I’m not back by then, okay? I love you so much.”
It was made out of the very mustard yellow yarn that Draco had purchased when he’d come to help decorate the shop, having refused to tell Harry who the project was for. It looked exactly like Harry would have expected: dropped stitches everywhere, incredibly tight tension, and a decrease that had gone
“There must have been some sort of mistake, Sir —” Harry began, but he was promptly cut off by Malfoy.
The frosty day had gone by in a blur, having helped at least fifty customers. However, no matter how engrossed he had been in any given conversation, he couldn’t help but notice that his thoughts kept returning to Draco, wondering if he’d practiced any knitting since the workshop. Hell, he wondered if he would even see Draco again, worrying that he’d scared him off the previous day with his abrupt forgiveness.
In order to avoid the heavy downpour, they walked underneath the row of overhangs lining the fronts of shops, an occasional raindrop hitting them. The alley was quiet, although Harry could see that all of the shops were bustling with customers. As they passed Flourish and Blotts, a surge of childhood memories passed through Harry’s mind, causing him to smile to himself.
As they wandered past a stall selling pasta art, Harry suddenly remembered the letter he had received earlier.
“Right,” Draco said, grinning, “well, in that case, I suppose I ought to tell you what your surprise is.”
The store was packed with witches and wizards alike, many of them beginning their Christmas shopping and others simply looking for themselves. Harry and Hermione were slammed with helping customers pick out yarn, making needle recommendations, and pointing them to the pattern book that would fill their every need, while Ron manned the check-out counter along with Stockinette, who was curled into a lazy half-crescent.
“I’m so sorry, Mrs. Van Ness, but I need to go check on something. I promise I’ll be back. Meanwhile, feel free to take a look at Noor Safar’s new book of baby patterns. It’s on the second shelf of the bookcase closest to the check-out counter,” Harry said before quickly making an exit.
Unfortunately, this did not deter Stockinette from trying, causing Harry to miss most of his episode.
“I’m not drunk, or high, or under the influence of any kind, if that’s what you’re thinking,” Draco said, lightly trailing his fingers up and down Potter’s chest in a way that made Potter squirm. “All I’ve got is a bit of luck.”
“Yes,” Draco said, his voice growing softer. “She mostly knits shawls, and her favorite color is purple.”
“You might have an easier time if you loosen your grip. You’ve been knitting with a lot of tension, and I think this is why you’re having such a difficult time picking up your stitches,” Hermione said. “Can I show you what I mean on your scarf?”
Teddy nodded. “Yeah! I brought him to school yesterday, and all my friends wanted to play with him.”
With that, the call ended, and Harry looked back towards Draco, who was, if possible, even paler than usual.
“Yeah, absolutely. Although … there’s been a minor change in plans ―” Harry began, but he was abruptly cut off.
I'm totally Draco in this, desperately trying to impress my wife by attempting to knit. Turns out I'm much better at writing about knitting than actually doing it 😂
Harry huddled further into his winter coat as he took in his surroundings. On the opposite side of the pond stood a towering orange tree, its boughs laden with ripened fruit, and in the distance was a large hedge dotted with blinking eyes.
After a moment of contemplation, Stockinette glared at him before swiftly heading towards the kitchen without a second glance. Harry let out a huff of amused laughter as he gathered his knitting bag and walked into the fireplace, disappearing in a bright burst of green flames.
As they began to decorate, Harry trying desperately to concentrate on hanging the snowflakes instead of looking at Draco’s bum, music came flowing out of the Muggle speakers at the back of the shop, the sweet sound of Bing Crosby singing
Draco snorted. “I’m sure you could find plenty of eligible bachelors or bachelorettes to accompany you.”
“Yeah,” Harry said softly. “It’s silly, really, but I wanted Teddy to have a piece of Remus’ best friend ― well, more than best friend, I guess. I always suspected there to be something else between Remus and Sirius than just friendship. Anyway, Sirius’ Animagus was a black dog, so …”
about Malfoy. He wanted sappy date nights, stealing kisses in broom closets in between classes as though they were horny teenagers, and getting into bed together for a purpose besides fucking. He wanted a
He hadn’t seen Andromeda and Teddy in a little over a month, and a visit was very much overdue. Harry grabbed a sheet of parchment from the check-out counter and began to write, hoping that Andromeda would be available.
“Alright, salmon is done and the potatoes are now in the oven. Thank you for the wine, by the way. It smells lovely,” Andromeda said before taking a small sip. "So, how’s everything?”
They made their way around different stalls for the next while, admiring the vast variety of skill sets that had been put on display for the evening. One of Harry’s favorite stalls had been one containing shelves upon shelves of artisan toffee. The toffee maker had explained that each bucket was unique to the taster, as she’d perfected an edible solution that would recall one’s most treasured memories. As Harry had let his sample melt on his tongue, dissolving into a pool of warm, buttery sugar, he’d felt overcome with memories of the Quidditch Pitch at Hogwarts, laughing with Ron and Hermione in the common room, hugging Molly and Arthur Weasley, and ― the most surprising of the bunch ― decorating the Whomping Willow Woolery with Draco. Closing his eyes as he’d savored the toffee, he couldn’t help but hope that Draco was thinking of the same thing.
Malfoy awkwardly cleared his throat, moving to his position behind the counter. He was clad in a charcoal colored turtleneck and, Harry was quite startled to see, blue jeans. On top of the turtleneck laid a forest green apron with the shop’s name embroidered in loopy gold letters on the chest.
By the time lunch rolled around, Harry was in a far better mood, having found that helping customers did always manage to cheer him up. As he hung up the sign in the front window reading
“Okay. Just give me a minute to adjust,” Draco said, and Potter nodded. He paused, letting himself get used to the stretch before hesitantly beginning to raise and lower himself. After a few moments, the pain began to be replaced with pleasure. Draco gripped the back of Potter’s head, pulling him into a deep kiss as he gradually quickened his pace. The sound of skin slapping skin and wet squelches from the lubrication filled the air, along with the sound of October’s first rain hitting the windows.
“Harry,” Draco said, cupping Harry’s chin with his hand and tilting it up, “I love it so much. It fits perfectly, and the design is beautiful. I’m only laughing because of your last present. Go on and open it.”
Harry let out a heavy sigh as he picked one of the flowers, twirling the thin stem between his thumb and index finger, and thought of Malfoy. They weren’t friends, so it didn’t matter that they hadn’t talked since Malfoy had stormed off earlier that afternoon. Yet, as Harry replayed the conversation over in his head, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d managed to screw up a relationship that was nonexistent.
Harry let out a soft laugh. “I know, Teddy. It’ll make more sense when you’re older. Now, come on. Let’s go see where Granny’s at. I think it’d be a good idea if you said sorry to her.”
A brief quietness settled over the room as Draco stood up, and Harry could see that he was beginning to feel uneasy.
After teaching the students how to cast on and make a stitch, as well as explaining why they would need to flip the scarf over once they reached the end of a row, Harry let them reign free, working on his own scarf that he was making along with them.
“Just a side note that the yellow curry, lemon chicken, and pad thai are all incredible,” Harry said, handing him the menu.
His sentence was interrupted by the sight of a distant, yet familiar face peering in through the front windows before walking in, the small bell above the door chiming, and everything seemed to fall away.
On the table were three healthy bowls of soup, steam curling off the surface. Before the war, Molly’s chicken soup had been one of his favorite meals. Now, the sight and smell of it only made him nauseated.
As Malfoy stood in front of him, facing away, Harry let out a small breath. On the nape of Malfoy’s exposed neck sat a magical black tattoo of a rising phoenix, its inky feathers stark against his skin. Mouth slightly agape, Harry stared at the phoenix, watching it take its first breath after being reborn —
His heart gave a little pang, which he decidedly ignored. “So, care to tell me why we’re sitting on top of the car?”
Draco seemed lost, glancing around the shop with wide eyes. Harry frowned, wondering why the hell he would be there. In the year that he had owned the shop, he had frantically worked to keep his name unassociated with the popularity of the shop, so unless Draco had an excellent connection, it seemed as though he had stumbled there by happenstance.
As the group turned right, following the path past a fallen tree, Harry heard an achingly familiar voice behind him. Glancing back, he saw that Malfoy, who was Head Unspeakable, had made his way through the pack of people and was chatting to Elora Dunn. They seemed to be completely engrossed in conversation, so Harry let his gaze linger. Although he and Malfoy didn’t run into each other very often at the Ministry, he consistently had a small crisis after every encounter. With ashy blond hair that was always pulled back into a messy knot on his head and crisp, sleek clothes that hugged his body in all the right ways, there was no denying that he was attractive. Harry had clearly been harboring a small crush on him for a while now, yet he pointedly chose to ignore the feelings that welled up inside his chest whenever he caught sight of the man. He was
Draco rolled his eyes as they stepped into the park, which was lined with barren trees and evergreen shrubs dotted with bright red berries. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
After Hermione helped him up, she escorted him to the bathroom down the hall, waiting outside while Harry relieved his bladder. Once he was done, they walked back to Sirius’ bedroom, where Harry perched on the edge of the bed and Hermione dug around in a chest drawer for a clean pair of pajamas. Eventually, she pulled out a worn Chudley Cannons t-shirt and fleece pants that had a printed Snitch pattern on them. While Hermione turned around, giving him some privacy, Harry deftly removed his pajamas and exchanged them for the new ones, the feeling of clean fabric foreign against his skin.
Draco turned to look at Harry, his cheeks rosy from grinning. “Well, should we add the final touch?”
Sorry this is almost four hours later than usual! I slept in for the first time in a while, and it was great 😂 The craft fair is based on a holiday fair that happens every year in my town, and it's held at the local art center. It's not on this year, of course, so I'm missing it lots. Also, I PROMISE I will get to responding to comments once I've uploaded all of the chapters!
“Mother recently told me that decorative cauldrons have become all the rage lately. Personally, I don’t see the appeal. Why would one purchase a cauldron only for it to sit and collect dust?”
The sky was heavy with dark clouds, threatening to unleash a new flurry of snow and slush at any moment. This caused Harry to frown, a deep crease settling in between his eyebrows as he made his way towards the nearest Tube station. The path was slick and wet with snow that had fallen overnight, and his shoes were already soaked and uncomfortable. Silently, Harry thanked himself for having been reasonable and putting on a second pair of wool socks over his first.
“Hey,” Draco said, giving Stockinette one last pet before standing up. “Sorry I’m so early. One of my mother’s most important clients unexpectedly popped over, so she kicked me out.”
As soon as it was time to close up the shop, Harry hurried to lock things up before dashing upstairs. Once he’d fed Stockinette dinner, grabbed a bottle of unopened wine from the kitchen counter, and packed his half-knitted jumper, he stepped into the fireplace and disappeared in a burst of green flames.
. They’re based on a farm that’s located on the largest of the Aran Islands, Inis Mór. I’m planning on leaving around nine tomorrow morning, taking a Portkey to the point in Galway, and then getting a Muggle ferry to Inis Mór. How does that sound?”
“Right,” Draco said, letting out a light laugh, “well, cheers to us for playing our first Quidditch game in years.”
Draco leaned forward, their lips almost touching. He could feel Harry’s soft breaths against his skin. A wave of anxiety pulsated over him but he held firm, Harry’s words echoing in his ears.
“That’s … amazing. I’m so glad your mum’s company has been successful. Did … did she ever tell you about the night of the battle? When she saved me?” Harry asked.
Harry glanced at Draco, who was transfixed on Teddy, and felt a wave of warmth surge through his body.
They ate their breakfast in relative silence, both of them conscious of the time. When 8:55 rolled around, Harry collected their empty plates, dropped them off in the kitchen, and then began to gather his things. Sick of his yellow jumper and pair of mittens, he hastily packed a skein of bulky, golden brown yarn with speckles of cream and black for a new cowl, which he intended on giving Arthur, into a broom patterned project bag. Then, once he’d also stuffed his wallet and order forms into the bag, he layered on his coat, a slouchy beanie, and matching gloves that Hermione had made him years ago. Finally, he grabbed the toy giraffe Portkey that he’d rented the previous night. When he walked back to the living room, Draco was standing near the fireplace, his winter coat buttoned to the top and beanie pulled down tightly to his ears. He looked frustratingly endearing, causing a hot flush to rise to Harry’s cheeks.
Picking his satchel up from the ground, he double-checked that he had his wand, keys, and knitting before taking a moment to simply look at Draco, who was running his slender fingers along the cubbyholes, his pale skin stark against the pops of color.
“There’s this pond I used to go to when I’d practice flying over holidays, and I was thinking we could go there. How does that sound?” Draco asked as he began to stroke Stockinette’s back.
After a few more rounds of pacing, Harry let out a heavy sigh and ducked into the bathroom in the hall. There, he fidgeted with the hem of what he considered to be his nicest jumper. It had been knitted out of bulky, garnet colored targhee-Columbia wool, and the white yoke of the sweater was Nordic in design. He’d made the jumper for the grand opening of the Whomping Willow Woolery a year ago, and he’d been astounded at the amount of compliments he’d managed to receive on it. Even Hermione had said that it was his best work yet, and he couldn’t help but agree.
After Harry relieved himself and pulled on a Weird Sisters hoodie that Hermione had given him years ago, he padded down the hallway and into the living room and kitchen area, which was only separated by a narrow granite island. He peered out of the window that sat to the left of his navy blue couch, watching shadow colored clouds drift across the sky. The light spilling into his flat was dark and dull, and Harry guessed that there would be a heavy downpour in the afternoon. Normally, he found dreary weather to be quite disagreeable, much preferring the soft, warm breezes of spring to the harshness of winter. However, since opening his shop, he’d learned that stormy weather meant people seeking shelter, and people seeking shelter meant more customers.
when making hats, since it’s pretty soft. You’ll only need one skein, so have at it,” Harry said, gesturing for Draco to pick a color.
Harry, slightly breathless from the overwhelming intoxication of Draco’s aftershave, shook his head. “Not at all.”
Harry shook his head. “No, I’ll wait until this afternoon. She and Teddy always go out for lunch on Saturdays.”
“Oh, for the love of Merlin,” Harry muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Fine. You pay for yourself.”
Harry watched as Draco’s long, pale fingers let go of the Snitch, whose thin, papery wings shot it high into the sky. Then, as it disappeared behind a cluster of dark clouds drifting in the wind, Draco gave Harry a smile.
Taking a leap of faith, Harry reached over and took Draco’s hand in his own. “I can’t imagine how tough everything must be on you, but just know that you don’t have to deal with it alone.”
“Thank you. I couldn’t have done it without my wife, who was the chief decorator,” Amber said, smiling brightly.
“Of course. Listen, this isn’t going to be easy for any of you, but I’m just glad you’re all trying. That’s what matters,” Harry said.
Draco nodded. “Yes. She’s been talking about this shop for ages, but she’s not able to visit due to her … house arrest sentence, so I thought I’d surprise her for Christmas.”
Hermione looked up, giving him a bright smile as she patted the cushion next to her. “Merry Christmas, Harry. Come sit.”
Draco made a face. “I was never particularly fond of sheep. I had an … incident with one when I was eight.”
Draco let out a painful groan. “Yes. Merlin, I don’t think I’ve ever seen something so ugly. Honestly, Harry, the color is hideous. Why did you even put out bright orange yarn to begin with?”
Draco’s cock throbbed at Potter’s words of encouragement, and he pressed both of their lengths together, struggling to hold them at once. However, the heat coming from the friction was worth the challenge, shooting bursts of pleasure throughout Draco’s body and provoking long strings of incoherent swears from Potter.
Off in the distance the sun continued to set, slowly sinking behind the hills as they approached a familiar stretch of road. It was surrounded by fields of golden wheat on either side. Draco liked this particular area; no matter what season it was, the fields always had something to offer.
“Right. Well,” Draco said, unravelling his own knitted scarf and tucking it around Harry’s neck, “this ought to help.”
And with that, Harry was left alone to wait. As McWeenie called pair after pair and the pool of potential partners dwindled down, he tried to survey his options, but his efforts proved to be fruitless. It was difficult to keep track of who had already been paired and who had yet to be, and he eventually gave up.
Stockinette nudged Harry’s calf with her head, interrupting his thoughts. He looked down at her, grinning, and gave her a quick scratch behind the ear.
Standing up, he quickly ran down the hall and into the kitchen, grabbed his spare supply of letter-writing equipment from a drawer next to the fridge, and then settled onto the couch in the living room. Pale, pewter colored light fell through the window, casting deep shadows across the cold wooden floor. Just as he was about to dip his quill in the ink pot, a sleepy Stockinette stumbled out of the hallway and headed in the direction of the couch, swiftly hopping onto the arm. Harry reached out his free hand, which she gently nuzzled.
Harry paused in the middle of his row, looking up with the feeling of disappointment settling into his stomach. “You’re sure you’ve got to go?”
With one last nod of agreement, Draco swiftly pulled down Harry’s jeans and pants in one go. Harry could feel his cheeks burning red from embarrassment, and he was overtly aware that Draco wasn’t doing anything. Looking down, he frowned.
Malfoy shrugged as he stopped to pull Harry to his feet. “She never shuts up about you, you know. Always goes on about how we’re colleagues in her letters. I think she’d be pleased to know that I’ve somehow managed to woo you.”
on the muddy knees of his jeans. “The port is just on the other side of that hill. Come on, let’s go.”
“Millicent Bullstrode. Always had been. Millie didn’t sway that way, though, and nothing ever happened between them. In fact, Millie went on to marry Theodore Nott last year. Not that I’ve talked with her, though. Haven’t talked with any of them in years,” Draco said, mumbling the last sentence.
. I’d hoped to have finished it by now, but life has just gotten away from me. How’s your scarf going?”
“I think that the past isn’t what’s important anymore. I can assure you that this git you’re talking about doesn’t look at you with contempt, or resentment, or anger. All he wants is to get to know you now, as the person you’ve become. And he’s scared too; he’s unsure of what this relationship would bring, but he’s realized today that it’s a risk he’s willing to take.”
“So, this is the shawl. It doesn’t have to be these three colors, of course. You can pick any colors you want from the recommended yarn. How … does it look?” Harry asked.
“Yeah, of course, mate,” Ron added, reaching around Hermione’s shoulders to pat Harry on the back. “Anything for you.”
“Please, dear,” Molly piped up, “let us know if we’re putting you and your mother out. That was not the intention of Harry’s surprise.”
“Well, the war hurt a lot of people, including Granny and her family. They were all hurt in different ways, and it’s only now that they’ve healed enough to see each other again,” Harry explained.
Artemis gave him a soft hoot, and Harry beckoned her inside. She immediately flew over to the coffee table, perching next to Stockinette, who was giving her the stink-eye. Harry sat back down on the couch, unrolling the piece of parchment paper. There, he saw Hermione's neat, loopy handwriting scrawled across the page.
Before Malfoy could finish, Harry pressed their lips together. It was gentle, soft, warm, and unlike any other kiss they’d shared. Malfoy’s eyes fluttered shut, and Harry could feel his eyelashes against his cheek. The warm feeling in his chest grew, echoing throughout his body like a building crescendo. Slowly, he let himself wrap his arms around Malfoy’s neck, and Malfoy’s arms moved to his waist, pulling them closer together.
Harry held up his knitting needles, showing off the progress he’d made in his yellow jumper. “Alright. I’m about to start the sleeves, which I’m
He ate breakfast in silence, his thoughts turning to the date that was indicated on the calendar hanging on the wall.
Harry paused, his mind working to connect the question to his surprise. Then, not a moment later, he remembered that there was an ice rink nearby called the Tower of London Ice Rink. He’d never been, although Dudley had plenty of times.
“I was attacked by one when I was a child. And, quite frankly, I don’t trust their rectangular pupils,” Draco said, frowning.
The room fell silent as Teddy paused, pursing his lips in deep thought. After a moment, he crossed his arms and let out a huff of air.
Harry looked at Malfoy—at the way beads of sweat lined his upper lip, at the way his muscles were shaking with the effort from not yet thrusting, at the way his grey eyes looked nearly blue in the pale, overcast light coming in from the window next to the bed—and something shifted inside Harry. Reaching up, he wrapped his arms around Malfoy’s neck and pulled him into a wet, needy kiss, their tongues meeting fearlessly. Harry could taste Malfoy’s sweat, could feel their hearts pounding heavily together.
The burgundy wool was soft against Harry’s skin, and it smelled of Draco’s aftershave: cloves, pine, and citrus. He instantly felt a bit warmer, although he wasn’t sure whether that was from the scarf itself or the furious blush that was spreading across his face and down his neck.
After a moment, Malfoy gingerly pulled out of him before rolling off to his left. Their thighs were touching, and the heat radiating from Malfoy’s skin was welcoming against the frigid air. A heavy silence fell between them.
“I only need to add one more round of chicken stock, so ten minutes? You don’t have to stay in here if you don’t want to, though,” Harry said.
Harry looked to the till counter, but there wasn’t a shop employee in sight. However, there was a silver bell sitting on the countertop, which he diligently rang, the tinny sound echoing throughout the shop. He heard shuffling in what must have been the back room, and then a figure all too familiar emerged.
Grabbing a handful of Floo powder, Harry stepped into the fireplace. As he let the powder slip through his fingers, flames beginning to engulf him, he could just barely make out the twisted look of fright on Andromeda’s face before he disappeared.
“Sorry I’m late,” Draco said sheepishly, taking a seat next to Harry, which happened to be the only one available.
“I’m so excited you’re here, Harry!” they said, pulling back from the hug. “And you too, Draco. Any friend of Harry’s is a friend of ours.”
Harry let out a bark of laughter, elbowing him in the side. “Are you going to finally admit that you need help with it?”
Once he’d arrived at the Tower Hill station on the East End of London, he hurried up the stairs that led him onto the road. As he wove his way in between Muggles, he spotted a wooden sign reading
They queued up in the far left line, which was the shortest by far, and managed to board the ferry at 9:20. Harry led Draco up the stairs and onto the second level, where they looked around for seating.
As soon as everyone began to pack up their things, Harry realized that he wasn’t quite ready for Draco, who hadn’t uttered a word since Harry had asked if he needed help, to leave. As the students began to disperse, he cleared his throat.
After another forty minutes, Draco checked his watch and let out a sigh. “I should probably get going. I promised I’d help my mother with inventory tonight."
Hermione took a seat next to him, frowning as she rubbed her hand soothingly in a circle on his back. “That’s not the point, Harry. I suppose what Ron and I are trying to get at is that you’ve always been far more interested in Malfoy than the rest of us. For some reason, you two just seemed to connect, even if it wasn’t necessarily in a good way. It makes a lot of sense to me that now, having had some distance since our days at Hogwarts and the war, you’re figuring out your feelings for him. I truly wouldn’t be surprised if you liked him all along and just didn’t realize it because of everything that was happening.”
It wasn’t fireworks, as first kisses were so often described in Muggle media. Instead, kissing Draco was like a thousand beating wings rushing towards the sun, a vibrant warmth spreading through his chest as they held each other close. There was a certain comfort in Draco’s slightly chapped lips, as though Harry had known and been intimate with them for years now. He supposed he had, to a degree, having memorized the form of Draco’s lips from all the way across the Great Hall throughout his time at Hogwarts.
After spending ten minutes lamenting over the absence of Draco, Harry swung his legs over the bed, stretched, and stood up. Stockinette, who’d been fast asleep at the end of the bed, yawned before lumbering over to Harry’s pillow, lying down, and promptly curling herself into a tight crescent.
Oisín looked up from the newspaper they were reading and stood up, grinning. They pulled Harry into a tight hug, patting him on the back.
Harry held out his arm, and Draco took hold of it. Then, without warning, they began twisting violently through the air, eventually landing hard on the ground. While Harry brushed himself off, Draco looked onto the main road.
“Oh. Well, I was planning on ordering a takeaway from Preeda’s Curry Court. You’d be welcome to join, if you want,” Harry said, his heart beating loudly against his chest.
After an extra two beats of silence, Draco glanced up, his lips slightly parted. “You … made this for me?”
“—No,” Malfoy said, grabbing Harry’s arm to stop him from turning around. “No, sorry. I just hadn’t expected that you’d come.”
He took one last look in the mirror, anxiously pulling and tugging on his jumper. He could feel a surge of butterflies shooting through his body, and he had to remind himself that this was, in fact, not a date. Hell, he didn’t even know if Draco was into men. Perhaps all of this was an impossible story that he was dreaming up and couldn’t bear to let go of.
The following morning found Harry staring sourly at his reflection in the bathroom mirror as he impatiently tried to clean his glasses. Clad in a cream cable jumper and faded blue jeans, he couldn’t help but wonder how his clothes would compare to Draco, whose outfit was bound to give him a heart attack from both jealousy and pure, unadulterated lust.
After ushering Colette inside, he took the neatly rolled parchment paper from her ankle and began reading.
As Harry opened his mouth to respond, Draco turned around, parting his way through the crowd. Shrugging to himself, Harry continued on, eventually spotting Ron and Hermione through the clusters of wixen. Hermione was in the midst of stuffing shrunken down wrapped items into her handbag, which Ron was holding open. As Harry approached, Ron looked up and frowned.
Eventually, he came across a navy blue, cream, and pastel lavender. Picking them up, he wandered to the check-out counter and stashed them in one of the drawers. Just as he was resuming his people watching position, he saw a familiar face peeking into the window.
Before anything more could be said, a sharp tapping pierced the air. Looking towards the living room window, Harry could barely make out the silhouette of an owl carrying a shrunken brown paper bag.
Once again I'm just going to say THANK YOU for the amazing support you've provided me while uploading TWWW. It means the world to me, and I'm so happy knowing that so many of you are enjoying it - especially the mental health and crafting aspect <3 I hope all of you are doing well and staying safe! Happy Friday!
wanted to be there, the retreat organizer, Oswald McWeenie, continued to lead the pack with a nauseating level of enthusiasm as they trekked towards their campsite.
“Thanks, love,” Draco said, taking it. “Merlin, Harry, this is heavy. What the hell are you giving me, a box of coal?”
Harry paced the length of his living room for the twentieth time as he anxiously checked his wrist watch, his mind racing with ways in which the reunion could go horribly wrong. Despite there being ten minutes left before he needed to Floo to Andromeda’s house, he’d been ready for the past half hour, having taken a shower and packed his knitting bag early.
“Sorry, lads, but the rules are the rules!” McWeenie said, smiling as though he wasn’t sorry in the slightest. "Now, why don’t you stand off to the side while I get through the rest of these names, hm?”
“I should warn you,” Harry said, temporarily stilling Draco’s hand, which had come very close to unzipping his jeans, “I’ve only ever done …
“Yes, this is Teddy,” Andromeda nodded, wiping a few stray tears as she ruffled Teddy’s hair. “Teddy, can you say hi to Aunt Narcissa and Cousin Draco?”
“Until you get the hang of things and feel comfortable on your own,” Harry said, pausing to lean down and pet Stockinette, who was sprawled across the ground. “There’s no rush, though. I mean,
After a few minutes of silence, Harry looked up and realized that Draco was staring at the jumper on his needles.
As though on cue, Curry looked up, blinking at them before beginning to wander over. Draco took a cautious step back, causing Harry to snicker and earning him a scowl.
Except, he couldn’t. Ever since Potter had hired him, he’d been trying to muster up the courage to talk to Potter—to ask him out—but that clearly hadn’t turned out well.
He swore he could see Malfoy smirk as he set about putting the bouquet together. Meanwhile, Harry wandered around the shop, putting all of his frazzled energy into admiring the different flora.
Harry remembered being told that Andromeda would serve Draco Cauldron Cakes when they used to visit, and suddenly everything felt much more real. Andromeda and Narcissa were in the same room for the first time in nearly two decades, and although it was a bit awkward, things didn't seem like they were going to explode any time soon.
“For years, the only thing I did was knit. Over time, I grew more sociable, and my life started coming together again. I actually didn’t open the shop until last December,” Harry said.
As McWeenie began to rifle through his trouser pockets, Hermione turned to Harry and rolled her eyes. He nodded in agreement.
Before Harry could say anything, Draco looked up and caught his eye. Harry’s breath hitched as a soft smile crept across Draco’s face, and the world seemed to fall away. If Harry could, he would have captured that moment a thousand times in his head, the image Draco smiling at the sight of him igniting something splendid and terrifying in the pit of his stomach.
Harry had never been to this particular café, although it seemed relatively pleasant as he stepped inside, the warm smell of freshly baked rolls and sweet coffee filling his lungs. He scanned the crowd, searching for a particular glint of light blond hair.
“Rest your legs on my shoulders. It’ll make it easier,” Draco instructed, and Harry complied. “I’m going to start with a finger.”
knitting lessons. Second of all … we don’t have to talk about the past, you know,” Draco said quietly.
The only thing that kept Harry going was the frequent visits from Ron and Hermione. They would floo to Grimmauld Place at least five times a week, checking in on Harry and bringing him rich, warm food that Molly had made. They kept him updated on the world outside, which had seemingly moved on without him, and this often led to Hermione prompting a conversation about Harry’s mental health. Harry would reassure her that he was fine, and she would reassure him that was most certainly not.
Draco took another step forward, placing a hand on Potter’s chest as he looked up into his deep green eyes. “You know what I’ve always been curious about? Whether the rumors about your cock are true or not. People say your cock is big enough to leave a poor sod ripped open and begging for more. I can’t tell you, Potter, how many nights I’ve imagined you buried inside me, fucking me so hard until I can’t see straight—”
Looking around, Harry couldn’t help but feel a swell of joy in his heart at all of the bright colors filling the shop. Often, as he was closing up shop, he would spend an hour or so simply taking in all of his yarn stock, organized by brand, weight, and color. His favorite section to stare at was the fingering yarn by a small, indie dyer company called
Quietly humming to himself, he gave a sharp knock on the door before peering up at the sky. Dark clouds hung above, and there was a bite to the air. Draco felt certain that it would begin to lash any minute.
Harry spent the next six hours listening to Hermione as she taught him how to knit, starting with the cast on and ending with how to make a simple knit stitch. The night was pitch black by the time Ron and Hermione left.
As Harry sat up, rubbing at his eyes, he wished more than anything that Draco was there, in bed, next to him. After they’d spent Friday evening helping Narcissa with decorations, floral arrangements, and the ludicrous Christmas tree for the Ministry’s Christmas Ball, he and Draco had announced to her during dinner that they were dating. Narcissa had promptly taken one look at them, smiled softly, and said, “and the sky is blue. Is the fish cooked alright? It’s a new recipe.”
As Oisín continued to list off twenty more colors, Harry looked to Draco, who was staring intently at the different colors. He had the same look on his face that he'd often had during class at Hogwarts, as though he was channeling all of his concentration into this one thing. It was oddly endearing watching Draco learn about an entirely new skill and the world surrounding it, and Harry felt much like he was watching a child on Christmas morning. There was a gleam of curiosity in Draco’s pale grey eyes, and Harry wanted nothing more than to make Draco look like that all the time.
“Listen, I know it’s mad, but hear me out. He’s changed since the war. He’s not the arsehole he was as a kid, and he’s really trying. I’m not asking you to immediately like him. I’m just asking that you give him a chance.”
A few minutes later, a waitress showed up to take their order. Harry and Draco had agreed to share a pot of tea, which both of them seemed desperate for.
As they headed away from the rink and towards a deserted park, both of their trousers soggy and cold from having landed on the ice, Draco looked towards Harry, grinning. His cheeks were flushed bright pink, as were the tips of his ears, and there was something gut-wrenchingly wonderful about the fact that Harry himself had made Draco this happy.
Draco’s words echoed in Harry’s ears, repeating over and over again until they nearly lost meaning. Sitting so close to Draco, Harry could make out things that he’d never quite noticed before: his eyelashes the color of white gold, a dark spot on the bottom left of his blush colored lips, and the barely visible trail of sand colored freckles dotting the bridge of his sharp nose.
After taking one last look at the flower between his fingers, Harry chucked it into the stream, watching it drift off as he desperately wished for this weekend to be over. He wondered if he could somehow rope Hermione into helping him feign ill, although that would involve disclosing his reason for needing to leave early, and he wasn’t quite sure if he was ready for another significant hit of embarrassment in such a short amount of time.
Harry shuddered at the change of temperature as they walked into Florean Fortescue’s Ice-Cream Parlor, the warmth from the shop seeping into him. It was relatively busy, although Harry wasn’t surprised. Since Florean’s death, his daughter, Amelia, had been doing everything she could to keep the place in tip-top shape.
By the time they reached the port, Harry could see a line of white ferries in the deep blue water. A large printed sign hung above the entrance, displaying different routes and times. Harry’s eyes landed on the line reading,
“No, I’m alright. Plus, I’d really like to see how Hermione knits,” Draco said, briefly smirking before continuing. “Thank you, though. I appreciate it.”
Ten minutes later, Draco and Narcissa returned to the dining room, followed by a trail of levitating platters. The rich smell of citrus filled the air, and Harry’s stomach doubled over with hunger.
“Merlin, someone’s impatient,” Harry said, giving her a brief scratch behind her velvety ears before heading towards the kitchen.
“Wait,” Harry said, panicking as he realized he’d actually said that aloud. He grabbed Malfoy’s arm to stop him from moving. “Wait.”
Over the years, Harry had developed the ability to knit without looking, only glancing down when concentration was necessary. He’d managed to teach himself how to do it during the long wave of recovery, determined to watch television and knit at the same time. Every time he was invited over for a movie night at the Granger-Weasley flat, Hermione would wind up shooting him jealous daggers. It was something that Harry took pride in, especially since it was one of the few things he was able to do that Hermione couldn’t execute no matter how hard she tried.
As Harry slid into his chair, Andromeda let out a heavy sigh. Looking up, he realized just how worn she was.
Draco turned around to find a rather concerned-looking waiter frowning at him. He quickly took his seat again, awkwardly clearing his throat. “I’ll just leave this here for you,” the waiter said, placing the leather folder that contained the check on the table. “Please take your time.”
Potter shifted so that they were looking at each other, a lopsided grin spreading across his face. “I’ve just fucked you raw, and you want to talk about my bloody bathroom?”
“Merlin, that’s—” Harry let out a shaky breath before pulling back slightly so that he could look Malfoy in the eye. “Wait. The train’s leaving soon. Will we even have time?”
As soon as Draco pulled out, they both collapsed onto their backs in sheer bliss. Harry curled into Draco’s side, resting his head on Draco’s rapidly rising and falling chest. Draco looked down at him, and Harry noticed that his fringe was stuck to his forehead with sweat.
Luckily, they didn’t have to walk very far in order to see the sheep. As the four of them stood underneath the back porch’s awning, Harry watched as sheep grazed a few meters away. Beautiful, cream colored wool in need of shearing hung heavily off of their frames, and Harry knew that they were going to produce fantastic fiber.
“Really? You’re going right into small talk?” Draco asked, the corners of his mouth tilting upwards.
He could remember it all so vividly ― the shouts of pain coming from Hermione, Luna’s look of complete and utter hopelessness, Dobby’s bright green eyes, and Draco.
They spent the next hour knitting and chatting away, Ron working on a crossword puzzle. After deciding that the front window display should involve jumpers and the Snowfall Spell, they discussed the rest of the shop’s decorations for a good while. Harry kept sneaking glances at Draco, searching for some semblance of enjoyment in his face.
Once Stockinette had been picked up and Harry had stuffed his wallet and keys into the back pocket of his jeans, they stepped into the fireplace and disappeared in a puff of green flames.
“Alright, we’ve got to sheer some of our sheep in an hour, so why don’t we give you a tour of our merinos?” Laoise said.
Harry did as told, rearranging himself on his hands and knees as he faced the headboard. Draco, having cast another lubrication spell, in addition to a protection spell, on his cock, came up behind Harry and lined himself up with his arsehole.
“Yeah,” Harry said, letting out a light laugh, “he was a handful, especially at eleven. Merlin, he used to be so glued to his prejudices.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, amusement settling in as he stared at Draco’s words. Perhaps the most perplexing thing about the note was the fact that, once again, Draco was coming to him for help with his knitting. While the Whomping Willow Woolery did just fine among the locals, it was in no way the most prestigious yarn shop in the wizarding part of London. Several resided around the place, one even being located in Knockturn Alley now that it was no longer dedicated to both the Dark Arts and Dark Magic, instead becoming solely a branch off of Diagon Alley. The idea that Draco would choose his shop out of everyone baffled him, and he found himself slightly desperate to know the answer.
Harry offered him a warm smile as he wandered over. “I’d love to, but I’m meeting Ron and Hermione for dinner in thirty minutes. How about you come with me, and then you, Hermione, and I can do some knitting together and answer any questions you have?”
A comfortable silence fell between them, and Draco drank in the moment. There were no expectations, or obligations, or facades; no filling the air with empty conversation just for the sake of noise. Simply existing beside Harry was enough. He concentrated on Harry’s steady breaths as he watched his wireframe glasses reflect the last drops of sunlight before it gently dipped below the horizon. The moon hung low in the distance, barely a sliver against the vastness of the blush colored sky.
The conversation was kept very mild, which Harry wasn’t surprised about in the least. The closest they got to talking about the war was when Harry mentioned that he still had a hard time with the press, and even this was quickly skirted around.
A moment later, he stepped out into Andromeda’s spacious living room. Fairy coloring books littered the carpet, as did a few plastic horses and other various animals. Careful to navigate his way around them, Harry made his way towards the hallway that led to the bedrooms.
Harry could feel his cheeks burning hot with embarrassment as he tried to gather the words to say something —
Draco let out a small laugh. “It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that you’re miserable, Harry. You procrastinate going to work every single morning; I honestly don’t know how you haven’t been fired yet.”
Draco let out a heavy sigh. “Christmas was always my favorite day of the year as a child. I was beyond spoilt, never failing to be gifted every single thing that I’d asked for. My father has never been a particularly happy man, but he always smiled on Christmas. As I grew up and The Dark Lord began to gain notoriety again, Christmas felt like the one day that I didn’t have to think about my responsibilities.
Letting out a heavy sigh, Draco turned to him. “I think she would love it. What colors are available?”
An abruptive knock on his front door startled Harry, causing him to jump. He recognized the knock immediately as Hermione’s, and he smiled to himself as he wandered back down the hallway. Every Saturday, Hermione and Ron came by the shop to help out with sales and spend time with Harry. As Hermione was now head of the Muggle Liaison Department and Ron was a full-time Auror, it was one of the few times during the week where all three of them were able to carve out time in their busy schedules. Saturdays had, not surprisingly, quickly become Harry’s favorite day of the week.
When Harry woke on Christmas morning, it took him a moment to remember where he was. It wasn’t until after he blinked blearily, noticing a worn poster of The Weird Sisters hanging awkwardly off the ceiling, that he recalled the fact that he’d been assigned Ginny’s childhood room by Molly. Ginny and Luna weren’t arriving at the Burrow until around noon, as they’d spent Christmas Eve at Xenophilius’ house. Harry had been given the option of sleeping over with Ron and Hermione in Ron’s old room, but he’d quickly declined, not willing to take the chance of hearing his two best friends snogging. Plus, he’d gotten used to sleeping alone. For the most part.
“Right. Well, I’d go with an acrylic blend so that the blanket can be washed. There’s only so much a
A thick silence filled the air, neither of them quite knowing what to say. Harry could feel his heart beating steadily against his chest as he let himself look at Draco properly. He immediately regretted doing so.
“Oh,” Harry said, heat rising to his cheeks. “Well, considering the fact that we’ve seen each other nearly every day in December so far, I figure it’s time we ought to start calling each other by our first names.”
And it was true; Grimmauld Place looked as incredible as it always did during the holiday season. Thick ropes of garland were wrapped around the grand staircase’s banister, along with bright red ribbons and clusters of holly. The crystal chandelier hanging above the grand foyer collected golden light spilling from the various lanterns levitating about the place. Harry could only see a few craft stalls through the thick crowd, but he knew that they would be extending to every room in each story.
Once Hermione had opened the door to Harry’s room, she didn’t waste any time. Sitting on the edge of Harry’s bed, she gently pushed his black waves off of his forehead.
For the next thirty minutes, Harry went about drying himself off and getting dressed, picking out one of his favorite outfits: a deep purple jumper with a cream colored yoke in the pattern of snitches that Hermione had knit him several years ago, dark denim jeans, and a pair of black high top Chuck Taylors. After adding his round, wire rimmed glasses as a last touch, he managed to coax Stockinette into the kitchen with the promise of food.
Harry grinned, remembering Teddy’s doll. “Andy’s one of the kindest people I’ve ever met, which is remarkable considering what she’s been through. She’s got this fierceness to her ― something that reminds me a lot of Sirius ― and she’s hilarious. I know Ted, Tonks, and Remus’ deaths really hit her hard, so some days are worse for her than others. Overall, though, she’s doing pretty well, albeit a bit lonely.
Draco arched an eyebrow as he stripped off his coat and hung it on the coat rack next to the door. “Alright, Potter?”
As everyone took a seat ― some on the couch and others on the surrounding chairs ― Narcissa wandered out through the door that led to the dining room. There was a brightness in her eyes that, Harry realized, he’d never seen before, and there was a wide smile spreading across her thin face.
However, in the rare moments of clarity that Harry experienced, he could tell that he was slowly slipping away. While it was obvious that both Ron and Hermione had escaped the war with some bruising, they seemed to be coping alright, especially after having moved in together after a few months of dating. Hermione constantly praised Ron for his ability to calm her down after a particularly nasty dream, and Harry knew that Hermione had a knack for telling when Ron was reliving one of the various ways he had narrowly escaped fatal harm. However, they were both able to function, carrying on with what Harry considered to be as normal a life as possible. While Hermione held a lower position in the Muggle Liaison Office, Ron had begun his training as an Auror. Harry, having done nothing with his life, felt both empty and insignificant, wanting nothing more than to feel alright again.
“Well, you haven’t seen anything yet,” Draco said, grinning as he took a few steps forward. “Come on. This way.”
“It took us about a year to put everything together. The company opened in January of 2001, and customers were very few and far between in the beginning. It wasn’t until Kingsley stumbled upon the company while seeking out a decorator for the Ministry ball held in December that things began to take off, and the rest is history,” Draco said.
This is one of my favorite chapters, so I'm super excited to be posting this morning! I hope you all are doing well, and thank you so much for the continuous support <3
Since then, they’d managed to become even more inseparable. Draco had even tagged along to the shop the day after their ice skating date, helping Ron at the check-out counter while Harry and Hermione assisted the customers with any fiber questions. In a way, Harry felt largely relieved that Ron and Hermione were caught up with where he and Draco now stood ― boyfriends who were completely and utterly indivisible.
Once they’d queued up, Harry squinted at the menu, raking his eyes over the long list of flavored hot chocolates. He’d tried the majority of them at this point, although there were still a few that he had yet to indulge in. After a moment of contemplation, he landed on the hazelnut hot chocolate.
“No, no,” Harry said. “Stay. I was just thinking of spending the afternoon wandering around the shops, and I’d love your company.”
“I’ve missed you both too. I’m truly sorry I haven’t gotten over here sooner,” Harry said sheepishly.
The next evening, an hour before closing, Harry found himself looking longingly at the door, wishing nothing more than for a particular blond to wander into the shop.
“Well,” Malfoy said, his voice weary, “I didn’t exactly have a choice, did I? With the wizarding world casting me into exile, and all.”
“I just don’t understand how I haven’t seen it before …” Harry said, his voice trailing off as he flicked through his assorted memories of running into Malfoy in various parts of the Ministry.
Malfoy landed with a thud on the ground, and Harry realized he had completely forgotten to catch him. A cloud of dust erupted into the air, and he could hear several gasps coming from other groups nearby as McWeenie scrambled to help Malfoy up.
“As you can imagine, things are pretty different now. It’s just Mother and myself, so things are relatively quiet. I’ll help her cook, and then we’ll spend the evening playing chess. It’s simple enough, but I enjoy it nonetheless.
Harry wasn’t sure if Draco knew he had been thinking of kissing him or if he simply thought that Harry was acting strange. He sorely hoped it was the latter. Despite it having been only a few days since Draco had walked back into his life, he wasn’t ready to say goodbye.
Before Harry had time to react, Draco’s right hand wrapped around the base of his cock. Harry’s breath hitched, the pressure feeling both intoxicating and overwhelming as Draco leaned forward and slowly licked a stripe up the underside of his cock. Harry tilted his head back against the wall, and his eyes fluttered shut.
Harry grinned as he patted the space next to him. Draco rolled his eyes, although he couldn't help but let out a small laugh as he made his way to join Harry.
Harry had been right in his prediction of rain. By the time midday rolled around, deep claps of thunder were echoing across the dark sky, and an occasional flash of white light illuminated the heavy waves of raindrops crashing to the ground.
“Hey,” Potter said, pushing a stray strand of hair from Draco’s face. “There’s no need to be nervous. Turns out you’re a pretty lucky guy, after all.”
“Good. Well, you’re all set with your yarn. Want me to keep it here on the counter until we finish decorating?” Harry asked.
“So … how does knitting work, exactly? Like, how do I do it?” Harry asked, trying to imagine how one would get the yarn
Gathering all his courage, Harry turned to look at Malfoy, whose gaze had shifted to the ground. “Want to know what I think?”
Morning/afternoon/evening, everyone! I am THRILLED because I just remembered that the next chapter is one of my favorites!
. Exactly five years ago, Harry had picked up a pair of knitting needles for the first time. In fact, he still had the light green scarf he’d made, although he now knew that it had been dreadfully done. Stitches had been dropped everywhere, and his tension had been tighter than he’d realized. It had only ended up being six inches in length, not even enough to wrap entirely around his neck, but it served as a good reminder for all the progress that he’d made. While he still had his days, existing was not nearly as painful as it had been right after the war. With distance, time, and daily potions for anxiety and depression, he was not only living, but he was thriving.
. Small blue numbers appeared in the air, reading 7:05. With a great sigh, Harry flopped onto his back.
Once they were both dressed, Harry glanced at the alarm clock from across the room, which read ten past eleven. The train was long gone.
Malfoy looked ahead, his eyes fixated on something in the distance. “You see, there’s this git that I like, and I’ve felt this way about him for a while now — years, even. The issue is that we have history, and I’m not sure if liking each other is enough to bridge that gap. I’d like to think it is, though, because watching him from a distance has grown too difficult, and after this weekend … well, I don’t think I can go back to that.”
Harry paused, taking a deep breath as he watched a puff of clouds drift across the lush blue sky. While he was admittedly glad to be outside during such a perfect mid-June day, he would have much preferred to have spent it back at the office before heading home, cooking dinner, enjoying a glass of wine, and tending to his vegetable garden. With each minute that passed, he fantasized about all of the horrible, insulting things he wanted to say to McWeenie as a thank you for ruining his relaxing weekend.
After a moment, Potter pulled Draco away from the wall, and they stumbled their way onto the sofa, with Draco straddling Potter. Draco ground down, eliciting a moan from Potter, who quickly broke the kiss to mutter, “
“He wants the bloody tree to reach the ceiling, which should be interesting considering the fact that it’s six and a half meters tall.”
Draco’s face went blank as he took the measuring cup. “Well, I would, but I don’t know what the hell a microwank is or how to use it.”
Harry, Teddy, and Andromeda followed along as Narcissa and Draco led them into the dining room. A large table, running nearly the length of the room, was decorated with four vases of holly sprigs and three silver candelabras that had ornately carved dragons running along the stems. The room was dimly lit, shadows from the candles’ flames flickering across the deep teal walls, although several bright streams of pale moonlight were flooding through the large, rectangular window on the far wall.
“Liquid Luck, to be specific,” Draco said, wrapping his arms around Potter’s neck. “Pansy knows how desperately I want to fuck you, so she helped me out this morning. Poured it into my cappuccino. I drank it willingly.”
Harry watched as, next to him, Ron’s face soured at his mother’s words. He, Ron, Hermione, Molly, Arthur, Andromeda, and Teddy were huddled on the front porch of the Manor, a strong wind blowing gusts of snow flurries around them. As soon as Harry had asked Draco if he could come over on Christmas, he’d begun plotting a way for at least some of the Weasleys, as well as Andromeda, Teddy, and Hermione to come along with him as a surprise.
“Alright,” Teddy said, his mouth mimicking an explosion as he bumped their fists together and pulled away. “Granny wanted me to wear an ugly shirt.”
“Oh,” Harry said lamely, his mind churning. “In that case, how would you feel about dinner sometime this week?”
“Well, actually …” Harry began, heat blooming across his cheeks, “we did try to find proof. We just, well, never could find any.”
He let out a heavy sigh, closing his eyes as he leaned back against the headrest. For a moment, he could pretend that things were how he wanted them to be — long kisses, and sweaty hand-holding. Laughing until they couldn’t breathe, and looking at each other like they were the only people in the world.
past, anyway. Listen, I’m just curious about what you’ve been doing these past few years. I want to talk about the war about as much as you do. That being said, you’re not obligated to tell me anything.”
“Piss off,” Pansy muttered, setting her mug down with a little too much force and causing other nearby café patrons to look their way. “Look, Draco, you’ve been working on Potter’s house for five weeks now, and it’s
, he hadn’t. All he’d wanted was to find a nice, quiet flatmate who wouldn’t bother him too much. Although, looking back, that had clearly been too tall of an order; The Boy Who Lived was neither quiet nor undisruptive. Yet, somehow, Draco had found himself unable to say no to whatever charismatic Gryffindor bullshit Harry had been offering in return for a flat with privacy from the press.
“So,” Andromeda said, grinning as she interrupted, “you’re essentially telling me that this young man is fit?”
Harry scooted forward, cupping Malfoy’s face in both hands. Malfoy’s eyes went wide, but he didn’t struggle. Instead, he let out a soft breath, his eyes flickering down to Harry’s lips as he rested a hand on Harry’s chest.
Once they’d taken their seats across from one another at the table, Harry pulled out his yarn and needles and began to cast on the beginning of his one-hundred and twenty-one stitches. He’d occasionally look up and see Draco staring intently at his fingers.
He watched as Draco pulled his scarf, if one could call it that, out of his project bag and lay it out across his lap. Harry tried to mask his look of horror as he took in the uneven rows of bright orange yarn and the multitude of dropped stitches. Silently, he admitted that even
Harry returned the smile as he grabbed the cheap replacement broom, which he’d bought after losing his Firebolt during the war, off its propped position against the wall. Sliding out of the window, he looked down for a moment to watch all of the wixen passersby. Then, taking a deep breath, he took the leap.
been sleeping on the job, Harry and Hermione made their way past the rest of the tents and to the fire pit, where everyone else was milling about. Harry spotted Malfoy across the circle, and his stomach gave a funny flip.
Next to him, Stockinette was perched on top of the dresser, busying herself by meticulously cleaning her paws. Harry gave her a scratch behind her ears, which earned him a gentle head-butt that signaled a request for more.
Draco promptly dragged him across the road to a back alleyway and, once ensuring that they were out of sight, Disapparated them back to Harry’s flat. As soon as their feet were back on the ground, Draco was shoving Harry against the living room wall, their lips urgently meeting as Harry’s arms resumed their position around Draco’s neck. Harry could feel that he was steadily growing hard, his erection pressing tightly against the zipper of his jeans.
After having told the Weasley clan that he and Draco were together over dinner the previous evening, he’d quickly owled Andromeda to tell her the same thing. Then, with the help of Hermione, Harry had managed to persuade them into a visit. Molly had been the most unsure, having asked Harry a multitude of questions before finally letting the topic rest. She did, however, pull him aside before he’d gone to bed, informing him that she was happy as long as he was.
Draco leaned back in his seat, crossing his arms in amusement as a smirk spread across his face. “Alright then,
“Oh. Um, well, Molly likes zinnias. Dahlias too, I think. And nothing too fancy. She wouldn’t want that,” Harry said.
They’d somehow managed to skip that discussion the other night, despite their love confessions and the soft way in which they’d said goodnight. Harry felt perplexed, although he knew in his heart what he wanted the answer to be.
“Alright,” Harry said, nodding. “Well, I need to finish the paper snowflakes, so why don’t you get started on the toy train? There's lots to do before we can add the snow flurries, which will be a last touch.”
Harry watched as Draco raised his wand, casting the Snowfall Spell. Slowly, glistening clusters of snow flurries began to fall gently from the ceiling, dissolving upon impact on the ground. Harry looked to Draco, only to find him eyes wide and smiling brightly, several snowflakes landing on his light blond eyelashes.
“Slow down, ‘Mione. Don’t want to scare the bloke off,” Ron said, wandering in from the kitchen with a tea towel thrown over his flannel-clad shoulder.
Once Harry had tapped each item with the tip of his wand, Harry set down the menu on the coffee table before leaning back into the couch.
His eyes landed on Draco, who was standing to the right of the fireplace with Ron and Hermione. Just as Harry was about to go up to them, a hand on his shoulder held him back. He turned around to find Amber Zhao, the woman in charge of Grimmauld Place and the craft fair, grinning at him.
Looking over, Draco’s eyes were wide with wonder as he gently ran his slender fingers over the broom handle.
It wasn’t until after dinner that Harry began to feel a little more at ease. Teddy volunteered himself to help Narcissa put together the platter of Cauldron Cakes, and Andromeda cautiously tagged along. Harry figured it would be a good excuse for the three of them to spend a few moments alone, so he requested that Draco bring him around the Manor’s garden.
Once everyone had gone around and introduced themselves, Harry began the lengthy process of explaining the various supplies that went into knitting, trying to channel the patience that Hermione had shown him all those years ago. And, as soon as all questions had been answered, Harry had the students each take a skein of cheap, bulky yarn and a pair of 5.0 mm needles. Draco was the last one to reach for his supplies, grabbing an obnoxiously bright orange ball with a grimace. Harry held in a snicker.
Draco’s hand latched onto the Portkey, and they were sucked into the air. Harry felt the far too familiar feeling of being hooked by his middle and pulled through time, his body warping in ways that he preferred not to think about.
“This is the yarn you’ll want to use. It’s 100% merino wool. Go ahead and pick three colors,” Harry said.
From there, Harry was able to relax a little. Once everyone had been served tea and had taken a biscuit ― or four, in both Hermione and Arthur’s cases ― small conversations began to break out amongst the group. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all was the fact that Ron and Narcissa were sitting next to each other, engrossed in an intense conversation about chess. Arthur, Hermione, and Andromeda were discussing different Muggle contraptions that Arthur had been recently tinkering with, and Teddy was lolling around on the wooden floor, playing tea party with his plastic dinosaurs.
He’d also recovered enough from his own orgasm that he was beginning to grow hard again, which Draco took quick notice to.
“Really, although I do suppose I like the idea of dating. How does boyfriends sound to you?” Harry asked.
Once goodbyes had been said and Draco had stepped into the Floo, Harry turned around to find both Ron and Hermione staring at him.
“This is probably a sign that I come here too much,” he said, letting out a laugh. “Yes, I’d like the peppermint hot chocolate.”
“Thanks, Stocky,” Harry murmured before swiftly picking her, as well as the note, up and wandering back to the check-out counter.
With that, Draco set to work, gently pushing in and out until he’d obtained a fast, steady rhythm. Harry tipped his head back, his eyes fluttering shut as a groan escaped his mouth. His knuckles tightened around the sheets he was gripping, and he could feel his toes curling as Draco continued to pick up speed, thrusting in and out of him until the different movements blended together.
Andromeda shrugged dismissively as she wiped a stray tear from the corner of her eye. “It’s a lot, I suppose. I hadn’t prepared myself for how different ―
As Harry watched Draco’s tall, slender figure disappear into the crowd, he let out a heavy sigh. It was going to be a lonely evening.
“And I take it that Stockinette is in pure heaven?” Hermione asked, grinning. “I swear, no cat should love a human as much as she loves Draco.”
Draco leaned in, kissing him deeply. Harry could taste himself on Draco’s tongue, bitter and musky. For a moment, he forgot that Draco hadn’t been taken care of; that is, until he felt Draco’s erection pressing fiercely into his hip.
“Lovely, although would you mind casting a Disillusionment Charm on me? I’m not in the mood to get stared at today,” Draco said bitterly.
It was such a contrast to the boy Draco had been last time they’d come face-to-face in the Manor. Then, Draco had hardly resembled a living person, his hollow face having been consumed with shadows. Although so many things stood out from that day so many years ago, one thing Harry couldn’t forget, no matter how hard he tried, was the look of sheer terror in Draco’s eyes. Harry had never seen anything like it, as though he was witnessing the death of the boy he’d grown up with.
Slowly, he began to sit up, his weak muscles aching in protest. Hermione scooted off the bed, and he watched her wrinkle her nose at the smell as she peeled the blanket off of his body. He knew he needed to shower; his hair was greasy, clinging to his forehead, and he could feel a fine layer of grime covering his skin. Unfortunately, he was too worn out to be embarrassed.
“Boys,” Hermione sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “It’s Christmas morning, for Christ’s sake. Can we please not do this now?”
Harry nodded. “Yeah, everything here is. It’s really only the mass-produced yarns that aren’t hand dyed. Otherwise, you’re likely to be looking at indie dyers. No matter what brand of yarn, each batch of dyed skeins is called a dye lot. With projects that involve more than one skein of yarn, you’ll want to make sure that your skeins are from the same lot, as each one varies in color due to the hand dying aspect. Does that make sense?”
Harry turned to Teddy, who had plopped on the floor and was clutching a doll with deep brown skin and black ringlets.
